				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR ENHANCED MUCOSAL DELIVERY<br>
OF Y2 RECEPTOR-BINDING PEPTIDES AND METHODS FOR TREATING AND<br>
PREVENTING OBESITY<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Obesity and its associated disorders are common and very serious public health<br>
problems in the United States and throughout the world. Upper body obesity is the<br>
strongest risk factor known for type-2 diabetes mellitus, and is a strong risk factor for<br>
cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a recognized risk factor for hypertension,<br>
arteriosclerosis, congestive heart failure, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep<br>
apnea, reproductive disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, cancers of the breast,<br>
prostate, and colon, and increased incidence of complications of general anesthesia. It<br>
reduces life-span and carries a serious risk of co-morbidities above, as well disorders such<br>
as infections, varicose veins, acanthosis nigricans, eczema, exercise intolerance, insulin<br>
resistance, hypertension hypercholesterolemia, cholelithiasis, orthopedic injury, and<br>
thromboembolic disease. Obesity is also a risk factor for the group of conditions called<br>
insulin resistance syndrome, or "Syndrome X."<br>
It has been shown that certain peptides that bind to the Y2 receptor when<br>
administered peripherally to a mammal induce weight loss. The Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptides are neuropeptides that bind to the Y2 receptor. Neuropeptides are small peptides<br>
originating from large precursor proteins synthesized by peptidergic neurons and<br>
endocrine/paracrine cells. Often the precursors contain multiple biologically active<br>
peptides. There is great diversity of neuropeptides in the brain caused by alternative<br>
splicing of primary gene transcripts and differential precursor processing. The neuropeptide<br>
receptors serve to discriminate between ligands and to activate the appropriate signals.<br>
These Y2 receptor-binding peptides belong to a family of peptides including peptide YY<br>
(PYY), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pancreatic peptide (PP).<br>
NPY is a 36-amino acid peptide and is the most abundant neuropeptide to be<br>
identified in mammalian brain. NPY is an important regulator in both the central and<br>
peripheral nervous systems and influences a diverse range of physiological parameters,<br>
including effects on psychomotor activity, food intake, central endocrine secretion, and<br>
vasoactivity in the cardiovascular system. High concentrations of NPY are found in<br>
the sympathetic nerves supplying the coronary, cerebral, and renal vasculature and have<br>
contributed to vasoconstriction. NPY binding sites have been identified in a variety of tissues,<br>
including spleen, intestinal membranes, brain, aortic smooth muscle, kidney, testis, and<br>
placenta.<br>
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor pharmacology is currently defined by structure activity<br>
relationships within the pancreatic polypeptide family. This family includes NPY, which is<br>
synthesized primarily in neurons; PYY, which is synthesized primarily by endocrine cells in<br>
the gut; and PP, which is synthesized primarily by endocrine cells in the pancreas. These<br>
approximately 36 amino acid peptides have a compact helical structure involving a "PP-fold"<br>
in the middle of the peptide. Specific features include a polyproline helix in residues 1<br>
through 8, a .beta.-turn in residues 9 through 14, an .alpha.-helix in residues 15 through 30,<br>
an outward-projecting C-terminus in residues 30 through 36, and a carboxyl terminal amide,<br>
which appears to be critical for biological activity. The peptides have been used to define at<br>
least five receptor subtypes known as Yl, Y2, Y3, Y4 and Y5. Yl receptor recognition by<br>
NPY involves both N- and C-terminal regions of the peptide; exchange of Gln34 with Pro34 is<br>
fairly well tolerated. Y2 receptor recognition by NPY depends primarily upon the four C-<br>
terminal residues of the peptide (Arg33 - Gln34 -Arg35 - Tyr36 -NH2) preceded by an<br>
amphipathic alpha.-helix ; exchange of Gln34 with Pro34 is not well tolerated. One of the key<br>
pharmacological features which distinguish Yl and Y2 is the fact that the Y2 receptor (and<br>
not the Y1 receptor) has high affinity for the NPY peptide carboxyl-terminal fragment NPY-<br>
(13-36) and the PYY fragment PYY22-36.<br>
It has been shown that a 36 amino acid peptide called Peptide YY(l-36) [PYY(l-36)]<br>
[YPIKPEAPGEDASPEELNRYYASLRHYLNLVTRQRY, SEQ ID NO.: 1]. when<br>
administered peripherally by injection to an individual produces weight loss and thus can be<br>
used as a drug to treat obesity and related diseases, Morley, J. Neuropsychobiology 21:22-30<br>
(1989). It was later found that to produce this effect PYY bound to a Y2 receptor, and the<br>
binding of a Y2 agonist to the Y2 receptor caused a decrease in the ingestion of carbohydrate,<br>
protein and meal size, Leibowitz, S.F. et al. Peptides, 12: 1251-1260 (1991). An alternate<br>
molecular form of PYY is PYY(3-36) IKPEAPGEDASPEELNRYYASLRHYLNLVTRQRY<br>
[SEQ ID NO.: 2], Eberlein, Eysselein et al. Peptides 10: 797-803, 1989). This fragment<br>
constitutes approximately 40% of total PYY-like immunoreactivity in human and canine<br>
intestinal extracts and about 36% of total plasma PYY immunoreactivity in a fasting state to<br>
slightly over 50% following a meal. It is apparently a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4)<br>
cleavage product of PYY. PYY3-36 is reportedly a selective ligand at the Y2 and Y5<br>
receptors, which appear pharmacologically unique in preferring N-terminally truncated (i.e.<br>
C-terminal fragments of) NPY analogs. It has also been shown that a PYY fragment having<br>
only residues 22-36 will still bind to the Y2 receptor. However, if any of the carboxyl<br>
terminus of the peptide is cleaved, the peptide looses its ability to bind to the Y2 receptor.<br>
Hence a PYY agonist is a peptide, which has a partial sequence of full-length PYY and is<br>
able to bind to a Y2 receptor in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Hereinafter the<br>
term PYY refers to full-length PYY and any fragment of PYY that binds to a Y2 receptor.<br>
It is known that PYY and PYY3-36 can be administered by intravenous infusion or<br>
injection to treat life-threatening hypotension as encountered in shock, especially that caused<br>
by endotoxins (US Patent 4,839,343), to inhibit proliferation of pancreatic tumors in<br>
mammals by perfusion, parenteral, intravenous, or subcutaneous administration, and by<br>
implantation (US Patent 5,574,010) and to treat obesity (Morley, J. Neuropsychobiology<br>
21:22-30 (1989) and US Patent Application 20020141985). It is also claimed that PYY can<br>
be administered by parenteral, oral, nasal, rectal and topical routes to domesticated animals or<br>
humans in an amount effective to increase weight gain of said subject by enhancing<br>
gastrointestinal absorption of a sodium-dependent cotransported nutrient (US Patent<br>
5,912,227). However, for the treatment of obesity and related diseases, including diabetes,<br>
the mode of administration has been limited to intravenous IV infusion with no effective<br>
formulations optimized for alternative administration of PYY3-36. None of these prior art<br>
teachings provide formulations that contain PYY or PYY(3-36) combined with excipients<br>
designed to enhance mucosal (i.e., nasal, buccal, oral) delivery nor do they teach the value of<br>
endotoxin-free Y2-receptor binding peptide formulations for non-infused administration.<br>
Thus, there is a need to develop formulations and methods for administering PYY3-36.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention fulfills the foregoing needs and satisfies additional objects and<br>
advantages by providing novel, effective methods and compositions for mucosal, especially<br>

wasting related to cancer in a mammalian subject, or to alleviate one or more clinically well-<br>
recognized symptoms of obesity, as well as treating Alzheimer's disease, colon carcinoma,<br>
colon adenocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast carcinoma.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, pharmaceutical formulations and methods are<br>
directed to administration of a Y2 receptor-binding peptide agonist in combination with<br>
vitamin E succinate. A Y2 receptor-binding peptide agonist in combination with vitamin E<br>
succinate may be administered to alleviate symptoms or prevent the onset or lower the<br>
incidence or severity of cancer, for example, colon adenocarcinoma, pancreatic<br>
adenocarcinoma, or breast cancer.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, it was surprisingly found that the use of endotoxin-<br>
free Y2 receptor binding peptides, for example PYY(3-36), produced increased mucosal<br>
delivery compared to peptides in which endotoxin is not removed. The use of endotxin-free<br>
Y2 receptor peptides in pharmaceutical formulations is thus enabled for administration by<br>
non-infusion routes, including mucosal delivery, nasal, oral, pulmonary, vaginal, rectal and<br>
the like.<br>
The foregoing mucosal Y2 receptor-binding peptide formulations and preparative and<br>
delivery methods of the invention provide improved mucosal delivery of a Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide to mammalian subjects. These compositions and methods can involve<br>
combinatorial formulation or coordinate administration of one or more Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptides with one or more mucosal delivery-enhancing agents. Among the mucosal delivery-<br>
enhancing agents to be selected from to achieve these formulations and methods are (a)<br>
solubilization agents; (b) charge modifying agents; (c) pH control agents; (d) degradative<br>
enzyme inhibitors; (e) mucolytic or mucus clearing agents; (f) ciliostatic agents; (g)<br>
membrane penetration-enhancing agents (e.g., (i) a surfactant, (ii) a bile salt, (ii) a<br>
phospholipid or fatty acid additive, mixed micelle, liposome, or carrier, (iii) an alcohol, (iv)<br>
an enamine, (v) an NO donor compound, (vi) a long-chain amphipathic molecule (vii) a small<br>
hydrophobic penetration enhancer; (viii) sodium or a salicylic acid derivative; (ix) a glycerol<br>
ester of acetoacetic acid (x) a cyclodextrin or beta-cyclodextrin derivative, (xi) a medium-<br>
chain fatty acid, (xii) a chelating agent, (xiii) an amino acid or salt thereof, (xiv) an N-<br>
acetylamino acid or salt thereof, (xv) an enzyme degradative to a selected membrane<br>
component, (ix) an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, (x) an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis;<br>
or (xi) any combination of the membrane penetration enhancing agents of (i)-(x)); (h)<br>
modulatory agents of epithelial junction physiology, such as nitric oxide (NO) stimulators,<br>
chitosan, and chitosan derivatives; (i) vasodilator agents; (j) selective transport-enhancing<br>
agents; and (k) stabilizing delivery vehicles, carriers, supports or complex-forming species<br>
with which the Y2 receptor-binding peptide (s) is/are effectively combined, associated,<br>
contained, encapsulated or bound to stabilize the active agent for enhanced mucosal delivery.<br>
In various embodiments of the invention, peptide YY is combined with one, two,<br>
three, four or more of the mucosal delivery-enhancing agents recited in (a)-(k), above. These<br>
mucosal delivery-enhancing agents may be admixed, alone or together, with peptide YY, or<br>
otherwise combined therewith in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation or delivery<br>
vehicle. Formulation of peptide YY with one or more of the mucosal delivery-enhancing<br>
agents according to the teachings herein (optionally including any combination of two or<br>
more mucosal delivery-enhancing agents selected from (a)-(k) above) provides for increased<br>
bioavailability of the peptide YY following delivery thereof to a mucosal surface of a<br>
mammalian subject.<br>
Thus, the present invention is a method for suppressing apetite, promoting weight<br>
loss, decreasing food intake, or treating obesity and/or diabetes in a mammal comprising<br>
transmucosally administering a formulation comprised of a Y2 receptor-binding peptide, such<br>
that when at 50 ug of the Y2 receptor is administered transmucosally to the mammal the<br>
concentration of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide in the plasma of the mammal increases by at<br>
least 5 pmol, preferably at least 10 pmol per liter of plasma. Examples of such formulations<br>
are described above.<br>
The present invention further provides for the use of a Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
for the production of medicament for the transmucosal, administration of a Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide for suppressing apetite, promoting weight loss, decreasing food intake, or<br>
treating obesity in a mammal such that when about 50 ug of the Y2 receptor is administered<br>
transmucosally to the mammal the concentration of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide in the<br>
plasma of the mammal increases by at least 5 pmol per liter of plasma. When 100 µg of the<br>
Y2 receptor-binding peptide is administered intranasally to the mammal, the concentration of<br>
the Y2 receptor agonist increases by at least 20 pmol per liter of plasma in the mammal.<br>
When 150 µg is administered, the concentration<br>
A mucosally effective dose of peptide YY within the pharmaceutical formulations of<br>
the present invention comprises, for example, between about 0.001 pmol to about 100 pmol<br>
per kg body weight, between about 0.01 pmol to about 10 pmol per kg body weight, or<br>
between about 0.1 pmol to about 5 pmol per kg body weight. In further exemplary<br>
embodiments, dosage of peptide YY is between about 0.5 pmol to about 1.0 pmol per kg<br>
body weight. In a preferred embodiment an intranasal dose will range from 50 µg to 400 µg,<br>
preferably 100 µg to 200 µg, most preferably about 100 µg to 150 µg. The pharmaceutical<br>
formulations of the present invention may be administered one or more times per day (for<br>
example, before a meal), or 3 times per week or once per week for between one week and at<br>
least 96 weeks or even for the life of the individual patient or subject. In certain<br>
embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention are administered one or more<br>
times daily, two times daily, four times daily, six times daily, or eight times daily.<br>
Intranasal delivery-enhancing agents are employed which enhance delivery of peptide<br>
YY into or across a nasal mucosal surface. For passively absorbed drugs, the relative<br>
contribution of paracellular and transcellular pathways to drug transport depends upon the<br>
pKa, partition coefficient, molecular radius and charge of the drug, the pH of the luminal<br>
environment in which the drug is delivered, and the area of the absorbing surface. The<br>
intranasal delivery-enhancing agent of the present invention may be a pH control agent. The<br>
pH of the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is a factor affecting absorption<br>
of peptide YY via paracellular and transcellular pathways to drug transport. In one<br>
embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is pH adjusted to<br>
between about pH 3.0 to 6.5. In a further embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation of the<br>
present invention is pH adjusted to between about pH 3.0 to 5.0. In a further embodiment,<br>
the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is pH adjusted to between about pH<br>
4.0 to 5.0. Generally, the pH is 5.0±0.3.<br>

as in the human form, and guinea pig PP (SEQ ID NO: 89).<br>
According to the present invention a PP peptide also includes the free bases, acid<br>
additoin salts or metal salts, such as potassium or sodium salts of the peptides, and PP<br>
peptides that have been modified by such processes as amidation, glycosylation, acylation,<br>
sulfation, phosphorylation, acetylation, cyclization, and other known covalent modification<br>
methods. These peptides typically bind to the Y receptors in the brain and elsewhere,<br>
especially the Y2 and/or Y5 receptors. Typically these peptides are synthesized in endotoxin-<br>
free or pyrogen-free forms although this is not always necessary.<br>
Mucosal Delivery Enhancing Agents<br>
"Mucosal delivery enhancing agents" are defined as chemicals and other excipients<br>
that, when added to a formulation comprising water, salts and/or common buffers and Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide (the control formulation) produce a formulation that produces a<br>
significant increase in transport of Y2 receptor-binding peptide across a mucosa as measured<br>
by the maximum blood, serum, or cerebral spinal fluid concentration (Cmax) or by the area<br>
under the curve, AUC, in a plot of concentration versus time. A mucosa includes the nasal,<br>
oral, intestional, buccal, bronchopulmonary, vaGlnal, and rectal mucosal surfaces and in fact<br>
includes all mucus-secreting membranes lining all body cavities or passages that<br>
communicate with the exterior. Mucosal delivery enhancing agents are sometimes called<br>
carriers.<br>
Endotoxin-free formulation<br>
"Endotoxin-free formulation" means a formulation which contains a Y2-receptor-<br>
binding peptide and one or more mucosal delivery enhancing agents that is substantially free<br>
of endotoxins and/or related pyrogenic substances. Endotoxins include toxins that are<br>
confined inside a microorganism and are released only when the microorganisms are broken<br>
down or die. Pyrogenic substances include fever-inducing, thermostable substances<br>
(glycoproteins) from the outer membrane of bacteria and other microorganisms. Both of these<br>
substances can cause fever, hypotension and shock if administered to humans. Producing<br>
formulations that are endotoxin-free can require special equipment, expert artisians, and can<br>
be significantly more expensive than making formulations that are not endotoxin-free.<br>
Because intravenous administration of NPY or PYY simultaneously with infusion of<br>
endotoxin in rodents has been shown to prevent the hypotension and even death associated<br>
with the administration of endotoxin alone (US Patent 4,839,343), producing endotoxin-free<br>
formulations of these therapeutic agents would not be expected to be necessary for non-<br>
parental (non-injected) administration.<br>
Non-infused Administration<br>
"Non-infused administration" means any method of delivery that does not involve an<br>
injection directly into an artery or vein, a method which forces or drives (typically a fluid)<br>
into something and especially to introduce into a body part by means of a needle, syringe or<br>
other invasive method. Non-infused administration includes subcutaneous injection,<br>
intramuscular injection, intraparitoneal injection and the non-injection methods of delivery to<br>
a mucosa.<br>
Treatment and Prevention of Obesity<br>
As noted above, the instant invention provides improved and useful methods and<br>
compositions for nasal mucosal delivery of a Y2 receptor-binding peptide to prevent and treat<br>
obesity in mammalian subjects. As used herein, prevention and treatment of obesity mean<br>
prevention of the onset or lowering the incidence or severity of clinical obesity by reducing<br>
food intake during meals and/or reducing body weight during administration or maintaining a<br>
reduced body weight following weight loss or before weight gain has occurred.<br>
The instant invention provides improved and useful methods and compositions for<br>
nasal mucosal deliverv of Y2 recentor-binding peptide to regions of the brain, for example,<br>
the hypothalamus or the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and NPY arcuate neurons, to prevent<br>
and treat obesity in mammalian subjects. The Y2 receptor-binding peptide can also be<br>
administered in conjunction with a Yl receptor antagonist such as dihyropyridine.<br>
Methods and Compositions of Delivery<br>
Improved methods and compositions for mucosal administration of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide to mammalian subjects optimize Y2 receptor-binding peptide dosing<br>
schedules. The present invention provides mucosal delivery of Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
formulated with one or more mucosal delivery-enhancing agents wherein Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide dosage release is substantially normalized and/or sustained for an effective<br>
delivery period of Y2 receptor-binding peptide release ranges from approximately 0.1 to 2.0<br>
hours; 0.4 to 1.5 hours; 0.7 to 1.5 hours; or 0.8 to 1.0 hours; following mucosal<br>
administration. The sustained release of Y2 receptor-binding peptide achieved may be<br>
facilitated by repeated administration of exogenous Y2 receptor-binding peptide utilizing<br>
methods and compositions of the present invention.<br>
Compositions and Methods of Sustained Release<br>
Improved compositions and methods for mucosal administration of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide to mammalian subjects optimize Y2 receptor-binding peptide dosing<br>
schedules. The present invention provides improved mucosal (e.g., nasal) delivery of a<br>
formulation comprising Y2 receptor-binding peptide in combination with one or more<br>
mucosal delivery-enhancing agents and an optional sustained release-enhancing agent or<br>
agents. Mucosal delivery-enhancing agents of the present invention yield an effective<br>
increase in delivery, e.g., an increase in the maximal plasma concentration (CmaX) to enhance<br>
the therapeutic activity of mucosally-administered Y2 receptor-binding peptide. A second<br>
factor affecting therapeutic activity of Y2 receptor-binding peptide in the blood plasma and<br>
CNS is residence time (RT). Sustained release-enhancing agents, in combination with<br>
intranasal delivery-enhancing agents, increase Cmax and increase residence time (RT) of Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide. Polymeric delivery vehicles and other agents and methods of the<br>
present invention that yield sustained release-enhancing formulations, for example,<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG), are disclosed herein. The present invention provides an improved<br>
Y2 receptor-binding peptide delivery method and dosage form for treatment of symptoms<br>
related to obesity, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, or breast cancer in mammalian subjects.<br>
Within the mucosal delivery formulations and methods of the invention, the Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide is frequently combined or coordinately administered with a suitable<br>
carrier or vehicle for mucosal delivery. As used herein, the term "carrier" means a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solid or liquid filler, diluent or encapsulating material. A water-<br>
containing liquid carrier can contain pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as acidifying<br>
agents, alkalizing agents, antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, buffering agents,<br>
chelating agents, complexing agents, solubilizing agents, humectants, solvents, suspending<br>
and/or viscosity-increasing agents, tonicity agents, wetting agents or other biocompatible<br>
materials. A tabulation of ingredients listed by the above categories, can be found in the U.S.<br>
Pharmacopeia National Formulary, 1857-1859, (1990). Some examples of the materials<br>
which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars, such as lactose, glucose<br>
and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such<br>
as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered<br>
tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils<br>
such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean<br>
oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and<br>
polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such<br>
as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alGlnic acid; pyrogen free water; isotonic<br>
saline;" Ringer's solution, ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non<br>
toxic compatible substances used in pharmaceutical formulations. Wetting agents,<br>
emulsifiers and lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as<br>
coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents,<br>
preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions, according to the<br>
desires of the formulator. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include,<br>
water soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfite,<br>
sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbyl<br>
palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin,<br>
propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol and the like; and metal-chelating agents such as citric acid,<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid and the like.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the particular mode of administration.<br>
Within the mucosal delivery compositions and methods of the invention, various<br>
delivery-enhancing agents are employed which enhance delivery of Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide into or across a mucosal surface. In this regard, delivery of Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide across the mucosal epithelium can occur "transcellularly" or "paracellularly". The<br>
extent to which these pathways contribute to the overall flux and bioavailability of the Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide depends upon the environment of the mucosa, the physico-chemical<br>
properties the active agent, and on the properties of the mucosal epithelium. Paracellular<br>
transport involves only passive diffusion, whereas transcellular transport can occur by<br>
passive, facilitated or active processes. Generally, hydrophilic, passively transported, polar<br>
solutes diffuse through the paracellular route, while more lipophilic solutes use the<br>
transcellular route. Absorption and bioavailability (e.g., as reflected by a permeability<br>
coefficient or physiological assay), for diverse, passively and actively absorbed solutes, can<br>
be readily evaluated, in terms of both paracellular and transcellular delivery components, for<br>
any selected Y2 receptor-binding peptide within the invention. For passively absorbed drugs,<br>
the relative contribution of paracellular and transcellular pathways to drug transport depends<br>
upon the pKa, partition coefficient, molecular radius and charge of the drug, the pH of the<br>
luminal environment in which the drug is delivered, and the area of the absorbing surface.<br>
The paracellular route represents a relatively small fraction of accessible surface area of the<br>
nasal mucosal epithelium. In general terms, it has been reported that cell membranes occupy<br>
a mucosal surface area that is a thousand times greater than the area occupied by the<br>
paracellular spaces. Thus, the smaller accessible area, and the size- and charge-based<br>
discrimination against macromolecular permeation would suggest that the paracellular route<br>
would be a generally less favorable route than transcellular delivery for drug transport.<br>
Surprisingly, the methods and compositions of the invention provide for significantly<br>
enhanced transport of biotherapeutics into and across mucosal epithelia via the paracellular<br>
route. Therefore, the methods and compositions of the invention successfully target both<br>
paracellular and transcellular routes, alternatively or within a single method or composition.<br>
As used herein, "mucosal delivery-enhancing agents" include agents which enhance<br>
the release or solubility (e.g., from a formulation delivery vehicle), diffusion rate, penetration<br>
capacity and timing, uptake, residence time, stability, effective half-life, peak or sustained<br>
concentration levels, clearance and other desired mucosal delivery characteristics (e.g., as<br>
measured at the site of delivery, or at a selected target site of activity such as the bloodstream<br>
or central nervous system) of Y2 receptor-binding peptide or other biologically active<br>
compound(s). Enhancement of mucosal delivery can thus occur by any of a variety of<br>
mechanisms, for example by increasing the diffusion, transport, persistence or stability of Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide, increasing membrane fluidity, modulating the availability or action<br>
of calcium and other ions that regulate intracellular or paracellular permeation, solubilizing<br>
mucosal membrane components (e.g., lipids), chanGlng non-protein and protein sulfhydryl<br>
levels in mucosal tissues, increasing water flux across the mucosal surface, modulating<br>
epithelial junctional physiology, reducing the viscosity of mucus overlying the mucosal<br>
epithelium, reducing mucociliary clearance rates, and other mechanisms.<br>
As used herein, a "mucosally effective amount of Y2 receptor-binding peptide"<br>
contemplates effective mucosal delivery of Y2 receptor-binding peptide to a target site for<br>
drug activity in the subject that may involve a variety of delivery or transfer routes. For<br>
example, a given active agent may find its way through clearances between cells of the<br>
mucosa and reach an adjacent vascular wall, while by another route the agent may, either<br>
passively or actively, be taken up into mucosal cells to act within the cells or be discharged or<br>
transported out of the cells to reach a secondary target site, such as the systemic circulation.<br>
The methods and compositions of the invention may promote the translocation of active<br>
agents along one or more such alternate routes, or may act directly on the mucosal tissue or<br>
proximal vascular tissue to promote absorption or penetration of the active agent(s). The<br>
promotion of absorption or penetration in this context is not limited to these mechanisms.<br>
As used herein "peak concentration (Cmax) of Y2 receptor-binding peptide in a blood<br>
plasma", "area under concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of Y2 receptor-binding peptide in a<br>
blood plasma", "time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax) of Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
in a blood plasma" are pharmacokinetic parameters known to one skilled in the art. Laursen<br>
et al., Eur. J. Endocrinology, 135: 309-315, 1996. The "concentration vs. time curve"<br>
measures the concentration of Y2 receptor-binding peptide in a blood serum of a subject vs.<br>
time after administration of a dosage of Y2 receptor-binding peptide to the subject either by<br>
intranasal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or other parenteral route of administration. "Cmax" is<br>
the maximum concentration of Y2 receptor-binding peptide in the blood serum of a subject<br>
following a single dosage of Y2 receptor-binding peptide to the subject. "tmax" is the time to<br>
reach maximum concentration of Y2 receptor-binding peptide in a blood serum of a subject<br>
following administration of a single dosage of Y2 receptor-binding peptide to the subject.<br>
As used herein, "area under concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide in a blood plasma" is calculated according to the linear trapezoidal rule and<br>
with addition of the residual areas. A decrease of 23% or an increase of 30% between two<br>
dosages would be detected with a probability of 90% (type II error (5 = 10%). The "delivery<br>
rate" or "rate of absorption" is estimated by comparison of the time (tmax) to reach the<br>
maximum concentration (Cmax). Both Cmax and tmax are analyzed using non-parametric<br>
methods. Comparisons of the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous<br>
and intranasal Y2 receptor-binding peptide administrations were performed by analysis of<br>
variance (ANOVA). For pair wise comparisons a Bonferroni-Holmes sequential procedure<br>
was used to evaluate significance. The dose-response relationship between the three nasal<br>
doses was estimated by regression analysis. P 
given as mean values +/- SEM.<br>
While the mechanism of absorption promotion may vary with different mucosal<br>
delivery-enhancing agents of the invention, useful reagents in this context will not<br>
substantially adversely affect the mucosal tissue and will be selected according to the<br>
physicochemical characteristics of the particular Y2 receptor-binding peptide or other active<br>
or delivery-enhancing agent. In this context, delivery-enhancing agents that increase<br>
penetration or permeability of mucosal tissues will often result in some alteration of the<br>
protective permeability barrier of the mucosa. For such delivery-enhancing agents to be of<br>
value within the invention, it is generally desired that any significant changes in permeability<br>
of the mucosa be reversible within a time frame appropriate to the desired duration of drug<br>
delivery. Furthermore, there should be no substantial, cumulative toxicity, nor any<br>
permanent deleterious changes induced in the barrier properties of the mucosa with long-term<br>
use.<br>
Within certain aspects of the invention, absorption-promoting agents for coordinate<br>
administration or combinatorial formulation with Y2 receptor-binding peptide of the<br>
invention are selected from small hydrophilic molecules, including but not limited to,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide, ethanol, propylene glycol, and the 2-<br>
pyrrolidones. Alternatively, long-chain amphipathic molecules, for example, deacylmethyl<br>
sulfoxide, azone, sodium laurylsulfate, oleic acid, and the bile salts, may be employed<br>
toenhance mucosal penetration of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide. In additional aspects,<br>
surfactants (e.g., polysorbates) are employed as adjunct compounds, processing agents, or<br>
formulation additives to enhance intranasal delivery of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide.<br>
Agents such as DMSO, polyethylene glycol, and ethanol can, if present in sufficiently high<br>
concentrations in delivery environment (e.g., by pre-administration or incorporation in a<br>
therapeutic formulation), enter the aqueous phase of the mucosa and alter its solubilizing<br>
properties, thereby enhancing the partitioning of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide from the<br>
vehicle into the mucosa.<br>
Additional mucosal delivery-enhancing agents that are useful within the coordinate<br>
administration and processing methods and combinatorial formulations of the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mixed micelles; enamines; nitric oxide donors (e.g., S-nitroso-<br>
N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine, NOR1, N0R4~which are preferably co-administered with an<br>
NO scavenger such as carboxy-PITO or doclofenac sodium); sodium salicylate; glycerol<br>
esters of acetoacetic acid (e.g., glyceryl-l,3-diacetoacetate or l,2-isopropylideneglycerine-3-<br>
acetoacetate); and other release-diffusion or intra- or trans-epithelial penetration-promoting<br>
agents that are physiologically compatible for mucosal delivery. Other absorption-promoting<br>
agents are selected from a variety of carriers, bases and excipients that enhance mucosal<br>
delivery, stability, activity or trans-epithelial penetration of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide.<br>
These include, inter alia, cyclodextrins and p-cyclodextrin derivatives (e.g., 2-<br>
hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin and heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl-ß-cyclodextrin). These<br>
compounds, optionally conjugated with one or more of the active ingredients and further<br>
optionally formulated in an oleaGlnous base, enhance bioavailability in the mucosal<br>
formulations of the invention. Yet additional absorption-enhancing agents adapted for<br>
mucosal delivery include medium-chain fatty acids, including mono- and diglycerides (e.g.,<br>
sodium caprate--extracts of coconut oil, Capmul), and triglycerides (e.g., amylodextrin,<br>
Estaram 299, Miglyol 810).<br>
The mucosal therapeutic and prophylactic compositions of the present invention may<br>
be supplemented with any suitable penetration-promoting agent that facilitates absorption,<br>
diffusion, or penetration of Y2 receptor-binding peptide across mucosal barriers. The<br>
penetration promoter may be any promoter that is pharmaceutically acceptable. Thus, in<br>
more detailed aspects of the invention compositions are provided that incorporate one or<br>
more penetration-promoting agents selected from sodium salicylate and salicylic acid<br>
derivatives (acetyl salicylate, choline salicylate, salicylamide, etc.); amino acids and salts<br>
thereof (e.g. monoaminocarboxlic acids such as glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, proline,<br>
hydroxyproline, etc.; hydroxyamino acids such as serine; acidic amino acids such as aspartic<br>
acid, glutamic acid, etc; and basic amino acids such as lysine etc—inclusive of their alkali<br>
metal or alkaline earth metal salts); and N-acetylamino acids (N-acetylalanine, N-<br>
acetylphenylalanine, N-acetylserine, N-acetylglycine, N-acetyllysine, N-acetylglutamic acid,<br>
N-acetylproline, N-acetylhydroxyproline, etc.) and their salts (alkali metal salts and alkaline<br>
earth metal salts). Also provided as penetration-promoting agents within the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention are substances which are generally used as emulsifiers (e.g.<br>
sodium oleyl phosphate, sodium lauryl phosphate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium myristyl<br>
sulfate, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, etc.), caproic acid, lactic<br>
acid, malic acid and citric acid and alkali metal salts thereof, pyrrolidonecarboxylic acids,<br>
alkylpyrrolidonecarboxylic acid esters, N-alkylpyrrolidones, proline acyl esters, and the like.<br>
Within various aspects of the invention, improved nasal mucosal delivery<br>
formulations and methods are provided that allow delivery of Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
and other therapeutic agents within the invention across mucosal barriers between<br>
administration and selected target sites. Certain formulations are specifically adapted for a<br>
selected target cell, tissue or organ, or even a particular disease state. In other aspects,<br>
formulations and methods provide for efficient, selective endo- or transcytosis of Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide specifically routed along a defined intracellular or intercellular<br>
pathway. Typically, the Y2 receptor-binding peptide is efficiently loaded at effective<br>
concentration levels in a carrier or other delivery vehicle, and is delivered and maintained in a<br>
stabilized form, e.g., at the nasal mucosa and/or during passage through intracellular<br>
compartments and membranes to a remote target site for drug action (e.g., the blood stream or<br>
a defined tissue, organ, or extracellular compartment). The Y2 receptor-binding peptide may<br>
be provided in a delivery vehicle or otherwise modified (e.g., in the form of a prodrug),<br>
wherein release or activation of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide is triggered by a<br>
physiological stimulus (e.g. pH change, lysosomal enzymes, etc.) Often, the Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide is pharmacologically inactive until it reaches its target site for activity. In<br>
most cases, the Y2 receptor-binding peptide and other formulation components are non-toxic<br>
and non-immunogenic. In this context, carriers and other formulation components are<br>
generally selected for their ability to be rapidly degraded and excreted under physiological<br>
conditions. At the same time, formulations are chemically and physically stable in dosage<br>
form for effective storage.<br>
Peptide and Protein Analogs and Mimetics<br>
Included within the definition of biologically active peptides and proteins for use<br>
within the invention are natural or synthetic, therapeutically or prophylactically active,<br>
peptides (comprised of two or more covalently linked amino acids), proteins, peptide or<br>
protein fragments, peptide or protein analogs, and chemically modified derivatives or salts of<br>
active peptides or proteins. A wide variety of useful analogs and mimetics of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide are contemplated for use within the invention and can be produced and tested<br>
for biological activity according to known methods. Often, the peptides or proteins of Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide or other biologically active peptides or proteins for use within the<br>
invention are muteins that are readily obtainable by partial substitution, addition, or deletion<br>
of amino acids within a naturally occurring or native (e.g., wild-type, naturally occurring<br>
mutant, or allelic variant) peptide or protein sequence. Additionally, biologically active<br>
fragments of native peptides or proteins are included. Such mutant derivatives and fragments<br>
substantially retain the desired biological activity of the native peptide or proteins. In the<br>
case of peptides or proteins having carbohydrate chains, biologically active variants marked<br>
by alterations in these carbohydrate species are also included within the invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "conservative amino acid substitution" refers to the general<br>
interchangeability of amino acid residues having similar side chains. For example, a<br>
commonly interchangeable group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is alanine,<br>
valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains<br>
is serine and threomine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is<br>
asparaGlne and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is<br>
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is<br>
lysine, arGlnine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side<br>
chains is cysteine and methionine. Examples of conservative substitutions include the<br>
substitution of a non-polar (hydrophobic) residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or<br>
methionine for another. Likewise, the present invention contemplates the substitution of a<br>
polar (hydrophilic) residue such as between arGlnine and lysine, between glutamine and<br>
asparaGlne, and between threonine and serine. Additionally, the substitution of a basic<br>
residue such as lysine, arGlnine or histidine for another or the substitution of an acidic residue<br>
such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid for another is also contemplated. Exemplary<br>
conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-<br>
tyrosine, lysine-arGlnine, alanine-valine, and asparaGlne-glutamine. By aligning a peptide or<br>
protein analog optimally with a corresponding native peptide or protein, and by using<br>
appropriate assays, e.g., adhesion protein or receptor binding assays, to determine a selected<br>
biological activity, one can readily identify operable peptide and protein analogs for use<br>
within the methods and compositions of the invention. Operable peptide and protein analogs<br>
are typically specifically immunoreactive with antibodies raised to the corresponding native<br>
peptide or protein.<br>
An approach for stabilizing solid protein formulations of the invention is to increase<br>
the physical stability of purified, e.g., lyophilized, protein. This will inhibit aggregation via<br>
hydrophobic interactions as well as via covalent pathways that may increase as proteins<br>
unfold. Stabilizing formulations in this context often include polymer-based formulations,<br>
for example a biodegradable hydrogel formulation/delivery system. As noted above, the<br>
critical role of water in protein structure, function, and stability is well known. Typically,<br>
proteins are relatively stable in the solid state with bulk water removed. However, solid<br>
therapeutic protein formulations may become hydrated upon storage at elevated humidities or<br>
during delivery from a sustained release composition or device. The stability of proteins<br>
generally drops with increasing hydration. Water can also play a significant role in solid<br>
protein aggregation, for example, by increasing protein flexibility resulting in enhanced<br>
accessibility of reactive groups, by providing a mobile phase for reactants, and by serving as<br>
a reactant in several deleterious processes such as beta-elimination and hydrolysis.<br>
Protein preparations containing between about 6% to 28% water are the most<br>
unstable. Below this level, the mobility of bound water and protein internal motions are low.<br>
Above this level, water mobility and protein motions approach those of full hydration. Up to<br>
a point, increased susceptibility toward solid-phase aggregation with increasing hydration has<br>
been observed in several systems. However, at higher water content, less aggregation is<br>
observed because of the dilution effect.<br>
In accordance with these principles, an effective method for stabilizing peptides and<br>
proteins against solid-state aggregation for mucosal delivery is to control the water content in<br>
a solid formulation and maintain the water activity in the formulation at optimal levels. This<br>
level depends on the nature of the protein, but in general, proteins maintained below their<br>
"monolayer" water coverage will exhibit superior solid-state stability.<br>
A variety of additives, diluents, bases and delivery vehicles are provided within the<br>
invention that effectively control water content to enhance protein stability. These reagents<br>
and carrier materials effective as anti-aggregation agents in this sense include, for example,<br>
polymers of various functionalities, such as polyethylene glycol, dextran, diethylaminoethyl<br>
dextran, and carboxymethyl cellulose, which significantly increase the stability and reduce<br>
the solid-phase aggregation of peptides and proteins admixed therewith or linked thereto. In<br>
some instances, the activity or physical stability of proteins can also be enhanced by various<br>
additives to aqueous solutions of the peptide or protein drugs. For example, additives, such<br>
as polyols (including sugars), amino acids, proteins such as collagen and gelatin, and various<br>
salts may be used.<br>
Certain additives, in particular sugars and other polyols, also impart significant<br>
physical stability to dry, e.g., lyophilized proteins. These additives can also be used within<br>
the invention to protect the proteins against aggregation not only during lyophilization but<br>
also during storage in the dry state. For example sucrose and Ficoll 70 (a polymer with<br>
sucrose units) exhibit significant protection against peptide or protein aggregation during<br>
solid-phase incubation under various conditions. These additives may also enhance the<br>
stability of solid proteins embedded within polymer matrices.<br>
Yet additional additives, for example sucrose, stabilize proteins against solid-state<br>
aggregation in humid atmospheres at elevated temperatures, as may occur in certain<br>
sustained-release formulations of the invention. Proteins such as gelatin and collagen also<br>
serve as stabilizing or bulking agents to reduce denaturation and aggregation of unstable<br>
proteins in this context. These additives can be incorporated into polymeric melt processes<br>
and compositions within the invention. For example, polypeptide microparticles can be<br>
prepared by simply lyophilizing or spray drying a solution containing various stabilizing<br>
additives described above. Sustained release of unaggregated peptides and proteins can<br>
thereby be obtained over an extended period of time.<br>
Various additional preparative components and methods, as well as specific<br>
formulation additives, are provided herein which yield formulations for mucosal delivery of<br>
aggregation-prone peptides and proteins, wherein the peptide or protein is stabilized in a<br>
substantially pure, unaggregated form using a solubilization agent. A range of components<br>
and additives are contemplated for use within these methods and formulations. Exemplary of<br>
these solubilization agents are linked dimers of cyclodextrins (CDs), which selectively bind<br>
hydrophobic side chains of polypeptides. These CD dimers have been found to bind to<br>
hydrophobic patches of proteins in a manner that significantly inhibits aggregation. . This<br>
inhibition is selective with respect to both the CD dimer and the protein involved. Such<br>
selective inhibition of protein aggregation provides additional advantages within the<br>
intranasal delivery methods and compositions of the invention. Additional agents for use in<br>
this context include CD timers and tetramers with varying geometries controlled by the<br>
linkers that specifically block aggregation of peptides and protein. Yet solubilization agents<br>
and methods for incorporation within the invention involve the use of peptides and peptide<br>
mimetics to selectively block protein-protein interactions. In one aspect, the specific binding<br>
of hydrophobic side chains reported for CD multimers is extended to proteins via the use of<br>
peptides and peptide mimetics that similarly block protein aggregation. A wide range of<br>
suitable methods and anti-aggregation agents are available for incorporation within the<br>
compositions and procedures of the invention.<br>
Charge Modifying and pH Control Agents and Methods<br>
To improve the transport characteristics of biologically active agents (including Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide, other active peptides and proteins, and macromolecular and small<br>
molecule drugs) for enhanced delivery across hydrophobic mucosal membrane barriers, the<br>
invention also provides techniques and reagents for charge modification of selected<br>
biologically active agents or delivery-enhancing agents described herein. In this regard, the<br>
relative permeabilities of macromolecules is generally be related to their partition<br>
coefficients. The degree of ionization of molecules, which is dependent on the pKa of the<br>
molecule and the pH at the mucosal membrane surface, also affects permeability of the<br>
molecules. Permeation and partitioning of biologically active agents, including Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide and analogs of the invention, for mucosal delivery may be facilitated by<br>
charge alteration or charge spreading of the active agent or permeabilizing agent, which is<br>
achieved, for example, by alteration of charged functional groups, by modifying the pH of the<br>
delivery vehicle or solution in which the active agent is delivered, or by coordinate<br>
administration of a charge- or pH-altering reagent with the active agent.<br>
Consistent with these general teachings, mucosal delivery of charged macromolecular<br>
species, including Y2 receptor-binding peptide and other biologically active peptides and<br>
proteins, within the methods and compositions of the invention is substantially improved<br>
when the active agent is delivered to the mucosal surface in a substantially un-ionized, or<br>
neutral, electrical charge state.<br>
Certain Y2 receptor-binding peptide and other biologically active peptide and protein<br>
components of mucosal formulations for use within the invention will be charge modified to<br>
yield an increase in the positive charge density of the peptide or protein. These modifications<br>
extend also to cationization of peptide and protein conjugates, carriers and other delivery<br>
forms disclosed herein. Cationization offers a convenient means of altering the<br>
biodistribution and transport properties of proteins and macromolecules within the invention.<br>
Cationization is undertaken in a manner that substantially preserves the biological activity of<br>
the active agent and limits potentially adverse side effects, including tissue damage and<br>
toxicity.<br>
Degradative Enzyme Inhibitory Agents and Methods<br>
Another excipient that may be included in a trans-mucosal preparation is a<br>
degradative enzyme inhibitor. Exemplary mucoadhesive polymer-enzyme inhibitor<br>
complexes that are useful within the mucosal delivery formulations and methods of the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to: Carboxymethylcellulose-pepstatin (with anti-pepsin<br>
activity); Poly(acrylic acid)-Bowman-Birk inhibitor (anti-chymotrypsin); Poly(acrylic acid)-<br>
chymostatin (anti-chymotrypsin); Poly(acrylic acid)-elastatinal (anti-elastase);<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose-elastatinal (anti-elastase); Polycarbophil—elastatinal (anti-elastase);<br>
Chitosan—antipain (anti-trypsin); Poly(acrylic acid)—bacitracin (anti-aminopeptidase N);<br>
Chitosan—EDTA (anti-aminopeptidase N, anti-carboxypeptidase A); Chitosan—EDTA—<br>
antipain (anti-trypsin, anti-chymotrypsin, anti-elastase). As described in further detail below,<br>
certain embodiments of the invention will optionally incorporate a novel chitosan derivative<br>
or chemically modified form of chitosan. One such novel derivative for use within the<br>
invention is denoted as a P-[l?4]-2-guanidino-2-deoxy-D-glucose polymer (poly-GuD).<br>
Any inhibitor that inhibits the activity of an enzyme to protect the biologically active<br>
agent(s) may be usefully employed in the compositions and methods of the invention. Useful<br>
enzyme inhibitors for the protection of biologically active proteins and peptides include, for<br>
example, soybean trypsin inhibitor, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, chymotrypsin inhibitor and<br>
trypsin and chrymotrypsin inhibitor isolated from potato (solanum tuberosum L.) tubers. A<br>
combination or mixtures of inhibitors may be employed. Additional inhibitors of proteolytic<br>
enzymes for use within the invention include ovomucoid-enzyme, gabaxate mesylate, alpha1-<br>
antitrypsin, aprotinin, amastatin, bestatin, puromycin, bacitracin, leupepsin, alpha2-<br>
macroglobulin, pepstatin and egg white or soybean trypsin inhibitor. These and other<br>
inhibitors can be used alone or in combination. The inhibitor(s) may be incorporated in or<br>
bound to a carrier, e.g., a hydrophilic polymer, coated on the surface of the dosage form<br>
which is to contact the nasal mucosa, or incorporated in the superficial phase of the surface,<br>
in combination with the biologically active agent or in a separately administered (e.g., pre-<br>
administered) formulation.<br>
The amount of the inhibitor, e.g., of a proteolytic enzyme inhibitor that is optionally<br>
incorporated in the compositions of the invention will vary depending on (a) the properties of<br>
the specific inhibitor, (b) the number of functional groups present in the molecule (which<br>
may be reacted to introduce ethylenic unsaturation necessary for copolymerization with<br>
hydrogel forming monomers), and (c) the number of lectin groups, such as glycosides, which<br>
are present in the inhibitor molecule. It may also depend on the specific therapeutic agent<br>
that is intended to be administered. Generally speaking, a useful amount of an enzyme<br>
inhibitor is from about 0.1 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml, often from about 0.2 mg/ml to about 25<br>
mg/ml, and more commonly from about 0.5 mg/ml to 5 mg/ml of the of the formulation (i.e.,<br>
a separate protease inhibitor formulation or combined formulation with the inhibitor and<br>
biologically active agent).<br>
In the case of trypsin inhibition, suitable inhibitors may be selected from, e.g.,<br>
aprotinin, BBI, soybean trypsin inhibitor, chicken ovomucoid, chicken ovoinhibitor, human<br>
pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, camostat mesilate, flavonoid inhibitors, antipain, leupeptin , p-<br>
aminobenzamidine, AEBSF, TLCK (tosyllysine chloromethylketone), APMSF, DFP, PMSF,<br>
and poly(acrylate) derivatives. In the case of chymotrypsin inhibition, suitable inhibitors may<br>
be selected from, e.g., aprotinin, BBI, soybean trypsin inhibitor, chymostatin,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Phe-CHO, FK-448, chicken ovoinhibitor, sugar biphenylboronic<br>
acids complexes, DFP, PMSF, P-phenylpropionate, and poly(acrylate) derivatives. In the<br>
case of elastase inhibition, suitable inhibitors may be selected from, e.g., elastatinal,<br>
methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (MPCMK), BBI, soybean trypsin<br>
inhibitor, chicken ovoinhibitor, DFP, and PMSF.<br>
Additional enzyme inhibitors for use within the invention are selected from a wide<br>
range of non-protein inhibitors that vary in their degree of potency and toxicity. As described<br>
in further detail below, immobilization of these adjunct agents to matrices or other delivery<br>
vehicles, or development of chemically modified analogues, may be readily implemented to<br>
reduce or even eliminate toxic effects, when they are encountered. Among this broad group<br>
of candidate enzyme inhibitors for use within the invention are organophosphorous inhibitors,<br>
such as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), which<br>
are potent, irreversible inhibitors of serine proteases (e.g., trypsin and chymotrypsin). The<br>
additional inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by these compounds makes them highly toxic in<br>
uncontrolled delivery settings. Another candidate inhibitor, 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-<br>
benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), has an inhibitory activity comparable to DFP and PMSF,<br>
but it is markedly less toxic. (4-Aminophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride<br>
(APMSF) is another potent inhibitor of trypsin, but is toxic in uncontrolled settings, In<br>
contrast to these inhibitors, 4-(4-isopropylpiperadinocarbonyl)phenyl 1, 2,3,4,-tetrahydro-l-<br>
naphthoate methanesulphonate (FK-448) is a low toxic substance, representing a potent and<br>
specific inhibitor of chymotrypsin. Further representatives of this non-protein group of<br>
inhibitor candidates, and also exhibiting low toxic risk, are camostat mesilate (N,N'-dimethyl<br>
carbamoylmethyl-ß-(p '-guanidino-benzoyloxy)phenylacetate methane-sulphonate).<br>
Yet another type of enzyme inhibitory agent for use within the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention are amino acids and modified amino acids that interfere with<br>
enzymatic degradation of specific therapeutic compounds. For use in this context, amino<br>
acids and modified amino acids are substantially non-toxic and can be produced at a low cost.<br>
However, due to their low molecular size and good solubility, they are readily diluted and<br>
absorbed in mucosal environments. Nevertheless, under proper conditions, amino acids can<br>
act as reversible, competitive inhibitors of protease enzymes. Certain modified amino acids<br>
can display a much stronger inhibitory activity. A desired modified amino acid in this<br>
context is known as a 'transition-state' inhibitor. The strong inhibitory activity of these<br>
compounds is based on their structural similarity to a substrate in its transition-state<br>
geometry, while they are generally selected to have a much higher affinity for the active site<br>
of an enzyme than the substrate itself. Transition-state inhibitors are reversible, competitive<br>
inhibitors. Examples of this type of inhibitor are a-aminoboronic acid derivatives, such as<br>
boro-leucine, boro-valine and boro-alanine. The boron atom in these derivatives can form a<br>
tetrahedral boronate ion that is believed to resemble the transition state of peptides during<br>
their hydrolysis by aminopeptidases. These amino acid derivatives are potent and reversible<br>
inhibitors of aminopeptidases and it is reported that boro-leucine is more than 100-times<br>
more effective in enzyme inhibition than bestatin and more than 1000-times more effective<br>
than puromycin. Another modified amino acid for which a strong protease inhibitory activity<br>
has been reported is N-acetylcysteine, which inhibits enzymatic activity of aminopeptidase N.<br>
This adjunct agent also displays mucolytic properties that can be employed within the<br>
methods and compositions of the invention to reduce the effects of the mucus diffusion<br>
barrier.<br>
Still other useful enzyme inhibitors for use within the coordinate administration<br>
methods and combinatorial formulations of the invention may be selected from peptides and<br>
modified peptide enzyme inhibitors. An important representative of this class of inhibitors is<br>
the cyclic dodecapeptide, bacitracin, obtained from Bacillus licheniformis. In addition to<br>
these types of peptides, certain dipeptides and tripeptides display weak, non-specific<br>
inhibitory activity towards some protease. By analogy with amino acids, their inhibitory<br>
activity can be improved by chemical modifications. For example, phosphinic acid dipeptide<br>
analogues are also 'transition-state' inhibitors with a strong inhibitory activity towards<br>
aminopeptidases. They have reportedly been used to stabilize nasally administered leucine<br>
enkephalin. Another example of a transition-state analogue is the modified pentapeptide<br>
pepstatin, which is a very potent inhibitor of pepsin. Structural analysis of pepstatin, by<br>
testing the inhibitory activity of several synthetic analogues, demonstrated the major<br>
structure-function characteristics of the molecule responsible for the inhibitory activity.<br>
Another special type of modified peptide includes inhibitors with a terminally located<br>
aldehyde function in their structure. For example, the sequence benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Phe-<br>
CHO, which fulfills the known primary and secondary specificity requirements of<br>
chymotrypsin, has been found to be a potent reversible inhibitor of this target proteinase. The<br>
chemical structures of further inhibitors with a terminally located aldehyde function, e.g.<br>
antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin and elastatinal, are also known in the art, as are the structures<br>
of other known, reversible, modified peptide inhibitors, such as phosphoramidon, bestatin,<br>
puromycin and amastatin.<br>
Due to their comparably high molecular mass, polypeptide protease inhibitors are<br>
more amenable than smaller compounds to concentrated delivery in a drug-carrier matrix.<br>
Additional agents for protease inhibition within the formulations and methods of the<br>
invention involve the use of complexing agents. These agents mediate enzyme inhibition by<br>
depriving the intranasal environment (or preparative or therapeutic composition) of divalent<br>
cations which are co-factors for many proteases. For instance, the complexing agents EDTA<br>
and DTPA as coordinately administered or combinatorially formulated adjunct agents, in<br>
suitable concentration, will be sufficient to inhibit selected proteases to thereby enhance<br>
intranasal delivery of biologically active agents according to the invention. Further<br>
representatives of this class of inhibitory agents are EGTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and<br>
hydroxychinoline. In addition, due to their propensity to chelate divalent cations, these and<br>
other complexing agents are useful within the invention as direct, absorption-promoting<br>
agents.<br>
As noted in more detail elsewhere herein, it is also contemplated to use various<br>
polymers, particularly mucoadhesive polymers, as enzyme inhibiting agents within the<br>
coordinate administration, multi-processing and/or combinatorial formulation methods and<br>
compositions of the invention. For example, poly(acrylate) derivatives, such as poly(acrylic<br>
acid) and polycarbophil, can affect the activity of various proteases, including trypsin,<br>
chymotrypsin. The inhibitory effect of these polymers may also be based on the<br>
complexation of divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Zn2+. It is further contemplated that these<br>
polymers may serve as conjugate partners or carriers for additional enzyme inhibitory agents,<br>
as described above. For example, a chitosan-EDTA conjugate has been developed and is<br>
useful within the invention that exhibits a strong inhibitory effect towards the enzymatic<br>
activity of zinc-dependent proteases. The mucoadhesive properties of polymers following<br>
covalent attachment of other enzyme inhibitors in this context are not expected to be<br>
substantially compromised, nor is the general utility of such polymers as a delivery vehicle<br>
for biologically active agents within the invention expected to be diminished. On the<br>
contrary, the reduced distance between the delivery vehicle and mucosal surface afforded by<br>
the mucoadhesive mechanism will minimize presystemic metabolism of the active agent,<br>
while the covalently bound enzyme inhibitors remain concentrated at the site of drug<br>
delivery, minimizing undesired dilution effects of inhibitors as well as toxic and other side<br>
effects caused thereby. In this manner, the effective amount of a coordinately administered<br>
enzyme inhibitor can be reduced due to the exclusion of dilution effects.<br>
Exemplary mucoadhesive polymer-enzyme inhibitor complexes that are useful within<br>
the mucosal formulations and methods of the invention include, but are not limited to:<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose-pepstatin (with anti-pepsin activity); Poly(acrylic acid)-Bowman-<br>
Birk inhibitor (anti-chymotrypsin); Poly(acrylic acid)-chymostatin (anti-chymotrypsin);<br>
Poly(acrylic acid)-elastatinal (anti-elastase); Carboxymethylcellulose-elastatinal (anti-<br>
elastase); Polycarbophil—elastatinal (anti-elastase); Chitosan—antipain (anti-trypsin);<br>
Poly(acrylic acid)—bacitracin (anti-aminopeptidase N); Chitosan—EDTA (anti-<br>
aminopeptidase N, anti-carboxypeptidase A); Chitosan—EDTA—antipain (anti-trypsin, anti-<br>
chymotrypsin, anti-elastase).<br>
Mucolytic and Mucus-Clearing Agents and Methods<br>
Effective delivery of biotherapeutic agents via intranasal administration must take into<br>
account the decreased drug transport rate across the protective mucus lining of the nasal<br>
mucosa, in addition to drug loss due to binding to glycoproteins of the mucus layer. Normal<br>
mucus is a viscoelastic, gel-like substance consisting of water, electrolytes, mucins,<br>
macromolecules, and sloughed epithelial cells. It serves primarily as a cytoprotective and<br>
lubricative covering for the underlying mucosal tissues. Mucus is secreted by randomly<br>
distributed secretory cells located in the nasal epithelium and in other mucosal epithelia. The<br>
structural unit of mucus is mucin. This glycoprotein is mainly responsible for the viscoelastic<br>
nature of mucus, although other macromolecules may also contribute to this property. In<br>
airway mucus, such macromolecules include locally produced secretory IgA, IgM, IgE,<br>
lysozyme, and bronchotransferrin, which also play an important role in host defense<br>
mechanisms.<br>
The coordinate administration methods of the instant invention optionally incorporate<br>
effective mucolytic or mucus-clearing agents, which serve to degrade, thin or clear mucus<br>
from intranasal mucosal surfaces to facilitate absorption of intranasally administered<br>
biotherapeutic agents. Within these methods, a mucolytic or mucus-clearing agent is<br>
coordinately administered as an adjunct compound to enhance intranasal delivery of the<br>
biologically active agent. Alternatively, an effective amount of a mucolytic or mucus-<br>
clearing agent is incorporated as a processing agent within a multi-processing method of the<br>
invention, or as an additive within a combinatorial formulation of the invention, to provide an<br>
improved formulation that enhances intranasal delivery of biotherapeutic compounds by<br>
reducing the barrier effects of intranasal mucus.<br>
A variety of mucolytic or mucus-clearing agents are available for incorporation within<br>
the methods and compositions of the invention. Based on their mechanisms of action,<br>
mucolytic and mucus clearing agents can often be classified into the following groups:<br>
proteases (e.g., pronase, papain) that cleave the protein core of mucin glycoproteins;<br>
sulfhydryl compounds that split mucoprotein disulfide linkages; and detergents (e.g., Triton<br>
X-100, Tween 20) that break non-covalent bonds within the mucus. Additional compounds in<br>
this context include, but are not limited to, bile salts and surfactants, for example, sodium<br>
deoxycholate, sodium taurodeoxycholate, sodium glycocholate, and lysophosphatidylcholine.<br>
The effectiveness of bile salts in causing structural breakdown of mucus is in the<br>
order deoxycholate &gt; taurocholate &gt; glycocholate. Other effective agents that reduce mucus<br>
viscosity or adhesion to enhance intranasal delivery according to the methods of the invention<br>
include, e.g., short-chain fatty acids, and mucolytic agents that work by chelation, such as N-<br>
acylcollagen peptides, bile acids, and saponins (the latter function in part by chelating Ca2+<br>
and/or Mg2+ which play an important role in maintaining mucus layer structure).<br>
Additional mucolytic agents for use within the methods and compositions of the<br>
invention include N-acetyl-L-cysteine (ACS), a potent mucolytic agent that reduces both the<br>
viscosity and adherence of bronchopulmonary mucus and is reported to modestly increase<br>
nasal bioavailability of human growth hormone in anesthetized rats (from 7.5 to 12.2%).<br>
These and other mucolytic or mucus-clearing agents are contacted with the nasal mucosa,<br>
typically in a concentration range of about 0.2 to 20 raM, coordinately with administration of<br>
the biologically active agent, to reduce the polar viscosity and/or elasticity of intranasal<br>
mucus.<br>
Still other mucolytic or mucus-clearing agents may be selected from a range of<br>
glycosidase enzymes, which are able to cleave glycosidic bonds within the mucus<br>
glycoprotein. a-amylase and ß-amylase are representative of this class of enzymes, although<br>
their mucolytic effect may be limited. In contrast, bacterial glycosidases which allow these<br>
microorganisms to permeate mucus layers of their hosts.<br>
For combinatorial use with most biologically active agents within the invention,<br>
including peptide and protein therapeutics, non-ionogenic detergents are generally also useful<br>
as mucolytic or mucus-clearing agents. These agents typically will not modify or<br>
substantially impair the activity of therapeutic polypeptides.<br>
Ciliostatic Agents and Methods<br>
Because the self-cleaning capacity of certain mucosal tissues (e.g., nasal mucosal<br>
tissues) by mucociliary clearance is necessary as a protective function (e.g., to remove dust,<br>
allergens, and bacteria), it has been generally considered that this function should not be<br>
substantially impaired by mucosal medications. Mucociliary transport in the respiratory tract<br>
is a particularly important defense mechanism against infections. To achieve this function,<br>
ciliary beating in the nasal and airway passages moves a layer of mucus along the mucosa to<br>
removing inhaled particles and microorganisms.<br>
Ciliostatic agents find use within the methods and compositions of the invention to<br>
increase the residence time of mucosallv (e.g., intranasally) administered Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed herein. In<br>
particular, the delivery these agents within the methods and compositions of the invention is<br>
significantly enhanced in certain aspects by the coordinate administration or combinatorial<br>
formulation of one or more ciliostatic agents that function to reversibly inhibit ciliary activity<br>
of mucosal cells, to provide for a temporary, reversible increase in the residence time of the<br>
mucosally administered active agent(s). For use within these aspects of the invention, the<br>
foregoing ciliostatic factors, either specific or indirect in their activity, are all candidates for<br>
successful employment as ciliostatic agents in appropriate amounts (depending on<br>
concentration, duration and mode of delivery) such that they yield a transient (i.e., reversible)<br>
reduction or cessation of mucociliary clearance at a mucosal site of administration to enhance<br>
delivery of Y2 receptor-binding peptide, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active<br>
agents disclosed herein, without unacceptable adverse side effects.<br>
Within more detailed aspects, a specific ciliostatic factor is employed in a combined<br>
formulation or coordinate administration protocol with one or more Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and/or other biologically active agents disclosed<br>
herein. Various bacterial ciliostatic factors isolated and characterized in the literature may be<br>
employed within these embodiments of the invention. Ciliostatic factors from the bacterium<br>
Pseudomonas aeruGlnosa include a phenazine derivative, a pyo compound (2-alkyl-4-<br>
hydroxyquinolines), and a rhamnolipid (also known as a hemolysin). The pyo compound<br>
produced ciliostasis at concentrations of 50 µg/ml and without obvious ultrastructural lesions.<br>
The phenazine derivative also inhibited ciliary motility but caused some membrane<br>
disruption, although at substantially greater concentrations of 400 µg/ml. Limited exposure<br>
of tracheal explants to the rhamnolipid resulted in ciliostasis, which was associated with<br>
altered ciliary membranes. More extensive exposure to rhamnolipid was associated with<br>
removal of dynein arms from axonemes.<br>
Surface Active Agents and Methods<br>
Within more detailed aspects of the invention, one or more membrane penetration-<br>
enhancing agents may be employed within a mucosal delivery method or formulation of the<br>
invention to enhance mucosal delivery of Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and<br>
mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed herein. Membrane penetration<br>
enhancing agents in this context can be selected from: (i) a surfactant, (ii) a bile salt, (ii) a<br>
phospholipid additive, mixed micelle, liposome, or carrier, (iii) an alcohol, (iv) an enamine,<br>
(v) an NO donor compound, (vi) a long-chain amphipathic molecule (vii) a small<br>
hydrophobic penetration enhancer; (viii) sodium or a salicylic acid derivative; (ix) a glycerol<br>
ester of acetoacetic acid (x) a clyclodextrin or beta-cyclodextrin derivative, (xi) a medium-<br>
chain fatty acid, (xii) a chelating agent, (xiii) an amino acid or salt thereof, (xiv) an N-<br>
acetylamino acid or salt thereof, (xv) an enzyme degradative to a selected membrane<br>
component, (ix) an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, or (x) an inhibitor of cholesterol<br>
synthesis; or (xi) any combination of the membrane penetration enhancing agents recited in<br>
(i)-(x).<br>
Certain surface-active agents are readily incorporated within the mucosal delivery<br>
formulations and methods of the invention as mucosal absorption enhancing agents. These<br>
agents, which may be coordinately administered or combinatorially formulated with Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents<br>
disclosed herein, may be selected from a broad assemblage of known surfactants.<br>
Surfactants, which generally fall into three classes: (1) nonionic polyoxyethylene ethers; (2)<br>
bile salts such as sodium glycocholate (SGC) and deoxycholate (DOC); and (3) derivatives of<br>
fusidic acid such as sodium taurodihydrofusidate (STDHF). The mechanisms of action of<br>
these various classes of surface active agents typically include solubilization of the<br>
biologically active agent. For proteins and peptides which often form aggregates, the surface<br>
active properties of these absorption promoters can allow interactions with proteins such that<br>
smaller units such as surfactant coated monomers may be more readily maintained in<br>
solution. Examples of other surface-active agents are L-a-Phospharidycholine Didecanoyl<br>
(DDPC) polysorbate 80 and polysorbate 20.These monomers are presumably more<br>
transportable units than aggregates. A second potential mechanism is the protection of the<br>
peptide or protein from proteolytic degradation by proteases in the mucosal environment.<br>
Both bile salts and some fusidic acid derivatives reportedly inhibit proteolytic degradation of<br>
proteins by nasal homogenates at concentrations less than or equivalent to those required to<br>
enhance protein absorption. This protease inhibition may be especially important for<br>
peptides with short biological half-lives.<br>
Degradation Enzymes and Inhibitors of Fatty Acid and Cholesterol Synthesis<br>
In related aspects of the invention, Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and<br>
mimetics, and other biologically active agents for mucosal administration are formulated or<br>
coordinately administered with a penetration enhancing agent selected from a degradation<br>
enzyme, or a metabolic stimulatory agent or inhibitor of synthesis of fatty acids, sterols or<br>
other selected epithelial barrier components, U.S. Patent No. 6,190,894. For example,<br>
degradative enzymes such as phospholipase, hyaluronidase, neuraminidase, and<br>
chondroitinase may be employed to enhance mucosal penetration of Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agent without causing<br>
irreversible damage to the mucosal barrier. In one embodiment, chondroitinase is employed<br>
within a method or composition as provided herein to alter glycoprotein or glycolipid<br>
constituents of the permeability barrier of the mucosa, thereby enhancing mucosal absorption<br>
of Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active<br>
agents disclosed herein.<br>
With regard to inhibitors of synthesis of mucosal barrier constituents, it is noted that<br>
free fatty acids account for 20-25% of epithelial lipids by weight. Two rate-limiting enzymes<br>
in the biosynthesis of free fatty acids are acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase.<br>
Through a series of steps, free fatty acids are metabolized into phospholipids. Thus,<br>
inhibitors of free fatty acid synthesis and metabolism for use within the methods and<br>
compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, inhibitors of acetyl CoA<br>
carboxylase such as 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA); inhibitors of fatty acid<br>
synthetase; inhibitors of phospholipase A such as gomisin A, 2-(p-amylcinnamyl)amino-4-<br>
chlorobenzoic acid, bromophenacyl bromide, monoalide, 7,7-dimethyl-5,8-eicosadienoic<br>
acid, nicergoline, cepharanthine, nicardipine, quercetin, dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, R-24571, N-<br>
oleoylethanolamine, N-(7-nitro-2,l,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) phosphostidyl serine, cyclosporine<br>
A, topical anesthetics, including dibucaine, prenylamine, retinoids, such as all-trans and 13-<br>
cis-retinoic acid, W-7, trifluoperazine, R-24571 (calmidazolium), l-hexadocyl-3-<br>
trifluoroethyl glycero-sn-2-phosphomenthol (MJ33); calcium channel blockers including<br>
nicardipine, verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, and nimodipine; antimalarials including<br>
quinacrine, mepacrine, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; beta blockers including<br>
propanalol and labetalol; calmodulin antagonists; EGTA; thimersol; glucocorticosteroids<br>
including dexamethasone and prednisolone; and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents<br>
including indomethacin and naproxen.<br>
Free sterols, primarily cholesterol, account for 20-25% of the epithelial lipids by<br>
weight. The rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol is 3-hydroxy-3-<br>
methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase. Inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis for use within the<br>
methods and compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, competitive<br>
inhibitors of (HMG) CoA reductase, such as simvastatin, lovastatin, fluindostatin<br>
(fluvastatin), pravastatin, mevastatin, as well as other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, such as<br>
cholesterol oleate, cholesterol sulfate and phosphate, and oxygenated sterols, such as 25-OH--<br>
and 26-OH-- cholesterol; inhibitors of squalene synthetase; inhibitors of squalene epoxidase;<br>
inhibitors of DELTA7 or DELTA24 reductases such as 22,25-diazacholesterol, 20,25-<br>
diazacholestenol, AY9944, and triparanol.<br>
Each of the inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis or the sterol synthesis inhibitors may be<br>
coordinately administered or combinatorially formulated with one or more Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed<br>
herein to achieve enhanced epithelial penetration of the active agent(s). An effective<br>
concentration range for the sterol inhibitor in a therapeutic or adjunct formulation for<br>
mucosal delivery is generally from about 0.0001% to about 20% by weight of the total, more<br>
typically from about 0.01% to about 5%.<br>
Nitric Oxide Donor Agents and Methods<br>
Within other related aspects of the invention, a nitric oxide (NO) donor is selected as<br>
a membrane penetration-enhancing agent to enhance mucosal delivery of one or more Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents<br>
disclosed herein. Various NO donors are known in the art and are useful in effective<br>
concentrations within the methods and formulations of the invention. Exemplary NO donors<br>
include, but are not limited to, nitroglycerine, nitropruside, NOC5 [3-(2-hydroxy-l -(methyl-<br>
ethyl)-2-nitrosohydrazino)-1-propanamine], NOC12 [N-ethyl-2-(1-ethyl-hydroxy-2-<br>
nitrosohydrazino)-ethanamine], SNAP [S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine], NORI and<br>
NOR4. Within the methods and compositions of the invention, an effective amount of a<br>
selected NO donor is coordinately administered or combinatorially formulated with one or<br>
more Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and/or other biologically<br>
active agents disclosed herein, into or through the mucosal epithelium.<br>
Agents for Modulating Epithelial Junction Structure and/or Physiology<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical composition that contains one or more<br>
Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs or mimetics, and/or other biologically active<br>
agents in combination with mucosal delivery enhancing agents disclosed herein formulated in<br>
a pharmaceutical preparation for mucosal delivery.<br>
The permeabilizing agent reversibly enhances mucosal epithelial paracellular<br>
transport, typically by modulating epithelial junctional structure and/or physiology at a<br>
mucosal epithelial surface in the subject. This effect typically involves inhibition by the<br>
permeabilizing agent of homotypic or heterotypic binding between epithelial membrane<br>
adhesive proteins of neighboring epithelial cells. Target proteins for this blockade of<br>
homotypic or heterotypic binding can be selected from various related junctional adhesion<br>
molecules (JAMs), occludins, or claudins.<br>
In yet additional detailed embodiments, the invention provides permeabilizing<br>
peptides and peptide analogs and mimetics for enhancing mucosal epithelial paracellular<br>
transport. The subject peptides and peptide analogs and mimetics typically work within the<br>
compositions and methods of the invention by modulating epithelial junctional structure<br>
and/or physiology in a mammalian subject. In certain embodiments, the peptides and peptide<br>
analogs and mimetics effectively inhibit homotypic and/or heterotypic binding of an<br>
epithelial membrane adhesive protein selected from a junctional adhesion molecule (JAM),<br>
occludin, or claudin.<br>
One such agent that has been extensively studied is the bacterial toxin from Vibrio<br>
cholerae known as the "zonula occludens toxin" (ZOT). This toxin mediates increased<br>
intestinal mucosal permeability and causes disease symptoms including diarrhea in infected<br>
subjects. Fasano et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 8:5242-5246 (1991). When tested on<br>
rabbit ileal mucosa, ZOT increased the intestinal permeability by modulating the structure of<br>
intercellular tight junctions. More recently, it has been found that ZOT is capable of<br>
reversibly opening tight junctions in the intestinal mucosa. It has also been reported that<br>
ZOT is capable of reversibly opening tight junctions in the nasal mucosa. U.S. Pat No.<br>
5,908,825.<br>
Within the methods and compositions of the invention, ZOT, as well as various<br>
analogs and mimetics of ZOT that function as agonists or antagonists of ZOT activity, are<br>
useful for enhancing intranasal delivery of biologically active agents—by increasing<br>
paracellular absorption into and across the nasal mucosa. In this context, ZOT typically acts<br>
by causing a structural reorganization of tight junctions marked by altered localization of the<br>
junctional protein ZO1. Within these aspects of the invention, ZOT is coordinately<br>
administered or combinatorially formulated with the biologically active agent in an effective<br>
amount to yield significantly enhanced absorption of the active agent, by reversibly<br>
increasing nasal mucosal permeability without substantial adverse side effects<br>
Vasodilator Agents and Methods<br>
Yet another class of absorption-promoting agents that shows beneficial utility within<br>
the coordinate administration and combinatorial formulation methods and compositions of<br>
the invention are vasoactive compounds, more specifically vasodilators. These compounds<br>
function within the invention to modulate the structure and physiology of the submucosal<br>
vasculature, increasing the transport rate of Y2 receptor-binding peptide, analogs and<br>
mimetics, and other biologically active agents into or through the mucosal epithelium and/or<br>
to specific target tissues or compartments (e.g., the systemic circulation or central nervous<br>
system.).<br>
Vasodilator agents for use within the invention typically cause submucosal blood<br>
vessel relaxation by either a decrease in cytoplasmic calcium, an increase in nitric oxide (NO)<br>
or by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase. They are generally divided into 9 classes: calcium<br>
antagonists, potassium channel openers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists,<br>
a-adrenergic and imidazole receptor antagonists, b1 -adrenergic agonists, phosphodiesterase<br>
inhibitors, eicosanoids and NO donors.<br>
Despite chemical differences, the pharmacokinetic properties of calcium antagonists<br>
are similar. Absorption into the systemic circulation is high, and these agents therefore<br>
undergo considerable first-pass metabolism by the liver, resulting in individual variation in<br>
pharmacokinetics. Except for the newer drugs of the dihydropyridine type (amlodipine,<br>
felodipine, isradipine, nilvadipine, nisoldipine and nitrendipine), the half-life of calcium<br>
antagonists is short. Therefore, to maintain an effective drug concentration for many of these<br>
may require delivery by multiple dosing, or controlled release formulations, as described<br>
elsewhere herein. Treatment with the potassium channel opener minoxidil may also be<br>
limited in manner and level of administration due to potential adverse side effects.<br>
ACE inhibitors prevent conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, and are most<br>
effective when renin production is increased. Since ACE is identical to kininase-II, which<br>
inactivates the potent endogenous vasodilator bradykinin, ACE inhibition causes a reduction<br>
in bradykinin degradation. ACE inhibitors provide the added advantage of cardioprotective<br>
and cardioreparative effects, by preventing and reversing cardiac fibrosis and ventricular<br>
hypertrophy in animal models. The predominant elimination pathway of most ACE<br>
inhibitors is via renal excretion. Therefore, renal impairment is associated with reduced<br>
elimination and a dosage reduction of 25 to 50% is recommended in patients with moderate<br>
to severe renal impairment.<br>
With regard to NO donors, these compounds are particularly useful within the<br>
invention for their additional effects on mucosal permeability. In addition to the above-noted<br>
NO donors, complexes of NO with nucleophiles called NO/nucleophiles, or NONOates,<br>
spontaneously and nonenzymatically release NO when dissolved in aqueous solution at<br>
physiologic pH. . In contrast, nitro vasodilators such as nitroglycerin require specific<br>
enzyme activity for NO release. NONOates release NO with a defined stoichiometry and at<br>
predictable rates ranGlng from 
diethylenetriamine/NO (DETANO).<br>
Within certain methods and compositions of the invention, a selected vasodilator<br>
agent is coordinately administered (e.g., systemically or intranasally, simultaneously or in<br>
combinatorially effective temporal association) or combinatorially formulated with one or<br>
more Y2 receptor-binding peptide, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active<br>
agent(s) in an amount effective to enhance the mucosal absorption of the active agent(s) to<br>
reach a target tissue or compartment in the subject (e.g., the liver, hepatic portal vein, CNS<br>
tissue or fluid, or blood plasma).<br>
Selective Transport-Enhancing Agents and Methods<br>
The compositions and delivery methods of the invention optionally incorporate a<br>
selective transport-enhancing agent that facilitates transport of one or more biologically<br>
active agents. These transport-enhancing agents may be employed in a combinatorial<br>
formulation or coordinate administration protocol with one or more of the Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics disclosed herein, to coordinately enhance<br>
delivery of one or more additional biologically active agent(s) across mucosal transport<br>
barriers, to enhance mucosal delivery of the active agent(s) to reach a target tissue or<br>
compartment in the subject (e.g., the mucosal epithelium, liver, CNS tissue or fluid, or blood<br>
plasma). Alternatively, the transport-enhancing agents may be employed in a combinatorial<br>
formulation or coordinate administration protocol to directly enhance mucosal delivery of<br>
one or more of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, with or<br>
without enhanced delivery of an additional biologically active agent.<br>
Exemplary selective transport-enhancing agents for use within this aspect of the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, glycosides, sugar-containing molecules, and binding<br>
agents such as lectin binding agents, which are known to interact specifically with epithelial<br>
transport barrier components. For example, specific "bioadhesive" ligands, including various<br>
plant and bacterial lectins, which bind to cell surface sugar moieties by receptor-mediated<br>
interactions can be employed as carriers or conjugated transport mediators for enhancing<br>
mucosal, e.g., nasal delivery of biologically active agents within the invention. Certain<br>
bioadhesive ligands for use within the invention will mediate transmission of biological<br>
signals to epithelial target cells that trigger selective uptake of the adhesive ligand by<br>
specialized cellular transport processes (endocytosis or transcytosis). These transport<br>
mediators can therefore be employed as a "carrier system" to stimulate or direct selective<br>
uptake of one or more Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other<br>
biologically active agent(s) into and/or through mucosal epithelia. These and other selective<br>
transport-enhancing agents significantly enhance mucosal delivery of macromolecular<br>
biopharmaceuticals (particularly peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides and polynucleotide<br>
vectors) within the invention. Lectins are plant proteins that bind to specific sugars found on<br>
the surface of glycoproteins and glycolipids of eukaryotic cells. Concentrated solutions of<br>
lectins have a 'mucotractive' effect, and various studies have demonstrated rapid receptor<br>
mediated endocytocis (RME) of lectins and lectin conjugates (e.g., concanavalin A<br>
conjugated with colloidal gold particles) across mucosal surfaces. Additional studies have<br>
reported that the uptake mechanisms for lectins can be utilized for intestinal drug targeting in<br>
vivo. In certain of these studies, polystyrene nanoparticles (500 nm) were covalently coupled<br>
to tomato lectin and reported yielded improved systemic uptake after oral administration to<br>
rats.<br>
In addition to plant lectins, microbial adhesion and invasion factors provide a rich<br>
source of candidates for use as adhesive/selective transport carriers within the mucosal<br>
delivery methods and compositions of the invention. Two components are necessary for<br>
bacterial adherence processes, a bacterial 'adhesin' (adherence or colonization factor) and a<br>
receptor on the host cell surface. Bacteria causing mucosal infections need to penetrate the<br>
mucus layer before attaching themselves to the epithelial surface. This attachment is usually<br>
mediated by bacterial fimbriae or pilus structures, although other cell surface components<br>
may also take part in the process. Adherent bacteria colonize mucosal epithelia by<br>
multiplication and initiation of a series of biochemical reactions inside the target cell through<br>
signal transduction mechanisms (with or without the help of toxins). Associated with these<br>
invasive mechanisms, a wide diversity of bioadhesive proteins (e.g., invasin, internalin)<br>
oriGlnally produced by various bacteria and viruses are known. These allow for extracellular<br>
attachment of such microorganisms with an impressive selectivity for host species and even<br>
particular target tissues. Signals transmitted by such receptor-ligand interactions trigger the<br>
transport of intact, living microorganisms into, and eventually through, epithelial cells by<br>
endo- and transcytotic processes. Such naturally occurring phenomena may be harnessed<br>
(e.g., by complexing biologically active agents such as Y2 receptor-binding peptide with an<br>
adhesin) according to the teachings herein for enhanced delivery of biologically active<br>
compounds into or across mucosal epithelia and/or to other designated target sites of drug<br>
action.<br>
Various bacterial and plant toxins that bind epithelial surfaces in a specific, lectin-like<br>
manner are also useful within the methods and compositions of the invention. For example,<br>
diptheria toxin (DT) enters host cells rapidly by RME. Likewise, the B subunit of the E. coli<br>
heat labile toxin binds to the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells in a highly specific,<br>
lectin-like manner. Uptake of this toxin and transcytosis to the basolateral side of the<br>
enterocytes has been reported in vivo and in vitro. Other researches have expressed the<br>
transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin in E. coli as a maltose-binding fusion protein and<br>
coupled it chemically to high-Mw poly-L-lysine. The resulting complex was successfully<br>
used to mediate internalization of a reporter gene in vitro. in addition to these examples,<br>
Staphylococcus aureus produces a set of proteins (e.g., staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA),<br>
SEB, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) which act both as superantigens and toxins.<br>
Studies relating to these proteins have reported dose-dependent, facilitated transcytosis of<br>
SEB and TSST-1 in Caco-2 cells.<br>
Viral haemagglutinins comprise another type of transport agent to facilitate mucosal<br>
delivery of biologically active agents within the methods and compositions of the invention.<br>
The initial step in many viral infect ions is the binding of surface proteins (haemagglutinins)<br>
to mucosal cells. These binding proteins have been identified for most viruses, including<br>
rotaviruses, varicella zoster virus, semliki forest virus, adenoviruses, potato leafroll virus, and<br>
reovirus. These and other exemplary viral hemagglutinins can be employed in a<br>
combinatorial formulation (e.g., a mixture or conjugate formulation) or coordinate<br>
administration protocol with one or more of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide, analogs and<br>
mimetics disclosed herein, to coordinately enhance mucosal delivery of one or more<br>
additional biologically active agent(s). Alternatively, viral hemagglutinins can be employed<br>
in a combinatorial formulation or coordinate administration protocol to directly enhance<br>
mucosal delivery of one or more of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and<br>
mimetics, with or without enhanced delivery of an additional biologically active agent.<br>
A variety of endogenous, selective transport-mediating factors are also available for<br>
use within the invention. Mammalian cells have developed an assortment of mechanisms to<br>
facilitate the internalization of specific substrates and target these to defined compartments.<br>
Collectively, these processes of membrane deformations are termed 'endocytosis' and<br>
comprise phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis (clathrin-mediated RME),<br>
and potocytosis (non-clathrin-mediated RME). RME is a highly specific cellular biologic<br>
process by which, as its name implies, various ligands bind to cell surface receptors and are<br>
subsequently internalized and trafficked within the cell. In many cells the process of<br>
endocytosis is so active that the entire membrane surface is internalized and replaced in less<br>
than a half hour. Two classes of receptors are proposed based on their orientation in the cell<br>
membrane; the amino terminus of Type I receptors is located on the extracellular side of the<br>
membrane, whereas Type II receptors have this same protein tail in the intracellular milieu.<br>
Still other embodiments of the invention utilize transferrin as a carrier or stimulant of<br>
RME of mucosally delivered biologically active agents. Transferrin, an 80 kDa iron-<br>
transporting glycoprotein, is efficiently taken up into cells by RME. Transferrin receptors are<br>
found on the surface of most proliferating cells, in elevated numbers on erythroblasts and on<br>
many kinds of tumors. The transcytosis of transferrin (Tf) and transferrin conjugates is<br>
reportedly enhanced in the presence of Brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite. In other<br>
studies, BFA treatment has been reported to rapidly increase apical endocytosis of both ricin<br>
and HRP in MDCK cells. Thus, BFA and other agents that stimulate receptor-mediated<br>
transport can be employed within the methods of the invention as combinatorially formulated<br>
(e.g., conjugated) and/or coordinately administered agents to enhance receptor-mediated<br>
transport of biologically active agents, including Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins,<br>
analogs and mimetics.<br>
Polymeric Delivery Vehicles and Methods<br>
Within certain aspects of the invention, Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs<br>
and mimetics, other biologically active agents disclosed herein, and delivery-enhancing<br>
agents as described above, are, individually or combinatorially, incorporated within a<br>
mucosally (e.g., nasally) administered formulation that includes a biocompatible polymer<br>
functioning as a carrier or base. Such polymer carriers include polymeric powders, matrices<br>
or microparticulate delivery vehicles, among other polymer forms. The polymer can be of<br>
plant, animal, or synthetic oriGln. Often the polymer is crosslinked. Additionally, in these<br>
delivery systems the Y2 receptor-binding peptide, analog or mimetic, can be functionalized in<br>
a manner where it can be covalently bound to the polymer and rendered inseparable from the<br>
polymer by simple washing. In other embodiments, the polymer is chemically modified with<br>
an inhibitor of enzymes or other agents which may degrade or inactivate the biologically<br>
active agent(s) and/or delivery enhancing agent(s). In certain formulations, the polymer is a<br>
partially or completely water insoluble but water swellable polymer, e.g., a hydrogel.<br>
Polymers useful in this aspect of the invention are desirably water interactive and/or<br>
hydrophilic in nature to absorb significant quantities of water, and they often form hydrogels<br>
when placed in contact with water or aqueous media for a period of time sufficient to reach<br>
equilibrium with water. In more detailed embodiments, the polymer is a hydrogel which,<br>
when placed in contact with excess water, absorbs at least two times its weight of water at<br>
equilibrium when exposed to water at room temperature, U.S. Patent No. 6,004,583.<br>
Drug delivery systems based on biodegradable polymers are preferred in many<br>
biomedical applications because such systems are broken down either by hydrolysis or by<br>
enzymatic reaction into non-toxic molecules. The rat+e of degradation is controlled by<br>
manipulating the composition of the biodegradable polymer matrix. These types of systems<br>
can therefore be employed in certain settings for long-term release of biologically active<br>
agents. Biodegradable polymers such as poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly-(lactic acid) (PLA),<br>
and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), have received considerable attention as<br>
possible drug delivery carriers, since the degradation products of these polymers have been<br>
found to have low toxicity. During the normal metabolic function of the body these polymers<br>
degrade into carbon dioxide and water. These polymers have also exhibited excellent<br>
biocompatibility.<br>
For prolonGlng the biological activity of Y2 receptor-binding peptide, analogs and<br>
mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed herein, as well as optional delivery-<br>
enhancing agents, these agents may be incorporated into polymeric matrices, e.g.,<br>
polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, or polyesters. This yields sustained activity and release of<br>
the active agent(s), e.g., as determined by the degradation of the polymer matrix. Although<br>
the encapsulation of biotherapeutic molecules inside synthetic polymers may stabilize them<br>
during storage and delivery, the largest obstacle of polymer-based release technology is the<br>
activity loss of the therapeutic molecules during the formulation processes that often involve<br>
heat, sonication or organic solvents.<br>
Absorption-promoting polymers contemplated for use within the invention may<br>
include derivatives and chemically or physically modified versions of the foregoing types of<br>
polymers, in addition to other naturally occurring or synthetic polymers, gums, resins, and<br>
other agents, as well as blends of these materials with each other or other polymers, so long<br>
as the alterations, modifications or blending do not adversely affect the desired properties,<br>
such as water absorption, hydrogel formation, and/or chemical stability for useful application.<br>
In more detailed aspects of the invention, polymers such as nylon, acrylan and other normally<br>
hydrophobic synthetic polymers may be sufficiently modified by reaction to become water<br>
swellable and/or form stable gels in aqueous media.<br>
Absorption-promoting polymers of the invention may include polymers from the<br>
group of homo- and copolymers based on various combinations of the following vinyl<br>

or methacrylate, vinylpyrrolidones, as well as polyvinylalcohol and its co- and terpolymers,<br>
polyvinylacetate, its co- and terpolymers with the above listed monomers and 2-acrylamido-<br>
2-methyl-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS®). Very useful are copolymers of the above listed<br>
monomers with copolymerizable functional monomers such as acryl or methacryl amide<br>

chain alkyl, aryl having up to four aromatic rings which may contain alkyl substituents of 1 to<br>
6 carbons; steroidal, sulfates, phosphates or cationic monomers such as N,N-<br>
dimethylaminoalkyl(meth)acrylamide, dimethylaminoalkyl(meth)acrylate,<br>

ammonium chloride.<br>
Additional absorption-promoting polymers for use within the invention are those<br>
classified as dextrans, dextrins, and from the class of materials classified as natural gums and<br>
resins, or from the class of natural polymers such as processed collagen, chitin, chitosan,<br>

glycol modified alGlnate) gellan gums such as "Kelocogel", Xanathan gums such as<br>
'Keltrol", estastin, alpha hydroxy butyrate and its copolymers, hyaluronic acid and its<br>
derivatives, polylactic and glycolic acids.<br>
A very useful class of polymers applicable within the instant invention are<br>
olefinically-unsaturated carboxylic acids containing at least one activated carbon-to-carbon<br>
olefinic double bond, and at least one carboxyl group; that is, an acid or functional group<br>
readily converted to an acid containing an olefinic double bond which readily functions in<br>
polymerization because of its presence in the monomer molecule, either in the alpha-beta<br>
position with respect to a carboxyl group, or as part of a terminal methylene grouping.<br>
Olefinically-unsaturated acids of this class include such materials as the acrylic acids typified<br>
by the acrylic acid itself, alpha-cyano acrylic acid, beta methylacrylic acid (crotonic acid),<br>

acid, l-carboxy-4-phenyl butadiene-1,3, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid,<br>

herein, the term "carboxylic acid" includes the polycarboxylic acids and those acid<br>
anhydrides, such as maleic anhydride, wherein the anhydride group is formed by the<br>
elimination of one molecule of water from two carboxyl groups located on the same<br>
carboxylic acid molecule.<br>
Representative acrylates useful as absorption-promoting agents within the invention<br>
include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate,<br>
isobutyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, methyl ethacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, octyl acrylate,<br>
heptyl acrylate, octyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, nonyl<br>
acrylate, hexyl acrylate, n-hexyl methacrylate, and the like. Higher alkyl acrylic esters are<br>
decyl acrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, behenyl acrylate and<br>
melissyl acrylate and methacrylate versions thereof. Mixtures of two or three or more long<br>
chain acrylic esters may be successfully polymerized with one of the carboxylic monomers.<br>
Other comonomers include olefins, including alpha olefins, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Other vinylidene monomers, including the acrylic nitriles, may also be used as<br>
absorption-promoting agents within the methods and compositions of the invention to<br>
enhance delivery and absorption of one or more Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins,<br>
analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agent(s), including to enhance delivery of<br>
the active agent(s) to a target tissue or compartment in the subject (e.g., the liver, hepatic<br>
portal vein, CNS tissue or fluid, or blood plasma). Useful alpha, beta-olefinically unsaturated<br>
nitriles are preferably monoolefinically unsaturated nitriles having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and the like. Most preferred are acrylonitrile and<br>
methacrylonitrile. Acrylic amides containing from 3 to 35 carbon atoms including<br>
monoolefinically unsaturated amides also may be used. Representative amides include<br>
acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-t-butyl acrylamide, N-cyclohexyl acrylamide, higher alkyl<br>
amides, where the alkyl group on the nitrogen contains from 8 to 32 carbon atoms, acrylic<br>
amides including N-alkylol amides of alpha, beta-olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids<br>

haloalkyl) alkenyl phosphonates such as bis(beta-chloroethyl) vinyl phosphonate and the like<br>
as are known to those skilled in the art. Copolymers wherein the carboxy containing<br>
monomer is a minor constituent, and the other vinylidene monomers present as major<br>
components are readily prepared in accordance with the methods disclosed herein.<br>
When hydrogels are employed as absorption promoting agents within the invention,<br>
these may be composed of synthetic copolymers from the group of acrylic and methacrylic<br>
acids, acrylamide, methacrylamide, hydroxyethylacrylate (HEA) or methacrylate (HEMA),<br>
and vinylpyrrolidones which are water interactive and swellable. Specific illustrative<br>
examples of useful polymers, especially for the delivery of peptides or proteins, are the<br>
following types of polymers: (meth)acrylamide and 0.1 to 99 wt. % (meth)acrylic acid;<br>
(meth)acrylamides and 0.1-75 wt % (meth)acryloxyethyl trimethyammonium chloride;<br>
(meth)acrylamide and 0.1-75 wt % (meth)acrylamide; acrylic acid and 0.1-75 wt %<br>
alkyl(meth)acrylates; (meth)acrylamide and 0.1-75 wt % AMPS.RTM. (trademark of<br>
Lubrizol Corp.); (meth)acrylamide and 0 to 30 wt % alkyl(meth)acrylamides and 0.1-75 wt %<br>
AMPS.RTM.; (meth)acrylamide and 0.1-99 wt. % HEMA; (metb)acrylamide and 0.1 to 75<br>
wt % HEMA and 0.1 to 99%(meth)acrylic acid; (meth)acrylic acid and 0.1-99 wt % HEMA;<br>
50 mole % vinyl ether and 50 mole % maleic anhydride; (meth)acrylamide and 0.1 to 75 wt<br>
% (meth)acryloxyalky dimethyl benzylammonium chloride; (meth)acrylamide and 0.1 to 99<br>
wt % vinyl pyrrolidone; (meth)acrylamide and 50 wt % vinyl pyrrolidone and 0.1-99.9 wt %<br>
(meth)acrylic acid; (meth)acrylic acid and 0.1 to 75 wt % AMPS.RTM. and 0.1-75 wt %<br>
alkyl(meth)acrylamide. In the above examples, alkyl means C1 to C30, preferably C1 to C22,<br>
linear and branched and C4 to C16 cyclic; where (meth) is used, it means that the monomers<br>
with and without the methyl group are included. Other very useful hydrogel polymers are<br>
swellable, but insoluble versions of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) starch, carboxymethyl cellulos<br>
and polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
Additional polymeric hydrogel materials useful within the invention include (poly)<br>
hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate: anionic and cationic hydro gels: poly(electrolyte) complexes;<br>
poly(vinyl alcohols) having a low acetate residual: a swellable mixture of crosslinked agar<br>
and crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose: a swellable composition comprising methyl<br>
cellulose mixed with a sparingly crosslinked agar; a water swellable copolymer produced by<br>
a dispersion of finely divided copolymer of maleic anhydride with styrene, ethylene,<br>
propylene, or isobutylene; a water swellable polymer of N-vinyl lactams; swellable sodium<br>
salts of carboxymethyl cellulose; and the like.<br>
Other gelable, fluid imbibing and retaining polymers useful for forming the<br>
hydrophilic hydrogel for mucosal delivery of biologically active agents within the invention<br>
include pectin; polysaccharides such as agar, acacia, karaya, tragacenth, alGlns and guar and<br>
their crosslinked versions; acrylic acid polymers, copolymers and salt derivatives,<br>
polyacrylamides; water swellable indene maleic anhydride polymers; starch graft<br>
copolymers; acrylate type polymers and copolymers with water absorbability of about 2 to<br>
400 times its oriGlnal weight; diesters of polyglucan; a mixture of crosslinked poly(vinyl<br>
alcohol) and poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone); polyoxybutylene-polyethylene block copolymer<br>
gels; carob gum; polyester gels; poly urea gels; polyether gels; polyamide gels; polyimide<br>
gels; polypeptide gels; polyamino acid gels; poly cellulosic gels; crosslinked indene-maleic<br>
anhydride acrylate polymers; and polysaccharides.<br>
Synthetic hydrogel polymers for use within the invention may be made by an infinite<br>
combination of several monomers in several ratios. The hydrogel can be crosslinked and<br>
generally possesses the ability to imbibe and absorb fluid and swell or expand to an enlarged<br>
equilibrium state. The hydrogel typically swells or expands upon delivery to the nasal<br>
mucosal surface, absorbing about 2-5, 5-10, 10-50, up to 50-100 or more times fold its weight<br>
of water. The optimum degree of swellability for a given hydrogel will be determined for<br>
different biologically active agents depending upon such factors as molecular weight, size,<br>
solubility and diffusion characteristics of the active agent carried by or entrapped or<br>
encapsulated within the polymer, and the specific spacing and cooperative chain motion<br>
associated with each individual polymer.<br>
Hydrophilic polymers useful within the invention are water insoluble but water<br>
swellable. Such water-swollen polymers as typically referred to as hydrogels or gels. Such<br>
gels may be conveniently produced from water-soluble polymer by the process of<br>
crosslinking the polymers by a suitable crosslinking agent. However, stable hydrogels may<br>
also be formed from specific polymers under defined conditions of pH, temperature and/or<br>
ionic concentration, according to know methods in the art. Typically the polymers are cross-<br>
linked, that is, cross-linked to the extent that the polymers possess good hydrophilic<br>
properties, have improved physical integrity (as compared to non cross-linked polymers of<br>
the same or similar type) and exhibit improved ability to retain within the gel network both<br>
the biologically active agent of interest and additional compounds for coadministration<br>
therewith such as a cytokine or enzyme inhibitor, while retaining the ability to release the<br>
active agent(s) at the appropriate location and time.<br>
Generally hydrogel polymers for use within the invention are crosslinked with a<br>
difunctional cross-linking in the amount of from 0.01 to 25 weight percent, based on the<br>
weight of the monomers forming the copolymer, and more preferably from 0.1 to 20 weight<br>
percent and more often from 0. 1 to 15 weight percent of the crosslinking agent. Another<br>
useful amount of a crosslinking agent is 0.1 to 10 weight percent. Tri, tetra or higher<br>
multifunctional crosslinking agents may also be employed. When such reagents are utilized,<br>
lower amounts may be required to attain equivalent crosslinking density, i.e., the degree of<br>
crosslinking, or network properties that are sufficient to contain effectively the biologically<br>
active agent(s).<br>
The crosslinks can be covalent, ionic or hydrogen bonds with the polymer possessing<br>
the ability to swell in the presence of water containing fluids. Such crosslinkers and<br>
crosslinking reactions are known to those skilled in the art and in many cases are dependent<br>
upon the polymer system. Thus a crosslinked network may be formed by free radical<br>
copolymerization of unsaturated monomers. Polymeric hydrogels may also be formed by<br>
crosslinking preformed polymers by reacting functional groups found on the polymers such<br>
as alcohols, acids, amines with such groups as glyoxal, formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde, bis<br>
anhydrides and the like.<br>
The polymers also may be cross-linked with any polyene, e.g. decadiene or trivinyl<br>
cyclohexane; acrylamides, such as N,N-methylene-bis (acrylamide); polyfunctional acrylates,<br>
such as trimethylol propane triacrylate; or polyfunctional vinylidene monomer containing at<br>
least 2 terminal CH2 
allyl acrylates and the like, In certain embodiments, cross-linking monomers for use in<br>
preparing the copolymers are polyalkenyl polyethers having more than one alkenyl ether<br>
grouping per molecule, which may optionally possess alkenyl groups in which an olefinic<br>
double bond is present attached to a terminal methylene grouping (e.g., made by the<br>
etherification of a polyhydric alcohol containing at least 2 carbon atoms and at least 2<br>
hydroxyl groups). Compounds of this class may be produced by reacting an alkenyl halide,<br>
such as allyl chloride or allyl bromide, with a strongly alkaline aqueous solution of one or<br>
more polyhydric alcohols. The product may be a complex mixture of polyethers with varying<br>
numbers of ether groups. Efficiency of the polyether cross-linking agent increases with the<br>
number of potentially polymerizable groups on the molecule. Typically, polyethers<br>
containing an average of two or more alkenyl ether groupings per molecule are used. Other<br>
cross-linking monomers include for example, diallyl esters, dimethallyl ethers, allyl or<br>
methallyl acrylates and acrylamides, tetravinyl silane, polyalkenyl methanes, diacrylates. and<br>
dimethacrylates, divinyl compounds such as divinyl benzene, polyallyl phosphate, diallyloxy<br>
compounds and phosphite esters and the like. Typical agents are allyl pentaerythritol, allyl<br>
sucrose, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane diallyl<br>
ether, pentaerythritol triacrylate, tetramethylene dimethacrylate, ethylene diacrylate, ethylene<br>
dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and the like. Allyl pentaerythritol,<br>
trimethylolpropane diallylether and allyl sucrose provide suitable polymers. When the cross-<br>
linking agent is present, the polymeric mixtures usually contain between about 0.01 to 20<br>
weight percent, e.g., 1%, 5%, or 10% or more by weight of cross-linking monomer based on<br>
the total of carboxylic acid monomer, plus other monomers.<br>
In more detailed aspects of the invention, mucosal delivery of Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed herein, is<br>
enhanced by retaining the active agent(s) in a slow-release or enzymatically or<br>
physiologically protective carrier or vehicle, for example a hydrogel that shields the active<br>
agent from the action of the degradative enzymes. In certain embodiments, the active agent<br>
is bound by chemical means to the carrier or vehicle, to which may also be admixed or bound<br>
additional agents such as enzyme inhibitors, cytokines, etc. The active agent may alternately<br>
be immobilized through sufficient physical entrapment within the carrier or vehicle, e.g., a<br>
polymer matrix.<br>
Polymers such as hydrogels useful within the invention may incorporate functional<br>
linked agents such as glycosides chemically incorporated into the polymer for enhancing<br>
intranasal bioavailability of active agents formulated therewith. Examples of such glycosides<br>
are glucosides, fructosides, galactosides, arabinosides, mannosides and their alkyl substituted<br>
derivatives and natural glycosides such as arbutin, phlorizin, amygdalin, digitonin, saponin,<br>
and indican. There are several ways in which a typical glycoside may be bound to a polymer.<br>
For example, the hydrogen of the hydroxyl groups of a glycoside or other similar<br>
carbohydrate may be replaced by the alkyl group from a hydrogel polymer to form an ether.<br>
Also, the hydroxyl groups of the glycosides may be reacted to esterify the carboxyl groups of<br>
a polymeric hydrogel to form polymeric esters in situ. Another approach is to employ<br>
condensation of acetobromoglucose with cholest-5-en-3beta-ol on a copolymer of maleic<br>
acid. N-substituted polyacrylamides can be synthesized by the reaction of activated polymers<br>
with omega-aminoalkylglycosides: (1) (carbohydrate-spacer)(n)-polyacrylamide,<br>
pseudopolysaccharides'; (2) (carbohydrate spacer)(n)-phosphatidylethanolamine(m)-<br>
polyacrylamide, neoglycolipids, derivatives of phosphatidylethanolamine; (3) (carbohydrate-<br>
spacer)(n)-biotin(m)-polyacrylamide. These biotinylated derivatives may attach to lectins on<br>
the mucosal surface to facilitate absorption of the biologically active agent(s), e.g., a<br>
polymer-encapsulated Y2 receptor-binding peptide.<br>
Within more detailed aspects of the invention, one or more Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide, analogs and mimetics, and/or other biologically active agents, disclosed herein,<br>
optionally including secondary active agents such as protease inhibitor(s), cytokine(s),<br>
additional modulator(s) of intercellular junctional physiology, etc., are modified and bound to<br>
a polymeric carrier or matrix. For example, this may be accomplished by chemically binding<br>
a peptide or protein active agent and other optional agent(s) within a crosslinked polymer<br>
network. It is also possible to chemically modify the polymer separately with an interactive<br>
agent such as a glycosidal containing molecule. In certain aspects, the biologically active<br>
agent(s), and optional secondary active agent(s), may be functionalized, i.e., wherein an<br>
appropriate reactive group is identified or is chemically added to the active agent(s). Most<br>
often an ethylenic polymerizable group is added, and the functionalized active agent is then<br>
copolymerized with monomers and a crosslinking agent using a standard polymerization<br>
method such as solution polymerization (usually in water), emulsion, suspension or<br>
dispersion polymerization. Often, the functionalizing agent is provided with a high enough<br>
concentration of functional or polymerizable groups to insure that several sites on the active<br>
agent(s) are functionalized. For example, in a polypeptide comprising 16 amine sites, it is<br>
generally desired to functionalize at least 2, 4, 5, 7, and up to 8 or more of the sites.<br>
After functionalization, the functionalized active agent(s) is/are mixed with monomers<br>
and a crosslinking agent that comprise the reagents from which the polymer of interest is<br>
formed. Polymerization is then induced in this medium to create a polymer containing the<br>
bound active agent(s). The polymer is then washed with water or other appropriate solvents<br>
and otherwise purified to remove trace unreacted impurities and, if necessary, ground or<br>
broken up by physical means such as by stirring, forcing it through a mesh, ultrasonication or<br>
other suitable means to a desired particle size. The solvent, usually water, is then removed in<br>
such a manner as to not denature or otherwise degrade the active agent(s). One desired<br>
method is lyophilization (freeze drying) but other methods are available and may be used<br>
(e.g., vacuum drying, air drying, spray drying, etc.).<br>
To introduce polymerizable groups in peptides, proteins and other active agents<br>
within the invention, it is possible to react available amino, hydroxyl, thiol and other reactive<br>
groups with electrophiles containing unsaturated groups. For example, unsaturated<br>
monomers containing N-hydroxy succinimidyl groups, active carbonates such as p-<br>
nitrophenyl carbonate, trichlorophenyl carbonates, tresylate, oxycarbonylimidazoles, epoxide,<br>
isocyanates and aldehyde, and unsaturated carboxymethyl azides and unsaturated<br>
orthopyridyl-disulfide belong to this category of reagents. Illustrative examples of<br>
unsaturated reagents are allyl glycidyl ether, allyl chloride, allylbromide, allyl iodide,<br>
acryloyl chloride, allyl isocyanate, allylsulfonyl chloride, maleic anhydride, copolymers of<br>
maleic anhydride and allyl ether, and the like.<br>
All of the lysine active derivatives, except aldehyde, can generally react with other<br>
amino acids such as imidazole groups of histidine and hydroxyl groups of tyrosine and the<br>
thiol groups of cystine if the local environment enhances nucleophilicity of these groups.<br>
Aldehyde containing functionalizing reagents are specific to lysine. These types of reactions<br>
with available groups from lysines, cysteines, tyrosine have been extensively documented in<br>
the literature and are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the case of biologically active agents that contain amine groups, it is convenient to<br>
react such groups with an acyloyl chloride, such as acryloyl chloride, and introduce the<br>
polymerizable acrylic group onto the reacted agent. Then during preparation of the polymer,<br>
such as during the crosslinking of the copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid, the<br>
functionalized active agent, through the acrylic groups, is attached to the polymer and<br>
becomes bound thereto.<br>
In additional aspects of the invention, biologically active agents, including peptides,<br>
proteins, nucleosides, and other molecules which are bioactive in vivo, are conjugation-<br>
stabilized by covalently bonding one or more active agent(s) to a polymer incorporating as an<br>
integral part thereof both a hydrophilic moiety, e.g., a linear polyalkylene glycol, a lipophilic<br>
moiety (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,681,811). In one aspect, a biologically active agent is<br>
covalently coupled with a polymer comprising (i) a linear polyalkylene glycol moiety and (ii)<br>
a lipophilic moiety, wherein the active agent, linear polyalkylene glycol moiety, and the<br>
lipophilic moiety are conformationally arranged in relation to one another such that the active<br>
therapeutic agent has an enhanced in vivo resistance to enzymatic degradation (i.e., relative to<br>
its stability under similar conditions in an unconjugated form devoid of the polymer coupled<br>
thereto). In another aspect, the conjugation-stabilized formulation has a three-dimensional<br>
conformation comprising the biologically active agent covalently coupled with a polysorbate<br>
complex comprising (i) a linear polyalkylene glycol moiety and (ii) a lipophilic moiety,<br>
wherein the active agent, the linear polyalkylene glycol moiety and the lipophilic moiety are<br>
conformationally arranged in relation to one another such that (a) the lipophilic moiety is<br>
exteriorly available in the three-dimensional conformation, and (b) the active agent in the<br>
composition has an enhanced in vivo resistance to enzymatic degradation.<br>
In a further related aspect, a multiligand conjugated complex is provided which<br>
comprises a biologically active agent covalently coupled with a triglyceride backbone moiety<br>
through a polyalkylene glycol spacer group bonded at a carbon atom of the triglyceride<br>
backbone moiety, and at least one fatty acid moiety covalently attached either directly to a<br>
carbon atom of the triglyceride backbone moiety or covalently joined through a polyalkylene<br>
glycol spacer moiety (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,681,811). In such a multiligand conjugated<br>
therapeutic agent complex, the alpha' and beta carbon atoms of the triglyceride bioactive<br>
moiety may have fatty acid moieties attached by covalently bonding either directly thereto, or<br>
indirectly covalently bonded thereto through polyalkylene glycol spacer moieties.<br>
Alternatively, a fatty acid moiety may be covalently attached either directly or through a<br>
polyalkylene glycol spacer moiety to the alpha and alpha' carbons of the triglyceride<br>
backbone moiety, with the bioactive therapeutic agent being covalently coupled with the<br>
gamma-carbon of the triglyceride backbone moiety, either being directly covalently bonded<br>
thereto or indirectly bonded thereto through a polyalkylene spacer moiety. It will be<br>
recognized that a wide variety of structural, compositional, and conformational forms are<br>
possible for the multiligand conjugated therapeutic agent complex comprising the triglyceride<br>
backbone moiety, within the scope of the invention. It is further noted that in such a<br>
multiligand conjugated therapeutic agent complex, the biologically active agent(s) may<br>
advantageously be covalently coupled with the triglyceride modified backbone moiety<br>
through alkyl spacer groups, or alternatively other acceptable spacer groups, within the scope<br>
of the invention. As used in such context, acceptability of the spacer group refers to steric,<br>
compositional, and end use application specific acceptability characteristics.<br>
In yet additional aspects of the invention, a conjugation-stabilized complex is<br>
provided which comprises a polysorbate complex comprising a polysorbate moiety including<br>
a triglyceride backbone having covalently coupled to alpha, alpha' and beta carbon atoms<br>
thereof functionalizing groups including (i) a fatty acid group; and (ii) a polyethylene glycol<br>
group having a biologically active agent or moiety covalently bonded thereto, e.g., bonded to<br>
an appropriate functionality of the polyethylene glycol group. Such covalent bonding may be<br>
either direct, e.g., to a hydroxy terminal functionality of the polyethylene glycol group, or<br>
alternatively, the covalent bonding may be indirect, e.g., by reactively capping the hydroxy<br>
terminus of the polyethylene glycol group with a terminal carboxy functionality spacer group,<br>
so that the resulting capped polyethylene glycol group has a terminal carboxy functionality to<br>
which the biologically active agent or moiety may be covalently bonded.<br>
In yet additional aspects of the invention, a stable, aqueously soluble, conjugation-<br>
stabilized complex is provided which comprises one or more Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
proteins, analogs and mimetics, and/or other biologically active agent(s)+ disclosed herein<br>
covalently coupled to a physiologically compatible polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified<br>
glycolipid moiety. In such complex, the biologically active agent(s) may be covalently<br>
coupled to the physiologically compatible PEG modified glycolipid moiety by a labile<br>
covalent bond at a free amino acid group of the active agent, wherein the labile covalent bond<br>
is scissionable in vivo by biochemical hydrolysis and/or proteolysis. The physiologically<br>
compatible PEG modified glycolipid moiety may advantageously comprise a polysorbate<br>
polymer, e.g., a polysorbate polymer comprising fatty acid ester groups selected from the<br>
group consisting of monopalmitate, dipalmitate, monolaurate, dilaurate, trilaurate, monoleate,<br>
dioleate, trioleate, monostearate, distearate, and tristearate. In such complex, the<br>
physiologically compatible PEG modified glycolipid moiety may suitably comprise a<br>
polymer selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol ethers of fatty acids, and<br>
polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids, wherein the fatty acids for example comprise a fatty<br>
acid selected from the group consisting of lauric, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids.<br>
Storage of Material<br>
In certain aspects of the invention, the combinatorial formulations and/or coordinate<br>
administration methods herein incorporate an effective amount of peptides and proteins<br>
which may adhere to charged glass thereby reducing the effective concentration in the<br>
container. Silanized containers, for example, silanized glass containers, are used to store the<br>
finished product to reduce adsorption of the polypeptide or protein to a glass container.<br>
In yet additional aspects of the invention, a kit for treatment of a mammalian subject<br>
comprises a stable pharmaceutical composition of one or more Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
compound(s) formulated for mucosal delivery to the mammalian subject wherein the<br>
composition is effective to alleviate one or more symptom(s) of obesity, cancer, or<br>
malnutrition or wasting related to cancer in said subject without unacceptable adverse side<br>
effects. The kit further comprises a pharmaceutical reagent vial to contain the one or more<br>
Y2 receptor-binding peptide compounds. The pharmaceutical reagent vial is composed of<br>
pharmaceutical grade polymer, glass or other suitable material. The pharmaceutical reagent<br>
vial is, for example, a silanized glass vial. The kit further comprises an aperture for delivery<br>
of the composition to a nasal mucosal surface of the subject. The delivery aperture is<br>
composed of a pharmaceutical grade polymer, glass or other suitable material. The delivery<br>
aperture is, for example, a silanized glass.<br>
A silanization technique combines a special cleaning technique for the surfaces to be<br>
silanized with a silanization process at low pressure. The silane is in the gas phase and at an<br>
enhanced temperature of the surfaces to be silanized. The method provides reproducible<br>
surfaces with stable, homogeneous and functional silane layers having characteristics of a<br>
monolayer. The silanized surfaces prevent binding to the glass of polypeptides or mucosal<br>
delivery enhancing agents of the present invention. .<br>
The procedure is useful to prepare silanized pharmaceutical reagent vials to hold Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide compositions of the present invention. Glass trays are cleaned by<br>
rinsing with double distilled water (ddH2O) before using. The silane tray is then be rinsed<br>
with 95% EtOH, and the acetone tray is rinsed with acetone. Pharmaceutical reagent vials<br>
are sonicated in acetone for 10 minutes. After the acetone sonication, reagent vials are<br>
washed in ddH2O tray at least twice. Reagent vials are sonicated in 0.1 M NaOH for 10<br>
minutes. While the reagent vials are sonicating in NaOH, the silane solution is made under a<br>
hood. (Silane solution: 800 mL of 95% ethanol; 96 L of glacial acetic acid; 25 mL of<br>
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane). After the NaOH sonication, reagent vials are washed in<br>
ddH2O tray at least twice. The reagent vials are sonicated in silane solution for 3 to 5<br>
minutes. The reagent vials are washed in 100% EtOH tray. The reagent vials are dried with<br>
prepurified N2 gas and stored in a 100°C oven for at least 2 hours before using.<br>
Bioadhesive Delivery Vehicles and Methods<br>
In certain aspects of the invention, the combinatorial formulations and/or coordinate<br>
administration methods herein incorporate an effective amount of a nontoxic bioadhesive as<br>
an adjunct compound or carrier to enhance mucosal delivery of one or more biologically<br>
active agent(s). Bioadhesive agents in this context exhibit general or specific adhesion to one<br>
or more components or surfaces of the targeted mucosa. The bioadhesive maintains a desired<br>
concentration gradient of the biologically active agent into or across the mucosa to ensure<br>
penetration of even large molecules (e.g., peptides and proteins) into or through the mucosal<br>
epithelium. Typically, employment of a bioadhesive within the methods and compositions of<br>
the invention yields a two- to five- fold, often a five- to ten-fold increase in permeability for<br>
peptides and proteins into or through the mucosal epithelium. This enhancement of epithelial<br>
permeation often permits effective transmucosal delivery of large macromolecules, for<br>
example to the basal portion of the nasal epithelium or into the adjacent extracellular<br>
compartments or a blood plasma or CNS tissue or fluid.<br>
This enhanced delivery provides for greatly improved effectiveness of delivery of<br>
bioactive peptides, proteins and other macromolecular therapeutic species. These results will<br>
depend in part on the hydrophilicity of the compound, whereby greater penetration will be<br>
achieved with hydrophilic species compared to water insoluble compounds. In addition to<br>
these effects, employment of bioadhesives to enhance drug persistence at the mucosal surface<br>
can elicit a reservoir mechanism for protracted drug delivery, whereby compounds not only<br>
penetrate across the mucosal tissue but also back-diffuse toward the mucosal surface once the<br>
material at the surface is depleted.<br>
A variety of suitable bioadhesives are disclosed in the art for oral administration, U.S.<br>
Patent No.s 3,972,995; 4,259,314; 4,680,323; 4,740,365; 4,573,996; 4,292,299; 4,715,369;<br>
4,876,092; 4,855,142; 4,250,163; 4,226,848; 4,948,580; U.S. Patent Reissue 33,093, which<br>
find use within the novel methods and compositions of the invention. The potential of<br>
various bioadhesive polymers as a mucosal, e.g., nasal, delivery platform within the methods<br>
and compositions of the invention can be readily assessed by determining their ability to<br>
retain and release Y2 receptor-binding peptide, as well as by their capacity to interact with<br>
the mucosal surfaces following incorporation of the active agent therein. In addition, well<br>
known methods will be applied to determine the biocompatibility of selected polymers with<br>
the tissue at the site of mucosal administration. When the target mucosa is covered by mucus<br>
(i.e., in the absence of mucolytic or mucus-clearing treatment), it can serve as a connecting<br>
link to the underlying mucosal epithelium. Therefore, the term "bioadhesive" as used herein<br>
also covers mucoadhesive compounds useful for enhancing mucosal delivery of biologically<br>
active agents within the invention. However, adhesive contact to mucosal tissue mediated<br>
through adhesion to a mucus gel layer may be limited by incomplete or transient attachment<br>
between the mucus layer and the underlying tissue, particularly at nasal surfaces where rapid<br>
mucus clearance occurs. In this regard, mucin glycoproteins are continuously secreted and,<br>
immediately after their release from cells or glands, form a viscoelastic gel. The luminal<br>
surface of the adherent gel layer, however, is continuously eroded by mechanical, enzymatic<br>
and/or ciliary action. Where such activities are more prominent or where longer adhesion<br>
times are desired, the coordinate administration methods and combinatorial formulation<br>
methods of the invention may further incorporate mucolytic and/or ciliostatic methods or<br>
agents as disclosed herein above.<br>
Typically, mucoadhesive polymers for use within the invention are natural or<br>
synthetic macromolecules which adhere to wet mucosal tissue surfaces by complex, but non-<br>
specific, mechanisms. In addition to these mucoadhesive polymers, the invention also<br>
provides methods and compositions incorporating bioadhesives that adhere directly to a cell<br>
surface, rather than to mucus, by means of specific, including receptor-mediated, interactions.<br>
One example of bioadhesives that function in this specific manner is the group of compounds<br>
known as lectins. These are glycoproteins with an ability to specifically recognize and bind<br>
to sugar molecules, e.g. glycoproteins or glycolipids, which form part of intranasal epithelial<br>
cell membranes and can be considered as "lectin receptors".<br>
In certain aspects of the invention, bioadhesive materials for enhancing intranasal<br>
delivery of biologically active agents comprise a matrix of a hydrophilic, e.g., water soluble<br>
or swellable, polymer or a mixture of polymers that can adhere to a wet mucous surface.<br>
These adhesives may be formulated as ointments, hydrogels (see above) thin films, and other<br>
application forms. Often, these adhesives have the biologically active agent mixed therewith<br>
to effectuate slow release or local delivery of the active agent. Some are formulated with<br>
additional ingredients to facilitate penetration of the active agent through the nasal mucosa,<br>
e.g., into the circulatory system of the individual.<br>
Various polymers, both natural and synthetic ones, show significant binding to mucus<br>
and/or mucosal epithelial surfaces under physiological conditions. The strength of this<br>
interaction can readily be measured by mechanical peel or shear tests. When applied to a<br>
humid mucosal surface, many dry materials will spontaneously adhere, at least slightly. After<br>
such an initial contact, some hydrophilic materials start to attract water by adsorption,<br>
swelling or capillary forces, and if this water is absorbed from the underlying substrate or<br>
from the polymer-tissue interface, the adhesion may be sufficient to achieve the goal of<br>
enhancing mucosal absorption of biologically active agents. Such 'adhesion by hydration'<br>
can be quite strong, but formulations adapted to employ this mechanism must account for<br>
swelling which continues as the dosage transforms into a hydrated mucilage. This is<br>
projected for many hydrocolloids useful within the invention, especially some cellulose-<br>
derivatives, which are generally non-adhesive when applied in pre-hydrated state.<br>
Nevertheless, bioadhesive drug delivery systems for mucosal administration are effective<br>
within the invention when such materials are applied in the form of a dry polymeric powder,<br>
microsphere, or film-type delivery form.<br>
Other polymers adhere to mucosal surfaces not only when applied in dry, but also in<br>
fully hydrated state, and in the presence of excess amounts of water. The selection of a<br>
mucoadhesive thus requires due consideration of the conditions, physiological as well as<br>
physico-chemical, under which the contact to the tissue will be formed and maintained. In<br>
particular, the amount of water or humidity usually present at the intended site of adhesion,<br>
and the prevailing pH, are known to largely affect the mucoadhesive binding strength of<br>
different polymers.<br>
Several polymeric bioadhesive drug delivery systems have been fabricated and<br>
studied in the past 20 years, not always with success. A variety of such carriers are, however,<br>
currently used in clinical applications involving dental, orthopedic, ophthalmological, and<br>
surgical uses. For example, acrylic-based hydrogels have been used extensively for<br>
bioadhesive devices. Acrylic-based hydrogels are well suited for bioadhesion due to their<br>
flexibility and nonabrasive characteristics in the partially swollen state, which reduce<br>
damage-causing attrition to the tissues in contact. Furthermore, their high permeability in the<br>
swollen state allows unreacted monomer, un-crosslinked polymer chains, and the initiator to<br>
be washed out of the matrix after polymerization, which is an important feature for selection<br>
of bioadhesive materials for use within the invention. Acrylic-based polymer devices exhibit<br>
very high adhesive bond strength. For controlled mucosal delivery of peptide and protein<br>
drugs, the methods and compositions of the invention optionally include the use of carriers,<br>
e.g., polymeric delivery vehicles, that function in part to shield the biologically active agent<br>
from proteolytic breakdown, while at the same time providing for enhanced penetration of the<br>
peptide or protein into or through the nasal mucosa. In this context, bioadhesive polymers<br>
have demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing oral drug delivery. As an example,<br>
the bioavailability of 9-desglycinamide, 8-arGlnine vasopressin (DGAVP) intraduodenally<br>
administered to rats together with a 1% (w/v) saline dispersion of the mucoadhesive<br>
poly(acrylic acid) derivative polycarbophil, was 3-5-fold increased compared to an aqueous<br>
solution of the peptide drug without this polymer.<br>
Mucoadhesive polymers of the poly(acrylic acid)-type are potent inhibitors of some<br>
intestinal proteases. The mechanism of enzyme inhibition is explained by the strong affinity<br>
of this class of polymers for divalent cations, such as calcium or zinc, which are essential<br>
cofactors of metallo-proteinases, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. Depriving the proteases<br>
of their cofactors by poly(acrylic acid) was reported to induce irreversible structural changes<br>
of the enzyme proteins which were accompanied by a loss of enzyme activity. At the same<br>
time, other mucoadhesive polymers (e.g., some cellulose derivatives and chitosan) may not<br>
inhibit proteolytic enzymes under certain conditions. In contrast to other enzyme inhibitors<br>
contemplated for use within the invention (e.g. aprotinin, bestatin), which are relatively small<br>
molecules, the trans-nasal absorption of inhibitory polymers is likely to be minimal in light of<br>
the size of these molecules, and thereby eliminate possible adverse side effects. Thus,<br>
mucoadhesive polymers, particularly of the poly(acrylic acid)-type, may serve both as an<br>
absorption-promoting adhesive and enzyme-protective agent to enhance controlled delivery<br>
of peptide and protein drugs, especially when safety concerns are considered.<br>
In addition to protecting against enzymatic degradation, bioadhesives and other<br>
polymeric or non-polymeric absorption-promoting agents for use within the invention may<br>
directly increase mucosal permeability to biologically active agents. To facilitate the<br>
transport of large and hydrophilic molecules, such as peptides and proteins, across the nasal<br>
epithelial barrier, mucoadhesive polymers and other agents have been postulated to yield<br>
enhanced permeation effects beyond what is accounted for by prolonged premucosal<br>
residence time of the delivery system. The time course of drug plasma concentrations<br>
reportedly suggested that the bioadhesive microspheres caused an acute, but transient<br>
increase of insulin permeability across the nasal mucosa. Other mucoadhesive polymers for<br>
use within the invention, for example chitosan, reportedly enhance the permeability of certain<br>
mucosal epithelia even when they are applied as an aqueous solution or gel. Another<br>
mucoadhesive polymer reported to directly affect epithelial permeability is hyaluronic acid<br>
and ester derivatives thereof. A particularly useful bioadhesive agent within the coordinate<br>
administration, and/or combinatorial formulation methods and compositions of the invention<br>
is chitosan, as well as its analogs and derivatives. Chitosan is a non-toxic, biocompatible and<br>
biodegradable polymer that is widely used for pharmaceutical and medical applications<br>
because of its favorable properties of low toxicity and good biocompatibility. It is a natural<br>
polyaminosaccharide prepared from chitin by N-deacetylation with alkali. As used within the<br>
methods and compositions of the invention, chitosan increases the retention of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed<br>
herein at a mucosal site of application. This mode of administration can also improve patient<br>
compliance and acceptance. As further provided herein, the methods and compositions of the<br>
invention will optionally include a novel chitosan derivative or chemically modified form of<br>
chitosan. One such novel derivative for use within the invention is denoted as a P-[l?4]-2-<br>
guanidino-2-deoxy-D-glucose polymer (poly-GuD). Chitosan is the N-deacetylated product<br>
of chitin, a naturally occurring polymer that has been used extensively to prepare<br>
microspheres for oral and intra-nasal formulations. The chitosan polymer has also been<br>
proposed as a soluble carrier for parenteral drug delivery. Within one aspect of the invention,<br>
o-methylisourea is used to convert a chitosan amine to its guanidinium moiety. The<br>
guanidinium compound is prepared, for example, by the reaction between equi-normal<br>
solutions of chitosan and o-methylisourea at pH above 8.0.<br>
The guanidinium product is -[ 14]-guanidino-2-deoxy-D-glucose polymer. It is<br>
abbreviated as Poly-GuD in this context (Monomer F.W. of Amine in Chitosan = 161;<br>
Monomer F.W. of Guanidinium in Poly-GuD = 203).<br>

methylisourea chloride solution (0.2N urea group equivalent) prepared as described above.<br>
Stir the solution overnight.<br>
Adjust the pH of solution to 5.5 with 0.5% Acetic Acid (0.088N).<br>
Dilute the solution to a final volume of 25 mL using purified water.<br>
The Poly-GuD concentration in the solution is 5 mg/mL, equivalent to 0.025 N<br>

Additional compounds classified as bioadhesive agents for use within the present<br>
invention act by mediating specific interactions, typically classified as "receptor-ligand<br>
interactions" between complementary structures of the bioadhesive compound and a<br>
component of the mucosal epithelial surface. Many natural examples illustrate this form of<br>
specific binding bioadhesion, as exemplified by lectin-sugar interactions. Lectins are (glyco)<br>
proteins of non-immune oriGln which bind to polysaccharides or glycoconjugates.<br>
Several plant lectins have been investigated as possible pharmaceutical absorption-<br>
promoting agents. One plant lectin, Phaseolus vulgaris hemagglutinin (PHA), exhibits high<br>
oral bioavailability of more than 10% after feeding to rats. Tomato {Lycopersicon<br>
esculeutum) lectin (TL) appears safe for various modes of administration.<br>
In summary, the foregoing bioadhesive agents are useful in the combinatorial<br>
formulations and coordinate administration methods of the instant invention, which<br>
optionally incorporate an effective amount and form of a bioadhesive agent to prolong<br>
persistence or otherwise increase mucosal absorption of one or more Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents. The<br>
bioadhesive agents may be coordinately administered as adjunct compounds or as additives<br>
within the combinatorial formulations of the invention. In certain embodiments, the<br>
bioadhesive agent acts as a 'pharmaceutical glue', whereas in other embodiments adjunct<br>
delivery or combinatorial formulation of the bioadhesive agent serves to intensify contact of<br>
the biologically active agent with the nasal mucosa, in some cases by promoting specific<br>
receptor-ligand interactions with epithelial cell "receptors", and in others by increasing<br>
epithelial permeability to significantly increase the drug concentration gradient measured at a<br>
target site of delivery (e.g., liver, blood plasma, or CNS tissue or fluid). Yet additional<br>
bioadhesive agents for use within the invention act as enzyme (e.g., protease) inhibitors to<br>
enhance the stability of mucosally administered biotherapeutic agents delivered coordinately<br>
or in a combinatorial formulation with the bioadhesive agent.<br>
Liposomes and Micellar Delivery Vehicles<br>
The coordinate administration methods and combinatorial formulations of the instant<br>
invention optionally incorporate effective lipid or fatty acid based carriers, processing agents,<br>
or delivery vehicles, to provide improved formulations for mucosal delivery of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents. For<br>
example, a variety of formulations and methods are provided for mucosal delivery which<br>
comprise one or more of these active agents, such as a peptide or protein, admixed or<br>
encapsulated by, or coordinately administered with, a liposome, mixed micellar carrier, or<br>
emulsion, to enhance chemical and physical stability and increase the half life of the<br>
biologically active agents (e.g., by reducing susceptibility to proteolysis, chemical<br>
modification and/or denaturation) upon mucosal delivery.<br>
Within certain aspects of the invention, specialized delivery systems for biologically<br>
active agents comprise small lipid vesicles known as liposomes. These are typically made<br>
from natural, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-immunogenic lipid molecules, and can<br>
efficiently entrap or bind drug molecules, including peptides and proteins, into, or onto, their<br>
membranes. The attractiveness of liposomes as a peptide and protein delivery system within<br>
the invention is increased by the fact that the encapsulated proteins can remain in their<br>
preferred aqueous environment within the vesicles, while the liposomal membrane protects<br>
them against proteolysis and other destabilizing factors. Even though not all liposome<br>
preparation methods known are feasible in the encapsulation of peptides and proteins due to<br>
their unique physical and chemical properties, several methods allow the encapsulation of<br>
these macromolecules without substantial deactivation.<br>
A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes for use within the<br>
invention, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, and 4,837,028. For use with liposome<br>
delivery, the biologically active agent is typically entrapped within the liposome, or lipid<br>
vesicle, or is bound to the outside of the vesicle.<br>
Like liposomes, unsaturated long chain fatty acids, which also have enhancing<br>
activity for mucosal absorption, can form closed vesicles with bilayer-like structures (so<br>
called "ufasomes"). These can be formed, for example, using oleic acid to entrap<br>
biologically active peptides and proteins for mucosal, e.g., intranasal, delivery within the<br>
invention.<br>
Other delivery systems for use within the invention combine the use of polymers and<br>
liposomes to ally the advantageous properties of both vehicles such as encapsulation inside<br>
the natural polymer fibrin. In addition, release of biotherapeutic compounds from this<br>
delivery system is controllable through the use of covalent crosslinking and the addition of<br>
antifibrinolytic agents to the fibrin polymer.<br>
More simplified delivery systems for use within the invention include the use of<br>
cationic lipids as delivery vehicles or carriers, which can be effectively employed to provide<br>
an electrostatic interaction between the lipid carrier and such charged biologically active<br>
agents as proteins and polyanionic nucleic acids. This allows efficient packaGlng of the drugs<br>
into a form suitable for mucosal administration and/or subsequent delivery to systemic<br>
compartments.<br>
Additional delivery vehicles for use within the invention include long and medium<br>
chain fatty acids, as well as surfactant mixed micelles with fatty acids. Most naturally<br>
occurring lipids in the form of esters have important implications with regard to their own<br>
transport across mucosal surfaces. Free fatty acids and their monoglycerides which have<br>
polar groups attached have been demonstrated in the form of mixed micelles to act on the<br>
intestinal barrier as penetration enhancers. This discovery of barrier modifying function of<br>
free fatty acids (carboxylic acids with a chain length varying from 12 to 20 carbon atoms) and<br>
their polar derivatives has stimulated extensive research on the application of these agents as<br>
mucosal absorption enhancers.<br>
For use within the methods of the invention, long chain fatty acids, especially<br>
fusogenic lipids (unsaturated fatty acids and monoglycerides such as oleic acid, linoleic acid,<br>
linoleic acid, monoolein, etc.) provide useful carriers to enhance mucosal delivery of Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents<br>
disclosed herein. Medium chain fatty acids (C6 to C12) and monoglycerides have also been<br>
shown to have enhancing activity in intestinal drug absorption and can be adapted for use<br>
within the mocosal delivery formulations and methods of the invention. In addition, sodium<br>
salts of medium and long chain fatty acids are effective delivery vehicles and absorption-<br>
enhancing agents for mucosal delivery of biologically active agents within the invention.<br>
Thus, fatty acids can be employed in soluble forms of sodium salts or by the addition of non-<br>
toxic surfactants, e.g., polyoxyethylated hydrogenated castor oil, sodium taurocholate, etc.<br>
Other fatty acid and mixed micellar preparations that are useful within the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, Na caprylate (C8), Na caprate (C10), Na laurate (C12) or Na oleate<br>
(C18), optionally combined with bile salts, such as glycocholate and taurocholate.<br>
Pegylation<br>
Additional methods and compositions provided within the invention involve chemical<br>
modification of biologically active peptides and proteins by covalent attachment of polymeric<br>
materials, for example dextrans, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, glycopeptides, polyethylene glycol<br>
and polyamino acids. The resulting conjugated peptides and proteins retain their biological<br>
activities and solubility for mucosal administration. In alternate embodiments, Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active peptides and<br>
proteins, are conjugated to polyalkylene oxide polymers, particularly polyethylene glycols<br>
(PEG). U.S. Patent No. 4,179,337.<br>
Amine-reactive PEG polymers for use within the invention include SC-PEG with<br>
molecular masses of 2000, 5000, 10000, 12000, and 20 000; U-PEG-10000; NHS-PEG-3400-<br>
biotin; T-PEG-5000; T-PEG-12000; and TPC-PEG-5000. PEGylation of biologically active<br>
peptides and proteins may be achieved by modification of carboxyl sites (e.g., aspartic acid or<br>
glutamic acid groups in addition to the carboxyl terminus). The utility of PEG-hydrazide in<br>
selective modification of carbodiimide-activated protein carboxyl groups under acidic<br>
conditions has been described. Alternatively, bifunctional PEG modification of biologically<br>
active peptides and proteins can be employed. In some procedures, charged amino acid<br>
residues, including lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid, have a marked tendency to be<br>
solvent accessible on protein surfaces.<br>
Other Stabilizing Modifications of Active Agents<br>
In addition to PEGylation, biologically active agents such as peptides and proteins for<br>
use within the invention can be modified to enhance circulating half-life by shielding the<br>
active agent via conjugation to other known protecting or stabilizing compounds, for example<br>
by the creation of fusion proteins with an active peptide, protein, analog or mimetic linked to<br>
one or more carrier proteins, such as one or more immunoglobulin chains.<br>
Formulation and Administration<br>
Mucosal delivery formulations of the present invention comprise Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide, analogs and mimetics, typically combined together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and, optionally, other therapeutic ingredients. The<br>
carrier(s) must be "pharmaceutically acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the<br>
other ingredients of the formulation and not eliciting an unacceptable deleterious effect in the<br>
subject. Such carriers are described herein above or are otherwise well known to those<br>
skilled in the art of pharmacology. Desirably, the formulation should not include substances<br>
such as enzymes or oxidizing agents with which the biologically active agent to be<br>
administered is known to be incompatible. The formulations may be prepared by any of the<br>
methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Within the compositions and methods of the invention, the Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed herein<br>
may be administered to subjects by a variety of mucosal administration modes, including by<br>
oral, rectal, vaGlnal, intranasal, intrapulmonary, or transdermal delivery, or by topical<br>
delivery to the eyes, ears, skin or other mucosal surfaces. Optionally, Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active agents disclosed herein<br>
can be coordinately or adjunctively administered by non-mucosal routes, including by<br>
intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intra-atrial, intra-articular, intraperitoneal, or<br>
parenteral routes. In other alternative embodiments, the biologically active agent(s) can be<br>
administered ex vivo by direct exposure to cells, tissues or organs oriGlnating from a<br>
mammalian subject, for example as a component of an ex vivo tissue or organ treatment<br>
formulation that contains the biologically active agent in a suitable, liquid or solid carrier.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention are often administered in an aqueous<br>
solution as a nasal or pulmonary spray and may be dispensed in spray form by a variety of<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferred systems for dispensing liquids as a nasal<br>
spray are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,511,069. The formulations may be presented in<br>
multi-dose containers, for example in the sealed dispensing system disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,511,069. Additional aerosol delivery forms may include, e.g., compressed air-, jet-,<br>
ultrasonic-, and piezoelectric nebulizers, which deliver the biologically active agent dissolved<br>
or suspended in a pharmaceutical solvent, e.g., water, ethanol, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Nasal and pulmonary spray solutions of the present invention typically comprise the<br>
drug or drug to be delivered, optionally formulated with a surface-active agent, such as a<br>
nonionic surfactant (e.g., polysorbate-80), and one or more buffers. In some embodiments of<br>
the present invention, the nasal spray solution further comprises a propellant. The pH of the<br>
nasal spray solution is optionally between about pH 3.0 and 6.0, preferably 5.0±0.3. Suitable<br>
buffers for use within these compositions are as described above or as otherwise known in the<br>
art. Other components may be added to enhance or maintain chemical stability, including<br>
preservatives, surfactants, dispersants, or gases. Suitable preservatives include, but are not<br>
limited to, phenol, methyl paraben, paraben, m-cresol, thiomersal, chlorobutanol,<br>
benzylalkonimum chloride, and the like. Suitable surfactants include, but are not limited to,<br>
oleic acid, sorbitan trioleate, polysorbates, lecithin, phosphotidyl cholines, and various long<br>
chain diglycerides and phospholipids. Suitable dispersants include, but are not limited to,<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the like. Suitable gases include, but are not limited to,<br>
nitrogen, helium, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), carbon dioxide,<br>
air, and the like.<br>
Within alternate embodiments, mucosal formulations are administered as dry powder<br>
formulations comprising the biologically active agent in a dry, usually lyophilized, form of an<br>
appropriate particle size, or within an appropriate particle size range, for intranasal delivery.<br>
Minimum particle size appropriate for deposition within the nasal or pulmonary passages is<br>
often about 0.5 m mass median equivalent aerodynamic diameter (MMEAD), commonly<br>
about 1 u MMEAD, and more typically about 2 m MMEAD. Maximum particle size<br>
appropriate for deposition within the nasal passages is often about 10 m MMEAD, commonly<br>
about 8 m MMEAD, and more typically about 4m MMEAD. Intranasally respirable powders<br>
within these size ranges can be produced by a variety of conventional techniques, such as jet<br>
milling, spray drying, solvent precipitation, supercritical fluid condensation, and the like.<br>
These dry powders of appropriate MMEAD can be administered to a patient via a<br>
conventional dry powder inhaler (DPI), which rely on the patient's breath, upon pulmonary or<br>
nasal inhalation, to disperse the power into an aerosolized amount. Alternatively, the dry<br>
powder may be administered via air-assisted devices that use an external power source to<br>
disperse the powder into an aerosolized amount, e.g., a piston pump.<br>
Dry powder devices typically require a powder mass in the range from about 1 mg to<br>
20 mg to produce a single aerosolized dose ("puff). If the required or desired dose of the<br>
biologically active agent is lower than this amount, the powdered active agent will typically<br>
be combined with a pharmaceutical dry bulking powder to provide the required total powder<br>
mass. Preferred dry bulking powders include sucrose, lactose, dextrose, mannitol, glycine,<br>
trehalose, human serum albumin (HSA), and starch. Other suitable dry bulking powders<br>
include cellobiose, dextrans, maltotriose, pectin, sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate, and the<br>
like.<br>
To formulate compositions for mucosal delivery within the present invention, the<br>
biologically active agent can be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
additives, as well as a base or carrier for dispersion of the active agent(s). Desired additives<br>
include, but are not limited to, pH control agents, such as arGlnine, sodium hydroxide,<br>
glycine, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, etc. In addition, local anesthetics (e.g., benzyl<br>
alcohol), isotonizing agents (e.g., sodium chloride, mannitol, sorbitol), adsorption inhibitors<br>
(e.g., Tween 80), solubility enhancing agents (e.g., cyclodextrins and derivatives thereof),<br>
stabilizers (e.g., serum albumin), and reducing agents (e.g., glutathione) can be included.<br>
When the composition for mucosal delivery is a liquid, the tonicity of the formulation, as<br>
measured with reference to the tonicity of 0.9% (w/v) physiological saline solution taken as<br>
unity, is typically adjusted to a value at which no substantial, irreversible tissue damage will<br>
be induced in the nasal mucosa at the site of administration. Generally, the tonicity of the<br>
solution is adjusted to a value of about 1/3 to 3, more typically 1/2 to 2, and most often 3/4 to<br>
1.7.<br>
The biologically active agent may be dispersed in a base or vehicle, which may<br>
comprise a hydrophilic compound having a capacity to disperse the active agent and any<br>
desired additives. The base may be selected from a wide range of suitable carriers, including<br>
but not limited to, copolymers of polycarboxylic acids or salts thereof, carboxylic anhydrides<br>
(e.g. maleic anhydride) with other monomers (e.g. methyl (meth)acrylate, acrylic acid, etc.),<br>
hydrophilic vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, etc., and natural polymers such as chitosan, collagen, sodium<br>
alGlnate, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, and nontoxic metal salts thereof. Often, a biodegradable<br>
polymer is selected as a base or carrier, for example, polylactic acid, poly(lactic acid-glycolic<br>
acid) copolymer, polyhydroxybutyric acid, poly(hydroxybutyric acid-glycolic acid)<br>
copolymer and mixtures thereof. Alternatively or additionally, synthetic fatty acid esters<br>
such as polyglycerin fatty acid esters, sucrose fatty acid esters, etc. can be employed as<br>
carriers. Hydrophilic polymers and other carriers can be used alone or in combination, and<br>
enhanced structural integrity can be imparted to the carrier by partial crystallization, ionic<br>
bonding, crosslinking and the like. The carrier can be provided in a variety of forms,<br>
including, fluid or viscous solutions, gels, pastes, powders, microspheres and films for direct<br>
application to the nasal mucosa. The use of a selected carrier in this context may result in<br>
promotion of absorption of the biologically active agent.<br>
The biologically active agent can be combined with the base or carrier according to a<br>
variety of methods, and release of the active agent may be by diffusion, disintegration of the<br>
carrier, or associated formulation of water channels. In some circumstances, the active agent<br>
is dispersed in microcapsules (microspheres) or nanocapsules (nanospheres) prepared from a<br>
suitable polymer, e.g., isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate and dispersed in a biocompatible dispersing<br>
medium applied to the nasal mucosa, which yields sustained delivery and biological activity<br>
over a protracted time.<br>
To further enhance mucosal delivery of pharmaceutical agents within the invention,<br>
formulations comprising the active agent may also contain a hydrophilic low molecular<br>
weight compound as a base or excipient. Such hydrophilic low molecular weight compounds<br>
provide a passage medium through which a water-soluble active agent, such as a<br>
physiologically active peptide or protein, may diffuse through the base to the body surface<br>
where the active agent is absorbed. The hydrophilic low molecular weight compound<br>
optionally absorbs moisture from the mucosa or the administration atmosphere and dissolves<br>
the water-soluble active peptide. The molecular weight of the hydrophilic low molecular<br>
weight compound is generally not more than 10000 and preferably not more than 3000.<br>
Exemplary hydrophilic low molecular weight compound include polyol compounds, such as<br>
oligo-, di- and monosaccarides such as sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, L-arabinose, D-<br>
erythrose, D-ribose, D-xylose, D-mannose, trehalose, D-galactose, lactulose, cellobiose,<br>
gentibiose, glycerin and polyethylene glycol. Other examples of hydrophilic low molecular<br>
weight compounds useful as carriers within the invention include N-methylpyrrolidone, and<br>
alcohols (e.g. oligovinyl alcohol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, etc.) These<br>
hydrophilic low molecular weight compounds can be used alone or in combination with one<br>
another or with other active or inactive components of the intranasal formulation.<br>
The compositions of the invention may alternatively contain as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as<br>
pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents and the like, for<br>
example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium<br>
chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. For solid compositions,<br>
conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be used which include, for<br>
example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.<br>
Therapeutic compositions for administering the biologically active agent can also be<br>
formulated as a solution, microemulsion, or other ordered structure suitable for high<br>
concentration of active ingredients. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium<br>
containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and<br>
liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity for<br>
solutions can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the<br>
maintenance of a desired particle size in the case of dispersible formulations, and by the use<br>
of surfactants. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example,<br>
sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition.<br>
Prolonged absorption of the biologically active agent can be brought about by including in<br>
the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and<br>
gelatin.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the biologically active agent is administered<br>
in a time-release formulation, for example in a composition which includes a slow release<br>
polymer. The active agent can be prepared with carriers that will protect against rapid<br>
release, for example a controlled release vehicle such as a polymer, microencapsulated<br>
delivery system or bioadhesive gel. Prolonged delivery of the active agent, in various<br>
compositions of the invention can be brought about by including in the composition agents<br>
that delay absorption, for example, aluminum monosterate hydrogels and gelatin. When<br>
controlled release formulations of the biologically active agent is desired, controlled release<br>
binders suitable for use in accordance with the invention include any biocompatible<br>
controlled-release material which is inert to the active agent and which is capable of<br>
incorporating the biologically active agent. Numerous such materials are known in the art.<br>
Useful controlled-release binders are materials that are metabolized slowly under<br>
physiological conditions following their intranasal delivery (e.g., at the nasal mucosal<br>
surface, or in the presence of bodily fluids following transmucosal delivery). Appropriate<br>
binders include but are not limited to biocompatible polymers and copolymers previously<br>
used in the art in sustained release formulations. Such biocompatible compounds are non-<br>
toxic and inert to surrounding tissues, and do not trigger significant adverse side effects such<br>
as nasal irritation, immune response, inflammation, or the like. They are metabolized into<br>
metabolic products that are also biocompatible and easily eliminated from the body.<br>
Exemplary polymeric materials for use in this context include, but are not limited to,<br>
polymeric matrices derived from copolymeric and homopolymeric polyesters having<br>
hydrolysable ester linkages. A number of these are known in the art to be biodegradable and<br>
to lead to degradation products having no or low toxicity. Exemplary polymers include<br>
polyglycolic acids (PGA) and polylactic acids (PLA), poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic<br>
acid)(DL PLGA), poly(D-lactic acid-coglycolic acid)(D PLGA) and poly(L-lactic acid-co-<br>
glycolic acid)(L PLGA). Other useful biodegradable or bioerodable polymers include but are<br>
not limited to such polymers as poly(epsilon-caprolactone), poly(epsilon-aprolactone-CO-<br>
lactic acid), poly(s-aprolactone-CO-glycolic acid), poly(beta-hydroxy butyric acid),<br>
poly(alkyl-2-cyanoacrilate), hydrogels such as poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate), polyamides,<br>
poly(amino acids) (i.e., L-leucine, glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid and the like), poly (ester<br>
urea), poly (2-hydroxyethyl DL-aspartamide), polyacetal polymers, polyorthoesters,<br>
polycarbonate, polymaleamides, polysaccharides and copolymers thereof. Many methods for<br>
preparing such formulations are generally known to those skilled in the art. Other useful<br>
formulations include controlled-release compositions e.g., microcapsules, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,652,441 and 4,917,893, lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers useful in making<br>
microcapsules and other formulations, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,677,191 and 4,728,721, and<br>
sustained-release compositions for water-soluble peptides, U.S. Patent No. 4,675,189.<br>
Sterile solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required<br>
amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above,<br>
as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by<br>
incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion<br>
medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of<br>
sterile powders, methods of preparation include vacuum drying and freeze-drying which<br>
yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a<br>
previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The prevention of the action of microorganisms<br>
can be accomplished by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.<br>
Mucosal administration according to the invention allows effective self-administration<br>
of treatment by patients, provided that sufficient safeguards are in place to control and<br>
monitor dosing and side effects. Mucosal administration also overcomes certain drawbacks<br>
of other administration forms, such as injections, that are painful and expose the patient to<br>
possible infections and may present drug bioavailability problems. For nasal and pulmonary<br>
delivery, systems for controlled aerosol dispensing of therapeutic liquids as a spray are well<br>
known. In one embodiment, metered doses of active agent are delivered by means of a<br>
specially constructed mechanical pump valve, U.S. Patent No. 4,511,069.<br>
Dosage<br>
For prophylactic and treatment purposes, the biologically active agent(s) disclosed<br>
herein may be administered to the subject in a single bolus delivery, via continuous delivery<br>
(e.g., continuous transdermal, mucosal, or intravenous delivery) over an extended time<br>
period, or in a repeated administration protocol (e.g., by an hourly, daily or weekly, repeated<br>
administration protocol). In this context, a therapeutically effective dosage of the<br>
biologically active agent(s) may include repeated doses within a prolonged prophylaxis or<br>
treatment regimen that will yield clinically significant results to alleviate one or more<br>
symptoms or detectable conditions associated with a targeted disease or condition as set forth<br>
above. Determination of effective dosages in this context is typically based on animal model<br>
studies followed up by human clinical trials and is guided by determining effective dosages<br>
and administration protocols that significantly reduce the occurrence or severity of targeted<br>
disease symptoms or conditions in the subject. Suitable models in this regard include, for<br>
example, murine, rat, porcine, feline, non-human primate, and other accepted animal model<br>
subjects known in the art. Alternatively, effective dosages can be determined using in vitro<br>
models (e.g., immunologic and histopathologic assays). Using such models, only ordinary<br>
calculations and adjustments are typically required to determine an appropriate concentration<br>
and dose to administer a therapeutically effective amount of the biologically active agent(s)<br>
(e.g., amounts that are intranasally effective, transdermally effective, intravenously effective,<br>
or intramuscularly effective to elicit a desired response).<br>
The actual dosage of biologically active agents will of course vary according to<br>
factors such as the disease indication and particular status of the subject (e.g., the subject's<br>
age, size, fitness, extent of symptoms, susceptibility factors, etc), time and route of<br>
administration, other drugs or treatments being administered concurrently, as well as the<br>
specific pharmacology of the biologically active agent(s) for eliciting the desired activity or<br>
biological response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide an optimum<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which<br>
any toxic or detrimental side effects of the biologically active agent are outweighed in clinical<br>
terms by therapeutically beneficial effects. A non-limiting range for a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of an Y2 agonist within the methods and formulations of the invention is<br>
0.7µg/kg to about 25 µg/kg. To promote weight loss, an intranasal dose of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide is administered at dose high enough to promote satiety but low enough so as<br>
not to induce any unwanted side-effects such as nausea. A preferred intranasal dose of PYY3.<br>
36 is about 1 ug -10mg/kg weight of the patient, most preferably from about 1.5 µg/kg to<br>
about 3 µg/kg weight of the patient. In a standard dose a patient will receive 50 µg to 1600<br>
ug, more preferably about between 75 (ig to 800 ug, most preferably 100 µg, 150 µg, 200 µg<br>
to about 400 µg. . Alternatively, a non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of a biologically active agent within the methods and formulations of the invention is<br>
between about 0.001 pmol to about 100 pmol per kg body weight, between about 0.01 pmol<br>
to about 10 pmol per kg body weight, between about 0.1 pmol to about 5 pmol per kg body<br>
weight, or between about 0.5 pmol to about 1.0 pmol per kg body weight. Dosages within<br>
this range can be achieved by single or multiple administrations, including, e.g., multiple<br>
administrations per day, daily or weekly administrations. Per administration, it is desirable to<br>
administer at least one microgram of the biologically active agent (e.g., one or more Y2<br>
receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs and mimetics, and other biologically active<br>
agents), more typically between about 10mg and 5.0 mg, and in certain embodiments<br>
between about 100 µg and 1.0 or 2.0 mg to an average human subject. For certain oral<br>
applications, doses as high as 0.5 mg per kg body weight may be necessary to achieve<br>
adequate plasma levels. It is to be further noted that for each particular subject, specific<br>
dosage regimens should be evaluated and adjusted over time according to the individual need<br>
and professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of<br>
the permeabilizing peptide(s) and other biologically active agent(s). An intranasal dose of a<br>
PYY will range from 50 µg to 1600 ug of PYY, preferably 75 ug to 800 ug, more preferably<br>
100 µg to 400 µg with a most preferred dose being between 100 µg to 200ug with 150 µg<br>
being a dose that is considered to be highly effective. Repeated intranasal dosing with the<br>
formulations of the invention, on a schedule ranGlng from about 0.1 to24 hours between<br>
doses, preferably between 0.1 and 2.0 hours between doses, will maintain normalized,<br>
sustained therapeutic levels of Y2 receptor-binding peptide to maximize clinical benefits<br>
while minimizing the risks of excessive exposure and side effects. This dose can be<br>
administered several times a day, preferably one half hour before a meal or when hunger<br>
occurs to promote satiety.<br>
Dosage of Y2 agonists such as PYY may be varied by the attending clinician or<br>
patient, if self administering an over the counter dosage form, to maintain a desired<br>
concentration at the target site.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the invention provides compositions and methods for<br>
intranasal delivery of Y2 receptor-binding peptide, wherein the Y2 receptor-binding peptide<br>
compound(s) is/are repeatedly administered through an intranasal effective dosage regimen<br>
that involves multiple administrations of the Y2 receptor-binding peptide to the subject<br>
during a daily or weekly schedule to maintain a therapeutically effective elevated and<br>
lowered pulsatile level of Y2 receptor-binding peptide during an extended dosing period.<br>
The compositions and method provide Y2 receptor-binding peptide compound(s) that are<br>
self-administered by the subject in a nasal formulation between two and six times daily to<br>
maintain a therapeutically effective elevated and lowered pulsatile level of Y2 receptor-<br>
binding peptide during an 8 hour to 24 hour extended dosing period.<br>
Kits<br>
The instant invention also includes kits, packages and multicontainer units containing<br>
the above described pharmaceutical compositions, active ingredients, and/or means for<br>
administering the same for use in the prevention and treatment of diseases and other<br>
conditions in mammalian subjects. Briefly, these kits include a container or formulation that<br>
contains one or more Y2 receptor-binding peptide proteins, analogs or mimetics, and/or other<br>
biologically active agents in combination with mucosal delivery enhancing agents disclosed<br>
herein formulated in a pharmaceutical preparation for mucosal delivery.<br>
The intranasal formulations of the present invention can be administered using any<br>
spray bottle or syringe. An example of a nasal spray bottle is the, "Nasal Spray Pump w/<br>
Safety Clip, Pfeiffer SAP # 60548, which delivers a dose of 0.1mL per squirt and has a<br>
diptube length of 36.05 mm. It can be purchased from Pfeiffer of America of Princeton, NJ.<br>
Intranasal doses of a Y2 receptor-binding peptide such as PYY can range from 0.1 µg/kg to<br>
about 1500 fig/kg. When administered in as an intranasal spray, it is preferable that the<br>
particle size of the spray are between 10 - 100 mm (microns) in size, preferably 20-100 urn<br>
in size.<br>
To promote weight loss, an intranasal dose of a Y2 receptor-binding peptide PYY is<br>
administered at dose high enough to promote satiety but low enough so as not to induce any<br>
unwanted side-effects such as nausea. A preferred intranasal dose of a Y2 receptor-binding<br>
peptide such as PYY(3-36) is about 3 mg - 10 µg/kg weight of the patient, most preferably<br>
about 6 µg/kg weight of the patient. In a standard dose a patient will receive 50 µg to 800 ug,<br>
more preferably about between 100 µg to 400 µg, most preferably 150 µg to about 200 µg.<br>
The a Y2 receptor-binding peptide such as PYY(3-36) is preferably administered at least ten<br>
minutes to one hour prior to eating to prevent nausea but no more than about twelve to<br>
twenty-four hours prior to eating. The patient is dosed at least once a day preferably before<br>
every meal until the patient has lost a desired amount of weight. The patient then receives<br>
maintenance doses at least once a week preferably daily to maintain the weight loss."<br>
As is shown by the data from the following examples, when administered intranasally<br>
to humans using the Y2 receptor-binding peptide formulation of the present invention,<br>
PYY(3-36) was found to reduce appetite. The examples also show that for the first time post-<br>
prandial physiological levels of a PYY peptide could be reached through an intranasal route<br>
of administration using the Y2 receptor-binding peptide formulations of the present invention<br>
in which PYY(3-36) was the Y2 receptor-binding peptide.<br>
The following examples are provided by way of illustration, not limitation.<br>
An exemplary formulation for enhanced nasal mucosal delivery of peptide YY<br>
following the teachings of the instant specification was prepared and evaluated as follows:<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Nasal mucosal Delivery - Permeation Kinetics and Cytotoxicity<br>
1. Organotypic Model<br>
The following methods are generally useful for evaluating nasal mucosal delivery<br>
parameters, kinetics and side effects for peptide YY within the formulations and method of<br>
the invention, as well as for determining the efficacy and characteristics of the various<br>
intranasal delivery-enhancing agents disclosed herein for combinatorial formulation or<br>
coordinate administration with peptide YY.<br>
Permeation kinetics and cytotoxicity are also useful for determining the efficacy and<br>
characteristics of the various mucosal delivery-enhancing agents disclosed herein for<br>
combinatorial formulation or coordinate administration with mucosal delivery-enhancing<br>
agents. In one exemplary protocol, permeation kinetics and lack of unacceptable cytotoxicity<br>
are demonstrated for an intranasal delivery-enhancing agent as disclosed above in<br>
combination with a biologically active therapeutic agent, exemplified by peptide YY.<br>
The EpiAirway system was developed by MatTek Corp (Ashland, MA) as a model of<br>
the pseudostratified epithelium lining the respiratory tract. The epithelial cells are grown on<br>
porous membrane-bottomed cell culture inserts at an air-liquid interface, which results in<br>
differentiation of the cells to a highly polarized morphology. The apical surface is ciliated<br>
with a microvillous ultrastructure and the epithelium produces mucus (the presence of mucin<br>
has been confirmed by immunoblotting). The inserts have a diameter of 0.875 cm, providing<br>
a surface area of 0.6 cm2. The cells are plated onto the inserts at the factory approximately<br>
three weeks before shipping. One "kit" consists of 24 units.<br>
A. On arrival, the units are placed onto sterile supports in 6-well microplates.<br>
Each well receives 5 mL of proprietary culture medium. This DMEM-based medium is<br>
serum free but is supplemented with epidermal growth factor and other factors. The medium<br>
is always tested for endogenous levels of any cytokine or growth factor, which is being<br>
considered for intranasal delivery, but has been free of all cytokines and factors studied to<br>
date except insulin. The 5 mL volume is just sufficient to provide contact to the bottoms of<br>
the units on their stands, but the apical surface of the epithelium is allowed to remain in direct<br>
contact with air. Sterile tweezers are used in this step and in all subsequent steps involving<br>
transfer of units to liquid-containing wells to ensure that no air is trapped between the<br>
bottoms of the units and the medium.<br>
B. The units in their plates are maintained at 37°C in an incubator in an<br>
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 24 hours. At the end of this time the medium is replaced<br>
with fresh medium and the units are returned to the incubator for another 24 hours.<br>
2. Experimental Protocol - Permeation Kinetics<br>
A. A "kit" of 24 EpiAirway units can routinely be employed for evaluating<br>
five different formulations, each of which is applied to quadruplicate wells. Each well is<br>
employed for determination of permeation kinetics (4 time points), transepithelial resistance,<br>
mitochondrial reductase activity as measured by MTT reduction, and cytolysis as measured<br>
by release of LDH. An additional set of wells is employed as controls, which are sham<br>
treated during determination of permeation kinetics, but are otherwise handled identically to<br>
the test sample-containing units for determinations of transepithelial resistance and viability.<br>
The determinations on the controls are routinely also made on quadruplicate units, but<br>
occasionally we have employed triplicate units for the controls and have dedicated the<br>
remaining four units in the kit to measurements of transepithelial resistance and viability on<br>
untreated units or we have frozen and thawed the units for determinations of total LDH levels<br>
to serve as a reference for 100% cytolysis.<br>
B. In all experiments, the nasal mucosal delivery formulation to be studied is<br>
applied to the apical surface of each unit in a volume of 100mL, which is sufficient to cover<br>
the entire apical surface. An appropriate volume of the test formulation at the concentration<br>
applied to the apical surface (no more than 100 mL is generally needed) is set aside for<br>
subsequent determination of concentration of the active material by ELISA or other<br>
designated assay.<br>
C. The units are placed in 6 well plates without stands for the experiment:<br>
each well contains 0.9 mL of medium which is sufficient to contact the porous membrane<br>
bottom of the unit but does not generate any significant upward hydrostatic pressure on the<br>
unit.<br>
D. To minimize potential sources of error and avoid any formation of<br>
concentration gradients, the units are transferred from one 0.9 mL-containing well to another<br>
at each time point in the study. These transfers are made at the following time points, based<br>
on a zero time at which the 100mL volume of test material was applied to the apical surface:<br>
15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes.<br>
E. In between time points the units in their plates are kept in the 37°C<br>
incubator. Plates containing 0.9 mL medium per well are also maintained in the incubator so<br>
that minimal change in temperature occurs during the brief periods when the plates are<br>
removed and the units are transferred from one well to another using sterile forceps.<br>
F. At the completion of each time point, the medium is removed from the well<br>
from which each unit was transferred, and aliquotted into two tubes (one tube receives 700<br>
mL and the other 200 mL) for determination of the concentration of permeated test material<br>
and, in the event that the test material is cytotoxic, for release of the cytosolic enzyme, lactic<br>
dehydrogenase, from the epithelium. These samples are kept in the refrigerator if the assays<br>
are to be conducted within 24 hours, or the samples are subaliquotted and kept frozen at -<br>
80°C until thawed once for assays. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles are to be avoided.<br>
G. In order to minimize errors, all tubes, plates, and wells are prelabeled<br>
before initiating an experiment.<br>
H. At the end of the 120 minute time point, the units are transferred from the<br>
last of the 0.9 mL containing wells to 24-well microplates, containing 0.3 mL medium per<br>
well. This volume is again sufficient to contact the bottoms of the units, but not to exert<br>
upward hydrostatic pressure on the units. The units are returned to the incubator prior to<br>
measurement of transepithelial resistance.<br>
3. Experimental Protocol - Transepithelial Resistance<br>
A. Respiratory airway epithelial cells form tight junctions in vivo as well as in<br>
vitro, restricting the flow of solutes across the tissue. These junctions confer a transepithelial<br>
resistance of several hundred ohms x cm2 in excised airway tissues; in the MatTek EpiAirway<br>
units, the transepithelial resistance (TER) is claimed by the manufacturer to be routinely<br>
around 1000 ohms x cm2. We have found that the TER of control EpiAirway units which<br>
have been sham-exposed during the sequence of steps in the permeation study is somewhat<br>
lower (700-800 ohms x cm2), but, since permeation of small molecules is proportional to the<br>
inverse of the TER, this value is still sufficiently high to provide a major barrier to<br>
permeation. The porous membrane-bottomed units without cells, conversely, provide only<br>
minimal transmembrane resistance (5-20 ohms x cm2).<br>
B. Accurate determinations of TER require that the electrodes of the<br>
ohmmeter be positioned over a significant surface area above and below the membrane, and<br>
that the distance of the electrodes from the membrane be reproducibly controlled. The<br>
method for TER determination recommended by MatTek and employed for all experiments<br>
here employs an "EVOM"™ epithelial voltohmmeter and an "ENDOHM"™ tissue resistance<br>
measurement chamber from World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL.<br>
C. The chamber is initially filled with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) for at least 20 minutes prior to TER determinations in order to equilibrate the<br>
electrodes.<br>
D. Determinations of TER are made with 1.5 mL of PBS in the chamber and<br>
350mL of PBS in the membrane-bottomed unit being measured. The top electrode is<br>
adjusted to a position just above the membrane of a unit containing no cells (but containing<br>
350 mL of PBS) and then fixed to ensure reproducible positioning. The resistance of a cell-<br>
free unit is typically 5-20 ohms x cm2 ("background resistance").<br>
E. Once the chamber is prepared and the background resistance is recorded,<br>
units in a 24-well plate which had just been employed in permeation determinations are<br>
removed from the incubator and individually placed in the chamber for TER determinations.<br>
F. Each unit is first transferred to a petri dish containing PBS to ensure that the<br>
membrane bottom is moistened. An aliquot of 350 uL PBS is added to the unit and then<br>
carefully aspirated into a labeled tube to rinse the apical surface. A second wash of 350 uL<br>
PBS is then applied to the unit and aspirated into the same collection tube.<br>
G. The unit is gently blotted free of excess PBS on its exterior surface only<br>
before being placed into the chamber (containing a fresh 1.5 mL aliquot of PBS). An aliquot<br>
of 350 mL PBS is added to the unit before the top electrode is placed on the chamber and the<br>
TER is read on the EVOM meter.<br>
H. After the TER of the unit is read in the ENDOHM chamber, the unit is<br>
removed, the PBS is aspirated and saved, and the unit is returned with an air interface on the<br>
apical surface to a 24-well plate containing 0.3 mL medium per well.<br>
I. The units are read in the following sequence: all sham-treated controls,<br>
followed by all formulation-treated samples, followed by a second TER reading of each of<br>
the sham-treated controls. After all the TER determinations are complete, the units in the 24-<br>
well microplate are returned to the incubator for determination of viability by MTT reduction.<br>
4. Experimental Protocol - Viability by MTT Reduction<br>
MTT is a cell-permeable tetrazolium salt which is reduced by mitochondrial<br>
dehydrogenase activity to an insoluble colored formazan by viable cells with intact<br>
mitochondrial function or by nonmitochondrial NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity from cells<br>
capable of generating a respiratory burst. Formation of formazan is a good indicator of<br>
viability of epithelial cells since these cells do not generate a significant respiratory burst.<br>
We have employed a MTT reagent kit prepared by MatTek Corp for their units in order to<br>
assess viability.<br>
A. The MTT reagent is supplied as a concentrate and is diluted into a<br>
proprietary DMEM-based diluent on the day viability is to be assayed (typically the afternoon<br>
of the day in which permeation kinetics and TER were determined in the morning). Insoluble<br>
reagent is removed by a brief centrifugation before use. The final MTT concentration is 1<br>
mg/mL<br>
B. The final MTT solution is added to wells of a 24-well microplate at a<br>
volume of 300 mL per well. As has been noted above, this volume is sufficient to contact the<br>
membranes of the EpiAirway units but imposes no significant positive hydrostatic pressure<br>
on the cells.<br>
C. The units are removed from the 24-well plate in which they were placed<br>
after TER measurements, and after removing any excess liquid from the exterior surface of<br>
the units, they are transferred to the plate containing MTT reagent. The units in the plate are<br>
then placed in an incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 3 hours.<br>
D. At the end of the 3-hour incubation, the units containing viable cells will<br>
have turned visibly purple. The insoluble formazan must be extracted from the cells in their<br>
units to quantitate the extent of MTT reduction. Extraction of the formazan is accomplished<br>
by transferring the units to a 24-well microplate containing 2 mL extractant solution per well,<br>
after removing excess liquid from the exterior surface of the units as before. This volume is<br>
sufficient to completely cover both the membrane and the apical surface of the units.<br>
Extraction is allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature in a light-tight chamber.<br>
MTT extractants traditionally contain high concentrations of detergent, and destroy the cells.<br>
E. At the end of the extraction, the fluid from within each unit and the fluid in<br>
its surrounding well are combined and transferred to a tube for subsequent aliquotting into a<br>
96-well microplate (200 mL aliquots are optimal) and determination of absorbance at 570 nm<br>
on a VMax multiwell microplate spectrophotometer. To ensure that turbidity from debris<br>
coming from the extracted units does not contribute to the absorbance, the absorbance at 650<br>
nm is also determined for each well in the VMax and is automatically subtracted from the<br>
absorbance at 570 nm. The "blank" for the determination of formazan absorbance is a 200<br>
mL aliquot of extractant to which no unit had been exposed. This absorbance value is<br>
assumed to constitute zero viability.<br>
F. Two units from each kit of 24 EpiAirway units are left untreated during<br>
determination of permeation kinetics and TER. These units are employed as the positive<br>
control for 100% cell viability. In all the studies we have conducted, there has been no<br>
statistically significant difference in the viability of the cells in these untreated units vs cells<br>
in control units which had been sham treated for permeation kinetics and on which TER<br>
determinations had been performed. The absorbance of all units treated with test<br>
formulations is assumed to be linearly proportional to the percent viability of the cells in the<br>
units at the time of the incubation with MTT. It should be noted that this assay is carried out<br>
typically no sooner than four hours after introduction of the test material to the apical surface,<br>
and subsequent to rinsing of the apical surface of the units during TER determination.<br>
5. Determination of Viability by LDH Release<br>
While measurement of mitochondrial reductase activity by MTT reduction is a<br>
sensitive probe of cell viability, the assay necessarily destroys the cells and therefore can be<br>
carried out only at the end of each study. When cells undergo necrotic lysis, their cytotosolic<br>
contents are spilled into the surrounding medium, and cytosolic enzymes such as lactic<br>
dehydrogenase (LDH) can be detected in this medium. An assay for LDH in the medium can<br>
be performed on samples of medium removed at each time point of the two-hour<br>
determination of permeation kinetics. Thus, cytotoxic effects of formulations which do not<br>
develop until significant time has passed can be detected as well as effects of formulations<br>
which induce cytolysis with the first few minutes of exposure to airway epithelium.<br>
A. The recommended LDH assay for evaluating cytolysis of the EpiAirway<br>
units is based on conversion of lactate to pyruvate with generation of NADH from NAD.<br>
The NADH is then reoxidized along with simultaneous reduction of the tetrazolium salt INT,<br>
catalyzed by a crude "diaphorase" preparation. The formazan formed from reduction of INT<br>
is soluble, so that the entire assay for LDH activity can be carried out in a homogenous<br>
aqueous medium containing lactate, NAD, diaphorase, and INT.<br>
B. The assay for LDH activity is carried out on 50mL aliquots from samples<br>
of "supernatant" medium surrounding an EpiAirway unit and collected at each time point.<br>
These samples were either stored for no longer than 24 h in the refrigerator or were thawed<br>
after being frozen within a few hours after collection. Each EpiAirway unit generates<br>
samples of supernatant medium collected at 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after application of<br>
the test material. The aliquots are all transferred to a 96 well microplate.<br>
C. A 50 mL aliquot of medium which had not been exposed to a unit serves as<br>
a "blank" or negative control of 0% cytotoxicity. We have found that the apparent level of<br>
"endogenous" LDH present after reaction of the assay reagent mixture with the unexposed<br>
medium is the same within experimental error as the apparent level of LDH released by all<br>
the sham-treated control units over the entire time course of 2 hours required to conduct a<br>
permeation kinetics study. Thus, within experimental error, these sham-treated units show no<br>
cytolysis of the epithelial cells over the time course of the permeation kinetics measurements.<br>
D. To prepare a sample of supernatant medium reflecting the level of LDH<br>
released after 100% of the cells in a unit have lysed, a unit which had not been subjected to<br>
any prior manipulations is added to a well of a 6-well microplate containing 0.9 mL of<br>
medium as in the protocol for determination of permeation kinetics, the plate containing the<br>
unit is frozen at -80°C, and the contents of the well are then allowed to thaw. This freeze-<br>
thaw cycle effectively lyses the cells and releases their cytosolic contents, including LDH,<br>
into the supernatant medium. A 50 mL aliquot of the medium from the frozen and thawed<br>
cells is added to the 96-well plate as a positive control reflecting 100% cytotoxicity.<br>
E. To each well containing an aliquot of supernatant medium, a 50mL aliquot<br>
of the LDH assay reagent is added. The plate is then incubated for 30 minutes in the dark.<br>
F. The reactions are terminated by addition of a "stop" solution of 1 M acetic<br>
acid, and within one hour of addition of the stop solution, the absorbance of the plate is<br>
determined at 490 nm.<br>
G. Computation of percent cytolysis is based on the assumption of a linear<br>
relationship between absorbance and cytolysis, with the absorbance obtained from the<br>
medium alone serving as a reference for 0% cytolysis and the absorbance obtained from the<br>
medium surrounding a frozen and thawed unit serving as a reference for 100% cytolysis.<br>
6. ELISA Determinations<br>
The procedures for determining the concentrations of biologically active agents as test<br>
materials for evaluating enhanced permeation of active agents in conjunction with coordinate<br>
administration of mucosal delivery-enhancing agents or combinatorial formulation of the<br>
invention are generally as described above and in accordance with known methods and<br>
specific manufacturer instructions of ELISA kits employed for each particular assay.<br>
Permeation kinetics of the biologically active agent is generally determined by taking<br>
measurements at multiple time points (for example 15 min., 30 min., 60 min. and 120 min)<br>
after the biologically active agent is contacted with the apical epithelial cell surface (which<br>
may be simultaneous with, or subsequent to, exposure of the apical cell surface to the<br>
mucosal delivery-enhancing agent(s)).<br>
The procedures for determining the concentrations of peptide YY neuropeptide Y, and<br>
pancreatic peptide in blood serum, central nervous system (CNS) tissues or fluids, cerebral<br>
spinal fluid (CSF), or other tissues or fluids of a mammalian subject may be determined by<br>
immunologic assay for peptide YY neuropeptide Y, and pancreatic peptide. The procedures<br>
for determining the concentrations of peptide YY neuropeptide Y, and pancreatic peptide as<br>
test materials for evaluating enhanced permeation of active agents in conjunction with<br>
coordinate administration of mucosal delivery-enhancing agents or combinatorial formulation<br>
of the invention are generally as described above and in accordance with known methods and<br>
specific manufacturer instructions for radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme immunoassay<br>
(EIA), and antibody reagents for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence for peptide<br>
YY neuropeptide Y, and pancreatic peptide. Bachem AG (King of Prussia, PA).<br>
TM<br>
EpiAirway tissue membranes are cultured in phenol red and hydrocortisone free<br>
medium (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). The tissue membranes are cultured at 37°C for 48<br>
hours to allow the tissues to equilibrate. Each tissue membrane is placed in an individual well<br>
of a 6-well plate containing 0.9 mL of serum free medium. 100 mL of the formulation (test<br>
sample or control) is applied to the apical surface of the membrane. Triplicate or<br>
quadruplicate samples of each test sample (mucosal delivery-enhancing agent in combination<br>
with a biologically active agent, peptide YY) and control (biologically active agent, peptide<br>
YY, alone) are evaluated in each assay. At each time point (15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes) the<br>
tissue membranes are moved to new wells containing fresh medium. The underlying 0.9 mL<br>
medium samples is harvested at each time point and stored at 4°C for use in ELISA and<br>
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays.<br>
The ELISA kits are typically two-step sandwich ELISAs: the immunoreactive form of<br>
the agent being studied is first "captured" by an antibody immobilized on a 96-well<br>
microplate and after washing unbound material out of the wells, a "detection" antibody is<br>
allowed to react with the bound immunoreactive agent. This detection antibody is typically<br>
conjugated to an enzyme (most often horseradish peroxidase) and the amount of enzyme<br>
bound to the plate in immune complexes is then measured by assaying its activity with a<br>
chromogenic reagent. In addition to samples of supernatant medium collected at each of the<br>
time points in the permeation kinetics studies, appropriately diluted samples of the<br>
formulation (i.e., containing the subject biologically active test agent) that was applied to the<br>
apical surface of the units at the start of the kinetics study are also assayed in the ELISA<br>
plate, along with a set of manufacturer-provided standards. Each supernatant medium sample<br>
is generally assayed in duplicate wells by ELISA (it will be recalled that quadruplicate units<br>
are employed for each formulation in a permeation kinetics determination, generating a total<br>
of sixteen samples of supernatant medium collected over all four time points).<br>
A. It is not uncommon for the apparent concentrations of active test agent in<br>
samples of supernatant medium or in diluted samples of material applied to the apical surface<br>
of the units to lie outside the range of concentrations of the standards after completion of an<br>
ELISA. No concentrations of material present in experimental samples are determined by<br>
extrapolation beyond the concentrations of the standards; rather, samples are rediluted<br>
appropriately to generate concentrations of the test material which can be more accurately<br>
determined by interpolation between the standards in a repeat ELISA.<br>
B. The ELISA for a biologically active test agent, for example, peptide YY, is<br>
unique in its design and recommended protocol. Unlike most kits, the ELISA employs two<br>
monoclonal antibodies, one for capture and another, directed towards a nonoverlapping<br>
determinant for the biologically active test agent, e.g., peptide YY, as the detection antibody<br>
(this antibody is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase). As long as concentrations of peptide<br>
YY that lie below the upper limit of the assay are present in experimental samples, the assay<br>
protocol can be employed as per the manufacturer's instructions, which allow for incubation<br>
of the samples on the ELISA plate with both antibodies present simultaneously. When the<br>
peptide YY levels in a sample are significantly higher than this upper limit, the levels of<br>
immunoreactive peptide YY may exceed the amounts of the antibodies in the incubation<br>
mixture, and some peptide YY which has no detection antibody bound will be captured on<br>
the plate, while some peptide YY which has detection antibody bound may not be captured.<br>
This leads to serious underestimation of the peptide YY levels in the sample (it will appear<br>
that the peptide YY levels in such a sample lie significantly below the upper limit of the<br>
assay). To eliminate this possibility, the assay protocol has been modified:<br>
B.1. The diluted samples are first incubated on the ELISA plate containing the<br>
immobilized capture antibody for one hour in the absence of any detection antibody. After<br>
the one hour incubation, the wells are washed free of unbound material.<br>
B.2. The detection antibody is incubated with the plate for one hour to permit<br>
formation of immune complexes with all captured antigen. The concentration of detection<br>
antibody is sufficient to react with the maximum level of peptide YY which has been bound<br>
by the capture antibody. The plate is then washed again to remove any unbound detection<br>
antibody.<br>
B.3. The peroxidase substrate is added to the plate and incubated for fifteen<br>
minutes to allow color development to take place.<br>
B.4. The "stop" solution is added to the plate, and the absorbance is read at<br>
450 nm as well as 490 nm in the VMax microplate spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the<br>
colored product at 490 nm is much lower than that at 450 nm, but the absorbance at each<br>
wavelength is still proportional to concentration of product. The two readings ensure that the<br>
absorbance is linearly related to the amount of bound peptide YY over the working range of<br>
the VMax instrument (we routinely restrict the range from 0 to 2.5 OD, although the<br>
instrument is reported to be accurate over a range from 0 to 3.0 OD). The amount of peptide<br>
YY in the samples is determined by interpolation between the OD values obtained for the<br>
different standards included in the ELISA. Samples with OD readings outside the range<br>
obtained for the standards are rediluted and run in a repeat ELISA.<br>

membranes were placed in individual wells of a 24 well culture plate in 0.3 mL of clean<br>
medium and the trans epithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured using the EVOM<br>
Epithelial Voltohmmeter and an Endohm chamber (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,<br>
FL). The top electrode was adjusted to be close to, but not in contact with, the top surface of<br>
the membrane. Tissues were removed, one at a time, from their respective wells and basal<br>
surfaces were rinsed by dipping in clean PBS. Apical surfaces were gently rinsed twice with<br>
PBS. The tissue unit was placed in the Endohm chamber, 250 mL of PBS added to the insert,<br>
the top electrode replaced and the resistance measured and recorded. Following<br>
measurement, the PBS was decanted and the tissue insert was returned to the culture plate.<br>
All TER values are reported as a function of the surface area of the tissue.<br>
The final numbers were calculated as:<br>
TER of cell membrane = (Resistance (R) of Insert with membrane - R of<br>
blank Insert) X Area of membrane (0.6 cm2).<br>
The effect of pharmaceutical formulations comprising peptide YY and intranasal<br>
delivery-enhancing agents on TER measurements across the EpiAirway™ Cell Membrane<br>
(mucosal epithelial cell layer) is shown in Figure 1. A decrease in TER value relative to the<br>
control value (control = approximately 1000 ohms-cm2; normalized to 100.) indicates a<br>
decrease in cell membrane resistance and an increase in mucosal epithelial cell permeability.<br>
Exemplary peptide YY formulation, Formulation P, showed the greatest decrease in<br>
cell membrane resistance. (Table 2). The results indicate that the exemplary formulation<br>
(e.g., Formulation P) reduces the resistance of the membrane to less than 1% of the control at<br>
the concentrations tested. The values shown are the average of three replicates of each<br>
formulation. Formulations A and B are controls prepared by reconstituting peptide YY<br>
(Bachem AG, King of Prussia, PA) containing 60mg peptide Y3.36 in 100 ml of phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 or 5.0. Peptide YY without mucosal delivery enhancers did<br>
not decrease the resistance.<br>
The results indicate that an exemplary formulation for enhanced intranasal delivery of<br>
peptide YY (e.g., Formulation P) decreases cell membrane resistance and significantly<br>
increases mucosal epithelial cells permeability. The exemplary formulations will enhance<br>
intranasal delivery of peptide YY to the blood serum or to the central nervous system tissue<br>
or fluid. The results indicate that these exemplary formulations when contacted with a<br>
mucosal epithelium yield significant increases in mucosal epithelial cell permeability to<br>
peptide YY.<br>
Influence of Pharmaceutical Formulations Comprising Peptide YY and<br>
Intranasal Delivery-Enhancing Agents on Transepithelial Resistance (TER)<br>
of EpiAirway Cell Membrane<br>
Permeation kinetics as measured by ELISA Assay: The effect of pharmaceutical<br>
formulations of the present invention comprising peptide YY and intranasal delivery-<br>
enhancing agents on the permeation of peptide YY across the EpiAirway™ Cell Membrane<br>
(mucosal epithelial cell layer) is measured as described above. The results are shown in<br>
Table 3. Permeation of peptide YY across the EpiAirway™ Cell Membrane is measured by<br>
ELISA assay.<br>
For the exemplary intranasal formulations (e.g., Formulation P) of the present<br>
invention, the greatest increase in peptide YY permeation occurred in Formulation P as<br>
shown in Table 3. The procedure uses an ELISA assay to determine the concentration of<br>
biologically active peptide YY that has permeated the epithelial cells into the surrounding<br>
medium over multiple time points. The results show increased permeation of peptide YY in<br>
Formulation P compared to Formulation A or B (peptide YY control formulation; 60 mg<br>
peptide YY3-36 in 100 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 or 5.0; Bachem AG,<br>
King of Prussia, PA). On average the cumulative increase in permeation at 120 minutes<br>
using Formulation P exemplary intranasal formulation is about 1195 fold greater than<br>
Formulations A or B controls.<br>
MTTAssay: The MTT assays were performed using MTT-100, MatTek kits. 300 mL of<br>
the MTT solution was added into each well. Tissue inserts were gently rinsed with clean<br>
PBS and placed in the MTT solution. The samples were incubated at 370C for 3 hours.<br>
After incubation the cell culture inserts were then immersed with 2.0 mL of the extractant<br>
solution per well to completely cover each insert. The extraction plate was covered and<br>
sealed to reduce evaporation. Extraction proceeds overnight at RT in the dark. After the<br>
extraction period was complete, the extractant solution was mixed and pipetted into a 96-<br>
well microtiter plate. Triplicates of each sample were loaded, as well as extractant blanks.<br>
The optical density of the samples was then measured at 550 run on a plate reader<br>
(Molecular Devices).<br>
The MTT assay on an exemplary formulation for enhanced nasal mucosal<br>
delivery of peptide YY following the teachings of the instant specification (e.g.,<br>
Formulation P) compared to control formulation (Formulations A or B) are shown in<br>
Table 4. The results for formulations comprising peptide YY and one or more intransal<br>
delivery enhancing agents, for example, Formulation P (experiment performed in three<br>
replicates) indicate that there is minimal toxic effect of this exemplary embodiment on<br>
viability of the mucosal epithelial tissue.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Formulation P (Peptide YY) of the Present Invention In Combination With<br>
Triamcinolone Acetonide Corticosteroid Improves Cell Viability<br>
The present example provides an in vitro study to determine the permeability and<br>
reduction in epithelial mucosal inflammation of an intranasally administered peptide YY,<br>
for example, human peptide YY, in combination with a steroid composition, for example,<br>
triamcinolone acetonide, and further in combination with one or more intranasal delivery-<br>
enhancing agents. The study involves determination of epithelial cell permeability by<br>
TER assay and reduction in epithelial mucosal inflammation as measured by cell viability<br>
in an MTT assay by application of an embodiment comprising peptide YY and<br>
triamcinolone acetonide.<br>
Formulation P (see Table 1 above) is combined in a formulation with<br>
triamcinolone acetonide at a dosage of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, or 50 mg. Normal dose of<br>
triamcinolone acetonide, (Nasacort , Aventis Pharmaceuticals) for seasonal allergic<br>
rhinitis, is 55 mg per spray. Formulation P in combination with triamcinolone acetonide<br>
corticosteroid improves cell viability as measured by the MTT assay, while maintaining<br>
epithelial cell permeability as measured by TER and ELISA assays.<br>
According to the methods and formulations of the invention, measurement of<br>
permeability of Formulation P in the presence or absence of triamcinolone acetonide is<br>
performed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) assays in an EpiAirway™ cell<br>
membrane. TER assays of Formulation P plus triamcinolone acetonide at a concentration<br>
of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, or 50 mg per spray indicate that peptide YY permeability did not decrease<br>
and was equal to permeability of Formulation P alone. Formulation P plus triamcinolone<br>
acetonide at a triamcinolone acetonide concentration between 0 and 50 µg per spray is<br>
typically, at least 10-fold to 100-fold greater than permeability of Formulations A or B<br>
(peptide YY control).<br>
According to the methods and formulations of the invention, measurement of<br>
permeability of Formulation P in the presence or absence of triamcinolone acetonide is<br>
performed by ELISA assay in an EpiAirway™ cell membrane. Similar to the TER assay<br>
above, ELISA assay of Formulation P plus triamcinolone acetonide at a concentration of<br>
0.5, 2.0, 5.0, or 50mg per spray indicate that peptide YY permeability did not decrease<br>
and was equal to permeability of Formulation P alone. Formulation P plus triamcinolone<br>
acetonide at a triamcinolone acetonide concentration between 0 and 50 mg per spray is<br>
typically greater than permeability of Formulations A or B (peptide YY control).<br>
According to the methods and formulations of the invention, MTT assay<br>
measured cell viability of Formulation P in the presence or absence of triamcinolone<br>
acetonide. Typically, addition of triamcinolone acetonide (at a concentration of 0.5, 2.0,<br>
5.0, or 50 mg per spray) to Formulation P improves cell viability compared to<br>
Formulation P in the absence of triamcinolone acetonide.<br>
Addition of triamcinolone acetonide to Formulation P increases cell viability and<br>
maintains epithelial permeability as measured by TER assay comparable to Formulation<br>
P in the absence of triamcinolone acetonide.<br>
Reduction in epithelial mucosal inflammation of an intranasally administered<br>
peptide YY is accomplished with an intranasal formulation of peptide YY in combination<br>
with one or more steroid or corticosteroid compound(s) typically high potency<br>
compounds or formulations, but also in certain cases medium potency, or low potency<br>
compounds or formulations. Overall potency (equivalent dosages) of high, medium, and<br>
low potency steroids are given. Typically, an intranasal formulation of peptide YY in<br>
combination with a high potency steroid composition includes, but is not limited to,<br>
betamethasone (0.6 to 0.75 mg dosage), or dexamethasone (0.75 mg dosage). In an<br>
alternative formulation, an intranasal formulation of peptide YY in combination with a<br>
medium potency steroid composition includes, but is not limited to, methylprednisolone<br>
(4 mg dosage), triamcinolone (4 mg dosage), or prednisolone (5 mg dosage). In a further<br>
alternative formulation, an intranasal formulation of peptide YY in combination with a<br>
low potency steroid composition includes, but is not limited to hydrocortisone (20 mg<br>
dosage) or cortisone (25 mg dosage).<br>

Intranasal Formulation Development<br>
Peptides and proteins are relatively fragile molecules compared to low-molecular-weight<br>
therapeutics. The objective of the formulation development phase was to identify a<br>
candidate formulation suitable for intranasal delivery. In order to achieve this goal,<br>
numerous candidates were tested in order to identify a formulation with acceptable drug<br>
stability, delivery across the nasal mucosa, toxicity and preservative effectiveness.<br>
Initially, the effect of pH was examined. Figure 1 shows the stability of PYY 3-36 at high<br>
temperature (40 °C) at various pHs from 3.0 to 7.4. At physiological pH, there was<br>
substantial loss of drug at elevated temperature. Best stability was achieved at about pH<br>
5.0. This pH was chosen for further formulation optimization.<br>
In order to further optimize stability, various stabilizing agents were tested for their<br>
ability to facilitate passage of drug across the nasal mucosa. The enhancers tested were<br>
chosen based on their ability to open tight junctions with limited cellular toxicity. To<br>
accomplish this, a primary human epithelial cell model (EpiAirway, MatTek, Inc.,<br>
Ashland MA) was employed. This cell line forms a pseudo-stratified columnar epithelial<br>
cell layer with tight junctions similar to the respiratory epithelium found in the nose.<br>
Drug formulations were placed on the apical side of the tissue layer, and drug<br>
quantitation carried out for the basal media. The extent of tight junction opening was<br>
measured by decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Cell viability<br>
and cytotoxicity were monitored by MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Data from a<br>
representative screening experiment are depicted in Figures 2-5.<br>
Figure 2 shows the data for TEER. In some cases there was little or no decrease in TEER<br>
compared to the control, indicating tight junctions which remain closed. In other cases<br>
there was a substantial drop in TEER indicating tight junction opening. The results<br>
demonstrate that the in vitro cell model is capable of discriminating the ability of<br>
different formulations to open the tight junctions.<br>
In the candidate formulations tested the cell viabilities (Figure 3; MTT) were good and<br>
cyctotoxicities (Figure 4; LDH) were low.<br>
In total, over 200 different formulations were tested, reflecting the high-throughput<br>
nature of the in vitro screening model. Using all the available data. a multivariate<br>
analysis was conducted to elucidate the effect each formulation component exerted on<br>
each of the 7 output variables (drug permeability, osmolality, stability at refrigerated and<br>
accelerated conditions, TEER, and MTT and LDH assays). The multivariate analysis<br>
consisted of an initial analysis of each formulation component for some level of<br>
correlation with output parameters (p
regression or stepwise logistic selection model was used. The results suggest that one<br>
excipient correlated to osmolality and toxicity (r2 = 0.91 and 0.27, respectively), two<br>
correlated to PYY3-36 permeation (r2 = 0.44), three affected stability (r2 = 0.24), and five<br>
impacted paracellular resistance (r2 = 0.55). The best formulations determined by this<br>
process increased at least 30-75 fold the PYY 3-36 transport compared to simple buffer<br>
solutions.<br>
Based on these analyses, an optimized PYY 3-36 formulation was selected for further<br>
development. This optimized formulation contained two stabilizers, two permeation<br>
enhancers, one chelating agent, and one preservative in a sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0.<br>
This formulation passed the USP Preservative Effectiveness Test. The synergistic<br>
contributions of the various components on drug permeation is presented in Figure 5.<br>
Compared to simple buffer formulations at the same osmolality, the optimized<br>
formulation exhibits more than 100-fold increased drug permeation.<br>
Finally, pre-clinical and clinical batches of the optimized formulation were prepared and<br>
placed on stability at 5 °C and 25 °C in the final product packaGlng. Preliminary data,<br>
depicted in Table 8 reveal essentially no loss of drug at one month at either 5 °C or 25<br>
°C.<br>
Preclinical Studies<br>
To date, a series of six preclinical studies in rats, rabbits, and dogs have been completed.<br>
Plasma PYY3-36 levels in all species were determined by a validated proprietary<br>
radioimmunoassay method.<br>
Bioavailability (the molar fraction of drug identified in plasma divided by the amount<br>
administered nasally) in rats was determined to be approximately 6%, and in rabbits is<br>
approximately 8%. These values may understate the true bioavailability, as any peptide<br>
degradation in plasma before sampling, or degradation after sampling despite the<br>
presence of a proteinase inhibitor, will decrease the measured bioavailability.<br>
Nasal toxicity has been evaluated in rat and rabbit models for up to 14 consecutive days<br>
at doses 50x the expected human clinical dose on a mg/kg basis. There were no<br>
microscopic or gross pathological findings related to the test article. There were no<br>
clinical observations.<br>
Systemic toxicity following intravenous administration was evaluated in rat and rabbit<br>
models. At IV doses up to approx 160x the expected human dose (400 ug/kg in the rat<br>
and 205 ug/kg in the rabbit) there were no test article related microscopic or macroscopic<br>
findings.<br>
Cardiovascular toxicity was assessed in the anesthetized dog model in a dose ranGlng<br>
study design. The highest dosage, an infusion of PYY3-36 up to 24ug/kg over 60 minutes<br>
corresponded to 33x the expected human dose on a body surface area basis. The resultan<br>
plasma levels, 30 ng/mL, was approximately 380x the basal canine plasma level. At this<br>
plasma level, there was no effect on arterial blood pressure, femoral blood flow, or QTc<br>
and only minor changes in heart rate (increase from 123 to 148 bpm mean) and<br>
respiratory rate (decrease from 54 to 36) were noted.<br>
Pharmacokinetic data was collected in these preclinical studies. From one study in rats,<br>
the plasma levels following intranasal administration at various doses are shown in<br>
Figures 6, 7and 8. Figure 6 shows PYY3-36 is seen in the plasma within 5 minutes, peak<br>
plasma concentrations (Tmax) are reached in 10-15 minutes, and the terminal eliminatior<br>
half life is approx 15 minutes. Both Cmax and AUCo-tare linear with respect to intranasal<br>
dose.<br>
Clinical Studies<br>
A dose ranGlng clinical trial has been initiated with the goal of establishing safety, PK,<br>
and bioavailability of the intranasal formulation of PYY3-36. To date, patients have been<br>
enrolled in the first two of five dose cohorts. One patient reported a taste in the back of<br>
his throat; there have been no other adverse events to date.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Formulation, preclinical, and initial clinical work have begun on an intranasal<br>
formulation of PYY3.36. The approach to formulation has resulted in a more than one<br>
hundred fold increase in transmembrane permeability of this 4 kD peptide with no<br>
increase in cellular toxicity. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a considerable safety<br>
marGln for nasal, cardiovascular, and systemic toxicity for PYY3.36. On the basis on the<br>
ongoing dose ranGlng clinical studies, chronic administration weight loss studies are<br>
planned.<br><br>

CLINICAL PROTOCOL<br>
NASAL ABSORPTION OF INTRANASAL PEPTIDE YY3-36 (PYY3-36) IN<br>
HEALTHY HUMAN SUBJECTS<br>
Object of the present study:<br>
The object of the present study was to evaluate the absorption of intranasally<br>
administered PYY3-36 into the blood stream from the nose. This was a phase I, in clinic,<br>
single dose, doses escalation study involving fasted, normal, healthy male and female<br>
volunteers. Ascending doses of intranasal PYY3-36 were evaluated between 20 µg to<br>
200 µg to evaluate safety, nasal tolerance and absorption of PYY3-36. Assessment of<br>
appetite sensation in each individual was also evaluated.<br>
PYY3-36 was administered to 15 healthy humans divided into 5 Groups of 3<br>
individuals each.<br>
Group I.<br>
The first group was administered by an intranasal spray 20 µg of PYY3-36 in a 0.1 ml<br>
solution.<br>
Group II<br>
The second group received intranasally 50 µg of PYY3.36 in a 0.1 ml solution.<br>
Group III<br>
The third group received intranasally 100 µg of PYY3.36 in a 0.1 ml solution.<br>
Group IV<br>
The fourth group received intranasally 150 µg of PYY3-36 in a 0.1 ml solution.<br>
Group V<br>
The fifth group received intranasally 200 µg of PYY3-36 in a 0.1 ml solution.<br>
Blood samples were taken collected and the plasma concentrations of PYY were<br>
determined at 0 (i.e., pre-dose), 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 minutes post-dose. The<br>
subjects were then fed and a blood sample taken and the concentration of PYY was<br>
determined 30 minutes postprandial. Plasma concentrations of PYY3-36 were determined<br>
using a validated analytical procedure.<br>
For each subject, the following PK parameters were calculated, whenever<br>
possible, based on the plasma concentrations of PYY3.36, according to the model<br>
independent approach:<br>
Cmax Maximum observed concentration.<br>
tmax Time to maximum concentration.<br>
AUCo-t Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the<br>
time of last measurable concentration, calculated by the<br>
linear trapezoidal rule.<br>
The following parameters were calculated when the data permits accurate estimation of<br>
these parameters:<br>
AUC0-oo Area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to<br>
infinity, calculated using the formula:<br><br>
where Ct is the last measurable concentration and Ke is the<br>
apparent terminal phase rate constant.<br>
Ke Apparent terminal phase rate constant, where Ke is the<br>
magnitude of the slope of the linear regression of the log<br>
concentration versus time profile during the terminal phase.<br>
t1/2 Apparent terminal phase half-life (whenever possible),<br>
where t1/2 = (1n2)/Ke.<br>
PK calculations were performed using commercial software such as WinNonlin<br>
(Pharsight Corporation, Version 3.3, or higher). The results are shown in the graphs<br>
below.<br>
Discussion and Conclusion.<br>
Background:<br>
Each dosing group included three subjects who were dosed intranasally once with a<br>
formulation of this invention that contained a specified dose of synthetic, pyrogen-free<br>
human PYY 3-36. Five dosing groups were organized, with escalating doses of PYY 3-36<br>
in the formulation. Blood samples were drawn at specified intervals into blood collection<br>
tubes that contained lithium heparin (to inhibit coagulation) and aprotinin (to preserve<br>
PYY 3-36). Plasma from each blood sample was collected by centrifugation and stored in<br>
frozen aliquots. One frozen aliquot of each blood sample was shipped to Nastech<br>
Analytical Services and arrived frozen. Each sample was stored frozen until assayed for<br>
PYY concentration by radioimmunoassay (RIA).<br>
Observations:<br>
Group 1: This group of subjects was dosed with 20 micrograms of PYY 3-36. Plasma<br>
PYY concentrations for the subjects varied from a minimum of "less than 20 pg/ml"<br>
(below the lower limit of quantitation of the radioimmunoassay) to a maximum of 159<br>
pg/ml. The trends of concentrations observed are not consistent with significant<br>
absorption of drug into the blood of the subjects studied.<br>
Group 2: This group of subjects was dosed with 50 micrograms of PYY 3-36. Plasma<br>
PYY concentrations for the subjects varied from a minimum of 50 pg/ml to a maximum<br>
of 255 pg/ml. The trends of concentrations observed are consistent with significant<br>
absorption of drug into the blood of the subjects studied.<br>
Group 3: This group of subjects was dosed with 100 micrograms of PYY 3-36. Plasma<br>
PYY concentrations for the subjects varied from a minimum of 87 pg/ml to a maximum<br>
of 785 pg/ml. The trends of concentrations observed are consistent with significant<br>
absorption of drug into the blood of the subjects studied.<br>
Group 4: This group of subjects was dosed with 150 micrograms of PYY 3-36. Plasma<br>
PYY concentrations for the subjects varied from a minimum of 45 pg/ml to a maximum<br>
of 2022 pg/ml. The trends of concentrations observed are consistent with significant<br>
absorption of drug into the blood of the subjects studied.<br>
Group 5: This group of subjects was dosed with 200 micrograms of PYY 3-36. Plasma<br>
PYY concentrations for the subjects varied from a minimum of 48 pg/ml to a maximum<br>
of 1279 pg/ml. The trends of concentrations observed are consistent with significant<br>
absorption of drug into the blood of the subjects studied.<br>
These results are consistent with a dose dependent absorption of PYY3-36.<br>
Additional Observations and data:<br>
Summary of findings:<br>
• At intranasal doses of 50 µg - 200 µg, there is dose dependent plasma uptake of<br>
PYY.<br>
• The duration of elevated plasma concentrations is considerably longer than would<br>
have been predicted, with an elimination half life calculated at 55 minutes.<br>
• Cmax and AUC 0-t show good linearity with dose.<br>
• There is considerable inter-subject variability at a given dose.<br>
• Surprisingly, this study failed to detect postprandial elevation of PYY although<br>
the quantity of food actually eaten was not measured and if too little was eaten<br>
could explain the observations.<br>
• Visual-analog scale hunger questions suggest decreased hunger with increasing<br>
doses of PYY.<br>
• Nausea and lightheadedness appear to be related to very high plasma<br>
concentration of PYY.<br>
• Values based on the assay described in this specification appear to be 2-3x higher<br>
than those previously reported in the literature.<br>
Notes:<br>
• In some cases pMol/L are used as the PYY measurement units; in other analyses,<br>
pg/mL are used. The conversion factor is pmol/L * 4.05 = pg/mL.<br>
• In some cases, the 150-minute time point is displayed in plots. Strictly speaking,<br>
this is a postprandial datapoint, and may therefore confound PK evaluation.<br>
However, an unexpected finding described in more detail below is that the 30<br>
minute postprandial timepoint is no different from the baseline value.<br>
The Tmax of 24 minutes is typical for a nasal product. The elimination half life of 55<br>
minutes is considerably longer than would have been expected. Literature references<br>
indicated a t1/2 typically of 5-10 minutes. The elimination half life may also be affected<br>
by some continued uptake from the nasal mucosa occurring after the Tmax and by<br>
formulation components that effect peptide metabolism. Alternatively, because the assay<br>
described in this specification employs an extraction procedure, the assay will capture<br>
both free and protein-bound PYY, whereas an assay which does not use an extraction<br>
may assay primarily the free fraction.<br>
From this analysis of mean VAS change from baseline (mean of 10, 30, and 60 minute<br>
values minus baseline) vs dose, one observes:<br>
Example 9<br>
Buccal formulation of PYY3-36<br>
(Prophetic)<br>
Bilayer tablets are prepared in the following manner. An adhesive layer is<br>
prepared by weighing 70 parts by weight polyethylene oxide (Polyox 301N; Union<br>
Carbide), 20 parts by weight polyacrylic acid (Carbopol 934P; B.F. Goodrich), and 10<br>
parts by weight of a compressible xylitol/carboxymethyl cellulose filler (Xylitab 200;<br>
Xyrofin). These ingredients are mixed by rolling in ajar for 3 minutes. The mixture is<br>
then transferred to an evaporating dish and quickly wet granulated with absolute ethanol<br>
to a semi-dough-like consistency. This mass is immediately and rapidly forced through a<br>
14 mesh (1.4 mm opening) stainless steel screen, to which the wet granules adhered. The<br>
screen is covered with perforated aluminum foil, and the wet granules are dried overnight<br>
at 30° C. The dried granules are removed from the screen and then passed through a 20<br>
mesh (0.85 mm opening) screen to further reduce the size of the granules. Particles that<br>
do not pass through the 20 mesh screen are ground briefly with a mortar and pestle to<br>
minimize the amount of fines and then passed through the 20 mesh screen. The resulting<br>
granules are then placed in a mixing jar, and 0.25 parts by weight stearic acid and 0.06<br>
parts by weight mint flavor (Universal Flavors) are added and blended to the granules.<br>
The final percentages by weight of the ingredients are thus 69.78% polyethylene oxide,<br>
9.97% compressible xylitol/carboxymethyl cellulose filler, 19.94% polyacrylic acid,<br>
0.25% stearic acid, and 0.06% mint flavor. A 50 mg amount of this mixture is placed on a<br>
0.375 inch diameter die and precompressed on a Carver Press Model C with 0.25 metric<br>
ton pressure for a 3 second dwell time to form the adhesive layer.<br>
The active layer is prepared by weighing 49.39 parts by weight of mannitol, 34.33<br>
parts by weight of hydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucel L F; Aqualon, Wilmington, Del.) and<br>
15.00 parts by weight of sodium taurocholate (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.), and mixing by<br>
rolling in ajar for 3 minutes. The mixture is then transferred to an evaporating dish and<br>
quickly wet granulated with absolute ethanol to a semi-dough-like consistency. This mass<br>
is immediately and rapidly forced through a 14 mesh stainless steel screen, to which the<br>
wet granules adher. The screen is covered with perforated aluminum foil, and the<br>
granules dried at 30° C. The dried granulation is then passed sequentially through 20, 40<br>
(0.425 mm opening), and 60 (0.25 mm opening) mesh screens to reduce particle size<br>
further. Particles that do not pass through a screen are briefly ground with a mortar and<br>
pestle to minimize fines and then passed through the screen. The screened particles were<br>
weighed, and then 0.91 parts by weight of PYY3-36 and 0.06 parts by weight of FD&amp;C<br>
yellow #6HT aluminum lake dye are sequentially blended with the dry granulation by<br>
geometric dilution. The dyed granulation is then placed in a mixing jar and blended with<br>
0.25 parts by weight magnesium stearate (lubricant) and 0.06 parts by weight mint flavor<br>
by rolling for 3 minutes. A 50 mg sample of this material is placed on top of the partially<br>
compressed adhesive layer and both layers are then compressed at 1.0 ton pressure for a 3<br>
second dwell time to yield a bilayer tablet suitable for buccal delivery.<br>
This procedure results in a Glngival tablet wherein the active layer contains 0.91%<br>
by weight of PYY3-36, 15% by weight of NaTC, and 84.09% by weight of filler,<br>
lubricant, colorant, formulation aids, or flavoring agents.<br>
Example 10<br>
A study was conducted comparing the ability of endotoxin-free PYY 3-36 vs non-<br>
endotoxin-free PYY 3-36 to permeate the bronchial epithelium according of to the<br>
procedure of Example 1. It was determined that about twice the amount of enodotoxin-<br>
free PYY3-36 permeated the bronchial epithelium as compared to PYY3-36 formulation<br>
that contained endotoxin.<br>
Both formulations contained Chlorobutanol 2.5mg/ml, 2.mg/ml of DDPC, 10<br>
mg/ml of albumin, lmg/ml of EDTA and 45 mg/ml of M-B-CD. One formulation<br>
contained endotoxin-free PYY3-36 and the other formulation contained 70 EUs or<br>
greater of endotoxin.<br>
The average MTT of the PYY3-36 formulation containing endotoxin was 91.72%<br>
while the endotoxin-free PYY3-36 formulation had an average MTT of 100.16%.<br>
The average permeation of the PYY3-36 formulation containing endotoxin was<br>
5.36%, while the average permeation of the endotoxin-free PYY3-36 formulation was<br>
10.75%.<br>

amino acid mixture (total concentration of [--NH2] groups=0.61 moles) is dissolved in<br>
760 mL of 1N sodium hydroxide solution (0.7625 equivalents) at room temperature.<br>
After stirring for 20 minutes, benzene sulfonyl chloride (78 ml, 1 eq.) is added over a 20<br>
minute period. The reaction mixture is then stirred for 2.5 hours, without heating. As<br>
some precipitation may occur, additional NaOH solution (2N) may be added to the<br>
solution until it reaches pH 9.3. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room<br>
temperature. Thereafter, the mixture is acidified using dilute hydrochloric acid (38%, 1:4)<br>

for 30 minutes at room temperature, benzene sulfonyl chloride (108 mL, 0.86 moles) is<br>
added portionwise into the amino acid solution over a 15 minute period. After stirring for<br>
2.5 hours at room temperature, the pH of the reaction mixture (pH 5) is adjusted to pH 9<br>
with additional 2N sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight<br>
at room temperature. Thereafter, the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 2.5 by<br>
addition of dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (4:1, H2O: HC1) and a precipitate of<br>
modified amino acids is formed. The upper layer is discarded and the resulting yellow<br>
precipitate is isolated by decantation, washed with water and dissolved in 2N sodium<br>
hydroxide (2N). The solution is reduced in vacuo to give a yellow solid, which is<br>
lyophilized overnight.<br>
An 86 g (0.85 moles of NH2) mixture of amino acids (see Table in Example 20) is<br>
dissolved in 637 mL (1.5 eq.) of aqueous 2N sodium hydroxide solution. After stirring<br>
for 10 minutes at room temperature, benzoyl chloride (99 mL, 0.85 moles) is added<br>
portionwise into the amino acid solution over a 10 minute period. After stirring for 2.5<br>
hours at room temperature, the pH of the reaction mixture (pH 12) is adjusted to pH 2.5<br>
using dilute hydrochloric acid (4:1, H2O: HC1) and a precipitate of modified amino acids<br>
is formed. After settling for 1 hour, the resulting precipitate is isolated by decantation,<br>
washed with water and dissolved in sodium hydroxide (2N). This solution is then reduced<br>
in vacuo to give crude modified amino acids as a white solid ( expected yield 220.5 g).<br>

chloride (68.7 mL, 0.38 mol, 1.25 eq.) is then added to the amino acid solution over a 20<br>
minute period at room temperature. After stirring for 2 hours at room temperature, a<br>
precipitate appears. The precipitate is dissolved by adding 200 mL of additional 2N<br>
sodium hydroxide solution. After stirring for an additional 30 minutes, dilute aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid solution (4:1, H2O: HC1) is added until the pH of the reaction mixture<br>
reaches 2.6. A precipitate of modified amino acids formed and is recovered by<br>
decantation. This material is dissolved in 2N sodium hydroxide and dried in vacuo co to<br>
give a white solid. Expected yield of crude modified amino acids is 84.6 g, 77%).<br>

L-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester Hydrochloride (15 g, 0.084 mole) is dissolved in<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) (100 mL) and to this is added pyridine (30 mL). A solution of<br>
hippuryl chloride (16.6 g, 0084 moles in 100 mL DMF) is immediately added to the<br>
amino acid ester solution in two portions. The reaction mixture is stirred at room<br>
temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is then reduced in vacuo and dissolved in 1N<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide. The solution is heated at 70° C. for 3 hours in order to<br>
hydrolyze the methyl ester to a free carboxyl group. Thereafter, the solution is acidified<br>
to pH 2.25 using dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (1:3 HC1/H2O). A gum-like<br>
precipitate is formed and this is recovered and dissolved in 1N sodium hydroxide. The<br>
solution is reduced in vacuo to afford an expected 18.6 g of crude modified amino acid<br>
product. After recrystallization from acetonitrile, pure modified phenylalanine (expected<br>
yield 12 g) is recovered as a white powder. m.p. 223-225° C.<br>

Preparation of the Sodium Salt of Carrier C<br>
A 2L round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser<br>
is charged with a suspension of 3-(4-aminophenyl)propio- nic acid (15.0 g. 0.084 moles.<br>
1.0 equiv.) in dichloromethane (250 ml). Chlorotrimethylsilane (18.19 g, 0.856 moles,<br>
2.0 equiv.) is added in one portion, and the mixture is heated to reflux for 1.5 h under<br>
argon. The reaction is allowed to cool to room temperature and is placed in an ice bath<br>
(internal temperature 
containing triethylamine (25.41 g., 0.251 moles, 3.0 equiv.). The triethylamine is added<br>
dropwise over 15 min, and a yellow solid forms during the addition. The funnel is<br>
replaced by another addition funnel containing a solution of 2,3-dimethoxybenzoylchlo-<br>
ride (I 8.31 g, 0.091 moles, 1.09 equiv.) in dichloromethane (100 mL). The solution is<br>

g, 0.329 mmol, 1.00 eq), and xylenes (100 mL) are added to a 1 L, four-neck flask fitted<br>
with a magnetic stir bar, a thermometer, and a condenser. The flask is placed in a sand<br>
bath and heating of the cloudy white mixture begun. The reaction mixture clears to a<br>
yellow solution around 90° C. Most of the volatile organics (xylenes and acetic acid) are<br>
distilled into the Dean-Stark trap over three hours (135-146° C). Distillation is continued<br>
for another hour (a total of 110 mL distilled), during which the pot temperature slowly<br>
rises to 204° C. and the distillate slows to a trickle. The residue is poured off while still<br>
hot into an aluminum tray. Upon cooling a brittle yellow glass forms. The solid is ground<br>
to a fine powder. The oligo(4-methylsalicylate) received is used without further<br>
purification.<br>

aminocaprylic acid (41.8 g, 262 mol, 798 eq), and water (20 mL) are added to a 1 L<br>
round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, condenser, and an addition fuel.<br>
The white cloudy mixture is treated with a solution of oligo(4-methylsalicylate) (44.7 g,<br>
0.329 mmol 1.0 eq) and dioxane (250 mL), added over thirty minutes. The reaction<br>
mixture is heated to 90°C. for 3 hours (at which time the reaction is determined to have<br>
finished, by HPLC). The clear orange reaction mixture is cooled to 30°C. and acidified to<br>
pH=2 with 50% aqueous sulfuric acid (64 g). The resulting solid is isolated by filtration.<br>
The white solid is recrystallized from 1170 mL of 50% ethanol-water. The solid is<br>
recovered by filtration and is dried over 18 hours in a 50°C. vacuum oven. The N-(4-<br>
methylsalicyloyl)-8-ami- nocaprylic acid is isolated as a white solid (30.88 g, 52%);<br>
mp=113-114°. Analysis: C6H23NO4: C, 65.51; H, 7.90; N, 4.77.<br>
An aqueous solution of PYY(3-36) is then prepared and mixed with one or more<br>
of the carrier to produce a PYY(3-36) composition, which then can be sprayed into the<br>
lungs. A suitable concentration of PYY3-36 for the resultant composition should be<br>
about 400 mg/mL. See U.S. Patent Application No. 20030072740.<br>

anticoagulant (EDTA) and protease inhibitor (aprotinin) and frozen. The assay is a<br>
four day process. Samples, controls, and standards are extracted in alcohol and dried<br>
on Day 1. All samples are reconstituted and mixed with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum<br>
directed against hPYY on Day 2. Iodinated hPYY is added on Day 3. Specific<br>
precipitating agents (Goat anti-Rabbit IgG and Normal Rabbit Serum) are added on<br>
Day 4. Bound tracer is separated from free tracer by centrifugation, and the bound<br>
tracer is counted in the gamma counter. Concentration is calculated by interpolation<br>
of a standard curve and assay performance is controlled with Quality Control<br>
samples.<br>
