THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
SYSTEM AND APPARATUS FOR COMPRESSING AND DECOMPRESSING DATA STORED TO A PORTABLE DATA STORAGE DEVICE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application is related to the following United States patent applications, each of which is owned by the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein:<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/803,173, entitled "PORTABLE DATA i t       STORAGE DEVICE CAPABLE OF BEING DIRECTLY CONNECTED VIA USB PLUG TO A COMPUTER"; U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/803,157, entitled "PORTABLE DATA STORAGE DEVICE HAVING SECURE MODE OF OPERATION"; U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/898,365, entitled "A PORTABLE DEVICE HAVING BIOMETRICS-BASED AUTHENTICATION CAPABILITIES"; and U.S. Patent       Application Serial No. 09/898,310, entitled "A PORTABLE DEVICE HAVING IOMETRICS-BASED AUTHENTICATION CAPABILITIES".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of storage of electronic data. More particularly, the present invention relates to the compression and decompression of data stored to a portable memory device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Portable memory devices, sometimes referred to as "key chain" memory devices or Thumbdrives™ (which is a trademark of the assignee of the present invention), are small portable data storage devices. These devices have become a class of indispensable computer peripherals that are widely utilized in business, educational and home computing. These devices are very small in comparison with other data storage devices such as personal computers (PCs), personal digital assistants (PDAs), magnetic disks, or compact disks (CDs). Indeed, the name "keychain" memory device describes the devices as similar in size to a key. Portable memory devices are generally not permanently fitted to a particular host platform,<br>
2<br><br>
such as a PC Rather, they can be conveniently attached to and removed from any computer having the appropriate connection port (e.g., a serial bus port like a USB port, or IEEE 1394 port ("Firewire")). Thus, these portable data storage devices enable a user to transfer data among different computers that are not otherwise connected. Because these devices utilize a non-volatile solid-state memory (e.g., flash memory) as the storage medium, they do not require moving parts or a mechanical drive mechanism for accessing data. The absence of a drive mechanism enables portable data storage devices to be more compact than surface storage devices such as magnetic disks and CDs. Also, because there are no moving parts, reading and writing to the memory can be done much more rapidly than to magnetic disks and CDs. Portable data storage devices also have a much higher memory capacity than magnetic disks, holding up to 256 megabytes, as compared to 1.4 megabytes for magnetic disks.<br>
Although storing data to a portable memory device has proven useful, the utility of these devices is limited by their inability to store larger quantities of data without increasing their size.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and apparatus that enables users to save larger quantities of data to a portable memory device than the current state of the art would allow. This would allow manufacturers to increase the amount, of data that can be stored to the memory of these devices without increasing the physical size of the memory and thus the size of the devices. Additionally, this would have the added benefit of allowing manufacturers to decrease the size of these devices without decreasing the amount of data that such devices are capable of storing.<br>
These and other objects are achieved by the present invention comprising a portable memory device that is capable of easy connection to a host platform such as a PC via a USB port, IEEE 1394 (i.e., firewire) or similar port. Included in the device is flash memory, read¬only-memory (ROM), random-access-memory (RAM), USB controller, and a micro controller. In addition, a data compression and decompression engine is included in the portable memory device to compress/decompress data as it is stored and retrieved from memory.<br>
3<br><br>
        The portable memory device (Thumbdrive ™) is connected to a host platform such as a personal computer (PC) by a USB connector inserted into the PC"s USB port. Data to be saved to the portable memory device is transmitted by the PC in the form of data packets to a working buffer in the portable memory device. The compression engine retrieves the data from the buffer and compresses each packet of data. Compressed data packets are stored in the flash memory. To retrieve data, the compression/decompression engine retrieves the data from the flash memory and decompresses it. The decompression engine places the decompressed data in the working buffer where it is then transferred to the host platform.<br>
Typically, the compression/decompression software is located in the ROM then loaded into micro controller for execution. In an alternative embodiment, the compression/decompression engine resides in an ASIC chip in the portable device.<br>
The compression/decompression features of the portable device are invisible to the user. The user saves data but is not aware that it is being compressed. In an alternative embodiment, the user is aware of these features and enables/disables the compression feature as desired.   Disabling the compression feature has the effect of increasing the speed at which the data can be saved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and complete and fully conveys the invention to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents of these embodiments, which are included within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it is clear to those of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating functional blocks of one embodiment of the portable memory device and system of the present invention and an illustrative configuration thereof. Figure 1 shows a portable memory device 100 (a small handheld device capable of fitting substantially in a closed fist) that is connected via a universal serial bus (USB) port IEEE 1394 (i.e., firewire) or similar port connector 40 to a USB port (or similar port) 192 of the host platform 195 (such as a personal computer). In the preferred embodiment, the connection is made without wire or cable interconnection. Host platform 195 is coupled to a power supply circuit 150 located in.portable device 100. Power supply circuit 150 draws power from host platform 195 and serves as a power source for various components of portable device 100.<br>
Referring still to Figure 1, the portable memory device 100 includes a micro controller 160, flash memory 180, and a data compression/decompression engine 190. It is understood that micro controller 160 could also be a general purpose microprocessor.<br>
5<br><br>
In one embodiment, a working buffer 165 is located in the micro controller. In an alternative embodiment, the working buffer 165 is located outside of the micro controller 165 (e.g., in the RAM 110). In the preferred embodiment, the working buffer has 16 kilobytes of capacity.<br>
It should be appreciated that data compression/decompression engine 190 maybe implemented in various ways within the scope of the present invention. In one embodiment, compression/decompression engine 190 is implemented as firmware stored in a non-volatile memory 110 within portable device 100. In another embodiment, data compression/decompression engine 190 is implemented as part of micro controller 160. In<br>
" 0     still another embodiment, compression/decompression engine 190 is implemented as a<br>
processor separate from micro controller 160. In other words, within the scope of the present invention, compression/decompression engine 190 is not required to reside in a particular location in the portable device 100. Instead, where compression/decompression engine 190 is to be placed is a design choice, thus affording design flexibility to suit different applications<br>
15     in which the present invention can be utilized.<br>
Data compression/decompression engine 190 compresses data after the data is transferred from the host platform 195 to the portable memory device 100. The data is transferred in the form of data packets passed along a USB bus. The data compression/decompression engine 190 retrieves the data from the working buffer 165 ""       (typically one sector at a time) and compresses the data. In the preferred embodiment, the data is compressed to 50% of its original size. Thus a packet of 512 bytes of data will be compressed to 256 bytes. After compression, the data is stored to the flash memory 180. The compression/decompression engine 190 also decompresses data stored to the flash memory 180 and transfers the data to the host platform 195.<br>
In this embodiment, the portable device includes a USB device controller 130, which serves to control the communication between portable device 100 and host platform 195, such as a USB-compatible PC having a USB host controller 197 therein.<br>
With reference still to Figure 1, portable device 100 also includes a volatile memory 120 and a non-volatile memory 110. In a preferred embodiment, volatile memory 120 is a random access memory (RAM) that serves as a working memory for micro controller 160<br>
6<br><br>
during its operation. Non-volatile memory 110 is a read-only memory (RUM) in this embodiment and can be used to store firmware that performs various functions of portable memory device 100.<br>
Additionally, in this embodiment, portable device 100 includes a write-protect switch 170 which, when activated, triggers micro controller 160 to disable write-access to flash memory 180. It should be appreciated that write-protect switch 170, like compression/decompression engine 190, may be implemented in various ways within the scope of the present invention. For example, write-protect switch 170 can be implemented by software (e.g., firmware stored in a non-volatile memory), as part of micro controller 160, or as a processor unit separate from micro controller 160. In an alternative embodiment, the write-protect switch 170 can be a manual switch which is manually operated by the user.<br>
In a currently preferred embodiment as illustrated in Figure 1, microprocessor 160 controls various components of portable device 100, including USB device controller 130, ROM 110, and RAM 120 (and execution of firmware code stored therein).<br>
Optionally, portable device 100 further includes a USB port (not shown) that is provided as a convenient feature that can be used to couple other USB-compatible device(s) to the portable device 100 via USB.<br>
In one embodiment, driver software (not shown), application programming interface (API) (not shown) and monitoring software (not shown) reside in the host platform 195 and communicate with USB host controller 197 to facilitate the operation of portable device 100.<br>
The architecture of a portable data storage device is described in U.S. Patent application entitled "A Portable Device Having Biometrics-Based Authentication Capabilities" with Ser. No. 09/898,365, filed on July 3,2001 and in U.S. Patent Application entitled "Portable Data Storage Device Capable of Being Directly Connected Via USB Plug to a Computer" with Serial No. 09/803,173.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a flow diagram of the operation that occurs when the user connects the portable device 100 to the host platform 195 (step 205) and initiates the saving of data to the portable device 100. In step 205, upon being coupled to a host platform 195, portable device 100 undergoes an initialization procedure. In a currently preferred<br>
7<br><br>
embodiment, the initialization procedure involves establishing communication with the host platform 195 and ensuring the host platform 195 is aware that portable device 100 has been coupled thereto. Host platform 195 requests services from portable device 100 by sending request packets to USB host controller 197. USB host controller 197 transmits packets through USB port 192 to USB connector 140. Portable device 100 then performs various operations such as reading, writing or erasing coupled with compressing and decompressing data from or to flash memory 180.<br>
In step 210, host platform 195 may send a request to portable memory device 100 to write data to flash memory 180 in the form of a write command. In step 215, USB controller 130 receives write command. Write command typically indicates the number of packets of data to follow that are to be saved.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a flow diagram of the operation that occurs when data is transferred to the portable device to be compressed and written to the flash memory 180. Host platform 195 transmits a first data packet to USB controller 130 (step 303). In one embodiment, in accordance with the USB 2.0 standard, each data packet is the equivalent of one"sector of memory or 512 bytes. In an alternative embodiment, in accordance with USB standard 1.1, each data packet is 64 bytes.<br>
USB Controller 130 receives packet of data from host platform 195 (step 305). USB controller 130 transmits data packet to working buffer 165 (step 310). In the preferred embodiment, working buffer 165 can hold a maximum of 16 kilobytes of data. If working buffer 165 reaches maximum capacity and can no longer store additional data, then the next data packet may be rejected and a negative acknowledgement (NAK) communication is sent by micro controller 160 to host controller 195 indicating that the rejected data packet was not received (steps 312 and 313). Host controller 195 then retransmits rejected data packet (step 303). This process of packet rejection and retransmission continues until the working buffer 165 has capacity to accept an additional data packet (step 314).<br>
Micro controller 160 executes data compression/decompression engine 190 (Step 315). Compression/decompression engine 190 operates on packets of data stored in working buffer 165 (Step 320) in a First In/First Out scheme whereby data packets are compressed in      the order that they are stored to working buffer 165 with the first packet stored in working buffer 165 being the first to be compressed and transferred to flash memory 180. In the<br>
8<br><br>
 preferred embodiment, data is compressed to 50% of its original size. In the preferred embodiment, when Operating on a USB 2.0 standard, compression engine 190 operates to compress one sector (512 bytes) of data at a time. In an alternative embodiment, when operating on the USB 1.1 standard, compression engine 190 operates to compress 64 bytes of data at a time. Compressed data is saved to flash memory 180 (Step 325).<br>
Memory mapping is controlled by the micro controller 160. In the preferred embodiment, the host platform (and user) are unaware that the data is being compressed. To the host platform, data appears to fill sectors in the flash memory 180 as if the data were not compressed (i.e., 512 bytes of non-compressed data per sector). Thus compressed data written to the first sector would appear to the host controller to fill one entire sector. In reality, the data is compressed from 512 to 256 bytes and is saved to half the sector space that would be needed for the data had it not been compressed. Thus the second packet of data, after it is compressed from 512 bytes to 256 bytes, may also be saved to the first sector. To the host controller, the second data packet, which in reality is saved to the first sector, will appear to be saved to the second sector. Similarly, the first data packet saved to second sector will appear to be saved to the third sector and the second data packet saved to the second sector will appear to be saved to the fourth sector.<br>
Typically standard 2 bit error detection and 1 bit correction mechanisms are employed.<br>
If there is another packet of data, then host controller 195 transmits the packet of data to USB controller 130 (step 335 and 303). Data compression engine 190 continues to compress additional packets of data stored to working buffer 165 (step 320). When there are no more data packets to be compressed, then the data compression and storage session ends.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the steps by which data is retrieved from the memory 180 of the portable memory device 100 and decompressed.<br>
In step 410, user connects the portable device 100 to a host platform 195. In step 410, upon being coupled to a host platform 195, portable device 100 may undergo the initialization procedure described previously. Host platform 195 requests services from portable device 100 by sending request packets to USB host controller 197. USB host controller 197 transmits packets through USB port 192 to USB connector 140.<br>
9<br><br>
Host platform 195 may send a request to portable device 100 to read data requested by user (step 420) in the form of a read command. USB controller 130 receives the read command (step 425). Read command indicates the location of the data in the flash memory 180 and number of packets of data to be read. Because host platform 195 is unaware that data is compressed, the read command will request data that is not necessarily in the sector in which the host platform 195 believes it to be. For example, as discussed previously, the second data packet, which in reality is saved to the second half of the first sector, will appear to the host controller 195 be saved to the second sector. Similarly, the first data packet saved to second sector will appear to be saved to the third sector and the second data packet saved to the second sector will appear to be saved to the fourth sector. Thus, host platform"s 195 data request may indicate that a particular packet of data is stored to the second sector, where in reality, it is stored to the second half of the first sector. To account for this, micro controller 160 operates to retrieve requested data from flash memory 180 in accordance with the manner in which it was saved (step 325).<br>
In step 430, micro controller 160 executes data compression/decompression engine 190. Compression/decompression engine 190 retrieves packets of requested data from flash memory 180 {step 445). Compression/decompression engine 190 acts to decompress dates (step 447). Decompressed data is transferred to working buffer 165 (step 450). Decompressed data is transferred to USB controller 130 (step 455). In step 460, data packet is transferred to the memory (e.g., RAM) of the host platform 195.<br>
Data compression/decompression engine 190 continues to retrieve and decompress data from flash memory 180 until all data requested has been decompressed and transferred to host platform 195.<br>
Alternatively, host platform 195 may send a request to portable device 100 to read directory of data stored to flash memory 180. User can then view directory on host platform 195 to determine which data user wishes to retrieve from flash memory 180.<br>
It is to be understood that the above description is only of the preferred embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the art may devise numerous other arrangements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention is thus limited only as defined in the accompanying claims.<br>
