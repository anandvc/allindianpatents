A REFERENCE COMPOUND FOR USE IN THE ANALYSIS OF LEVOSIMENDAN BATCHES<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to [[4-(2-azido-3-methyl-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-yl)phenyl]hydrazono]propanedinitrile (I) and its use as a reference compound in the analysis of batches of levosimendan synthesis, particularly in the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosimendan batch. The present invention also relates to an analytic method for the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosimendan batch wherein [[4-(2-azido-3-methyl-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-yl)phenyl]hydrazono ] propanedinitrile (I) is used as a reference compound.<br>
Levosimendan, which is the (-)-enantiomer of [[4-(l,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)phenyl]hydrazono]propanedinitrile, and the method for its preparation is described e.g. in EP 565546 Bl. Levosimendan is potent in the treatment of heart failure and has significant calcium dependent binding to troponin. The use of levosimendan in the treatment of myocardial ischemia is described in WO 93/21921. The hemodynamic effects of levosimendan in man are described in Sundberg, S. et at, Am. J. Cardiol., 1995; 75: 1061-1066. Levosimendan is represented by the formula:<br><br>
Clinical studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of levosimendan in heart failure patients.<br>
Levosimendan can be prepared in high purity and in nearly quantitative yields by treating (-)-6-(4-aminophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-<iihydro-3 with sodium nitrite and malononitrile as described in ep bl. however it has been found that samples of levosimendan synthesized show potential genotoxic properties occasionally the bacterial mutagenity test></iihydro-3><br>
2<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has now been found that the potential genotoxic properties of fevosimendan samples are caused by an azido derivative impurity of formula (I)<br><br>
This azido derivative is a potent matagen which can be formed curing levosimendan synthesis in an amount suff.;ient to give a positive result in the bacterial rmr.agenity test. This compound named [[4-(2-azido-3-methyI-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-yl)phcnyl]hydrazonc]propanedinitrilc (I) is therefore useful as a reference compound in the routine analysis of batches of levosimenda:. synthesis, particularly in the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in levosimendan batches. The presence of (I) in a levosimer.dan batch indicates that further recrystallization is necessary for obtaining ievosimendan material suitable for use as a medicine.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
FIG. 1 is a HPLC-chromatogram o: the [[4-(2-azido-3-methyl-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-yl)phenyI]hydrazono]propanedinitrilc standard (0.-  g/ml).<br>
FIG. 2 is a HPLC-chromatogram o: levosimendan raw material. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a reference compound having structure (I) for the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosimendan batch. The present invention also provides a reference preparation for the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosirnendan batch comprising compound (I) optionally together with an analytically acceptable carrier, and in particular essentially in the absence of pyridazinyl derivatives.<br><br>
3<br>
The present invention also provides the use of (I) as a reference compound in the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosimendan batch.<br>
The present invention also provides an analytic method for the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosimendan batch characterized in that compound (I) is used as a reference compound, particularly as said levosimendan sample is analyzed by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides an analytic method for the determination of potentially genotoxic impurities in samples of a levosimendan batch which method comprises preparing a reference standard solution by dissolving compound (I) in solution, preparing a test solution by dissolving a sample of a levosimendan batch in solution, obtaining a HPLC chromatogram of said reference standard solution, obtaining a HPLC chromatogram of said test solution and determining the concentration of compound (I) in the sample.<br>
The term "analytically acceptable carrier" means here a carrier which does not hamper the qualitative or quantitative analysis of (I). The selection of a suitable analytically acceptable carrier is well known to one skilled in the an. An example of an analytically acceptable carrier is dimethyl sulphoxide.<br>
Compound (I) can be prepared by treating 6-(4-aminophenyl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinone with sodium nitrite and malononitriie wherein sodium nitrite is used in molar excess and separating (I) from the reaction mixture. The procedure is described in detail in Example 1.<br>
The product of a levosimendan batch is preferably analyzed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Suitable apparatus include e.g. C-8 reversed phase HPLC column with UV-detection at 360 nm. The mobile phase is e.g. a mixture of phosphate buffer pH 2.1 and acetonitrile. The levosimendan sample is dissolved in suitable solvent such as a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol and water. The reference solutions are prepared by dissolving compound (I) in suitable solvent. The retention times of levosimendan and compound (I) or diastereomers thereof are determined in the chromatographic conditions used. The amount of (I) in the levosimendan sample is determined by comparing the chromatograms obtained for the sample solution and the reference solution. The procedure is described in detail in Example 2.<br><br>
4<br>
The amount of the undssired impurity (I) in a levosimendan batch can be reduced by methods known in the art such as recrystallizatioa. Recrystallization of levosimendan can be performed from any suitable solvent acetone being the preferred solvent.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Preparation of [[4-(2-azido-3-methyl-5-oiotetrahydro-furan-2-yl)phenyl]hydrazono]propanetinitrile (mixture of diastereomers)<br>
6-(4-Aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone (153 g, 0.75 mol) was dissolved in acetic acid (750 mL). Solid sodium mirite (210 g, 3,0 mol) was slowly added to the solution at 10 - 20 °C. After the addition the mixture was stirred for 90 min at 10 - 20 °C The reaction mixture was poured rapidly to a 20 °C solution of malononitrile (150g, 2.3 mol) and water( 1500 nL). The resulting aiixture was stirred at 20-25 °C for 60 min and then filtered aid washed with water. The wet solid was extracted successively with tetrahydrofurn (300 mL) and ethyl acetate (1900 mL). The combined extracts were dried with sodium sulphate and the solvents evaporated under vacaum. The residue was triturated with ethyl acetate (200 mL), filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum. The residue (8,0 g) was purified cromatographically on silica gel using toluene-ethyl acetate 2:1 as the eluent. After crystallization from toluene the yield of pure mixture of diastereomers was 1,0 g. The major component of the mixture can be enriched by multiple<br>
