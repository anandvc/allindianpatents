				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   method   of preparation   of sulfonamide derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a method for synthesis of 4-halo-benzenesulfonamide derivatives.<br>
The importance of sub-unit sulfonamide stems from their role in biological activity of the molecule and could have potential application as an herbicides and/or plant growth regulant, endoihclin antagonists, HIV protease inhibitors, catalytic antibodies, etc.<br>
US 4,632,693 discloses synthesis, formulations and herbicidal properties of 4-metlwxy-2-[[(4-inethoxy-6-methyl-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl)aminocarlxmyl] aminosulfonyl]benzoate used as plant growth regulant. This sulfonamide derivative was prepared by the reaction of 4-tnelhoxy-6-me(hyl-l ,3,5-triaz.in-2-amiue and methyl-2-(isocyanatosulfonyl)-4-methoxybenzoate in dichloromethane under reflux conditions for 4h.<br>
Mayer ct.al. (J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 3653-3664} have synthesized and studied the biological activity of several ^-adrenoceptor antagonists used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson"s and Alzheimer"s diseases. These antagonists are sulfonamide derivatives and in genera), prepared by the reaction of arylsulfonyl chloride with an amine. For example, N- {2-\ 1 -(2,3-dihydrobenzo[ 1(4 Jdioxin-2-ylmethy l)piperidin-4y!]eihyl] ioluene-4-sulfonamide has been synthesized by the reaction of 2-[l-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-ylmethyl)piperidin-4yl3-2-cthylamine<br><br>
(leCui) with p-toIuenesulfonyl chloride (leCui) in presence of Et3N (2.5eCui) in CH2C12 at 0°C-RT for 1h.<br>
A new class of proline sulfonamide derivatives was used by Natchus and co-workers [J. Med. Chem. 2000,43,4948-4963] as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibitors. The proline sulfonamide derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of free amine derived from l-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-carbomethoxy-4CS)-(pyrrolidin-l-A"-yl)pyrrolidineor I-N-rert-butoxy carbonyl-2 -carbomethoxy-4(S)-(y-sultam-1 -N-yl)-pyrrolidine by N-rert-butoxycaronyl group cleavage followed by coupling with 4-phenoxybenzenesulfonylchloride or 4-n-propoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride. respectively in presence of dioxane: water EtsN (3:1:2) to give the corresponding l-N-(4-phenyloxybenzenesuIfonyl)-2-carbomethoxy-4(S)r (pyrrolidin-l-N-yl)pyrrolidine or l-A"-(4-n-propoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2-carbomethoxy-4(S)-(y-sultam-l-A"-yl)pyrrolidine.<br>
A recent review on the synthesis of biphenyl isoxazole sulfonamides from workers at Bristol-Meyers SCuibb Company belongs to endothelin antagonists, provide valuable information about the wide application of "sulfonamide" derivatives (WO 00/56685). Typically, in this process the biphenyl sulfonamide was synthesized by reaction of unsubstituted or substituted 4"-(2-oxazolyl)[l,r-biphenyl]-2-sulfonyl chloride (lmol) with 5-amino-3,4-dimethylisoxazole (lmol) in THF in presence of sodium-t--butoxide (2.2mol) at -15°C. Wherein, the unsubstituted or substituted biphenyl sulfonyl chlorides were prepared by the reaction of corresponding 2-sulfonic acid, sodium salt with "Vilsmeier* chlorinating reagent such as<br><br>
thionyIchloride, oxalylchloride or phosphorous oxychlonde in toluene at RT for 3h.<br>
The above observations reveal that the sulfonamide derivatives are commonly synthesized by the reaction of aryl/alkyl-sulfonylchloride with aryl/alkyl-amine in suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform in presence of base such as triethylarnine, pyridine etc. Other method involves in-situ preparation of sulfonylchloride by the reaction of sulfonic acid or sulfonic acid salt and chlorinating reagent such as oxaiylchioride or thionylchloride and subseCuent reaction with amine to give corresponding "sulfonamide" derivatives.<br>
There is demand for a search of suitable intermediate for the synthesis of sulfonamides, as the most commonly used aryl/alkyl-sulfonylchlorides are shown to be i) unstable, ii) moisture sensitive, iii) slowly degrade to sulfonic acid. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present is invention the sulphonamide derivatives are synthesized from alky 1-4-halopheny (sulfonate.<br>
