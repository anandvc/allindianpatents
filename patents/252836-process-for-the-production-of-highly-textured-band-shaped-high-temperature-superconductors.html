BACKGROUND<br>
Several cuprate superconductors are already superconducting above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77K). The cuprate superconductors are therefore also named high-temperature superconductors (HTSL). These superconductors, however, have poor mechanical properties. The development of band lines is an attempt to overcome the associated problems.<br>
Band lines (band-HTSL or band-shaped HTSL) are so-called coated conductors that have a superconducting functional layer, which is applied to a band-shaped substrate via a special process. As a functional layer, e.g., yttrium-barium-copper-oxide YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) can be used. These band lines have, La., a structure that consists of a metal substrate, buffer layer and superconducting layer (cf. Figure 1). The economic efficiency of the production process is decisively determined by the precipitation process. The main difficulty in the production of coated conductors is the fact that the superconducting layer must have an extremely high degree of texture, i.e., crystallographic orientation. The individual crystallites of the layer should be tilted against one another only by a minimum value, since otherwise the superconducting properties are severely impaired (D7).<br>
To achieve such a high degree of texture, two different production preparations are pursued. It is common to both preparations that before the superconducting layer is deposited, a textured buffer layer is produced, which transfers its texture, i.e., orientation,<br><br>
UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION OF MICHAEL BACKER, ET AL.<br>
ATTORNEY DOCKET NO.: 1633.0171C<br>
to the superconductors with its deposition. In the two preparations, metal substrates are used, since this is the only way that the strength of the band lines that is necessary for later use in electrical technology can be achieved. In the first preparation, the process starts with an untextured, crystallographically non-oriented metal substrate, whereby in most cases, a Hastelloy (trademark) alloy is used. The buffer layer with an orientation is then applied to this untextured substrate. Such a directed deposition can be carried out only by means of physical coating processes, e.g., Ion Beam-Assisted Deposition (IBAD) and Inclined Substrate Deposition (ISD), under high vacuum. Decisive drawbacks of this process are the high equipment cost, e.g., by the high vacuum to be used, and only a low deposition rate. In the second preparation, the metal substrate is already textured by special deformation and temperature treatment processes (D8, D9, D10). The texture of the substrate can thus be transferred to the buffer layer and from there to the superconducting layer. The advantage of this method is that no directed deposition processes must be used. Here, i.a., both physical processes, such as Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and Thermal Co-Evaporation (TCE), and chemical processes, such as Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) and Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) can be used. For the above-mentioned physical processes, what is stated above for the first process preparation applies in principle, whereby the deposition rates of the physical processes are considerably higher with undirected deposition.<br>
Chemical coating processes are especially economical, relative to installation and operating costs, since the latter, i.a., work at normal pressure, i.e., without high vacuum, and make possible a very much higher deposition rate. CSD (Chemical Solution Deposition) processes, which take place at normal pressure in contrast to physical coating methods, are therefore the focus of numerous developments (D7) throughout the world. On the laboratory scale, the coating with CSD processes is carried out as a "dip-coating," by the substrate being immersed in a solution and pulled back out, or as "spin coating." Here, several drops of the solution are applied to a substrate and distributed by rotating the substrate (cf. Figure 2). For production of greater lengths, the substrate band can be drawn through a coating solution and then dried in a furnace (D6). A diagrammatic visualization of such a system can be seen in Figure 3. The subsequent reaction is carried out at a higher temperature.<br><br>

A Coated Conductor Architecture or Shift Sequence while eliminating the buffer layer is not possible from a physical standpoint, since this layer is required primarily as a diffusion barrier. On the one hand, this layer is to prevent metal atoms from the metal band substrate (e.g., nickel) from diffusing into the superconductor in the case of the subsequent annealing treatment, contaminating the latter and thus degrading the superconducting properties. On the other hand, this buffer layer acts as an oxygen barrier, thus also no oxygen can diffuse through the buffer layer to the metal substrate band in the subsequent annealing treatment. There, it would result in the formation of a metal oxide barrier layer, which can result in the flaking of the buffer and superconductor layer.<br>
Because of the above-mentioned advantages, the use of a textured metal substrate band (D8), on which a buffer layer and the actual superconducting layer are applied by chemical deposition, is preferred as a production process for Coated Conductors. In this case, in each case the individual deposition steps are followed by an annealing treatment, in which the deposited materials are to be crystallized so that the texture is picked up from the subjacent layer or the substrate.<br>
This process is a so-called "all-solution" process, which originates, relative to the coatings, only from solutions of individual components and a coating at ambient pressure.<br>
While, e.g., yttrium-barium-copper oxide is used for the superconducting layer, the most varied compounds can be used for the buffer layer. The basic requirement is the property of being deposited in a textured fashion and of passing on this texture to the superconducting layer. In addition to single layers, multilayer buffer layer systems are also used. Typically used materials are yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide, gadolinium zirconate, yttrium oxide, lanthanum aluminate, lanthanum zirconate, strontium titanate, nickel oxide, cerium oxide, magnesium oxide, lanthanum manganate, strontium ruthenate and many others (Dl, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D7).<br>
To date, no band line, which has similarly high elastic current density, such as band lines in which at least one layer was applied by means of physical methods, e.g., with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD), could be produced by means of "all-solution" processes. It is known from studies that the production of Coated Conductors via CSD processes was decisively unsuccessful in the production of such buffer layers, which can<br><br>
UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION OF MICHAEL BACKER, ET AL.<br>
ATTORNEY DOCKET NO.: 1633.0171C<br>
transfer their texture to the superconductor layer. This was detected, i.a., in that even a deposition of the superconductor layer with physical methods, which results in demonstrably high-quality layers on physically deposited buffer layers, results only in a slight texture of the superconductor layer on CSD buffer layers and thus results in poor superconducting properties. This can be substantiated by a lack of texture transfer.<br>
In addition to the drawback of the above-described poor texture transfer capability of CSD buffer layers, the previously described process for depositing buffer layers via CSD processes starts mainly from solutions on which 2-methoxyethanol is based as a solvent (Dl, D2 and D3). This solvent is classified as toxic, embryotoxic- and fertility-damaging and therefore is rather unsuitable for laboratory use as well as for technical applications. In addition, the starting substances for the example of the production of La2Zr2O7 (lanthanum-isopropoxide and zirconium-n-propoxide) are moisture-sensitive, so that the production of the solution must take place under inert atmosphere.<br>
Another drawback of previous CSD processes for applying the buffer layers are the required high temperatures for crystallization of the buffer layers, which often lie considerably above 1000ยฐC (D4) and thus greatly limit the selection of suitable metal substrates. In addition, even in the case of substrates that have a sufficiently high melting point or softening temperature, the diffusion speed at temperatures above 1000ยฐC are so high that in the buffer layers, high levels of contaminants of diffused-in metal atoms from the substrate can be detected.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The object of the invention consists in further developing the CSD process for the production of band-shaped HTSL to the extent that the texture transfer capability of the buffer layer is improved.<br>
The purpose of the invention is achieved by the use of polar solvents with free hydroxyl groups, in particular propionic acid as a solvent for the buffer substances and the adaptation of the deposition conditions to the new coating solutions. According to the object, in this respect a high texture transfer capability with simultaneous avoidance of toxic solvents and a reduction in the annealing temperature could be achieved.<br><br>

ATTORNEY DOCKET NO.: I633.017IC<br>
Relative to the process and the band-shaped HTSL, reference is made to the claims.<br>
For the development of new processes and coating systems, which satisfy at least the object of a high texture transfer capability, first the causes of the lack of texture transfer from buffers to superconductors in the case of conventional CSD coating must be clarified. The examination of the entire texture of the buffer layer is carried out in most cases via x-ray or electron diffraction (D4). The depth of penetration of these measuring methods โ i.e., the material depths are obtained from the measuring data ~ is greater than the thickness of the layer to be measured. With corresponding measurements, very good texture values, with typical half-power bandwidths in the range of 6-7ยฐ (29), which can be calculated from pole figures, were obtained in all previously deposited buffer layers. This number of degrees is a measure of the scattering of the crystal orientations around the ideal value. The values measured in the buffer layers that are deposited via the CSD processes correspond to those that were measured in the physically deposited buffer layers. Because of the measured values, it should therefore be possible in principle to deposit comparably well textured YBCO layers on the CSD buffer. This deposition is possible, however, only at a comparatively very low degree of texturing and thus poor superconducting properties. These standard diffraction measurements were therefore unsuitable for detecting the texture transfer capability of the buffer layer.<br>
Since the texture transfer must be carried out by the topmost cover layer of the buffer layer, this layer was examined by means of RHEED (Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction). The results of these measurements on conventional, CSD-produced buffer layers showed that an amorphous cover layer that is barely one nanometer thick is found on the very well-textured CSD buffer layer in the interior, and said amorphous cover layer could be observed in all common buffer systems (for exampleLa2Zr2O2 (LZO), CeO2/Gd2O3, and Y-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ)), which were deposited by means of CSD. This amorphous cover layer prevents qualitatively high-value superconductor layers from being able to be deposited on buffer layers, which were produced with conventional coating solutions and processes via CSD. A buffer layer with a high texture transfer capability must therefore show, in RHEED measurements, a high degree of texture even of the outermost buffer layer, i.e., up to the surface of the buffer layer.<br><br>
UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION OF MICHAEL BACKER, ET AL.<br>
ATTORNEY DOCKET NO.: 1633.0171C<br>
Coating solutions and process parameters according to the invention ensure that the previously observed, amorphous cover layer does not form and the buffer layer completely crystallizes up to the surface. This finding was clearly verified by means of RHEED images of the buffer layers produced according to the invention. Buffer layers according to the invention thus make possible for the first time the production of high-grade coated conductors via the "all-solution" process, or in general the deposition of qualitatively high-grade superconductor layers on CSD buffer layers.<br>
When using polar solvents with free hydroxyl groups, a clearly better crystallinity of the surface of the buffer layers could be achieved. Accordingly, e.g., carboxylic acids are advantageous as solvents, which in addition have the advantage that they could easily etch the metal substrate surface and thus purify in situ and thus also make possible an optimum texture development from this side. In addition, the carboxylic acids have the advantage that they are not classified, i.a., as harmful to health. The commercial conversion of the process with these solvents can be done in this case both with respect to the safety of the employees and with respect to the economy of the process, by less necessary equipment safety measures that are considerably more advantageous in comparison to the use of conventional solvents.<br>
Advantageous buffer systems, which can be produced with use of the process according to the invention, consist of, for example, zirconates and/or rare earth oxides. Concrete examples of such buffer systems are yttrium oxide, cerium oxide or gadolinium-doped cerium oxide. These different buffer systems can also be combined in a multilayer buffer system.<br>
For the production of the coating solutions, in this case it may be advantageous to heat the latter or to heat them while being stirred so that the latter boil under reflux. In addition, various additives can be mixed in the coating solution to have a positive influence on the coating process and to increase the stability of the solution. To improve the process, for example, wetting agents are used, i.e., agents that reduce the surface tension of the coating solution and thus make possible a uniform coating over the surface and on the edges and at the same time counteract the formation of drops during drying.<br><br>
UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION OF MICHAEL BACKER, ET AL.<br>
ATTORNEY DOCKET NO.: 1633.0171C<br>
Also, gelling agents, which make possible a uniform drying of the coating without flakes, cracks and pores, are used. To stabilize the solutions, i.a., antioxidants can be used.<br>
The coating of the substrate with the coating solution according to the invention can be carried out in various ways. The solution can be applied by dip-coating (dipping of the substrate in the solution), spin-coating (applying the solution to a rotating substrate), spray-coating (spraying or atomizing the solution on the substrate), capillary-coating (applying the solution via a capillary), ink-jet printing and similar techniques. In the application of the solution, structures in the buffer layer can optionally be produced either by specific protection of areas, e.g., by means of photoresist and removal after the coating, or by the process itself, e.g., in the printing process such as the ink-jet printing.<br>
The coating and drying can generally be carried out both in the batch process and continuously. Because of the lower handling cost, continuous systems are preferred here (cf Figure 3). These systems consist of a rinsing unit with an active or passive brake to keep the substrate band in the system under tension. This can be achieved by, e.g., a so-called dancer (double deflecting rollers with defined tensile force). The substrate band is then guided by the coating unit, which can consist of, e.g., a dipping bath. By arranging the guide rollers in different ways, different angles can be achieved for drawing the substrate band from the coating solution in the bath. The bath can be heated in addition, e.g., to increase the solubility of individual components in the solvent. The coating unit can be operated according to the invention also according to one of the additional above-mentioned processes (except for spin-coating). After coating, the drying of the coating is carried out in a drying section (drying unit). This section can be operated both at one temperature and at several temperatures and temperature variations. An at least two-stage drying with a low temperature Tl, which is slightly below the boiling point of the solvent that is used, and a temperature T2, which is above the boiling point, are advantageous. An especially homogeneous and thus crack- and pore-free drying is achieved by this process. After the drying, the band is wound up again on a winding unit. Winding the band on a carrier pipe in the form of a flat coil (solenoid) is advantageous for the subsequent annealing treatment. This takes place by a simultaneous rotational and linear movement of the coil winder. A carrier for the band is, e.g., a heat-resisting ceramic pipe<br><br>
UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION OF MICHAEL BACKER, ET AL.<br>
ATTORNEY DOCKET NO.: 1633.0171C<br>
or a coated metal pipe. The various units, in particular the coating unit and the drying unit, are advantageously configured such that the process can take place under a defined atmosphere. In the various units, it may be advantageous to set different atmospheres. For example, a higher vapor pressure of the solvent in the coating unit may be advantageous to avoid excessive evaporation of the solvent from the coating bath and thus to avoid a concentration of the coating solution.<br>
In addition to the texturing that is achieved by the coating according to the invention, the process parameters of the subsequent annealing treatment are also of decisive importance for the technical applicability and the economy of the coating process. In the case of buffer layers that are deposited according to the invention, crystallization sets in even at considerably lower temperatures than those in the conventional coating solutions or solvents. The purified surface seems to make it possible in addition that the texture of the metal substrate band is transferred more quickly and faultlessly to the buffer layer. As typical process temperatures for the annealing treatment, temperatures of 800-900ยฐC were identified.<br>
The low annealing temperatures in the coating according to the invention for the first time allow a continuous coating apparatus to be configured such that the final annealing treatment can be carried out continuously in a line with the coating and drying. This was previously prevented by the required high temperatures and the thus induced softening of the substrate band, which keeps the band from being transported through the equipment by pulling.<br>
The following examples can be cited, without being limited to the latter:<br>
Example 1<br>
In reproducible tests, La2Zr2O7 (LZO) was applied as a buffer layer to a textured metal band. The metal band is a pure nickel band. By alloying in tungsten up to a proportion of 8%, the tensile strength of the band can be increased without affecting the result of the coating in this example. Also, other alloys, such as, e.g., Ni-O, 1% Mn, can be used without affecting the final result of this example. In comparison tests, different coating solutions were used, whereby the first solution corresponds to the prior art, while the second solution is in accordance with the invention.<br><br>

Lanthanum(III) and zirconium(IV)-(2,4)pentanedionate (acetyl acetonate) (lanthanum (III)-(2,4)pentane-dionate, La[CH3COCHCOCH3]3 x H2O: Alfa Aesar, 99.9% (REO), powder, melting point: 143ยฐC; zirconium(IV)-(2,4)pentanedionate, Zr[CH3COCHCOCH3]4: Strem Chemicals, &gt; 98%, crystalline) are the basis of both coating solutions. Both solutions were set at a concentration of 0.1 M relative to La2Zr2O7 according to buffer stoichiometry. Higher or lower concentrations can be compensated for within limits (0.05-0.4 M) by varying the drawing speed (see below) without affecting the result. For specified setting of the metal contents, the starting substances were characterized by means of ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission). As a solvent for solution 1, acetyl acetone (2,4-pentanedione, CH3COCH2COCH3: Merck, for analysis, &gt; 99.5%, melting point: -23ยฐC, boiling point: 140ยฐC, flash point: 34ยฐC) was used with the addition of isobutylamine (l-amino-2-methylpropane, (CH3)2CHCH2NH2: Merck, for synthesis, &gt; 98%, melting point: -85ยฐC, boiling point: 68ยฐC, flash point: -10ยฐC), and proprionic acid (propionic acid, CH3CH2COOH: Merck, &gt; 99%, melting point: -21ยฐC, boiling point: 141ยฐC, flash point: 50ยฐC) for solution 2.<br>
The coating was carried out on substrate pieces with the dimensions 10 x 10 x 0.08 mm3 by means of a dipping apparatus. The samples were drawn out of the coating solution at a rate of 0.2 cm/s and at an angle of 90ยฐ to the solution surface. The rate can be reduced to up to 0.05 cm/s; lower rates produce too small a layer thickness. The rate can be increased to up to 0.5 cm/s; above this rate, excessive layer thicknesses are produced, which tend to form cracks in the subsequent temperature treatment process.<br>
After drying at 60ยฐC within 5 hours in air, the samples were subjected to different annealing treatments. The drying is carried out below the boiling point of the solvent (methanol; 64.5ยฐC) to prevent the formation of bubbles by boiling. The x-ray diffraction diagrams (Figure 4) show a good texture in all samples, whereby the texture of the samples that were produced with solution 2 is to be evaluated as better because of the error of the LZO (222) reflex as well as significantly higher intensities of the (hOO) reflexes in the x-ray diffraction diffractogram. The significantly reduced process temperature, which is necessary for the crystallization of the buffer layer, is especially to be emphasized.   While in the case of Solution 1, a temperature of 1100ยฐC (1 hour) is<br><br>

required, in the case of Solution 2, the annealing at temperatures of considerably below 1000ยฐC, e.g., 800 or 900ยฐC, can be carried out in each case for 2 hours according to Figure 4. In both cases, an inert gas atmosphere (Ar/5% H2) is required. The inert gas atmosphere is selected in this case such that, on the one hand, the metal band is not oxidized, and on the other hand, the oxide layer can still be formed.<br>
While the x-ray diffraction diagrams of the layers already show slight differences between the solutions, a clear difference can be noted via RHEED images, which show the texture of the uppermost nanometer range of the buffer layer. Figure 5 shows pole figures of the metal substrate and buffer layer as well as RHEED images of the different layers.<br>
While the pole figures exhibit only slight differences, as expected, the RHEED image, in the case of Solution 1 (coating solution according to the prior art) shows only diffraction rings. Diffraction rings stand for an irregular, random arrangement of crystallites in the space - i.e., no texture at all in the outer area of the buffer layer that is being examined. In contrast to this, the RHEED image shows the buffer layer, which was deposited with Solution 2, discrete reflexes tantamount to a strong level of texturing in the examined area up to the surface of the buffer layer.<br>
Example 2<br>
Y2O3 was also applied in a reproducible manner via the CSD process to a textured metal band (Ni - 5% W). In comparison tests, different coating solutions were already used as in Example 1. Solution 1 corresponded to the prior art, while the second solution is in accordance with the invention.<br>
In all tests, the starting substance was Y(III)-2,4-pentanedionate (yttrium(III) acetyl acetonate, Y(CH3COCHCOCH3)3 x H2O: Alfa Aesar, 99.9%, powder). The earlier precursor solutions were produced as solvents corresponding to the prior art by use of 2-methoxyethanoI (CH3OCH2CH2OH: Merck, for analysis, ACS, 99.3%, melting point: -85ยฐC, boiling point: 124-125ยฐC, flash point: 46ยฐC) or acetyl acetone (2,4-pentanedione, CH3COCH2COCH3: Merck, &gt; 99.5%, melting point: -23ยฐC, boiling point: 140ยฐC, flash point: 34ยฐC), methanol (CH3OH: Merck, for analysis, ACS, ISO,<br><br>

&gt;	99.8%,  melting  point:     -98ยฐC,  boiling point:  64.5ยฐC,  flash   point:     11ยฐC)  and<br>
isobutylamine (l-amino-2-methylpropane, (CH3)2CHCH2NH2: Merck, for synthesis,<br>
&gt;	98%, melting point:    -85ยฐC, boiling point:    68ยฐC, flash point:    -10ยฐC) (5-20%<br>
isobutylamine   in   acetyl   acetone).     In  the   production   of the   precursor  solutions<br>
corresponding to the invention, these solvents were replaced up to 45 to 100%, preferably<br>
90-100%, by propionic acid (propionic acid, CH3CH2COOH:   Merck, &gt; 99%, melting<br>
point: -21ยฐC, boiling point:  141ยฐC, flash point: 50ยฐC).<br>
The concentration of the solutions being examined was set at 0.125 M relative to Y2O3.<br>
The coating was carried out on substrate pieces with the dimensions 10 x 10 x 0.08 mm by means of a dipping apparatus. The samples were drawn out of the coating solution at a rate of 0.1 cm/s and at an angle of 90ยฐ to the solution surface.<br>
After drying in air at 60ยฐC within 1 hour and then at 90ยฐC within 0.5 hour, the samples were annealed at 1000ยฐC for 1 hour in Ar/5% H2.<br>
The x-ray diffractograms of the layers, which were produced with use of propionic acid, show clearly higher intensities of the (hOO) reflexes in the x-ray diffractogram than the Y2O3 layers, which were obtained according to the prior art. The highest intensity of the Y2O3 (400) reflex was measured on a buffer layer, which was produced with a propionic acid content of 50% in the solvent composition. The good texture of the sample can be confirmed in addition by the error of the Y2O3 (222) reflex (Figure 6).<br>
The pole figures on layers produced without the addition of proprionic acid show in-plane texture. Studies by means of RHEED yielded that these layers are textured not only up to the surface in the same quality, but that amorphous or polycrystalline portions are still present on the surface. In contrast to this, in-plane texture is present up to the surface in the layer that was produced corresponding to the invention (Figure 7).<br>
Example 3<br>
In reproducible tests according to the invention, La2Zr2O7 (LZO) was applied as a buffer layer to a textured metal band (Ni - 5% W).<br><br>

Lanthanum(III)- and zirconium(IV)-(2,4)pentanedionate (acetyl acetonate) (Lanthanum(III)-(2,4)pentane-dionate, La[CH3COCHCOCH3]3 x H2O: Alfa Aesar, 99.9% (REO), powder, melting point: 143ยฐC; zirconium(IV)-(2,4)pentane-dionate, Zr[CH3COCHCOCH3]4: Strem Chemicals, &gt; 98%, crystalline) are the basis of the coating solution. The solution was set at a concentration of 0.1 M relative to La2Zr2O7 according to buffer stoichiometry.<br>
For exact setting of the metal contents, the starting substances were characterized by means of ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission). As solvent for the solution, propionic acid (propionic acid, CH3CH2COOH: Merck, &gt; 99%, melting point: -21ยฐC, boiling point:  141ยฐC, flash point: 50ยฐC) was used.<br>
The coating was carried out on substrate bands with a cross-section of 5 x 0.1 mm and a length of 50 m in a continuous coating apparatus.<br>
This apparatus consists of a rinsing unit, a coating unit, a drying unit and a winding unit. Figure 8 shows a diagrammatic drawing. The band is drawn through the system by a drawing force of ION at a rate of 5 cm/min. The tensile force is selected in this case so that it is less than the elastic limit of the metal band that is used. The coating is carried out at a pull-out angle of 70ยฐ relative to the solution surface. The pull-out angle can be varied within a range of 20-90ยฐ, whereby a smaller angle means a larger layer thickness. Equal layer thicknesses can be achieved with, e.g., the combination of 70ยฐ and 5 cm/min as well as 90ยฐ and 5.8 cm/min. The drying is carried out in two steps. The predrying is carried out below the boiling temperature of the solvent (methanol/65ยฐC) at temperatures of 60ยฐC on a 50 cm segment, and the final drying is carried out on a 100 cm segment at a temperature of 90ยฐC. After drying, the band is wound up on a ceramic pipe (corundum) with a diameter of 20 cm and a length of 100 cm in the form of a spiral (solenoid).<br>
The band is moved with the carrier pipe into an annealing furnace and crystallized at a temperature of 900ยฐC within 2 hours.<br>
Studies by means of RHEED and x-ray diffractometry on selected short samples yielded measuring results that correspond to those of the measurements of samples of Example 1, produced according to the invention.<br><br>

Example 4<br>
In this example, a buffer system that consists of two layers of La2Zr2O7 (LZO) and a layer of gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO) was applied.<br>
The first two layers were applied in succession, according to Example 3, while going through all described process steps. Also, after this multiple coating, studies by means of RHEED and x-ray diffractometry on selected short samples showed measuring results that correspond to those of the measurements of samples of Example 1 produced according to the invention.<br>
The coating solution for the gadolinium-doped cerium oxide is based on a mixture that consists of cerium(III)acetyl acetonate in 2-methoxyethanol (cerium(IV)methoxyethoxide, Ce(CH3OCH2CH2O)4 xH2O; Alfa Aesar; 99.9% and 2 methoxyenthanol, CH3OCH2CH2OH; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie [Chemistry]; 99.8% anhydrous, boiling point 124ยฐC) and Gd(III)acetyl acetonate in propionic acid (Gd(III)acetyl acetonate, Gd(CH3CO2)3 xH2O; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, 99.9% and propionic acid, CH3CH2COOH: Merck, &gt; 99%, melting point: -21ยฐC, boiling point: 141ยฐC, flash point: 50ยฐC). The radio of gadolinium to cerium is 0.01/1 to 0.1/1. The solution concentration was set at 0.2 M. The coating solution was applied analogously to Example 3. The crystallization was carried out at temperatures of 1000ยฐC within one hour.<br>
The pole figures and the RHEED measurements (Figure 9) show a very good crystal orientation and a high degree of texture of the surface.<br>
Instead of a gadolinium-doped cerium oxide layer, a pure cerium oxide layer can be applied as an alternative. The coating solution consists here of Ce(III)-acetate, dissolved in propionic acid, 2-propanol and acetyl acetone (Ce(III)-acetate, Ce(CH3COO)3 xH2O; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, 99.9% and propionic acid, CH3CH2COOH: Merck, &gt; 99%, melting point: -21ยฐC, boiling point: 141ยฐC, flash point: 50ยฐC and 2-propanol (isopropanol), (CH3)2CHOH; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, 99.5%, boiling point 82ยฐC and acetyl acetone, CH3COCH2COCH3; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, &gt; 99%, boiling point 140ยฐC. The solvents had the ratio 5:2:1, whereby it can be varied in a wide range with a proportion of propionic acid &gt; 50%. The solution concentration was set at 0.25 M.    The coating solution was applied analogously to Example 3.    The<br><br>
