5HT2C RECEPTOR MODULATOR COMPOSITIONS <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which act as modulators of 5HT2c receptors, compositions including the compounds, and methods of using the compounds and compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Obesity is a life-threatening disorder in which there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality arising from concomitant diseases such as type II diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancer and gallbladder disease.<br>
Obesity is now a major healthcare issue in the Western World and increasingly in some third world countries. The increase in numbers of obese people is due largely to the increasing preference for high fat content foods but also the decrease in activity in most people's lives. In the last 10 years there has been a 30% increase in the incidence of obesity in the USA such that currently about 30% of the population of the USA is now considered obese.<br>
Whether someone is classified as overweight or obese is generally determined on the basis of their body mass index (BMI) which is calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by height squared (m2). Thus, the units of BMI are kg/m2 and it is possible to calculate the BMI range associated with minimum mortality in each decade of life. Overweight is defined as a BMI in the range 25-30 kg/m2, and obesity as a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 (see Table 1 below).<br><br>
TABLE 1: CLASSIFICATION OF WEIGHT BY BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)<br>
BMI		CLASSIFICATION<br>
18.5-24.9		Normal<br>
25.0-29.9		Overweight<br>
30.0-34.9		Obesity (Class I)<br>
35.0-39.9		Obesity (Class IT)<br>
&gt;40		Extreme Obesity (Class HI)<br>
As the BMI increases there is an increased risk of death from a variety of causes that are independent of other risk factors. The most common diseases associated with obesity are cardiovascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity aggravates the development of diabetes), gall bladder disease (particularly cancer) and diseases of reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest reduction in body weight can correspond to a significant reduction in the<br><br>
WO 2006/071740	PCT/US2005/046654<br>
risk of developing coronary heart disease.<br>
There are problems however with the BMI definition in that it does not take into account the proportion of body mass that is muscle in relation to fat (adipose tissue). To account for this, obesity can also be defined on the basis of body fat content: greater than 25% in males and greater than 30% in females.<br>
Obesity considerably increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well. Coronary insufficiency, atheromatous disease, and cardiac insufficiency are at the forefront of the cardiovascular complications induced by obesity. It is estimated that if the entire population had an ideal weight, the risk of coronary insufficiency would decrease by 25% and the risk of cardiac insufficiency and of cerebral vascular accidents would decrease by 35%. The incidence of coronary diseases is doubled in subjects less than 50 years of age who are 30% overweight. The diabetes patient faces a 30% reduced lifespan. After age 45, people with diabetes are about three times more likely than people without diabetes to have significant heart disease and up to five times more likely to have a stroke. These findings emphasize the inter-relations between risks factors for diabetes and coronary heart disease and the potential value of an integrated approach to the prevention of these conditions based on the prevention of obesity (Perry, I. J, et al., BMJ310, 560-564 (1995)).<br>
Diabetes has also been implicated in the development of kidney disease, eye diseases and nervous system problems. Kidney disease, also called nephropathy, occurs when the kidney's "filter mechanism" is damaged and protein leaks into urine in excessive amounts and eventually the kidney fails. Diabetes is also a leading cause of damage to the retina at the back of the eye and increases risk of cataracts and glaucoma. Finally, diabetes is associated with nerve damage, especially in the legs and feet, which interferes with the ability to sense pain and contributes to serious infections. Taken together, diabetes complications are one of the nation's leading causes of death.<br>
The first line of treatment is to offer diet and life style advice to patients such as reducing the fat content of their diet and increasing their physical activity. However, many patients find this difficult and need additional help from drug therapy to maintain results from these efforts.<br>
Most currently marketed products have been unsuccessful as treatments for obesity because of a lack of efficacy or unacceptable side-effect profiles. The most successful drug so far was the indirectly acting 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonist d-fenfluramine (Redux™) but reports of cardiac valve defects in up to one third of patients led to its withdrawal by the FDA in 1998.<br>
In addition, two drugs have recently been launched in the USA and Europe: Orlistat (Xenical™), a drug that prevents absorption of fat by the inhibition of pancreatic lipase, and Sibutramine (Reductil™), a 5-HT/noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor. However, side effects associated with these products may limit their long-term utility. Treatment with Xenical™ is<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/071740	PCT/US2005/046654<br>
reported to induce gastrointestinal distress in some patients, while Sibutramine has been associated with raised blood pressure in some patients.<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission plays an important role in numerous physiological processes both in physical and in psychiatric disorders. 5-HT has been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior. 5-HT appears to work by inducing a feeling of fullness or satiety so eating stops earlier and fewer calories are consumed. It has been shown that a stimulatory action of 5-HT on the 5HT2c receptor plays an important role in the control of eating and in the anti-obesity effect of d-fenfluramine. As the 5-HT2c receptor is expressed in high density in the brain (notably in the limbic structures, extrapyramidal pathways, thalamus and hypothalamus i.e. PVN and DMH, and predominantly in the choroid plexus) and is expressed in low density or is absent in peripheral tissues, a selective 5-HT2c receptor agonist can be a more effective and safe anti-obesity agent. Also, 5-HT2c knockout mice are overweight with cognitive impairment and susceptibility to seizure.<br>
It is believed that 5HT2c may play a role in obsessive compulsive disorder, some forms of depression, and epilepsy. Accordingly, agonists can have anti-panic properties, and properties useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction.<br>
hi sum, the 5HT2c receptor is a receptor target for the treatment of obesity and psychiatric disorders, and it can be seen that there is a need for selective 5HT2C agonists which safely decrease food intake and body weight. The present invention is directed to these, as well as other, important ends.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the combination of 5HT-2C receptor agonist compounds with other agents in order to decrease certain 5HT-2C receptor related behaviors such as feeding. While the 5HT-2C receptor agonist compounds described in the invention can be employed as the sole active agent in a pharmaceutical (i.e., mono-therapy), they can advantageously be used in combination with other active ingredients (i.e., combination-therapy) which can facilitate the therapeutic effect of the compound. Therefore, one aspect of the present invention includes methods of prophylaxis and/or treatment of a 5HT-2C receptor related condition such as obesity, or a condition related thereto, comprising administering to an individual in need of said prophylaxis and/or treatment a combination comprising an amount of a selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist in combination with an amount of one or more additional pharmaceutical agent as described herein. In one embodiment, the amount of the selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist and the amount of the one or more additional pharmaceutical agents alone are therapeutically sub-effective in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the condition but when combined these compounds act synergistically to prevent or treat the condition.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical agents that can be used in combination with the selective 5HT-2C receptor agonists include, for example, anti-obesity agents such as apolipoprotein-B secretion/microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (apo-B/MTP) inhibitors, MCR-4 agonists, cholescystokinin-A (CCK-A) agonists, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (for example, sibutramine), sympathornimetic agensts, ß3 adrenergic receptor agonists, dopamine agonists (for example, bromocriptine), melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor analogs, cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonists [for example, SR141716: N-(piperidin-l-yl)-5-(4-<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/071740	PCT/US2005/046654<br>
chlorophenyl)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-lH-pyrazole-3-carboxainide], melanin concentrating hormone antagonists, leptins (the OB protein), leptin analogues, leptin receptor agonists, galanin antagonists, lipase inhibitors (such as tetrahydrolipstatin, i.e., Orlistat), anorectic agents (such as a bombesin agonist), Neuropeptide-Y antagonists, thyromimetic agents, dehydroepiandrosterone or an analogue thereof, glucocorticoid receptor agonists or antagonists, orexin receptor antagonists, urocortin binding protein antagonists, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, ciliary neutrotrophic factors (such as Axokine™ available from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY and Procter &amp; Gamble Company, Cincinnati, OH), human agouti-related proteins (AGRP), ghrelin receptor antagonists, histamine 3 receptor antagonists or reverse agonists, neuromedin U receptor agonists, noradrenergic anorectic agents (for example, phentermine, mazindol and the like) and appetite suppressants (for example, bupropion).<br>
Other anti-obesity agents, including the agents set forth infra, are well known, or will be readily apparent in light of the instant disclosure, to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, the anti-obesity agents are selected from the group consisting of phentermine, orlistat, sibutramine, bromocriptine, ephedrine, leptin, and pseudoephedrine. In one embodiment, the anti-obesity agent is phentermine. In a further embodiment, compositions of the present invention and combination therapies are administered in conjunction with exercise and/or a sensible diet.<br>
It will be understood that the scope of combination therapy of the compounds of the present invention with other anti-obesity agents, anorectic agents, appetite suppressant and related agents is not limited to those listed above, but includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical agent or pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment of overweight and obese individuals.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutical agents, in addition to anti-obesity agents, that can be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include agents useful in the treatment of concomitant diseases. For example, individuals who are overweight or obese increase their risk of morbidity and mortality arising from concomitant diseases, such as, but not limited to, congestive heart failure, type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Treatment for one or more of the diseases cited herein include the use of one or more pharmaceutical agents known in the art belonging to the classes of drugs referred to, but not limited to, the following: sulfonylureas, meglitinides, biguanides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-y (i.e., PPAR-y) agonists, insulin, insulin analogues, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, cholesterol-lowering drugs (for example, fibrates that include: fenofibrate, bezafibrate, gemiibrozil, clofibrate and the like; bile acid sequestrants which include: cholestyramine, colestipol and the like; statins, and niacin), antiplatelet agents (for example, aspirin and adenosine diphosphate receptor<br>

antagonists that include: clopidogrel, ticlopidine and the like), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin H receptor antagonists and adiponectin.<br>
It will be understood that the scope of combination therapy of the compounds of the present invention with other pharmaceutical agents is not limited to those listed herein, supra or infra, but includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical agent or pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment diseases, conditions or disorders that are linked to overweight and obese individuals.<br>
Combination therapies have been used in the treatment of diseases; however, care must be taken when combining drugs since certain drugs can interact in a harmful manner. The combination of two agents that treat the same condition is generally expected to result in an additive effect meaning that the degree of the effect is the sum of the effect of each drag alone. Applicants disclose herein that the combination of a selective 5HT-2C agonist and another drug such as phentermine can result in a supra additive or synergistic effect on food intake (see Figure 2, 3 A and B, 4A and B). A synergistic effect means that the decrease in food intake observed with the combination therapy is greater than that seen by adding the decrease in food intake of each compound together. One advantage of using a synergistic combination therapy is that less of each compound is required to achieve a significant decrease in food intake and so fewer side effects can result from treatment. In some cases, side effects are not seen at the lower doses used. Also, in some cases, the side effect profile of one drug can mitigate or average out the side effect profile of. the other drug. For example, one of the drugs may result in increased blood pressure and the other drug results in lowered blood pressure so that the combination therapy does not effect blood pressure. Another potential advantage of combination therapy is that, since less compound is required, the cost of therapy can be reduced.<br>

In one aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising phentermine and a selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist.<br>
Phentermine (l,l-Dimethyl-2-phenyl-ethylamine) includes phentermine derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as, but not limited to, chlorphentermine (2-(4-<br>

Chloro-phenyl)-l,l-dimethyl-ethylamine) and the like. In one embodiment, phentemine is in the HC1 salt form.<br>
As used herein, the term "agonist" is intended to mean moieties that activate the intracellular response when they bind to the receptor, or enhance GTP binding to membranes. In the context of the present invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a 5HT2c receptor agonist of the invention can be utilized for modulating the activity of the 5HT2c receptor, decreasing food intake, inducing satiation (i.e., the feeling of fullness), controlling weight gain, treating obesity, decreasing body weight and/or affecting metabolism such that the recipient loses weight and/or maintains weight. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be used in the context of disorders and/or diseases where weight gain is a component of the disease and/or disorder such as, for example, obesity.<br>
The term "antagonist" is intended to mean moieties that competitively bind to the receptor at the same site as agonists (for example, the endogenous ligand), but which do not activate the intracellular response initiated by the active form of the receptor, and can thereby inhibit the intracellular responses by agonists or partial agonists. Antagonists do not diminish the baseline intracellular response in the absence of an agonist or partial agonist.<br>
As used herein the term "selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist" means an agonist compound that is selective for 5HT-2C receptor compared to other receptors that decrease food intake. For example, a selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist has a significantly higher binding affinity for the 5HT-2C receptor than for another receptor that can decrease food intake such as the 5HT-lb receptor. Therefore, for example, a selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist can have 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold, 90-fold, 100-fold, or 150-fold or more higher binding affinity for the 5HT-2C receptor than for another receptor such as the 5HT-lb receptor. As understood by one skilled in the art, selectivity can be determined, for example, using a receptor binding assay or a functional assay. One way to assess selectivity is to perform a feeding assay as disclosed herein (see Example 2) with a potential selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist and then challenge the animals with a selective 5HT-2C antagonist, for example, SB 242084 (Sigma). If the food intake effect is abolished (or very significantly decreased) then the effect is deemed to be occurring through the 5HT-2C receptor and not through a different receptor.<br>
The term "selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist" does not include compounds such as dexfenfluramine which are 5HT-releasing agents or compounds such as fiuoxetine which are 5HT uptake inhibitors. In addition, the term "selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist" does not include non-selective 5HT agonists such as m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) or m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) which have significant effects at the 5HT-lb receptor. For example, TFMPP causes decreased food intake; however, the decrease in food intake is not abolished when a selective 5HT-2C antagonist such as SB 242084 is added.<br>

The compositions of the present invention can be combined with the carrier in either solid or liquid form in a unit dose formulation. The pharmaceutical carrier must be compatible with the other ingredients in the composition and must be tolerated by the individual recipient. Other physiologically active ingredients can be incorporated into the pharmaceutical composition of the invention if desired, and if such ingredients are compatible with the other ingredients in the composition. Formulations can be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing the active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required proportions, and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape.<br>
Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting lubricants, and disintegrants can be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration can be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions, and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations can be in the form of dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives, and flavorings and colorants can be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms can be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a suitable liquid |       vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and searing an appropriate vial or ampoule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms.<br>
It is noted that the compositions of the invention are not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-i       care mandate that consideration be given for the use of compositions of the invention for the<br>

The invention provides a method of decreasing food intake of a mammal comprising administering to said mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of a combination comprising a selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist and an amount of phentermine, wherein said selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist and phentermine are provided in amounts to give a synergistic effect in decreasing food intake in said mammal. For example, the invention provides a method of decreasing food intake of a mammal comprising administering to said mammal a pharmaceuticalry effective amount of a combination comprising an amount of (R)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-li7-3-benzazepine and an amount of phentermine, wherein said (R)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine and phentermine are provided in amounts to give a synergistic effect in decreasing food intake in said mammal, m one embodiment, the amount of selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist, for example, (R)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-terrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine, alone and/or the amount of phentermine alone are therapeutically effective(i.e. showing a statistically significant effect) in decreasing food intake in said mammal and the compounds are provided in amounts to give a synergistic effect in decreasing food intake in said mammal.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount of selective 5HT-2C receptor agonist, for example, (R)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazeprne, alone and/or the<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/071740	PCT7US2005/046654<br>
amount of phentennine alone are therapeutically sub-effective in decreasing food intake in said mammal. As used herein, "therapeutically sub-effective" means that the 5HT-2C agonist and/or phentermine are provided in amounts that do not have a statistically significant effect on the measured parameter.

Food consumption over different time points was then determined by weighing the food cup at 1,2,4, and 6hr after the food was presented. Thus, food consumption was measured at 2, 3, 5, and 7hr post-injection in p.o. studies, and at 1.5,2.5, 4.5, and 6.5hr post-injection in i.p. and s.c. studies.<br>
Figures 1A-G illustrate the effects of seven different compounds on food intake in food-deprived rats. All compounds inhibited food intake dose-dependently. This effect was consistently most pronounced over the first lhr after food presentation. Some compounds (Figures 1A, 1C, and IE) maintained an inhibitory effect on food intake relative to vehicle-treated controls at 6hr after food presentation. Compounds were also shown to be effective via all routes of administration including p.o.<br>
