[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a structure for mounting a rear cushion unit to a main frame in a scooter-type vehicle in which a rear wheel is rotatably supported on a power unit which is swingably supported by the main frame and a lower end portion of the rear cushion unit is connected to the power unit, and a cushion side bracket provided on the upper end of the rear cushion unit is mounted on a cushion mounting portion provided on a frame main portion as a main rear portion of the main frame. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
The body frame of this type has been conventionally disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-218065. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described prior art vehicle is configured<br><br><br>
such that a cushion mounting portion is provided on a frame main portion in such a manner as to project downwardly from the frame main portion.  Accordingly, the length of the rear cushion unit in the vertical direction is relatively short, so that the stroke of the rear cushion unit becomes relatively small.  To improve the driver's riding comfort, it is expected to make large the stroke of the rear cushion unit. [0004]<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has<br>
been made, and an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a rear cushion unit mounting structure for a<br>
scooter-type vehicle, which is capable of making large<br>
the stroke of a rear cushion unit, thereby improving the<br>
driver's riding comfort.	<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object,<br>
there is provided a rear cushion unit mounting structure for a scooter-type vehicle in which a rear wheel is rotatably supported on a power unit which is   swingably supported by a main frame and a lower end portion of a rear cushion unit is connected to the power unit, and a cushion side bracket provided on the upper end of the rear cushion unit is<br><br><br>
mounted on a cushion mounting portion provided on a frame main portion as a main rear portion of the main frame, characterized in that an opening portion allowing the cushion side bracket to pass therethrough is provided in the frame main portion, and the cushion mounting portion is provided on the frame main portion in such a manner as to be raised upwardly from the frame main portion while crossing the opening portion. [0006]<br>
With this configuration, the cushion side bracket provided at the upper end of the rear cushion unit can be located at a higher position. Accordingly, it is possible to make large the stroke of the rear cushion unit and hence to improve the driver's riding comfort. [0007]<br>
According to an invention	in<br>
addition to the configuration of the invention<br>
., a sub-frame constituting a body frame in coÂ¬operation with the main frame is fastened to the frame main portion at a position near a connection portion between the cushion mounting portion and the frame main portion. With this configuration, the strength of the cushion mounting portion raised upwardly from the frame main portion can be reinforced by  the sub-frame. [0008]<br><br><br>

The function of this embodiment will be described below.  The body frame F of the scooter-type vehicle is formed by fastening the front frame 23, rear frame 24, and sub-frame 22 to each other. At least one of the frames 23, 24 and 22 is formed by casting (the front frame 23 and rear frame 24 are formed by casting in this embodiment).  Accordingly, by commonly using either the front frame 23 or the rear frame 24 to various kinds of motorcycles different in part of the body frames, it is possible to reduce the design and manufacturing costs of<br><br>
the body frame required for change in kind of the motorcycle.  Further, since it is possible to modularize the frames 23, 24 and 22 and perform the assembly of parts for each of the frames 23, 24 and 22, and hence to manufacture a scooter-type motorcycle by assembling the three modules having been sub-assembled to each other, and hence to improve the assembling efficiency in the process of manufacturing the scooter-type motorcycle. [0058]<br>
The front frame 23 including the head pipe 25, down frame 26, and floor supporting frames 272 and 211   is integrally formed by casting; the rear frame 24 formed by casting are fastened to the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27^ and the sub-frame 22 formed by welding the metal pipes is fastened to the rear end of' the rear frame 24. Accordingly, the sub-frame 22 relatively low in design and manufacturing costs is allowed to easily keep up with the change in any kind of the motorcycle by changing the metal pipes to be welded. [0059]<br>
The rear frame 24 is fastened to the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 271 of the front frame 23 by overlapping and fastening the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 provided at the branched front ends of the rear frame 24 to the front fastening plates 562 and<br><br><br>
561 provided at the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 211 .     Each of the front fastening plates 562 and 561 and the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 is, as shown in Fig. 24(a), formed into a shape tilted forwardly, downwardly.  Accordingly, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 561, 612, and 6l1 to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 24(b), the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 561 612 and 611 are disposed at positions relatively close to the head pipe 25.  With this configuration, as shown in Fig. 24(b), even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear fastening plates 6l2 and 611 on the rear frame 24 side to the front fastening plates 562 and 561 on the front frame 23 side and thereby the position of the head pipe 25 is tilted from the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction.  Thus, it is possible to make relatively small displacement amounts Â§1 and 2 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction, and hence to improve the positioning accuracy of the front wheel WF and the rear wheel WR to the vehicular body. [0060]<br>
Further, the extension line L of the axial line of at least one the pairs of bolts 64 for fastening the<br><br><br>
front fastening plates 562 and 561 to the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 (the extension lines L of the axial lines of the pair of bolts 64 in this embodiment) is set to pass through the space between the upper end of the steering handlebar 32 supported by  the head  pipe 25 and the axle 31 of the front wheel WF, so that the above fastening planes are disposed at positions closer to the head pipe 25. As a result, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23, it is possible to make small the displacement amounts 5l and 2   of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction. [0061]<br>
On the contrary, if the fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 are not tilted forwardly, downwardly as shown in Fig. 25(a), but extend substantially in the horizontal direction, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the above fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 25(b), the fastening planes are disposed at positions relatively apart from the head pipe 25. As a result, when there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to<br><br><br>
the front frame 23, the displacement amounts l and 2 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction becomes relatively large.<br>
[0062]<br>
Since the rear fastening plates 612 and 611 are overlapped from below to the front fastening plates 562 and 561 a space for disposing the rear frame 24 over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 211   is not required to be ensured. As a result, it is possible to allow the step floor 41b to extend up to a position over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 and hence to make large the space of the step floor 41b.<br>
[0063]<br>
Since the fitting recesses 58 are provided in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 and the fitting projections 63 to be fitted in the fitting recesses 58 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to improve the assembling accuracy in fastening and assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23.<br>
[0064]<br>
Further, since three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting recesses 58 are formed<br><br>
in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 and three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting projections 63 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to further improve the accuracy in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23. [0065]<br>
Since the down frame 26 of the front frame 23 is formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, downwardly, the front wheel WF is allowed to be closer to the down frame 26 without reducing the cross-sectional shape of the down frame 26.  Accordingly, it is possible to shorten the length of the wheel base while avoiding interference between the front wheel WF and the down frame 26, and sufficiently ensuring the space of the step floor 41b. [0066]<br>
Since the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 211  are each formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 211  are deflected in such a manner that the areas of the upper opening portions thereof are changed.  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort. [0067]<br>
Since the ribs 52 extending in the longitudinal<br><br>
direction are provided on the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are allowed to be deflected with their rigidities not reduced so much, [0068]<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 211   are disposed on both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, the step floor 41b can be disposed in such a manner as to extend up to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, and hence to sufficiently ensure the space of the step floor 41b on the front side without enlarging the wheel base. [0069]<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are connected to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26 via the pair of curved portions 502 and 501 expanded forwardly from the front surface of the lower end of the down frame 26, the connection portions between the down frame 26 and the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are expanded forwardly as the curved portions 502 and 501 although the front ends of the pair of floor supporting frames 272 and 271 extending in line are disposed at the connection portions.  As a result, it is possible to sufficiently increase the strength of the<br><br><br>
connection portions.<br>
[0070]<br>
In addition, the front wheel WF can be disposed close to the curved portions 502 and 501 side while ensuring a gap between the front wheel WF and the curved portions 502 and 501 by providing the recesses 51 on the opposed inner sides of the curved portions 502 and 501 so that it is possible to avoid an inconvenience that the wheel base is enlarged by the fact that the front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271 are connected to the down frame 26 via the curved portions 502 and 501<br>
[0071]<br>
With respect to the vibration-proof link 66 for swingably supporting the engine E of the power unit P on the body frame F, the pair of right and left links 682 and. 681 are provided for swingably connecting the pair of right and left engine side brackets 672 and 671 provided on the engine E to the body frame F, and the cross-member 69 is provided for connecting the right and left links 682 and 681 to each other. The cross-member 69 is formed into the approximately U-shape opened downwardly, and is disposed at a position astride the intake pipe 83 for connecting the carburetor 35 disposed behind the links 682 and 681 to the engine E on the front side of the links 682 and 681. Accordingly, as compared with a structure in<br><br>
which the carburetor 35 is disposed in front of the links 682 and 681, the degree of freedom in arrangement of the carburetor 35 becomes larger. [0072]<br>
Further, since the engine E is a four-cycle engine disposed substantially in the horizontal direction and the cross-member 69 is disposed between the luggage box 39 mounted on the body frame F under the seat 42 and the engine E, it is possible to prevent the position of the seat 42 from becoming higher in the case of ensuring the free motion of the cross-member 69 while avoiding the interference with the luggage box 39. [0073]<br>
Since the opening portion 87 allowing the cushion side bracket 86 provided at the upper end of the rear    cushion unit 33 to pass therethrough is provided in the frame main portion 24a of the rear portion of the main frame 21 of the body frame F; the cushion mounting portion 88 raised upwardly from the frame main portion 24a while crossing the opening portion 87 is mounted on the frame main portion 24a; and the cushion side bracket 86 is mounted on the cushion mounting portion 88, it is possible to set the cushion side bracket 86 at a high position, and hence to make larger the stroke of the rear cushion unit 33.  This makes it possible to improve the<br><br>
riding comfort. [0074]<br>
Since the sub-frame 22 constituting the body frame F in co-operation of the main frame 21 is fastened to the main frame 21 at a position near the connection portion between the cushion mounting portion 88 and the frame main portion 24a, it is possible to reinforce the strength of the cushion mounting portion 88 raised from the frame main portion 24a by the sub-frame 22. [0075]<br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been described, the present invention is not limited to<br>
the embodiment, and it is to be understood that many<br>
changes in design may be made without departing the scope<br>
of the claims.	<br>
[0076]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention described in claim 1, the cushion side bracket provided at the upper end of the rear cushion unit can be set to locate at a higher position. Accordingly, it is possible to make large the stroke of the rear cushion unit and hence to improve the driver's riding comfort. [0077]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2,<br><br><br>
the strength of the cushion mounting portion raised upwardly from the frame main portion can be reinforced by the sub-frame.<br>
