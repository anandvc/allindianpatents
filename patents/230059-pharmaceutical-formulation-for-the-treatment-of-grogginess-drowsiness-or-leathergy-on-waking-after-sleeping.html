USE OF A COMPOUND IN THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISORDERS<br>
The invention relates to a novel use of a known compound, in particular to the use of that compound in combination with at least one further active pharmaceutical agent in the treatment of sleep disorders experienced by a person, whatever the cause of those disorders.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for the treatment or prevention of grogginess, drowsiness or lethargy on waking from sleep, to the use of triprolidine in combination with at least one further active pharmaceutical agent as an aid to waking refreshed and to the use of triprolidine in combination with at least one further active pharmaceutical agent as both a sleep aid and a means to wake refreshed thereafter.<br>
Although much is known about the use of various pharmaceutical sleeping formulations as aids to sleeping, little has been published about the possibility of a sleep aid enabling an individual to wake refreshed as opposed to merely experiencing degrees of hangover effects such as grogginess, drowsiness, lethargy, etc.<br>
Many people experience, either on an occasional or chronic basis, difficulty in achieving a satisfactory amount of sleep. Such a problem may be attributable to external factors, such as factors causing stress or anxiety, to excessive use or misuse of stimulants (such as caffeine) or depressants (e.g. alcohol), or to temporary disturbance<br><br>
of the person's lifestyle, e.g. occasioned by shift-working or long-haul travel through different timezones. Difficulty in sleeping may also be caused by chronic pain, e.g. pain caused by sciatica, etc. Whatever the cause, the condition may be generally considered to be a sleep disorder and may commonly be referred to as "insomnia". It may manifest as difficulty in falling asleep and/or wakefulness during the desired period of sleep, leading to a shortened duration of sleep and/or disruption of the normal pattern of sleep.<br>
The result of these difficulties will commonly be fatigue during the period of wakefulness, which may itself lead to stress and exacerbate the problem.<br>
Various products are available to assist a user in overcoming problems of the type described above. Such products, commonly called "sleeping pills" may, however, suffer from disadvantageous side-effects. For example, while the products may be effective in sending a user to sleep, their effect may be of short duration, resulting in premature wakening. In other cases, the user may achieve the desired length of sleep but may awake with feelings of grogginess (a "hangover" effect). Such products may also be addictive. Tolerance may also develop to the drug which results in a decrease in effectiveness.<br>
In other circumstances, a person may not suffer from sleep disorders as such, but may simply wish to achieve a particularly good night's sleep. In other words, the use of such products may be elective, rather than necessitated by a clinical need.<br><br>
In addition to this well documented problem, many people also experience difficulties on waking such as grogginess, lethargy and drowsiness; difficulty in becoming fully alert and an absence of feeling refreshed. These phenomena are not necessarily linked to the number of hours sleep or always encountered as a result of drugs taken prior to sleep such as alcohol, medication, etc. Furthermore, individuals encountering tiredness during waking hours and other individuals having difficulty with insomnia resort to sleep aids in an attempt to increase or improve sleeptime rest. Nevertheless, it is also well documented that a negative side effect of sleep aids can also be an increased feeling of grogginess on waking.<br>
Triprolidine, (E) -2- [1- (4-methylphenyl-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propenyl]pyridine, is a first generation anti-histamine and has been marketed alone and, in combination with pseudoephedrine (a decongestant), for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Triprolidine is known to have sedative effects and has been shown to have an adverse effect on the cognitive functions of users. These are undesirable side-effects for an anti-histamine and may account for the limited extent to which triprolidine has been used in clinical practice. More recently-developed, second generation anti-histamines are less prone to such side effects, and most recent studies involving triprolidine have used that compound as a positive control against which the more modern anti-histamine compounds have been compared. Such studies have generally been conducted using healthy volunteers following day time dosing, rather than persons suffering from any form of sleep disorder, and have been concerned with the effects of the drug on day-time performance.<br><br>
One study is known to have investigated the effect of triprolidine (amongst other anti-histamines) on sleep directly (Nicolson et al, Neuropharmacology (1985) 24_, 3, 245-250) . In that study single doses of triprolidine (lOmg or 20mg sustained release) were given at bedtime to volunteers. It was found that triprolidine did not significantly alter "sleep onset latency" (i.e. the time required to fall asleep) compared with placebo. It was also found that, compared with placebo, triprolidine had no effect on wakefulness during sleep or total sleep time.<br>
It has now been found that, contrary to what might have been expected in the light of previous studies, triprolidine can be used for inducing, prolonging or enhancing sleep, and that its use is accompanied by important benefits in comparison with other compounds known for this purpose that could not have been predicted.<br>
It has also been found that triprolidine surprisingly increases the level of refreshedness felt upon waking if taken before sleeping. Advantageously, this effect is observed whilst triprolidine also acts as a sleep aid in facilitating the onset of stage I sleep and whilst enhancing sleep.<br>
The increased level of refreshedness felt upon waking after taking triprolidine prior to sleeping was not expected and there has been no known disclosure of such an effect previously encountered.<br>
In many medical conditions, lack of sleep is experienced as  a  side  effect  or  direct  symptom of  the  medical<br><br>
condition. Often, a patient with such a condition will be prescribed sleep aids as well as being treated for the specific medical condition.<br>

It will also be understood that the term "inducing, prolonging and/or enhancing sleep" may encompass the treatment of a sleep disorder, i.e. a difficulty in achieving satisfactory sleep due to some internal or external factor, e.g. pain, stress or anxiety, misuse of stimulants or depressants, or temporary disturbance of lifestyle. Alternatively, it may encompass elective desires on the part of a user to achieve a particularly beneficial period of sleep. Such a desire may, for instance, arise in anticipation of important events the following day for which a person may wish to be fully alert and refreshed. In any event, the term "sleep disorder" as used herein should be taken to independently include any one or more of the foregoing and, specifically, any objective or subjective difficulty in an individual in any one or more of the following:-<br>
-	getting to sleep, especially stage 1 sleep<br>
-	staying asleep<br>
-	sleeping well<br>
-	waking refreshed<br>
-	waking alert<br>
-	keeping awake<br>
-	keeping alert<br>
-	keeping refreshed<br>
-	performing well the next day<br>
The present invention also extends to the use of triprolidine as a sleep aid. By definition, a sleep aid extends to use by a healthy individual who elects for a sleep aid, for example, before an important event.  The<br><br>
term "sleep aid" as used herein includes any one or more of the following benefits:-<br>
-	faster onset to stage 1 sleep<br>
-	increasing duration of sleep periods<br>
-	decreasing the number and duration of awakenings<br>
-	increasing total duration of sleep<br>
-	increasing probability of sleeping well<br>
improving insomnia,  especially chronic or mild-moderate insomnia<br>
-	decreasing disturbances during sleeptime<br>
-	improving quality of sleep,<br>
-	as determined by any standard or known subjective or objective measures,  for instance the Karolinska scale, Loughborough   sleep   log,   Leeds   sleep   evaluation questionnaire or actimetry.<br>
The method of aiding an individual's sleep typically indicates aiding in the sense of providing any one or more of the above mentioned benefits.<br>
Typically, the percentage of individuals who, after taking a dose of triprolidine before sleeptime, wake refreshed after sleeping is in the range 1-100%, more typically/ 5-70%, most typically 10-3 5%. An especially typical range as aforesaid is 15-30% or even more especially 20-30%.

It will be understood that references herein to "triprolidine" include the compound (E)-2-[1-(4-methylphenyl-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propenyl]pyridine as well as salts thereof that are acceptable for administration to the human body. Acid addition salts may particularly be mentioned, including the hydrobromide and hydrochloride salts. The hydrochloride salt, i.e. triprolidine hydrochloride, is particularly preferred for use in accordance with the invention. Solvates of triprolidine, notably hydrates, e.g. monohydrates, and to the extent that triprolidine may exist in polymorphic forms, all such polymorphs are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The term "refreshed" as used herein means an individual waking refreshed or alert after a dose of triprolidine has been administered prior to sleep. In this context, the determination of whether an individual is feeling "refreshed" may be made by a subj ective test. An example subjective test is measuring the degree of alertness on, for instance, the Karolinska scale or the feeling of being refreshed as determined by, for instance, the Loughborough sleep log. Alternatively, refreshedness may be based upon the inverse relationship between refreshedness and relative levels of sleepiness as determined by the Karolinska scale.<br><br>
By the term individual as referred to herein is meant any mammal or human.<br>
The administration of the active ingredient in accordance with the invention may be beneficial in that there is evidence that users feel more refreshed upon awakening, which is not the case with other treatments for sleep disorders, or indeed in the absence of any treatment, and do not experience grogginess or a "hangover" effect after the required number of hours sleep. This too is surprising in view of the fact that such feelings have been reported in relation to other active ingredients which have a comparable mode of action to that of triprolidine. Furthermore, there is no evidence that repeated use of the active ingredient over the course of several days leads to any loss of effect.<br>
The administration of the active ingredient in accordance with the invention may also be beneficial in that it may decrease the time required for a user to fall asleep, which is surprising in view of the previously-reported studies on volunteers. In addition, the total period of sleep may be increased and the incidence and duration of night-time wakenings experienced by the user may be reduced.<br>
The active ingredients are preferably formulated in such a manner as to lead to non-sustained, substantially immediate release of the active ingredient, i.e. the formulation is preferably free of ingredients intended or effective to prolong or sustain release of the active ingredient.<br><br>
Administration of the active ingredient in accordance with the invention may be by a variety of routes. However, most commonly the active ingredient will be administered orally. An alternative mode of administration may be administration to the mucous membranes of the nasal passages. Further modes of administration are transdermal (e.g. using transdermal patches or bandages), rectal (e.g. as suppositories), optical, sub-lingual, buccal and pulmonary.<br>
For oral administration, the active ingredient may be put up in a variety of dosage forms. Most commonly, the active ingredient will be formulated and administered as a tablet or the like. However, formulation as capsules, lozenges, drinks or as a syrup (solution or suspension) may also be possible, as may other dosage forms such as a consumable film for instance a buccal wafer or oral sprays.<br>
For nasal administration, the active ingredient may be formulated as a solution, emulsion or suspension and administered by means of a spray using a suitable delivery device. Alternatively, for pulmonary administration, the active ingredient may be administered as a powder, either from a pressurised aerosol delivery device or from a so-called dry powder inhaler.<br>
For formulation in the presently preferred form, i.e. as a tablet, the active ingredient will generally be combined with various excipients in a manner which is known per se. In particular, the tablet will generally comprise one or more diluents or bulking agents. A diluent may also serve as a disintegrant, or the formulation may incorporate a<br><br>
separate disintegrant. A lubricant may also be included to facilitate release of the formed tablets from the tabletting dies of a tablet forming machine.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a tablet for enabling an individual to wake refreshed after sleeping, which tablet comprises triprolidine or a salt or hydrate thereof, in combination with at least one further active pharmaceutical agent as active ingredient in admixture with one or more diluents and/or a disintegrant, the tablet comprising more than O.Olmg and less than 4.9mg triprolidine.<br>
As noted above, the formulation may incorporate one diluent or bulking agent, or more than one. Formulations are preferred which contain blends of two or more diluents, one of which may also serve as a disintegrant.<br>
Preferred materials for the diluent or bulking agents include polysaccharides and derivatives thereof, and saccharides.<br>
Polysaccharides which may be used include starch, e.g. maize starch, cellulose, e.g. powdered cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose, water-insoluble modified starches, e.g. sodium carboxymethyl starch, water-insoluble cellulose derivatives, e.g. croscarmellose sodium (cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and alginic acid.<br>
Another preferred form of diluent is a saccharide. Suitable saccharides include, for example, sucrose, lactose,   dextrose,   sorbitol,  mannitol,  xylitol  and<br><br>
maltodextrin. Lactose and sucrose are preferred saccharides. Lactose is especially preferred. Saccharide diluents may also be beneficial in terms of modifying the taste of the formulation.<br>
Particularly preferred diluents are dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose,  e.g.  the products  sold as Avicel PH-101 and Avicel PH-102 (Avicel is a Trade Mark) by the FMC Corporation of Philadelphia,  Pa. , USA,  and lactose.<br>
Another preferred disintegrant is a croscarmellose sodium, for example the product sold as Ac-Di-Sol (Ac-Di-Sol is a Trade Mark) by the FMC Corporation. This product, when included in the formulation, also serves as a disintegrant.<br>
The disintegrant has the effect of causing the tablet<br>
composition to disintegrate under the conditions found in<br>
the gastro-intestinal tract. Apart from croscarmellose<br>
sodium, examples of disintegrants include one or more of<br>
wheat starch, maize starch, potato starch, sodium starch<br>
glycolate, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
alginic acid, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
magnesium aluminium silicate. Preferred disintegrants are<br>
those which swell on the action of water thus causing the<br>
ingredients in the tablet to be pushed apart and out into	'<br>
the aqueous disintegration medium. The preferred disintegrant is croscarmellose sodium. The disintegrant is present at an effective disintegrating amount, for example up to 25% by weight of the composition, more preferably 1-25% w/w, further preferably 3-20% w/w and most preferably 5-15% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
Particularly preferred compositions, in a particular tablet compositions, include a blend of a cellulosic diluent, a saccharide diluent and a disintegrant. The preferred cellulosic diluent is microcrystalline cellulose, the preferred saccharide is lactose and the preferred disintegrant is croscarmellose sodium.<br>
A preferred formulation, in particular a tablet formulation, comprises the cellulosic diluent, the saccharide diluent and the disintegrant in the ratio of 0.01-10 parts by weight of cellulosic diluent, 0.01-10 parts by weight of saccharide diluent to 1 part by weight of disintegrant. More preferably, the formulation contains 2-5 parts by weight of cellulosic diluent per part by weight of disintegrant, and 4 to 7 parts by weight of saccharide diluent per part by weight of disintegrant.<br>
The diluents and/or disintegrant are preferably incorporated into the compositions in finely divided (powder) form.<br>
The  diluents  and  disintegrant  preferably  together constitute in excess of 80% w/w of the tablet formulation, more preferably in excess of 90% w/w, and most preferably in excess of 94% w/w.<br>
The lubricant may be, for example, stearic acid, a metallic stearate, a polyethylene glycol of molecular weight of 4,000 or more, or purified talc. The preferred lubricant is a metallic stearate, particularly magnesium stearate,  which may be present in the formulation at<br><br>
relatively low levels, typically less than 1% or 0.5% by weight.<br>
It has been found to be particularly advantageous for the tablet formulation to be formed with a coating, preferably a sugar coating or film coating process, more preferably a film coating comprising a hydrophilic polymer, particularly a cellulose derivative such as a methylated cellulose derivative, e.g. hydroxyethylmethylcellulose and, particularly, hydroxypropylmethy1cellulose.<br>
The coating may also comprise an inorganic filler material, most preferably French chalk, to enhance the physical properties of the coating and prevent cracking etc, and also a pigment, e.g. a titanium dioxide pigment dispersion.<br>
It has been found that, in addition to improving the appearance of the tablet and acting as a barrier to ingress of moisture, the film coating is also effective in masking the taste of the active ingredient.<br>
Administration of the active ingredient in accordance with the invention may be by means of a consumable film. The films may be edible and upon disintegration, the triprolidine and other active may be absorbed via the buccal cavity or the digestive tract. Preferably, the triprolidine and other active are formulated to be absorbed via the digestive tract. Suitable formulations are disclosed in WO 00/18365, the content of which insofar as it relates to consumable film formulations which may incorporate  triprolidine  hydrochloride  or  methods  of<br><br>
producing such formulations is incorporated herein by-reference .<br>
For consumable film formulation in the presently preferred form, the active ingredient will generally be combined with various excipients in a manner which is known per se.<br>
Suitable excipients for consumable films are disclosed in WO 00/18365 and these are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a consumable film for enabling an individual to wake refreshed after sleeping, which film comprises triprolidine as active ingredient in combination with at least one further active pharmaceutical agent in admixture with one or more suitable excipients, the film comprising more than O.Olmg and less than 4 . 9mg triprolidine. The film is preferably, substantially free from menthol, thymol, methyl salicylate and eucalyptol.<br>
The consumable film is one adapted to adhere and dissolve in a mouth of a consumer and comprises at least one water soluble  polymer.  Preferably,  the  said  water  soluble polymer is selected from the group consisting of pellulan, hydroxypropylmethyl  cellulose,  hydroxyethyl  cellulose, hydroxypropyl    cellulose,    polyvinyl    pyrrolidone, carboxymethyl   cellulose,   polyvinyl   alcohol,   sodium alginate, polyethylene glycol, tragacanth gum, guar gum, acacia    gum,    arabic    gum,    polyacrylic    acid, methylmethacrylate   copolymer,   carboxyvinyl   polymer, amylose,  high  amylose  starch,  hydroxypropylated  high amylose starch, dextrin, pectin, chitin, chitosan, levan,<br><br>
elsinan, collagen, gelatin, zein, gluten, soy protein isolate, whey protein isolate, casein and mixtures thereof.<br>
; Preferably, other film excipients may be utilised and these may be selected from water, antimicrobial agents, additional film-forming agents, plasticizing agents, flavouring agents, sulphur precipitating agents, saliva stimulating agents, buffering agents, cooling agents, surfactants, stabilising agents, emulsifying agents, thickening agents, binding agents, colouring agents, sweeteners, fragrances and the like.<br>
Saliva stimulating agents can also be added as film excipients. Saliva stimulating agents include food acids such as citric, lactic, malic, succinic, ascorbic, adipic, fumaric and tartaric acids. Preferred food acids are citric, malic and ascorbic acids. The amount of saliva stimulating agents in the film is from about 0.01 to about 12 wt%, preferably about 1 wt% to about 10 wt%, even more preferably about 2.5 wt% to about 6 wt%.<br>
Buffering agents include salts of the aforementioned acids such as alkali metal salts of the food acids detailed above. An especially preferred buffering agent is sodium citrate. The amount of buffering agent may be in accordance with that suitable to complement the saliva stimulating agent as detailed above but is typically 0.01 - 12 wt%.<br>
Preferred plasticizing agents for the films include triacetin in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 20wt%,<br><br>
preferably about 0 to 2 wt%.  Other suitable plasticizing agents include monoacetin and diacetin.<br>
Preferred cooling agents for the films include monomethyl succinate, in amounts ranging from about 0.001 to 2.0 wt%, preferably about 0.2 to about 0.4 wt%. A monomethyl succinate containing cooling agent is available from Mane. Inc. Other suitable cooling agents include WS3, WS23, Ultracool II and the like.<br>
Preferred surfactants for the films include mono and diglycerides of fatty acids and polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters, such as, Atmos 300 and Polysorbate 80. The surfactant can be added in amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 15 wt %, preferably about 1 to about 5 wt% of the film. Other suitable surfactants include pluronic acid, sodium lacryl sulphate, and the like.<br>
Preferred stabilising agents for the films include xanthan gum, locust bean gum and carrageenan, in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 10wt%, preferably about 0.1 to about 2wt% of the film. Other suitable stabilising agents include guar gum and the like.<br>
Preferred emulsifying agents for the films include triethanolamine stearate, quaternary ammonium compounds, acacia, gelatin, lecithin, bentonite, veegum and the like, in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 3wt%, preferably about 0.01 to about 07 wt% of the film.<br>
Preferred thickening agents for the films include methylcellulose, carboxyl methylcellulose, and the like,<br><br>
in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 2 0wt%, preferably about 0.01 to about 5 wt%.<br>
Preferred binding agents for the films include starch, in amounts ranging from about 0 to about 10wt%, preferably about 0.01 to about 2 wt% of the film.<br>
Suitable sweeteners for the films that can be included are those well known in the art and similarly, flavourings and colourings that can be included are those known in the art. A suitable definition of sweeteners, flavourings and colourings is found in WO 00/18365, page 12 line 17 - page 16 line 19, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The tablet formulation may be prepared by a process involving dry blending or wet or dry granulation. However, it is preferred to use a manufacturing method which involves direct compression into a tablet without an intermediate, e.g. -a wet or dry granulation, stage.<br>
The formulation may be made by dry mixing the active ingredient with the other ingredients, e.g. the lubricant and diluents and disintegrant, e.g. in a powder blending machine. It is particularly preferred that the active ingredients are dispersed by progressive dilution with agitation in a proportion, e.g. about one-half, of the excipients so as to achieve even distribution of the active ingredient in the excipients, and then to add the remainder of the excipients with further agitation and mixing. The mixture may then be compressed in a tablet forming machine and a coating, preferably a sugar coat or a film coat may then be applied to the tablets so formed<br><br>
by spraying the tablets with a solution or suspension of the coating-forming ingredients while the tablets are tumbled.<br>
Such a direct tablet compression manufacturing method has been found to be beneficial in that it avoids problems attributable to crystal growth and changes in morphology which might occur in a wet granulation process.<br>
Other, currently less preferred, dosage forms may be prepared in a manner which is generally known per se. For example, syrups may be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active ingredient in a liquid vehicle, e.g. water, optionally with suspending agents or the like, e.g. cellulose derivatives, gums etc.<br>
For administration by inhalation, via nose or mouth, the formulations may be formulated with a compressed gas or liquified gas propellant, e.g. any conventionally used propel1ant such as a chlorofluorocarbon, hydrofluorocarbon, compressed hydrocarbon, nitrogen etc. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated as a dry powder, generally in admixture with a diluent such as crystalline lactose.<br>
The amount of active ingredient to be administered in a single dose may vary quite widely, depending inter alia on the desired effect and the mode of administration. However, a formulation for oral administration, e.g. a tablet, will generally contain at least 0.01 and up to 20mg of active ingredient, more commonly at least 0. 5mg and less than lOmg of active ingredient, most commonly no more than 5mg, e.g. 1.25 or 2.5mg.  Doses of formulations<br><br>
for administration by nasal and sub-lingual administration, which would be expected to deliver the active ingredient more quickly and efficiently, may contain less active ingredient, e.g. between 0.1 and l.Omg, e.g. about 0.5mg and generally at a level of 20% of the oral dose levels mentioned herein. Preferably, such nasal and sub-lingual formulations contain active ingredient in the range 0.01-2.5mg, more preferably, 0.05-1.Omg and most preferably, 0.1-0.5mg.<br>
In general, the desired dose (which may comprise one or more unit doses, e.g. one or two tablets or the like) will be taken by a user prior to the desired time at which it is desired for the composition to take effect. Most commonly, the dose will be taken at night-time, i.e. prior to the user sleeping through hours of darkness. Typically, the dose may thus be taken after 8pm in the evening or later, say after 9pm or after 10pm. Typically, it may be recommended that the user take the composition between 0 , more commonly 1 minute and 2 hours prior to the time at which he or she wishes to fall asleep. Most commonly, the composition may be taken about 10 to 3 0 minutes prior to that time. In addition, however, the active ingredient may be effective, particularly at lower doses, in restoring sleep, e.g. in the event of night-time waking.<br>
Preferably, the use of triprolidine in any aspect of the invention as defined herein is its use as active ingredient. Preferably, the triprolidine in any aspect of the invention defined herein is in the form of a non-toxic effective dose, preferably, suitable for any given mammal or human and determined in accordance with age and weight.<br><br>
Preferably, to obtain the benefits on waking or otherwise as defined herein, the active ingredient of triprolidine administered before sleeptime is less than 10mg, typically less than 5mg, more preferably, less than 4. 5mg, most preferably less than 4.0mg. Especially preferred is a dose as aforesaid of less than 3. 5mg and most especially preferred is a dose of less than 3.0mg. Typically, the dose of triprolidine is between 0.01 and lO.Omg, preferably, between 0.01 and 4.9mg, more preferably, between 0.1 and 4.5mg, most preferably between 0.5 and 4mg. Especially preferred is a dose of between 1 and 3.5mg and more especially a dose of between 2.0 and 3.0mg. Most especially preferred is a dose as aforesaid of about 2.5mg or 1.25mg. Preferably, the above dosage levels are based on triprolidine hydrochloride monohydrate and amounts of other salts or hydrates should be varied accordingly to deliver the equivalent amount of active ingredient.<br>
In the formulations of the present invention, the triprolidine may be in any suitable release form such as a slow release, sustained release, immediate release or uncontrolled release form. The formulation may also be in any one or more of the following delivery forms:-<br>
Pastilles<br>
lozenge<br>
chewable tablets<br>
fondant-fill tablets<br>
coated or uncoated tablets<br>
sub-lingual tablets<br>
fast-melt tablets<br><br>
hot or cold drinks<br>
syrups<br>
drops<br>
emulsions<br>
dry powder<br>
suspension<br>
transdermal patch<br>
suppository<br>
consumable films such as buccal wafers<br>
sub-lingual and nasal sprays<br>
Preferably, the dose of the triprolidine and further active agent in accordance with the invention may be taken by an individual before it is desired to go to sleep (sleeptime), preferably less than two hours before sleeptime, more preferably, less than one hour before sleeptime, most preferably, less than 2 0 minutes before sleeptime. Especially preferred is to take the dose of triprolidine and further active agent less than 15 minutes before sleeptime.<br>
Preferably, the dose of triprolidine and further active agent is less than 4 doses per day (24 hour period), more preferably, less than 3 doses per day, most preferably less than 2 doses per day. Especially, preferred is 1 dose per day.<br>
The packaging of the invention as defined herein may be in any suitable form such as, for example, a blister pack, bottle, tamper-proof container, sachet, box, etc. The packaging of the invention may be associated with instructions for any of the features or preferred features of the invention as defined herein.<br><br>
For the avoidance of doubt, reference to the "use of the present invention" herein should be taken to include "the method of the invention", and "use of a pharmaceutical formulation" as well as use of the present invention per se.<br>
Advantageously, the use of triprolidine and further active agent in the present invention results in a reduced hangover or morning grogginess effect as compared with other sleep aids or sleep disorder remedies. More advantageously, the use of triprolidine and further active agent in the present invention provides an improved degree of refreshedness or more refreshed feeling upon waking as determined by the Loughborough sleep log, Leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire or Karolinska scale and as compared with placebo.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, reference to quantities of triprolidine herein should be taken as references to quantities of the hydrochloride mono hydrate (HC1. H20) form. However, it should be appreciated that the invention extends to other forms, including all pharmaceutically active salts and hydrates thereof.<br>
The term refreshed as used herein may be substituted by any term selected from alert, invigorated, revitalised, re-energised, recharged, rejuvenated, attentive, awake or words having the like effect or equivalent general meaning and the term refreshedness may also be substituted by the grammatical equivalent thereof from the words aforesaid. In addition, the term alert as used herein can be substituted by any of the above alternative terms.<br><br>
Non limiting embodiments of the invention will now be illustrated with reference to the accompanying examples.<br>
Experimental<br>
The dosage forms were prepared as tablets, lozenges and syrups as follows.<br>
Tablet Manufacture<br>
Sieve the lactose, pregelatised maise starch, maize starch, ac-di-sol and active materials into a granulator mixer and mix for 5 minutes. In a side vessel prepare the granulating solution using plasdone and water. Add this solution to the granulator, until a suitable granule is formed. Dry the granule in a fluid bed dryer and sieve. Sieve the magnesium stearate through a 3 0 mesh sieve and add to the granule and blend for 2 minutes. Compress the blend to the appropriate tablet weight.<br>
Lozenge Manufacture<br>
Sieve the calcium carbonate and active materials through a 30 mesh sieve into a granulator mixer. Mix for 5 minutes. In a side vessel prepare the granulating solution using plasdone and water. Add this solution to the granulator, until a suitable granule is formed.<br>
Dry the granule in a fluid bed dryer and sieve. Sieve the aerosil and magnesium stearate through a 30 mesh sieve and add to the granule and blend for 2 minutes.<br><br>
The base solution (sugar and glucose) is pumped into the pre-cooker and heated to 114C +/- 5C to increase the solids content from approximately 72% solids to approximately 85% solids. The heated mass is then pumped to the main cooker and further heated to 14 0oC +/- 5C to achieve a solids content of approximately 96% solids. A vacuum of 0.8 +/- 0.1 of a bar is then applied to achieve a mass having a solids content of approximately 98%. The hot mass is discharged continuously into a mixing chamber. Flavour and the active granule are dosed into the cooked mass at a rate to meet the finished product composition, given the flow rate of the cooked mass. The mixed mass is continuously discharged from the mixing chamber, passed down a tempering belt, cooled and collected in the batch former. The mass is drawn into a rope and passed through a drop former. Lozenge weight checks are made at regular intervals. The lozenges pass through a cooling conveyor which operates within the temperature range of 12 - 25C before being collected into storage containers.<br>
Syrup manufacture<br>
In a suitable stainless steel manufacturing vessel the hydroxyethylcellulose is dispersed in 2300 litres of liquid sucrose.<br>
The mixture is then homogenised until smooth and lump free. The remaining 700 litres of liquid sucrose is then added to the bulk along with 500 litres of purified water and mixed until homogenous. The mixture is then left to<br><br>
stand for 2 hours to allow the hydroxyethylcellulose to hydrate.<br>
In a suitable stainless steel manufacturing vessel the glycerol is warmed to 55-60°C and the active materials added and mixed until dissolved. This is then added to the hydroxyethylcellulose/liquid sucrose bulk mixture with stirring. The glycerin vessel is then rinsed with 100 litres of purified water that is also added to the bulk vessel. The mixture is then stirred until homogenous.<br>
The citric acid, sodium citrate and sodium saccharin are then added directly to the bulk solution and stirred until dissolved. The colouring ingredients are dissolved in 10 litres of purified water in a suitable stainless steel vessel before being added to the bulk solution with mixing. The vessel is rinsed with 10 litres of purified water that is also added to the bulk mixture with stirring.<br>
The levomenthol, domiphen bromide and flavours are mixed in 8 0 litres of ethanol 96% in a suitable stainless steel vessel. The solution is added, with stirring to the bulk mixture that has been pre-cooled to below 32°C. The flavouring manufacturing vessel is then rinsed with 20 litres of ethanol 96% that is then also added to the bulk mixture with stirring.<br>
Final bulk production<br>
The bulk mixture is made up to final volume with purified water  and  stirred  for  3 0    minutes    to    ensure<br><br>
homogeneity. An in-process viscosity check is performed at this point.<br>
Examples of tablet formulations which may be used in the invention are as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

(c) Actimetry - AW4 actimeters (Cambridge Neurotechnology) were worn continuously throughout the study. A button was pressed at night when the subj ect desired to go to sleep and again in the morning upon waking. The results of the actimeter study were analysed in the manner defined by Home et al (Sleep, 17(2); 146-159).<br>
SDI% was calculated as follows:-<br>
SDI =   Number of 3 0 second epochs with movement      x 100 Number of 30 second epochs from total time spent in bed<br><br>
This is the measure of:<br>
1.	The length of time it took to fall asleep<br>
2.	Any awakenings throughout the sleep period Expressed as a % of total time spent in bed.<br>
Study Objectives<br>
•	To evaluate the effects of two doses of triprolidine<br>
compared with placebo.<br>
Study Design<br>
A  multiple-dose,   placebo-controlled,   parallel-group, double-blind, randomised study investigating the effects of 2.5mg and 5mg triprolidine in patients with temporary sleep disturbance.<br>
Male and Female candidates aged 18 years and above were recruited to one of five research centres by means of local advertising. Candidates were screened by means of a telephone questionnaire and selected candidates invited for interview at the research centre. .Key inclusion criteria used to select candidates for the study were:<br>
•	A record of poor sleep at least 2 nights per week<br>
•	A record of poor sleep for at least 1 week but not more than 3 months<br>
•	Sleep disturbance not caused by underlying disease<br>
•	No excess use of alcohol or drugs<br>
•	Sleep disturbance affected daytime functioning<br><br>
The candidates came to the research centre on Thursday or Friday and were fitted with a wrist actimeter (AW4 from Cambridge Technology) to establish a baseline measure for SDI and were provided with diary cards to record subjective assessments for the Loughborough Sleep Log and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. They returned to the investigational site on the Monday and were issued with the study compositions (2.5mg triprolidine, 5mg triprolidine or placebo). The investigator telephoned a central randomisation centre where the subject was randomised to a particular treatment group using a dynamic balanced randomisation algorithm. The subject was given three doses of their allocated study medication and instructed to take a single dose of two tablets 20 minutes before they intended to go to sleep on three consecutive evenings, commencing that evening. The diary cards for the Loughborough Sleep Log and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale were asked to be completed on waking.<br>
The candidates returned to the research centre on the following Friday.<br>
Parameters Evaluated<br>
Candidates were required to complete a questionnaire 15 minutes after awaking on the feeling of refreshedness assessed on a 5-point scale, the Loughborough sleep log.<br>
A daytime sleepiness assessment was also made 2 0 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours after awaking on the Karolinska 9-point scale, i.e. the sleepiness scale.<br><br>
Results<br>
198 candidates completed the study, of whom 178 provided valuable data. (61 placebo, 60 on 2.5mg triprolidine and 57 on 5mg triprolidine. The subjects on 2. 5mg dose took one tablet and placebo those on 5mg dose took 2x2. 5mg tablets. The subjects on placebo took a dose to match the active treatments (2 tablets).<br>
Key  results were as follows:<br>
•	There was evidence that there was a lack of daytime sleepiness associated with those patients who took either dose of triprolidine<br>
•	The SDI was reduced for both treatments as compared with placebo on every treatment night<br>
•	The sleep latency onset was reduced for both treatments as compared with placebo on every treatment night<br>
The following results were obtained for patients taking 2.5mg triprolidine.  For the mean of the 3 nights:<br>
•	15 minutes after waking, patients taking triprolidine recorded feeling more refreshed than those on placebo, as determined by the Loughborough sleep log(p 
•	There were a greater percentage of people on 2. 5mg triprolidine who, on waking were feeling alert, very alert or extremely alert than those on placebo as measured by the Karolinska log.<br>
•	There was a lower percentage of people on 2. 5mg triprolidine who, on waking were feeling sleepy, and needing to make some effort or very sleepy, needing to<br><br>
make a great effort to keep awake than those on placebo as measured by the Karolinska log.<br>
•	There was no evidence of residual hangover effects / morning grogginess from the drug.<br>
•	The SDI  was significantly reduced compared to those on placebo (p
•	The sleep latency onset was reduced as compared to those on placebo (p
Further analyses show the advantageous effects of triprolidine in relation to the degree of refreshedness on waking.<br>
The study design used 3 groups. On average, the number of individuals in each of the 3 groups (placebo, 2. 5mg triprolidine and 5mg triprolidine) was 60 ± 10 patients.<br>
In the trial, patients were tested during a seven day period and the results have been analysed for a mean of three days in the middle of this period. The effects of triprolidine at dose level 2.5mg and 5.Omg are compared with placebo in table 1.<br><br>

Statistical Analysis<br>
Generally the treatment groups were well balanced in terms of the demographic data. Unless otherwise mentioned all group data was analysed using ANOVA. In two cases, namely, how the patient felt 15 minutes after awakening in the Loughborough Sleep Log and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale at 20 minutes, the two variables were analysed using ANCOVA by including the weekend and the mean of Friday/Saturday/Sunday night as a covariate. The method was a closed test procedure (Williams' test). Each of the tests were to be conducted at the 5% level. The analysis of the secondary endpoints was similarly conducted using the Student's t-tests on parameter estimates taken from the analysis of variance model presented above.<br>
The following is a copy of the "Loughborough sleep log questionnaire" which was used by patients in the study and provided the data for datasets a and b in table 1.<br>
