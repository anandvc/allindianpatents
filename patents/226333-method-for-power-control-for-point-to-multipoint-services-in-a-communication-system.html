Because transmission on the forward link channels from neighboring sectors presents interference to the transmission from the sector serving the subscriber station, it is desirable to control the forward link channel transmission power to the minimum acceptable power. Additionally, a transmission form each . member subscriber station on a reverse link channel presents interference to other subscriber stations. Therefore, it is desirable to control the reverse link channel transmission to the minimum signal level. Consequently, a method and apparatus for a per. control that enables point-to-multipoint services in an existing infrastructure of a wireless cellular telephone system is disclosed.</td>

POWER CONTROL FOR P03NT-T0-MULTJP0INT SERVICES PROVIDED IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
This application claims priority from co-pending Provisional Application No. 60/279,970, filed March 28. 2001, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS F-OR GROUP CALLS USING DEDICATED AND COMMON CHANNELS IN<br>
WIRELESS NETWORKS;<br>
Field<br>
[ifK'll The present invention reiatesito point-to-mijltipo'nt ser\'iceS; in a wireline or a v^ireless commurtcaticn system. More spftcificaily, the present invention relates to a n:etftod and an appa-atus for a power c(;niro! in sjch a point-to-multipoint ser/ices comnruinications system.<br>
Background<br>
[1902] Comrnunicatfon systems hitve lK&gt;€n developed to a!!ow trcnsm'ssion of infomration signals from an origination station to a physically disiinct destination statioii. In transmitting information signa! from tre origination station over a comrrunicaticn cnanne!, die infomration signa! is first convorted into a fonm £i;itaa(e for eff:ci6nt transmission o\/er the communication channel Conversion, or modulatior, of the information signal involves vrifyirg a pararrsler of a carrier wave in accordance with the infcmafion sigr»ai in suc.*^^ a way thai the spectrum of tfte resulting moduiated carrier is cofrfined within the comTiur^cation channei bandv/foth. At (he destination station Lho original informatJon signa? is repiicatsd from :he mo^Julated carrier wave received over the communication channel. Such a replication is generally achieved t?y using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the ordination station.<br><br>
711J031 Modulation also facilitates multiple-access, i.e.. simultaneous trar^smission and/or reception, of several signals over -d common corrmunicarion channel. Multiplt^-accebs communication systems often include a plurai;^/ of remote subscriber terminals requiring intermittent san/ice ot relaively short duration rather than continuous access to the common corrmunication channel. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such es time division multiple-access (TD^M), frequency division multiple-accHSS (FDMA), and amplitude modulation m.ultlplo-access (AM). Another type of a mul:iple-access technique b a code division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spe<: system that conforms to the tia mobile station-ba station compatibility standard for dual-mode wide-band spread speidtrum cellular hereinafter referred as is-95 standard. us of coma techniques in a multiple-access communication is disclosed u.s. patent no. entitled spectrum using satellite or terrestrial repeaters and method generating waveforms cdma telephone both assigned assignee present inv></:>

[l(it):3] In a multiple-access comnvjnicatiof: system, connmjnications betv;een users are 'Xinducted through ono or more base -•stcitons. A first ussr on one subscriber sitatlon ccnmunfcate*:; to a sewnd user en a second subscriber station by trncJ subsc:ribet' atatii^n. Likewise, the communication can be conducied between a firr.t user on a mobile sjbscrlber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the user on a reverse lir.k, and routes tlie data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user.<br>
[1G061	In a wireless communication system, maximizing a capacity of the<br>
corrununiccition system in tenns of the number of simultaneous telephone calls that »:an be 'landled is extremely important. The capacity in a upread spectrum conrinunicst-nn system can be nayinvz^ if the transmissior. power of each suD5::nber station is controted sach that each iransmirted signal arrives at a bass statlo-n nsceiver at the same s.'gnal level. However, if a sig^ia! transmitted by a subscriber staton anlves at the base station rocor^er a: a po^^er level that is tco tew. qjaifty communications canno: be achieved dua to interferance from the er siJjscriber statioris. Or the other hand, if the £'Ub3cra5er station transmitted signal rs at a paw%r fevel that is too nigli wtien recsived at the fcase staticin, communication with this particular subscriber station is acceptable t)ut this high p<y.ver signal acts es inte to other r3ubscrii>er stations. This intedorenco may adx'e.-seiy affect com.^unicatior^s with other subscnTror stations. Therefore, eadi subscriber station ne^ds to transrnil the minimum signa! level expressed as e.g., a signa!-to-nois£ ratio, that allows transmitted data recover^/,<br>
llO)']	Conse'qiuenthy, the transmission power of each subscriber station<br>
within the coverage area of a base s^ticn is coniroilsd by the base station to produce the same norilnal recer/ed sJgnai power at the base station. In an ideal case, the total signal power raceived at the bai50 station Is equal to the nomhal pc^er received from each sufaschber station multiplied by the numt&gt;er<br><br>
of siitscribOf' ilations transmitting within the coverage area of the base station p^(us tie power received at the fcasa station from subscriber i^taiior.3 'n the coverage area of neighboring base stations.<br>
[.'lOCiftj	The   rece^vcti  povver is  dets^rrrrined  by  an  BiiBn-jatkyn of  the<br>
transmitted power by a patn loss cl the link. The patn \o$s can be characterizod ty t\so separate phenomena; average pafh lo^s and fading, (n many communicaticn systerns. e.g.» IS-95., W-CDMA, (S-2GG0, tt\e forv^ard iink and tie r€^v0rse link are allocated separate frequenaiess i.B., the toward link operaes on a diffsrent frequency than the reverse link, However, because YhB forward iink a:id re^ot^e iink frequorv^ies are within the same genera! frequency band, a significant correJation betv^efm Mie average path losses of the two links existfj. On the other hand, fading \s an independent phenomenon for the fonvaid link and reverse link and v?iries as a iunctlon of time.<br>
I IOC 91	In an exentplary CDA4A sjystem, eadi subscriber station estimates the<br>
path loss oj the fonfl^ard link based on the toial power at the input to the sut&gt;sc1ber station. TC\B total pov/er is the sun of tne pcwer from ^)! base stations operating on the same frequency as^ignrnen! as {)erceivQr} by the 3ut&gt;sc iber station. From the estimate of the averace forj^acti link path loss, the subsciber s^ticn sets the transmit teve! of the reverse !(nk signai. Shouid the reverse Jink channel for one subscriber station Siidden^/ improve co(;^pared to the forward Rnk channel for the same subscriber station due to incfependent fading of the hvo cfianneis^ \i\B signai as received at the base station from this subsciber statk^n would increase in power. T^ls increase in pov^r^r causes additonar interfer-ioce to aJJ signals sharing the same frequency assignmenr. Thus a rapkJ respor^e of a^*e subscriber station rrsnsm;: powor to the sadden improvement in the channel would Improve s/sreni peicrmanco. Therefore, it is recessary to have trie base station continually ccntnbut-a to ttie pov^or contro! mechanism of the subscriber station,<br>
il31&amp;J	Thus, the subscnber station's fmnsmit fiovver is contrc^led by ot\€f or<br>
more cjase s^tafions. Each base station, v4tft which the subscriber st;.«5on is in comrnunicaiioa, measures ttie received signa! strength from tlie subscriber station. The jx^easured s^nai strength is compared to a desired s^naJ strength level lor ti^at partfcular sut«crib6r station. A power adjustment command ts gene^ited by each base station and sent to the subscriber station on the<br><br>
forwaird lin<. in response to the base station povm adjustn command subscriber ritation incrsases or de-creases transmit power by a predete-mined an this method r change channe is effected and average system performance improved. note that typical cellular tic stations are not intimately connected oach baua unaware of level at which other receive sigr></.>
IIOU]	When a subscriber station is in communication with more than one<br>
base station, power adjustment commands are provided from each base static n. The subscriber station acts upon thei?e multiple base sJation power adjustment commands to avoid transmit power levels that may adversely interfare witii other subscriber station communications, arid yet provide sufficient power to support communication from the subscriber station to at least one of the base stations. This power control mechanism is accomplished by havirg the subscriber station incrt&gt;ase its transmit signal level only if overy base staticn, witi which the subscribar station is in communicaticn, requests an increase in powar level. Tne subscriber station decreases the subscriber station's transmit signal level If any base statior, with v/hich the subscriber station is in ODmrnunication, requests that the power l:e decreaseci, A system for biiae station and subscriber station powar control is dtsclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5.056.109 entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING TRANSMISSION POWER IN A CDMA CELLULAR MOBILE TELEPHONE SYS**EM," issued Oct. 8. 1991. assigned to the assignee of the present invertion.<br>
[:,0121	in adcfition to the abC'vedesorlbed reverse Ifnk power contro!, it is also<br>
desirable to control the relative pov/er used in e^ch traffic channsi transmitted on a fowaid link by the base station. To enable such a control, each remote ataficn measures the power of traffic channels t^cebred form a base station, gene-ates control information in response^ and trartsmits the control information back to the base station. The primary reason for providing such controi is to accommodate Ihe fact that in certain locations the fonA/ard link may be unusually disadvantaged. Unless the power being, transmitted to the disadvantaged subst:riber station is Increased, the signal quality may become unacceptable. An e;&gt;campl8 of such a location is a point where the patti loss to one or two<br><br>
n<eighbor base stations is nearly the same as path loss to active></eighbor>
slation, i.e., a base station communicating with the subsctibor station. In such a<br>
lcc:ation, the total interforeoce would be increased three times over the<br>
interference seen by a subscriber station at a point relatively cioss to the active<br>
base stailon. In addition, the interference coming from the neighboring base<br>
stations vices not fade in unison with the signal from the active base station as<br>
wC'Uld be the case for interference coming from the active base station, A<br>
siJDscrifaer station in such a situation may require 3 to 4 dB additional signa!<br>
p(3WQr from the aclivo base station to achieve adequate performance. At other<br>
times, th^ subscriber station nay be located where the slgnal-to-interferance<br>
ralio is unusually good. In stct*. a case, the base station ccuM transmit the<br>
desired signal using a lower than nomnal transmitter power, reducing<br>
jntarference to other signals being transmitted by the system.<br>
[1013]	The above described wireless communication sen/ice is an example<br>
of a pOTit-to^inf communicaricn service. In contrast a potnl-to-muftipo;nt se'vicG Is a service where the information transmitted by a source of th?? inf Drmaton is intendeo for a piura ir/ cf mobile slalions. Ths basic model of £ point-to-mullipoint system ccmixises a sst of users, a group of which is sar.ccj by one o^ more sources cf 'Ofo rna^ion, which provide information with a certain contents, e.g., news, movies, sports events and the like, to be transmitted ro the usBTs. Each usefs subscriber station partcip^ation ?n the point-to-muttipoini se-vice (a member subscriber station) rncr^itors a forward link shared channel Because the source of infcrnation fixedly d8ti&gt;miin54S the content, tfie users are generalry not communicating ba;k. Examples of common usage of such a point-to-muttipDint services communication systems are TV broadcast, radio broadcast, and ttie !iKe. Alternaiively. the source of Information h a user - a mc»mber of the group, which transmits intormadon intended for the remaining mcsmbers of the selected group if the user wishes to talk, he presses a push to taU (PTM button. Typically, the talking user's voice is routad from the su!3scriber station to a transceiver station on a dedicated reverse link. The transceiver station then transmits the talking user's voice over the forward link sh.ared channel. As in case of the polnt-to-pcint communkiation system, such a communbatlcn system allows both landiine and wiieless subscriber station to aoi^ess the system. Such a point-to-multipoini service is also refen-ed to as e<br><br>
group servic3. Examples of the g'oup sorvice communication system use is in cJispaicn se:"'/ices, such as locai police radio systems, tiaxicab dispatch systems, f-edetai Buts^c of intelliyence c.nd secret service operations, ami genc-ra! rnilitajy coaimunication .systems.<br>
[IQlA]	Ire   alwve-nGntioneo   point-io-rnultipoint   service   coiTimufMcaSion<br>

For tutoriai purposes, the following doscription illustrates a group call: however, one of ordinary skills in the art urderstcnds f^^ow to apply the disclosed concepts to other pcint-to-rnultipoint S£?ivices. A (calling) group is defined by the group's membership, comprising us'^fs of S'jbscrib&amp;r stations talking to one another frequently enough to . esablish tne calling group. The calling group is said to be in a sleep state when no memt^er is either idle or active, e.g., ail nr^embers are either powered off or do not paiticipate in the calling group. The calling group is in the idle state when at least one merr^ber participates in the group. The calling group Is in the aciive state when one of at least two members initiates a group call. A group cail is divided into active and silent periods. The group call io in the active peicd vv;&gt;3n t.iere are transmissions between the rr(em*jers without long idle peiods.

[lft44J When a memDer subscriDer slatiort. e.g.. the subscribe'^ station 102(1), dtijires to transmit user data to tfie group aver the revfc^rso link, the member subscriber station needs to request a reverse link assignment and request to transmit. In one emoodiment. the subscriber station 102(1), sends an access channel n'V^ssage requesting a reverse link to base station, e.g., base station 104(1). The access message is sent on an access channel. The access chcinnel is a reverse Jink channel used by sutccriber stations for communicating to ihe base station. The access channel is used for short signaling message . exchanges such as call originations, responses to pages» and registration. An access attenopt is sent by the subscriber station m a series of access probes. Each access probe cam'es the same Infomnation but is transmitted at a hfgher pcv^er leve' than the previous one. The access probes continue until a base staJon acknowledgment Is recer/ed at the subscriber station. However, one skilled in the art recognizes that other access arrangements as described in a provisicnel application serial number 60/279,970, entitled "MSTHOD AND AP=&gt;ARATUS FOR GROUP CALLS USING DEDICATED AND COMMON CHANNEi^ »N WIRELESS NETWORKS.' filed March 28. 2001. assigned to the assigree of the present invention are equally applicable.<br>

Note that if subscriber stations 102(2), 102(3), and 102(4) are completely passive, the inc'ividual base stations may be unaware of whether ttue sut&gt;scriber stations are in their corresponding coveraae areas.  Even If a subscriber station registers<br><br>

Consequently, where the term base station is used herein, it is implied Ihat iim term msy refer to an enti'^o base station or to a single sector of a nulti-sectored base station. Furthermore, although in tne descriptfon above, the comrron infonTiauon was proviaed by the subscriber station 102(1). one cf ordincjy skJs in the art dnders:and3 ihat tt^e concepts disclosed are equally appli^zable for \he common information toeing providi^ by a source connected to the ccmmunication system 100 via the interface unit 110.<br>

Together the plurality of base stations provides coverage to an entire service area. However, if the foryvard link shared channel is trar:smltted from every base station in the system at ai! times, the cost of the system cari be quite righ.

|ll!51] As thQ description of the poinHo-muitipoini communication system indicates, to maximize capacity, tne pov;er control of the forward link broadcast charno! is required. Furthermore, a pov/er control of any dedicated far.vard link or reverse lir'.k channels is required.<br>
Reverse Link Power Control<br>
\liS2\	Reverse link power control is the methaj of controlling power of<br>
channels comprising the reverse link. In reverse link }^}OviBt control, the base station measures the quality merric of the signal received from the subscriber station transmitting on a reverse link channel, coiTipares the measured quality metre against a threshold (a set point) and requests that the active subscriber station increases or decreases transmitted power level in accordance with a result of the comparison. The term active subscriber station (talker) is used herein to mean a subscriber station transmitting user data on a reverse traffic charnel. As discussed above, in a group call, only one or few subscriber stations beicnging to a group transmit user data on a reverse link at one time. Ccn{»equent!y, no member passive subscriber station (lister-er) has an estalJlished reverse link traffic rtiannei lo any of the base stations. T?ie terni passive is used herein to mean a subscriber station monitoring a fonward link sharsd channel and any additional fon&amp;ard link channel if ii\e addWonal towara link channel is transmitted, arKi not transmitting einy user data on the reverse link. Of coui-se, the passive subsanber stations may transrviit non-user data: i.e., control and feedback data on an appropriate channel of the reverse link. The additioral forward link channel may comprise a dedicated channel over whici the subscnber station receives e.g., signaling infonmation, power control infortiation, overhead information and ether types of infonmation known to one skiile-d in th'r art. The assignrr^ient of channels for tne forward link shared charnel ard the optional additicnai fcn^/ard link chcinnel(s) is communication syst€fm dependent Thus, for example, in a commurication system in accordance with the IS-200C standard, examples of forward channel assignments are listed In Table 1.<br><br><br><br>

F:&gt;rwarcl Link Power Control<br>
[vysT]	Fonward link power ccntrol is the method of controliing pov^er of the<br>
channels comprising the forv/ard link. In a fcrv/ard link shared channel, each group call member subscriber station measures a quality metric of the received common for//ard link traffic channel and transmits a feedback informaticn to the<br><br>
sector(s) tranamidng the common forward link traffic channel for ths member subscriber station. In one embodiment^ the qusiity metric comprises a signal-to-roise ratio expressed in terms of energy per bit over interference (Eb/Nt). Hcwever, one of ordinary skills in t^e art understands tiat other quality metrics, e.g., t^it-erro^rate. trame-error-rate, and other quality metrics kr^own in the art may be usoa. The feedback is transmitted on a reverse (ink established tetA'oen the member subscriber station and the sector. Each sector receives the fesdback from thos3 member subscriber staticns in the sector's coverage area that transmit on reverse link and adjusts ths transmit leve! to ensure that the dcjsired quality of service (QoS) is delivered to all the member subscriber statioris.

[10581	As discussed above, the forward link condition for each subscriber<br>

[1059;	In the ebove-described emlx&gt;diment, a!! member subscriber stations<br>
report the quality metrfc upon updating the qualit/ metric measurement. To cecrease the reverse link ^gnaling k^ad and increase battery life of a subscriber station, In anc«ther embodiment, tne subscribe*' stations report the measured cualii)' metric back to the base staion only if the measured queJIty metric \s not salistcictory. Thus, each noember subscriber station measures the quality metric and c«Dmpares ttie measured qualit/ metric to a thresnold. If the quality metric is better than tlie threshold, ttie subscriber station abstains from reporfing &amp;ie quality' nrTetic. Consequently, only the subscriber stations wftn a measured quality' metric below the threshold report the quality metric. The base station then s.djusls the common forward link traffk: channel power to satisfy the power requirement of the subscriber station, which reports the worst fonward link qualit)^ metric.<br><br>
[1060]	When the subscriber station detem-.ines the forward link channel<br>
quality metric, the subscriber station needs lo feed back the fonA/ard link channel quEiiity metric to the base station on a reverse link. As discussed above, only active subscriber slaton(s) transmit a reverse (Ink traffic channel, whi<. may be used for the feedback. consequently passive subscriber stat ons do not have an established reverse traffic channel to any of bas3 stabons. however remote staiions need use a revcirse link communicate wilh base stations information necessary call maiitenar.c9. e.g. handoff me:5sages. power control and other known one ordinary skills in art. furthermore desire lo therefore requesting assignment.></.>
[1061]	The  different exemplary embodiments  of  reverse link channel<br>

Furthermore, one of ordinary sk lis in the art wil! be able to adapt the ideas of the invention disclosed In the presented emoodiments to communication systems ir accordance with other standards.<br>
IlutJ2j	In accordance with one cnfUx)di.ment. eacf^ passive subscn*ber statkxi<br>
is assigned a reverse fink dedicated channel, e.g.. Dedk;ated Control Channel (R-DCCH), upoa joining an actjva group. (E.g., Grojp I, Group III of Table 1). The substTiber statk)n uses the R-DCCH for signaling both for regular calls, (e.g., report ng of forward link pilots) and signaling related to the group call (e.g., quaity metric reporting of forward link broadcast channel, request for a reverse fink traffic channel assignment.) When transmitting the R-DCCH, the member subijcriber station also transmits a Reverse Pilot Channel (R-PCH) and a Reverse Power Control Sub-channel (R-PCSCH). The R-FCSCH carries feec back on a quality metric of the com.mon broadcas: forward link channel.<br>
[Vo63]	in one en^odiment, the data rate on the foavard link shared channel<br>
is fKed; ;he sector uses full rate (800 bps in accordance with the IS-2000 stardard and 1600 bps in accxjrjance witfi W_CDMA standard) fon^/ard power control. Tlie forward link 200 for a fixed rate as Illustrated in FIG* 2 is defined in tenris of f-ames 202. A frame is a structure comprising a determined time span.  Because the data rate Is fixed, each frama 202 « franom.H^w ../.♦K tu^<br><br>
same pcv/er pf. Thorafore, tne current power control method is able to moasura<br>
the quali^/ metric of the Forward Link Shared Channel. A Forv^ard Link Shared<br>
darnel quality metric nay comprise, e.g., a signal lo interferenca and noiso<br>
ratio (SINK) expressed, for example, as energy per bit over f;oi^.5e (6b/Nt). A<br>
required target decvx'er metric performance of the member subscriber stat/on<br>
cotermines a Forward Link Shared Channel quality motrlo required tor that<br>
stbscritior station. Such a decoder metric may be e.g.. a decoded frame error<br>
rate (FER), bit error rata (BER). and/'or other decoder metric known to one<br>
sKHIed in cne art. The memb^ir subscrit'er station measures the FoTward Link<br>
Shared Channel quaiity metric, <x the quality metric against a fixed or></x>
adaptive threshold, and sends power control comrr^ands in accordance with tJie<br>
cC'mpariRon results, in one embodiment, the power control commands 204<br>
ccmprisG a stream of up or dcv/n commands (similar to FPC^MODE - '000' in<br>
accordance v/ith IS-2000 standard). The quality metric measurement and<br>
ccmpariscn can be carried out reliably by the subscriber station because, as<br>
di'jcussec. th^ data rates or the Forward Link Shared Channel are fixed,<br>
tf&gt;3reforE', do not change without notice to the member subscriber station. In ar^<br>
exemplary embodiment of an adaptr/e threshold adjustment, tne threshold is<br>
int:reasod by a first step, e.g., 0.5 dB, when a data frame of the Fonrtirard Link<br>
Sftared Channel is received ccrrectly. This threshold is decreased by a smaller<br>
stijp, e.g., 0.5 dBf'(1 /FERdosjricI), when data frame on the Fonward Link Shared<br>
Ctiannei is received incorrectly. The FtRdGstrej represents tne desired frame<br>

[10643	!n another emtXKJimerit, utilizing the Forv^ard Link Shared Channel<br>
ard the indivdjally assigned dedicated fon/vard traffic channels, the quality' m«5tric of the Fonward Link Shared Channel can be determined form the highest quality metric of the indsvidua^Iy assigned dedicated forward traffic channel used by the rnt^mber subscriber s:ation. Because the rates transmitied on tne Fcnvard Link Shared Chanr»el and the individually assigned dedicated forward traffic chai inels are different, a proper rate translation between *iie Fon^^ard Link Si'ared C^Jann9l and the individually assigned dedicated lory^ard traffic channels must be made. The FcnA^ard Link Shared Channel quality metric is determined by scaling the qua'iti* metric of the individually assigried dedicated forward traffic channel in acconjance with the raie translation-<br><br>
[lOfiS]	The sector receives the power controi commands transmitted on the<br>
reverse link defeated channel and, In accordaiiCe with one Gmbodiment, decreases a oower transmit level of the Fon^'afd Link Shared Channel by an amouU Q')hf 0.5 dB. when the f*3edback from ali mtimher subscriber station requests docroasa of pov/er. The sector increases the power transmit level by the same aniount when at least ona member subscriber station requests increase of power.<br>
[10(;6]	In another embodiment, the feedback is in a form of messatjes on R-<br>
DCCH.<br>
[I0o71	In another enbodimenl. the sectors use a split feedback on the<br>
FonA/c.rd Link Shared Channel and tne indi'jidually assigned dedicated foavard traffic channels ff the dedicated forward traffic channels are assigned. Tne split feedback divides the reverse link streaiH pov^^er control commands into t&gt;m sub-streans. As discussed, the powor control stream in accordance with the IS-2000 ^ompris^s e stream of 800 bps. Thus, the first sub-stream can comprise, B.g., |X)iver control commands sane at 400 bps, the second scb-stream then compises. pcwer control comman js send at ^oo bps The sub-streams may be formed, e.g., oy assigning the odd-numbered feedback bits to the first sub-strean and tba even-numbered feedback bits to the second suc-sfream. The first sub-stream »:arries the pcrser control commands for the Forward Link Sharad Channe?, the second sub-stream carries the power control commands for INJ dedicated forward traffic channels. In accordance with this nr^thod, the feedback straam pov/er controi commands for the Forward Link Shared Charifiel frcfr each member subscriber siation in the same sector can be \n the fomi of a sequ6rK:e of up and down commands {similar to FPC^MODE = '001' cr '010' in accordance to IS-2000 standard) or a stream of Erasure Indicator Bits (EIB) (similar to FPC_K-ODE = *n0' in accordance to 13-2000 sta.nda-d). From this s«t of fo&amp;:back for the Foi-vvard Link Shared Channei, tn« sector can set the transnil fevei for that Forward Link Shared Channel to meet the quality rcquirament and conserve power consumption. The E!B feedback aiso gives the b«iS8 station a fast feedback on the member subsc riber station reception of the Fonrt^ard Link Shared Chanr^L This specific feedback facilitates the physxral layer to start the re-transmisslon earlier fnan the NAK (negative acknowledge) from higher layers, If such re-transmission is desired and<br><br>
feasible. The feedback on the dodicaiod chann^-ls is processed in accordance mh any itiothod applicable to point-to-point power control method.<br>
i 1068]	The sector receives the po^^e' control bits and, ir\ accordance with<br>
one ernbccliment, increases a pov^/er transmil levui of t^je broadcast tcward traffic channel by a first amount, e.g., O.o dB, when the feedback fronr. at least one menibsr subsciber staticn reqi^ests increase of po*»ver cr indicates an Gi'iisure. The sectoi' decreases the power transmi-: level by a second annount when each nnember subscriber station requests decrease of pow-^r or indicates no erasure.<br>
[iDd^J	In another embodimert, the data rate on the forward link shared<br>
channel is transmitted with a. variable data rate, as illustrated in FIG, 3. Because the data rate is variable, each frame 3C0 is transmitted witt) a power P coTespondIng to the data rate transmitted In that frame. Thus, e.g., frame 300(n) a full-rate franr&gt;o, Is transmitted with a power PQ. a half-rate frame 300(1) is transmitted with a power Pf2, and an eighth-rate franne 300(2) is transmitted with a power P^. To enable the subscriber slalioo power control to correctly esimate tie foiward link shared charuel qua^i^y metric, the feedback power coitrol commands for reverse link power control utiiize a sub-chani^l. e.g.. a for//ard power control sub-channel (F-PCSCH), which is punctured at a predetermined rate, e,g., 800 (bps) onto the common foward link traffic channel with a constant po-tver In an altemaih-e embodiment, the power centre! infonmatiori is not punctured into the common forward link traffic chiinnel as a F-PCSCH, but the pov/er control information is transmitted as a sut-stream of a Foward Common Power Control Channel (F-CPCCH). i.e., the power contrcl &gt;nft)rmation is inserted into a pre-defrned position into the cominon forward iink common power control channei.

11075]	Consequently, in accordance to one embodiment, instead of providing<br>
a pov/er ccnirol feedback in a form of continuous stream of power commands, the power control feedback is prcx'ided in a form of messages modulated on the R-ACH. R-EACH, or the R-CCCH. This alternative is attractive in that the memljer subscriber stations does not continually update the quality metrics of a forward link shared channel, but send a feedback message only when the updaled quality metrics falls below a certain threshold. In one embodiment, the message is sent when a frame error rata (FER) averaged over the most recent 50 tr^tmes is 4% or higher. However, one of ordinary skills in the art recognizes that, n an aheroative embodiment, the message may be generated every time the quality metrics Is updated Within the message, several fjeids or quality irdiccitions nriay be irx:luded. For example, there may be a field indicaling the 3lren!jth at rvhkdi the subscriber station perceives the piici signal from the base staft'on. Alten^tively, there may oe a field indicaiing the straftgth or quality at •Ahicl- the suijscriber station perceives the forwara linK broadcast channe?. There may fcs a ffeW indfcating the signal strength or quality of both ihe pilot i^annel and the fofwaid link broaocast channel. There may be a field which indfccites tho difference between or the ratio of the p lot signal strength to the fonrt^ard link fcroa*Jcast channel strength; the qua«r/ of the group cai{ charuiels. thedes.red increase in received signal to noise and interference ratio, and ether related informaticn known to one skilled in the art.<br>

XX/&gt;XX,XXX. entitled ^^METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGEMENT FOR POIMTTCMvlULTIPOINT SERVICES IN' A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM;* filed March 28, 2002, the forward link shared cMarine! is modulated by traffic infor'nation, signaling messages necessary to maintain the call, (e.g.. a pilot strer^gth measurement message, liandoff direction message, handcff completion message^ and ether messages known lo one of ordinary skills in the art), and messages related to the group-caii, (e.g., a start and an end of a cai!, requ2st ani grant of a right to transmit, and other messages known to one of ordiran/ slaJIs in the art.) Because the F-SCH(s) Is a common channel, proper subscriber station addressing jnfomiatlon must be employed, so that the subscriber station can discern commor&gt; information Irom information directed to the 5;ubscMi39r station. Because the signaiing mcfSSciges and the overhead of subscriber s^taticn addressing negatively ateci:j the traffic capacity, altemativsiy, the tonvard link shared channel is modulated only by the traffic infOHTiation and the signaling messciges are carried or an adaiticnal forward link chainel. The addftionaJ forward ink channet is a dedicated channel assigns to each indmdual member subscriber .station.<br>
ilQli]	Because   tt^e   dedkra'ed   fonward   link   channels   are   assigned<br>
indivdually' to each member subi^criber station, the transmit povisr !e/el of the dedicated channels can be cont'oiied by methods applicable to point-to-point connmunicaticn. Thus, the subsonoer station determines quali^/ metric of the dedicated forward ilnk channel, reports it back to a tase station and the base staton adjusts the povj-er level of ihe dedk:ated fon*vard link channel.<br>
f 111751] •	The base staton niay utilize the determined transmit power leve! of<br>
the cledicatad forward link channel to detemiine a transmit povver level of tne forwjird linV. i^iiared channel by proper rata translalicn of infora»r3tion tr<ansmitted on ttie fonrtrard link shared channel and the dedicate fonarard for each memt>er subscriber station. Ihe base station then adjusts the a transmit powt^r level of the forw^ard link shared channel to satisfy the subscriber station wHh the highest power requirement<br><br>
[IflSOl	Because the dQdicated fomard link channel is mcdwiated by sjignaling<br>
and overhead infomialion. there may be insufficient activity on the foward link channel to assure sufficient accuracy of cJetemninatlDn of transmit, powar level cf the dedicated fon,vard link channel via the rate iranslation. Constjcjusntly, the base staiicn monitors tf)e activity DO bofh the forward link shared channel and the dedicated foward lifik chaniiel, and sends 'keep-alive' frames on the dedicated f :rA'ard link channel to ensure sufficient activity for accuracy of the rate rjanslation,<br>
