COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SECTION 10; rale 13)<br>
"A melting machine for plastic waste."<br>
RAMDAS MANSING MANE<br>
EL 39/6, Electronic Zone,<br>
M.I.D.C. Bhosari,<br>
Pune 411 026 Maharashtra State, India<br>
A subject of the Republic of India<br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Dated this 28th day of January, 2002<br><br>
(RAMDAS MANSING MANE)<br><br>
Present invention relates to 'a melting machine for plastic waste'. The used polystyrene material as well as used plastic materials are waste. As being non-decomposable materials these waste materials create environmental hazards. By using this machine the waste is recycled and this recycled material can be used as a raw material for making new products.<br>
The invention will now be described with the help of a drawing accompanying this specification wherein the salient features have been shown with suitable numerals and referred to appropriately in the following description.<br>
Fig. (a) shows a melting machine for plastic waste.<br>
The various parts of a melting machine for plastic waste is described with help of fig (a) and Pig. (b)<br>
It consists of an inlet hopper (1) to insert the expanded polystyrene material, crusher (2) to crash the inserted material, belt pulley with motor of 5 to 7 HP (3) to operate the crusher, blower (4) which consists of a fan to suck crushed material from crasher from one side and deliver on other side, PVC 4" pipe (5), a silo made of MS 2.5 mm of sheet for collecting crashed expanded polystyrene material or plastic material (6), moving, track made up of MS angles for the movement of silo (7), MS screw or material movement, dropped from crasher (8) MS shell for covering screw (9), bottom frame to support shell (10 ), sensors for measuring the inside temperature of the shell(ll), airvent to pass out air present in the shell (12), insulation glass wool (13)to cover the shell, Heater mounted between shell and glass wool (14) to the screw , Gear motor of 5 H.P. (15) for moving the screw, air supplying blower (16), control panel (17)for the overall operation of the machine, which consists of six switches for gear motor movement, smoke blower , air blower, material suction blower, heater switch and crusher switch. Two temperature controller for different temperatures within the shell (18), smoke blower to suck the smoke (19), smoke delivery pipe to pass sucked smoke out (20), smoke suction pipe (21), an outlet for passing out recycled material (22), MS tray for collecting output material (23), outlet lumps (24).<br>
The dimension of the machine is 4.66 m (L) X 4.0 m (W) X 3.0 m (H) and required connected load is 33 KW, 3 Phase, 430 volt<br>
Operation of the machine:<br>
To start a melting machine for plastic wraste, the control panel is switched on. The required load is 33 KW, 3 Phase, and 430 Volt. The control panel switches on the heater upto the temperature 200 degree centigrade (Tl) and temperature 180 degree centigrade (T2) shown by (18). These required temperatures are achieved within 15 minutes and<br><br><br>
are measured by the heat sensor (11). Then the gear motor is switched on which in turn starts the movement of screw. Confirm that the screw is moving properly. During this process, the gases generated inside the shell (9) are sucked through smoke suction pipe (21) with the help of smoke blower (19), and exhausted out by smoke exhaust pipe (20) into atmosphere. Now switch on the crusher (2) and blower (4). Then waste material of expanded polystyrene is inserted through hopper (1). This material is passed through the crusher where it is cut into small pieces by blade. A motor of 5 to 7 HP operates this crasher as shown in fig (3). The crushed material from crusher is sucked by blower (4) and pass through PVC pipe (5) to the silo (6). The another blower (16) sucks the air from atmosphere and uses it to pass the material from silo (6) to screw (8). The material passed on the screw area (8) is heated by the heater (14) mounted on shell as shown in fig. It takes 5 to 7 minutes to melt the material. Then it is moved forward towards outlet (23). See that there is no time lag in the insertion of waste in the hopper once the output starts. The shell is covered by the glass wool (13) to avoid the loss of temperature. During the process air sucked into the shell is exhausted through the airvent (12). The melted EPS is passed out through the outlet (23) and it is collected in MS tray (24). Keep the screw on even after the insertion of the material is over. Keep the heater on even after the recycling process is over. Confirm that there is no material left behind inside on the screw and then stop heating screw by switching off the heater. Then switch off the gear motor to stop the functioning of the screw. Take care that no hard or iron material is inserted in the machine.<br>
This melted EPS lumps is nothing but converted reusable EPS material.<br>
For recycling the used plastic material, the following operation is carried out.<br>
To start the waste EPS melting plastic machine the control panel is switched on. The required load is 33 KW, 3 Phase, 430 Volt. The control panel switches on the heater upto the temperature 250 degree centigrade ( Tl) and temperature 200 degree centigrade (T2) shown by (18). These required temperatures are achieved within 15 minutes and are measured by the heat sensor (11). Then the gear motor is switched on which in turn starts the movement of screw. Confirm that the screw is moving properly. During this process, the gases generated inside the shell (9) are sucked through smoke suction pipe (21) with the help of smoke blower (19), and exhausted out by smoke exhaust pipe (20) into atmosphere. The waste plastic material is inserted into the silo (6) directly. The blower (16) sucks the air from atmosphere and uses it to pass the material from silo (6) to screw (8). The material passed on the screw area (8) is heated by the heater (14) mounted on shell as shown in fig. It takes 7 to 10 minutes to melt the material. Then it is moved forward towards outlet (23). During the process air sucked into the shell is exhausted through the airvent (12). The melted plastic is passed out through the outlet (23) and it is collected in MS tray (24). Keep the screw<br><br><br>
on even after the insertion of the material is over. Keep the heater on even after the recycling process is over. Confirm that there is no material left behind inside on the screw and then stop heating screw by switching off the heater. Then switch off the gear motor to stop the functioning of the screw. Take care that no hard or iron material is inserted in the machine.<br>
This plastic collected in MS tray is nothing but converted reusable plastic material.<br><br>
