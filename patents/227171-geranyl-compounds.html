SPECIFICATION GERANYL COMPOUNDS<br>
Tschnical Field<br>
This invention relates to novel geranyl compounds or mevalonic acid derivatives, and to their utihzation as antitumor agents.<br>
Background Art<br>
Many geranyl compounds having 1,5-diene structure are present in vivo, and are known as in vivo precursors of substances having polyene structure and exhibiting various physiological activities.    These substances having 1,5-diene structure and polyenes derived therefrom invariably start from mevalonic acid and biosynthesized.<br>
I noticed,as such geranyl compounds having l,5-dien6 structure, geranic acid or geranylamine, and furthermore mevalonic acid which is the base for biosynthesis of polyenes, synthesized various derivatives of geranic acid or geranylamine and mevalonic acid and investigated their physiological activities, in particular, antitumor activity and toxicity, and have come to complete the present invention.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
This invention provides geranyl compounds represented by the following formulae (M), (1-2) or (1-3):<br><br><br><br>
R^ stands for a residual group remaining after removing all carboxyl groups present in a carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of malic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, 2-oxoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, p-pyruvoaminobenzoic acid, retinoic acid, tyrosine, cysteine, glutamic acid and serine, and where hydroxyl or amino group(s) are present in the residual group, they may optionally be protected by acyl (e.g., lower alkanoyD or benzyloxycarbonyl group(s),<br>
m is 1, 2 or 3,<br>
n is 0, 1 or 2,<br>
m + n showing the number of carboxyl groups which are<br>
present in said carboxylic acid, and<br>
R^ stands for p-hydroxy phenyl or mercapto group.<br>
The invention also provides mevalonic acid derivatives represented by the following formula (1-4):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Among the compounds of the formula (I-l), those of the formulae (l) and (2) can be prepared by, for example, subjecting geranylamine to an amidation reaction with reactive derivatives (e.g., mixed acid anhydride, active ester, halide or the like) of glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid whose hydroxy! group(s) are protected with acyl group(s) (e.g., acetyl).<br>
Of the compounds of the formula (M), those of the formulae (3) to (5) can be prepared by, for example, subjecting reactive derivatives of geranic acid (e.g., mixed acid anhydride, active ester, halide or the like) to an amidation reaction with galactosamine, glucosamine or fucos amine.<br>
Said amidation reaction can be conducted following the conventional method of amidation reaction in the field of peptide chemistry, normally in an adequate inert organic solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, N,N-dimethylformamide, dichloromethane or the like) or in water, under cooling down to about 0°C or heating up to about 6Q°C, preferably at about 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The use ratio of geranylamine to a reactive derivative of gulcuronic acid or galacturonic acid whose hydroxyl group(s) are protected is not strictly limited, but it is normally preferred to use the geranylamine within a range of 1-2 moles, per mole of the reactive derivative.<br>
The use ratio of galactosamine, glucosamine or fucosamine to a reactive derivative of geranic acid is again not strictly limited, but normally it is preferred to use galactosamine, glucosamine or fucosamine within a range of 1-2 moles, per mole of the reactive derivative.<br><br>
Where hydroxyl-protective groups are present after the amidation reaction, said protective groups are removed by a de-protection reaction such as hydrolysis, to provide geranyl'sugar derivatives of the formula (I-l).<br>
The geranyl-sugar derivatives of the formula (M) produced through above reactions can be isolated from the reaction mixtures and purified by conventional means, for example, extraction, crystallization, chromatography or the like.<br>
The geranylamide derivatives of the above formula (r2) can be produced by, for example, subjecting geranylamine to an amidation reaction with reactive derivatives (e.g., mixed acid anhydride, active ester, halide or the like) of carboxylic acid represented by the formula (U):<br><br>
in which R'^, m and n have the earlier given significations, in which hydroxyl or amino group(s) are protected with acyl (e.g., lower alkanoyl such as acetyU, benzyloxycarbonyl and the Uke groups.<br>
Said amidation reaction can be conducted following the conventional method of amidation reaction in the field of peptide chemistry, normally in an adequate inert organic solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, N,N-dimethylformamide or the hke) under cooling down to about 0°C or heating up to about 60°C, preferably at about 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The use ratio of geranylamine to a reactive derivative of carboxylic acid of the formula (II) is variable depending on the number of geranyl group (m) to be introduced into the carboxylic acid, while it is normally preferred to use it within a range of 1 mole to (m+2) moles per mole of the reactive derivative.<br>
When the hydroxyl- or amino-protective groups are present after the amidation reacetion, they are removed where necessary by a de-protection reaction such as hydrolysis to provide geranyl amide derivatives of the formula (1-2).<br><br>
Those geranylamide derivatives of the formula (1-3) can be prepared by, for example, subjecting reactive derivatives of geranic acid (e.g., mixed acid anhydride, active ester, halide and the Uke) to an amidation reaction with tyrosine or cysteine.<br>
This amidation reaction can aiso be conducted following conventional method of amidation reaction in the field of peptide chemistry, normally in din adequate inert organic solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, N,N-dime thy Iformamide or the like) or in water, under cooling down to about 0°C or heating up to about 60°C, preferably at about 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The use ratio of tyrosine or cysteine to a reactive derivative of geranic acid is not strictly limited, but it is normally preferred to use either of them within a range of i-2 moles per mole of the reactive derivative.<br>
Such geranylamide derivatives of the formula (1-2) or (1-3) produced in the above reactions can be isolated from the reaction mixtures and purified by conventional means, for example, extraction, crystallization, chromatography or the like.<br>
Those mevalonic acid derivatives of the formula (1-4) can be prepared, for example, by reacting sugaramine represented by the following formula"<br><br>
in which R^ has the earlier given signification, or salt thereof with mevalolactone or mevaloyl halide.<br>
Said reaction of a sugaramine of the formula (III) or a salt thereof with mevalolactone or mevaloyl halide (e.g., mevaloyl chloride) can be conducted in water or an adequate inert organic solvent (e.g., N.N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform or<br><br>
the like) at temperatures between room temperature to reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably from about 40° to about 70°C.<br>
The use ratio of mevalolactone or mevaloyl halide to a sugaramine of the formula (III) is not strictly limited, but it is normally preferred to use 1-2 moles of mevalolactone or mevaloyl hahde per mole of the sugaramine of the formula (III).<br>
Where a salt of a sugaramine of the formula (III) or mevaloyl halide is used as the starting material, it is generally desirable to carry out the above reaction with addition of a base, for example, tertiary amine such as N-methylpiperidine; or an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and the Uke.<br>
The mevalonic acid derivatives of the formula (1-4) produced through above reactions can be isolated from the reaction mixtures and purified by conventional means, such as extraction, crystallization, chromatography or the like.<br>
Compounds of the formulae (I-l) through (1-4) offered by the present invention possess excellent antitumore activity, as is clear from the following measuremet results of antitumor effect.<br>
Measurement of antitumor effect<br>
Carcinoma of HuH-7 cells (dendriform cell strain of human hepatoma) hypodermicaily implanted or subimplanted in the backs of 5-weeks old female nude mice (BALB/c, Ninox) was aseptically taken out and crushed into 5x5 mm sized pieces in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS), a piece of which then being hypodermicaily implanted in the backs of the nude mice.<br>
Each test substance was dissolved in corn oil, and the solution was intraperitoneally administered to the nude mice consecutively once per day at a rate of 250 ^ig/mouse for 3 weeks, starting from a week after the implantation.   After termination of the administration, the carcinomas were taken out and weighed to calculate the antitumor effect and the mice' weight loss by the following equations.   For the test six mice per group were used, and the group administered with the solvent (corn oil) alone was made the<br><br><br>
Synthetic evaluation<br>

Examples<br>
Synthesis Example, 1- Synthesis of N-geranylgalacturonamide To a tetrahydrofuran (THF) (20 ml) solution containing 0-tetraacetylgalacturonic acid (3.62 g, 10 mmols), triethylamine (l.Ol g, 10 mmols) was added, and the solution was cooled to 0°C.    Into this solution isobutyl chloroformate (1.37 g, 10 mmols) solution in THF (5 ml) was added dropwise at 0°C, followed by 30 minutes' stirring.    Into the resulting solution a geranylamine (1.53 g, 10 mmols) solution in THF (5 ml) was added dropwise, followed by an hour's stirring at 0°C and further 4 hours' stirring at room temperature.   After termination of the reaction, 150 ml of chloroform was added, and the chloroform layer was washed three times each with 50 ml of water.   The chloroform layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, the chloroform was concentrated, and the residue was purified on silica gel column chromatography.    Consequently, 3.58 g (73.5%) of N-geranyl-0-tetraacetylgalacturonaraide was obtained as a viscous oily substance, from its hexane-acetone (3^1) distillate.<br>

Synthesis Example 8- Synthesis of N-geranoylcysteine<br>
To a THF (20 ml) solution containing geranic acid (1.68 g, 10 mmols), triethylamine (l.Ol g, 10 mmols) was added and cooled to 0°C, into which a THF (5 ml) solution of isobutylchloroformate (1.37 g, 10 mmols) was added dropwise, followed by 30 minutes' stirring at 0°C. To the reaction mixture a solution of cysteine (1.35 g, 10 mmols) as dissolved in IN sodium hydroxide (10 ml) was added, followed by an hour's stirring at 0°C and further 4 hours' stirring at room temperature.   After termination of the reaction, 10 ml of IN hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 10<br><br>
minutes at room temperature.   Then the reaction mixtvu-e was condensed with a rotary evaporator.    To the residue ethanol was added, and whereupon precipitated sodium chloride was removed by filtration.    The ethanol solution was once again condensed under reduced pressure with the evaporator, and the residue was separated on silica gel column chromatography.    Thus 0.566 g of the title compound was obtained from the hexane-acetone (2'-l) distillate. The yield was 19.5%:<br>
'H NMR(CDCl3)6=1.59(6H, s), 1.68(3H, s), 2.00-2.24(4H, m), 2.60-2.77(lH, m), 3.00-3.30(2H, ra), 4.48-4.58(lH, m), 5.00-5.13(lH, m), S.96(lH,s).<br>
Synthesis Example 9: N-geranoyltyrosine<br>
Synthesis Example 8 was repeated except that the cysteine was replaced with tyrosine, to provide the title compound:<br>

Synthesis Example 10: Synthesis of glutamic digeranyldiamide<br>
To a THF (20 ml) solution of N-benzyloxycarbonylglutamic acid (2.634 g, 9.4 mmols), triethylamine (1.899 g, 18.8 mmols) was added and cooled to Q°C,   Into this mixture a THF (10 ml) solution of isobutyl chloroformate (2.566 g, 18.8 mmols) was added dropwise, followed by 30 minutes' stirring at 0°C.    Then a THF (10 ml) solution of geranylamine (2.880 g, 18.8 mmols) was added dropwise, followed by an hour's stirring at 0°C and further 4 hours' stirring at room temperature.    After termination of the reaction, 150 ml of chloroform was added to the system, and the chloroform solution was washed with water and dried over magnesium sulfate.    The organic solvent was removed with an evaporator and the residue was separated on silica gel column chromatography.    Thus 3.034 g of N-benzyloxycarbonylglutamic digeranyldiamide was obtained from<br><br>
the hexane-acetone (2:i) distillate.   The yield was 58.6%.<br>
Then the N-benzyloxycarbonylglutamic digeranyldiamide (3.034 g, 5,5 mmols) was dissolved in methanol (20 ml), and to the same solution 20 ml of IN sodium hydroxide was added, followed by 5 hours' stirring at room temperature.   The reaction mixture was condensed with an evaporator, and the residue was separated on silica gel column chromatography to provide the object compound from the hexane-ethanol (3:1) distillate.   Because the as-obtained product was viscous and amorphous, ether was added to the product for crystallization.    Upon suction-filtering the system, 852 mg of the object compound was obtained.   The yield was 37.2%-<br>

Synthesis Example 12: Synthesis of N-glucosylmevalonamide<br>
Glucosamine hydrochloride (2.16 g, 10 mmols) was dissolved in 20 ml of water, and to the aqueous solution 10 ml of IN sodium hydroxide and mevalolactone (1.30 g, 10 mmols) were added, followed by 5 hours' heating under stirring at 55°C.   After termination of the reaction, the reaction mixture was condensed under reduced pressure. To the residue 100 ml of methanol was added and whereupon separated precipitate was filtered off.    The filtrate was condensed again with an evaporator and the residue was separated on silica gel column chromatography, to provide 1.45 g of the object product from the ethanol distillate.    The yield was 47%.   Because the as-obtained product was a viscous oily substance, a minor amount of dichloromethane was added thereto to effect crystallization.   Upon suction filtering, 1.10 g of the title compound was obtained, which was strongly hygroscopic and its melting point could not be measured:<br>
