				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of instant cooking pulses and whole legumes like Bengalgram dhal (Channa dhal}, redgram dhal (Masoor dhal), Blackgram dhal (Urd dhal), Green gram dhal (Moong dhal) and whole legumes like whole Greengram, whole Blackgram, whole Bangalgram, whole Kabuli channa, whole Rajma, etc.<br>
PRIOR ART.<br>
The pulses (dhals) and whole legumes are generally cooked by open pan boiling or in pressure cooker. Depending upon the nature of pulse and the method of cooking, the cooking time required may vary from 20 min, to 60 min. At higher altitude cooking time is much longer and increases with the altitude.<br>
According to commonly used method for reducing cooking time, the pulses or whole legumes are soaked in water containing sodium and potassium bicarbonate.<br>
The disadvantages of the above method of treating the dhals or whole legumes with various salts like carbonates, bicarbonates, citrates and phosphates is that it results in salty and soapy taste.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above process is that the treatment of dhals/whole legumes with various salts leads to browning of dhals/whole legumes and accelerate the rancidity of the finished product,<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above process is that the reconstitution of the resultant product still requires 15-20 minutes boiling in water.<br>
In another process known in the art, the dhal or whole legume,  after soaking in water for 2-3 hours,  is pressure cooked and the dehydrated at 70 degree Celsius to 80 degree Celsius to a low moisture content of 5-8%.<br>
The disadvantage of the above process is that there is considerable case hardening due to migration of solubles to the surface of the dhal .<br>
Another disadvantage of the above process is that the reconstitution of dehydrated dhals or whole legumes requires 10-25 min boiling for satisfactory reconstitution.<br>
Further disadvantage of the above process is that the dehydrated dhals or whole legumes obtained by the process, on reconstitution, results in inferior product with respect to colour, flavour, taste and texture.<br>
Still another process known in the art is the High Temperature Short Time (HTST) dehydration. In this process, cooked dhal or whole legume is heated at 160 to 200 degree celsius for few minutes and then subsequently dried at lower temperature.<br>
The limitation of the above process is that the dehydrated cooked dhals or whole legumes still require 8-10 minutes for cooking of dhals and 15-20 minutes for whole legumes.<br>
Another process as per the co-pending patent application (2352/DEL/95) is for preparation of dhal flakes. In this process, cooked dhal after hot air conditioning to bring down the moisture content from 55-65% to 20 to 40%, is flaked in a roller flaker and then dried.<br>
The disadvantage of the above process is that the flaking disintegrates the original grain shape and size with the result that the reconstituted product becomes pasty without any grainy texture.<br>
Yet another process as per co-pending Patent Application ( DEL/96) relates to preparation of cooked dhal concentrate/mash. In this process, the cooked dhal mixed with acidulant like acetic and tartaric acid or citric acid is homogenised into a concentrate/mash.<br>
The process also has the disadvantage that the reconstituted product is pasty without any grainy texture.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of instant cooking dhals and whole legumes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of instant cooking dhals and whole legumes which can be reconstituted by mere mixing with hot water in less than 5 minutes without, the need ot of simmering<br>
or boiling.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of instant cooking dhals/whole legumes which are complete in respect of spices, seasoning and salt.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of instant cooking dhals/whole legumes which on reconstitution provides cooked product with grainy texture instead of pasty product obtained by the known processes.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of instant cooking pulses and whole legumes characterised in that the pulses and whole legumes being soaked in cure solution having upto 5% by weight of sodium chloride, potassium chloride or both for 1 to 12 hours, subjecting the cured pulses and legume to the step of cooking in an autoclave/pressure cooker at a pressure of 5 to 20 pounds for 10 min. to 2 hours, conditioning the cooked material to bring down moisture between 45 and 65%, spreading said pulses and legumes in trays and freezing the same at -5 to -20 degree Celsius, removing the frozen material from said trays and shredding the same into small pieces, thawing and drying the material and finally blending the same with refined oil/vanaspati oil or ghee and spices as herein described.<br>
The present invention provides a method for the preparation of instant cooking of dhals such as Bengalgram dhal, Greegratn dhal, Blackgram dhal, Redgram dhal, lentils and whole legumes such as whole Greegram, whole Blackgram,- whole Bengalgram, whole Kabuli channa, whole rajma, whole soyabean and whole Lobia. The dhals and whole legumes are soaked in cure solution containing 0 to 5% of sodium chloride, potassium chloride or both for 1 to 12 hours depending on the nature of dhal and whole legume and cooked in an autoclave/pressure cooker at 5 to 20 pounds steam pressure for 10 min to 2 hours.<br>
The  cooked material is conditioned to  adjust  moisture between  45 and 65% and spread in trays in thickness  of<br>
1/2" to 3" and frozen at -5 to -20 degree Celsius.   The frozen material is removed from trays, broken into small<br>
pieces, thawed by keeping at 15 to 50 degree Celsius and dried  in  a  fluidised  bed  dryer  using  temperatures<br>
ranging  from 60 to 100 degree celsius depending on  the nature of the products to bring moisture content between<br>
2  to  10X.  The dried product is blended  with  refined vegetable  oils/vanaspati  both with and  without  fried<br>
onions, cumene seeds, salt, chilli, turmeric, coriander, pepper  and  cinnamon  powders  in  a  ribbon  type   or<br>
planetary  mixer.   The product is  suitably  packed  in plastic films or their laminates with aluminium foil  in<br>
other hermetically sealed containers to have long  shelf<br>
life.<br>
The  invention is illustrated but not  limited  by<br>
the following examples:— EXAMPLE-1<br>
Five   Kg   of   cleaned  Bengalgram<br>
dhal  is  soaked in 10 litre of 2.7. salt  solution  in  a vessel  for 2 hours.  Soaked dhal is removed and  spread<br>
in  trays  and  cooked in an autoclave at  15  Ib  steam pressure  for  20—25  min.   The  cooked  dhal is cooled<br>
under  forced   air  circulation  and  spread  in  trays<br>
in  2"  thick  layers.  The  trays  are transferred into<br>
contact plate freezing cabinet or freezer maintained nt. -15 to -20 degree Celsius and stored for 8-12 hours. The frozen dhal is removed from trays, broken into small pieces and allowed to thaw at room temperature and transferred into a fluidised bed dryer maintained at 65 degree Celsius. The dhal is dried for 4 hours to bring the moisture to 5%.<br>
Vanaspati (400 g) is melted in a vessel and mixed with 4 kg dried dhal in a planetary mixer. Instant cooking dhal is packed in suitable packs. A packet containing spice mix consisting of cumin seeds, black cardomom, black pepper, cloves, dry ginger, red chillies, turmeric and garlic in powder form is packed alongwith the dhal. Instant cooking dhal reconstitutes in 3 min by adding hot water.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:-<br>
Five kg of cleaned Bengalgram dhal is soaked in 10 litres water in a vessel for 2 hours. Sopaked dhal is removed and spread in trays and cooked in an autoclave at 15 Ibs steam pressure for 25-30 min. The cooked dhal is cooled by blowing air over it and spread in trays in 2" thick layers. The trays are transferred into a contact plate freezing cabinet or a freezer maintained at -15 to -20 degree Celsius and stored for 8 12 hours. The frozen dhal is removed from trays, broken into small pieces and allowed to thaw at room temperature and transferred into a fluidised bed dryer maintained at 60 degree celsius. The dhal is dried for 5 hours to bring the moisture content to 5%.<br>
Vanaspati (800 g) is heated in a vessel to 115 degree celsius and cumene seeds (60 g) are added to it. Immediately the vessel is removed from the gas stove and the spice powder (310 g) prepared by mixing the following spices is added and mixed.<br>
Black cardamom	5 g<br>
Black pepper	5 g<br>
Clove powder	5 g<br>
Coriander seed powder	65 g<br>
Cumene seed powder	80 g<br>
Dry ginger powder	45 g<br>
Red chilli powder	50 g<br>
Turmeric powder	50 g<br>
Garlic powder	5 g<br>
Vessel is covered and kept at room temperature till the temperature decreases to 80 degree Celsius. Dried dhal (4 kg) , fried onions (285 g) and salt {260 g) are added to vanaspati-spice mixutre and mixed in the planetary mixer for 15 min. The instant cooking curried dhal reconstitutes in 4 min by adding hot water.<br>
EXAMPLE-3:-<br>
5 kg of Rajtna is soaked in 10 litre water Cor 8 hours in a vessel. Soaked Rajma is transferred in trays and cooked in an autoclave by maintaining 15 Ibs steam pressure for 15 min. Cooked Rajma is removed from autoclave and cooled by blowing air over the trays. The cooked and cooled Rajma is transferred in trays and thickness of the layer was adjusted to 2" height and frozen by keeping in a freezer at -15 degree Celsius for 12 hours. The frozen product is removed from trays, allowed to thaw and transferred to the Cluidised bed dryer vessel. The product is dried at 60 degree Celsius for 4 hours to bring down the moisture to 6%. The instant cooking Rajma gets cooked when mixed with hot water for 4 min.<br>
