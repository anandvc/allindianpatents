				<td>NOVEL     QUINUCLIDINE     CARBAMATE     DERIVATIVES     AND     MEDICINAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
This invention relates to new therapeutically useful quinuclidine carbamate derivatives, to some processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The novel structures according to the invention are antimuscarinic agents with a potent and long lasting effect. In particular, these compounds show high affinity for muscarinic M3 receptors. This subtype of muscarinic receptor is present in glands and smooth muscle and mediates the excitatory effects of the parasympathetic system on glandular secretion and on the contraction of visceral smooth muscle (Chapter 6, Cholinergic Transmission, in H.P. Rang et al., Pharmacology, Churchill Livingstone, New York, 1995).<br>
M3 antagonists are therefore known to be useful for treating diseases characterised by an increased parasympathetic tone, by excessive glandular secretion or by smooth muscle contraction (R.M. Eglen and S.S. Hegde, (1997), Drug News Perspect., 10(8):462-469).<br>
Examples of this kind of diseases are respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma, cough and rhinitis; urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, neurogenic or unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradycardia (Chapter 7, Muscarinic Receptor Agonists and Antagonists, in Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10the edition, McGraw Hill, Ney York, 2001).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used alone or in association with other drugs commonly regarded as effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example, they can be administered in combination with (32-agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs, phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors an/or leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonists for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a respiratory disease. The claimed compounds are useful for the treatment of the respiratory diseases detailed above in association with p2-agonists, steroids, antiallergic drugs or phosphodiesterase IV inhibitors.<br><br>
Compounds with related structures have been described as anti-spasmodics and anti-cholinergic agents in several patents.<br>
For example, in the patent application EP 747.355 carbamate derivatives are described which are represented by the following general formula<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Wherein each symbol has the following meaning: A ring is a benzene or a pyridine ring,<br>
CB)   ring is a nitrogen-containing saturated hetero-ring which may have a substituent on the nitrogen atom and which may have a cross-linking,<br>
R1 is a phenyl group which may have a substituent, a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms or a five- or six-membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group,<br>
X is a single bond or a methylene group,<br>
Y is a single bond, a carbonyl group, a methylene group which may be substituted with a hydroxyl group or a group represented by the formula -S(O)i -, and I is an integer from 0-2.<br>
These compounds clearly differ from the compounds of the present invention in terms of their structural characteristics, as they always have one hydrogen on the nitrogen of the carbamate bond.<br>
In addition,  another patent  application  EP  801.067  discloses  compounds represented by the formula<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
Wherein        A J    is an aryl group, a cycloalkyl group, a cycloalkenyl group or a<br>
heteroaryl group,<br>
X is a single bond or a methylene group,<br>
I is 0 or 1,<br>
n is an integer of 1 or 2.<br>
These compounds are also different from the compounds claimed in the present invention because the nitrogen of the carbamate group is included in a cyclic structure. In WO 01/04118 are    described compounds having    the following general formula<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
wherein B is a group of formula (i) or (ii):<br>

The present invention also provides processes for preparing compounds of formulas (I) and (II).<br>
Compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by method (a) illustrated in the following scheme and detailed in the experimental section.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In formulas (I), (III) and (IV), R1, R2 and p are as defined above.<br>
Compounds of general formula (III) may be prepared from the corresponding secondary amines following the standard method (b) described in literature.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
Amines of general formula (V) that are not commercially available have been prepared by synthesis according to standard methods. For example, amines wherein R1 is thiophen-2-ylmethyl and R2 is as defined above, were obtained by reductive alleviation. The corresponding aldehyde is treated with the corresponding primary amine to form the imine, which is reduced with sodium borohydride to obtain the secondary amine.<br>
The carbamates of formula (I) may be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts by methods known in the art Typically, a carbamate of formula (I)'is treated with an inorganic or organic add such as furnaric, tartaric , succinic or hydrochloric acid.<br>
The quaternary ammonium derivatives of general formula (II), may be prepared by reaction of an alkylating agent of general formula (VI) with compounds of general formula (I). In formulas (1), (II) and (VI), R1, R2, A, B, X, n, m and p are as defined above.<br>
In formula (VI), W represents any suitable leaving group, such as a group X as defined above. Preferably, W represents a group X.<br>
This alkylation reaction may be carried out by two different experimental procedures, (c) and (d) which are described below. In particular method (d) provides a new experimental process, using solid phase extraction methodologies that allows the parallel preparation of several compounds. If W represents a group other than X, the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (II) is produced from the product of method (c) or (d) by carrying out an exchange reaction according to standard methods to replace the anion W" with the desired anion X'.<br>
Methods (c) and (d) are described in the experimental section. Compounds of general formula (VI) which are not commercially available have been prepared by synthesis according to standard methods. For example, compounds wherein n = 0 and A= -O-, -S- or -NR4, wherein R4 is as defined above, were obtained by reaction of the corresponding aromatic derivative or its potassium salt with an alkylating agent of general formula Y-(CH2)m-X, wherein X may be a halogen and Y may be a halogen or a sulphonate ester. In other examples, compounds of general formula (VI), where n&gt;=1 were synthesised from the corresponding alcohol derivative of general formula (VII) by known methods.<br>

The following examples demonstrate the excellent pharmacological activities of the compounds of the present invention. The results on human muscarinic receptor binding and in the test on bronchospasm in guinea pig, were obtained as described below.<br>
Human muscarinic receptor studies.<br>
The binding of [3H]-NMS to human muscarinic receptors was performed according to Waelbroek et al (1990), Mol. Pharmacol., 38: 267-273. Assays were carried out at 25°C. Membrane preparations from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO) expressing the genes for the human muscarinic M3 receptors were used.<br>
For determination of ICso, membrane preparations were suspended in DPBS to a final concentration of 89 ug/ml for the M3 subtype. The membrane suspension wasincubated with the tritiated compound for 60 min. After incubation the membrane fraction was separated by filtration and the bound radioactivity determined. Non specific binding was determined by addition of 10"4 M atropine. At least six concentrations were assayed in duplicate to generate individual displacement curves.<br>
Our results (Table 1) show that the compounds of the present invention have high affinities for muscarinic M3 receptors, preferably human muscarinic receptors.<br><br>

i/l3 receptor is implicated, including respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive<br>
)ulmonary disease, bronchitis, asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity and rhinitis; urinary<br>
liseases such as urinary incontinence, pollakiuria,    neurogenic bladder, nocturnal<br>
enuresis, unstable bladder, cystospasm and  chronic cystitis; gastrointestinal diseases<br>
such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, diverticulitis and peptic ulceration; and<br>
cardiovascular disorders such as vagally induced sinus bradicardia. For example, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of respiratory diseases<br>
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and rhinitis;<br>
urinary   diseases   such   as   urinary   incontinence   and   pollakinuria   in   neuripenia<br>
pollakinuria, neurogenic bladder, nocturnal enuresis, unstable bladder, cytospasm and<br>
chronic cystitis; and gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic<br>
colitis and diverticulitis.<br>
