e)	Record the type of failures that occurs is recorded.<br>
f)	Photographs of locations of failures before and after tests are taken for reference.<br>
The failures of said tyre in form of burst or any physical deformations and abnormality occurred during test are considered as failure. All the failures during this test of tyre occur on the shoulder or crown area. Any failures such as side wall or bead failure shall be considered as least performances and insufficient strength. Modification to be carried out on tyres to improve the side wall strength and re-tested for failure in crown and shoulder area. Energy<br><br><br>
