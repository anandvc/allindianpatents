PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING ENTACAPONE<br>
[001 ] The present invention relates to a new process for manufacturing entacapone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Entacapone (E-N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
nitrophenyl)acrylamide) is a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor often used<br>
in combination with levodopa and a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor in the treatment<br>
of Parkinson's disease. Entacapone is commercially available in a stand-alone formulation<br>
under the trademarks Comtess® and Comtan®, and under trademark Stalevo® in a fixed<br>
combination (levodopa:carbidopa:entacapone: 50 mg:12.5 mg:200 mg, 100 mg:25<br>
mg:200 mg and 150 mg:37.5 mg:200 mg).<br>
[003] U.S. Patent No. 5,446,194 discloses a method for the preparation of N,N-<br>
diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide by refluxing a solution<br>
containing 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde, N,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide and a<br>
catalytic amount of piperidine acetate in dry ethanol. The yield of said method is 73 %.<br>
The product is a crude mixture of the E and Z isomers of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-<br>
dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide having a melting point of 153 °C - 156 °C. The<br>
condensation reaction used in U.S. Patent No. 5,446,194 is called a Knoevenagel<br>
condensation.<br>
[004] U.S. Patent No. 5,135,950 discloses aprocess for the preparation of a stable<br>
and crystallographically essentially pure polymorphic form A of E-N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-<br>
3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide having a melting point of 162 °C - 163 °C.<br>
Said process comprises crystallization of the above described crude mixture of the E and<br>
Z isomers of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide from a<br>
lower aliphatic carboxylic acid containing a catalytic amount of hydrochloric or<br>
hydrobromic acid. The yield of said crystallographically pure polymorphic form A is 70-<br>
80%.<br><br>
[005] WO 2005/070881 purports to disclose a process for manufacturing the stable<br>
polymorphic form A of E-N,N-diemyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
nitrophenyl)acrylamide without isolating a crude solid isomeric mixture of N,N-diethyl-2-<br>
cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide. In said method, the Knoevenagel<br>
condensation step is carried out in an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol,<br>
isobutanol, n-butanol, preferably isopropanol, at reflux temperature in the presence of a<br>
suitable organic base such as piperidine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, piperazine etc.,<br>
preferably piperidine base. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture is poured into<br>
a mixture of chilled water and ethyl acetate. The pH of the solution is adjusted to between<br>
3.5 and 4.0 by adding acid. The ethyl acetate layer is separated, washed with water and<br>
concentrated to obtain the (E)-isomer of polymorphic form A. A serious drawback of the<br>
method disclosed in WO 2005/070881 is that the total yield of the process is low, as the<br>
(Z)-isomer (about 30 %) formed during the reaction is not recovered and remains in the<br>
reaction solution, thus interfering with the crystallization of the E-isomer.<br>
[006] WO 2005/063696 purports to disclose a method for producing N,N-diethyl-2-<br>
cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide by heating 3,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
nitrobenzaldehyde, raw N,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide, acetic acid and diethyl amine in<br>
toluene, and by removing the water formed during the reaction through azeotropic<br>
distillation. A significant drawback of this method is that a large amount of solvent has to<br>
be used.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[007] Applicants have discovered a process for manufacturing entacapone, which is<br>
industrially applicable due to its good quality and yield, controllability, and use of<br>
desirably low amounts of reagents and/or solvents.<br>
[008] One aspect of the invention is a process for manufacturing E-N,N-diethyl-2-<br>

b)	optionally cooling the resulting mixture from step a);<br>
c)	optionally seeding the resulting mixture from step a) or step b) with N,N-diethyl-<br>

the E-isomer by weight in the seeding crystals;<br>
d)	cooling the resulting mixture from step a) or step b) or step c) to a temperature of<br>
30 °C or below;<br>
e)	seeding the cooled mixture from step d) with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-<br>
dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising at least 10 % of the Z-isomer by<br>
weight in the seeding crystals;<br>
f)	cooling the mixture from step e) to a temperature of 5 °C or below;<br>
g)	isolating the crystallized product from the mixture; and<br>
h) converting the obtained mixture of E- and Z-isomers of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-<br>
(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide to the E-isomer of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-<br>
3-(3}4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide.<br>
[009] Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in<br>
the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be<br>
learned by the practice of the invention. The objects and the advantages of the invention<br>
will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly<br>
pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
[0010] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and do not restrict the<br>
invention, as claimed.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The applicants have now found that it is possible to manufacture entacapone<br>
with a good yield through a process, which is easy to control, and does not necessitate the<br>
use of large amounts of reagents including catalysts and/or solvents.<br>
[0012] The process of the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	reacting 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide in<br>
the presence of a catalyst in a C 4 to 8 alcohol at reduced pressure and at a temperature of<br>
at least 70 °C;<br>
b)	optionally cooling the resulting mixture from step a);<br><br>
c)	optionally seeding the resulting mixture from step a) or step b) with N,N-diethyl-<br>
2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyI)acrylamide comprising at least 60 % of<br>
the E-isomer by weight in the seeding crystals;<br>
d)	cooling the resulting mixture from step a) or step b) or step c) to a temperature of<br>
30 °C or below;<br>
e)	seeding the cooled mixture from step d) with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-<br>
dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising at least 10 % of the Z-isomer by<br>
weight in the seeding crystals;<br>
i) cooling the mixture from step e) to a temperature of 5 °C or below;<br>
g) isolating the crystallized product from the mixture; and<br>
h) converting the obtained mixture of E- and Z-isomers of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-<br>
(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide to the E-isomer of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-<br>
3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide.<br><br>
Representative embodiments<br>
[0013] The reaction between 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde and N,N-diethyl-2-<br>
cyanoacetamide is carried out in a straight or branched chained C4 to C8 alcohol, such as<br>
n-butanol or isoamyl alcohol. Performed under reduced pressure (i.e., less than<br>
atmospheric pressure), the reaction maybe carried out, for example, at a pressure of 80<br>
kPa or below, or at a pressure of from 10 to 80 kPa. The reaction takes place at a<br>
temperature of at least 70 °C. For instance, the reaction temperature may be from 70 to<br>
115 °C, from 75 to 105 °C, or from 80 to 85 °C.<br>
[0014] The reaction between 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde and N,N-diethyl-2-<br>
cyanoacetamide is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, such as organic amines and/or<br>
salts thereof. Example catalysts include one or more of methylamine hydrochloride,<br>
piperidine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine and piperazine. For instance, the reaction may<br>
be carried out in the presence of methylamine hydrochloride and piperidine, in the<br>
presence at least one organic amine and at least one organic acid, e.g. in the presence of<br>
piperidine and acetic acid, in the presence of methylamine, piperidine and acetic acid, or<br>
in the presence of piperidine and formic acid.<br>
[0015] In one embodiment of the invention, the reaction between 3,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
nitrobenzaldehyde and N,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide is facilitated using water<br>
separation. Different techniques may be used to achieve water separation, such as<br>
azeotropic distillation and Dean Stark water separation. Water separation may also be<br>
achieved by adding to the reaction mixture one or more components capable of absorbing<br>
water, such as molecular sieves, carbonates or sulphates of alkali earth metals or alkali<br>
metals. In a similar way, one or more components capable of removing water through a<br>
chemical reaction such as carbodiimides, e.g. cyclohexylcarbodiimides maybe added.<br>
[0016] The reaction may take place over a time period sufficient to react 3,4-<br>
dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide. Example reaction<br>
times include from 45 minutes to 10 hours, from 45 minutes to 6 hours, or from 2 hours to<br>
5 hours.<br><br>
[0017] The mixture produced from reaction step a) is optionally cooled in step b), for<br>
example, cooled to a temperature of from 70 to 75 °C. The mixture produced from<br>
reaction step a), or the optionally cooled mixture from step b), may be optionally seeded<br>
in step c) with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide<br>
comprising at least 60 % of the E-isomer in the seeding crystals. In one embodiment, the<br>
amount of the E-isomer in optional step c) is from 65 to 100 % of the seeding crystals.<br>
[0018] The mixture produced from reaction step a), or the optionally cooled mixture<br>
from step b), or the optionally seeded mixture from step c), is then cooled in step d) to a<br>
temperature of 30 °C or below, for example to a temperature of from 25 to 30 °C. In one<br>
embodiment, the mixture is cooled in step d) to a temperature of from 25 to 30 °C and the<br>
cooling rate is from 10 to 30 °C per hour.<br>
[0019] The cooled mixture from step d) is then seeded in step e) with N,N-diethyl-2-<br>
cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising at least 10 % of the Z-<br>
isomer in the seeding crystals. In one embodiment, the amount of the Z-isomer in step e)<br>
is from 20 to 100 % of the seeding crystals.<br>
[0020] In step f) of the invention, the seeded mixture from step e) is cooled to a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or below, for example to a temperature of from -5 to 5 °C. In one<br>
embodiment, me mixture is cooled in step f) at a cooling rate of from 2 to 20 °C per hour,<br>
or at a cooling rate of from 3 to 10 °C per hour.<br>
[0021 ] The isolation of step g) may be carried out using any isolation procedure used<br>
to isolate solids from liquids, for instance filtering. The isolated solid is then washed.<br>
The purpose of the washing is to replace the impure liquid in the filtering cake and to<br>
separate the catalyst and possible other agents, for instance water removing agents, from<br>
the product. In case organic amines are used as catalysts (as opposed to their salts), the<br>
removal of the catalyst maybe facilitated by acidifying the reaction mixture before the<br>
isolation.<br>
[0022] In step h) of the invention, the mixture of the Z- and E-isomers of N,N-diethyl-<br>
2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide is converted to the E-isomer. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the mixture is converted to a crystallographically essentially pure polymorph<br>
A of the E-isomer having principal X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) peaks at 9.0,21.9<br>
and 23.3 when performed by Diffractomer Philips X'Pert PRO (PANalytical). A copper<br>
target X-ray (wavelength 0.1541nm) tube was operated with the power of 45kV x 40 mA.<br>
A real time multiple strip detecteor X'Celerator was used. Polymorph A may be made, for<br>
instance, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,135,950 which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0023] In one embodiment, the mixture is converted to the polymorph D of the E-<br>
isomer having principal XRD peaks at 6.8,24.6 and 27.4 when measured using the same<br>
equipment and conditions as above. Polymorph D may be prepared by several methods,<br>
for instance, those disclosed in WO 2005/066117 and WO 2005/063696 incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0024] One representative embodiment of the invention comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
a)	reacting 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide in<br>
the presence of at least one organic amine and/or its salt in n-butanol at a temperature of<br>
from 80 to 85 °C;<br>
b)	optionally neutralizing the organic amine and/or cooling the resulting mixture to a<br>
temperature of from 70 to 75 °C;<br>
c)	optionally seeding the resulting mixture from step b) with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-<br>
(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising from 60 to 100 % of the E-<br>
isomer by weight in the seeding crystals<br>
d)	cooling the resulting mixture from step c) to a temperature of from 25 to 30 °C;<br>
e)	seeding the cooled mixture from step d) with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-<br>
dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising from 10 % to 100 % of the Z-<br>
isomer by weight in the seeding crystals;<br><br>
f)	cooling the mixture from step e) to a temperature of from -5 to 5 °C;<br>
g)	isolating the crystallized product from the mixture; and<br>
h) converting the obtained mixture of E- and Z-isomers of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-<br>
(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide to the E-isomer of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-<br>
3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide.<br>
[0025] Another representative embodiment of the invention comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
a)	reacting 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde withN,N-diethyl-2-cyanoacetamide in<br>
the presence of at least one organic amine and/or its salt in isoamyl alcohol at a<br>
temperature of from 85 to 95 °C;<br>
b)	optionally neutralizing the organic amine and/or cooling the resulting mixture to a<br>
temperature of from 70 to 75 °C;<br>
c)	optionally seeding the resulting mixture from step b) with N,N-diethyI-2-cyano-3-<br>
(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising from 60 to 100 % of the E-<br>
isomer by weight in the seeding crystals;<br>
d)	cooling the resulting mixture from step c) to a temperature of from 25 to 30 °C;<br>
e)	seeding the cooled mixture from step d) with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3 -(3,4-<br>
dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide comprising from 10 % to 100 % of the Z-<br>
isomer by weight in the seeding crystals;<br>
f)	cooling the mixture from step e) to a temperature of from -5 to 5 °C;<br>
g)	isolating the crystallized product from the mixture; and<br>
h) converting the obtained mixture of E- and Z-isomers of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-<br>
(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide to the E-isomer of N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-<br>
3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide.<br><br>
[0026] In one embodiment of the above-described two representative processes, a<br>
mixture of an organic amine and a salt of another organic amine is used in step a),<br>
wherein said organic amine is piperidine and the salt is memylamine hydrochloride.<br>
[0027] If an organic amine is used in step a) (as opposed to its salt) it is possible to<br>
facilitate its later removal by neutralizing it after the completion of the reaction (e.g. in<br>
step b), for example by adding first water and then an acid (or an aqueous mixture of an<br>
acid), for instance a strong acid such as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid.<br>
[0028] As mentioned above, entacapone is a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT)<br>
inhibitor that can be used in combination with levodopa and a dopa decarboxylase (DDC)<br>
inhibitor to treat Parkinson's disease. The pharmacologically effective amount of<br>
entacapone is dependent on numerous factors known to those skilled in the art, such as,<br>
•the severity of the condition of the patient, the frequency and the desired duration of use,<br>
etc. The amount of entacapone in an appropriate formulation is typically from 25 to 400<br>
mg, e.g. 25 to 300 mg, especially 50 to 200 mg.<br>
[0029] All levodopa+carbidopa (or benserazide respectively) combinations may be<br>
used together with the entacapone manufactured according to the process of the invention.<br>
They are commercially available as combination tablets sold in Europe under, for<br>
instance, the following trademarks: Nacom® (distributed by X), Sinemet® (distributed by<br>
X). Levodopa and benserazide are commercially available as combination tablet in<br>
Europe under the trademark Madopar® (distributed by Roche).<br>
[0030] The invention will be further clarified by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 Mixture of the E and Z isomers of N.N-diemvl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dfoyclroxy-5-<br>
nitrophenvDacrvlamide<br>
[0031] A vessel is charged with 240 ml of n-butanol, 120 g of 3,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
nitrobenzaldehyde, 4.8 g of memylamine hydrochloride, 122 g of N,N-<br>
diethylcyanoacetamide and 7.2 ml of piperidine. The temperature is raised using water<br><br>
separation under vacuum to about 82 °C and the reaction mixture is boiled at this<br>
temperature using water separation for 4 hours. The reaction is followed using HPLC.<br>
[0032] After completing the reaction 240 ml of hot water is added to the reaction<br>
mixture and 2.4 ml of strong sulphuric acid is added.<br>
[0033] The reaction mixture is cooled to a temperature of 75 °C and seeded with<br>
crude N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide (comprises 70 %<br>
by weight of the E- isomer). After seeding the mixture is cooled to about 28 °C within 3<br>
hours, during which time the E isomer crystallizes.<br>
[0034] The reaction mixture is seeded with a mixture of the E and Z isomers of N,N-<br>
diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)acrylamide (comprises about 30 % by<br>
weight of the Z- isomer) and mixed at about 28 °C for two hours. Thereafter the mixture<br>
is cooled slowly to 0 °C during which time the Z isomer crystallizes.<br>
[0035] The mixture is filtered and washed twice with 60 ml of cold water and the<br>
filtering cake is dried. The yield is about 90 % and the purity over 99.5 %.<br>
Example 2 Mixture of the E and Z isomers of N,N-diethvl-2-cvano-3-(3,4-dihvdroxv-5-<br>
