BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is generally related to a vacuum packing apparatus and method which allows fine particulate matter to be packed, in high density, in large packing sacks.<br>
Background Description<br>
Vacuum packing is used in a wide variety of industries to package particulate and non-particulate materials. Vacuum packing protects the product from oxidation during shipping and storage. In addition, vacuum packing helps minimize the total volume occupied by the packaged product and storage container, thus allowing more units of product to be stored in a selected volume.<br>
Packaging products comprised of small particles presents several technical problems, particularly where large quantities of the small particles are desired. For exemplary purposes only, precipitated silica is an example of a small particle product that is used in a variety of industrial applications. For example, it is an additive which is used in the manufacture of toothpaste, it has applications as a de-foamer in food and non-food applications, it is used in paper manufacturing, as well as in a variety of other applications.<br><br>
2<br>
Precipitated silica particles are typically on the order of 1-10 microns in size. Thus, these particles cannot simply be poured into a storage sack or container since they have a very low weight and would tend to aerosolize in the ambient air.   Applying vacuum pressure to the particles during packing can enable these small particles to amass in a packaging bag. However, simply pulling a vacuum through' a paper bag, as is done for example in packaging coffee, is not satisfactory.  Specifically, in order to obtain a dense product using prior art vacuum packing strategies, the size of the bags would need to be limited to 25 lbs. This would present complex handling and shipping problems since multiple bags would be required for a particular application.<br>
Furthermore, if a large sack were used instead of a small bag, and vacuum suction were only pulled through the bottom of the sack so as to allow larger quantities of product to accumulate in the sack, then a density gradient for the product in the sack would result where the product would be more dense at the bottom of the sack and less dense at the top. This density gradient would be a function of the vacuum pressure being exerted at progressively lower levels as more product is installed in the bag due to both having to exert vacuum pressure through previously packed materials and having to exert vacuum pressure at a greater distance from the bottom of the sack. As a result, the packed product would occupy more space than desired, and would make stacking of packed sacks more difficult, both problems being due to the lower density packing of product at the top of the sacks.<br><br>
2A<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a vacuum packing apparatus, comprising:<br>
a shell defining an inner cavity volume and an open end;<br>
filter media, such as herein described, positioned on an inner surface of said shell adjacent said inner cavity volume;<br>
a vacuum source connected to said shell to exert vacuum pressure through said filter media into said inner cavity volume; and<br>
a port traversing through said shell which allows product from a product source to pass into said inner cavity volume defined by said shell.<br>
According to the invention, a vacuum sack packing apparatus includes a vacuum shell which fits within a sack, bag or other suitable<br><br>
3<br>
container.  The vacuum shell can be formed in any desired shape (e.g., cylinder, cube, rectangular block, etc.) and is selected to define the shape and volume of the finished product packaging.  A filter media is positioned on the inner surfaces of the vacuum shell.  In the preferred embodiment, the filter media is comprised of a plastic grid with a filter material liner positioned over the grid and it operates by having vacuum pressure exerted through the filter material liner.  The grid serves to space the filter material liner from the walls of the vacuum shell and to distribute suction pressure evenly inside the vacuum shell.<br>
In the case of large sack packing, such as with a super sack having dimensions in excess of 40x40x50 cubic inches (most preferably 42x42x55 cubic inches), it is preferred that the vacuum shell be used in combination with a platform which also applies vacuum pressure.  The platform could be comprised of the same or different filter media used in the vacuum shell, and could be connected to the same or a different vacuum source as the vacuum shell.  In addition, the vacuum pressure exerted by the platform and the vacuum shell could be independently or simultaneously controlled, and could exert the same or a different pressure.  The platform is used to maintain the bottom of the sack flat during filling and to apply additional- vacuum pressure for filling and densifying particulate product in the sack.  Ideally, the vacuum shell would rest on the platform during vacuum filling such that a uniform vacuum pressure would be exerted with a space defined by the platform under the base of sack and the filter media on the inside surfaces of the vacuum shell.<br>
In operation, the vacuum shell is positioned within the container to be filled.  The material to be packaged, which for example can be small particle powders such as precipitated silicas, is ported into the vacuum shell under vacuum pressure.  The particles would adhere firmly to the filter media of the vacuum shell during filling of the container, and, in the<br><br>
4<br><br><br>
case of sack filling, to the base of the sack via the vacuum pressure applied by the platform.  The vacuum pressure allows the particulates to be densely packed within the volume defined by the vacuum shell. Periodically, air or other suitable gases (e.g., nitrogen), can be pulsed into the shell to clean the filter medium.  Thereafter, the vacuum pressure can begin again to densify particles within the container and to further fill the container with additional particulate matter.  After a desired volume and density of particulate product is installed within the vacuum shell, the vacuum shell is withdrawn from the container, and the container is closed or otherwise sealed.<br>
ACCOMPANYING BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
The foregoing and other objects, aspects and advantages will be better understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic, cut-away side view of one embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic, cut-away side view of another embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show alternative embodiments of this invention, and are examples of the type of vacuum packing apparatus contemplated by the claims.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that alternative configurations for the components described in conjunction with Figures 1 and 2 could be implemented within the spirit and scope of<br><br>
5<br>
the appended claims.  In addition, for exemplary purposes only, the invention is described in conjunction with packing precipitated silica powder in large-sized super sacks; however, it will be noted by those of skill in the art that the methods and apparatus can be employed with a wide variety of products to allow vacuum packing within a wide variety of different containers.  Like numerals in Figures 1 and 2 denote like elements.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show a vacuum shell 10 having a top 12 and side walls 14 fitted within a sack 16.  Containers such as boxes, cartons, bags, cylindrical vessels, etc., could be used within the practice of this invention instead of the sack 16.  A sack 16 has been selected to illustrate the use of this invention in packing large quantities of dry powder materials, such as 1-10 micron sized precipitated silica, within a large sack (e.g., a super sack having dimensions of 42x42x55 cubic inches).  Indeed, experiments have shown the ability to pack over 400 lbs of precipitated silica within such a sack using the invention described herein, and this is a significantly greater quantity than has been achieved with prior art vacuum packing systems that do not employ a vacuum shell 10.<br>
The vacuum shell 10 can be fabricated from steel, aluminum, or other suitable materials, and should be of sufficient strength and integrity to withstand vacuum forces exerted within an inner cavity 18 defined by the side walls 14 and open end 15 when the open end is positioned on platform 17, or is otherwise in contact with an inside surface of the sack 16.  The vacuum shell 10 is preferably configured in the shape of the desired finished product packaging.  That is, the inner cavity 18 of the shell 10 can be in the shape of a cylinder, rectangular block, cube, or the like, as the packaging requirements require.<br>
The vacuum shell 10 includes a filter media on its inside surface which, in the preferred embodiment, includes a grid 20 and a filter<br><br>
6<br>
material 22.  The grid 20 spaces the filter material 22 away from the sidewalls 14 of the shell 10, and allows vacuum pressure exerted by a vacuum source connected at port 24 to be evenly distributed throughout the inner cavity 18.  The grid 20 can be made of plastics, metals, or other suitable materials, and, in the preferred embodiment, can have multiple passages on the order of 1/4" to 1/2" in diameter.  The filter material 22 is designed to withdraw air from the inner cavity 18, but to leave particulate material within the inner cavity.  Thus, the filter material 22 must be chosen such that the pores therein are smaller than the particles intended to be filled in the sack 16.  In filling sacks with precipitated silica, it is expected that the filter material 22 should have a pore diameter small enough to retain the silica in the cavity 18.  Suitable materials which might be used as the filter material 22 include polytetrafluoroethylene coated polyester and other treated polyesters.<br>
Paniculate material will be deposited into the cavity 18 defined by the vacuum shell 10 via a port 26 which extends through the vacuum shell 10.  The port 26 can take the form of a gravitation hopper feed as shown in Figure 1, or a plurality of feed conduits 27, as shown in Figure 2.    The plurality of feed conduits 27 can be used as a means for depositing particulate material from the same source into the same sack via different conduits, or from different sources into the same sack.  In some applications, different particulate materials can be mixed together in the same sack by controlling access through selected ports 27 from different sources of particles.  Vacuum pressure exened through the filter media on the inner surfaces of the vacuum shell 10 draws the particulate material into the inner cavity 18, as indicated by arrow 28.  In filling sacks 16 with light weight, small particulates such as precipitated silica, it is expected that vacuum pressures within the range of 15" to 20" Hg will be satisfactory to fill the inner cavity 18, and densify the precipitated silica<br><br>
7<br>
therein.  The particulate material (not shown) coats the inner walls of the vacuum shell 10 during filling.  To aid in vacuum packing, the vacuum pressure inside the vacuum shell 10 can be periodically turned off and the filter media can be pulsed with a gas such as air or nitrogen.  This knocks particulate material caked onto the filter 22 off and into the center and bottom of the cavity 18.  After the pulse, the vacuum pressure is reinstated to allow further filling of the sack 16 inside of the inner cavity 18, and densificiation of the particulate material therein.<br>
Measurements can be made to determine the volume and density of product within the inner cavity 18.  For example, volume can be determined by monitoring the level of particulate within the inner cavity 18, and density can be determined from a volume measurement and a measurement of the amount of particulate material which has been deposited through the conduit 26.  Alternatively, density can be computed from the volume measurement and a weight measurement taken at platform 17.  Figure 2 emphasizes that the vacuum shell 10 need not be smaller than sack 16 being filled.  Rather, all that is required is that the operator have some mechanism for determining when to stop filling the sack 16.<br>
Once a sack 16 has a sufficient quantity of particulate material therein, as may be determined by volume and/or density measurements, or by other means such as simple visual inspection, the vacuum pressure is ceased, and the vacuum shell 10 is withdrawn from the sack 16.  The sack 16 is then closed by securing the top members 30 together.  This can be accomplished using a drawstring, by heat sealing, by gluing, by stapling, and by or other suitable means.  Because the particulate material is densely packed in the inner cavity space 18, the final product assumes a shape molded by the contours of the vacuum shell 10.  Hence, the particulate product can be molded into a large, stackable configuration to allow easier<br><br>
8<br>
transport and handling.  If desired, air positioned in the region once occupied by the vacuum shell prior to withdrawal from the sack 16 can be withdrawn prior to or after closure of the sack using conventional vacuum pressure techniques (e.g., drawing a vacuum against the sack 16 after closure of top members 30).<br>
A particular advantage of the present invention is that the sack 16 can be made from a non-porous material such as plastic (e.g., polyethylene coated materials).  Traditionally in vacuum packing operations, the storage sack itself is porous.  However with the present invention, materials, such as precipitated silica, can be vacuum packed and sealed in a non-porous sack which will provide moisture resistance, etc., that will enable the integrity of the product to be maintained during shipping.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates one configuration for positioning the vacuum shell 10 on the platform 17.  In particular, the sack 16 is positioned on the platform 17 and pulled up around the vacuum shell.  A pair of scissor legs 32 raises the platform 17 and sack 16 up to vacuum shell such that the vacuum shell rests on the platform 17 and makes a vacuum seal therewith, thus allowing vacuum pressure exerted through filter 22 to tightly pack and density particulate product drawn 28 down through port 26 into the inner cavity 18.  It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that there are other equivalent mechanisms for positioning the vacuum shell 10 in the sack 16 and bringing the shell 10 into contact with platform 17.<br>
The platform 10 can be made from a soft, rubber material to assist in the formation of a vacuum tight inner cavity.  Alternatively, and as is best shown in Figure 2, the platform 17' could include a vacuum pressure applying mechanism similar to that used within the inner cavity 18.  For example, the platform 17' could include a . second filter media comprised of a grid and filter material similar to that used on the inner surfaces of the vacuum<br><br>
9<br>
shell 10.   An advantage of this configuration is that the platform 17' would hold the bottom of the sack 16 flat such that a vacuum tight seal between the platform 17' and vacuum shell 10 could be more easily be achieved.  If desired, the same source of vacuum pressure (e.g., a pump or the like), could be connected to both the shell 10 and platform 17' such that vacuum pressure can be uniformly controlled within cavity 18. However, in some applications, separate control of vacuum pressure for the platform 17' and shell 10 may be desired.<br>
