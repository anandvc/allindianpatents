COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF AN ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOSITION"<br>
JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC, a British company of 2-4 Cockspur Street, Trafalgar Square, London SW1Y 5BQ, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>
-6 MAY 2005        7-10-2004<br><br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an organometailic composition and more particularly to organometailic composition based on Group IVB metals and which are useful in polyisocyanate compositions especially compositions for binding lignocellulosic material.<br>
The use of organic polyisocyanates as binders for lignocellulosic material in the manufacture of sheets or moulded bodies such as waferboard. chipboard, fibreboard and plywood is well known. In a typical process the organic polyisocyanate, optionally in the form of a solution, dispersion or aqueous emulsion, is applied to the lignocellulosic material which is then subjected to heat and pressure.<br>
One suitable polyisocyanate composition is disclosed in PCT Application WO 97/17388. This composition comprises a Group IVB metal compound, preferably a titanium chelate, optionally in combination with a compatibilising compound and/or conventional release agents. Although these compositions perform well as binders for lignocellulosic material and provide good release performance, it is desirable to develop a more economical composition which provides improved stability on storage before use. together with good curing properties and excellent bonding strength wnen applied to the lignocellulosic material.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that certain compounds of Group IVB metals and acetoacetate esters can be used to cure poiyisocyanate compositions and these compositions are very stable on prolonged storage and economical when used for binding lignocellulosic material.<br>
According to the invention, an organometailic composition comprises a complex of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium and hafnium and an acetoacetate ester in which the molar ratio of Ti or Hf to acetoacetate ester is in the range 1 : 2.5 to 1:10 or the molar ratio of Zr<br><br><br>
WO 00/02885<br><br>
PCT/CB99/0I982<br><br><br>
to acetoacetate ester is in the range 1 : 4.5 to 1 : 10 and said acetoacetate ester is an ester of an alcohol containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
The titanium, zirconium or hafnium composition of the invention is described herein as a "complex". It is believed that some of the acetoacetate   ester will be chemically bound to the metal (Ti, Zr or Hf) but some can be described as "free" ester. The exact proportions which are bound and free will depend partly upon the exact molar ratios present in the complex and which metal, or metals, are used, but it has been shown that the "free" ester does influence the properties, particularly the stability on storage of polyisocyanate<br>
      compositions containing the complexes.<br>
The molar ratio of titanium or hafnium to acetoacetate ester in the complex is in the range 1 : 2.5 to 1 : 10. When the metal is titanium, the molar ratio is preferably in the range 1 : 2.5 to 1 : 8 and more preferably in the range 1 : 3 to 1 : 6. Particularly preferred compounds have a molar ration in the range<br>
   1 : 4 to 1 : 6. In agreement with conventional theories about the co-ordination chemistry of titanium, it is believed that two molecules of acetoacetate ester will be chemically bound to a titanium atom and the remainder will be "free". When the metal is hafnium, the molar ratio is preferably 1 : 4.5 to 1 : 10 and more preferably 1 : 4.5 to 1 : 8, hafnium to acetoacetate ester. When the metal is<br>
      zirconium, the molar ratio is from 1 : 4.5 to 1 : 10 and preferably from 1 : 4.5 to 1   : 8, zirconium to acetoacetate ester. For hafnium or zirconium, again in accordance with conventional theory, it is believed that, for complexes which contain 4 or more moles of acetoacetate ester. 4 molecules of acetoacetate ester are chemically bound to each atom of zirconium or hafnium and the<br>
  remainder are "free".<br>
Preferably, the complex is a complex of at least one of titanium and zirconium.<br><br><br><br><br>
The preferred acetoacetate ester for preparing the complex is ethyl acetoacetate The complex can be prepared from more than one acetoacetate ester Put preferably only one acetoacetate ester is present in the complex.<br>
Typically, the complexes of titanium, zirconium or hafnium are prepared   from titanium, zirconium or hafnium alkoxides having the general formula M(OR)4 in which M is Ti, Zr or Hf and R is a substituted or unsubstituted, cyclic or linear, aikyl, alkenyl, aryl or alkyl-aryl group or mixtures thereof. Preferably, R contains up to 8 carbon atoms and, more preferably, up to 6 carbon atoms. Generally, all four OR    groups will be identical but alkoxides derived from a<br>
       mixture of alcohols can be used and mixtures of alkoxides can be employed<br>
when more than one metal is present in the complex. Suitable alkoxides include<br>
tetramethoxytitanium,	tetra-ethoxytitanium,	tetra-isopropoxytitanium,<br>
tetra-n-propoxytitanium,    tetrabutoxytitanium,    tetrakis(2-ethylhexoxy)titanium,  tetrakis(2-ethoxyethoxy)titanium,     tetracyclohexyloxytitanium,     tetraphenoxy-<br>
        titanium, tetrapropoxyzirconium, tetrabutoxyzirconium, tetra-n-propoxyhafnium and tetra-n-butoxyhafnium.<br>
Alternatively, the complex can be prepared from condensed alkoxides of   titanium, zirconium or hafnium. These compounds can be represented by the general formula RO[M(OR)20],R, wherein M and R have the same meaning as<br>
        discussed above and x is an integer. Generally, these condensed alkoxides consist of a mixture containing compounds of the above formula with x having a range of values. Preferably, x has an average value in the range 2 to 16 and. more preferably, in the range 2 to 8 A condensed alkoxide is usually prepared by the controlled addition of water to an alkoxide. followed by removal of alcohol<br>
        which is displaced. Suitable condensed alkoxides include the compounds known as potybutyl titanate, polybutyt zrrconate and polyisopropyl titanate. Complexes of condensed alkoxides can also be prepared by forming a complex<br><br>
WO 00/02885<br><br>
PCT/GB99/01982<br><br>
of an acetoacetate ester with an alkoxide. adding water to the complex and removing any by-product alcohol.<br>
Other  titanium,  zirconium  or hafnium compounds,  such  as titanium, zirconium     or hafnium tetrachloride or alkoxides which have been substituted      with, for example, glycol or phosphorus substituents can be usea as raw materials for the formation of the complex used in the invention.<br>
The complex can be readily prepared by mixing, for example, an alkoxide or condensed alkoxide with an appropriate amount of acetoacetate ester. Alcohol from the alkoxide will be displaced by the acetoacetate ester and,<br>
        preferably, the displaced alcohol is removed by, for example, distillation. In a preferred method, 2 moles of acetoacetate ester per atom of Ti or 4 moles of acetoacetate ester per atom of Zr or Hf are added to an alkoxide or condensed alkoxide and the displaced alcohol is removed by distillation. Any additional acetoacetate ester required is then added to the stripped product. This method<br>
       is advantageous because it provides a consistent product of known stoichiometry. It is possible to add all the acetoacetate ester in one charge and subsequently remove all the displaced alcohol but some of the "free" acetoacetate ester is usually accidentally removed during this process, leading to inconsistent products and contamination of the displaced alcohol.<br>
	Alternatively,  when  an  organometallic composition  according  to  the<br>
invention is used in a polyisocyanate composition, a product containing, for example, 2 moles of acetoacetate ester per Ti atom or 4 moles of acetoacetate ester per Zr or Hf atom can be prepared according to the method outlined above and this can be mixed with a polyisocyanate. Any additional acetoacetate ester<br>
        required to produce the organometallic composition of the invention can be added to the polyisocyanate before or after the titanium, zirconium or hafnium compound has been added. This effectively results in the preparation of an<br><br>
-   WO 00/02885<br><br>
PCT/GB99/01982<br><br>
organometallic composition according to this invention in situ in the poiyisocyanate composition. Other methods of preparing the composition of the invention will be apparent to a person skilled in this art<br>
The organometallic complexes of the invention are particularly useful as   curing agents in poiyisocyanate compositions and compositions suitable for use with the organometallic compositions of the present invention may be any organic poiyisocyanate compound or mixture of organic poiyisocyanate compounds, provided said compounds have at least 2 isocyanate groups. Organic    polyisocyanates    include    diisocyanates,     particularly    aromatic<br>
       diisocyanates, and isocyanates of higher functionality.<br>
Examples of organic polyisocyanates for which the organometallic complexes of the present invention are useful curing agents include aliphatic isocyanates such as hexamethyiene diisocyanate; and aromatic isocyanates such   as   m-   and   p-phenylene   diisocyanate,   tolylene-2,4-   and   tolylene-<br>
         2,6-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4"-diisocyanate, chlorophenylene-<br>
2,4-diisocyanate, naphthylene-1,5-diisocyanate, diphenyiene-4,4"-diisocyanate,<br>

       -2,6-diisocyanate and mixtures thereof and bis-(isocyanatocyclohexyl)methane and triisocyanates such as 2,4,6-triisocyanatotoluene and 2,4,4-tri-isocyanatodiphenylether.<br>
Modified polyisocyanates containing isocyanurate. carbodiimide or uretonimine groups may be employed tn conjunction with the organometallic<br>
       complexes of the invention as well. Further blocked polyisocyanates, like the   reaction product of a phenol or an oxime and a poiyisocyanate, may be used.<br><br><br><br><br>
having a deblocking temperature below the temperature applied when using a<br>
polyisocyanate composition.<br>
The organic polyisocyanate useful with the organometallic composition of<br>
the invention may also be an isocyanate-ended prepolymer made by reacting     an excess of a diisocyanate or higher functionality polyisocyanate with a polyol. Water-emulsifiable organic polyisocyanates like those described in UK<br>
patent no. 1 444 933, in European patent publication no. 516 361 and in PCT<br>
patent publication no. 91/03082 can also be used.<br>
Mixtures   of   isocyanates   may   be   used   in   conjunction   with   the           organometallic composition of the invention, for example a mixture of tolylene<br>
diisocyanate isomers such as the commercially available mixtures of 2,4- and<br>
2,6-isomers   and   also   the   mixture   of   di-   and   higher   polyisocyanates.<br>
Polyisocyanate mixtures may optionally contain monofunctional isocyanates<br>
such as p-ethyl phenyiisocyanate.<br>
	Such   mixtures   are  well-known   in   the   art  and   include   the  crude<br>
phosgenation      products      containing      methylene      bridged      poiyphenyl<br>
polyisocyanates,      including     diisocyanate,      triisocyanate      and     higher<br>
polyisocyanates together with any phosgenation by-products.<br>
Preferred isocyanates to be used in conjunction with the organometallic          complexes of the present invention are those wherein the isocyanate is an<br>
aromatic diisocyanate or polyisocyanate of higher functionality such as a pure<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a mixture of methylene bridged poiyphenyl<br>
polyisocyanates     containing     diisocyanates,     triisocyanates     and     higher<br>
functionality polyisocyanates.<br>
 	Methylene bridged poiyphenyl polyisocyanates are well known in the art.<br>
They are prepared by phosgenation of corresponding mixtures of polyamines.<br>
For   convenience,   polymeric   mixtures   of   methylene   bridged   poiyphenyl<br><br>
WO 00/02885	PCT/GB99/01982<br>
poiyisocyanates containing diisocyanate, triisocyanate and higher functionality polyisocyanates are referred to hereinafter as polymeric MD1. Poiyisocyanates suitable for use with the organometaliic complexes of the invention include SUPRASEC™ DNR. SUPRASEC™ 2185, RUBINATE™ M and RUBINATE™     1840, all available from Imperial Chemical Industries<br>
Preferably the polyisocyanate is liquid at room temperature. Conventional release agents can be added to or used in combination with a polyisocyanate composition  containing a titanium,  zirconium or hafnium complex of an acetoacetate ester according to the present invention.<br>
	In such compositions the conventional release agent is present in an<br>
amount varying between 0.2 and 10 %, preferably between 0.5 and 6 % and most preferably between 1 and 3 % by weight based on the polyisocyanate whereas the titanium, zirconium or hafnium complex of an acetoacetate ester is preferably present in an amount varying between 0.2 and 4 %, most preferably<br>
       between 0.2 and 2 % by weight based on the polyisocyanate.<br>
Examples of conventional release agents inciude polysiloxanes, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids (such as oleic acid) or fatty acid amides or fatty acid esters and polyolefin waxes.<br>
Preferred conventional  release agents to be used  in polyisocyanate<br>
       compositions containing the organometaliic complexes according to the present invention are polyolefin waxes or mixtures of polyolefin waxes, especially functionalised polyolefin waxes, which are dispersible in an aqueous medium to form an aqueous emulsion. More preferably, the poiyolefin waxes are selected from oxidised polyethylene waxes and oxidised polypropylene waxes.<br>
 	A preferred method for using the release agent is to apply the emulsion to<br>
the surface of the polyisocyanate treated lignocellulosic material or to the press metal surface prior to hot pressing the combination.<br><br>
WO 00/02885<br><br>
PCT/GB99/01982<br><br><br>
When used, an aqueous emulsion of the polyoiefin wax should normally contain a sufficient amount of the poiyolefin wax to provide a coverage of about 0.01 to about 1, and preferably about 0.02 to about 0 5 mg of the polyoiefin wax per cm: of lignocellulosic matenal or press metal surface. Generally, iower    levels of poiyolefin wax are preferred as they are more cost effective. When taking the emulsifiers into account, the aqueous emulsions will usually contain about 0.2 to about 10 %, preferably about 0.3 to about 5 % by weight of total solids. The emulsions are usually prepared at 30 to 40 % total solids, transported to the point of use and then diluted with water to the desired<br>
        concentration.<br>
It has been found that the poiyolefin wax emulsion, when used in combination with polyisocyanate compositions containing organometallic compositions of the present invention, may be usefully applied to the lignocellulosic material or press metal surface in an amount equivalent to 8 to<br>
        14 mg per cm".<br>
A particularly preferred polyethylene wax emulsion which can be used in a process in combination with an organometallic composition of the present invention in combination with a poiyisocyanate is Rubilon™ 603 or Rubilon™ 605, both available from Imperial Chemical Industries.<br>
	A particularly preferred polypropylene wax emulsion which can be used in<br>
a process in combination with an organometallic composition of the present invention in combination with a polyisocyanate is ME 42040 available from Michelman Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>
In order to further improve the storage stability of a polyisocyanate<br>
       composition containing an organometallic composition of the present invention a diluent may be added to the composition. Suitable diluents include plasticizers of the type mentioned in Taschenbuch der Kunststoff-Additive", Ed. by R.<br><br>
WO 00/02885	PCT/GB99/0I982<br>
Gachter and H. Muller, Carl Hanser Verlag Munchen, third edition. 1989. Preferred diluents are phthalates, aliphatic carboxylates. fatty acid esters, linseed oil and soybean oil A particularly preferred diluent is Priolube 1403 available from Unichema being methyloleate. These diluents are added in    amounts of from 1 to 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyisocyanate and preferably in amounts of from 1 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyisocyanate.<br>
A composition containing an organometallic composition of the present invention and a polyisocyanate may further comprise conventional additives like<br>
        flame retardants, lignocellulosic preserving agents, fungicides, waxes, sizing agents, fillers, surfactants, thixotropic agents and other binders like formaldehyde condensate adhesive resins and lignin (optionally in combination with a iignin solvent such as described in PCT Patent Application No. EP96/00924).<br>
	A   particularly   preferred   additive   to   be   used   in   a   polyisocyanate<br>
composition containing an organometallic composition of the present invention is a coupling agent such as an organofunctional silane (for example, Dynasylan AMEO. available from Huels). Adding such a coupling agent to the polyisocyanate   composition   leads   to    improved    board   properties.    The<br>
       organofunctional silane coupling agents are used in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 3 %, preferably from 0.1 to 2 % by weight based on the polyisocyanate.<br>
The organometallic composition of present invention can be used in a process for preparing lignocellulosic bodies by bringing lignocellulosic parts into contact   with   a   polyisocyanate   composition   containing   the   organometallic<br>
        composition of the present invention and pressing this combination.<br><br>
WO 00/02885	PCT/GB99/01982<br><br>
A typical process comprises the steps of a)  bringing   said  lignoceiiulosic  material   in   contact  with   a   poiyisocyanate composition containing an organometallic composition of the present invention and,       b) subsequently allowing said material to bind.<br>
The lignoceiiulosic bodies are prepared by bringing the lignoceiiulosic parts into contact with a poiyisocyanate composition by means such as mixing, spraying and/or spreading the composition with/onto the lignoceiiulosic parts and by pressing the combination of the poiyisocyanate composition and the    lignoceiiulosic parts, preferably by hot-pressing, normally at 150° C to 250°C and 2 to 6 MPa specific pressure.<br>
Such binding processes are commonly known in the art.<br>
In   waferboard    manufacture   the   lignoceiiulosic   material   and   the poiyisocyanate composition may be conveniently mixed by spraying the present         poiyisocyanate composition on the lignoceiiulosic material while it is being agitated.<br>
As described hereinbefore, in a preferred process, a release agent, which is preferably an aqueous emulsion of a polyolefin wax, is applied to the surface of the poiyisocyanate treated lignoceiiulosic material or to the press metal         surface prior to hot pressing the combination.<br>
         The   iignocelluiosic   material   after  treatment  with   the   poiyisocyanate<br>
         composition   containing   an   organometallic   composition   according   to   the<br>
          invention is placed on caul plates made of aluminium or steel which serve to<br>
         carry the furnish into the press where it is compressed to the desired extent<br>
          usually at a temperature between 150° C and 250° C.<br>
          While   the   process   is   particularly   suitable   for   the   manufacture   of waferboard known     <br>
          extensively as oriented strand board and will be largely used<br><br>
WO 00/02885	PCT/GB99/0I982<br><br>
for such manufacture, the process may not be regarded as limited in this respect and can also be used in the manufacture of medium density fibreboard, particle board (also known as chipboard) and plywood.<br>
Thus the lignocellulosic material used can include wood strands,       woodchips, wood fibres, shavings, veneers, wood wool, cork, bark, sawdust and like waste products of the wood working industry as well as other materials having a lignocellulosic basis such as paper, bagasse, straw, flax, sisal, hemp, rushes, reeds, rice hulls, husks, grass, nutshells and the iike. Additionally, there may be mixed with the lignocellulosic materials other particulate or fibrous      materials such as ground foam waste (for example, ground potyurethane foam waste), mineral fillers, glass fibre, mica, rubber, textile waste such as plastic fibres and fabrics.<br>
When the polyisocyanate composition containing the organometallic<br>
composition of the invention is applied to the lignocellulosic material, the weight<br>
     ratio of polyisocyanate/iignoceilulosic material will vary depending on the bulk<br>
density of the lignocellulosic material employed. Therefore, the polyisocyanate<br>
compositions may be applied in such amounts to give a weight ratio of<br>
polyisocyanate/iignoceilulosic material in the range of 0.1 : 99.9 to 20 : 80 and<br>
preferably in the range of 0.5 : 99.5 to 10 : 90.<br>
	If desired, other conventional binding agents, such as formaldehyde<br>
condensate adhesive resins, may be used in conjunction with the polyisocyanate composition containing the organometallic composition.<br>
More detailed descriptions of methods of manufacturing waferboard and<br>
       similar products based on lignocellulosic material are available in the prior art.<br>
      The tecnniques and equipment conventionally used can be adapted for use with<br>
       polyisocyanate compositions containing  organometallic compositions of the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
WO 00/02885	PCT/GB99/01982<br><br>
Poiyisocyanate compositions containing organometaliic compositions of the present invention are extremely effective in minimising unwanted adhesion to caul plates, press plates and other surfaces with which the treated lignocellulosic material may come into contact. Their storage stability and   release performance is improved compared to poiyisocyanate compositions of the prior art, as well as the obtained board properties.<br>
The sheets and moulded bodies produced from the poiyisocyanate compositions containing organometaliic compositions of the present invention have excellent mechanical properties and they may be used in any of the       situations where such articles are customarily used.<br>
The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following examples.<br>

Generally, the most relevant period for storage stability at room temperature is the period 14 to 46 days after production of a poiyisocyanate composition. From Tables 6 to 8 above, it can be seen that the optimum (generally, lowest) viscosity after 46 days at 45° C (an accelerated test) is   achieved in Test 2 (2.2 moles methylacetoacetate), Test 8 (2.2 moles ethylacetoacetate) and Comparison 4 (6.6 moles cetyiacetoacetate). The results demonstrate that the titanium complexes used in the composition of the invention provide a more economical means of stabilising the poiyisocyanate composition.<br>
