Technical Field<br>
The disclosures herein relate generally to acyloxyalkyl carbamate prodrugs of (±)-4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)bntanoic acid and analogs thereof, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of making prodrugs of<br>
(±)-4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)butanoic acid and analogs thereof and methods of using prodrugs of (±)-4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)butanoic acid and analogs thereof and pharmaceutical compositions thereof to treat various diseases or disorders. The disclosures herein also relate to such prodrugs suitable for oral administration and for oral administration using sustained release dosage forms.<br>
Background<br>
(±)-4-Amino-3~{4-chiorophenyj)butanoic "acid (baclofen), (1): is an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid (i.e., GAB A) that selectively activates GABAB receptors, resulting in neuronal hyperpolarization. GABAB receptors are located in laminae I-IV of the spinal cord, where primary sensory fibers end. These G-protein coupled receptors activate conductance by K -selective ion channels and can reduce currents mediated by Ca2+ channels in certain neurons. Baclofen has a presynaptic inhibitory effect on the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and also acts postsynaptically to decrease motor neuron firing (see Bowery. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989, 10, 401-407; Misgeld et al,Prog. Neurobiol 1995, 46, 423-462).<br>

A principal pharmacological effect of baclofen in mammals is reduction of muscle tone and the drug is frequently used in the treatment of spasticity. Spasticity is associated with damage to the corticospmal tract and is a common complication of neurological disease. Diseases and conditions in which spasticity may be a prominent symptom include cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, head and spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injury, anoxia and neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with spasticity complain of stiffness, involuntary spasm and pain. These painful spasms may be spontaneous or tri ggered by a minor sensory stimulus, such as touching the patient.<br>
Baclofen is useful in controlling gastro-esophageal reflux disease (van Herwaaxden et-a!., Aliment. Pharmacol Titer. 2002,16, 1655-1662; Ciccaglione et ah, Gut 2003, 52, 464-470; Andrews et a!., U.S. Patent No. 6,117,90S; Fara et al,<br><br>
International Publication No. WO02/096404); in promoting alcohol abstinence in alcoholics (Gessa et al, International Publication No.WO01/26638); in promoting smoking cessation (Gessa et al, International Publication No. WO01/08675); in reducing addiction liability of narcotic agents, (Robson et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,126,684); in the treatment of emesis. (Bountra et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,719,185) and as an anti-tussive for the treatment of cough (Kreutoer et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,006,560).<br>
Baclofen may be administered orally or by intrathecal delivery through a surgically implanted programmable pump. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has an elimination half-life of approximately 3-4 hours. Baclofen is partially metabolized in the liver but is largely excreted by the kidneys unchanged. The short half-life of baclofen necessitates frequent administration with typical oral dosing reginiensi"anging from about 10 to about 80 mg of three or four divided doses daily. Plasma baclofen concentrations of about 80 to about 400 ng/mL result from these therapeutically effective doses in patients (Katz, Am. J: Phys. Med. Rehabil 1988, 2, 108-116; Krach, J. Child Neurol 2001,16, 31-36). When baclofen is given orally, sedation is a side effect, particularly at elevated doses. Impairment of cognitive function, confusion, memory loss, dizziness, weakness, ataxia and orthostatic hypotension are other commonly encountered baclofen side-effects.<br>
Intrathecal administration is often recommended for patients who find the adverse effects of oral baclofen intolerable. The intrathecal use of baclofen permits effective treatment of spasticity with doses less than l/100th of those required orally, since administration directly into the spinal subarachnoid space permits immediate access to the GABAB receptor sites in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Surgical implantation of a pump is, however, inconvenient and a variety of mechanical and medical complications can arise (e.g., catheter displacement, kinking or blockage, pump failure, sepsis and deep vein thrombosis). Acute discontinuation of baclofen therapy (e.g., in cases of mechanical failure) may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as hallucinations, confusion, agitation and seizures (Sampathkurnar et al,<br>
Anesth.Analg.1998, 87, 562-563).       <br>
While the clinically prescribed baclofen product (LioTesal™) is available only as a racemate, the GABAB receptor agonist activity resides entirely in one enantiomer, R-(-)-baclofen (2) (also termed L-baclofen).<br>
5<br><br><br>
Ci<br>
OH<br>
R-Baclofen (2)<br>
The other isomer, S-baclofen, actually antagonizes the action of R-baclofen at GABAB receptors and its antinociceptive activity in the rat spinal cord (Terrence et al, Pharmacology 1983, 27, 85-94; Sawynok et al. Pharmacology 1985, 31, 24S-259). Orally administered R-baclofen is reported to be about 5-fold more potent than orally administered racernic baclofen, with an R-baclofen regimen of 2 mg t.i.d, being equivalent to racernic baclofen at 10 mg t.i.d. (Fromm.e/ al., Neurology 1987, 37,1725-1728). Moreover, the side effect profile, following administration of R-baclofen, has been shown to be significantly reduced, relative to equally efficacious dose of racernic baclofen.<br>
Baclofen, a zwitterionic amino acid, lacks the requisite physicochemical characteristics for effective passive permeability across cellular membranes. Passage of the drug across the gastrointestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are mediated primarily by active, transport processes, rather than by passive diffusion. Accordingly, baclofen is a substrate for active transport mechanisms shared by neutral ct-amino acids like leucine, and p-amino acids like (3-alanine and taurine (van Bree et al, Pharm. Res. 1988, 5, 369-371: Cercos-Fortea et al,Biopharm. Drug. Disp. 1995, 16, 563-577; Deguchi etal, Pharm, Res. 1995,12, 1838-1844; Moll-Navarro etal, J. Pharm. Sci. 1996, 85, 1248-1254). Transport across the BBB is stereoselective, with preferential uptake of the active R-enantiomer (2) being reported (van Bree et al., Pharm. Res. 1991. 8. 259-262). In addition, organic anion transporters localized in capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier have been implicated in efflux of baclofen from the brain (Deguchi et al, supra*, Ohtsuki et al, J. Neurochem. 2002. 83, 57-66). 3~(p-Chlorophenyl)pyrrolidine has been described as a CNS-penetrable prodrug of baclofen (Wall et al.,J. Med. Ckem. 1989, 32, 1340-1348). Prodrugs of other GABA analogs are described in Bryans et al, International Publication No. WO01/90052; Bryans et al, EP1178034; Cundy et al, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0151529; Gallop el al, U.S. Patent Application Publication No.<br><br>
2003/0176398; Gallop et al, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0171303; Gallop ei al, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0006132; and Paillard et al, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0014940.<br>
Sustained released oral dosage formulations are a conventional solution to the problem of rapid systemic drug clearance, as is well known in the art (see, e.g., "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 19th Edition, 1995). Osmotic delivery systems are also recognized methods for sustained drug delivery (See, e.g., Verma et al., Drug Dev. hid. Pkarm. 2000, 26, 695-708). Successful application of these technologies depends on the drug of interest having an effective level of absorption from the large intestine (also referred to herein as the colon), where the dosage form spends a majority of its time during its passage down the gastrointestinal tract. Baclofen is poorly absorbed following administration into the colon in animal models (Merino et al,Biopkarm. Drug. Disp. 1989,10, 219-291), presumably, since the transporter proteins mediating baclofen absorption in the upper region of the small intestine are not expressed in the large intestine. Development of an oral controlled release formulation for baclofen should considerably improve the convenience, efficacy and side effect profile of baclofen therapy. However, the rapid passage of conventional dosage forms through the proximal absorptive region of the small intestine has thus far prevented the successful application of sustained release technologies to this drug. A number of exploratory delivery technologies that rely on either mucoadhesion or gastric retention have been suggested to achieve sustained delivery of baclofen (Sinnreich, U.S. Patent No. 4,996,058; Khanna, U.S. Patent No. 5,091,184; Fara et al, supra; Dudhara et al, International Publication No. WO03/011255) though to date none of these appear to be able to achieve sustain blood levels of baclofen in human subjects.<br>
Thus, there is a significant need for new prodrugs of baclofen and baclofen analogs which are well absorbed in the large intestine/colon and hence suitable for oral sustained release formulations, thus improving the convenience, efficacy and side effect profile of baclofen therapy.<br>

Halide interchange provides iodide (XV), which is reacted with a metal or tetraalkylammonium salt of a carboxylic acid to afford compound (XVI). Treatment of (XVI) with baclofen analog derivative (XI), optionally, in the presence of trirnethylsilyl chloride, affords a compound of Formula (I). Methods for making related acyloxyalkyl carbamate compounds have been described in the art (Alexander, U.S. Patent No. 4,760;057; -Alexander, U.S. Patent No. 4,916,230; Alexander, U.S. Patent No. 5,466,811; Alexander, U.S. Patent No. 5,684,018).<br>
Another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) proceeds via oaroonylation of baclofee analog derivative (VII) to an iniermediats carbamb acid species, which is captured by an in situ alkyiaiion reaction m an adaptation or methods disclosed in the art (Butcher, Synlett 1994, 825-6: Ferres et aL, U.S. Patent 4,036,829). Carbon dioxide gas is bubbled into a solution containing (XI) and a base<br><br>
(e.g., Cs2C03, Ag2C03 or AgO) in a solvent "such as DMF or NMP. The activated halide is added, optionally, in the presence of iodide ion as a catalyst, and the carbonylation continued .until the reaction is completed. This method is illustrated in<br>
Scheme 7 for the preparation of compounds of Formula (I) irom halide (XVII).<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
Yet another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) relies upon oxidation of ketocarbamate derivatives of baclofen and baclofen analogs (e.g:, Gallop et. ah, U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. 2003/0171303; and Bhat et al, U.S. Patent Application<br>
Serial No.	entitled "Methods for Synthesis of Acyloxyalkyl<br>
Compounds"). As illustrated in Scheme. 8, oxidation of ketocarbamate (XVIII) affords a compound of Formula (I). Methods for synthesis of compounds of Formula (XVIII) are disclosed in the pending applications, supra. Typical oxidants include those, which have been successfully used in Baeyer- Villager oxidations of ketones to esters or lactones (Strukul, Angnew. Chem. InL Ed. 1998, 37, 1198; Renz et ah, Eur, J. Org. Chem. 1999, 737; Beller et ah, in "Transition Metals in Organic Synthesis" Chapter 2, Wiley VCH; Stewart, Current Organic Chemistiy, 1998, 2, 195; Kayser et at, Synlett 1999, 1 153). The use of anhydrous oxidants may be beneficial since prodrugs (I) may be labile. Thus, performing the oxidation under anhydrous reaction conditions may avoid hydrolysis of the reactive products.<br><br>
Preferably, the oxidation is performed in the liquid phase, more preferably, in the presence of a solvent.  Choosing a solvent for oxidation of a compound of Foimufa (XVIII) is well within the ambit of one of skill in the art. Generally, a useful<br>
48<br><br>
solvent will dissolve, at least partially, both the oxidant and the compound of Formula (XVIII) and will be inert to the reaction conditions. Preferred solvents are anhydrous and include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, toluene, chlorobeozene, xylene, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, acetic acid, cyclohexane and hexanes. Mixtures of the above solvents may also be used in the oxidation of a compoimd of Formula (XVHI) to a compound of Formula (I).<br>
In some embodiments, the anhydrous oxidant is an anhydrous peroxyacid generated in situ by reaction of the urea-hydrogen peroxide complex (4) ("UHP") with a carboxylic acid anhydride. In other embodiments, the anhydrous oxidant is an anhydrous peroxysulfomc acid generated in situ by reaction of the urea-hydrogen peroxide complex (4) with a sulfonic acid anhydride. The UHP complex serves as a source of anhydrous -hydrogen peroxide and has been used in a variety of oxidative/, transformations in anhydrous organic solvents (Cooper et al.Synlett. 1990, 533-535; BalicMe/ al, Synth- Commun. 1993, 23,3149; Astudillo et al, Heterocycles 1993;. 36, 1075-1.080; Varmaet al, Organic Lett. 1999, L 189-191). However, other suitable sources of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide may also be used in the reaction instead of the UHP-complex (e.g., the l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-hydrogen peroxide complex).<br>
A useful oxidant is anhydrous percxytriflueroacetic acid, generated in s tu by<br>
reacting the UHP-complex with trifluoroacetic anhydride (Cooper et al, SynletL    .<br>
1990, 533-535; Benjamin, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002,124, 827-833). Anhydrous<br>
peroxycarhoxylic acids (XX) may generally be prepared by treating carboxylic acid<br>
anhydrides with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, more preferably, with the	 <br>
UHP-complex (4). Similarly, anhydrous peroxysulfonic acids (XXII) may be prepared by reacting sulfonic acid anhydrides (XXI) with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide, preferably, with the UHP-complex (4). The preparation of anhydrous peroxycarhoxylic acids (XX) and the peroxysulfonic acids (XXII) is illustrated in Scheme 9.<br>
49<br><br><br>
The UHP-complex (4) and a caiboxylic acid anhydride (XIX) or a sulfonic acid anhydride (XXI) are reacted in dichloromefhane or other suitable solvent at temperatures ranging from about -25 °C to about 100 °C to generate the anhydrous peroxyacids. The peroxyacids may be generated first and subsequently reacted with the ketocarbamate (XVIII). In some embodiments, a earboxylic acid anhydride is added to a stirred suspension or solution containing the UHP-complex and (XVIII) to generate the peroxycarboxylic acid, which reacts in situ with (XVIII) to give compound (I). In other embodiments, the molar ratio of UHP-complex and the acid anhydride is about 6:1.  In still other embodiments, the molar ratio of UHP complex and acid anhydride (XIX) is between aboutal and about ' other embodiments, the molar ratio of UHF-compiex and acid anhydride (XIX) is between about 2:1 and about 1:1.<br>
In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is between about 8:1 and about 1:1.  In other<br><br>
embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is between about 4:1 and about 1:1, In yet other embodiments, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is between about 2:1 and about 1:1, Preferably, when the oxidant is peroxytiifluoroacetic acid or another substituted peroxyacetic acid, the molar ratio of the peroxyacid oxidant to the compound of Formula (XVIII) is about 2:1.<br>
Further, the use of additives in the oxidation of a compound of Formula (XVIII) to a compound of Formula (I) is also contemplated. While not wishing to be bound by theory, additives may either catalyze the reaction or stabilize the final product or both. In some embodiments, a Lewis acid or a protic acid or any combination of Lewis acid or protic acid may be used in the oxidation of a compound of Formula (XVIII). (preferably, in the presence of a solvent). Lewis acids include, but are not limited to, BF3, Se02, MeReO3, MnO2, S11CI4, Sc(OTf)3, Ti(O-iPr)4, Al2O3 and Fe2O3. Protic acids include, but are not limited to, trifluoro acetic acid, acetic acid,/?-toluenesuIfonic acid, "methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the Lewis acid and/or protic acid may catalyze oxidation by increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group in Formula (XVIII).<br>
In other embodiments, the oxidation may be conducted in the presence of an anhydrous base.. While not wishing to be bound by theory,  he base may stabilize acid sensitive products by reacting with acidic by-products formed during oxidation.<br>
Generally, the temperature of the reaction may be readily optimized by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art- Preferably, the oxidation of a compound of Formula (XVIII) is carried out at a temperature between about -25 °C and about 100 °C (more preferably, between about 0 °C and about 25 °C).<br>
An advantageous feature of this method of synthesis of compounds of Formula (I) is that oxidation of ketocarbamate derivatives (XVIII) proceeds stereospecifically, with retention of configuration at the carbon atom initially adjacent to the carbonyl group in ketone (XVIII). This may be exploited in a stereoselective synthesis of prodrug derivatives. For example, thr chiel R--baclofen prodrug 4--{[(18)isobutaroylxlyethoxy] carborylamino (3R-chloroohenyl)-bucauocic  act a.<br>
(34) may be synthesized as a single diastereomer by stereoselective oxidation of 4-{[(lS)-isobutanoylethoxy}carbonylamino}-(3R)-(4-chlorophenyl)-butanoic acid<br><br>
(35) as described in Example 30 of Section 5 below. Acyloxyalkyl prodrugs of other baclofen analogs may be amenable to synthesis from the appropriate ketocarbamate derivatives via Baeyer-Vilhger type oxidation, provided that they do not contain chemical functionality susceptible to decomposition or other transformation under conditions of the reaction.<br>
Another method for synthesis of compounds of Formula (I), illustrated in Scheme 10, relies upon reaction of compounds of Formulae (IV) or (XI) with a l-(acyloxy)-alkyl N-hydroxysuccinirnidyl carbonate compound of Formula (XXIII), as described in the co-pending application Gallop et al., U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. ______ entitled "Methods for Synthesis of Acyloxyalkyl<br>

When the core is of a water-soiuble or water-swellable inert material, the sealcoat is preferably in the form of a relatively<br>
57<br><br>
thick layer of a water-insoluble polymer. Such a controlled release bead may thus comprise: (i) a core unit of a substantially water-soluble or water-swellable inert material; (ii) a first layer on the core unit of a substantially water-insoluble polymer; (iii) a second layer covering the first layer and containing an active ingredient; and (iv) a third layer on the second layer of polymer effective for controlled release of the active ingredient, wherein the first layer is adapted to control water penetration into<br>
the core.<br>
i Usually, the first layer (ii) above constitutes more than about 2% (w/w) of the final bead composition, preferably, more than about 3% (w/w)? e.g., from about 3% to about S0% (w/w). The amount of the second layer (ii) above usually constitutes from about 0.05% to about 60% (w/w), preferably from about 0.1 % to about 30% (w/w) of the final bead composition. The amount of the third layer (iv) above usually constitutes from about 1% to about 50% (w/w), preferably, from about 2% to about 25% (w/w) of the final bead composition. The core unit typically has.a size in the range of from about 0.05 to about 2 mm. The controlled release beads may be provided in a multiple unit formulation, such as.a capsule or a tablet.<br>
The cores are preferably of a water-soluble or swellable material and may be any such material that is conventionally used as cores or any other pharmaceuticatly acceptable water-soluble or water-swellable material made into beads or pellets. The cores may he spheres of materials such as sucrose/starch (Sugar Spheres NF), sucrose crystals, or extruded and dried spheres typically comprised of excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose and lactose.

The second layer containing the active ingredient may be comprised of the active ingredient with or without a polymer as a binder. The binder, when used, is usually hydrophilic but may be<br><br>
water-soluble or water-insoluble. Exemplary polymers that may be used in the second layer containing the active drug are hydrophilic polymers such as, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyalkylene glycol such as polyethylene glycol, gelatine, polyvinyl alcohol, starch and derivatives thereof, cellulose derivatives, such as hydroxypropylrnethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, acrylic acid polymers, polymethacrylates, or any other pharmaceutically acceptable polymer. The ratio of drug to hydrophilic polymer in the second layer is usually in the range of from 1:100 to 100:1 (w/w). Suitable polymers for use in the third layer, or membrane, for controlling the drug release may be selected from water-insoluble polymers or polymers with pH-dependent solubility, such as, for example, ethyl cellulose,     ' hydroxypropylrnethyl cellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, polymethacrylates, or mixtures;thereof, optionally combined with plasticizers, such as those mentioned d.bove  Optionally, the controlled release layer comprises, in addition to the polymers above, other substance(s) with different solubility characteristics, to adjust the permeability and thereby the release rate, of the controlled release layer.

In still other embodiments, the dosage form comprises an osmotic dosage form, which comprises a semipermeable wall that surrounds a therapeutic composition comprising the compound. In use within a patient, the osmotic dosage form comprising a homogenous composition, imbibes fluid through the semipermeable wall into the dosage form in response to the concentration gradient across the semipermeable wall. The therapeutic composition in the dosage form develops osmotic pressure differential that causes the therapeutic composition to be administered through an exit from the dosage four- over a prolonged period of time up to 24 hours (or even in some cases up to 30 hours) to provide controlled and sustained compound release. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations..<br>

compartment comprises the compound-containing composition atone or in layered<br>
position with an expandable hydrogel composition. The expandable hydrogel<br>
composition in the compartment increases in dimension by imbibing the fluid through<br>
the semipermeable wall, causing the hydrogel to expand and occupy space in the<br>
compartment, whereby the drug composition is pushed from the dosage form. The<br>
therapeutic layer and the expandable layer act together during the operation of the<br>
dosage form for the release of prodrug to a patient over time. The dosage form<br>
comprises a passageway in the wall that connects the exterior of the dosage form with<br>
the internal compartment. The osmotic powered dosage form can be made to deliver<br>
.prodrug from the dosage form to the patient at a zero order rate of release over a<br>
period of up to about 24 hours.	 <br>
The expression "passageway" as used herein comprises means and methods suitable for the metered release of the compound'from the compartment of the dosage-form. The exit means comprises at least one passageway, including orifice, bore, aperture, pore, porous element, hollow fiber, capillary tube, channel, porous overlay, or porous element that provides for the osmotic controlled release of compound. The passageway includes a material that erodes or is leached from the wall in a fluid environment of use to produce at least one controlled-release dimensioned passageway. Representative materials suitable for forming a passageway, or a multiplicity of passageways comprise a leachable poly(gJ'ycoiic) acid or poly(lactic) acid polymer in the wall, a gelatinous filament, polyvinyl alcohol), leach-able polysaccharides, salts, and oxides. A pore passageway, or more than one pore passageway, can be formed by leaching a leachable compound, such as sorbitol, from the wall. The passageway possesses controlled-reiease dimensions, such as round, triangular, square and elliptical, for the metered release of prodrug from the dosage form. The dosage form can be constructed with one or more passageways in spaced apart relationship on a single surface or on more than, one surface of the wall. The expression "fluid environment" denotes an aqueous or biological fluid as in a human patient, including the gastrointestinal tract. Passageways and equipment for forming passageways are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,S99; 4,063,064; 4,0S8,S64 and 4,816,263. Passageways formed by leaching are disclosed 'in U.S. Patents Nos- 4,200,098 and 4,2SS,9S7.<br>

The Cmax is less than 75%, and is preferably, less than 60%, of the Cmax obtained from administering an equivalent dose of the compound from an immediate release oral dosagfe form and the AUC is substantially the same as the AUC obtained from administering an equivalent dose of the prodrug from an immediate release oral dosage'form.<br>
',   Preferred dosage forms are administered once or twice per day, more preferably, once per day.<br>
4.6       Therapeutic Uses of Compounds, Compositions and Dosage Forms<br>
in some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) is administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering from stiffness, involuntary movements and/or pain associated with spasticity. The underlying etiology of the spasticity being so treated may have a multiplicity of origins, including, e.g., cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke and head and spinal cord injuries. In other embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) is administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering from gastro-esophageal reflux disease. In still other embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) is administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering from emesis. In still other embodiments; a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) is administered to a patient, preferably, a human, suffering from cough. In still other embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) is administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering from drug addiction. Addiction to stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines, or narcotics such as morphine or heroin may be effectively treated by administration of one or, more compounds of Formulae (I), (V)<br><br>
or (VI). In yet other embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) is administered to a patient, preferably a human, suffering from alcohol abuse or addiction and nicotine abuse or addiction. In some of the above embodiments, sustained release oral dosage forms are administered to the patients.<br>
Further, in certain embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) are administered to a patient, preferably a human, as a preventative measure against various diseases or disorders.. Thus, the therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) may be administered as a preventative measure to a patient having a predisposition for spasticity, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, emesis, cough, alcohol addiction or abuse, nicotine abuse or addiction or other drug addiction or abuse.<br>
When used to treat or prevent the above diseases or disorders the therapeutically effective amount of one of-more compounds of Formulae-(X), (V) or (VI) may be administered or applied '-singly, or in combination with other agents. The therapeutically effective amount of one or.'more compounds of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) may also deliver a compound disclosed herein in combination with another pharmaceutical^ active agent, including another compound disclosed herein. For example, in the treatment of a patient-suffering from gastro-esophageal'retlux disease, - a dosage form comprising a compound of Formulae (I), (V) or (VI) may be administered in conjunction with a proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole or rabeprazole sodium, or with an H2 antagonist such as rantidine, cimeti Jine or famotidine.<br>
Dosage forms, upon releasing the baclofen or baclofen analog prodrug, preferably provide baclofen or baclofen analogs upon in vivo administration to a patient.  While not wishing to bound by theory, the promoiety or promoieties of the prodrug may be cleaved either chemically and/or enzymatically. One or more enzymes presant in the stomach, intestinal lumen, intestinal tissue, blood, liver, brain or any other suitable tissue of a mammal may enzymatically cleave the promoiety or promoieties of the prodrug. If the promoiety or promoieties are cleaved after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, these baclofen or baclofen analog prodrugs may have the opportunity to be absorbed into the systemic circulation from the large intestine. It is prefen'ed that-.the promoiety or promoieties are cleaved after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract.<br><br>
Doses<br>
Baclofen and baclofen analog prodrugs are administered to treat or prevent diseases or disorders such as spasticity, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, emesis, cough, alcohol, nicotine or other drug addiction.<br>
The amount of baclofen or baclofen analog prodrug that will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition disclosed herein wiil depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques known in the art. In addition, in vitro of in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The amount of a compound administered will, of course, be dependent on, among other factors, the subject being treated, the weight of the subject, the severity of the affliction, the maimer of administration and the.judgment of the prescribing physician.<br>
Preferably, the dosage forms are adapted to be administered to a patient no more than twice per day, more preferably, only once per day. Dosing may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs and may continue as long as required for effective treatment of the disease state or disorder.<br>
Suitable dosageYanges for oral administration are dependent on the potency of the parent baclofen analog. For baclofen doses are generally between about 0.15 mg to about 2.5 mg per kilogram body weight. Other baclofen analogs may be more potent and lower doses may be appropriate for both the parent drug and any prodrug (measured on an equivalent molar basis). For example, doses of R-baciofen prodrugs that are equivalent (on a "molar basis) to R-baciofen doses of between about 0.03 mg to about 1 mg per kilogram body weight are appropriate. Dosage ranges may be readily determined by methods known to the skilled artisan.<br>

Example 85:  In Vitro Determination of Caco-2 Cellular Permeability of<br>
Prodrugs<br>
The trans-epithelial cellular permeability of prodrugs of baclofen and baclofen analogs may be assessed in vitro using standard methods well known in the art (see, e.g., Stewart, et al, Pharm. Res., 1995,12, 693). For example, cellular permeability may be evaluated by examining the flux of a prodrug across a cultured polarized cell monolayer {e.g., Caco-2 cells). Caco-2 cells obtained from continuous culture (passage less than 28) were seeded at high density onto Transwell polycarbonate filters. Cells were maintained with DMEM / 10% fetal calf serum + 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids + 2 mM L-Gln, 5% CO2 / 95% 02: 37°C until the day of the experiment. Permeability studies were conducted at pH 6.5 apically (in 50 mM MES buffer containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KC1, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM glucose) and pH 7.4 baso laterally (in Hanks' balanced sail solution containing 10 mM HEPES) in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors (250 uM MK-571, 250 pM Verapamil, 1 mM Ofloxacin). Inserts were placed in 12 or 24 well plates containing buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37C°. Prodrug (200 u.M) was added to the apical or.basolateral compartment (donor) and concentrations of prodrug and/or released parent drug in the opposite compartment, (receiver) were determined at intervals over 1 hour using LC/MS/MS. Values of apparent permeability (Papp) were calculated using the equation:<br>
PaPp--=VT(dCydt)//(ACo)<br>
Here VT is the volume of the receiver compartment in mL; dC/dt is the total flux of prodrug and parent drug (pM/s), determined from the slope of the plot of concentration in the receiver compartment versus time; C0 is the initial concentration of prodrug in µM; A. is the surface area of the membrane 111 cm". Preferably, prodrugs with significant transcellular permeability demonstrate a value of Papp of &gt;1 x 10"6 cm/s and more preferably, a value of Papp of &gt;1 x 10"5 cm/s. and still more preferably a value of Pnpp of &gt;5 x 10° cm/s. Typical values of P5PP obtained for baclofen prodrugs are shown in the following table:<br><br><br>
The data in this table shows that several of the prodrugs disclosed herein have high cellular permeability and should be well absorbed from the intestine. With the exception of compound (10), the apical-to-basolateial permeabilities of these prodrugs significantly exceed their basolateral-to-apical permeabilities, suggesting that these compounds may be substrates for active transport mechanisms present in the apical membrane of Caco cells (though some component of this transcellular permeability may also be mediated by passive diffusion).<br>
Example 86:   Uptake of R-Baclofen Following Administration of R-Baclofen or R-Baclofen Prodrugs Intracolonocally in Rats<br>
Sustained release oral dosage forms, which release drug slowly over periods of 6-24 hours, generally release a significant proportion of the dose within the colon. Thus, drugs suitable for use in such dosage forms preferably exhibit good colonic absorption.   This experiment was conducted to assess the suitability of baclofen prodrugs for use in an oral sustained release dosage form.<br><br>
Step A: Administration Protocol<br>
Rats were obtained commercially and were pre-cannulated in the both the ascending colon and the jugular vein. Animals were conscious at the time of the experiment. All animals were fasted overnight and until 4 hours post-dosing. R-Baclofen or baclofen prodrugs (10), (12), (23), (25), (27), (32), (33), (40), (51), (92), (100) and (104) were administered as a solution (in water or PEG 400) directly into the colon via the cannula at a dose equivalent to 10 nig of baclofen equivalents per kg body weight. Blood samples (0.5 mL) were obtained from the jugular cannula at intervals over 8 hours and were quenched immediately by addition of methanol to prevent further conversion of the prodrug. Blood samples were analyzed as described below.<br>
Step B: Sample preparation for colonic absorbed drug<br>
1.	Rat blood was collected at different time points and 100 pL of blood was added into an eppendorf tube containing 300 ixL of methanol and vortexed to xnn: immediately.<br>
2.	20.pL of µ-chlorophenylalanine was added-as an internal standard.<br>
3.	300 pL of methanol was added ink) each tube followed by 20 uL of µ-chIorophenylalamne. 90 pL of blank rat blood was added to each tube and mix. Then 10 µL of a baclofen standard solution (0.04, 0.2, 1, 5, 25,100 pg/mL) was added to make up a final calibration standard (0.004. 0.02, 0.1,. 0.5,2.5, 10 pg/mL).<br>
4.	Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min.<br>
5.	Supernatant was taken for LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
Step C: LC/MS/MS analysis An:API 2000 LC/MS/MS spectrometer equipped with Shidmadzu lOADVp binary pumps and a CTC HTS-PAL autosampler were used in the analysis. A Phenomenex hydro-RP 4.6 x 50 mm column was used during the analysis. The  mobile phase was water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). The gradient condition was: 10% B for 0.5 min, then to 95% B in 2.5 min, then maintained at 95%  B for 1.5 min. The mobile phase was returned to 10%B for 2<br><br>
min. A TurboIonSpray source was used on the API 2000. The analysis was done in positive ion mode and an MRM transition of m/z 214/151 was used in the analysis of baclofen (MRM transitions m/z 330/240 for (10), m/z 392/240 for (12), m/z 372/240 for (23), m/z 400/240 for (25), m/z 400/240 for (27), m/z 372/240 for (32), m/z 372/240 for (33), 406/240 for (40), 454/61 for (51), 400/240 for (92), 400/240 for (100) and 400/240 for (3 04) were used). 10 pL of the samples were injected. The peaks were integrated using Analyst 1.2 quantitation software. Following colonic administration of prodrugs (12), (23), (25), (27), (32), (33), (40), (51), (92), (100) and (104) the maximum plasma concentrations of R-baclofen (Cmax), as well as the area under the baclofen plasma concentration vs. time curves (AT JC) were significantly greater (&gt; 2-fold) than that produced from colonic administration of R-baclofen itself. This data demonstrates that these compounds may be formulated as compositions suitable for enhanced absorption and/or effective sustained release of baclofen analogs to minimize dosing frequency due to rapid systemic clearance of these baclofen analogs.<br>
Example 87:  Pharmacokinetics of R-Baclofen Following Intravenous Administration to Cvnomolgus Monkeys<br>
R-Baclofen hydrochloride salt was administered to four male cynomolgus monkeys as an aqueous solution by intravenous bolus injection into the saphenous vein at a dose of \ .2 nig/kg. Blood samples were obtained from all animals at intervals over 24 hours post-dosing. Blood was processed immediately for plasma at 4°C. All plasma samples were subsequently analyzed for R-btclofen using the LC/MS/MS assay described above. The mean R-baclofen exposure AUCnr= 3.6 h.µg/mL.<br>
Example SS:   Uptake of R-Baclofen Following Administration of R-Badofen or R-Baclofen Prodrugs fniracolonically its Cynomolgus Monkeys<br>
R-Baclofen hydrochloride salt and R-baclofen prodrugs (5 mg baclofen-eq /kg) were administered to groups of four male cynomolgus monkeys as either aqueous solutions or suspensions in 0.5% methyl cellulose / 0.1% Tween- SO via bolus injection directly into the colon via an indwelling cannula. For colonic delivery a flexible French catheter was inserted into the rectum of each monkey and extended to<br><br>
the proximal colon (approx. 16 inches) using fluoroscopy. Monkeys were lightly sedated by administration of Telazol/ketamine during dosing.   A washout period of at least 5 to 7 days was allowed between treatments. Following dosing, blood samples were obtained at intervals over 24 hours and were immediately quenched and processed for plasma at 4bC. All plasma samples were subsequently analyzed for R-bac/ofen and intact prodrug using the LC/MS/MS assay described above. Following colonic administration of prodrugs (12), (22), (25), (40) and (53), the maximum plasma concentrations of baclofen (Cmax), as well as the area under the baclofen plasma concentration vs. time curves (AUC) were significantly greater (&gt; 2-fold) than that produced from colonic administration of R-baclofen itself, while colonic administration of (92), (100) and (104) produced R-baclofen exposures that were greater than 10-fold that produced from colonic administration of R-baclofen itself This diita demonstrates that these compounds may be formulated as compositions suih-ble for enhanced absorption and/or effective sustained release of baclofen analogs to minimize dosing frequency due to rapid systemic clearance of these baclofen ana]ogs.<br>
-Example 89:   Uptake of R-Baclofea Following Oral Administration of R-Badofen Prodrugs to Cynomolgus Monkeys<br>
The R-baclofen prodrugs (92) and (104) (5 mg baclofen-eq /kg) were administered fry oral gavage to groups of four male cynomolgus monkeys as either an aqueous solution or suspension in 0.5% methyl cellulose) 0.1%Tween-80 respectively. Following dosing, blood samples were obtained at intervals over 24 hours and were immediately quenched and processed for plasma at 4nC. All plasma samples were subsequently analyzed for R-baciofen and intact prodrug using the LC/MS/MS assay described above. The orai bioavailability of both prodrugs (92) and (104) as R-baclofen was determined to be greater than 80%.<br>
