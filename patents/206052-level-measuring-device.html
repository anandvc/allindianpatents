COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
LEVEL MEASURING DEVICE<br>
ENDRESS+HAUSER GMBH+CO. KG of HAUPTSTRASSE 1, 79689 MAULBU...., GERMANY a GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is<br><br><br>
ievel-measuring device<br>
 The invention relates to a level-measuring device for determining the level of a<br>
medium in a container.<br>
Known level-measuring devices use for this purpose a transit time method, for example a TDR method with guided pulses, or another pulse echo method by means of radiation in the direction of the medium. In this method, a pulse-shaped electromagnetic signal is used which propagate at the velocity of light. The medium surface represents an irregularity for the propagation of this signal and the signal is thus reflected to the transmitter. To be able to determine the transit time of the reflected transmit signal, a time measurement must be performed in the nanosecond range. Since, as a rule, electronic circuits operate too slowly for a direct transit time measurement in this case, the echo signal variation must be transformed into an extended time scale in a suitable manner. For this purpose, a pulse is periodically sent out from which a signal sample is taken by a sampling circuit at a position which progresses from pulse to pulse.<br>
After a measuring cycle, which can consist of several thousand individual periods, has elapsed, a rime-transformed signal variation is obtained which represents the total transit path of the signal. From this, the distance between medium surface and level-measuring device can be determined, which is a measure of the level. Industrially used measuring ranges extend from a few 10 cm up into ranges of over 50m.<br>
Known level-measuring devices of this type comprise a signal generating device for generating both a radio-frequency transmit signal and a sampling control signal for sampling the radio-frequency signal, a transmitting and/or receiving device and a sampling device, controlled by the sampling control signal, for sampling the radio-frequency signal, the signal generating device, the transmitting and/or receiving device and the sampling device being connected by a coupling device. To be meet the requirements of device, controlled by the sampling control signal, for sampling<br><br>
the radio-frequency signal, the signal generating device, the transmitting and/or receiving device and the sampling device being connected by a coupling device. To be able to meet the requirements of the various measuring ranges, signal generator devices and sampling circuits have been varied in previous measuring devices. However, this results in unwanted losses in the connection between signal generating device and transmitting and/or receiving device and between transmitting and/or receiving device and sampling device.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to avoid the abovementioned disadvantages and, in particular, to create level-measuring devices in which signal generator devices and sampling devices and transmitting and/ or receiving devices are optimally connected to one another.<br>
This object is achieved by a first variant of the invention in which the level-measuring device exhibits a signal generating device for generating both a radio-frequency transmit signal and a sampling control signal for sampling the radio-frequency signal, a transmitting and/or receiving device and a sampling device, controlled by the sampling control signal, for sampling the radio-frequency signal, the signal generating device, the transmitting and/or receiving device and the sampling device being connected by a coupling device which comprises a transformer.<br>
This object is also achieved by a second variant of the invention in which the level-measuring device exhibits a signal generating device for generating both a radio-frequency transmit signal and a sampling control signal for sampling the radio-frequency signal, a, transmitting and/or receiving device and a sampling device, controlled by the sampling control signal, for sampling the radio-frequency signal, the signal generating device, the transmitting and/or receiving device and the sampling device being connected by a coupling device which comprises at least one line node.<br><br>
This object is also achieved by a third variant of the invention in which the level-measuring device exhibits a signal generating device for generating both a radio-frequency transmit signal and a sampling control signal for sampling the radio-frequency signal, a transmitting and/or receiving device and a sampling device, controlled by the sampling control signal, for sampling the radio-frequency signal, the signal generating device, the transmitting and/or receiving device and the sampling device being connected by a coupling device which comprises a A/4 coupler.<br>
In addition, this object is achieved by a fourth variant of the invention in which the level-measuring device exhibits a signal generating device for generating both a radio-frequency transmit signal and a sampling control signal for sampling the radio-frequency signal, a transmitting and/or receiving device and a sampling device, controlled by the sampling control signal, for sampling the radio-frequency signal, the signal genera ting device, the transmitting and/or receiving device and the sampling device being connected by a coupling device which comprises a circulator.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the third variant of the level-measuring device according to the invention relate to those with A/4 couplers which are Wilkinson couplers, Lange couplers, directional couplers, line couplers or, for example, coaxial couplers.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the invention, the signal generating device comprises a comparator circuit/ a beat oscillator circuit or a regulated delay circuit which are used for delaying the sampling signal with respect to the radio-frequency transmit signal.<br>
Other preferred embodiments of the invention relate to level-measuring devices with sampling devices which comprise a diode ring circuit or at least one diode and one holding capacitor or a mixer circuit.<br><br>
In yet other preferred embodiments of the invention, the radio-frequency transmit signal is a burst signal.<br>
The invention enables transmitting and receiving characteristics of the level-measuring device to be matched to one another in a simple manner for different signals and/or measuring ranges by optimizing one of its components.<br>
In addition, the invention uses a simple and rugged DC decoupling of the transmitting and/or receiving device from the rest of the measuring device so that the level-measuring device according to the invention is particularly suitable for uses in hazardous areas or applications.<br>

Figure la shows a level-measuring device 1 which is mounted on or at a container 2 and which is used for measuring the level of a medium 3 contained therein. As shown in figure la, the level-measuring device 1 generates a transmit signal 51 and sends it out in the direction of the medium 3. For this purpose, the transmit signal 51 is conducted to a waveguide 5 immersed in the medium 3 and reflected from a medium surface 4. The reflected signal 52 is conducted to the level-measuring device 1 where an information item on the distance between level-measuring device 1 and medium surface 4 is obtained which is necessary for the level to be determined. Figure la also illustrates a possible signal shape of the transmit signal and reflected signal 51 and 52, respectively.<br>
Figure lb shows the level-measuring device 1 in which, however/ in contrast to figure la, the transmit signal 51 used for measuring the level is not conducted but sent out in the direction of the medium 3 by means of an antenna 6. The antenna 6 is also used for receiving the signal 52 reflected from the medium surface 4. The waveguide 5 and the antenna 6 in each case represent a transmitting and/or receiving device 20 (see also figure 2 in this respect) of the level-measuring device 1. In the text which follows, the term transmitting and/or receiving device 20 is used whenever either a waveguide 5 or an antenna 6 can be used.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a configuration of a level-measuring device 1 in diagrammatic representation which essentially comprises a signal generating device 10, transmitting and/or receiving device   20,   a   sampling device 30 and a coupling<br><br>
device 40. The coupling device 40 connects the signal generating device 10 to the transmitting and/or receiving device 20 and the latter to the sampling device 30.<br>
A radio-frequency signal 53 generated in the signal generating device 10 is applied as transmit signal 55 via the coupling device 40 to the transmitting and/or receiving device 20 and sent from there to the medium 3 (see figures la, b). The reflected signal 52 (see figures la, b) is received by the transmitting and/or receiving device 20 and transferred to the sampling device 30 via the coupling device 40.<br>
A sampling control signal 54 generated by the signal generating device 10 controls the sampling of the reflected signal 52 received from the transmitting and/or receiving device 20. An extended-time receive signal 57 obtained at the output of the sampling device 30 is preferably amplified in an amplifier 50 for better processing.<br>
Figure 3 shows in a diagrammatic representation a first variant 100 of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention. In this case, the coupling device 40 comprises according to the invention a transformer 110. The transformer 110 exhibits a transmit-winding 112, a receive winding 114 and a windiiig for coupling in the transmitting and/or receiving device 116 and is wired in the manner shown in figure 3. A DC decoupling 118, achieved by the transformer 110, of the transmitting section from the receiving section of the level-measuring device 1 allows it to be used even in hazardous environments. A terminating resistor 120 is used for matching the coupling device 40 with the transformer 110 to the signal generating device, the transmitting and/or receiving device 20 and the sampling device 30.<br>
Figure 4 shows a second variant 200 of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention. In this case, the coupling device 40 comprises according to the invention at least one line node 210. The line node 210 is preferably connected to three coupling resistors 212, 214 and 216 in the manner shown in figure 4. The coupling resistors 212, 214 and 216 can also be complex impedances, e.g. capacitors, so that a DC decoupling can be achieved again in this manner, as in the first variant of the invention  100  (see  in  this context figure 3). It is also conceivable to make<br><br>
the coupling resistors 212, 214 and 216 mixed-complex or even tending toward zero. In the latter case, no further wiring would then be necessary apart from the node 210. Such an embodiment is possible if the signal generating device 10, the transmitting and/or receiving device 20 and the sampling device 30 are matched to one another by a suitable choice of source arid load impedances.<br>
Another and particular embodiment of the coupling device 40 according to the invention and according to figure 4 a is shown diagrammatically in figure 4b. In this case, the coupling resistors 212, 214 and 216 are connected together to form a coupling bridge 220.<br>
Figures 5a to 5e show preferred embodiments of a third variant 300 of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention, in which the coupling device 40 in each case comprises a A/4 coupler. The embodiment shown in figure 5a is a so-called Wilkinson coupler 320 which is wired in the manner shown there and with a terminating resistor 322. Figure 5b shows a coupling device 40 which comprises a so-called Lange coupler 330 which is wired in the manner shown there and with a terminating resistor 332. Figure 5c shows a coupling device 40 which comprises a directional coupler 340 which is wired in the manner shown there and with a terminating resistor 342. Figure 5d shows a further coupling device 40 which comprises a line coupler 350 which is wired in the manner shown there and with a terminating resistor 352.<br>
The A/4 couplers shown in figures 5a to d can be implemented in a simple manner, and thus inexpensively, as passive structures on conventional circuit boards. Such coupling devices 40 with A/4 couplers are particularly suitable for burst signals and high frequencies, as are used, for example, for highly accurate measurement at short distances.<br>
Figure 5e shows yet another A/4 coupler which comprises a coaxial line coupler 360 with inner conductor 364 and shield conductor 362 and which is wired in the manner shown there and with a terminating resistor 366. Because of its structure,<br><br>
such a coupling device 40 with a coaxial line coupler 360 is particularly suitable for burst signals of lower frequencies, for example less than 1 GHz, and thus for applications for determining large distances.<br>
Figure 6 shows a fourth variant 400 of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention. In this case, the coupling device 40 comprises a circulator 410 according to the invention. Similarly to the coupling devices shown in figures 5a to 5b, such a coupling device 40 is also based on resonant A/4 structures and can be designed in a similar narrow-band manner.<br>
Figures 7b to 7d show various embodiments of signal generating devices 10, as are used with each of the variants of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention previously shown in figures 3 to 6.<br>
Figure 7a is used for explaining the operation of the signal generating device 10. As already mentioned above, the signal generating device 10 generates the periodic radio-frequency transmit signal 53 and the sampling control signal 54 which is synchronous with the former. The delay time of the sampling control signal 54 can be controlled in a defined manner and the signal is supplied to the sampling device 30. A time difference At between the radio-frequency transmit signal 53 and sampling control signal 54 is a direct measure of the distance point measured at the respective time between level-measuring device 1 and medium surface 4 (see figure 1) and is linked together by the velocity of light. Various signal generating devices 10 are shown which differ in linearity, drift and accuracy and thus have a different influence on this distance measuring result.<br>
The signal generating device 10 shown in figure 7b comprises a comparator 150 and a first RC combination 151 and a second RC combination. The RC sections 151, 152, the time constants of which are different/ are connected to the fast voltage comparator 150. The faster' RC section 151 is periodically charged and discharged by a rectangular signal generated in a transmit clock oscillator 153. The slower RC section   152 is charged and discharged once with each measuring<br><br>
cycle, the measuring cycle being determined by a signal supplied by a measuring cycle start circuit 154.<br>
Depending on the resolution and distance for the level measurement to be measured, a measuring cycle consists of a few 10 000 transmit clock. Due to the fact that the charging voltage across RC" section 152 rises very slowly, each new transmit clock results in a different switching threshold at the comparator 150 for the charging voltage across RC section 151. Thus, the sampling clock is delayed by a constant time increment with respect to the transmit clock with each tiansmit cycle. Although the RC sections 151, 152 are charged and discharged in accordance with an e function, the resultant time increments follow a linear function so that the distance sampling increments can also be shown linearly. The time-base extension factor is obtained directly from the ratio between the time constants of the two RC sections 151,152.<br>
To obtain the radio-frequency transmit signal 53, the output signal of the oscillator 153 is subjected to reshaping in a transmit signal shaper stage 157. In this transmit signal shaper stage 157, radio-frequency transmit signals 53 are shaped as burst or pulse signals depending on the desired application. Similarly, the output signal of the comparator 150 is subject to pulse shaping in the sampling signal shaper stage 158 to generate the sampling signal 54 in accordance with the signal shape of the radio-frequency transmit signal 53, burst or pulse.<br>
The signal generating device 10 with the comparator 150, as shown in figure 7b, is simple to construct, is sufficiently accurate for simple applications and very inexpensive.<br>
Figure 7c shows a further embodiment of the signal generating device 10 which comprises a beat oscillator circuit 160 in this case.<br>
A fixed frequency oscillator 161 provides the tiansmit clock, similarly to the transmit clock oscillator 153 (see   figure 7b).   An   adjustable   oscillator   162,   the operating<br><br>
frequency of which differs only slightly from that of the fixed-frequency oscillator 161, generates a sampling control signal. Due to the small frequency difference, the oscillator 162 lags more by a small time increment At with each frequency period of the fixed-frequency oscillator 161. To generate the time increment in a defined manner, the frequency of the oscillator 162 is regulated via the beat frequency produced by mixing at a beat detector 164. For this purpose, an adjusting circuit 163 is used which generates a control signal to the adjustable oscillator 162 from the output signal of the beat detector 164.<br>
The time-base extension factor is obtained from the frequency of the fixed-frequency oscillator 161 and the beat frequency of the beat detector 164. If the circuit shown in figure 7c is constructed with quarz oscillators, it is distinguished by special stability and accuracy. Similarly to the embodiment shown in figure 7b, the desired burst or pulse signal shape of the sampling signal 54 or of the radio-frequency transmit signal 53, respectively, can be obtained by pulse shaper stages 166 and 165/ respectively.<br>
Figure 7d shows another embodiment of the signal generating device 10 which contains a regulated delay circuit 170 in this case. An RC section 171 consisting of two resistors and one capacitor is driven on the one hand by a fixed-frequency oscillator 172 which predetermines the transmit clock and on the other hand indirectly by a sawtooth generator 173, the sawtooth voltage Us of which is a measure of the distance point to be measured.<br>
Since the voltage-time behavior of the RC section 171 is an e function, linearization is achieved via a feedback loop 174 which feeds in a correction signal via the subtracter 175. In combination with the subsequent integrator 176, there is a closed control loop so that the time increments are directly proportional to the sawtooth voltage steps. Similarly to figures 7c and 7e, the desired burst or pulse signal shape of the sampling signal 54, or of the radio-frequency transmit signal 53, respectively, can be obtained by pulse shaper stages 178 and 177, respectively.     The     good     accuracy    with    comparatively favorable costs was<br><br>
advantageous in this embodiment of the signal generating device 170. In addition, direct driving is possible with the aid of a D/A converter.<br>
Figures 8a to 8d show various embodiments of sampling devices, as can be used with each of the variants of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention, previously shown in figures 3 to 6.<br>
As shown in figure 2, the sampling device 30 is used for converting the reflected radio-frequency receive signal 56 supplied by the coupler device 40 into an extended-time receive signal 57. This sampling process is performed once in each transmit clock period. The time of sampling is predetermined by the sampling control signal 54 of the signal generating device 10.<br>
The diagrammatic representation of a sampling device in figure 8 a shows a switching element 510 and a charging capacitor 511 at the output of the switching element.<br>
This sampling device is also generally known by the term sample &amp; hold circuit. To sample fast signals, the switching element 510 is replaced by a fast switching diode 512 as shown in figure 8b. The arrangement in figure 8b serves as an example, it is also possible to interchange capacitor and switching diode.<br>
In figure 8c, a diode bridge 513, which contains four fast switching diodes 514a to 514d in the configuration shown, is shown instead of a switching element. In contrast to the illustrative embodiment in figure 8b, this diode bridge is driven by complementary signals which are generated by the pulse inverter 515. The input control signal of the pulse inverter is supplied by the sampling control signal 54 of the signal generating device 10. The reflected radio-frequency signal 56, see also figure 2, of the coupling device 40 is connected to one input of the diode bridge 513. The extended-time receive signal 57 of this sampling device is available across the charging capacitor 519.<br><br>
The sampling devices hitherto described in figures 8a to 8c are particularly suitable for sampling pulse signals. For sampling burst signals, in contrast, an arrangement according to figure 8d is advantageous. In this arrangement, a symmetric mixer circuit 516 is used which consists of a ring hybrid 518 and two mixer diodes 517. The operation of this mixer circuit is described in the text which follows by means of a diagrammatic representation of a complete level-measuring device in figure 9.<br>
Figure 9 shows a signal generating device 10 of a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention comprising a beat generator circuit 160 according to figure 7c which is connected to a coupling device 40 constructed as Lange coupler 330 (see figure 5b) and to a sampling device 30 according to figure 8d. In this example, the pulse shaper stages at the output of the beat generator circuit 160 generate burst signals which require a mixer circuit for extending the time base of the reflected receive signal 56. As such, the arrangement according to figure 8d has been found to be advantageous because of its relatively simple structure in conjunction with a possible planar embodiment.<br>
Figure 10 shows a level-measuring device 1 according to the invention which is particularly suitable for pulse signals. In this case, the signal generating device 10 comprises a regulated delay circuit 170 according to figure 7d which is connected to a coupling device 40, which is constructed as transformer 110 (see figure 3) and to a sampling device 30 according to figure 8c. The pulse shaper stages at the output of the signal generating device 10 generate pulse signals in this example. To extend the time base of the reflected receive signal 56, a sampling device 30 with a diode ring 513 from figure 8c is provided. The entire arrangement provides for an inexpensive and similarly accurate level-measuring device.<br><br>
