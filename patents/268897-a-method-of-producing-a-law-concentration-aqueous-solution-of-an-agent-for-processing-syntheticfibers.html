				<td>LOW CONCENTRATION AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF AN AGENT FOR<br>
PROCESSING SYNTHETIC FIBERS, METHOD OF PRODUCING SAME AND<br>
METHOD OF PROCESSING SYNTHETIC FIBERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a low concentration aqueous solution of an agent for processing synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature and which is stable over a long period of time such that the agent can be attached to synthetic fibers as desired for a long time, a method of producing such a solution and a method of processing synthetic fibers by using such an agent.<br>
At spinning and fabrication factories of synthetic fibers, agents for processing synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate, and normally potassium alkyl phosphate having an alkyl group with 12-22 carbons atoms, are frequently applied to synthetic fibers. Generally, such an agent is produced as a high concentration aqueous solution or a paste with concentration of about 2 0-60 weight % at a chemical factory different and apart from the production or fabrication factories of synthetic fibers, and a low concentration aqueous solution of about 0.1-10 weight % is prepared after it is transported to a spinning or fabrication factory to be applied to synthetic fibers, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai 2002-20971.<br>
It is usually several months to a half year from when such a high concentration aqueous solution or a paste of agent for processing synthetic fibers is produced until it comes to be actually used after being stored and transported. Since 40-80 weight % of such a high concentration aqueous solution or paste is water, it means that a large portion of the cost of their storage and transportation is for water. Because of their high water content, furthermore, high concentration aqueous solutions and pastes of such an agent tend to become degraded while in storage or being transported, and floating substances and sediments are frequently generated in low concentration aqueous<br>
solutions prepared therefrom. Even if such a low concentration aqueous solution is applied to synthetic fibers, it is not always possible to provide the synthetic fibers with desired characteristics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a method of producing a low concentration aqueous solution of an agent for processing synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate, and such a solution that can be produced inexpensively as an agent to be attached to synthetic fibers at spinning and fabrication factories and has improved stability without generating floating substances or sediments. It is also an object of this invention to provide a low concentration aqueous solution produced by such a method and a method of processing synthetic fibers by using such an agent.<br>
The inventors herein have discovered, as a result of their studies in view of these objects, that an appropriate method to obtain a low concentration aqueous solution for processing synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature is to gradually add with stirring an acidic alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature to an aqueous solution containing potassium hydroxide in an amount to partially neutralize this acidic alkyl phosphate so as to obtain a 0.1-10 weight % low concentration aqueous solution of the agent for processing synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of producing a low concentration aqueous solution for processing synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperatures by gradually adding with stirring an acidic alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature to an aqueous solution containing potassium hydroxide in an amount to partially neutralize this acidic alkyl phosphate so as to obtain a 0.1-10 weight % low concentration aqueous solution of the agent for processing<br>
synthetic fibers containing potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature.<br>
This invention also relates to a low concentration aqueous solution of an agent for processing synthetic fibers produced by such a method.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of processing synthetic fibers by attaching such a solution according to this invention to synthetic fibers at a rate of 0.1-1 weight % with respect to the synthetic fibers.<br>
A method of this invention for producing a low concentration aqueous solution of an agent for processing synthetic fibers (hereinafter "the production method of this invention") is explained first. According to this invention, such a low concentration (0.1-10 weight %) aqueous solution of an agent for processing synthetic fibers is obtained by gradually adding an acidic alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature with stirring to an aqueous solution containing potassium hydroxide in an amount to partially neutralize this acidic alkyl phosphate.<br>
The acidic alkyl phosphate to be partially neutralized according to this invention is solid at room temperature. For this purpose, those acidic alkyl phosphates having an alkyl group with 12-22 carbon atoms are usually used but those having an alkyl group with 16-18 carbon atoms are preferred. Examples of such acidic alkyl phosphates include acidic dodecyl phosphate, acidic tridecyl phosphate, acidic tetradecyl phosphate, acidic pentadecyl phosphate, acidic hexadecyl phosphate, acidic heptadecyl phosphate, acidic octadecyl phosphate, acidic nonadecyl phosphate, acidic eicosyl phosphate and acidic docosyl phosphate. These acidic alkyl phosphates include individual monoesters, individual diesters and mixtures of monoesters and diesters, and diesters include both those having the same alkyl group (symmetric diesters) and those having different alkyl groups (non-symmetric diesters). These acidic alkyl phosphates can be synthesized by any known prior art methods, such as by a phosphation reaction between phosphoric anhydride and a saturated aliphatic alcohol with 12-22 carbon atoms.<br>
Acidic alkyl phosphates with an acid value of 100-300 are preferred and those with an acid value of 160-210 are even more preferred for the partial neutralization according to the method of this invention. Those with a phosphation ratio of 0.6-1 are<br>
preferred and those with a phosphation ratio of 0.65-0.90 are even more preferred. In the above, the phosphation ratio is the calculated value showing how many moles of phosphorus are combined per one mole of the aliphatic alcohol that has been used.<br>
The invention does not impose any particular limitation as to the form of the acidic alkyl phosphate to be used for the partial neutralization, but it is preferred to be in the form of flakes or powders, and it is particularly preferred to be in the form of flakes with a thickness of 0.5-1.5mm or powders with a particle diameter of less than 0.7mm.<br>
As for the amount of potassium hydroxide that is used for partially neutralizing the acidic alkyl phosphate in solid form at room temperature, it is preferred that 70-99% of the acid value of the acidic alkyl phosphate is neutralized and more preferred that 70-95% of the acid value of the acidic alkyl phosphate is neutralized.<br>
As explained above, the acidic alkyl phosphate in solid form at room temperature is added to an aqueous solution containing potassium hydroxide in an amount to partially neutralize the acidic alkyl phosphate gradually with stirring so as to generate potassium alkyl phosphate in solid form at room temperature and a low concentration (0.1-10 weight %) aqueous solution of agent for processing synthetic fibers containing it.

In these Methods (l)-(7), Component A and/or B may be added directly or by initially preparing an aqueous solution. When Component A and/or B is added, it is preferable to heat the aqueous solution to 30-90°C and to cool it to 15-25°C immediately after the addition. If necessary, components other than Component A and/or B such as an anti-oxidant, a preservative and/or an anti-rusting component may be added in addition to Component A and/or B.<br>
Next, the low concentration aqueous solution of this invention is explained in more detail. The low concentration (0.1-10 weight %) aqueous solution of this invention is what is obtained by a method of this method as explained above and hence is a low concentration (0.1-10 weight %) aqueous solution for synthetic fibers containing an agent for processing synthetic fibers comprising potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature and which may additionally contain Component A and/or B as described above.<br>
In the low concentration aqueous solution according to this invention, the concentration of the agent for processing synthetic fibers is 0.1-10 weight %. Agents for processing synthetic fibers containing 20-100 weight parts of potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature and a total of 0-80 weight parts of Component A and/or B per 100 weight parts are preferred. Those containing 55-85 weight parts of potassium alkyl phosphate which is solid at room temperature and a total of 15-45 weight parts of Component A and/or B per 100 weight parts are particularly preferred.<br>
The method of treating synthetic fibers according to this invention is characterized by causing a low concentration aqueous solution of this invention described above to become adhesively attached to the synthetic fibers. This may be carried out during any of the spinning and fabrication steps for synthetic fibers such as the spinning, drawing, or crimping steps but it is preferable to be done before or after the spinning step or the crimping step. The method of application may be by dipping, by<br>
spraying, by using rollers or by a guide oiling method by means of a measuring pump, but methods by dipping and spraying are preferred. The amount to be attached is preferably 0.1-1 weight % and more preferably 0.1-0.5 weight %.<br>

With a method according to this invention, a low concentration aqueous solution of an agent comprising potassium alkyl phosphate for processing synthetic fibers by causing it to become attached to synthetic fibers at the spinning or processing factories can be produced inexpensively, and as a product with improved stability which does not generate floating objects or sediments for an extended period of time. Thus, synthetic fibers can be provided with desired characteristics if such a low concentration aqueous solution according to this invention produced by such a method is attached to them.<br>

Part 3 (Evaluation of low concentration aqueous solutions of agent for treatment of synthetic fibers')<br>
Stability of the low concentration aqueous solutions ((P-l)-(P-28) and (r-l)-(r-6)) of agent for treatment of synthetic fibers prepared in Part 2 was evaluated by the following three evaluation methods. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br>
Evaluation method 1<br>
After each low concentration aqueous solution was left for 7 days at 50°C, it was visually inspected. It was also diluted to concentration of 1% with ion exchange water and adjusted to 25°C and its transmissivity was measured at 750nm by means of a spectrophotometer (Ultraviolet-visible spectrometer U-2000 produced by Hitachi, Ltd.)<br>
The results were evaluated as follows:<br>
A:       Stable with no difference from the time of preparation<br>
B:       Stable with no difference from the time of preparation but there is a drop in transmissivity by less than 5%<br>
C:       Generation of small amounts of sediments and floating objects and there is a drop in transmissivity by 5-20%<br>
D:       Clear generation of sediments and floating objects and there is a drop in transmissivity by greater than 20%.<br>
Evaluation method 2<br>
After each low concentration aqueous solution was left for 12 hours at 20°C and further for 12 hours at 70°C and was subjected to this routine repeatedly for a total of 120 hours, its stability was evaluated as done by Evaluation method 1.<br>
Evaluation method 3<br>
After each low concentration aqueous solution was stirred in a homomixer at 2000rpm for 5 days at 50°C, its stability was evaluated as done by Evaluation method 1.<br>
Part 4 (Attachment to polyester staple fibers and its evaluation)<br>
Attachment to polyester staple fibers<br>
The low concentration aqueous solutions ((P-l)-(P-28) and (r-l)-(r-6)) obtained in Part 2 were left for 7 days at 50°C and were each applied by spraying to semi-dull polyester staple fibers with fineness 1.3x10-4g/m (1.2 denier) and length 38mm obtained during the draft making process such that the attached amount would be as shown in Table 3. After it was dried for two hours by a hot air drier at 80°C, humidity was adjusted overnight under the condition of 30°C x 70%RH to obtain processed polyester staple fibers with a processing agent attached thereto. In Table 3, "Attached Amount" indicates the amount of each agent attached to polyester stable fibers.<br>
Evaluation of web uniformity during carding process<br>
The processed polyester staple fibers (10kg) obtained as described above were subjected to a flat type card engine (product of Howa Machinery, Ltd.) under the condition of 30°C x 70%RH and passed at the delivery speed of MOm/minute. Uniformity of the delivered carding web was evaluated as follows:<br>
A:       No specks at all and uniform<br>
B:       A few specks but no problem<br>
C:       Some specks and somewhat problematic<br>
D:       Many specks observable and problematic.<br>
The result of evaluation is shown in Table 3.<br>
