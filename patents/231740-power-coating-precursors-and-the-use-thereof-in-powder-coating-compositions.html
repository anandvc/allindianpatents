				<td>POWDER COATING PRECURSORS AND<br>
THE USE THEREOF IN POWDER COATING COMPOSITIONS<br>
This patent application claims the benefit of pending US Serial<br>
60/488366 filed July 18, 2003.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The electrostatic coating process for the application of color<br>
coatings on various substrates is well known. This process uses a<br>
composition that is an electrically chargeable powder mixture of a film-<br>
forming polymer and a pigment (or pigments) having the desired color.<br>
Unfortunately, preparation of such powder coating compositions for<br>
application by a powder spray applicator has presented a problem in<br>
the past in connection with platy pigments.<br>
Pearlescent or nacreous pigments simulate the effect of natural<br>
pearl and are composed of thin platelets that are transparent in the<br>
visible region of the spectrum. The platelets are very smooth and part<br>
of the light that strikes the platelets is reflected and part is transmitted<br>
through the platelets. That part of the light that is transmitted is<br>
subsequently reflected by other layers of platelets. The result is that<br>
multiple reflections from many layers occur and this results in depth of<br>
sheen since the eye cannot focus on one particular layer.<br>
The reflection that occurs is specular in that the angle of<br>
incidence equals the angle of reflection. The amount of light reflected<br>
at non-specular angles is small and the amount of light reflected<br>
diminishes very quickly as the specular angle is passed. The result is<br>
that pearlescent pigments are extremely sensitive to viewing angle. In<br>
order for the maximum amount of light to be reflected, the platelets<br>
must be extremely smooth. Any surface roughness causes light to be<br>
scattered in a non-specular manner and diminishes the lustrous effect.<br><br>
The platelets must be aligned parallel to each other and to the<br>
substrate for maximum reflectivity. If not so aligned, light will be<br>
reflected randomly and again, luster will diminish. The amount of light<br>
that is reflected depends on the index of refraction. As the index of<br>
refraction increases, the amount of reflected light increases.<br>
Platy pigments of a metallic material rely on their laminar<br>
structure for maximum appearance effect. Such plates include, for<br>
instance, metallic flakes such as aluminum, bronze and stainless steel<br>
plates as well as natural or synthetic pearlescent pigments exemplified<br>
by, e.g., natural pearlescence or a metal oxide-coated substrate such<br>
as titanium dioxide-coated mica, iron oxide-coated mica, titanium<br>
dioxide-coated glass, iron oxide-coated glass, and iron-coated<br>
aluminum flakes. The laminar structure of such metallic or pearlescent<br>
pigments is destroyed during the extrusion or grinding processes,<br>
which are used in the manufacture of powder coating compositions and<br>
as a result, the coating appearance achieved exhibits a reduced luster<br>
effect.<br>
The industry has attempted to avoid the foregoing problem by<br>
dry blending the pigments and polymer powder, i.e.; the polymer carrier<br>
is mechanically blended with the pigment. Unfortunately, the pigment<br>
and the powder particles usually develop a different charge magnitude,<br>
which results in application issues and color shift when the powder<br>
coating composition is electrostatically sprayed on a substrate. In<br>
addition, the pigments have a tendency to separate from the polymer<br>
powder in that volume of the powder spray composition, that does not<br>
attach to the substrate and is then recovered. As a result, the<br>
recovered oversprayed material is difficult to reuse.<br>
To overcome the problems encountered as a result of the dry<br>
blending process, a blending process in which the powder base and<br>
the pigment were mixed and then heated to a temperature sufficient to<br>
soften the surface of the powder particles so that the pigment could<br>
bind to the surface of such particles was developed, as described in<br><br>
U.S. Patent 5,187,220. While this process works well for corona<br>
electrostatic charging and alleviates the problems with reusing the<br>
powder over spray, it is a rather costly process.<br>
A significant advance in the art is described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,824,144, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The described metal containing platelet pigment is provided with a<br>
viscous surface layer of polymer or other sticky liquid material. When<br>
that treated pigment is blended with powder coating composition, the<br>
powder attaches to the surface of the pigment thereby minimizing color<br>
separation. The pigment is also encapsulated by the powder to<br>
thereby present a single surface. A better charge of those pigment<br>
particles which do not become attached to the powder materials is also<br>
realized.<br>
A significant problem in connection with the use of metal-<br>
containing platelet pigments in a powder coating composition is that the<br>
concentration of the pigment which can be incorporated is limited.<br>
While pigment amounts of up to about 10% or more can be utilized in<br>
single application environments or in the laboratory, the concentration<br>
is limited to about 3% when operating on a larger scale as is required<br>
commercially. At levels higher than about 3%, numerous problems<br>
arise. These include spray gun clogging and tip build-up, blotchy panel<br>
appearance and color separation.<br>
It has been discovered that a treatment which had previously<br>
been developed for pearlescent pigments intended for exterior use to<br>
provide improved humidity, resistance and overall weatherability and<br>
which was used in liquid coating systems such as a solvent or water<br>
borne automotive paint systems, for example, pigmented base coat<br>
and clear top. coat, provides superior properties in the context of<br>
powder coatings. The exterior pigment treatment surprisingly improves<br>
the application properties of the pigment when incorporated into<br>
powder coatings. Such improvements include less build up of the<br>
pigment at the electrostatic gun tip, improved transfer through feed<br><br>
lines, improved transfer efficiency of the pigment and a more uniform<br>
coating appearance. Commonly assigned US Patent 6,524,661<br>
teaches an improved pearfescent pigment powder coating composition<br>
comprising a mixture of a particulate resin carrier and a particulate<br>
pigment in which the pigment is a laminar metal-containing pigment<br>
having a first coating of a hydrated aluminum oxide or hydrated cerium<br>
and aluminum oxides and a coating of a hydrolyzed silane coupling<br>
agent or intermingled with the first coating. A Scanning Electron-<br>
imaging Microscopy (SEM) image of such a product is shown in Figure<br>
4. The SEM image shows titanium oxide coated mica platelet with the<br>
silane surface treatment at a magnification of 5,500x and 33,000x. The<br>
powder coating mix consisting of the exterior treated pigment has the<br>
advantage of minimizing the pigment separation at the gun tip, but<br>
affects the quality of the film of the coated part once powder is cured.<br>
We believe that the aluminum hydroxide is not present on the outer<br>
surface of the silane coating. See also US Patent 6,176,918. Thus,<br>
due to the surface energy differences between the silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment and resin, the cured powder coated film has a<br>
textured or orange-peel-like appearance.<br>
It is known in the industry to add aluminum oxide to powder<br>
coating compositions by either preblending the aluminum oxide with<br>
resin and then mixing the preblend with pearlescent pigment or<br>
simultaneously mixing aluminum oxide, resin, and pearlescent pigment<br>
together. See Nargiello, Fumed Metallic Oxides Improve Powder<br>
Processing and Application, Volume 4(3), pages 16-20 (June 1993).<br>
As shown in Comparative 5 below, spraying the simultaneously made<br>
mixture onto a panel did not provide any appearance improvement.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved pearlescent<br>
pigment powder coating composition and powder coating method.<br><br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a powder coating<br>
composition comprising a mixture of a particulate resin carrier;<br>
particulate pigment in which the pigment is a laminar metal-containing<br>
pigment having a coating of hydrolyzed silane coupling agent; and<br>
leveling agent. Use of this powder coating composition provides an<br>
improved powder coating application method by eliminating the<br>
pigment separation problem during the powder spray out and<br>
significantly improving the panel appearance once the powder is cured.<br>
The addition of aluminum oxide onto the surface of the silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment changes the surface energy of the pigment and<br>
allows better compatibility with powder resin systems during the curing<br>
process.<br>
Thus, the present invention is directed to a powder coating<br>
precursor comprising: (a) pearlescent pigment coated with at least<br>
one silane coupling agent; and (b) leveling agent that is present on<br>
the outer surface of the silane coated pearlescent pigment (a).<br>
The present invention also provides a method of powder coating<br>
composition preparation comprising the steps of: (a) combining: (i)<br>
pearlescent pigment coated with at least one silane coupling agent;<br>
and (ii) leveling agent to form a powder coating precursor wherein the<br>
leveling agent is present on the outer surface of the silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment; and (b) adding resin to said powder coating<br>
precursor (a).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The powder coating composition of the present invention is the<br>
conventional powder coating composition for electrostatic application<br>
as a result of dry blending in which the pigment has been treated as<br>
described below. Thus any known particulate resin carrier used<br>
heretofore can also be used in the composition and process of the<br>
present invention. As a result of the improved pigment utilized in the<br>
present invention, the pigment concentration can be typically up to<br>
about 15% of the total powder. Typically, depending on the effect<br>
desired, the pigment will constitute about 1 to 8% of the composition.<br>
Pearlescent Pigment:<br>
The pigment of the present invention is laminar substrate, that<br>
is, it is a platelet-like pigment. The platelets may be made of a<br>
reflective metal such as aluminum, bronze or stainless steel in the form<br>
of flakes or also may be any natural or synthetic pearlescent pigment.<br>
Other useful subtrate materials include natural mica, synthetic mica,<br>
aluminum oxide, bismuth oxychloride, boron nitride, silicon dioxide,<br>
copper flake, copper alloy flake, zinc flake, zinc alloy flake, enamel,<br>
china clay, and porcelain. Useful glass flakes are disclosed in<br>
commonly assigned US Patent 6,045,914 incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Glass flakes are resilient and can be optically attractive as<br>
well. Useful glass flakes are disclosed in commonly assigned US<br>
Patent 6,045,914 incorporated herein by reference. Useful synthetic<br>
mica substrate is disclosed in US Patent 5,741,355 incorporated herein<br>
by reference. Preferably, the substrate has a length of about 2.5<br>
microns to about 200 microns and a thickness of about 0.05 micron to<br>
about 5 microns.<br><br>
A mixture of substrates may also be used. In a substrate<br>
mixture, different materials and/or substrates used in. the present<br>
invention may have any morphology including platelet, spherical,<br>
cubical, acicular, whiskers, or fibrous. Examples of useful platy<br>
materials include platy aluminum oxide, platy glass, aluminum, mica,<br>
bismuth oxychloride, platy iron oxide, platy graphite, platy silica,<br>
bronze, stainless steel, natural pearl, boron nitride, silicon dioxide,<br>
copper flake, copper alloy flake, zinc flake, zinc alloy flake, zinc oxide,<br>
enamel, china clay, and porcelain and the like. Any combination of the<br>
preceding platy materials or at least one of the preceding platy<br>
materials and at least one non-platy material may be used.<br>
Examples of useful metal oxides include but not are limited to<br>
titanium dioxide including both the anatase and rutile forms, iron oxide<br>
including Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, silicon oxide, zinc oxide, and zirconium<br>
oxide. Multiple layers of different metal oxides may be used.<br>
Natural pearlescent pigments include natural peariescence and<br>
the synthetic pigments include metal oxide-coated mica pigments,<br>
metal oxide-coated glass flakes, iron-coated aluminum flakes, and<br>
reduced titanium-coated micas. Platy pigments such as the platy<br>
titanium dioxide disclosed in commonly assigned US Patent 4,192,691<br>
or 5,611,691 may also be used, in the present invention. In Figure 1,<br>
pearlescent pigment 10 comprises substrate 12 coated with metal<br>
oxide 14.<br>
The pearlescent pigment of this invention is additionally treated<br>
with a hydrolyzed silane coupling agent or a mixture of such agents.<br>
These, as known, are compounds which act as an interface between<br>
an organic material and an inorganic materia! to enhance the affinity<br>
between the two. Thus, the siiane-coupling agents generally have both<br>
an organo functional group and a silicon functional group bonded either<br>
directly or indirectly to silicon. The silicon functional groups are<br>
generally alkoxy groups and preferably C1-4 alkoxy groups. Particularly<br>
useful organo functional groups are epoxies and amino alkyls.<br><br>
Examples of silane coupling agents which can be used in the<br>
present invention are gamma-(2-<br>
aminoethyl)aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
aminopropyl trimethoxysilane, gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
gamma-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane,<br>
gamma-methacyryioxypropylmethyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
gamma-metacyryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-glycidoxypropyl<br>
trimethoxysilane, gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
vinyltriacetoxysilane, gamma-chloropropyltrimethoxy silane,<br>
vinyltrimethoxysilane, trimethylchlorosilane, gamma-<br>
isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane and the like.<br>
The silane coupling agent should be selected so that it is<br>
suitable for any organic material which will be combined with the<br>
pigment in use.<br>
The pigment is treated with the silane coupling agent by dry or<br>
wet mixing. For instance, an aqueous solution of the agent in water or<br>
a mixture of water and an organic solvent can be added to an aqueous<br>
slurry of the pigment. The silane-is preferably prehydrolyzed such as,<br>
for instance, by stirring the coupling agent in water for a suitable period<br>
of time. It is also possible to effect hydrolyzation at the time of mixing.<br>
In general, about 0.1 to 10 wt%, preferably about 0.25 to 5 wt %, of the<br>
silane coupling agent is used based on 100 parts by weight of pigment<br>
being treated. The coupling agent and pigment are combined for a<br>
period of time sufficient to allow reaction to occur, which may last from<br>
a few minutes to several hours or more, preferably about 3 to 24 hours.<br>
Thereafter the treated pigment can be recovered in the conventional<br>
fashion such as by filtration, centrifugation and the like, and dried. It is<br>
also possible to combine, if desired, the coupling agent treatment with<br>
the aluminum/cerium treatment. See also commonly assigned US<br>
Patent 5,759,255 incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The phrase "silane coated pearlescent pigment" means that the<br>
silane forms at least a partial coating around the pearlescent pigment<br><br>
and thus, the pearlescent pigment may be partially or completely<br>
coated by silane. As an example, in Figure 2, pearlescent pigment 10<br>
from Figure 1 is completely coated with silane 16 to form silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment 18. The surface of the silane that is not in contact<br>
with the pearlescent pigment is referred to herein as the "outer<br>
surface". The outer surface 17 is shown in attached Figure 2.<br>
Coating of a metal oxide-coated mica pigment with a hydrous<br>
aluminum oxide per se is known and may optionally be used on the<br>
pearlescent pigment prior to coating with silane. It is described, for<br>
example, in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,011, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the<br>
pigment is dispersed by stirring in water and then an aluminum<br>
compound such as aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate or aluminum<br>
potassium sulfate, and a neutralizing agent such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide ammonia or urea, are added simultaneously as<br>
aqueous solutions. The resulting hydrolysis causes the hydrous oxide<br>
to deposit on the substrate. As described, the aluminum compound<br>
must be added slowly enough to permit the formation of a smooth,<br>
continuous layer on the platelets and the rate should fall within the<br>
range of about 0.03 to 0.1 mg Al per minute per gram of pigment,<br>
preferably about 0.005 to 0.07 mg Al/min/g pigment. A quantity of<br>
aluminum compound solution is used so as to produce a hydrous<br>
aluminum oxide coating containing about 0.05 to 1.2% aluminum, and<br>
preferably about 0.1 to 0.8% aluminum, based on the total weight of<br>
the pigment. Pigments in which the concentration of aluminum is about<br>
1.2% are less effective in stabilization than lower concentrations. After<br>
deposition of the coating, the product can be filtered, washed with<br>
water and dried at any convenient temperature. Use of a temperature<br>
which is high enough to calcine the hydrous aluminum oxide should be<br>
avoided. The silane as described above would then be coated as<br>
described above onto the aluminum hydroxide coated pearlescent<br>
pigment.<br><br>
The coating of the pigments with a coating consisting essentially<br>
of a combination of hydrated cerium and aluminum oxides is also per<br>
se known and may optionally be used on the peariescent pigment prior<br>
to coating with silane. It is described, for instance, in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,423,912, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the pigment is dispersed in a<br>
liquid from which the cerium and aluminum can be readily precipitated<br>
onto the surface of the pigment. This conveniently, and preferably, is<br>
an aqueous dispersion. The solid pigment in the dispersion generally<br>
comprises about 5 to 30%, preferably about 10 to 20%, and the cerium<br>
and aluminum are each added to the dispersion in the form of a salt<br>
which is soluble in a liquid medium. While other salts can be used, the<br>
nitrate salts are preferred. It is also preferred to deposit about 0.1-<br>
1.5% cerium hydroxide, more preferably 0.2-0.6%, calculated as weight<br>
percent cerium and about 0.1-1%, more preferably 0.2-0.6%, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, calculated as weight percent aluminum, based on the<br>
weight of the pigment. The salts can be added to the slurry individually<br>
in either order and precipitated or preferably, added simultaneously<br>
and precipitated. Precipitation is controlled by raising the pH to a value<br>
greater than about 5, preferably to.a value of about 5.5-7.5. After<br>
completion of the precipitation step, the treated product is separated<br>
from the dispersion by any convenient means such as, for instance,<br>
filtration, centrifugation or settling, washed and dried. The silane as<br>
described above would then be coated as described above onto the<br>
cerium and aluminum hydroxide coated peariescent pigment.<br>
Useful preferred peariescent pigments are commercially<br>
available from Engelhard Corporation and described below:<br><br><br><br>
Leveling Agent:<br>
In particular, the leveling agent is selected from the group<br>
consisting of aluminum oxide, carbon nanotubule, titanium oxide, zinc<br>
oxide, or zirconium oxide.<br>
The leveling agent is physically mixed with the silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment. As an example, the preceding mixture may be<br><br>
placed in a paint can with a baffle and shaken on a paint shaker until<br>
the aluminum oxide is well dispersed. The result is a silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment having leveling agent on the outer surface of the<br>
silane. Based on the physical mixing, the leveling agent may be in the<br>
form of islands or aggregates on the silane outer surface. This<br>
inventive result is in contrast to the industry practice where aluminum<br>
oxide is added to powder coating compositions by either preblending<br>
the aluminum oxide with resin and then mixing the preblend with<br>
pearlescent pigment or simultaneously mixing aluminum oxide, resin,<br>
and pearlescent pigment together. We believe that this industry<br>
practice does not result in leveling agent being present on the outer<br>
surface of the silane to the same extent as the present invention. The<br>
inventive silane coated pearlescent pigment having leveling agent on<br>
the outer surface of the silane is referred to herein as "powder coating<br>
precursor" As a non-limiting example, in Figure 3, the silane coated<br>
pearlescent pigment 18 of Figure 2 has leveling agent 20 on the outer<br>
silane surface to form powder coating precursor 22. Figure 5 is SEMs<br>
of the present product as resulting from Inventive Example 2 below.<br>
Figure 5 shows a titanium oxide mica platelet with a silane treatment<br>
followed by the addition of aluminum oxide. X-ray elemental analysis<br>
using the Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) technique on the<br>
clusters present on the pigment surface showed an increase in<br>
aluminum content when compared to a region where no clusters are<br>
present. This analysis clearly indicates the presence of aluminum oxide<br>
on the surface of the pigment. Stereo electron microscopy of two<br>
micrographs indicated that some of the aluminum oxide particles can<br>
be embedded in the titanium oxide grains.<br>
Preferably, the fumed aluminum oxide is present at about 0.5 to<br>
about 2.5 weight percent of the preceding described treated pigment.<br>
The aluminum oxide in the present invention has a primary particle size<br>
of 13 nm and a surface area of 100 ± 15 meters2/gram. In addition, <br>
aluminum oxide particle with a surface area of 55 meters2/gram also may be used in the present invention.<br>
A carbon nanotubule is known as a microscopic fibrillar tube having a nanometer size in diameter. The carbon nanotubule comprises a single or coaxial monoatomic sheets cylindrically bent around a center axis of the tubule and a cylindrical center space or a cylindrical hollow defined by the sheet. The monoatomic sheet comprises a graphite carbon monoatomic sheet. Such carbon tubule is such an extremely slender carbon fibril as having a nanometer size in diameter. The individual monoatomic sheets are coaxially arranged to be separated by a distance in the radial direction. The micron-sized carbon fibril has been well known in the prior art. The nanometer sized carbon fibril was first reported in 1991 Nature, Vol. 354, pp. 56-68. Carbon nanotubule coating may dissipate the charge built up on the pigment during its transport to the spray gun. The nano particles may have the added advantage of functioning as a leveling agent by changing the surface energy of the pigment as well.<br>
Resin:<br>
The preceding mixture is placed in a paint can with a baffle and shaken on a paint shaker until the aluminum oxide is well dispersed. The aluminum oxide may also be dispersed with the use of a blender that can generate shear such as the Patterson-Kelly or the Littleford Day blender. The resulting dispersion or powder coating precursor is then formulated with powder coating resins and shaken for 5-10 minutes. Useful powder coating resins include polyester TGIC-polyester TGIC-free, and urethane. Typically, the powder mixes have about 1 to about 8 weight percent of the present product in the resin. The powder is sprayed Out using a Gema pedestal corona gun or a gravity feed gun and the resulting sprayed panels are cured at about 400°F.<br><br>
Utility:<br>
The present composition is useful in any application where<br>
pearlescent pigments have been used heretofore. Thus, the products<br>
of this invention have an unlimited use in all types of automotive and<br>
industrial paint applications, especially in the organic color coating and<br>
inks field where deep color intensity is required. For example, these<br>
pigments can be used in mass tone or as styling agents to spray paint<br>
all types of automotive and non-automotive vehicles. Similarly, they<br>
can be used on all clay/formica/wood/glass/metal/ enamel/ceramic and<br>
non-porous or porous surfaces.<br>
Analytical Test Methods:<br>
Scanning Electron-imaging Microscopy (SEM): The instrument<br>
used to obtain SEM images is JEOL 100CXII with an ASID4D scanning<br>
attachment and the operating voltage was 100KV. The sample<br>
powders were dispersed in water, hand agitated, applied with a<br>
dropper onto a conductive grid with a support film, and air-dried.<br>
Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS): EDS was obtained<br>
using a Kevex Sigma 2 with an ultrathin window angled at 30 degrees.<br>
Stereo electron microscopy using two micrographs of the same area<br>
with a 10 degree difference In viewing angle were taken and the stereo<br>
effect was obtained using mirror stereoscope Type F-71 manufactured<br>
by Alan Gordon Enterprises, Inc.<br>
In order to further illustrate the present invention, various non-<br>
limiting examples are set forth below. In these examples, as<br>
throughout the specification and claims, all parts and percentages are<br>
by weight and all temperatures in °C, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Comparative 1<br><br>
Exterior MEARLIN® MAGNAPEARL® 1109 product (contains<br>
mica (64-77 weight percent), TiO2 (22-34 weight percent), Cr(OH)3<br>
(0.5-1 weight percent), and Sn02 (0.2-1.0 weight percent)) supplied by<br>
Engelhard Corporation was used as the pearlescent pigment; this<br>
pearlescent pigment did not contain a silane coupling agent. We did<br>
not add aluminum oxide to the pearlescent pigment. Polyester TGIC<br>
resin was used; this resin did not contain aluminum oxide. The<br>
pearlescent pigment was used at 8% loading in the polyester TGIC<br>
resin system resulted in pigment separation at the gun tip during spray<br>
out. The accumulated pigment at the tip would then shoot off onto the<br>
powder-coated part, which results in defective parts. The subsequent<br>
addition of alumina oxide did not help the pigment separation problem.<br>
Comparative 2<br>
A titanium dioxide coated mica with a surface treatment<br>
consisting of aluminum hydroxide, phenylalanine and lauric acid<br>
according to commonly assigned US Patent 6,245,323 was used as<br>
the pearlescent pigment. This pearlescent pigment did not have silane<br>
coating. The pearlescent pigment was dry blended at 8% with<br>
polyester TGIC-free resin also had pigment build up problem at gun tip<br>
during spray out. The resin did not contain aluminum oxide. The<br>
addition of aluminum oxide did not help the spray issues.<br>
Comparative 3<br>
Commercially available pigments with silane treatment did not<br>
spray out well at 8% loading in a polyester TGIC-free resin system.<br>
The resin did not contain aluminum oxide. Both products with and<br>
without the addition of aluminum oxide had pigment separation at the<br>
gun tip.<br>
Comparative 4<br><br>
A commercially available pearlescent pigment having a silane<br>
treatment had an average particle size of about 20 microns. We did<br>
not add aluminum oxide to this pearlescent pigment. This pearlescent<br>
pigment was combined with polyester resin at 8% loading and powder<br>
sprayed onto a panel. The resin did not contain any aluminum oxide.<br>
During powder spray out, build-up of pearlescent pigment was noticed<br>
at the tip of the spray gun and after curing, the sprayed panel had an<br>
"orange-peel" like appearance. When the pearlescent pigment was<br>
first combined with 2% aluminum oxide and then mixed with polyester<br>
resin, a significant improvement in the. powder coated panel<br>
appearance was noticed.<br>
Comparative 5<br>
A titanium dioxide coated mica with a surface treatment<br>
consisting of cerium hydroxide/polymer network was mixed together<br>
with aluminum oxide and polyester TGIC-Free resin system. Powder<br>
spray out of the 3-component mixture showed no improvement of the<br>
coated panel after curing. The lack of improvement of the powder<br>
coated surface when all 3 components are mixed together proves that<br>
it is necessary to modify the pigment surface before the addition of the<br>
resin system. The mere presence of aluminum oxide does not lead to<br>
an improvement of the powder coated panel.<br>
