Description<br>
Circuit breaker having an interrupter unit arranged within an<br>
encapsulating housing<br>
The invention relates to a circuit breaker having an<br>
interrupter unit, which is arranged within an encapsulating<br>
housing and has a first contact piece and a second contact<br>
piece, wherein the contact pieces can move in relation to one<br>
another and are arranged axially opposite, as well as having a<br>
first current path section for supplying an electrical current<br>
to the first contact piece and a second current path section<br>
for supplying an electrical current to the second contact<br>
piece, wherein the current path sections are part, of the<br>
interrupter unit, and at least one of the current path sections<br>
has a connection contact and can move in relation to a<br>
stationary mating contact.<br>
Such a circuit breaker is known, for example, from the patent<br>
specification DE 44 38 776 CI. The circuit breaker therein is<br>
part of a metal-encapsulated electrical high-voltage switchgear<br>
assembly. Terminals for connecting two isolators are arranged<br>
at a first end of the circuit breaker therein. In order to make<br>
it possible for contact to be made between the high-voltage<br>
circuit breaker and the isolators in a simple manner, plug-in<br>
contacts are provided, of which one is in the form of a blade<br>
contact and the other is in the form of a bolt-shaped contact.<br>
When the interrupter unit is fitted, the interrupter unit is<br>
inserted into the encapsulating housing, and the blade contact<br>
or the bolt contact is closed as said unit is inserted. The ;<br>
construction of the contact pieces makes it possible for the<br>
circuit breaker to be fitted in a simple manner.<br><br>
Once the circuit breaker has been fitted, the encapsulating<br>
housing is closed and filled with a gas at elevated pressure.<br>
Isolators are necessary	for connecting the	circuit breaker<br>
optionally to different	busbar sections or	feed lines. In<br>
addition to the isolators	themselves, space is	required for the<br>
isolator drives.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a circuit<br>
breaker which, given small dimensions, can be connected in a<br>
simple manner to various busbar or line sections.<br>
The object is achieved in the case of a circuit breaker of the<br>
type mentioned at the outset according to the invention by<br>
virtue of the fact that the current path section can move by<br>
means of a drive device when the encapsulating housing is<br>
closed.<br>
Within a closed encapsulating housing, the interrupter unit of<br>
the circuit breaker is surrounded by an insulating gas, which<br>
is at elevated pressure, for example sulfur hexafluoride or<br>
nitrogen. This insulating gas makes it possible for large<br>
potential differences to be isolated at small distances. Owing<br>
to a movement at least of one of the current path sections, an<br>
isolating point can be formed between the connection contact<br>
and the mating contact. It is possible, by means of the drive,<br>
to repeatedly carry out the movement of 'the current path<br>
sections. Since it is now possible for isolating points to be<br>
produced within the encapsulating housing owing to the movement<br>
of the interrupter unit itself or of parts of the interrupter<br>
unit, isolators requiring additional physical volume can be<br>
dispensed with.<br><br>
Advantageously, provision may further be made for the current<br>
path section to be mounted such that it can rotate.<br>
Rotatable mounting of the current path sections makes it<br>
possible to move the connection contact on a circular path and<br>
thus to move it into and out of the mating contact. In this<br>
case, provision may be made for the contact pieces of the<br>
interrupter unit to likewise be capable of rotating with<br>
respect to one another. It is particularly advantageous if the<br>
contact pieces can be positioned in various positions with<br>
respect to one another. This makes more uniform wear on the<br>
contacts possible. Erosion points and wear on the contact<br>
pieces are distributed over a larger surface area.<br>
Advantageously, provision may furthermore be made for the<br>
current path section to be axially displaceable.<br>
Owing to the axial displaceability, the connection contact can<br>
be moved on a linear path into the mating contact. A<br>
combination of a rotary movement and an axial movement of the<br>
current path section makes it possible to produce a movement of<br>
the connection contact on a helical path. Such movements can be<br>
produced relatively easily owing to the superimposition of a<br>
rotary movement of the current path section with a simultaneous<br>
axial displacement.<br>
One advantageous refinement may further provide for the<br>
interrupter unit to have a first current path section and a<br>
second current path section, wherein the two current path<br>
sections can move jointly.<br><br>
A joint movement of two current path sections makes it possible<br>
to stick to the previous construction of an interrupter unit of<br>
a circuit breaker and to move this as a whole. The current path<br>
sections of an interrupter unit are in this case designed to be<br>
approximately tubular and are arranged in each case at the end<br>
in the axial direction of the interrupter unit. Provision may<br>
be made here for the current path sections to be designed to be<br>
mechanically robust such that they form a type of supporting<br>
frame or chassis, on which the further parts of the interrupter<br>
unit are fixed. It is thus possible, for example, for provision<br>
to be made for the current path sections to be arranged<br>
concentrically with respect to the contact pieces, wherein the<br>
contact pieces may be both rated current and arcing contact<br>
pieces. The current path sections in this case surround the<br>
contact system of the interrupter unit. The contact system of<br>
the interrupter unit may also have, in addition to the contact<br>
pieces, compression devices for producing a quenching gas flow,<br>
storage volumes for accommodating heated quenching gas, arcing<br>
chambers, within which an arc burns or else an insulating<br>
material nozzle, which is used for guidance and force transfer<br>
purposes between the two sides of the interrupter unit having<br>
the two current path sections. The current path sections<br>
surround the interrupter unit at the end and form the outer<br>
contour of the interrupter unit. In this case, the current path<br>
sections may be designed to be mechanically robust and can<br>
absorb supporting forces and/or act as a shielding element for<br>
an electrical field. The current path sections can also be<br>
referred to as contact carriers., which hold and support the<br>
actual contact system and are used for supplying electrical<br>
current to this system.<br>
Furthermore, provision may advantageously be made for the<br>
interrupter unit to have a first current path section<br><br>
and a second current path section, wherein the two current path<br>
sections can move independently of one another.<br>
An independent movement of the two current path sections is<br>
particularly advantageous when each of the current path<br>
sections has at least one connection contact associated with<br>
it. This makes it possible to form different circuit variants<br>
independently of one another. It is thus possible, for example,<br>
to implement independent connection or isolation of two busbar<br>
systems. For this purpose, it is merely necessary to provide a<br>
connection contact on the first current path section and a<br>
connection contact on the second current path section. By means<br>
of the two connection contacts, it is possible in each case to<br>
drive an outgoing feeder to the first or to the second busbar.<br>
Since this driving can take place in a detached manner, owing<br>
to the independent movability of the current path sections, the<br>
selection of the respective busbars can be performed as<br>
desired. In this case, provision may also be made for the<br>
connection contacts or the mating contacts to be designed such<br>
that an interruption-free changeover from the first busbar to<br>
the second busbar, and vice versa, can be carried out. Power<br>
switching of the cross-coupling can be carried out by the<br>
interrupter unit of the circuit breaker.<br>
Furthermore, provision may advantageously be made for the axis<br>
of rotation of a current path section, which is mounted such<br>
that it can rotate, to run approximately parallel to the axial<br>
direction of the mutually opposite contact pieces.<br>
The interrupter units of circuit breakers have a substantially<br>
elongate, tubular outer contour. The contact pieces are also<br>
aligned in the<br><br>
axial direction of the rounded-off outer contour. The rotatable<br>
mounting approximately parallel to the axial direction of<br>
mutually opposite contact pieces makes it possible for the<br>
interrupter unit to rotate in a very small area. Furthermore,<br>
it is easily possible, with such an alignment of the axis of<br>
rotation, for a drive movement to be transferred to the contact<br>
pieces, which can move in relation to one another, from the<br>
outside. Owing to the substantially coaxial design of the<br>
interrupter unit and of a drive rod, which is also arranged<br>
coaxially- with respect thereto, it is possible to transfer a<br>
switching movement towards the interrupter unit, for example by<br>
means of a rotary coupling in the drive rod.<br>
One further advantageous refinement may provide for the<br>
connection contact to be a moving contact element of an<br>
isolating device and/or of a grounding switching device.<br>
Isolating devices are required for providing additional<br>
isolating points within an electrical conductor. This ensures<br>
that, in the event of failure or malfunctioning of a circuit<br>
breaker, a conductor path is not produced again in an<br>
undesirable manner. Isolated sections can be grounded via a<br>
grounding switching device. Further protection is therefore<br>
provided in the case of faulty operation or in the case of a<br>
fault in an electrical switching device. The arrangement of<br>
moving contact elements on the current path sections or on one<br>
of the current path sections allows for a connection of<br>
previously separate circuit breakers and isolators. A very<br>
compact switchpanel arrangement can thus be produced. This may<br>
have a modular design since all the required power switching<br>
contacts, isolating contacts or grounding contacts are arranged<br>
within the gas area of the interrupter unit.<br><br>
One further advantageous refinement may provide for it to be<br>
possible for the relative movement of the first and the second<br>
contact piece and the movement of the current path section(s)<br>
to be produced by a common drive device.<br>
The relative movement between the first and the second contact<br>
piece is produced, for example, by means of a switching rod,<br>
which is arranged coaxially with respect to the contact pieces.<br>
Via the switching rod, at least one of the contact pieces is<br>
connected to a drive arranged outside the encapsulating<br>
housing. Provision can thus be made, for example, for, in the<br>
event of a disconnecting movement of the circuit breaker once<br>
the end position of the contact pieces has been reached, a<br>
further movement to take place by the drive rod in the<br>
disconnecting direction, with the result that an axial<br>
displacement of the interrupter unit or else only of one of the<br>
current path sections of the interrupter unit is produced. In a<br>
connection process, this principle is reversed, with the result<br>
that, first, the current path section or the interrupter unit<br>
is displaced into its power switching position and then the<br>
contact pieces are connected by a continuation of the axial<br>
movement of the switching rod. In addition, the axial movement<br>
of the switching rod can be superimposed by a rotary movement,<br>
as a result of which, independently of one another or combined<br>
with one another, a rotary movement and a drive movement can be<br>
produced by a common drive device.<br>
One further advantageous refinement may provide for the axial<br>
distance between the first and the second current path section<br>
to be approximately constant.<br><br>
A virtually constant axial distance between the first and the<br>
second current path section is provided, for example, when the<br>
two current path sections are always moved in the same. way.<br>
This is the case, for example, when an interrupter unit with a<br>
conventional .construction of a circuit breaker is mounted such<br>
that it is axially displaceable and/or such that it can rotate.<br>
Advantageously, provision may also be made for the axial<br>
distance between the first and the second current path section<br>
to be variable.<br>
The axial distance between the first and the second current<br>
path section is variable when the two current path sections can<br>
move independently of one another. In this case, provision may<br>
be made, for example, for the current path sections of the<br>
interrupter unit to be mounted independently of one another and<br>
also to be capable of moving independently of one another.<br>
Separate displaceability of the current path sections can take<br>
place, for example, by virtue of the fact that each of the<br>
current path sections can be driven independently, mutual<br>
guidance taking place via insulating elements, for example an<br>
insulating material nozzle, which is arranged coaxially with<br>
respect to the arcing contact pieces. It is also possible for<br>
other components to be provided for guiding the current path<br>
sections. For example, the switching chamber of the interrupter<br>
unit can also be used for this purpose. Alternatively, however,<br>
it is also possible to dispense with mutual support/guidance of<br>
the current path sections entirely. In this case, each of the<br>
current path sections is mounted and guided independently of<br>
one another at the end. As a result, a free gas path can be<br>
formed between the halves of the interrupter unit, which gas<br>
path can fulfill an additional isolator function.<br><br>
In the text which follows, the invention will be illustrated<br>
schematically in a drawing and described in more detail below<br>
with reference ,to an exemplary embodiment.<br>

an interrupter unit,<br>
figure 2 shows a section through a circuit breaker having an<br>
interrupter unit fitted,<br>
figure 3 shows a section through an application of the circuit<br>
breaker in a gas-insulated switchgear assembly,<br>
figure 4 shows an application of the circuit breaker in an<br>
embodiment outdoors, and<br>
figure 5 shows a refinement variant of a	circuit breaker<br>
having an interrupter unit, which	is mounted such<br>
that it is axially displaceable and	such that it can<br>
rotate.<br>
The interrupter unit 1, illustrated in figure 1, of a circuit<br>
breaker has a first contact piece 2 and a second contact piece<br>
3. The two contact pieces 2, 3 are in the form of arcing<br>
contact pieces and are arranged axially opposite one another.<br>
The first contact piece 2 is in the form of a tulip contact,<br>
and the second contact piece 3 is in the form of a bolt-shaped<br>
contact piece. A first rated current contact piece 4 is<br>
arranged concentrically with respect to the first contact piece<br>
2. Furthermore, a second rated current contact piece 5 is<br>
arranged concentrically<br><br>
with respect to the second contact piece 3. A movement of a<br>
drive (not illustrated in figure 1) can be transferred to the<br>
first contact piece 2 and the first rated current contact piece<br>
4 via a drive rod 6. An insulating material nozzle 7 is<br>
arranged coaxially with respect to the first contact piece 2.<br>
The insulating material nozzle 7 surrounds the first contact<br>
piece 2 and the second contact piece 3. The insulating material<br>
nozzle 7 itself is surrounded by the first rated current<br>
contact piece 4 and the second rated current contact piece 5.<br>
The insulating material nozzle 7 is fixedly connected to the<br>
first rated current contact piece 4 and the first contact piece<br>
2. The insulating material nozzle 7 protrudes with its free end<br>
in the direction of the second contact piece 3 and of the<br>
second rated current contact piece 5 and is mounted there such<br>
that it can slide in order to prevent oscillations.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to envisage that the<br>
insulating material nozzle 7 protrudes unsupported in the<br>
direction of the second contact piece 3 and of the second rated<br>
current contact piece 5, with no sliding mounting. If<br>
appropriate, it is also possible to dispense with the use of an<br>
insulating material nozzle 7. The interrupter unit 1 also has a<br>
first current path section 8 and a second current path section<br>
9. The current path sections 8, 9 are substantially tubular and<br>
surround the contact system so as to produce a dielectrically<br>
advantageous outer contour of the interrupter unit.<br>
Alternatively, provision may also be made for the first current<br>
path section 8 and the second current path section 9 to be<br>
formed, for example, from the first rated current contact piece<br>
4 and the second rated current contact piece 5. In order to<br>
keep the distance between the current path sections 8, 9<br>
constant and to position the sections, which can move in<br>
relation to one another, the two current path sections 8, 9 are<br>
connected to one another at a fixed angle by means of<br>
insulating rods 10a,b. The interrupter unit illustrated in<br>
figure 1 may be arranged, for example,<br><br>
with one pole and in an insulated manner within an<br>
encapsulating housing. Alternatively, a plurality of these<br>
interrupter units can also be arranged within a common<br>
encapsulating housing.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the interrupter unit 1 installed in an<br>
encapsulating housing 11. The figure shows the first current<br>
path section 8 and the second current path section 9 and part<br>
of the insulating material nozzle 7. Assemblies provided with<br>
the same functions are provided with the same reference<br>
numerals in the figures. As a deviation from the interrupter<br>
unit illustrated in figure 1, coupling of the current path<br>
sections 8, 9 by means of insulating rods 10a, b has been<br>
dispensed with. This makes it possible for the two current path<br>
sections 8, 9 to rotate independently of one another. The two<br>
halves of the interrupter unit 1 are stabilized and supported<br>
via the insulating material nozzle 7. The interrupter unit 1 is<br>
arranged within the encapsulating housing 11 in a manner in<br>
which it is mounted such that it can rotate. The axis of<br>
rotation in this case runs through the contact pieces, which<br>
are positioned axially opposite one another. A rotary movement<br>
of a first drive device 12 is coupled into the interior of the<br>
housing via a transmission. By means of the first drive device<br>
12, the first current path section 8 can be rotated when the<br>
encapsulating housing 11 is closed. Likewise, the second<br>
current path section 9 can be rotated in the interior of the<br>
encapsulating housing 11 via a second drive device 13 and a<br>
transmission arrangement. By means of a third drive device 14,<br>
an axial movement can be transferred at least to the first<br>
contact piece 2 and the first rated current contact piece 4 via<br>
a drive rod 6. A relative movement between the first contact<br>
piece 2 and the second contact piece 3 can thus be produced.<br><br>
A first connection contact 15 is arranged on the first current<br>
path section 8, and a second connection contact 16 is arranged<br>
on the second current path section 9. The connection contacts<br>
15, 16 protrude radially outwards from the axial direction of<br>
the interrupter unit 1 (see cross-sectional illustration). Each<br>
of the connection contacts 15, 16 has a stationary first mating<br>
contact 17a,b and a stationary second mating contact 18a,b<br>
associated with it. For example, busbars, electrical lines,<br>
outdoor bushings or similar devices for supplying an electrical<br>
current can be connected to the stationary mating contacts<br>
17a,b; 18a,b. The current can be transmitted through the<br>
encapsulating housing 11, which is manufactured from<br>
electrically conductive material, via electrically insulating<br>
regions. A ground potential is applied to the encapsulating<br>
housing 11. As can be seen from the cross-sectional<br>
illustration in figure 2, the stationary mating contacts 17a,b;<br>
18a,b are in the form of elastically deformable slot-shaped<br>
contacts, with the result that, in the event of a rotation of<br>
the interrupter unit 1 or of the first current path section 8<br>
ahd/or of the second current path section 9, the connection<br>
contacts 15, 16, which are in the form of blade contacts, can<br>
be moved into the mating contacts 17a,b; 18a,b. It is also<br>
possible for the blade contacts and mating contacts to be<br>
replaced by one another or else for other forms of contacts to<br>
be used. In addition, provision may be made for grounding<br>
contacts 19a,b to be connected to the grounded encapsulating<br>
housing 11. The grounding contacts 19a,b, when the connection<br>
contacts 15, 16 are moved in, allow for the first current path<br>
section 8 and the second current path section 9 to be grounded.<br>
In the case of a, for example, sector-shaped design of the<br>
connection contacts 15, 16 and in the case of a corresponding<br>
arrangement of the mating contacts, it is furthermore possible<br>
to carry out an interruption-free changeover from one mating<br>
contact to another mating contact. This is<br><br>
particularly	adv+antageous when an interruption-free busbar<br>
replacement needs to be carried out. Owing to the first and<br>
second drive	device 12, 13, which operate independently of one<br>
another, the	two current path sections 8, 9, which each belong<br>
to one half	of the contact system and are each electrically<br>
conductively	connected to this half, can move independently of<br>
one another.<br>
Figure 3 shows an application of the interrupter unit known<br>
from figure 2. A first busbar 20 and a second busbar 21 are<br>
flange-connected to the circuit breaker. It is possible to make<br>
contact alternatively with the first busbar 20 or the second<br>
busbar 21 via the first connection contact 15. It is possible<br>
to connect alternatively a first cable 22 and a second cable 23<br>
via the second connection contact 16. Optionally, it is now<br>
possible to supply the first busbar 20 or the second busbar 21<br>
via the first cable 22 or the second cable 23. The respective<br>
incoming cable feeder or outgoing busbar feeder can in this<br>
case be connected via the interrupter unit. Instead of the<br>
cables, other terminals such as, for example, an outdoor<br>
bushing, transformer terminals etc. can also be used.<br>
Figure 4 shows a modification of the circuit breaker<br>
arrangement shown in figure 3. In figure 4, the known circuit<br>
breaker is in the form of a dead tank circuit breaker. A first<br>
outdoor bushing 24 and a second outdoor bushing 25 are flange-<br>
connected to the first mating contacts 17a,b. Fo.r example,<br>
overhead lines can easily be connected to the interrupter unit<br>
1 via the outdoor bushings 24, 25. Isolating points can be<br>
formed to the outdoor bushings 24, 25 by means of the first<br>
connection contact 15 and the second connection contact 16.<br>
Given<br><br>
corresponding wiring, for example, for making electrical<br>
contact between the first connection contact 15 and the mating<br>
contact 17a and the closed contact system of the interrupter<br>
unit, the second connection contact 16 can be moved into a<br>
grounding point. This makes it possible to ground a conductor<br>
path to.the circuit breaker.<br>
Figure .5 shows a second variant of a high-voltage circuit<br>
breaker 100. The high-voltage circuit breaker 100 has a<br>
modified interrupter unit 101. The interrupter unit 101 also<br>
has a first current path section 108 and a second current path<br>
section 109. The first current path section 108 and the second<br>
current path section 109 are mounted such that they can rotate,<br>
as known from the previous examples. In addition, the first<br>
current path section 108 and the second current path section<br>
109 are also axially displaceable independently of one another.<br>
This makes it possible to displace the first connection contact<br>
115, arranged on the first current path section 108, and the<br>
second connection contact 116, arranged on the second current<br>
path section 109, along the main axis of the interrupter unit<br>
101 as well. As a result, the option for making contact with<br>
the connection contacts 115, 116 is extended. It is now<br>
possible to arrange a large number of stationary mating<br>
contacts in several planes radially around the interrupter unit<br>
101. When' a rotary movement and an axial movement are<br>
superimposed, the connection contacts can also be moved on a<br>
helical movement path. Furthermore, provision may be made for a<br>
plurality of connection contacts 115, 116 to be arranged on at<br>
least one of the current path sections 108, 109, with the<br>
result that it is possible to produce a relatively high number<br>
of circuit variants. In this case, provision may further be<br>
made for the mating contacts to provide for a move-in<br>
direction, for example,<br><br>
also in an axial or inclined direction, with the result that it<br>
is possible to make contact only given a specific rotary<br>
movement and/or axial movement of the interrupter unit 101 or<br>
of the first current path section 108 or of the second current<br>
path section 109. A rotary movement can be produced - as known<br>
from figure 1 -via separate drives. However, provision may also<br>
■ be made for a drive 117 to be provided for the axial<br>
displacement of the entire interrupter unit or else only one of<br>
the current path sections 109. For example, an axial<br>
displacement can be carried out via a spindle gear mechanism.<br>
At the same time, a rotary movement of the second current path<br>
section 109 could be forced via a corresponding link guide.<br>
Alternatively, provision may also be made for only one of these<br>
two movements to be transferred to the second current path<br>
section 109. Furthermore, provision may also be made for the<br>
drive rod 106, which is provided for driving the contact pieces<br>
of the interrupter unit 101, to be provided for transferring an<br>
axial movement to the entire interrupter unit 101 or to only<br>
the first current path section 108. Provision may thus be<br>
made, for example, in the case of a connection operation, for<br>
first a movement of the interrupter unit 101 or of the first<br>
current path section 108 to take place and then a movement of<br>
the contact pieces to occur. Furthermore; provision may also be<br>
made for the drive rod 106 to be designed such that it is<br>
caused to carry out a rotary movement. Via this rotary<br>
movement, for example, a rotary movement of the interrupter<br>
unit 101 or of the first current path section 108 can be<br>
produced. Furthermore, it is also possible, via the rotary<br>
movement, for an axial displacement of the interrupter unit 101<br>
or of the first current path section 108 to take place.<br><br>
