COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10)<br><br>
DOSAGE FORM FOR TREATMENT OF DIABETES MELL1TUS.<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA,<br>
ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA,<br>
INDIA.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
DOSAGE FORM FOR TREATMENT OF DIABETES MELL1THS.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a unit dosage form for the treatment of<br>
diabetes mellitns and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus. The dosage form comprising a<br>
biguanidc in a delayed release form and a sulfonyl urea in an immediate release form. More<br>
particularly.'the present invention relates to a process for preparing a unit dosage form that<br>
immediately releases a sulfonyl urea after administration of the dosage form about 30 minutes<br>
prior to meals, and releases a biguanidc at the time the meal is taken or at a predetermined time<br>
after the meal is taken.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mcflitus (NIDDM). also known as maturity-onset diabetes or<br>
diabetes mellitus type 2. is a frequent metabolic disease and the main cause of hypcrglyccmia. It<br>
is a heterogeneous disease with complex, unclarificd metabolic aspects. Insulin secretion may<br>
appear normal or even excessive, but it is insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance. The<br>
disease is characterized by three main abnormalities of metabolism contributing to<br>
hypcrglyccmia. These include the partial or complete decrease in insulin secretion, resistance of<br>
the peripheral tissues to insulin and increased hepatic production of glucose in fasting conditions.<br>
Diet and physical exercise cause a reduction in insulin-resistance and lead to an improvement in<br>
the pancreas deficit over a period of time.<br>
When these provisions arc not sufficient, a pharmacological agent needs to be taken for control of<br>
hypcrglyccmia. Sulfonyl ureas and biguanidc derivatives have been used in diabetes therapy. The<br>
use of these classes of compounds in monotherapy has been effective in obtaining a<br>
glycometabolic control in diabetic patients.<br>
Biguanidc derivatives like metformin, phcnformin and buformin, generally in the form of their<br>
hydrochloride salt, have been used as anti-hyperglycemic agents in the treatment of non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of action of the drugs belonging to this class<br>
includes reduction in hepatic glucose production, decrease in intestinal absorption of glucose, and<br>
increase in glucose uptake and utilization. Biguanidcs improve glucose tolerance in patients with<br>
diabetes mellitus type 2, lowering both basal and post-prandial plasma glucose. With biguanidc<br>
therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma<br>
insulin response may actually decrease. Although phenformin is still used widely as an anti-<br>
2<br><br>
hyperglycemic agent, metformin is (he preferred biguanide, as it exerts a better normoglycenuc<br>
action with a lower risk of lactic acidosis - a common side-effect with phenformin therapy.<br>
Metformin is also known to lower blood triglyceride levels and assist in weight reduction.<br>
The sulfonyl ureas used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 include acetohexamide,<br>
carbutamide, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide (glibenclamide), glimepiride, gliclazide,<br>
glibomuride, gliquidone, glisoxepid, glyhexamide, phenbutamide, tolazamide, tolbutamide,<br>
tolcyclamide, etc. These sulfonyl ureas are used as their bases and not as salts. The mechanism of<br>
action of these drugs involves lowering of blood glucose concentration mainly by stimulating<br>
release of endogenous insulin from beta cells of the pancreas, and thus they act as hypoglycemic<br>
agents. The sulfonyl ureas are used as an adjunct to diet for the management of non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus in patients whose hyperglycemia cannot be controlled by diet alone.<br>
To achieve maximum reduction in post-prandial blood-glucose concentration, the sulfonyl urea is<br>
administered 30 minutes prior to each meal.<br>
The 55th edition of the Physicians* Desk Reference, copyright 2001, suggests that the<br>
monotherapy with metformin hydrochloride, commercially available under the trade name<br>
Glucophage® from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., may be effective in patients who have not<br>
responded to sulfonyl ureas or who have only a partial response to sulfonyl ureas or who have<br>
ceased to respond to sulfonyl ureas. In such patients, if adequate glycemic control is not attained<br>
with Glucophage® monotherapy, the combination of Glucophage® and a sulfonyl urea may have a<br>
synergistic effect. Also, monotherapy with the sulfonyl ureas has been found to give a positive<br>
response, which lasts for 4-5 years, but it becomes ineffective in a large number of patients over a<br>
period of time. This is referred to as the "secondary failure" associated with the oral therapy with<br>
hypoglycemic agents. In both these cases, a combination of biguanides and sulfonyl ureas is used.<br>
The biguanides are able to act on insulin resistance but cannot stimulate insulin secretion, while<br>
the sulfonyl ureas can stimulate insulin release but are unable to act on insulin resistance. A<br>
combination therapy of a biguanide and a sulfonyl urea has a synergistic effect on glucose<br>
control, since both agents act by different but complementary mechanisms.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,922,769 (769) claims a method of treating non-insulin dependent<br>
diabetes mellitus in cases of secondary failure comprising administering to the subject in need of<br>
the same a combination of glibenclamide and metformin, expressed as the hydrochloride, in a<br>
weight ratio higher than 1:100. The patent also discloses the results of a clinical study, which<br><br>
3<br><br>
indicates that the maximum dose of glibenclamide, which does not cause any side-effects, is<br>
15 nig/day, while that for met form in is 1500 mg/day, and that the use of such a combination in a<br>
ratio lower than that claimed would result in formulations that do not attain the optimum<br>
therapeutic effect. The patent claims the combination of glibenclamide and metformin in a tablet<br>
form. The patent does not disclose a formulation wherein the sulfonyl urea will be released<br>
immediately and the biguanide will be released after a delay period, particularly after a<br>
predetermined delay period.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,031,004 C004) discloses the use of a combination of novel salts of<br>
metformin and glyburide, in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. In this invention, both<br>
metformin salt and glyburide are released immediately.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,099,862 ('862) claims a controlled release pharmaceutical tablet which<br>
consists essentially of (a) a core consisting essentially of: (i) metformin or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, (ii) glipizide, (Hi) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and (iv) sodium lauryl sulfate, (b)<br>
optionally a seal coat around the core, (c) a semipermeable membrane coating covering said core<br>
comprising - (i) cellulose acetate, (ii) polyethylene glycol with an average molecular weight<br>
between 380 and 420, and (iii) a plasticiser, and (d) at least one passageway in the semipermeable<br>
membrane to allow the release of the metformin and glipizide from the core to the environment of<br>
use to provide therapeutic levels of metformin and glipizide from twelve to twenty-four hour<br>
periods. With the administration of controlled release tablets, steady state plasma levels are<br>
achieved and thus effective levels are already present when a dose is administered. On the other<br>
hand, when immediate release tablets such as those of the above mentioned patents, i.e. '004 and<br>
769 patents or the present invention, are given, the effective plasma levels should be obtained at<br>
a time such that a maximum reduction in post-prandial blood glucose is obtained. In this case,<br>
maximum reduction in post-prandial blood-glucose can be obtained by administering glipizide<br>
about 30 minutes before meals, and hence, an immediate release of glipizide is essential. On the<br>
other hand, metformin is given with food. The systems of the '004 patent and the 769 patent do<br>
not allow release of glipizide 30 minutes before meals and at the same time delay release of<br>
metformin particularly for a predetermined time until or after the meal is ingested. A dosage form<br>
comprising a biguanide and a sulfonyl urea that immediately releases a sulfonyl urea, such as<br>
glipizide, after administration of the dosage form 30 minutes prior to meals, and releases after a<br>
delay, a biguanide, such as metformin, such that the biguanide is released at the time the meal is<br>
taken or at a predetermined time after the meal is taken, would provide optimum clinical benefits.<br>
4<br><br>
A plethora of" prior arts relate to pharmaceutical compositions that release a drug after a delay.<br>
Some prior arts that relate to release of drug after a predetermined time include United States<br>
Patent No 3,247,066; European patent application no 408496A2; United States Patent No.<br>
4,871,549; United States Patent no. 5,229,131; PCT Publication no WO 9918938 and PCT<br>
Publication no WO 074655. All of these relate to systems comprising a core that swells upon<br>
imbibing fluid from the surrounding and a coat that ruptures due to the pressure exerted upon it<br>
by the swelling core. However, none of these prior arts suggest that it would benefit the treatment<br>
of diabetes mellitus by administration of a dosage form comprising a biguanide in a delayed<br>
release form and a sulfonyl urea in an immediate release form. Further they do not disclose or<br>
include an enabling description of a dosage form that immediately releases a sulfonyl urea after<br>
administration of the dosage form about 30 minutes prior to meals and releases a biguanide at the<br>
time the meal is taken or at a predetermined time after the meal is taken. We have found that a<br>
usual difficulty in working with the systems is the variability in the time at which the coat<br>
ruptures. For instance, if in five to ten out of a hundred times the coatings do not open or rupture<br>
at about the predetermined time but open at a significantly prolonged time, then the desired<br>
release at the predetermined time is not achieved reliably. We have found the compositions<br>
wherein the coating reliably opens or'ruptures with low variability in the time of opening or<br>
rupturing to release the biguanide antidiabetic agent.<br>
The prior art thus does not mention any formulations or systems containing combinations of a<br>
biguanide and a sulfonyl urea, wherein the sulfonyl urea is released immediately and the<br>
biguanide is released after a lag period.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of a dosage form<br>
for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus, comprising<br>
a biguanide in a delayed release form and a sulfonyl urea in an immediate release form.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of a dosage<br>
form that immediately releases a sulfonyl urea after administration of the dosage form about 30<br>
minutes prior to meals and releases a biguanide at the time the meal is taken or at a predetermined<br>
time after the meal is taken.<br>
5<br><br>
It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of a<br>
dosage form that immediately releases a sulfonyl urea after administration of the dosage form<br>
about 30 minutes prior to meals and releases a biguanidc at the time the meal is taken or at a<br>
predetermined time after the meal is taken in a reliable maiihcr wherein the variability in time at<br>
which the biguanidc is released is low.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The dosage form is designed to allow immediate release of the sulfonyl urea and a delayed<br>
release of the biguanide antidiabetic agent. Those skilled in the art would realize thai by<br>
immediate release of the sulfonyl urea typically one means that the dosage form is adapted to<br>
release the sulfonyl urea substantially immediately after administration of the dosage form, for<br>
instance or for illustrative purpose, about 80% or more of the total amount of sulfony! urea may<br>
be released in 30 minutes. By delayed release one typically means that release of the biguanide is<br>
delayed after administration of the dosage form, such that not more than about 10% of the total<br>
amount of the biguanide is released in about 30 to about 45 minutes. Thereafter, the dosage form<br>
is adapted to release the biguanide antidiabetic agent substantially immediately, for instance or<br>
for illustrative purposes, preferably about 70% of the total amount of the biguanide may be<br>
released in about 150 minutes.<br>
Examples of biguanide antidiabetic agents that may be used in the present invention include<br>
metformin, phenformin and buformin, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Examples of sulfonyl ureas that may be used in the present invention include acelohexamide,<br>
carbutamide, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide (glibenelamide), glimepiride, gliclazide,<br>
glibomuride, gliqmdone, glisoxepid, glyhexamide, phenbutamide, tolazamide, tolbutamidc,<br>
tolcyclamide, and the like.<br>
The invention covers any dosage form in which the first biguanide composition and the second<br>
sulfonyl urea composition are physically separated, or compartmentalized, so as to achieve<br>
different release rates of the two drugs. Such separation, or compartmentalization, may be on a<br>
macro-scale, for instance, with the different drugs being incorporated into separate units (such as<br>
tablets, powder, granules, pellets etc) for simultaneous or sequential administration, or separation<br>
of the two drugs may be on a micro-scale, for instance, with the two drugs being present within<br>
the same unit. Two separate units when present are formed into a single unit dosage form by<br>
filling them into capsules.<br>
In the dosage form of the present invention, the first and second composition may be in the form<br>
of either multiparticulates such as particles, pellets or granules, or present as concentric or<br>
laminar tablet layers or as single units such as a compressed tablet. The multiparticulaies may be<br>
7<br><br>
obiaincd by any of the conventional methods, including mixing, granulation, extrusion,<br>
sphcronisation. layering of non-parcil seeds, etc, and various other methods known to a person<br>
skilled in the art, A compressed tablet core may be obtained by compressing the mutiparticulates<br>
in a tablet die. The first composition is surrounded by a delayed release coating comprising<br>
delayed release material selected from the group consisting of enteric polymers, water insoluble<br>
polymers, hydrophobic compounds, hydrophilic" non-polymeric compounds, hydrophilic<br>
polymers and the like, using conventional coating methods. The coated multiparticulates or<br>
tablets of flic first biguanide composition and the uncoatcd multiparticulates or tablets of the<br>
second sulfonyl urea composition, may be filled into capsules. Alternatively, tablets of the first<br>
biguanide composition may be surrounded by the second sulfonyl urea composition and<br>
compressed in a compression coating tablet machine, or a second layer of the sulfonyl urea<br>
composition may be compressed onto the compressed biguanide composition to form bilayer<br>
tablets.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the dosage form prepared comprises a spaced<br>
drug delivery system wherein the first composition is a timed release composition that releases<br>
the biguanide antidinbelic agent after a predetermined time spacing or interval after<br>
administration of the dosage form. Thus, the biguanide is released at a predetermined time<br>
spacing or interval after the immediate release of the sulfonyl urea from the second composition.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the spaced drug delivery system, the first timed release<br>
composition comprises a core comprising a biguanide antidiabetic agent, a swelling agent, and<br><br>
optionally water soluble compound(s) for inducing osmosis, and a timed release coat comprising<br>
one or more film forming polymers. The method of obtaining the spaced drug delivery system of<br><br>
the present invention comprises mixing the biguanide with the polymeric swelling agent and<br>
optionally the water soluble compound(s) for inducing osmosis and other pharmaceutically<br>
!	<br>
acceptable adjuvants, and compressing the mixture to obtain a core of the biguanide. This core is<br>
then covered with a layer of the timed release coat using conventional coating methods to obtain<br>
the first timed release biguanide composition.	<br>
In the spaced drug delivery system, the timed release composition imbibes fluids from the<br>
environment of use causing the polymeric swelling agent in the core to swell. The biguanide is<br>
released after the timed release coat ruptures under the influence of mechanical pressure exerted<br>
by the swelling of the polymeric swelling agents present in the tablet	8<br><br>
;orc. The time of rupture of the coat can be controlled by varying (a) the degree and rate of<br>
.welling of the core; (b) the timed release coat composition by using different components and<br>
atios of these components; and (c) the thickness of the coal.<br>
The polymeric swelling agent used in the timed release composition includes one or more<br>
wellable hydrophilic polymers. The quantity or relative proportion of the polymers is subject to<br>
onstderable variation. However, a sufficient quantity of ths material is present in the tablet or<br>
ore to provide, upon uptake of water, a swelling pressure in excess of the cohesive strength of<br>
lie coating surrounding the tablet or core. Preferably, the polymers are employed in the dry state<br>
r in a form that has substantial capacity for water uptake. Examples of swellable hydrophilic<br>
olymers that may be used in the timed release composition as the polymeric swelling agent<br>
iclude vinylpyrrolidone polymers such as povidone, or crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone such as<br>
rospovidone;   cellulose   and   cellulose   derivatives   such   as   microcrystalline   cellulose,<br>
lethylcellulose,    othylcellulose,    hydroxypropylcellulose,    hydroxypropyl    methylceliulose,<br>
arboxyalkyl celluloses or crosslinked carboxyalkylcclluloses and their alkali salts; sodium starch<br>
lycolate, starch and starch derivatives, ion-exchange resins and mixtures thereof Preferably, one<br>
f the swelling agents used is selected from the group consisting of crosslinked sodium<br>
irboxymethyl cellulose, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium starch glycolate.<br>
he alkali salt of crosslinked carboxyalkyl cellulose, i.e. crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl<br>
;llulose, also known as croscarmellose sodium or Ac-Di-Sol, is available commercially as<br>
ymcel® ZSX, Pharmacel® XL, Primellose® or Solutab®. Th$ amount of swelling agent that may<br>
; used is dependent on the desired time of rupture of the timed release coat, nature and amounts<br>
"other components in the core, as well as the composition and thickness of the coat. Generally,<br>
oscarmellose sodium may be used as the polymeric swelling agent, in an amount ranging from<br>
wut 0.5% to about 50% by weight of the core, preferably from about 2% to about 40% by<br>
sight of the core, more preferably from about 5% to about 20% by weight of the core. In<br>
ecific preferred embodiments the croscarmellose sodium is used in a range from about 6% to<br>
out 10% by weight of the core, more preferably from about 7% to about 9% by weight of the<br>
ire.<br>
nyl pyrrolidone polymers or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), a|so referred to as Povidone, are<br>
nthetic polymers consisting essentially of linear l-vinyl-2-pyrr0|jdinone groups, the degree of<br>
lymerization of which results in polymers of various molecular weights, the molecular weight<br>
9<br><br>
ranging between 2500 and 3,000.000 Daltons. PVP is commercially available as Kollidon*'<br>
(BASF), Plasdone® and Peristone*' (General Aniline). PVP is classified into different grades on<br>
the basis of its viscosity in aqueous solution. Different grades of PVP available are PVP K-12,<br>
PVP K-I5, PVP K-17, PVP K-25. PVP K-30, PVP K-60, PVP K-90 and PVP K-120. The K-<br>
vnlue referred to in the above nomenclature is calculated from the viscosity of the PVP in<br>
aqueous solution, relative to that of water. Crospovidone or cross-PVP, the synthetic crosslinked<br>
homopolymer of N-vinyl-2-pyrroIidinone, may also be used as a swellable hydrophilic polymer.<br>
It is commercially available as Kollidon CL and Polyplasdone XL, and has a molecular weight<br>
higher than 1,000,000 Daltons. Crospovidone is used in an amount ranging from about 2% to<br>
about 5% by weight of the core. The preferred vinyl pyrrolidone polymer for use as a swellable<br>
hydrophilic polymer is PVP K-30, having an approximate molecular weight of 50,000 Daltons. It<br>
may be used in an amount ranging from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight of the core, more<br>
preferably from about 1% to about 2% by weight of the core.<br>
Sodium starch glycolate, the sodium salt of carboxymethyl ether of starch, may also be used as<br>
the polymeric swelling agent. It has a molecular weight ranging between 500,000 and 1,000,000<br>
Daltons, and is commercially available as Explotab and Primojel. Sodium starch glycolate may be<br>
used in the present invention in an amount ranging from about 0.5% to about 40% by weight of<br>
the core, preferably from about 2% to about 40% by weight of the core, more preferably from<br>
about 2% to about 10% by weight of the core.<br>
Water-soluble compounds suitable for inducing osmosis, i.e. osmotic agents or osmogents are<br>
generally used in the core of the timed release composition when the drug itself does not exert<br>
sufficient osmotic pressure in order to imbibe fluid from the surroundings. Osmogents that may<br>
be present in the core of the timed release composition include all pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
and pharmacologically inert water-soluble compounds referred to in the pharmacopoeias such as<br>
United States Pharmacopoeia, as well as in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,<br>
edition 20, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia (2000). Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
water-soluble salts of inorganic or organic acids, or non-ionic organic compounds with high water<br>
solubility, e.g. carbohydrates such as sugar, or amino acids, are generally preferred. The examples<br>
of agents used for inducing osmosis include inorganic salts such as magnesium chloride or<br>
magnesium sulfate, lithium, sodium or potassium chloride, lithium, sodium or potassium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, lithium, sodium or potassium dihydrogen phosphate, salts of organic acids<br>
such as sodium or potassium acetate, magnesium succinate, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate or<br>
10<br><br>
sodium ascorbate; carbohydrates such as mannitol, sorbitol, arabinose, ribose, xylose, glucose,<br>
fructose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, laclose. raffmose; water-soluble amino acids such<br>
as glycine, leucine, alanine, or methionine; urea and the like, and mixtures thereof. The amount ol"<br>
osmogents that may be used depends on the particular osmogent that is used and may range from<br>
about 1% to about 60% by weight of the core.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the core of the timed release composition further comprises a wicking<br>
agent. Materials suitable for use as wicking agents in the timed release composition and include,<br>
but are not limited to, colloidal silicon dioxide, kaolin, titanium dioxide, fumed silicon dioxide,<br>
alumina, sodium lauryl sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, low molecular weight polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and the like.<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) is used in the preferred embodiment as the wicking agent. It is<br>
made up of a chain of about 250 glucose molecules in the form of a microcrystal, consisting<br>
primarily of crystallite aggregates obtained by removing amorphous regions of a pure cellulose<br>
source material by hydrolytic degradation using mineral acid. MCC has an average molecular<br>
weight of about 36,000 Daltons and is available in various grades, which differ in bulk density,<br>
particle size and moisture content. It is commercially available as Vivapur®, Avicel®, Vivacel®,<br>
Emcocel®, Fibrocel® and Tabulose®. Avicel® PH 102, having a mean particle size of lOO/i m, i.e.<br>
8% or less of the particles are retained on a # 60 sieve (as defined by ASTM, American Society<br>
for Testing and Materials), and 45% or more of the particles are retained on a #200 sieve (as<br>
defined by ASTM), and having a moisture content 
of the timed release composition, in an amount ranging from about 2% to about 5% by weight of<br>
the core, more preferably from about 2% to about 3% by weight of the core.<br>
In addition to the above ingredients, the biguanide-containing core of the timed release<br>
composition may optionally contain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binders,<br>
disintegrants, lubricants and the like. Examples of binders used commonly include starch, gelatin,<br>
sugars like sucrose, glucose, dextrose, molasses and lactose; acacia, sodium alginate, cellulose<br>
derivatives like methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and the like; polymers<br>
such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Veegum, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like.<br>
Examples of lubricants that may be used in the timed release composition include talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, aluminium stearate, stearic acid, hydrogenated vegetable<br>
11<br><br>
oils, colloidal silicon dioxide, polyethylene glycol, cellulose derivatives such as carboxyalkyl<br>
cellulose and ils alkali salts, or mixtures thereof. Hydrophobic or water insoluble lubricants may<br>
reduce the water imbibing properties of the core whereas hydrophilic or water soluble lubricants<br>
do not, and are preferred. A more preferred lubricant is colloidal silicon dioxide. A mixture of<br>
colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearaic may be used as the preferred lubricant. More<br>
preferred embodiments use a combination of microcrystalline cellulose and colloidal silicon<br>
dioxide as the wicking agents with colloidal silicon dioxide also functioning as a lubricant.<br>
Colloidal silicon dioxide is available commercially as Aerosil® from Degussa-Huls, Nippon and<br>
Fischer GmbH. The preferred colloidal silicon dioxide lubricant is Aerosil® 200, with an<br>
approximate external surface area of 200m2/g. The colloidal silica may be used in amounts in the<br>
range of about 0.5 % to about 5% by weight of the core.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process of making the timed release composition, the biguanide<br>
and the polymeric swelling agent are sifted and mixed with the binder in a rapid mixer gramriator<br>
ajid granulated. In more preferred embodiments of the present invention only a part of the total<br>
polymeric swelling agent is included in the composition, and the remaining is mixed at the<br>
lubrication stage with the dried granules. Water is the preferred granulating agent. The granules<br>
thus obtained are wei milled through a screen and then dried in a fluidised bed drier at 40-50°C to<br>
a moisture content of 2-3%. The dried granules are then milled through a 2mm screen and arc<br>
mixed with one or more lubricants and the wicking agent. In more preferred embodiments, as<br>
described above, the remaining part of the polymeric swelling agent is mixed at this stage. The<br>
lubricated granules may be filled into hard gelatin capsules, or may be compressed to obtain the<br>
compressed tablets or cores.<br>
The biguanide-containing compressed cores are covered with a timed release coat comprising one<br>
or more film forming polymers. The film forming polymers that may be used to form this timed<br>
release coat are selected from the group consisting of water insoluble polymers, pH dependent<br>
polymers, and mixture of water soluble and water insoluble polymers. Examples of film forming<br>
polymers that may be used include cellulose ester derivatives like methyl cellulose, ethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose<br>
acetate phthalate, pH-independent copoiymers of methacrylic acid and methacrylic acid esters<br>
commercially available as Eudragit®, or mixtures thereof. The time of release of the biguanide<br>
may be varied by varying the components used to form the timed release coat, and/or by varying<br>
the ratio in which these components are used. By selecting the suitable components and by using<br>
12<br><br>
them in suitable ratios, the biguanide release can be obtained at a predetermined time after oral<br>
administration of the dosage form. A preferred embodiment of the invention uses a mixture of<br>
ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) to form the delayed release coat. The<br>
mixture is used in n preferred weight ratio of 0:20 to 20:0 of ethyl cellulose : HPMC, more<br>
preferably 6:3 to 9:?.<br>
The coating agents are dispersed in a solvent or solvent system, and the solution or dispersion so<br>
obtained is used to coat the biguanide-containing cores. Various solvents and mixtures of solvents<br>
can be used to provide the coating agent solution or dispersion. Some of the preferred solvents<br>
include water, halogen hydrocarbons like trichloroethylene, methylene chloride<br>
(dichloromethane), carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform; alcohols such as absolute alcohol,<br>
isopropanol and methanol; low molecular weight esters like ethyl acetate and amyl acetate; and<br>
ketones such as acetone, 2-butanone and the like. A preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention uses a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol in a preferred ratio of 1:10 to 10:1 of<br>
dichloromethane : methanol, more preferably in a ratio of about 3:1 to about 6:1.<br>
The compressed cores/capsules containing the biguanide are coated with the coating solution to a<br>
defined weight gain, the thickness of the coat depending on the predetermined time of biguanide<br>
release. The coating material may be applied by any procedure which provides a continuous film<br>
of essentially uniform thickness. One method of coating involves rotating a bed of uncoated cores<br>
in a conventional tablet coating pan and applying a solution or dispersion of the coating agent in a<br>
suitable solvent by pouring or spraying the solution onto the moving cores. Other coating<br>
procedures such as fluid bed coating, vertical spray coating, and the like can also be employed.<br>
The coated cores are dried by exposing them to warm, dry air and may be cured, if necessary, by<br>
air drying, baking or force drying. In one embodiment of the present invention, the compressed<br>
core is coated with a ethyl cellulose : HPMC solution to a weight gain in the range of about 2% to<br>
about 20% by weight of the compressed core, preferably from about 5% to about 10% by weight<br>
of the core; more preferably from about 9% to about 10% by weight of the compressed core. The<br>
cores are coated in an automated perforated coating pan followed by drying and curing of the<br>
coated cores in a tray drier for 24 hours at 40-50°C.<br>
The first timed release biguanide composition in the form of tablets/capsules and the second<br>
sulfonyl urea composition in the form of multiparticulates or tablets may be filled into capsules.<br>
Alternatively, tablets of (he first timed release biguanide composition may be surrounded by the<br>
13<br><br>
second sulfonyl urea composition and compressed in a compression coating tablet machine to<br>
obtain a single unit dose form with timed release biguanide core composition and an immediate<br>
release sulfony! urea coat composition. The second sulfonyl i'rea composition may be included in<br>
the spaced drug delivery system of the present invention in different ways. Multipaniculates of<br>
sulfonyl urea may be obtained by mixing the sulfonyl ure
excipients, such as binders, fillers, disintegrants and the like, pr by further granulating the mixture<br>
using water as the preferred granulating agent. The granules po obtained are dried and lubricated<br>
with one or more lubricants.<br>
In one embodiment of the spaced drug delivery system of (He present invention, the immediate<br>
release sulfonyl urea layer is introduced by mixing the ?ulfonyl urea with pharmaceutical<br>
adjuvants such as film-forming agents, plasticisers and the like, in a suitable solvent or solvent<br>
system, and coating the biguanide-containing timed release composition, using conventional<br>
coating methods known to a person skilled in the art. Examples ol THm-Ibrrrimg agents that may<br>
be used in the present invention along with the sulfonyl urea include cellulose derivatives such as<br>
cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, microcrystatline cellulose,<br>
methacrylic acid/methacrylate esiers, polyvinyl acetate phthal^e, shellac and the like, or mixtures<br>
thereof. Hydroxypropyl methyTcellulose (HPMC) is used z$ the preferred film-forming agent<br>
along with the sulfonyl urea in the present invention, in an amount ranging from about 2% to<br>
about 20% by weight of the biguanide-containing timed release composition, more preferably<br>
from about 2% to about 5% by weight of the core. Examples of plasticisers that may be used in<br>
the present invention include, but are not limited to glyceroL propylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol, sorbitol, triacetin, diethyl phthalate, mineral oil, petrolatum, lanolin and the like. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 is used as the<br>
plasticiser in an amount ranging from 0% .to about 5% by weight of the core, more preferably<br>
from about 0.1 % to about 1 % by weight of the core. The sulfoPyl urea, HPMC arid PEG 4000 are<br>
mixed in a solvent system comprising a mixture of isopropariol and dichloromethane in a ratio<br>
ranging from 0:10 to 10:0, more preferably from 1:5 to 5:1. Tl^ solution thus obtained is used to<br>
coat the biguanide-containing core to a desired weight gain, in a conventional tablet coating pan.<br>
The tablets are then dried in a tray drier at a temperature of 40'50°C for 24 hours.<br>
The following examples do not limit the scope of the invention and are presented as illustrations.<br>

The immediate release sulfonyl urea granules were obtained by sifting glipizide, lactose<br>
monohydrate and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and sodium starch glycolate through a # 40<br>
sieve (as defined by American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM) and blending the<br>
powders suitably. A solution of PVP K-30 in water was used to granulate the dry powder blend.<br>
The granules thus obtained were dried to a moisture content of not more than 3%. These granules<br>
were then passed through a # 25 sieve (as defined by ASTM). The granules were finally mixed<br>
with talc and magnesium stearate to obtain the final granules. The method of preparation of the<br>
delayed release biguanide core included sifting the metformin hydrochloride and croscarmellose<br>
sodium through a suitable sieve and mixing them in a rapid mixer granulator. The dry powder<br>
blend was then granulated using 3 0% starch paste, followed by wet milling the wet mass through<br>
a Fitz mill. The granules so obtained were dried to a moisture content of 3-4%. The dry granules<br>
are then milled in a Fitz mill through a 1.5mm screen, followed by sifting of the granules through<br>
a # 16 sieve (as defined by ASTM). These granules of metformin hydrochloride were then mixed<br>
15<br><br>
with MCC, colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate, and the lubricated mixture thus<br>
obtained was compressed on a rotary compression machine using oblong shaped punches. The<br>
tablets were then coated in a conventional coating pan using a solution of ethyl cellulose and<br>
HPMC in a mixture-of melhanol and didiloromethane.-<br>
The delayed release biguanide core was then mixed with 75mg of the immediate release sulfonyl<br>
urea granules and encapsulated in a size '0' hard gelatin capsule. The delayed release biguanide<br>
composition and 75mg of sulfonyl urea granules were subjected to dissolution studies using pH<br>
6.8 buffer at 37±0.5°C, in a USP Type II apparatus (rpm = 75). The release profile for metfonnin<br>
is recorded in Table 2 below, while that for glipizide is recorded in Table 3 below.-The opening<br>
time of the timed release coating on the biguanide core was observed for 30 tablets, which were<br>
subjected to dissolution testing. It was found that all the tablets opened reliably at about 1 hour to<br>
about 1.3 hour after start of the dissolution test.<br><br>

The method of preparation of the dosage form involves the following steps. Metformin<br>
hydrochloride, PVP K-90 and a part of the Ac-Di-Sol were sifted and mixed in a rapid mixer<br>
granulator for 10 minutes. This mixture was then granulated with sufficient quantity of purified<br>
water and the granules thus obtained were wet miffed through a #10 sieve (as defined by<br>
American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM). These granules were then dried in a<br>
fiuidized bed drier at a temperature of 40-50°C, to moisture content of 2-3%. The dried granules<br>
were again passed-through a #20 sieve (as defined by American Society for Testing and<br>
Materials, ASTM). The sifted granules were mixed with magnesium stearate and the remaining<br>
pan of the Ac-Di-Sol, in a double cone blender, followed by compression on a rotary<br>
compression machine using suitable punches to obtain the cores. A solution of ethyl" cellulose<br>
(Ethocel STD-10) and HPMC (E5 LV grade) in a solvent system containing a 4:1 mixture of<br>
18<br><br>
dichloromethane and methanol, was (hen used to coat the compressed cores to a weight gain of<br>
8% by weight of the compressed cores, in a perforated coating pan. The tablets were then dried in<br>
a tray drier at 40-50°C for 24 hours. Glipizide. HPMC (E5 LV grade) and PEG 4000 were then<br>
dissolved in a J:3 mixture of isopropano) and dichloromethane to obtain a solution, which was<br>
loaded on the dried polymer-coated tablets to a weight gain of 5% w/w. The tablets were again<br>
dried in a tray drier at 40-50°C for 24 hours after glipizide-loading, and a (op color coat was<br>
applied to the tablets using a solution of a pharmaceutical ly acceptable color with HPMC (E5 LV<br>
grade) and PEG 4000 in a 1:3 mixture of isopropanol and dichloromethane. The tablets were<br>
finally dried in tray driers at 40-50°C for 24 hours.<br>
The color-coated tablets so obtained were subjected to dissolution studies using pH 6.8 buffer at<br>
37±0.5°C, in a USP Type II apparatus (rpm = 50). The release profile for metformin is recorded<br>
in Table 5 below, while that for glipizide is recorded in Table 6 below.<br>
