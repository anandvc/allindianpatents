The present application is a continuation-in-part application related to U.S. Application Serial<br>
Number 10/324,561 filed on December 18,2002 and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
Background<br>
The present development relates to a process for enrobing active catalytic materials with a<br>
protective coating to form pastilles, and to an apparatus for making the pastilles. The pastilles are<br>
prepared using a low-shear jacketed blender and a pastillator. The resultant pastilles vary in shape<br>
and have a diameter of from about 2 mm to about 100 mm and a thickness of 1 mm to 10 mm.<br>
Heterogeneous catalysts often include an active phase that is unstable in air. For example,<br>
highly reduced metal crystallites, such as cobalt crystallites having from about a 45% to about 90%<br>
reduction, are pyrophoric and are susceptible to oxidation. Further, the heterogeneous catalyst may<br>
be in the form of a reduced catalyst powder having a catalyst crystallite particle size of from about 50<br>
microns to about 150 microns. This small particle size combined with the catalyst instability in air<br>
can make the catalysts difficult to handle and can create safety hazards when the catalysts are being<br>
loaded into a reactor. Heterogeneous catalysts can also experience a temperature rise from the<br>
internal section of the catalyst which can cause oxidation of the active metal to an inactive metal<br>
oxide. This oxidation is undesirable for the reaction and can cause sintering of the metal on the<br>
catalyst as well. Thus, there is a need to find a means for protecting the reduced metal catalyst.<br>
One common method used to protect the reduced metal catalyst is to form an oxide surface<br>
film on the catalyst by treating the reduced catalyst in a mixture of air and an inert gas. This<br>
procedure must be performed with extreme care because any surge of exotherm will cause sintering<br>
of the metal on the catalyst. Usually, the procedure starts with a very low oxygen concentration in a<br>
largely N2 (or other inert gas) stream; the oxygen concentration is then gradually increased by<br>
increasing air/inert gas ratio over a period of time, typically from about 24 hours to about!50 hours.<br><br>
In addition to the exotherm risks, another disadvantage of using this method for protecting the<br>
catalyst is that a portion of the reduced metal is typically lost due to formation of metal oxides.<br>
A more sophisticated method involves enrobing the reduced catalyst in oxygen impermeable<br>
media such as organic solvents, oils, fats and waxes. The enrobing or coating material works as an<br>
oxygen and moisture barrier to protect the metal being oxidized. By coating the catalyst, it is possible<br>
to stabilize the active material and to make handling the material easier. Further, the enrobing<br>
method allows essentially 100% of the reduced metal to be preserved.<br>
The practice of coating or enrobing the active materials in a protective sheath is well known<br>
in the prior art. As early as 1952, a method for improving the coating of reduced nickel catalysts was<br>
taught in U.S. Patent 2,609,346 (issued to Faulkner on Sept. 2, 1952). In the '346 patent, reduced<br>
nickel, usually containing a promoter, is dispersed in glyceride fat having a melting point from about<br>
105°F up to about 150°F. The mixture of catalyst and fat is melted at a temperature of about 160°F to<br>
about 175°F, and then is cast in a metal form cooled to a temperature of between 50°F and 60°F to<br>
form a block of coated catalyst. Although this method produces an enrobed catalyst, the catalyst / fat<br>
mixture is formed into relatively large shapes that must be rapidly cooled to ensure that the wax is<br>
hardened throughout the block thereby preventing the catalyst from settling.<br>
U.S. Patent 2,842,504 (issued to Jones on July 8, 1958) teaches a different method of coating<br>
a catalyst. In the '504 patent, a nickel-kieselguhr hydrogenation catalyst is coated with a rubbery<br>
polymer. The catalyst is added to a polymer / organic solvent solution and a rubber coat is formed on<br>
the catalyst by driving the organic solvent off. U.S. Patent 3,453,217 (issued to Kozlowski et al on<br>
July 1, 1969) describes a method of treating a catalyst with a liquid hydrocarbon having a boiling<br>
point in the range of 410°F to 1200°F. The hydrocarbon is applied to the catalyst by discharging the<br>
catalyst into a container containing the liquid hydrocarbon and then moving the catalyst out of the<br>
container on a moving belt screen. If the process is carried out properly, the hydrocarbon fills the<br>
micropores of the catalyst. A somewhat different approach is taught in U.S. Patent 6,294,498 (issued<br>
to Darcissac et al on Sep. 25, 2001). In the '498 patent, a catalyst is coated with a protective layer<br><br>
that is "atomized or dispersed on the catalyst by continuously stirring the catalyst and keeping it at a<br>
temperature that is below the crystallization point of the coating material". Alternatively, the coating<br>
material may be in a solution that is "atomized, sprayed or dispersed by continuously stirring the<br>
catalyst at a temperature that is above the boiling point of the solvent of said solution." Each of these<br>
methods result in the application of a protective coating on a catalyst. However, these methods either<br>
require specialized coatings or relatively sophisticated handling to ensure that the coating is deposited<br>
as intended.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present development relates to a process and an apparatus for enrobing an active catalyst<br>
in a protective coating material and making distinct pastilles or flakes. The process comprises<br>
blending, transferring, feeding and pastillation or flaking steps. An essentially constant temperature,<br>
from about 0°F (at the congealing point) to about 50°F above the congealing point of the coating<br>
material, is maintained during the blending, transferring and feeding steps. The temperature is<br>
gradually decreased as the pastilles or flakes proceed through the pastillation or flaking step so that<br>
the discharge temperature from the pastillator or flaker is from about 2°F to about 150°F lower than<br>
the congealing point of the coating material.<br>
The apparatus comprises a low-shearing jacketed blender and a pastillator. The low-shear<br>
jacketed blender allows for gentle mixing action at a controlled constant temperature so that the<br>
catalyst powder is submerged in the coating material in a softened state and the catalyst is uniformly<br>
mixed with the coating material without the catalyst being ground or subjected to attrition. The<br>
mentioned features of the blender are beneficial when a microspherical catalyst powder is used in<br>
fluid bed applications.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The present development relates to a process and an apparatus for applying a protective<br>
coating material over an active catalyst to form pastilles or flakes. According to the invention,<br>
oxygen- or moisture-sensitive catalyst powder is combined with a coating material using a low-shear<br>
jacketed blender, and the catalyst / coating mixture is then processed through a pastillator or flaker.<br>
In the present development, the example blender used is a horizontal blender, but any piece of<br>
equipment that can provide uniform, low-shear mixing may be used. As used herein, unless<br>
otherwise specified, any reference to pastilles or drops, pastillation or pastillator should be interpreted<br>
to apply as well to flakes, flaking or flaker, respectively.<br>
The catalyst is preferably in a powdered, and optionally, reduced form. For example, in an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the catalyst is a highly reduced cobalt crystallite having an average<br>
particle size of from about 1 µ to about 225 µ and preferably from about 3 µ to about 150 µ. The<br>
particle size may range from about 1 µ to about 200 µ the constraint on the upper limit being<br>
determined by the dimensions of the opening to a feed port of the pastillator.<br>
The hydrocarbon compound, or coating material, can be any material that can create an<br>
oxygen- and/or moisture barrier for the catalyst. For example, the hydrocarbon may be selected from<br>
epoxy resin, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, fatty stearates, hydrocarbon resins,<br>
microcrystalline paraffins, paraffin wax, synthetic wax, polyesters, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
waxes, polyglycols, polyvinyl alcohols, polystyrene, vegetable waxes, a wax obtained from processes<br>
using coal, natural gas, bio-mass, or methanol as feedstock, wax blends and combinations thereof. A<br>
preferred coating material is a synthetic wax, such as the wax from a Fischer-Tropsch reaction, that<br>
contains a small amount antioxidant and is essentially free of inorganic contaminants such as sulfur,<br>
chloride and heavy metals.<br>
In the present invention, the coating material is selected based on, among other criteria, its<br>
purity and its ability to form a solid at ambient temperature. Further, the coating material preferably<br>
has a congealing point of from about 110°F to about 250°F, and more preferably from about 150°F to<br><br>
about 225°F. As used herein, the congealing point refers to the hardening or softening characteristics<br>
of the hydrocarbon or coating material. The congealing point is obtained by solidification of liquid<br>
based on ASTM-938 or equivalent methods. The solidification characteristics of wax can also be<br>
expressed as drop melting point (ASTM-3954 and ASTM-D127) or cooling curve (ASTM-D87). The<br>
difference between congealing point and melting point is highly dependent on molecular weight and<br>
molecular weight distribution of the individual hydrocarbon compound. Melting point could be<br>
several degrees higher than congealing point.<br>
According to the invention, the catalyst powder is combined with the coating material using<br>
the low-shear jacketed blender. As is known in the art, the blender with the coating material is<br>
purged with an inert gas and the catalyst powder is then added. If, as is the case with the prior art<br>
enrobed catalysts, the catalyst material is in the form of flakes or generally has a form in which the<br>
density of the catalyst is lower than the density of the coating material, e.g. the density of the catalyst<br>
may be about 0.3 g/cc and the density of the coating material is about 0.7 g/cc, then settling is not a<br>
problem. In the present invention, however, the catalyst may be in the form of particles that generally<br>
have a density greater than density of the coating material, e.g. the density of the catalyst is generally<br>
about 1.2 g/cc and the density of the coating material is about 0.7 g/cc, so that settling can occur if the<br>
wax is not kept in a "semi-solid" state. To maintain the semi-solid state, the temperature of the low-<br>
shear jacketed blender, such as without limitation a Ross horizontal blender (Ross Paddle Blender,<br>
Ross Ribbon Blender or Ross Cylindrical Drier), is heated to and held at a temperature that is from<br>
about 0°F (at the congealing point) to about 50°F above the congealing point of the coating material.<br>
The coating material is manually or automatically fed to the low-shear jacketed blender, as is<br>
known in the art. The coating material does not need to be heated prior to its introduction to the<br>
blender. In the blender, the coating material is heated to a semi-solid state, wherein the material is<br>
softened or molten, but not a liquid. The entire system is then purged with an inert gas, such as N2.<br>
The semi-solid unseparated mixture deposits at the blender end of the pastillator a plurality of drops<br>
or flakes of the mixture.<br><br>
The catalyst powder is then blended into the coating material. The concentration of the<br>
catalyst relative to the coating material can vary depending on the catalyst, the coating material and<br>
the anticipated method of use, and may range in concentration from essentially no catalyst powder<br>
(pure wax pastilles) to concentrations of up to about 65 wt%. In one example, a highly reduced<br>
alumina supported cobalt crystallite having an average particle size of from about 50 µ to about 150 µ<br>
is mixed into a synthetic paraffin wax at an average concentration of about 57 wt% catalyst.<br>
The low shear mixing from the blender combined with proper paddle clearance allows the<br>
reduced catalyst powder to be submerged into the coating material and to be uniformly dispersed<br>
throughout the coating material without grinding or milling of the catalyst. As is known in the art, the<br>
blender includes internal paddles or ribbons that rotate to produce the mixing action. As the paddles<br>
rotate, there is a risk that the catalyst can be ground or milled by the action of the paddles against the<br>
internal wall of the blender. Thus, in the present invention, th'e rotation direction, rotation speed, and<br>
design as well as the clearance between the tips of rotating paddles or ribbons and the interior wall of<br>
the blender is set to minimize the catalyst attrition.<br>
The mixing intensity may vary but should be selected to minimize damage to the catalyst. In<br>
one example, the mixing intensity is set at from about 3 to about 10 revolutions per minute.<br>
Typically, the residence time in the blender is from about 2 minutes to about 120 minutes, and<br>
preferably is from about 2 minutes to about 90 minutes.<br>
After mixing in the blender, the blended material is transferred through piping and by a series<br>
of low shear pumps that each aid in the prevention of material settling and separating until the<br>
blended material is fed into a pastillator, such as the Sandvik Rotoformer Serial 81750/88. The<br>
piping and pumps are jacketed and/or heat-traced to maintain essentially the same temperature as the<br>
blender or a temperature sufficient to maintain the hydrocarbon coating material in the semi-solid or<br>
molten phase. Here, as in the blender, because the catalyst particles being enrobed have a greater<br>
density than the coating material, if the coating material is overheated, it is possible to have the<br>
catalyst settle out of the coating material. Thus, it is a key feature of the development that the<br><br>
temperature be maintained such that the coating material is in the semi-solid state during the transfer<br>
process.<br>
In the pastillator, the catalyst / coating mixture is deposited drop-wise through a feed port by<br>
a Rotoformer onto a steel belt cooler, forming a plurality of pastilles or flakes. The belt cooler carries<br>
the pastilles or flakes a predetermined length across a water cooled bed. Because the belt cooler is<br>
chilled along the majority of its length, by the time the pastilles reach the end of the belt and they are<br>
discharged from the pastillator, the hydrocarbon phase of the pastille has solidified to form distinct<br>
particles of active catalyst powder dispersed within the coating material. The discharge temperature is<br>
preferably from about 2°F to about 150°F lower than the congealing point of the coating material.<br>
The size of the pastilles or flakes to be formed can be modified by altering the size of the<br>
opening from the Rotoformer. Further, the resultant particles can have a variety of shapes, such as<br>
spherical, hemispherical, ellipsoidal, oval, domed, any other shapes known in the art of pastillation,<br>
including flakes, and combinations thereof. The pastilles preferably have a diameter of from about 2<br>
mm to about 100 mm and a thickness of from about 1 mm to about 10 mm.<br>
The pastille preparation method of the present invention is intended for use in enrobing active<br>
catalyst in a protective material. The method differs from the catalyst enrobing methods of the prior<br>
art by allowing relatively large catalyst particles to be enrobed in a hydrocarbon coating. Further, the<br>
present invention provides a method wherein the catalyst particles are essentially unaffected by the<br>
enrobing process, i.e. they are not ground or subject to attrition in the process. The catalysts enrobed<br>
by the method can be used for a number of applications, including but not limited to fluid bed or<br>
slurry bed or bubble column reactor applications.<br>
It is understood that the composition of the pastilles and the specific processing conditions<br>
may be varied without exceeding the scope of this development.<br><br>
