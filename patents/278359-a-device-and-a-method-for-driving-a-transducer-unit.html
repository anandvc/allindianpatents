Audio Transducer System<br>
The present invention relates to efficient audio transducers. More in particular, the present invention relates to a device and method for driving a transducer at a certain frequency, and to a transducer designed to be driven at a certain frequency.<br>
It is well known that audio transducers, such as loudspeakers, have a limited frequency range in which they can faithfully render sound at a certain minimum sound level. High fidelity audio systems typically have relatively small transducers (tweeters) for reproducing the high frequency range, and relatively large transducers (woofers) for reproducing the low frequency range. The transducers required to reproduce the lowest audible frequencies (approximately 20-100 Hz) at a suitable sound level take up a substantial amount of space. Consumers, however, often prefer compact audio sets which necessarily have small transducers.<br>
It has been suggested to solve this problem by using psycho-acoustic phenomena such as 'Virtual pitch". By creating harmonics of low-frequency signal components it is possible to suggest the presence of such signal components without actually reproducing these components. However, this solution is no substitute for actually producing low-frequency ('Isass") signal components.<br>
International Patent Application WO 2005/027569 (Philips) discloses a device for producing a driving signal for a transducer, such as a loudspeaker. The driving signal has a frequency substantially equal to a resonance fiiequency of the transducer. By driving the transducer at a resonance frequency, a very efficient sound reproduction at low frequencies can be achieved. It has been found, however, that to achieve high sound levels at certain resonance frequencies, the displacement of the transducer becomes very large, in some cases even prohibitively large.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a device and method for driving a transducer, arranged for providing high sound levels using a relatively small transducer and relatively small transducer displacements.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for driving a transducer unit comprising at least one transducer and an enclosure in which the at least one transducer<br>
 <br>
is accommodated, the device comprising mapping means for mapping input signal components from a first audio frequency range onto a second audio frequency range,<br>
wherein the second audio frequency range is narrower than the first audio frequency range, and wherein the second frequency range contains the Hehnholtz frequency of the transducer unit.<br>
By mapping a first frequency range onto a second, narrower frequency range, the frequency components of the first frequency range can be reproduced at frequencies where the transducer is most efficient.<br>
By driving the transducer unit at its Hehnholtz frequency, the transducer displacement (the cone displacement in the case of loudspeakers) is minimal while the sound level is high. It is noted that the Helmholtz frequency referred to here is the "anti-resonance" frequency of the transducer when accommodated in an enclosure, and that the dimensions and features of the enclosure, together with the transducer characteristics, determine the Helmholtz frequency.<br>
It is noted that United States Patent Application US 2004/0028246 discloses a loudspeaker device including an acoustic pipe coupled to an acoustic chamber in which a loudspeaker is mounted. The pipe and the chamber constitute a Helmholtz resonator. However, this known device is designed to provide a continuous frequency band from the Helmholtz resonant frequency to the resonant frequency of the acoustic pipe, while the present invention provides a transducer unit designed to be driven in a relatively narrow frquency band which includes the Helmholtz frequency.<br>
It is preferred that the narrow frequency range extends within 5% of the Helmholtz frequency, more preferably within 2%. That is, the second frequency range extends from 95% to 105% of the Helmholtz frequency, but preferably only from 98% to 102% of the Helmholtz frequency.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the driving device of the present invention, the mapping means comprise;<br>
•	a detection unit for detecting first signal components in the first audio frequency range,<br>
•	a generator unit for generating second signal components in the second audio frequency range, and<br>
•	amplitude control means for controlling the amplitude of the second signal components in dependence of the amplitude of the first signal components.<br>
 <br>
Such a driving device allows an efficient mapping of the first frequency range onto the second frequency range.<br>
The present invention also provides a transducer unit for use with the device defined above, the transducer unit comprising at least one transducer and an enclosure in which the at least one transducer is mounted, the enclosure comprising an open-ended tube. It is noted that the tube used in the present invention has at least one opening at one end, while the particular shape of the opening(s) and the particular shape of the tube are not essential. Although the tube is preferred to have a constant diameter, conical tubes may also be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is a well-defined relationship between the volume of the transducer unit and other properties. More in particular, the enclosure preferably defines a volume V1 between the transducer and the tube which volume at least approximately satisfies the equation:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
absence of an enclosure extending between the transducer and the open air. If the transducer unit fulfils this requirement, the efficiency is further enhanced.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the enclosure defines an additional volume V3, which additional volume is substantially closed off, the volumes V1 and V2 preferably being located at opposite sides of the transducer. It is noted that a small leak may be present to equalize the pressure m the volume V2, and that the volumes V1 and V2 may be acoustically coupled by a further tube instead of being located at opposite sides of the transducer.<br>
Advantageously, any edges of the enclosure or of the associated tube are substantially rounded. This prevents any efficiency loss. In addition, it is preferred that substantially no dampling material is present. Furthermore, the open end of the tube may advantageously be provided with a flange.<br>
The present invention also provides a transducer unit which furter comprises a driving device as defined above.<br>
The present invention further provides an audio system, comprising an audio amplifier, at least one transducer and at least one device as defined above, the audio system preferably further comprising a sound source.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of driving a transducer unit comprismg at least one transducer accommodated in an enclosure provided with an open-ended tube, the method comprising the step of mapping an input signal onto a narrow frequency range containing the Hehnholtz frequency of the transducer unit. Preferably, the narrow frequency range extends within 5% of the Helmholtz frequency, preferably within 2%.<br>
The present invention additionally provides a computer program product for carrying out the method as defined above. A computer program product may comprise a set of computer executable instructions stored on a data carrier, such as a CD or a DVD. The set of computer executable instmctions, which allow a programmable computer to carry out the method as defined above, may also be available for downloading from a remote server, for example via the Internet.<br>

The transducer unit 20 shown merely by way of non-limiting example in Fig. 1 compises an enclosure 22 in which a transducer 21, such as a loudspeaker, is mounted. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the enclosure 22 comprises two chambers which define a first volume V1 and a second volume V2 respectively, as well as a tube 23. The volumes Vj and V2 are divided by a partition 26 which supports the transducer 21. The first volume Vj is in open communication with the tube 23, while the second volume V2 is closed. In the embodiment shown the tube 23, which forms an integral part of the enclosure 22, does not project into any chamber, while the transducer feces the tube 23. It will be understood that other arrangements are possible, for example an arrangement in which the transducer 21 faces away from the tube 23,<br>
The tube 23, which has an open end 27, has a length L and an internal cross-sectional surface area S which are chosen to match the Helmholtz frequency of the transducer, as will be explained later in more detail. The surface area S defines the effective<br>
 <br>
radiating surface of the transducer 21, It is noted that the embodiments shown are not necessarily rendered to scale.<br>
In the alternative embodiment of Fig. 2, the enclosure 22 has only a single chamber defining a single volume Vi. In addition, the front of the transducer (typically, the cone of the loudspeaker) 21 faces outwards, away from the tube 23, However, the transducer may also face towards the tube 23.<br>
In both embodiments shown, no damping material is present in the enclosure, and the tube 23 is relatively long while the (first) volume V1 is relatively small. In some embodiments, however, small amounts of damping material may be present, and the relative dimensions of the tube 23 and the volume V1 may difter from those shown.<br>
As mentioned above, the dimensions of the enclosure 22 are chosen such that the operating frequencyfw of the transducer is approximately equal to the Helmholtz frequency/H of the transducer unit 20. Expressed mathematically:<br>
FW=FH	0)<br>
It is preferred that the deviation from equality is less than 5%,<br>
The Helmholtz frequency is illustrated in Fig, 3, where the electrical impedance Z1 of the transducer (21 in Figs, 1 and 2) is shown as a function of the frequency f (both on a logarithmic scale). As can be seen, the electrical impedance reaches a maximum at a first resonance frequency f1 and a second resonance frequency f2. In between these resonance frequencies f1 and f2, the electrical impedance Z1 reaches a minimum at a frequency fn. This frequency fH is the Helmholtz frequency of the transducer unit: the frequency at which the so-called anti-resonance occurs in the transducer unit 20, resulting in a (local) minimum displacement of the transducer 21.<br>
The electrical impedance may reach further maxima at further resonance frequencies, but these are not shown in Fig. 3 for the sake of clarity of the illustration.<br>
It is noted that the Helmholtz frequency is, in the present invention, approximately equal to a resonance frequency of the transducer:<br>
0.4-FH
where FH is the Helmholtz frequency of the transducer unit 20 and/o is the resonance frequency of the transducer 21 in the absence of the volume V1 and the tube 23 (in the embodiment of Fig. 1, this is the resonance frequency when the volume V2 is present). In Prior Art arrangements, the resonance frequency/o typically coincides with the Helmholtz<br>
 <br>
frequency fH. In the arrangements of the present invention, the resonance frequency/o and the Helmholtz frequency fk can differ considerably.<br>
It is a feature of the present invention that the working frequency of the transducer unit 20 is approximately equal to its Helmholtz frequency, as expressed in equation (1) above. According to another aspect of the present invention, certain conditions are imposed upon the dimensions of the enclosure 22 and tube 23 to satisfy equation (1). Expressed mathematically, the first volume V1, which is located between the transducer 21 and the tube 23, should at least approximately comply with:<br>
  (3)<br>
In equation (3):<br>
-	c is the sound velocity in air,<br>
-	S is the inner cross-sectional surface of the tube 23,<br>
-	fw^ is the operating frequency of the transducer unit 20,<br>
-	ri is a quantity given by r| = 0.85 • 27π  • fw • r/c,<br>
<br>
-	r is the inner radius of the tube 23,<br>
-	T is a quantity given by 7' = tan(27π   Lfw//c),and<br>
-	L is the length of the tube 23.<br>
As will be discussed later with reference to Figs, 8 and 9, the operating frequency/^ is approximately equal to the central frequency of the second audio frequency range (II in Fig. 9) onto which a first frequency range is mapped.<br>
When equation (3) is satisfied, or at least approximately satisfied, equation (1) is satisfied as well and a very efficient sound reproduction is achieved. The efficiency can even be further improved if the force factor 5l of the transducer at least approximately satisfies the equation:<br>
 <br>
In equation (4):<br>
-	RE is the electrical resistance of the transducer 21,<br>
-	Rm is the mechanical resistance of the transducer,<br>
-	Rp is the mechanical resistance of the tube 23,<br>
-	S is the inner cross-sectional surface of the tube 23.<br>
-	p is the density of air.<br>
 <br>
-	c is the sound velocity in air,<br>
-	ris a quantity given hy T = tan(2ji ^L-fff/c),<br>
-	fn is the Helmholtz frequency of the transducer unit,<br>
-	L is the length of the tube 23,<br>
-	r| is a quantity given by T] === 0.85 -In-fH/c,<br>
-	m is the moving mass of the transducer, and<br>
-	/o is the resonance frequency of the transducer, in the absence of an enclosure extending<br>
between the transducer and the open air, as mentioned above.<br>
ri<br>
Lengths are expressed in meters (m), areas in square meters (m ), volumes in cubic meters (m3), velocities in meters per second (m/s) and frequencies in hertz (Hz). Electrical resistances are expressed in ohm (Ώ), mechanical resistances in newton-seconds per meter (Ns/m), while the force factor Bl is expressed in newton per ampere (N/A).<br>
It is noted that the force factor Bl is a quantity well known to those skilled in the Art. This force factor is the product of the flux density B of the magnetic field in the air gap of a loudspeaker and the effective length / of its voice coil wire.<br>
The electrical resistance RE of the transducer 21 is equal to the DC resistance (measured in Ώ) of the loudspeaker coil, while the mechanical resistance RM (measured in Ns/m) is caused by the cone suspension of the loudspeaker (or its equivalent in case another type of transducer is used). The mechanical resistance Rp (measured in Ns/m) is the total mechanical resistance of the tube 23, including radiation resistance, seen as a lumped parameter at the end 27 of the tube 23.<br>
The effective radiating surface S of the transducer is typically equal to the cross-sectional (inner) surface area of the tube 23. The length L of the tube 23 preferably ranges from λo/8 to Xo/4, where Λ0 is the wavelength corresponding with the resonance frequency fo mentioned above: λ0 = c If0 where c is the sound velocity in air.<br>
If equation (4) is satisfied exactly, an optimum B/opt results. It has been found<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The effects of the measures of the present invention will be fiirther explained with reference to Figs, 4, 5 and 6. Fig. 4 shows the sound pressure level (SPL) of a transducer unit (20 in Figs. 1 and 2) as a function of the frequency f The SPL is shown in deciBels (dB), the frequency has a logarithmic scale. Graph A shows the SPL of the transducer unit (that is, the transducer mounted in an enclosure having a tube, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2), while Graph B shows the SPL of a reference chamber with a single closed volume equal to the sum of V1, V2 and the internal volume of the tube 23, the same transducer (21 in Figs. 1 and 2) being mounted in the reference chamber. Graph C shows the SPL of the transducer mounted in an infinite baffle and having the same displacement as a function of the frequency as in the transducer unit (20 in Figs. 1 and 2). It is noted that graph C is obtained by driving the transducer (in dependence of the frequency) in such a way that the same displacement is obtained as would be obtained with the enclosure provided with a tube.<br>
The sound pressure level (SPL) of the transducer (graph C) drops sharply at approximately 55 Hz, the Helmholtz frequency fH of the transducer unit as its cone displacement decreases. When mounted in a properly designed enclosure, however, the sound pressure level sharply increases at this frequency. In other words, at this frequency a very large SPL can be obtained, as illustrated in graph A.<br>
The corresponding absolute value |Zi| of the transducer impedance Zi is illustrated in Fig. 5, where |Zi| is shown to have two peaks and a trough in between these peaks. The trough occurs at the Hehnholtz frequency fH-<br>
The corresponding cone displacement of the transducer is illustrated in Fig. 6. The cone displacement d (measured in millimeters) is shown as a ftinction of the frequency f. Graph E shows the displacement necessary for a transducer mounted on a baffle to obtain, at the frequency fn of (in the present example) approximately 55 Hz, the same sound pressure level (SPL) as in graph A in Fig. 4 (approximately 84 dB). According to graph E, the required cone displacement would be about 14 mm, which requires a relatively expensive transducer. In the arrangement of the present invention, however, which is tuned to the Helmholtz frequency, the required cone displacement is less than 2 mm, as illustrated by graph F. In other words, the present invention allows to obtain a high sound pressure level at a minimal cone displacement.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention, the enclosure 22 and/or the tube 23 have rounded edges. This is illustrated in Fig. 7, where part of the tube 23 is shown. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6, the end 27 of the tube 23 is provided with a flange or baffle 25. This flange 25 serves to lower the total mechanical resistance Rp of the<br>
 <br>
enclosure. This quantity Rp is the mechanical resistance seen as a lumped parameter at the end 27 of the tube. The transition from the tube 23 to the flange 25 is smooth due to the rounded edge 24,<br>
As noted above, in the preferred embodiments of the present invention substantially no acoustic damping material is present in the enclosure 22 and the associated pipe 23.<br>
In Fig. 8 a graph showing an audio frequency distribution is schematically depicted. The graph 30 indicates the amplitude Amp (vertical axis) of an audio signal at a particular frequency f (horizontal axis). As shown, the audio signal contains virtually no signal components below approximately 10 Hz. As the following discussion will focus on the low-frequency part of the graph 30, the mid- and high-freuency parts of the graph have been omitted for the sake of clarity of the illustration.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a first frequency range is mapped onto a second, smaller frequency range which is preferably contained in the first frequency range. In the non-limiting example of Fig. 8, a first frequency range I is the range from 20 Hz to 120 Hz, while a second range 11 is the range around 60 Hz, for example 55-65 Hz. This first range I substantially covers the "low-frequency" part of an audio signal, whereas the second range II of Fig. 8 is chosen so as to correspond with a particular transducer unit, such as a loudspeaker unit, and will depend on the characteristics of the transducer unit. According to an important aspect of the present invention, the second range II preferably corresponds with the frequencies at which the transducer unit is most efficient, resulting in the highest sound production.<br>
It will be understood that the size (bandwidth) of the second range II may also depend on the characteristics of the transducer(s). A transducer or array of transducers having a wider range of frequencies at which it is most efficient (possibly muhiple resonance frequencies) will benefit from a wider second range II, Transducers or arrays of transducers having a single most efficient frequency, such as the Helmholtz frequency/H, may benefit from an extremely narrow second range 11 as this will concentrate all energy in said single frequency.<br>
It is noted that in the example shown the second range II is located within the first range I, This means that the first range I is effectively compressed and that no frequencies outside the first range are affected.<br>
The device 10 according to the present invention which is shown merely by way of non-limiting example in Fig. 9 comprises a band-pass filter 11, a detector 12, an<br>
 <br>
(optional) low-pass filter 13, a multiplier 14 and a generator 15. The filter 11 has a pass-band which corresponds to the first range I, thus eliminating all frequencies outside the first range. The detector 12 detects the signal VF received frm the filter 11. The detector 12 preferably is a peak detector known per se, but may also be an envelope detector known per se. In a very economical embodiment, the detector may be constituted by a diode.<br>
The signal VE produced by the detector 12 represents the amplitude of the combined signals present within the first range I (see Fig. 8). Multiplier 14 multiplies this signal by a signal Vo having a frequency fw This signal Vo may be generated by a suitable generator 15. The output signal VM of the multiplier 14 has an average frequency approximately equal to fw while its amplitude is dependant on the signals contained in the first frequency range I. By varying the generator frequency fw, the average frequency and therefore the location of the second audio frequency range II can be varied.<br>
An audio system according to the present invention is schematically illustrated in Fig, 10. A device 1 for driving transducers is shown to comprise a frequency mapping device 10 and a processing unit 19 arranged in parallel. An input signal Vin produced by a sound source 2 is fed to both the device 10 and the processing unit 19. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the frequency mapping device 10 selects a frequency range, for example the bass frequency range, and maps this frequency range onto the Helmholtz frequency of the (schematically represented) first transducer unit 20, The processing unit 19 may comprise an amplifier to amplify all frequencies and feed the resulting signal to the (schematically represented) second transducer unit 29. Additionally, or alternatively, the processing unit 19 may comprise filters for filtering certain frequencies.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the processing unit 19 comprises delay elements for delaying the signal fed to the second transducer unit 29 in such a way that the sound pressure of the first transducer unit 20 is approximately equal to the sound pressure of the second transducer unit 29, in particular at a certain time instant. In this embodiment, the processing unit 19 introduces delays to equal any delays introduced by the device 10,<br>
The first transducer unit 20 is preferably a transducer unit according to the present invention which is designed to operate at its Helmholtz frequency, while the second transducer unit 29 may be a conventional transducer unit having one or more transducers.<br>
The sound source 2 may be constituted by any suitable sound source, such as a radio tuner, a CD or DVD player, an MP3 or AAC player, an Internet terminal, and/or a computer having suitable audio storage means.<br>
 <br>
The present invention is based upon the insight that a transducer can produce a maximum amount of sound at a minimum cone displacement when driven at its Helmholtz frequency. The present invention benefits from the further insight that a frequency range can be mapped upon another, narrower frequency range that contains the Helmholtz frequency so as to render the original frequency range with maximum efficiency.<br>
The present invention is not limited to conventional electro-magnetic loudspeakers having a magnet, a coil and a cone, but may also be applied to other audio transducers, such as electrostatic loudspeakers.<br>
It is noted that any terms used in this document should not be construed so as to limit the scope of the present invention. In particular, the words "comprise(s)" and "comprising" are not meant to exclude any elements not specifically stated Single (circuit) elements may be substituted with multiple (circuit) elements or with their equivalents.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated above and that many modifications and additions may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appending claims. In this context it is noted that various combinations of features defined in the claims are possible within the scope of the invention. Thus the invention also includes these combinations.<br>
