				<td>The present invention relates to a structure of attaching a starter motor of a unit swing type internal combustion engine.<br>
In respect of a unit swing type internal combustion engine of this kind, there has been disclosed an example described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. JP-B-5-68398.<br>
Figs. 13 and 14 illustrate a structure of attaching and arranging a starter motor described<br>
in the publication.<br>
There is installed an internal combustion engine 03 in which a crank shaft 02 is arranged horizontally in the left and right direction at a center of a front portion of a unit swing case 01 and a cylinder 04 is extended upwardly.<br>
Although not illustrated, a rear wheel is axially supported at a rear portion of the unit swing case 01 and drive of the crank shaft is transmitted to the rear wheel via a belt transmission mechanism.<br>
A hanger bracket 05 is projected forwardly from a front wall of the unit swing case 01, a front end thereof is axially supported by a vehicle body frame via a pivot shaft 06, the unit swing case 01 can be swung upwardly and downwardly along with the rear wheel with the pivot shaft 06 as a center thereof, and damping means is interposed between a rear end of the unit swing case 01 and the vehicle body frame thereabove .<br>
A starter motor 07 is disposed at the front portion of the unit swing case 01 and at the same<br>
position as that of a crank pin 02a of a crank shaft 02 in respect of the left and right direction (crank center C) and is attached to the unit swing case 01 at the front position of the crank pin 02a between the cylinder 04 and the support bracket 05 with a drive shaft 07a in parallel with the crank shaft 02.<br>
The starter motor 07 is attached to the fro.nt portion of the unit swing case 01 from the side of the crank center C (right side) , a drive gear 010 formed at the drive shaft 07a of the starter motor 07 is in mesh with a large diameter gear Olla of a reduction gear Oil fitted pivotably to a reduction gear shaft 09 provided to span between the unit swing case 01 and a left case cover 08, and a small diameter gear Ollb of the reduction gear Oil is in mesh with a starting system gear 012 on a side of the crank shaft 02.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention] According to the example, the cylinder 04 is extended upwardly from the crank case at the front portion of the unit swing case 01 and accordingly space under a seat is significantly limited.<br>
In that case, when the cylinder is inclined forwardly to secure the space under the seat, there causes a problem of interference with a rear frame and when the unit swing case 01 is moved rearwardly to avoid the interference, the wheel base is prolonged. <br>
Further, when the starter motor 07 is arranged at the crank center C as described above, it is disposed at the same position as positions of the cylinder 04, an intake system mechanism, an exhaust system mechanism and the like in the case of the crank case lead valve type and accordingly, such mechanisms related to the basic functions of the internal combustion engine are restricted by the arrangement of the starter motor and the degree of freedom of layout is limited.<br><br>
Further, the starter motor 07 is a sufficient protecting structure against water and mud in running since it is attached outside of the unit swing case 01 and a number of parts such as 0-ring, parking, oil seal in motor and the like is increased. Further, when the starter motor is arranged on the<br>
lower side of the unit swing case 01, not only the waterproof structure must be made more strict but the bank angle of the motorcycle is influenced.<br><br>
In this case, although there has been disclosed an example (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. JP-B-1-31036 ) where a starter motor is arranged in a unit swing case, according to the example, the power transmission system is of a chain type, an allowable space is provided between the crank shaft and the reduction mechanism on a rear side thereof and the starter motor is arranged in the space, which is different from the belt power transmission system.<br>
Further, according to the example, the drive shaft of the starter motor is directed substantially in the forward and backward direction and is not in parallel with the crank shaft and therefore, a number of parts is increased to change the power direction. <br>
The present invention has been carried out in view of such a point and it is an object of the present invention to provide a structure of attaching a<br><br>
starter motor of a unit swing type internal combustion engine whereby reduction of the wheel base is achieved while securing a large degree of freedom in respect of the space under the seat and a large degree of freedom is provided to the layout of mechanisms related to the basic functions of the internal combustion engine,<br>

from the front end portion in an oblique upward direction while being bent, an exhaust port 103b is formed at the rear end, a pin 105 is projected in the left direction on the left side face at the middle of the elongated warm air duct 103, and a pin receiving member 106 is fixed on the right side face of the rear portion.<br>
The pin receiving member 106 is a rectangular small piece and an engagement groove 106a is formed to open to one side thereof.<br>
Meanwhile, in respect of the hanger bracket 17 projected from the upper face of the crank case 16a of the unit swing case 16, the bearing rubber bush 17a for axially supporting the pivot shaft 14b is fitted to the upper portion and a circular hole 17b is formed at a predetermined portion of the side wall therebelow (refer to Figs. 7 and 8).<br>
Further, a pin 107 is projected in the left direction from the connection flange 27a for connecting the intake pipe 27 extended from the intake port 16g and a carburetor 28. <br>
In attaching the warm air duct 103, firstly,<br><br>
the warm air duct 103 is passed through an interval between the pivot shaft 14b and the crank case 16a along the inner side (right side) of the left side hanger bracket 17, the square opening frame 103a at the front end is made to coincide with the connection pipe lOla of the shroud 101, the projections lOlb of the front wall of the connection pipe lOla are engaged to fit to the small holes 104a of the pair of upper and lower engagement pieces 104, the pin 105 projected from the left side face of the warm air duct 103 is fitted to the circular hole 17b of the side wall of the hanger bracket 17 and successively, the pin 107 projected from the connection flange 27a of the intake pipe 27 is engaged with the engagement groove 106a of the pin receiving member 106 on the right side face of the rear portion of the warm air duct 103 (refer to Figs. 5 and 6) .<br>
As described above, the warm air duct 103 is firmly attached to the unit swing case 16 by connecting to make the square opening frame 103a at the front end to coincide with the connection pipe lOla of the shroud 101, positioning the front end by engaging the engagement pieces 104 to the<br><br>
projections lOlb, positioning the middle portion in the forward and rearward direction by engaging the pin 105 to the circular hole 17b by which the left side fare is held by the hanger bracket 17, and fixing the rear portion by engaging the pin receiving member 106 to the pin 107 whereby the right side face is held .<br>
According to the embodiment, although the operational efficiency is improved without using screws or the like in attaching the warm air duct 103, screws or the like may naturally be used.<br>
When the warm air duct 103 is attached in this way, air warmed by the cylinder 25 can be introduced to the warm air duct 103, can be exhausted from the exhaust port 103b at the rear end, and can be blown to the carburetor 28 arranged opposedly to the exhaust port 103b.<br>
By blowing warm air to the carburetor 28 cooled by the heat of vaporization in driving the internal combustion engine 20, the vaporizing function can be maintained by maintaining the temperature at a certain degree or higher and a so-called icing or the like can be prevented from occurring in cold<br><br>
areas.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 5, on the left side of the cylinder 25, the starter motor 80 is arranged on the lower side of the cylinder center line C-C to overlap the cylinder 25 in a side view and the warm air duct 103 is arranged by utilizing the space on the upper side of the cylinder center line C-C thereabove whereby the swing unit 15 can be downsized while securing the warm air path to the carburetor 28.<br>
On the right side of the cylinder 25, the fan cover 102 for forming the duct to the cylinder 25 is provided and the starter motor 80 is arranged in the dead space overlapping the cylinder 25 on the opposite left side in a side view and therefore, the degree of freedom of layout of the mechanisms related to the basic functions of the internal combustion engine is enhanced and further, the swing unit 15 can be downsized by utilizing effectively the space without projecting the starter motor 80 to the lower portion of the swing unit 15. <br>
The cylinder 25 is disposed between the rear<br><br>
frames 5c by being inclined forwardly substantially horizontally and therefore, the space under the seat<br>
6	can be secured, the volume of the containing box<br>
7	can be increased and the wheel base can be<br>
shortened .<br>
Further, the hanger bracket 17 is arranged to project upwardly by utilizing space between the intake port 16g on the upper face of the crank case 16a and the cylinder 25 inclined forwardly and therefore, compact formation of the internal combustion engine 20 is achieved and the degree of freedom of the link member 14 in view of the relationship with the rear frames 5c is promoted. Further, the hanger bracket 17 is not projected downwardly and therefore, also the minimum height of the ground can be secured.<br>
Although according to the above-described embodiment, the drive of the starter motor 80 is transmitted to the crank shaft 36 via the reduction gear 96 and the starter one way clutch 41 thereby starting the internal combustion engine 20, an explanation will be given of an example of another<br><br>
drive transmission mechanism in reference to Fig. 12 as follows .<br>
A starter motor 110 is fixed to a unit swing case 120 at a position overlapping a cylinder 121 in a side view substantially the same as in the starter motor 80 from the left side via a motor bracket 111 by volts 112.<br>
Further, a starter pinion 115 is arranged to be disposed at a shoulder portion below a scavenge path 121d of the cylinder 121, which is substantially the same as the position of arranging the above-described reduction gear 96.<br>
In respect of the starter pinion 115, one end of pinion shaft thereof is fitted to and supported by a bearing hole at the motor bracket 111 and the other end thereof is fitted to and supported by a bearing hole 120a at the shoulder portion below the scavenge path 121d of the unit swing case 120.<br>
In respect of the starter pinion 115, an input side gear 116 is in mesh with a drive gear llOa formed at the drive shaft of the starter motor 110 and an output side gear 117 is rotated by jumping out the axial direction in driving thereof.<br><br>
A driven gear 118 is integrally fitted to a crank shaft 122 at a position in mesh with the jumped output side gear 117.<br>
Accordingly, the driven gear 118 is not in mesh with the output side gear 117 except in starting the internal combustion engine and when the starter motor 110 is driven in starting the engine, the output side gear 117 of the starter pinion 115 jumps out and becomes in mesh with the driven gear 118 thereby starting the engine by rotating the crank shaft 122. <br>
According to the embodiment, the starter one way clutch 41 and the like in the above-described embodiment are not necessary.<br>
Incidentally, although the starter pinion 115 becomes larger than the reduction gear 96, since the starter pinion is disposed at the shoulder portion below the scavenge path 121d of the cylinder 121, the starter pinion can be arranged proximate to the center line C-C of the cylinder 121 and accordingly, the starter motor 110 can be prevented from projecting to the left side direction and the<br>
downsizing of the swing unit can be maintained.<br><br>
