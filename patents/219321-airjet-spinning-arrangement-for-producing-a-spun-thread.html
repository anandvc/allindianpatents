BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Airjet spinnting arrangement<br>
The present invention relates to an airjet spinning arrangement for producing a spun<br>
thread from a staple fibre strand which travels through a vortex chamber, into which<br>
runs at least one air supply channel for compressed air having a nozzle-like<br>
mouthpiece, said air supply channel taking the form of a nozzle groove arranged in a<br>
nozzle body and lying in a radial plans in relation to the travel direction of the staple<br>
fibre strand, said nozzle groove completing the air supply channel by means of a<br>
front surface of a cover.<br>
An airjel spinning arrangement is prior art in German published patent application 37<br>
32 708. In this publication two variations are disclosed with regard to the position of<br>
the air supply channels. In one variation, on which the generic part of the first claim<br>
in the present invention is based, a plurality of air supply channels lie in a radial plane<br>
in relation to the travel direction of the staple fibre strand. The compressed air which<br>
flows to the staple fibre strand has to be abruptly deflected, whereby it is more or less<br>
left to chance whether the airstream then flows in the direction of travel or in the<br>
opposite direction,  in the other variation, the air supply channels are inclined in the<br>
running direction of the staple fibre strand in that the nozzle grooves are located in<br>
taper surfaces and are covered by laper surfaces arranged thereto.  In this case<br>
there is a risk of insufficient seaianl, as the taper surfaces arranged to one another<br>
are never free from tolerances.<br>
Air supply channels are usually drilled in the case of non-generic airjet spinning<br>
arrangements. In contrast to this embodiment, the above mentioned airjet spinning<br>
arrangement has the advantage in that it can be manufactured very simply, as in a<br>
nozzle body nozzle grooves can be created in a very simple way lo a great degree of<br>
precision by means of milling, which are subsequently covered by a lay-on surface<br>
and thus complete the air suppty channels. Because air supply channels of this type<br>
are exposed before assembly, they can easily be tested with regard to precision and<br>
re-worked if necessary.  Faulty pieces can also be removed during testing. The<br>
manufacture of such nozzle grooves is not limited to a milling process, but rather can<br>
also be generated by means of a stamping process.<br><br>
3<br>
it is an object of the present invention to produce for an airjet spinning arrangement<br>
the necessary air supply channels in principle as in the above mentioned prior art.<br>
while, however, providing at the same time together with good sealing properties also<br>
a stream component aligned in the running direction of the fibre strand.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present invention in that the<br>
cover comprises a sloped air-deflecting surface directly adjacent to the mouthpiece<br>
and inclined in the running direction of the staple fibre strand.<br>
As nozzle grooves extending in a radial plane in relation to the running direction of<br>
the staple fibre strand are supposed, the front surface of the cover as well as the<br>
surfaces of the nozzle body arranged thereto can each be a plane surface, so that no<br>
sealing difficulties arise.  In addition, It is ensured that the compressed air directly<br>
adjacent to the mouthpiece of the at least one compressed air supply channel is<br>
deflected in the running direction of the staple fibre strand, so that unequivocal<br>
airflow conditions prevail.<br>
The air supply channels designed according to the present invention can be<br>
advantageously applied in airjet spinning arrangements which are designed, for<br>
example, according to European published patent application 12 17 109.<br>
The air-deflecting surface is advantageously designed as conical ring surface<br>
surrounding the staple fibre strand. The air-deflecting surfaces can be thus<br>
particularly easily manufactured. It is hereby practical when a plurality of mouth<br>
pieces are aligned tangentially to the ring surface. This leads not only to a good<br>
impariation of twist to the spun thread, but also has the advantage of an extended<br>
deflection path for the compressed air, as the air is initially aligned at the air-<br>
deflecting surface by a component in the circumferential direction of the ring surface.<br>
The ring surface itself can be very flat and narrow. It has been shown that it is<br>
sufficient when the conicity of the ring surface in relation to the radial piane lies<br>
between 10º and 20º. It has been further shown that the length of the air-deflecting<br>
surface can be in the order of magnitude of the width of the nozzie grooves.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is an axial section approximately ten limes enlarged, of an airjet spinning<br>
arrangement according to the present invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a smaller depiction in comparison to Figure 1 but still larger than the<br>
actual size of a section along the intersectional plane 11-II of Figure 1 of a nozzle<br>
body,<br>
Figure 3 is a view in the direction of the arrow [II of Figure 1 of the cover according to<br>
the present invention and in the same dimensions as in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 is a section of this cover along the intersectional plane IV-IV of Figure 3,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows an airjet spinning arrangement with which a loose staple fibre strand<br>
2 fed through a feed channel 1 is imparted a twist in a vortex chamber 3, so that a<br>
spun thread 4 is formed which is withdrawn by a yarn withdrawal channel 5, The<br>
staple fibre strand 2 can be fed from a drafting unit or another drafting aggregate. A<br>
fluid device generates a vortex airflow in the vortex chamber 3 by means of the<br>
injection of compressed air through compressed air supply channels 6 which run<br>
tangentially into the vortex chamber 3.   The compressed air exiting from the<br>
mouthpieces 7 of the air supply channels 6 is removed via an air evacuation channel<br>
8. whereby the air evacuation channel 8 comprises a ring-shaped cross section<br>
arranged around the yarn withdrawal channel 5 and around a spindle-like stationary<br>
component 9.<br>
Downstream of the exit opening 10 of the feed channel 1, the edge 11 of a fibre<br>
guiding surface 12 is provided as a twist block, said edge 11 being arranged<br>
eccentric to the yarn withdrawal channel 5 in the area of its entry opening 13,<br>
In the airjet spinning arrangement the fibres to be spun are held on the one hand in<br>
the staple fibre strand 2 and thus fed from the exit opening 10 of the feed channel 1<br>
into the yarn withdrawal channel 5 essentially without being imparted a twist. On the<br><br>
5<br>
other hand the fibres are subject to the effects of the vortex airstream in the area<br>
between the feed channel 1 and the yam withdrawal channel 5, which causes them,<br>
or at least their end areas, to be driven radially eway from the entry opening 13 of the<br>
yarn withdrawal channel 5, As a result, the threads 4 produced in the process<br>
described comprise a core of essentially in thread longitudinal direction extending<br>
fibres or fibre areas without an essential twist and an outer area, in which the fibres<br>
or fibre ends are twisted around the core.<br>
Basing the formation of the thread structure on an idealized process for the purposes<br>
of greater clarity, the front ends of fibres, in particular those whose rear areas are<br>
held upstream in the feed channel 1, essentially reach the yarn withdrawsl channel 5<br>
directly, but the follow-on fibre areas, in particular when they are no longer held in<br>
the entry area of the feed channel 1, are pulled out of the staple fibre strand 2 by the<br>
vortex formation and are then twisted around the formed thread 4.<br>
In any case fibres are at the same time bound inio the forming thread 4, through<br>
which they are pulled through the yarn withdrawal channel 5, and also subject to the<br>
vortex airslream which accelerates the fibres centrifugally, that is away from the entry<br>
opening 13 of the yarn withdrawal channel 5, and pulls them into the air evacuation<br>
channel 8. The fibre areas pulled out of the staple fibre strand 2 by the vortex<br>
airstream form a fibre vortex in the entry opening 13 of the yarn withdrawal channel<br>
5, the longer parts of which fibre vortex wind themselves in a spiral-like manner<br>
around the spindle-shaped component 9 and in this spiral are pulled to the entry<br>
opening 13 of the yam withdrawal channel 5 against the force of the flow in the air<br>
evacuation channel 8.<br>
The air supply channels 6 are described in more detail below with the aid of Figure 1,<br>
supplemented by Figures 2, 3 and 4.<br>
According to the shown embodiment in the above mentioned Figures, there are per<br>
airjet spinning arrangement four compressed air supply channels 6 overall, each of<br>
which are provided with mouthpieces 7, and, as can best be seen in Figure 2, are,<br>
tangentially directed into the vortex chamber 3, These compressed air supply<br>
channels 6 are worked into a nozzle body 14 in the form of nozzle grooves 15 and,<br>
according to Figures 1, 3 and 4 are completed to form compressed air supply<br>
channels 6 by means of the front surface 16 of a cover 17, The nozzle grooves 15<br><br>
6<br>
extend in a plane E radial to the running direction A of the staple fibre strand 2, see<br>
Figure 1.<br>
An annular space 18 radially surrounding the nozzle body 14 is connected to a<br>
compressed air source in a way not shown.  Via axial recesses 19 worked into the<br>
outer contour of the nozzle body 14, the compressed air travels from the annular<br>
space 18 to the individual air supply channels 6. The annular space 18 is sealed off<br>
from the outside by a wall of a housing 20.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the cover 17 comprises directly adjacent to<br>
the mouthpieces 7 a sloped air-daffecting surface 21 inclined in running direction A of<br>
the staple fibre strand 2. Although the nozzle grooves 15 are very simple to<br>
manufacture as they !ie in the radial plane E, the compressed air exiting out of the<br>
moutopleces 7 is deflected by the air-deflecting surface 21 in rurning direction A of<br>
the fibe strand 2. As can be seen, the air-deflecting surface 21 is designed as a<br>
conical ring surface 22 which surrounds the staple fibre strand 2 and against which a<br>
plurality of mouthpieces 7 are tangentially directed.<br>
As can be seen in particular in Figures 2 and 4, the conicity a of the ring surface 22<br>
in relation to the radial plane E is relatively low and lies between 10° and 20°, The<br>
length L of the air-deffecting surface 21 lies in the order of magnitude of the width B<br>
of the nozzie grooves 15.<br><br>
