SIMPLIFIED AUTOMATIC DISCHARGE FUNCTION FOR VEHICLES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to vehicles, and more particularly relates to safety devices for automatically disconnecting electrical power from vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Hybrid, fuel cell, and electric vehicles often use high voltage circuits to provide power to electric drive motors and for various other uses on the vehicle. High voltage electricity can potentially cause an electric shock hazard to any user or mechanic able to come in contact with it One common method of reducing the risk of electric shock hazard is by using an automatic disconnect device.<br>
[0003] An automatic disconnect device is generally implemented as a pair of high voltage relays with associated control circuits It is placed electrically between the string of batteries in a battery pack and the traction components in the vehicle. The high voltage relays, which are also called contactors, can limit the electrical energy to one electrical side of the automatic disconnect device in response to various faults on the vehicle. Once opened, the high voltage electrical energy is confined to the battery pack.<br>
[0004] High voltage components often use large capacitors to buffer their energy usage and provide quick bursts of energy. These capacitors are charged to full voltage during operation Under some fault scenarios the capacitors are not discharged even after the high voltage relays are opened Because of this, most vehicle manufactures install passive discharge resistors in their systems near the capacitors. Because passive discharge resistors take a significant   amount   of   time   to   discharge   the   full   capacitance,   some<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
manufactures also include an active or automatic discharge function with the automatic disconnect device<br>
[0005] The main difficulty with the traditional approach of implementing the automatic discharge function is that the control of the function is very complex. For example, the controlling transistor must not be turned on while the battery pack is still connected or the discharge resistor could be damaged by overloading In some fault situations, such as during a loss of electrical power while controlling a permanent magnet motor, the transistor should generally be turned on automatically. Generally, a significant portion of this complex control is directed by software within the vehicle controllers Because it is under software control it is somewhat more prone to incorrect activations, either not activating when it should or activating when it should not.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, it is desirable to have a simple system for automatic discharge. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] A method is disclosed for an automatic discharge function for a vehicle having an electric or hybrid motor The method monitors the electric or hybrid electric motor for occurrence of a power shutdown. If the power shutdown occurs, contactors are opened, and discharging of capacitance is immediately initiated in response to opening the contactors. Discharging is continued until discharge of the capacitance is complete.<br><br>

[0008] A system is disclosed for an automatic discharge function for a vehicle having a battery pack and a capacitance with contactors between the battery pack and the capacitance. The contactors are configured to open in order to disconnect automatically the battery pack and immediately start discharging the capacitance when a power shutdown occurs. A resistor is configured to discharge the capacitance. A power output stage configured to convert DC to AC may also be included to control how much power is sent to an electric or hybrid electric motor based on electric or hybrid electric motor modes such as acceleration of the electric or hybrid electric motor<br>

[0017] The following description may refer to elements or nodes or features being "connected" or "coupled" together As used herein, unless expressly stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature is directly joined to (or directly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematics shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 depict example arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an embodiment of the invention (assuming that the functionality of the system is not adversely affected). [0018] Embodiments of the invention are described herein in the context of one practical application, without limitation, namely a connection monitoring technique for a simplified automatic discharge function for hybrid vehicles. In this context, the example technique is applicable to detecting electrical circuit power shutdowns on the vehicle Embodiments of the invention, however, are not limited to such vehicle applications, and the techniques described herein may also be utilized in other connection monitoring systems.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an automatic discharge function system 100 for a hybrid vehicle A system 100 may generally include, a battery pack 102, a DC-AC converter 104, and a hybrid motor 106 [0020] The battery pack 102 is configured to support a hybrid vehicle operation. The battery pack 102 may be connected to the DC-AC converter 104 that provides power to the hybrid motor 106. The battery pack 102 may generally include: a battery series 124, a contactor K2 , and a contactor K <br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
[0021] The battery series 124 is configured to provide an electrical voltage and current to the hybrid motor 106 via a first battery pole 126, and a second battery pole 128 The electrical voltage provided by the battery series 124 is a high DC voltage, which may be in the neighborhood of 300 volts. Battery series 124 may be hybrid batteries such as, for example, without limitation, lead acid, nickel metal hydride, or lithium ion. The contactor K2 connects the battery pole 128 of the battery series 124 to the DC-AC converter 104, and contactor K\ connects the battery pole 126 of the battery series 124 to the DC-AC converter 104. Contactors K\ and K2 are configured to open in order to disconnect the battery series 124 when a power shutdown event occurs. A power shutdown event may correspond to an electric system or motor shutdown as part of normal vehicle operation, or various faults on the vehicle such as an electrical failure Significant vehicle impact and the detection of attempted access to high voltage components are the two main items that would cause an open. Also, this circuit often opens the contactors after the user power's down the vehicle with the ignition switch, so that the high voltage is contained within the pack when the vehicle is off. Contactors K\ and K2 are single-pole single-throw switches.<br>
[0022] DC-AC converter 104 provides power conditioning and control for the hybrid motor 106. The DC-AC converter generally includes. a capacitance  Cx, a passive discharge resistor  Rp, an automatic discharge<br>
function 120, and a power output stage 122.<br>
[0023] A capacitance Cx is included to buffer electrical energy between the battery pack 102 and the power output stage 122. A capacitance Cx has a first pole 111 connected to contactor K\ and a second pole 113 connected to contactor K2 . A capacitance may include, for example without limitation, an ultra-capacitor.   For the purpose of illustration, the capacitance Cx will also<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
represent the capacitance that will naturally exist in other components of the hybrid vehicle coupled to but outside the battery pack such as, for example without limitation, an active electrical bus, power electronics, power output stage 122, or hybrid motor 106. Other common devices with significant capacitance are auxiliary power converters (DC-DC converters), electric air conditioning compressors, oil pumps, and power steering pumps. Each of these devices will contain the capacitors, power output stages, and the like. [0024]        A passive discharge resistor  R    is included to provide a slow<br>
discharge of capacitance Cx.   The passive discharge resistor Rp is a large resistor on the order of 40 kilo Ohms.   The passive discharge resistor R1<br>
operates at all times to give a discharge time on the order of about five minutes from operating voltage to less than 60 volts. This may be too slow to provide protection when a power shutdown event occurs. [0025]        An  existing  automatic  discharge  function   120   is  included  to provide a fast discharge of capacitance Cx when a power shutdown event occurs   The automatic discharge function includes an active discharge resistor RA, and an active discharge control switch 116.  The active discharge resistor RA is configured to discharge the capacitance Cx.   In this regard, the active discharge resistor RA is a small resistor on the order of about 25 ohms (30 watt capacity) that allows a high current to quickly discharge capacitance (\ when active discharge control switch 116 allows current to flow.    Active discharge control switch 116 (here shown as a bipolar power field effect transistor) is activated when a power shutdown event occurs. [0026]        The power output stage 122 performs the functions of converting the DC from the battery pack 102 to AC for the hybrid motor 106<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
[0027] Hybrid motor 106 for this example includes an AC electric motor to provide additional power to an internal combustion engine, and for regenerative braking AC electric motors are often used for this application because they provide high torque under load, and motor/generator operation [0028] FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of an automatic discharge system 200 that is suitably configured to perform an automatic discharge process according to an example embodiment of the invention. System 200 is suitable for use with a vehicle having an electric (or hybrid) traction motor A practical automatic discharge system 200 may include a number of electrical components, circuits and controller units other than those shown m FIG. 2 Conventional subsystems, features, and aspects of the automatic discharge system 200 will not be described in detail herein The automatic discharge system 200 has components that are similar to system 100 (common features, functions, and elements will not be redundantly described here). For this example embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, the system 200 may generally include: a battery pack 202 or any suitable DC power supply, a controller 203, a DC-AC converter 204, and a hybrid motor 206<br>
[0029] The battery pack 202 may generally include: a battery series 220, a contactor K\, and a contactor K2, and an active discharge resistor R4 The contactors together form a contactor arrangement, which is suitably configured to selectively couple the DC power supply in parallel with the capacitance of the vehicle while in an operating mode, or couple the active discharge resistor in parallel with the capacitance while in a shutdown mode. The contactor arrangement is actuated by a suitably configured controller 203, which can be coupled to the contactor arrangement.<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
[0030] The controller 203 may be implemented as part of a vehicle computing module, a centralized vehicle processor, a subsystem computing module devoted to the contactor arrangement, or the like. In operation, the controller 203 controls the actuation of the contactor arrangement in accordance with the current state of the vehicle, e.g., whether the shutdown mode or the normal operating mode is active. The controller 203 may react to vehicle data to determine whether the shutdown mode or the operating mode should be established. The controller 203 is generally a software-controlled device. Under normal conditions, it keeps both A^l and K2 closed during vehicle operation If a significant fault is detected, either by controller 203 or by another controller in the system, controller 203 can be programmed to either open the contactors immediately or to shut down the hybrid motor 206 and then open the contactors.<br>
[0031] Contactor K\, as influenced by the controller 203, is configured to couple the output stage input node 211 to a first end 215 of the active discharge resistor (while in the shutdown mode), and is configured to couple input node 211 to a first pole 222 of the DC power supply (while in the operating mode).<br>
[0032] The battery series 220 is configured to provide an electrical voltage and current to the hybrid vehicle Contactor K\ connects a first battery pole 222 of the battery series 220 to the DC-AC converter 204, and contactor K2 connects a second battery pole 224 of the battery series 220 to the DC-AC converter 204 In this embodiment, contactors Kl and K2 are configured to open simultaneously (within practical limitations known to those skilled in the art) in order to immediately disconnect the battery series 220 from the other components when a power shutdown occurs. For this example, contactor K2 is a single-pole single-throw switch and contactor Kl is a single-pole double-throw switch.<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
[0033] For this embodiment, the function to provide a fast discharge of capacitance Cx whenever K\ is opened is done by active discharge resistor/?^ . This capacitance may represent the vehicle capacitance associated with various electrical components, conductive elements, electrical circuitry, and the like In this example, the capacitance is coupled across the two input nodes of the power output stage 218. Active discharge resistor RA is a small resistor that allows a high current to quickly discharge capacitance CA when a first end 215 of active discharge resistor RA is connected by contactor Kl to<br>
node 214 when contactor K\ is not connected to first battery pole 222 of battery series 220. In this regard, contactor K\ is disconnected from the battery series 220 and is then connected to active discharge resistor RA when K\   is  opened.     A  second end 217 of active  discharge resistor   RA   is<br>
continuously connected to contactor K2 or any point electrically on a high voltage bus connected to node K2 on the DC-AC converter 204 side of K2 [0034]        DC-AC converter 204 provides power conditioning and control for the   hybrid   motor  206.     The  DC-AC   converter  generally   includes'     a capacitance Cx, a passive discharge resistor R , and a power output stage<br>
218.     However,  for this  embodiment,  as compared to  system   100,  the<br>
automatic discharge function 120 and the active discharge control switch 116<br>
are omitted<br>
[0035]        The capacitance Cx has a first pole 211 connected to contactor Kand a second pole 213 connected to contactor K2 208.<br>
[0036]       A passive discharge resistor  Rp  is included to provide a slow<br>
discharge of capacitance Cx.   The passive discharge resistor R   is a large<br>
resistor on the order of about 40 kilo Ohms The passive discharge resistor R   operates at all times to give a discharge time on the order of about 5<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
minutes from operating voltage to less than about 60 volts. This is too slow to provide adequate discharge when a power shutdown occurs, thus necessitating the need for the active discharge resistor RA.<br>
[0037] Contactor #1 is disconnected from the battery series 220 and connected to a first end 215 of the active discharge resistor R4 when a power shutdown occurs. Otherwise, contactor K\ remains connected to the battery series 220. A second end 217 of the active discharge resistor R4 is continuously connected to contactor K2 on the DC-AC converter 204 side of contactor K2. Contactors K\ and K2 are configured to disconnect the battery pack 202 from the DC-AC converter 204, and immediately start discharging the capacitance Cx when contactor A^l is opened. [0038] FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of an automatic discharge system 300 that is suitably configured to perform an automatic discharge function according to an alternative example embodiment of the invention A practical automatic discharge system 300 may include a number of electrical components, circuits and controller units other than those shown in FIG. 3 Conventional subsystems, features, and aspects of the automatic discharge system 300 will not be described in detail herein. System 300 has a structure that is similar to system 200 (common features, functions, and elements will not be redundantly described here). For this example embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, the automatic discharge system 300 includes: a battery pack 302, a controller 303, a DC-AC converter 304, and a hybrid motor 306 [0039] The capacitance Cx has a first pole 311 connected to contactor K\ and a second pole 313 connected to contactor K2<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
[0040] The battery pack 302 may generally include- a battery series 320, a contactor Kl, a contactor K2, and active discharge resistor RA. Contactor Kl connects a first battery pole 322 of the battery series 320 to the DC-AC converter 304, and contactor K2 connects the second battery pole 324 of the battery series 320 to the DC-AC converter 304. Contactors K\ and K2 are configured to open in order to disconnect the battery series 320 when a power shutdown occurs. In this example embodiment, both contactors Kl and K2 are single-pole double-throw switches whereas in system 200 only Kl is single-pole double-throw and K2 was single-pole single -throw [0041] System 200 has the advantage that only one double-throw contactor is required which would help reduce the cost for one of the contactors. There are instances where the total cost may be reduced and the validation process simplified by using a common part for both contactors, in which case system 300 may be the preferred implementation. [0042] As explained above in the context of FIG 2, a first end 315 of active discharge resistor RA is connected to contactor Kl when contactor K\ is not connected to the first battery pole 322 of battery series 320. However, in contrast to the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 (RA is continuously connected to contactor K2 on the DC-AC converter 204 side of K2), a second end 317 of active discharge resistor RA is connected to contactor K2 when contactor K2 is not connected to the second battery pole 324 of battery series 320 [0043] Contactor Kl, as influenced by the controller 303, is configured to couple the input stage input node 311 to a first end 315 of the active discharge resistor (while in the shutdown mode), and is configured to couple input stage input node 311 to a first battery pole 322 of the DC power supply (while in the operating mode)<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
[0044] Contactor K2 , as influenced by the controller 303, is configured to couple the output stage input node 313 to a second end 317 of the active discharge resistor (while in the shutdown mode), and is configured to couple input node 313 to a second battery pole 324 of the DC power supply (while in the operating mode).<br>
[0045] Contactors K\ and K2 are configured to open in order to disconnect the battery pack 302 from the DC-AC converter 304, and immediately start discharging the capacitance Cx when a power shutdown occurs. Under normal conditions, the contactors K\ and K2 are positioned such that they establish a circuit with the battery series 320. Under power shutdown conditions, the contactors £1 and K2 are positioned such that they establish a circuit with the active discharge resistor RA<br>
[0046] FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an automatic discharge process 500 for an electric, hybrid electric, or fuel cell vehicle that may be performed by systems 200 and 300 as described above. Process 400 checks for a power shutdown occurrence, opens the contactors, starts discharging the capacitance, and completes discharging the capacitance The various tasks performed in connection with process 400 may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description of process 400 may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with FIGS. 2-3. In practical embodiments, portions of process 400 may be performed by different elements of automatic discharge system 200-300, e.g., the battery pack, the active discharge resistor RA, the contactor K2 ,<br>
the contactor K\, the capacitance Cx, and the passive discharge resistor Rp.<br>
[0047] Automatic discharge process 400 begins by checking whether a power shutdown has occurred (inquiry task 402). The check may be made by various types of devices such as, for example, without limitation, a voltage<br><br>
GP-308909-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
monitor, or the like, where such devices are suitably configured to monitor the vehicle, the motor, and/or the electrical system for a power shutdown condition. If no power shutdown occurs, the check may repeat until a power shutdown occurs. In this regard, process 400 leads back to inquiry task 402 However, if a power shutdown does occur, process 400 disconnects contactors K\ and K2 (task 404) from the battery pack in order to stop high voltage current flow from the battery pack to a capacitance. Task 404 may cause the contactors to open, switch states, or be reconfigured as needed for the given system implementation<br>
[0048] Next, process 400 will immediately initiate discharging of the capacitance Cx (task 406). The discharging may be performed in the manner described above in connection with the various system embodiments In one embodiment, the discharging is accomplished by coupling contactor K\ to the first end 215 of the active discharge resistor RA where the active discharge<br>
resistor RA has the second end 217 continuously connected to the contactor K2 , for system 200. In another embodiment, the discharging is accomplished by coupling contactor K\ to the first end 315 of the active discharge resistor RA and coupling contactor K2 to the second end 317 of active discharge resistor RA, for system 300 The coupling of the active discharge resistor RA in system 200-300 will cause discharging of the capacitance C\ until complete discharging (task 408) is reached.
