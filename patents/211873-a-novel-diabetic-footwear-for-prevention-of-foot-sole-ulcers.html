A Novel Diabetic Footwear for Prevention of Foot Sole Ulcers Field of Invention<br>
This invention in general relates to the Biomedical Engineering field. In particular this invention relates to an unique category of footwear intended to be used by diabetic subjects for prevention of foot sole ulcers.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Diabetes mellitus is increasing globally. Foot ulceration is a common sequel to diabetes mellitus. Foot ulceration in the diabetic patient is the most common single precursor to amputation having been identified in 85% of lower extremity amputations. Foot sole ulcers occur in feet that are either insensate or ischemic or both or subject to high foot pressures. Therefore, it becomes important to prevent high pressures in the early stage itself by providing appropriate footwear to the diabetic subjects to reduce the foot pressure thus prevent ulcers and be suitable to be worn by them depending upon their work requirement and weather conditions . There are some diabetic subjects (with complete loss of foot sole sensation) having already foot sole ulcers in different parts of the foot sole which do not heal for a long time due to high foot pressures. These diabetic subjects have to be given appropriate foot wear to reduce the foot sole pressures to heal the ulcers quickly and be suitable to be worn by them depending upon their work requirement and weather conditions.<br>
The footwear for prevention of foot sole ulcers, of diabetic subjects offered in the western world, is mainly shoes. " A comprehensive concept of the medical, functional, and technical requirements of the type of footwear is still lacking to date " (Dahmen et al 2001, Diabetic Care, Vol. 24, 705-709). " Footwear that, is aesthetically acceptable to people with diabetes and prior foot ulcers has received little study in the United States" (Reiber et al 2002, J. Rehab. Research &amp; Development, Vol. 39, 615-622). The footwear available commercially in the western world for diabetic subjects for prevention of foot sole ulcers is shown in Figure 1 (Reiber et al 2002, J. Rehab. Research &amp; Development, Vol. 39, 615-622). This is a shoe with hard outer sole (1), and a thin medium hard insole and leather upper (2) with lace to properly hold the foot in the shoe.<br>
The footwear for prevention of foot sole ulcers, available in the market for diabetic subjects in India, are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 3 shows a simple sandal with thin hard rubber insole (1 ) and hard rubber outer sole (2 ), front leather strap (3) to hold big toe and wide leather back strap (4) connected to the front strap. This type of footwear is not suitable for diabetic subjects since the thin hard insole does not reduce foot pressure and does not prevent foot ulcers. The leather straps are also hard without any inner soft lining. Therefore, this will introduce high friction between the upper part of foot and sandal, possibly giving rise to ulcers in the upper part of the foot. This footwear without a back strap going around the ankle, will not be able to hold the foot inside the footwear for diabetic subjects with complete loss of foot sole sensation. The inability of the diabetic subjects with sensory loss to hold the foot inside the footwear often results in the foot getting injured by hitting the external objects.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a sandal available in the Indian market as 'Dia-sole for foot rehef for diabetic subjects' possibly for prevention of foot sole ulcers. This sandal has thin insole (1 ) made of microcellular plastic (MCP) in the fore-foot part and very thin insole in the heel part of footwear, supported by very hard moulded plastic outer sole (2) with back (3) and front leather straps (4); both the straps are fitted with Velcro to hold the foot inside the sandal. This footwear without the help of buckle on the Velcro strap cannot be made to adjust the foot size within the footwear with appropriate grip and therefore gives rise rubbing action between the foot and the strap which could result in ulcers in the upper part of the foot. These type of footwear is also not able to accommodate swelling in the diabetic foot. Since the insole is not appropriately designed for its thickness, hardness and the material density, it is not efficient to reduce the foot pressure to the required extent and thus will not be able to protect the foot from foot sole ulcers. The durability of the footwear is low due to the material of the insole being not suitable for wash and wear and it is also very costly.<br>
There are no footwear (sandals or shoes) available in the Indian market for healing of foot sole ulcers.<br>
The Limitations of Prior Art<br>
Limitations of Existing Footwear for Prevention and Healing of Foot Sole Ulcers:<br>
1.	Foot wear both in India or in the westem world is not designed by stress analysis of foot-footwear composite model for minimizing the foot sole stresses which are necessary to unload the foot sole and reduce the foot sole pressure. Therefore, the thickness, hardness, type of material and its density used for the footwear insole and outer sole are not appropriate to reduce the diabetic foot sole pressures to the required extent and thus, to protect the diabetic foot from foot sole ulcers or healing of ulcers.<br>
2.	The footwear insole is very thin less than appropriate for reduction of foot sole stresses.<br>
3.	The existing footwear available in the Indian market (sandal type) for relief of pressure with thin micro-cellular plastic insole (MCP) absorbs water, not suitable for wash and wear, has low diorability.<br>
4.	The footwear insole is not of appropriate thickness and harder than required hardness and therefore not able to reduce foot sole pressure to the required level and thus inefficient in prevention of foot sole ulcers and it is also heavy.<br>
5.	The footwear outer sole is thicker and made of material harder than required hardness and therefore is not able to reduce foot sole stresses below necessary level to protect the foot sole from ulcers.<br>
6.	The footwear is heavier than required and therefore uncomfortable.<br>
7.	There is no soft inner lining attached to the straps of the sandal or to the irmer part of shoe upper and thus it gives rise to high frictional forces between the footwear upper and the foot upper part which results in ulcers in diabetic subjects with complete loss of foot sole sensation.<br>
8.	In diabetic patients with complete loss of foot sole sensation, it is essential to constrain the foot within the footwear to avoid injury to foot by hitting against<br><br>
outside objects. Both the sandals available in the Indian market are not able to take care of this aspect.<br>
9.	The existing footwear is very costly cannot be afforded by most of the diabetic patients.<br>
10.	There is no footwear available in the Indian market for healing of foot sole ulcers.<br>
11.	One model of the shoe available in the western world is meant for healing of foot sole ulcers in the fore foot areas only and that design is not efficient since it is not designed by the stress analysis of the foot-shoe composite model. Therefore, it is not able to unload and reduce the foot sole stresses around the ulcer region to the required extent and thus it takes considerable time (4 to 6 months) for healing of ulcers.<br>
12.	There are no footwear (sandals or shoes) available in India or in the westem world for healing of foot sole ulcers in the heel as well as the in the mid-foot region of the diabetic foot.<br>
Because of the limitations listed above, it has become very essential and urgent to develop appropriate footwear (sandals to be used in southern India for tropical weather and shoes for use in cold weather or as per the need of the profession) for use by the diabetic patients for prevention of foot sole ulcers and healing of foot sole ulcers (if they already exist) in all parts of the foot sole area.<br>
This invention   "A Novel Diabetic Footwear for Prevention of Foot Sole Ulcers"  has many improvements as compared to earlier used footwear.<br>
1.	The new footwear (different designs of sandals and shoes) for diabetic subjects are unique, have new features and many improvements are made as compared to the existing devices. They are designed based on engineering principles of unloading the foot sole to reduce the foot sole stresses or pressures to prevent the foot sole ulcers or healing them (if they already exist) quickly. This is done by stress analysis of three dimensional foot-footwear composite model by using finite element method so as to select dimensions of footwear such as thickness, hardness and materials of footwear insole, outer sole and rocker bottom and its location (wherever it is used) to minimize the foot sole stresses appropriately for prevention and healing of foot sole ulcers, in all regions of the foot sole, within a short time (within 3 to 4 weeks time).<br>
2.	The new footwear is able to constrain the diabetic foot within the footwear by appropriate adjustable straps to prevent external injuries.<br>
3.	It is able to take care of any swelling in the diabetic foot and also have an appropriate grip on the foot by adjustable straps provided with buckle and Velcro straps.<br>
4.	The straps in the footwear or shoe uppers are provided with soft inner linings to avoid or minimize friction between foot and footwear, thus prevent foot ulcers.<br>
5.	The new footwear for healing of diabetic foot sole ulcers is provided with novel aesthetic design of rocker with its axis appropriately located in different parts of the outer sole to reduce the foot sole stresses in the ulcer and other regions to speed up the process of healing.<br>
6.	The new footwear is light, comfortable and will be made available at low cost (3 to 10 times less than the commercially available footwear depending upon the type of footwear used by the diabetic patients).<br><br>
7.	The new footwear will be made available in all foot sizes, for ladies and men and in 3 colours, depending on the choice of the diabetic subject.<br>
8.	The insoles and outer soles of the new footwear are of appropriate thickness, hardness and weight to minimize foot sole stress or pressure (about 3 times less than the commercially available footwear),<br>
9.	The new footwear is comfortable, can heal foot sole ulcers in all regions of the foot sole in 3 - 4 weeks time which is 5 - 6 times faster than the healing time needed for footwear available in the westem world.<br>
10.	The new footwear (sandal as well as shoe type) has insole made of micro-cellular rubber (MCR) of appropriate quality, hardness, thickness, and washable insole which does not absorb water, and has high durability.<br>
