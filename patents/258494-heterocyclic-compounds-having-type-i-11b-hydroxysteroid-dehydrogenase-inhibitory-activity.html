				<td>Description Heterocyclic   compounds   having   type   I   116   hydroxysteroid   dehydrogenase inhibitory activity<br>
Field of the invention [0001]<br>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutically usuful compound with an inhibitory activity to βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, hereinafter referred to as 11β-HSD-l<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
116-HSD-l is an enzyme that converts inactive steroids, ll6-dehydrosteroid into its active steroids and is considered to be important in the basal metabolic rate in the living body (Non-patent Document 1). Moreover, 116-HSD-l knockout mice have the resistance to hyperglycemia induced by obesity or stress (Non-patent Document 2). In addition, a similar phenomenon was observed in human on administration of 116-HSD-l inhibitor, carbenoxolone (Non-patent Document 3). These facts suggest that the 116-HSD-l inhibitors could be useful as drugs for the treatment of insulin independent diabetes or obesity (Non-patent Document 4). [0003]<br>
Patent document 1 describes that pyrazole derivatives are useful as herbicide. Patent document 2 describes that pyrazole derivatives are useful as pesticide. Patent document 3 describes that pyrazole derivatives are useful as herbicide. Patent document 4 describes that pyrazole derivatives are   useful   as   insecticide.       Patent   document   5   describes   that   pyrazole<br><br>
derivatives are useful as insecticide. Patent document 6 describes that pyrazole derivatives are useful as pesticide. Patent document 7 describes that pyrazole derivatives are useful as herbicide. The compounds disclosed in these patents have the carbamoyl group that is substituted with a substituent selected from a group consisting of substituted aryl, substituted arylalkyl, substituted heteroaryl and alkyl at 4-position of the pyrazole ring, and they are different from the compounds in the present invention.<br>
Furthermore the compounds having straight alkyloxy at 5-position on the pyrazole ring are disclosed in patent document 8 and useful for the treatment of schizophrenia, and they are different from the present invention.<br>
Moreover patent document 9 describes that the pyrazole derivatives shown below are useful as a cannabinoid receptor agonist, but does not describe the inhibitory activity to llβ-HSD-1.<br><br>

Male C57BL/6J Jcl mice were purchased from CLEA Japan at the age of 6 weeks. After 1-week preliminary rearing, the mice were used for this study at the age of 7 weeks<br>
(2)	Rearing conditions<br>
The mice were placed at an animal room, where was set at room temperature of 23 ± 2°C and humidity of 55 ± 10%, and lighting cycle time was 12 hours [light (8:00 - 20:00)/dark (20:00 - 8:00)]. The mice were allowed free access to solid laboratory food (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and sterile tap water through the preliminary rearing and experimental periods.<br>
(3)	Identification of animals and cages<br>
The mice were identified by tail marking with an oil marker pen. Labels identifying the study director, purchased date, strain, sex and supplier were placed on each cage. The mice were housed by 20 mice/cage in the preliminary rearing period, and 3 mice/cage in the experimental period.<br>
(4)	Group composition<br>
Oral administration: 20 mg/kg (n=3) Intravenous administration: 5 mg/kg (n=3)<br>
(5)	Preparation of dosing formulation<br>
Dosing suspension for oral administration was prepared using 0.5%<br>
methyl    cellulose     (1500     cP)    aqueous    solution.	Dosing    solution    for<br>
intravenous    administration    was    prepared    using    N-dimethylacetamide    / polyethyleneglycol 400 (1/2).<br>
(6)	Dosing method<br>
As to oral administration, the dosing suspension at 10 mL/kg was administered into the stomach using a feeding tube. As to intravenous administration, the dosing solution at 2.5 mL/kg was administered into the<br><br>
caudal vein using a glass syringe.<br>
(7)	Evaluation items<br>
The blood samples were collected from the heart at each sampling point. The drug concentration in plasma was measured using HPLC or LC/MS/MS.<br>
(8)	Statistical analysis<br>
The   area   under   the   plasma   concentration-time   curve   (AUG)   was calculated by WinNonlin, and the bioavailability was calculated by the AUG values after oral and intravenous administration. [0105]<br>
