TITLE ARTHROPODiCIDAL ANTHRANILAMIDES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to certain anthranilamides, their iV-oxides, agriculturally suitable<br>
salts and compositions, and methods of their use for control of invertebrate _Bgsis_sxich-aff<br>
arthropods in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments.	The control of invertebrate pests such as arthropods is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals,, nursery crops, stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds which are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

15 as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, /z-propyl, z"-propyl, or the different butyl isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form iV-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form iV-oxides.  One skilled in the art will also<br>
20 recognize that tertiary amines can form iV-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of iV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and 7rc-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as f-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane.<br>
25 These methods for the preparation of JV-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive"Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, pp 18-20, A. J.

Dehydration of the compound of Formula 16 to give the compound of Formula 17, followed by converting the carboxylic ester function to  carboxylic acid, affords the compound of Formula 4.  The dehydration is effected by treatment with a catalytic amount of a suitable acid.  This catalytic acid can be, for example but not limitation, sulfuric acid. The reaction is generally conducte4 using an organic solvent. As one skilled in the art will realize, dehydration reactions may be conducted in a wide variety of solvents in a temperature range generally between about 0 and 200 °C, more preferably between about 0 .and 100oC\ FSV THE dehydration in  222 the method of Scheme B, 3 solvent comprising "seetic acid and temperatures of about 65 °C are preferred.   Carboxylic ester compounds can be converted to carboxylic acid compounds by numerous methods including nucleopbilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed:, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224-269 for a review of methods). For the method of Scheme 8, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred.   Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides.  For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid.    Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric ^cid3 yields the carboxylic acid of Formula 4. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystalhzation, extraction and distillation.<br>
Compounds of Formula 15 can be prepared by the method outlined in Scheme 9.<br><br>

Treatment of a compound of Formula 23 with a halogenating reagent, usually in the presence of a solvent, affords the corresponding halo compound of Fonnula 22.    Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides,   thionyl   chloride,   dihalotrialkylphophoranes,  dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride and phosgene.    Preferred are phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides.    To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus oxyhalide versus the compound of Formula 23 should be used, preferably between about 0.33 and 1.2 equivalents.    To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula 23 should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1,0 equivalents.  Compounds of Formula 23 wherein R6 is C1-C4 alkyl are preferred for this reaction.    Typical solvents for this halogenation include halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobutane and the like, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, diethyl ether, and the like, and polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like.   Optionally, an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline or the like, can be added.   Addition of a catalyst, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, is also an option.   Preferred is the process in which the solvent is acetonitrile and a base is absent. Typically, neither a base nor a catalyst is required when acetonitrile solvent is used. The preferred process is conducted by mixing<br><br>

the compound of Formula 23 in acetonitrile. The halogenating reagent is then added over a convenient time, and the mixture is then held at the desired temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction temperature is typically"between 20 °C and the boiling point of acetonitrile, and the reaction time is typically less than 2 hours. The reaction mass is then 5 neutralized with an inorganic base, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like, or an organic base, such as sodium acetate. The desired product, a" compound of Formula 22, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, extraction and distillation.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula 22 wherein R3 is Br or CI can be prepared by 10     treating the corresponding compounds of Formula 22 wherein R3 is a different halogen (e.g., CI for making Formula 22 wherein R3 is Br) or a sulfonate group such as^-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and methanesulfonate with hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively.   By this method the R3 halogen or sulfonate substituent on the Formula 22 starting compound is replaced with Br or CI from hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, 15     respectively.   The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dibromomethane, dichloromethane or acetonitrile.   The reaction can be conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel.   When R3 in the starting compound of Formula 22 is a halogen such as CI, the reaction is preferably conducted in such a way that the hydrogen halide generated from the reaction is removed by sparging or 20     other suitable means.   The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 °C, most conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10 to 40 °C), and more preferably between about 20 and 30 °C.    Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst (such as aluminum tribromide for preparing Formula 22 wherein R3 is Br) can facilitate the reaction.   The product of Formula 22 is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, 25     including extraction, distillation and crystallization.   Further details for this process are illustrated in Example 10.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula 22 wherein R3 is CI or Br can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 23 as already described. Starting compounds of Formula 22 wherein R3 is a sulfonate group can likewise be prepared from corresponding 30 compounds of Formula 23 by standard methods such as treatment with a sulfonyl chloride (e.g.,p-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine) in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane; further details for this process are illustrated in Example 11.<br>

wherein R6 is C1-C4 alkyl, and X is a leaving group.<br>
In this method, instead of being halogenated as shown in Scheme 11, the compound of 5     Formula 23 is oxidized to the compound of Formula 17a.   The reaction conditions for this oxidation are as already described for the conversion of the compound of Formula 22 to the compound of Formula 17 in Scheme 10.<br>
The compound of Formula 17a is then alkylated to form the compound of Formula 17b by contact with an alkylating agent CF3CH2X (24) in the presence of a base.   In the 10     alkylating agent 24, X is a nucleophilic reaction leaving group such as halogen (e.g., Br, I), OS(0)2CH3 (methanesulfonate), OS(0)2CF3, OS(0)2Ph-£-CH3 (p-toluenesulfonate), and the like; methanesulfonate works well. The reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one equivalent of a base. Suitable bases include inorganic bases, such as alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) carbonates and hydroxides, and organic bases, such as 15     triemylamine, diisopropylethylamine and l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene.  The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, which can comprise alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, toluene and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, and polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, such as such as acetonitrile, iV^-dimethylformamide, and the like. Alcohols 20     and polar aprotic solvents are preferred for use with inorganic bases. Potassium carbonate as base and acetonitrile as solvent are preferred. The reaction is generally conducted between about 0 and 150 °C, with most typically between ambient temperature and 100 °C.   The product of Formula 17b can be isolated by conventional techniques such as extraction. The ester of Formula 17b can then be converted to the carboxylic acid of Formula 4 by the 25     methods, already described for the conversion of Formula 17 to Formula 4 in Scheme 8.

wherein R6 is C1-C4 alkyL<br>
In this method, a hydrazine compound of Formula 18 is contacted with a compound of Formula 25 (a fumarate ester or maleate ester or a mixture thereof may be used) in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base is typically a metal alkoxide salt, such as sodium methoxide,   potassium   methoxide,   sodium   ethoxide,   potassium   ethoxide,   potassium tert-butoxi&amp;e, lithium tert-bntoxide, and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus the compound of Formula 18 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents. Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 25 should be used, preferably between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, iV^-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up the fumarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 18 and the base in the solvent. The mixture can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 25 added over a period of time.    Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 °C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the solvent.   Temperatures between about 30 and 90 °C are generally preferred.   The addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows.  Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours.   Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 18 and Formula 25.  After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature.   Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time may be from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times are 10 to 60 minutes.  The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and the like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, the -C02R6 function on the compound of Formula 23 may be hydrolyzed to -C02H; for example, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can promote such hydrolysis.   If the carboxylic acid (-C02H) is formed, it can be converted back to -CO2R6 wherein R6 is C1-C4 alkyl using esterification methods well-known in the art.   The desired product, a compound of<br><br>

To a 2-L four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser, and nitrogen inlet was charged acetonitrile (1000 mL), ethyl 2-(3-chloro-2-pyridinyl)-5-oxo-3-pyrazolidinecarboxylate (i.e. the product of Step A) (91.0 g, 0.337 mol) and phosphorus   oxychloride  (35.0.mL,   0.375 mol).     Upon  adding  the  phosphorus oxychloride, the mixture self-heated from 22 to 25 °C and a precipitate formed.  The light-yellow slurry was heated to reflux at 83 °C over a period of 35 minutes, whereupon the precipitate dissolved.   The resulting orange solution was held at reflux for 45 minutes, whereupon it had become black-green. The reflux condenser was replaced with a distillation head, and 650 mL of solvent was removed by distillation. A second 2-L four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer was charged with sodium bicarbonate (130 g, 1.55 mol) and water (400 mL).    The concentrated reaction mixture was added to the sodium bicarbonate slurry over a period of 15 minutes. The resulting, two-phase mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 minutes, at which time gas evolution had ceased. The mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (250 mL) and then was stirred for 50 minutes.   The mixture was treated with Celite® 545 diatomaceous earth filter aid (11 g) and then filtered to remove a black, tarry substance that inhibited phase separation. Since the filtrate was slow to separate into distinct phases, it was diluted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and water (200 mL) and treated with more Celite® 545 (15 g).    The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel. The heavier, deep green organic layer was separated., A rag layer (50 mL) was refiltered and then added to the organic layer.  The organic solution (800 mL) was treated with magnesium sulfate (30 g) and silica gel (12 g), and the slurry was stirred magnetically for 30 minutes.   The slurry was filtered to remove the magnesium sulfate and silica gel, which had become deep blue-green. The filter cake was washed with dichloromethane (100 mL).   The filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator.   The product consisted of dark amber oil (92.0 g, 93% yield).

Formulation/Utility<br>
Compounds of this invention will generally be used as a formulation or composition 5 with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids  such  as  solutions  (including  emulsifiable concentrates),  suspensions,<br>
10 emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active<br>
15 ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent<br>
20     and surfactant within the following approximate ranges that add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Giride, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. McCutcheon"s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, Allured Publ. Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foanij caking, corrosion, microbiological growth and the like, or thickeners to increase viscosity.<br>
Surfactants include, for example, polyethoxylated alcohols, polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, dialkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, organosilicones, AyV-dialkyltaurates, lignin sulfonates, naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, polycarboxylates, and polyoxy-ethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers. Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite and kaolin, starch, sugar, silica, talc, diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Liquid diluents include, for example, water, 7\yV-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, JV-alkylpyrrolidone, ethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene carbonate, dibasic esters, paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, oils of olive, castor, linseed, rang, sesame, corn, peanut, cotton-seed, soybean, rape-seed and coconut, fatty acid esters, ketones such as cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, isophorone and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, and alcohols such as methanol, cyclohexanol, decanol, benzyl and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.<br>
Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Dusts and powders can be prepared by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill. Suspensions are usually prepared by wet-milling; see, for example, U.S. 3,060,084. Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active-material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques.

(In the context of this disclosure "invertebrate pest control" means  inhibition of invertebrate pest development  (including mortality) that causes significant reduction in feeding or other injury or damage caused by the pest; related expressions  are  defined analogously.)     As referred to in this  disclosure,  the term "invertebrate pest" includes arthropods, gastropods and nematodes of economic importance as pests. The term "arthropod" includes insects, mites, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs and symphylans. The term "gastropod" includes snails, slugs and other Stylommatophora.     The  term  "nematode"  includes  all  of the  helminths,   such  as: roundwonns, heartworms, and phytophagous nematodes (Nematoda), flukes (Tematoda), Acanthocephala, and tapeworms (Cestoda).  Those skilled in the art will recognize that not all compounds are equally effective against all pests.  Compounds of this invention display actmty against economically important agronomic and nonagronomic pests.    The term "agronomic" refers to the production of field crops such as for food and fiber and includes the growth of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, oats, barley, rye, rice, maize), soybeans, vegetable crops (e.g., lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, beans), potatoes, sweet potatoes, grapes, cotton, and tree fruits (e.g., pome fruits, stone fruits and citrus fruits). The term "nonagronomic" refers to other horticultural (e.g., forest, greenhouse, nursery or ornamental plants not grown in a field), public (human) and animal health, domestic and commercial structure, household, and stored product applications or pests.   For reason of invertebrate pest control spectrum and economic importance, protection (from damage or injury caused by invertebrate pests) of agronomic crops. of cotton, maize, soybeans, rice, vegetable crops, potato, sweet potato, grapes and tree fruit by controlling invertebrate pests are preferred embodiments of the invention. Agronomic or nonagronomic pests include larvae of the order Lepidoptera, such as armyworms, cutworms, loopers, and heliothines in the family Noctuidae (e.g., fall armyworm   {Spodoptera fiigiperda   J.

In certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, compositions of the present invention can further comprise a biologically effective amount of at least one additional invertebrate pest control compound or agent having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant protection compound (e.g., protein) or the locus of the plant with a biologically effective amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection and be advantageous for resistance management.<br>
Invertebrate pests are controlled in agronomic and nonagronomic applications by applying one or more of the compounds of this invention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present invention further comprises a method for controlling an invertebrate pest, comprising contacting the invertebrate pest or its environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent. Examples of suitable compositions comprising a compound of the invention and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent include granular compositions wherein the additional biologically active compound or agent is present on the same granule as the compound of the invention or on granules separate from those of the compound of this invention.<br>
A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternatively, a granular composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are also effectively delivered through plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the soil, a nursery box<br><br>

Compounds are also effective by topical application of a composition comprising a compound of this invention to the locus of infestation, Other methods of contact include application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, gels, seed coatings, microencapsulations, systemic 5 uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others. The compounds of this invention may also be impregnated into materials for fabricating invertebrate control devices (e.g., insect netting).<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into baits that are consumed by the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising 10 between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99% vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates, particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often 15 application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl 20     butoxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest"s life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal 25 circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square meter but as little as 0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required. 30 One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.<br>
The following Tests in the Biological Examples of the Invention demonstrate the control efficacy of compounds of this invention on specific pests. "Control efficacy" represents inhibition of arthropod development (including mortality) that causes significantly 35 reduced feeding. The pest control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Table A for compound descriptions. The following abbreviations are used in the Index Table which follows: t is tertiary, n is normal, i is iso, s is secondary, Me is methyl, Et is ethyl, Pr is propyl and Bu is butyl; accordingly<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
TESTA For evaluating control of diamondback moth {Plutella xylostella) the test unit consisted of a small open container with a 12-14-day-old radish plant inside. This was pre-infested 5 with 10-15 neonate larvae on a piece of insect diet by use of a core sampler to remove a plug from a sheet of hardened insect diet having many larvae growing on it and transfer the plug containing larvae and diet to the test unit. The larvae moved onto the test plant as the ditt plug dried out.<br>
Test compounds were formulated using a solution containing 10% acetone, 90% water 10 and 300 ppm X-77® Spreader Lo-Foam Formula non-ionic surfactant containing alkylarylpolyoxyethylene, free fatty acids, glycols and isopropanol (Loveland Industries, Inc.), unless otherwise indicated. The formulated compounds were applied in 1 mL of liquid through a SUJ2 atomizer nozzle with 1/8 JJ custom body (Spraying Systems Co.) positioned 1.27 cm (0.5 inches) above the top of each test unit. All experimental compounds in this 15 screen were sprayed at 50 ppm and replicated three times. After spraying of the formulated test compound, each test unit was allowed to dry for 1 hour and then a black, screened cap was placed on top. The test units were held for 6 days in a growth chamber at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity. Plant feeding damage was then visually assessed.<br>
