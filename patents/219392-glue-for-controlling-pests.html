				<td>GLUE LINE USE OF BIFENTHRIN IN WOOD PRODUCTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to wood and wood preservation and more particularly<br>
the treatment of wood, wood composites, veneer based products and<br>
engineered wood products during manufacture to protect against attack from<br>
wood destroying organisms (eg. termites, beetles and borers). The active<br>
ingredient is applied via addition to the resin or glue system and results in<br>
treatment of the wood based product through a glue line treatment. Glue line<br>
treatments may be used as a stand alone method or used in conjunction with<br>
surface treatments of wood and engineered wood products using bifenthrin or<br>
other synthetic pyrethroids and/or active chemicals.<br>
This invention also pertains to all products treated by these processes and<br>
active chemicals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bifenthrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide/acaracide that is classified as a<br>
non-cyano pyrethroid. The active ingredient is efficacious to target pests<br>
through both contact and stomach action. As with most synthetic pyrethroids<br>
bifenthrin is active against a wide range of pests including Coleoptera, Diptera,<br>
Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera as<br>
well as a number of species of Acarina. Bifenthrin is currently registered in a<br>
number of countries throughout the world for the control of a wide range of<br>
pests.<br>
Bifenthrin is used extensively in both crop and non-crop markets including : but<br>
not limited to the cotton, small grains, vegetable, turf and ornamental,<br>
professional pest control, greenhouse, grain protection, home garden and<br>
mosquito control industries. However the art in this field does not indicate that<br>
it was used in the timber preservation industry for the control of subterranean<br>
termites prior to this invention.<br>
Tests have demonstrated that when using conventional treatment methods in<br>
the timber industry, very low rates of bifenthrin are required to protect timber<br>
against attack by termites (eg, Coptotermes spp, Mastotermes<br>
darwiniensis, &amp; Reticulitermes spp). Application rates range from 1 to 20 g<br>
ac/m3 (grams of active ingredient) depending upon the target species.<br>
Standard treatment methods in Australia and around the world currently require<br>
some penetration into the timber by the preservative. This can be achieved by<br>
vacuum pressure, vacuum-vacuum systems that require a treatment vessel<br>
and expensive peripheral and computerized equipment. The process time<br>
required to treat the timber varies depending on the product but takes at least<br>
45 minutes to treat wood. Penetration of preservatives can also be achieved<br>
by diffusion, a process which involves less expensive equipment but requires<br>
much more time and higher levels of stock holding. Wood moisture content is<br>
one of the most important parameters that control diffusion times. Wet wood is<br>
required to achieve diffusion within commercial expectancy. Full penetration of<br>
90 mm thick radiata pine green sapwood can be achieved between 4 to 8<br>
weeks.<br>
The inclusion of preservatives and active chemicals in glues during the<br>
manufacture of wood composites have been attempted on numerous<br>
occasions and even used by the industry over the years. The current list of<br>
products used in this manner has a number of shortcomings to meet all<br>
requirements of the industry, for example:<br>
Arsenic trioxide is a highly toxic inorganic material that poses an exceptionally<br>
high risk in use. The product has been banned from use in the majority of<br>
western countries with limited use for specific niche applications. Zinc Borate is<br>
another inorganic compound that requires high loadings to be effective. It is<br>
only specific for particle-based composites and not veneer based wood<br>
products.<br>
A number of organophosphate insecticides (Phoxim &amp; Chlorpyrifos) were<br>
recently removed from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Services (AQIS)<br>
list. China and Japan have now banned the use of these products as wood<br>
preservatives for the control of termites. CSIRO studies have shown that<br>
Chlopryrifos treatments at rates specified by different standards fail to protect<br>
the products against termite attack.<br>
Other synthetic pyrethrolds eg., deltamethrin, iambda-cyhalothrin, permethrin<br>
have been found to be either too irritating or unstable under high pH conditions<br>
(approximately 90% of permethrin has shown to be not effective when used for<br>
veneer based products manufactured with phenol formaldehyde resins).<br>
Before this invention the wood and wood composite industry did not have an<br>
effective option for an in-line treatment using preservatives or termiticides<br>
adding to the glue mix during manufacture of the products.<br>
These disclosed processes of treating engineered wood products by adding<br>
bifenthrin in the glue line during the manufacture of plywood, LVL, OSB and<br>
flake boards has not been known to be used in Australia or in any other<br>
country.<br>
Bifenthrin has been found to have specific properties that make it a candidate<br>
for this type of treatment. Bifenthrin is stable under conditions of high pH and<br>
elevated temperature, bonds strongly to organic materials (wood) and is<br>
significantly less water soluble than any other of the active ingredients used or<br>
attempted to be used in the past. Bifenthrin does not present any occupational<br>
health and safety problems and does not instigate pollutants when the treated<br>
product is burnt.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide glue line resin<br>
systems incorporating bifenthrin and methods and apparatus for the use of<br>
such glue line resin systems with bifenthrin as well as wood or engineered<br>
wood products manufactured using those resin and glue systems.<br>
BEST MODE AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bifenthrin has been found also to be very effective when used as a glue line<br>
additive to protect engineered and reconstituted wood products against the<br>
attack of termites and other insects.<br>
When using bifenthrin as an additive for Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) resins,<br>
about 25g ac/m3 and 100 g ac/m3 are required to protect the product against<br>
the attack of subterranean termites (Coptotermes spp and Mastotermes<br>
darwiniensis respectively). The quantifier "g ac/m3" refers to grams of active<br>
ingredient per cubic meter.<br>
Studies conducted using the drum test as described by the Australasian Wood<br>
Preservation Council (AWPC) protocols used a 9-ply 2.5 mm thick veneer<br>
plywood treated with bifenthrin as a glue line additive. Results confirm that low<br>
rates of 25 and 100 g ac/m3 of bifenthrin were sufficient to prevent<br>
subterranean termites (Coptotermes acinaciformis and Mastotermes<br>
darwiniensis respectively) from attacking the specimens. Tables 1 and 2 show<br>
these results.<br>
Table 1<br>

(Table Removed)<br><br>
Table 2<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
 (Reference: CSIRO Contract Number FFP 00/290 Report Number 995)<br>
Later studies were carried out to demonstrate that bifenthrin added to the glue<br>
line of engineered and reconstituted wood products was effective in preventing<br>
termite attack in products manufactured with s veneer up to 3.2 mm in depth.<br>
These studies were conducted in laboratory conditions in accordance with<br>
AWPC protocols. Results confirm that subterranean termites (Coptotermes<br>
acinaciformis) do not penetrate the glue line at any angle at rates of 25 g<br>
ac/m3. It also demonstrates that plywood manufactured using 2.5 mm veneer<br>
was effective in preventing attack from Mastotermes darwiniensis. (CSIRO<br>
Contract Number FFP 00/290 Report Number 995, CSIRO Contract Number<br>
FFP 01/273 Report Number 1137)<br>
Other studies conducted by CSIRO also confirm that a combination of glue line<br>
additives and face treatment would stop subterranean termite (Mastotermes<br>
darwiniensis) attack at rates lower than 100 g ac /m3. The results show that 50<br>
and 25 g ac/m3 addition of bifenthrin through the glue line and 20g ac/m3<br>
addition in the face veneers provided control equivalent to a standalone glue<br>
line treatment applied at the rate of 100 g ac/m3. (CSIRO Contract Number<br>
FFP 02/337 Report Number 1301)<br>
The repellent effect of bifenthrin as a Glue line additive is significantly<br>
influenced by particle size. This is particularly relevant when veneer based<br>
products are assembled with face veneers 3.2 mm or more in depth.<br>
Formulations that contain a mean particle size (of the active ingredient) of 0.1<br>
um or less will require both a glue line treatment and face treatment to stop<br>
termites from attacking the engineered wood product. However, where the<br>
mean particle size is 1-10 um, surface treatment is not needed. To prove this<br>
concept CSIRO conducted testing in laboratory conditions according to AWPC.<br>
Results confirm this novel concept. When veneer based composites using<br>
veneer thickness of 3.2 mm or more it was found that at equal loadings,<br>
formulations with bigger particle size would protect better the external veneer of<br>
the product. This is illustrated in the following table.<br>
Table 3<br>
Mass Loss (%w/w) due to termite attack on pluwood treated with bifenthrin<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Reference: CSIRO Contract Number FFP.02/337 Report Number 1301; Jim<br>
Creffield 2003 Preliminary Data for Bifenthrin Formulation Comparison)<br>
To have the same effect as formulations that contain larger bifenthrin particle<br>
sizes, formulations with small particle size will require higher loadings to<br>
achieve similar results. (Reference: CSIRO Contract Number FFP 02/337<br>
Report Number 1301; Jim Creffield 2003 Preliminary Data for Bifenthrin<br>
Formulation Comparison)<br>
Examples of formulation than can be used include micro-emulsions where the<br>
size particles are very small and the appearance of the solution is translucent,<br>
examples of this are 3 g/L ME formulation (Talstar™ 3 ME); emulsion<br>
concentrates where particles sizes are an average 0.1 um in diameter, an<br>
example of this is Bistar™ EC 100g/L (2.5% to 24% EC); suspension<br>
concentrates where particle size average range normally between 1-1O um, an<br>
example of this is Bistar™ 80 SC ; flowables formulations and wettable powder<br>
(WP) based formulations eg. Talstar™ 10 WP that contains larger particle<br>
sizes than suspension concentrates. This invention does not exclude other<br>
types of formulation containing bifenthrin or any formulation where bifenthrin is<br>
found in combination with other actives.<br>
Bifenthrin is stable at high pH and high temperatures. Phenol formaldehyde<br>
resins have a pH above 12. Phenol formaldehyde is the most common resin<br>
used for plywood and LVL manufacture. This high pH level degrades most<br>
common organic termiticides, bifenthrin is a rare exception. This was<br>
confirmed in a study conducted by QFRI where no degradation was observed<br>
24 hours after mixing bifenthrin with PF resins (Queensland Forest Research<br>
Institute Report prepared by Michael Kennedy - The Stability of Bifenthrin in<br>
Liquid Glues Report 1: Stability in Phenol-Formaldehyde plywood glue 2001).<br>
This stability accounts for other types of resins using in the industry named<br>
urea-formaldehyde, melamine urea-formaldehyde, polyurethane, acrylics,<br>
epoxy and isocyanides resins. Table 4 illustrates representative degradation<br>
thresholds or upper limits for bifenthrin and common organic termiticides.<br>
Table 4<br>
PH and temperature degradation limits for several organic termiticides<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It has been demonstrated, through degradation trials conducted during the<br>
commercial manufacturing of plywood and LVL, that when using a formulation<br>
containing bifenthrin at particle sizes above 1 urn the degradation observed is<br>
less than the one observed in bifenthrin formulations with particle sizes of less<br>
than 1um.<br>
Trials have demonstrated that bifenthrin can be dosed into the glue line during<br>
the batching of the resin mix or just prior to when the glue mix is used in the<br>
glue spreader or in any intermediate area between the batching of the resin<br>
mix and the application of the glue into the plies or before the resin is mixed<br>
into a usable glue.<br>
An example of how to mix bifenthrin formulation during the glue mix is as<br>
follows: (a) Calculate the spread or usage of the glue hi the composite product,<br>
for example that this is 70kg/m3 of a particular product (b) Calculate the<br>
additions required to achieve 25 g/m3 (c) The amount of bifenthrin is calculated<br>
by dividing the 25 g against the 70 kg of glue, this results in 0.36 g of bifenthrin<br>
per kilogram of glue.<br>
If the formulation used is Bistar™ 80 SC that contains 80 g/L of bifenthrin then<br>
0.36 g of bifenthrin will be contained in 4.5 ml of the formulation.<br>
According to the size of glue batch, for example 2000 Kg, it is required to add 9<br>
L of the formulation into the glue mix.<br>
There are several recipes for glues containing phenol formaldehyde resins.<br>
The following is an example to prepare a 1000 kg batch of resin based glue:<br>
615 kg of Phenol formaldehyde resin<br>
119 kg of wheat flour<br>
50 kg of macadamia flour<br>
211.5 L of water<br>
4.5 L of Bistar™ 80 SC<br>
The flour in the glue mixture is an agent added to improve spreadablity.<br>
The bifenthrin formulation can be added to the glue system in several steps of<br>
the manufacturing process, examples of this are: (a) Adding it to the resin or<br>
one component of the resin. This can be done by the resin supplier or by the<br>
end user, (b) Adding during glue batching (c) Adding to the glue transport or<br>
supply line before the glue is delivered to the equipment used to spread the<br>
glue into the laminates; or (d) Adding straight into the tanks of the equipment<br>
used to spread the glue into the plies.<br>
When added protection of the faces is required, pressed products can be<br>
treated by spraying the faces before they have cooled down. This is generally<br>
not needed when the particle size of the bifenthrin is about 1um or larger. The<br>
warmth in the product will create a hot-cold effect that will draw the applying<br>
solution deep into the face. Face treatments can also be applied onto a cold<br>
face, in this case we rely on the lathe checks as a pathway for the penetration<br>
of the chemical. Despite the fact that the penetration of a chemical when<br>
sprayed on cold faces is generally not as good as when spraying on warm<br>
faces, this can be improved by increasing the concentration of the chemical,<br>
increasing the uptake and wetting more of the faces, or by adding surfactants<br>
and chemicals that help the solution penetrate the faces better.<br>
The surface treatment effaces can be done by dipping, rolling, brushing,<br>
deluging, misting and spraying. These systems can be installed in different<br>
areas of the LVL, plywood or any other mill that produces engineered and<br>
reconstituted products either in-line or as a separate and distinct process. This<br>
depends of the lay-out of the production line or lines of a given mill.<br>
The invention contemplates products treated with the above processes and<br>
actives. Examples of these include, without excluding any other products that<br>
are treated in similar manner:<br>
Plywood<br>
Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL)<br>
Finger jointed products<br>
Oriented stranded boards (SB)<br>
Stranded Boards (SB)<br>
Glue laminated Lumber (Glu-Lam)<br>
Particle boards<br>
Medium Density Boards (MDF)<br>
Solid wood<br>
And any combination of the above<br>
Bifenthrin can be added to glue systems as described in this invention alone or<br>
in combination with other additives. Examples of these additives are: fungicides<br>
and fire retardants but not excluding other additives.<br>
Among the benefits of using bifenthrin as a glue line additive, in accordance<br>
with the teachings of the invention, are:<br>
1. Low rates of usage.<br>
2. Degradation of the bifenthrin due to elevated pH is minimal in a 24-48<br>
hour time frame. This allows dosing the resin in large batches.<br>
3. Degradation of bifenthrin due to the combination of the high pH of the<br>
resin and the temperature of the process of manufacture is acceptable.<br>
The degradation is less than 50% in a commercial situation.<br>
Similarly bifenthrin can be added to the glue line during the manufacture of<br>
engineered wood products that use other resin systems, e.g., melamine urea<br>
formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde resins, resorcinol, polyurethanes,<br>
isocynates, PVC, acrylics, isocyanates polyethylene and combination or<br>
hybrids in between these examples without excluding other resins and glue<br>
systems. The benefits are:<br>
1. Very low usage rates are required.<br>
2. There is acceptable degradation due to pH of the resin and temperature<br>
of the process.<br>
3. It is easy to dispose of the finished product due to very low or negligible<br>
dioxin emissions during burning of waste containing bifenthrin.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to particular preferred<br>
details of implementation, these should not be interpreted as limitations to the<br>
scope or spirit of the invention as reflected in the claims.<br><br><br>
