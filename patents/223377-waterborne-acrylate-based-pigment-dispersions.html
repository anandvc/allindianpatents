Waterbome acrylate-based pigment dispersions<br>
The present invention relates to waterbome pigment preparations, to processes for<br>
preparing them, to their use for dyeing and printing natural and synthetic fiber<br>
materials, to recording liquids, especially for the inkjet process, and to<br>
electrophotographic toners, powder coating materials, and color fitters.<br>
The inkjet process is a contactless printing process in which droplets of the recording<br>
liquid are guided from one or more nozzles onto the substrate that is to be printed. In<br>
order to obtain prints of high definition and resolution, the recording liquids and the<br>
colorants present therein are required to meet stringent requirements, especially with<br>
regard to purity, fineness of particles, stability on storage, viscosity, surface tension,<br>
and conductivity. Very stringent requirements are imposed in particular on color<br>
strength, shade, brilliance, and fastness properties, such as light fastness, water<br>
fastness, and rub fastness, for example. High light fastness in particular is of great<br>
importance for exterior inkjet applications and for the production of inkjet prints with<br>
photographic quality.<br>
The development of dyes which exhibit the desired combination of shade, brilliance,<br>
color strength, light fastness, and water fastness has so far proven very difficult, with<br>
the consequence that increasing interest is being focused on pigmented inks.<br>
Pigmented inkjet preparations known to date often fail to meet the requirements the<br>
inkjet industry imposes on them, exhibiting deficiencies in fine division, in thermal<br>
stability and in storage stability, and also often poor printability, especially in thermal<br>
printers.<br>
One important quality criterion of an inkjet preparation is its flocculation stability. In<br>
order not to clog the nozzles, the pigment particles must be smaller than 0.5 µm,<br>
preferably smaller than 0.1 µm. Moreover, crystal growth or particle agglomeration<br>
must be effectively prevented. This is generally achieved using certain dispersing<br>
aids. When an inkjet ink is printed, it flows at high speed through the nozzles. As a<br>
result of shearing and the effect of temperature, the stabilizing dispersing aid is often<br>
removed from the pigment surface. The pigment flocculates and clogs the nozzles of<br>
the printer. Another quality feature of an inkjet ink is its storage stability; in the course<br>
of storage, the pigment particles must not agglomerate to form larger particles.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide pigment preparations which satisfy<br>
the aforementioned requirements in respect of fine division, thermal stability, storage<br>
stability, printability, and coloristics.<br>
This object has been achieved, surprisingly, by dispersing the pigment in a special,<br>
water-soluble acrylate resin, defined below, in combination with a special dispersing<br>
aid. When the acrylate resin is used alone, the resulting pigment preparations have<br>
excellent storage properties, but the printability of the ink is inadequate. Similarly, the<br>
use of other dispersing aids in combination with the acrylate resin leads to pigment<br>
preparations lacking printability and stability on storage. The addition of the<br>
dispersing aid of the invention results in a poorer solubility of the acrylate resin in the<br>
liquid, so that the adsorption equilibrium of the resin is shifted positively in favor of<br>
the surface of the pigment. This prevents removal of additives under shearing, at<br>
high flow rate in the fine nozzles of the printer, from the surface of the pigment.<br>
The present invention provides an aqueous pigment preparation, comprising an<br>
organic and/or inorganic pigment dispersed in an acrylate resin solution and<br>
dispersing aid, wherein the acrylate resin is a copolymer composed essentially of<br>
from 50 to 80 mol% of monoalkenyl aromatics and from 20 to 50 mol% of acrylates<br>
and has an average molar mass Mv of between 1 000 and 50 000 g/mol and wherein<br>
the dispersing aid is a compound of the formula (I)<br>
R - O - (CH2-CH2-O)m - CH2 - COOM (I)<br>
in which<br>
R is a C10-C20 alkyl radical or a C10-C20 alkenyl radical,<br>

formers and/or binders for enhancing the adhesion and abrasion resistance.<br>
Amines, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N,N-dimethyl-<br>
ethanolamine or diisopropylamine, for example, serve primarily to raise the pH of the<br>
pigment preparation, especially inkjet ink. They are normally present at from 0 to<br>
10% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight, in the pigment preparation and<br>
the inkjet ink prepared from it.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparing such pigment<br>
preparations, which comprises finely dispersing the pigment in the acrylate resin<br>
solution and the dispersing aid of the formula (I) using a dispersing apparatus,<br>
preferably a stirred ball mill, which is operated with a peripheral stirrer speed of more<br>
than 12 m/s, employing nonmetallic grinding media with a diameter of less than or<br>
equal to 1 mm, in the presence of water. The remaining additives may be present<br>
during fine division and/or may be added subsequently. The acrylate resin is<br>
advantageously used in the form of an aqueous solution, as described above.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of the pigment preparations of the<br>
invention as colorants for inks, especially inkjet inks, electrophotographic toners,<br>
especially addition-polymerization toners, powder coated materials, and color filters.<br>
The pigment preparations of the invention are suitable as colorants in<br>
electrophotographic toners and developers, such as one- or two-component powder<br>
toners (also called one- or two-component developers), magnetic toners, liquid<br>
toners, addition-polymerization toners, and further, specialty toners.<br>
Typical toner binders are addition-polymerization resins, polyaddition resins,<br>
polycondensation resins, such as styrene, styrene-acrylate, styrene-butadiene,<br>
acrylate, polyester or phenol epoxy resins, polysulfones, polyurethane, individually or<br>
in combination, and also polyethylene and polypropylene, which may include yet<br>
further ingredients, such as charge control agents, waxes, or flow aids, or may have<br>
these added to them subsequently.<br>
The preparations of the invention are further suitable as colorants in powders and<br>
powder coating materials, especially in triboelectrically or electrokinetically sprayed<br>
powder coating materials which are used for surface coating articles made, for<br>
example, of metal, wood, plastic, glass, ceramic, concrete, textile material, paper or<br>
rubber.<br>
As powder coating materials use is made typically of epoxy resins, carboxyl- and<br>
hydroxyl-containing polyester resins, polyurethane resins, and acrylic resins,<br>
together with customary hardeners. Combinations of resins are also employed. For<br>
instance, epoxy resins are frequently used in combination with carboxyl- and<br>
hydroxyl-containing polyester resins. Typical hardener components are, for example,<br>
acid anhydrides, imidazoles and also dicyandiamide and their derivatives, capped<br>
isocyanates, bisacylurethane, phenolic and melamine resins, triglycidyl<br>
isocyanurates, oxazolines, and dicarboxylic acids.<br>
The preparations of the invention are also suitable as colorants for color filters, and<br>
also for both additive and subtractive color generation.<br>
By inkjet inks are meant not only waterborne inks (including microemulsion inks) but<br>
also nonaqueous (solvent-based) inks, and inks which operate in accordance with<br>
the hotmelt process.<br>
Microemulsion inks are based on organic solvents, water, and, where appropriate,<br>
an additional hydrotropic substance (interface mediator). Inks on a nonaqueous<br>
basis comprise essentially organic solvents and, where appropriate, a hydrotropic<br>
substance.<br>
The present invention additionally provides inkjet recording liquids containing<br>
generally from 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably from 1.5 to 8% by weight, of the<br>
pigment preparation of the invention, based on the total weight of the recording<br>
liquid.<br>
Microemulsion inks consist essentially of from 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably from<br>
1.5 to 8% by weight, of the pigment preparation of the invention, from 5 to 99% by<br>
weight of water, and from 0.5 to 94.5% by weight of organic solvent and/or<br>
hydrotropic compound.<br>
Solvent-based inkjet inks consist essentially of from 0.5 to 15% by weight of the<br>
pigment preparation of the invention and from 85 to 94.5% by weight of an organic<br>
solvent and/or hydrotropic compound. Carrier materials for solvent-based inkjet inks<br>
may be polyolefins, natural rubber and synthetic rubber, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl<br>
chloride-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinyl butyrates, wax/latex systems or<br>
combinations thereof, which are soluble in the "solvent".<br>
Hotmelt inks are based predominantly on organic compounds, such as waxes, fatty<br>
acids, fatty alcohols or sulfonamides, which are solid at room temperature and<br>
become liquid on heating, the preferred melting range being situated between about<br>
60°C and about 140°C. The invention also provides a hotmelt inkjet ink consisting<br>
essentially of from 20 to 90% by weight of wax, from 1 to 10% by weight of the<br>
pigment preparation of the invention, from 0 to 20% by weight of the additional<br>
polymer (as "dye dissolver"), from 0 to 5% by weight of dispersing aid, from 0 to 20%<br>
by weight of viscosity modifiers, from 0 to 20% by weight of plasticizers, from 0 to<br>
10% by weight of tack additive, from 0 to 10% by weight of transparency stabilizer<br>
(which prevents, for example, crystallization of the waxes), and from 0 to 2% by<br>
weight of antioxidant.<br>
The inkjet inks of the invention can be prepared by dispersing the pigment<br>
preparation of the invention into the microemulsion medium or into the aqueous or<br>
nonaqueous medium or into the wax for preparing a hotmelt inkjet ink.<br>
The invention further provides a set of pigment preparations that includes at least<br>
one colorant preparation in each of the colors black, cyan, magenta, and yellow,<br>
wherein at least one of the preparations corresponds to the preparation of the<br>
invention.<br>
Preference is given in this context to a set of pigment preparations whose black<br>
preparation includes carbon black as colorant, especially a gas black or furnace<br>
black; whose cyan preparation includes a pigment from the group of the<br>
phthalocyanine pigments, especially the Colour Index pigments Pigment Blue 15,<br>
Pigment Blue 15:3 or Pigment Blue 15:4; whose magenta dispersion includes a<br>
pigment from the group of the quinacridones, preferably Colour Index Pigment<br>
Red 122 or Colour Index Pigment Violet 19, or from the group of the monoazo,<br>
disazo, isoindoline or benzimidazolone pigments, especially the Colour Index<br>
pigments Pigment Red 57:1, Pigment Red 146, Pigment Red 176, Pigment Red 184,<br>
Pigment Red 185 or Pigment Red 269; and whose yellow preparation includes<br>
preferably a pigment from the group of the monoazo, disazo, isoindoline or<br>
