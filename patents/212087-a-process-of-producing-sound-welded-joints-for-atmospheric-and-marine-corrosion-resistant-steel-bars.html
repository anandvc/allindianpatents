				<td>The present invention relates to  a  process of  producing sound  welded   Joints_foratmospheric -  and marine - corrosion resistant  steel bars  using SMAW technique.<br>
The invention  relates   more  particularly to  a  process for producing welded  joints  in  TMT r-ebars.<br>
The examples  of thermo-mechanically treated   (TMT) atmospheric - and marine  - corrosion resistant steel bars   are respectively type Cu - TMT   (500)  and  type Cu - Cr - TMT   (500),<br>
having chemical compositions  as given  in Table I from which<br>
it  is noted tha the only difference between bars is  in respect of<br>
their Cu/Cr/Ni  content.     The  Joints  produced by both butt  -and lap -  welding of such bacs  using the  conventional   "Shield Metal  Arc  Welding"   (SMAW)  method  are occasionally associated with welding defects due  to improper selection of welding parameters,  leading to  premature failure of such bars in their end-use applications.<br>
The object of the  present invention  is  provide  a process for  producing  adequately strong  and defect-free welded   Joints in Cu-TMT(500)  and Cu-Cr TMT   (500) type  steel bars.<br>
In the conventional  SMAW process  of welding,   an  arc  is generated  between a coated  electrode wire  and  a base metal by momentarily touching the base metal by the  electrode wire, which produces enough heat for melting both the base metal  and electrode wire at the  areas to be welded.<br>
The electrode wire metal  is thereby transferred  into the pool of molten base metal and  gets deposited on the base metal surface on  solidification of both the molten electrode    and base<br><br>
metal    as the position of electrode wire end is shifted along the base metal surface to be welded.    The electrode    wire metal deposited on the base metal gets covered by a slag produced from the heated coating material of the    electrode wire.    A protective gaseous shield is produced by decomposition of the heated coating material of the electrode to envelop the arc.<br>
The main steps followed in the invented process are  :-(i)    joint preparation and number of passes for butt welding;<br>
(ii)    selection of electrode wire and its coating material; (iii)    optimisation of the conditions for welding; (iv)    evaluation of properties and soundness of the welded Joints produced.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying drawings,  in which<br>
Figure 1  is a schematic lay-out of the conventional SMAW method of welding;<br>
Figure 2 is  a schematic lay-out of butt-welding process;    and<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic lay-out of single lap-welding process.<br>
Referring to Fig.  1,  an arc A is produced between electrode wire E, having a coating C and the region B of the base metal M to melt both the base and electrode wire metal there.    The droplets D of the molten electrode wire metal are deposited on the molten base metal pool to form a pool of<br><br>
molten weld metal W there, which on solidification produces a deposit of solidified weld metal S on the base metal M.    A layer of slag G is formed on the solidified weld metal S by deposition of heated coating material of the electrode wire E. A protective gaseous shield H is formed by the decomposition products of the heated coating material of the electrode wire. The slag layer G and the protective gaseous shield H prevent the weld metal W from oxidation.    The direction T of moving the electrode wire is shown to be from the left-hand end to the right-hand end of the base metal M.<br>
The electrode wire used in the process is of a low hydrogen type conforming to AWS A 5.5 E 8018-V code.<br>

type of Steel Bars Welded.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Referring to Fig.  2 the adjacent ends X and Y of two bars M1  and M2 are butt-welded by adopting seven passes of the welding electrode wire under the welding conditions outlined in Table - II.<br>
Table - II Conditions for Butt-Welding<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the adjacent surfaces of two bars M1 and M2 are joined by single lap-welding over the overlapping length V of the bars under conditions followed for the two types of bars, namely, Cu-TMT(500) and Cu-Cr-TMT(500), as outlined in Table - III.<br>
Table - III<br>

	Welding Conditions. <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The properties of the butt- and single lap-welded Joints produced in the process on the two types of steel bars, namely Cu-TMT  (500) and Cu-Cr-TMT  (500), have been tested and the typical test results are presented in Table - IV.<br>
The presence of defects in the welded joints has been evaluated by LEI,        . MPI and radiography.    The joints welded in the process are found to be substantially defect-free (Table - IV).<br>
Table - IV<br>
Typical Properties of the Butt- and Single Lap-welded Joints.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* NSD : No significant defects.<br>
The results of Table - IV show that ultimate tensile strength  (UTS) of the joints produced in the process is appreciably higher than the minimum requirement stipulated for the satisfactory end-use performance of the bars containing the welded joints.<br>
Based on the studies conducted,   as described above, the optimum conditions for welding of both Cu-TMT and Cu-Cr-TMT bars have been found to be as follows  :<br>

diameter of 2.5 mm    and 10 to 15 KJcm1 for electrode diameter of 3.15 mm for both of Cu-TMT and Cu-Cr-TMT bars.<br>
(v)      Current-Voltage-Heat Input Combination for both Cu-TMT and Cu-Cr-TMT bars -<br>

(vi)      Electrode Inter-pass temperature - 225°C max. (vii)      Post-Welding heat treatment - Normally not necessary;<br>
in case of any specific requirement,  the heat treatment temperature is chosen so that mechanical strength of the welded joint is not unduly affected.<br><br>
