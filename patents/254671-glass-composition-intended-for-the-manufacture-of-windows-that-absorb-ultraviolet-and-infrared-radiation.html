GLASS COMPOSITION INTENDED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF<br>
WINDOWS THAT ABSORB ULTRAVIOLET AND INFRARED RADIATION<br>
The invention relates to a glass composition of the<br>
soda-lime-silica type that absorbs infrared and<br>
ultraviolet radiation. More precisely, the invention<br>
relates to a glass composition for the production of<br>
flat glass products by floating on a bath of molten<br>
metal such as tin (the "float" process) , these flat<br>
glass products being intended especially, but not<br>
exclusively, for forming the windshields and front side<br>
windows of a vehicle.<br>
Automotive glazing is subject to very strict<br>
requirements. In terms of optical properties, these<br>
requirements are sometimes governed by regulations, for<br>
example as regards the light transmission of a<br>
windshield. Glazing intended for the production of a<br>
windshield must therefore have an overall light<br>
transmission factor (TLA) under illuminant A of at<br>
least 75%. Glazing intended for the production of front<br>
side windows must have, under the same conditions, a<br>
TLA factor of at least 70%. The energy transmission of<br>
windows is often reduced in order to improve the<br>
thermal comfort of the user or to decrease the emission<br>
of gases harmful to the environment by reducing the<br>
consumption of vehicles fitted with air conditioners.<br>
To prevent the internal furnishings from being<br>
degraded, automobile manufacturers require that windows<br>
also have a low ultraviolet radiation transmission.<br>
Windows that have the ability to absorb both in those<br>
parts of the light spectrum corresponding to infrared<br>
and to ultraviolet therefore meet these requirements.<br>
Such glazing is usually manufactured by the float<br>
process, which comprises the melting of batch materials<br>
and the floating of the molten glass on a bath of<br>
molten metal, generally tin, in order to form a glass<br>
ribbon. This ribbon is then cut into sheets, which may<br><br>
subsequently be bent or undergo a treatment to increase<br>
their mechanical properties, for example a thermal or<br>
chemical toughening treatment.<br>
The compositions suitable for the production of float<br>
glass are generally composed of a glass matrix of the<br>
soda-lime-silica type and frequently include agents<br>
that absorb in certain regions of the optical spectrum<br>
(colorants and/or agents that absorb infrared and/or<br>
ultraviolet radiation).<br>
The soda-lime-silica matrix conventionally used for<br>
this type of glass comprises the following constituents<br>
(in percentages by weight:<br><br>
The optical absorbent agent most commonly used is iron,<br>
present in the glass both in ferric iron form, in which<br>
form ultraviolet radiation is absorbed, and in ferrous<br>
iron form, which absorbs mainly infrared radiation.<br>
Glasses containing only iron as optical absorbent agent<br>
usually have a green color due to the presence of the<br>
two aforementioned ionic forms: precise control of the<br>
relative quantities of ferric iron and ferrous iron<br>
(and therefore of the "redox" defined as the ratio by<br>
weight of ferrous iron expressed as FeO to the amount<br>
by weight of total iron expressed as Fe203) makes it<br>
possible to achieve the coloration and the optical<br>
performance that are desired.<br>
However, it is apparent that the protection against<br>
ultraviolet radiation afforded by iron oxide alone may<br>
prove to be insufficient. To alleviate this drawback,<br><br>
it has been proposed to add agents to the glass matrix<br>
that absorb specifically in the UV, such as cerium<br>
oxide (CeO2) or titanium oxide (TiO2) .<br>
Thus, WO-A-91/07356 has proposed soda-lime-silica glass<br>
3 to 5 mm in thickness, the infrared and ultraviolet<br>
transmission properties of which are obtained by adding<br>
0.7 to 1.2 5% iron oxide, given a redox value of 0.23 to<br>
0.29, CeO2 and, optionally, TiO2. The glass described<br>
consists of a conventional soda-lime-silica matrix that<br>
includes magnesium oxide in an amount greater than 3%.<br>
EP-A-469 446 also describes standard glass with a soda-<br>
lime-silica matrix. Its optical properties are obtained<br>
by using glass with a redox of less than 0.275, with a<br>
total iron oxide content of greater than 0.85% and with<br>
a limited content of CeO2, of less than 0.5%. The glass<br>
described is rich in iron oxide and oxidized, and<br>
therefore inexpensive as it exploits to the maximum the<br>
capability of ferric iron to absorb ultraviolet rays,<br>
so as to add a minimum amount of CeO2. However, one<br>
drawback of oxidized glass lies in their lower<br>
absorption in the infrared, this absorption being<br>
provided by ferrous ions.<br>
WO-A-94/14716 describes glass whose matrix composition<br>
is modified so as to give it greater absorption in the<br>
infrared and lower absorption in the visible, hence<br>
increased infrared selectivity (that is to say the<br>
ratio of light transmission to energy transmission). An<br>
essential characteristic of such a matrix is its low<br>
amount of MgO (0 to 2%) . The glass described possesses<br>
a redox of between 0.28 and 0.30 and, in certain cases,<br>
has good ultraviolet absorption properties thanks to<br>
the addition of cerium oxide.<br>
Patent US 6 133 179 describes the use of tungsten oxide<br>
WO3 in glass having various matrices, including the<br>
modified matrix described in the aforementioned<br><br>
application WO-A-94/14716, so as to obtain low<br>
ultraviolet transmission values.<br>
The aforementioned glasses have the major drawback of<br>
having a high manufacturing cost because they contain<br>
cerium oxide, possibly titanium oxide and/or tungsten<br>
oxide, these oxides being very expensive. Although<br>
present in small amounts, these oxides contribute in<br>
fact to significantly increasing the cost of the glass.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
glass composition of the soda-lime-silica type that is<br>
both inexpensive and capable of forming a glass<br>
possessing transmission properties in the visible,<br>
infrared and ultraviolet that are at least equivalent<br>
to those of known compositions that can be used as<br>
automotive glazing, especially as the windshield and<br>
front side windows of a vehicle.<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose a<br>
glass composition capable of being processed under the<br>
conditions of the float process, by floating the glass<br>
on a bath of molten metal.<br>
These objects are achieved according to the present<br>
invention by the composition of the soda-lime-silica<br>
type comprising the oxides below, in contents varying<br>
within the following limits by weight:<br><br>
and the absorbent agents below, in contents varying<br>
within the following limits by weight:<br><br><br>
the glass having a redox factor of 0.23 or less and<br>
containing no tungsten oxide WO3.<br>
It should be pointed out here that the soda-lime-silica<br>
glass composition may contain, apart from the<br>
inevitable impurities, a small proportion (up to 1%) of<br>
other constituents, for example agents (SO3, Cl, Sb2O3,<br>
As2O3) that help the melting or refining of the glass,<br>
or constituents deriving from a possible addition of<br>
recycled cullet into the glass batch.<br>
Within the context of the invention, the term "redox"<br>
is understood to mean the ratio of the weight content<br>
of ferrous iron expressed in FeO form to the weight<br>
content of total iron expressed in Fe2O3 oxide form.<br>
The glasses according to the invention have a light<br>
transmission (TLA) generally of 65% or higher, for<br>
example 70%, and an energy transmission (TE) of 46% or<br>
less, or 44% or less and even 43% or less for a<br>
thickness of 3 to 5 mm. In accordance with the<br>
invention, the light transmission (TLA) is defined as<br>
that calculated using illuminant A, the ultraviolet<br>
transmission (TUV) is defined as that calculated<br>
according to the ISO 9050 standard and the energy<br>
transmission (TE) is defined as that calculated using<br>
the Parry Moon (air mass = 2) solar spectral<br>
distribution.<br>
The selectivity is defined as the ratio of the light<br>
transmission (TLA) to the energy transmission (TE) for<br>
a given thickness.<br>
The composition according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to obtain a glass having a high selectivity,<br><br>
this being particularly advantageous when it is<br>
intended to form automotive glazing. This is because<br>
such a glass makes it possible to limit heat-up due to<br>
solar radiation and consequently to increase thermal<br>
comfort in the passenger compartment. Preferably, the<br>
selectivity of the glass for a thickness varying from 3<br>
to 5 mm is 1.60 or higher, or 1.62, and better still<br>
1.65 or higher.<br>
The composition according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to obtain a glass preferably having, for a<br>
thickness varying from 3 to 5 mm, a TUV not exceeding<br>
14%, especially 12% and even 10%.<br>
In the glasses according to the invention, the silica<br>
SiO2 is generally kept within very narrow limits for<br>
the following reasons: above about 8 0%, the viscosity<br>
of the glass and its ability to devitrify greatly<br>
increase, making it more difficult to melt it and to<br>
pour it onto a bath of molten tin, while below 65% the<br>
hydrolytic resistance of the glass rapidly decreases,<br>
as does also the transmission in the visible.<br>
The alkali metal oxides Na2O and K2O facilitate melting<br>
of the glass and make it possible to adjust its<br>
viscosity at high temperature so as to keep it close to<br>
that of a standard glass. K2O may be used up to about<br>
5%, as above this the problem of the high cost of the<br>
composition arises. Moreover, the percentage content of<br>
K2O may be increased essentially only to the detriment<br>
of Na2O, which contributes to increasing the viscosity.<br>
The sum of the Na2O and K2O contents expressed as<br>
percentages by weight, is preferably at least 10% and<br>
advantageously less than 20%, especially 15% or less or<br>
even 14% or less. This is because below 15% it appears<br>
that the ferric ions have a modified chemical<br>
environment, which increases their capability of<br>
absorbing ultraviolet radiation. This compensates in<br>
particular for the absence of tungsten oxide.<br><br>
Alkaline-earth metal oxides allow the viscosity of the<br>
glass to be adapted to the glass production conditions.<br>
MgO also plays a particularly important role in the<br>
transmission properties of the glasses, owing to its<br>
effect of modifying the shape of the ferrous iron<br>
absorption band. Its content must necessarily not<br>
exceed 2%. Preferably, the MgO content of the glasses<br>
according to the invention must not exceed 1%, or even<br>
0.5%.<br>
CaO makes it possible to reduce the viscosity of the<br>
glass at high temperature and to increase its<br>
hydrolytic resistance. The lowering of the MgO content<br>
is preferably compensated for with the oxide CaO,<br>
rather than SiO2 and Na2O, for viscosity and cost<br>
reasons respectively. For these various reasons, the<br>
CaO content is preferably 9% or higher, and more<br>
preferably 10.5% or higher.<br>
BaO makes it possible to increase the light<br>
transmission and it can be added to the composition<br>
according to the invention with a content of less than<br>
5%. BaO has a much weaker influence than MgO and CaO on<br>
the viscosity of the glass and the increase in its<br>
content is essentially made to the detriment of the<br>
alkali metal oxides, MgO and in particular CaO. Any<br>
large increase in BaO therefore contributes to<br>
increasing the viscosity of the glass, especially at<br>
low temperatures. Preferably, the glasses according to<br>
the invention contain no BaO.<br>
Apart from respecting the limits defined above for the<br>
variation in the content of each alkaline-earth metal<br>
oxide, it is preferable, in order to obtain the desired<br>
transmission properties, to limit the sum of the<br>
percentages by weight of MgO, CaO and BaO to a value of<br>
15% or less.<br><br>
By using the absorbent agents within the limits of the<br>
invention it is possible for the optical properties of<br>
the glass to be optimally adjusted and for the desired<br>
performance to be achieved.<br>
As indicated above, iron oxide is present in the form<br>
of ferric or ferrous ions. The ferric ions absorb in<br>
the ultraviolet and give a slight yellow-to-green<br>
color, whereas the ferrous ions absorb strongly in the<br>
infrared, while giving the glass a blue color. The<br>
redox plays a key role in obtaining the properties of<br>
the glass of the present invention. Under the redox<br>
conditions usually employed within the context of a<br>
float installation, and in the absence of other<br>
colorants, the glasses containing iron oxide have a<br>
green color as already explained. The optical<br>
properties of ferrous iron are due to an absorption<br>
band having its maximum absorption around a wavelength<br>
ranging from 1000 to 1100 nm (and therefore in the<br>
infrared range) and extending into the range of visible<br>
wavelengths. The effect of modifying the glass matrix<br>
as described in application WO-A-94/14716, and<br>
especially the effect of reducing the MgO content in<br>
the glass matrix, is to modify the shape of this<br>
absorption band, in particular shifting it toward the<br>
infrared. This results in glasses having higher<br>
infrared selectivity, i.e. a lower energy transmission<br>
than that of glasses with a standard matrix, for an<br>
equivalent light transmission.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly discovered that by<br>
producing the glass with a modified matrix under<br>
oxidizing conditions (with a redox of 0.23 or less and<br>
preferably of 0.19 or less) with a particular iron<br>
content, it is possible to obtain glasses having light,<br>
energy and ultraviolet transmission properties similar<br>
to those of glasses with a standard matrix, but more<br>
economically as it is unnecessary to use as large an<br><br>
amount of cerium oxide and/or titanium oxide. The<br>
effect of the matrix composition, especially the low<br>
MgO content, on obtaining optical properties of the<br>
same degree as those exhibited by a conventional glass<br>
using a lower content of cerium and/or titanium oxides<br>
has proven to be quite unexpected.<br>
According to the invention, the iron oxide content may<br>
vary from 0.7 to 1.6%. When the content is less than<br>
0.7%, the transmission of the glasses obtained is too<br>
high, especially in the infrared and ultraviolet<br>
ranges. A content of greater than 1.6% does not provide<br>
a light transmission that meets the regulatory<br>
requirements for use as an automobile windshield or<br>
front side window. Furthermore, the melting of such<br>
compositions with a high iron content is made<br>
difficult, especially when it is carried out in an<br>
open-flame furnace owing to the presence of a large<br>
quantity of ferrous iron, the latter being responsible<br>
for too low a transmission of the radiation emitted by<br>
the flames in the glass bath. Preferably, the iron<br>
oxide content of the glasses according to the invention<br>
is at least 0.8%, but advantageously at most 1.3% and<br>
better still at most 0.95%.<br>
The redox of the glass is maintained at a value of 0.23<br>
or less, for example 0.19, for reasons associated<br>
essentially with the optical properties of the glasses<br>
obtained, but also with the melting and refining of the<br>
glass. To control the redox, it is possible to use<br>
known oxidizing agents, such as sodium sulfate, and/or<br>
reducing agents such as coke in a suitable amount. The<br>
economic advantage of the glasses according to the<br>
invention is at its optimum when the glasses are<br>
oxidized, since the main UV absorbent agent is then<br>
ferric iron. Another advantage of using oxidized<br>
glasses in the production of glazing with a low UV<br>
transmission stems from the fact that the thermal<br>
toughening very significantly reduces the TUV of the<br><br>
glazing, this being the more so the higher the ferric<br>
iron content of the glass. The redox of the glasses<br>
according to the invention is therefore maintained<br>
preferably at contents of 0.19 or less, more preferably<br>
0.18 or less. Since highly oxidized glasses are more<br>
difficult to refine and have a yellow tint undesirable<br>
for esthetic reasons, the redox of the glasses<br>
according to the invention is preferably maintained at<br>
above 0.12, preferably above 0.15.<br>
Cerium oxide CeO2, present in the glass in the form of<br>
Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, is advantageous as it exhibits low<br>
absorption in the visible. Owing to its high cost, CeO2<br>
contents not exceeding 0.9% or 0.7%, and better still<br>
not exceeding 0.5%, are preferred.<br>
Titanium oxide TiO2 plays a similar role to cerium<br>
oxide when it is in the presence of ferrous oxide FeO.<br>
Although the maximum content provided within the<br>
context of the invention may reach 1.5%, it is<br>
preferable for it not to exceed 0.1% in order to<br>
prevent the appearance of a yellow coloration. Such a<br>
value corresponds to the content usually encountered<br>
owing to the degree of purity of the batch materials<br>
employed (inevitable impurities). Advantageously, the<br>
glass composition according to the invention contains<br>
no titanium oxide.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention may<br>
also contain other colorants for adjusting the tint of<br>
the glass. As an example, mention may be made of the<br>
colorants chosen from transition elements such as CoO,<br>
Cr2O3, NiO, Se, V2O5, CuO, or else from rare-earth<br>
oxides, such as Er2O3, La2O3, Nd2O3. In particular to<br>
compensate for the possible yellow color due to the<br>
presence of TiO2 and/or to significant oxidation of the<br>
glass, it is possible to use up to 10 ppm of cobalt<br>
oxide CoO and/or up to 5 0 ppm of copper oxide CuO. In<br>
general, the total content of these colorants is less<br><br>
than 0.1% and most often the composition contains no<br>
other colorants than iron oxide and cerium oxide.<br>
One particularly suitable composition for producing a<br>
relatively thin glass sheet, with a thickness of around<br>
3.15 mm, includes the absorbent agents below within the<br>
following limits by weight:<br><br>
Such a composition possesses a redox ranging from 0.15<br>
to 0.22, preferably 0.15 to 0.19, and makes it possible<br>
to obtain a glass having, for a thickness of 3.15 mm, a<br>
light transmission TLA of greater than 70%, an<br>
ultraviolet transmission of less than 12% and a<br>
selectivity of greater than 1.62. This thin glass pane<br>
may be paired with a another clear glass pane and the<br>
combination can then be laminated to form a laminated<br>
glass having a light transmission TLA of greater than<br>
70%.<br>
Another composition particularly suitable for producing<br>
a glass sheet with a thickness of around 3.85 mm,<br>
useful for forming automotive glazing, includes the<br>
absorbent agents below within the following limits by<br>
weight:<br><br>
Such a composition possesses a redox ranging from 0.16<br>
to 0.22, preferably 0.16 to 0.19, and makes it possible<br>
to obtain a glass having, for a thickness of 3.85 mm, a<br>
light transmission TLA of greater than 70%, an<br>
ultraviolet transmission of less than 12% and a<br>
selectivity of greater than 1.62.<br>
Another composition particularly suitable for the<br>
production of a glass sheet with a thickness of around<br>
4.85 mm, useful for forming windows for trucks or<br><br>
buses, includes the absorbent agents below within the<br>
following limits by weight:<br><br>
Such a composition possesses a redox ranging from 0.18<br>
to 0.22, preferably 0.18 to 0.19, and makes it possible<br>
to obtain a glass having, for a thickness of 4.85 mm, a<br>
light transmission TLA of greater than 70%, an ultra-<br>
violet transmission of less than 12% and a selectivity<br>
of greater than 1.62.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention can be<br>
melted under the conditions for the production of float<br>
glass. The melting generally takes place in open-flame<br>
furnaces, possibly provided with electrodes for heating<br>
the glass in the bulk by passing an electrical current<br>
between the two electrodes. To facilitate melting, and<br>
especially to make this mechanically useful, the glass<br>
composition advantageously has a temperature<br>
corresponding to a viscosity η such that logr| = 2 which<br>
is less than 1500°C, preferably a temperature<br>
corresponding to a viscosity η, expressed in poise,<br>
such that logη = 3.5 (this temperature being denoted by<br>
Tlogη=3.5) and a liquidus temperature (denoted by Tliq)<br>
which satisfy the equation:<br><br>
and preferably the equation:<br><br>
The subject of the invention is also a window,<br>
especially for an automobile, comprising at least one<br>
glass sheet having the composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
A better appreciation of the advantages of the present<br>
invention will be gained from the examples of glass<br>
compositions given below.<br><br>
In these examples, the values of the following<br>
properties, calculated for a given thickness using an<br>
experimental spectrum, are indicated:<br>
the overall light transmission factor (TLA)<br>
under illuminant A, calculated between 380 and 780 nm.<br>
This calculation is carried out taking into<br>
consideration illuminant A, as defined by the ISO/CIE<br>
10526 standard and the CIE 1931 colorimetric reference<br>
observer, as defined by the ISO/CIE 10527 standard;<br>
the overall energy transmission factor (TE)<br>
integrated between 295 and 2500 nm according to the ISO<br>
9050 standard (Parry Moon, air mass 2) ;<br>
the selectivity (SE), defined as the ratio of<br>
the total light transmission (TLA) under illuminant A<br>
to the total energy transmission (TE);<br>
the ultraviolet transmission factor (TUV),<br>
calculated using the glass transmission spectrum<br>
between 2 90 and 3 80 nm according to the ISO 9 05 0<br>
standard; and<br>
the redox, defined as being the ratio of the<br>
mass content of ferrous iron (expressed as FeO) to the<br>
mass content of total iron (expressed as Fe2O3) .<br>
To determine the redox, the total iron (Fe2O3) content<br>
is measured by X-ray fluorescence and the ferrous iron<br>
(FeO) content is measured by wet chemistry, or<br>
calculated from the transmission spectrum using the<br>
Beer-Lambert law.<br>
Example 1 (according to the invention) and Example C2<br>
(comparative example) in Table 1 illustrate the<br>
advantage of the glasses according to the invention in<br>
terms of CeO2 savings compared to glasses with a<br>
standard matrix. The two glasses have the same optical<br>
properties (TLA = 71.1%; TE = 43.9%; TUV = 10.9%) for a<br>
thickness of 3.5 mm, these three quantities determining<br>
unequivocally the choice of the three characteristics<br>
of the composition, namely the total iron Fe2O3 content,<br>
the redox and the CeO2 content. It is clearly apparent<br><br>
that the example according to the invention is much<br>
less expensive than the comparative example, the amount<br>
of CeO2 added to achieve the desired TUV being less<br>
than half. For equivalent optical properties, the glass<br>
according to the invention is richer in iron, more<br>
oxidized and less expensive than the glass with a<br>
standard matrix.<br><br>
Tables 2, 3 and 4 are examples of glass compositions<br>
according to the invention that are particularly<br>
suitable for use as automotive glazing, with<br>
thicknesses of 3.85 mm, 3.15 mm and 4.85 mm,<br>
respectively.<br>
Each of the compositions indicated in these tables was<br>
produced from the following glass matrix, the contents<br>
of which are expressed in percentages by weight, the<br>
matrix being corrected in terms of silica in order to<br>
be adapted to the total content of absorbent agents<br>
