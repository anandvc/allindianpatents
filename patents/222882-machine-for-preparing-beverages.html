				<td>Title: MACHINE FOR PREPARING BEVERAGES<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a machine for the preparation of<br>
beverages, for instance a machine suitable for the preparation of a beverage<br>
starting from disposable containers, such as cartridges or the like.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Generally, in the machines of the known art of this type, at least one<br>
dispensing unit is present that is housed in the inside of an envelope. In<br>
particular, the dispensing unit comprises at least one collecting unit which<br>
can be removed for the necessary cleaning operations. The mounting of the<br>
collecting device in the dispensing unit is generally realized by means of a<br>
bayonet-coupling.<br>
The same collecting device has in the lower part a dispensing duct<br>
wherefrom the beverage prepared comes out to be in its turn conveyed<br>
through a duct that ends in the dispensing spout. The latter is obtained in an<br>
underlying covering plate that can be removed to allow the access to, and<br>
the removal of, the collecting device.<br>
As is obvious, the access to the collecting device in the mounting and<br>
removal operations is poorly practical and particularly tiresome. The<br>
collecting device, in fact, can be reached only by operating manually from the<br>
bottom of the dispensing duct. Besides being tiresome from the point of view<br>
of the operations necessary to place the collecting device in a bayonet-<br>
coupling system, it is worth stressing that there may arise health problems,<br>
as the "clean" collecting device is re-positioned by operating with a hand on<br>
the dispensing duct of the collecting device.<br>
A general object of the present invention is to provide a machine for<br>
dispensing beverages such as to render easier and safer for health the<br>
frequent operations which the collecting device is submitted to.<br>
A particular object of the present invention is to provide a machine for<br>
dispensing beverages such as to facilitate the access to the collecting<br>
device.<br>
Another particular object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
machine for dispensing beverages such as to facilitate the mounting and<br>
removal of the collecting device.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
These objects are achieved by the present invention that relates to a<br>
machine for the preparation of beverages, of the type comprising at least one<br>
dispensing unit housed in the inside of an envelope, said dispensing unit<br>
comprising at least one removable collecting device whose access is through<br>
at least one access window obtained in the envelope, and at least one<br>
removable covering element to occlude or selectively free the access<br>
window, characterized in that the access window faces the collecting device,<br>
and that the at least one covering element and the at least one access<br>
window comprise sliding guide means that are complementary to each other.<br>
In this way, it is possible to have access to the dispensing unit from<br>
the front and to operate directly on the bayonet-coupling by which the<br>
collecting device is held.<br>
The sliding guide means are oriented according to a sliding direction<br>
substantially parallel to the axis of the collecting device. Hence, one only<br>
vertical movement suffices to remove the covering element from the rest of<br>
the envelope.<br>
Suitably, locking means are provided to keep the covering element in<br>
the access window occluding position, such as for instance elastic snap-<br>
locking means.<br>
Preferably, the collecting device comprises at least one protruding<br>
handling portion to facilitate the positioning and the removal of said collecting<br>
device with respect to the dispensing unit. Besides facilitating the<br>
engagement and disengagement of the bayonet-coupling, this characteristic<br>
is more advantageous also from the point of view of health, as it allows the<br>
manipulation of the collecting device without touching the zones concerned<br>
by the passage of the dispensed beverages.<br>
Advantageously, the covering element comprises guide means that<br>
loosely engage the protruding handling portion when the collecting device is<br>
correctly mounted. In this manner, a key-mechanism is obtained that prevents<br>
the access window from closing if the collecting device is not correctly mounted<br>
in the bayonet-coupling.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Further advantages and characteristics of the present invention will be<br>
clearer thanks to the following description wherein reference is made to the<br>
accompanying drawings, wherein :<br>
- Figure 1 shows a portion of a machine for beverage dispensing<br>
according to the present invention, in correspondence of the access window to<br>
the dispensing unit;<br>
- Figure 2 is a perspective view of a covering element for a machine<br>
according to the present invention ;<br>
- Figure 3 is a perspective view of a collecting device for a machine<br>
according to the present invention ;<br>
- Figure 4 is another perspective view of the covering element of Figure 2 ;<br>
and<br>
- Figure 5 is a view that shows the coupling between the collecting device<br>
of Figure 3 and the covering element of Figure 4.<br>
Modes for carrying out the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a portion of a machine for the preparation of beverages 10<br>
in correspondence of window 20 allowing the access to the dispensing unit. For<br>
the sake of representation clearness, some details have been omitted, for<br>
instance the bayonet-coupling wherein the collecting device 40 engages.<br>
In the represented embodiment, envelope 11 of machine 10 also<br>
comprises an opening 12 allowing the insertion and the removal of a disposable<br>
cartridge (not shown) containing a preparation for the beverage to be dispensed.<br>
In correspondence of the access window 20, envelope 11 comprises<br>
edge portions 21 placed on the opposite sides of the window, which are<br>
provided for engaging in a sliding manner the inside of guide grooves 31<br>
obtained on the opposite sides of at least a first wall 34 of a covering<br>
element 30.<br>
The restraining of the covering element 30 in the occluding position of<br>
the access window 20 is realized, for instance, by locking elastic snap-<br>
means. In the embodiment shown herein, the locking elastic snap-means are<br>
realized, for instance, with one or more protrusions 32 obtained on elastically<br>
deformable arms 33, intended for engaging in special seats 22 obtained in a<br>
suitable position in the inside of machine 10.<br>
The covering element 30, shown with more details in Figures 2 and 4,<br>
which, for instance, may be realized from plastic material, comprises in<br>
particular a first substantially flat wall portion 34, parallel to the vertical axis of<br>
the collecting device 40 when the covering element 30 is slidingly engaged<br>
in the access window 20.<br>
On the external front part of the covering element 30, below the first<br>
portion of wall 34, a handling portion 35 is obtained that is provided, for<br>
instance, with protruding ribs 54, to facilitate the manual operations of<br>
positioning and removing the covering element 30.<br>
The covering element 30 also comprises a second wall portion 35<br>
substantially perpendicular to the first wall portion 34. In the embodiment<br>
shown herein, the second wall portion 35 is integral with the first wall portion<br>
34, but it is also possible to provide the wall portions as separate parts by<br>
providing means for connecting the separate parts in an articulated manner,<br>
or means allowing also the removable positioning of the part comprising the<br>
second wall portion 35.<br>
The covering element 30 also comprises a tubular portion 36 having a<br>
through-hole whose axis is perpendicular to the second wall portion 35. The<br>
tubular portion 36 is composed of a duct that ends in a dispensing spout 37<br>
wherefrom the prepared beverage comes out to be collected in a cup or a<br>
glass already placed under said spout.<br>
The tubular portion 36 has an internal diameter greater than the<br>
external diameter of the dispensing duct 46 (Figure 3) of the collecting device<br>
40, in such a manner that, when the covering element 30 is in the position<br>
occluding the access window 20, the dispensing duct 46 is housed at least<br>
partly in the inside of the tubular portion 36.<br>
The collecting device 40, shown with more details in Figure 3, is of the<br>
type intended for being engaged in a bayonet-coupling. A first protruding arm<br>
41 of the bayonet coupling is therefore provided, while in a diametrically<br>
opposed position the second arm 42 of the bayonet coupling extends to form<br>
a protruding handling portion 45 that allows the manipulation of the collecting<br>
device 40 in an easier and health-safer manner.<br>
Figure 5 shows the assembly composed of a covering element 30 and<br>
a collecting device 40 in a mutual coupling position, i.e. in the state where<br>
the covering element is in the position that occludes the access window 20.<br>
As can be observed, the covering element 30 advantageously comprises<br>
guide means, consisting for instance of a couple of flanges 38 that loosely<br>
engage the protruding handling portion 45 in such a manner as to realize a<br>
key-mechanism that prevents the covering element 30 from closing if the<br>
collecting device is not correctly mounted in the bayonet-coupling.<br>
