BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to reflector antenna radomes. More particularly, the invention relates to a reflector antenna radome with a backlobe suppression ring around the radome periphery<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
The front to back (F/B) ratio of a reflector antenna indicates the proportion of the maximum antenna signal that is radiated in any backward directions relative to the main beam, across the operating bând. Rearward signal patterns, also known as backlobes, are generated by edge diffraction occurring at the periphery of the reflector dish. Where significant backlobes are generated, signal interference with other RF systems may occur and overall antenna efficiency is reduced. Local and internaţional standards groups have defined acceptable F/B ratios for various RF operating frequency bands.<br>
Prior reflector antennas have used a range of different solutions to maintain an acceptable F/B ratio. For example, conical RF shields which extend forward of<br>
the reflector may be applied. However, shield structures increase the overall size, wind load and thereby structural requirements of the antenna, increasing overall antenna and antenna support structure costs. Edge profiling, chokes and or reflector edge notching/serration patterns have been formed in and or applied to the reflector dish periphery. However, these structures, in addition to significantly increasing the manufacturing costs of the resulting antenna, increase antenna wind loading and are typically optimized for a specific frequency bând which limits the available market segments for each specific reflector dish design, decreasing manufacturing efficiencies.<br>
F/B ratio is especially significant in modern shield less deep dish reflectors. Deep dish reflectors, by having a low focal length to reflector dish diameter ratio, may be formed with increased aperture efficiency and low side lobes without requiring peripheral shielding. However, to achieve these radiation patterns, the edges of the deep dish reflectors are designed to have higher signal illumination levels relative to shallow dish designs, increasing reflector edge diffraction and thereby generating significant backlobes.<br>
Competition within the reflector antenna industry has focused attention on RF signal pattern optimization, structural integrity, as well as materials and manufacturing operations costs. Also, increased manufacturing efficiencies, via standardized reflector antenna components usable in configurations adaptable<br>
for multiple frequency bands is a growing consideration in the reflector antenna<br>
market.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus that overcomes<br>
deficiencies in the prior art<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention is described in an exemplary embodiment applied upon a radome also having quick attach/detach features further described in US utility patent application serial number 10/604, Radius Twist Lock Radome and Reflector Antenna for Radome", Syed et al, filed August 14,2003 and hereby incorporated by reference in the entirety. The invention is described herein with respect to a single profile radome. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may also be applied, for example, to the dual radius radome configurations disclosed in the aforementioned application.<br>
As shown in Figure a typical deep dish reflector antenna 1 projects a signal from a feed 3 upon a sub reflector 5 which reflects the signal to illuminate the reflector 7. A radome 9 covers the open distal end of the reflector 7 to form an environmental seal and reduce the overall wind load of the antenna 1.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, a conductive ring herein after identified as a backlobe suppression ring (BSR) is formed around the radome 9 periphery. The BSR may be formed, for example, by metalising, or over molding the edge of the radome 9. Alternatively, the BSR may be formed by coupling a BSR formed of, for example, conductive rubber, metal, metallic foii, metallic tape or the like, about the radome 9 periphery. The conductive ring forming the BSR need not be continuous and or interconnected around the radome circumference, for example, the conductive ring may be formed as electrically isolated segments arranged around the periphery.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 2, where metalising or the like is used about the radome 9 periphery, the BSR 11 may be cost efficiently formed surrounding the inside 13 and the outside 15 of the radome 9 periphery. Preferably, the BSR is in electrical contact with the reflector 7 periphery. Thereby, electrica! gaps and or slots through which RF energy may pass to diffract from the reflector 7 outer edge are avoided.<br>
The radome 9 has an outer diameter adapted to enable coupling of the radome 9 upon the distal open end of the reflector 7. The BSR formed about the outer surface of the radome periphery does not significantly increase the radome outer diameter. Therefore, the addition of the BSR to the radome 9 does not significantly add to the antenna 1 wind load. Also, because the BSR 11 may be as formed as a thin metalised layer, it does not significantly increase weight and<br>
therefore the structural requirements of the antenna 1 or antenna 1 support structures.<br>
In operation, RF signals which would otherwise edge diffract rearward at the outward facing reflector 7 edge are instead trapped by the generally radially inward facing radome 9 outer 15 surface and or inner 13 surface edge (s) of the BSR Due to the inward facing edge (s) 16 presented by the BSR backwards edge diffracted energy overall is significantly reduced.<br>
Contrary to prior frequency specified serrated, notched or choke reflector edge configurations, the BSR may be applied without complex or precise design of the BSR geometry. A general limit of the BSR inner radius is that the BSR should not project inward to a point where it will significantly interfere with the forward beam pattern of the antenna 1, for example extending inward not substantially than an inner diameter of the reflector 7 distal end. To further minimize spill over in forward hemisphere, an absorber 17 may be applied between the radome 9 and the reflector 7. The absorber 17 may be formed from an RF absorbing material and or an RF absorbing coating applied to the radome 9 and or the reflector 7 periphery.<br>
Measured test range data, as shown in Figures 4a and 4b obtained from 1 foot diameter deep dish reflector antennas configured for operation at 12.7 GHz demonstrates the significant reduction generated by the present invention.<br>
The axial identified by the right and left edges of the e-plane and h- plane radiation patterns shown, are reduced by more than 10 dB through the addition of the BSR to the radome 9. Further, the aperture control of the antenna, outside of approximately plus or minus 80 degrees, is also significantly improved. The antenna of figures 4a and 4b has an outside surface BSR 11 with a width, measured from the radome 9 periphery towards the radome 9 center, of 22 mm.<br>
Similarly, Figure 5 shows test data from the same reflector and radome profile (different feed assembly) operating at 21.2 GHz. This antenna 1 has an outside 15 surface BSR with a width of 15 mm. Because the antennas of Figures 4a, 4b and 5 are able to gain the benefit of the present invention while using the same basic reflector dish and radome profile (but different feed assemblies) there is a significant manufacturing economy.The present invention brings to the art a radome which cost efficiently improves the F/B ratio of an antenna. The invention may be applied to new or existing antennas without significantly increasing the antenna weight and or wind load characteristics. The invention provides F/B ratio improvement independent of<br>
antenna operating frequency and does not place any additional requirements upon the design and or manufacture of the reflector 7 dish.<br><br>
(Table Removed) Where in the foregoing description reference has been made to ratios, integers, components or modules having known equivalents then such equivalents are herein incorporated as if individually set forth.<br>
