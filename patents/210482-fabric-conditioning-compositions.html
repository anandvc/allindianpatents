HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
164/MUMNP/2004<br><br>

WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions.  More specifically, the invention relates to fabric softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium compound and a long chain fatty<br>
10  compound.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known to provide liquid fabric conditioning 15  compositions which soften in the rinse cycle.<br>
 Such compositions comprise less than 7.5% by weight of softening active, in which case the composition is defined as "dilute", from 7.5% to about 30% by weight of active in 20  which case the compositions are defined as "concentrated" or more than about 30% by weight of active, in which case the composition is defined as "super-concentrated".<br>
In many markets around the world, it remains highly 25  desirable to provide dilute fabric conditioning compositions since many consumer express a preference for dilute compositions over semi-dilute, concentrated and super-concentrated compositions.  Such preferences include a more pleasing rheology and also because there is less chance of 30  overdosing a dilute composition whereas it is much easier to accidentally overdose a concentrated composition.<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
Furthermore,-â€¢ dilute compositions can be advantageous to the manufacturer.because the high levels of water present relative to the level of water in a concentrated composition<br>
5  makes the dilute composition easier to disperse in the rinse liquor without requiring additional expensive dispersion agents.  Other advantages of dilute compositions over concentrated compositions include greater stability upon storage due to the greater dilution of destabilising<br>
10  components such as perfumes.<br>
In traditional fabric conditioning compositions, non-ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening agents have been used although there is a trend away from such compounds to 15  ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening agents.<br>
It is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due to their inherent biodegradability.<br>
20 Such ester-linked quaternary ammonium compounds contain hydrocarhyl chains., which, can. be, unsaturated, partially,. hardened or fully saturated.<br>
It is particularly desirable to use substantially fully 25  saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and because they are more stable to oxidative degradation (which can lead to malodour generation) than partially saturated or fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
Of the types of ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamine which produce at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked component since the raw 5  material has a low melting temperature which enables the manufacturing process of the composition to occur at low temperatures.  This reduces difficulties associated with high temperature handling, transport and processing of the raw material and compositions produced therefrom.<br>
10<br>
However, a problem identified with dilute fabric conditioning compositions is their apparently inferior softening performance compared to a concentrated version of the same composition. Without being bound by theory it is<br>
15  believed that this stems from the poorer molecular packing of the quaternary ammonium softening material in the lamellar phase of the composition when water content is high.<br>
20  An additional problem associated with softening composition comprising quaternary ammonium softening materials based on triethanolamine (i.e. having a mixture of mono-, di- and tri-ester quaternary ammonium species) is their inferior softening performance, independent of their concentration,<br>
25  compared to those quaternary ammonium softening materials containing predominantly di-ester quaternary ammonium species.<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
Object of- the -Invention<br>
The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems, and, to give one or more of the 5  above-mentioned benefits desired by consumers.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that by incorporating a fatty component which comprises a long alkyl chain, such as a fatty alcohol or fatty acid (heneinafter referred to as<br>
10  "fatty complexing agent") into dilute softening compositions comprising a quaternary ammonium softening material having substantially fully saturated alkyl chains, at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked component, the softening performance of the<br>
15  compositions can be dramatically improved.<br>
It is believed that this is due to the mono-ester linked component (which does not contribute to softening) complexing with the fatty complexing material and thereby 2 0  providing a material which does contribute to softening.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a 25  fabric conditioning composition comprising:<br>
(a) less than 7.5% by weight of an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material comprising at least one mono-ester linked component and at least 30      one tri-ester linked component;<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
(b) a fatty compiexing agent;<br>
wherein the weight ratio of the mono-ester linked component of compound (a) to compound (b) is from 5:1 to 1:5. 5<br>
There is also provided a method for treatment of fabrics comprising contacting the above-mentioned composition with fabrics in a laundry treatment process.<br>
10  In the context of the present invention, the term<br>
"comprising" means "including" or "consisting of".  That is the steps, components, ingredients, or features to which the term "comprising" refers are not exhaustive.<br>
15  Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The compositions of the present invention are preferably rinse conditioner compositions, more preferably aqueous rinse conditioner compositions for use in the rinse cycle of 20  a domestic laundry process.<br>
Quaternary ammonium fabric softening material<br>
The fabric conditioning material used in the compositions of 25  the present invention comprises one or more quaternary ammonium materials comprising a mixture of mono-ester linked, di-ester linked and tri-ester linked compounds.<br>
By mono-, di- and tri-ester linked components, it is meant 3 0  that the quaternary ammonium softening material comprises, respectively, a quaternary ammonium compound comprising a<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
single ester-link with a fatty hydrocarbyl chain attached thereto, a quaternary ammonium compound comprising two ester-links each of which has a fatty hydrocarbyl chain attached thereto, and a quaternary ammonium compound 5  comprising three ester-links each of which has a fatty hydrocarbyl chain attached thereto.<br>
Below is shown typical levels of mono-, di- and tri-ester components in a fabric softening material used in the 10  compositions of the invention.<br><br>

Mono-ester	10-30<br>
Di-ester	30-60<br>
Tri-ester	10-30<br>
Free fatty acid	0.2-1.0<br>
Solvent	10-20<br>
The level of the'mone-ester linked component of'the quaternary ammonium material used in the compositions of the 15  invention is preferably between 8 and 40% by weight, based on the total weight of the raw material in which the quaternary ammonium material is supplied.<br>
The level of the tri-ester linked component is preferably 20  between 20 and 50% based on the total weight of the raw material in which the quaternary ammonium material is supplied.<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
Preferably, the average chain length of the alkyl or alkenyl group is at least C14, more preferably at least C16  Most<br>
preferably at least half of the chains have a length of C18.<br>
5  It is generally preferred if the alkyl or alkenyl chains are predominantly linear.<br>
The preferred ester-linked quaternary ammonium cationic softening material for use in the invention is represented 10  by formula (I):<br>
[(CH2)n(TR)]m<br>
15        R1-N+-[(CH2)n(OH)]3_m     x"	(I)<br>
wherein each R is independently selected from a C5.35 alkyl or alkenyl group, R represents a C1-4 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl 20  group or a C2-4 alkenyl group,<br>
0	0<br>
Tis       â€” 0 â€” C â€”  or   â€” C â€” O 25<br>
n is 0 or an integer selected from 1 to 4, m is 1, 2 or 3 and denotes the number of moieties to which it refers that<br>
pend directly from the N atom, and X is an anionic group,<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
such as halides or alkyl sulphates, e.g. chloride, methyl sulphate or ethyl sulphate.<br>
Especially preferred materials within this class are di-5  alkyl and di-alkenyl esters of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate.  Commercial examples of compounds within this<br>
formula are TetranylÂ® AHT-1 (di-hardened tallowyl ester of<br>
triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate 85% active), Ll/90 (partially hardened tallow ester of triethanol ammonium<br>
10  methyl sulphate 90% active), and L5/90 (palm ester of<br>
triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate 90% active), all ex Kao corporation), Rewoquat WE18 and WE2 0 (both are partially hardened tallow ester of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate 90% active), both ex Goldschmidt Corporation and Stepantex<br>
15  VK-90 (partially hardened tallow ester of triethanol<br>
ammonium methyl sulphate 90% active), ex Stepan Company).<br>
Iodine Value of the Parent Fatty Acyl group or Acid<br>
20  The iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 20, preferably from 0 to 5, more preferably from 0 to 2.  Most preferably the iodine value of the parent fatty acid or acyl group from which the<br>
25  quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 1.  That is, it is preferred that the alkyl or alkenyl chains are substantially fully saturated.<br>
If there is any unsaturated quaternary ammonium fabric 30  softening material present in the composition, the iodine<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
value,' referred-to- above, represents the mean iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compounds or fatty acids of all of the quaternary ammonium materials present.<br>
5  In the context of the present invention, iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the fabric softening material formed, is defined as the number of grams of iodine which react with 100 grams of the compound.<br>
10  In the context of the present invention, the method for calculating the iodine value of a parent fatty acyl compound/acid comprises dissolving a prescribed amount (from 0.1-3g) into about 15ml chloroform.  The dissolved parent fatty acyl compound/fatty acid is then reacted with 25 ml of<br>
15  iodine monochloride in acetic acid solution (0.1M).  To<br>
this, 20ml of 10% potassium iodide solution and about 150 ml deionised water is added. After addition of the halogen has taken place, the excess of iodine monochloride is determined by titration with sodium thiosulphate solution (0.1M) in the<br>
20  presence of a blue starch indicator powder.  At the same time a blank, is, determined with the same quantity of reagents and under the same conditions.  The difference between the volume of sodium thiosulphate used in the blank and that used in the reaction with the parent fatty acyl<br>
25  compound or fatty acid enables the iodine value to be calculated.<br>
The quaternary ammonium fabric softening material of formula (I) is present in an amount less than 7.5% by weight of 30   quaternary ammonium material (active ingredient) based on the total weight of the composition, more preferably from 1<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
to 6.8% by weight most preferably 2 to 5.5% by weight, e.g 2.2-5% by weight.<br>
Excluded quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
Quaternary ammonium fabric softening materials which are free of ester linkages or, if ester-linked, do not comprise at least some mono-ester component and some tri-ester component are excluded from the scope of the present invention.  For instance, quaternary ammonium compounds having the following formulae are excluded:<br>
TR2<br>
15     (R1)3N+	 (CH2)n â€” CH     x"<br>
CH2TR2<br>
wherein R1 , R2 , T, n and X are as defined above; and<br>
R3<br>
Rl â€” N â€” R2        X<br>
R4<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
where  to R4 are not interrupted by ester-links, R1 and R2 are C8-28 alkyl or alkenyl groups; R3 and R4 are C1-4 alkyl or C2-4 alkenyl groups and X is as defined above.<br>
5  Patty complexing agent<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a fatty complexing agent. It is believed that the fatty alcoho] provides a synergistic softening benefit with the quaternary 10  ammonium softening material which is particularly noticeable in dilute fabric conditioning compositions.<br>
The applicants believe that that this is due to the mono-ester linked component (which does not contribute to 15  softening) complexing with the fatty complexing material and thereby providing a material which does contribute to softening.<br>
Especially suitable fatty complexing agents include fatty 20  alcohols and fatty acids.  Of these, fatty alcohols are most preferred.<br>
Preferred fatty acids include hardened tallow fatty acid (available under the tradename Pristerene, ex Uniqema).<br>
25<br>
Preferred fatty alcohols include hardened tallow alcohol (available under the tradenames Stenol and Hydrenol, ex Cognis and Laurex CS, ex Albright and Wilson) and behenyl alcohol, a C22 chain alcohol, available as Lanette 22 (ex<br>
3 0  Henkel) .<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
The fatty complexing agent is present in an amount from 0.01% to 15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.  More preferably, the fatty component is 5  present in an amount of from 0.05 to 10%, most preferably from 0.1 to 5%, e.g. 0.3 to 4% by weight, or even 0.4 to 1.9% by weight.<br>
The weight ratio of the mono-ester component of the 10  quaternary ammonium fabric softening material to the fatty complexing agent is preferably from 5:1 to 1:5, more preferably 4:1 to 1:4, most preferably 3:1 to 1:3, e.g. 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
15  Calculation of Mono-ester Linked Component of the Quaternary Ammonium Material<br>
The quantitative analysis of mono-ester linked component of<br>
the quaternary ammonium material is carried out through the<br>
13 20  use of Quantitative  C NMR spectroscopy with inverse gated<br>
H decoupling scheme.<br>
The sample of known mass of the quaternary ammonium raw material is first dissolved in a known volume of CDCI3 along<br>
25  with a known amount of an assay material such as<br>
13 naphthalene.  A  C NMR spectrum Of this solution is then<br>
recorded using both an inverse gated decoupling scheme and a relaxation agent.  The inverse gated decoupling scheme is used to ensure that any Overhauser effects are suppressed 30  whilst the relaxation agent is used to ensure that the<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
negative consequences of the long t1relaxation times are overcome (ie adequate signal-to-noise can be achieved in-a reasonable timescale).<br>
5  The signal intensities of characteristic peaks of both the carbon atoms in the quaternary ammonium material and the naphthalene are used to calculate the concentration of the mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material.  In the quaternary ammonium material, the signal<br>
10  represents the carbon of the nitrogen-methyl group on the quaternary ammonium head group.  The chemical shift of the nitrogen-methyl group varies slightly due to the different degree of esterification; characteristic chemical shifts for the mono-, di- and tri-ester links are 48.28, 47.97 and<br>
15  47.76 ppm respectively. Any of the peaks due to the<br>
napthalene carbons that are free of interference from other components can then be used to calculate the mass of mono-ester linked component present in the sample as follows:-<br>
20      MassMQ   (mg/ml)   =   (massNaph x IMQ x NNaph x MMQ  )/(lNaph x NMQ x MNaph)<br>
where MassMQ = mass mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in mg/ml, massNaph = mass naphthalene in mg/ml, I = peak intensity, N = number of contributing nuclei and M = 25  relative molecular mass.  The relative molecular mass of naphthalene used is 128.17 and the relative molecular mass of the mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material is taken as 526.<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
The weight percentage of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material can thus be calculated:<br>
5  % of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material = (massMQ / mass HT-TEA) x 10 0<br>
where mass HT-TEA = mass of the quaternary ammonium material and both mass MQ AND mass HT-TEA are expressed as mg/ml. 10<br>

Example 1; Softening evaluation 15<br>
Sample A was prepared at 200 ml scale. The nonionic stabilising agent and the ester linked quaternary ammonium<br>
compound were heated together to between 50 and 60 C and<br>
stirred in order to provide a co-melt.  The co-melt was then 20  slowly added to water also at the same temperature while<br>
agitating  Af ter 10 minutes of mixing the- batch was cooled<br>
using recirculating cold water.  No shearing or milling was used during the process.<br>
25  Samples 1 and 2 were prepared by co-melting the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material, tallow alcohol and nonionic stabiliser together, heating water and adding the co-melt to the water under stirring.  Stirring was continued until a homogeneous mixture was formed.<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
Sample B is dilute Comfort (bought in UK August 2000). It does not contain any- fatty complexing agent and was dosed s that the level of softening agent was equivalent to that in sample A.<br>

5<br>
Softening results were assessed as follows:<br>
Softening performance was evaluated by adding an amount of each sample corresponding to 2.22g of the fabric softening 0  compound to 1 litre of Wirral tap water, at ambient temperature in a tergotometer.  Three pieces of terry towelling (8cm x 8cm, 40g total weight) were added to the<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
tergotometer pot.  The cloths were treated for 5 minutes at 65 rpm, spin dried to remove excess liquor and line dried overnight and conditioned at 21 C/65 relative humidity for<br>
24 hours.<br>
5<br>
Softening of the fabrics was assessed by an expert panel of 4 people using a round robin paired comparison test protocol.  Each panel member assessed four sets of test cloths.  Each set of test cloths contained one cloth of each<br>
0  test system under a evaluation.  Panel members were asked to assess softness on a 8 point scale.  Softness scores were calculated using an "Analysis of Variance" technique.  Lower values are indicative of better softening.  "Pref" denotes the number of votes cast during the round robin paired<br>
5  comparison exercise.<br>
The results are given in table 2. Table 2<br><br>
	Test 1 	Test 2	Test 3	Average<br>
Sample	Rank	Pref	Rank	Pref	Rank	Pref	Rank	Pref<br>
A	4.85	8	4.25	13	4.5	5	4.53	8.67<br>
B	4.25	73	3.25	77	3.5	65	3.67	71.67<br>
1	4.375	60	3	48	4	65	3.79	57.67<br>
2	4.25	59	4.125	62	4.125	65	4.16	62.00<br>
The softening results show that, in spite of the level of quaternary ammonium softening material present in sample A (higher than the combined level of quaternary ammonium<br><br>
WO 03/022971<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09853<br><br>
softening material and fatty alcohol in samples 1 and 2), the softening results for sample 1 and 2 are significantly better than those for sample A, thereby demonstrating a synergistic effect due to the combination of the quaternary 5  ammonium softening material and the fatty complexing agent. Furthermore, the softening performance of sample 1 is substantially as good as the premium brand fabric conditioner (which comprises a different quaternary ammonium material, having substantially higher amounts of di-ester 10  linked component, e.g. 80% or more by weight of the quaternary ammonium material is di-ester linked), traditionally considered to provide better softening performance than compositions comprising a quaternary ammonium material based on triethanolamine).<br><br>
