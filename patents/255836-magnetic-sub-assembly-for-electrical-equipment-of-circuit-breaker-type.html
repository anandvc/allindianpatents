				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention concerns a magnetic sub-assembly for an<br>
electrical device of the circuit-breaker type, traditionally made up of an inductor<br>
 coil associated with a magnetic yoke and a mobile magnet core in translation<br>
against a spring, said core pulling with it a striker intended to trigger a<br>
mechanical lock controlling the position of the mobile contact in relation to the<br>
fixed contact.<br>
The function of the magnetic subassemblies or triggering devices is to<br>
 separate the respective mobile and fixed contacts in case of short circuit in the<br>
circuit in which they are connected. The brutal excess current running through<br>
the coil saturates the magnetic circuit, causing the movement of the mobile<br>
core, which fills the air gap separating it from the rest of the magnetic yoke.<br>
A return spring is interposed between an element fixed in relation to the<br>
 housing of the device and the mobile core, so that this mobile core returns to its<br>
resting position (reestablishing the air gap) when the circuit is cut. The rigidity of<br>
the spring is chosen according to the category to which the circuit-breaker<br>
belongs, shown in particular by the existence of "sensitivity" curves B, C and D<br>
which define the interval, expressed according to the nominal intensity of the<br>
 circuit-breaker, in which this must trigger. This rigidity obviously also depends on<br>
the capacity of the circuit-breaker. For a high-capacity circuit-breaker, for<br>
example 125 amperes, and which depends on curve D according to which there<br>
must not be a magnetic trigger, for example, for a current value below 10 ln =<br>
1250 amperes according to the IEC 60-898 standard, the spring chosen is<br>
 obviously equipped with a rigidity enabling it to oppose the magnetic force<br>
generated by the currents of this strength in the coil. The problem is that this<br>
type of spring, which necessarily has a correlatively high rigidity, obviously<br>
presents a response time as much greater as said rigidity is significant.<br>
This is the case in particular in traditional magnetic subassembly<br>
 configurations with a solenoidal coil surrounding the mobile core, in which the<br>
 springs used are coil compression springs, for which the energy to overcome<br>
increases during movement of the mobile core.<br><br>
In order to avoid welding of contacts and to limit the short-circuit currents<br>
as much as possible, the magnetic subassemblies must necessarily close their<br>
gap as quickly as possible. It must be noted that the increase in response time<br>
which results from the rigidity and the nature of the springs used, in particular for<br>
strong-capacity circuit-breakers and the sensitivity of which corresponds to<br>
curve D, does not go in this direction.<br>
The objective of the present invention is consequently to propose a<br>
configuration such that the resistive energy opposed by the spring decreases<br>
during movement of the mobile assembly made up of the core and its striker<br>
during a short circuit.<br>
To this end, principally, the magnet subassembly of the invention is<br>
characterized in that said spring is a torsion spring with a coiled central portion<br>
and two terminal arms being spread out in a V-shape pushing against stops, the<br>
spring and said stops being driven by a relative movement such that the<br>
distance between the stops and the central portion of the spring in the direction<br>
of translation increases during closing of the gap located between the core and<br>
the yoke.<br>
The angle formed by the extremity arms in relation to the axis of<br>
movement is modified during the movement. The result of the forces exercised<br>
on the spring at the level of the stops consequently changes in angle, as we will<br>
see in more detail below, and the projection of these results on the axis of<br>
movement decreases in intensity as the central portion of the spring and said<br>
stops move away from one another.<br>
From then on, the energy necessary to hinder the resistive force of the<br>
spring decreases as the core/striker assembly approaches the mechanical<br>
triggering lock.<br>
Preferably, the torsion, spring is symmetrical in relation to the axis of<br>
movement of the mobile assembly.<br>
Such a symmetry can be explained by the translational movement<br>
according to this axis, optimal operation of which is favored by a configurational<br>
balance in relation to said axis.<br><br>
In the invention, the mobile assembly moves by sliding and is guided in at<br>
least one slide channel fixed in relation to the housing.<br>
The spring acts on the mobile assembly which may disturb the direction<br>
of movement, and consequently the path of the striker, if guiding was solely the<br>
result of the effect of magnetic forces on the core's movement.<br>
More precisely, the mobile assembly is made up of an overlaid magnetic<br>
plate and striker.<br>
These two elements exercise distinct functions, the magnetic plate or<br>
core necessarily being made of a magnetic material which is not necessarily the best adapted for the striker, for economical or mechanical reasons depending<br>
on the tasks entrusted to it.<br>
According to the invention, the sliding of the magnetic plate/striker mobile<br>
assembly is done by guiding said assembly in the slide channels symmetrically<br>
arranged in the side cheeks located in the housing, fixed, on either side of the magnetic subassembly.<br>
The guiding function is therefore performed in this case by pieces<br>
forming said cheeks, which may be made of a synthetic material, molded, for<br>
example, to which it is easy and inexpensive to give a complex shape for the<br>
performance of various functions.<br>
	As will be shown in more detail below, said cheeks also have in particular<br>
the function of housing the magnetic subassembly.<br>
More precisely, each slide channel may be made up of a wall parallel to<br>
the axis of movement of said mobile assembly, on either side of which<br>
respectively cheeks slide, these cheeks laterally exceeding the striker and one face of the magnetic plate facing said cheeks.<br>
The two components of the mobile assembly therefore participate in the<br>
translational guiding.<br>
The magnetic subassembly of the invention, beyond such a coil,<br>
preferably comprises a trapezoidal magnetic plate cooperating with an air gap in<br>
 the yoke, also trapezoidally shaped.<br>
	According to one possible configuration, the spring stops are made up of<br>
cheeks each having a C-shaped housing section at one part of an extremity arm<br><br>
of the spring, said C-shaped section being stretched perpendicularly in relation<br>
to the direction of movement of the mobile assembly.<br>
These stops make it possible to position the spring while exercising<br>
prestressing.<br>
In a first version of the invention, the coiled portion of the spring is pulled<br>
by the mobile assembly, and the spring stops are fixed in relation to the housing<br>
of the device.<br>
In this case, preferably, the central portion of the spring is wound around<br>
the head of a hub making up a protrusion of the striker crossing and exceeding<br>
an opening located in the magnetic plate, a portion of said striker equipped with<br>
an impact surface situated perpendicularly to the movement and standing up in<br>
front of the frontal edge of said plate.<br>
In this hypothesis, the mechanical relationships, both with the spring and<br>
with the mechanical lock performing the triggering, are taken care of by the<br>
striker. The sole function of the magnetic plate is to pull said striker when said<br>
plate is subjected to Laplace forces sufficient to successfully oppose the<br>
resistive force of the spring.<br>
Alternatively, the spring may be fixed to the housing of the device, and<br>
the spring stops are attached to the mobile assembly.<br>
The configuration of the magnetic subassembly of the invention is based<br>
on that which is in particular explained in detail in patent application EP-0 23 601<br>
76.8 of the applicant, the content of which is incorporated by reference in the<br>
present description.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail, with reference to the<br>
figures presented in the accompanying drawings, for which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the configuration of the invention,<br>
with a diagram of the forces present at the level of the stops ;<br>
-	figure 2 shows a perspective view of the mobile assembly with a<br>
torsion spring;<br>
-	figure 3 shows the whole of the preceding figure with the rest of the<br>
magnetic yoke;<br><br>
- figure 4 is a top view of the striker cooperating with a torsion spring ;<br><br>
-	figure 5 shows the cooperation of the mobile assembly with a lateral<br>
cheek attached to the housing of the electrical device ;<br>
-	figure 6 is a top view of the configuration appearing in the preceding<br>
figure, with the two side cheeks and without the magnetic plate;<br>
	- figure 7 is a bottom view ;<br>
-	figure 8 shows the piece on which one prefits the spring; and<br>
-	figure 9 shows said prefitting piece fixed to the side cheeks.<br>
The appended figures 2 to 9 show a version of the invention in which the<br>
torsion spring forms one piece with the mobile equipment.<br>
	In reference to figures 1 and 2, the torsion spring (1) comprises a central<br>
coiled portion (2) and extremity arms spread out in a V-shape (3) and (3'). This<br>
spring (1) is pulled by the hub (4) of a mobile assembly comprising on one hand<br>
the striker (5) and on the other hand the core / magnetic plate (6). The<br>
resistance opposed by the spring (1) to the movement of the mobile assembly,<br>
5and in particular of the hub (4) on the axis x may be calculated as follows:<br>
The spring (1) exercises a force  on the stop (7). The force seen by<br>
the stop is in accordance with the diagram. is in fact the reaction of the<br>
stop (7) on the arm (3) of the spring (1), taking friction into account. It is<br>
therefore separated from an angle cp of the reaction of the stop (7) on the arm (3) of the spring (1), in the absence of friction.<br>
From which:<br><br><br>
However, the resistant torque opposed by the spring is expressed by the<br>
relationship:<br><br>
C = kα<br>
a being the angular variation of the angle existing between the direction<br>
of movement x and the line joining the stop (7) to the center of the hub (4) and k, the rigidity of the spring (1). The value of the torque may also be written:<br><br>
By replacing  with its value with the help of , one obtains:<br><br><br>
From which:  <br>
The component of this resistive force on the axis of movements x is then equal to:<br><br>
This formula relates to only one stop (7). Given the symmetry with the<br>
stop (7'), the total resistive force exercised by the spring (1) is in reality:<br><br><br>
	When a movement begins, the angular movement a increases and the<br>
part of this formula due to the spring torque, namely ka / R, increases as well.<br>
The coefficient 1/cos0 also increases slightly, because the cos 9 decreases a<br>
little. The coefficient Fr is stable, since friction is considered constant. On the<br>
other hand, the variable sin T, which constitutes the projection on the axis <br>
 decreases.<br>
There is a geometric configuration such that the increases due to a and 8<br>
do not compensate for the decrease resulting from sin T. In this configuration,<br>
the resistive energy seen by the plate is minimized in relation to a traditional<br>
system.<br>
	In reference to figure 3, the mobile plate (6) associated with the striker (5)<br>
and the spring (1) is shown in the broadened context of its association with the<br>
magnetic yoke, said yoke being made up of two symmetrical parts (8, 8'). This<br>
yoke comprises a first air gap (9) in which the plate (6) moves, and a second air<br>
gap (10) intended to receive the mobile contact (not shown).<br>
	Figure 4 shows, in more detail, the striker (5) which is present in the form<br>
of a sliding carriage equipped with a central hub (4), cheeks (11, 11') intended<br>
to slide in sliding channels (see below), said chariot having, in front in the<br>
direction of movement in case of short circuit, a projection equipped with a flat<br>
frontal impact surface (12).<br>
	Figure 5 shows the mobile equipment made up of the plate (6), the striker<br>
(5) and the spring (1) placed in position, meaning situated in relation to other<br>
elements either of the magnetic subassembly, or intended for its immobilization<br>
in the housing. Thus, said mobile equipment is above the coil (13) of said<br>
magnetic subassembly, which in fact forms three-quarters of the loop made by a<br>
 magnetic plate folded around a core (14) traditionally made up of stacked<br>
 plates. The coil (13) / core (14) assembly is inserted in a side cheek (15) which<br><br>
participates in the positioning of a certain number of elements of the circuit-<br>
breaker. In principle, the coil (13) and the core (14) are masked by one of the<br>
parts (8') of the yoke, which is not shown here. There is also a second cheek<br>
symmetrical to the first, which makes it possible to complete the lodging of the<br>
 magnetic subassembly and which is also not shown in figure 5 so as not to<br>
hinder the readability of the figure.<br>
This second cheek (15') is, however, shown in figure 6, in which the<br>
quasi-entirety of the magnetic subassembly, with the exception of the spring (1)<br>
and the upper parts of the mobile equipment, namely the hub (4) and the<br>
 forward projection with its impact surface (12), is masked. In fact, when the two<br>
legs (15) and (15') are assembled, their upper part makes up a window (16)<br>
enabling the movement of the mobile equipment, and contributing at least<br>
partially to its guiding in the direction of the arrow (F).<br>
This guiding is done, as appears in figures 5 to 7, by flat parallel walls<br>
 (17, 17') located under the upper part of the legs (15, 15') with which the lateral<br>
cheeks (11, 11') of the mobile striker (5) may cooperate during sliding. One wall<br>
of the magnetic plate (6) facing said cheeks (11, 11') slides on the other side of<br>
each wall (17, 17'), which may moreover be equipped with positioning guides<br>
(19,19').<br>
 	The spring (1), the ends (3, 3') of which appear, is topped by a sort of<br>
cover or hood (18) which is mounted on the upper parts of the legs (15, 15').<br>
This cover (18), which enables pre-assembly of the spring (1), appears in figure<br>
8. It contains the stops (7, T) which determine in particular the prestressing of<br>
the torsion spring (1), and thereby make it possible to adapt it to the capacity<br>
 and sensitivity of the circuit-breaker. The stops (7, 7') contain a C-shaped<br>
lodging for the ends (3, 3') of the spring (1).<br>
When the cover or cap (18) is mounted, by embedment, on the two legs<br>
(15, 15'), as appears in figure 9, the upper part of the mobile assembly is not<br>
completely covered in order to preserve the function of the flat impact wall (12)<br>
 of the striker (5). This wall must indeed be able to come into contact with the<br>
 magnetic triggering lock, of which at least one portion is inserted between the<br>
two legs (15, 15') so that contact may be realized.<br><br>
