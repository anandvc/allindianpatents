				<td>The present invention relates to a composition useful for making in-situ Silicon Carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composite and a process for making in-situ Silicon Carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composite. The process of the present invention particularly relates to the use of wide variety of natural fibres such as jute, sunhemp, sisal or any other natural fibres having cellulosic or hemicellulosic constituents at its backbone as raw materials for providing useful carbon for the formation of silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in the matrix of Silicon Carbide-carbon. The main usage of the silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composites is in the field of engineering materials in any shape as may be deemed fit.<br>
The present day method of making Silicon Carbide particulate, whiskers and fibres reinforced composite in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composites essentially consists of seeding graphite substrate with metal droplets such as Fe, Co, Cr and Mn as catalyst for the whisker formation. Methane and silicon monoxide supply C and Si respectively - the references for which may be made to "Synthesis and Characterisation of VLS - Derived SiC whiskers" of P.D. Shalek in Conf. Whisker and fibre Toughened Ceramics, Oak Ridge T N (1988) and to "Review of VLS SiC Whisker Growth Technology" by W.E.Holler and JJ.Kim in Ceram. Engg. Sci. Proc., vol. 12, pp 979-991 (1991) or making fibre by melt extrusion and suspension spinning of compositions of ultrafine SiC powders and organic additives such as polyvinyl butyral respectively followed by sintering or making fibre by melt spinning polymers which can be rapidly cured in the solid<br><br>
state and polymerised to ceramic fibres with compositions which are stoichiometric silicon carbide or which are carbon-rich or silicon-rich silicon carbide -the reference for which may be made to "Silicon Carbide: from Acheson's Invention to New Industrial Products" by W. D. G. Boecker in cfi/Ber. DKG 74 (5), 1997. The fibres and whiskers produced by the above processes are mixed mechanically with the matrix materials and are fabricated into different sizes and shapes followed by heat treatment at different temperatures for consolidations - the references for which may be made to "Pressureless Sintering of Al2O3/SiC Materials: Effect of the Reducing Atmosphere" by G. Urretavizcaya, J.M.Porto Lopez &amp; A.L. Cavalieri, J. Eu. Ceram. Soc., 17 1555-63(1997). In a process inorganic polymers that are ceramic precursors are spun into fibres by melt-spinning or solvent-assisted dry spinning, stabilising the fibres to prevent remelting followed by thermally decomposing into fibres - the references for which may be made to German P.2,6181 JO; French P.2,308,590; Japanese P.51 130325, 51 139929, 51 147623 (1976). In slurry spinning a dispersion of crystalline ceramic particulate in a carrier fluid is formed into a fibre, converted to fibre by thermal conversion by several heating stages that may include passing the fibre through a flame. The process generate particulate of not more than 1 ^m to control shrinkage - the references for which may be made to E.I. du Pont de Nemovrs &amp; Co.; B.P. 1,264,973(1972); USP 3,808,015(1974); USP 4,753,904 (1988); Mitsui Mining Co. Ltd.; Japanese P 217182 (1986)p; European P. 0,260,868-A2 (1988); USP 4,812,271 (1989). The overall process has several drawbacks that may be listed below:<br>
1.	Number of steps involved in the overall process is higher.<br>
2.	Handling of whiskers and short fibres require special arrangements.<br><br>
3.	It is difficult to disperse whiskers and short fibres uniformly in the matrix.<br>
4.	Silicon Carbide whiskers particularly of aspect ratio less than 10 cause health<br>
hazard.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition useful for making in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide - carbon matrix composites.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composites which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. Yet another object of the present invention is to utilize natural fibres of plant source. Still another object of the present invention is to reduce the total number of unit processes in the overall operation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to form whiskers and fibres in-situ<br>
during processing to eliminate totally the possibility of health hazard.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a synergistic   composition useful for<br>
making in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon<br>
Carbide-carbon matrix composite which comprises:<br>
Natural fibre	1.6 - 6.4 wt%<br>

There is no chemical reaction in the mixture as such  and the composition of the<br>

properties which are different and distinct from the mere aggregation of the<br>
properties of the individual ingredients.<br>

carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide-carbon<br>
matrix composites whch comprises dissolving 38 - 46 wt % of phenolic resin in<br>

plate/sheet, drying the said composite plate/sheet at a temperature in the range of<br>
70°- 90° C for a period in the range of 1-2 hrs., heat treating the dried composite<br>
plate/sheet at a temperature in the range of 150° -200°C for a period in the range of<br><br>
1 - 2.5 hrs., impregnating the resultant composite plate/sheet with 28.6-46.8 wt %<br>
of tetraethyl orthosilicate in vacuum, subjecting the impregnated  composite<br>
plate/sheet to heat treatment in argon initially at a heating rate in the range of 2° -<br>
5°C per minute upto a temperature in the range of 200° - 400°C   followed by<br>
further heating at the rate of 10°- 15°C per minute upto a temperature in the range<br>
of 1400° - 1850°C, maintaining the final temperature for a period in the range of<br>
0.5-2 hrs.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the natural fibres may be introduced in<br>
the body in desired alignments such as unidirectional, multidirectional,  woven,<br>
randomly  oriented structure.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the matrix materials may be of<br>
different particle dimension from nano to micron size.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention drying of the natural fibre<br>
may be effected at a temperature in the range of 60°-70°C for a period in the range<br>
of 1 - 5 hrs.<br>
In   still   another   embodiment   of  the   present   invention   impregnation   with<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate may be carried out in vacuum and repeating if required.<br>

absence of air may be done in an inert atmosphere or in vacuum.<br>
The details of the present invention are given below:<br>
a)	38 - 46 wt % of phenolic resin is dissolved in organic solvent.<br>
b)	4.2 - 6.6 wt % of curing agent and 9.4 - 12.4 wt % of Silicon carbide are mixed<br>
with the solution prepared in step (a).<br>
c)	Natural fibre is dried at 60° - 70°C for 1 - 5 hrs.<br><br>

g)	The dried composite plate/sheet is impregnated with 28.6 - 46.8 wt % of<br>
tetraethyl orthosilicate in vacuum.<br>
h) The impregnated plate/sheet is initially heat treated in argon at the rate of 2° -5°C/min. upto 200°-400°C followed by further heating at the rate of 10° - 15°C per min. upto 1400°-1850°C maintaining the final temperature for 0.5-2 hrs. The process of the present invention can be used to produce in-situ silicon carbide in the form of particulate, whiskers and fibres in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix composite of various shapes and sizes required for application as engineering components. Natural fibres of plant origin contain all the ingredients of forming silicon carbide if sufficient amount of silicon is provided. Organo silicon compound such as tetraethyl orthosilicate gives active silica on pyrolysis. This active silica in turn reacts with carbon-formed from cellulosic materials like fibres of plant origin. Silicon carbide thus formed are in molecular dimension and with proper catalyst and seeding crystals, unidirectional grain growth occurs to form long fibres of small diameters or whiskers of different aspect ratios. Isolated silicon carbide grains may grow in the three dimensions resulting into particulate formation. If these complex set of network structure is allowed to grow in Silicon Carbide-carbon matrix - the resulting microstructure consists of randomly orientated fibres and whiskers in a homogeneous matrix leading to enhanced fracture toughness imparting some machinability in otherwise non-machinable material.<br><br>
