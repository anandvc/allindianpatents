Description<br>
The present invention relates to aqueous active compound concentrates having<br>
herbicidal action comprising, in dissolved form:<br>
a) at least one 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compound of the formula I<br><br>
in which<br>
R1, R3 independently of one another are hydrogen, halogen, methyl,<br>
halomethyl, methoxy, halomethoxy, methylthio, methylsulfinyl or<br>
methylsulfonyl;<br>
R2	is a 5-membered heterocyclic radical which is unsubstituted or carries 1,<br>
2, 3 or 4 substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen,<br>
C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy and<br>
C1-C4-alkylthio;<br>
R4	is hydrogen, halogen or methyl;<br>
R5	is C1-C6-alkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl or C3-C6-cycloalkylmethyl; and<br>
R6	is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
or one of its agriculturally useful salts; and<br>
b) at least one benzoic acid derivative of the formula II<br><br>
in which<br>
R7	is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl or methoxy and<br>
R8	is hydrogen, halogen or amino;<br>
or one of its agriculturally useful salts; and<br><br>
Pure crops of agriculturally interesting useful plants are required for efficient and<br>
profitable practice of industrialized agriculture and for ensuring a consistent product<br>
quality. The selective sensitivity of different plant groups with respect to certain<br>
metabolic inhibitors or other cell toxins may be utilized for the targeted control of<br>
unwanted foreign vegetation (growth of harmful plants) on the areas under agricultural<br>
cultivation. Here, it is desirable in principle to enhance both the absolute efficacy and<br>
the specificity of the active compounds used (herbicides) against harmful plants.<br>
The specificity and, within certain limits, the absolute efficacy can be enhanced by<br>
using combinations of a plurality of specific active compounds which attack at different<br>
points of the metabolism of the target plants. If the activity of the combination exceeds<br>
the sum of the individual activities significantly, this is referred to as synergism<br>
(occasionally also as superadditive effects).<br>
The absolute efficacy of crop protection agents can be increased by various types of<br>
accompanying substances and auxiliaries which may enhance the desired activity in<br>
various ways. Further additives may be used to simplify handling, to increase storability<br>
and to improve other product properties.<br>
An important role in the formulation of herbicidally active compounds is played by<br>
"adjuvants". These are to be understood as auxiliaries which increase the activity of an<br>
active compound and/or its selectivity for the harmful plant, but which per se have<br>
minute, if any, activity against the harmful plant to be controlled. In many cases, the<br>
activity of adjuvants for herbicides is based on their surface activity which improves<br>
contact of the application form of the active compound, in general an aqueous active<br>
compounC1-Containing spray liquor, with the surface of the plant and, by reducing<br>
surface tension, improves penetration of the application form and thus the active<br>
compound into the soil. Whether a particular surfactant acts as adjuvant, i.e. whether it<br>
achieves enhanced activity or selectivity, frequently depends on the nature of the active<br>
compound.<br>
In general, adjuvants are added only immediately prior to the application of the active<br>
compound of the application form, for example the spray liquor. However, in principle,<br>
they may also be a constituent of an active compound formulation, and this is preferred<br>
for reasons of handling and application safety. However, many active compounds are<br>
incompatible with the customary surfactants, in particular on prolonged storage. Here,<br>
incompatibility means any chemical or physicochemical reduction of activity or<br>
reduction of practical applicability, which may be the result either of direct chemical<br>
reaction of active compounds and auxiliaries or of a reduced availability of the active<br><br>
compounds in the mixture, for example by formation of precipitates which are poorly<br>
soluble under application conditions or by demixing of the formulation. There may also<br>
be incompatibility with the other constituents of the formulation. Accordingly, it is<br>
regularly necessary to match adjuvants and the active compound to be formulated, and<br>
also the other constituents of the formulation.<br>
WO 99/63823 discloses to improve the activity of 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole<br>
compounds by adding relatively large amounts of nitrogenous fertilizers and adjuvants.<br>
Thus, on application, large amounts of fertilizer are applied, which may have a negative<br>
effect on selectivity.<br>
WO 00/53014 discloses to increase the activity of herbicidal 4-benzoyl-substituted<br>
pyrazole compounds by using an adjuvant which comprises a mixture of a fatty acid, a<br>
phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid semiester of a monohydroxy functional polyalkyl ether<br>
and a C1-C5-alkyl C10-C20-alkanoate. When this adjuvant is incorporated into aqueous<br>
concentrate formulations of the 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compounds, there may<br>
be homogeneity problems. Also, the active compound may precipitate in the spray<br>
liquor obtained on dilution. For this reason, such adjuvants are added only shortly prior<br>
to application of the aqueous spray liquor (tank mix method).<br>
WO 99/65314 describes inter alia synergistically active herbicide mixtures comprising a<br>
herbicidally active 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compound, for example one of the<br>
compounds I defined at the outset, and a synergist, for example a herbicide from the<br>
group of the benzoic acid compounds, for example one of the compounds of the<br>
formula II defined at the outset. However, the herbicidally active benzoic acid<br>
compounds frequently also damage useful plants. The incorporation of adjuvants into<br>
water-soluble concentrate formulations of active compound mixtures comprising<br>
4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compounds of the formula I and benzoic acid<br>
compounds of the formula II is frequently associated with problems. In particular if<br>
relatively large amounts of adjuvants and/or higher concentrations of benzoic acid<br>
compound are used, there are frequently inhomogeneities or solids separating out.<br>
Accordingly, it was an object of the present invention to provide an aqueous<br>
homogeneous formulation comprising at least one compound of the formula I together<br>
with at least one compound of the formula II and a relatively large amount of an<br>
adjuvant, which formulation is storage-stable. In addition, the formulation was to be<br>
dilutable with water without any problems.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that these and other objects are achieved by using<br>
the nonionic surfactants S described below.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides aqueous active compound concentrates<br>
comprising, in dissolved form:<br>
a)	at least one 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compound of the formula I, as defined<br>
at the outset;<br>
b)	at least one benzoic acid compound of the formula II, as defined at the outset;<br>
and<br>
c)	at least one nonionic surfactant S, selected from polyether compounds having<br>
repeat units derived from ethylene oxide, alkylpolyglycosides and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The active compound concentrates according to the invention are homogeneous<br>
aqueous solutions of the active compounds of the formulae I and II. The concentrates<br>
are storage-stable and, even after prolonged storage, show no tendency for solids to<br>
separate off, even when large amounts of surfactant S are present. The active<br>
compound concentrates are easy to handle and can be diluted with water without<br>
active compounds separating off. Moreover, it has been found that, by using these<br>
nonionic surfactants S, it is possible not only to increase the herbicidal activity of the<br>
active compound mixture to exceed the already known synergy of the active<br>
compounds I and II, but also to reduce the damaging effect of the active compounds of<br>
the formula II on the agriculturally useful plants.<br>

According to a first embodiment, substance S comprises a polyether compound having<br>
repeat units derived from ethylene oxide, i.e. repeat units of the formula CH2CH2O,<br>
and, if appropriate, further repeat units derived from C3-C8-alkylene oxides and/or<br>
styrene oxide, or a mixture thereof with alkylpolyglycosides. In this embodiment, the<br>
poiyether compound accounts in particular for at least 80% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably at least 90% by weight or the total amount of substance S.<br>
Such polyether compounds typically have at least one, for example, 1, 2, 3 or 4,<br>
polyether groups which, in addition to the repeat units derived from ethylene oxide,<br>
may optionally have further repeat units which are generally derived from<br>
C3-C8-alkylene oxides and/or styrene oxide. Hereinbelow, the polyether groups are also<br>
referred to as macrogol moiety. In the polyether compounds, the polyether groups are<br><br>
generally covalently attached to an organic radical (basic moiety) or attached via an<br>
ether oxygen atom to a macromolecule.<br>
The covalent attachment of the macrogol moiety (moieties) to the basic moiety is<br>
generally via an oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atom, preferably via an oxygen atom. The<br>
basic moiety is typically an organic radical having generally 4 to 40, frequently 6 to 30<br>
and in particular 10 to 22 carbon atoms, where the basic moiety may optionally also<br>
have one or more functional groups, for example 1 or 2 carbonyloxy groups (C(=0)-O-<br>
groups) and/or 1, 2, 3 or 4 OH groups and/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 nitrogen atoms.<br>
Examples of radicals suitable as basic moiety are C8-C30-alkyl, C8-C30-alkenyl,<br>
C4-C30-a!kanediyl, C8-C30-alkantriyl, C5-C10-cycloalkyI, C5-C10-cycloalkanediyl,<br>
α,α'-[bisphenyl-C1-C4-alkane]diyl, α,α'-[biscyclohexyl-C1-C4-alkane]diyl, mono- and<br>
di-C4-C20-alkylphenyl, in particular butylphenyl, 4-tert-butylphenyl, hexylphenyl,<br>
octylphenyl, nonylphenyl, dodecylphenyl, tridecylphenyl, C8-C20-alkylcarbonyl, benzoyl,<br>
C1-C20-alkylbenzoyl, naphthyl which may optionally have 1, 2 or 3 C1-C10-alkyl groups,<br>
mono-, di- and tristyrylphenyl, furthermore radicals derived from sorbitan esters, from<br>
alkylpolyglycosides, from mono- or diglycerides and also from (oligo)alkyleneimines.<br>
Alkyl(poly)glycosides or alkylpolyglucosides are to be understood as meaning<br>
compounds having one or more, in particular one, alkyl radical, in particular a<br>
C6-C22-alkyl radical, which is attached via an oxygen atom to a mono- or<br>
oligosaccharide radical, for example to a mono-, di- or trisaccharide radical. Here, the<br>
saccharide units are typically derived from glucose. Preferred alkyl(poly)glycosides are<br>
those having on average 1 to 2 glucose units. In general, these are mixtures. In<br>
polyether compounds having a basic moiety derived from alkyl(poly)glycosides, the at<br>
least one macrogol moiety replaces at least one of the non-esterified hydroxyl groups<br>
of the mono- or oligosaccharide radical.<br>
Sorbitan esters are to be understood as meaning esters, in particular mono- or<br>
diesters, of sorbitol with saturated or unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, in particular<br>
saturated or unsaturated fatty acids having 8 to 22 carbon atoms. In polyether<br>
compounds having a basic moiety derived from sorbitol esters, the at least one<br>
macrogol moiety replaces at least one of the non-esterified hydroxyl groups of the<br>
sorbitan.<br>
Mono- and diglycerides are to be understood as meaning mono- or diesters of glycerol<br>
or mixtures thereof with saturated or unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids, in particular<br>
saturated or unsaturated fatty acids having 8 to 22 carbon atoms. In polyether<br>
compounds having a basic moiety derived from mono- or diglycerides, the at least one<br><br>
macrogol moiety replaces at least one of the non-esterified hydroxy! groups of the<br>
glycerol.<br>
Radicals derived from (oligo)alkyleneimines are to be understood as meaning radicals<br>
derived from alkylenediamines or oligomeric iminoalkyleneamines, such as mono-, di-,<br>
tri- and tetraethyleneimine or mono-, bis-, tris- or tetrakis-(3-aminopropyl)ethylene-<br>
diamine. In polyether compounds having a basic moiety derived from (oligo)alkylene-<br>
imines, the at least one macrogol moiety replaces at least one NH hydrogen atom of<br>
the (oligo)alkyleneimine.<br>
The percentage of the EO repeat units of the total weight of the polyether compounds<br>
is typically in the range of from 10 to 90% by weight and in particular in the range of<br>
. from 30 to 85% by weight.<br>
In general, the polyether compounds have an HLB according to Griffin of from 1.5 to<br>
19.5, preferably from 1.5 to 14.0, particularly preferably from 2 to 10, very particularly<br>
preferably from 3 to 7. Here, the numbers mentioned always refer to a mean value.<br>
Here, "HLB according to Griffin" means the ratio of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic<br>
moieties of the molecule, expressed as the proportion of the ethylene oxide moiety with<br>
respect to the molecular weight of the entire molecule, multiplied by twenty.<br>
Polyether compounds whose polyether groups also contain, in addition to the repeat<br>
units derived from ethylene oxide, other repeat units, i.e. repeat units derived from<br>
C3-C5-alkylene oxides and/or styrene oxide, generally have a modified HLB in the<br>
range of from 5 to 19.5, preferably from 5 to 16.0, particularly preferably from 7 to 14,<br>
very particularly preferably from 10 to 14; here, the numbers mentioned always refer to<br>
a mean value. Here, "modified HLB" means the ratio of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic<br>
moieties of the molecule, to take into account the different hydrophilicity of ethylene<br>
oxide units and other repeat units in the polyether chain, expressed as the proportion of<br>
the ethylene oxide moiety with respect to the molecular weight of the entire molecule,<br>
multiplied by twenty, plus the proportion of the other repeat units with respect to the<br>
molecular weight of the entire molecule, multiplied by ten.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyether compounds may vary over wide ranges and is<br>
typically in the range of from 200 to 10 000 Dalton and in particular in the range of from<br>
300 to 5000 Dalton (in each case number average), unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Preferably, the quotient of mass average and number average of the molecular weight<br>
is in the range of from 0.9 to 1.6, preferably in the range of from 1.0 to 1.4 and<br>
particularly preferably in the range of from 1.1 to 1.3.<br><br>
The polyether groups in the polyether compounds S can generally be described by the<br>
general formula III<br>
Rx-(EO)x (AO)y]- (III)<br>
in which<br>
EO is -CH2-CH2-O-;<br>
AO is -CHRa-CRbRc-O-, with any arrangement of EO units and AO units within the<br>
chain being possible, including a random arrangement or a block arrangement;<br>
Rx is hydrogen, C1-C10-alkyl, C5-C10-cycloalkyl, benzyl or C1-C20-alkylcarbonyl and is<br>
attached via the oxygen atom of an EO group or an AO group;<br>
x is an integer whose number average is in the range of from 1 to 150, in particular<br>
from 2 to 8.0.and particularly preferably from 3 to 40;<br>
y is an integer whose number average is in the range of from 0 to 150, in particular<br>
from 0 to 50 and especially from 0 to 30, where the number average of the sum<br>
of x and y is generally in the range of from 2 to 150, in particular in the range of<br>
from 3 to 80 and particularly preferably in the range of from 5 to 40;<br>
Ra, Rb independently of one another are hydrogen or methyl and in particular hydrogen;<br>
and<br>
Rc is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, especially methyl or phenyl,<br>
where at least one of the radicals Ra, Rb and Rc is different from hydrogen.<br>
In formula III, AO and EO are repeat units (monomer units) from which the polyether<br>
group is constructed. If the polyether groups of formula III comprise repeat units AO,<br>
the repeat units EO and AO may be in any arrangement, for example in a block<br>
arrangement where relatively long sequences of EO units are linked to relatively long<br>
sequences of AO units, or in a random arrangement, or in mixed forms of random<br>
arrangement and block arrangement. If the polyether groups III have a block<br>
arrangement of AO blocks and EO blocks, it is preferred for the polyether group to<br>
consist of 2 or 3 and in particular 2 blocks. Here, the indices x and y indicate the<br>
number of the respective repeat units within the polyether group. Since the polyether<br>
compounds are generally not molecularly uniform compounds but mixtures of<br>
compounds having various polyether chains which typically differ in the number of the<br>
respective repeat units, x and y are typically mean values (number average), in each<br>
case based on the total amount of repeat units EO and AO, respectively, in the<br>
polyether compound.<br>
Groups AO which may be mentioned are, for example, radicals derived from propylene<br>
oxide (PO; Ra = Rb = hydrogen and Rc = methyl), butylene oxide (BO; Ra = Rb =<br><br>
hydrogen and Rc = ethyl), isobutylene oxide (IBO; Ra = hydrogen and Rb = Rc =<br>
methyl), pentylene oxide (PPO; Ra = Rb = hydrogen and Rc = propyl), hexylene oxide<br>
(HO; Ra = Rb = hydrogen and Rc = butyl) and styrene oxide (StO; Ra = Rb = hydrogen<br>
and Rc = phenyl). If the polyether group has radicals AO, these are preferably derived<br>
from propylene oxide.<br>
From among the polyether compounds, preference is given to those having one or<br>
more groups of the formula III in which Rx is hydrogen or C1-C10-alkyl, in particular<br>
hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, especially methyl. In a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the polyether groups are terminally modified, i.e. Rx is a radical different from hydrogen.<br>
In this case, Rx is preferably C1-C10-alkyl, in particular C1-C4-alkyl and especially<br>
methyl. Suitable as substance S are in particular also polyether compounds in which Rx<br>
is C1-C20-alkylcarbonyl. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the polyether<br>
compounds are not terminally modified, i.e. Rx is hydrogen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polyether compound is selected from ethylene<br>
oxide/propylene oxide copolymers (hereinbelow referred to as EO/PO copolymers).<br>
These are to be understood as meaning polyether compounds predominantly, i.e. to at<br>
least 90% by weight, constructed of repeat units EO and PO (= CH2-CH(CH3)-0).<br>
Formally, these are compounds in which two polyether groups of the formula III in<br>
which y * 0 and AO is CH2-CH(CH3)0 are attached to one another via an ether oxygen<br>
atom or via a C4-C10-alkanediyl group. From among these, preference is given to<br>
ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers in which the number of the PO blocks<br>
and the EO blocks is preferably 2 or in particular 3. Especially preferred are triblock<br>
copolymers of the formulae below<br><br>
Here, the unit [POy1]A[POy2] is seen as a PO block. In the formulae, Rx, EO, PO, x and<br>
y have the meanings mentioned above, and Rx has one of the meanings given for Rx.<br>
Independently of one another, the indices x1 and x2 have one of the values given for x.<br>
The indices y1 and y2 are different from 0 and, besides, independently of one another<br>
have one of the values given for y. The index y3 typically denotes a value of from 2 to<br>
160, in particular a value of from 4 to 100 and especially from 10 to 80. The index x3<br>
typically denotes a value of from 4 to 200, in particular a value of from 10 to 100 and<br><br>
especially of from 10 to 80. A is C4-C10-alkanediyl or C5-C10-cycloalkanediyl. Y is<br>
oxygen or a radical NR in which R is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl or a group of the formula III.<br>
Rx and Rx are in particular hydrogen or C1-C10-alkyl. The number average molecular<br>
weight of the EO/PO copolymers is preferably in the range of from 300 to 10 000, in<br>
particular in the range of from 500 to 5000, Dalton. The percentage of EO repeat units<br>

20 to 80% by weight, and the percentage of the PO repeat units is in the range of from<br>
10 to 90% by weight, in particular in the range of from 20 to 80% by weight, in each<br>
case based on the total weight of the EO/PO copolymer.<br>

The polyethoxylates and poly(ethoxylate-co-propoxylate)s mentioned above may be<br>
terminally capped, i.e. the radical Rx is different from hydrogen and is in particular<br>

different radicals having preferably the same or a similar number of carbons and<br><br>
different degrees of branching, as obtained in the industrial preparation of the alkanols<br>
on which the compounds IV are based.<br>
From among the polyether compounds of the formula IV, preference is given to those<br>

26, and the number average of the sum x + y is in the range of from 3 to 50, especially<br>
in the range of from 4 to 40. In particularly preferred poly(ethoxylate-co-propoxylate)s<br>

According to a further particularly preferred embodiment, the polyether compound is a<br>

particular a polyether compound of the formula IV or V. In this case, the weight ratio of<br>
alkylglycoside to polyether compound is typically in the range of from 9:1 to 1:9, in<br>
particular in the range of from 2:8 to 8:2.<br>
The abovementioned compounds S are known to the person skilled in the art and<br>

example, from BASF under the common trade name of the "Lutensols", where,<br>
depending on the basic moiety, a distinction is made between Lutensols of series A,<br>
AO, AT, ON, AP, XP, XL, TO and FA. Further added numbers indicate the degree of<br>
ethoxylation. Thus, for example, "Lutensol AO 8" is a C13-15-oxoalcohol having eight EO<br>
units. "Lutensol FA" is a group of alkoxylated amines.<br>
Further examples of polyether compounds suitable according to the invention are<br>

branched alcohols. Thus, for example "Ethylan SN 120" is a C10-12-alkohol having ten<br>
EO Units, and "Ethylan 4 S" is a C12-14-alcohol having four EO units.<br>
Further examples of polyalkoxylates suitable according to the invention are furthermore<br>
the "IMP" products from Akzo (previously Witco), which are based on nonylphenols.<br>

EO units. These include, for example, products of the "Berol" series from Akzo.<br>
Furthermore according to the invention are sorbitan ester ethoxylates, for example<br>

art.<br>
The aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention may<br>
additionally aiso comprise further substances which are not directly relevant to the aim<br>
of the composition, but which improve their applicability and/or practical properties.<br>
Examples of these are in particular<br>
-	viscosity-regulating substances (thickeners),<br>
-	preservatives,<br>
-	antifoams,<br>
-	agents for adjusting the pH,<br>

Such substances are familiar to the person skilled in the art. The total amount of such<br>
substances will generally not exceed 10% by weight, based on the active compound<br>
concentrate, and is typically in the range of from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
The viscosity-modifying additives (thickeners) include in particular compounds which<br>
are known to impart pseudoplastic flow behavior to aqueous formulations, i.e. high<br>
viscosity in the state of rest and low viscosity in the state of motion. Suitable are, in<br>
principle, all compounds used for this purpose in aqueous active compound<br>
concentrates. Mention may be made, for example, of inorganic substances, such as<br>
bentonite or attapulgite (for example Attaclay® from Engelhardt), and organic<br>
substances, such as polysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides, such as Xanthan<br><br>
Gum® (Kelzan® from Kelco), Rhodopol® 23 (Rhone Poulenc) or Veegum® (from R.T.<br>
Vanderbilt), with Xanthan-Gum® being preferred. The amount of viscosity-modifying<br>
additives is frequently from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the active<br>
compound concentrate.<br>
Suitable antifoams are, for example, silicone emulsions (Silikon® SRE, from Wacker, or<br>
Rhodorsil®, from Rhodia), long-chain alcohols, fatty acids, defoamers of the type of<br>
aqueous wax dispersions, solid defoamers ("compounds"), organofluorine compounds<br>
and mixtures thereof known to be suitable for this purpose. The amount of antifoam is<br>
typically from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the active compound<br>
concentrate.<br>
Examples of preservatives are those based on isothiazolones, for example Proxel®<br>
from ICI or Acticide® RS from Thor Chemie or Kathon® MK from Rohm &amp; Haas. The<br>
amount of preservatives, if present, is typically from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
Suitable antifreeze agents are liquid alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol,<br>
n-butanol, polyols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol. The<br>
amount of antifreeze agents, if present, is generally from 1 to 10% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
If appropriate, the active compound concentrates according to the invention may<br>
comprise agents for regulating the pH. Examples of such agents are bases, for<br>
example alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide,<br>
sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or ammonia, or else buffers, for example<br>
alkali metal salts of weak inorganic or organic acids, such as, for example phosphoric<br>
acid, boric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, furmaric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic<br>
acid and succinic acid. The amount of agents for adjusting the pH, if present, is<br>
generally from 0.01 to 3% by weight, based on the total weight of the active compound<br>
concentrate.<br>
The aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention can be<br>
prepared in a simple manner by dissolving the active compounds of the formulae I and<br>
II in water or in an aqueous medium and adding substance S and, if appropriate, the<br>
further ingredients of the active compound concentrate, if appropriate in dissolved form,<br>
to the resulting solution. Here and below, an aqueous medium is to be understood as<br>
meaning water which part of the other components optionally present of the active<br>
compound concentrate, for example bases, buffers, preservatives, etc. Dissolution of<br><br>
the active compounds of the formulae I and II may be carried out jointly or successively<br>
in one apparatus or in several apparatuses, where in the latter case the resulting<br>
aqueous solutions are combined. Frequently, for dissolving the active compounds, the<br>
active compound I is suspended in water and the pH is adjusted to pH &gt; 7, in particular<br>
pH &gt; 8, for example to pH 8 to pH 10, in particular to pH 8 to pH 9, by addition of a<br>
base or a buffer, whereupon the active compound of the formula I goes into solution.<br>
The solution obtained in this manner is then mixed with an aqueous solution of the<br>
benzoic acid compound II or with an aqueous solution of a salt of the benzoic acid<br>
compound II, for example an alkali metal salt or an ammonium salt. Alternatively, it is<br>
also possible to suspend a mixture of active compound I and benzoic acid compound II<br>
or one of the abovementioned salts of the benzoic acid compound II in water and then<br>
adjusting the pH of the suspension by addition of a base or a buffer to the range<br>
mentioned above, whereupon the active compounds of formulae I and II go into<br>
solution. The other components of the active compound concentrate are then added to<br>
the solutions obtained in this manner, which are homogenized in a customary manner,<br>
for example by stirring, ultrasound.<br>
The aqueous active compound concentrates obtained in this manner are particularly<br>
suitable for controlling a large number of unwanted plants. The active compound<br>
concentrates according to the invention are highly suitable for controlling unwanted<br>
vegetation on non-crop areas, in particular at high application rates. In cereal crops<br>
such as wheat, rye, barley, millet, oats or triticale, and also in corn, they act against<br>
broad-leaved weeds and weed grasses without causing any significant damage to the<br>
crop plants. This effect is observed especially at low application rates. The active<br>
compound concentrates according to the invention are particularly suitable for<br>
eliminating harmful plants in corn. Depending on the application method in question,<br>
the active compound concentrates according to the invention can also be employed in<br>
other crop plants for eliminating unwanted plants.<br>
In addition, the active compound concentrates can also be used in crops which tolerate<br>
the action of herbicides owing to breeding, including genetic engineering methods.<br>
The active compound concentrates are generally applied in the form of an aqueous<br>
spray liquor. To this end, the active compound concentrates according to the invention<br>
are, depending on the application rate, diluted with water to a multiple of their volume,<br>
for example 10- to 10 000-fold, in particular 20- to 1000-fold. The active compound<br>
concentration (total amount of active compound) in the spray liquor is then typically in<br>
the range of from 5 mg/l to 5 g/l, in particular from 0.01 to 1 g/l.<br><br>
Application may be by the pre-emergence method, by the post-emergence method or<br>
together with the seed of a crop plant. It is also possible to apply the active compounds<br>
of the formulae I and II present in the active compound concentrates using the active<br>
compound concentrates according to the invention by treating seed of a crop plant with<br>
the active compounds of the formulae I and II and sowing the seed treated in this<br>
manner. If the active compounds are less well tolerated by certain crop plants,<br>
application techniques may be used in which the application forms prepared using the<br>
active compound concentrates are sprayed, with the aid of the spraying equipment, in<br>
such a way that as far as possible they do not come into contact with the leaves of the<br>
sensitive crop plants, while the active compounds reach the leaves of unwanted plants<br>
growing underneath, or the bare soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
Based on the total amount of active compound I and II, .the application rates are,<br>
depending on the control target, the season, the target plants and the growth stage,<br>
from 0.001 to 3.0, preferably 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha.<br>
To widen the activity spectrum and to achieve synergistic effects, the active compound<br>
concentrates may, prior to application, be mixed with numerous representatives of<br>
other herbicidal or growth-regulating groups of active compounds and then applied<br>
jointly, for example by the tank-mix method. Suitable components for mixtures are, for<br>
example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric acid and<br>
derivatives thereof, aminotriazoles, anilides, (het)aryloxyalkanoic acid and derivatives<br>
thereof, benzoic acid and derivatives thereof, benzothiadiazinones, 2-aroyl-1,3-<br>
cyclohexanediones, 2-hetaroyl-1,3-cyclohexanediones, hetaryl aryl ketones,<br>
benzylisoxazolidinones, meta-CF3-phenyl derivatives, carbamates, quinolinecarboxylic<br>
acid and derivatives thereof, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexenone oxime ether<br>
derivatives, diazines, dichloropropionic acid and derivatives thereof,<br>
dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl<br>
ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic acids and derivatives thereof, ureas, 3-phenyluracils,<br>
imidazoles, imidazoiinones, N-phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimides, oxadiazoles,<br>
oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- or heteroaryloxyphenoxypropionic esters, phenylacetic acid<br>
and derivatives thereof, phenylpropionic acid and derivatives thereof, pyrazoles,<br>
phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridinecarboxylic acid and derivatives thereof, pyrimidyl<br>
ethers, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones,<br>
triazolecarboxamides, uracils.<br>
It may furthermore be beneficial to mix the active compound concentrates prior to<br>
application with other crop protection agents, followed by joint application, for example<br>
with agents for controlling pests or phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is<br><br>
the miscibility with mineral salt solutions, which are employed for treating nutritional<br>
and trace element deficiencies. It is also possible to add nonphytotoxic oils and oil<br>
concentrates.<br>

B Examination of the application properties<br>
After 2 weeks of storage at 54°C, the active compound concentrates according to the<br>
invention showed no visible changes.<br>
The foaming tendencies were determined according to Ross-Miles (ASTM-D 1173 53).<br>
It was low, in particular with the preparation formulated using S5.<br>
C Examination of the herbicidal action<br>
1. Herbicidal action against harmful grasses<br>
The herbicidal action of the active compound concentrates according to the invention<br>
against gramineous harmful plants was demonstrated by the following greenhouse<br>
tests:<br>
The culture containers used were plastic pots containing loamy sand with<br>
approximately 3.0% of humus as the substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown<br>
separately for each species.<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the active compound concentrates, which with water<br>
to the desired application concentration, were applied directly after sowing by means of<br>
finely distributing nozzles applied at the stated application rate. The containers were<br>
irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and subsequently covered with<br>
transparent plastic hoods until the plants had rooted. This cover causes uniform<br>
germination of the test plants, unless this has been impaired by the active compounds.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to<br>
15 cm, depending on the plant habit, and then treated with the active compound<br>
concentrates with water to the desired application concentration (about 66 to 525 mg of<br>
active compound/I). For this purpose, the test plants were either sown directly and<br>
grown in the same containers, or they were first grown separately as seedlings and<br>
transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to treatment.<br><br>
Depending on the species, the plants were kept at temperatures of 10 - 25°C or<br>
20	- 35°C. The test period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the plants<br>
were tended, and their response to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br>
Evaluation was carried out using a scale from 0 to 100. 100 means no emergence of<br>
the plants, or complete destruction of at least the above-ground parts, and 0 means no<br>
damage, or normal course of growth.<br>
The harmful plants (weeds) examined were grasses of the following species:<br>
Digitaria sanguinalis (DIGSA), Echinochloa crus-galli (ECHCG), Panicum sp. (PANDI),<br>
Panicum milliaceum (PANMI), Setaria faberr (SETFA), Setaria italica (SETIT), Setaria<br>
lutescens (SETLU), Setaria viridis (SETVI).<br>
Table 1 shows the results obtained for the post-emergence treatment (damage 20 or<br>
21	days after treatment).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
At the same application rate, the herbicidal activity of concentrates formulated according to<br>
the invention against gramineous harmful plants exceeds the activity of a concentrate<br>
without added surfactants considerably. In particular in the case of Setaria species,<br>
complete control was possible.<br>
2. Herbicidal action against non-gramineous harmful plants<br>
Analogously to 1., the activity of formulations according to the invention against the non-<br>
gramineous harmful plants Avena fatua, Sorghum bicolor was examined.<br>
Table 2 shows the results obtained for the post-emergence treatment (examined 20 or 21<br>
days after treatment).<br><br><br><br>
A: 25 g of topramezone/ha, 80 g of dicamba/ha, 150 g of substance S/ha, or A': 25 g of<br>
topramezone/ha, 80 g of dicamba/ha,<br>
B: 12.5 g of topramezone/ha, 40 g of dicamba/ha, 75 g of substance S/ha, or B: 12.5 g of<br>
topramezone/ha, 40 g of dicamba/ha<br>
C: 6.25 g of topramezone/ha, 20 g of dicamba/ha, 37.5 g of substance S/ha, or C: 6.25 g of<br>
topramezone/ha, 20 g of dicamba/ha<br>
D: 3.13 g of topramezone/ha, 10 g of dicamba/ha, 18.8 g of substance S/ha, or D: 3.13 g of<br>
topramezone/ha, 10 g of dicamba/ha<br><br>
3'. Herbicidal action against useful plants<br>
Analogously to 1., the activity of active compound concentrates according to the invention<br>
against the useful plants Zea mays (ZEAMX) of the cultivars "Dea" and "Helix" was<br>
examined.<br>
The plants were treated by the post-emergence method. The damage to the plants was<br>
determined on day 6 or 8 (measurement A) and on day 20 or 21 (measurement B) after the<br>
treatment. Otherwise, the procedure of Example 1 was adopted.<br><br><br><br><br>
