				<td>The present invention relates to bicyclic corticotropin releasing factor antagonist compounds of formula (I) and process for preparation <br>
thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to bicyclic derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapy.<br>
The first corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was isolated from ovine hypothalami and identified as a 41-amino acid peptide (Vale etal., Science 213: 1394-1397,1981). CRF has been found to produce profound alterations in endocrine, nervous and immune system function. CRF is believed to be the major physiological regulator of the basal and stress-release of adrenocorticotropic hormone ("ACTH"), Bendorphin and other proopiomelanocortin ("POMC")-derived peptides from the anterior pituitary (Vale et al., Science 213: 1394-1397,1981).<br>
In addition to its role in stimulating the production of ACTH and POMC, CRF appears to be one of the pivotal central nervous system neurotransmitters and plays a crucial role in integrating the body's overall response to stress.<br>
Administration of CRF directly to the brain elicits behavioral, physiological and endocrine responses identical to those observed for an animal exposed to a stressful environment. Accordingly, clinical data suggests that CRF receptor antagonists may represent novel antidepressant  and/or  anxiolytic  drugs   that  may  be  useful   in   the  treatment  of the neuropsychiatric disorders manifesting hypersecretion of CRF.<br>
The first CRF receptor antagonists were peptides (see, e.g., Rivier et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,605,642; Rivier et al., Science 224: 889,1984). While these peptides established that CRF receptor antagonists can attenuate the pharmacological responses to CRF, peptide CRF receptor antagonists suffer from the usual drawbacks of peptide therapeutics including lack of stability and limited oral activity. More recently, small molecule CRF receptor antagonists have been reported.<br>
WO 95/10506 describes inter alia compounds of general formula (A) with general CRF antagonist activity<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Y may be CR29, V may be nitrogen, Z may be carbon, R3 may correspond to an amine derivative and R4 may be taken together with R29 to form a 5-membered ring and is -CH(R28) when R29 is-CH(R30). There are no specific disclosures of compounds corresponding to this definition.<br>

WO 95/10506 describes inter alia compounds of general formula (A) with general CRF antagonist activity<br>
(Figure Remove) wherein Y may be CR29; V may be nitrogen, Z may be carbon, R3 may correspond to an amme derivative and R4 may be taken together with R29 to form a 5-membered ring and is -CH(R28) when R29 is-CH(R30). There are no specific disclosures of compounds corresponding to this definition.<br>
WO 95/33750 also describes compounds of general formula (B) having CRF antagonistic activity,<br><br>
(Figure Remove) in which A and Y may be nitrogen and carbon and B may correspond to an amine derivative. There are no specific disclosures of compounds corresponding to this definition.<br>
WO 98/08846 describes compounds of general formula (C) having CRF antagonistic activity,<br>
(Figure Remove) wherein A may be carbon, G may be nitrogen or carbon, B may be an amino derivative and the other groups have the meanings as defined.<br>
Due to the physiological significance of CRF, the development of biologically-active small molecules having significant CRF receptor binding activity and which are capable of antagonizing the CRF receptor remains a desirable goal. Such CRF receptor antagonists would be useful in the treatment of endocrine, psychiatric and neurologic conditions or illnesses, including stress-related disorders in general.<br>
While significant strides have been made toward achieving CRF regulation through administration of CRF receptor antagonists, there remains a need in the art for effective small molecule CRF receptor antagonists. There is also a need for pharmaceutical compositions containing such CRF receptor antagonists, as well as methods relating to the use thereof to treat, for example, stress-related disorders. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.<br>
In particular the invention relates to novel compounds which are potent and specific antagonists of corticotropm-releasing factor (CRF) receptors.<br>
The present invention provides compounds of formula (I) including stereoisomers, prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof<br>

Examples of suitable hydroxy protecting group include trihydrocarbyl silyl ethers such as the tnmethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether. The hydroxyl protecting groups may be removed by well-known standard procedures (such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, pages 46-119, Edited by J F W McOmie (Plenum Press, 1973)). For example when Pg is a t-butyldimethylsilyl group, this may be removed by treatment with tnethylamine frihydrofluonde.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical acceptable salts may also be prepared from other salts, including other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, of the compound of formula (I) using conventional methods.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may readily be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallisation or evaporation of an appropriate solvent to give the corresponding solvates.<br>
When a specific enantiomer of a compound of general formula (I) is required, this may be obtained for example by resolution of a corresponding enantiomeric mixture of a compound of formula (I) using conventional methods. Thus the required enantiomer may be obtained from the racemic compound of formula (I) by use of chiral HPLC procedure.<br>
The subject invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formulas I and following, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.  Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the  invention include  isotopes  of hydrogen,  carbon, nitrogen,  oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as 3H, "C, 14C, 18F, I23I and 125I. Compounds   of the   present  invention   and  pharmaceutically   acceptable   salts   of said compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, I4C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tntiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., I4C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. "C and 8F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron emission tomography), and 125I isotopes   are   particularly   useful   in   SPECT   (single   photon   emission   computerized tomography), all useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I and following of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>

In an alternative or further aspect there is provided a method for the treatment of a mammal, including man, in particular in the treatment of condition mediated by CRF, comprising administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a solvate thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated that reference to treatment is intended to include prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be administered as the raw chemical but the active ingredient is preferably presented as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least one compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and formulated for administration by any convenient route. Such compositions are preferably in a form adapted for use in medicine, in particular human medicine, and can conveniently be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
Thus compounds of formula (I) may be formulated for oral, buccal, parenteral, topical (including ophthalmic and nasal), depot or rectal administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or nose).<br><br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets  or capsules prepared by conventional  means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
For buccal administration the composition may take the form of tablets or formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration in the form of ointments, creams, gels, lotions, pessaries, aerosols or drops (e.g. eye, ear or nose drops). Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Ointments for administration to the eye may be manufactured in a sterile manner using sterilised components.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, stabilising agents, solubilising agents or suspending agents. They may also contain a preservative.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycendes.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
For intranasal administration, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as solutions for administration via a suitable metered or unitary dose device or alternatively as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds of the invention is 1 to about lOOOmg per day. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage, depending on the age and condition of the patient and the precise dosage will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration and the particular compound selected.<br>
Thus for parenteral administration a daily dose will typically be in the range of 1 to about 100 mg, preferably 1 to 80 mg per day. For oral administration a daily dose will typically be within the range 1 to 300 mg e.g. 1 to 100 mg.<br>

(Table Remove) EXAMPLE 3 CRF Binding Activity<br>
CRF binding affinity has been determined in vitro by the compounds' ability to displace I25I-oCRF and 125I-Sauvagme for CRF1 and CRP2 SPA, respectively, from recombinant human CRF receptors expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes. For membrane preparation, CHO cells from confluent T-flasks were collected in SPA buffer (HEPES/KOH SOmM, EDTA 2mM; MgCl2 lOmM, pH 7.4.) in 50mL centnftige tubes, homogenized with a Polytron and centrifuged (50'000g for 5min at 4°C: Beckman centrifuge with JA20 rotor). The pellet was resuspended, homogenized and centrifuged as before.<br>
The SPA experiment has been carried out in Optiplate by the addition of 100 uL the reagent mixture to luL of compound dilution (100% DMSO solution) per well. The assay mixture was prepared by mixing SPA buffer, WGA SPA beads (2.5 mg/mL), BSA (1 mg/mL) and membranes (50 and 5 ug of protein/mL for CRF1 and CRF2 respectively) and 50 pM of radioligand.<br>
The plate was incubated overnight (&gt;18 hrs) at room temperature and read with the Packard Topcount with a WGA-SPA 125I counting protocol.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 CRF functional assay<br>
Compounds of the invention were characterised in a functional assay for the determination of their inhibitory effect. Human CRF-CHO cells were stimulated with CRF and the receptor activation was evaluated by measuring the accumulation of cAMP.<br>
CHO cells from a confluent T-flask were resuspended with culture medium without G418 and dispensed in a 96-well plate, 25'000c/well, 100 uL/well and incubated overnight. After the incubation the medium was replaced with 100 uL of cAMP IBMX buffer warmed at 37°C (5mM KC1, 5mM NaHCO3, 154mM NaCl, 5mM HEPES, 2.3mM CaCl2, ImM MgCl2; Ig/L glucose, pH 7.4 additioned by Img/mL BSA and ImM IBMX) and luL of antagonist dilution in neat DMSO. After 10 additional minutes of incubation at 37°C in a plate incubator without CO2, luL of agonist dilution in neat DMSO was added. As before, the plate was incubated for 10 minutes and then cAMP cellular content was measured by using the Amersham RPA 538 kit.<br>
