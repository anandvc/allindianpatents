				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to communication signal processing, and particularly<br>
relates to distributed transmit diversity in wireless communication networks.<br>
Maintaining acceptable communication performance in mobile communication environments<br>
poses significant challenges. For example, the relative movement between a wireless<br>
communication transmitter and receiver gives rise to complex and dynamically changing<br>
channel fading conditions. Even in low-mobility circumstances, one or more propagation<br>
paths between a particular transmitter and receiver may be severely faded because of<br>
obstructions.<br>
Conventional wireless communication networks may employ different forms of transmit<br>
diversity to mitigate at least some of the fading problems mentioned above. For example,<br>
some types of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks use simple spatial diversity<br>
to improve reception performance under certain conditions. With spatial diversity, the same<br>
signal is transmitted from two or more antennas and travels to the intended receiver over<br>
different propagation channels. Reception is improved because each propagation channel<br>
generally has independent fading characteristics, assuming that the transmit antennas are not<br>
co-located elements within closely spaced antenna array.<br>
For co-located transmit antennas, a different form of transmit diversity may be used. It is<br>
known, for example, to use space-time coding for the transmission of a given information<br>
signal via co-located antenna elements. The use of co-located antenna array elements is a<br>
general characteristic of conventional space-time coding systems, wherein different antenna<br>
elements in a transmit antenna array are used to transmit space-time coded signals. As one<br>
example, the well-known Alamouti scheme generally uses two co-located antenna array<br>
elements to transmit a 2 x 2 space-time code word (STC)1 which can be decoded by an<br>
appropriately configured receiver.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, different diversity-coded versions of a given<br>
information signal are transmitted from multiple sectors of a wireless communication<br>
network, based on employing a set of diversity codes across the involved sectors. As such, the<br>
targeted receiver(s) benefit from spatial and temporal (or spectral) diversity reception. Note<br>
that for purposes of discussion herein, the term "diversity codes" encompasses both space-<br>
time code sets and space-frequency code sets, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
As taught herein, one embodiment of a diversity transmission method comprises transmitting<br>
an information signal from two or more sectors of a wireless communication<br>
network to at least one mobile station by generating diversity-coded versions of the<br>
information signal according to a set of diversity codes, transmitting a different diversity-<br>
coded version of the information signal from each of the two or more sectors, and controlling<br>
the transmission to effect a substantial balance in diversity code strengths at the at least one<br>
mobile station.<br>
The diversity codes may be space-time codes, such as Alamouti codes, for example. More<br>
generally, however, generating diversity-coded versions of an information signal according to<br>
a set of diversity codes comprises generating M diversity-coded versions of the information<br>
signal according to a set of diversity codes. With that approach, diversity transmission<br>
comprises transmitting the M diversity-coded versions of the information signal from N<br>
sectors of the wireless communication network. If M= N, then a different diversity-coded<br>
version of the information signal is transmitted from each of the involved sectors. If M 
then a least one of the different diversity-coded versions of the information signal is<br>
transmitted from more than one of the involved sectors.<br>
The single-sector or combined-sector transmission strength used for transmitting each<br>
diversity-coded version of the information can be controlled to balance the diversity code<br>
strengths as received at the mobile station(s). Alternatively, or additionally, the number of<br>
individual sectors used for transmitting each diversity-coded version of the information signal<br>
can be controlled to balance the diversity code strengths at the mobile station(s). Balancing is<br>
desirable because balanced code strengths at the remote receiver(s) improve the diversity<br>
gains.<br>
3<br><br>
Diversity transmission as taught herein may be applied to different types of signals. For<br>
example, in at least one embodiment, diversity transmission is used for individual users'<br>
information signals, e.g., dedicated channel signals. For example, a base station system can be<br>
configured to use diversity transmission for mobile stations in soft or softer handoff with the<br>
base station system. In a softer handoff scenario, two or more sector transmitters at the same<br>
radio base station transmit a different diversity-coded version of the same user's information<br>
signal. The diversity-coding circuit(s) to carry out diversity-coding of that user's information<br>
signal may be located at the radio base station, or at an associated base station controller.<br>
In that same embodiment, or in other embodiments of a base station system, diversity<br>
transmission is applied to soft handoff transmissions of a given user's signal, wherein a<br>
particular mobile station is in soft handoff with different radio base stations. In such soft<br>
handoff conditions, different diversity-coded versions of the mobile station's information<br>
signal are transmitted from different radio base stations. The radio base stations may be under<br>
control of the same base station controller, or different base station controllers may be<br>
involved, hi either case, the base station controllers) may perform the diversity coding and<br>
send the different diversity-coded versions of the user's information signal to the involved<br>
radio base stations for transmission, or the radio base stations each may receive the same<br>
information signal and perform diversity coding as part of transmit processing. The base<br>
station controllers may be set up to communicate with each other regarding the diversity<br>
codes to be used for transmitting the different diversity-coded versions of the information<br>
signal.<br>
Further, in at least one embodiment, the wireless communication network is configured to use<br>
diversity transmission as taught herein for Broadcast-Multicast Services (BCMCS) signals.<br>
For example, a base station system can be configured to broadcast different diversity- coded<br>
versions of a BCMCS signal from one or more of its sectors. More generally, different<br>
diversity-coded versions of a given BCMCS signal can be transmitted from different sectors<br>
of the communication network, whether those sectors are part of the same base station system,<br>
or belong to multiple base station systems.<br>
In either case, a wireless communication network node may be configured to generate the<br>
different diversity-coded versions of the BCMCS signal, for distribution to the involved sector<br>
4<br><br>
transmitters. Alternatively, the BCMCS signal may be distributed to the involved sector<br>
transmitters, each of which is configured to perform diversity coding as part of transmission<br>
processing. In that latter case, a centralized node still may be configured to set, track and/or<br>
manage the particular space-time (or space-frequency) codes being used at each of the sector<br>
transmitters. It also should be noted that these same node-based centralized distribution,<br>
coding, and/or code management concepts could be applied to diversity transmission of one<br>
or more dedicated channel signals. Note, too, that different diversity codes or code sets can be<br>
used for different information signals.<br>
Further, the particular codes used for generating the different diversity-coded versions of a<br>
BCMCS or dedicated channel signal may be arranged across the sector transmitters of a given<br>
geographic region according to a multi-sector diversity code distribution pattern. The<br>
particular diversity code distribution adopted for a given region may be based on analytical or<br>
empirical data.<br>
Regardless of how it is determined, a given diversity code distribution pattern may be<br>
dynamically updated as part of ongoing diversity transmission operations. That is, the<br>
diversity codes being used for diversity coding a particular information signal can be<br>
dynamically changed at one or more of the sectors transmitting the diversity-coded versions<br>
of that information signal. Such changes may be performed according to pre-configured<br>
information, or according to information communicated from the network to the involved<br>
mobile stations. Information sent from the network to the mobile stations regarding dynamic<br>
redistribution of diversity codes may be sent on the fly and/or as part of call setup.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above features and advantages. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading the following<br>
detailed description, and upon viewing the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram partially illustrating a wireless communication network 10 that is<br>
configured according to one embodiment of diversity-coded transmission as taught herein.<br>
Each of a number of spaced-apart transmitters 12 receives a different diversity-coded version<br>
of the same information signal, $, from one or more diversity-coding circuits 14, which may<br>
be implemented as a separate node within the network 10. By way of non-limiting example,<br>
the transmitters 12 may comprise sector transmitters located at one radio base station, or may<br>
comprise sector transmitters at different radio base stations, and the diversity-coding circuit(s)<br>
14 may comprise processing circuits located in a base station controller that is associated with<br>
the radio base station(s).<br>
Regardless, the information signal may comprise a dedicated channel signal targeted to a<br>
particular mobile station 16, or may be a Broadcast-Multicast Services (BCMCS) signal, or<br>
other type of broadcast signal, targeted to a potentially large number of mobile stations 16.<br>
Moreover, it should be understood that the network 10 could provide similar diversity-coded<br>
transmissions for additional information signals, which may be dedicated channel signals,<br>
broadcast signals, or any combination thereof.<br>
More broadly, it should be understood that transmit diversity as taught herein can be applied<br>
to terrestrial communication networks, satellite-based communication networks, and to mixed<br>
networks including both terrestrial and satellite-based communication stations. In satellite-<br>
6<br><br>
based implementations, the term "sector" may comprise a defined service region targeted by a<br>
particular antenna array or beam of a given satellite-based transmitting station, which may be<br>
considered a node within the larger network. Thus, the illustrated embodiment of network 10<br>
thus should be understood as a non-limiting example.<br>
Regardless, the information signal, depicted as signal s in the illustrated embodiment, can be<br>
diversity-coded by the diversity-coding circuit(s) 14, and a different diversity-coded version<br>
of that signal can be transmitted from each of the transmitters 12 (shown as 12-1<br>
through 12-N). For example, the transmitter 12-1 transmits a first diversity-coded version of<br>
the signal s, denoted as si, the transmitter 12-2 transmits a second diversity-coded version of<br>
the signal s, denoted as s2, and so on. In at least one embodiment, the diversity-coding<br>
circuit(s) 14 are configured to use a set of space-time codes, while in one or more other<br>
embodiments, they are configured to use a set of space-frequency codes. Whether space-time<br>
or space-frequency coding is used can be a matter of network type. For example, space-time<br>
coding complements CDMA networks, which generally use the same carrier frequency across<br>
multiple base stations. In other types of networks, space-frequency coding may be a more<br>
complementary choice and the term "diversity code" is used to refer to either space-time<br>
codes or space-frequency codes unless contextually noted otherwise.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates another embodiment of the network 10, wherein the diversity-coding<br>
circuit(s) 14 are co-located with the transmitters 12. Indeed, diversity-coding circuitry may be<br>
incorporated into each of the transmitters 12; such that diversity coding is implemented by the<br>
transmitters 12 as part of transmit processing, at least for selected ones of the signals being<br>
transmitted by them. With the embodiment of Fig. 2, a given information signal may be<br>
distributed to the transmitters 12 by one or more base station controllers (not shown): The<br>
particular code(s) used at each one of the transmitters 12 can be fixed by design, set according<br>
to network provisioning information stored at the transmitters 12, or communicated to the<br>
transmitters 12, from the base station controllers) associated with them, for example. In that<br>
latter case, the code(s) used at each transmitter 12 can be fixed by base station controller<br>
provisioning information, or can be dynamically assigned.<br>
The functionality of the transmitters 12 and the diversity-coding circuit(s) 14 may be<br>
implemented in a radio base station embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3. The illustrated radio<br>
base station (RBS) 20 is configured for diversity-coding one or more information signals<br>
7<br><br>
received from an associated base station controller, for example. The RBS 20 comprises<br>
interface/control circuits 22, which include diversity-coding circuits 24, and a plurality of<br>
sector transmitters 26 (shown as sector transmitters 26-1, 26-2, and 26-3). The RBS 20 may<br>
be configured for operation according to a variety of wireless communication network<br>
standards, including those based on CMDA or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) signal types.<br>
In one embodiment, the RBS 20 can be configured to employ diversity coding for mobile<br>
stations 16 that are in softer handoff with it. That is, in circumstances where the same<br>
information is being transmitted to a given mobile station 16 from two or more of the RBS's<br>
sector transmitters 26, the RBS 20 sends a different diversity-coded version of that mobile<br>
station's information signal from each of the involved sector transmitters 26. Such diversity<br>
coding can be managed at the RBS-level, via the included diversity-coding circuits 24.<br>
For soft handoff conditions on the forward link, wherein a given mobile station 16 is being<br>
served from two or more sectors located at different RBSs 20, diversity coding may be<br>
implemented by one or more oase station controllers (BSCs) associated with the involved<br>
RBSs 20. Fig. 4 illustrates an embodiment of a BSC 30 that is configured for BSC-level<br>
diversity coding of information signals, and comprises communication/control circuits 32,<br>
which include diversity-coding circuits 34, and RBS interface circuits 36.<br>
Note that with the BSC-level implementation of diversity coding shown in Rg. 4, the<br>
diversity-coding circuits 24 may be omitted from the RBS 20. However, leaving the RBSs 20<br>
with their own diversity coding circuits may offer advantages for softer handoff scenarios,<br>
and may reduce the BSC-RBS communication load in certain scenarios. For example, if a<br>
given information signal is to be transmitted from two or more sectors of a given RBS 20, it<br>
can be sent from the BSC 30 to the RBS 20 as a single information signal, and the RBS 20<br>
can generate the multiple, diversity-coded versions of that signal for transmission. In the<br>
alternative, where the diversity coding is done at the BSC-level (or higher), each of the<br>
different diversity- coded versions of the same information signal is sent from the BSC 30 to<br>
the RBS 20. Obviously, the latter embodiment offers certain advantages regarding a more<br>
centralized approach in the network 10 to diversity coding, but comes at the expense of<br>
requiring potentially more communication resources between the different network entities.<br>
8<br><br>
In at least one embodiment, the diversity-coding circuits are located at the RBS 20 for both<br>
softer and soft handoff. In soft handoff scenarios, the BSC 30 directs the diversity coding of<br>
the RBS 20 (e.g., the BSC 30 tells the RBS 20 which codes or type of codes to use).<br>
In other embodiments, at least a portion of the diversity-coding circuit(s) reside at higher<br>
levels in the network hierarchy, and/or comprise centralized resources that provide for full or<br>
partial diversity coding control across a number of other network nodes, e.g., across BSCs 30<br>
and/or RBSs 20. Thus, in at least one embodiment, diversity transmission is implemented in a<br>
system for use in a wireless communication network, wherein that system comprises two or<br>
more sector transmitters 26, each configured to transmit a diversity-coded version of an<br>
information signal, one or more diversity coding circuits configured to generate the diversity-<br>
coded versions of the information signal for transmission from the two or more sector<br>
transmitters 26, and configured to control transmission of the diversity-coded versions of the<br>
information signal to effect a substantial balance in diversity code strengths at the at least one<br>
mobile station 16.<br>
The system may comprise a radio base station system that includes one or more RBSs 20,<br>
which include the two or more sector transmitters 26, and a BSC 30 configured to control the<br>
RBSs 20. Further, the BSC 30 may include the diversity coding circuits, which may be<br>
configured to balance diversity code strengths at the at least one mobile station 16 by<br>
controlling the number of sectors 26 used to transmit each diversity-coded version of the<br>
information signal and/or by controlling the transmit powers of the sectors 26 being used to<br>
transmit the diversity-coded versions of the information signal.<br>
Further, the diversity-coding circuits may be distributed between two or more BSCs 30, or<br>
they may reside at least partially apart from the BSC(s) 30. Thus, the diversity-coding circuits<br>
can be configured to control transmission of the diversity-coded versions of the information<br>
signal by two or more BSCs 30, such that RBSs 20 operating under different BSCs 30<br>
cooperate to effect a substantial balance in diversity code strengths at the at least one mobile<br>
station 16.<br>
With these and other embodiments in mind, Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate non-limiting variations of<br>
distributed transmit diversity that may be practiced within a base station system. Thus, with a<br>
focus on distributed diversity transmission, a base station system generally comprises sector<br>
9<br><br>
transmitters (e.g., RBS sector transmitters 26), and diversity coding circuits (e.g., diversity<br>
coding circuits 24 and/or 34). In one embodiment, a base station system comprises a BSC 30<br>
and at least one RBS 20, wherein the RBS 20 includes diversity-coding capabilities, or the<br>
BSC 30 includes diversity-coding capabilities, or they both do. In other embodiments, some<br>
or all of the diversity coding functions are centralized within the network 10, or at least<br>
centralized for a given group of sectors.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment of the network 10 that is useful for discussing other aspects<br>
of centralized diversity coding. As illustrated, the network 10 comprises a Radio Access<br>
Network (RAN) 40, which includes a number of BSCs 30 and RBSs 20, and further includes<br>
a centralized node 42 that is configured for diversity-coding at least some types of<br>
information signals. The network 10 further includes a Packet Switched Core Network<br>
(PSCN) 44 and/or a Circuit Switched Core Network (CSCN) 46, that communicatively couple<br>
mobile stations 16 being supported by the RAN 40 to one or more external networks. Such<br>
networks may comprise a Public Data Network (PDN) 50, such as the Internet, or may<br>
comprise the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 52.<br>
Regardless, each BSC 30 controls one or more RBSs 20, and each RBS 20 defines a radio cell<br>
(e.g., cell "C1 ," "C2," etc.), with each such cell divided into multiple radio sectors (e.g.,<br>
sector "S1 ," "S2," and "S3"). The BSCs 30 receive information signals that are processed and<br>
passed along for transmission by the appropriate RBSs 20. As noted, these information<br>
signals may be broadcast signals intended for a group of mobile stations 16, or dedicated<br>
channel signals intended for particular ones of the mobile stations 16, or some mix thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, diversity coding is done at the BSC level and/or at the RBS level, as<br>
previously discussed herein. However, in addition to those levels of diversity coding, or as an<br>
alternative to BSC or RBS diversity coding, the centralized node 42 may be configured for<br>
centralized diversity coding of at least some types of information signals. Thus, in one<br>
embodiment, the centralized node 42 may be configured to generated diversity-coded versions<br>
of one or more broadcast signals. With that approach, dedicated channel signal diversity-<br>
coding still may be performed at the BSC level, or at the RBS level, as is appropriate for soft<br>
or softer handoff transmission modes. Of course, it should be understood that other<br>
combinations of centralized and non-centralized diversity coding are contemplated herein.<br>
10<br><br>
In at least one embodiment of the network 10, at least some aspects of multi-sector diversity<br>
coding involved centralized functions. For example, the centralized node 42 can be<br>
configured to process signal strength feedback, channel information, or other form of received<br>
signal information feedback from one or more mobile stations 16 that are receiving diversity<br>
transmissions. The node 42 may then send control message, commands, or other signal<br>
information to one or more BSCs 30, such that multiple BSCs 30 and RBSs 20 are controlled<br>
to effect the desired diversity code strength balancing at the one or more mobile stations 16.<br>
In other embodiments, the BSCs 30 may carry out feedback processing and provide<br>
corresponding reports to the node 42, which may then send individual or distributed control<br>
information to the BSCs 30 involved in the transmission of diversity-coded signals to<br>
particular mobile stations 16, such that a desired diversity code strength balance is achieved at<br>
those mobile stations 16.<br>
In another aspect, the node 42 may be configured to maintain one or more sets of diversity<br>
codes to be used for diversity coding, and can be configured to assign particular diversity<br>
codes to particular sectors of the network 10. Further, the centralized node 42 can be<br>
configured to update the per-sector code assignments dynamically for one or more<br>
information signals subject to diversity-coded transmission. In this manner, the pattern of<br>
diversity code distribution among the involved sectors changes, which may benefit reception<br>
under certain conditions. The mechanism used to drive the dynamic pattern changing may be<br>
based on empirical data or based on analytical data.<br>
As a non-limiting example, the performance gains of diversity coding may depend on the<br>
relative strengths of the different diversity-coded versions of the information signal, as<br>
received by the mobile station 16. For example, consider Alamouti codes with its use of two<br>
space-time code types. With Alamouti coding, reception performance gains at the mobile<br>
station 16 generally are maximized when the mobile station 16 "sees" the two codes at equal<br>
strength.<br>
Thus, if one code is dominant, the performance gain can be negligible. As such, dynamic code<br>
pattern changes may consider making equal-strength codes for the mobile station(s) 16,<br>
particularly for the dedicated channel case. That is, the network 10 may be configured to<br>
transmit diversity-coded versions of a given information signal, such that the one or more<br>
11<br><br>
mobile stations 16 interested in that information signal, receive the differently coded versions<br>
at substantially the same signal strength.<br>
In one embodiment, the network 10 uses channel information returned from the mobile<br>
station(s) 16 for this purpose. As used herein, the term "channel information" is used broadly<br>
to denote information directly or indirectly related to the propagation channels between the<br>
mobile station(s) 16, and the sectors of the network 10 involved in transmitting diversity-<br>
coded versions of a given information signal. By way of non-limiting examples, the channel<br>
information returned by a given mobile station 16 may include one or more of channel quality<br>
indicators, pilot strength measurement reports, and partial or full feedback of channel<br>
information (e.g., propagation channel coefficient feedback).<br>
With such details in mind, assume that a given mobile station 16 currently is served by three<br>
sectors in a softer or soft handoff service scenario. If the reported pilot strengths from the<br>
mobile station 16 for sector S1 is better than that of sector S2 and sector S3, it may be better<br>
to configure sector S1 to use a first code ("code 1"), and configured both sector S2 and sector<br>
S3 to use a second code ("code 2"). With this approach, the combined received signal strength<br>
of code 2 from sectors S2 and S3 can be made to better balance the received signal strength of<br>
code 1 from sector S1. In other words, the selection of which sector transmitters are used to<br>
generate particular ones of the diversity-coded versions of a given information signal can be<br>
varied, such that the differently coded diversity signals are balanced at the mobile station(s)<br>
16, in terms of their received signal strength.<br>
The network 10 also may use other criteria or other measurements to control code strength<br>
balancing within a given sector, or sectors of the network 10. For example, the network 10<br>
may control the code/sector transmission powers, and/or control which codes are transmitted<br>
from which sectors, to provide equal strength code reception for a given user, or a given<br>
group of users. By way of non-limiting example, the network 10 may be configured to<br>
balance code strengths for a given class of users, as a group, or as individuals, i.e., code<br>
strength balancing may be performed for "gold" class users, but not necessarily for "bronze"<br>
class users. In other circumstances, the network 10 may attempt to balance code strengths for<br>
a targeted group of users located in the same geographic area. For example, if a plurality of<br>
mobile stations 16 were congregated at a sporting event, a BCMCS signal associated with that<br>
12<br><br>
event may be transmitted such that substantially equal strength codes are received in and<br>
around the stadium area.<br>
Such balancing may comprise setting the transmit powers of transmitters that are nearby the<br>
location to a relatively lower power, and setting transmitters that are further away from the<br>
location to a relatively higher power. By way of non-limiting example, assume that two<br>
diversity- coded versions of an information signal are to be transmitted to a congregated<br>
group of users. Further assume that one transmitter is relatively close (or co-located) with the<br>
congregated users, and that two other transmitters are relatively further away. With these<br>
assumptions, the network 10 may transmit a first diversity-coded version of the information<br>
signal from the nearby transmitter at a given transmit power, and transmit a second diversity-<br>
coded version of the information from each of the two transmitters that are further away. The<br>
transmit powers of the near and far transmitters can be controlled separately or jointly such<br>
that the aggregate power of the two remote transmitters balances with the power of the nearby<br>
transmitter, to achieve the desired diversity code strength balance for the congregated users.<br>
Regardless of any such code strength-balancing activities, as an alternative to centralized<br>
control of code pattern changing, the network 10 may be configured such that the distributed<br>
nodes responsible for diversity coding change their diversity codes at pre-agreed times,<br>
according to pre-agreed changes. Such an approach may be particularly easy in CDMA<br>
networks, where there is network-wide synchronization among the various nodes, e.g.,<br>
wherein the BSCs 30 and/or the RBSs 20 are all operating relative to a common time<br>
reference. With such embodiments, an individual RBS 20 may be configured to change the<br>
diversity codes being used by two or more of its sector transmitters 26 according to some<br>
timed schedule (or according to a distributed trigger, such as one sent by the centralized node<br>
42, for example).<br>
Even where the network 10 is not configured to use a dynamically changing code distribution<br>
pattern, diversity codes may be distributed among a group of network sectors according to a<br>
defined pattern that optimizes code re-use among the sectors. For example, a given RBS 20,<br>
or neighboring RBSs 20, can be configured to use particular ones in a set of diversity codes,<br>
or to use particular sets of diversity codes, when diversity-coding multiple information<br>
signals, to reduce potential interference between the different diversity-coded versions of<br>
those information signals.<br>
13<br><br>
In this approach, a network operator may establish a diversity code usage pattern for a group<br>
of network sectors, and then provision the involved network entities (e.g., BSCs, RBSs, etc.)<br>
to implement the adopted code use pattern. As before, the particular pattern of code<br>
distribution among the sectors may be based on empirical data, analytic data, etc.<br>
Broadly, it should be appreciated that some multi-sector patterns of diversity code distribution<br>
among the sectors may be preferred over others, and that a particular multi-sector distribution<br>
pattern may be adopted on a static basis in one or more embodiments, and that in other<br>
embodiments, such patterns may be dynamically updated during the transmission of the<br>
information signal(s) being diversity transmitted.<br>
More broadly, and irrespective of whether such multi-sector code distribution patterns are<br>
used, it should be understood that the present invention contemplates generating diversity-<br>
coded versions of a given information signal, using either space-time codes or space-<br>
frequency codes, and transmitting those diversity-coded versions of the information signal<br>
from two or more radio sectors of a wireless communication network 10. The sectors may be<br>
at the same RBS 20, or may be at different RBSs 20.<br>
As such, the present invention contemplates the transmission of diversity-coded signals from<br>
transmission locations that are separated by significant distances (e.g., kilometers). The<br>
diversity transmissions may be based on Alamouti codes, for example, but also may be based<br>
on other space-time or space-frequency code sets. Further, such diversity transmission may be<br>
applied to broadcast signals intended for many more than one mobile station 16 and/or may be<br>
dedicated channel signals intended for targeted ones of the mobile stations 16. Still further,<br>
the present invention contemplates the use of joint distributed transmit diversity, wherein two<br>
or more of the sectors involved in transmitting diversity-coded versions of the same<br>
information signal use the same diversity codes.<br>
Still further, at least some embodiments of the present invention contemplate transmitting<br>
diversity-coded versions of an information signal, such that the targeted mobile station(s) 16<br>
receive equal-strength diversity codes (i.e., the network 10 attempts to balance the relative<br>
received signal strength of each diversity-coded version of the information signal at the<br>
mobile station(s) 16. Such operations may be based on channel information, such as pilot<br>
14<br><br>
strength reporting, etc. In at least one embodiment of code-strength balancing, one or more<br>
nodes within the network 10 are configured to carry out diversity coding for one or more<br>
information signals according to an optimal (or near optimal) diversity code distribution<br>
pattern, based on user location, channel information, etc.<br>
More generally, it should be understood that at least one embodiment of diversity-coding<br>
transmission as described herein comprises transmitting a number M diversity-coded versions<br>
of an information signal from a number N sectors of the wireless communication network 10,<br>
where M is less than, or equal to N. If M equals N, then each of the N sectors transmits a<br>
different one of the M diversity-coded versions of the information signal. If M is less than N,<br>
then the same diversity-coded version of the information signal is transmitted from more than<br>
one of the N sectors.<br>
That is, at least one of the M diversity-coded versions of the information signal is jointly<br>
transmitted from at least two of the N sectors being used to transmit the different diversity-<br>
coded versions of the information signal. Having more sectors than diversity-coded versions<br>
of the information signal provides flexibility for selecting which versions will be jointly<br>
transmitted from which ones of the sector, and can be used as a mechanism to better balance<br>
the received signal strengths of the different diversity-coded versions at the mobile station 16.<br>
As a general approach, one embodiment of the network 10 is configured to transmit different<br>
ones of the diversity-coded versions of the information signal at different aggregate transmit<br>
powers as a function of channel information returned from the one or more mobile stations<br>
16. That method may comprise transmitting different ones of the diversity-coded versions of<br>
the information signal at different aggregate transmit powers as a function of channel<br>
information from the one or more mobile stations 16, based on controlling the number of<br>
sectors used to transmit each diversity-coded version of the information signal, and the<br>
transmit powers used in that number of sectors to balance the received signal strengths of the<br>
different diversity-coded versions of the information signal at the one or more mobile stations<br>
16.<br>
With the above range of variations in mind, it should be understood that the present invention<br>
is not limited by the foregoing description, nor is it limited by the accompanying drawings.<br>
Instead, the present invention is limited only by the following claims, and their legal<br>

signal may comprise a dedicated channel signal targeted to an individual user or a broadcast<br>
signal targeted to one or more users. Thus, spaced-apart network transmitters, which may be<br>
located at the same cell site, or at different cell sites, are configured to transmit diversity-<br>
coded versions of a given information signal and, in this manner, the advantages of space-<br>
time and/or space frequency transmission coding may be applied across multiple sectors of a<br>
communication network. Such transmissions may be used to improve soft and softer handoff<br>
reception of dedicated channel signals, and to improve reception of Broadcast-Multicast<br>
Services (BCMCS) signals, or the like.<br></td>
