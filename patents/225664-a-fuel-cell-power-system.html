				<td>A FUEL CELL POWER SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field.<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel cell power system and methods of<br>
controlling a fuel cell power system.<br>
Background Art<br>
Fuel cells are known in the art. The fuel cell is an<br>
electrochemical device which reacts hydrogen, and oxygen, which is<br>
usually supplied from the ambient air, to produce electricity and water.<br>
The basic process is highly efficient and fuel cells fueled directly by<br>
hydrogen are substantially pollution free. Further, since fuel cells can<br>
be assembled into stacks of various sizes, power systems have been<br>
developed to produce a wide range of electrical power output levels<br>
and thus can be employed in numerous industrial applications.<br>
Although the fundamental electrochemical processes involved in all<br>
fuel cells are well understood, engineering solutions have proved elusive<br>
for making certain fuel cell types reliable, and for others economical.<br>
In the case of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell power<br>
systems reliability has not been the driving concern to date, but rather<br>
the installed cost per watt of generation capacity has. In order to<br>
further lower the PEM fuel cell cost per watt, much attention has been<br>
directed to increasing the power output of same. Historically, this has<br>
resulted in additional sophisticated balance-of-plant systems which are<br>
necessary to optimize and maintain high PEM fuel cell power output.<br>
A consequence of highly complex balance-of-plant systems is that they<br>
do not readily scale down to low capacity applications. Consequently,<br>
cost, efficiency, reliability and maintenance expenses are all adversely<br>
effected in low generation applications.<br>
It is well known that single PEM fuel cells produce a useful<br>
voltage of only about 0.45 to about 0.7 volts D.C. per cell under a<br>
load. Practical PEM fuel cell plants have been built from multiple<br>
cells stacked together such that they are electrically connected in series.<br>
It is further well known that PEM fuel cells can operate at higher<br>
power output levels when supplemental humidification is made available<br>
to the proton exchange membrane (electrolyte). In this regard,<br>
humidification lowers the resistance of proton exchange membranes to<br>
proton flow. To achieve this increased humidification, supplemental<br>
water can be introduced into the hydrogen or oxygen streams by various<br>
methods, or more directly to the proton exchange membrane by means<br>
of the physical phenomenon known as of wicking, for example. The<br>
focus of investigations, however, in recent years has been to develop<br>
membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) with increasingly improved power<br>
output when running without supplemental humidification. Being able<br>
to run an MEA when it is self-humidified is advantageous because it<br>
decreases the complexity of the balance-of-plant with its associated costs.<br>
However, self-humidification heretofore has resulted in fuel cells running<br>
at lower current densities and thus, in turn, has resulted in more of<br>
these assemblies being required in order to generate a given amount<br>
of power.<br>
While PEM fuel cells of various designs have operated with<br>
varying degrees of success, they have also had shortcomings which have<br>
detracted from their usefulness. For example, PEM fuel cell power<br>
systems typically have a number of individual fuel cells which are<br>
serially electrically connected (stacked) together so that the power<br>
system can have a increased output voltage. In this arrangement, if<br>
one of the fuel cells in the stack fails, it no longer contributes voltage<br>
and power. One of the more common failures of such PEM fuel cell<br>
power systems is where a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) becomes<br>
less hydrated than other MEAs in the same fuel cell stack. This loss<br>
of membrane hydration increases the electrical resistance of the effected<br>
fuel cell, and thus results in more waste heat being generated. In<br>
turn, this additional heat drys out the membrane electrode assembly.<br>
This situation creates a negative hydration spiral. The continual<br>
overheating of the fuel cell can eventually cause the polarity of the<br>
effected fuel cell to reverse such that it now begins to dissipate<br>
electrical power from the rest of the fuel cells in the stack. If this<br>
condition is not rectified, excessive heat generated by the failing fuel<br>
cell may cause the membrane electrode assembly to perforate and<br>
thereby leak hydrogen. When this perforation occurs the fuel cell stack<br>
must be completely disassembled and repaired. Depending upon the<br>
design of fuel cell stack being employed, this repair or replacement may<br>
be a costly, and time consuming endeavor.<br>
Further, designers have long sought after a means by which<br>
current densities in self-humidified PEM fuel cells can be enhanced<br>
while simultaneously not increasing the balance-of-plant requirements for<br>
these same devices.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides:<br>
a fuel cell power system, comprising:<br>
a housing defining a cavity;<br>
a plurality of terminals borne by the housing and electrically coupled with a load<br>
which has a voltage demand;<br>
a plurality of fuel cells received in the cavity of the housing and electrically<br>
coupled to the plurality of terminals, and wherein the plurality of fuel cells convert<br>
chemical energy into electricity which is supplied to the terminals to meet, at least in part,<br>
the electrical current demand of the load, and wherein the fuel cells are configured to be<br>
individually selectively deactivated, and can be physically removed, by hand, from the<br>
housing while the remaining ones of the fuel cells continue to operate and supply<br>
electricity to the terminals; and<br>
a digital control system which is electrically coupled with the plurality of fuel<br>
cells and is configured to control and monitor an operation of the plurality of fuel cells<br>
and the fuel cell power system.<br>

cartridges 14. Main valve 47 controls the flow of fuel from fuel<br>
supply 23 into fuel cell power system 10. Auxiliary valves 45 control<br>
the flow of fuel to respective fuel cell cartridges 14. Control<br>
system 30 is coupled with plural auxiliary solenoids 44 of associated<br>
auxiliary valves 45. Control system 30 is further coupled with a main<br>
solenoid 46 of associated main valve 47.<br>
The depicted fuel cell power system 10 includes an air<br>
temperature control assembly 50. The illustrated air temperature<br>
control assembly 50 includes a plenum 51 having associated ports 52<br>
corresponding to fuel cell cartridges 14. Within plenum 51 of air<br>
temperature control assembly 50, a temperature modifying element 53,<br>
fan 54, temperature sensor 55 and fuel sensor 61 are provided.<br>
A controllable air flow device or air passage 56 couples<br>
plenum 51 to exterior ambient air outside of housing 12. Air<br>
passage 56 can permit the intake of air into plenum 51 as well as the<br>
exhaustion of air from plenum 51. Control system 30 is coupled with<br>
control circuitry 51 of modifying element 53, control circuitry 48 and<br>
monitoring circuitry 49 of fan 54, temperature circuitry 68 associated<br>
with temperature sensor 55, control circuitry 57 of air passage 56, and<br>
heater 75 of fuel sensor 61.<br>
A first fuel sensor 58 is provided within housing 12 and outside<br>
of plenum 51 as shown. First fuel sensor 58 is operable to monitor<br>
for the presence of fuel within housing 12. A second fuel sensor 61<br>
is provided within plenum 51 to monitor for the presence of fuel within<br>
plenum 51. Control system 30 is configured to couple with fuel<br>
detection circuitry 64 associated with fuel sensors 58, 61. Fuel<br>
detection circuitry 64 can condition measurements obtained from<br>
sensors 58, 61.<br>
Heaters 74, 75 are coupled with respective fuel sensors 58, 61 to<br>
provide selective heating of fuel sensors 58, 61 responsive to control<br>
from control system 30. Heaters 74, 75 are integral of fuel<br>
sensors 58, 61 in some configurations. An exemplary fuel sensor<br>
configuration with an integral heater has designation TGS 813 available<br>
from Figaro Engineering, Inc. Such heaters are preferably provided in<br>
a predefined temperature range to assure proper operation. Other<br>
configurations of sensors 58, 61 are possible.<br>
An external temperature sensor 59 is provided outside of<br>
housing 12 in one embodiment. Control system 30 is also coupled with<br>
temperature circuitry 67 associated with temperature sensor 59 to<br>
monitor the exterior temperature. Temperature circuitry 67 conditions<br>
signals received from temperature sensor 59.<br>
Control system 30 is configured to at least one of control and<br>
monitor at least one operation of fuel cell power system 10. During<br>
operation, fuel from fuel supply 23 is applied to main valve 47. Main<br>
valve 47 is coupled with auxiliary valves 45 as shown. Responsive to<br>
control from control system 30, main valve 47 and auxiliary valves 45<br>
apply fuel to respective fuel cell cartridges 14. Responsive to the<br>
supply of fuel, and in the presence of oxygen, fuel cell cartridges 14<br>
produce electrical power.<br>
A power bus 60 couples the fuel cell cartridges 14 in series.<br>
Power bus 60 is coupled with external terminals 62, 63 which may be<br>
connected with an external load 22 (shown in Fig. 1). Terminal 62<br>
provides a positive terminal and terminal 63 provides a negative<br>
terminal of fuel cell power system 10.<br>
Air temperature control assembly 50 applies oxygen to the<br>
respective fuel cell cartridges 14 via ports 52. Fuel cell cartridges 14<br>
are individually operable to convert chemical energy into electricity. As<br>
described below, fuel cartridges 14 individually contain plural fuel cells<br>
individually having an anode side and a cathode side. Auxiliary<br>
valves 45 apply fuel to the anode sides of the fuel cells. Plenum 51<br>
directs air within the cathode sides of the fuel cells.<br>
Air temperature control assembly 50 preferably provides circulated<br>
air within a predetermined temperature range. Such circulated air can<br>
be exterior air and/or recirculated air. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
air temperature control assembly 50 provides air within plenum 51<br>
within an approximate temperature range of 25 °Celsius to 80 °Celsius.<br>
Upon start-up conditions of fuel cell power system 10, modifying<br>
element 53 may be controlled via control system 30 using element<br>
control circuitry 41 to either increase or decrease the temperature of<br>
air present within plenum 51. Fan 54 operates to circulate the air<br>
within plenum 51 to respective fuel cell cartridges 14. Fan control<br>
circuitry 48 and fan monitor circuitry 49 are shown coupled with fan<br>
54. Responsive to control from control system 30, fan control circuitry<br>
48 operates to control air flow rates (e.g., speed of rotation) of fan 54.<br>
Fan monitor circuitry 49 operates to monitor the actual air flow rates<br>
induced by fan 54 (e.g., circuitry 49 can comprise a tachometer for<br>
rotational fan configurations).<br>
Control system 30 monitors the temperature of the air within<br>
plenum 51 using temperature sensor 55. During operation, heat is<br>
generated and emitted from fuel cell cartridges 14. Thus, it may be<br>
necessary to decrease the temperature of air within plenum 51 to<br>
provide efficient operation of fuel cell power system 10. Responsive<br>
to control from control system 30, air passage 56 can be utilized to<br>
introduce exterior air into plenum 51 and exhaust air from plenum 51<br>
to ambient.<br>
Control system 30 communicates with control circuitry 57 to<br>
control air passage 56. In one embodiment, air passage 56 includes a<br>
plurality of vanes and control circuitry 57 operates to control the<br>
position of the vanes of air passage 56 to selectively introduce exterior<br>
air into plenum 51. The vanes of air passage 56 can preferably be<br>
provided in a plurality of orientations between an open position and a<br>
closed position to vary the amount of exterior fresh air introduced into<br>
plenum 51 or the amount of air exhausted from plenum 51 responsive<br>
to control from control system 30. Air circulated within plenum 51 can<br>
comprise recirculated and/or fresh ambient air.<br>
Utilizing temperature sensor 59, control system 30 can also<br>
monitor the temperature of ambient air about housing 12. Control<br>
system 30 can utilize such exterior temperature information from<br>
temperature sensor 59 to control the operation of air passage 56.<br>
Temperature sensor 59 is located adjacent air passage 56 in a preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
As described in further detail below, control system 30 controls<br>
air flow rates of fan 54 using fan control circuitry 48. Fan monitor<br>
circuitry 49 provides air flow rate information to control system 30.<br>
Control system 30 can monitor the total system voltage being delivered<br>
via power bus 60 by summing the individual cell voltages. Control<br>
system 30 can also monitor the electrical load being delivered via power<br>
bus 60 using current sensor 40. With knowledge of the system bus<br>
voltage and load, control system 30 can calculate waste thermal power<br>
and provide a desired cooling air flow.<br>
More specifically, the efficiency of one or more fuel cells may be<br>
determined by dividing the respective fuel cell voltage by 1.23 (a<br>
theoretical maximum voltage of a single fuel cell). An average<br>
efficiency can be determined for all fuel cells 90 of fuel cell power<br>
system 10. The remaining energy (energy not associated to electricity)<br>
as determined from the efficiency calculation is waste thermal power.<br>
The determined waste thermal power may be utilized to provide a<br>
desired cooling air flow. Control system 30 controls the air flow rates<br>
of fan 54 depending upon the waste thermal power in accordance with<br>
one aspect of the described fuel cell power system 10.<br>
During operation of fuel cell cartridges 14, non-fuel diluents such<br>
as cathode-side water and atmospheric constituents can diffuse from the<br>
cathode side of the fuel cell through a membrane electrode assembly<br>
of the fuel cell and accumulate in the anode side of the fuel cell. In<br>
addition, impurities in the fuel supply delivered directly to the anode<br>
side of the fuel cell also accumulate. Without intervention, these<br>
diluents can dilute the fuel sufficiently enough to degrade performance.<br>
Accordingly, the anode side of the individual fuel cells is connected to<br>
a bleed manifold 65. Bleed manifold 65 is additionally coupled with<br>
bleed valve 43.<br>
Control system 30 selectively operates bleed solenoid 42 to<br>
selectively open and close bleed valve 43 permitting exhaustion of<br>
matter such as entrained diluents and perhaps some fuel via a bleed<br>
exhaust 66 within housing 12. Control system 30 can operate to open<br>
and close bleed valve 43 on a periodic basis. The frequency of<br>
openings and closings of bleed valve 43 can be determined by a<br>
number of factors, such as electrical load coupled with terminals 62, 63,<br>
etc. Although not shown, a fuel recovery system may be coupled with<br>
bleed exhaust 66 to retrieve unused fuel for recirculation or other uses.<br>
Following a start-up condition either inputted via interface or<br>
from remote device 24, control system 30 selectively controls switching<br>
device 38 to couple power bus 60 with positive terminal 62. Switching<br>
device 38 can comprise parallel MOSFET switches to selectively couple<br>
power bus 60 with an external load 22.<br>
For example, control system 30 may verify when an appropriate<br>
operational temperature within plenum 51 has been reached utilizing<br>
temperature sensor 55. In addition, control system 30 can verify that<br>
at least one electrical characteristic, such as voltage and/or current, of<br>
respective fuel cell cartridges 14 has been reached before closing<br>
switching device 38 to couple power bus 60 with an associated load 22.<br>
Such provides proper operation of fuel cell power system 10 before<br>
coupling bus 60 with an external load 22.<br>
Power supply 32 includes power supplies having different voltage<br>
potentials in the described embodiment. For example, power supply 32<br>
can provide a 5-volt supply voltage for operating the digital circuitry of<br>
fuel cell power system 10, such as control system 30. Power supply 32<br>
can also provide higher voltage potentials, such as +/- 12 volts for<br>
operation of components such as fan 54 within fuel cell power<br>
system 10.<br>
Further, power supply 32 can include a battery powering<br>
components during start-up procedures. Following start-up procedures,<br>
power supply 32 can be coupled with power bus 60 and internal power<br>
utilized by fuel cell power system 10 can be derived from electrical<br>
power generated from fuel cell cartridges 14. Charge circuitry 34 is<br>
provided to selectively charge batteries of power supply 32 utilizing<br>
power from power bus 60. Control system 30 is configured to monitor<br>
electrical conditions of the batteries and the supplied voltages of power<br>
supply 32 using power supply sensors 31. Control system 30 can<br>
operate charge circuitry 34 to charge batteries of power supply 32<br>
depending upon such monitoring operations.<br>
Control system 30 is also coupled with communication port 36<br>
providing communications to an external device such as a remote<br>
device 24. An exemplary remote device 24 comprises an external<br>
control system or monitoring system off-site from fuel cell power<br>
system 10. Control system 30 can output data including requests,<br>
commands, operational conditions, etc., of fuel cell power system 10<br>
using communication port 36. In addition, control system 30 can<br>
receive data including commands, requests, etc., from remote device 24<br>
using communication port 36.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, an exemplary fuel cell cartridge 14 is shown.<br>
Further details of fuel cell cartridge 14 are disclosed in detail in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 08/979,853 incorporated by reference<br>
above. The depicted fuel cell cartridge 14 includes a fuel distribution<br>
frame 70 and a force application assembly which includes plural cathode<br>
covers 71 which partially occlude respective cavities housing membrane<br>
electrode assemblies (MEA) or membrane electrode diffusion assemblies<br>
(MEDA) within fuel distribution frame 70. The depicted fuel cell<br>
cartridge 14 includes four fuel cells (individually shown as reference<br>
numeral 90 in Fig. 4). Other configurations are possible.<br>
The respective cathode covers 71 individually cooperate or<br>
otherwise mate with each other, and with the fuel distribution frame 70.<br>
Individual apertures 72 which are defined by the cathode cover, define<br>
passageways 73 which permit air from plenum 51 to circulate to the<br>
cathode side of the membrane electrode diffusion assembly contained<br>
within fuel distribution frame 70. The circulation of air through the<br>
fuel cell cartridge 14 is discussed in significant detail in U.S. patent<br>
application Serial No. 08/979,853 incorporated by reference above.<br>
Conductive members 63 extend outwardly from a main body of<br>
individual fuel cells within fuel cell cartridge 14. Conductive<br>
members 63 are designed to extend through respective gaps or openings<br>
which are provided in fuel distribution frame 70. Each conductive<br>
member 63 is received between and thereafter electrically coupled with<br>
pairs of conductive contacts which are mounted on a rear wall of a<br>
subrack described in greater detail below.<br>
Fuel cell cartridge 14 is operable to be serially electrically<br>
coupled with a plurality of other fuel cell cartridges 14 by way of a<br>
subrack which is generally indicated by the numeral 76. Subrack 76<br>
has a main body 77 having top and bottom portions 78, 79,<br>
respectively. The top and bottom portions are joined together by a<br>
rear wall 80. Elongated channels 81 are individually formed in top and<br>
bottom portions 78, 79 and are operable to slidably receive individual<br>
spines 74 which are formed on fuel distribution frame 70.<br>
Subrack 76 is made of a number of mirror image portions 85,<br>
which when joined together, form the main body 77 of subrack 76.<br>
These mirror image portions 85 are fabricated from a moldable<br>
dielectric substrate. Power bus 60 is affixed on rear wall 80 of the<br>
subrack 90. A repeating pattern of eight pairs of conductive<br>
contacts 84 are attached on rear wall 80 and are coupled with power<br>
bus 60. Electrical coupling of fuel cells within fuel cell cartridge 14<br>
with power bus 60 is implemented using contacts 84 in the described<br>
embodiment.<br>
First and second conduits 86, 87 are also attached to rear<br>
wall 80 and are operable to matingly couple in fluid flowing relation<br>
to the fuel distribution frame 70. The respective first and second<br>
conduits 86, 87 extend through rear wall 80 and connect with suitable<br>
external conduits (not shown). First conduit 86 is coupled in fluid<br>
flowing relation with fuel supply 23 (Fig. 1) and with anode sides of<br>
internal fuel cells. Further, second conduit 87 exhausts from the anode<br>
sides of the fuel cells to bleed manifold 65 (Fig. 2).<br>
Individual fuel cell cartridges 14 may be selectively deactivated.<br>
For example, fuel cell cartridges 14 are individually physically removable<br>
from fuel cell power system 10. Removal of one or more fuel cell<br>
cartridges 14 may be desired for maintenance, replacement, etc. of the<br>
fuel cell cartridges 14. The remaining fuel cell cartridges 14 and<br>
internal fuel cells thereof may continue to supply power to an<br>
associated load 22 with one or more of the fuel cell cartridges 14<br>
deactivated.<br>
 Individual contacts 84 may be configured to maintain electrical<br>
continuity of bus 60 upon physical removal of a fuel cell cartridge 14<br>
from an associated subrack 76. As shown, individual contacts 84<br>
comprise make before break contacts which individually include plural<br>
conductive members configured to receive an associated contact 69 of<br>
 a fuel cell cartridge 14. Individual contacts 69 can comprise a tang or<br>
knife. Upon physical removal of fuel cell cartridge 14 and the<br>
corresponding terminals 69, conductive members of contacts 84 are<br>
mechanically coupled together to maintain a closed circuit within bus 60<br>
intermediate terminals 62, 63. Such maintains a supply of electrical<br>
 power to load 22 coupled with terminals 62, 63 during removal of one<br>
or more fuel cell cartridges 14 from fuel cell power system 10.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a schematic representation of four fuel<br>
cells 90 of a fuel cell cartridge 14 is shown. Individual fuel cells 90<br>
have plural contacts 84 as described above. Fuel cells 90 are typically<br>
coupled in series using power bus 60. Control system 30 is configured<br>
to monitor at least one electrical characteristic of individual fuel<br>
cells 90 using analysis circuitry 91 in the described embodiment.<br>
More specifically, analysis circuitry 91 includes a voltage sensor<br>
92 which may be provided electrically coupled with contacts 84 as<br>
shown. Such coupling enables voltage sensor 92 to monitor the voltages<br>
of the individual respective fuel cells 90. Fuel cells 90 have been<br>
observed to typically produce a useful voltage of about 0.45 to about<br>
0.7 volts DC under a typical load.<br>
An exemplary configuration of voltage sensor 92 is implemented<br>
as a differential amplifier for monitoring voltages. Voltage sensor 92<br>
is preferably configured to monitor voltage magnitude across individual<br>
fuel cells 90 as well as polarity of individual fuel cells 90.<br>
Analysis circuitry 91 can additionally include plural current<br>
sensors 94, 97. Individual current sensors may be coupled with<br>
contacts 84 of individual fuel cells 90 to monitor current flowing<br>
through respective individual fuel cells 90 in an alternative arrangement<br>
(not shown). Control system 30 is coupled with current sensors 94, 97<br>
and is configured to monitor corresponding respective currents through<br>
fuel cells 90 and outputted to load 22 via bus 60.<br>
Current sensor 94 is coupled intermediate one of fuel cells 90<br>
and a coupling with internal power supply 93. Current sensor 94 is<br>
coupled intermediate the coupling with internal power supply 93 and<br>
external terminal 62 coupled with an associated load.<br>
Following start-up operations, power for internal use within fuel<br>
cell power system 10 (e.g., power provided to the circuitry of control<br>
system 30) is provided from fuel cell cartridges 14. Internal power<br>
supply 93 extracts current from bus 60 as shown to provide internal<br>
power to fuel cell power system 10.<br>
Accordingly, current sensor 94 provides information regarding<br>
current flow through serially coupled fuel cell cartridges 14. Current<br>
sensor 97 provides information regarding current flow to a load coupled<br>
with terminal 62 (i.e., load 22 shown in Fig. 1).<br>
Plural switching devices 96 are also provided which correspond to<br>
respective fuel cells 90. Switching devices 96 can be individually<br>
provided intermediate contacts 84 of respective fuel cells 90 as<br>
illustrated. In the depicted configuration, switching devices 96 can<br>
comprise MOSFET devices. Gate electrodes of switching devices 96 are<br>
coupled with control system 30.<br>
Control system 30 is operable to selectively shunt electrodes 84<br>
using switching devices 96 corresponding to a desired one or more of<br>
fuel cells 90 to electrically bypass or deactivate such fuel cells 90. For<br>
example, if control system 30 observes that an electrical characteristic<br>
(e.g., voltage) of a fuel cell 90 as sensed via sensors 92, 94 is below<br>
a desired range, control system 30 can instruct a respective switching<br>
device 96 to turn on and shunt the respective fuel cell 90. In<br>
addition, individual fuel cells 90 can be selectively shunted using<br>
respective switching devices 96 to enhance the performance of fuel<br>
cells 90.<br>
In one configuration, fuel cells 90 can be shunted according to<br>
a duty cycle. The duty cycle may be adjusted by control system 30<br>
depending upon operation of fuel cell cartridges 14 and fuel cell power<br>
system 10. Fuel cells 90 can be shunted by sequential order as<br>
determined by control system 30. Shunting is also helpful during start-<br>
up operations to generate heat within housing 12 to bring fuel power<br>
system 10 up to operating temperature in an expedient manner.<br>
Alternatively, individual fuel cells 90 may be shunted for extended<br>
periods of time if control system 30 observes such fuel cells are<br>
operating below desired ranges (e.g., low voltage conditions, reverse<br>
polarity conditions). Shunting operations are discussed in co-pending<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/108,667, entitled Improved Fuel<br>
Cell and Method for Controlling Same", filed on July 1, 1998, naming<br>
William A. Fuglevand, Peter D. Devries, Greg A. Lloyd, David R. Lott,<br>
and John P. Scartozzi as inventors, assigned to the assignee hereof,<br>
having attorney docket number WA23-005, and incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, one configuration of control system 30 is<br>
illustrated. In the depicted arrangement, control system 30 includes a<br>
distributed control system including a plurality of controllers 100-120.<br>
Individual controllers 100-120 comprise programmable microcontrollers in<br>
the described embodiment. Exemplary microcontrollers have trade<br>
designation MC68HC705P6A available from Motorola, Inc. In the<br>
described embodiment, controllers 100-120 individually comprise a<br>
controller configured to execute instructions provided within executable<br>
code. In an alternative configuration, the steps described with reference<br>
to Figs. 16-28 below are implemented within hardware.<br>
Individual controllers can include random access memory (RAM),<br>
read only memory (ROM), analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, serial<br>
input/output port (SIOP) communications, timers, digital input/<br>
output (I/O), timer interrupts and external interrupts. Individual<br>
controllers 102-120 have internal digital processing circuitry configured<br>
to execute a set of software or firmware instructions. Such instructions<br>
can be stored within the internal read only memory of the respective<br>
controllers 100-120. Other configurations of control system 30 are<br>
possible.<br>
Among other functions, master controller 100 functions as a<br>
communication router to implement communications intermediate master<br>
controller 100 and individual slave controllers 102-120. In the described<br>
embodiment, communications are implemented in a limited full-duplex<br>
mode. Other communication protocols may be utilized.<br>
Master controller 100 outputs messages to slave<br>
controllers 102-120. Outputted messages are seen by all slave<br>
controllers 102-120. Individual slaves 102-120 identified by the outgoing<br>
message process the corresponding message. Thereafter, receiving slave<br>
controllers 102-120 can output a message to master controller 100. In<br>
addition, master controller 100 can sequentially poll slave<br>
controllers 102-120 to determine whether such slave controllers 102-120<br>
have communications for master controller 100. Master controller 100<br>
can also supply clock information to slave controllers 102-120 to<br>
establish a common timing reference within control system 30.<br>
Individual slave controllers 102-120 perform specific tasks in<br>
control system 30 including a plurality of distributed controllers.<br>
Individual slave controllers 102-120 can monitor specified functions of<br>
fuel cell power system 10 and report to master controller 100. Further,<br>
master controller 100 can direct operations of individual slave<br>
controllers 102-120.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, cartridge analysis slave controller 102 is<br>
coupled with master controller 100 and associated circuitry. In<br>
particular, cartridge analysis slave controller 102 is coupled with analysis<br>
circuitry 91 which is in turn coupled with fuel cells 90 and power<br>
bus 60 as previously described. Utilizing voltage sensor 92 and current<br>
sensor 94 of analysis circuitry 91, cartridge analysis slave controller 102<br>
can monitor electrical characteristics such as the voltage of individual<br>
fuel cells 90 as well as the current through fuel cells 90. Further,<br>
cartridge analysis slave controller 102 can monitor current flowing<br>
through power bus 60 to load 22 using current sensor 97 of analysis<br>
circuitry 91. As described below, cartridge analysis slave controller 102<br>
can communicate such electrical characteristics to master controller 100.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, auxiliary valve slave controller 104 is shown<br>
coupled with master controller 100 and auxiliary solenoids 44 and bleed<br>
solenoid 42. In turn, auxiliary solenoids 44 are coupled with auxiliary<br>
valves 45 and bleed solenoid 42 is coupled with bleed valve 43 as<br>
discussed above. Responsive to control communications from master<br>
controller 100, auxiliary valve slave controller 104 is configured to<br>
operate auxiliary solenoids 44 and bleed solenoid 42 to control auxiliary<br>
valves 45 and bleed valve 43, respectively.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, fan slave controller 106 is coupled with fan<br>
control circuitry 48 and fan monitor circuitry 49. As described above,<br>
fan control circuitry 48 and fan monitor circuitry 49 are individually<br>
coupled with fan 54. Upon receiving instruction from master<br>
controller 100, fan slave controller 106 is operable to control operation<br>
of fan 54 using fan control circuitry 48. For example, fan slave<br>
controller 106 controls on/off operational modes of fan 54 and the air<br>
flow rate of fan 54. Using fan monitor circuitry 49, fan slave<br>
controller 106 can monitor operation of fan 54. Fan slave<br>
controller 106 can output fan status information (e.g., RPM for a<br>
rotational fan) to master controller 100.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, interface slave controller 108 is coupled with<br>
master controller 100 and operator interface 16. Master controller 100<br>
supplies operational status information from other slave controllers to<br>
interface slave controller 108. Thereafter, interface slave controller 108<br>
can control operator interface 16 to convey such status information to<br>
an operator. Exemplary indications can include a light emitting<br>
diode (LED) array, bar graph display, audio warning buzzer, etc.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, external port slave controller 110 is coupled<br>
with communication port 36 and memory 37 as well as master<br>
controller 100. As described previously, communication port 36 is<br>
additionally coupled with a remote device 24. Communication port 36<br>
and memory 37 operate to provide bi-directional communications<br>
intermediate external port slave controller 110 and remote device 24.<br>
Although memory 37 is shown external of external port slave<br>
controller 110, in some configurations such memory 37 can be<br>
implemented as internal circuitry of external port slave controller 110.<br>
Memory 37 operates to buffer data passing to remote device 24<br>
or data received from remote device 24 within external port slave<br>
controller 110. External port slave controller 110 operates to forward<br>
received communications to master controller 100 according to timing<br>
of master controller 100. External port slave controller 110 operates<br>
to output messages from master controller 100 to remote device 24<br>
using communication port 36 according to an agreed-upon communication<br>
protocol intermediate external port slave controller 110 and remote<br>
device 24.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, system slave controller 112 is coupled with<br>
master controller 100 as well as main solenoid 46, charge circuitry 34,<br>
power supply sensors 31, current sensor 40 and element control<br>
circuitry 41. Responsive to control from master controller 100, system<br>
slave controller 112 is configured to control the operation of main<br>
valve 47 using main solenoid 46. Further, responsive to control from<br>
master controller 100, system slave controller 112 can selectively charge<br>
a battery 35 of power supply 30 using charge circuitry 34.<br>
Slave controller 112 can implement the charging of battery 35<br>
responsive to information from power supply sensors 31. Power supply<br>
sensors 31 provide electrical characteristic information of battery 35 and<br>
internal power sources 39 to system slave controller 112. Internal<br>
power sources 39 of power supply 32 include the 5 Volt DC source<br>
and +/- 12 Volt DC source previously described.<br>
Using current sensor 40, system slave controller 112 can monitor<br>
current flowing through power bus 60. Such provides load information<br>
and output power of fuel cell power system 10 to system slave<br>
controller 112. Thereafter, system slave controller 112 can provide such<br>
current and load information to master controller 100.<br>
System slave controller 112 is also coupled with element control<br>
circuitry 41 utilized to control modifying element 53. Such is utilized<br>
to control the temperature within plenum 51. Modifying element 53<br>
can be controlled to provide circulated air within plenum 51 within a<br>
desired operational temperature range. Modifying element 53 is<br>
advantageously utilized in some start-up situations to bring the<br>
temperature within plenum 51 within the operational range in an<br>
expedient manner.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, sensor slave controller 114 is coupled with<br>
master controller 100, heaters 74, 75, fuel detection circuitry 64 and<br>
temperature circuitry 67. Fuel detection circuitry 64 is associated with<br>
plural fuel sensors 58, 61 provided within housing 12 and plenum 51,<br>
respectively. Temperature circuitry 67 is coupled with temperature<br>
sensor 59 located outside of housing 12. Sensor slave 114 can control<br>
heaters 74, 75 to selectively bring fuel sensors 58, 61 within an<br>
appropriate temperature range for operation.<br>
Fuel detection circuitry 64 receives data from fuel sensors 58, 61<br>
and can condition such information for application to sensor slave<br>
controller 114. If fuel is detected using fuel sensors 58, 61, fuel<br>
detection circuitry 64 can process such information and provide such<br>
data to sensor slave controller 114. Such information can indicate the<br>
concentration of fuel detected within housing 12 or plenum 51 using<br>
fuel sensors 58, 61, respectively. Sensor slave controller 114 can in<br>
turn provide such information to master controller 100.<br>
Temperature sensor 59 provides information regarding the<br>
temperature of the surroundings of fuel cell power system 10.<br>
Temperature circuitry 67 receives outputted signals from temperature<br>
sensor 59 and can condition such signals for application to sensor slave<br>
controller 114 monitoring the external temperature. Sensor slave<br>
controller 114 can provide external temperature information to master<br>
controller 100.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13, air temperature slave controller 116 is<br>
coupled with master controller 100 and temperature circuitry 68 and<br>
passage control circuitry 57. Temperature circuitry 68 is associated with<br>
temperature sensor 55 provided within plenum 51. Passage control<br>
circuitry 57 operates to control air passage 56. For example, passage<br>
control circuitry 57 can control the position of vanes of air passage 56<br>
in an exemplary embodiment.<br>
Temperature sensor 55 is positioned within plenum 51 to monitor<br>
the temperature of circulated air within plenum 51. Temperature<br>
circuitry 68 receives the sensor information from temperature sensor 55<br>
and conditions the information for application to air temperature slave<br>
controller 116. Thereafter, air temperature slave controller 116 may<br>
operate to output the temperature information to master controller 100.<br>
During operation of fuel cell power system 10, air temperature<br>
slave controller 116 operates to control the flow of air into housing 12<br>
using air passage 56 as well as the exhaustion of air within plenum 51<br>
to the exterior of housing 12. Air temperature slave controller 116<br>
controls air passage 56 using passage control circuitry 57 to maintain<br>
the temperature of circulated air within plenum 51 within the desired<br>
operational temperature range. Further, modifying element 63 of<br>
Fig. 11 can be controlled as previously discussed to raise or lower the<br>
temperature of the circulated air. Such control of air passage 56 by<br>
air temperature slave controller 116 can be responsive to information<br>
from temperature sensor 55 and external temperature sensor 59.<br>
Further, efficiency information regarding fuel cells 90 can be calculated<br>
by air temperature slave controller 116 to determine waste thermal<br>
power. Air passage 56 may be controlled responsive to the calculated<br>
waste thermal power.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, shunt slave controller 118 is coupled with<br>
master controller 100 and switch control circuitry 95. Plural switching<br>
devices 96 are coupled with switch control circuitry 95. As described<br>
above, switching devices 96 are provided to implement selective shunting<br>
of respective fuel cells 90 of fuel cell cartridges 14. Master<br>
controller 100 can be configured to output shunt information to shunt<br>
slave controller 118 for selectively shunting using switching devices 96.<br>
Alternatively, shunt slave controller 118 can execute internally stored<br>
code to provide controlled selective shunting of switching devices 96.<br>
Such shunting operations of fuel cells 90 can be utilized to<br>
provide increased power, to expedite start-up procedures, to shunt a<br>
faulty fuel cell cartridge 14, and to monitor for fuel leaks in exemplary<br>
embodiments. Switch control circuitry 95 is provided to provide<br>
conditioning of control signals intermediate shunt slave controller 118<br>
and switching devices 96.<br>
Referring to Fig. 15, switch slave controller 120 is coupled with<br>
master controller 100 and switch control circuitry 33 and switch<br>
conditioning circuitry 19. Switch control circuitry 33 is coupled with<br>
switching device 38 provided in series with power bus 60. Responsive<br>
to master controller 100, switch slave controller 120 can instruct switch<br>
controller circuitry 33 to control switching device 38. Switching<br>
device 38 provides selective coupling of power bus 60 to an external<br>
load 22. Such can be utilized to assure proper operation of fuel cell<br>
power system 10 prior to coupling power bus 60 with load 22.<br>
Switch slave controller 120 can also monitor the status of<br>
operator interface switches 20 which may be set by an operator of fuel<br>
cell power system 10. Exemplary switches include power on/off of fuel<br>
cell power system 10, enable load, cartridge reset, etc. Switch<br>
conditioning circuitry 19 can filter signals provided from switches 20 and<br>
provide corresponding information regarding switch position to switch<br>
slave controller 120. Thereafter, switch slave controller 120 can output<br>
the switch status information to master controller 100.<br>
Referring to Figs. 16-16A, a flow chart illustrating exemplary<br>
operations of master controller 100 of control system 30 is shown.<br>
Initially, master controller 100 performs a communications check at<br>
step S10. Communication checks may be implemented on a periodic<br>
interrupt basis to verify communications of master controller 100 and<br>
slave controllers 102-120.<br>
At step S12, master controller 100 determines whether a<br>
communication error was discovered. If such an error is present,<br>
master controller 100 issues a shut down command to slave<br>
controllers 102-120 at step S14. Respective slave controllers 102-120<br>
implement shut down operations to bring fuel cell power system 10 into<br>
a shut down condition. Interface slave controller 108 can indicate the<br>
shut down status using operator interface 16. Further, master<br>
controller 100 can instruct external port slave controller 110 to notify<br>
remote device 24 of the shut down condition.<br>
Alternatively, if no communication error is present in step S12,<br>
master controller 100 instructs system slave controller 112 to open main<br>
valve 47 at step S16. In addition, master controller 100 instructs fan<br>
slave controller 106 to start fan 54 at step S16. At step S18, master<br>
controller 100 instructs auxiliary valve slave controller 104 to open<br>
auxiliary valves 45 using auxiliary solenoids 44. Next, master<br>
controller 100 issues a command to auxiliary valve slave controller 104<br>
to open bleed valve 43 using bleed solenoid 42 at step S20.<br>
Thereafter, master controller 100 may execute a start-up subroutine as<br>
set forth in Fig. 17 at step S22. Following successful execution of the<br>
start-up subroutine, master controller 100 outputs a load enable "ready"<br>
signal to switch slave controller 120 at step S24. Switch slave<br>
controller 120 controls, using switch control circuitry 33, switching<br>
device 38 to couple power bus 60 with an external load.<br>
At step S26 of Fig. 16A, master controller 100 extracts data from<br>
slave controllers 102-120. More specifically, master controller 100 can<br>
receive information from cartridge analysis slave controller 102, auxiliary<br>
valve slave controller 104, fan slave controller 106, external port slave<br>
controller 110, system slave controller 112, sensor slave controller 114,<br>
air temperature slave controller 116 and switch slave controller 120.<br>
Next, master controller 100 proceeds to step S28 where it is<br>
determined if a cartridge reset request has been issued. An operator<br>
can implement a cartridge reset condition using switches 20. If a<br>
cartridge reset is indicated, master controller 100 proceeds to step S30<br>
and issues an on-line command to change the status of all off-line fuel<br>
cell cartridges 14 to being on-line. Thereafter, master controller 100<br>
initiates a bleed cycle utilizing auxiliary valve slave controller 104 at<br>
step S32. During the bleed cycle, fuel may be applied to individual<br>
fuel cell cartridges 14 and the bleed valve 43 can be opened to allow<br>
exhaust operations using bleed manifold 65 and bleed exhaust 66.<br>
If no cartridge reset request is indicated at step S28, or after the<br>
bleed cycle is initiated at step S32, master controller 100 proceeds to<br>
step S34 to determine whether a communication error is present. If<br>
a communication error is present, master controller 100 issues a shut<br>
down command at step S36.<br>
If no communication error is present at step S34, master<br>
controller 100 proceeds to step S38 to execute an error subroutine as<br>
described in Figs. 18-18A below. At step S40, master controller 100<br>
calculates operating parameters utilizing the data obtained at step S26.<br>
Based upon the calculated operating parameters (e.g., setting of fan 54,<br>
modifying element 53, etc.), master controller 100 sends the. system<br>
settings at step S42 to the appropriate slave controllers 102-120.<br>
Referring to Fig. 17, a start-up subroutine executable by master<br>
controller 100 is described. Initially, data from sensor slave<br>
controller 114 is analyzed to determine whether the temperature within<br>
plenum 51 is less than 15 °Celsius. If yes, master controller 100 turns<br>
on modifying element 53 utilizing system slave controller 112 at<br>
step S52. Alternatively, master controller 100 instructs systems slave<br>
controller 112 to turn off modifying element 53 if appropriate at<br>
step S54.<br>
Thereafter, master controller 100 proceeds to step S56 and<br>
instructs shunt slave controller 118 to set a shunting duty cycle to<br>
maximum. At step S58, master controller 100 again retrieves the<br>
temperature within plenum 51 from air temperature slave controller 116.<br>
At step S58, master controller 100 determines whether the temperature<br>
within plenum 51 is less than 30 °Celsius. If so, master controller<br>
loops at step S58 until the temperature within plenum 51 is equal to<br>
or greater 30 °Celsius. Next, at step S60, master controller 100 can<br>
calculate a new duty cycle for application to shunt slave controllers 118.<br>
Thereafter, master controller 100 returns to the main set of instructions<br>
described in Fig.s 16-16A.<br>
Referring to Figs. 18-18A, a flow chart illustrating exemplary error<br>
operations of master controller 100 is illustrated. Initially, at step S62,<br>
master controller 100 determines whether fan operation is proper.<br>
Master controller 100 observes data from fan slave controller 106 and<br>
outputs a fan error message to interface slave controller 108 at<br>
step S64 if fan operation is not proper. Thereafter, a shut down<br>
command is issued at step S66 to initiate a shut down procedure of<br>
fuel cell power system 10.<br>
At step S68, it is determined whether internal power supplies are<br>
operating properly. More specifically, master controller 100 interfaces<br>
with system slave controller 112 to determine whether values monitored<br>
by power supply sensors 31 are within range. If not, master<br>
controller 100 sends a power supply error message to interface slave<br>
controller 108 at step S70. Thereafter, master controller 100 issues a<br>
shut down command at step S72.<br>
At step S74, master controller 100 determines whether auxiliary<br>
valve operation is proper. Such is determined by data received from<br>
auxiliary valve slave controller 104 regarding the status of auxiliary<br>
valves 45. This can be additionally performed by monitoring the<br>
voltage of a deactivated fuel cell 90. A zero voltage should result if<br>
auxiliary valve operation is proper. Master controller 100 outputs an<br>
auxiliary valve error message at step S76 to interface slave controller<br>
108 if operation is not proper. Such error message can thereafter be<br>
displayed using operator interface 16. At step S78, master<br>
controller 100 issues a shut down command.<br>
Alternatively, master controller 100 proceeds to step S80 and<br>
determines whether a major fuel leak is present. Such is determined<br>
by monitoring data received from sensor slave controller 114 responsive<br>
to the monitoring of fuel sensors 58, 61. If a major fuel leak is<br>
detected, master controller 100 sends a major fuel leak error message<br>
to interface slave controller 108 at step S82. Thereafter, a shut down<br>
command is issued at step S84.<br>
If no major fuel leak is determined, master controller 100<br>
proceeds to step S86 to determine whether a minor fuel leak is<br>
present. In one configuration, a major fuel leak may be defined as<br>
=5000 ppm and a minor fuel leak may be defined as 1000-4999 ppm.<br>
In some applications, the ranges may be varied for increased or<br>
decreased sensitivity to fuel.<br>
If a minor fuel leak is determined at step S86, master<br>
controller 100 proceeds to step S88 to try to determine if one of fuel<br>
cell cartridges 14 is faulty and the source of the fuel leak.<br>
Accordingly, a first fuel cell cartridge 14 is deactivated at step S88.<br>
Next, master controller 100 attempts to determine whether the fuel leak<br>
is gone. Deactivation of the fuel cell cartridge 14 ceases the supply<br>
of fuel to the fuel cell cartridge 14 using the appropriate auxiliary<br>
valve 45. If it is determined that the fuel leak is gone, an error<br>
message is sent at step S92 to interface slave controller 108 for<br>
conveyance to operator interface 16.<br>
If the fuel leak remains as determined at step S90, master<br>
controller 100 proceeds to step S94 to reactivate the previously<br>
deactivated fuel cell cartridge 14 and deactivate a subsequent fuel cell<br>
cartridge 14. At step S96, master controller 100 determines whether<br>
an index has led past the last fuel cell cartridge 14. If not, master<br>
controller 100 returns to steps S90-S94 to continue with the minor leak<br>
analysis. Alternatively, master controller 100 proceeds to step S98 and<br>
ignores the minor leak for a specified period of time. Once the<br>
specified period of time has elapsed, and the fuel leak is still present,<br>
master controller 100 can issue a shut down command which will cease<br>
the supply of fuel from fuel supply 23 into housing 12 using main<br>
valve 47.<br>
At step S100, master controller 100 determines whether there is<br>
a failed fuel cell cartridge 14. If so, master controller 100 shuts off<br>
the supply fuel to the failed fuel cell cartridge 14 using the appropriate<br>
auxiliary valve 45 at step S102. In addition, a full-time shunt command<br>
for the failed fuel cell cartridge 14 is applied to shunt slave<br>
controller 118 at step S104. At step S106, master controller 100 sends<br>
an error message to interface slave controller 108 for conveyance using<br>
operator interface 16.<br>
At step S108, master controller 100 determines whether enough<br>
fuel cell cartridges 14 are currently on-line. In one exemplary<br>
arrangement, master controller 100 determines whether less than eight<br>
fuel cell cartridges 14 are on-line. If not enough cartridges are on-line,<br>
master controller 100 sends an error command at step S110 to interface<br>
slave controller 108. Such error message can be conveyed to an<br>
operator using operator interface 16. Next, at step S112, master<br>
controller 100 issues a shut down command for fuel cell power<br>
system 10. If enough fuel cell cartridges 14 are on-line at step S108,<br>
master controller 100 proceeds to the main set of instructions defined<br>
in the flow chart of Figs. 16-16A.<br>
Referring to Figs. 19-19B, a flow chart illustrating exemplary<br>
operations of cartridge analysis slave controller 102 is shown. Initially,<br>
at step S120, slave controller 102 indexes to a first fuel cell 90 within<br>
fuel cell power system 10. A transient counter described below is<br>
cleared at step S121. Slave controller 102 obtains a voltage reading<br>
of the indexed fuel cell 90 at step S122. At step S124, slave<br>
controller 102 determines whether the polarity of the indexed fuel<br>
cell 90 is proper. If not, slave controller 102 proceeds to step S126<br>
and sets the indicated fuel cell voltage to zero. Thereafter, the voltage<br>
for the currently indexed fuel cell 90 is posted to a fuel cell array at<br>
step S134.<br>
Alternatively, if the polarity of the indexed fuel cell 90 is proper<br>
at step S124, slave controller 102 determines whether the voltage is<br>
proper at step S128. If not, slave controller 102 increments a ride-<br>
through transient counter at step S130. Thereafter, slave controller 102<br>
determines whether the transient counter is at a maximum value at<br>
step S132. If not, slave controller 102 returns to step S122. If the<br>
transient counter has reached a maximum value, slave controller 102<br>
proceeds to step S134 to post the voltage to the fuel cell array.<br>
At step S136, slave controller 102 determines whether all of the<br>
fuel cells 90 have been indexed. If not, slave controller 102 indexes<br>
to a next fuel cell 90 at step S138 and thereafter returns to step S122.<br>
If all fuel cells 90 have been analyzed using analysis circuitry 91, slave<br>
controller 102 proceeds to step S140 to arrange the fuel cell readings<br>
into readings for respective fuel cell cartridges 14.<br>
Next, slave controller 102 proceeds to step S141 to index to a<br>
first of fuel cell cartridges 14. Slave controller 102 then proceeds to<br>
step S142 to determine whether any of the fuel cell cartridges 14 were<br>
previously provided in a down or off-line condition. If so, slave<br>
controller 102 proceeds to step S160 to determine whether the last fuel<br>
cell cartridge 14 has been indexed. Otherwise, slave controller 102<br>
proceeds to step S144 to determine whether a voltage of any of the<br>
fuel cells of a currently indexed fuel cell cartridge 14 have an<br>
unacceptable voltage condition (e.g., low voltage). If so, slave<br>
controller 102 increments a low voltage counter at step S146. Next,<br>
slave controller 102 proceeds to step S148 to determine whether the<br>
low voltage counter is at a maximum value. The maximum value is<br>
selected to provide the unacceptable fuel cell with a chance to recover<br>
and provide an acceptable voltage during a subsequent pass through the<br>
flow chart. If the low voltage counter is at maximum, slave controller<br>
102 proceeds to step S150 to set the currently indexed fuel cell<br>
cartridge 14 status as deactivated (e.g., down or off-line). Slave<br>
controller 102 instructs master controller 100 to shut off fuel to the<br>
currently indexed fuel cell cartridge 14 at step S152. Master controller<br>
100 thereafter instructs auxiliary valve slave controller 104 to shut off<br>
fuel to the respective fuel cell cartridge 14. At step S154, master<br>
controller 100 additionally outputs a command to shunt slave controller<br>
118 to shunt the appropriate fuel cell cartridge 14. Also, master<br>
controller 100 can output the message to interface slave controller 108<br>
to convey the status of the currently indexed fuel cell cartridge 14<br>
using operator interface 16.<br>
If the currently indexed fuel cell cartridge 14 has a proper<br>
voltage as determined at step S144, slave controller 102 proceeds to<br>
step S145 to clear the low voltage counter. Slave controller 102<br>
associates the fuel cells with respective low voltage counter values. The<br>
low voltage counter for a given fuel cell previously determined to be<br>
unacceptable during the current pass through the flow chart is cleared<br>
at step S145 if the voltage is deemed acceptable at step S144.<br>
Slave controller 102 proceeds to step S156 to post high and low<br>
voltages of the fuel cells of the currently indexed fuel cell cartridge 14<br>
to memory. At step S158, slave controller 102 outputs the high and<br>
low voltage information of the fuel cells of the fuel cell cartridge 14<br>
to master controller 100. Master controller 100 processes the high and<br>
low voltages for the fuel cell cartridge 14 and can instruct interface<br>
slave controller 108 to display or otherwise convey the voltages to an<br>
operator using operator interface 16.<br>
At step S160, slave controller 102 determines whether the last<br>
fuel cell cartridge 14 has been indexed. If not, slave controller 102<br>
indexes to a next fuel cell cartridge 14 at step S162 and thereafter<br>
returns to step S142. If the last fuel cell cartridge 14 has been<br>
indexed at step S160, slave controller 102 proceeds to step S164 to<br>
determine whether too many fuel cell cartridges 14 are down (e.g., less<br>
than seven fuel cell cartridges 14 are down or off-line). If so, slave<br>
controller 102 sends an appropriate message to master controller 100<br>
at step S166.<br>
At step S168, slave controller 102 monitors for the reception of<br>
messages from master controller 100. If a message is received, slave<br>
controller 102 processes the incoming message at step S170. At<br>
step S172, slave controller 102 can transmit fuel cell data and any<br>
messages. Thereafter, slave controller 102 returns to step S120 to<br>
index the first fuel cell 90 to repeat the analysis.<br>
Referring to Figs. 20-20A, a flow chart illustrating exemplary<br>
operations of auxiliary valve slave controller 104 is shown. Initially,<br>
slave controller 104 performs a communication check at step S180 to<br>
assure proper communications with master controller 100. At step S182,<br>
slave controller 104 listens for a start-up signal from master<br>
controller 100. At step S184, it is determined whether the appropriate<br>
start-up signal has been received. Once the start-up signal is received,<br>
slave controller 104 instructs auxiliary solenoids 44 to open respective<br>
auxiliary valves 45 at step S186. At step S188, slave controller 104<br>
commences to perform a bleed procedure wherein slave controller 104<br>
instructs bleed solenoid 42 to open bleed valve 43 for a defined length<br>
of time.<br>
At step S190, slave controller 104 reads data and messages from<br>
master controller 100. Slave controller 104 determines whether the<br>
master is off-line at step S192. If so, slave controller 104 closes<br>
auxiliary valves 45 at step S194. Otherwise, slave controller 104<br>
proceeds to step S196 to determine whether a shut down request has<br>
been issued by master controller 100. If so, slave controller 104<br>
proceeds to step S194. Otherwise, slave controller 104 proceeds to<br>
step S198 to determine whether a change in status of any fuel cell<br>
cartridges 14 has been made. If so, slave controller 104 controls<br>
respective auxiliary valves 45 at step S200 to either supply fuel if the<br>
corresponding fuel cell cartridge 14 is on-line, or cease supply of fuel<br>
if the fuel cell cartridge 14 has been taken off-line.<br>
At step S202, slave controller 104 monitors to determine whether<br>
it is time for a bleed cycle. Slave controller 104 can be configured to<br>
periodically implement a bleed cycle using bleed solenoid 42 and bleed<br>
valve 43 according to a bleed timer. If it is time for a bleed cycle,<br>
slave controller 104 proceeds to step S204 to reset the bleed timer and<br>
thereafter commence a bleed procedure at step S206. As shown, slave<br>
controller 104 cycles back to step S190 to read any new data from<br>
master controller 100.<br>
Referring to Figs. 21-21A, a flow chart illustrating exemplary<br>
operations of fan slave controller 106 is illustrated. Slave<br>
controller 106 initially proceeds to step S210 and performs a<br>
communications check to verify proper communications with master<br>
controller 100. At step S212, slave controller 106 listens for an<br>
appropriate fan start-up signal from master controller 100.<br>
Once the appropriate start-up signal is received as determined at<br>
step S214, slave controller 106 proceeds to step S216 to start operation<br>
of fan 54 at a maximum air flow setting. Thereafter, slave<br>
controller 106 reads fan status information from fan monitoring<br>
circuitry 49 at step S218. At step S220, slave controller 106 determines<br>
whether fan 54 is operating properly. If not, slave controller 106 issues<br>
a shut down request to master controller 100 at step S222.<br>
Otherwise, slave controller 106 receives any updated fan setting<br>
from master controller 100 at step S224. At step S226, slave<br>
controller 106 can output appropriate signals to fan control circuitry 48<br>
to adjust the operation of fan 54. At step S228, slave controller 106<br>
determines whether a shut down command has been issued by master<br>
controller 100. If not, slave controller 106 returns to step S218 to<br>
read the status of fan 54. Otherwise, slave controller 106 proceeds to<br>
step S230 to shut off fan 54.<br>
Referring to Fig. 22, a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations<br>
of interface slave controller 108 is shown. Initially, slave controller 108<br>
proceeds to step S240 to perform a communications check with master<br>
controller 100. Thereafter, slave controller 108 outputs appropriate<br>
message information to operator interface 16 for conveyance to an<br>
operator. In the described embodiment, operator interface 16 displays<br>
the message information received from master controller 100.<br>
Slave controller 108 listens for updates to operator interface 16<br>
at step S244. At step S246, it is determined whether master<br>
controller 100 is off-line. If so, slave controller 108 sends an error<br>
message to operator interface 16 to indicate master controller 100 is<br>
off-line. Otherwise, slave controller 108 proceeds to step S250 to<br>
determine whether there was a change in the status of operator<br>
interface 16. If not, slave controller 108 proceeds to step S244 and<br>
listens for updates for operator interface 16. If a change in interface<br>
status is indicated at step S250, slave controller 108 proceeds to<br>
step S252 to update operator interface 16.<br>
Referring to Fig. 23, a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations<br>
of external port slave controller 110 is illustrated. Initially, slave<br>
controller 110 performs a communications check with master<br>
controller 100 at step S260. Thereafter, slave controller 100 reads any<br>
input communication from remote device 24 and communication port 36.<br>
At step S264, slave controller 110 sends any received communications<br>
to master controller 100. At step S266, slave controller 110 receives<br>
any communications from master controller 100. Slave controller 110<br>
proceeds to forward any communications to communication port 36 and<br>
remote device 24 at step S268.<br>
Referring to Figs. 24-24A, a flow chart illustrating exemplary<br>
operations of system slave controller 112 is shown. Initially, at<br>
step S270, slave controller 112 performs a communications check with<br>
master controller 100. Next, slave controller 112 can read status<br>
information from power supply sensors 31 and current sensor 40 at<br>
step S272. At step S274, it is determined by slave controller 112<br>
whether the inputted status values are within appropriate ranges. If<br>
not, slave controller 112 can generate an error message at step S276<br>
for application to master controller 100.<br>
Otherwise, slave controller 112 proceeds to step S278 and listens<br>
for a main valve open command from master controller 100. At<br>
step S280, it is determined whether the open valve command was<br>
received. Once the open valve command is received, slave<br>
controller 112 proceeds to step S282 to activate main valve 47 using<br>
main solenoid 46. At step S284, slave controller 112 listens for a shut<br>
down command from master controller 100.<br>
Proceeding to step S286, slave controller 112 determines whether<br>
the master controller 100 is off-line. If so, slave controller 112<br>
proceeds to step S296 to shut off power supply 32 and main valve 47<br>
using main solenoid 46. If master controller 100 is on-line, slave<br>
controller 112 proceeds to step S288 to again read status values from<br>
power supply sensors 31 and current sensor 40. Slave controller 112<br>
can control charge circuitry 34 to charge battery 35, if necessary, at<br>
step S290 responsive to the values read at step S288.<br>
At step S292, slave controller 112 determines whether the values<br>
are within the appropriate ranges. If not, slave controller 112 proceeds<br>
to step S294 to generate an error message for application to master<br>
controller 100. Otherwise, at step S296, slave controller 112 monitors<br>
for the presence of a shut down command or request from master<br>
controller 100. If no shut down command is issued, slave<br>
controller 112 returns to step S284. If a shut down request or<br>
command is received at step S296, slave controller 112 proceeds to<br>
step S296 to shut off main valve 47 using main solenoid 46 as well as<br>
turn off power supply 32.<br>
Referring to Fig. 25, a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations<br>
of sensor slave controller 114 is shown. Initially, at step S300, slave<br>
controller 114 performs a communication check with master<br>
controller 100. At step S302, slave controller 114 controls<br>
heaters 74, 75, if necessary, to bring associated fuel sensors 58, 61<br>
within proper operating temperature ranges. Thereafter, slave<br>
controller 114 is configured to read information from fuel detection<br>
circuitry 64 and corresponding fuel sensors 58, 61.<br>
Responsive to reading the fuel sensor values, slave controller 114<br>
determines at step S306 whether a major leak was detected. If so,<br>
slave controller 114 forwards an appropriate major leak message to<br>
master controller 100 at step S308. At step S310, the fuel sensor<br>
values are analyzed to determine whether a minor leak was detected.<br>
If so, slave controller 114 sends an appropriate minor leak message to<br>
master controller 100 at step S312.<br>
At step S314, slave controller 114 reads external temperature<br>
information from temperature circuitry 67 and associated temperature<br>
sensor 59. At step S316, slave controller 114 sends external<br>
temperature values to master controller 100.<br>
Referring to Fig. 26, a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations<br>
of air temperature slave controller 116 is shown. Initially, slave<br>
controller 116 performs a communication check with master<br>
controller 100 at step S320. Thereafter, slave controller 116 reads<br>
temperature values from temperature circuitry 68 and associated<br>
temperature sensor 55 located within air plenum 51. At step S324,<br>
slave controller 116 reads a temperature set point as calculated from<br>
master controller 100.<br>
At step S326, slave controller 116 sets recirculation using air<br>
passage 56 and fan 54 to maintain a set point temperature. Slave<br>
controller 116 outputs the air temperature of plenum 51 as determined<br>
by temperature sensor 55 to master controller 100 at step S328.<br>
Referring to Fig. 27, a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations<br>
of shunt slave controller 118 is shown. Initially, at step S330, slave<br>
controller 118 performs a communication check with master<br>
controller 100. At step S332, slave controller 118 reads data from<br>
master controller 100.<br>
At step S334, it is determined whether there was a change in<br>
status of the fuel cell cartridges 14. If so, slave controller 118<br>
proceeds to step S336 to determine whether there is a change of any<br>
of the fuel cell cartridges 14 to an off-line condition. If not, the<br>
appropriate switching device 96 for the respective fuel cell cartridge 14<br>
is latched to an off position at step S338. Alternatively, slave<br>
controller 118 proceeds to step S340 to latch the appropriate switching<br>
device 96 for the respective fuel cell cartridge 14 in an on position.<br>
Following processing of steps S338 or S340, or alternatively if<br>
there is no change in status of fuel cell cartridges 14 as determined at<br>
step S334, slave controller 118 proceeds to step S342 to cyclically shunt<br>
fuel cells 90 within fuel cell cartridges 14 as described in detail in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 09/108,667 incorporated by reference<br>
above.<br>
Referring to Fig. 28, a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations<br>
of switch slave controller 120 is shown. Slave controller 120 performs<br>
a communication check with master controller 100 at step S350.<br>
Thereafter, slave controller 120 reads switch status information from<br>
switches 20 and switch conditioning circuitry 19 at step S352. At<br>
step S354, slave controller 120 reads load enable status information<br>
from master controller 100.<br>
Slave controller 120 determines whether a power off request was<br>
received from master controller 100 at step S356. If yes, slave<br>
controller 120 proceeds to step S358 to send a shut dov/n message to<br>
master controller 100. Otherwise, slave controller 120 proceeds to<br>
step S360. Slave controller 120 determines whether a load enable<br>
request was provided from switches 20. If so, slave controller 120<br>
proceeds to step S362 to determine whether master controller 100 has<br>
indicated fuel cell power system 10 is ready to provide power as<br>
determined in step S354. If so, slave controller 120 proceeds to<br>
step S364 to enable switching device 38.<br>
At step S366, slave controller 120 determines whether the master<br>
controller 100 is in an off-line condition. If so, slave controller 120<br>
disables switching device 38 at step S368. Otherwise, slave<br>
controller 120 proceeds to step S370 to determine whether a cartridge<br>
reset has been indicated from switches 20. If so, slave controller 120<br>
proceeds to send a cartridge reset message to master controller 100 at<br>
step S372. Slave controller 120 then returns to step S352 to read<br>
switch status from switch conditioning circuitry 19 and associated<br>
switches 20 at step S352.<br>
