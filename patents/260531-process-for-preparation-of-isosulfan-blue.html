TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of isosulfan blue, and<br>
in particular, to a process for the production of isosulfan blue in a substantially pure form.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Isosulfan blue, having a chemical name, N-[4-[[4-(diethyl amino) phenyl] (2, 5-<br>
disulfophenyl) methylene]-2, 5-cyclohexadien-l-ylidene]-N-ethylethanaminium, sodium<br>
salt and the formula<br><br>
is a triarylmethane dye used as a contrast agent for the delineation of lymphatic vessels<br>
and is particularly useful as a cancer diagnostic agent. Also known chemically as sulfan<br>
blue or patent blue, isosulfan blue is an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the<br>
Lymphazurin™ blue dye pharmaceutical dosage form, available as 1% (10mg/ml) 5ml<br>
solution in phosphate buffer for injection. It is commonly used in a procedure called<br>
"mapping of the sentinel lymph nodes". It is an adjunct to lymphography for visualization<br>
of the lymphatic system draining the region of injection. It has been used with increasing<br>
frequency in localizing sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Isosulfan blue-<br>
guided surgical removal of cancerous tissue has been on the rise as it is cost effective and<br>
safer to use than technetium 99M radioisotope-labeled sulfur colloid.<br>
Isosulfan blue is a structural isomer of sulphan blue; both belong to the family of<br>
triarylmethane dyestuffs. Generally, preparation of triarylmethane dyes involves<br>
condensation of suitably substituted aryl aldehydes with 2 equivalents of alkyl-aryl amines<br>
giving rise to leuco-bases or leuco-acids followed by oxidation. Although the literature is<br>
replete with methods of preparing triarylmethane dyes, most of the methods involve strong<br><br>
acids for condensation resulting in leuco-bases or leuco-acids, hazardous oxidizing agents<br>
(lead oxide, chloranil, iron phthalocyanine/oxone) for converting to triarylmethane dyes,<br>
and crude methods (precipitation with sodium sulfate) of purification. See for example<br>
United States Patent Nos. 4,330,476, 4,710,322, 1,531,507, 5,659,053, 1,805,925,<br>
2,422,445, 1,878,530 and 2,726,252. Prior art methods of isolation of the crude leuco-<br>
acids or leuco-bases involve tedious neutralization/basification with strong bases and<br>
typically using the reaction mixtures in the oxidation step, giving rise to crude<br>
triarylmethane dyes. The triarylmethane dyestuffs thus prepared are used mainly for<br>
dyeing fabric, coloring paper, and printing inks. The literature cites utilization of the same<br>
aforementioned synthetic and isolation methods for the preparation of diagnostically<br>
important dyes, such as isosulfan blue, sulphan blue and patent blue V. See, Rodd's<br>
Chemistry of Carbon Compounds by S. Coffey, 1974 2nd Edition, Volume III Part F, 110-<br>
133.<br>
Therefore there is a need in the art for an improved method in the process<br>
chemistry of isosulfan blue to be prepared in the purest form which is suitable for large<br>
scale cGMP production for its pharmaceutical formulation manufacturing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention is to provide a simple, safe, cost-<br>
effective, time saving and reliable process for the preparation of isosulfan blue in bulk<br>
scale and in substantially pure form. "Substantially pure" is defined herein as 99.0% or<br>
greater.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a simple, cost-effective and reliable<br>
process for preparation of the intermediate, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid, sodium<br>
salt of formula (2), required in the preparation of isosulfan blue. This embodiment<br>
provides a process step that does not require tedious neutralization with very large<br>
quantities of sodium carbonate and effervescence, as is the case in prior art processes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a simplified procedure for the<br>
isolation of benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, di-sodium salt of the formula (3) that does<br>
not include acidifying the reaction mixture with concentrated sulfuric acid and boiling<br>
until excess sulfurous acid is expelled, as is taught in the prior art.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a procedure for obtaining the<br>
benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, sodium salt of formula (3) free of inorganic salts,<br><br>
which essentially simplifies the isolation procedures to be implemented during isolation of<br>
isoleuco acid.<br>
Yet another, object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of an<br>
isoleuco acid of formula (4), through the urea derivative as an in-situ intermediate. The<br>
isoleuco acid of formula (4) on further oxidation gives rise to the target compound,<br>
isosulfan blue (5). Still another object of the invention is to use very mild oxidation agent<br>
to avoid any over oxidized products and also to improve the stability of the isosulfan blue<br>
under reaction conditions.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a simple procedure for the isolation<br>
of benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, isoleuco acid and isosulfan blue at acid stage and<br>
also at sodium salt formation stage by incorporating crystallization techniques, thereby<br>
avoiding distillation and other techniques using high temperatures which jeopardize the<br>
compound stability during the manufacturing process.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation, specific numbers,<br>
materials and configurations are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of<br>
the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one having ordinary skill in the art that the<br>
invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known<br>
features may be omitted or simplified so as not to obscure the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, reference in the specification to phrases such as "one embodiment" or "an<br>
embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in<br>
connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.<br>
The appearances of phrases such as "in one embodiment" in various places in the<br>
specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment the present invention relates to a process for<br>
the preparation of isosulfan blue.<br>
Scheme<br>
The following provides a process for the production of isosulfan blue of formula<br>
(5):<br><br><br>
Experimental Procedures<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a first step involves<br>
sulfonation of the commercially available starting material of the formula (1) to 2-<br>
chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid sodium salt of the formula (2).<br><br><br>
In one example, the sulfonation process involved reacting one equivalent of the 2-<br>
chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (1) with 2.0 equivalents of 20% fuming sulfuric acid at 15<br>
C to 70 °C for 16hrs. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-water carefully followed<br>
by stirring with solid sodium chloride resulting in a cream colored precipitate, which upon<br>
filtration, washing with ether and drying afforded 2-chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid of<br>
the formula (2) in 86% yield.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a second step of the<br>
process involves nucleophilic displacement of the chloride in 2-chlorobenzaldehyde-5-<br>
sulfonic acid sodium salt of the formula (2) with an alkali metal sulfite/bisulfite such as<br>
sodium sulfite/sodium bisulfite at elevated temperatures under closed conditions.<br>
In one example, this reaction was carried out in a Parr pressure vessel equipped<br>
with overhead magnetic stirring. 2-Chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid (2), sodium sulfite<br>
(2.29 equivalents), sodium bisulfite (10% of sodium sulfite), and water (3.45 mL/g) were<br>
charged into the Parr pressure vessel. The reaction mixture in the vessel was stirred and<br>
heated at 170-180 °C for 5-7 hours generating 140-150 psi pressure.<br>
The reaction mixture, after cooling, was poured into methanol while stirring, so as<br>
to make 20% aqueous content of the whole volume. This process ensured total<br>
precipitation of the inorganic salts, which could be removed by filtration. The solvent<br>
from the filtrate was removed under reduced pressure to obtain a solid residue, which was<br>
triturated with methanol and filtered to afford light yellow colored compound,<br>
benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, di sodium salt of the formula (3) in 93.9% yield.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment a purification procedure for removing the<br>
inorganic salts essentially involves dissolving the crude solid in N, N dimethylformamide<br>
and stirring the contents for 1 -2 hours at ambient temperature followed by filtration. The<br>
filtrate is precipitated by dichloromethane to afford the light yellow colored compound,<br>
benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid disodium salt of formula (3) with chromatographic<br>
purity NLT 99.0% and with HPLC assay greater than 90% w/w.<br><br><br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a third step of the<br>
process involved condensing benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, disodium salt of the<br>
formula (3) with N, N-diethylaniline to provide isoleuco acid of the formula (4).<br><br>
In one example, pure isoleuco-acid of the formula (4) with chromatographic purity<br>
greater than 98.0% was obtained in the solid form out of the reaction mixture. A mixture<br>
of benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, disodium salt of the formula (3), N, N-diethylaniline<br>
(2.2 equivalents), and urea (0.75 equivalents) in glacial acetic acid was stirred and<br>
refluxed for 20-25 hrs. The reaction progressed through the intermediate formation in-situ<br>
which is a urea derivative of benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid disodium salt. To the<br>
above cooled reaction mixture after 20-25hrs reflux, methanol was added to form a<br>
precipitate, which was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with diethyl ether to<br>
afford the isoleuco acid of the formula (4) in 56.8 % yield.<br>
The purification of isoleuco acid was carried out by dissolving the crude solid in 5<br>
volumes of water and stirred for 1-2 hours at ambient temperature and filtering the solid.<br>
The above process was repeated twice before the final solid was washed with acetone to<br>
generate isoleuco acid of the formula (4) with chromatographic purity greater than 99.5%.<br><br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a fourth step of the<br>
process involves conversion of the isoleuco acid (4) to isosulfan blue of the formula (5)<br>
under conditions that employ milder oxidizing agents with no strong acidic reagents and<br>
are less hazardous than the prior art.<br><br>
In an example of the present inventive process, a suspension of isoleuco acid of the<br>
formula (4) in methanol was stirred at room temperature for 12-14hrs with silver oxide<br>
(2.5 equivalents). The blue colored reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of silica<br>
gel and Celite followed by filtration through an acidic zeolite bed and further through a 0.2<br>
micron membrane filtration unit. The filtrate was then precipitated with isopropyl ether at<br>
room temperature to obtain crude isosulfan blue acid.<br>
The isosulfan blue acid thus obtained was then purified by recrystallization from<br>
aqueous isopropyl alcohol/ acetone to afford isosulfan blue acid of chromatographic purity<br>
NLT 99.5% performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography.<br>
The final product of isosulfan blue sodium (formula 5) was obtained when<br>
isosulfan blue acid was adjusted to a pH greater than 6.0 in aqueous acetone medium using<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution for pH adjustment. The reaction mass was filtered to give<br>
isosulfan blue sodium of formula (5) having purity greater than 99.5% by HPLC and also<br>
free of silver with silver content estimated by Atomic absorption spectrometer less than<br>
20ppm.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
2-Chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid, sodium salt of the formula (2).<br><br>
113.82 g (based on SO3 molecular weight, 569 mL) of 20 % fuming sulfuric acid<br>
(FSA) was charged into a 1 L three-neck flask fitted with a dropping funnel, overhead<br>
stirrer, and thermometer. The reaction mass was cooled to 15 to 20°C. 100 g of 2-<br>
chlorobenzaldehyde of the formula (1) was added drop-wise to the stirred and cooled FSA<br>
over a period of 40 minutes, so that the temperature didn't rise above 20°C. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred and heated at 70°C for 16 hours to obtain a dark-brown colored<br>
reaction solution. The HPLC results indicated the absence of the starting material. The<br>
dark-brown colored reaction solution was carefully poured into a beaker containing 1200 g<br>
of crushed ice and stirred. 500 g of solid sodium chloride was added portion wise to the<br>
stirred colored acidic solution to precipitate a light-yellow colored solid. The light-yellow<br>
colored solid was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with diethyl ether to afford<br>
150.0 g (86.92%) of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid, sodium salt of the formula (2).<br>
Benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, sodium salt of the formula (3).<br>
50 g (0.206 mol) of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde-5-sulfonic acid, sodium salt of the<br>
formula (2), 59.75 g (0.474 mol, 2.3 eq.) of Na2SO3 and 5.97 g (10% of Na2SO3) of<br>
NaHSO3 were dissolved in 400 mL of water. The solution was charged into a 600 mL<br>
capacity Parr pressure cylinder equipped with stirring and heating. The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred (300-310 RPM) and heated at 180 °C (generates ~150 psi pressure) for 5-<br>
7hours. HPLC results indicate the absence of the starting material. After cooling and<br>
releasing the pressure, the reaction mixture was poured into 1600 mL of stirred methanol<br>
and stirred for 15-30 minutes to precipitate the unwanted inorganic salts. The inorganic<br>
salts were filtered off using a pad of Celite and the filtrate evaporated under reduced<br>
pressure to obtain a solid residue. The solid residue obtained was triturated with 200 mL<br>
methanol, collected by filtration and washed with ether to give 60 g (93.9%) of<br>
benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, sodium salt of formula (3).<br>
Purification of Benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, sodium salt formula (3)<br>
60 g of crude benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid, disodium salt prepared as per the<br>
procedure above was dissolved in 500 mL of N, N-dimethylformamide and stirred for 2<br>
hours at 20-25°C. The mixture was filtered through a buchner funnel and the filtrate was<br>
precipitated using 1500 mL of dichloromethane to afford 20g of the light yellow colored<br><br>
compound, benzaldehyde-2, 5-disulfonic acid disodium salt of formula (3) with<br>
chromatographic purity NLT 99.0% w/w.<br>
Isoleuco acid of the formula (4).<br>
60 g of benzaldehyde-2,5-disulfonic acid sodium salt of formula (3), 8.76 g of urea<br>
(0.75 eq), and 1000 mL of glacial acetic acid were charged into a 3L 3-neck flask fitted<br>
with a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser. 65.61 mL (2.2 eq) of N, N-diethyl aniline<br>
was added to the stirred mixture and refluxed for 20-25 hrs. When the HPLC results<br>
indicated the content of starting material was less than 5%, the reaction mass was cooled<br>
to room temperature. After cooling to room temperature, 600 mL of methanol was added<br>
and the separated solid collected on a sintered funnel by vacuum filtration. The collected<br>
solid was washed with methanol to obtain 55-60 g (56.8%) of crude isoleuco acid of the<br>
formula (4).<br>
Purification of isoleuco acid of formula (4)<br>
50 g of crude isoleuco acid along with 250ml of water was charged into a 1L 3-<br>
neck round bottom flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer. The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
for 1 hour at 20-25°C. The solid was filtered through a buchner funnel.<br>
The above process was repeated twice. The final product thus obtained was then<br>
washed with 25ml of acetone and then dried to obtain 40-45 g of the desired isoleuco acid<br>
of formula (4).<br>
Isosulfan blue of the formula (5)<br>
15 g (0.027 mol) of isoleuco acid of the formula (4) and 225 mL of Methanol were<br>
charged into a 1L round bottomed flask and the suspension was stirred. To the stirred<br>
suspension, 15.91 g (0.068 mol, 2.5 eq.) of silver oxide was added in one portion at room<br>
temperature and stirred at room temperature for 12-14hours. The reaction mixture turned<br>
blue in color as the oxidation to the desired product progressed. The HPLC results<br>
indicated the absence of starting material. The blue colored reaction mixture was filtered<br>
through a buchner funnel and the solid silver oxide collected was taken into the reaction<br>
flask and the filtrate was kept aside. 225ml of methanol was added to the silver oxide<br>
taken in the reaction flask and stirred at 20-25°C for 30 minutes and filtered through the<br><br>
buchner funnel. This silver oxide washing procedure with methanol was carried out twice<br>
more.<br>
The combined filtrates along with the initial filtrate were then filtered through a<br>
bed of silica gel / celite (2 inch silica gel/1 inch of celite) and finally the bed was washed<br>
with 50mL of methanol.<br>
The filtrate was then subjected to a filtration through an acidic zeolite bed of 2 inch<br>
height (pH of the zeolite bed was adjusted to acidic pH by using 0.1N hydrochloric acid<br>
aqueous solution) followed by filtration through a 0.2 micron filtration unit.<br>
Isopropyl ether was added three times the volume of the filtrate and the isosulfan<br>
blue acid was precipitated as a solid at about 10gram (68.8%) yield.<br>
In order to prepare the Isosulfan blue sodium salt of the formula (5), 10.0 g of the<br>
solid obtained above was dissolved in 30 mL deionized water. Saturated sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution was added drop wise to adjust the pH to 8.0. To this 300 mL of<br>
acetone was added and stirred at 20-25°C for 30 minutes. The crystallized product was<br>
then filtered through a buchner funnel and the solid thus obtained was dried at 40°C under<br>
vacuum to obtain the isosulfan blue sodium salt of formula (5).<br>
While the preferred embodiments have been described and illustrated it will be<br>
understood that changes in details and obvious undisclosed variations might be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and principle of the invention and therefore the scope of<br>
the invention is not to be construed as limited to the preferred embodiment.<br><br>
