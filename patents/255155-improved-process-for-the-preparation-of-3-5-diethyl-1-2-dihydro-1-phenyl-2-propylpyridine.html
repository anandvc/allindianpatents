IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF<br>
3,5-DIETHYL-l,2-DIHYDRO-l-PHENYL-2-PROPYLPYRIDINE<br>
PRIORITY<br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application Nos.<br>
60/651,706 and 60/651,711, entitled Improved Process for the Production of 3,5-Diethyl-l,2-<br>
Dihydro-l-Phenyl-2-Propylpyridine, both filed February 10, 2005, and incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present application relates generally to the production of amine-aldehyde<br>
condensation products, illustratively 3,5-diethyl-l,2-dihydro-l-phenyl-2-propylpyridine, and<br>
methods for improving production.<br>
2.	Description of Related Technology<br>
Reactive fluid compositions, otherwise known as tough acrylic adhesive compositions or<br>
second generation acrylics, are well known adhesive systems. Typically, these are two-part<br>
systems that offer the advantages of rapid cure, high strength, and good shelf life.<br>
The first part of these adhesive compositions generally is a polymer-in-monomer<br>
solution. Typically, this first part includes and vinyl or acrylic monomers such as methyl<br>
methacrylate, and chlorosulfonated polyethylene. Chlorosulfonated polyethylene is a reaction<br>
product of a linear or branched polyethylene and sulfonyl chloride. One example of<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-2-<br>
chlorosulfonated polyethylene is HYPALON™ (E. I. DuPont De Nemours' &amp; Co.). Illustrative<br>
polymer-in monomer solutions are disclosed in U.S. Patent. Nos. 3,890,407, 3,962,372,<br>
4,106,971 and 4,112,013, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The second main component of the adhesive compositions is usually a mixture or<br>
solution of activators, promoters, initiators, and free radical generators, all of which are<br>
discussed in the above-mentioned patents, already incorporated by reference. Examples of<br>
typical prior art free radical generators include organic peroxides, hydroperoxides, peresters,<br>
persalts, and peracids. Illustrative initiators include amines, such as N,N-dimethylaniline, and<br>
illustrative promoters include transition metals such as manganese or nickel.<br>
Amine-aldehyde condensation products are often employed as the activator. Typically,<br>
these activators are the products of the reaction between an aliphatic aldehyde (usually C1-12) and<br>
an aromatic amine. U.S. Patent No. 3,890,407 lists illustrative amines and aldehydes useful as<br>
condensation reactants. One commonly used activator is the condensation product of the<br>
reaction between butyraldehyde and aniline. Commercial sources of the butyraldehyde aniline<br>
condensation product include DuPont 808 (E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co.), VANAX® 808<br>
(RT Vanderbilt Company), Vulkacit 576 (Bayer Corp.), Accelerator 40B (Akrochem Corp.), and<br>
NOCCELER 8 (Ocuchishiko Chemical). It is understood that the term "activator" is commonly<br>
used interchangeably with the terms "accelerator" and "primer."<br>
It is known that 3,5-diethyl-l,2-dihydro-l-phenyl-2-propylpyridine (DHP) is the main<br>
active ingredient resulting from the condensation reaction of butyraldehyde and aniline.<br>
However, the condensation reaction is not a simple addition reaction. Rather, a variety of side<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-3-<br>
reactions occur, with a variety of resulting products. Many such side reactions are discussed in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 1,780,334, 1,908,093 and 2,704,750, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The first known preparation of DHP was reported in Craig, JACS, Vol. 70, pp, 1624-<br>
1629 (1948), herein incorporated by reference. The Craig reference misidentified the compound<br>
as N-phenyl-3,5-diethyl-2-propyl-l,4-dihydropyridine, but DHP has subsequently been shown to<br>
be the principle component of the reaction mixture. As many of the components of the crude<br>
mixture were then unknown, the crude DHP mixture has become known as "butyraldehyde<br>
aniline condensation product." There has been surprisingly little information on improvements<br>
in the preparation of DHP since the original 1948 publication. Instead, various efforts have<br>
focused on distilling DHP from the other components of butyraldehyde aniline condensation<br>
product. See U.S. Patent No 4,450,050. A commercially available purified DHP, PDHP™<br>
Adhesive Activator (Reilly Industries, Inc.) comprises 85% or more DHP and is produced from<br>
purifying a crude butyraldehyde aniline condensation mixture.<br>
One disadvantage to many present adhesive systems that use aldehyde-amine<br>
condensation products as surface activators is that the adhesive compositions do not readily<br>
adhere to the oily surface of the activator. The adhesive tends to slip or "skate" along the surface<br>
of the activator and to flow off the bond area prior to assembly. This "skating" of the adhesive<br>
off the activated surface is believed to be caused by a variety of substances that prevent proper<br>
wetting and interaction of the adhesive with the surface to be bonded. Due to the nature of the<br>
condensation reaction used to make amine-aldehyde activators, many other compounds are<br>
formed that do not enhance the activator's ability to function as an accelerator and contribute to<br>
the polymerizable portion (polymer-in-monomer part) of the adhesive composition sliding off<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-4-<br>
the surface of an activator-coated part. The result is poor wetting of the surface by the adhesive,<br>
resulting in low bond strength. Additionally, many of these noncontributing products impart an<br>
obnoxious odor and a brown staining color that can require ventilation and precautionary<br>
handling measures and can cause aesthetic imperfections in the surfaces to be bonded. The<br>
polymerizable portion of the adhesive composition is generally a clear, viscous material, but<br>
when in contact with the activated surface takes on the brown dirty color of the activator.<br>
While highly purified DHP is desirable, purification can be costly, and highly purified<br>
DHP is significantly more expensive than its crude counterpart products. Yet materials such as<br>
VANAX® 808, Vulkacit 576, Accelerator 40B, and NOCCELER 8 contain about 40% or less<br>
DHP. Condensation methods that result in a product having a greater percentage DHP are<br>
desired. Also desired are condensation products that can be purified more readily. More<br>
consistent activity can be achieved by higher DHP concentrations and by a reduction in the<br>
number and concentration of byproduct impurities that can interfere with the polymerization<br>
process. It is also desirable to reduce the levels of impurities that are considered to be hazardous<br>
(toxic, flammable, corrosive, etc.).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to methods for improving production of<br>
3,5-diethyl-l,2-dihydro-l-phenyl-2-propylpyridine (DHP). In one aspect of the invention,<br>
improved yields of DHP are obtained by controlling the rate of reaction and temperature while in<br>
the presence of the acid catalyst. The rate of reaction is controlled by allowing the reaction to<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-5-<br>
proceed at a lower temperature for a period of time prior to raising the temperature to a higher<br>
reaction temperature. In one illustrative example, the reaction mixture is heated slowly to 40-45<br>
°C and held for one hour prior to heating to 75 °C for five hours, and only then heated to reflux.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, improvement in DHP production is obtained by<br>
neutralizing the acid catalyst subsequent to DHP formation. Illustratively, prior to distillation the<br>
acid catalyst is neutralized using sodium carbonate, but other bases may be used as well. By<br>
neutralizing the acid catalyst, decomposition of DHP is minimized when the reaction is heated<br>
for distillation of the DHP.<br>
Another aspect of the present application is directed to methods for preparing 3,5-diethyl-<br>
l,2-dihydro-l-phenyl-2-propylpyridine (DHP) in improved yields. In one aspect of the<br>
invention, the traditional order of reagent addition is altered. In this aspect, aniline is first added<br>
to the butyraldehyde, and then the acid catalyst is added subsequently.<br>
Combinations of these methods are also within the scope of this application.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the subject matter of this application will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the<br>
appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
3,5-Diethyl-l,2-dihydro-l-phenyl-2-propylpyridine (DHP) has the following structure:<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-6-<br><br>
Methods for the production of DHP can be found in the Craig reference discussed above, which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference. Changes in these methods, as discussed herein, have<br>
resulted in improved yields of DHP and improved recovery of DHP in subsequent purification.<br>
In Example I below, DHP is produced by methods consistent with the teaching of the<br>
Craig reference. Two main changes were made between Example I and Example II. The first<br>
main change involves controlling the temperature of the mixture while in the presence of the acid<br>
catalyst. In each of the examples, the mixture was created at 20-25 °C, stirred for an hour at this<br>
temperature, and then subsequently heated. In Example I, the mixture was heated to 75 °C, held<br>
for two hours and subsequently heated to reflux (about 90°C) for five hours. In Example II, the<br>
mixture is heated slowly to 40 °C, held for one hour, heated to 75 °C for five hours, and<br>
subsequently heated to reflux. In Example III, it has been found that heating to a reaction<br>
temperature of 75 °C prior to heating to reflux allows for easier recovery of DHP during<br>
subsequent purification. Further, it has been found that holding the mixture at a lower<br>
temperature for a period of time prior to heating to 75 °C improves yield of DHP. Illustratively,<br>
that period of time is at least 15 minutes, illustratively at least 30 minutes. In the examples, a<br>
hold of approximately one hour provided for improved yield. Illustratively, this hold is at a<br>
temperature of no more than 50 °C, illustratively 40-45 °C.<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-7-<br>
The second change involves the addition of a base, illustratively sodium carbonate, prior<br>
to distillation. The base neutralizes the acetic acid, thereby reducing degradation of the DHP<br>
while at the high distillation temperatures, and leading to better yield. While sodium carbonate<br>
is used in Examples II and III, other bases may be used, including but not limited to sodium or<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium bicarbonate, and sodium or potassium hydroxide.<br>
The following chemicals were used in the following examples:<br>
Acetic acid, Fisher Chemical, glacial, 99.9%<br>
Aniline, Acros Chemical, ACS reagent grade<br>
Butyraldehyde, Acros Chemical, 99%<br>
Sodium carbonate, Aldrich Chemical, 99.5%<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-8-<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
DHP was prepared using methods consistent with the methods in the literature. A 1000<br>
mL four neck flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer,<br>
and an addition funnel. An ice-water bath was used to cool the flask as needed. The flask was<br>
charged with 86 g de-ionized water, 9.8 g (0.16 mole) acetic acid, and 216 g (3.0 mol)<br>
butyraldehyde. With cooling and stirring, 60 g (0.64 mole) aniline was added over a 35-minute<br>
period while maintaining the reaction temperature at 20°C. The reaction mixture was stirred for<br>
one hour at less than 25°C. The reaction mixture was then heated to 75°C and held for two<br>
hours. Finally, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux (~90°C) and was held for five hours.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled and the layers were separated. The top, organic layer was<br>
distilled through a 14" packed column under reduced pressure. The fraction taken at a head<br>
temperature of 140-143°C and.5 mm Hg pressure weighed 104 grams and was analyzed to<br>
contain 73% DHP for an overall yield of 46%.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
A 1000 mL flask was equipped in the same matter as above. With stirring and cooling,<br>
the flask was charged with 433 grams (6.0 mole) butyraldehyde, 120 grams (1.3 mole) aniline,<br>
and 9.8 grams acetic acid (0.16 mole). The mixture was maintained at 20-25°C as each reactant<br>
was added, after which the reaction temperature slowly increased to 40°C. The reaction mixture<br>
was allowed to stir for one hour at 40°C then heated to 75°C and held for five hours. A solution<br>
of 10% aqueous sodium carbonate (100 mL) was added to the flask and the reaction mixture was<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-9-<br>
heated to reflux and held for additional five hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and the<br>
layers were separated. The top, organic layer was distilled through a 14" packed column under<br>
reduced pressure. The product cut was taken at a head temperature of 140-143°C and 4 mm Hg<br>
pressure weighed 219 grams was analyzed to contain 89% DHP, which translates to an overall<br>
chemical yield of 59%.<br>
EXAMPLE III<br>
Several parameters were changed between Example I and Example II. To isolate the<br>
effects of each parameter, a series of runs was made wherein in each run only one parameter was<br>
changed. As shown in Table 1, runs were made to compare the reaction temperature after<br>
completion of the addition of the reactants and the effect of neutralizing the reaction mixture<br>
prior to refluxing. All reported yields are based on the weight of the recovered top layer from<br>
the reaction mixtures and a gas chromatograph (GC) analysis of the top layer. Thus, these are<br>
chemical yields of DHP made and not isolated recovered yields.<br><br>

Runs 1, 2, and 3 are a comparison of reaction temperature after the addition of the<br>
reactants. In run 1 the reaction was immediately heated to reflux, in run 2 the reaction was<br>
 immediately heated to 75 °C, and in run 3 the reaction was held at 
heating to 75°C. No difference in chemical yield was seen between runs 1 and 2. However,<br>
subsequent recovery of DHP from the crude mixture was greater with DHP prepared according<br>
to run 2 (data not shown), perhaps due to a decrease in the production of other compounds that<br>
make purification more difficult. In run 3, an improvement in the chemical yield of DHP was<br>
 seen in addition to the improvement in recovery during subsequent purification. Thus, it has<br>
been found that holding the reaction mixture at a lower temperature for a period of time is<br><br>
1<br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-11-<br>
beneficial to formation and purification of DHP. Without being bound to any particular theory,<br>
it is thought that the lower temperature may suppress the formation of other products that<br>
consume materials that could have been converted to DHP.<br>
Runs 4 and 5 are comparisons of the effect of base neutralization prior to refluxing on<br>
DHP yield. Previous work had shown DHP to decompose under acidic conditions when heated,<br>
especially at high temperature. By neutralizing the acidic catalyst before heating to reflux<br>
temperatures, decomposition of DHP can be suppressed. No difference in DHP chemical yield<br>
was seen in runs 4 and 5 but, again, subsequent recovery of DHP from the crude mixture was<br>
greater with DHP prepared according to run 4 than with run 5 (data not shown). Neutralization<br>
with a base allows the excess butryaldehyde to be reduced via base-catalyzed self-condensation,<br>
which is faster than acid catalyzed self-condensation. Also, the base neutralized run appeared to<br>
give improved layer separation. The top layer was relatively clear as compared to the other runs<br>
in which the top layers were cloudy. It was also noted that top layers from the non-neutralized<br>
runs would form small water droplets or layers in the sample bottles after standing for a few<br>
days. Neutralization of the acid catalyst is particularly useful when the product is distilled under<br>
high temperatures. Distillation of a neutralized DHP crude mixture produces fewer<br>
decomposition products and leads to increased recovered yields of purified DHP.<br>
The foregoing detailed description is given for clearness of understanding only, and no<br>
unnecessary limitations should be understood therefrom, as modifications within the scope of the<br>
invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>

EXAMPLE IV<br>
Example IV relates to In run 1 below, DHP is produced by methods consistent with the<br>
teaching of the Craig reference, wherein the acetic acid is mixed with the butyraldehyde, and the<br>
aniline is added subsequently. In run 2, this order has been altered, wherein the aniline and<br>
butyraldehyde are mixed, and the acetic acid is subsequently added to the mixture. It has been<br>
found that this change in the sequence leads to more consistent yields of DHP.<br>
The following chemicals were used in Example IV:<br>
Acetic acid, Fisher Chemical, glacial, 99.9%<br>
Aniline, Acros Chemical, ACS reagent grade<br>
Butyraldehyde, Acros Chemical, 99%<br>
A 1000 mL four neck flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a<br>

The flask was charged with the reactants while maintaining the reaction temperature at 20°C<br>
(amounts shown in Table 2 in moles). The reaction mixture was stirred for one hour at less than<br>
25°C. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux (~90°C) and was held for five hours. The<br>
reaction mixture was cooled and the layers were separated. The top, organic layer was distilled<br>
through a 14" packed column under reduced pressure. The fraction taken at a head temperature<br>
of 140-143°C and 5 mm Hg pressure was analyzed by gas chromatography.<br><br>

Runs 1 and 2 compare the effect of order of addition of the reactants on the yield of DHP.<br>
As can be seen in the table, the order of addition had no negative effect on the yield of DHP in<br>
these lab runs. While no significant positive effect was seen either, the time period between<br>
addition of the acetic acid and aniline was relatively short, and, with the slow addition time,<br>
controlling the reaction temperature was not difficult. In bench runs, little effect is seen in<br>
reversing the order of addition of the reactants. However, under production conditions, the time<br>
period between additions can vary considerably and controlling the reaction temperature can be<br>
more difficult. From an operations view, the new method of adding aniline to butyraldehyde<br>
followed by the addition of the acetic acid catalyst can be beneficial. In prior production<br>
operations, it has been found that acetic acid can catalyze the self-condensation of<br>
butyraldehyde, and long addition times and/or poor cooling can significantly reduce the<br>
butyraldehyde available to react with aniline, which could lead to a reduction in DHP yield.<br><br>
P01232-TW-00<br>
-14-<br>
Under production conditions, reversing the order of addition to add aniline to butyraldehyde<br>
followed by the addition of acetic acid provides for more reliably consistent yields<br><br>
