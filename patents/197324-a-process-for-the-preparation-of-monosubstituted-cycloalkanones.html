				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This a invention relates to a process for the preparation of monosubstituted cycloalkanones. More particularly it relates to the preparation of 2-(4-amino benzylidene) cycloalkanones having the general formula 1 given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = nil, -CH2-, -CH(CH3)-<br>
These compounds form precursors that are useful for the preparation of mesogens for non-linear optical applications. The precursors prepared by the process of this invention are based on mono substituted cyclohexanones/ cyclopentanones.<br>
The precursors prepared by the process of this invention can be further reacted under suitable reaction conditions to prepare new mesogens useful for the synthesis of new side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The new side chain liquid crystalline polymers prepared are useful for non-linear optical applications.<br>
The need for newer materials for use in non-linear optical application is strongly felt by researchers. The need is desired by those involved in the developmental efforts for optical signaling manipulation, parallel optical image processing systems in the wake of developments in the area of fibre optics. The material development is directed towards materials with non¬linear properties.<br>
Properties that are critical for materials to qualify for non¬linear optical applications include transparency, thermal, photochemical and chemical stability, dielectric constant etc. Both inorganic and organic salts exhibit non-linear optical properties. Materials that have been extensively used in the area<br><br>
of non-linear optical applications are inorganic salts such as potassium dideuterium phosphate, lithium niobate, potassium titanyl phosphate etc. Organic materials offer the advantage of high density packing and specific arrangement of molecules in the crystalline state. While the organic materials offer superior properties in comparison with inorganic materials, practical utilization poses several problems. In addition, the development of organic materials which offer superior non-linear optical properties have been hindered because of the low threshold limits of these materials on exposure to strong radiations such as laser beam.<br>
Amongst the various approaches towards development of materials for non-linear optical applications such as crystal growth, growth in confined structures, monolayer assemblies such as the Langmuir-Bludget films and poled polymer systems. The precursors prepared by the process of this invention can be used in the preparation of side chain liquid crystalline polymers for poled polymer systems.<br>
The advantages offered by the poled polymer systems are greater flexibility in the selection of mesogenic and polymeric structures and ease of fabrication of devices. The side chain liquid crystalline polymer synthesised using the mesogen as per the process of this invention could be used in poled polymer systems.<br>
Poling of polymers is done by subjecting the polymer usually in the form of a film to an external electric field at an elevated<br><br>
temperature followed by cooling to ambient temperature before the applied external field is removed. During this process the dipolar species in the polymer film would reorient and a net alignment is retained in the film.<br>
For a polymer to be useful for non-linear optical applica-tions, it must satisfy primary optical property requirements. The primary optical property is characterised by the material having substantial transparency to light of desired frequency.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of substituted benzyli-dene cycloalkanones.<br>
The substituted benzylidene cycloalkanones, namely 2-(4-amino benzylidene) cycloalkanones are reportedly synthesised for the first time by the inventors of the present invention and hence there are no earlier methods known for the prepara-tion of these compounds.<br>
The precursors prepared by the process of this invention can be further reacted under suitable reaction conditions to prepare new mesogens useful for the synthesis of side chain liquid crystalline polymers. The side chain liquid crystalline polymer prepared is useful for non-linear optical applica¬tions .<br>

(iii) dissolving the reaction product in an organic chlorinat¬ed solvent,<br>
