				<td>ELECRICALLY CONDUCTIVE POLYMER COMPOSITE COMPOSITIONS,<br>
METHOD FOR MAKING, AND METHOD FOR ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY<br>
ENHANCEMENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to electrically conductive polymer composite materials, and<br>
more particularly to methods for improving the electrical conductivity of such<br>
materials.<br>
Normally electrically insulating polymers can be made electrically conductive via the<br>
addition of electrically conductive fillers, such as carbon fibers, carbon blacks, or<br>
metal fibers. In each case, sufficient amount of filler must be added to overcome the<br>
percolation threshold, the critical concentration of filler at which the polymer will<br>
i<br>
conduct an electrical current. Beyond this1 threshold conductivity increases markedly<br>
as additional electrically conductive filler is added. It is believed that at the<br>
percolation threshold, uninterrupted chains of conducting particles first appear in the<br>
system. The addition of still greater amounts of electrically conductive filler produces<br>
a correspondingly higher number of uninterrupted chains and this results in still<br>
higher levels of conductivity.<br>
Electrically conductive polymer systems are prized as materials for electromagnetic<br>
shielding in electronics applications and as materials used in the fabrication of<br>
structures to which paiat may be applied using electrostatic painting techniques. A<br>
variety of electrically conductive fillers, such as carbon fibers, carbon fibrils and<br>
carbon black have bees employed to impart electrical conductivity to otherwise<br>
insulating polymeric materials. The use of such fillers may however degrade other<br>
important physical characteristics of the material such as its impact strength. In<br>
addition, certain fillers such as carbon fibris are high cost materials. Some electrically<br>
conductive fillers have a more pronounced negative effect on a material"s physical<br>
properties than others but nearly all polymer systems incorporating them suffer a<br>
degradation of impact strength, or other physical property not related to conductivity,<br>
relative to the unfilled polymer systems. In many instances, the desired level of<br>
electrical conductivity cannot be obtained without sacrificing at least some part of the<br>
material"s inherent impact strength. Therefore, it would be desirable to maximizing the<br>
electrical conductivity enhancing effect of the conductive filler while minimizing the<br>
resultant loss in impact properties.<br>
US Patent No. 4,451,536 discloses a heat distortion-resistant thermoplastic semi-<br>
conductive composition which includes ethylene-vinyl acetate and/or an ethylene<br>
acrylate ester copolymer, and an admixture of high density polyethylene and linear low<br>
density polyethylene in addition to the electrically conductive component and other<br>
additives normally forming part of such compositions.<br>
US Patent No. 5,382,622 discloses a method of making a semiconductor polymeric<br>
compound includes an "A" phase consisting of preparing a mixture of a polymeric matrix<br>
consisting essentially of about 60% by weight low density polyethylene and about 8.5%<br>
by weight ethylene vinyl acetate based on a total amount of the polymeric compound to<br>
be prepared with about 20% by weight of a conductive lampblack with a porous structure<br>
and about 4.0% by weight of a spreading agent consisting of calcium stearate, about 3 by<br>
weight of an antioxidant, and about 0.5% of a coupling agent consisting of calcium<br>
titanate; and a "B" phase including incorporating the conductive component in the<br>
polymeric matrix by the steps of spreading the mixture using "bamburg" type intermittent<br>
mixers under process conditions to obtain a high rate of lampblack shearing and<br>
homogenizing of a sheared lampblack and spreading and coupling agent portion. A<br>
semiconductor body according to the invention is made by extruding and calendaring the<br>
semiconductor polymeric compound with lampblack aggregations having a high degree<br>
of shearing and low degree of orientation.<br>
EP0582919 discloses a process for the preparation of a plastics material which is based<br>
on a doped polyaniline. The process is characterized in that when using as a plastics<br>
material a polyaniline which has been doped with a protonic acid, the difficulty how to<br>
combine the melt-processability and neutrality of the material. A well processable, with a<br>
protonic acid doped polyaniline has herefore always been so acidic that it has disturbed<br>
both the processing apparatus, and the environment as a finished product. It has now,<br>
anyhow, been invented a process for the preparation of a plastics material which is based<br>
on a doped polyaniline, during or after bringing in contact a polyaniline or a derivative<br>
thereof and a protonic acid also a metal compound is admixed. The metal compound is<br>
preferably first reacted with a first acid, whereupon the obtained produ is brought<br>
together with a blend or reaction product formed by a polyaniline or a derivative thereof<br>
and a second protonic acid. In the mentioned process as the metal compound e.g. zinc<br>
oxide is used, as the first acid preferably the same acid as for the second protonic acid,<br>
i.e. dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid, is used. The plastics mixture thus prepared is<br>
preferably brought together with a thermoplastic polymer such as a polyolefin, wherein a<br>
neutral, plastic, stabile plastics material having a low percolation threshold is obtained.<br>
The instant invention is based upon the discovery that certain organic compounds<br>
function as conductivity enhancing agents in organic conductive composite compositions,<br>
and that the inclusion of one or more of these conductivity enhancing agents reduces the<br>
amount of conductive filler required in order to achieve a given level of electrical<br>
conductivity composite polymer systems in that high levels of electrical conductivity can<br>
be achieved at reduced concentrations of electrically conductivity relative to that require<br>
in the absence of the conductivity enhancing agent. The instant invention overcomes the<br>
limitation of earlier conductive composite polymer system in that high levels of electrical<br>
conductivity can be achieved at reduced concentration of electrically conductive filler<br>
relative to compositions lacking the conductivity enhancing agents. In this way, the<br>
present invention reduces the amount of electrically conductive filler required, thereby<br>
reducing the cost of the polymer system.<br>

Examples<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
with a detailed disclosure and description of how the methods claimed herein are<br>
evaluated, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their<br>
invention. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are by weight, temperature is in degrees<br>
centigrade. The materials and testing procedures used for the results shown herein are<br>
as follows:<br>
The organic conductive composite materials exemplifying me present invention were<br>
prepared from commercially available nylon 6,6 and polyphenylene ether (PPE<br>
available from General Electric) and graphite fibrils as the electrically conductive<br>
filler. Carbon fibril-nylon 6,6 mixtures are available torn Hyperion Catalysis<br>
International.<br>
Resistivity measurements employed standard injection molded tensile bars as follows.<br>
An injection molded tensile bar was first lightly scored and then frozen in liquid<br>
nitrogen before fracturing the tab ends off (on the score marks) to obtain the narrow<br>
section having dimensions of approximately 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.125 inches. The sample was<br>
allowed to warm to room temperature and the fractured ends were painted with<br>
conductive silver paint (sold by Ernest F. Fullam, item # 14811) to provide a uniform<br>
contact area across the entire cross section. Resistance was measured on a Wavetek<br>
RMS225 phm-meter for samples having resistance values less than 40 MO or on a<br>
Keithley 617 electrometer for samples having resistance values between 40 MO and<br>
200 GO. The specific volume resistivity (SVR or bulk resistivity) of the sample was<br>
calculated by multiplying the measured resistance times the cross sectional area of the<br>
bar divided by the length of the bar.<br>
Notched IZOD impact test values were obtained at room temperature and are reported<br>
in foot-pounds per inch (ft.lb/in).<br>
Example 1<br>
A dry blend of 40.72 parts PPE, poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene)ether, having an<br>
intrinsic viscosity of about 0.4 deciliters per gram (dl/g) as measured in chloroform at<br>
30°C, 7.43 parts Kraton G1651 and 3.71 parts Kraton G1701 impact modifier, 0.1<br>
parts potassium iodide, and 0.01 parts copper iodide was fed at a rate of 20.74 pounds<br>
per hour (phr) to the throat of a twin screw extruder operated at 290°C at 400 rpm.<br>
Simultaneously, a blend of 38.03 parts nylon 6,6 powder, 5.90 parts nylon 6,6-carbon<br>
fibril mixture containing 20.0 percent by weight carbon fibrils, and 4.20 parts of a<br>
dispersion of calcium stearate powder in ground nylon 6,6 containing 5.0 percent by<br>
weight calcium stearate, was fed at a rate of 1925 phr through a downstream inlet of<br>
the extruder. The extruded composite composition contained 1.20 percent by weight<br>
carbon fibrils based on the total weight of the composition and 0.45 percent by weight<br>
calcium stearate based upon the weight of nylon 6,6.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The control sample was produced as in Example 1 with the exception that nylon 6,6<br>
was substituted for the nylon 6,6-calcium stearate mixture. The resultant organic<br>
conductive material had a fibril concentration of 12% by weight based on the total<br>
weight of the composition, and the same relative amounts of nylon 6,6 and PPE as in<br>
the composition of Example 1 and a bulk resistivity of 14.54 K ohm-cm<br>
Examples 2-5, in which the weight fraction of carbon fibrils was maintained at 1.2<br>
percent based on the total weight of the composition while varying the amount of<br>
calcium stearate, were prepared in a manner analogous to Example 1 using the same<br>
relative amounts of nylon 6,6 and PPE.<br>
Examples 6-8, in which the weight fraction of calcium stearate was maintained at 0.9<br>
percent based on the total weight of nylon 6,6 while varying the amount of carbon<br>
fibrils, were prepared in a manner analogous to Example 1 using the same relative<br>
amounts of nylon 6,6 and PPE.<br>
Examples 9-14 were prepared in a manner analogous to that employed in Example 1<br>
using the same relative amounts of nylon 6,6 and PPE, wherein a conductivity<br>
enhancing agent other than calcium stearate was added as a 5% dispersion in nylon<br>
6,6 powder. The compositions of Exampleis 9-15 comprise 1.2 weight percent carbon<br>
fibrils. The materials of Examles 9-14 contained 0.9 weight percent calcium stearate<br>
based upon the weight of nylon 6,6.           :<br>
Table I illustrates the effect of calcium stearate on electrical and impact properties of<br>
polyphenylene ether-nylon 6,6-carbon fibril composite compositions comprising<br>
about 40.72 parts polyphenylene ether, about 46.74 parts nylon 6,6, about 11.14 parts<br>
impact modifiers, about 1.2 parts carbon fibrils and calcium stearate in a range<br>
between about 0 and about 2.5 weight percent based upon the weight of nylon 6,6<br>
present in the composition. It can be seen that the SVR decreases steadily as the<br>
amount of calcium stearate in the composition is increased.<br>
As a result of calcium stearate addition, less of the conductive filler is required to<br>
achieve the desired level of electrical conductivity and there is little effect on impact<br>
strength. This is demonstrated in Table 2 wherein the level of calcium stearate is<br>
maintained at 0.9 weight percent with respect to the weight of nylon 6,6 while the<br>
amount of carbon fibrils is varied. As illustrated in Example 7, the presence of the<br>
0.9% calcium stearate together with 0.8 % carbon fibrils affords composite<br>
composition having conductivity superior to a control sample containing 30 percent<br>
more carbon fibrils, Comparative Example 1.<br>

13.A method as claimed in claim 12 wherein the poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-<br>
phenylene)ether and impact modifier are first melt mixed under melt<br>
processing conditions at a temperature in a range between about 270 and<br>
320°C, and thereafter nylon 6,6 carbon fibrils and calcium stearate are<br>
added to the mixture of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene)ether and<br>
impact modifier, and the whole is subjected to further melt processing.<br>
14. A method of enhancing the electrical conductivity of an electrically<br>

(B) an electrically conductive filler comprising carbon fibrils in an<br>
amount equivalent to from about 0.1 to about 2.0 weight percent;<br>
wherein weight percent refers to the weight percent of constituent<br>
relative to the total weight of the composition;<br>
said method comprising combining components (A) and (B) with a<br>
conductivity enhancing agent comprising calcium stearate in an<br>
amount equivalent to about 0.1 to about 2.0 weight percent<br>
calcium stearate based upon the total weight of the composition.<br>
Inclusion of relatively small amounts of organic ionic species, such as calcium<br>
stearate, in the preparation of an electrically conductive polymer composite .<br>
composition provides a composition having enhanced electrical properties relative to<br>
the composite composition lacking the added organic ionic species. As a result of this<br>
enhancement, normally insulating materials which rely upon a conductive filler to<br>
render them electrically conductive, can be made to achieve a given level of<br>
conductivity using less of the conductive filler than would otherwise be required. As a<br>
result, the adverse effects of the conductive filler on the polymer"s physical properties<br>
can be minimized while maintaining a high level of electrical conductivity.</td>
