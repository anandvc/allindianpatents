				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A <br><br>
This invention relates to a candleholder.<br>
Open candle stands or candle stands mounted with a glass chimney for burning candles are well known from ancient times. The popular and inexpensive method for fixing the candles on these candle stands is to stick the candles on a flat surface portion or a cup provided on top of the candle stands. This is often a clumsy procedure and one often finds the fixed candles falling down and the operator being obliged to stick it again and again. This is all the more annoying for candleholders having a glass chimney. Vertical placement of the candle is also almost obligatory for these candleholders with a glass chimney. Cylindrical candles come in different diameters and accurate fitting into the receptacle is often not feasible for these different sized candles. Another technique employed in the prior art is to provide a needle shaped projection on top of the candle stand and to press the wax candle on to this needle shaped projection. This method is suitable only for the large diameter candles and also only for the resilient and costly ones. Most commercially available cheap candles tend to break when so pressed. There is therefore a long felt need for a simple means to fix candles of different diameters firmly and accurately on top of candle stands.<br>
The object of this invention is to propose a candleholder provided with an inexpensive, simple and efficient mechanism for holding the candle vertically on top of its candle stand. It is also another object of this invention to enable candles of different diameters to be held on the candle stand.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a candleholder comprising a) candle stand b) tubular glass chimney c) wax guard d) means for holding candles, characterized in that said candleholder has a clamp provided with adjustable jaws for holding candles of different diameters within the range of 0.3 cm to 8 cm.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a candleholder comprising a) candle stand b) wax guard c) means for holding candles, characterized in that said candleholder has a clamp provided with adjustable jaws for holding candles of different diameters within the range of 0.3 cm to 10 cm.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the clamp on top of the candle stand has two jaws and at least one of said jaws is spring-loaded and is horizontally movable and has a horizontally concave engaging surface for holding cylindrical candles of different diameters.<br>
In one embodiment of the candle holder the candle stand comprises of a base and a column extending upwards from the base. In another embodiment the column is absent and the candle is provided on the said base. The candleholders described above are usually provided with a wax guard comprising a plate projecting sideward around the said candle<br><br>
stand towards the top of the candle stand for protecting the hands of the operator. For candleholders having a chimney the wax guard is often provided by the horizontal member that mates with the chimney at its periphery. The candleholders without the wax guard may also be used. Means for air circulation is usually provided by channels on the candle stand or the chimney, said channels leading to the tubular space within the fitted chimney.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
FigJ: is the sectional elevation of an embodiment of the candleholder according to the invention;<br>
Fig.2: is the pictorial view of the clamp fixed on top of the candle stand shown in Fig.l; Fig.3: is the plan view of another embodiment of the clamp according to the invention; Fig.4: is the sectional elevation of another embodiment of the candleholder according to the invention.<br>
As shown in the figures the candleholders according to the invention shown in the figures are provided with a candle stand having a base B, and a column M extending upwards from the said base. Means for holding a glass chimney C on top of the said column is also provided, said means comprising the spring-loaded jaws J within which the glass chimney is held. Means for air entry into the fitted chimney fi:om below is also provided, said means comprising the gaps such as G provided in between the jaws J. The arrow in the gap G in Fig.l shows the path of the airflow into the chimney. The horizontal member of the gripping member J acts also as a wax guard for this type of candleholder. The candle stand may be made of metal or plasfic.<br>
The characteristic feature of the invention is the provision of the clamp L on top of the candle stand for holding the candle vertically within the chimney. The clamp L has two jaws P and Q that hold the candle and the clamp is fitted to the top of the candle stand by the rivet R passed through the hole H. The clamp L shown in Figs.l and 2 is made of a steel plate having spring action so that the candle would be held firmly between the jaws P and Q when introduced therein after separating the jaws. The flatted semicircular shape (horizontally concave engaging surface) for the jaws would ensure that candles of slightly different diameters would be held firmly within the jaws of the clamp.<br>
Fig.3 shows the plan view of another clamp, the candle D being shown in sectional view. The moving jaw Q is controlled by the coil spring S passed over a shaft passing through a hole on the fixed body of the clamp L. The candle D is held between the fixed jaw P and the movable jaw Q. In another embodiment the column M is absent, the chimney being fitted on<br><br>
top of the base B of the candle stand. The clamp L is then provided on top of the base B within the fitted glass chimney.<br>
Open candle holders (without a glass chimney) may also have a clamp L on top of their candle stands such that the candle can be held vertically within the jaws of said clamp on top of the candle stand, as shown in Fig,4. The candle stand shown has a base B and a column M extending upwards from the said base. A wax guard W is provided around the column towards the top, said guard usually comprising a plate projecting sideward around the column. In addition to its other functions this wax guard prevents the wax from falling on to the hand holding the column of the candle stand. The candleholder shown in Fig.4 is usually made of metal. This open candleholder may also be provided without the wax guard W. It may also be provided without the column M.<br><br><br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
l.A candleholder comprising a) candle stand b) tubular glass chimney c) wax guard d) means for holding candles, characterized in that said candleholder has a clamp provided with adjustable jaws for holding candles of different diameters within the range of 0.3cm to 8 cm.<br>
2.	A candleholder comprising a) candle stand b) wax guard c) means for holding candles, characterized in that said candleholder has a clamp provided with adjustable jaws for holding candles of different diameters within the range of 0.3 cm to 10 cm,<br>
3.	The candleholder as claimed in claims 1 to 2, wherein said clamp has two jaws and at least one of said jaws is spring-loaded and is horizontally movable.<br>
4.	The candleholder as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein at least one of said jaws has a horizontally concave engaging surface.<br>
5.	The candleholder as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein in one embodiment the candle stand comprises a base and a column extending upwards from the base.<br>
6.	The candleholder as claimed in claim 5, wherein in another embodiment said column is absent.<br>
7.	The candleholder as claimed in claims 1 to 6, wherein said wax guard comprising a plate extending around the candle stand is provided towards the top of the candle stand.<br>
8.	The candleholder as claimed in claims 1 to 7, wherein in an embodiment the candleholder is not provided with the wax guard.<br>
9.	The candleholder as claimed in claims 1 to 8, wherein means for air circulation<br>
comprising of channels are provided on the candle stand or on the said chimney.<br>
10.	A candleholder substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in,<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
