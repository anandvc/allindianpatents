Technique<br>
1H NMR spectra of some thieno[2,3-D]pyrimidones were carried out..<br>
Results<br>
a) Example 17 of WO-A-98/054190 (D1)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The present invention relates to a thienopyrimidinedione compound.<br>
The present invention relates to thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidinediones, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. In particular, in their use in the modulation of autoimmune disease.<br>
T-cells play an important role in the immune response, however in auto-immune disease T-cells are inappropriately activated against particular tissues and proliferate, eg causing the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of the proliferation of T-cells is beneficial in the modulation of autoimmune disease.<br>
The compound of WO 2000/12514 and WO2001/038489 are known to be useful in modulating the immune response. These applications encompass compounds haylng an amidic -C-N- at the 5-position of the thienopyrimidine ring system. These compounds exist as slowly-interconverting rotamers, because of the combination of slow rotations around the amidic C-N link and around the bond from the amidic carbonyl to the thienopyrimidine core; the rate of interconversion is such that the isomers may be separated by HPLC. Such hindered rotation presents significant problems for the development of a pharmaceutical compound: long equilibration times imply that different initial rotameric mixtures may be expected to arise if the conditions of the final step of the synthesis is varied, leading to problems in assaying purity and reproducing the solid form of the raw drug. Moreover rotameric forms haylng lifetimes comparable to biological half lives may be expected to be handled by metabolic processes in different ways, potentially giylng rise to structurally dissimilar metabolites, the biological actiylty and safety of all of which must be fully studied and documented. We have now found a class of compounds which have incorporate an amidic -C-N-group at the 5-position of the thienopyrimidine ring system, have, interesting potency and yet do not have the problems associated with the compounds existing as separate rotamers under ambient conditions.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is proylded a<br>
compound of formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein:<br>

In another aspect the invention relates to a compound of the formula (1) as hereinabove defined or to a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula (1) or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form and is not to be ' limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings. The formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms and it is to be understood that the specification encompasses all possible tautomeric forms of the compounds drawn not just those forms which it has been possible to show graphically herein.<br>
The present invention relates to the compounds of formula (1) as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula (1) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula (1) as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. Suitable salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulphates, hydrogen sulphates, alkylsulphonates, arylsulphonates, acetates, benzoates, citrates, maleates, fumarates, succinates, lactates and tartrates. In addition where the compounds of formula (1) are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with amine, diamine, triamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxye1liyl)arnine.<br>
Preferred salts include an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate, tartrate, citrate, oxalate, methanesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonate, or an alkali metal salt such as a sodium or potassium salt.<br>
Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:<br>

Examples of such pro-drugs may be used to form in-ylvo-cleavable esters of a compound of the formula 1. An in ylvo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I) containing a hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent alcohol. The term includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters and a-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in ylvo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group. Examples of a-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxymethoxy and 2,2-dipropionyloxymethoxy. A selection of in ylvo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcaxbamoyl (to give carbamates), dialkylaminoacetyl and carboxyacetyl.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula (1) can exist in solvated forms as well as unsolvated forms, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms, which are useful in therapy, in particular for the particular therapeutic purposes mentioned hereinafter.<br>
In the present specification, unless otherwise indicated, an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group or an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl moiety in a substituent group may be linear or branched.<br>
Ar may be bonded to the -C(R )(R )- group by a ring carbon or a ring nitrogen proylding this does not lead to quaternisation.<br>
It will be appreciated that in a group -C(R4)(R5)Ar, R5 may represent a hydroxy group only when Ar is bonded to -C(R4)(R5) through a carbon atom and not a heteroatom. Furthermore, it should be understood that in -C(O)Ar, Ar is bonded through a carbon atom<br>
and not a heteroatom to the moiety -C(O). A hydroxyalkyl may contain more than one hydroxy group but a single hydroxy group is preferred.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, when Ar is substituted by an oxo or thioxo group, it is intended that Ar includes the dihydro-versions of aromatic ring systems. For example, it encompasses thiazolyl and 2,3-dihydrothiazolyl(when the latter is substituted by an oxo or thioxo grou). Similarly Ar encompasses, for example, 2,3-dihydrobenzoxazolyl, 2,3-dihydrobenzothiazolyl, 2,3-dihydropyrazinyl and 2,3-dihydrobenzimidazolyl (when these are substituted by an oxo or thioxo group).<br>

and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. Synthesis of Compounds of the Formula (1)<br>
Compounds of formula (1) may be prepared by a number of processes as generally described hereinbelow and more specifically in the Examples hereinafter. Processes for the preparation of novel compounds of formula (1), are proylded as a further feature of the invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated, which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist<br>
Thus according to another aspect of the invention, a compound of the formula (1) may be formed by deprotectmg a compound of the formula (1) wherein at least 1 functional group is protected. For example, amino or hydroxy groups may be protected during the reaction sequence used to prepare a compound of the formula (1).<br>
Protecting groups may in general be chosen from any of the groups described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the protection of the group in question, and may be introduced by conventional methods.<br>
Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method as described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting<br>
group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an aryl group (especially benzyl), a tri-(l-4C)alkylsilyl group (especially trisilyl or s tert-butyldisilyl), an aryldi-(l-4C)alkylsilyl group (especially diphenylsilyl), a diaryl-(l-4C)alkylsilyl group (especially tert-buryldiphenylsilyl), a (l-4C)alkyl group (especially ), a (2-4C)alkenyl group (especially allyl), a (l-4C)alkoxy group (especially methoxy) or a tetrahydropyranyl group (especially tetrahydroyran-2-yl). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an aryl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-charcoal. Alternatively a trialkylsilyl or an aryldialkylsilyl group such as a tert-butyldisilyl or a diphenylsilyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid, or with an alkali metal or ammonium fluoride such as sodium fluoride or, particularly, tetrabutylammonium fluoride. Alternatively an alkyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with an alkali metal (l-4C)alkylsulphide such as sodium thioethoxide or, for example, by treatment with an alkali metal diarylphosphide such as lithium diphenylphosphide or, for example, by treatment with a boron or aluminium trihalide such as boron tribromide. Alternatively a (l-4C)alkoxy group or tetrahydropyranyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid such as hydrochloric or trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Alternatively a suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example a (2-4C)alkanoyl group (especially acetyl) or an aroyl group (especially benzoyl). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino, imino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example a (2-4C)alkanoyl group (especially acetyl), a (l-4C)alkoxycarbonyl group (especially methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl), an arylmethoxycarbonyl group (especially benzyloxycarbonyl) or an aroyl group (especially benzoyl). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with<br>
the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl, alkoxycarbonyl or aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a tert-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid such as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid, and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-charcoal.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973) and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 2nd edition; T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (1991).<br>
A compound of the formula (1), or a compound of the formula (1) wherein at least 1<br>
functional group is protected, may be prepared using one of the following processes:<br>
a)	reacting a compound of the formula (10):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with isoxazolidine or tetrahydroisoxazine (each being optionally substituted by a hydroxy<br>
group);<br>
b)	when Q is ene, reacting a compound of the formula (11):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with a compound of the formula Ar;<br>
c)    when Q is ene, reducing a compound of the formula (12):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
d)   reacting a compound of the formula (11) or (13) to form Ar by primary ring synthesis:<br>
R3(Formula Removed)<br>
e)   reacting a compound of the formula (14) with R -U<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(14) wherein L and L2 are leaylng groups and R1, R2, R3, Q and Ar are as hereinabove defined and optionally after a), b), c) or d), converting the compound of the formula (1) into a further compound of formula (1) and/or forming a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
The reaction between a compound of the formula (10) and isoxazolidine or tetxahydroisoxazine (optionally substituted by a hydroxy group) is conveniently carried out<br>
under amide bond fonning reaction conditions. For example, in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylarnmopropyl)emylcarbodiimide. Optionally a base may be used, particularly an organic base such as txiethylamine. Suitable solvents are usually aprotic solvents, for example diformamide or chlorinated solvents, for example dichloromethane or trichloromethane. Additionally, a compound which catalyses this type of amide bond formation reaction, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, may be present. The temperature is usually in the range of about -30°C to about 60°C, particularly at or near ambient temperature.<br>
The reaction between a compound of the formula (11) and Ar is normally carried out in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride. Suitable leaylng groups include halo, in particular bromo. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, particularly at or around ambient temperature. In some circumstances, for example when Ar contains ring nitrogen atoms which do not need to be deprotonated, a milder base, such as sodium bicarbonate can be used. This reaction is conveniently used to prepare compounds in which Ar is linked through a ring nitrogen atom. However, it is possible to use this process to prepare a compound in which Ar is linked yla a ring carbon atom. This can be achieved by using a strong base and a zinc salt such as zinc chloride and optionally sodium iodide as a catalyst.<br>
A compound of formula (12) can be reduced to the corresponding ene compound using standard reduction conditions for hydroxy groups known in the art. For example, it can be protonated with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid and reduced with a trialkylsilane. Alternatively the hydroxy group could be converted to a stronger leaylng group, such as mesylate or tosylate and the resulting compound hydrogenated in a non-hydroxylic solvent, particularly tetrahydrofuran, with a catalyst such as palladium on charcoal, in a temperature range of 0°C to 50°C, particularly at ambient temperature and a pressure of 1 to 5 bar.<br>
The group -Q-Ar is conveniently formed on a compound of formula (11) or (13) by primary ring synthesis. Here, reference is made to the compendiums 'The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds' E.C. Taylor and A. Weissberger (published by John Wiley and Sons) and 'Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry', A.R Katritzky and C. W Rees (published by Pergamon Press (Elseyler)). For examples of the preparation of a compound of the<br>
formula (1) wherein Ar is 3,5-dipyrazol-4-yl or l,3,5-tripyrazol-4-yl see examples 11 and 12 in the specific examples.<br>
A compound of the formula (14) may be reacted with a compound of formula R1-L<br>
in the presence of a mild base, such as potassium carbonate, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, in a temperature range of ambient temperature to 170°C.<br>
A compound of the formula (1) may be prepared from another compound of formula (1) by chemical modification. For example a compound of the formula (1) wherein Q is ene can be oxidised to a compound of the formula (1) wherein Q is carbonyl. A preferred oxidising agent is 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. In some circumstances oxidation can be effected by exposure of the ene compound to air.<br>
Intermediates of the formulae (10) may be formed from a compound of the formula (15):<br>

Inhibition of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation<br>
The assay for PMA/ionomycin-stimulated PBMC proliferation was performed in 96-well flat bottomed microtitre plates. Compounds were prepared as lOmM stock solutions in di sulfoxide. A 50-fold dilution of this was prepared in RPMI and serial dilutions were prepared from this solution. lOul of the 50-fold diluted stock, or dilutions of it, were added to the well to give concentrations in the assay starting at 9.5uM and going down. Into each well was placed 1 x 105 PBMC, prepared from human peripheral blood from a single donor, in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% human serum, 2mM glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (0.5ng/ml final concentration) and ionomycin (500ng/ml final concentration) were added to these cells in supplemented RPMQ640 medium (as above) so that the final volume of the assay was 0.2ml. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% carbon dioxide for 72 hours. 3H-Thymidine (0.5uCi) was added for the final 6 hours of the incubation. The level of radioactiylty incorporated by the cells was then determined and this is a measure of proliferation.<br>
