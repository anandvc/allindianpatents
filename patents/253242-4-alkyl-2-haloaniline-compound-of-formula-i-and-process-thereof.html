				<td>4-ALKYL-2-HALOANILINE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING<br>
THE SAME<br>
[BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION] Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivatives and a process for producing the same. The 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivatives are intermediates for the synthesis of compounds useful as pharmaceuticals or agricultural chemicals. Related Art<br>
It is known that a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of an aniline derivative does not proceed without difficulty. The reason for this difficulty is as follows.  In general, in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of an aniline derivative, aprotonicacidor a Lewis acid is used as a catalyst. This catalyst, together with an amino group in the aniline derivative, forms a salt or coordinate bond to lower electron density on the aromatic ring, resulting in lowered reaction rate.  In particular, it is known that, in the alkylation of a  2-haloaniline  derivative,  an  electron  withdrawing substituent effect of a halogen atom in an ortho position on the aromatic ring relative to the amino group makes it very difficult for the alkylation reaction to proceed.<br>
In order to solve the above problem, two methods have been proposed.<br>
In one of the two methods, the amino group in the 2-haloaniline derivative is first protected with a protective group, such as acetyl, to lower the capability of the amino group that the amino group combines with the protonic acid or the Lewis acid to form a salt or complex bond. Thereafter, the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the protected 2-haloaniline derivative is carried out. So far as the present inventors know, however, there is no report about successful preparation of a product in which the regioselectivity has been significantly enhanced by this method.<br>
The other method is disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open Publication No. 944/1983. In this method, a 2-haloaniline derivative is alkylated in a closed vessel at a high temperature of 175 to 250Â°C under a pressure of 5 to 50 atm to selectively prepare a derivative in which an alkyl group has been introduced into the para or ortho position of the 2-haloaniline derivative.<br>
Inthismethod, however, thealkylationshouldbecarried out under acidic conditions and, at the same time, under high temperature and high pressure conditions. For this reason, in carrying out the reaction, a pressure-resistant and acid-resistant closed vessel should be used. This is disadvantageous from the viewpoint of handleability on a commercial scale. Due to the above reaction conditions, substrates usable in this reaction are disadvantageously limited to highly thermally stable compounds. Further, in aromatic ring coupling reactions such as Still coupling and Suzuki coupling, which have recently drawn attractive attention, aromatic iodine compounds having low thermal stability are generally used. Therefore, the method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 944/1983, which requires high temperature conditions, cannot be applied to such iodine compounds without difficulties.<br>
Accordingly, a method for synthesizing an alkylation product under mild reaction conditions without the necessity of adopting severe reaction conditions has been desired.<br>
On the other hand, for example, WO 01/92231 discloses 6-t-butyl-8-fluoroquinoline derivatives as a group of compounds having excellent control activity against rice blast. Thus, 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivatives can be used as intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals or agricultural chemicals. When a 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivative is synthesized for use in the above applications, the 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivative is preferably prepared by an alkylation reaction with high regioselectivity from the viewpoints of the quality and productivity of the final product.<br>
 [SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]<br>
The present inventors have now found that a 2-haloaniline derivative can be alkylated under milder reaction conditions than the prior art method by previously protecting an amino group, directly attached to the aromatic ring of a 2-haloaniline derivative, with a carbamate-type protective group, such as an alkyloxycarbonyl group, and then carrying out a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction. The present inventors have further found that, in this case, the alkylation reaction can be allowed to proceed with high regioselectivity, that is, the 4-position of the aromatic ring in the 2-haloaniline derivative can be alkylated with high selectivity. Further, when this reaction is utilized, a 6-t-butyl-8-fluoroquinoline derivative useful for control of rice blast can be prepared by a synthesis process using the 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivative as an intermediate for the synthesis of the 6-t-butyl-8-fluoroquinoline derivative. The present invention has been made based on such finding.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a production process of a 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivative through the alkylation of a 2-haloaniline derivative, which, as compared with the prior art method, can be carried out under milder reaction conditions and, at the same time, can realize higher regioselectivity with respect to the alkylation of the para position relative to amino in the 2-haloaniline derivative.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivative which is useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of compounds useful as pharmaceuticals or agricultural chemicals.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents branched chain C3 - C10 alkyl or optionally substituted C3 - C10 cycloalkyl;<br>
R2 represents a halogen atom, optionally substituted straight chain or branched chain C1 - C8 alkyl, or optionally substituted C3 - C8 cycloalkyl;<br>
R3 represents optionally substituted straight chain or branched chain C1 - C8 alkyl, optionally substituted straight chain or branched chain C2 - C6 alkenyl, or optionally substituted C3 - C8 cycloalkyl;<br>
n is an integer of 0 (zero) to 3; and<br>
X represents a halogen atom.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for producing the compound of formula (1), comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a 2-haloaniline derivative of formula (2) ; and<br>
reacting the 2-haloaniline derivative with an alkylating agent in the presence of an acid catalyst in an organic solvent or sulfuric acid to introduce group R1, which is as defined in formula (1), into the 4-position of the derivative, thereby preparing the compound of formula (1) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R2, R3, n, and X are as defined in formula (1) , provided that R2 is not in the 4-position on the aromatic ring.<br>
The use of the compound according to the present<br>
invention as an intermediate can realize with high efficiency<br>
the synthesis of 6-t-butyl-8-fluoroquinolone derivatives,<br>
which are useful as pharmaceuticals or such agricultural<br>
chemicals as rice blast control agents. Further, according<br>
to the production process of the present invention, the para<br>
(4) position relative to amino on the aromatic ring of the<br>
2-haloaniline derivative can be alkylated with high<br>
regioselectivity.	As     a     result,     a<br>
4-alkyl-2-haloalkyloxycarbonylaniline derivative is obtained, and a 4-alkyl-2-haloaniline derivative, which is generally difficult to produce, can be relatively easily produced with high efficiency by deprotecting the 4-alkyl-2-haloalkyloxycarbonylaniline derivative. By virtue of this high regioselectivity, the production of undesired by-products can be reduced, and the operation efficiency of the whole process can be improved. Further, the process of the present invention can be carried out on a commercial scale thereby. Therefore, the alkylation of the 2-haloaniline derivative can be carried out on a commercial scale. Furthermore, the production process of the present invention can be carried out under mild reaction conditions and thus can also be applied to the alkylation of compounds having low thermal stability such as 2-iodoaniline derivatives.<br>

4-t-butyl-2-fluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline.<br>
Production of compounds of formula (1)<br>
Compounds of formula (1) according to the present invention may be produced, for example, according to scheme 1. Starting compounds or materials necessary for the synthesis of the compounds according to the present invention are commercially available or can be easily produced by a conventional method.<br>
Scheme  1:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R1,   R2,  R3,   n,   and X are as defined in formula   (1),<br>
provided that R2 is not in the 4-position on the aromatic ring in  formulae   (2)   and   (4).<br>
Steps in scheme 1 will be described in detail in order.<br>
Step   (a):<br>
A 2-haloaniline derivative of formula (2) can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (4) or its salt with a chloroformic ester C1C00R3, wherein R3 is as defined in formula (1), under basic conditions to protect amino in the compound of formula (4) or its salt.<br>
Bases usable for providing basic conditions include, for example, pyridine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, morpholine, potassium carbonate, and sodium carbonate.<br>
Specific examples of compounds of formula (4) as the starting compound include: 2-fluoroaniline, 2-chloroaniline, 2-bromoaniline, 2-iodoaniline, 2,6-difluoroaniline, and 2,3-difluoroaniline      and      salts      thereof; 2-fluoro-3-methylaniline; and 2-fluoro-5-methylaniline.<br>
Chloroformic esters usable herein include, for example, alkyl chloroformates, for example, methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, andalkenyl chlorof ormates, for example, allyl chloroformate.<br>
The protection reaction of the compound of formula (4)<br>
or its salt with the chloroformic ester can be allowed to proceed by causing a substitution reaction in a solvent, such as ethyl acetate, toluene, or tetrahydrofuran, for example, at a temperature of -20Â°C to the boiling temperature of the solvent, preferably 0 (zero) to 50Â°C.<br>
In this reaction, the amino group in the compound of<br>
formula (4) is protected with a protective group, for example,<br>
alkyloxycarbonyl,	alkenyloxycarbonyl,<br>
4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl,	or<br>
2-methylsulfonylethyloxycarbonyl, to give the 2-haloaniline derivative of formula (2).<br>
Thus, when a carbamate-type protective group such as alkyloxycarbonyl is used, only the para position (4-position) relative to amino attached to the aromatic ring can be selectively alkylated. When other protective groups, for example, amide-type protective groups such as formyl, acetyl, andpivaloyl, are used, in general, disadvantageously, 5-alkyl compounds, which are compounds substituted at the meta position relative to amino attached to the aromatic ring, are mainly produced due to para orientation domination of 2-substituted halogen.<br>
Specific examples of 2-haloaniline derivatives of formula (2) include 2-fluoro-N- methoxycarbonylaniline, 2-chloro-N-methoxycarbonylaniline, 2-bromo-N-methoxycarbonylani1ine, 2-iodo-N-methoxycarbonylaniline, 2-fluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline, 2-chloro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline, 2-bromo-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline, 2-iodo-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline, 2,6-difluoro-N-methoxycarbonylaniline, 2,3-difluoro-N-methoxycarbonylaniline, 2,6-difluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline, 2,3-difluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline,<br>
2-fluoro-3-methyl-N-methoxycarbonylaniline,	and<br>
2-fluoro-5-methyl-N-methoxycarbonylaniline.<br>
Step (b):<br>
Compounds of formula (1) can be produced by introducing various alkyl groups into a 2-haloaniline derivative of formula (2) under conventional Friedel-Crafts alkylation conditions. More specifically, a compound of formula (1) can be produced by reacting a 2-haloaniline derivative of formula (2) with an alkylating agent in the presence of an acid catalyst in an organic solvent or sulfuric acid to introduce group R1, wherein R1 is as defined in formula (1) , into the 4-position of the derivative.<br>
The 2-haloaniline derivative of formula (2) may be one produced in step (a) , or alternatively may be a commercially available one.<br>
Alkylating agents usable herein include, for example, n-propyl chloride, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl chloride, isopropyl bromide, isopropyl alcohol, 1-propene, isobutyl chloride, isobutyl bromide, t-butyl alcohol, isobutene, t-butyl chloride, t-butyl bromide, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, t-amyl alcohol, t-amyl chloride, t-amyl bromide, l-chloro-2-methylbutane, l-bromo-2-methylbutane, and 4-propyl-4-heptanol.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the alkylating agent is selected from the group consisting of t-butyl alcohol, isobutene, t-butyl chloride, t-butyl bromide, isobutyl bromide, and isobutyl chloride. More preferably, the alkylating agent is selected from t-butyl alcohol or isobutyl bromide.<br>
For example, when t-butyl is introduced into the derivative of formula (2) , the alkylating agent is preferably t-butyl alcohol or isobutyl bromide.<br>
The amount of the alkylating agent used may be properly varied, for example, depending upon the structure and amount of the derivative of formula (2) and the structure of the alkylating agent used. For example, when t-butyl alcohol is used as the alkylating agent, the amount of t-butyl alcohol used is preferably 1.0 to 5.0 moles, more preferably 1.0 to 4.0 moles, based on one mole of the derivative of formula (2) .<br>
Preferred acid catalysts include protonic acids and Lewis acids.<br>
A typical example of the protonic acid catalyst is concentrated sulfuric acid. A typical example of the Lewis acid catalyst is anhydrous aluminum chloride. Sulfuric acid which has been diluted with water to a suitable concentration, for example, 50 to 90% sulfuric acid, may also be used as the protonic acid catalyst. Other acid catalysts usable herein include, for example, protonic acids, Lewis acids, or resin catalysts commonly used in conventional Friedel-Crafts reactions, for example, concentrated hydrochloric acid, concentrated nitric acid, stannic chloride, zinc chloride, ferric chloride, and strongly acidic ion exchange resin, Nafion-H resin or other resins.<br>
For example, when t-butyl is introduced into the derivative of formula (2), the use of either a combination of anhydrous aluminum chloride as the acid catalyst with isobutyl bromide as the alkylating agent or a combination of 50 to 90% sulfuric acid as the acid catalyst with t-butyl alcohol as the alkylating agent is preferred. When t-butyl is introduced into the derivative of formula (2) , more preferably, a combination of 70 to 80% sulfuric acid as the acid catalyst with t-butyl alcohol as the alkylating agent is used.<br>
Step (b) may be carried out in the absence of a solvent. Preferably, however, step (b) is carried out in a suitable solvent.<br>
When anhydrous aluminum chloride, which is a Lewis acid, is used as the acid catalyst, the solvent is preferably a chlorine-containing solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, or tetrachloroethane. In some cases, carbon disulfide or nitrobenzene commonly used in conventional Friedel-Crafts reactions may not be suitable as the solvent.<br>
When concentrated sulfuric acid, which is a protonic acid, is used as the acid catalyst, the concentrated sulfuric acid may also be used as the solvent. In this case, the concentration of the concentrated sulfuric acid is preferably<br>
50 to 90% (w/w) , more preferably 70 to 90% (w/w) . When concentrated sulfuric acid as such is used, in some cases, large amounts of by-products may be produced, resulting in lowered yield of the target compound.<br>
The amount of the acid catalyst used is preferably 1.5 to 4 .0 moles, more preferably 2.0 to 3.0 moles, based on one mole of the derivative of formula (2) . This, however, does not apply to the case where a protonic acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid or concentrated hydrochloric acid is used both as the acid catalyst and the solvent.<br>
Step (b) will be described in more details for each acid catalyst type.<br>
When aluminum chloride, which is a Lewis acid, is used as the acid catalyst, step (b) is desirably carried out by providing a mixed solution composed of the derivative of formula (2) dissolved in a solvent, adding aluminum chloride to the mixed solution, heating the mixture at 40 to 60Â°C for 30 min to dissolve aluminum chloride in the mixed solution, then cooling the mixed solution to room temperature, adding an alkylating agent thereto, and allowing a reaction to proceed.<br>
In this case, the amount of the alkylating agent used is preferably 1.0 to 6.0 moles, more preferably 4.5 to 5.5 moles, based on one mole of the derivative of formula (2). In the reaction, the alkylating agent may be added to the mixed solution at a time, or alternatively may be introduced in two or more divided portions into the reaction system. Preferably, in the reaction, the alkylating agent is added dropwise to the reaction system over a period of 15 to 30 min.<br>
The optimal reaction temperature varies in the range of a temperature provided under ice cooling to 40Â°C depending upon the type of solvent. Therefore, the reaction temperature may be properly varied depending upon the solvent. In general, however, the reaction is preferably carried out at room temperature (for example 20 to 30Â°C) from the viewpoint of yield.  The reaction time is generally 1 to 4 hr.  The<br>
disappearance of the evolution of resulting hydrochloric acid gas may be indicative of the completion of the reaction. The resulting hydrochloric acid gas can be efficiently removed from the reaction system by bubbling inert gas, such as nitrogen gas or argon gas, into the reaction system. The bubbling generally can have good effect on yield.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, water or a hydrochloric acid solution is added to the reaction solution to decompose the Lewis acid used as the catalyst, such as aluminum chloride, zinc chloride, or stannic chloride. Subsequently, the reaction solution is extracted with a solvent, which is the same as the reaction solvent, oranonpolar solvent, such as n-hexane, n-pentane, or ethyl acetate, to give the compound of formula (1) as the target compound. After the removal of the solvent from the extract by distillation, the compound thus obtained as such may be used in the next reaction. Alternatively, the compound may be purified, for example, by distillation or column chromatography on silica gel.<br>
When concentrated sulfuric acid, which is a protonic acid, is used both as the acid catalyst and the solvent, a method is preferably adopted wherein an alkylating agent is added to a mixed solution composed of the derivative of formula (2) dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid and a reaction is allowed to proceed.<br>
Preferred alkylating agents include, for example, isopropyl bromide and t-butyl bromide and, further, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol and t-butyl alcohol. In this case, preferably, the alkylating agent is used in an amount of 1.0 to 5.0 moles, more preferably 2.5 to 4.0 moles, based on one mole of the derivative of formula (2) . In the reaction, the alkylating agent may be added to the mixed solution either at a time, or alternatively may be introduced in two or more divided portions into the reaction system. Preferably, in the reaction, the alkylating agent is added in three or more divided portions.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally in the range of<br>
50 to 80Â°C, preferably in the range of 60 to 80Â°C. The reaction time is generally 3 to 6 hr, preferably 4 to 5 hr.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the reaction solution is extracted with a solvent such as n-hexane, n-pentane, or a ethyl acetate-n-hexane mixed solution to give the compound of formula (1) as the target compound. After the removal of the solvent from the extract by distillation, the compound thus obtained as such may be used in the next reaction. Alternatively, the compound may be purified, for example, by distillation or column chromatography on silica gel.<br>
Step (c):<br>
The protected amino in the compound of formula (1) is deprotected under acidic or basic conditions to give an aniline derivative of formula (3) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. The deprotection reaction can be carried out by a person having ordinary skill in the art by a conventional method properly selected depending upon the type of the protective group.<br>
For example, when the protective group is alkyloxycarbonyl, substantially quantitative deprotection can be achieved by dissolving the compound of formula (1) in a water-soluble polar solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, adding a 5 to 53% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or a 5 to 47% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, and heating the mixture with stirring. The concentration of the aqueous potassium hydroxide solution or the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is preferably about 30% from the viewpoint of stirring operation. This reactionmay also be carried out in the absence of the above solvent. In this case, a 5 to 53%, preferably 20 to 53%, particularly preferably about 30%, aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, or a 5 to 47%, preferably 20 to 47%, particularly preferably about 30%, aqueous potassium hydroxide solution may be used. As described above, for both the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and the aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, the concentration is preferably about 30% from the viewpoint of stirring operation. Further,<br>
in this case, even under conditions other than the above basic conditions, for example, catalytic hydrogenation conditions using palladium or platinum oxide, the compound of formula (1) can be quantitatively deprotected.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process for producing an aniline derivative of formula (3) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, said process comprising the steps of: adding, for example, a 20 to 53% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or a 20 to 47% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution to the compound of formula (1) in the presence of an organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, or in the absence of any solvent; and heat treating the mixture optionally under suitable deprotection conditions.<br>
When the protective group is alkenyloxycarbonyl, the compound of formula (1) can be substantially quantitatively deprotected by carrying out the heat treatment in a 47% hydrobromic acid-acetic acid solution.<br>
Specific examples of aniline derivatives of formula (3) produced in step (c) include: 2-fluoro-4-isopropylaniline, 2-chloro-4-isopropylaniline, 2-bromo-4-isopropylaniline, 2-iodo-4-isopropylaniline, 4-t-butyl-2-fluoroaniline, 4-t-butyl-2-chloroaniline, 2-bromo-4-t-butylaniline, 4-t-butyl-2-iodoaniline, 4-t-amyl-2-fluoroaniline, 4-t-amyl-2-chloroaniline, 4-t-amyl-2-bromoaniline, 4-t-amyl-2-iodoaniline, 4-t-butyl-2,6-difluoroaniline, 4-t-butyl-2,3-difluoroaniline,<br>
4-t-butyl-2-fluoro-3-methylaniline,	and<br>
4-t-butyl-2-fluoro-5-methylaniline.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred examples of such salts include: hydrohalogenide salts such as hydrochloride salts, hydrobromide salts, or hydroiodide salts; inorganic acid salts such as nitric acid salts, perchloric acid salts, sulfuric acid salts, or phosphoric acid salts; lower alkylsulfonic acid salts such as methanesulfonic acid salts, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid<br>
salts, or ethanesulfonic acid salts; arylsulfonic acid salts such as benzenesulfonic acid salts or p-toluenesulfonic acid salts; organic acid salts such as fumaric acid salts, succinic acid salts, citric acid salts, tartaric acid salts, oxalic acid salts, or maleic acid salts; and amino acid salts such as glutamic acid salts or aspartic acid salts.<br>
Further, in the present invention, the compounds may form solvates, and examples thereof include hydrates, alcoholates, for example, methanolates or ethanolates, and etherates, for example, diethyl etherates.<br>

Subsequently, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. n-Hexane (100 mL) was then added to the cooled reaction solution to carry out extraction for separation of the mixture into a sulfuric acid layer and an organic layer. n-Hexane (100 mL) was again added to the sulfuric acid layer to carry out extraction for separation of an organic layer.  The organic layers thus obtained were<br>
combined, and the combined organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine in that order. The solvent was then removed from the organic layer by distillation to give 2-fluoro-4-(1-methyl cyclohexyl)-N-methoxycarbonylaniline as an oil. The oil was further subjected to separation and purification by column chromatography on silica gel to give 843 mg of 2-fluoro-4-(1-methylcyclohexyl)-N-methoxycarbonylaniline as a target compound (yield 15.8%, 4-substituted compound : 5-substituted compound = 100 : 0) .

ethoxycarbonylaniline<br>
2-Fluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline (1.00 g, 5.46mmol) prepared as described in Example 1 was dissolved in 77.6% sulfuric acid (5.00 g) to prepare a solution. t-Butyl alcohol (0.440 g, 6.01 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution under a nitrogen atmosphere over a period of 30 min while stirring and heating the solution at 70Â°C. After the completion of the dropwise addition, the reaction solution was vigorously stirred at the same temperature for one hr. Thereafter, t-butyl alcohol (0.440 g, 6.01 mmol) was again added dropwise thereto over a period of 30 min. After the completion of the dropwise addition, the reaction solution was vigorously stirred at the same temperature for one hr. t-Butyl alcohol (0.440 g, 6.01 mmol) was again added dropwise thereto over a period of 30 min. After the completion of the dropwise addition, the reaction solution was vigorously stirred at the same temperature for one hr. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. n-Hexane (10 mL) was then added to the cooled reaction solution to carry out extraction for separation of the mixture into a sulfuric acid layer and an organic layer. n-Hexane (10mL) was again added to the sulfuric<br>
acid layer to carry out extraction for separation of an organic layer. The organic layers were combined, and the combined organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine in that order. The solvent was then removed from the organic layer by distillation to give 1.45 g of N-ethoxycarbonyl-4-t-butyl-2-fluoroaniline as an oily crude product (yield on weight basis 111%) . The crude product was further subjected to separation and purification by column chromatography on silica gel to give 1.17 g of a mixture of 4-t-butyl-2-fluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline with 5-t-butyl-2-fluoro-N-ethoxycarbonylaniline (yield 90%, 4-t-Bu : 5-t-Bu = 82 : 18).<br>
