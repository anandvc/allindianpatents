				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
THERMOSETTING ORGANIC RESIN COMPOSITION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a thermosetting organic resin composition, and,<br>
more specifically, to a thermosetting organic resin composition possessing superior<br>
moldability and, when cured, exhibiting superior adhesive properties on substrates<br>
such as metals.<br>
[0002]<br>
It is known that compounding epoxy-containing organosilanes, amine-containing<br>
organoalkoxysilanes or mercapto-containing organoalkoxysilanes with epoxy resins<br>
improves their adhesive properties. For instance, Japanese Patent Application<br>
Publication (Kokai) No. Sho 63-309566 teaches coating material compositions with<br>
improved adhesive properties obtained by compounding silane coupling agents such<br>
as 3-glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane,<br>
N-phenyl-3-aminutesopropyltrimethoxysilane, and<br>
3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane with epoxy resin powder coating materials.<br>
[0003]<br>
Also, Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 2*185584 teaches an<br>
adhesive agent composition obtained by compounding<br>
3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane with an epoxy resin. However, adhesive<br>
properties of the compositions obtained by the addition of epoxy-containing<br>
alkoxysilanes are not necessarily sufficient lor substrates such as metals, etc., and,<br>
depending on the intended use, such compositions may not be suitable.<br>
Furthermore, the original curability of the epoxy resins is significantly impaired in<br>
compositions obtained by adding amine-containing organoalkoxysilanes or<br>
mercapto-containing organoalkoxysilanes.<br>
[0004]<br>
On the other hand, there are also known thiocyanato-containing<br>
organoalkoxysilanes and organic rubber compositions containing said<br>
thiocyanato-containing organoalkoxysilanes. For instance, Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication (Kokai) No.-Hei 4-277534 teaches compositions obtained<br>
by compounding ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) with<br>
thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane. After vulcanization in the presence of<br>
organic peroxides, such compositions are said to produce rubber moldings<br>
exhibiting very little deterioration in physical properties and a small<br>
compression set.<br>
[0005]<br>
In addition, Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 5-214171<br>
teaches vulcanizable organic rubber compositions obtained by compounding<br>
thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane with vulcanizable organic rubbers, such as<br>
natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), EPDM, etc.. When<br>
vulcanized in the presence of sulfur, these compositions are said to produce<br>
rubber moldings exhibiting little deterioration in physical properties.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, there are no known thermosetting organic resin compositions, in<br>
which the addition of a thiocyanato-containing organoalkoxysilane to<br>
thermosetting organic resins improves the moldability of said organic resin and<br>
its adhesive properties on substrates such as metals with which said<br>
thermosetting organic resin composition has contacted.<br>
[0007]<br>
As a result of strenuous efforts, the inventors of the present invention have<br>
discovered that the above-described problems are solved if epoxy resins are<br>
compounded with a thiocyanato-containing organoalkoxysilane. Furthermore,<br>
they have discovered that compounding a thiocyanato-containing<br>
organoalkoxysilane with thermosetting organic resins, such as phenolic resins,<br>
imide resins, etc., results in an improvement in their adhesive properties.<br>
[0008]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a thermosetting organic resin<br>
composition having superior moldability that cures without impairing the<br>
curability of the thermosetting organic resin itself and, when cured, exhibits<br>
superior adhesive properties on substrates such as metals with which said<br>
thermosetting organic resin composition has contacted.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention relates to a thermosetting organic resin composition<br>
comprising (A) 100 parts by weight of a thermosetting organic resin and (B) 0.01 to<br>
100 parts by weight of a thiocyanato-containing organohydrocarbonoxysilane or an<br>
isothiocyanato-containing organohydrocarbonoxysilane represented by the general<br>
formula: X-R1-Si(OR2)nR33-n (wherein X is NCS- or SCN-, R1 is an alkylene or<br>
alkyleneoxyalkylene group, R2 and R3 are monovalent hydrocarbon groups, and the<br>
subscript n is 1, 2, or 3).<br>
[0010]<br>
To further explain the above, there are no particular limitations with regard to the<br>
type etc. of the thermosetting organic resin (A) so long as the thermosetting organic<br>
resin is liquid or solid at normal temperatures and cures under heating.<br>
[0011]<br>
Epoxy resins, phenolic resins, formaldehyde resins, xylene resins,<br>
xylene-formaldehyde resins, ketone-formaldehyde resins, furan resins, urea resins,<br>
imide resins, melamine resins, alkyd resins, unsaturated polyester resins, aniline<br>
resins, sulfonamide resins, and silicone resins are exemplified as such<br>
thermosetting organic resins. Of the above, epoxy resins, phenolic resins, and<br>
imide resins are preferable.<br>
[0012]<br>
Component (B) constitutes an essential characteristic of the composition of the<br>
present invention and acts to improve molding properties of the composition of the<br>
present invention and its adhesive properties on substrates such as metals.<br>
Component (B) is a thiocyanato-containing organohydrocarbonoxysilane or an<br>
isothiocyanato-containing organohydrocarbonoxysilane represented by the general<br>
formula: X-R1-Si(OR2)nR33-n (wherein X is NCS- or SCN-, R1 is an alkylene or<br>
alkyleneoxyalkylene group, R2 and R3 are monovalent hydrocarbon groups, and the<br>
subscript n is 1, 2, or 3).<br>
[0013]<br>
In the formula above, the alkylene group of R1 is exemplified by methylene,<br>
ethylene, methylmethylene, propylene, methylethylene, and butylene. The<br>
alkylenoxyalkylene group of R1 is exemplified by methylenoxymethylene,<br>
methylenoxyethylene, ethylenoxyethylene, and ethylenoxypropylene. R1 is<br>
preferably an alkylene group. The monovalent hydrocarbon groups of R2 and R3<br>
are exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl and other alkyl groups; vinyl,<br>
allyl, butenyl and other alkenyl groups; and by phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, and other aryl<br>
groups. R2 and R3 are preferably alkyl groups. The subscript n is 1, 2, or 3,<br>
preferably, 2 and 3.<br>
[0014]<br>
The thiocyanato-containing organohydrocarbonoxysilanes, or<br>

Two or more kinds of Component (B) can be added to the composition.<br>
[0016]<br>
If the amount of Component (B) added to the composition is too small, its<br>
adhesive properties on substrates such as metals deteriorate, and if it is too large,<br>
its mechanical strength decreases. For this reason, it should be in the range of<br>
0.01 to 100 parts by weight, and, preferably, in the range of 0.1 to 50 parts by<br>
weight, per 100 parts by weight of Component (A).<br>
[0017]<br>
Although the composition of the present invention comprises the<br>
above-mentioned Component (A) and Component (B), in addition to these<br>
components, various additives known to be compounded with Component (A), for<br>
instance, curing agents or cure promoters used to promote the cure of Component<br>
(A), fillers, plasticizers, flexibilizers, pigments, heat-stabilizers, flame-retarding<br>

organometallic compounds; phosphine and other organic phosphorus compounds;<br>
boron complex compounds, organic ammonium salts, organic sulfonium salts,<br>
organic peroxides, etc..<br>
[0019]<br>
The curing agents are added preferably in an amount of 0.1 to 30 parts by weight<br>
per 100 parts by weight of Component (A), but novlak resins for curing epoxy<br>
resins are added preferably in an amount of 10 to 400 parts by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight of epoxy resins, and the cure promoters are added preferably in<br>
an amount of 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of Component<br>
(A).<br>
[0020]<br>
The fillers are exemplified by glass fibers, asbestos, alumina fibers, ceramic fibers<br>
containing alumina and silica, boron fibers, zirconia fibers, silicon carbide fibers,<br>

parts by weight of Component (A) in non-liquid curable organic resin<br>
compositions, and in an amount of 0 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight<br>

[0023]<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises the above-described<br>
Component (A) and Component (B) and can be easily prepared by uniformly<br>
mixing them with the above-described additives, if necessary. Some examples of<br>
equipment used to prepare the composition of the present invention include<br>
continuous mixer-extruders, Ross mixers, kneader-mixers, twin roll mills, etc..<br>
In addition, conventional publicly known methods recognized as molding methods<br>
suitable for Component (A), such as, for instance, compression molding, transfer<br>
molding, injection molding, potting, casting, coating, etc., can be utilized in the<br>
manufacture of moldings from the composition of the present invention.<br>
[0024]<br>
The composition of the present invention as described above possesses superior<br>
molding properties and, when cured, superior adhesive properties on substrates<br>
such as metals with which said composition has contacted. Nickel, copper, brass,<br>
iron, steel, stainless steel, aluminum, duralumin, titanium, and silver are<br>
exemplified as the metals, and glass, ceramics, stones, and semiconductors are<br>
exemplified as the substrates. By exploiting the advantages of such properties, it<br>
may prove useful, for instance, for sealing agents, packaging agents, coating agents,<br>
adhesive agents etc. used in electric and electronic components or devices,<br>
machines, buildings, automobiles etc..<br>
[0025]<br>
Examples<br>
The composition of the present invention is explained in detail below by referring to<br>
working examples. The term "viscosity," as used in the working examples and<br>
comparative examples, refers to values obtained at 25°C. In addition, the<br>
moldability, adhesion (adhesive properties), and viscosity change rate of the<br>
thermosetting organic resin composition were evaluated in accordance with the<br>
following methods.<br>
[0026]<br>
Moldability<br>
The moldability of the thermosetting organic resin composition under pressure was<br>
evaluated by measuring its spiral flow. The spiral flow was measured by a test<br>
based on an EMMI standard (EMMI-1-66).<br>
[0026]<br>
Adhesion (A)<br>
An adhesion test piece made up of nickel plates integrally bonded with a cured<br>
product of the thermosetting organic resin composition was fabricated by<br>
sandwiching the thermosetting organic resin composition between two nickel plates<br>
(length; 5 cm, width: 1 cm, thickness: 0.5 mm) and conducting compression molding<br>
at a specified temperature and specified pressure. The edges of the two nickel<br>
plates of the test piece were respectively secured in the jig of a tensile tester and<br>
pulled away in a perpendicular direction at a speed of 50 mm/minutes, peeling<br>
apart the nickel plates and the cured product of the thermosetting organic resin<br>
composition.<br>
[0027]<br>
Subsequently, the condition of the fracture surface between the cured product of the<br>
thermosetting organic resin composition and the nickel plates was subjected to<br>
visual examination. The results were designated in the following manner.<br>
®: Extremely good adhesion (Fracture occurred in the layer of the cured<br>
organic resin. Cohesive failure: 100%).<br>
O : Good adhesion (Partial interface peeling occurred. Cohesive failure:<br>
95% or more).<br>
x: Poor adhesion (Peeling occurred at the interface between the cured<br>
thermosetting organic resin and the nickel plates. Cohesive failure: 50% or<br>
less)<br>
[0028]<br>
Adhesion (B)<br>
An adhesion test piece made up of nickel plates integrally bonded with a cured<br>
product of the curable organic resin composition was fabricated by sandwiching<br>
the curable organic resin composition between two nickel plates (length: 5 cm,<br>
width: 1 cm, thickness: 0.5 mm) and conducting compression molding at a<br>
specified temperature and specified pressure. In addition, adhesion test pieces<br>
made up of copper plates integrally bonded with a cured product of the curable<br>
organic resin composition were fabricated in the same manner as above.<br>
[0029]<br>
The edges of the two nickel plates or the two copper plates of these test pieces<br>
were respectively secured in the jig of a tensile tester and pulled away in a<br>
perpendicular direction at a speed of 50 mm/minutes, peeling apart the nickel<br>
plates or the copper plates and the cured product of the organic resin<br>
composition. The stress required for peeling was measured and used as the<br>
adhesive strength (kgf/cm2).<br>
[0030]<br>
Viscosity change rate:<br>
After preparation, the thermosetting organic resin composition was allowed to<br>
stand at 23°C for 24 hours. The degree of increase in its viscosity was<br>
measured and used as the viscosity change rate. Viscosity change rate =<br>
(viscosity of the thermosetting organic resin composition on standing for 24<br>
hours — viscosity of the curable organic resin composition immediately after<br>
preparation) xlOO/viscosity of the thermosetting organic resin composition<br>
immediately after preparation.<br>
[0031]<br>
Working Example 1<br>
A curable phenolic resin composition was prepared by kneading 35 parts by<br>
weight of phenolic resin (phenol-novolak resin Mirex XLC-3L from Mitsui<br>
Chemicals, Inc., softening point: 70°C, hydroxyl equivalent weight: 170), 3 parts<br>
by weight of S-thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysttane{NCS(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3}. 65 parts<br>
by weight of fused silica powder, 4 parts by weight of hexamethylenetetramine,<br>
and 1 part by weight of carnauba wax using a heating roller at 90°C.<br>
[0032]<br>
The composition was finely powdered and the powdered material was sandwiched<br>
between two nickel plates (length: 5 cm, width: 1 cm, thickness:- 0.5 mm) and<br>
subjected to compression molding by heating it for 3 minutes at a temperature of<br>
175°C and a pressure of 70 kg/cm2. After that, in order to complete the cure, the<br>
composition was heated for 2 hours at 180°C, producing an adhesion test piece<br>
made up of nickel plates integrally bonded with a cured product of phenolic resin.<br>
Using the test piece, the adhesion of the thermosetting organic resin composition<br>
to the nickel plates was measured in accordance with the method described in<br>
Adhesion (A) above, and the results were listed in Table 1.<br>
[0032]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A phenol-novolak resin composition was prepared in the same manner as in<br>
Working Example 1, except that 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane was added<br>
instead of the 3-thiocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane used in Working Example 1.<br>

manner as in Working Example 1, and the results were listed in Table 1.<br>
[0033]<br>

plates was measured in the same manner as in Working Example 1, and the<br>
results were listed in Table 1.<br>
[0034]<br>
[0035]<br>

{NCS(CH2)3SiCH3(OCH3)2}, 74 parts by weight of fused silica powder, 0.90 parts<br>
by weight of aluminum acetylacetonate, and 1 part by weight of carnauba wax<br>
using a heating roller at 90°C.<br>
[0036]<br>
The spiral flow of the thermosetting epoxy resin composition was measured.<br>
Next, the thermosetting resin composition was sandwiched between two nickel<br>
plates (length: 5 cm, width: l cm, thickness: 0.5 mm), and subjected to<br>
compression molding by heating it for 2 minutes at a temperature of 175°C and a<br>
pressure of 70 kg/cm2. After that, in order to complete the cure, the composition<br>
was heated for 12 hours at 180°C, producing an adhesion test piece made up of<br>
nickel plates integrally bonded with a cured product of the curable organic resin<br>
composition. Using the test piece, the adhesion of the curable organic resin<br>
composition to the nickel plates was measured in accordance with the method<br>
described in Adhesion (A) above, and the results were listed in Table 2.<br>
[0037]<br>
