In particular the invention includes the compounds of formula I and formula II as hereinafter described in the Examples, or pharmaceutically-acceptable and -cleavable esters, or acid addition salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula I and n, and salts and esters thereof, in particular as identified in the Examples are hereinafter referred to as Agents of the Invention.<br>
The Agents of the Invention which comprise free hydroxyl groups may be also used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable, physiologically cleavable esters, and as such and where novel are included within the scope of the invention. Such pharmaceutically acceptable esters are preferably prodrug ester derivatives, such being convertible by solvolysis or cleavage under physiological conditions to the corresponding Agents of the Invention which comprise free hydroxyl groups. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug esters are those derived from a carboxylic acid, a carbonic acid monoester or a carbamic acid, advantageously esters derived from an optionally substituted lower alkanoic acid or an arylcarboxylic acid.<br>
Agents of the Invention may also exist in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and as such and where novel are included within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts with conventional acids, for example, mineral acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric or phosphoric acid, or organic acids, for example, aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, e.g., acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, fumaric, hydroxymaleic, pyruvic, pamoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, sulfanilic or cyclohexylsulfamic acid; also amino acids, such as arginine and lysine. For compounds of the invention having acidic groups, for example, a free carboxy group, pharmaceutically acceptable salts also represent metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, as well as ammonium salts, which are formed with ammonia or suitable organic amines.<br><br><br>
with a condensation reagent such as chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (CISO2NCO), sodium cyanate, benzoyl isothiocyanate in THF, followed by treatment with KaCCVmethanol or sodium thiocyanate and acetic acid, and thereafter, if required converting the Rl, R2 or R3 residues into an alternative Rl, R2 or R3 residues to give alternative compound of formula II. For example, in the cyclisation reaction the benzophenone of formula II in solution is treated with a solution of sodium cyanate, e.g. in acetic acid at room temperature.<br><br>
with the corresponding halide, e.g. bromide, R3Br and a suitable base such as K2CO3. In particular, compounds of formula X where Rl is OH in 6 position and Rl is also 2-propenyl, cyclopropyl-methyl or propyl may be prepared as e.g. described in Example for compound 5-allyM-benzyl-6-hydroxy-4-(4-isopropyl-phenyl)-lH-quinazolin-2-one and following.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula II may be prepared by reductive amination of the corresponding aldehyde with the amine X, using Ti (Oi-pr)4 or molecular sieves as dehydrating agent and NaBH(OAc)3 or NaCNBH3 as the reducing agent. The amine X is obtainable from the corresponding nitro derivative (see below compound of formula XI) by reduction, e.g. with iron in acetic acid.<br><br><br>
wherein R2 is as previously defined and Rl is an activating group.<br>
The compound of formula XI may in turn be obtained by the oxidation, e.g. with Jones reagent, of the corresponding alcohol which may in turn be obtained by coupling an organometallic compound derived from the corresponding bromide of formula XIH and aldehyde of formulae XII respectively; for instance as described in<br><br>
In a further alternative, compounds of formula n, in particular where R3 is substituted pyridyl-methyl, may be prepared by reacting the corresponding alcohol, R3-OH, e.g. pyridyl-methyl-hydroxide, with the corresponding amine of formula X, e.g. in the presence of Hunig's base and mesyl chloride; for instance as hereinafter described in the Examples.<br>
In a yet further alternative Agents of the Invention of formula n, in which R3 is optionally substituted aryl-lower alkyl may be prepared by alkylation of an Agent of the Invention of formula XX<br><br><br>
at the 1-position with the corresponding optionally substituted aryl-lower alkylhalide; for instance, in the presence of e.g. LiHMDS and Nal, in solution, e.g. THF/DMF, with mild heating.<br><br>
wherein Rx is halo, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy;<br>
may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XX with the corresponding<br>
oxirane of formula XXI <br><br>
Where Rx is the optional substitution on the phenyl ring; for instance in the presence of benzyltriethylammonium chloride and potassium carbonate, e.g. as hereinafter described in the Examples. Corresponding compounds of formula II in which R3 is optionally substituted styryl may be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula XXII with a reagent such as trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride.<br>
The compound of formula XX may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula II in which R3 is H by treatment with a condensation reagent such as sodium cyanate.<br>
Agents of the Invention of formula II may be prepared as intermediates in the preparation of Agents of the Invention of formula I, e.g. as described above, or as hereinafter described in the Examples.<br>
Accordingly the Invention includes processes for the preparation of Agents of the Invention of formula I<br><br>
wherein the symbols are as defined above comprising a) cyclising a compound of formula II<br><br><br>
with a condensation reagent such as chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (CISO2NCO) or sodium cyanate or sodium thiocyanate; or<br>
b) for an Agent of the Invention of formula I, in which R3 is optionally substituted aryl-lower alkyl, alkylation of a compound of formula XX<br><br>
at the 1-position with the corresponding optionally substituted aryl-lower alkylhalide; and thereafter, if required converting the Rl, R2 or R3 residues into alternative Rl, R2 or R3 residues to give an alternative compound of formula I.<br>
The preparation of Agents of the Invention of formula II as described above is also included within the invention.<br>
Accordingly in a further aspect the invention provides processes for the preparation of Agents of the Invention of formula II<br><br><br>
wherein Rl, R2 and R3 are as defined above comprising alkylation of the corresponding aminobenzophenone compound of formula X<br><br>
wherein Rl and R2 are as defined above, and thereafter, if required, converting Rl, R2 or R3 residues into alternative Rl, R2 or R3 residues to give an alternative compound of formula II.<br>

The Agents of the Invention, as defined above, e.g., of formula I or n, particularly as exemplified, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, exhibit pharmacological activity and are useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g. for therapy, in the treatment of diseases and conditions as hereinafter set forth.<br>
Inositol phosphate formation assay:<br>
To determine antagonistic activity at the human parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (PcaR), compounds are tested in functional assays measuring the inhibition of calcium-induced inositol phosphate formation in CCL39 fibroblasts stably transfected with human PcaR.<br>
Cells are seeded into 24 well plates and grown to confluence. Cultures are then labelled with [ H]inositol (74 Mbq/ml) in serum-free medium for 24 h. After labelling, cells are washed once with a modified Hepes-buffered salt solution (mHBS: 130 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KC1, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgS04, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated with mHBS at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mM LiCl to block inositol monophosphatase activity. Test compounds are added 3 minutes before stimulating PcaR with 5.5 mM calcium and incubations continued for further<br><br>
20 min. Thereafter, cells are extracted with 10 mM ice-cold formic acid and inositol phosphates formed are determined using anion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation counting.<br>
Assay for intracellular free calcium:<br>
An alternative method to determine antagonism at the PcaR consists in measuring the inhibition of intracellular calcium transients stimulated by extracellular calcium. CCL39 fibroblasts stably transfected with human PcaR are seeded at 40'000 cells /well into 96-well Viewplates and incubated for 24 hours. Medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 2 µM Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), In routine experiments, cells are incubated at 37 °C, 5 % CO2 for 1 h. Afterwards, plates are washed twice with mHBS and wells are refilled with 100 1H1 mHBS containing the test compounds. Incubation is continued at room temperature for 15 minutes. To record changes of intracellular free calcium, plates are transferred to fluorescence-imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A baseline consisting in 5 measurements of 0.4 seconds each (laser excitation 488 nm) is recorded. Cells are then stimulated with calcium (2.5 mM final), and fluorescence changes recorded over a period of 3 minutes.<br>
When measured in the above assays, Agents of the Invention typically have IC50S in the range from about 50 |iM down to about 10 nM or less.<br>
It is now well established that controlled treatment of patients with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and analogues and fragments thereof can have a pronounced anabolic effect on bone formation. Thus compounds which promote PTH release, such as the Agents of the Invention may be used for preventing or treating conditions of bone which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable.<br>
Thus in a further aspect the invention includes a method for preventing or treating bone conditions which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone<br><br>
is desirable in which an effective amount of an Agent of the Invention is administered to a patient in need of such treatment.<br>
In a yet further aspect the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating bone conditions which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable comprising an Agent of the Invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier.<br>
Agents of the Invention are accordingly indicated for preventing or treating all bone conditions which are associated with increased calcium depletion or resorption or in which stimulation of bone formation and calcium fixation in the bone is desirable, e.g. osteoporosis of various genesis (e.g. juvenile, menopausal, postmenopausal, post-traumatic, caused by old age or by corticosteroid therapy or inactivity), fractures, osteopathy, including acute and chronic states associated with skeletal demineralisation, osteo-malacia, periodontal bone loss or bone loss due to arthritis or osteoarthritis or for treating hypoparathyroidism.<br>
Further diseases and disorders which might be prevented or treated include e.g. seizures, stroke, head trauma, spinal cord injury, hypoxia-induced nerve cell damage such as in cardiac arrest or neonatal distress, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, dementia, muscle tension, depression, anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, congestive heart failure; hypertension; gut motility disorders such as diarrhoea, and spastic colon and dermatological disorders, e.g. in tissue healing, for example burns, ulcerations and wounds.<br>
The Agents of the Invention are particularly indicated for preventing or treating osteoporosis of various genesis.<br><br>
For all the above uses, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 0.03 to about 300 mg preferably 0.03 to 30, more preferably 0.1 to 10 mg of a compound of the invention. Agents of the Invention may be administered twice a day or up to twice a week.<br>
The Agents of the Invention may be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. Such salts may be prepared in conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free compounds. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an Agent of the Invention in free base form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such compositions may be formulated in conventional manner. The Agents of the Invention may be administered by any conventional route, for example parenterally e.g. in form of injectable solutions or suspensions, enterally, e.g. orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules or in a transdermal, nasal or a suppository form.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing the present invention further provides:<br>
an Agent of the Invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use as a pharmaceutical;<br>
a method for preventing or treating above mentioned disorders and diseases in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of an Agent of the Invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
c) an Agent of the Invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition e.g. for use in the method as in b) above.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the Agents of the Invention may be employed as adjunct or adjuvant to other therapy, e.g. a therapy using a bone<br><br>
resorption inhibitor, for example as in osteoporosis therapy, in particular a therapy employing calcium, a calcitonin or an analogue or derivative thereof, e.g. salmon, eel or human calcitonin, a steroid hormone, e.g. an estrogen, a partial estrogen agonist or estrogen-gestagen combination, a SERM (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator) e.g. raloxifene, lasofoxifene, TSE-424, FC1271, Tibolone (Livial ®), vitamin D or an analogue thereof or PTH, a PTH fragment or a PTH derivative e.g. PTH (1-84), PTH (1-34), PTH (1-36), PTH (1-38), PTH (1-31)NH2 or PTS 893.<br>
When the Agents of the Invention are administered in conjunction with, e.g. as an adjuvant to bone resorption inhibition therapy, dosages for the co-administered inhibitor will of course vary depending on the type of inhibitor drug employed, e.g. whether it is a steroid or a calcitonin, on the condition to be treated, whether it is a curative or preventive therapy, on the regimen and so forth.<br><br>
