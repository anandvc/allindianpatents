Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S.<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/146,997, filed on August 3,<br>
1999.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process of preparing 1,5-<br>
diaryl-3-substituted pyrazoles of the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and are<br>
individually selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, amino, acetamido,<br>
phenyl, halo, hydroxy, lower alkylsulfonyl, lower<br>
alkylthio, nitro, trifluoromethyl, omega-trifluoromethyl<br>
lower alkoxy, or where R1, R2 or R3, R4 taken together with<br>
the phenyl group to which they are attached, form a<br>
naphthyl or substituted naphthyl group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a<br>
process of making 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-hydroxy-1-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl) -N-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-propanamide, a<br>
compound of formula la, known as tepoxalin.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I and method of making and<br>
using the compounds of formula I are described in US Patent<br>
4,826,868, issued May 2, 1989, incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
Tepoxalin is a potent inhibitor of both the<br>
cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of the arachidonic<br>
acid cascade (US Patent 4,826,868 and Robinson, c, Drugs<br>
of the Future, 15, 9. 902 (1990)).<br>
Known methods of synthesizing tepoxalin include the<br>
following. US Patent 4,826,868 describes reacting the<br>
alcohol, 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-<br>
pyrazole-3-propanol with Jones reagent to form the acid,<br>
5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-<br>
propanoic acid, which is reacted with dimethylformamide<br>
and oxalyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran ("THF") which is<br>
then reacted with methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride and<br>
triethylamine in THF.<br>
US Patent 4,898,952 describes a process for making<br>
tepoxalin which comprises reacting a hydrazine with a<br>
diketoacid to form a pyrazole acid which is reacted with<br>
dimethylformamide and oxalyl chloride to yield the<br>
pyrazole acid chloride which is reacted with methyl<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine to yield<br>
tepoxalin. The diketoacid is prepared by adding an<br>
appropriately substituted acetophenone to a solution of<br>
lithium diisopropylamide (LDA made from diisopropylamine<br>
and n-butyllithium in THF at low temperature) .<br>
Alternatively, lithium hexamethyl disilazide may be<br>
employed as the base in place of lithium diisopropylamide.<br>
Succinic anhydride is then added to this solution to<br>
produce the diketoacid.<br>
US Patent 5,117,054 describes a process wherein p-<br>
chloroacetophenone is reacted with succinic anhydride to<br>
form 4-chloro-?,e-dioxo-benzenehexanoic acid which is<br>
reacted with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride to yield<br>
5- [2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-oxoethylidene] dihydro-2 (3K)-<br>
furanone. This compound is then added to a mixture of N-<br>
methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride and an amine base such<br>
as triethylamine, Hunig's base, pyridine or lutidine and a<br>
solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform to form<br>
4-chloro-N-hydroxy-N-methyl-?,e-dioxo-benzenehexanamide<br>
which is combined with 4-methoxyphenyl hydrazine<br>
hydrochloride, an amine base as described above in an<br>
alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol or propanol.<br>
The preparation of 4-chloro-?,e-dioxo-benzenehexanoic<br>
acid from p-chloroacetophenone utilizing various bases<br>
selected from lithium diisopropylamide (LDA); LDA•LiCl;<br>
magnesium diisopropylamide (MDA) ; MDA•lLiBr; MDA•2LiBR or<br>
lithium bis (trimethylsilyl) amide was disclosed in Murray<br>
et al, Synthesis 1991, p. 18-20.<br>
Due to cost, toxicity, and hazard considerations, it<br>
is desirable to be able to synthesize 1,5-diaryl-3-<br>
substituted pyrazoles, particularly tepoxalin, without the<br>
reagents lithium hexamethyl disilazide, oxalyl chloride and<br>
methylene chloride and without excess p-chloroacetophenone.<br>
The current invention produces tepoxalin in a much<br>
higher over-all yield and at a decreased cost than the<br>
known processes.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>

In a particularly preferred embodiment/ the invention<br>
relates to a process of making tepoxalin (Ia), wherein R1<br>
is 4-OMe and R3 is 4-Cl, R2 is H and R4 is H.<br>
As set forth in Scheme 1, a compound of formula II, a<br>
known compound or compound prepared by known methods, is<br>
reacted with succinic anhydride and an alkoxide base such<br>
as Li, Na, or K tert-alkoxide, preferably K-tert-alkoxide,<br>
in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide,<br>
(DMF) or THF, preferably DMF, preferably at an initial<br>
temperature from about -5 to 20 °C, more preferably at 0-5<br>
°C, particularly preferred at 0 °C, then heating to a<br>
temperature of 45-50 °C preferably at 45 °C to form the<br>
corresponding compound of formula III.<br>
Preferably, 1 equivalent each of a compound of<br>
formula II, and succinic anhydride is reacted with 2<br>
equivalents of an alkoxide base.<br>
The compound of formula III is treated with, a<br>
compound of formula IV, a known compound or compound<br>
prepared by known methods, or preferably its HCl salt and<br>
a base such as KHCO3, NaHCO3, KOH, or NaOH, preferably<br>
NaHCO3, in a lower alcohol solvent such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, or 2-propanol, preferably methanol, preferably at<br>
a temperature of from about 45 to 55 °C, to form the<br>
corresponding compound of formula V. The compound of<br>
formula V is isolated by known methods preferably<br>
filtration to remove NaCl, seeding and cooling of the<br>
filtrate, and filtration to isolate the compound of<br>
formula V.<br>
The compound of formula V is reacted in an alcohol<br>
solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, or benzyl<br>
alcohol, preferably ethanol, with a catalytic amount of an<br>
acid, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or p-<br>
toluene sulfonic acid at reflux temperature to produce the<br>
corresponding ester of formula VI (methyl, ethyl,<br>
isopropyl, or benzyl with ethyl being preferred).<br>
The ester of formula VI is isolated by conventional<br>
means such as concentration, seeding, and filtration of<br>
the resulting solid. The ester of formula VI is treated<br>
with N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (as a solid or as<br>
an alcoholic solution which has been prepared from an<br>
aqueous solution) and a base such as sodium methoxide,<br>
sodium ethoxide, sodium benzyl oxide or, sodium<br>
isopropoxide (preferably sodium ethoxide) or N-methyl<br>
hydroxylamine free base (a known compound) in an alcoholic<br>
solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, or benzyl<br>

I. The product is isolated by known methods, preferably<br>
aqueous quench followed by filtration.<br>
Alternatively, the ester of formula VI is not<br>
isolated. In this case, the compound of formula V is<br>
treated with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, or benzyl alcohol, preferably ethanol, and a<br>
catalytic amount of an acid such as sulfuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, or p-toluene sulfonic acid and heated<br>
to reflux to form the ester of formula VI and the reaction<br>
cooled. The resulting solution of the ester of formula VI<br>
is reacted directly with N-methylhydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride (as a solid or as an alcoholic solution<br>
which has been prepared from an aqueous solution) and<br>
basified with an appropriate base such as sodium<br>
methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium benzyl oxide or, sodium<br>
isopropoxide, preferably sodium ethoxide, to produce the<br>
product of formula I. The product is isolated by known<br>
methods, preferably aqueous quench followed by filtration.<br>
Alternatively, neither the acid of formula V or the<br>
ester of formula VI is isolated, and the compound of<br>
formula III is converted (without isolation of V or VI) to<br>
product of formula I. In this case, the compound of<br>
formula III is treated with a compound of formula IV, a<br>
known compound or compound prepared by known methods, or<br>
preferably its HCl salt and a base such as KHCO3, NaHCO3,<br>
KOH, or NaOH, preferably NaOH, in a lower alcohol solvent<br>
such as MeOH, EtOH, or 2-propanol, preferably ethanol,<br>
preferably at a temperature of from about 20 to 55 °C<br>
(preferably at ambient temperature, approximately 25 °C) to<br>
form the corresponding compound of formula V. The<br>
resulting mixture of the compound of formula V is then<br>
treated with an acid, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric<br>
acid, or p-toluene sulfonic acid and heated to reflux to<br>
produce the corresponding ester of formula VI. The<br>
resulting reaction mixture of the ester of formula VI is<br>
then treated directly with N-methylhydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride (as a solid or as an alcoholic solution<br>
which has been prepared from an aqueous solution) and<br>
basified with an appropriate base such as sodium<br>
methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium benzyl oxide or, sodium<br>
isopropoxide, preferably sodium ethoxide, to produce the<br>
corresponding product of formula I. The product is<br>
isolated by known methods, preferably aqueous quench<br>
followed by filtration.<br>
In another embodiment, the claimed invention relates<br>
to a process of making an intermediate of formula III<br><br>
comprising reacting a compound of formula II with succinic<br>
anhydride in an alkoxide base.<br>
In addition, the claimed invention relates to a<br>
process for preparing 1,5-diaryl-3-substituted pyrazoles<br>
of formula I, particularly tepoxalin, comprising reacting<br>
a compound of formula V with an alcohol to form the<br>
corresponding ester of formula VI (where for example R =<br>
Me, Et, iPr, preferably Et) and reacting the corresponding<br>
ester of formula VI with N-methylhydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
This invention also relates to the novel intermediate<br>
of formula VI (where for example R is methyl, ethyl or<br>
isopropyl preferably ethyl).<br>
The following examples describe the invention in<br>
greater detail and are intended to illustrate the<br>
invention, but not to limit it.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
Potassium tert-butoxide (112.2 g, 1 mol) was<br>
dissolved in DMF (250 mL) and cooled to 0°C under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere, p-chloroacetophenone (77.3 g, 0.5<br>
mol) in DMF (50 mL) was added at 0°C over about 30 min then<br>
stirred at 0°C for 30 min. Succinic anhydride (50.0 g.<br>
0.5 mol) was dissolved in DMF (170 mL) at room temperature<br>
(heating may be needed to dissolve succinic anhydride in<br>
DMF. The solution should be cooled to room temperature<br>
before it is added to the enolate solution) and was added<br>
to the above enolate solution at 0-5°C over 80 min. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at 0-5° C for 25 min then<br>
heated to 55 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was<br>
quenched by adding water (400 mL) without external<br>
cooling; final temperature was about 52-55 °C. Immediately<br>
following the quench, the reaction mixture was acidified<br>
to pH 5 with cone. HCl; final temperature was about 55-56<br>
°C. The reaction mixture became a light brown cloudy<br>
solution. The mixture was stirred and cooled to 5-10 °C.<br>
The yellow solid product started forming at about 30 °C.<br>
The resulting yellow solid was collected by filtration and<br>
washed with water (300 mL). After most of the water was<br>
drained, the solid was washed with toluene (250 mL) to<br>
remove any residual p-chloroacetophenone and most of the<br>
color. The solid was air-dried overnight. Yield: 68.8 g<br>
(53%) .<br><br>
5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-<br>
propanoic acid (300 g, 840 mmol) and ethanol (3 L) were<br>
placed in a flask. Concentrated H2SO4 (2.4 mL, 86.4 meq.)<br>
was added with stirring. The reaction was then heated to<br>
reflux. After approximately 30 minutes, the suspension<br>
dissolved. The reaction was monitored by TLC (silica gel;<br>
hexane:ethylacetate:methanol;70:20:10) . After refluxing<br>
for 9 hours, all starting material was gone and 2 liters<br>
of ethanol was removed by distillation. The remaining<br>
solution was cooled with stirring to 0 °C and seeded with<br>
known ethyl-5- (4-chlorophenyl)-1- (4-methoxyphenyl) -1H-<br>
pyrazole-3-propanoate. The resulting suspension was<br>
stirred at 0 °C for 30 minutes and then filtered, washed<br>
with cold ethanol (100 mL) and vacuum dried (room<br>
temperature, ca. 5mm Hg) to give ethyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-<br>
1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-propanoate (275.0 g, 85%<br>
yield) as a clean white powder (mp = 80-81oC). An<br>
additional 27.9 g of ethyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-propanoate was obtained as a<br>
tan powder after reducing the volume of the mother liquor<br>
to approximately 100 mL and seeding with known ethyl-5-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl) -1- (4-methoxyphenyl) -1H-pyrazole-3-<br>
propanoate.<br><br>
a) An oven-dried 1000 ml 3-necked round bottomed flask was<br>
equipped with an oven dried magnetic stirring bar, argon<br>
inlet, drying tube, thermometer, and an oven-dried 250 mL<br>
addition funnel. The flask was cooled to room temperature<br>
while supplying a stream of dry argon. The flask was<br>
charged with dry ethanol (160 mL) (200 proof undenatured<br>
ethanol dried with 4 A molecular sieves was used) via the<br>
addition funnel, and N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride<br>
(16.3 gm; 0.195 mole) was added to the stirring solvent to<br>
produce a clear colorless solution. The resulting mixture<br>
was cooled with an ice-water bath (1.0°C) with stirring,<br>
and the addition funnel was charged with NaOEt (21 wt%,<br>
170 mL; 0.46 mole) . All of the NaOEt was added drop-wise<br>
to the cooled stirring solution of N-methylhydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride over a 30 minute period (NaCl precipitated<br>
during the course of the addition, and the temperature<br>
rose to 6.0°C) . After stirring the resulting slurry<br>
approximately 15 minutes, the ethyl ester (ethyl-5-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-<br>
propanoate) (50.0 gm; 0.13 mole) was added with good<br>
stirring. The resulting mixture was allowed to stir<br>
approximately 10 minutes, and then the reaction was<br>
allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The reaction was<br>
monitored by TLC (10% MeOH in CH2Cl2 for product, 50% EtOAc<br>
in hexane for starting material).<br>
b) The reaction was allowed to stir for 16 hrs. The<br>
magnetic stirring bar was removed, and the flask was<br>
equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a 500 mL addition<br>
funnel. The reaction was cooled (2.5°C) using an ice-water<br>
bath. The addition funnel was charged with a cooled (ice-<br>
water bath) mixture of glacial acetic acid (15 mL; 0.26<br>
mole) and 330 mL of distilled water. The aqueous acetic<br>
acid mixture was added drop-wise to the reaction mixture<br>
with good stirring over a 30 minute period. The<br>
temperature rose to 7.8°C during the course of the aqueous<br>
quench. After the addition of 155 mL of the aqueous<br>
acetic acid mixture, the reaction mixture turned into a<br>
clear brown solution. Product began to precipitate out<br>
slowly during the rest of the addition of the aqueous<br>
acetic acid mixture, and continued stirring and cooling<br>
after completion of the addition resulted in precipitation<br>
of more material. The pH at the end of the quench was<br>
between 6.4 - 6.8 as determined by litmus paper. The<br>
resulting milky brown mixture was stirred with continued<br>
cooling from the ice-water bath to allow full<br>
precipitation of the solid product. The ice-water bath<br>
was removed. The ethanol was removed from the reaction by<br>
distillation under vacuum (80 mm Hg) with heating up to<br>
34.4°C using a warm water bath. The mixture was cooled<br>
with an ice-water bath, and the pH was adjusted from 6.0<br>
to between 6.4-6.8 with the addition of 21 mL of 1N NaOH.<br>
The resulting mixture was stirred 30 minutes with cooling<br>
from the ice-water bath, and the product was isolated by<br>
filtration through a course rated sintered glass funnel.<br>
The isolated solids were washed with ice-cold distilled<br>
water (2 x 75 mL). The product was air dried and then<br>
placed in a vacuum oven at 60°C for 14.5 hours to provide<br>
crude tepoxalin as a light tan solid (4 8.38 gm; 96.5%<br>
yield).<br>
c) A 1000 mL round bottomed 3-necked flask was equipped<br>
with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and thermometer.<br>
The flask was charged with crude tepoxalin (48.18 gm;<br>
0.125 mole) and 190 mL of ethyl acetate. The mixture was<br>
heated to reflux with good stirring to produce an amber<br>
solution. The solution was filtered hot through celite<br>
into another 1000 mL flask (product crystalized out upon<br>
cooling during filtration). The filtrate was heated to<br>
reflux to produce a clear amber solution. The solution<br>
was cooled to ambient temperature with stirring to bring<br>
about crystallization. After stirring 2 hrs at ambient<br>
temperature, the mixture was cooled using an ice-water<br>
bath and stirred for 3 hrs. The mixture was filtered, and<br>
the collected solids were washed with ice-cold ethyl<br>
acetate (2 x 50 mL). The product was air dried, and<br>
placed in a vacuum oven. The product was dried in the<br>
vacuum at 60°C for 15 hrs to provide final product (45.08<br>
gm; 89.9% yield, &gt;99% HPLC wt% purity).<br><br>
a) An oven dried 300 mL 3-necked round bottomed flask was<br>
equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, argon inlet, and<br>
drying tube. The flask was charged with 5-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-propanoic<br>
acid (10 gm, 28.03 mmol) followed by ethanol (100 mL) .<br>
The resulting solution was cooled using an ice-water bath,<br>
the stirring solution was treated with concentrated H2SO4<br>
(0.07 mL, 2.52 meq.). The flask was then removed from the<br>
ice-water bath, the argon inlet and drying tube were<br>
removed, and the flask was equipped with a condenser and<br>
thermocouple. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux<br>
and monitored by TLC (using a 1:2:6 MeOH:EtOAc:hexane<br>
solvent system). After stirring at reflux for 5 hours,<br>
the reaction flask was fitted with a short path<br>
distillation apparatus and ethanol was distilled off (70<br>
mL). The resulting residue was cooled to 10 °C and treated<br>
dropwise with NaOEt (21 wt%, 37.7 mL, 101.04 mmol) . The<br>
resulting mixture was then treated with N-<br>
methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (3.51 gm; 42.05 mmol).<br>
The reaction flask was then re-equipped with a drying tube<br>
and argon inlet, and the reaction was stirred at ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
b) The reaction was allowed to stir for 18 hours at<br>
ambient temperature. TLC analysis (using 50% EtOAc in<br>
hexane and 10% methanol in CH2Cl2) showed completion of the<br>
reaction. The reaction flask was placed in an ice-water<br>
bath, and the reaction mixture was treated dropwise with a<br>
cooled (ice-water bath) mixture of glacial acetic acid<br>
(3.3 mL; 57.4 mmol) and 33 mL of distilled water. After<br>
completion of the addition of the aqueous acetic acid<br>
solution, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to between<br>
6.4 to 6.8 with 1N NaOH (litmus) . The mixture was then<br>
treated with additional distilled water (5 mL) where upon<br>
solid began to precipitate out. The reaction flask was<br>
then equipped with a short path distillation apparatus,<br>
and approximately 27 mL of solvent was removed (80 mm of<br>
Hg vacuum at 30-35 °C) . The pH of the resulting mixture<br>
was re-adjusted to between 6.4 to 6.8, and the mixture was<br>
allowed to stir with cooling from an ice-water bath for 30<br>
minutes. The solid was collected by filtration, and the<br>
solid product was washed with ice-cold distilled water.<br>
The air-dried product was then placed in a vacuum oven and<br>
dried for 18 hours at 60 °C under vacuum to give 9.51 gm of<br>
tepoxalin (87.9% yield, HPLC wt% purity of 98.6%).<br><br>
a) An oven-dried 250 mL 3-necked round bottomed flask<br>
was equipped with an argon inlet, drying tube, and<br>
magnetic stirring bar. A stream of dry argon was<br>
supplied, and the flask was charged with 4-chloro-?,e-<br>
dioxo-benzenehexanoic acid (10 gm; 39.27 mmol), p-methoxy<br>
phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride (11.32 gm; 42.78 mmol and<br>
anhydrous ethanol (80 mL, denatured with toluene). The<br>
resulting slurry was cooled with stirring using an ice-<br>
water bath. The mixture was treated with powdered NaOH<br>
(1.73 gm; 43.25 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 14 hours to bring about completion of the<br>
reaction (monitor the reaction by thin layer<br>
chromatography using 5% MeOH in methylene chloride<br>
developing the plate 4-5 times with U.V. detection). The<br>
reaction flask was fitted with a short path distillation<br>
apparatus, and solvent was removed under reduced pressure.<br>
(A vacuum of approximately 40 mm of Hg was used for the<br>
vacuum distillation.) The residue from the vacuum<br>
distillation was azeotropically dried with toluene (2 x 40<br>
mL). (A vacuum of approximately 40 mm of Hg was used for<br>
the azeotroping.) Ethanol (66 mL) was added to the<br>
residue, and the mixture was stirred to produce a fine<br>
suspension. The suspension was treated with concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid (0.1 mL; 3.6 meq), and the mixture was<br>
heated to reflux. The reaction was stirred at reflux for<br>
16 hours (the reaction mixture becomes very dark upon the<br>
addition of the sulfuric acid). Monitor the reaction by<br>
TLC (10% MeOH in methylene chloride). The solvent was<br>
then removed under reduced pressure via a short path<br>
distillation apparatus to produce an oily residue. (A<br>
vacuum of approximately 40 mm of Hg was used for the<br>
vacuum distillation.)<br>
The residue from the vacuum distillation was<br>
azeotropically dried with toluene using a short-path<br>
distillation apparatus (2 x 40 mL) . (A vacuum of<br>
approximately 40 mm of Hg was used for the azeotroping.<br>
The product crystallized out during the azeotroping<br>
process.) The resulting residue was diluted in ethanol<br>
(66 mL) , and the mixture was stirred at reflux for 1 hr.<br>
The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then to 5° C<br>
using an ice-water bath. The reaction was treated with N-<br>
methyl hydroxylamine HCl (4.92 gm; 58.91 mmol) followed<br>
immediately with NaOMe (33 mL of a 25 wt% solution; 144.21<br>
mmol) with drop-wise addition via an oven-dried dropping<br>
funnel over 20 minutes with, good stirring.<br>
b) The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 16 hrs (monitor the reaction with TLC 50%<br>
EtOAc in hexane). Solvent was removed from the reaction<br>
via a short path distillation apparatus under reduced<br>
pressure. (A vacuum of approximately 40 mm of Hg was used<br>
for the vacuum distillation). Ethanol (20 mL) was added to<br>
the thick reaction mixture to allow stirring. The<br>
reaction was cooled to 5°C using an ice-water bath and a<br>
solution of aqueous acetic acid (4.6 mL of glacial acetic<br>
acid; 80.04 mmol, in 66 mL of water) was slowly added.<br>
The reaction mixture turned clear, and the mixture was<br>
seeded with pure tepoxalin. Quenching the reaction with<br>
slow addition of the aqueous acetic acid solution with<br>
seeding (total addition time approximately 20 minutes) was<br>
continued. By the end of the addition, solid product<br>
precipitated out. The pH of the reaction was adjusted to<br>
between 6.8 - 7.0, and the resulting mixture was warmed to<br>
room temperature with stirring. (The pH of the<br>
reaction was adjusted from pH 9 to between 6.8 - 7.0 using<br>
glacial acetic acid.)<br>
The resulting slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1<br>
hr, and ethanol was removed from the reaction at reduced<br>
pressure via a short path distillation apparatus. (A<br>
vacuum of approximately 40 mm of Hg was used for the<br>
vacuum distillation with a maximum temperature of 28°C<br>
being obtained.) The pH of the reaction was adjusted to<br>
between 6.8 - 7.0, and the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
for 2 hrs in an ice-water bath. The mixture was filtered<br>
through a coarse rated sintered glass funnel and the solid<br>
was washed with distilled water (5 x 60 mL). The<br>
collected solid was air dried, and then the solid was<br>
dried under vacuum at 65°C for 12 hrs to obtain crude<br>
tepoxalin (13.09 gm; 86.39% crude yield; HPLC wt% purity<br>
of 95.26%) as a brown solid.<br>
c) A 250 mL round-bottomed three necked flask equipped<br>
with magnetic stirring bar and condenser was charged with<br>
crude tepoxalin (12.90 gm). The crude product was treated<br>
with EtOAc (50 mL), and the resulting slurry was heated to<br>
reflux to produce a clear dark-brown solution. The hot<br>
solution was filtered through celite, and the celite was<br>
washed with hot EtOAc (5 mL). (Product crystallized out<br>
during filtration.) The filtrate was heated to reflux to<br>
dissolve product that had crystallized out, and the<br>
mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature. The<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.0 hr and<br>
then with cooling from an ice-water bath for 2 hrs. The<br>
resulting solid was collected by filtration and the<br>
product was washed with ice-cold EtOAc (3 x 13 mL) . After<br>
air-drying, the product was oven dried at 70°C for 42 hrs<br>
to produce purified tepoxalin (11.25 gm) as a slightly<br>
brown solid (87.21% recovery, &gt;99.9% HPLC wt% purity).<br>
