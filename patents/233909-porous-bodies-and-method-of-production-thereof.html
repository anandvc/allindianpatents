POROUS BODIES AND METHOD OF PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to water soluble or water dispersible porous bodies and to methods of producing such porous bodies.<br>
 5<br>
Copending international-patent-application PCT/GB03/03226 (assigned to the present applicants) describes the formation of porous beads comprising a three dimensional open-cell lattice of a water-soluble polymeric material with an average bead diameter in the range 0.2 to 5mm.<br>
10	 It is an object of the present invention to provide highly porous bodies which disperse rapidly when contacted with water. It is a further object of the invention to provide a simple and effective method for producing such porous bodies.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided water dispersible or water soluble 15   	  porous bodies comprising a three dimensional open-cell lattice containing<br>
(a)	10 to 95% by weight of a water soluble polymeric material and<br>
(b)	5 to 90% by weight of a surfactant,<br>
said porous bodies having an intrusion volume as measured by mercury porosimetry (as hereinafter described) of at least-abet*3 ml/g <br>
20  	   with the proviso that said porous bodies are not spherical beads having an average bead diameter of0.2to5mm<br>
Preferably the porous bodies of the present invention contain 10 to 80% by weight of the water soluble polymeric material and 20 to 90% by weight of the surfactant More preferably the porous<br>
2	5  	   bodies of the present invention contain 20 to 70% by weight of the water soluble polymeric  material<br>
and 30 to 80% by weight of the surfactant<br>
The polymeric material is a material which would be considered as "water soluble" by those skilled in the art i.e. if it forms a homogeneous solution in water.  In general terms water soluble polymers<br>
3	0      possess pendant polar or ignitable groups (e.g. -C=0, -OH, -N(R1)(R2) in which R1 and R2 which<br>
may be the same or different are independently H or (C1 to C4)alkyl, -N(R3)(R4)(R5)+ which R3 ,R4 and R5 which may be the same or different are independently H or (C1 to C4)alkyl, -CON(R6)(R7) in which R6 and R7, which may be the same or different are H or (C1 to C4) alkyl, -CH2CH2O-, -CO2H or salts thereof, -SO3H or salts thereof groups) on a backbone chain which may be                                                       <br><br>

AMENDED SHEET	<br>
It is also important for the operation of the present invention that the porous bodies dissolve or disperse quickly so that the materials contained within the lattice are dispersed quickly when the porous bodies are exposed to an aqueous medium. It has been found that when water soluble polymeric materials are incorporated into the porous bodies of the present invention, the time it <br>
5 	takes for the polymeric material to dissolve or disperse may be significantly reduced. The nature of the lattice should be such that the dissolution or dispersion of the porous bodies preferably occurs in less than three minutes, more preferably less than two minutes, most preferably less than one minute.<br>

The bulk density of the porous polymeric bodies is preferably in the range of from about 0.01 to about 02 g/cm3, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.09 g/cm3, and most preferably from about 0.03 to about 0.08 g/cm3.<br>
5 	The porous bodies of #« present invention may be formed by freezing an intimate mixture (for example an emulsion) of the polymeric material and the surfactant in a liquid medium and freeze drying the resulting frozen mixture.<br>
The porous bodies of the present invention disperse when exposed to an aqueous medium.	By<br>
10       including a water soluble polymeric material and a surfactant in the lattice of the porous bodies  <br>
porous bodies are formed which dissolve or disperse rapidly in aqueous media The polymeric material, surfactant and any other components carried in the porous bodies will therefore become dispersed/dissolved when the bodies are exposed to an aqueous medium. The provision of the porous bodies of the present invention facilitates the dissolution or dispersion of the materials<br>
15     contained in the porous bodies and the dissolution/dispersion is more rapid than is observed when <br>
the same materials are used but are not in the  porous bodies of the present invention. The porous bodies of tine present invention may therefore be used to f facilitate the dissolution or dispersion of polymeric materials or surfactants. For example, surfactants may be Incorporated into porous bodies of the present invention which will disperse at lower temperature and/or more easily than <br>
20    possible up to now. This is particularly beneficial when the surfactant is being used for defeats cleaning tasks such as for cleaning delicate fabrics or where only cold water is available for use in the cleaning process.<br>
The present invention also includes, in a further aspect, solutions or dispersions comprising wafer <br>
25     	soluble polymeric materials and surfactant formed by exposing the porous bodies of tine present invention to an aqueous medium<br>
     The porous bodies of fine present invention may include within the lattice hydrophobic materials<br>
which will be dispersed when the polymeric bodies are dispersed in an aqueous medium.<br>
30	The hydrophobic materials may be incorporated into the lattice by dissolving them in the         <br>
              discontinuous oil phase of an oil-in-water emulsion from which the lattice is made.It has been found<br>
that the dispersion into an aqueous medium of hydrophobic materials contained within the porous bodies of the present invention is much improved when the porous bodies are exposed to the aqueous medium.<br><br>

The present invention also includes, in a further aspect, solutions or dispersions comprising water soluble polymeric materials, surfactant and a hydrophobic material formed by exposing the porous bodies of the present invention having the hydrophobic material contained therein  to an aqueous medium. <br>
5<br>
There are many instances to personal care products such as deodorants skin and hair cleaning or care products or m household products such as laundry cleaning and care  products or household cleaning or care products for hard and soft surfaces where a is desirable to administer hydrophobic materials in an aqueous environment Because of the hydrophobic nature of these materials they <br>
10	 are often reluctant to disperse in an aqueous environment The use of the porous bodes of the present invention felicitates this dispersion and in many cases enables hydrophobic materials to be dispersed more effectively than previously.<br>
It may be required to disperse fie hydrophobic materials at the point where the product is being <br>
15   	  used. In this case the porous bodies of the present invention will be contained in the product until it  is used by exposing it to an aqueous environmental, at  which time the water-soluble/dispersible  of the porous body will break down releasing the hydrophobic material<br><br>
The porous bodes of the present invention may be used to introduce hydrophobic materials into<br>
20       products, for example, liquid products during the manufacture of the products.  In this case           <br>
lattice of the porous bodies of the present invention will break down when the porous bodies contact an aqueous environment during manufacture releasing the hydrophobic material in a form in which it can be more readily incorporated into the product being manufactured. <br>
25    	The porous bodies of the present invention may be used to transport materials to sites where they<br>
can be incorporated into products. By converting liquid products into porous bodies the need to<br>
transport large amounts of Squids can be avoided resulting in significant cost saving and safer<br>
transport of materials which are potentiatyha2ardous when transported in a liquid form.	Materials<br>
which would be potentially unstable if stored or transported in liquid form  may incorporated into<br>
30     the porous bodies of the present invention and stored or transported with Jess risk of degradation.<br>
The incorporation of potentially unstable hydrophobic materials, for Example vaccines, vitamins or perfumes, into the porous bodies of the present 'invention may protect them from degradation during storage prior to use.<br><br>
