FUEL ECONOMY INDICATOR LAMP CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/816,686, filed on June 27, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to hybrid vehicles, and more<br>
particularly to a fuel economy indicator lamp control system for a hybrid<br>
vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Hybrid vehicles are driven by multiple powerplants including,<br>
but not limited to an internal combustion engine and an electric machine. The<br>
electric machine functions as a motor/generator. In a generator mode, the<br>
electric machine is driven by the engine to generate electrical energy used to<br>
power electrical loads or charge batteries. In a motor mode, the electric<br>
machine supplements the engine, providing drive torque to drive the vehicle<br>
drivetrain.<br>
[0004] Improved fuel economy (FE) and ecological sentiment are<br>
motivating factors for hybrid vehicle purchase. Traditionally, hybrid<br>
manufacturers provide a labeled FE ratings including city and highway FE<br>
ratings. Although the label FE, as well as real-world fuel economy, of hybrid<br>
vehicles is usually higher than those of their non-hybrid counterparts, hybrid<br>
vehicles have been criticized for lower than expected FE.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a fuel economy<br>
(FE) indicator lamp regulation system for a hybrid electric vehicle having an<br>
internal combustion engine. The FE indicator lamp regulation system<br>
includes an FE indicator lamp, a first module that calculates an instantaneous<br>
FE of the hybrid electric vehicle and a second module that determines a j<br>
velocity of the hybrid electric vehicle. A third module switches the FE '<br>
indicator lamp between an on state and an off state based on the<br>
instantaneous FE and the vehicle speed.<br>
[0006] In another feature, the FE indicator lamp is switched to the<br>
off state when the velocity is outside of a velocity range that is defined<br>
between a minimum velocity threshold and a maximum velocity threshold.<br>
[0007] In another feature, the third module determines an FE<br>
threshold based on the velocity and switches the FE indicator lamp to the on<br>
state when the instantaneous FE remains above the FE threshold for a<br>
threshold time period.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the third module determines an FE<br>
threshold based on the velocity and switches the FE indicator lamp to the off<br>
state when the instantaneous FE remains below the FE threshold for a<br>
threshold time period.<br>
[0009] In another feature, the third module initiates an off timer upon<br>
switching the FE indicator lamp to the off state, wherein switching of the<br>
indicator lamp to the on state is inhibited until the off timer achieves a<br>
threshold time.<br>
[0010] In still another feature, the FE indicator lamp regulation<br>
system further includes a fourth module that selectively initiates a hybrid<br>
engine off mode. The third module switches the FE indicator lamp to the on<br>
state when in the hybrid engine off mode for a threshold time period.<br><br>
[0011] In yet other features, the FE indicator lamp regulation system<br>
further includes a fourth module that monitors an accelerator pedal position.<br>
The third module switches the FE indicator lamp to the off state when the<br>
instantaneous FE is below a threshold FE for a threshold time. The threshold<br>
time is determined based on the accelerator pedal position. More specifically,<br>
the threshold time is reduced when the accelerator pedal position exceeds a<br>
threshold accelerator pedal position.<br>
[0012] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br>

[0013] The present disclosure will become more fully understood<br>
from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

[0018] Figure 5 is a functional block diagram of exemplary modules<br>

disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure,<br>
its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers<br>
will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the<br>
term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary hybrid vehicle 10<br>
includes an engine 12 and an electric machine 14, which drive a transmission<br>
16. More specifically, the electric machine 14 supplements the engine 12 to<br>
produce drive torque to drive the transmission 16. In this manner, fuel<br>
efficiency is increased and emissions are reduced. The engine 12 and<br>
electric machine 14 are coupled via a belt-alternator-starter (BAS) system 18.<br>
More specifically, the electric machine 14 operates as a starter (i.e., motor)<br>
and an alternator (i.e., generator) and is coupled to the engine 12 through a<br>
belt and pulley system. The engine 12 and the electric machine 14 include<br>
pulleys 20, 22, respectively, that are coupled for rotation by a belt 24. The<br>
pulley 20 is coupled for rotation with a crankshaft 26 of the engine 12.<br><br>
[0021] In one mode, the engine 12 drives the electric machine 14 to<br>
generate power used to recharge an energy storage device (ESD) 28. In<br>
another mode, the electric machine 14 drives the engine 12 using energy from<br>
the ESD 28. The ESD 28 can include, but is not limited to, a battery or a<br>
super-capacitor. Alternatively, the BAS system 18 can be replaced with a<br>
flywheel-alternator-starter (FAS) system (not shown), which includes an<br>
electric machine operably disposed between the engine and the transmission<br>
or a chain or gear system that is implemented between the electric machine<br>
14 and the crankshaft 26.<br>
[0022] The transmission 16 can include, but is not limited to, a<br>
manual transmission, an automatic transmission, a continuously variable<br>
transmission (CVT) and an automated manual transmission (AMT). Drive<br>
torque is transferred from the engine crankshaft 26 to the transmission 16<br>
through a coupling device 30. The coupling device 30 can include, but is not<br>
limited to, a friction clutch or a torque converter depending upon the type of<br>
transmission implemented. The transmission 16 multiplies the drive torque<br>
through one of a plurality of gear ratios to drive a driveshaft 32.<br>
[0023] A control module 34 regulates operation of the vehicle 10.<br>
The control module 34 controls fuel injection and spark to selectively activate<br>
and deactivate cylinders of the engine 12. More specifically, when the vehicle<br>
10 is at rest, none of the cylinders of the engine 12 are firing (i.e., are<br>
deactivated) and the engine 12 is stopped. During vehicle launch (i.e.,<br>
acceleration from rest), the electric machine 14 drives the crankshaft to spin-<br>
up the engine 12 to an idle RPM and to initiate vehicle acceleration. During<br>
periods where low drive torque is needed to drive the vehicle (i.e., a hybrid<br>
engine off (HEOff) mode), drive torque is provided by the electric machine 14.<br>
When in the HEOff mode, fuel and spark are cut-off to the cylinders of the<br>
engine. Further, opening and closing cycles of the intake and exhaust valves<br>
can be prevented to inhibit air flow processing within the cylinders.<br><br>
[0024] An accelerator pedal 36 is provided. A pedal position sensor<br>
36 is sensitive to a position of the accelerator pedal 36 and generates a pedal<br>
position signal based thereon. A brake pedal 40 is provided. A brake pedal<br>
position sensor 42 is sensitive to a position of the brake pedal 40 and<br>
generates a pedal position signal based thereon. The control module 34<br>
operates a brake system 43 based on the brake pedal position signal to adjust<br>
a pressure within the brake system, which in turn regulates a braking force of<br>
brakes (not shown). A speed sensor 44 is responsive to the rotational speed<br>
(RPMEM) of the electric machine 44. The speed sensor 44 generates a speed<br>
signal. The control module 34 operates the vehicle 10 based on the pedal<br>
position signals generated by the pedal position sensors 38, 42 and the speed<br>
signal generated by the speed sensor 44, as described in further detail below.<br>
The engine speed (RPMENG) can be determined based on the speed signal.<br>
More specifically, RPMEM can be multiplied by the known pulley ratio to<br>
provide RPMENG-<br>
[0025] An instrument panel is also provided and includes a fuel<br>
economy (FE) telltale or indicator lamp 50 that is selectively lit when the<br>
vehicle is operating within a desired FE range. More specifically, the FE<br>
indicator lamp control of the present disclosure recognizes that FE feedback<br>
from the vehicle's instrument panel can be helpful in improving customers'<br>
driving style to achieve better fuel economy. Accordingly, the FE indicator<br>
lamp control determines whether the vehicle is operating at good or desired<br>
FE and illuminates the indicator lamp 50 accordingly. Anti-busy control is also<br>
implemented to inhibit flashing of the FE indicator lamp 50.<br>
[0026] The FE indicator lamp illumination control qualifies the good<br>
or desired FE using one or more pre-determined criteria. For example, the<br>
good FE is based on the vehicle's ideal capabilities as a function of vehicle<br>
speed. As shown in Figure 2, the vehicle's ideal (e.g., no wind, grade or<br>
acceleration) FE as a function of vehicle speed (VVEH) is provided. Whenever<br>
the instantaneous FE is greater than a threshold value at the respective VVEH,<br><br>
the FE indicator lamp 50 is illuminated. More specifically, the FE indicator<br>
lamp 50 is illuminated whenever the FE is within the shaded region. Although<br>
an indicator lamp 50 is described, it is also anticipated that a digital read-out<br>
of the instantaneous FE can also be provided, so that the driver is aware of<br>
the actual FE value at any moment.<br>
[0027] In one alternative, if the vehicle is able to achieve the HWY<br>
label value at the ideal condition, the HWY label value is used as the<br>
threshold. If only the CITY label value can be achieved under the ideal<br>
condition, the CITY label value is used as the threshold. In another<br>
alternative, the CITY label value is used as the threshold at lower speeds, and<br>
the HWY label value is used as the threshold at higher speeds. For example,<br>
below a city speed (e.g., 45 mph), the CITY label value is the threshold, and<br>
at speeds above a highway speed (e.g., 60 mph), the HWY label value is the<br>
threshold. At speeds between the city and highway speeds, the threshold<br>
value is linearly interpolated across the CITY and the HWY label values.<br>
[0028] In addition to steady FE thresholds, the indicator lamp 50 is<br>
also illuminated during operation in hybrid fuel-off, regenerative braking,<br>
HEOff, electric creep and the like, to coach the vehicle operator to achieve<br>
better FE. More specifically, when the fuel is cut, for example, the calculated<br>
FE saturates at an upper limit (e.g., 199.9 mpg). For fuel-on operation, the<br>
indicator lamp 50 is not illuminated for vehicle speeds under a lower threshold<br>
(VMIN) (e.g., 20 mph), because the instantaneous FE value changes very<br>
rapidly with vehicle speed and driver input. However, the indicator lamp 50 is<br>
illuminated at vehicle speeds at or under the lower threshold if the fuel is off.<br>
On the other end of the speed spectrum, the indicator lamp 50 is not<br>
illuminated during fuel-on operation at speeds at or above an upper threshold<br>
(VMAX) (e.g., 75 mph). In this manner, the vehicle operator is not encouraged<br>
to drive at over speed limits.<br><br>
[0029] The FE indicator lamp control implements an anti-busy<br>
control to prevent flashing of the indicator lamp. The anti-busy calibrations<br>
include, but are not limited to, a minimum/maximum VVEH and hysteresis on<br>
the minimum/maximum VVEH, a minimum off time (t0FFTHR), a minimum on time<br>
(toNTHFt), minimum wait times (twAm, tWAiT2), upper and lower FE thresholds as<br>
a function of VVEH and FE value freezing during transmission shifts.<br>
[0030] Once the indicator lamp 50 is turned off, it remains off for<br>
toFFTHR- Similarly, once the indicator lamp 50 is turned on, it remains on for<br>
toNTHR- In this manner, flashing of the indicator lamp 50 is prohibited. When<br>
entering the HEOff mode, and assuming that the indicator lamp 50 is not on,<br>
the indicator lamp 50 is turned on after twAiT- Again, flashing of the indicator<br>
lamp 50 is prohibited in the event that the HEOff mode is exited shortly upon<br>
being initiated.<br>
[0031] Under conditions where the driver steps into the accelerator<br>
and the accelerator pedal position is deemed high, toFFTHR is replaced by an<br>
accelerator pedal related time (tAp), which is less than toFFTHR- In this manner,<br>
the indicator lamp 50 is turned off more rapidly when the driver steps into the<br>
accelerator pedal. It is also anticipated that the instantaneous FE value is<br>
frozen during transmission shifts, to prevent the transient shift condition from<br>
influencing the indicator lamp on/off decision.<br>
[0032] Referring now to Figure 3, an exemplary driving cycle is<br>
illustrated, wherein an FE of 29 miles-per-gallon (mgp) is provided as an<br>
upper FE threshold and an FE of 27 mpg is provided as a lower FE threshold.<br>
During an initial period A, the indicator lamp 50 is illuminated, as indicated by<br>
an indicator lamp flag (FLAGIL) being set equal to 1. A first wait timer (tWAm)<br>
trace has achieved a maximum (tMAxi) because the indicator lamp 50 has<br>
been illuminated for tMAxi, indicating that that the indicator lamp 50 could be<br>
immediately turned off if the FE falls below the lower FE threshold for a<br>
sufficient time, as discussed in further detail below.<br><br>
[0033] During a subsequent period B, the FE oscillates between the<br>
upper and lower FE thresholds. Each time the FE falls below the lower FE<br>
threshold, a second wait tinner (twArre) is initiated. If the FE goes back above<br>
the lower FE threshold, tWAiT2 is reset to zero. During the period C, the FE<br>
remains below the lower FE threshold for a sufficient time (i.e., twArre is equal<br>
to tMAX2), and the indicator lamp 50 is switched off, as indicated by FLAGu<br>
going to zero. At the same point, twAin is reset to zero and begins running<br>
again toward tMAxi ■<br>
[0034] At the beginning of the period D, the FE has remained above<br>
the upper FE threshold for a sufficient time period, and the indicator lamp 50<br>
is again illuminated. twAiT2 is concurrently reset to zero. At the beginning of<br>
the period E, the FE has remained below the lower FE threshold for a<br>
sufficient time period (i.e., twArre is equal to twiAX2), and the indicator lamp is<br>
switched off.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
indicator lamp illumination control will be described in detail. In step 400,<br>
control determines whether the HEOff mode is active. If the HEOff mode is<br>
active, control continues in step 402. If the HEOff mode is not active, control<br>
continues in step 404. Control determines whether VVEH is within a velocity<br>
range that is defined between VMAX and VM|N in step 404. If VVEH is not within<br>
the velocity range, control continues in step 402. If VVEH is within the velocity<br>
range, control continues in step 406.<br>
[0036] In step 402, control determines whether the indicator lamp<br>
50 is illuminated. If the indicator lamp 50 is not illuminated, control ends. If<br>
the indicator lamp 50 is illuminated, control initiates a timer (t) in step 408. In<br>
step 410, control determines whether t is equal to t0FFTHR. If t is not equal to<br>
toFFTHR, control increments t in step 412 and loops back to step 410. If t is<br>
equal to toFFTHR, control turns the indicator lamp 50 off in step 414 and control<br>
ends. By delaying the turning off of the indicator lamp 50 by toFFTHR, it is<br><br>
ensured that the indicator lamp 50 remains on for at least toFFTHR to prohibit<br>
flashing of the indicator lamp 50.<br>
[0037] In step 406, control determines whether the FE is sufficiently<br>
good to warrant illumination of the indicator lamp 50. A good FE is<br>
determined as described above. More specifically, a good threshold is<br>
provided based on one of the ideal FE for a given VVEH, the HWY label or the<br>
CITY label. If the FE is deemed not good, control continues in step 402. If<br>
the FE is deemed good, control continues in step 416.<br>
[0038] In step 416, control determines whether the indicator lamp<br>
50 is illuminated. If the indicator lamp 50 is illuminated, control ends. If the<br>
indicator lamp 50 is not illuminated, control initiates t in step 418. In step 420,<br>
control determines whether t is equal to t0NTHR- If t is not equal to toNTHR,<br>
control increments t in step 422 and loops back to step 420. If t is equal to<br>
toNTHR, control turns the indicator lamp 50 on in step 424 and control ends. By<br>
delaying the turning off of the indicator lamp 50 by t0NTHR, it is ensured that the<br>
indicator lamp 50 remains on for at least toNTHR to prohibit flashing of the<br>
indicator lamp 50.<br>
[0039] Referring now to Figure 5, exemplary modules that execute<br>
the indicator lamp illumination control will be described in detail. The<br>
exemplary modules include a VVEH determining module 500, an FE<br>
determining module 502, an indicator lamp control module 504, a HEOff<br>
module 506 and an accelerator pedal module 508. The VVEH determining<br>
module 500 determines VVEH based on a vehicle operating parameter or<br>
parameters. For example, VVEH can be determined based on a transmission<br>
output shaft speed signal (TOSS) and or ABS signals provided by ABS<br>
sensors associated with each wheel of the hybrid vehicle.<br><br>
[0040] The FE determining module 502 determines the<br>
instantaneous FE based on a plurality of vehicle operating conditions<br>
including, but not limited to, an engine RPM, a manifold absolute pressure<br>
(MAP), a throttle position signal (TPS) and VVEH- The indicator lamp control<br>
module 504 regulates the on and off state of the indicator lamp 50 based on<br>
the signals from the various other modules, in accordance with the indicator<br>
lamp illumination control described in detail above.<br>
[0041] The HEOff module 506 regulates whether to operate the<br>
hybrid electric vehicle in the HEOff mode and generates corresponding<br>
control signals, as well as a signal that is received by the indicator lamp<br>
control module 504. The accelerator pedal module 508 monitors an<br>
accelerator pedal position signal (APS) and generates a signal that is<br>
received by the indicator lamp control module 504 when the APS exceeds a<br>
threshold value.<br>
[0042] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
FUEL ECONOMY INDICATOR LAMP CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
A fuel economy (FE) indicator lamp regulation system for a hybrid electric<br>
vehicle (10) having an internal combustion engine (12) includes an FE<br>
indicator lamp (50), a first module (502) that calculates an instantaneous FE<br>
of the hybrid electric vehicle and a second module (500) that determines a<br>
velocity VVEH the hybrid electric vehicle. A third module (504) switches the FE<br>
indicator lamp (50) between an on state and an off state based on the<br>
instantaneous FE and the vehicle speed.</td>
