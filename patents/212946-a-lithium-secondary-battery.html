LITHIUM SECONDARY BATTERY<br>
[Field of Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a lithium secondary battery having excellent battery characteristics in cycle performance, electric capacity and storage property.<br>
[Background of Invention]<br>
Recently, a lithium secondary battery is generally employed as an electric source for driving small elec¬tronic devices.  The lithium secondary battery essential¬ly comprises a positive electrode, a nonaqueous electro¬lytic solution, and a negative electrode. A lithium secondary battery utilizing a positive electrode of lith¬ium compound oxide such as LiCoO2 and a negative electrode of carbonaceous material or lithium metal is favorably used. As the electrolytic solution for the lithium sec¬ondary battery, a carbonate such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC) is favorably used.<br>
Nevertheless, it is desired to provide a secondary battery showing improved characteristics in the cycle performance and electric capacity.<br>
A lithium secondary battery utilizing a positive electrode of LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 or LiNiO2 sometimes shows decrease of electric performances because a portion of the nonaqueous solvent in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution oxidatively decomposes in the course of charging and hence the produced deconposition product disturbs the desired electrochemical reaction.  The decomposition is considered to be caused by electrochemical oxidation of the solvent on the interface between the positive elec¬trode and the nonaqueous electrolytic solution.<br>
On the other hand, a lithium secondary battery uti¬lizing a negative electrode of carbonaceous material of<br><br>
high crystallization such as natural graphite or artifi¬cial graphite also shows decrease of electric performanc¬es because a solvent of the electrolytic solution reduc-tively decomposes on the surface of the negative elec¬trode in the course of charging. The reductive decompo-sition also occurs in the repeated charging-discharging procedures when EC (which is generally employed as the nonaqueous solvent of the electrolytic solution) is uti¬lized as the nonaqueous solvent.<br>
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication 10-74537 describes that the cycle performance and electric capaci¬ty are improved when a small amount of an aromatic com¬pound such as benzene having a hydrocarbon substituent (e.g./ cyclohexylbenzene) .<br>
Japanese Patent Provisional Publication 10-112335 describes that the cycle performance is improved when a small amount of a fluorine atom-containing aromatic com-pound such as f luorobenzene is added to a nonaqueous electrolytic solution of a lithium secondary battery.<br>
[Disclosure of Invention]<br>
The present invention has an object to provide a lithium secondary battery showing improved battery cycle performance, improved electric capacity, and improved storability in the charged condition.<br>
The present invention resides in a lithium secondary battery comprising a positive electrode, a negative elec¬trode of artificial graphite or natural graphite and a nonaqueous electrolytic solution having an electrolyte dissolved in a nonaqueous solvent, wherein 0.1 to 20 wt.% of a cyclohexylbenzene having a halogen atom bonded to a benzene ring thereof is contained in the nonaqueous elec¬trolytic solution.<br>
The cyclohexylbenzene having a halogen atom bonded to a benzene ring thereof employed in the invention pre¬ferably is a conpound having the following formula (I):<br><br><br>
wherein X is a halogen atom, and the halogen atom is attached to an optional position.<br>
Preferred is l-halogeno-4-cyclohexylbenzene.<br>
[Detailed Explanation of the Invention]<br>
In the cyclohexylbenzene having a halogen atom bond¬ed to a benzene ring thereof (hereinafter referred to as "cyclohexyl-halogenobenzene") contained in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing an electrolyte dissolved in a nonaqueous solvent, the halogen atom preferably is a fluorine atom or a chlorine atom.<br>
Exanples of the cyclohexyl-halogenobenzenes include 1 - f luoro- 2 - cyclohexylbenzene, 1 - f luoro- 3 -cyclohexyl -benzene, 1 - f luoro - 4 - eye lohexylbenzene, 1 - chloro - 4 -cyclohexylbenzene, l-bromo-4-cyclohexylbenzene, and 1-iodo - 4 - eye lohexylbenzene.<br>
If the content of the cyclohexyl-halogenobenzene in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution is extremely large, the battery performances may lower.  If the content of the cyclohexyl-halogenobenzene is extremely small, an expected improvement of the battery performances cannot be attained. Accordingly, the content preferably is in the range of 0.1-20 wt.%, more preferably 0.2-10 wt.%, most preferably 0.5-5 wt.%, based on the amount of the nonaqueous electrolytic solution, so that the cycle per¬formance can well improved.<br>
Examples of the non-aqueous solvents employed in the electrolytic solution of the invention are cyclic carbon¬ates such as ethylene carbonate (EC) , propylene carbonate (PC), butylene carbonate (BC), and vinylene carbonate (VC) , lactones such as y-butyrolactone, linear carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC) , methyl ethyl carbonate<br><br>
(MEC),  and diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethers such as tetra-hydrofuran, 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2- diethoxyethane, and 1,2- dibutoxy-ethane, nitriles such as acetonitrile and adiponitrile, esters such as methyl propionate, methyl pivalate, butyl pivalate, octyl pivalate and dimethyl oxalate, amides such as dimethylformamide, and compounds containing S=0 group such as 1,3-propanesultone, glycol sulfite and divinyl sulfone.<br>
The non-aqueous solvents can be employed singly or in combination of two or more.  There are no specific limitations with respect to the combination of the non¬aqueous solvents. Examples of the combinations include a combination of a cyclic carbonate and a linear carbonate, a combination of a cyclic carbonate and a lactone, and a combination of plural cyclic carbonates and linear car¬bonates .<br>
Exanples of the electrolytes employed in the inven¬tion include LiPFg, LiBF4, LiC104, LiN(SO2CF3) 2, LiN(SO2C2F5)2, LiC(SO2CF3)3, LiPF4(CF3)2, LiPF3 (C2F5) 3, LiPF3(CF3)3, LiPF3(iso-C3F7)3, and LiPF5(iso-C3F7) .  These electrolytes can be employed singly or in combination of two or more.  The electrolyte can be incorporated into the nonaqueous solvent generally in such an amount as to give an electrolytic solution of 0.1 M to 3 M, preferably 0.5 M to 1.5 M.<br>
The electrolytic solution of the invention can be prepared, for instance, by mixing the above-mentioned non-aqueous solvents; dissolving the above-mentioned electrolyte in the mixture; and further dissolving at least one of the above-mentioned cyclohexyl-halogeno-benzenes in the resulting mixture.<br>
For instance, the active material of positive elec¬trode is a compound metal oxide comprising lithium and cobalt or nickel. The active material of positive elec¬trode can be used singly or in combination.  Examples of<br><br>
the compound metal oxides include LiCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiCO1-xNixO2 (0.01<x these compounds can be employed in an optional combination such as a of licoo2 and limn2o4 linio2 com linio2.></x>
The positive electrode can be manufactured by knead¬ing the above-mentioned active material of positive elec¬trode, an electro-conductive material such as acetylene black or carbon black, and a binder such as poly(tetra-fluoroethylene) (PTFE) or poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), to give a positive electrode composition; coating the positive electrode conposition on a collector such as aluminum foil or a lath plate of stainless steel; drying and pressing the coated composition, and heating the pressed conposition in vacuo  at a temperature of approxi¬mately 50 to 250°C for approximately 2 hours.<br>
As the active material of negative electrode, carbo¬naceous material capable of absorbing and releasing lith¬ium (such as artificial graphite and natural graphite). It is Referred to employ artificial graphite and natural graphite having a graphite crystal structure in which the lattice distance of lattice surface (002) , namely, d002, is in the range of 0.335 to 0.340 nm (nanometer) .  The active materials of negative electrode can be errployed singly or in combination. A powdery material such as the carbonaceous material is preferably used in combination with a binder such as ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPOVI) , poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) or poly (vinylid¬ene fluoride) (PVDF) . There are no limitations with respect to the preparing method of the negative elec¬trode.  The negative electrode can be prepared by a meth¬od similar to that for the preparation of the positive electrode.<br>
There are no specific limitations with respect to the structure of the nonaqueous lithium secondary battery of the invention. For instance, the nonaqueous secondary<br><br>
battery can be a battery of coin type comprising a posi¬tive electrode, a negative electrode, and single or plu¬ral separators, or a cylindrical or prismatic battery comprising a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator roll.  The separator can be a known mate¬rial such as micro-porous polyolefin film, woven cloth, or non-woven cloth.<br>
The lithium secondary battery of the invention ex¬hibits excellent cycle performance even when it is em¬ployed under the charging condition of a high terminal voltage of higher than 4.2 V, particularly approximately 4.3 V. The discharge terminal voltage can be 2.5 V or higher, moreover 2.8 V or higher.  There are no specific limitation with respect to the current value, and a con¬stant current of 0.1 to 3 C is generally adopted for discharge.  The lithium secondary battery of the inven¬tion can be charged and discharged within a wide tempera¬ture range such as -40 to 100°C, but preferably 0 to 80°C.<br>
The lithium secondary battery of the invention may have a safety valve at the sealing plate to obviate in¬crease of the inner pressure.  Otherwise, a notch can be provided to the battery case or gasket. Also employable are one or more of known safety elements such as a fuse, a bimetal element, and a PTC element, each of which serves as an element for obviating overcurrent.<br>
If desired, the lithium secondary battery of the in¬vention can be encased in a battery pack in which plural batteries are arranged in series and/or in parallel.  The battery pack can have a safety element such as a PTC ele¬ment, a thermostatic fuse, a fuse and/or an electric current breaker, and further a safety circuit (i.e., a circuit capable of monitoring the voltage, temperature and current of the battery of combined battery, and then breaking the current).<br>
[Example 1]<br><br>
[Preparation of non-aqueous electrolytic solution]<br>

Artificial graphite (negative electrode active mate¬rial, 90 wt.%) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (binder, 10 wt.%) were mixed.  To the resulting mixture was further added 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.  Thus produced mixture was coated on copper foil, dried, pressed, and heated to give a negative electrode.<br>
The positive and negative electrodes, a microporous polypropylene film separator, and the above-mentioned non-aqueous electrolytic solution were employed to give a coin-type battery (diameter: 20 mm, thickness: 3.2 mm).<br>
The coin-type battery was charged at room tempera¬ture (20°C) with a constant electric current (0.8 mA) to reach 4.2 V (terminal voltage) for 5 hours.  Subsequent¬ly, the battery was discharged to give a constant elec¬tric current (0.8 mA) to give a terminal voltage of 2.7 V. The charging-discharging cycle procedure was repeat¬ed.<br>
