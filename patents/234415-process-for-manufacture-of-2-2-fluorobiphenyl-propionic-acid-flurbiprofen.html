Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to the process for manufacture of 2-(2-fluorobiphenyl) propionic acid (Flurbiprofen) of formula -1.<br><br>
Background of Invention:<br>
Flurbiprofen is a non-steroidal - anti-inflammatory, analgesic agent. The compound efficiently works in pain management and has, therefore, gained wide use in the preparation of anti-inflammatory medicines. Its anti-inflammatory activity is about 240 times that of aspirin and analgesic activity, is about 180 times that of aspirin in standard laboratory tests. However despite this high activity, the toxicity (LD50) is only 1.2 to 2.4 times greater than that of aspirin in standard laboratory tests.<br>
Diethyl 2-(3-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-methylmalonate and Diethyl 2-(3-chloro-4-aminophenyl)-2-methylmalonate are known as intermediates for the preparation of tertiary amino acid derivatives of 2-(3-chloro-4-aminophenyl)-2-propionic acid having anti-inflammatory properties.

Our Indian granted patent INI 86920 describes an improved process for the manufacture of substituted malonic esters using esters as solvent of choice for condensation reaction. This application is a continuation of our study in improving the overall manufacturing process for the Flurbiprofen.<br>
The reduction procedure employed in most of the prior art patents involves use of costly noble metal catalysts such as palladium, platinum, iron, zinc or tin hydrochloride as reagent of choice, for reduction of nitro groups to corresponding amino group. These catalysts are expensive thereby making the process not economically viable.<br>
The use of these reagents leads to the formation of huge amount of sludge, thus increasing environmental load of effluent. The prior art processes are thus industrially hazardous, difficult to carry out, and have lead to huge amount of industrial waste.<br>
Aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide used to perform the reaction as disclosed in US 4,266,069 and US 4,398,904 are (i) highly toxic, (ii) difficultly recoverable, (iii) difficulty biodegradable and (iv) pose major problem for effluent treatment.<br>
5<br><br>
In the present invention benzene is used as a solvent for process of preparation of substituted methyl malonic ester which does not have the disadvantages of the prior art solvents retaining the other advantageous properties.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention Raney Nickel which is inexpensive catalyst, is used for hydrogenating the nitro diester compound to corresponding amido diester compound.<br>
The catalyst and solvent used in the present invention are routinely recycled, reused and suitable for industrial scale-up, thereby making the process economically viable.<br>
The Gomberg reaction is next processed in situ, employing Cupric chloride and Isobutyl nitrite yielding propanedioic acid, (2-fluoro[l,l'-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl-, diethyl ester which is isolated by vacuum distillation by a "short path distillation unit". The distilled ester is saponified, decarboxylated to Flurbiprofen crude. Purification of the crude product is effected by formation of sodium salt and re-precipitation by treatment with acid to obtain pure Flurbiprofen.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an economical, and efficient green process for preparation of 2-(2-fluorobiphenyl)propionic acid (Flurbiprofen) with high yields which employs single solvent such as benzene thus making the process convenient to carry out in one pot thereby reducing substantially the chemical waste.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of 2-(2-fluorobiphenyl)propionic acid (Flurbiprofen), which employs single solvent such as benzene and an inexpensive Raney Nickel catalyst, avoiding the use of costly noble metal catalyst like Pd/c, Pt/c. The catalyst and solvent used in the invention are routinely recycled, reused and suitable for industrial scale-up.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of 2-(2-fluorobiphenyl)propionic acid (Flurbiprofen), wherein the high vacuum distillation is carried out using "short path distillation unit".<br>
6<br><br>
Further, it is an object of the present invention to use solvent which can be easily recovered, recycled and affords facile reaction for process of preparation of substituted methyl malonic esters eliminating the limitations of the prior art solvents while retaining the other advantageous properties.<br>
It is an another object of the present invention is to carry out subsequent reduction and Gomberg reaction without isolating product of first and second stage and thus making overall process facile and operated like one-pot.<br>

Making Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) requires long chain of chemical reactions and a large quantity of solvent, in order to achieve overall process efficiency.   It is mandatory to involve reactions, which are more efficient and<br>
7<br><br>
environment friendly.   Pharmaceutical companies do produce huge amounts of hazardous waste, per year.   Green manufacturing program's undertaken in many industries, center around efficient waste management and making the entire process green from the start. The     present     invention     describes     a     process     for     preparation     of    2-(2-fluorobiphenyOpropionic acid (Flurbiprofen) of formula -1.<br><br><br><br>
Formula -I <br>
More specifically the present invention provides process for preparation of substituted methyl malonic ester (formula II)<br><br><br><br>
(Formula - II)<br>
where R1 and R are the same or different selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl of from Q to C6 carbon atoms, comprises reacting compound of formula -HI,<br><br>
(Formula - III) 8<br><br>
wherein R &amp; R1 are as defined above, with 2,4-Difluoronitrobenzene in presence of a base selected from the group consisting of alkali metal hydroxides, or carbonates and mixtures thereof more preferably potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparation of 2-(2-fluorobiphenyl)propionic acid (Flurbiprofen), (formula - I), comprising alkylation of 2,4-Difluronitro benzene using dimethyl ethyl malonate (formula III) in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent at 50°- 100°C to form Nitro-diester (formula - II). The aromatic hydrocarbon solvent used for alkylation reaction may be toluene, benzene, xylene or combination thereof, more preferably benzene.<br>
The compound of formula-II is then reduced with suitable hydrogenation catalyst in an organic solvent at 20° - 70°C and 5.0 - 55.0 psi gauge pressure preferably 35° - 45°C and 25 - 50 psi gauge pressure to form amino-diester (formula - IV).The hydrogenation catalyst used may be selected from Raney Nickel, Palladium, Platinum or Platinum Oxide, more preferably Raney Nickel. The organic solvent used in hydrogenation of compound (formula-II) may be selected from benzene, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, or combination thereof, more preferably benzene.<br><br>
(Formula - IV) <br>
The compound (formula- IV) is further subjected to Gomberg reaction in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent to yield Propanediol acid, (2-fluoro[l,r-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl-, diethyl ester (formula V) which is purified by short path distillation. The solvent used in Gomberg reaction of compound of formula- IV, is benzene which is already present in the reaction mass right from stage I being carried forward without getting contaminated.<br>
9<br><br><br>
(Formula - V) <br>
Biaryl diester (formula-V) is further subjected to saponification on treatment with alkali, decarboxylation and subsequently treated with alkali to form sodium salt of flurbiprofen dihydrate which is further processed to flurbiprofen (formula I) upon acidification.<br>
The process of the present invention substantially reduces formation of by-products and gives high yield of the product. It employs cheaper and easily available raw materials and eliminates use of hazardous reagents. It is, therefore, efficient, economical and convenient to carry out. More importantly the solvent used for the first three steps is same and hence the process is operated as one pot without isolation of intermediates in first two steps.<br>
The invention is further described and exemplified by the detailed examples which follow but they are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
