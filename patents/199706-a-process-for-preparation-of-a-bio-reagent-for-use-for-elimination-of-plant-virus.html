				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Plant extracts are known to be used to inhibit the activity of certain viruses. The crude extract of pokeweed (Phytolacca decandroL), has reported (by Duggar and Armstrong in 'Annals of Missouri Botanical Garden' 12:359-366,1925) to markedly inhibit the activity of ordinary Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). The extracts of Phytolacca rigida is reported (by Johnson, in 'Phytopathology' 31:679-701, 1941) to inhibit cornpletery Tobacco Mosaic Virus, even after aging in vitro for long periods. The extracts of leaves of spinach, garden beet, sugar beet and chard when mixed in equal parts with the incula of Tobacco Mosaic Virus and Cabbage .Mosaic Virus, completely or almost completely inhibited their activity. When spinach extract was mixed in equal parts with the incula of Tobacco Ring Spot Virus, Latent Potato Ring Virus and Cucumber Mosaic Virus, the infectivity of these incula was also almost nearly completely inhibited (Kuntz and Walker,'Phytopathology'37:561579, 1947).<br>
The main drawback of the above known plant extracts is that these extracts and method of use thereof enable inhibition of viruses but are not effective enough to achieve complete retrieval.<br>
Another drawback of the above known plant extracts is that the known plant extracts are of no use in producing virus free plant material through tissue culture techniques, especially in plants where such procedures are becoming standard procedures for mass multiplication.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of plant extract of Asparagus adscendens and in vitro method of use thereof for plant virus eliminaton.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process of retrieve different viruses from plant systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
preparation of plant extract of Asparagus species comprising hot air oven drying of the roots of the plant at temperature around 45°C, powdering the plant material, refluxing plant material at least thrice with an organic solvent taking plant material and organic solvent in the ratio of 2:5 (w/v), followed by at least three times refluxing with another organic solvent like acetone after drying, taking dried plant material and solvent in the ratio of 2:5(w/v);<br>
Chrysanthemum virus "B' free plants have been produced using the plant extract based on Asparagus species. The present process provides an environment friendly approach to eliminate virus from plant systems.<br>
The process of present invention involves collection of roots of Asparagus adscendens Roxb, refluxing with benzene on boiling water bath, filtration of the contents, drying of spent plant roots, refluxing roots with acetone thrice, addition of acetone extracts of roots in the liquid multiplication medium of Chrysanthemum in different concentration, culturing explants from Chrysanthemum virus B infected plants of Chrysanthemum cv Jugli in the supplemented media and regeneration of complete Chrysanthemum virus B free plants.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparation of extract of the plant of Asparagus species for virus elimination particularly of Chrysanthemum Virus B wherein the process comprises of drying the roots of the plant in hot air oven, powdering of plant material, first refluxing the plant material at least thrice with organic solvent such as benzene on boiling water bath, filtration, drying and second refluxing with organic solvent such as acetone at least three times and finally vacuum drying.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the process for preparation of plant extract of Asparagus adscendens, comprises following steps:<br>
(a)	Drying<br>
Roots of plants of Asparagus adscendens Roxb are collected and dried in hot air oven around 45°C and powdered.<br>
(b)	Extraction With Organic Solvents<br>
The air dried plant material is refluxed at least thrice, with organic solvents preferably benzene, on boiling water bath for two hours, taking plant material and organic solvent in the preferred ratio of 2:5. The contents are filtered and spent roots are dried. The roots are then refluxed again with acetone taking dried spent roots and organic solvent in the preferred w/v ratio of 2:5. The final extracts are dried in vacuum.<br>
METHOD OF USE<br>
(a)	Preparation of Culture Medium<br>
A culture medium for carnation multiplication is prepared by taking MS (Murashige and Skoog's) salts, 1.5 to 1.25 mg/1, preferably 2.0 mg/1 BAP (Benzyle Amino Purine); 0.75 to 1.25 mg/1 preferably 1.0 mg/1 of NAA (a-napthlene acetic acid); 0.75 to 1.25 mg/1 preferably 1.0 mg/1 gibbrellic acid (GAs); 24-35 g/1, preferably 30 g/1 sucrose, and 75 to 125 mg/1 preferably 100 mg/1 meso inositol.<br>
(b)	Preparation of Multiplication Medium<br>
The plant extract prepared by the process described above is added to the culture medium prepared as above and finally multiplication medium having four different concentrations namely 1.0 mg/1, 2.5 mg/1, 5.0 mg/1 and 7.5 mg/1, are prepared.<br>
(c)	Elinination of Virus<br>
Shoot tips as well as auxiliary buds from Chrysanthemum Virus B infected plants of Chrysanthemum cv Jugali or from their established cultures are sub-cultured on the media prepared as above and complete plants of Chrysanthemum regenerated.<br>
(d)	Evaluation	.	<br>
Virus status of regenerated plants is judged using Alkine phosphate.based direct<br>
antigen coating indirect ELISA (Enzyine Link Immunosorbent. Assay) system against<br>
Chrysanthemum Virus B. The root extracts of Acetone were able to eliminate the virus<br>
at the concentration level of 7.5mg/l.	<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with working examples which are intended<br>
to be a typical example to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to<br>
imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.	<br>
WORKING EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1		<br>
Roots of plants of Asparagus adscendens are collected and dried in hotair oven at 45°C and powered, 100 g of which was refluxed thrice with 250 ml of benzene on boiling water bath for 2 hrs and contents were filtered. Spent plant roots were dried. The roots were then refluxed with 250 ml of acetone thrice and the extract so obtained was used as ingredient in media along with other hormones after final drying in vacuum.<br>
Stock solutions of four different concentrations of the extracts viz. 1.0, 2.5, 5.0<br>
and 7.5 mg/1 obtained as above was prepared in liquid culture medium for<br>
Chrysanthemum containing MS salts, 2.0 mg/1 benzyle amino purine (BAP), 1.0 mg/1 (cc-<br>
napthlene acetic acid (NAA), 1.0 mg/1 gibbrellic acid (GAs), 30 g/1 sucrose, and 100 mg/1<br>
meso inositol.	<br>
Nodal explants from Chrysanthemum Virus B infected plants of Chrysanthemum cv Jugali or from their established cultures were subcultured on these media and their effect on virus concentration was recorded using Alkaline phosphatase based direct antigen coating indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system against Chrysanthemum Virus B.<br>
The root fractions in Asparagus adscendens gave a mild reaction between 1.0 and<br>
2.5 mg/1 concentrations and a strong negative reaction between 5.0 and 7.5 mg/1<br>
concentration.<br>
Example. 2<br>
Roots of plants' of Asparagus officinalis are collected and dried in hot air oven at 45°C and powered, 100 g of which was refluxed thrice with 250 ml of benzene on boiling water bath for 2 hrs and contents were filtered. Spent plant roots were dried. The roots were then refluxed with 250 ml of acetone thrice and the extract so obtained was used as ingredient in media along with other hormones after final drying in vacuum.<br>
. Stock solutions of four different concentrations of the extracts viz. 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 7,5 mg/1 obtained as above was prepared in liquid culture medium for Chrysanthemum containing MS salts, 2.0!mg/l benzyle amino purine (BAP), 1.0 mg/1 (a-napthlene acetic acid (NAA), 1.0 mg/1 gibbrellic acid (GAs), 30 g/1 sucrose and 100 mg/1 meso inositol finally multiplication medium having different concentration viz, 1.0, 2,5,'" 5.0 and 7.5 mg/1 of each extracts was prepared.<br>
Nodal explants from Chrysanthemum Virus B infected plants of Carnation cv<br>
Scania or from their established cultures were subcultured on these media and their effect<br>
on virus concentration was recorded using Alkaline phosphatase based direct antigen<br>
coating indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system against<br>
Chrysanthemum Virus B.	-<br>
The root fractions in Asparagus officinalis gave a mild reaction between 1.0 and<br>
2.5 mg/1 concentrations and a strong negative reaction between 5.0 and 7.5 mg/1<br>
concentration.	.<br>
