				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an electronic timepiece of the multifunction watch type for navigational aid,<br>
notably for a space mission. More particularly, the invention relates to a watch with multiple displays<br>
and alarm means.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
To simplify the description of the present invention, the term "watch" will be used to refer to this<br>
timepiece hereafter.<br>
In the present invention, the term "navigation" shall be construed in its ordinary meaning: air, land or<br>
sea travel, speleological missions, etc.<br>
It has particular application, although non-exhaustive, in the field of space missions of long duration.<br>
To fix ideas, the following shall focus on the case of the preferred application of the invention, which is<br>
a space mission of a duration expressed in days or even in months.<br>
In the context of applications referred to above, and more particularly for the aforementioned space<br>
missions, a number of needs are evident.<br>
Firstly, the time of departure must be dated precisely. It follows that the characteristic events of the<br>
mission necessitate reference to time which is either "internal", i.e. relative to the start of the mission,<br>
or "external", such as the "Universal time" (Greenwich Meridian Time, "GMT"), still referred to as "Zulu<br>
Time" in certain Anglo-Saxon publications.<br>
A certain amount of time-related and / or time-stamping information must also be available,<br>
displayable and produce selective audio and / visual alarms.<br>
Several time scales are also required, in such a way as to accommodate for different situations, notably<br>
in terms of variable durations of mission and / or specific phases of these missions.<br>
Naturally, further to the aforementioned "Universal Time", the watch must be able to display the time<br>
corresponding to the local time zone, one or several times for other time zones. It must be equipped<br>
with standard functions such as "chronometer" and date display (day, month, year), etc.<br>
Also, multi-function watches claiming to be "universal" have been proposed in prior art, notably in the<br>
context of applications more specifically concerned by the invention, i.e. navigational aid.<br>
As a non-exhaustive example, the American patent US 6 144 619 (John<br>
P. Reisman) can be quoted, entitled "FLIGHT WATCH WITH MULTIPLE<br>
TIMERS AND ALARM INDICATING MEANS".<br>
This patent, as implied by the title, concerns an electronic watch<br>
equipped with several functions assisting an aircraft pilot with his flight<br>
programme. It satisfies the requirements of such an application, in an automatic<br>
and ergonomic manner, thereby freeing the pilot from his repetitive tasks and<br>
allowing him to focus fully on critical flight events without the distraction of<br>
subsidiary tasks.<br>
The watch subject of this patent can display the local time, the "GMT"<br>
time (or "Zulu Time"), and forty-two time zones. It is equipped with several time<br>
counters, with six different scales, with a chronometer function, counters/count-<br>
down counters for time elapsed. It comprises analogue and digital viewing<br>
components and different alarms (of audio, visual and tactile type). These<br>
different functions can be preset using easy-access control buttons.<br>
This watch, or similar watches, could be considered to respond fully to<br>
needs evident in the context of applications concerned by the invention, due to<br>
the significant quantity of functions with which they are equipped and their<br>
flexible use.<br>
However this is not so, notably, but not exhaustively, in the case of space<br>
missions. Indeed, needs specific to such an application have not yet been met.<br>
It must be possible to define a zero time with a precise date for a forward<br>
count or for a count-down.<br>
The watch must then be capable of calculating automatically the time<br>
elapsed since, or the time remaining until, a given event. The time elapsed (in<br>
days, hours, minutes, seconds) since an event of known date should not require<br>
the operator of the watch to be on the alert for the start point when he has to set<br>
the chronometer in motion.<br>
Furthermore, the time remaining until an event of known date must not<br>
require mental calculation on the part of the operator to determine the period<br>
that he needs to set on his time counter, a period which separates the time<br>
when he will start the count-down from the time at which the programmed event<br>
will take place.<br>
This is a very important point in the context of space missions, where all<br>
activities are planned either according to the time elapsed since the time of lift-<br>
off, abbreviated as "MET (for "Mission Elapsed Time", or according to the<br>
Universal Time ("GMT). To simplify the description of the present invention,<br>
said abbreviations "GMT and "MET, will be used hereafter. "MET is therefore<br>
comparable to an advanced "chronograph" function.<br>
The start time is defined in the watch by the lift-off date and not by<br>
pressing a predetermined button of the watch at the precise time of lift-off. It<br>
should be possible to input or "enter" this date into the watch both before and<br>
after lift-off.<br>
Some of these space operations must be dated with high precision with<br>
relation to the "MET or with relation to the "GMT and require in turn the<br>
implementation of a count-down until a determined period of time has elapsed<br>
since an event characteristic of such an operation.<br>
An excursion into the space vacuum wouid be a perfect example of such<br>
an operation. Due to communication restrictions, the airlock door must be<br>
opened at a precise point in time, and due to autonomy restrictions; a maximum<br>
working time must be respected outside the spaceship. The astronaut must<br>
therefore be aware of the time remaining, permanently, in order to prepare for<br>
the effective opening of the door, as well as the time elapsed since the start of<br>
his excursion.<br>
Other events generating the same requirement are ignition of a<br>
spaceship's orbit changing engine, docking with another spacecraft, the<br>
undocking of a satellite from the spacecraft's cargo bay, etc.<br>
If the operator commits an error when starting the chronometer at the<br>
launch of a significant event yet he knows the date, he should be able to enter<br>
this date into his watch, which would compensate for the operator's lateness<br>
and display the exact elapsed time.<br>
Lastly, it should be possible to determine the time elapsed since a<br>
determined event, which we will arbitrarily qualify hereafter as "positive time", or<br>
the time remaining until a determined event, which we will arbitrarily qualify<br>
hereafter as "negative time", the date of said determined event being adjustable<br>
by the operator.<br>
In the preferred application of the invention, this time lapse corresponds<br>
to a phase in the space mission, which can comprise several phases. Also, this<br>
time lapse will be referred to hereafter as "PET (for "Phase Elapsed Time").<br>
It should be made possible for the operator to adjust the time scale to a suitable selected time scale,<br>
either with relation to "GMT", or with relation to "MET".<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention aims to overcome the disadvantages of devices of the prior art, to respond to<br>
requirements which are evident in the fields of application concerned by the invention, some of which<br>
have been referred to above.<br>
The objective set by the invention is a multi-function watch for navigational aid, notably for a space<br>
mission.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve this objective, according to a first important characteristic, the watch according to the<br>
invention comprises first means enabling the definition of a start time for a first predetermined event,<br>
by inputting into the watch a start date for this event, and means for determining, recording and<br>
displaying the time elapsed starting from this event with relation to predetermined time scales.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, this date can be entered at any point in time, i.e. more<br>
specifically indifferently before or after the occurrence of the event, function which was referred to<br>
above as "MET".<br>
According to a second important characteristic, the watch conform to the invention comprises means<br>
for determining, recording and displaying a period of time remaining until a second predetermined<br>
event, i.e. the start of a phase in the mission ("PET"), time that will be referred to as "negative", or the<br>
time elapsed since this event, which will be referred to as "positive", said predetermined event allowing<br>
adjustment by the operator of the time scale selected with relation to a predetermined start time,<br>
either with relation to "GMT", or with relation to aforementioned "MET".<br>
Naturally, the watch according to the invention comprises means for entering, recording and displaying<br>
the "GMT" time.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, it also comprises means for entering, recording and displaying several time<br>
zones.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the watch according to the invention comprises several "count-<br>
down time counter" chronometers, advantageously five, in such a way as to dispose of several alarms.<br>
Advantageously, each alarm is associated to a distinct audio signal, for example an alarm or a<br>
predefined sequence of "beeps".<br>
In a still further preferred embodiment, the watch according to the invention comprises a double<br>
display: a first display of analogue type and a second display of digital type.<br>
The main subject of the invention is therefore an electronic timepiece of the watch type for<br>
navigational aid, notably for a space mission, said navigation being associated to a start time for a first<br>
predetermined event, comprising input and entry means for date and / or duration data, storage<br>
means for saving said entered data, calculation and clock signal generation means, at least digital<br>
display means for displaying said entered data and / or data generated using this data under the<br>
command of said calculation and clock signal generation means, characterized in that said data input<br>
and entry means and said storage means are arranged for the entry and storage of a first start date<br>
linked to the Time called Universal determined by the Greenwich meridian and the generation of a first<br>
time scale having as start date said first date, in that said data input and entry means and said storage<br>
means are arranged for the entry and the storage, at any point in time, of a second start date<br>
corresponding to said predetermined first event, called start of mission, and the generation of a second<br>
time scale, said second time scale being determined at least using said first time scale, and in that said<br>
digital viewing means display a time value called negative when said first start date is in the future and<br>
a time value called positive when this date has elapsed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following shall focus, without restricting the scope of the present invention in any way, on the<br>
context of the preferred application the invention, unless specified to the contrary, i.e, in the case of a<br>
space mission.<br>
Figure 1 is a time diagram illustrating schematically the operating procedure of a watch according to<br>
the invention.<br>
On this diagram, and hereafter, the terms used correspond to the following definitions:<br>
- Time scale "T1": Local time for a time zone referred to arbitrarily as "number 1".<br>
- Time scale "T2": Local time for a time zone referred to arbitrarily as "number 2".<br>
- Time scale "GMT" (for "Greenwich Meridian Time", also referred to as Universal Time): the<br>
number of days are counted since the first of January. It is the universal reference time scale<br>
used on all navigation missions during which spaceships can be brought to change time zones<br>
regularly. "GMT" is a former acronym which is now often replaced by "UTC" (for "Coordinated<br>
Universal Time").<br>
- Time scale "MET" (for "Mission Elapsed Time").<br>
Time elapsed since a predetermined time, in this case the start of the space mission. It is<br>
defined in one of the time scales T1, T2 or "GMT". In the case of the aforementioned space<br>
flight, this concerns the precise time of the spaceship's lift-off.<br>
- "Alarm" ("AL") function: Emission of an audio signal on a date that can<br>
be set by the operator of the watch in a pre-selected time scale, either T1, T2,<br>
"GMT or "MET".<br>
- "PET ("Phase elapsed time") function : This is the time remaining until<br>
a predetermined event, referred to as "negative", or the time elapsed since this<br>
event, referred to as "positive", the date of this event being adjustable by the<br>
operator of the watch in a pre-selected time scale, either "GMT, or "MET. It<br>
should be reminded that during a space mission, "PET is the time reference<br>
used for excursions into space, meeting or separation phases of spaceships,<br>
orbit corrections or re-entry into the atmosphere.<br>
- "Timer" ("TMR") function: This is a count-down starting from a<br>
predefined quantity of time, for relatively short periods of time. This function is a<br>
standard watch function.<br>
- "Chronograph" function ("CHR"): This is a forward count that measures,<br>
with precision, the time elapsed since the time at which the operator set in<br>
motion the device, for relatively short periods of time. This function is a standard<br>
watch function. Nevertheless, it should be noted here too that for standard<br>
requirements, the "hours - minutes - seconds" or "minutes - seconds - 1/100<br>
sec." resolutions are usually provided by chronographs, whereas these two<br>
ranges are not usually provided.<br>
The three upper axes on the diagram in figure 1 show the time scales,<br>
whereas the four lower axes show the functions.<br>
More precisely, the two upper axes on the time diagram in figure 1 show<br>
the time scales for time zones, "T1" and "T2", which have been referred to as N°<br>
1 and 2, respectively.<br>
An arbitrary time tx , or present time, in the space mission has been<br>
represented, respectively at (12 H - 6) with relation to the local time T1 and at<br>
(12 H +1)with relation to the local time "T2".<br>
The present time tx corresponds to 12 H on the Universal Time "GMT"<br>
axis (third time axis in figure 1, under axes "T1" and "T2".<br>
The two lower axes in figure 1 correspond to "MET and "PET time<br>
scales, respectively.<br>
A space mission can comprise one or more different phases. A number<br>
corresponding to different "PETs" can therefore be defined.<br>
However, by definition, there is only one "MET per mission, a time which<br>
defines the start of this mission, for example the precise time of the spaceship's<br>
lift-off as referred to above.<br>
On the diagram in figure 1, t0 has been called 0 time or start of the "MET<br>
time scale, which can be defined with relation to one of the "T1", "T2", or "GMT<br>
time scales.<br>
On the diagram in figure 1, t'0 has been called 0 time or start of the "PET<br>
time scale, which can be defined with relation to one of the "MET (time scale<br>
that is "internal" to the mission) or "GMT (time scale that is "external" to the<br>
mission) time scales.<br>
According to one important characteristic of the invention, "PET should<br>
be considered as a "Timer" function (as defined below), but with the setting<br>
parameter being a date rather than a period of time.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the t0 and t'0 times<br>
(defined by dates) can be entered into the watch at any point in time, knowing<br>
the precise time of the start of the mission, to be stored and displayed therein.<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, "negative" and<br>
"positive" times are therefore defined, noted "+" and "-" respectively, on the<br>
axes of the "MET" and "PET" time scales.<br>
On the "CHR" and "TMR" axes, the arbitrary times tCHR and tTMR which<br>
action these functions have also been represented.<br>
The configuration of a watch 1 according to a preferred embodiment,<br>
more specifically the display units of this watch, will now be described, with<br>
reference to figure 2.<br>
Hereafter, the display and setting formats and parameters for the watch 1<br>
are defined conventionally as follows:<br>
Display format:<br>
The display format can differ from the format used for the setting.<br>
The following code is used to represent the display or the setting:<br>
Y= year;<br>
M = month: 1 to 12 (1 or 2 figures) or: JAN to DEC (three letters)<br>
J = day of the week (to fix ideas, in English: MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA<br>
and SU);<br>
D = date in the month: 1 to 31 (1 or 2 figures);<br>
d = number of the day. 000 to 366 for GMT or -99 to 999 for "MET' or<br>
"PET;<br>
h = hour: 0 to 23 (1 or 2 figures)<br>
m = minute; 00 to 59 (2 figures)<br>
s = second: 00 to 59 (2 figures)<br>
s/100 = hundredth of second: 00 to 99 (2 figures).<br>
Display parameters:<br>
The display parameters are specified in the table:<br>
"TABLE: Display parameters", annexed to the present description.<br>
Setting parameters:<br>
"T1" or "T2" : + or - h with relation to "GMT" (with h expressed in hours)<br>
"GMT": X.Y.M.D.h.m.s ;<br>
relation wherein X is a letter that specifies the language selected for<br>
showing the days, which also applies to the months if the operator opts for them<br>
to be displayed in letters. X precedes the two figures YV specifying the year<br>
during the setting. X can take the values "F" (French), "E" (English) and "S"<br>
(Spanish) "MET":"---", or<br>
setting for the time scale "T1" or "T2" or "GMT":<br>
-/+ .M.D.h.m.s for setting in "T1" or "T2" time<br>
-/+ d.h.m.s or M.D.h.m.s for setting in "GMT" time<br>
"TMR": h.m.s<br>
"CHR". 0.00.00 / 00<br>
Alarm ("AL"): alarm number, "ON" (enabled) or "OFF" (disabled), with<br>
time scales M.J.D.h.m for alarm in the "T1" and "T2" time scale, d.h.m.s for<br>
alarm in the "GMT' and "MET" time scale "PET:"- - -", or setting for the "MET<br>
or "GMT time scale -/+ d.h.m.s for setting in the "MET time scale -/+ d.h.m.s or<br>
M.D.h.m.s for setting in "GMT time.<br>
"MET or "PET settings consist in defining the date of the zero time for<br>
"MET or "PET, respectively, expressed in another time scale. When three<br>
dashes ("- - - ") are displayed in the position of the reference time, this means<br>
that "MET or "PET are undefined. Since the year is not a parameter that is<br>
available for setting "MET or "PET, the signs "-" or "+" are used to specify<br>
whether the date entered is in the past or (by default) in the future.<br>
In the example provided in figure 2, the watch 1 comprises<br>
advantageously two types of display units: an analogue display component with<br>
hands 2 and digital display components, 3 and 4, in a per se conventional<br>
manner, with liquid crystal display.<br>
Preferentially, the analogue display by hands 2 is used essentially for the<br>
display of the local time in time zones "T1" or "T2".<br>
Advantageously, the screen 3 is subdivided into three zones, referenced<br>
30 to 32, and the screen 4 into two zones, 40 and 41. The functions of these<br>
zones will be specified below with reference to the description in figures 3A to<br>
7C, it being understood that zones 30 and 31 are used to specify the type of<br>
data or functions currently displayed: "T1". "T2" "GMT, "MET", "PET", etc.<br>
In the following, since in the embodiment described the year is not an<br>
available parameter, during settings of "MET or "PET, the signs "-" or "+",<br>
respectively, can be used to specify whether the date entered into the watch is<br>
in the past or (by default) in the future.<br>
In these figures, so as not to encumber the drawing unnecessarily, the<br>
hands of the analogue display 2 have not been included. Furthermore, elements<br>
that are identical from one figure to another and identical to those in figure 2<br>
bear the same references and will not be re-described unless so required.<br>
Lastly, the detailed settings and displays of the watch 1 will be described<br>
hereafter with reference to tables "TABLE T1" to "TABLE PET" annexed to the<br>
present description.<br>
Figure 3A illustrates an example of "GMT" setting for Tuesday 2nd<br>
November 2004, 10 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds.<br>
The letters for the "GMT function are entered into zone 30 of the watch<br>
1. "F04" ("F" for French), "11", "2", and "10 12 35" are entered into zones 31,<br>
32, 40 and 41, respectively.<br>
Figure 3B illustrates an example of the display of the "GMT" function<br>
which has just been set (figure 3A).<br>
During the display, the watch 1 calculates automatically the day of the<br>
week (TUESDAY in the example provided) corresponding to the date and the<br>
language (French) entered by the operator.<br>
The "GMT function is displayed in zone 30, "TU" is displayed in zone 31.<br>
"11" is displayed in zone 32, "2" is displayed in zone 40 and the time ("10 12<br>
35") in zone 41.<br>
As a first alternative, no information is displayed in zone 32 and the<br>
number "307" is displayed in zone 40, the other zones staying the same.<br>
As a second alternative, zone 32 displays "NOV" instead of the number<br>
"11", the other zones staying the same.<br>
Assuming that the time zone N° 1 (scale "T1" in figure 1) represents the<br>
local time in HOUSTON (USA), figure 4A illustrates a setting example of the<br>
"T1" function, being a time zone differential of -5 hours with relation to the<br>
"GMT' (previous setting in figure 3A).<br>
The letters of the "T1"function are entered into zone 30 of the watch 1.<br>
"GMT, "- 5", "2, "5 12 35" are entered into zones 31, 32, 40 and 41,<br>
respectively.<br>
Figure 4B illustrates an example of the display of the local time, set as<br>
follows: function "T1" (zone 31), day ("TU": zone 31), month (number: zone 32),<br>
day of the year (zone 40) and "hours, minutes, seconds" (zone 41), so 5 H 12<br>
mn 35 s.<br>
Figure 5A illustrates a first example of the "MET setting (zone 30),<br>
assuming that the zero time of "MET (figure 1: rO) is defined by the following<br>
date: "25" (zone 40) February (number"- 2": zone 32) at 21 H 44 mn 12 s ("21<br>
44 12":<br>
zone 41), HOUSTON time, this being the local time in the "T" time zone,<br>
as defined previously. This setting is therefore defined with relation to this time<br>
scale ("T1": figure 1).<br>
It could just have well have been defined with relation to a different local<br>
time scale, for example "TV".<br>
Figure 5B illustrates a second example of "MET" setting, but with relation<br>
to the "GMT time scale (figure 1), using this same data. Zone 30 still specifies<br>
that it refers to the "MET" setting, but zone 31 now specifies that it refers to<br>
"GMT and no longer to "T1". Zones 32, 40 and 41 are set as in the case in<br>
figure 5A. Zone 32 only displays the negative sign ("-").<br>
Figure 5C illustrates an example of the display of the "MET function,<br>
here one day and 13 H 45 mn 55 s (zone 41) before the departure of the<br>
spaceship, i.e. the beginning of the mission. According to an important<br>
characteristic of the invention, "MET can be set at any point in time, before or<br>
after the zero time to. The first case concerns a negative time: zone 40<br>
therefore displays "- 01" (for minus one day). Zones 31 and 32 do not display<br>
any data.<br>
A "-" sign located under "MET' specifies that the date of the zero time of<br>
the "MET used for the setting is in the future. This is the default value. A "+"<br>
sign means that<br>
the start time of the "MET" is in the past. This operating procedure<br>
avoids, as specified previously, having to include the current year when entering<br>
the date of the zero time.<br>
As a first alternative for the setting, "- 2" and "26" are entered into zones<br>
30 and 40, respectively.<br>
As a second alternative for the setting, if "GMT is not defined, "- - -" is<br>
entered into zone 31, and zones 40 and 41 display "000" and 0 00 00",<br>
respectively.<br>
The setting and the display of a "chronograph" function is carried out in a<br>
conventional manner and these operations do not need to be re-described in<br>
detail. Zone 30 indicates "CHR" and zones 31 and 41 indicate "00" and "0 00<br>
00", respectively, before activation of the chronometer. Zones 32 and 40 do not<br>
display any data.<br>
After activation, zone 41 displays the time in hours, minutes, and<br>
seconds, for example the number "0 02 31" (0 hours 02 minutes 31 seconds)<br>
and zone 31 displays the hundredths of seconds, for example the number "89".<br>
It can be noted that hours, minutes and seconds are positioned in their<br>
respective usual location in order to prevent any confusion with the hundredths<br>
of seconds.<br>
The setting and the display of a "Timer" or "TMR" function is also carried<br>
out in a per se conventional manner. Zone 31 indicates "TMR", zone 41<br>
indicates the length of the count-down time, for example "2 45 32" (for 2 hours<br>
45 minutes 32 seconds) and<br>
zone 40 indicates the "-" sign to specify that it refers to a count-down.<br>
Once activated, "TMR" decrements in seconds.<br>
Figure 6A illustrates a setting example for a "PET (function entered and<br>
displayed in zone 30) assuming that the zero time t'0 (figure 1) with relation to<br>
the "MET (figure 1: rO) is 8 days 17 hours 8 minutes 0 seconds. Zone 31<br>
displays the letters of the "MET function. Zone 32 does not display any data. "0<br>
0 8" is entered in zone 40 and "17 08 00", in zone 41.<br>
Alternatively, if "PET' is defined with relation to "GMT, the letters for this<br>
function are entered and displayed in zone 31. "- 3", "5" and "18 01 12" are<br>
entered in zones 32, 40 and 41, respectively.<br>
In this same case, also as an alternative, the letters "GMT are entered<br>
and displayed in zone 31. "-", "065" and "18 01 12" are entered in zones 32, 40<br>
and 41, respectively.<br>
Figure 6B illustrates an example of the display of the "PET function<br>
(zone 30) at 3 mn and 10 s (zone 41: "0 03 10") from the zero time. Zone 40<br>
displays "- 0 0", the "-" sign ("negative" time) indicating that the zero time t'0 is in<br>
the future. Zones 31 and 32 do not display any data.<br>
Alternatively, if "GMT is not defined, zone 31 displays "- - - " and zones<br>
40 and 41 display "000" and "0 00 00", respectively.<br>
As for "MET, a "-" sign positioned under "PET" during the setting based<br>
on the "GMT time indicates that the date of the zero time of the "PET" used for<br>
the setting is in the future. This is the default value. A "+" sign means that the<br>
start time of the "MET" is in the past. This operating procedure avoids, as<br>
specified previously, having to include the current year when entering the date<br>
of the zero time.<br>
It should be noted that "PET" operates in a very similar manner to "MET"<br>
but that it applies to occasional operations, whereas "PET" is moreover<br>
dedicated to the mission as a whole.<br>
As specified previously, the watch comprises advantageously five<br>
"Timers" (or more) in such a way as to be able to set and display an equal<br>
number of alarms which are independent from each other and refer to the<br>
different time scales: "T2", "T2", "GMT, "MET, etc.<br>
To fix ideas, it shall now be illustrated, with reference to figures 7A to 7C,<br>
the setting and the display of three of these possible alarms, arbitrarily named<br>
"AL 1" to "AL 3", respectively.<br>
The setting and the display of the first alarm, "AL 1", (indicated by zone<br>
30) is illustrated by figure 7A. This alarm refers to the "MET time scale (figure<br>
1).<br>
The "MET scale is indicated in zone 31 and the alarm is set for 3 days<br>
(zone 40) 21 H 5 mn 17 s. The "AL 1" alarm is active (status referred to as<br>
"ON"): this status is symbolised by the "
of the "AL 1" sign. For example, the setting is carried out for 3 days 21 hours 05<br>
minutes 17 seconds. "0 0 3" and "21 05 17" are entered and displayed in zones<br>
40 and 41, respectively. Zone 32 does not display any data.<br>
As a first alternative for the setting, "079" and "2 10 00" are entered and<br>
displayed in zones 40 and 41, respectively.<br>
As a second alternative for the setting, "19" and "2 10 00" are entered<br>
and displayed in zones 40 and 41, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the setting and the display of the second alarm, "AL 2",<br>
(indicated by zone 30) is illustrated by figure 7B.<br>
This alarm refers to the "T2" time scale (figure 1).<br>
The letters of the "T2" time scale are entered and displayed in zone 31,<br>
and the "AL 2" alarm is set to go off every Thursday ("TH" sign displayed by the<br>
last two digits of zone 41) in the month of August (figure "8": zone 32) at 6 H 45<br>
mn (first section of zone 41: "6 45").<br>
The alarm "AL 1" is disabled in the example provided in figure 7B (status<br>
called "OFF"): this status can be interpreted as such because the "
displayed in zone 30. Zone 40 displays "— ".<br>
Lastly, the setting and the display of the third alarm, "AL 3", (indicated by<br>
zone 30) is illustrated by figure 7C.<br>
This alarm refers to the "T1" time scale (figure 1). The letters of the "T1"<br>
time scale are entered and displayed in zone 31, and the alarm "AL 3" is set for<br>
the 15th (zone 40) of each month at 18 H 30 (zone 41: 18 30 - -). The "AL 3"<br>
alarm is enabled (status called "ON"): this status is symbolised by the "
displayed in zone 30 to the right of the "AL 3" sign. Zone 40 displays "— ".<br>
When the alarms go off, the watch emits preferentially an audio signal<br>
attracting the operator's attention, for example, a predetermined sequence of<br>
audio "beeps".<br>
To fix ideas, for the "AL 3" alarm, the repeated sequence of three<br>
"beeps" can be adopted: "beep.beep.beep — beep.beep.beep<br>
beep.beep.beep etc.", until the alarm is switched off by the operator (the dashes<br>
represent a pause in the emission). The same can apply for the other alarms:<br>
for example, a repeated sequence of two "beeps" for the "AL 2" alarm,<br>
etc. Preferentially, the watch 1 comprises five alarms.<br>
As specified previously, the time and the minutes of time scales "TV' or<br>
"T2" can also be displayed permanently by the analogue section of the watch:<br>
hands 2 (figure 1).<br>
In a practical manner, a number of other conventions can be adopted for<br>
the configuration of different settings and displays, notably in view of producing<br>
good ergonomics, conventions accessible to Skilled Professionals and not<br>
requiring detailed description.<br>
With regards to the characteristics that are more specific to the invention,<br>
the following can nevertheless be clarified:<br>
- Setting "MET or "PET consists in setting the date of the zero time<br>
expressed in another time scale ("TV, "GMT, ...). When three dashes ("- - -")<br>
are displayed in the position of the reference time, this means that "MET or<br>
"PET are undefined.<br>
- The "MET, "PET" and "Timer" ("TMR") displays are associated to the<br>
"-" sign when they are counting-down time. i.e. when the date corresponding to<br>
the programmed "zero" time is located in the future.<br>
- When the "zero" time is crossed, "MET, "PET and the "Timer" mark<br>
this time by emitting an audio signal, for example an alarm which characterises<br>
the function in question and carry on counting forward without stopping. For<br>
example, to fix ideas, the "MET alarm only lasts 5 seconds whereas "PET and<br>
"Timer" alarms last longer (typically between 30 and 60 seconds). The operator<br>
can stop the alarm without interrupting the counting of time which, in all three<br>
cases, continues to count forward without stopping. This continuous count is<br>
advantageous in that it informs the operator of the time elapsed since the "zero"<br>
time was crossed.<br>
- "GMT must be set before "TV' and "T2" which are set according to the<br>
time zone differential since "GMT.<br>
- "TV, "T2", or "GMT must be set before "MET, for which the zero time<br>
can be defined in one of these three time scales.<br>
- "GMT or "MET must be set before "PET, for which the zero time can<br>
only be defined in the time scale "GMT or "MET.<br>
- in a preferred embodiment, when setting "MET or "PET, the operator<br>
is given the option of selecting no reference time in order to notify that there is<br>
no "mission" or "phase" underway. "MET or "PET, respectively, no longer<br>
need to be displayed.<br>
A practical embodiment of the watch according to the invention will now<br>
be described as well as command means for setting it, i.e. the input and entry of<br>
data and the display of this data, with reference to figure 8.<br>
In figure 8, all elements identical to those in figures 1 to 7C bear the<br>
same references and will not be re-described unless so required.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the watch 1, four push-buttons, 5, 6, 7<br>
and 9, suffice to command (settings and displays) the watch's times and<br>
functions. Push-buttons are favoured over dial buttons, since they do not<br>
require removal of the watch 1 from the user's wrist for adjustment. The control<br>
buttons, 5, 6, 7 and 9, are disposed advantageously, to begin with,<br>
symmetrically on each side of the watch 1, then in the upper (buttons 5 and 6)<br>
and lower (buttons 7 and 9) sections of its sides, in such a way as to prevent<br>
the presence of a button in the central zone which could create a hard pressure<br>
point on the back of the user's wrist when bending the hand.<br>
The digital display zones, 30 to 41, are subdivided into what will be<br>
referred to as fields hereafter:<br>
- Zone 30: fields 300, 301 and 302;<br>
- Zone 3 : unique field 31;<br>
-Zone 32: unique field 320;<br>
- Zone 40: unique field 410;<br>
-Zone 41: fields 410, 411 and 412;<br>
In brief, the operating procedure for these control buttons is<br>
advantageously the following:<br>
- Time scales and functions are selected in order, by quick pressing<br>
action on button 7 or in reverse order by quick pressing action on button 5.<br>
- The setting mode for a time or a function is started, starting from the<br>
normal display of this time or of this function, by pressing action on button 5 for<br>
over 2 seconds. The setting fields are then selected cyclically by successive<br>
pressing action on button 6. The field subject to the setting operation is<br>
identified by the flashing of the current value. The first adjustable field (flashing)<br>
in the cycle is that of the first adjustable parameter of the time or of the current<br>
function. For example, for the "77 setting, it concerns field 310 but, for the<br>
"TMR", the first flashing field is the field 400 indicating the counting direction<br>
sign (positive or negative).<br>
- The time scale "T1" or "T2" that is required to be shown by the hands is<br>
selected by exerting long simultaneous pressing action on buttons 7 and 5<br>
during the standard display of the required time scale. The cycle of the time<br>
scale's adjustable fields thereby selected ("T1" or "T2") enables the setting of<br>
hands independently from the digital display which, in practice, enables the<br>
display of a third time scale if so required.<br>
- The last field (flashing) of the full cycle of all adjustable fields is the one<br>
that indicates the time or the function currently being set; pressing once on<br>
button 5 then ends the setting mode. After having initiated the setting mode, if<br>
the only button handled during a full cycle of field change is button 6, pressing<br>
button 5 again will end the setting mode without any changes being applied to<br>
the time or to the function currently displayed.<br>
- Upon starting the "MET", "AL" or "PET" setting mode, the default<br>
reference time is the time scale which was used for the previous setting<br>
operation carried out on these functions.<br>
- During a setting operation, pressing button 7 or 5 for a long time<br>
accelerates the setting operating by making the characters scroll fast in the field<br>
that is flashing.<br>
- When an alarm is activated because "MET" or "PET" or the "TMR" has<br>
just crossed the zero time, pressing quickly on button 5 stops the alarm without<br>
any other action on the watch.<br>
To fix ideas, the tables, "77' TABLE, "T2" TABLE, "GMT TABLE, "MET" TABLE, "AL" TABLE, "CHR" TABLE, "TMR" TABLE, and "PET" TABLE, at the<br>
end of the present description illustrate in a more detailed manner the settings<br>
of a watch 1 conform with the invention.<br>
Generally, to improve the description's clarity, the reference numbers for<br>
push-buttons, 5, 6, 7 and 9, are positioned between "( )", reference numbers for<br>
fields are positioned between "[ ]". Furthermore, the "*" character means "single<br>
or repeated short pressing action(s)" and the "**" character means "long<br>
pressing action typically greater than 2 seconds".<br>
Figure 9 illustrates in a schematic manner, in block diagram form, the<br>
electronic circuits 8 necessary for the operation of the watch 1 according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The four control buttons, 5, 6, 7 and 9, act as input components for<br>
entering data into the watch 1.<br>
Said buttons are linked, on one side, to a source of power, for example<br>
positive "V+", arbitrarily representing a logic "1" when the push-button is<br>
operated and on the other side to logic circuits 80, that will be referred to as<br>
"decoder".<br>
This decoder comprises combinational logic circuits (based on standard<br>
logic circuits "AND", "OR", "EXCLUSIVE-OR", etc.) and sequential logic circuits,<br>
as well as pulse counters and count-down counters. It receives several clock<br>
signals generated by clock circuits and time base 83 under the general<br>
reference Hx.<br>
In a per se conventional manner, the circuits generating clock signals Hx<br>
are piloted by a quartz 830. The clock signals Hx are distributed in an<br>
appropriate manner to the other circuit blocks 8, and act notably as a time base<br>
for the watch 1 displays: digital displays, 3 and 4, and 5, analogue display 2.<br>
As specified previously, with reference to the description in figure 8, the<br>
decoder circuits 80 detect, either the unique clock pulses incurred by brief<br>
pressing on one of the control buttons, 5 to 7, a combination of these pulses,<br>
and/or a determined period of time, i.e. long pressing action on one or more of<br>
these buttons 5 to 7.<br>
The circuits 8 are articulated, in a conventional manner around a bus 87<br>
of two-way data transmissions.<br>
The output of the decoder 80 is linked to this bus 87 and data input<br>
operations, during aforementioned settings, are sent to a central unit 81,<br>
comprising a microprocessor or a microcontroller, linked via this bus 87 to a<br>
read-only memory unit 82, of "ROM" (for "Read Only Memory") type or an<br>
alternative non-volatile memory of similar type. This memory unit 82 stores<br>
firmware or micro-instructions managing, in a per se known manner, the<br>
operation of circuits 8 under the command of the microprocessor 81.<br>
The circuits 8 also comprise a random access memory unit 84, for<br>
example of the type called "RAM" (for "Random Access Memory") and/or a<br>
plurality of memory registers.<br>
This memory 84 must comprise memory locations for storing settings<br>
data entered using control buttons 5 to 7, and notably five memory locations,<br>
840 to 844, dedicated to "GMT", "T1", "T2", "MET" and "PET", as well as 84x<br>
locations for the<br>
different alarms. In reality, a higher quantity of memory locations are<br>
necessary. They are assigned, in a permanent or non-permanent manner, to<br>
values such as "period to be timed", etc. Furthermore, different values are<br>
calculated, under the command of the microprocessor 81 and firmware stored in<br>
the memory 82, using aforementioned data or combinations of this data, for<br>
example to generate and display "PET" using the "GMT" or "MET" time scale.<br>
These calculations generate intermediate values which also need to be stored<br>
in locations of the random access memory 84.<br>
The bus 87 is also connected to an interface unit of output 85 distributing<br>
command signals to the two display units: analogue hands 2, more specifically<br>
to a driving motor 20 or an alternative similar component, and digital, 3 and 4.<br>
Preferentially the motor 20 is a step motor receiving forward clock pulses.<br>
This interface unit of output 85 also generates electric command signals<br>
sent to an audio alarm signal generation unit 86.<br>
By reading the above, it is easy to establish that the invention effectively<br>
achieves its set objectives.<br>
It should however be made clear that the invention is not restricted to the<br>
sole examples of embodiments explicitly described, notably in relation with<br>
figures 1 to 9.<br>
For example, the audio alarms can be replaced or doubled with other<br>
types of alarm: visual, vibrating, etc.<br>
Lastly, the numerical examples have only been provided to better fix<br>
ideas and do not comprise a restriction of any kind to the scope of the present<br>
invention. They derive from a technological choice which is easily accessible to<br>
Skilled Professionals.<br>
The watch can, notably, comprise more than five alarms and more than<br>
two local time zones.<br>
"T1" TABLE<br>
Assuming that "T1" is selected as the time scale for hands 2 (the setting<br>
of hands 2 is independent from values on the digital display 3-4 and is only<br>
used to readjust manually the hands 2 on the digital display of "T1", if there is a<br>
difference between the two).<br>
The default value of "T1" at the initial settings operation is equal to<br>
"GMT.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [300] = "T".<br>
(5)** [310] flashes and indicates "GMT,<br>
(7)* or (5)* is used to select flashing indication of "GMT or "H - M"<br>
in the field [310].<br>
If [310] = "GMT", the time zone differential setting starts:<br>
(6)* [320] flashes and indicates the current time zone<br>
differential value.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [320] = the required time zone differential.<br>
The fields [6] and [7] are then changed accordingly. The<br>
hour hand follows the adjustment of the time zone<br>
differential. (The minutes and seconds can only be<br>
corrected when setting the "GMT).<br>
(6)* [300] flashes.<br>
(5)* "T1" returns to standard display, integrating the time zone<br>
differential change.<br>
If [310] = "H - M" the setting of hands starts without affecting the<br>
digital display:<br>
(6)* "H" flashes in the field [310].<br>
(7)* or (5)* until the hour hand indicates the required time. The hour<br>
hand automatically positions itself precisely between two<br>
hour graduations according to the current position of the<br>
minute hand.<br>
(6)* "M" flashes in the field [310].<br>
(7)* or (5)* until the minute hand indicates the required minutes. The<br>
minute hand automatically positions itself precisely<br>
between 2 graduations of 30 minutes according to the<br>
current value of seconds indicated in the field [412].<br>
(6)* [300] flashes.<br>
(5)* The watch 1 exits the setting mode for hands 2 which<br>
follow the selected time scale precisely ('T1" in the<br>
chosen example).<br>
, "T2" TABLE<br>
"T2" is set in the same manner as "T1". If the hands 2 represent "T1" and<br>
the operator wishes to set the hands during the "T2" setting, before proceeding<br>
with the settings, "T2" must be selected as the time scale for hands 2 by<br>
pressing simultaneously (7) and (5) for over 2 seconds.<br>
The possible independent setting of hands 2 in hours and minutes can<br>
enable adjustment of the analogue time (the hands 2) to the time zones which<br>
are not different to "GMT" in full hours.<br>
"GMT' TABLE<br>
The default value of "GMT" at the initial setting is<br>
"Monday 1st January Oh 00m 00s of the year 00"<br>
(In English).<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [300] = "GMT".<br>
(5)** the language selected when the previous settings were<br>
made (for example "F" for French, "E" for English or "S" for<br>
Spanish) flashes in [310]<br>
(7)* or (5)* until the required language appears in the field [310].<br>
(6)* the 2 figures " YY" indicating the previously set year, flash in<br>
[310].<br>
(7)* or (5)* until "YY" = the last two figures of the current year.<br>
(6)* [320] flashes and indicates the current month value.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [320] = the required month. 24 values are proposed:<br>
the 12 possible digital values for the month and the 12<br>
names (shortened to 3 letters) for months in the language<br>
selected in the initial step of the setting operation for the<br>
above "GMT".<br>
(6)* [400] flashes and indicates the current value of the date in<br>
the month.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [400] = the required date.<br>
(6)* [410] flashes and indicates the current time value.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [410] = the required time. The hour hand increments<br>
or decrements by the same quantity of hours as set.<br>
(6)* [411] flashes and indicates the current minutes value.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [411] = the required minutes. The minute hand<br>
increments or decrements by the same quantity of minutes<br>
as set.<br>
(6)* [412] flashes and indicates the current seconds value.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [412] = the required seconds. The minute hand<br>
follows the current adjustment of seconds.<br>
(6)* [300] flashes.<br>
(7)* alternates between the display "M.D.h.m.s." and<br>
"ddd.h.m.s"<br>
(5)* "GMT' starts the time count starting from the time value set<br>
by the above operations. The time "T1" (digital and<br>
analogue), "T2" and "MET" are also corrected automatically<br>
accordingly.<br>
It should be noted that the hour and the minute hand simply follow the<br>
number of pressing actions exerted on the buttons (7) and (5) for the hours and<br>
the minutes respectively and independently of digital values obtained on the<br>
face of the watch 1. Only the digital value of seconds is used effectively for the<br>
fine positioning of the minute hand between two minute graduations.<br>
"MET" TABLE<br>
When the MET is set for the first time, [310] = - - - by default and all<br>
ensuing fields are initialised to zero, meaning that there is no currently defined<br>
"MET".<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [300] = "MET".<br>
(5)** [310] flashes and indicates the time scale used for the<br>
previous setting operation of "MET",<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [310] = the required time scale or '- - - ' if use of<br>
"MET" is complete.<br>
The setting steps differ depending on the scale selected, as follows:<br>
If "GMT" is selected as time reference for setting "MET": (by default at<br>
the initial setting, the zero time is "001 day 0h 00m 00s" which corresponds to<br>
the changeover to a new year, since day 0 does not exist on the calendar)<br>
(6)* [400] flashes and indicates the day in the year (between<br>
001 and 366) used for the previous setting operation.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [400] = the day of the year required for the zero time.<br>
(6)* [410] flashes and indicates the time for the zero time used for<br>
the previous setting operation.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [410] = the required time for zero time.<br>
(6)* [411] flashes and indicates the minutes for the zero time<br>
used for the previous setting operation.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [411] = the required minutes for the zero time.<br>
(6)* [412] flashes and indicates the seconds for the zero time<br>
used for the previous setting operation.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [412] = the required seconds for the zero time.<br>
(6)* [300] flashes.<br>
(5)* MET counts and displays remaining time until, or the time<br>
elapsed since, the new value of the zero time.<br>
If the operator prefers to set "MET" according to a date expressed in<br>
"Month-Day" in the "GMT time scale, this display mode must first be selected<br>
for "GMT according to the aforementioned "GMT" setting instructions. "MET" is<br>
set according to "GMT in exactly the same manner as when setting "MET" according to "T1" or "T2" as described below.<br>
If "T1" or "T2" is selected as time reference for the "MET" setting: (by<br>
default at the initial setting, the zero time is "1st January 0h 00m 00s")<br>
(6)* [320] flashes and indicates the month used for the<br>
previous setting operation.<br>
(7)* or (5)* until [320] = the required month for zero time. The month<br>
values proposed are of the same type - digital or textual -<br>
as the display mode for months in the time scale selected<br>
as reference.<br>
(6)* [400] flashes and indicates the value of the date in the<br>
month used for the previous setting operation.<br>
