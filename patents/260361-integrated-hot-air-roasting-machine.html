				<td>Field of Invention;<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated hot air roasting machine for roasting / toasting of cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to-eat snack foods. An integrated hot air roasting machine henceforth will be referred to as a device. The device of the present invention is particularly relates to an integrated hot air roasting machine using flue gas useful for roasting / toasting cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to-eat snack foods, which enhances the organoleptic properties and the device comprises of the roasting, resting and cooling operation in a single machine, which are done sequentially. The product processed by using this device has uniform color, moisture and other sensorial properties, and the material is processed under hygienic conditions in a continuous manner. Background and prior art of the invention;<br>
Incase a device is made available for roasting / toasting cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to - eat snack foods continuously, would result in reduction in human drudgery, clean and hygienic end product free from sand, ash and will have uniform color and uniform roasting. The device is energy efficient as the hot air is recirculated. The patent search showed batch type roasters are patented in Federal Republic of Germany, patent No. DE 3116723 C2. There is only one report where vibratory mode was employed in fluidized bed roaster (Weyell, 1997) Patent No. 0039 - 4653. This unit from Vibro (Germany), was used for roasting hazelnuts, desiccated coconut etc. However, this unit happens to be a batch type unit and doesn't use flue gas for roasting purposes.<br>
Presently the roasters are of batch type, continuous sand roasters, rotary type roasters and air jet roasters. In all the above roasters the unit operations of heat treatment, heat/moisture stabilization followed by cooling are done separately. The major problems in these roasters are non uniform roasting, color, scorched and blackened particles, sand and ash entrapment after processing, which leads to poor quality product. These units are tedious in operation and the operator has to work under the direct influence of smoke and flame and sand roasters are not suitable for roasting of spices like chilies, coriander etc.<br><br>
In case a suitable device is made available for continuous roasting of cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to-eat snack foods which would result in reduction in hardship, clean and hygienic end product free from sand and ash and will have uniform color of roasting etc. Realizing the importance and necessity, Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore has successfully developed a device for roasting / toasting cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to - eat snack foods.<br>
Hitherto the process of roasting / toasting of cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to-eat snack foods is done either in rotating units or conveyorised units. Rotary units have the standard ovens for roasting all types of flakes in break fast food industry. Flakes are difficult to roast in fixed position on flat board leading to uneven product color. Where as rotary ovens suspend flakes in heated air, which heats all surfaces evenly and results in uniform roasting and color. Rotary units consist of an insulated outer shell, with an inner-rotating cylinder. The inner shell is made up of plain carbon steel and the outer shell, is of mild steel and insulated suitably. Perforated inner shell is used for large flakes as corn, wheat, where as non-perforated cylinders is employed for handling small product. An important feature of rotary type roasting units is the presence of lifters inside the inner cylinders for uniform mixing of the product. Band roasters are used for large products of thickness 6-20 mm and for those that will crumble in the drum. These are quite simple units in which conveyor moves through the oven chamber and can be direct or indirect fired. A more efficient roaster is a jet zone unit, in which hot air is forced through the nozzle, which directs high velocity air jets on to the product. This result in more uniform product than conveyor roasted products. But jet zone unit is not suitable for roasting of oil seeds, breakfast foods etc., as the air jet is of high velocity and would damage the final shape of the product.<br>
The drawbacks of using the above types of roasters are:<br>
&gt;	There is no uniformity in roasting.<br>
&gt;	Cereals, pulses, oil seeds, spices and breakfast foods cannot be roasted in a single device.<br>
&gt;	Roasting of unsorted material is not possible.<br>
&gt;	The roasted material will not have uniform color.<br><br>
&gt;	The product will have scorched / blackened particles.<br>
&gt;	The end product will be contaminated with sand and ash.<br>
&gt;	The operation is tedious and the operator has to work under the threat of flame and smoke.<br>
&gt;	The unit operation like resting and cooling are to be done separately.<br>
&gt;	Sand roasters are not suitable for spices like chilies, coriander etc.<br>
&gt;	The jet zone roaster would damage the products final shape and is not suitable for breakfast foods and spices like chilies.<br>
&gt;	These units don't have recirculation of the spent hot air.<br>

We propose a device useful for roasting / toasting of cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to - eat snack foods, for the first time according to this invention.<br><br>
The invention is based on our finding that roasting / toasting of cereals, pulses, spices, oil seeds and ready to - eat snack can be of uniform roasting, color and other sensorial properties under hygienic conditions using this device.<br>
The raw material is fed in to the roaster by using a vibratory feeder mounted on the main frame. The feed rate of the input raw material can be controlled by using a variac housed inside the panel board. The material is roasted to its characteristic flavour during its travel along the perforated sieve. The time and temperature of roasting / toasting can be varied to suit the raw material and its initial moisture content and the roasted / toasted material is obtained at the outlet of the roasting deck. The hot air is generated in the combustion chamber of the hot air roasting machine by burning liquid petroleum gas. A blower mounted on the main frame generates a stream of air to be mixed with the flue. The generated hot air is blown across the perforated sieve mounted on the vibrating deck. Regulating the supply of LPG / NG can control the temperature of the hot air. The vibrating deck is mounted on the main frame through helical springs. The vibration motor imparts vibrations to the deck through the eccentrically mounted dead weights. Varying the speed of the vibration motor and the position of the dead weights can control the frequency of vibration and its amplitude. The quality of roasting / toasting can be controlled by varying the frequency of vibration, by varying the amplitude of vibration and by controlling the hot air temperature. The roasted material is then transferred to the resting deck of the hot air roasting machine through a chute and the material is allowed to rest on the plain plate of the resting deck for a pre determined time and the material is then transferred to the cooling deck of the hot air roasting machine. The roasted material is then transferred to the cooling deck and cold air is blown using another air blower and the material is cooled to the room temperature. The residence time of cooling is adjusted by varying the speed of the vibration motor through a variable speed drive. The roasted and cooled material is obtained continuously after passing the material through these three stages of operations.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
The wheat to be roasted is fed in to the hopper mounted on to the vibratory feeder. The wheat is fed on to the perforated sieve at a feed rate ranging between 100 kg / h. The air velocity has been set at 1.4 m / s, at an air temperature ranging between 300°C. The residence time of roasting of wheat was set at 50 seconds according to the variety of the input raw material. The temperature of the roasted wheat will be around 85 °C. The roasted wheat was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air roasting machine to the resting chamber, where the material is held inside this chamber for the moisture to stabilize. The material is then allowed in to the cooling chamber to cool the material to the room temperature of around 30°C with the final moisture of around 5%. The roasted wheat was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air roasting machine and collected in the tray.<br>
Example 2<br>
The working of the roaster is explained below with particular reference to roasting of soji. The soji to be roasted is fed in to the hopper mounted on to the vibratory feeder. The soji is fed on to the perforated sieve vibrating along with the deck and hood, at a feed rate ranging between 60 kg / h. The air velocity has been set at 0.75 m / s, at an air temperature ranging between 300°C. The residence time for roasting of soji was set at 45 seconds according to the variety of the input raw material. The temperature of the roasted soji will be around 80 degree centigrade. The roasted soji was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air roasting machine to the resting chamber, where the material is held inside this chamber for the moisture to stabilize. The material is then allowed in to the cooling chamber to cool the material to the room temperature of around 30°C with the final moisture of around 5%. The roasted soji was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air roasting machine and collected in the tray.<br>
Example 3<br><br>
The working of the roaster is explained below with particular reference to roasting of vermicelli. The vermicelli to be roasted is fed in to the hopper mounted on to the vibratory feeder. The vermicelli is fed on to the perforated sieve vibrating along with the deck and hood, at a feed rate ranging between 80 kg / h. The air velocity has been set at<br>
2.0	m / s, at an air temperature ranging between 300°C. The residence time for roasting of<br>
vermicelli was set at 45 seconds. The temperature of the roasted vermicelli will be around<br>
85 °C. The roasted vermicelli was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air<br>
roasting machine to the resting chamber, where the material is held inside this chamber<br>
for the moisture to stabilize. The material is then allowed in to the cooling chamber to<br>
cool the material to the room temperature of around 30°C with the final moisture of<br>
around 5.5%. The roasted strands of the vermicelli were of light brown in color. The<br>
roasted vermicelli was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air roasting<br>
machine and collected in the tray.<br>
Example 4<br>
The working of the roaster is explained below with particular reference to roasting of cocoa bean. The cocoa bean to be roasted is fed in to the hopper mounted on to the vibratory feeder. The cocoa bean is fed on to the perforated sieve vibrating along with the deck and hood, at a feed rate ranging between 60 kg / h. The air velocity has been set at<br>
2.1	m / s, at an air temperature ranging between 350 °C. The residence time for roasting<br>
of cocoa bean was set at 25 seconds. The temperature of the roasted product was 110 °C.<br>
The roasted cocoa was discharged through the out let chute of the hot air roasting<br>
machine to the resting chamber, where the material is held inside this chamber for the<br>
moisture to stabilize. The material is then allowed in to the cooling chamber to cool the<br>
material to the room temperature of around 30°C with the final moisture of around 5.5%.<br>
The roasted beans were of uniform shape and texture. The roasted cocoa was discharged<br>
through the out let chute of the hot air roasting machine and collected in the tray.<br>
The roasted product is free from contaminants like sand, ash etc. and the roasting operation is carried out in hygienic conditions. The product obtained after roasting is<br><br>
uniform in color, texture and even unsorted raw materials can be used for roasting. The chemical analysis indicated that the interaction of proteins of the product with the hydrocarbons of the gaseous fuel is insignificant (much below the international permitted limits). The startup / heat up time and shutdown time of the roaster are instantaneous unlike other roasters which need at least 30 minutes and the hot air is recirculated through the blower. The instant heat up of heat transfer medium and recirculation of hot air increases the thermal efficiency of the roaster. The hot air roasting machine is suitable for roasting / toasting of the wide variety of raw material like cereals, pulses, ready to eat snack foods, oil seeds and spices, which is not possible in other types of roaster. Different types of roasters / toasters are needed for different raw materials and each has its drawbacks.<br>
