				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for the manufacture of one or more gases and to<br>
an apparatus for the carrying out of a method of this type.<br>
In the method, a liquid containing the gas to be produced is treated electrolytically.<br>
One or more gases are formed by the electrolysis. The method in particular serves<br>
to produce hydrogen or hydrogen and oxygen, the latter in particular as a mixture<br>
(oxyhydrogen).<br>
Methods for the manufacture of hydrogen or of hydrogen and oxygen or of<br>
oxyhydrogen are already known. Water is used for this in the typical electrolytic<br>
methods. The water molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen. However, the<br>
efficiency and the reaction rate of the previously known methods are suitable for<br>
improvement.<br>
An apparatus for the electrolytic production of hydrogen and oxygen is known from<br>
US-A 5,879,522 which comprises an anode chamber and a cathode chamber in<br>
which electrically conductive ultramicroelectrode particles are present which are in<br>
each case in contact with the cathode and the electrode and which serve the<br>
improvement of the conductivity and the minimization of overpotentials.<br>
A method for the electrolysis of water is known from JP 2002-322584 A in which the<br>
reaction is supported by a fine jewel powder or rock powder or by a fine powder of<br>
different types of minerals or metals. The fine powders are intended to improve the<br>
conductivity.<br><br><br>
DE 100 16 591 C2 discloses a method of generating hydrogen in<br>
which a first electrolyte is provided in the interior space of a<br>
hollow microfiber and a second electrolyte is provided outside<br>
the hollow microfiber. The hollow microfiber bears anode and<br>
cathode separately on its wall surfaces.<br>
US 2001/0050234 A1 discloses an electrolytic cell comprising a<br>
first electrode and a second electrode between which an<br>
electrolytic membrane is arranged. An electron-exchange resin can<br>
be used for the electrolytic membrane<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide an improved method<br>
of the initially recited type.<br>
This object is solved in accordance with the features of the<br>
invention. A substance is present in the liquid to which the or<br>
one of the gases adheres which is to be produced by the<br>
electrolysis. This gas preferably adheres to the substance in an<br>
ionic bond.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are described<br>
in the following paragraphs.<br><br><br>
It is advantageous if hydrogen, preferably in an ionic bond*<br>
adheres to the substance present in the liquid.<br>
The gas to be produced is preferably hydrogen.<br>
The gases to be produced can be hydrogen and oxygen. It is<br>
possible in this process to produce hydrogen and oxygen<br>
separately. It is, however, also possible to produce hydrogen and<br>
oxygen in a mixture (oxyhydrogen). The native production of<br>
oxyhydrogen is particularly advantageous. In accordance with the<br>
method in accordance with the invention, the oxyhydrogen can be<br>
produced in the correct (stoichiometric) mixture ratio. It can in<br>
particular be used in this form for the production of energy.<br><br><br>
The liquid containing the or a gas to be produced is preferably water.<br>
A further advantageous further development is characterized in that the substance<br>
to which the or a gas to be produced adheres is an ion exchanger. This substance<br>
can in particular be an ion-exchange resin.<br>
The ion exchanger is preferably an acid ion exchanger, in particular a very acid ion<br>
exchanger.<br>
The substance to which the or a gas to be produced adheres or the ion exchanger<br>
can be gel-like.<br>
It is advantageous for the ion exchanger to comprise or consist of a matrix, active<br>
groups and ions to be exchanged. The matrix can in particular be a crosslinked<br>
plastic, in particular crosslinked polystyrene. The active groups are preferably<br>
sulfonic acid groups (SO3). The ions to be exchanged are preferably hydrogen ions<br>
(H). The ion exchanger can in particular have the general chemical formula R - SO3<br>
-H.<br>
A further advantageous further development is characterized in that the substance<br>
to which the or a gas to be produced adheres or the ion exchanger, in particular the<br>
base ion exchanger material, contains catalytically acting substances. The<br>
catalytically acting substances can in particular be conductive substances, in<br>
particular conductive films. The catalytically active substances can be mixed to the<br>
substance or to the ion exchanger or to the base ion exchanger material.<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous further development, the substance to<br>
which the or a gas to be produced adheres or the ion exchanger or the base ion<br>
exchanger material contains catalytically acting and/or gas delivering enzymes.<br>
Organic acids, in particular tartaric acid, are used as such enzymes. The enzymes<br><br><br>
can be added to the substance or to the ion exchanger or to the<br>
ion-exchange resin or to the base ion exchanger material.<br>
An apparatus for the carrying out of the method is characterized<br>
by the features of the invention. It includes a container<br>
comprising a liquid as well as a positive electrode and a<br>
negative electrode which can be or are connected to a current<br>
source. A substance is present in the liquid to which the or a<br>
gas to be produced in the electrolysis adheres.<br>
An electrode is preferably tubular in design.<br>
A filler material can be present in the liquid containing the gas<br>
to be produced and a substance to which the gas to be produced<br>
adheres, in particular inside the tubular electrode. This<br>
material is preferably wad material.<br>
An acid preferably present in the filler material. This material<br>
is preferably wetted with an acid. The acid is preferably<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br><br><br>
In contrast to US 2001/0050234 Al, no proton conductive membrane<br>
is required in accordance with the invention. It is possible with<br>
the invention not to integrate the substance to which the or a<br>
gas to be produced adheres, in particular an ion exchanger, into<br>
a membrane. It is possible to arrange this substance or ion<br>
exchanger such that it can be in communication both with the<br>
anode and with the cathode and with the liquid. It is furthermore<br>
possible to use an electrically non-conductive substance to which<br>
the or a gas to be produced adheres, in particular an<br>
electrically non-conductive ion exchanger. It is made possible by<br>
the invention to use a substance to which the or a gas to be<br>
produced adheres, in particular an ion exchanger, in which the<br>
marginal groups adhering thereto by ionic bonding and/or by<br>
van der Waals forces are released in the electrolysis.<br><br><br>
An embodiment of the invention will be explained in detail in the followinq with<br>
reference to the enclosed accompanying drawing. In the drawing, the<br>
only Figure shows an apparatus for the production of<br>
oxyhydrogen in a schematic view.<br>
The apparatus shown in the only Figure comprises a container 1 which is designed<br>
rotationally symmetrically around the center axis 2 and consists of a tubular housing<br>
3 which is closed by an upper cover 4 and a lower cover 5. The total apparatus is<br>
preferably made longer than shown.<br>
An annular outer electrode 6 is provided at the inner wall of the housing 3. A tubular<br>
inner electrode 7 is located in the interior of the housing 3. The container 1 is filled<br>
with water 9 up to the water level 8.<br>
An ion exchanger 10, which is present in gel-like form up to the level 11, is present<br>
between the electrodes 6 and 7.<br>
The outer electrode 6 is connected to the plus pole of a power source 13, for<br>
example a 12V car battery, via a switch 12. The minus pole of the power source 13<br>
is connected to the inner electrode 7. The polarity can, however, also be reversed.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the water level 8 is above the level 11 of the gel-like ion<br>
exchanger 10 and above the upwardly open tube of the inner electrode 7. The<br>
electrode 7 can, however, also be made closed. Another possibility consists of the<br>
electrode 7 projecting beyond the water level 8. Furthermore, in the embodiment<br>
shown, the level 11 of the gel-like ion exchanger 10 is just beneath the upper end of<br>
the outer electrode 6. The apparatus can, however, also be designed such that this<br>
level 11 lies above the upper end of the electrode 6. The inner electrode 7 can be<br>
downwardly closed or open. It can furthermore be open at its lower end or sealingly<br>
connected to the lower cover 5.<br><br><br>
When the switch 12 is closed, an electrolytic reaction takes place in the container 1<br>
in which negatively charged electrons and ions are attracted by the positive outer<br>
electrode 6. Positive ions migrate to the negative inner electrode 7. In this manner,<br>
oxyhydrogen is produced in the space 14 between the water level 8 and the upper<br>
cover 4, with this being a question of a native production of oxyhydrogen. This<br>
reaction is substantially accelerated by the ion exchanger 10. The oxyhydrogen is<br>
present in a stoichiometric ratio. It can be drawn out (not shown in the drawing) of<br>
the space 14. This can take place discontinuously (batch operation) or<br>
continuously. It is furthermore possible to collect and drain off the hydrogen<br>
produced and the oxygen produced separately by a corresponding design of the<br>
container 1.<br>
The ion exchanger 10 is a highly acid, gel-like ion exchanger with sulfonic acid<br>
groups as the active groups. The ion exchanger has the general chemical formula<br>
R - SO3 - H, where R is a matrix, in particular a crosslinked polystyrene matrix, SO3<br>
is a sulfonic active group and H is hydrogen.<br>
The ion exchanger 10 is preferably kept in motion. This preferably takes place such<br>
that the ion exchanger 10 does not subside. The ion exchanger can be kept in<br>
motion by a fluidized bed process. If the ion exchanger is kept in motion the gas<br>
production and the electron flow are improved.<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous further development, the ion exchanger<br>
is kept in suspension in the liquid. This preferably takes place in that the ion<br>
exchanger or the base ion exchanger material are produced such that they remain<br>
in suspension per se in the liquid, that is in the water 9.<br>
The method can be carried out continuously. For this purpose, the ion exchanger<br>
10 can be supplied and drained off continuously (not shown in the drawing). The<br>
drained off ion exchanger can be regenerated and supplied again.<br>
The method can also be carried out in multiple stages.<br><br><br>
The gas which is formed can be sucked out of the space 14. It is possible for this<br>
purpose to generate a vacuum in this space 14. It can hereby furthermore be<br>
achieved that the gas escaping upwardly takes along the ion exchanger 10 and in<br>
this manner effects a mixing and spreading of the ion exchanger 10.<br>
The pressure and the temperature can be set such that the process operates at an<br>
ideal efficiency.<br>
The measured values shown in the following were determined in practical<br>
experiments:<br>

4	8.1	5.7	46.17	115	20.7	0.448<br>
Experiment No. 1 is a comparative experiment which was carried out in water<br>
without ion exchanger. A low amount of ion exchanger was used in Experiment No.<br>
2. Experiment No. 3 was carried out with a large amount of ion exchanger. In<br>
Experiment No. 4, a low amount of hydrochloric acid was additionally added.<br>
In Experiment No. 1 a current of 1.0 A is supplied at a voltage of 10.2 V so that the<br>
supplied electrical power amounts to 10.2 W. In this process, 10 ml/min<br>
oxyhydrogen is produced, which corresponds to an energy content per time to the<br>
amount of 1.8 W. This results in an efficiency of (1.8 : 10.2 =) 0.176.<br><br><br>
By the addition of the ion exchanger, the amperage per added amounts increases<br>
via 3.0 to 7.5 A, while the voltage correspondingly drops via 9.2 V to 6.5 V. The<br>
amount of oxyhydrogen produced increases via 40 ml/min to 100 ml/min. The<br>
efficiency increases via 0.260 to 0.370.<br>
Due to the addition of a low amount of hydrochloric acid in Experiment No. 4, the<br>
amperage increases further to 8.1 A and the voltage drops further to 5.7 V. The<br>
amount of oxyhydrogen produced increases further to 115 ml/min, whereby the<br>
efficiency increases to 0.448.<br>
Example 2:<br>
The experimental arrangement shown in the only Figure was used, but with the<br>
polarity being reversed. The housing 3 forming the minus electrode is designed as<br>
a tube with a length of 116 mm, an internal diameter of 26 mm and an external<br>
diameter of 28 mm. The inner electrode 7 forming the plus electrode is designed as<br>
a tube with a length of 116 mm, an internal diameter of 14 mm and an external<br>
diameter of 16 mm. A battery charger 13 is used as the power source which emits a<br>
DC current with a voltage of 12 V. Styrene-DVB of the company Amberlit was used<br>
as the ion exchanger which is available in the form of dark amber balls. The<br>
functional group of this ion exchanger is formed by sulfonic acid. The interior of the<br>
inner electrode 7 was filled with wadding (without any further additive).<br>
To carry out the experiments, the electrode arrangement is filled with 50 ml drinking<br>
water, which corresponds to an amount of substance of 2.75 mol. The total<br>
arrangement is put completely "under water" so that a liquid exchange can take<br>
place between the interior of the inner electrode 7 and the annular space between<br>
the inner electrode 7 and the housing 3, and indeed both over the upper end of the<br>
inner electrode 7 and over its lower end, that is the intermediate space between the<br>
lower end of the inner electrode 7 and the lower cover 5. The drinking water has a<br>
pH of 7.0, an electrical conductivity of 266 µS/cm (at 25°C) and a water hardness of<br><br><br>
5.4 dH°. When the DC voltage is applied, the values shown below result in<br>
dependence on the added amount of ion exchanger for the amperage, the voltage,<br>
the power and the mass of oxyhydrogen (KG) which is formed per time and which is<br>
given as the standard volume, with the already described ion exchanger being<br>
used:<br><br>

12	4.60	7.60	34.96	70.0	25<br>
No ion exchanger was added in the first Experiment. 5.0 ml/min oxyhydrogen was<br>
produced. This amount is doubled by the addition of 1 ml ion exchanger. The<br>
amount of oxyhydrogen produced per minute increases as the amount of ion<br>
exchanger increases.<br>
Example 3:<br>
The same experimental arrangement as in Example 2 was used, but with the length<br>
of the housing 3 and of the inner electrode 7 being increased from 116 mm to 270<br><br>
mm. The experimental arrangement has otherwise not been changed. The following<br>
measured values resulted:<br><br>
The method in accordance with the invention can be carried out in the manner such<br>
that a substance to which the gas to be produced adheres, in particular in an ionic<br>
bond, e.g. an acid cation exchanger, is added as a catalyst and donor to a liquid, in<br>
particular water, in the electrolysis so that the decomposition of the substance to be<br>
decomposed, e.g. water, is accelerated by a multiple factor, with the added<br>
substance not being an acid and not being a base and not being an ion exchange<br>
membrane. In a particular aspect, an ion exchanger, in particular a cation exchange<br>
resin and/or an anion exchange resin, is added to the electrolysis procedure known<br>
per se e.g. on the electrolysis of water for the production of hydrogen and oxygen or<br>
oxyhydrogen and serves as a catalyst to increase the current flow and can<br>
simultaneously contribute to the carrying out of the process as a donor of hydrogen<br>
and/or oxygen. In this manner, efficiencies of 0.6 to 0.85 can be achieved in<br><br><br>
dependence on the embodiment at an intensity of current of, for example, 3,900<br>
C/min. A corresponding apparatus can produce oxyhydrogen in a quantity of 14.6<br>
l/h. The apparatus for the production of oxyhydrogen can be a component of an<br>
engine and natively produce oxyhydrogen required for the engine. In this manner, a<br>
liquefying and storing of the oxyhydrogen can be made superfluous since it can be<br>
produced continuously in the required amount. It is, however, also possible to<br>
produce and utilize hydrogen and oxygen separately.<br>
A filler material, in particular wadding, can be present in the interior of the tubular<br>
electrode 7. This material or the wadding can be wetted with an acid, preferably<br>
hydrochloric acid. The yield can hereby be substantially increased, as recited in<br>
Example 1, Experiment No. 4.<br>
The electrolytically treated liquid can be water. Other liquids are, however, also<br>
possible which contain the gas to be produced, e.g. hydrogen or another<br>
substance.<br><br><br>
