				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing Transfer Metallized Paper. Back Ground of Invention<br>
The Labels for Labeling of goods are usually made by using or combining the following materials: paper and coated paper, polyethylene, fabrics and laminated plastic film. Such labeling of goods usually consists of only one layer of permeable or impermeable materials.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns labeling material of at least two-layered material, where the outer layer may contain the trade/brand name and other particulars and details statutorily required to be mentioned on the product.<br>
The materials used for such labeling mentioned are paper, polyester film, release lacquer, metallic sheet, permeable paper, while the following are impermeable: coated paper, polyester film, release lacquer and metallic sheet.<br>
The above described two-layered labeling are useful for labeling of industrial as well as consumer goods which require to be stored in cold and/or moist conditions. The reason is that when the usual paper labels affixed in the manufactory come in contact with moisture on account of storage in refrigerated conditions then the paper labels and the glue with which it is pasted, absorb moisture and come off easily. The present invention overcomes this problem. The outer layer of the label can contain all the particulars statutorily required to be given on the label in relation to the goods labeled therein as well as the name of the product attractively and colour-fully printed on the label. Hitherto only paper labels were used for labeling the goods.<br><br>
The purpose of the present invention is to solve the above mentioned problem while not denying to the manufacturer, the benefit of attractive labeling and marketing of the goods by using a two layered label of the above mentioned type.<br>
The present invention includes the process of producing the label according to the claims.<br>
Accordingly, a process for preparing the Transfer Metallized Paper having a sheet of base paper, metallized on the other surface, and a process in that, the polyester film is coated with a release lacquer of 2 to 2.5 grams per square meters (GSM) thickness; the release lacquered polyester film is metallized over the layer of release lacquer by vacuum deposition; a separate sheet of paper is coated with a known adhesive of 4 to 6.5 GSM thickness; then, the adhesive coated paper is laminated with the metallized polyester film to release the coated metallized polyester film by a known method; anticurling treatment is imparted to the laminate and; after a curing time of one day at room temperature, separating the laminate, the metal is transferred on to the paper and the paper gets metallized indirectly to produce the Transfer Metallized Paper. Transfer metallized paper as claimed in claim 1 wherein a two-layered paper with a printable lacquered top surface that protects the metallization from oxidization.<br>
The materials required for manufacturing the transfer metallized paper are<br>
a)	paper or board;<br>
b)	polyester film;<br>
c)	aluminum wire;<br>
d)	lacquer resin combination;<br>
e)	adhesive.<br>
In the process, the polyester film is coated with a release lacquer. The release<br>
lacquered polyester film is metallized over the layer of release lacquer by vacuum<br>
deposition. A separate sheet of paper is coated with an adhesive. Then, the<br>
adhesive coated paper is laminated with the metallized polyester film to release the<br>
coated metallized polyester film. Thereafter, anti-curling treatment is imparted to the<br>
laminate.	After a curing time of one day, the laminate is separated, during<br>
which     process     the     polyester     film     is     released     for     reuse     again<br><br>
and the metal is transferred on to the paper to produce the finished product-Transfer Metallized Paper.<br>
For better understanding of the invention, reference is made to figs. 1,2,3 and 4 of the accompanying drawings. (Drawings accompanying the provisional specifications may also be referred to)<br>
The labels for labeling of goods are usually made by using or combining the following materials - paper, coated paper, polyethylene and laminated plastic film and aluminum foil.<br>
The said label consisting of two-layered label material, an inner layer of paper based material, e.g. coated and an outer layer of impermeable metallized film or coating is made in the following way:<br>
Fig 1 shows the process of coating the Polyester Film with release lacquer. The upper layer consists of the Polyester Film and the layer underneath is that of release lacquer.<br>
Fig 2 shows the process of metallizing where the polyester film coated with release lacquer is metallized over the layer of release lacquer, with Aluminum, by vacuum deposition.<br>
Fig 3 shows the process of lamination where the metallized and coated Polyester film is laminated to paper.<br>
Fig 4 shows the process of Anti-curling coat being applied on the metallized and coated Polyester film laminated to paper.<br>
Fig 5 shows the process of polyester film separated from the metallized paper -what is left is finished high gloss transfer metallized paper.<br><br>
It is therefore not crucial to the invention that the goods be stored in dry/non-humid storage or conditions. If the label is properly pasted on the product, the usefulness of the invention is achieved<br>
With the present invention a neat solution is thus achieved to a not so unimportant problem of affixing labels on goods, which by their very nature require being stored in cold and/or humid conditions.<br>
PROCESS<br>
1.	Polyester film is coated with a release lacquer;<br>
2.	The release lacquered polyester film is metallized on the coated side<br>
by vacuum deposition;<br>
3.	A separate sheet of Paper is coated with an adhesive;<br>
4.	Adhesive coated paper is laminated with the metallized polyester film<br>
to release coated metallized polyester film;<br>
5.	After a curing time of one day, the laminate is separated, during which<br>
process the polyester film is released for reuse again and the metal is<br>
transferred on to the paper to produce the finished product-Transfer<br>
Metallized Paper.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide an attractive, printable medium for labeling, gift-wrap, confectionery, cigarette bundling wrap and other applications. The invention has the following advantages:<br>
1. The present invention is an improvement over the existing printing and packaging in that currently paper, polythene and polyester and aluminium foil are used as a medium or directly metallized paper is used which has a dull, lackluster appearance, lesser shine and gloss as compared to transfer metallized paper. The present invention will render labeling and packaging more attractive, aesthetically superior and render higher shelf appeal to the products.<br><br>
2.	In today's environment-conscious world where more and more people are<br>
turning away from plastics as packaging medium, the present invention is<br>
a perfect substitute for the present materials and yet it is biodegradable.<br>
3.	The printing on this transfer metallized paper and its machine ability is<br>
superior to aluminum foil, which it has confirmed in many labeling<br>
application. Because of better machineability the wastages are far lower<br>
than in aluminum foil, which develops permanent creases, which affect the<br>
rolling, adhesion and coating on aluminum foil.<br>
4.	In the labeling application, transfer metallized paper can replace stamping<br>
foil by imparting a close similarity to the stamping foil effect at a much<br>
lower cost.<br>
5.	Labels made out of this transfer metallized paper stick to the bottle even<br>
after refrigeration as opposed to plain paper labels, which, tend to peel off<br>
when the bottles are chilled and attract moisture.<br>
6.	The process involved in the manufacturing of aluminum foil is heavy on<br>
power compared to Transfer Metallized Paper. Above all, a very low per<br>
unit (per sq. meter) quantity of aluminum is required as compared to the<br>
traditional aluminum foil. The above metallized paper uses approximately<br>
only 3% of the aluminum in comparison with Aluminum Foil.<br>
7.	The present invention- Transfer Metallizing can be carried out on any kind<br>
of paper as compared to other directly metallized paper which, requires a<br>
very high grade of paper.<br>
8.	This product is unique because directly metallized papers have to be<br>
produced on specific qualities of base paper and the paper gets metallized<br>
in the metallizing chamber whereas, the transfer metallizing process can<br>
be carried out on any quality of paper and, the paper is not metallized<br>
directly and never enters the metallizing chamber.<br><br>
9.	Such Transfer Metallized paper surface has a special smoothness, sheen<br>
and gloss.<br>
10.	This paper is imparted with a special anti-curl coat that keepd the paper<br>
flat even when water based glues are applied to it during processes such<br>
as beer labeling on automatic labeling machine.<br>
11.	The release coat has both good release properties as well as excellent ink<br>
adhesion  that  makes  it deal for printing  by all  methods  - Flexo,<br>
Rotogravure and offset.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:-<br>
1.	A process for preparing the Transfer Metallized Paper having a sheet of base<br>
paper, metallized on the other surface, and a process in that, the polyester film<br>
is coated with a release lacquer of 2 to 2.5 grams per square meters (GSM)<br>
thickness; the release lacquered polyester film is metallized over the layer of<br>
release lacquer by vacuum deposition; a separate sheet of paper is coated<br>
with a known adhesive of 4 to 6.5 GSM thickness; then, the adhesive coated<br>
paper is laminated with the metallized polyester film to release the coated<br>
metallized polyester film by a known method; anticurling treatment is imparted<br>
to the laminate and; after a curing time of one day at room temperature,<br>
separating the laminate, the metal is transferred on to the paper and the paper<br>
gets metallized indirectly to produce the Transfer Metallized Paper.<br>
2.	Transfer metallized paper as claimed in claim 1 wherein a two-layered paper<br>
with a printable lacquered top surface that protects the metallization from<br>
oxidization.<br>
3.	Transfer metallized paper as claimed in claim (1) wherein the metallized<br>
surface has very high shine and gloss and the base paper can be of any<br>
quality.<br><br>
