5				CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
			The present invention is related to U.S. Patent No, 6,619,291 entitled "Method and<br>
	Apparatus for Catheber-Based Annuloplasty," filed April 24, 2001 and issued Septembcr 16,<br>
	2003, and to co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 09/866,550, entitled 'Method and<br>
	Apparatus for Catheter-Based Annuloplasty Using Local Plications which are each<br>
10	incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	1.		Field of Invention<br>
			The present invention relates generally to techniqves For treating mitra1 valve<br>
	insufficiencies such as mitra1 valve leakage, More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
15	systems and methods for treating a leaking mitra1 valve in a minimally invasive manner,<br>
	2		Description of the Related Art<br>
			Congestive he an failure (CHF), which is often associated with an enlargement of the<br>
	heart, is a leading cause of death. As a result, the market far the treatment of CHF is becoming<br>
	increasingly prevalent. For instance. the trestment of CHE is a leading expenditure of Medicare<br>
20	and Medieaid dollars in the United States of America. Typically, the treatment of CHF enables<br>
	many who suffer from CHF to enjoy an improved quality of life.<br>
			Referring ini0ially to Fig. I, the anatomy of a heart, specifically the left side of a heart,<br>
	will be described. The left side of a heart 104 inoludes a left atrium 108 and a left ventricle 112.<br>
	An aorta 114 receives blood from left ventricle 112 through an aortic valve 120, which serves to<br>
25	prevent regurgitation of blood back into left ventricle 112. A mitra1 valve 116 is disposed<br>
	between left atrium 108 and left ventricle 112, and effectively controls the flow of blood<br>
	between left atrium 108 and left ventricle 112<br>
			Mitra1 valve 116, which will be described below in more detail with respect to Fig. 2a.<br>
	includes an anterior leaflet and a posterior leaflet that are coupled to cordae tendonae 124 which<br>
30	serve as "tension members" that prevent the leaflets of mitra1 valve 116 from opening<br>
	indiscriminately. When left ventricle 12 contracts, cordae tendonae 124 allow the anterior<br>
	leaflet to open upwards until limited, in motion by cordse tendonae 124. Normally. the upward<br>
	limit of opening corresponds to a meeting of the anterior and posterior leaflets and the<br>
1<br><br>
	prevention of backflow, Cordae tendonae 124 arise from a. columnar carnae 128 or, more<br>
	speciftcally, a musculi papillares of colunmae carnal 128.<br>
		Left ventricle 112 includes trabeculae 132 which are fibrous cords of connective tissue<br>
	that are attached to wall 134 of left ventricle 112. Trabeculae 132 are also attached to an<br>
5	inlerventricular septum 136 which separates left ventricle 112 from a right ventricle (not shown)<br>
	of heart 104. Trateculae 132 are generally located in left ventricle 112 below columnae camae<br>
	128.<br>
		Fig, 2a is cut-away top-view representation of mitra1 valve 116 and aortic valve 120.<br>
	Aortic valve 120 has a valve wall 204 that is surrounded-by a skeleton 208a of fibrous material<br>
10	Skeleton 208a may generally be considered to be a fibrous structure that effectively forms a ring<br>
	around aortic valve 120, A fibrous ring 208b, which is substantially the same type of structure<br>
	as skeleton 208a, extends around mitra1 valve 116. Mitra1 valve 116 includes an anteriot leaflet<br>
	212 and a posterior leaflet 216, as discussed above Anterior leaflet 212 and posterior leaflet<br>
	216 are generally thin, flexible membranes, When mitra1 valve 116 is dosed as shown in Fig.<br>
15	2a), anterior leaflei 212 and posterior leaflet 216 are generally aligned and contact one anothier to-<br>
	create a seal. Alternativly, when mitrai valve 116 Js opened, blood may flow through an<br>
	opening crested between anterior leaflet 212 and posterior leaflet 216.<br>
		Many problems relating to mitra1 valve 116 may occur and these insufficiencies may<br>
	cause many types of ailments. Such problems include, but are not limited to, mitra1<br>
20	regurgitation Mitra1 regurgitation, or leakage, is the backflow of blood from left ventricle 112<br>
	into the left atrium 106 due to an imperfect closure of mitra1 valve 116. That is, leakage often<br>
	occurs when a gap is created between anterior leaflet 212 and posterior leaflet 216.<br>
		In general, a relatively significant gap may exist between anterior leaflet 212 and<br>
	posterior leaflet 216 (as shown in Fig. 2b) for a variety of different reasons. POT example, a gap<br>
25	may exist due to congenitd maiformations, because of ischsmic disease, or because a heart has<br>
	been damaged by a previous heart atrack. A gap may also be crested when congestive heart<br>
	failure.e.g cardiomyopathy, or some other type of distress causes a heart to be enlarged. When<br>
	a heart is enlarged, the walls of the heart, e.g., wall 134 of a left ventricle, may stretch or dilate,<br>
	causing posterior leaflet 216 to stretch. It should be appreciated that anterior leaflet 212<br>
30	generally docs not stretch. As shown in Fig. 2b, a gap 220 between anterior leaflet 212 and<br>
	stretched posteriot leaflet 216 is created when wall 134 stretches. Hence, due to the existence<br>
	of gup 220, mitra1 valve 116 is unabte to dose properly, and moy begin to leak.<br>
		Leakage- through mitra1 valve 116 generally causes a heart to operate less efficiently, as<br>
	the heart must work harder to maintain a proper amount of blood flow therethrough. Leakage<br>
35	through mitra1 valve 116, or general mitra1 insufficiency, is often considered to be a precursorto<br>
	CHE. There are generally different levels of symptoms associated with heart failure. Such<br>
2<br><br>
	levels are classified by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification<br>
	system. The levels range from a Class level which is associated with an asymptomatic patent<br>
	who has substantially no physical limitations to a Class 4 level which is associated with a patient<br>
	who is unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort, and has symptoms of<br>
5	cardiac insufficiency even at rest. In general, correcting for mitra1 valve leakage may be<br>
	successful in allowing the NYHA classification grade of a patient to be reduced, For instance, a<br>
	patient with a Class 4 classification may have his classification reduced to Class 3 and, hence, be<br>
	relatively comfortable at rest.<br>
		Treatments used lu correct for mitra1 valve leakage or, more generally, CHF, are<br>
10	typically highly invasive, open-heart surgical procedures. Ventricular assist devices such as<br>
	artificial hearts may be imiplanted in a patient whose own heart is failing. The implantation af a<br>
	ventricular assist device is often expensive, and a patient with a ventricular assist device must be<br>
	placed on extended anti -coagulant therapy. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art,<br>
	anti-coagulant therapy reduces the risk of blood clots being formed, as for example, within the<br>
15	ventricular assist device. While induncing the risks of blood clots associated with the ventriculer<br>
	assist device is desirable, anti-coagulant therapies may increase the risk of uncontrollable<br>
	bleeding in a patient, e.g., as a resull of a fall, which is not desirable.<br>
		Rather than impianting a ventricular assist device, bi-ventricular pacing devices similar<br>
	to pace makers may be implanted in some cases eg., cases in which a heart beats inefficiently in<br>
20	a particular asynchronous manner. While the implantation of a bi-ventricular pacing devica may-<br>
	be effective, not all heart patients are suitable for receiving a bi-ventricular pacing device.<br>
	Further, the implantation of a bi-ventricular pacing device is expensive.<br>
		Open-heart surgical procedures which are intended to correct for mitra1 valve leakage,<br>
	specifically. involve the implantation of replacement valves. Valves from animals, e,gr, pigs,<br>
25	may be used to replace a milral valve 116 in a human. While the use of a pig valve may<br>
	relatively successfully replace a mitra1 valve, such vaves generally wear out thereby requiring<br>
	additional open surgery at a later date. Mechanical valves, which are less, likely to wear out,<br>
	may also be used 10 replace a leaking mitra1 valve, However, when a mechanical valve is<br>
	implanted, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism. and a patient is gensraily required to<br>
30	undergo extended anti-coagulant therapies.<br>
		A less invasive surgical procedure involves heart bypass.surgery associated with a port<br>
	access procedure. For a port access procedure, the heart may be accessed by cutting a few ribs,<br>
	as opposed to opening the entire chest of a patient. In other words, a few ribs may be cut in a<br>
	port access procedure, rather than opening a patient's sternum.<br>
35	One open-heart surgical procedure that is particularly successful in correcting for mitra1<br>
	valve leakage and, in addition, mitra1 regurgitation, is an annutoplasty procedure. During an<br>
3<br><br>
	annuloplasty procedure, an annuloplasty ring may be implanted on the mitra1 valve to cause the<br>
	size of a stretched mitra1 valve 116 to be reduced to a relatively normal size. Fig. 3 is a<br>
	schematic representation of an annuloplasty ring. An annuloplasty ring 304 is shaped<br>
	approximately like-the contour of a normal mitra1 valve That is annuloplasty ring 304 is<br>
5	shaped substantially like the letter "D." Typically, annuloplasty ring 304 may be formed from a<br>
	rod or tube of biocompatible- material e-g, plastic, that has a DACROM mesli covering. <br>
		In order for annuloplasty ring 304 to be implanted, a surgeon surgically attaches<br>
	annuloplasty ring 304 to the mitra1 valve on the arrial side of the mural valve. Conventional<br>
	methods for installing ring 304 require open-heart surgery which involve opening a patient's<br>
10	sternum and placing the patient on a heart bypass machine. As shown in Fig. 4. annuloplasty<br>
	ring 304 is sewn to a posterior leaflet 318 and an anterior leaflet 320 of a lop portion of mitra1<br>
	valve 316. In. sewing annuloplasty ring 304 onto mitra1 valve 316, a surgeon generally<br>
	alternately acquires a relatively large amount of tissue ftom mitra1 tissue, e.g., a one-eighth inch<br>
	bile of tissue, using a needle and thread, followed by a smaller biti from annuloplasty ring 304,<br>
15	Once a thread has loosely coupled annuloplasty ring 304 to mitra1 valve tissue, annuloplasty ring<br>
	304 is slid onto mitra1 valve 316 such that tissue that was previously stretched out, e.g., due to an<br>
	enlarged heart, is effectively pulled in using tension applied by annuloplasty ring.504 and the<br>
	thread which binds annuloplasty ring 304 to the mitra1 valve tissue. As a result, a gap, such as<br>
	gap 220 of Fig. 2b, between anterior leaflet 320 and posterior leaflet 318 may be substantially<br>
20	closed off. After the mitra1 valve is shaped by ring 304, the anterior and posterior leaflets 320,<br>
	318 will reform lo create a new contact line and will enable mitra1 valve 318 to appear and to<br>
	function as a normal mitra1 valve.<br>
		Once implanted, tissue generally gnows over annuloplasty ring 304, and a line of contact<br>
	between annuloplasty ring 304 and mitra1 valve 316 will essentially enable mitra1 valve 316 to<br>
25	appear and function as a normal mitra1 valve. Although a patient who receives annuloplasty ring<br>
	304 may be subjected to anti-coagulant therapies, the therapies are not extensive, as a patient is<br>
	only subjected to the therapies for a matter of weeks,e.g., until tissue grows over annuloplasty<br>
	ring 304.<br>
		A second surgical procedure which is generally effective in reducing mitra1 valve leakage<br>
30	involves placing a single edge-to-edge suture in this mitra1 valve. With reference to Fig. 5a. such<br>
	a surgical procedure, e.g., an Alfieri stitch procedure or a bow-tie repair procedure, will be<br>
	described. An edge-to-edge stitch 404 is used to stitch together an anea at approximately the<br>
	center of a gap 408 defined between an anterior leaflet 420 and a posterior leaflet 418 of a mitra1<br>
	valve 416. Once stitch 404 is in place, stitch 404 is pulled in to form a suture which holds<br>
35	anterior leaflet 420 against posterior leaflet 418, as shown. By reducing the size of gap 408, the<br>
	amount of leakage through mitra1 valve 416 may be- subsantially reduced.<br>
4<br><br>
		Although the placement of edge-to-edge stitch 404 is generally successful in teducing the<br>
	amount of mitra1 valve leakage through gap 408. edge-to-edge stitch 404 is conventionally made<br>
	through open-heart surgery, In addition, the use of edge-to-edge stitch 404 is generally not<br>
	suitable for a patient with an enlarged, dilated heart, as biaod pressure causes the heart to dilate<br>
5	outward, and may pul a relatively large amount of -stress on edge-to-edge stitch 404. For<br>
	instance, blood pressure of approximately 120/80 or higher is typically sufficient to cause the<br>
	heart to dilate outward to the extent that edgt-to-edge stitch 404 may become undone, or tear<br>
	mitra1 valve tissue.<br>
		Another surgical procedure which reduces mitra1 valve leakage involves placing sutures<br>
10	along a mitra1 vaive annulus around the posterior leaflet. A surgical procedure which places<br>
	sutures along a mitra1 valve with be described with respect to Fig. 5b. Sutures 504 are formed<br>
	along an annulus 540 of a mitra1 valve 516 around a posterior leaflet 518 of mitra1 valve 516,<br>
	and may be formed as a double track, e.g., in two "rows," from a single strand of suture material.<br>
	Sutures 504 are tied off at approximately a central point 506 of posterior leaflet 518. Pledgets<br>
15	546 are often positioned under selected sutures 504, e.g., at central point 506, to prevent sutures<br>
	504 from tearing through annulus 540. When sutures 504 are tied off, annulus 540 may<br>
	effectively be tightened to a desired size such that the size of a gap 508 between posterior leaflet<br>
	518 and an anterior leaflet 520 may be reduced.<br>
		The placement of sutures 504 along anuulus 540 in addition to the tightening of sutures<br>
20	504, is generally successful in reducing mitra1 valve leakage. However, the placement of sutures<br>
	504 is conventionally accomplished through open-heart surgical procedures. That is, like other<br>
	conventional procedures, a suture-based annuloplasty procedure is invasive.<br>
		While invasive surgical procedures have proven to be effective in the treatment of mitra1<br>
	valve leakage, invasive surgical procedures often have significant drawbacks, Any time a<br>
25	patient undergoes open-heart surgery, there is a risk of infection. Opening the sternum and using<br>
	a cardiopulmonary bypass machine has also been shown to result in a significant incidence of<br>
	both short and long term neurological deficits. Further, given the complexity of open-heart<br>
	surgery, and the significant associated recovery time, people who are not greatly inconvenienced<br>
	by CHF symptoms, e.g., people at a Class l classification, may choosy not to have corrective<br>
30	surgery. In addition, people who most need open heart surgery, e.g., people at a Class 4<br>
	classification, may either be too frail or too weak to undergo the surgery. Hence, many people<br>
	who may benefit from a surgically repaired mitra1 valve may not undergo surgery.<br>
		Therefore, what is needed is a minimally invasive treatment for mitra1 valve leakage.<br>
	Specifically, whnt is desired is a. method for reducing leakage between an anerior leaflet and a<br>
35	posierior leaflet of a mitra1 valve that does not require conventional surgical intervetion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
5<br><br>
		The present invention relates to a non-invasive method of performing annuloplasty.<br>
	Performing an annuloplasty.on a mitra1 valve by accessing the left ventricle of the heart as for<br>
	example using a catheter, enables complicated surgical procedures to be avoided when treating<br>
	mitra1 valve leakage. Avoiding open-heart surgical procedures generally makes annuloplasty<br>
5	more accessible to patients who may benefit from annuloplasty As mitra1 valve leakage is often<br>
	considered to- be an early indicator of congestive heart failure, a minimally invasive annuloplasty<br>
	procedure that corrects for leakage problems, such as one which involves positioning discrete<br>
	plications in fibrous tissue around the mitra1 valve, may greatly improve the quality of life,of<br>
	many patients who might rot be suitable for invasive annuloplasty procedures.<br>
10		 According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for performing annuloplasty<br>
	includes creating a first plication in the tissue near a mitra1 valve of a heart, using at least a first<br>
	plication element, and creating a second plication in the tissue near the mitra1 valve such that the<br>
	second plication is substantially coupled to the first plication In one embodiment, the method<br>
	also includes accessing a. left ventricle of the heart to provide the first plication element to the<br>
15	left ventricle. and engaging the First plication element to the tissue near the mitra1 valve.<br>
	Engaging the first plication element includes causing the first plication element to substantrially<br>
	pass through a portion of the tissue to substantially anchor the first plication element to the tissue<br>
	near the mitra1 valve.<br>
		According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for performing<br>
20	annuloplasty includes accessing a heart to provide a plurality of plication elements to the heart<br>
	The plurality of plication elements-are provided to the heart through a catheter arrangement, and<br>
	include a first anchor arrangement. The method also includes engaging the first anchor<br>
	arrangement to tissue near a mitra1 valve of the hear using the catherer arrangement by causing<br>
	the first anchor arrangement to substantially pass through the tissue to substantially anchor the<br>
25	first anchor arrangement to the tissue near the mitra1 valve Finally, the method includes<br>
	creating at least a first plication and a second plication using the first anchor arrangement. <br>
		In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, a method for<br>
	performing annuloplasry includes accessing an area of a heart to provide a first plication element<br>
	to the area using a catheter arrangement which has a first portion and a second portion, and<br>
30	substantially anchoring the first portion of the catheter arrangement to tissue near a mitra1 valve<br>
	of the heart The method further includes positioning a tip of the Second portion of the catheter<br>
	arrangement at a first distance from the first portion, and substantially engaging the first anchor<br>
	to the tissue near the mitra1 valve of the heart using the second portion of the catheter<br>
	arrangement, Substantially engaging the first anchor includes causing the first anchor to<br>
35	substantially pass through n portion of the tissue to substantially anchor the first anchor to the<br>
	tissue near the mitra1 valve using the second portion of the catheter arrangement. In one<br>
6<br><br>
	embodiment. substantially anchoring the first portion of the catheter arrangement to tissue near<br>
	the mitra1 valve of the heart includes positioning the first portion of the catheter arrangement<br>
	over a guide that is at least temporarily anchored to the tissue near the mitra1 valve.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
		Invasive, open-heart surgical procedures are generally effective in the treatment of mitra1<br>
15	valve leakage. However, open-heart surgical procedures may be particularly hazardous to some<br>
	patients, e,g, frail patients or patients who are considered as being very ill. and undesirable to<br>
	other patients, e.g., patients who are asymptomatic and do not wish to undergo a surgical<br>
	procedure. Ay such, open-heart surgical procedures to correrct mitra1 valve leakage or, more<br>
	generally, mitra1 valve insufficiency, are not suitable for many patients who would likely benefit<br>
20	from reducing or eliminating the mitra1 valve leakage.<br>
		A catheter-based annuloplasty procedure enables annuloplasty to be performed on a<br>
	patient without requiring that the patient undergo open-heart surgery, or be placed on<br>
	cardiopulmonary bypass. Catheters may be introduced into the left ventricle of a heart through<br>
	the aorta to position a guide wire and plication implants on the ventricular side of a mitra1 valve.<br>
25	i.e., under a mitra1 valve. Catheters may also be used to couple the plication implants to fibrous<br>
	tissue associated with the skeleton of the heart around the mitra1 valve.<br>
		The use of catheters to perform an annuloplasty procedure by delivering and engaging<br>
	plication implants or structures enabled the annuloplasty procedure to be performed without<br>
	open-heart surgery, and without a bypass procedure. Recovery time associated with the<br>
30	annuloplasty, as well as the risks associated with annuloplasty, may be substantially minimized<br>
	when the annuloplasty is catheter-based. As a result annuloplasty becomes a more accessible<br>
	procedure, since" many patients who mighl previously not have received treatment for mitra1<br>
	valve leakage, e.g.. frail patients and asymptomatic patients, may choose to undergo catheter-<br>
	based annuloplasty.<br>
35		To begin a catheter-based annuloplasty procedure, a delivery tube and a j-catheter may<br>
	be inserted into a left ventricle of the heart through the Horta. Inserting the delivery tube and the<br>
11<br><br>
	J-catheter through the aorta ensiles the left ventricle of the heart to be reached substantially<br>
	without conning into contact with trabeculae or the eordae tendgnae in the left ventricle, fig- 6a<br>
	is a diagrammatic representation of a. delivery tube and a J-calheter m accordance with an<br>
	embodiment of the present invention. Delivery tube 604 has a substantially circular cross<br>
5	section, and is configured to receive a J-catheter 608. J-catheter 608 is arranged to move<br>
	longitudinally through and opening in delivery tube 604 as needed.<br>
		In general, delivery tube 604 is an elongated body which may be formed from- a flexible,<br>
	durable, biocompatable material such as nylon, urethane, or a blend of nylon and urelhare, e.g.,<br>
	PEBAX®. Likewise, J-catheter 608 which is also an elongated body, may also be formed from<br>
10	a. biocompatible material. A material used to form J-catheter 608 is typically also relatively<br>
	flexible In the described embodiment, a tip of J-catheter 608 is rigid enough to allow the tip of<br>
	J-catheter 608 to maintain a relatively curved shape, e.g., a "J" shape. The curve in J-catheter<br>
	608 is configured to facilituce the positioning of a gutter catheter, as will be described below<br>
	with respect to Figs. 7a-c.<br>
15		Fig. 6b is a schematic representation of delivery tube 604 and J-catheter 608 positioned<br>
	within a heart in accordance with an Embodiment of the presem invention. As shown, after<br>
	delivery tube 604 and J-catheter 608 are effectively "snaked" or inserted through a femoral<br>
	artery, portions of delivery mbe 604 and of J-catheter 608 are positioned within an aorta 620 of a<br>
	heart 616. A tip 62G of J-catheter 608 which is substantially oriented at a right angle from the<br>
20	body of J-catheter 6O8 and an end of delivery tube 604 are oriented such that they pass through<br>
	an aortic vafve 630- Hence, an end of delivery tube 604 and tip 626 are positioned at a top<br>
	portion of left ventricle 624, where wall 632 of left ventricle 624 is relatively smooth. The<br>
	relative smoothness of the top portion of left ventricle 624 enables a catheter to be properly<br>
	positioned within left ventricle 624 by guiding the lip of the catheter along wall 632. In one<br>
25	embodiment, tip 626 is oriented such that it is positioned approximately just below a mitra1<br>
	valve 628 on the ventricular side of mitra1 valve 628.<br>
		Once, positioned wilhin left venricle 624, J-catherer 608 may be roated within delivery<br>
	tube 604 such that tip 626 is may enable a gutter catheter fed therethrough to run along the<br>
	contour of wall 632- Typically, the gutter catheter runs along the contour of wall 632 in an area<br>
30	that is effectively defined between a plane associated with papillary muscles 640, a plane<br>
	associated with the posterior leaflet of mitra1 valve 628. cordae tendonae 642, and wall 632. A<br>
	"gutter" is located in such an area brregion and more specifically, is positioned subsiantially<br>
	right under mitra1 valve 628 where there is a relatively infiignificani amount of trabeculae.<br>
		With reference to Figs. 7a-7c. 2 gutter catheter will be described in accordance with an<br>
35	embodiment of the present invention. A gutter catheter 704, wnich is part of a catheter assembly<br>
	702 as shown in Fig. 7a, is arranged to be extended through J-catheter 626 such that gutter<br>
12<br><br>
	catheter 704 may be steeted within a left ventricle just beneath a mitra1 valve. Gutter catheter<br>
	704, which may include a balloon tip (not shown), is typically formed from a flexible material<br>
	such as nylon, arethane, of PEBAX®. In one embodiment, gutter catheter 704, which is<br>
	stcerable, may he formed using a shape memory material.<br>
5		As shown in Figs 7a and Fig. 7b, which represents a crass section of catheter assembly<br>
	702 token at a location 710, gutter catheter 704 h at least partially positioned within J-catheter<br>
	608 which, in turn, is at least partially positioned within delivery tube 604, Gutter catheter 704<br>
	may be free to rotate within and extend through J-catheter 608 while j-catheter 608 may be free<br>
	to rotate within and extend through delivery tube 604.<br>
10		Referring next to Fig. 7c. the positioning of gutter catheter 704 within a left Ventricle, of<br>
	the heart will be discribed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, it should<br>
	be appreciated that the representation of gutter catheter 704 within a left ventricle 720 has not<br>
	been drawn to scale, for case of illustration and case of discussion. For instance, the distance<br>
	between a wall 724 of left ventricle 720 and a mitra1 valve 728 has been exaggerated. In<br>
15	addition, it should also be appreciated that the positioning of delivery tube 604 and, hence, J-<br>
	catheier 608 and guner catheter 704 within aortic valve 732 may vary.<br>
		Gutter catheter 704 protrudes through tip 626 of J-catheier 608. and through stcering,<br>
	essentially forms an arc shape similar to that of mitra1 valve. 728 along the contour of a wall 724<br>
	of left ventricle 720 just beneath mitra1 valve 728, i.e.. along the gutter of left ventricle 720.<br>
20	Wall 724 of left ventricle 720 is relatively smooth just beneath mitra1 valve 728, i.e.. generally<br>
	does not include trabeculae. Hence, inserting catheter assembly 702 through an aortic valve 732<br>
	into an upper portion left ventricle 720 allows gutter catheter 704 to he navigated within left<br>
	ventricle 720 along wall 724 substantially wrthorn being obstructed by trabeculae or ordae<br>
	tendemae.<br>
25		Gutter catheter 704 generally includes an opening or lumen (not shown) that is sized to<br>
	accommodate a guide wire through which a guide wife may be inserted. The opening may be<br>
	located along the central axis of gutter catheter 704, i.e. central axis 730 as shown in Fig- 7a.<br>
	Delivering a guide wire through gutter catheter 704 enables the guide wire to-effectively follow<br>
	the contour of wall 724. In general, the guide wire may include an anchoring tip which enables<br>
30	the guide wire to be substantially anchored against wall 724. Fig. 8 is a diagrammatic top-view<br>
	but-away representation of a left side of a heart in which a guide wire has been positioned in<br>
	accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that the<br>
	representation of the left side of a heart in Fig, 8 has not been drawn to scale, and thai various<br>
	features have been exaggerated for ease of discussion. A guide wire 802 is positioned along<br>
35	wall 724 of left venrride 720, Once guide wire 802 is inserted through gutter catheter 704 of<br>
		Figs. 7a-7c and anchored against wall 724-using an anchoring tip 806, gutter catheter 704, along<br>
13<br><br>
	with J-catheter 708, are withdrawn from the body of the patient It should he appreciated that<br>
	delivery tube 604 typically remains positioned within the aorta after guide wire 802 is anchored<br>
	to wall 724.<br>
		Guide wire 802 which may be formed from a material such as stainless steel or a shape<br>
5	memory material, is generally anchored such that guide wire 802 effectively passes along a large<br>
	portion of wall 724. Typically, guide wire 802 serves as a track over which a catheter that<br>
	carries plication structures may be positioned, i.e, a lumen of a catheter that delivers a plication<br>
	element may pass over guide wire 802. Such a catheter may include a balloon structure (not<br>
	shown), or an expandable structure, that may facilitate the positioning of local plication<br>
10	structures by pushing the local plication structures substantially against the fibrous tissue around<br>
	the mitra1 valve.<br>
		Forming local plications causes bunches of the fibrous tissue around the mitra1 valve to<br>
	be captured or gathered. Thereby causing dilation of the mitra1 valve to be reduced. In general,<br>
	the local plications are discrete plications formed in the fibrous tissue around the mitra1 valve<br>
15	using suture structures or discrete mechanical elements. Fig, 9a is a representation of a top-<br>
	down cut-away view of a left ventricle of the heart in which local plication suture structures-<br>
	liave been implanted in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention Suture<br>
	structures which include T-bars 904 and threads 907, are implanted in tissue near a mitra1 valve<br>
	916. e.g, an annulus of rnrtral vatve 916. Typically, the tissue in which sufure structures are<br>
20	implanted is fibrous tissue 940 which is located substantially around mitra1 valve 916. Suitable<br>
	suture structures include, but are not limited to, structures which include T-bars 904 and threads<br>
	907, as will be described below with reference to Figs. 10a, 10b. 11 and 12a-c.<br>
		Since T-bars 904 or similar structure8 when implanted, may cut through tissue 940,<br>
	pledgets 905 may against a veatricular side tissue 940 to effectively cushion" T-bars 904.<br>
25	Hence, portions of T-bars 904 are positioned above mitra1 valve 916, i,e., on an atrial side of<br>
	mitra1 valve 916, whits pledgets 905 arc- positioned on the ventricular side of mitra1 valve 916.<br>
	It should be appreciated that additional or alternative pledgets may be positioned on the atrial<br>
	side of mitra1 valve 916, substantially between tissue 940 and T-bars 904. Catheters which<br>
	deliver suturs.structures 904 to an atrial side of mitra1 valve 916 fram a ventricular side of mitra1<br>
30	valve 916 will be discussed below with respect to Figs. 13a-c.<br>
		In the described embodiment, T-bars 904 are coupled such that every two T-bars e.g. T-<br>
	bars 904a, is coupled by a thread, e.g., thread 907a. Thread 907a is configured to enable T-bars<br>
	904a to be rensioned together and locked against tissue 940. Locking T-bars 904a enables tissue<br>
	940 to he bunched or slightly gathered, thereby effectively constraining the size, e.g. are length,<br>
35	of mitra1 valve 916 by reducing the an are length associated with tissue 940. In other words the<br>
	presence of T-bars 904 which cooperate with thread 907 to function substantially as sutures,<br>
14<br><br>
	allows the size of a gap 908 between an anterior leaflet 920 and a posterior leaflet 918 to be<br>
	reduced and, further, to be substantially prevented from increasing. As will be appreciated by<br>
	those skilled in the art, over lime, scar tissue (not shown) may form over pledgets 905 and T-<br>
	bars 904.<br>
5		Generally, the number of T-bars 904 used to locally bunch or gather tissue 940 may be<br>
	widely varied. For instance, when substantially only a small, localized regurgitant jet occurs in<br>
	mitra1 valve 916 only a small number of T-bars 904 may be implemented in proximity to the<br>
	regurgitant jet. Alternatively, when the size of gap 908 is significant, and there is a relatively<br>
	large amount of mitra1 valve leakage, then a relatively large number of T-bars 904 and, hence,<br>
10	pledgets 905 may be used to reduce the size of gap 908 by reducing the are length of mitra1<br>
	valve 916- Some pledgets 905 may be arranged to at least partially overlap. To correct for a<br>
	regurgitant jet that is centralized to only one section of mitra1 valve 916, T-bars 904 may be<br>
	implemented as plicating elements near the regurgitant jet, and as reinforcing elements away<br>
	from the negurgitant jet, e.g., to prevent progression of mitral valve disease from causing a<br>
15	substantial gap to eventually form.<br>
		While the coupling of two T-bara 904a with thread 907a has been described, it should be<br>
	understood that the -number of T-bars 904 coatipled by a thread or threads 907 may vary. For<br>
	example, if multiple T-bjtrs 904 are coupled by multiple threads 907, then it may be possible to<br>
	gather more fibrous tissue using fewer total T-bars 904- With reference to Fig- 9b, the use of<br>
20	multiple T-bars 904 which are coupled by multiple threads 907 will be described. T-bars 904c<br>
	are coupled by a thread 90 7c, while T-bars 9O4d are coupled by a thread 907c. Similarly, T-bars<br>
	904e are coupled by a thread 307e. T-bar 904d' is further coupled by a thread 907f to T-bar<br>
	904c”, and T-bars 904d”" to also coupled by a thread 907g to T-bar 904e As will be discussed<br>
	below, threads 907 enable T-bars 904 to be pulled against pledgets 905 and. hence, tissue 940.<br>
25	Such coupling of T-bars 904 enables plications in tissue 940 to be- made between T-bars 904c,<br>
	between T-bars 904d, and between T-bars 904e, while allowing tissue to be at least somewhat<br>
	gathered between T-bar 904c" and T-bar 904d', and between T-bar 904d' and T-bar 904e'.<br>
		In general, the configurations of suture structures -which include T-bars 904 and threads<br>
	907 may vary. One embodiment of a suitable suture-structure is shown in Figs. 10a and 10b.<br>
30	Fig. 10s and 10b are representtions of a suture structure after T- bars have been introducred to an<br>
	atria side of fibrous tissue near a mitra1 valve in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
	invention. For purposed of illustration, it should be understood that the elements and structures<br>
	represented in Figs 10a and 10b, as well as substantially all other figures have not been drawn<br>
	to scale. A suture structure 1000 includes T-bars 904, or reinforcing elements that are coupled<br>
35	to thread 907 such that when thread 907 is pulled. T-bars 904 effectively push against tissue 940,<br>
	As shown in Fig, 10b,. pulling on thread 907 and pushing on a locking element 1002 causes<br>
15<br><br>
	locking eletnenl 1002 to contact a ventricular side of tissue 940 and to effectively hold T-bars<br>
	904 against tissue 940, Specifically, pulling on a loop 1004 of thread 907 while pushing on<br>
	locking element 1002 lightens T-bars 904 against tissue 940 such that a plication 1006 may be<br>
	formed in tissue 940 when locking element 1002 locks into position to lock T-bars 904 into<br>
5	place.<br>
		Pledgets 905. as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, may serve as plication<br>
	anchors for T-bars 904 which essentially function as sutures. That is ptedgets 905 may prevent<br>
	T-bars 904 from cutting through tissue 940. In general, the configuration of pledgets 905 may<br>
	vary widely. For example, pledgets 905 may have a substantially tubular fonn, and may be<br>
10	formed from a material such as surgical, e.g., Bacron, mean. However, it should be appreciated<br>
	that pledgets 905 in may be Formed in substantially any shape and from substantially any material<br>
	which promotes or supports the growth of scar tissue therethrough. Suitable materials include,<br>
	but are not limited to silk and substantially any biocompatible porous or fibrous material.<br>
		Locking element 1002 may be a one-way locking element, e.g,, an element which may<br>
15	 not be easily unlocked once it is locked, that is formed from a biocompatible polymer. The<br>
	configuration of a locking element 1002 may be widely varied. Alternative configurations of<br>
	locking element 1002 will be described below with respect to Fig, II and Figs. 12a-c. In order<br>
	to engage locking element 1002 against pledgets 905. a catheter which is used to deliver T-bars<br>
	904 may be used to push locking element 1002 into a locked position. A catheter which delivers<br>
20	T-bars 904 and may also be used to engage locking element 1002 will be discussed below with<br>
	reference to Figs. 13a-c.<br>
		Like locking element 1002, T-bars 904 may also he formed from a biocomparible<br>
	polymer. Thread 907 which may be coupled to T-bars 904 through tying T-bars 904 to thread<br>
	907 or molding T-bars 904 over thread 907, may be formed from substanially any material<br>
25	which is typically used to form sutures. Suitable materials include, but arc not limited to, silk,<br>
	prolene braided Dscron, and polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE, or GoreTex).<br>
		As mentioned above, the configuration of locking element 1002 may vary. For example,<br>
	a locking element may induces spring element as shown in Fig, 11. A suture structure 1100<br>
	include T-bars 1104, a thread 1107. and a locking element 1102. For ease of illustration, the<br>
30	elements of suture structurs 1100 have not been drawn to scale. Although suture structure 1100<br>
	is not illustrated as including a pledget, it should be appreciated that suture structure 1100 may<br>
	include a pledget or pledgets which serve as reinforcing elements which generally support the<br>
	growth of scar tissue.<br>
		Locking element 1102 includes solid elements 1102a and a spring element 1102b.<br>
35	Although solid elements 1102a may be formed from a biocompatible polymer, solid elements<br>
	1102a may also be formed from material which is typically used to form pledgets. Spring<br>
16<br><br>
	element 1102b is arranged to be held in an extended position, as shown, while a loop 1114 in<br>
	thread 1107 is puffed on. Once T-bars 1104 are in contact with tissue 1140, solid elements<br>
	1102a may come into contact with tissue 1140, and spring element 1102b may contract to create<br>
	a spring force that pulls solid elements 1102a toward each other. In other words, once T-bars<br>
5	1104 are properly positioned against tissue 1140, locking element 1102 may be locked to form a<br>
	plication or local bunching of tissue 1140.<br>
		In one embodiment, the formation of scar tissue on the fibrous tissue which is in<br>
	proximity to a mitra1 valve may be promoted before a plication is formed, or before the fibrous.<br>
	tissue is gathered to compensate for mitra1 valve insufficiency. With reference to Figs. 12a-c, a<br>
10	locking element which promotes the. growth of scar tissue before a plication is fanned will be<br>
	described in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig- 12a, a<br>
	suture structure 1200, which is not drawn to scale, includes a locking element 1204, a thread<br>
	1207, and T-bars 1204. Locking element 1204, which includes solid elements 1202a, a spring<br>
	element 1202b, and a resorbable polymer ovennold 1202c formed over spring element 1202b is<br>
15	coupled to thread 1207 on a ventricular side of tissue 1240.<br>
		Overmold 1202c, which may bo formed from a resorbable lactide polymer such as<br>
	PURASORB. which is available from PURAC America of Lincolnshire, illinois is formed over<br>
	spring elemcnt 1202b -while spring element 1202b is in an extended position. Overmold 1202c<br>
	is arranged to remain intact white scar tissue 1250 forms over solid elements 1202a. In one<br>
20	embodiment, in order to facilitate the formation of star tissue, solid elements 1202a may be<br>
	formed from material that is porous or fibrous e.g., "pledget material."<br>
		Once scar tissue is Formed over solid elements 1202a, overmold 1202c breaks down, e.g.<br>
	degrades to expose spring element 1202b, as shown in Fig- 12b. As will be understood by one<br>
	of skill in the art. the chemical composition of oveimold 1202c may be tuned such that the<br>
25	amount of time that elapses before overmold 1202c breaks down may be controlled, e-g-<br>
	controlled to break down after a desired amount of scar tissue is expected to be formed. Hence,<br>
	once overmold 1202c- breaks down, and spring element 1202b is allowed to contract, as shown<br>
	in Fig. 12c, enough sear tissue 1250 -will generally have formed over solid elements 1202a to<br>
	effectively bond solid elements 1202a against tissue 1240 to allow for the formation of a<br>
30	relatively strong plication or gathering of tissue 1240.<br>
		While a loop 1314 of thread 1207 may be allowed to remain extended into a left ventricle<br>
	of a heart, thread 1207 may be cut, i.e.. loop 1214 may be effectively removed, to reduce the<br>
	amount of loose thread 1207 in the heart. Alternatively, loose thread 1207 may effectively be<br>
	eliminated by gathering thread 1207 around a cylindrical arrangement (not shown) positioned<br>
35	over locking element 1202. That is a spool or similar element may be included as a part of<br>
17<br><br>
	suture strucrure 1200 to enable loose thread 1207 to either be gathered within the spool or<br>
	gathered around the exterior of the spool.<br>
		The use of overmold 1202c enables anchoring forces which hold T-bars 1204 and<br>
	locking element 1202 in position to be relatively low, as substantially no significant forces act<br>
5	on tissue 1240 until after scar tissue or tissue ingrowth is created. Once scar tissue is created,<br>
	and overmold 1202c has degraded, then spring 1202b compresses. The anchoring forces<br>
	generated at this time may be relatively high. However, as scar tissue has been created, the<br>
	likelihood that T-bars 1204 cut into tissue 1240 at this time is generally relatively low<br>
		As mentioned above, catheters may be used to deliver suture structures into a heart, and<br>
10	to engage the suture structures to tissue around the mitra1 valve of the heart. One embodiment of<br>
	a suture structure delivery catheter which is suitable for use in a catheter-based, annuloplasty that<br>
	uses local plications will be described with respect to Fig. 13a. A delivery catheter 1300 may be<br>
	positioned over a guide wire, e.g., guide wire 802 as shown in Fig. 8, which serves as a track to<br>
	enable delivery catheter 1300 to be delivered in the gutter of a heart, It should be appreciated<br>
15	that the elements of delivery catheter 1302 have not been drawn to scale. Within delivery<br>
	catheter 1300 is a wire 1308 which carries T-bars 1304 of a suture structure. In one<br>
	embodiment. T-bars 1300 are coupled to a thread 1307 and a locking element 1300 to form the<br>
	suture structure. Typically, a pointed or sharpened end 1311 of wire 1308 is configured to<br>
	penetrate tissue (not shown), e.g., fibrous tissue of the heart near a mitra1 valve. Once end 1311<br>
20	and T-bar 1304 are located above fibrous tissue, e.g., on an atrial side, of a mitra1 valve, wire<br>
	1308 may be retracted a repositioned. After wire 1308 is repositioned, end 1311 may once agein<br>
	penetrate tissue to effectively deposit T-bar 1304 over tissue on the atrial side of the mitra1<br>
	valve.<br>
		Wire 1308 or, more specifically, end 1311 may be used to pull thread 1307 and to push<br>
25	locking element 1302 into position against tissue near the mitra1 valve. By way of example, end<br>
	1311 may pull an thread 1307 until T-bars 1304 contact the tissue Then, end 1311 may be used<br>
	to lock locking element 1302 against the tissue and, as a result, create a plication in the tissue to<br>
	effectively shrink the annulus of the mitra1 valve.<br>
	In order to create additional plications wire 1308 and in one embodiment, delivery<br>
30	catheter 1300, may be retracted entirely out of a patient to enable additional T-bars to be loaded<br>
	onto wire 1308. Once additional T-bars are positioned on wire 1308 wire 1308 may be<br>
	reinserted into delivery catheter 1300, and delivery catheter 1300 may be used to enable another<br>
	plication to be created in the tissue which is located near the mitra1 valve.<br>
		Fig. 13b is a representation of a second catheter which is suitable for delivering a suture<br>
35	structure in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A catheter 1340, which is<br>
	not drawn to scale and which may include a lumen (not shown) that is arranged to be inserted<br>
18<br><br>
	over a guide wire, includes two wires 1348 which are arranged to cooperate to carry a suture<br>
	structure. As shown, wire. 1348a carries a T-bar 1344a while wire 1348b carries a T-bar 1344b<br>
	which are coupled by a thread 1347 and, together with a locking element 1342, form a suture<br>
	structure. Tips 1351 af wires 1348 pass through tissue near a mitra1 valve to deposit T-bars<br>
5	1344 above the mitra1 valve. Once T-bars 1344 are deposited, tips 1351 may be used to pull T-.<br>
	bars 1344 against the tissue, as well as lo lock looking element 1342 against an opposite side of<br>
	the tissue. By way of example, lip 1351b may be configured to pull on thread 1347 while tip<br>
	1351a pushes against locking element 1342,<br>
	With reference to Fig. 13c,a catheter arrangement which may deploy T-bais from its tip<br>
10	will be described in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A catheter<br>
	arrangement 1360 includes two catheters which each carry a T-bar 1364. it should be<br>
	appreciated that the elements of Fig. 13c have not been drawn to scale fer ease of illustration<br>
	Specifically, catheter 1360a carries T-bar 1364a at its tip, while catheter 1360b carries T-bar<br>
	1364b at its tip. A Lhrcad 1367 couples T-bars 1364 together such that locking element 1362<br>
15	through which thread 1367 passes may lock T-bars 1364 substantially against tissue of a heart.<br>
		In one embodiment, catheter arrangement 1360 may require the use of two guide wires lo<br>
	guide each of catheter 1360a and catheter 1360b into the gutter of the heart. Alternatively,<br>
	catheter 1360a and catheter 1360b may be arranged such that both catheter I 360a and catheter<br>
	1360b may be guided through the gutter of the heart through the use of a single guide wire. <br>
20	Catheter 1360a is configured to push T-bar 1364a through tissue near the mitra1 valve of<br>
	lite heart. and to release T-bar 1364a once T-bar 1364a is located on an atrial side of the mitra1<br>
	valve. Similarly, catheter 1360b is configured to push T-bar 1364b through the tissue, and to<br>
	release T-bar 1164b. T-bars 1364 may be released, for example, when heat is applied to a<br>
	dielectric associated with catheters 1360 that causes T-bars 1364 to be effectively snapped off.<br>
25	Alternatively, a mechanical mechanism (not shown) that engages T-bars 1364 to catheters 1360<br>
	may be disengaged to release T-bars 1354. Once T-bars 1364 arts positioned on the atrial side of<br>
	the mitra1 valve, catheter 1360 may be used to pull on thread 1367 and to push on locking<br>
	element 1362.<br>
		With reference to Figs. 14a and 14b, the performance of an anouloplasty procedure using<br>
30	a catheter-baaed system which implants suture structures in tissue near a mitra1 valve will be<br>
	described in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Once a patient is<br>
	prepared, e.g.. sedated, an annuloplasty procedure 1400 may begin with the insertion of a<br>
	delivery cube and a,1-catheter into the left ventricle of the heart of the patient. The delivery tube<br>
	and the J-catheter may be inserted into the body of the patient through the femoral artery, and<br>
35	threaded through the femoral artery and the aorta into the left ventricle of the heart. Generally<br>
	the J-catheter is positioned within the delivery tube. One embodiment of the delivery tibe and a<br>
19<br><br>
	J-oathetcr were described above with respect to Figs 6a and 6b. As will bs appreciated by those<br>
	skilled in the art the delivery tube and the J-catheter are typically each threaded through the<br>
	aortic valve to reach the 1eft ventricle.<br>
		Once the delivery tube and the J-catheter are positioned within the left ventricle, a gutter<br>
5	catheter may be extended through the J-catheter in step 1408 As was discussed above with<br>
	reference to Figs. 7a-c the gutter catheter is arranged to effectively run against a gutter of the<br>
	wall of the left ventricle substantially immediately under the mitra1 valve. Specifically, the<br>
	gutter catheter may be positioned in the space in the left ventricle between the mitra1 vajve and<br>
	the musculi papillares or papillary muscles The gutter catheter often has a tip that is steerable<br>
10	and flexible. In one embodiment, the tip of the gutter catheter may be coupled to an inflatable<br>
	balloon The J-catheter serves among other purposes the purpose of allowing the gutter<br>
	catheter to be initially oriented in a proper direction such that the gutter catheter may be<br>
	positioned along the wall of the left ventricle.<br>
		In step 1412, a guide wire with an anchoring feature may be delivered through the gutter<br>
15	catheter, e.g., through a lumen or opening in the gutter catheter. The guide wire is delivered<br>
	through the gutter catheter such that it follows the contour of the gutter catheter against the wall<br>
	of the left ventricle. After the guide wire is delivered, the anchoring feature of the guide wire is<br>
	anchored on the wall of the left ventricle in step 1416. Anchoring the guide wire, or otherwise<br>
	implanting the guide wire, on the wall of the left ventricle enables the guide wire to maintain its<br>
20	 position within the left ventricle.<br>
	The J-catheter and the gutter catheter are pulled out of the left ventricle through the<br>
	femoral artery in step 1420, leaving the guide wire anchored within the left ventricle, as was<br>
	discussed above with respect to Fig. 8- A T-bar assembly delivery catheter which carries a T-bar<br>
	assembly is then inserted through the femoral artery into the left ventricle over the guide wire in<br>
25	step 1436. In one embodiment the T-bar assembly delivery catheter carries an uninflated<br>
	balloon.<br>
		After the T-bar assembly delivery catheter is inserted into the left ventricle, the balloon is<br>
	inflated in step 1428. Inflating the balloon, e.g., an elastomeric balloon, at a relatively modest<br>
	pressure using, for example, an air supply coupled to the balloon through the T-bar assembly<br>
30	delivery catheter, serves to enable substantially any catheter which uses ihe guide wire as a track<br>
	to be pressed up against the fibrous tissue around the mitra1 valve Generally the inflated<br>
	balloon substantially occupies the space between the mitra1 valve and the papillary muscles. In<br>
	one embodiment, more than one balloon may be inflated in the left ventricle.<br>
		Once the balloon is inflated in step 1428. The T-bar assembly delivery catheter<br>
35	effectively delivers T-bars or similar mechanisms pledgets and thread which are arranged to<br>
	attach or otherwise couple with an annulus of the mitra1 valve. e.g., the fibrous tissue of the<br>
20<br><br>
	skeleton around the mitra1 valve. to create plications . Suitable catheters were described above<br>
	with respect to Figs. 13a-c. In step 1440, a plication is created using the T-bar assembly in<br>
	substantially any suitable tissue near the mitra1 valve. For example a plication may be created<br>
	by essentially forcing T-bars through the tissue, then locking the T-bars against the tissue using a<br>
5	locking mechanism of the T-bar assembly. Specifically the plication or bunching of tissue may<br>
	be created by extending sharpened wires which carry elements such as T-bars through the tissue,<br>
	then retracting the sharpened wires and pulling the T-bars into place, Positioning the T-bars<br>
	and locking the locking mechanism causes the tissue between the T-bars and the locking<br>
	mechanism may bunch together.<br>
10		Once the plication is created in step 1440, the balloon is generally deflated in step 1442.<br>
	The T-bar assembly delivery cathetere may then be removed through the femoral artery in step<br>
	1444. A determination is made in step 1448 after the T-bar assembly delivery catheter is<br>
	removed as to whether additional plications are to be created. If it is determined that additional<br>
	plications are to be created, then process flow returns to step 1436 in which the T-bar assembly<br>
15	deliver caether. which carries a T-bar assembly or suture, structure, is reinserted rate the<br>
	femoral artery.<br>
		Alternatively, if it is determined in step 1448 that there are no more plications to be<br>
	created, then process flow proceeds to step 1456 in which the guide wire may be removed. After<br>
	the guide wire is removed, the delivery tube may be removed in step 1460, Once the delivery<br>
20	tube is removed, the annuloplasty procedure is completed.<br>
		In lieu of using suture structures such as T-bar assemblies to create local plications other<br>
	elements may also be used to create local plications in fibrous tissue near the mitra1 valve during<br>
	an annuloplasty procedure Fig, 15 is a cut-away top view representation of a left side of a heart<br>
	in which local plications have been created using individual discrete elements in accordance<br>
25	with an embodiment of the present invention Local plication elements 1522 are effectively<br>
	implanted in fibrous tissue 1540 around portions of a mitra1 valve 15116 in order to reduce the<br>
	size of a gap 1508 between an anterior leaflet 1520 and a posterior leaflet 1518 e.g., to reduce<br>
	the arc length associated with posterior leaflet 1518. Local plication elements 1522 are arranged<br>
	to gather sections of tissue 1540 to create local plications. The local plications created by local<br>
	30 plication elements 1522, which are generally mechanical elements reduce ihe size of the mitra1<br>
	valve annul us and. hence, reduce the size of gap 1508. As will be understood by those skilled in<br>
	the art, over time scar tissue may grow around or over local plication elements 1522,<br>
		The configuration of local plication elements 1522 may be widely varied. For example,<br>
	local plication elements 1522 may be metallic elements which have spring-like characteristics<br>
35	or deformable metallic elements which have shape memory characteristics. Alternatively, each<br>
	local plication element 1522 may be formed from sepaiate pieces which may be physically<br>
21<br><br>
	locked together to form a plication. With reference to Figs. 16a-d, one embodiment of a local<br>
	plication element which has spring-like characteristics will be described in accordance with an<br>
	embodiment of the present invention. A local plication element 1622 may be delivered to a<br>
	ventricular side, or bottom side of tissue 1640 which is located near a mitra1 valve. When<br>
5	delivered, as for example- through a catheter, dement 1622 is in a substantially folded, closed<br>
	orientation, as shown in Fig. 16a. In other words dement 1622 is in a closed configuration that<br>
	facilitates the delivery of element 1622 through a catheter. After an initial compressive force is<br>
	applied at comers 1607 of element 1622, sides or tines 1609 of element 1622 may unfold or<br>
	open. As tines 1609 open, tips 1606 of tines 1609 may be pressed against tissue 1640, as shown<br>
10	in Fig. 16b. The application of compressive force to tines 1609, as well as a pushing force to a<br>
	bottom 1611 of element 1622, allows tips 1606 and, hence, tines 1609 to grab tissue 1640 as tips<br>
	1606 push through tissue 1640, as shown in Fig. 16c. The closing of tines 1609, due to<br>
	compressive forces applied to tines 1609, causes tissue 1040 to he gathered between lines 1609<br>
	and, as a result causes a plication 1630 to be formed, as shown in Fig. 16d, In one embodiment,<br>
15	the catheter (not shown) that delivers element 1622 may be used to apply forces to element<br>
	1622.<br>
		As mentioned above, elements used to create local plications may be created from shape<br>
	memory materials. The use of a shape memory material to create a plication element allows the<br>
	plication element to be self-locking. Fig. 17a is a representation of one plication element which<br>
20	is formed from a shape memory material in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
	invention. A clip 1704 which may be fanned from a shape memory material, i.e., an alloy of<br>
	nickel and titanium, is arranged to be in an expanded state or open state when it is introduced,<br>
	e.g., by a catheter into the gutter of the left ventricle. Typically, holding clip 1704 in an<br>
	expanded state involves applying force to clip 1704, In one embodiment, a catheter may hold<br>
25	sides 1708 of clip 1704 to maintain clip 1704 in an expanded state.<br>
		Once tips 1706 of clip 1704 are pushed through the fibrous lissue near the mitra1 valve of<br>
	the heart such that tips 1706 are positioned on an a trial side of the mitra1 valve, force may be<br>
	removed from clip 1704. Since clip 1704 is formed from a shape memory material, once force is<br>
	removed, clip 1704 forms itself into its "rest" state of shape, as shovvn in Fig. I7b, In its rest<br>
30	state or preferred state, clip 1704 is arranged to gather tissue in an opening 1712 defined by clip<br>
	1704. That is the default state of clip 1704 is a closed configuration which is effective to bunch<br>
	tissue to create a local plication<br>
		Another discrete self-locking plication element which is suitable for creating a local<br>
	plication is a clip which may twist from an open position to a closed, or engaged position, once<br>
35	force applied to hold the clip in an open position is removed. Fig. 18a is a representation of<br>
	another self-locking plication element shown in a closed position in accordance with an<br>
22<br><br>
	embodiment of the present invention. A clip element 1800, which may be formed from a<br>
	material such as stainless steel or a shape memory material, is preloaded such that once tissue<br>
	1830 is positioned in a gap 1810 between a tine 1806 and a time 1808, clip element 1800 may<br>
	return to a state which causes tissue 1830 to be pinched within a gap or space 1810. <br>
5		Tine 1806 and tine 1808 first pierce tissue 1830, e.g., the tissue of in annulus of a mitra1<br>
	valve. As tine 1806 and tine 1808 are drawn together to create a plication, thereby reducing the<br>
	size of gap 1810 by reducing a distance 1820, a bottom portion 1812 of clip element 1800 twists<br>
	as for example in a quarter turn effectively by virtue of shape memory characteristics of clip<br>
	element 1800, Thus an effective lock that holds tine 0806 and tine 1808 in a closed position<br>
10	such that tissue 1830 is gathered to form a local plication results.<br>
		In lieu of a preloaded clip element, a clip element may include a lock mechanism which<br>
	engages when force is applied. Fig. 18a is a representation of a self-locking plication element<br>
	which includes a sliding Jock in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A clip<br>
	element 1850 includes a body 1852 and a slider 1862 which is arranged to slide over at least a<br>
	15 portion of body 1852. Clip element 1850, which may be formed from a material such as<br>
	stainless steel or a shape memory alloy, includes a tip 1856 and a tip 1858 which are<br>
	substantially separated by a gap 1856 when slider 1862 is in an unlocked position. As shown,<br>
	slider 1862 is in an unlocked or open position when slider 1862 is positioned about a tapered<br>
	neck 1854 of body 1852.<br>
20		When clip element 1850 is delivered into a left ventricle, e.g., using a catheter, clip<br>
	element 1850 is positioned within the left ventricle such thai tip 1856 and tip 1858 are<br>
	effectively pierced through fibrous tissue 1880 near the mitra1 valve. After tip 1856 and tip 1858<br>
	are positioned substantially on an atrial side of tissue 1880, force may be applied to slider 1862<br>
	to move slider 1862 in a y-direction 1870b over body 1852 As slider moves in y-direction<br>
25	1870b away from tapered neck 1854, slider 1862 forces dp 1856 and lip 1858 together close gap<br>
	1860, i.e., tip 1856 and tip 1858 move towards each other in an x-direction 1870a. When tip<br>
	1856 and tip 1858 cooperate to close gap 1860, tissue 1880 is gathered within dip element 1850,<br>
	thereby creating a local plication.<br>
		In ono embodiment, when slider 1862 is in a closed position such that tip 1856 and tip<br>
30	1858 cooperate to close gap 1856, slider 1862 may contact tissue 1880. Hence, in order to<br>
	promote the growth of scar tissue over parts of clip element 1850 or, inoie specifically, slider<br>
	1862, at leasts top surface of slider 1862 tnay be covered with a pledget material, e.g..a mesh<br>
	which supports the growth of scar tissue therethrough.<br>
		Locking elements which create local plications may include elements which have two or<br>
	35 more substantially separate pieces which lock together around tissue. An example of a locking<br>
	element which includes two separate pieces is shown in Fig. 19, As shown in Fig, 19, a locking<br>
23<br><br>
	element 2000 may include a receiver piece 2002 and a locker piece 2004, which may generally<br>
	be formed from substantially any suitable material, as for example a biocompatible plastic<br>
	material. Receiver piece 2002 and locker piece 2004 each include a tine 2006- Tines 2006 are<br>
	arranged to pierce and to engage tissue to create a local plication.<br>
5		A cable tie portion 2010 of looker piece 2004 is configured to be drawn through an<br>
	opening 2008 which -engages cable tie portion 2010, opening, 2008 includes features (not.<br>
	shown) which allow cable tie portion 2010 lo be pulled through opening 2008 and locked into<br>
	position, and which prevent cable tie portion 2010 substantially from being pushed out of<br>
	opening 2008- Cable tie portion 2010 is locked in opening 2008 when bevels 2012 come into<br>
10	contact and effectively force tines 2006 to clamp down. Once tines 2006 clamp down, and<br>
	locker piece 2004 is locked against receiver piece 2002, a local plication is formed<br>
		The operation of locking element 2000 will be descrived with respect to Figs. 20a-d in<br>
	accordance with an embodiment of the present invenrton. As shown in Fig. 20a, receiver piece<br>
	2002 and locker piece 2004 may be delivered substantially beneath fibrous tissue 2050 near a<br>
	15 mitra1 valve (not shown). Receiver piece 2002 and locker piece 2004 may be delivered using a<br>
	catheter which includes a top surface 2054. Top surface 2054 of the catheter is arranged to<br>
	apply force to lines 2006 such that tines 2006 remain in an effectively undeployed, e.g., partially<br>
	bent or folded, position while being delivered by ths Catheter.<br>
		Once receiver piece 2002 and lacker piece 2004 are positioned under tissue 2050 near a<br>
20	location where a plication is to be formed, forces are applied to receiver piece 2002 and locker<br>
	piece 2004 lo push receiver piece 2002 and locker piece 2004 together and effectively through<br>
	an opening 2058 in top surface 2054 of the catheter, as shown in Fig. 20b. The forces are<br>
	typically applied by mechanisms (not shown) associated with the catheter. As tines 2006 pass<br>
	through ope 2058. tinss 2006 "open," or deploy in order to pierce tissue 2050. <br>
25		After piercing tissue 2050, tines 2006 continue to penetrate and to gather tissue 2050<br>
	while receiver piece 2002 and locker piece 2004 are pushed together. As receiver piece 2002<br>
	and locker piece 2004 are pushed together, cable tie portion 2010 is inserted into opening 2008<br>
	(shown in Fig. 19) of receiver portion 2002, as shown in Fig. 20c Cable tie portion 2010<br>
	eventually locks with respect to opening 2003 when bevel a 2012 come into contact. When<br>
30	bevels 2012 come into contact, lines, 2006 close inwards causing tissue 2050 to be -captured, i. e.,<br>
	causing a local plication 2060 to be formed. Once a local plication is formed, and force is no<br>
	longer required to push recei ver piece 2002 and locker piece 2004 together, the catheier which<br>
	delivered receiver piece 2002 and locker piece 2004 may he removed from the left ventricle. <br>
		Referring next to Figs. 2la and 21h, an annuloplasty procedure which uses a catheter<br>
35	based system to create local plications in tissue near a mitra1 valve using discrete elements will<br>
	be described in accordance, witt an. embodiment of the. present invention. After a patient is<br>
24<br><br>
	prepared, an annulaplasty procedure 2100 may begin with the insertign of a delivery tube and a<br>
	J-catheter into the left ventricle of the heart of the patient in step 2104, Once the delivery tube<br>
	and the J-catheeer are positioned within the left ventricle, a gutter catheter may be extended<br>
	through the J-catheter in step 2108. The gutter catheter, as described above, is arranged to<br>
5	effectively run against a gutter of the wall of the left ventricle, e.g., between the mitra1 valve and<br>
	the papillary muscles. The gutter catheter often has it tip that is steerable and flexible.<br>
		In step 2112, a guide wine with an anchoring feature may be delivered through the gutter<br>
	catheter. e.g. through a lumen or opening in the gutter catheter. The guide wire is delivered<br>
	through the gutter catheter such that it follows the contour of the gutter catheter against the wall<br>
10	of the left ventricle. After the guide wire is delivered the anchoring feature of the guide wire is<br>
	anchored on the wall of the left ventricle in step 2116.<br>
		The J-catheter and the gutter catheter are pulled out of the left ventricle through the<br>
	femoral artery in step 2120, leaving the guide wire anchored within the left ventricle, as was<br>
	discussed above with respect to Fig. 8. A plication element delivery catheter which carries a<br>
15	plication element and. in one embodiment, is arranged to engage the plication element to the<br>
	fibrous tissue arpund the mitra1 valve is inserted through the femoral artery into the left ventricle<br>
	over the guide wire in step 2132. The piication element delivery catheter, in the described<br>
	embodiment, is coupled to an uninflated balloon which is inflated in step 2134 to effectively<br>
	allow the plication element delivery catheter to be positioned substantially directly under the<br>
20	 fibrous tissue. Once the plication element delivery catheter is positioned in the left ventricle<br>
	e.g., over the guide wire in the gutter of the left ventricle, and the balloon is inflated, the<br>
	plication element delivered by the delivery catheter is engaged to the fibrous tissue in step 2136.<br>
	That is the plication element is coupled to the fibrous tissue such that a local plication is formed<br>
	in the fibrous tissue.<br>
25		After the local plication is created in step 2136 by engaging tissue using the plication<br>
	element, the balloon is deflated in step 2138. Upon deflating the balloon the plication element<br>
	delivery catheter may be removed through the femoral artery in styp 2140. A determination is<br>
	then made in step 2142 as to whether additional local plications are to be created. That is it is<br>
	determined if other plication elements are to be introduced into the left ventricle. if it is<br>
30	determined that additional local plications are to be created, process flow returns to step 2132 in<br>
	which the plication element delivery catheter, which earnest another plication element, is<br>
	reinserted into the femoral artery.<br>
		Alternatively, if it is determined in step 2142 that there are no more local plication to be<br>
	created, then the indication is that a sufficient number of local plications have already been<br>
35	created. Accordingly, the guide wire may be removed in step 2148. and the delivery tube may<br>
25<br><br>
	be removed in step 2152, After the delivery tube is removed, the annuloplasty procedure is<br>
	completed.<br>
		A catheter which may enable an orthogonal access to a mitra1 valve may enable the<br>
	catheter to be more accurately positioned underneath the mitra1 valve. As discussed above, a<br>
5	catheter may become at least partially tangled in trabeculae which are located in the left ventricle<br>
	of a heart. As such, inserting a catheter which does not extend too deeply into the left ventricle<br>
	may prevent significant tangling. Any tangling may impede the efficiency with which the<br>
	catheter may be positioned beneath a mitra1 valve. One catheter which may be less likely to<br>
	become at least partially tangled in trabeculae, while also enabling an orthogonal access to a<br>
10	mitra1 valve, is an L-shaped catheter, which is shown in Fig. 22a. An L-shaped catheter<br>
	arrangement 2200, which includes a deliver tube 2201 and an L-shaped catheter 2202 which<br>
	may be formed from a-biocompatible material that is typically also relatively flexible, is<br>
	arranged to allow the tip of L-eatheter 2202 to maintain an "I." shape when passed through an<br>
	aortic valve 2205 into a left ventricle 2204, After delivery tube 2201 and L-shaped catheter<br>
15	2202 are effectively "snaked' or inserted through a. femoral artery, a. tip 2208 of L-shaped<br>
	catheter may be positioned at a top portion of left ventricle 2204, where there is typically a<br>
	minimal amount of trabeculae.<br>
	Tip 2208 of L-shaped catheter 2202 may be extended in a straight orientation sueh that<br>
	lip 2208 effectively forms an "L" with respect to delivery tube 2201 and the remainder of L-<br>
20	shaped catheter 2202. in one embodiment, as tip 2208 is extended under a mitra1 valve 2212 a<br>
	siring 2210 or another part, e.g., a wire, that may he coupled to tip 2208 may extend through an<br>
	opening in delivery tube 2201 as shown in Fig. 22b. String 2210 may effectively allow tip 2208<br>
	to be bent or otherwise moved around underneath to position tip 2208 into contact with mitra1<br>
	valve 2212, as shown in Fig. 22c.<br>
25		The use of string 2210 to pull on lip 2208 allows in cooperation with extending L-<br>
	shaped catheter 2202, tip 2208 to be moved beneath mitra1 valve 2212 into desired positions.<br>
	Hence, desired locations beneath mitra1 valve 2212 may relatively easily be reached to enable<br>
	plications (not shown) to be created in the desired locations. In the described embodiment,<br>
	string 2210 may enable a curve to be created in L-shaped catheter 2202 that is substantially an<br>
30	approximately ninety degree curve.<br>
		L-shaped catheter 2202 may be used to create plications in mitra1 valve 2212 using a<br>
	variety of different methods. Specifically, tip 2208 of L-shaped catheter 2202 may be<br>
	temporarily fixed in a poftilion beneath mitra1 valve 2212, e.g., tn a gutter of the heart, during a<br>
	process of creating a plication in mitra1 valve 2212. In. one embodiment, suction may be used to<br>
35	gather a portion of tissue near mitra1 valve 2212 either such that a plication may be made in the<br>
	portion, or such that a temporary anchor point may be created. Suction generally enables tissue<br>
26<br><br>
	to Be substantially gathered such that an apparatus as for example a clip or a similar apparatus<br>
	may be put Into place to hold the gathered tissue. Alternatively, swction may be used to secure<br>
	or firmly anchor tip 2208 against mitra1 valve 2212 such that an anchor for a plication may be<br>
	deployed with improved accuracy. When tip 2208 is anchored into tissue near mitra1 valve<br>
5	2212, an anchor for a plication or a temporary anchor may be more precisely placed, as the<br>
	position of tip 2208 is effectively fixed.<br>
		Figs. 23a and 23b are diagrammatic representations of orientations of a tip area of an L-<br>
	shaped catheter which may be used with suction to anchor the tip area to a mitra1 valve in<br>
	accordance with an embodiment of the present invetior. As shown in Fig. 23a, a tip 23O8 of a<br>
10	catheter such as an L-shaped catheter, e.g., L-shaped catheter 2202 of Fig. 22c, may include an<br>
	opening 2314 on a side of tip 2308. Opening 2314 may he positioned under tissue 2312 such<br>
	that when suction is applied through opening 2314, tip 2308 is effectively temporarily fixed<br>
	against tissue 2312. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 23b, a tip 2318 of an L-shaped catheter may<br>
	include an end opening 2324, i.e., an opening at an endpoint of tip 2318 that allows opening<br>
15	2324 to contact tissue 2322 such that when suction is applied through opening 2324, tip 2312 is<br>
	held relatively firmly against tissue 2322. Temporarily anchoring a catheter near a mitra1 valve<br>
	generally allows plication elements to be more accurateiy deployed using the catheter.<br>
		In lieu of using suction to anchor the tip area of a catheter to tissue near a mitra1 valve, a<br>
	wire with a toil which may be extended through a catheter such that the wire may be temporarily<br>
20	anchored into tissue near the mitra1 valve such that other catheters may irack over the wire. For<br>
	example, a wire with a helical coil or a spiral at the tip may be engaged against tissue by<br>
	applying Force to the tip of the wire, turning the wire such that the helical coil portion of the wire<br>
	turns through the tissue, the pushing the coil through the tissue. Figs. 24a and 24b are<br>
	diagrammatic representations of a wire with a helical coil which may be suitable for use in as a<br>
25	temporary anchor that is anchored into tissue near a mitra1 valve in accordance with an<br>
	embodiment of the present invention. A wire 2430 with a coiled tip 2432. as shown in Pig. 24a,<br>
	may be cxtended through a catheter (not shown) white a tip of the catheter may, in one<br>
	embodiment, effectively be anchored against tissue near a mitra1 valve. Wire 2430 may be<br>
	inserted in a catheter (not shown) such that a longitudinal axis of wire 2430 is parallel to a<br>
30	longitudinal axis of a tip (not shown) of the catheter. As shown in Fig. 24b, coiled tip 2432 may<br>
	extend through a lumen of a tip 2440 of an L-shaped catheter to enable tip 2440 to be<br>
	substantially anchored when coiled tip 2432 is anchored against tissue. Coiled tip 2432 is<br>
	incorporated in the tip of the catheter, and would be engaged by rotating the entire catheter. This<br>
	design features a working human that is coaxial with the center of the helical tip to enable a T-bars<br>
35	that is pushed down the lumen to pass through the center of the helix as the T-bar is effectively<br>
27<br><br>
	forced Foiled through tissue. It should be appreciated that, in one embodiment, a coiled tip may be<br>
	included as a part of an L-shaped catheter, i. g., the catheter may include a coiled tip<br>
		A wire 2430 with a coiled tip 2432 may generally be used as a temporary anchor which<br>
	may remain coupled to tissue sven after a catheter through which wire 2430 was deployed is<br>
5	retracted- That is. wire 2430 may serve as a track over which other catheters may be "run" to<br>
	enable a particular position, i.e., a position identified by the location of coiled tip 2432 with<br>
	respect to the tissue, to be repeatedly accessed or located by catheters.<br>
		In general, temporary fixation is a relatively reversible process. By effectively<br>
	lemporarily fixing or anchoring a catheter or a coiled tip of a wire against mitra1 valve tissue or<br>
10	tissue near a mitra1 valve, it is relatively easy to position, release, and re-position the wire and,<br>
	hence, a catheter that traces over the wire substantially without trauma, and substantially without<br>
	causing an irreversible action to occur. A temporary anchor may provide a tension or counter-<br>
	traction force for the application of a permanent anchor. That is counter-traction on the<br>
	temporary anchor may be used to provide a tissue penetration force for the permanent anchor.<br>
15	Possible permanent anchors generally include both single anchor points e.g., applying one T-bar<br>
	with a second T-bar being needed to for a plications and dual anchor points e.g., applying a clip<br>
	or a. staple which creates a plication between its points.<br>
		Once a catheter is effectively anchored into position, as for example over a wire such as<br>
	wire 2430 then anchors which are used to create plications may be deployed. Typically, two<br>
20	anchor points are used to form a single plication. Fig. 25 is a diagrammatic representation of an<br>
	anchor which is deployed and anchored into tissue in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
	present invention. An anchor 2504, "which is toupled to a tethra or a tail 2500, is deplyed<br>
	through tissue 2508 such that anchor 2504 is pushed through tissue 2508 while tail 2500 is<br>
	allowed to extend, e.g., to an exterior of the body of a patient. In one embodiment, anchor 2504<br>
25	may be a temporary anchor which is not actually used in the creation of a plication but is<br>
	instead, used to allow anchors used for plications to be positioned In such an embodiment,<br>
	anchor 2504 may be used to enable a first permanent anchor to be anchored. Alternatively,<br>
	anchor 2504 may be an anchor, e.g., a T-bar, which is intended to be used to create a plication.<br>
	for ease of discussion, anchor 2504 is described as being a first permanent anchor that was<br>
30	previously anchored into position by guiding a catheter over a temporary anchor (not shown).<br>
		An incrementor catheter may use tail 2500 as a guide over which the incrementor<br>
	catheter may be positioned. Art incrementor catheter, as shown in Fig. 26a, may generally<br>
	include two sections. A first section 2602 of art incrementor catheter 2600, may be inserted over<br>
	tail 2500. In one- embodimenl, first section 2602 may be used to insert anchor 2504, e.g.._ when<br>
35	incrementor catheter 2600 is configured as an L-shaped catheter.<br>
28<br><br>
		Once first section 2602 is positioned over tail 2500 such that first section 2602 is in<br>
	relatively close proximity to tissue 2508 a second section 2604 may be extended away from First<br>
	section 2602, as for example by a nominal separation or distance 'd' as shown in Fig. 26 b The<br>
	positioning of first section 2602 over tail 2500 enables first section 2602 to be temporarily fixed.<br>
5	With first section 2602 being temporarily fixed, second section 2604 may be controlled such that<br>
	a lip of second section 2604 may be rotated, extended, or retraced to control the penetration<br>
	angle of an anchor (not shown) that is to be deployed.<br>
		Additionally, when first section 2602 is temporarily fixed, the position, of first section<br>
	2602 may be maintained for enough time to pet form substantially all desired tests and to<br>
10	withstand forces associated with the desired test. Further, substantially all forces associated with<br>
	the manipulation of incrementor catheter 2602.<br>
		Distance 'd' may be substantially any distanct. and is typically selected to be a distance<br>
	which allows a plication created using anchor 2504 and an anchor (not shown) that is to be<br>
	deployed through second section 2604 to be effectively created. When second section 2604 is<br>
15	used to deploy either a temporary or permanent anphor (not shown), second section 2604 is<br>
	effectively a working lumen of incrementor catheter 2600.<br>
		The location of anchors may generally be verified using a number of technologies which<br>
	include, but are not limited to ultrasound techniques fluoroscopy techniques and electrical<br>
	signals. With some of the technologies the injection of marking agents e.g.t contrast agents for<br>
20	fluoroscopy or thicrospheres for ultrasound, may increase contrast and promote visibility.<br>
	Typically, Such injections may be into a ventricular space, within mitra1 valve tissue, or in<br>
	through the mitra1 valve tissue into atrial space. It should be appreciated that the verification of<br>
	locations may further enable a distance 'd' between consecutive anchors to be more accurately<br>
	maintained,<br>
25		Fig. 27 is a diagrammatic representation of two anchors which may be used to create a<br>
	plication in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Anchor 2504 and an<br>
	anchor 2704, which may be deployed using second section 2004 of incrementor catheter 2600 of<br>
	Fig. 26b, are separated by distance 'd.' Each anchor 2504, 2704 has a tail section, i.g.. tail 2500<br>
	and a tail 2700, respectively. which, after incrementor catheter 1600 of Fig. 26b is withdrawn<br>
30	from underneath tissue 2508, may be pulled on or tensioned such that a plication is effectively<br>
	created between anchor 2504 and anchor 2704. Once a plication is created, tails 2500, 2700 may<br>
	be trimmed.<br>
		In general, a daisy chain of plications maybe created using an incrementor catheter<br>
	That is the incrementor catheter may be used to anchor a series of anchors which are each<br>
35	substantially separated by a distance 'd. Once a daisy chain of anchors is in place in mitra1<br>
	valve tissue, pairs of the anchors may effectively be tied off to create a series or a daisy chain of<br>
29<br><br>
	plications. With reference to Fig. 28a-f, a process of creating a daisy chain of plications will be<br>
	described in accordance -with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in. Fig- 28a, a.<br>
	first anchor 2802a, which may be a T-bar, has a tail 2806a such as a suture and is anchored to<br>
	tissue 2804, Typically, tissue 2804 is tissue of a mitraJ valve annulua or tissue near a mitra1<br>
5	valve. A second anchor 2802b, which has a tail 2806b is also anchored into tissue 2804.<br>
	Typically, the distance between second anchor 2802b and first anchor 28O2a is a measured<br>
	distance, i.e. the distance between second anchor 2802b and first anchor 2802a is<br>
	predetermined. In one embodiment, the distance is substantially controlled using an intrementor<br>
	cathstsr. <br>
10		Once first anchor 2802a and second anchor 2802b are in place, a locker 2810a is<br>
	delivered over tails 2806a, 2806b, as shown in Fig, 28b, Once locker 2810a is delivered tail<br>
	2806a may be tensioned, substantially locked, and trimmed. Tensioning of tail 2806b, as shown<br>
	in Fig. 28c, allows a first plicalion 2820 to be effectively created. Tail 2806b remains<br>
	untritnmed, us second anchor 2802b is arranged to be included in a second plication of a daisy<br>
15	chain of plications. That is second anchor 2802b may effectively be shared by more than one<br>
	plication. A third anchor 2802c which has a tail 2806c, as shown in Fig. 28d, is anchored into<br>
	tissue 2804 at a specified distance from second anchor 2802b, e.g., through the use of an<br>
	incrementor catheter.<br>
		A locker 2810b may be delivered over tail 2806b and tail 2806c, and tail 2806b may be<br>
20	tensioned. lockedr and trimmed as shown in Fig. 28e. When lail 2806c is tensioned, a second<br>
	plication 2830 is created, as shown in Fig, 28f. it should be appreciated that if tait 2806 is also<br>
	locked and trimmed, then a daisy chain of two plications2820. 2830 is completed.<br>
	Alternatively, if imore plications are to be added, then additional anchors and lockers may be<br>
	positioned as appropriate such that tail 2806c serves as a "starting point" for the additional<br>
25	plications.<br>
		Instead of using an L-shaped catheter to create anchor points substantially any other<br>
	suitable catheter may be used to access tissise near a mitra1 valve or a mitra1 valve annulus e.g.,,<br>
	to achieve a substantially orthogonal access to mitra1 valve tissue. In one embodiment, a<br>
	suitable catheter may be a hook catheter which effectively includes an approximately 180 degree<br>
30	curve may be used to create anchor points and plications. Fig. 29a is a diagrammatic<br>
	representation of a hook .catheter in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
	hook catheter 2900, which includes a tip 2902 that is effectively a tenninus of a curved portion<br>
	2903 of hook catheter 2900. is inserted through an aortic valve 2904 into a left ventricle 2906.<br>
		Once, hook catheter 2900 is positioned or, more sptcifically, once tip 2902 Is positioned<br>
35	near mitra1 valve tissue 2908, a string 2910 which may be coupled 10 tip 2902 as shown in Fig.<br>
	29b may be pulled on or tensionsd and slackened, as appropriate, to enable tip 2902 to be<br>
30<br><br>
	positioned in a desired location with respect to mitra1 valve tissue 2908. As will be appreciated<br>
	by those skilled in the art, string 2910 is often a wire such as a pull wire or a deflection wire that<br>
	is axilly translatable. By allowing string 2910 to enable tip 902 to be positioned in a desired<br>
	location, look catheter 2900 may effectively be considered to be a deflectable or steerable lip<br>
5	catheter. A temporary anchor, e.g., a helical coil such as helical coil 2432 of Fig. 24a, may be<br>
	anchored to mitra1 valve tissue 2908 by deploying the temporary anchor through hook catheter<br>
	2900. Fig. 29c is a diagrammatic representation of a temporary anchor that is positioned within<br>
	a heart in accordance -with an embodiment of the present invention. An anchoring coil 2920,<br>
	which is coupled to a wire 2922. may be anchored to mitra1 valve tissue 2908 such that wire<br>
10	2922 may serve as a guide over which a catheter, as for example either a catheter such as a book<br>
	catheter which delivers a permanent anchor Gran tncrementor catheter, which may also deliver a<br>
	permanent anchor, may be positioned.<br>
		In lieu of using hook catheter 2900 to deploy a temporary anchor, catheter 2900 may<br>
	instead be used to deploy a more permanent anchor such as a T-bar. As shown in Fig. 29d, a T-<br>
15	bar 2940 may be pushed through mitra1 valve tissue 2908 using tip 2902 of hook catheter 2900,<br>
	When hook catheter 2900 is withdrawn from left ventricle 2906. T-bar 2940 effectively remains<br>
	anchored in mitra1 valve tissue 2908, while a tail 2942 of T-bar 2940 may extend to an exterior<br>
	of the body of a patient, as shown in Fig. 29e.<br>
		After T-bar 2940 or, more generally, an anchor is in position, then an incremental<br>
20	catheter may be snaked or otherwise passed over tail 2942. Fig. 29f is a diagrammatic<br>
	representation of an incrementor catheter that is positioned over tail 2942 in accordance with an<br>
	embodiment of the present invention. An increnientor catheter 2930 is positioned such that a<br>
	first section 2952 of incrernentor catheter 2950 may be guided by tail 2942 until a tip of first<br>
	section 2952 is substantially directly under T-bar 2940. Then, a second section 2954 of<br>
25	incremenlor catheter 2950 may be extended until a tip of second section 2954 is positioned<br>
	approximately a distance 'd' away from T-bar 2940. A second T-bar (not shown) or anchor may<br>
	then be deployed using second section 2954. Once a second T-bar is deployed, incremenlot<br>
	catheter 2950 may be removed from left ventricle 2906<br>
		The use of an incrementor catheter 2950 allows two T-bare, e.g., T-bar 2940 and T-har<br>
30	2980 of Fig. 29g, to be anchored to mitra1 valve tissue 2908 such thai T-bars 2940, 2980 may be<br>
	spaced apart at approximately a distance 'd' while tails 2942, 2982, respectively, may extend<br>
	outside of a body of a patient. In other words. incrementor catheter 2950 generally enables the<br>
	distance between adjacent T-bars to be more carefully controlled.<br>
		In order to create a plication using T-bars 2940, 2980, a locking bar 2990, as shown in<br>
35	Fig, 29h, may be provided over tails 2942,2982 such that mitra1 valve tissue 2908 may<br>
31<br><br>
	effectivefy be pinched between T-bars 2940, 2980 and Jacking bar 2990. Once a plication is<br>
	created, tails 2942. 2982 may be trimmed or otherwise cut.<br>
		With reference to Fig. 30, the steps associated with one method of creating a plication<br>
	using an access catheter which has a 180 degree retrograde active-curve tip, e.g., a hook catheter,<br>
5	an incrementor catheter, and a helical coil for creating a temporary anchor will be described in<br>
	accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A process 3000 begins at step 3020 in<br>
	which a catheter, e.g,, a hook catheter is inserted in a substantially straight configuration<br>
	through an introducer into a femoral artery of a patienl. Ones the catheter is inserted, the tip of<br>
	the catheter is prolapsed into a hook shape in step 3040. A gap between an end of the hook<br>
10	portion and the main portion of the catheter may be reduced to a dimension that is small enough<br>
	to prevent langing of the tip in chords or leaflets of the heart. Prolapsing of the tip may<br>
	generally occur within tht aorta of a heart, at a femoral artery bifurcation, or within the left<br>
	ventricle of the heart. It should be appreciated that when the tip of the catheter is defleclable, the<br>
	tip of the catheter mav he deflected or substantially actively changed into a hook shape within<br>
15	the aorta of the heart, or within the left ventricle of the heart.<br>
		In step 3060, the tip of the catheter may be positioned within the left ventricle. By way<br>
	of example, the catheter tip may be positioned at a level that is just inferior to the level of the<br>
	mitra1 valve annulus and the catheter stgment that includes the hook shape may be rotated such<br>
	that it lies against either the antetior or-posterior aspect of the aortic outflow tract, depending<br>
20	upon which aspect is to be treated- In one embodiment, the distal catheter segment is aligned<br>
	such that when extended, the tip of the catheter may point towards one of the entrances to the<br>
	gutter of the heart. The entrances to the gutter of the heart may include substantially any<br>
	relatively clear entrance to the gutter with respect to the leaflets of the heart, as far example a<br>
	medial pl location. a mid P2 location, or lareral P3 location,<br>
25	After the tip of the catheter is positioned, the tip of the catheter may be hooked into the<br>
	gutter in step 3080. Hooking the catheter lip into the gutter may include repeatedly extending<br>
	the retrograde tip to increase the gap between the tip and the proximal segment of the catheter,<br>
	retracting the entire catheter and sensing engagement of the tip with the gutter, and, if necessary,<br>
	one again positioning the tip of the catheter in the left ventriple before rehooking the Jip.<br>
30		Once the catheter tip is hooked into the gutter, the location of the tip is confirmed in step<br>
	3100. confirming the location of the tip may include, but is not limited to, as previously<br>
	mentioned, sensing electrical signals of the heart, fluoroscopy with or without the injection of<br>
	contrast and ultrasound with or without the injection of microspheres. When the tip location is<br>
	confirmed, a Temporary anchor may be attached in slep 3120. The temporary anchor may be a<br>
35	helical coil, eg, helical coil 2432 of Fig. 24a that is attached by applying a. longitudinal<br>
32<br><br>
	pressure and torque. Typically, when the helical coil is attached, a lumen or a tail of the helical<br>
	coil remains connected to the helical coil.<br>
		In the described embodiment, after the temporary anchor is attached, the location of the<br>
	temporary anchor is confirmed in step 3140. Methods used to confirm the location of the<br>
5	temporaiy anchor may be the same as methods used to confirm the location of a catheter tip, and<br>
	may also include injecting contrast or rnicrospheres into tissue or through tissue to the atrial<br>
	space above a mitra1 valve.<br>
	A permanent anchor is attached in step 3160 using the connection to the temporary<br>
	anchor as a guide. The permanent anchor may be attached to the same location, and may<br>
10	provide a counter-traction force for tissue engagement. Like the temporary anchor, the<br>
	permanent anchor generally includes a tail.<br>
		Once a permnent anchor is in place an incremental catheter is delivered into thu heart<br>
	in step 3180. In- general, the incrernentor catheter is delivered in a closed configuration to the<br>
	location of the first anchor, e.g., the permanent anchor attached in. step 3160, by tracking a first<br>
15	section of the incrementor catheter over the tail of the first anchor. Aftet the incrementor<br>
	catheter is delivered, the incrernentor catheter may be deployed in step 3200 to create a nominal<br>
	distance or gap between the first anchor location and the working lumen. e.g.,a second section,<br>
	of the incrementod catheter. Then, in step 3220, a second permanent anchor may be applied at<br>
	the nominal distance from the first permanent anchor, it should be appreciated that temporary<br>
20	anchors may be used to facilitate the positioning of the second permanent anchor. Applying the<br>
	second permanent anchor typically includes retracting the incrementor catheter once the second<br>
	permanent anchor is anchored into it desired location.<br>
		After both the first permanent anchor and the second permanent anchor are applied, a<br>
	locker is delivered into the heart in step 3240, Delivering the locker generally includes tracking<br>
25	the locker or locking devicr over the two tails of the first and the second permanent anchors.<br>
	the locker may be fixed into position by applying tension to the locker to create a plication<br>
	substantially between the two permanent anchors.<br>
		Once the locker has been tensioned, the tails of the anchors may be severed, and the<br>
	process of creating a plication is completed. It should be appreciated that in one embodiment,<br>
30	steps 3180 to 3260 may generally be repealed to create a daisy chain of interlocking plications.<br>
		Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described, it<br>
	should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms<br>
	without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present invention. By way of example,<br>
	methods of introducing plication elements Or suture structures into the left ventricle to correct<br>
35	for mitra1 valve leakage, or mitra1 valve insufficiency, may be applied to introducing plication<br>
	elements or suture structures which correct for leakage in other valves. For instance, the above-<br>
33<br><br>
	described procedure may be adapted for use in repair a leaking valve associated with a right<br>
	ventricle-<br>
		While creating local plications in fibrous tissue associated with the mitra1 valve of the<br>
	heart has generally been described, the plications may also be created in other types of tissue<br>
5	which are near, around, in proximity to, or include the mitra1 valve. As will be appreciated by<br>
	those skilled in the art, other tissues to which plications may be formed that are near, around, in<br>
	proximity to or include the mitra1 valve include tissues associated with the coronary sinus<br>
	tissues associated with the myocardium, or tissues associated with the wall of the left ventricle,<br>
	fn one embodiment, a plication may be substantially directly formed in the leaflets of the mitra1<br>
10	valve.<br>
		It should be understood that although a guide wire has been described as including an<br>
	anchoring tip to anchor the guide wire to a wall of the left ventricle, a guide wire may be<br>
	anchored with respect to the left ventricle in substantially any suitable manner. By way of<br>
	example, a guide wire may include an authoring feature which is located away from the tip of<br>
15	the guide wire. In addition, a guide wire may more generally be any suitable guiding element<br>
	which is configured to facilitate the positioning of an implant.<br>
		While access to the gutter of the left ventricle has been described as being associated<br>
	with a minimally invasive catheter annuloplasty procedure in which local plications are formed,<br>
	it should be understood that the gutter of the left ventricle may also be accessed, e.g., for an<br>
20	annuloplasty procedure, as a part of a surgical procedure in which local plications are formed.<br>
	For instance, the aorta of a heart may be accessed through an open chest surgical procedure<br>
	before a catheter is inserted into the aorta to reach the left ventricle. Alternatively, suture<br>
	structures or plications elements may be introduced on a ventricular side of a mitra1 valve<br>
	through a ventricular wall which is accessed during an open chest surgical procedure.<br>
25		Pledgets have been described as being used in conjunction with, or as a part of, suture<br>
	structures to facilitate the growth of scar tissue as a result of an annuloplaty procedure. it<br>
	should be appreciated, howevar, that the use of pledgets is optional. In addition, although<br>
	pledgets have generally not been described as being used with clip elements which create local<br>
	plications it should be understood that pledgets may also be implemented with respect to clip<br>
30	elements. By way of example, a clip element which includes tines may be configured such that<br>
	the Lines pierce through pledgets before engaging tissue without departing from the spirit or the<br>
	scope of the present invention.<br>
		When a clip element has tines that are arranged to pierce through a pledget before<br>
	engaging tissue, the pledget may be of a hollow, substantially cylindrical shape that enables the<br>
35	pledget he delivered to a left ventricle over a guide wire positioned in the gutter of the left<br>
	ventricle. The clip element may then be delivered by a catheter through the pledget. A<br>
34<br><br>
	substantially cylindrically shaped, hollow pledget which is to be used with a suture structure<br>
	may also be delivered Over a guide wire, and the suture structure may then be delivered through<br>
	the pledget. Delivering the suture structure through the pledget may enable a loop of thread that<br>
	remains after the suture structure is locked into place to remain substantially within the pledget. <br>
5		The configuration of clip elements may generally vary widely. Specifically, the shape of<br>
	clip elements the size of clip elements and the materials from which the clip elements are<br>
	formed may be widely varied. For instance, in addition to clip elements that are formed from<br>
	shape memory material, preloaded, or self-locking using mechanical structures clip elements<br>
	may also be formed from thermally expandable materials. That is a clip may be formed such<br>
10	that it is in an open or flat position when delivered into a left ventricle. Such a clip may have an<br>
	outer or "bottom" element that has a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, and an<br>
	inner or "top" element that deforms under the load generated by the outer element when heat is<br>
	applied to cause the outer element to bend. Such a clip, once bent or defonnel througt the<br>
	application of heat, may pierce tissue. When more heat is applied, the clip may bend more such<br>
15	that tissue is engaged between ends or sides of the clip to create a. local plication, In such a<br>
	system, the inner material may be arranged to maintain its deformed shape once heat is no longer<br>
	applied, and the heat may be apptied through a catheter.<br>
		Suture structures and plication elements have been described as being used to correct for<br>
	mitra1 valve insufficiency. In general, suture structures and plication dements may also be used<br>
20	to essentially prevent the onset of mitra1 valve insufficiency. That is. local plications may be<br>
	created to effectively stem the progression of mitra1 valve insuffiency be reinforcing the<br>
	perimeter of the annulus around the mitra1 valve.<br>
		While suture structures that include T-bans thread, and locking dements and are<br>
	delivered to a left ventricle using a catheter, maybe used to form discrete plications in fibrous<br>
25	tissue around the mitra1 valve, it should be appreciated that sutures may also be sewn into the<br>
	fibrous tissue. For example, a catheter which is inserted into the left ventricle through the aorta<br>
	may be configured to sew sutures into the fibrous tissue using mechanisms carried by the<br>
	catheter. Such sutures that are sewn into the fibrous tissue may be sewn in any conventional<br>
	orientation, e.g-, in an are along the perimeter of the posterior leaflet of the mitra1 valve. <br>
30		Suture struchires that include T-bars have generally been described as including two. T-<br>
	bars which are located at ends of a thread, with a locking element and pledgets located<br>
	there between, as shown, tor example, in Fig. 10a. The configuration of suture structures<br>
	however, may vary widely. By way of example, a suture structure with two T-bars may include<br>
	one T-bar at one end of the thread and a second T-bar which is located along the length of the<br>
35	thread such that pulling on a loose end of the thread pulls the two T-bars together. Alternatively,<br>
	a suture structure may include more than two T-bars.<br>
35<br><br>
		In general, the use of.a single element type to create local plications during an<br>
	annuloplasty procedure has been described. It should be understood that in one embodiment,<br>
	different element types may be used in a single annuloplasty procedure. For instance, both clip<br>
	elements and suture elements may be used to create plications during a single annuloplasty<br>
5	procedure. Alternatively, different types of clip elements or different types of suture elements<br>
	may be usad during a particular anrtuloplasty procedure.<br>
		The steps associated with performing a catheter-based annuloplasty may be widely<br>
	varied. Steps may generally be added removed, reordered, and altered without departing from<br>
	the spirit or the scope of the present invention. Therefore the present examples are to be.<br>
10	considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details<br>
	given herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
