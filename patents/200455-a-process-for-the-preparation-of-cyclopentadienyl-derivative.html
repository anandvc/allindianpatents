CYCLOPENTADIENYL DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
The present invention relates to new cyciopenradienyl derivatives and the process for their preparation.<br>
It is known that the more useful soluble catalysts for the homo- and co-polymerisation of a-olefins consist of zirconium or titanium complexes bearing ligands of bis-indenyl, bis-fluorenyl type, or mixed fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl type (P.C. Mchring, N.J. Coville, J. Organomet. Chem. 479, 1, 1994).<br>
It is also known zhaz the corresponding tetrahydrcincene derivacives, beside having a high activity, are more effective in the incorporation of CO- and ter-mcnomers and are, therefore, among the preferred catalysts.<br>
The indene or fluorene derivatives are easily avallable, but the corresponding tertrahydroindenyl derivatives are obtained by direct hydrogenation of the zirconium complex, as it is difficult to chemcselectively hydrogenate the starting ligands.<br>
The hydrogenation process of the complex shows, notwithstanding, somte inccveniences. In fact, as is reported    by    some     experts     (see     E.<br><br>
Samuel, Bull. Soc Chim. Fr. , 3548, 1966 and S, Collins et al. in Organometallic Chem. , 342, 21, 1988) , in effecting said hydrogenation difficulties are found due to low yields and/or drastic conditions.<br>
New cyclopentadienyl derivatives have, now, been found, which overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, because of their structure, they do not need the above-mentioned hydrogenation step of the complex with the zirconium.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to cyclopentadienyl derivatives having general formula (I)<br><br>
wherein:<br>
R/ Ri/ R2/ R^/ equivalent to or different from one another, are selected from:<br>
-	H,<br>
-	alkyl radicals having a number of carbon acorns<br>
from 1 to 5,<br><br>
-	cycloalkyl radicals having a number of carbon atoms from 5 to 8,<br>
-	aryl and alkylaryl radicals having a number of carbon atoms from 6 to 8,<br>
-	aralkyl radicals having a number of carbon atoms from 7 to 9;<br>
n is an integer from 2 to 18;<br>
with the proviso that the number of R different from<br>
H does not exceed 2;<br>
with  the  exclusion  of  the  compound having n=3,<br>
R=Ri=R2=R4=H.<br>
Typical examples of alkyl radicals from CI to C5 are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isc-butyl,  ter-butyl,  n-pentyl,  i so-pent yl,  nec*-<br>
oentvl.<br>
•■   ^<br>
Typical examioles of cycloalkyl radicals having a number of carbon atoms from 5 to 8 are cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methyl cyclopentyl, methyl cyclohexyl.<br>
Typical examples of aryl and alkylaryl radicals having a number of carbon atoms from 6 to 8 are phenyl, methyl phenyl, ethyl phenyl, dimethyl phenyl.<br>
Typical examples of aralkyl radicals having a numiber of carbon atoms from 7 to 9 are benzyl.<br><br>
methyl benzyl, ethyl benzyl, propyl benzyl.<br>
In a preferred form of embodiment, R, R1, R2, and R4 are selected from H and alkyl radicals from CI<br>
to C3.<br>
In an even more preferred form of emJDodiment, n<br>
is selected from 3, 5, 6, 10, R=R2=R1=H, R4 is selected from H and alkyl radicals from CI to C3.<br>
Typical examples of compounds having general formula (I) are;<br>
-	If 4, 5, 6, If 8-hexahydroazulene (compound la in<br>
scheme 1, where R=R1=R2=H, n=5) ;<br>
4,    5,    6,    If	8,    9-hexahydro-2H-<br>
cyclopentacyclooctene (ccm;pcund la in scheme 1, where R=R1=R2= H, n=6; ;<br>
-	4, 5, 6, 1, 8, 9, IC, 11, 12, 13-decahydro-2H-<br>
cyclopentacyclododecene (compound la in scheme 1,<br>
where R=R1=R2=H, n=lG);<br>
-	l-methyl-4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13-<br>
decahydro-2H-cyclop€ntacyclodcdecene (compound lb in<br>
scheme 1, where R=R1=R2=H, R4=CK3, n=10) .<br>
The compounds having general formula  (I)	are<br>
useful  as  ligands  in  the  preparation  of	the<br>
complexes  with  transition  metals.  Zirconium	in<br>
particular, typical catalyst components in	the<br>
(co)polymeR1sation of a-olefins.<br><br>
A process for the preparation of chemical compounds having general formula (I) constitutes a further object of the present invention.<br>
This process, schematically represented in scheme 1, where the compounds having general formula (I) are subdivided into (la) and (lb), compounds, whether R4 is equivalent to or different from H, foresees some common steps and a different final step as a function of R4.<br>
The process of the present invention, simple and oR1ginal, is schematized m Scheme 1.<br><br><br><br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds having general formula (la), where n is an integer from 2 to 18, preferably n is selected from 3, 5. 6, 10, and R, R1 and R2 have the above-mentioned meaning, preferably R=R1=R2=H, which compR1ses the following steps:<br>
a)	Stobbe type condensation between a ketone having general formula (II) (-CHR-)n+i C=0 with an ester of the succinic acid having general formula (III) R3OOC-CHR2-CHR—COOR3, where the groups R3, equivalent or different from one another, are selected from m.oncfunctional alkyl radicals C1-C5, preferably R3 is selected from CH3 and CcH^ to give the a-(a'-cyclo-alkenyl)-p-hydrcxycarbchyl-alkyl propionate having general formula (IV);<br>
b)	intramolecular condensation of the compound (IV) obtained in step (a) to give the condensed R1ngs com.pound having general formula (V) ;<br>
c)	hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the compound (V) obtained in szep (b) to give the a-P unsaturated condensed R1ngs ketone having general formula (VI);<br>
d)	reduction of the a-p unsaturated condensed R1ngs ketone (VI) obtained in step (c) to give the condensed  R1ngs  conjugated  diene  having  general<br><br>
formula (la),<br>
steps (b) and (c) also being able to be carR1ed out in inverted order as compared to the above-mentioned one, or in a single step, preferably in the sequence (a), (b), (c), (d).<br>
Step (a) of the present invention is a typical condensation between ketones and esters of the succinic acid, known as Stobbe reaction.<br>
This reaction (see H. House, Modern Synthetic Reactions, pages 663-666, Organic Reactions, Volume VI, pages 2-58) consists in the condensation of a carbonyl deR1vative with a diester of the succinic acid.<br>
In case the carbonyl deR1vative is a cyclcaikanone^ as in the abcve-mentoned case, the hemiester of the cyclo alkenyl substituted succinic acid, having general formula (IV) is formed.<br>
Step (a) is carR1ed out in the presence of strong bases, such as sodium methoxide, sodium hydR1de, tertiary alcohol alcoholates, preferably potassium terbutylate, a typical non-nucleophile strong base. As far as the other expeR1mental details of the Stobbe reaction are concerned, please refer to the above-mentioned references. Typical cyclic  ketones  having  general  formula  (II)  are<br><br>
cyclobutanone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone, cyclooctanone, cyclododecanone, 2-, 3-, 4- methyl cyclohexanone, phenyl cyclohexanone, benzyl cyclohexanone, One of the advantages of the process of the present invention consists in the fact that many ketones having general formula (II) are commercially available products.<br>
The condensation of step (a) occurs with a diester of the succinic acid having general formula (III) , preferably with a diethyl or dimethl succinate, eventually monosubstituted or disubstituted-<br>
Step (b) of the process of the present invention consists in an intramolecular condensation, with the elimination of water, of the product having general formula (IV) obtained in step (a) to give the condensed R1ngs compound having general formula (V) .<br>
This step is carR1ed out in the presence of usual condensation agents, for instance, strong acids such as sulphuR1c acid, hydrofluoR1c acid, phosphoR1c acid, polyphosphoR1c acid, preferably in the presence of polyphosphoR1c acid. The above-mientioned acid can be used as comimercially available or prepared in situ by mixing phosphoR1c acid and<br><br>
If polyphosphoR1c acid is used, it is preferable to carry out step (b) at temperatures between 70 and<br>
110°C.<br>
Alternatively, step (b) can be carR1ed out in the presence of ZnCl2 in acetic acid - acetic anhydR1de, as is descR1bed in the above-mentioned quotation from Organic Reactions,<br>
Step (c) consists in the hydrolysis of the ester group and in the subsequent decarboxylation of the compound having general formula (V) to give the a-? unsaturated condensed R1ngs ketone having general formula (VI). The reaction is preferably carR1ed out in an acid enviroR1ment and at such temperatures as to facilitate the elimination and the removal of CO2/ preferably in a mixture of acetic acid/hydrochicR1c acid at reflux temperature-<br>
The a-p unsaturated ketone (VI) formed in step (c) is then reduced (step d) to a cyclopentadienyl deR1vative having general formula (la) in the presence of reducing agents such as sodium or lithium boron hydR1de, sodium hydR1de, lithium hydR1de, lithium aluminium hydR1de, preferably with LiAlH4.<br>
According to another form of embodiment of the<br><br>
process of the present invention, step (c) , i. e. the hydrolysis to carboxylic acid and the subsequent decarboxylation, can be carR1ed out before the step of intramolecular condensation (b), or the two steps can be carR1ed out in a single step by selecting the most appropR1ate reaction conditions.<br>
The process of the present invention does not necessaR1ly require the isolation of the single reaction products at the end of the single steps.<br>
Beside the advantage to start from easily available cycloalkanones, the process foresees rather simple chemical steps and has a satisfactory global yield.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the com.pounds having general formula (lb) , where n is an integer from 2 to 18, preferably selected from 3, 5, 6, 10, R, R;, R2, R4 have the above-mentioned meaning but with the proviso that R^ is different from H, preferably R=R1=R2=H, which comipR1ses the following steps; a) Stobbe type condensation between a ketone having general formula (11) {-CHR-)n^i C=0 with an ester of the succinic acid having general formula (III) R3OOC-CHR2-CKR1-COOR3, where the groups R3, equivalent or different  from  one  another,  are  selected  from<br><br>
monofunctional alkyl radicals Ci-Cs, preferably R3 is selected from CH3 and C2H5/ to give the a-(a'-cyclc-alkenyl)-p-hydroxycarbonyl-aikyl propionate having general formula (IV);<br>
b)	intramolecular condensation of the compound (IV) obtained in step (a) to give the condensed R1ngs compound having general formula (V);<br>
c)	hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the compound (V) obtained in step (b) to give the a-p unsaturated condensed R1ngs ketone having general formula (VI);<br>
d)	reaction of the a^P unsaturated condensed R1ngs ketone (VI) obtained in step (c) with an alkyl, aralkyl, alkylaryl, cyclcalky 1 deR1vative of ar. a 1 kali metal ar,d subsequent: hydrolysaticn to give the condensed R1ngs conjugated diene having general formula (lb),<br>
steps (b) and (c) being also able to be carR1ed out in inverted order as compared to the above-mentioned one, or in a single step, preferably in the sequence (a), (b), (c), (d) .<br>
As far as   steps (a) to (c) are concerned, they are carR1ed out under the same conditions as the above-mentioned  ones  for  the  synthesis  of  (la) compounds. Step (d) is carR1ed out by reacting the a-p unsaturated condensed R1ngs' ketone (VI) obtained<br><br>
in step (c) with an alkyl, aralkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl deR1vative of an alkali metal, preferably lithium. The hydrocarbon deR1vative of lithium is a function of the type of R4 that one is willing to introduce in the compound having general formula (lb). So, for instance, in case one is willing to prepare an (lb) compound where R4 is equivalent to -CH3, one will use methyl lithium; in case one is willing to prepare an (lb) compound where R^ is equivalent to -C2H5, one will use ethyl lithium.<br>
Step (d) then foresees a subsequent hydrolysis srep, preferably carR1ed out in the presence of acid catalysis, ar.c then a dehydration step, preferably carR1ed out in the presence of acid catalysis, icc. The product (lb) thus obtained can be isolated according to usual techniques.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of c\ clopentadicnyl compounds having tlic general formula (lb);<br><br>
where n is an integer from 2 to 18, R, R1, R2, R4 have tlie above-mentioned meaning but witli llie proviso that Rj is different from H, which compR1ses the following steps:<br>
(a)      Stobbe type condensation between a ketone having formula (II);<br><br>
where the groups Ru equivalent or ditTerent from one another, are selected from monofimctional alkyl radicals Cj-Cj, to give the a-(a'-cycloalkenyl)-p-hydroxycarbonyl-alkyl propionate having fonnula (IV);<br><br><br>
(b)	intramolecular condensation of the compound (IV) obtained in step (a) to give<br>
the condensed R1ng compound having fonnula (v):<br><br>
(c)	hydrolysis and decarbox\'lation of the compound (V) obtained in step (b) to<br>
gi\ e t!ie a,(3-unsaturated condensed R1ng ketone having formula (VI):<br><br>
(d)	reaction of the a,p-unsaturated condensed R1ng ketone (VI) obtained in step (c)<br>
with an alkyl, aralkyl, alkylar&gt;l. cycloalkyl deR1vative of an alkali metal and<br>
subsequent hydrol&gt;*zation to give tlie conjugated condensed R1ng diene having formula<br>
(lb), steps (b) and (c) also being able to be carR1ed out in the inverted order as<br>
compared to llie above mentioned one, or in a single step.<br>
Tlie following examples are reported for a better illustration of the present invention.<br>

(75 grams, 0.67 moles) is slowly added (in about 1 hour), maintaining the temperature between 20 and 30 °C, At the end a yellow suspension is obtained which, after about one hour is dissolved again to give, then, a complete solidification of the reaction product. It is all poured in about 2 liters water, thus obtaining a limpid solution.<br>
The solution is extracted for some times with ethyl ether and the aqueous solution is then acidified to a pH of 2-3, by using dilute HCl.<br>
The aqueous solution thus acidized is then extracted with ether and the organic extract, after washing with water to neutrality and after drying, is evaporated,<br>
118 grams (99% yield) a-(a'-cycloheptenyl)-p-hydroxycarbonyl-ethyl procicnare (ccm.pound IV) are obtained pure at the NMR analysis.<br>
The emiester (IV) is then added to a mixture consisting of 400 grams HaPO^ 85% and 650 grams P2O5, miaintaining the temperature between 90 and 92°C.<br>
Once the addition has ended, the temperature is maintained for further 4 hours, duR1ng which there is an abundant development of foami.<br>
The mixture is then hydrolized with water and extracted with diethyl ether. The ethereal extract<br><br>
is neutralized and dR1ed. After the evaporation of the solvent, 35 grams of raw residue (64% yield of product V)are obtained, which are poured into 100 ml AcOH, 100 ml water and 10 ml concentrated HCl and then maintained at reflux temperature for one night.

The mixture is then hydrolized with water and extracted with diethyl ether. The ether extract is neutralized and dR1ed. After the evaporation of the solvent, 90 grams of a raw residue, pure at the GC analysis (product V in scheme 1, where n=10, R=R1=R2=H, R3=Et) are obtained.<br>
The solid is put into a solution consisting in 125 ml AcOH, 12 5 ml water and 10 ml concentrated KCl, and maintained under reflux temperature for 20<br><br>
hours. The reaction mass is diluted with water and extracted with petroleum ether. After the neutralization, drying and evaporation of the solvent, the residue is distilled under vacuum and the fraction which passes at 125-130°C/0.2 mmHg is collected. 4 3 grams (51% yield) of product VI in scheme 1 having n=10, R=R1=R2=K, are obtained.<br>
24 grams (0.11 moles) of the product thus obtained are dissolved in 200 ml diethyl ether and then added to a solution of 3.0 grams LiAlH^ in 300 ml diethyl ether, maintaining the temperature between 5 and 10°C.<br>
The reaction m^ixture is then hydrolized with some diluted KCl, the ethereal layer separated and the aqueous phase extracted still with 200 mJ diethyl ether.<br>
The ethereal extracts, (800 ml) after neutralisation and anhydR1fication are treated with 2.7 grams p-toluenesulphonic acid for 1.5 hours at room temperature, then at 30-35°C for 5-6 hours until the alcohol (TLC) has disappeared. The organic phase is then neutralized with NaHC03 and evaporated. The residue obtained is puR1fied by chromatography on a silica gel columin by eluting with petroleum ether.<br><br>
21 grams (99% yield) ot a mixture consisu^ag m two products in a ratio of 81:19, of which the main product is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13-decahydro-2H-cyclopentacyclododecene (compound la in scheme 1, n=lC, R=R1=R2=H) are obtained. EXAMPLE 4 - Synthesis of 1-methyl- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13-decahydro-2H-cyclopentacyclododecene (compound lb in scheme 1, where R=R1=R2=H, R4=CH3, n=10).<br>
To a solution, in 100 ml diethyl ether, of 10 grams (0.045 moles) of the carbonylic deR1vative prepared in example 3 (product VI in scheme 1, n=10, R=R: = R2=H) , maintained at -7C°C, 30 ml of a solution 1,6 M of MeLi in diethyl ether are added. The miixture is left under stirR1ng for one night, then hydrclyzed. The ethereal phase is separated, 1 gram p-tcluenesulphonic acid is added and the mixture is lefi  under stirR1ng for 2 hours.<br>
Tne mixwure is neutralized with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, dR1ed on NasSO^ and the solvent is evaporated. The product is eluted on a silica gel column by using petroleum ether and by collecting the first fraction. 7 grams of a product consisting in two isomers in a ratio of 3:1 from the gaschromiatographic analysis are obtained.<br><br>
The main product of the above-mentioned mixture is consisting in l-methyl-4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13-decaliydro-2II-cyclopentacyclodedecene.<br>
