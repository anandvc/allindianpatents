				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns with a disc milling cutter for chip-forming machining of cylindrical contours in a workpiece, especially of eccentrically designed cylindrical contours on a workpiece that can be rotated about its longitudinal axis like a crankshaft, by making use of many cutting units that are arranged in a tilted manner with an axial inclmation angle peripherally on a disc-shaped tool holder, with one part of the cutting units bemg radially clamped for the cheek milling and grooving operations, and the other part bemg clamped tangentially for machining the journal outside diameter.<br>
In WO 96/39269 are described a method for the chip-forming machining of cylindrical corrections, as well as a device for executing this method. The method under reference makes use of the so-called blanking, in which the production of the finish contour, which as such already possesses linished dimensions or even an allowance which can be removed by grinding or finishing, is carried out with tools, which are brought into engagement with the worlqiiece through attached cutting units, either as one-after-the-other or even as simultaneously. In the case of a crankshaft, thus the machining of the cheeks and the machining of the grooves and the journal of a crankshaft is distributed, or, the manufacture of a half contour of crankshaft cheek with one groove or of a part diameter using a first tool, and the manufacture of a second groove and the remaining diameter portion using a second tool. This distribution enables the variation of the bearing width within definite limits. Preferably, while machining, the so-called high¬speed milling method is employed, in which case the tool is rotated with constantly high or variable speed. With high-speed milling, cutting speeds of more than 160 m/min. are employed. The chip thicknesses lie in the region of 0.05 to 0.1 mm. The curved length of cut, i.e., the length of the tool holder in engagement with the corresponding cutting unit, with reference to its total circumference, is selected to be as small as possible. By these means, so good surface qualities can be produced, that the pre-grinding or additional pre-treatments prior to heat treatment can be completely dispensed widi as additional operations. With the methods described m WO 96/39269, it is suggested to provide throw-away inserts in different tools, for the cheek machining operation or the<br><br>
journal machining on the one hand, and for the grooving on the other hand. All the cutting units used must have a positive rake angle, whereby the adjustment of the cutting unit is carried out for the workpiece in such a manner that the effective rake angle is selected to be between - 5° and + 15", preferable between - 5" and + 5°, and/or a positive axial rake (back rake angle) of upto 10°.<br>
hi a special version example selected there, there are two types of inserts in a disc nulling cutter, of which the first type is clamped radially, and the second type is clamped tangentially in the tool holder or in the adaptor at that place.<br>
If a disc milling cutter possess at its cylindrical surface two neighbouring rows of tangentially clamped inserts, then, there is the danger of manufacturing inaccuracies, or, in the case of divided tool, height offset due to positioning inaccuracies of the machine tool used, due to which, in the overlapping region on the machined woriqiiece, an desirable sharp-edged allowance develops, hi order to eliminate this overlap, a cutting unit is suggested in WO 96/39269, whose rake faces in the region of the cutting edge forming a cutting comer possess a flattening or recessmg which extends in the region of both the neighbouring main cuttmg edges. Such cutting units enable the production of smooth transitions m the overlapping region, for example with the production of a j oumal surface of a crankshaft journal.<br>
In WO 96/39269 are further represented radially clamped cutting units for the production of an undercut of a crankshaft.<br>
In the DE 197 39 300 Al patent, a cutting unit is described for the cutting of profiles, especially for the millmg of profile grooves in rotarily moved workpieces like crankshafts. This cutting unit possesses an essentially cubical basic body having at least two useful cutting edges; two flat side faces arranged parallel to each other and having a single through clamping hole; and two bottom faces, which have a rake face respectively at their ends lying opposite to each othCT, this rake face being limited by the cutting edges<br><br>
built in arc shape corresponding to the profile being cut. The clearance face lying between two cutting edges that are opposite to each other should at least be built partly circularly concave. Due to this concave design of the clearance face, there is an increase in the clearance angle and a larger fi-ee space to the middle of the clearance face, whereby the desired tilts of this cutting unit relative to the workpiece are possible.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to further develop the disc milling cutter mentioned in the begiiming to the effect that a smoother cutting is realised during machining, and, at the existing cylinder circumference of the disc milling cutter, a majumum possible number of cutting tools can be arranged. This purpose is achieved by a disc milling cutter as per Claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, the tangentially clamped cutting units are arranged under an axial inclination angle of 25^ + 10°, preferable under an inclination angle of 20° to 30". When referred to the direction of rotation of the milling cutter, the rearmost cutting comer of such a cutting unit lies on a straight vertical to the direction of rotation of the disc milling cutter, which has a distance of 
As per the disc milling cutters known as per the state-of-the-art, the adjustment of the axial angle is limited to a few angle measures, in order to keep as low as possible the space requirement for the peripherally and tangentially clamped cutting units, preferably having square rake face, since any inclination about an axial angle would increase the respective distance to the subsequently following radially-clamped cutting unit, considering the chip space still provided on the tool holder. With the selected axial inclination angle for the tangential cutting units, it is however possible to sink the respective rearmost cutting corner of the cutting unit towards inside, so that its distance, measured by a perpendicular to a straight line lying perpendicular to the milling direction, from die cutting edge of the subsequently following radially-clamped cutting unit can be<br><br>
minimised to preferably less than 2 mm, to negative values. With negative distance values, such arrangements of the tangentially-clamped cutting units are to be included, in which the rearmost cutting comer of the subsequently following radial cutting unit lies. With the selected arrangement, it is possible to increase the number of useful cutting units in the tool holder.<br>
Further developments of the invention are described in the sub-claims.<br>
Thus, preferably, the tangentially-clamped cutting unit is arranged m such a manner that, during machining, the shortest distance - of the inactive cutting edge or its extension which is turned to the cutting edge of the cylinder of the disc milling cutter - to the subsequently-lymg cutting comer of the radially-clamped following cutting unit arranged in the cutting direction is selected to be &gt; 1 mm. By these means, it is ensured that ample space remains for the so important chip room before the radially-clamped cutting unit, and that the chips running over there do not collide with the inactive cutting edge (turned to the chip room) of the tangentially-clamped cutting edge, or cannot damage this cutting edge. This is especially of importance for the so-called throw-away inserts, which have respectively four useful cutting edges. 25 is suggested as the preferred value for the axial inclination angle of the tangentially-clamped cutting units.<br>
Referred to the cutting direction, the disc milling cutter possesses respectively tangentially and radially-clamped, cutting units in alternating series on a cylindrical envelope of the tool holder, or, expressed in other words, radially-clamped cutting units respectively at the edge of the disc milling cutter cylinder, respectively to which, to the right and left, tangentially-clamped cutting units are arranged spatially. The two rows of the tangentially-clamped cutting units built hereby have cutting units, which, as per their row relationship, are inclined under an opposed axial angle.<br>
As per another version of the invention, the cutting regions of pairs of tangentially-clamped cutting units following each other overlap by a negUgible amount.<br><br>
With the disc milling cutters as per the invention, chip thicknesses of the order of 0.1 mm to 0.25 mm are produced with cutting speeds of 160 m/min and more.<br>
An example of the version of the invention is represented in the drawings. They show the following:<br>
Fig 1    :   A schematic view of a device for the machining of crankshafts;<br>
Fig 2   :  A plan view over a part  of the cylindrical  contour,  to which cutting units are attached, of a disc milling cutter as per the invention;<br>
Fig 3   :    A   perspective   part   view   of   the   disc-milling   cutter   as   per   the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, a device 100 for the chip-forming machining of a crankshaft 10 is represented purely schematically. The crankshaft 10 is so clamped with its ends 11 and 12 in drivable and rotatable clamping chucks 13, 14, that it can be rotated about its middle longitudinal axis. For the purpose of machining are used disc-shaped high-speed tools 15, 16, which can be set to rotation over corresponding drives 17, 18 where each drive 17, 18 is positioned on a support 19,20, whereby the tool is guided on an axis of the workpiece. Further, in the device represented, two orthogonal rotating milling cutters 21, 22 are arranged, which likewise rotate over corresponding drives 23, 24. Each orthogonal rotatmg milling cutters 21, 22 is supported on a support with respectively two slides 25, 26 and 27, 28, so that a guidance is possible for each orthogonal rotating millmg cutter 21, 22 also with the rotating crankshaft. With the device r^resented, simultaneous machining of four bearing positions of the crankshaft is possible.<br>
In order to carry out a chip-forming machining of a crankshaft bearing journals arranged eccentrically outside the center of rotation of the workpiece 10, the disc milling cutter 15 or 16 is driven at constant or variable high speed about its middle axis, so that the cutting units arranged at its outer circumference are led past with a high speed at the woridng<br><br>
position of the workpiece. Finer details for the machining of the crankshaft are described in WO 96/39269, for which reference has been made.<br>
Each one of the disc milling cutter 15, 16 possesses clamped cutting units 29 to 32 at its outer cylindrical profile, of which the cutting units 29 and 30 are clamped radially, and the cutting units 31 and 32 are clamped tangentially. By rotating the disc milling cutters in the direction of the arrow 33 indicated, there come to use one after the other, the respective active cutting edges of the cutting units 30, 31, 29 and 32, with the preferably selected small cutting arc length one after the other. While the axia! inclination angle a = 25° of the cutting units 31 is selected in the clock-wise direction, the tangentially clamped cutting units 32 are inclined by an inclination angle a = 25° opposite the clock-wise direction. By this, the respectively rearmost cutting comer 34 or 35 of the cutting unit 31 or 32 is bent inward, whereby, the value of the distance a shown in Fig. 2 amounts to 
With the disc millmg cutter according to Fig. 2 as per the invention, the production of double grooves is possible by the use of the cutting units 29 and 30, and the simultaneous production of formation of a cylindrical contour surface by the use of the cutting edges 31 and 32. The cutting range of both the inversely arranged rows of the tangentially clamped cutting units 31,32 overly by a negligible amount.<br>
The tangentially clamped cuttmg units 31, 32 seen in Fig. 3 further have notches 39 additionally along the respective active cutting edges, these notches being known as per the state-of-the-art. These notches ensure that, during machining, instead of a single wide<br><br>
chip, more number of smaller chips are produced depending on the number of notches. For the rest, the tangentially clamped cutting units correspond to the tangentially clamped cutting units represented in WO 96/39269. The radial cutting units have a form design which corresponds to that described in DE 197 39 300 Al.<br><br><br>
