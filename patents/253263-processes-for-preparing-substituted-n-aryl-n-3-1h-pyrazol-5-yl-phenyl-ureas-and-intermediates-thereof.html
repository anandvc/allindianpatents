PROCESSES FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED N-ARYL-N'-'3-(1H-PYRAZOL-5-YL)PHENYL! UREAS AND INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to processes for the preparation of substituted phenylpyrazole ureas that are useful as 5-HT2A serotonin receptor modulators for the treatment of disease.<br>
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
G protein-coupled receptors share a common structural motif. All these receptors have seven sequences of between 22 to 24 hydrophobic amino acids that form seven alpha helices, each of which spans the membrane. The transmembrane helices are joined by strands of amino acids having a larger loop between the fourth and fifth transmembrane helix on the extracellular side of the membrane.<br>
 Another larger loop, composed primarily of hydrophilic amino acids, joins transmembrane helices five and six on the intracellular side of the membrane. The carboxy terminus of the receptor lies intracellularly with the amino terminus in the extracellular space. It is thought that the loop joining helices five and six, as well as, the carboxy terminus, interact with the G protein. Currently, Gq, Gs, Gi and Go are G proteins that have been identified.<br>
	Under physiological conditions, G protein-coupled receptors exist in the cell membrane in<br>
equilibrium between two different states or conformations: an "inactive" state and an "active" state. A receptor in an inactive state is unable to link to the intracellular transduction pathway to produce a biological response. Changing the receptor conformation to the active state allows linkage to the transduction pathway and produces a biological response.<br>
	A receptor may be stabilized in an active state by an endogenous ligand or an exogenous<br>
agonist ligand. Recent discoveries such as, including but not exclusively limited to, modifications to the amino acid sequence of the receptor provide means other than ligands to stabilize the active state conformation. These means effectively stabilize the receptor in an active state by simulating the effect of a ligand binding to the receptor. Stabilization by such ligand-independent means is termed<br>
 "constitutive receptor activation."<br>
Receptors for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are an important class of G protein-coupled receptors. Serotonin is thought to play a role in processes related to learning and memory, sleep, thermoregulation, mood, motor activity, pain, sexual and aggressive behaviors, appetite, neurodegenerative regulation, and biological rhythms. Not surprisingly, serotonin is linked to<br>
 pathophysiological conditions such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, autism, migraine, emesis, alcoholism, and neurodegenerative disorders. With respect to an anti-psychotic treatment, approaches focused on the serotonin receptors, these types of<br><br>
WO 2005/103011	PCT/US2004/023880<br>
2<br>
therapeutics can generally be divided into two classes, the "typical" and fee "atypical." Both have anti-psychotic effects, but the typicals also include concomitant motor-related side effects (extra pyramidal syndromes, e.g., lip-smacking, tongue darting, locomotor movement, etc). Such side effects are thought to be associated with the compounds interacting with other receptors, such as the human dopamine D2 receptor in the nigro-striatal pathway. Therefore, an atypical treatment is preferred. Haloperidol is considered a typical anti-psychotic, and clozapine is considered an atypical anti-psychotic.<br>
Serotonin receptors are divided into seven subfamilies, referred to as 5-HTi through 5-HT7, inclusive. These subfamilies are further divided into subtypes. For example, the 5-HT2 subfamily is divided into three receptor subtypes: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C- The human 5-HT2c receptor was first isolated and cloned in 1987, and the human 5-HT2A receptor was first isolated and cloned in 1990. These two receptors are thought to be the site of action of hallucinogenic drugs. Additionally, antagonists to the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2c receptors are believed to be useful in treating depression, anxiety, psychosis, and eating disorders.<br>
Isolation, characterization, and expression of a functional cDNA clone encoding the entire human 5-HT1c receptor (now known as the 5-HT2C receptor) and the entire human 5-HT2A receptor are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,985,352 and 5,661,012, respectively. Mutations of the endogenous forms of the rat 5-HT2A and rat 5-HT2c receptors have been reported to lead to constitutive activation of these receptors (5-HT2A: Casey, C. et al. (1996) Society for Neuroscience Abstracts, 22:699.10, 5-HT2C: Herrick-Davis, K., and Teitler, M. (1996 Society for Neuroscience Abstracts, 22:699.18,; and Herrick-Davis, K. et al. (1997)/. Neurochemistry 69(3): 1138).<br>
Small molecule modulators of serotonin receptors have been shown to have a variety of therapeutic applications such as for the treatment of any of the diseases listed above. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for the preparation of compounds that can modulate serotonin receptors. The processes and intermediates described are directed to this and other needs.<br>

Starting materials bearing isocyanate and isocyanate equivalent moieties are well known in the art and commercially available. These can also be routinely prepared from corresponding anilines by reaction with an isocyanate-generating reagent, which includes materials that react with the amino group of an aniline to form an isocyanate equivalent group. For example, an isocyanate-bearing compound can be readily prepared by reacting the corresponding aniline with an isocyanate-generating reagent such as, for example, phosgene (i.e., C12C=O) or triphosgene [i.e., bis-trichloromethyl carbonate, C13COC(O)OCC13] to generate the isocyanate derivative which can then be optionally isolated. Another procedure for preparing isocyanates involves using the isocyanate-generating reagent di-^-butyltricarbonate to generate isocyanates from anilines in a similar manner as described above. An example of this procedure is reported by Peerlings et al. in Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 1021-1024, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These procedures and others known in the art can give rise to isocyanates as illustrated in Schemes Ha, lib and He below.<br><br><br>

optically active forms from optically active starting materials are known in the art, such as by<br>
resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis.	t<br>
The processes described herein can be stereoselective such that any given reaction starting with one or more chiral reagents enriched in one stereoisomer forms a product that is also enriched in one stereoisomer. The reaction can be conducted such that the product of the reaction substantially retains one or more chiral centers present in the starting materials.

Example 1: Preparation of 3-dimethylammo-l-(2'-methoxy-5'-acetamidophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (4).<br>
Dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (693.3 g) was added to a suspension of 2'-methoxy-5'-acetamidoacetophenone (3,1215.1 g) in ethanol (12.15 L) stirred under nitrogen at 22° C. After the resulting suspension had been stirred and refluxed under nitrogen for 18 hours, all solids had dissolved, and additional dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (346.2 g) was added to the homogeneous reaction mixture. Stirring and refluxing under nitrogen were continued for an additional 30 hours, after which additional dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (346.2 g) was added. The reaction mixture was then stirred and refluxed under nitrogen for a final 17.5 hours, after which the reaction mixture was rotary evaporated at 
Example 2: Preparation of 5-(2'-methoxy-5'-acetamidophenyl)-l-methyl-i//-pyrazoIe (5).<br><br>
Methylhydrazine (319.3 g) was added to methanol (13.931 L) stirred and chilled to -15° C under nitrogen. Aqueous HC1 (37 wt %, 1859.6 g) was then added at a rate sufficiently slow to enable the stirred solution to be maintained at -12 to -7° C with reactor jacket cooling. As stirring under nitrogen was continued at. -10° C, 3-dimethylamino-l-(2'-methoxy-5'-acetamidophenyl)prop-2-en-l-one (4, 1546.9 g) was added as a solid over ten minutes. The resulting homogenous dark brown solution was stirred under nitrogen first at 0° C for 3 hours and then at 10° C for 5.5 hours before 33% aqueous ammonia (1090 mL) was added at a rate sufficiently slow (25 minutes) to enable the stirred solution to be maintained at 8.6-15.2° C with reactor jacket cooling. LC/MS analyses of the reaction mixture before aqueous ammonia treatment revealed 97.3% conversion of 4 to 5 and its other N-methylpyrazole isomer (in 83.3:13.2 ratio) and, after aqueous ammonia treatment, 100% conversion of 4 to 5 and its other N-methylpyrazole isomer (in 87.8:12.2 ratio). The aqueous ammonia addition raised the reaction<br><br>

mixture pH to 8. Methanol (ca. 12 L) was then distilled off the stirred reaction mixture at atmospheric pressure and internal temperatures rising to 74.4° C. Product crystallization, which started at the end of the distillation, was completed by cooling the reaction mixture to -2° C and holding that temperature with stirring for 44 hours. LC/MS analysis of the crystallization mixture's liquid phase revealed 5 and its other N-methylpyrazole isomer in about 1:3 ratio. (Higher ratios of 5 : other isomer in the liquid phase jeopardize product yield, and lower ratios jeopardize product purity. In either case, the crystallization can be repeated by heating the stirred mixture back to reflux at atmospheric pressure and, prior to recrystallization, either distilling off more methanol (if the ratio is high) or adding additional methanol (if the ratio is low).) The reaction mixture was filtered by suction, and the filtered solids were washed with 0° C water (3 L, then 2 x 500 mL) and dried at 40° C, 
Example 3: Preparation of 5-(2'-Methoxy-5'-acetamidophenyl)-4-bromo-l-methyl-iiJ-pyrazole (6)-<br>
To a solution of 5-(2'-methoxy-5'-acetamidophenyl)-l-methyl-7if-pyrazole (5, 1141.8 g) in methanol (13.75 L) stirred under nitrogen was added solid N-bromosuccinimide (911.5 g) portionwise at a rate sufficiently slow to enable the reaction mixture to be maintained at 13.5-22.5° C with reactor jacket cooling. Bromopyrazole 6 started to precipitate about three-quarters the way through the addition, which took about 20 minutes to complete. After 30 minutes of continued stirring at 22° C, LC/MS analysis of the reaction slurry revealed complete conversion of 5 to 6; there was no detectable starting material 5. The stirred reaction mixture was then distilled to substantial dryness at 10 mm HgA and internal temperatures up to 30° C. The resulting, solid residue was broken up, slurried in a solution of sodium hydroxide (482.25 g) in water (11.538 L) at 25° C for one hour to remove succinimide byproduct, filtered by suction, washed with water (2 x 1000 mL), and dried at 22° C and ca. 10 mm HgA to provide 6 (1385.7 g, 91.8% crude yield) containing ca. 3.2 mole % 5 as the only significant impurity.<br><br>

Example 4: Preparation of 5-(2'-methoxy-5'-aminophenyl)-4-bromo-l-methyl-iJHr-pyrazole (c).<br>
The 5-(2'-methoxy-5'-acetamidophenyl)-4-bromo-l-methyl-/#-pyrazole (6, 1385.7 g) from the previous example, which was contaminated with ca. 3.2 mole % 5, was slurried in methanol (13.3 L) at 22° C under nitrogen. To the resulting suspension stirred at 22° C under nitrogen was added solid N-bromosuccinimide (136.7 g total) in three portions. The first portion of N-bromosuccinimide (68.3 g) left ca. 2.8 mole % unreacted 5 after 80 minutes. Then the second portion of N-bromosuccinimide (34.2 g) left ca. 1.8 mole % unreacted 5 after an additional 60 minutes. Then, after the third portion of N-bromosuccinimide (34.2 g) was added, conversion of 5 to 6 was complete within 15 minutes. There was no detectable starting material 5. Aqueous sodium hydroxide (50 wt %; 2606.8 g) was then added to the stirred suspension of 6 over 35 minutes at a rate sufficiently slow to enable the reaction mixture to be maintained at 10.4-24° C with reactor jacket cooling. After the addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide, a reaction mixture sample was found to contain debrominated 5 in about 2.5 mole % of the amount of 6. Methanol (about 12 L) was then distilled off the stirred reaction mixture over eight hours at 10 mm HgA and internal temperatures rising to 84° C. LC/MS analysis of the reaction mixture, now about 5.5 L of a thick but stirrable suspension, showed complete hydrolysis of 6 to 7 plus about 2 mole % of the desbromo analog of 7. Removal of substantially all remaining methanol (about 1.6 L) by continued distillation over four hours at 10 mm HgA and internal temperatures rising to 55° C left an unstirrable residue. Upon addition of diisopropyl ether (12 L) and water (1000 mL) and heating to 65° C, the mixture became stirrable, and the solids dissolved completely to provide two liquid phases. The lower (aqueous) phase was drained from the upper (organic) phase, which was then extracted with additional water (1000 mL). The aqueous phases were combined and extracted with more diisopropyl ether (4 L). After extraction with water (1000 mL), the second upper (organic) phase was combined with the first, and the resulting mixture was reheated to 50° C to completely dissolve all solids. The resulting diisopropyl ether solution was then cooled to -5° C with stirring over seven hours, during which time 7 crystallized. After being stirred at -5° C for five more hours, the resulting suspension was filtered by suction. The filtered solid was washed with.0" C diisopropyl ether (1.0 L) and dried at 40° C and <l mm hga to provide g yield of purity by hplc with ca. wt desbromo as the largest impurity. crystallization and wash liquors were combined evaporated first at c atmospheric></l><br>

A solution of 7 (101.9 g, 0.3612 mole) in toluene (1020 mL) was stirred and refluxed at atmospheric pressure through a Dean-Stark trap under nitrogen to remove 0.5 mL of water. After the condensate had become completely clear with no further accumulation of water in the Dean-Stark trap, the toluene solution was cooled to ambient temperature, filtered to remove small amounts of insoluble debris, and returned to the reaction flask. While the azeotropically dried toluene solution of 7 was cooled with a water bath and stirred with an overhead stirrer under nitrogen, 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate (55.5 g, 0.3614 mole) was added as a solid in three roughly equal portions. Addition of the first portion over about two minutes caused the reaction mixture temperature to rise from 18.5° C to 23.5° C. After the reaction mixture had been cooled to 18.7° C, the next two portions of 4-chlorophenyl isocyanate were added over about five minutes without change in reaction mixture temperature. During addition of the first portion, a second (lower) liquid phase separated from the toluene phase. Five minutes after the addition of the last portion had been completed, that second (lower) liquid phase started to crystallize, causing the reaction mixture temperature to rise to 22.5° C over the next ten minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature'under nitrogen for 2.5 more hours and then suction filtered. The filtered solid was washed with toluene (150 mL, ambient temperature) and dried at 97° C and pressures falling to 1 mm HgA over 28 hours to provide 9 (150.08 g, 95.3% yield) containing 1.0 mole % desbromo 9 as the only impurity detectable by 'H-NMR and LC/MS analyses.<br>
