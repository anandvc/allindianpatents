				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Intraocular Tension Lowering Compositions for Topical Administration<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel medical composition for topical<br>
administration showing excellent intraocular tension lowering activity.<br>
[Background of the Technology]<br>
It has been well-known that angiotensin II antagonists lower intraocular tension<br>
when topically administered (EP 795326, EP 631780, WO 95/21609, WO 91/15206,<br>
etc.). In particular, the following compounds are known as representative drugs.<br><br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
As the result of various investigation on preparations and pharmacologies of<br>
topical compositions containing angiotensin II antagonists, the present inventors<br>
have found that the intraocular tension lowering activity of angiotensin II antagonists<br>
can be reinforced by adding one or more boric acids and one or more<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acids to the composition. Thus, the present invention<br>
has been established.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to:<br>
(1)	an intraocular tension lowering topical composition containing an angiotensin II<br>
antagonist, a boric acid and an ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid.<br>
Said composition preferably is<br>
(2)	a composition in which the angiotensin II antagonist is a compound of the<br>
following general formula (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt or derivative<br>
thereof:<br><br>
(3)	a composition in which R1 represents a group of the structure (la), (lb) or (Ic);<br>
(4)	a composition in which the compound of general formula (I) is a compound<br>
selected from 4-1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2-propyl-1-{4-[2-(tetrazol-5-<br>
yl)phenyl]phenyl}methylimidazole-5-carboxylic acid and 2-ethoxy-1-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-<br>
yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl-1 H-benzimidazole-7-carboxylic acid;<br>
(5)	a composition additionally containing a preservative; and<br>
(6)	a composition in which the preservative is a paraben.<br>
Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a method of lowering<br>
intraocular tension which comprises administering a composition as described in any<br><br><br>
one of (1) to (6) above containing a pharmacologically effective amount of an<br>
angiotensin II antagonist to a warm-blooded animal (preferably human); In<br>
particular, it is to provide a method of lowering intraocular tension caused by<br>
glaucoma (including glaucoma with normal intraocular tension) or ocular<br>
hypertension.<br>
In the present invention,<br>
"boric acid" includes boric acid and substances equivalent to a boric acid. A<br>
substance equivalent to boric acid is a compound that gives rise to borate ion when<br>
dissolved in water. Examples of such compounds are boric anhydride (B2O3),<br>
tetraboric acid (H2B4O7), as well as pharmacologically acceptable salts of boric acid,<br>
boric anhydride, and tetraboric acid. Boric acid, boric anhydride, borax and sodium<br>
borate decahydrate are preferred. Boric acid is more preferred.<br>
These boric acids may be used singly or in combination of two or more members.<br>
"Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid" indudes ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and<br>
substances equivalent to ethylenediamine tetraacetic add. A substance equivalent<br>
to ethylenediamine tetraacetic add is a compound that gives rise to an<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetate ion when dissolved in water. Such compounds include<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic add, and<br>
appropriate examples thereof are ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, disodium<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetate dihydrate, trisodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate<br>
trihydrate, disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate dihydrate, and tetrasodium<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetate tetrahydrate. Disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate<br>
dihydrate is most preferred.<br>
These ethylenediamine tetraacetic acids may be used singly or in combination of<br>
two or more members.<br>
"Angiotensin II antagonists" preferably mean the compounds of the following<br>
general formula (I) or pharmacologically acceptable salts or derivatives thereof:<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a group of the following structures (la), (lb), (Ic), (Id), (le) or<br>

More preferably, the compound is 4-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2-propyl-1-{4-[2-<br>
(tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl]phenyI}methylimidazole-5-carboxylic acid and 2-ethoxy-1-[2'-<br>
(1H-tetra2ol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]rnethyl-1H-benimidazole-7-carboxylic acid, or a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt or derivative thereof.<br>
"Pharmacologically acceptable salts" mean those salts that may be prepared by<br>
reacting the compound of general formula (I) above, boric acids, or ethylenediamine<br>
tetraacetic acids with a base. Examples of such salts include metal salts including<br>

acid salts such as glycine salts, lysine salts, arginine salts, ornithine salts, glutamic<br>
acid salts, aspartic acid salts.etc. Of them, alkali metal salts are preferred, and<br>
sodium salts and potassium salts are more preferred.<br>
Boric acids, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acids, and the compounds of the general<br>
formula (I) above or their pharmacologically acceptable salts may occasionally<br>
absorb water so that the absorbed water is incorporated, ie they become a hydrate,<br><br><br>
by allowing them to stand in the air or during recrystallization. Such hydrates are<br>
included in the present invention.<br>
When the compound (I) has hydroxyl groups and/or carboxyl groups, such a<br>
compound can be converted into its derivatives by modifying those groups. So.<br>

[Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
The intraocular tension lowering composition for topical admtnistration of the<br>
present invention can be prepared in a conventional manner by using one or more<br>
angiotensin II antagonists, one or more boric acids and one or more emylenediamine<br>
tetraacetic acids. For example, the ophthalmic composition can be used in a<br>
formulation suitable for topical administration such as eye drops e.g. aqueous eye<br>
drops, aqueous ophthalmic suspensions, non-aqueous eye drops and non-aqueous<br>
ophthalmic suspensions, gels, ophthalmic ointments, etc. For preparing such<br>
formulations, pharmacologically acceptable carriers may be added to said<br><br><br>
ingredients. No limitation is given to the carriers to be used if they are those<br>
customarily applied to ophthalmic formulations, and they illustratively include inert<br>
diluents, preservatives, isotonic agents, buffering agents, pH regulating agents,<br>
thickeners, surfactants, ointment bases, and the like.<br>
Examples of inert diluents include aqueous solvents such as water, Ringer<br>
solution, isotonic saline, etc. or oily solvents such as castor oil, olive oil, sesame oil,<br>
soybean oil, liquid paraffin, propylene glycol, -octyldodecanol, etc.<br>
Examples of preservatives include parabens such as methylparaben,<br>
ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, etc., benzalkonium chloride,<br>
chlorohexidine, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, sorbic acid and its salts,<br>
thimerosal, chlorobutanol, etc. Parabens, benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium<br>
chloride are preferred,-<br>
Since excellent preservative effects can be attained by using boric acids and<br>
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acids together with parabens, the parabens are most<br>
preferred.<br>
Examples of isotonic agents are sodium chloride, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerin, etc.<br>
Examples of buffering agents are phosphates, acetates, citrates, etc.<br>
Examples of pH regulating agents are hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, sodium<br>
hydroxide, and the like.<br>
Examples of ointment bases are vaseline, plastibase (trade mark), liquid paraffin,<br>
etc.<br>
Examples of thickeners are methyl cellulose, carmelose and its salts, hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose, sodium alginate, carboxy vinyl polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and the like.<br>
Examples of surfactants are polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil, polysorbate, etc.<br>
For preparing a gel, for example, carboxyvinyl polymer, methyl cellulose, sodium<br>
alginate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylene maleic anhydride polymer and the like<br>
can be used.<br>
Concerning the formulation of the topical composition of the present invention, the<br>
lower limit of the angiotensin II antagonist is 0.001% (preferably 0.01%) and the<br>
upper limit is 10% (preferably 5%).<br>
The dose of the composition of the present invention differs, depending upon the<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
A concrete description of the present invention will now be illustrated by the<br>
following Examples and Experiments, but the scope of the present invention is not<br>
limited thereby.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[Example 1] Eye Drops<br>
A hot solution of 6.6 mg of methylparaben and 3.6 mg of propylparaben in 14 ml of<br>
water for injection is cooled down to room temperature, and 0.2 g of boric acid and 1 .<br>
mg of disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate dihydrate were added thereto to give a<br>
solution.<br>
To this solution were added 0.1 g of 4-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2-propyl-1-{4-[2-<br>
(tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl]phenyl}methylimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "Compound A") and 61 mg of sodium chloride, and then about 0.4 ml of a 1 mol/L<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added. The resultant mixture was<br>
adjusted to pH 7.0 with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (concentration: 1<br>
mol/L) and diluted with water for injection up to a total volume of 20 ml.<br>
This solution was aseptically filtered through Membrane Filter (Manufactured by<br>

solution of sodium hydroxide (concentration: 1 mol/L) and mixed with water for<br>
injection up to a total volume of 20 ml.<br>
This solution was aseptically filtered with GV to give an eye drops formulation.<br>
[Comparative Example 4]<br>
Preparation was carried out in the same manner as described in Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 3, except that Compound B was used in place of Compound A. Thus,<br>
the following eye drops formulations a, b and c were prepared.<br><br>
("EDTA-2Na" represents disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate dihydrate. in<br>
addition to the description above, appropriate amounts of sodium hydroxide and<br>
hydrochloric acid were added for adjusting to pH 7.0.)<br>
[Experiment]<br>
The effects of the present invention are illustrated by the following experiment.<br>
[Test Example 1] Intraocular Tension Lowering Test<br>
A model of raised intraocular tension was prepared by using New Zealand white<br>
rabbits weighing 2 to 3 kg according to the method of Kurihara et al. (Ophthalmic<br>
Pharmacology. Vol. 4, 62-64, 1990), and the intraocular tension lowering activity of<br>
the test compositions was examined. That is, rabbits were totally paralyzed with<br>
urethane, and the intraocular tension was measured with Alcon Applanation<br>
Pneumotonography.<br>
The rabbit's eye was treated with a topical anesthetic, and 0.1 mi of a 5% aqueous<br>
solution of sodium chloride was injected into the glass body through a 30 gauge<br>
injection needle. Half an hour after the injection, elevation of intraocular tension was<br>
confirmed, and 50 µl of a test composition was dropped. (As a control, a<br>
physiological saline solution was dropped.)<br><br><br>
After dropping, the intraocular tension was measured every 30 minutes. The<br>
lowering of intraocular tension (mmHg) was calculated from the intraocular tension of<br>
the group in which the test composition was dropped and that of the group in which<br>
the control composition was dropped.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1-1 and Table 1-2. (Note: the formulation of each<br>
composition used for the experiment is shown in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2,<br>
respectively.)<br><br><br><br><br>
(In the above tables, "MP" represents methylparaben, "PP" represents<br>
propylparaben, and "EDTA-2Na" represents disodium ethytenediamine tetraacetate<br>
dihydrate. In addition to the description above, appropriate amounts of sodium<br>
hydroxide and hydrochloric acid were added for adjusting to pH 7.0.)<br>
It was found from the results of Compositions 2 to 4 and Compositions 6 to 8 that<br>
there was hardly an influence on the intraocular tension lowering degree when boric<br>
acids alone or ethytenediamine tetraacetic acids alone were used in combination with<br>
angiotensin II antagonists.<br>
In contrast to these results, Composition 1 containing boric acids and<br>
ethytenediamine tetraacetic acids together showed marked intraocular tension<br>
lowering activity compared with Compositions 2 to 4. Similarly, Composition 5<br>
showed marked intraocular tension lowering activity compared with Compositions 6<br>
to 8. Thus, the intraocular tension lowering activity of angiotensin II antagonists was<br>
markedly increased by adding a combination of boric acids and ethytenediamine<br>
tetraacetic acids, as shown by the results of Table 1-1 and Table 2-2.<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
The intraocular tension lowering composition for topical administration of the<br>
present invention shows excellent intraocular tension lowering activity with weak side<br>
effects and can lower effectively the intraocular tension raised by glaucoma<br>
(including normal tension glaucoma) and ocular hypertension, etc.<br><br>
