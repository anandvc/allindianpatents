Background of the present Invention<br>
Menopause in women's life is the most critical stage of the life when she undergoes<br>
dramatic physiological changes and is defined as the transition in women from<br>
reproductive to non-reproductive stage of life, which is due to the cessation of<br>
menstruation and occurs at an average age of fifty years. More particularly, the postmenopausal<br>
stage is characterized by the changes in the levels of circulating sex<br>
hormones, the most dramatic of which is the reduction in plasma levels of 17-betaestradiol<br>
to less than ten percent of pre-menopausal values, which results in a number of<br>
chronic disorders and is often referred to as Post Menopausal Syndrome. In view of the<br>
fact that the current life span of women is about eighty years, women spend<br>
approximately one-third of their lives in the post-menopausal state. This means that the<br>
potential for chronic effects of the post-menopausal state on women's health is far greater<br>
today than at the turn of the century when life expectancy was considerably shorter.<br>
Estrogen deficiency is the most important risk factor associated with Post Menopausal<br>
Syndrome. Some of the major effects of the Post Menopausal Syndrome that are source<br>
of greatest long-term medical concern include osteoporosis, bone loss, bone formation,<br>
cardiovascular effects more particularly hyperlipidaemia, thrombosis and vasomotor<br>
disorders, neurodegenerative effects such as stroke, senile dementia-Alzheimer type and<br>
Parkinson disease, menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, urogenital atrophy,<br>
depression, mania, schizophrenia, urinary incontinence, relief of dysmenorrhea; relief of<br>
dysfunctional uterine bleeding, an aid in ovarian development, treatment of acne,<br>
hirsutism.<br>
Osteoporosis can be defined as a reduction in bone mass per unit volume with an<br>
alteration in bone microarchitecture that results in an increased susceptibility to fractures.<br>
It is not surprising that the most common fractures are those associated with bones, which<br>
are highly dependent on trabecular support, for example the vertebrae, the neck, and the<br>
weight bearing bone such as the femur, and the fore arm. Indeed the hip fracture, collies<br>
fractures and vertebrae crush fractures are hallmarks of post-menopausal osteoporosis. In<br>
most cases, bone loss occurs as a result of increased bone destruction (resorption) relative<br>
to bone formation and most women lose from about 20% to 60% of the bone mass in the<br>
trabecular compartment of the bone within 3 to 6 years after the menopause.<br>
Osteoporosis, more particularly the post-menopausal osteoporosis represents a major<br>
problem in women health care and poses a risk to quality of life during old age. Efforts<br>
to reduce this risk factor and incidence of fractures have resulted in the development of<br>
compounds that conserve skeletal mass by inhibiting bone resorption and/or by<br>
enhancing bone formation (Dwivedi I, Ray S, 1995 "Recent developments in the<br>
chemotherapy of osteoporosis" Progress in Drug Research 45, 289-338, Editor E Jucker,<br>
Birkhauser Vela; Marshall DH, Horsmann A, Nordin BEC, 1977, "The prevention and<br>
management of post-menopausal osteoporosis" Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand (Suppl)<br>
65:49-56; Hutchinson TA, Polansky SM, Feinstein AR, 1979, "Postmenopausal estrogen<br>
protect against fractures of hip and distal radius: A care-control study" Lancet 2:705-709.<br>
Estrogen replacement therapy also has positive effect on CVS &amp; CNS related disorders<br>
(Lobo RA, 1990, "Cardiovascular implication of estrogen replacement therapy"<br>
Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 75:185-245; Mendelson ME, Karas RH, 1994, "Estrogen and<br>
the blood vessel wall" Current opinion in Cardiology 1994:619-626; Stampfer MJ,<br>
Colditz GA, 1991, "Estrogen replacement therapy and coronary heart disease: a<br>
quantitative assessment of the epidemiological evidence" Preventive Medicine 20:47-63).<br>
Cardiovascular disease is another leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older<br>
women. Menopause and ageing increase risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery<br>
disease. An altered lipid profile is thought to be associated with this increased risk.<br>
Compared to men, pre-menopausal women are relatively more protected from<br>
cardiovascular diseases. This protection is gradually lost following menopause. This loss<br>
of protection has been linked to the loss of estrogen and in particular to the loss of<br>
estrogen's stationary phase ability to regulate the level of serum lipids. The nature of<br>
estrogens ability to reduce serum lipids is not well understood, but evidences indicate that<br>
estrogen can up-regulate LDL receptors in the liver which act to remove excess<br>
cholesterol.<br>
Additionally, estrogen appears to have some effects on the biosynthesis of cholesterol<br>
and other beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Estrogen is also believed to directly<br>
influence vessel wall compliance, reduce peripheral resistance and prevent<br>
atherosclerosis. It is also reported that serum lipids in post-menopausal women having<br>
estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) return to concentrations found in the premenopausal<br>
state (Gruber CJ, Tschugguel W, Schneeberger C, Huber JC, 2002,<br>
"Production and actions of estrogens" The New England Journal of Medicine 346:340-<br>
352; Bellino FL, Wise PM, 2003 "Nonhuman primate models of menopause workshop"<br>
Biology of Reproduction 68:10-18; Lobo RA 1990, "Cardiovascular implication of<br>
estrogen replacement therapy", Obstetrics and Gynaecology 75:18S-24S; Medelson ME,<br>
Karas RD 1994, "Estrogen and the blood vessel wall", Current opinion in Cardiology,<br>
1994 (9):619-626).<br>
Based on available epidemiological data, the overall impact of these physiological and<br>
pharmacological actions of estrogen is an age independent reduction in cardiovascular<br>
mortality and morbidity in women (Knnel WH, Hjortland M, McNamara PM, 1976<br>
"Menopause and risk of cardiovascular disease: The Framingham Study", Ann Int Med<br>
8:5447-5552). Furthermore, a more recent analysis has concluded that post-menopausal<br>
estrogen replacement therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by approximately<br>
50 percent (Stampfer MJ, Colditz GA, 1991, "Estrogen replacement therapy and coronary<br>
heart disease: a quantitative assessment of the epidemiological evidence", Preventive<br>
Medicine 20:47-63).<br>
There is growing interest in recent years on neuroprotective effects of estrogens for<br>
neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.<br>
Reports of greater brain damage in males than in females and in ovariectomized than<br>
intact female animals in ischemic stroke models ^re available. Estrogen is also known to<br>
increase density of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and increase neuronal sensitivity to<br>
input mediated by these receptors in neurons of hippocampus, the area involved in<br>
memory. The estradiol-depleted state in post-menopausal women has been correlated<br>
with increased incidence of stroke, cognitive defects, hot flashes, mood changes, and<br>
early onset and severity of Alzheimer disease. Some epidemiological data suggests that<br>
in post-menopausal women, estrogen deficiency is associated with decline in cognitive<br>
function and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (Gruber CJ, Tschugguel W,<br>
Schneeberger C, Huber JC, 2002 "Production and actions of estrogens", The New<br>
England Journal of Medicine 346:340-352; Dhandapani KM, Brann DW, 2002,<br>
"Protective effects of estrogen and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators in the brain"<br>
Biology of Reproduction 67:1379-1385).<br>
Short-term studies in human subjects have shown that increased levels of estrogen are<br>
associated with higher memory scores in post-menopausal women (Kampen DL, Sherwin<br>
BB, 1994 "Estrogen use and verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal women",<br>
Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 83:979-983; Ohkura T, Isse K, Akazawa K, Hamanioto M,<br>
Yoshimasa Y, Hagino N, 1995, "Long-term estrogen replacement therapy in female<br>
patients with dementia of the Alzheimer Type: 7 Case reports", Dementia 6:99-107).<br>
Furthermore, the administration of exogenous estrogen to surgically post-menopausal<br>
women specially enhances short-term memory. Moreover, the effects as epidemiological<br>
findings indicate that estrogen treatment significantly decreases the risk of senile<br>
dementia-Alzheimer type in women (Paganini-Hill A, Henderson VW, 1994, "Estrogen<br>
deficiency and risk of Alzheimer's disease in women", Am J Epidemiol 140:256-261;<br>
Ohkura T, Isse K, Akazawa K, Hamamoto M, Yoshimasa Y, Hagino N, 1995, "Longterm<br>
estrogen replacement therapy in female patients with dementia of the Alzheimer<br>
Type: 7 case reports", Dementia 6:99-107).<br>
While the mechanism whereby estrogens enhance cognitive function is unknown, it is<br>
possible to speculate that the direct effects of estrogen on cerebral blood flow (Goldman<br>
H, Skelley Eb, Sandman CA, Kastin AJ, Murphy S, 1976, "Hormones and regional brain<br>
blood flow", Pharnacik Biochem Rev 5 (suppl 1): 165-169; Ohkura T, Teshima Y, Isse K,<br>
Mastuda H, Inoue T, Sakai Y, Iwasaki N, Yaoi Y, 1995, "Estrogen increases cerebral and<br>
cerebellar blood flows in postmenopausal women", Menopause: J North Am Menopause<br>
Soc 2:13-18) and neuronal cell activities (Singh M, Meyer EM, Simpkins JW, 1995, "The<br>
effect of ovariectomy and estradiol replacement on brain-derived neurotrophic factor<br>
messenger ribonucleic acid expression in cortical and hippocampal brain regions of<br>
female Sprague-Dawley rats", Endocrinology 136:2320-2324; McMillan PJ, Singer CA,<br>
Dorsa DM, 1996, "The effects of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement on trkA and<br>
choline acetyltransferase mRNA expression in the basal forebrain of the adult female<br>
Sprague-Dawley rat", Neurosci 16:1860-1865).<br>
Even though the beneficial effects of estrogen replacement on a wide variety of organ<br>
systems and tissues appear indisputable, the dose and duration of estrogen therapy is also<br>
associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The use of<br>
concomitant cyclic progestins does reduce the risk of endometrial pathology, but this is<br>
achieved at the expense of the return of regular uterine bleeding, a result that is<br>
objectionable to many patients. In addition to estrogen's stimulatory effect on the<br>
endometrium, there remains considerable controversy regarding reports of an association<br>
between long-term estrogen replacement and an increased risk of breast cancer<br>
(Bergkvist L, Adami HO, Persson I, Hoover R, Schairer C, 1989, "The risk of breast<br>
cancer after estrogen and estrogen-progestin replacement", N Eng J Med, 321:293-297;<br>
Coiditz GA, Hankinson SE, Hunter DJ, Willett WX, Manson JE, Stampfer MJ,<br>
Hennekens C, Rosner B, Speizer FE, 1995, "The use of estrogens and progestins and the<br>
risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women", N Eng J Med 332:1593). Furthermore,<br>
there are other side effects of estrogen replacements, which, while might not be life<br>
threatening, contraindicate estrogen's use and reduce patient compliance.<br>
Breast cancer is by far the most common malignant disease in women (22% of all new<br>
cancer cases). Concerted efforts are being made worldwide to develop new and safer<br>
drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. Tamoxifen ("Nolvadex'), a selective estrogen<br>
receptor modulator (SERM), is currently the most widely used drug for the treatment of<br>
estrogen receptor positive (ER+ve) breast cancer. Tamoxifen inhibits the estrogendependent<br>
growth of cancer cells by competitive binding to estrogen receptors of the<br>
cells. However, as tamoxifen has also estrogen-like effects, it induces, among other<br>
adverse effects, endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in<br>
women undergoing the therapy. In addition, tamoxifen is known to induce DNA adduct<br>
formation and produced liver tumors in rodent life-term bioassays. Thus there is an<br>
urgent need for developing safer SERMs for the treatment of breast cancer (Baum M,<br>
Odling-Smee W, Houghton J, Riley D, Taylor H, 1994, "Endometrial cancer during<br>
tamoxifen treatment", Lancet 343:1291; demons M, Danson S, Howell A, 2002,<br>
"Tamoxifen ('Nolvadex'): Antitumour treatment. A review", Cancer Treatment Reviews<br>

cancer", Science 137:257-262; Williams GM, Latropoulos,' MJ, Djordjevic MV,<br>

in the rat", Carcinogenesis 14:315-317; Meier CR, Jick H, 1998, "Tamoxifen and risk of<br>
idiopathic venous thromboembolism", Br J Clin Pharmacol 45:608-612).<br>
Egg-implantation in most mammals is dependent on a sequential action of estrogen and<br>
progesterone on the uterus and is considered as a preferential peripheral site for<br>
contraception. Development of hormone antagonists (both antiestrogens and<br>
antiprogestins) which inhibit action of endogenous hormones at the receptor level<br>
resulting in inhibition of implantation is one of the promising approaches for control or<br>
regulation of fertility in humans and other animals. Previous studies have revealed that<br>
administration of estrogen antagonists, recently termed as Selective Estrogen Receptor<br>
Modulators (SERMs), due to their tissue selective action) to cyclic or mated females<br>
prevents implantation.<br>
Studies also reveal their uterine specific action, inhibiting endometrial receptivity to<br>
embryonic signal(s) for decidualisation, without affecting pre-implantation development<br>
of embryos up to the blastocyst stage (Singh MM, 2001, "Centchroman, a selective<br>
estrogen receptor modulator, as contraceptive and in the management of hormone related<br>
clinical disorders", Medicinal Research Reviews 21:302-347; Nityanand S, Chandravati,<br>

Such SERMs have also been successfully used for induction of ovulation in amenorrhic<br>
women under the assisted reproduction programmes (Roy SN, Kumari GL, Modoiya K,<br>
Prakash V, Ray S, 1976, "Induction of ovulation in human with Centchroman, a<br>
preliminary report", Fertility and Sterility 27:1108-1110) and suppression of postpartum<br>
lactation (Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics<br>
(Seventh Edition) Macmillan Publishing Company, 1985, pages 1321-1423).<br>
From the foregoing discussion it would appear that the availability of therapies which<br>
possess the ideal pharmacological profile and could mimic the beneficial actions of<br>
estrogen on the bone, cardiovascular system and central nervous system without the<br>
undesirable side effects on uterus and breast, would essentially provide a "safe estrogen"<br>
which could dramatically influence the number of patients that would be able to benefit<br>
from estrogen replacement therapy. Therefore, in recognition of estrogen's beneficial<br>
effects on a number of body systems and disease conditions, there is a continuing need<br>
for the development of potent estrogen agonists which can selectively target different<br>
body tissues. Accordingly, the present invention provides new compounds,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions thereof and methods of using such<br>
compounds for the prevention or treatment of:<br>
(a) estrogen deficient or deprivation state in a mammal, in particular osteoporosis,<br>
bone loss, bone formation, cardiovascular effects more particularly<br>
hyperlipidaemia, thrombosis and vasomotor system, neurodegenerative effects<br>
such as stroke, senile dementia-Alzheimer type and Parkinson disease,<br>
menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, urogenital atrophy, depression,<br>
mania, schizophrenia and the like, urinary incontinence, relief of dysmenorrhea;<br>
relief of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, an aid in ovarian development, treatment<br>
of acne and hirsutism;<br>
(b) estrogen dependent or estrogen independent cancers such as prostatic carcinoma,<br>
cancer of breast, cancer of uterus, cancer of the cervix and cancer of the colon;<br>
(c) an aid in ovarian development or function;<br>
(d) control or regulation of fertility in humans and in other animals;<br>
(e) prevention of threatened or habitual abortion;<br>
(f) suppression of post-partunrlactation;<br>
(g) physiological disorders such as obesity, depression etc.;<br>
(h) regulation of glucose metabolism in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus<br>

The term "estrogen deficiency or deprivation" is meant to imply the conditions where the<br>
optimal level of estrogen is absent. This level varies from one tissue to another depending<br>
on the function of the tissue. Thus, in some cases, estrogen deficiency or deprivation may<br>
be total absence of estrogen, whereas in other cases, deficiency or deprivation may<br>
involve estrogen levels, which are too low for proper tissue function. In women, the two<br>
most common causes of estrogen deprivation are menopause and ovariectomy, although<br>
other conditions may be causative.<br>

Test procedure for evaluation of antiosteoporosis activity in vivo<br>
The in vivo antiosteoporosis activity is evaluated in colony-bred adult (3-4 month<br>
old) female Sprague-Dawley rats or female retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats (12-14<br>
months old; parity &gt;3). Animals are bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under light ether<br>
anesthesia and treated with the compound of the present invention, 17-alfaethynylestradiol<br>
(EE) or the vehicle once daily on days 1-30 post-ovariectomy (day 1:<br>
day of bilateral ovariectomy) by the oral route. One group of females is sham operated<br>
and treated similarly with the vehicle. Animals of all the groups are autopsied 24 h after<br>
the last treatment. Before autopsy, 24 h fasting urine samples are collected in fresh<br>
containers using all-glass metabolic cages and stored at -20°C until analyzed for calcium,<br>
phosphorus and creatinine. At autopsy, about 5 ml blood samples are collected by<br>
cardiac puncture from each rat under light ether anesthesia and serum is isolated and<br>
stored at -20°C until analyzed for total and bone specific alkaline phosphatase,<br>
osteocalcin and calcium.<br>
Uterus of each rat is carefully excised, gently blotted, weighed and fixed for histology.<br>
Representative sections (5 |Lim) from each uterus are stained with haematoxylin and eosin.<br>
Femur and tibia of each rat are then dissected free of adhering tissue, fixed in 70%<br>
ethanol in physiological saline and stored at -20°C until Bone Mineral Density (BMD)<br>
measurement. Before autopsy, whole body scan of each rat for measurement of BMD is<br>
performed on an Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer, calibrated daily with<br>
Hologic hydroxyapatite anthropomorphic spine phantom using manufacturer provided<br>
software for small animals. BMD measurement of isolated bones is performed using<br>
identical regions of interest. Serum total alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, calcium ion<br>
content and urinary calcium and creatinine are estimated colorimetrically using<br>
commercial kits.<br>
Test procedure for evaluation of anti-hyperlipidaemic activity<br>
The in vivo anti-hyperlipidaemic activity is evaluated in colony-bred adult (3-4 month<br>
old) female Sprague-Dawley rats or female retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats (12-14<br>
months old; parity &gt;3). Animals are bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) under light ether<br>
anesthesia and treated with the compound of the present invention, 17-alfaethynylestradiol<br>
(EE) or the vehicle once daily on days 1-30 post-ovariectomy (day 1:<br>
day of bilateral ovariectomy) by the oral route. One group of females is sham operated<br>
and treated similarly with the vehicle. Animals of all the groups are autopsied 24 h after<br>
the last treatment. At autopsy, about 5 ml blood samples are collected by cardiac<br>
puncture from each rat under light ether anesthesia and serum is isolated and stored at 20°C until analyzed for total cholesterol. The total cholesterol concentration is measured<br>
by a timed-end point method using a Beckman Synchron CX autoanalyser. In the<br>
reaction, cholesterol estrase hydrolyses cholesterol esters to free cholesterol and fatty<br>
acids. Free cholesterol is oxidized to cholestene-3-one and FbC^ by cholesterol oxidase.<br>

Test procedure for evaluation of anti-cancer breast activity in vivo.<br>
Compound(s) of invention identified on the basis of the above test are evaluated in vivo<br>
for anticancer breast activity using the well established and widely used rodent model of<br>
hormone responsive breast cancer namely, 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA)<br>
induced rat mammary tumor model. Healthy female Sprague-Dawley rats (50-60 days of<br>
age) are given a single oral administration of DMBA (180 mg/kg) and the mammary<br>
tumor development is monitored by weekly palpation of the mammary tracks. Body<br>
weight of the animals is recorded weekly. All animals are used and handled adhering to<br>
the Animal Ethics Committee guidelines for humane treatment of animals. The animals<br>
have free access to standard rodent pellet diet and safe drinking water and are housed in<br>
temperature and photoperiod-controlled animal quarters throughout the experimental<br>
period. When palpable mammary tumors develop and reach approximately 0.5 cm in<br>
diameter, the tumor bearing rats are grouped and receive oral administration of the test<br>
compound at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 4 weeks. Tumor incidence,<br>
number and area/volume are recorded at the commencement of the treatment and at<br>
weekly intervals. The diameter of tumors is measured using calipers and the tumor<br>
volume is derived using the formula for sphere volume. The compound is considered<br>
active against mammary tumor if, by the end of treatment period, the tumor volume<br>
decreases by more than 25% or remains static or when the volume shows less than 25%<br>
increase over the pre-treatment volume.<br>
Test procedure for evaluation of post-coital antifertilitv activity<br>
Adult female rats are caged overnight with coeval males of proven fertility and their<br>
vaginal smears are checked on the following morning. The day of presence of<br>
spermatozoa in the vaginal smear is taken as day 1 of pregnancy. Mated rats are isolated<br>
and randomized into various treatment groups and treated orally with the compound of<br>
invention or the vehicle on days 1-7/1-5 post-coitum. Animals of all the groups are<br>
autopsied on day 10 post-coitum and number and status of corpora lutea and implantation<br>
sites in each rat are recorded. The compounds of the present invention are considered<br>
active if there is complete absence of implantations in the uterus of all rats, in comparison<br>
to presence of normal implantations in the uterus of rats of vehicle control group.<br>

Test procedure for evaluation of estrogen agonistic activity<br>
Twenty-one-day-old immature female rats are bilaterally ovariectomized under light<br>
ether anaesthesia and, after post-operative rest for 7 days, are randomized into different<br>
treatment groups. Each rat receives the compound of the invention once daily for 3<br>
consecutive days on days 28-30 of age. A separate group of animals receiving only the<br>
vehicle for similar duration serves as control. At autopsy 24 h after the last treatment on<br>
day 31 of age, vaginal smear of each rat is taken and uterus is carefully excised, gently<br>
blotted, weighed and fixed for histology and histomorphometry using image analysis.<br>
Premature opening of vagina, cornification of vaginal epithelium, increase in uterine<br>
fresh weight, total uterine and endometrial area and uterine luminal epithelial cell height<br>
are taken as parameters for evaluation of estrogen agonistic activity in comparison to rats<br>
of vehicle control group.<br>

For image analysis in estrogen agonistic activity evaluation studies, paraffin sections (6<br>
um thick) of the uterus stained with haematoxylin and eosin were analysed<br>
microscopically. To determine changes in uterine tissue components, areas of whole<br>
uterus and endometrium and the thickness of uterine epithelium were measured using a<br>
computer-image analysis system (BioVis, Expert Vision, India). Briefly, microscopic<br>
images of uterus acquired through a CCD camera were loaded in to the image analysis<br>
program and spatially calibrated against a stage micrometer image taken at the same<br>
magnification. Using thresholding and line tools, the regions for measurements were<br>
selected and the area (mm2) of whole uterine transection excluding the luminal space, the<br>
area (mm2) of the endometrium only, and the thickness (um) of luminal epithelial lining<br>
were measured. Luminal epithelial thickness data was the Average of measurements<br>
made at 6 randomly selected sites are taken as parameters for evaluation.<br>

Test procedure for evaluation of relative binding affinity (RBA) to estrogen<br>
receptors<br>
The relative binding affinity (RBA) of the compounds for estrogen receptor was<br>
determined by competition assay, employing 3H-estradiol (3H-E2) as the radioligand. The<br>
test ligands and 3H-E2 were incubated at 4°C with cytosol estrogen receptors obtained<br>
from uteri of immature estradiol-primed (1 ug/rat 24 h before autopsy) 20-21 days old<br>
rats. Aliquot of uterine cytosol (200 ul; 2 uteri per ml) prepared in TEA buffer (10 mM<br>
Tris, 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) were incubated in duplicate with a<br>
fixed concentration of 3H-E2 in the absence or presence of various concentrations of the<br>
competitor substance dissolved in 30 ul of the TEA buffer containing DMF as co-solvent<br>
(final concentration of DMF in the incubation mixture never exceeded 5%) for 18 hrs at<br>
4°C. At the end of this period, dextran coated charcoal (5% Norit 0.5% dextran)<br>
suspension in 100 ul of TEA buffer was added to each tube, which were briefly vortexed<br>
and allowed to stand for 15 minutes at 4°C. The mixture was centrifuged at 800 g for 10<br>
minutes and the supernatants counted for radioactivity in 10 ml of a dioxane-based<br>
scintillation fluid. RBA of the text compound was computed from a graph plotted<br>
between percent bound radioactivity verses log concentration of the test substance. At<br>
50% inhibition, log of the competitor concentration relative to that of 17-beta-estradiol,<br>
gave the affinity of the test compound to estrogen receptor relative to estradiol. This<br>
when multiplied with 100 gave the percentage value designated as RBA.<br>
