Specification<br>
LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition, and more specifically to a lubricating oil composition having a high static friction coefficient of wet clutch, having excellent frictional property in a power transmission mechanism, having excellent fuel saving property, and suitably used for power transmission lubricating oil and engine lubricating oil.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
Engine lubricating oil to be used for a two-wheeled vehicle four-cycle engine differs from four-wheeled vehicle four-cycle engine lubricating oil, and must satisfy properties required for lubrication of both of an engine and a power transmission device, such as a transmission.<br>
For many systems such as two-wheeled vehicles and the like having wet clutch and employing the same oil for engine lubricating oil and power transmission lubricating oil for lubrication, four-wheeled vehicle four-cycle engine lubricating oil is desirably not used as it is. Many improvement studies regarding an engine lubricating oil composition appropriate for a two-wheeled vehicle<br><br>
four-cycle engine are conducted (see Patent Documents 1 and 2, for example).<br>
Vehicle engine lubricating oil must have various properties<br>
such as: (1) good detergency; (2) excellent anti - wear property;<br>
(3) excellent heat/oxidation stability; (4) small oil consumption; and (5) small engine frictional loss (excellent fuel savingproperty) . In particular, a two-wheeled vehicle has higher engine revolution and higher power with respect to the displacement in normal use compared with those of a four-wheeled vehicle . Further, two-wheeled vehicle engine lubricating oil differs from four-wheeled vehicle engine lubricating oil and is used for lubrication of both of an engine and a power transmission device such as a transmission. Thus , the two-wheeled vehicle engine lubricating oil has an increased oil temperature and must have higher high-temperature detergency compared with that of four-wheeled vehicle engine lubricating oil.<br>
[0003]<br>
Further, considering the recent environmental issues, in particular, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, vehicle fuel saving has become an important issue. For vehicle fuel saving, engine lubricating oil requires a fuel saving technique to be applied. For improvement in fuel saving property of a power transmission device such as a transmission, improvement in a power transmission rate and reduction in size and weight are required. From the viewpoints of securing clutch capacity and reduction in weight of<br><br>
the clutch, a friction coefficient between a clutch disc arid a clutch plate is required to increase. Thus, the two-wheeled vehicle four-cycle engine lubricating oil is desired to have properties required for engine system lubricating oil, and the power transmission device is desired to have further improved frictional property (high static friction coefficient) of wet clutch.

An example of molybdenum dithiocarbamate (MoDTC) may be sulfurized oxymolybdenum dithiocarbamate representedby the general<br><br>
formula (I) : [0016]<br><br>
wherein: R1 and R2 each represent a hydrocarbon group having 4 to 24 carbon atoms; x and y each represent a number of 1 to 3; and a sum of X and y is 4.<br>
Examples of the hydrocarbon group having 4 to 24 carbon atoms include an alkyl group having 4 to 24 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 4 to 24 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 24 carbon atoms, and an arylalkyl group having 7 to 24 carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon group having 4 or more carbon atoms provides favorable solubility in base oil, and a hydrocarbon group having 24 or less carbon atoms provides a favorable effect and is easily available. R and R mentioned above may be identical to or different from each other.<br>

[0018]<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, one kind of organic molybdenum compound may be used alone as the component (A) , or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The organic molybdenum compound as the component (A) is used in a Mo content within a range of 1 00 to 1 ,000 mass ppm. A Mo content of 100 mass ppm or more provides a fuel saving effect, and an Mo content of 1,000 mass ppm or less provides a favorable friction coefficient against a clutch material. The molybdenum compound is used in an Mo content of preferably 200 to 700 mass ppm, and more preferably 400 to 600 mass ppm.<br>
An excessively high content of the molybdenum amine salt degrades fuel saving property, and an excessively high content of molybdenum dithiocarbamate (MoDTC) reduces a friction coefficient<br><br>
against a clutch material. Thus, in the present invention, in view of attaining both fuel saving property and power transmission performance, a mass ratio (MoA/MoD) of an Mo content (MoA) derived from the molybdenum amine salt to an Mo content (MoD) derived from molybdenum dithiocarbamate is preferably 3 or less .

[0020]<br><br>
[0021]<br>
wherein, R^ and R^ each independently represent a primary or secondary alkyl group having 3 to 22 carbon atoms or an alkylaryl group substituted by an alkyl group having 3 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Here, examples of the primary or secondary alkyl group having 3 to 2 2 carbon atoms include a primary or secondary propyl group, butyl group, pentyl group, hexyl group, octyl group, decyl group,<br><br>
dodecyl group, tetradecyl group, hexadecyl group, octadecyl group, and icosyl group. Furthermore, examples of the alkylaryl group substituted by an alkyl group having 3 to 18 carbon atoms include a propylphenyl group, pentylphenyl group, octylphenyl group, nonylphenyl group, and dodecylphenyl group.<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate represented by the general formula (II) may be used alone as the component (B) , or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. In particular, a lubricating oil composition containing, as a main component, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate having a secondary alkyl group is preferably used<br>
in view of enhancing anti-wear property. [0022]<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZnDTP) as the component (B) is used in a P content within a range of 0.03 to 0.20 mass%.  A P content<br>
of 0.03 mass% or more provides favorable anti - wear property and easily develops fuel saving property due to the organic molybdenum compound as the component (A), and a P content of 0.20 mass% or less can suppress catalyst poisoning of an exhaust gas catalyst. Zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZnDTP) is used in a P content of preferably 0.05 to 0.15 mass%, and more preferably 0.07 to 0.12<br>
mass%.<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention,<br><br>
a mass ratio (P/Mo) of the P content to the Mo content is 1.5 or more, preferably 1.8 or more, and more preferably 2.0 to 5.0. A P/Mo of 1.5 or more can sufficiently realize fuel saving property.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, at least one compound selected from calcium sulfonate, calcium phenate, and magnesium sulfonate and having a base number obtained through a perchloric acid method of 230 mgKOH/g or more is used as a metal-based detergent as a component (C).<br>
With a metal-based detergent having a base number of less than 230 mgKOH/g, the object of the present invention is not sufficiently attained. The base number is preferably 250 mgKOH/g or more, and particularly preferably 300 to 500 mgKOH/g. As overbased calcium sulfonate or magnesium sulfonate like this, alkylbenzene sulfonate having a basic number of 230 mgKOH/g or more and having an alkyl group having 1 to 50 carbon atoms is preferably used. As overbased calcium phenate, alkyl phenate having a basic number of 230 mgKOH/g or more and having an alkyl group having 1 to 50 carbon atoms is preferably used.<br>
[0024]<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, one kind of the metal-based detergent may be used alone as the component (C) , or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The metal-based detergent as the component (C) is used in a Ca and/or<br><br>
Mg content within a range of 0.15 to 0.30 mass%. A Ca and/or Mg content of 0.15 Mass% or more provides favorable power transmission capability, and a Ca and/or Mg content of 0. 30 mass% or less provides favorable fuel saving property. The Ca and/or Mg content is preferably 0.18 to 0.28 mass%.<br>
A mass ratio (CaMg/Mo) of a total content of the Ca and Mg derived from the component (C) to the Mo content must be 3 or more. The mass ratio (CaMg/Mo) of 3 or more provides favorable power transmission capability. The mass ratio (CaMg/Mo) is preferably 4 or more, and particularly preferably within a range of 5 to 10. [0025]<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, an ashless dispersant containing boron, or a mixture of an ashless dispersant containing boron and an ashless dispersant containing no boron is used as a component (D) - Various examples of the ashless dispersant containing boron are present, and examples thereof that can be used include: [1] an ashless dispersant containing boron prepared by treating alkyl or alkenyl succinimide with a boron compound; [2] an ashless dispersant containing boron prepared by treating fatty acid amide with a boron compound; and [3] an ashless dispersant containing boron prepared by treating alkyl or alkenyl benzylamine with a boron compound.<br>
Alkenyl or alkyl succinimide used for the above item [ 1 ] refers to succinimide having an alkenyl group or an alkyl group having<br><br>
a molecular weight of about 200 to 4,000, and preferably 500 to 3,000. Typical examples of the alkenyl group or the alkyl group include a polybutenyl group and a polyisobutenyl group. The polybutenyl group used herein is prepared by polymerizing a mixture of 1-butene and isobutene or high-purity isobutene, or by hydrogenating a polyisobutenyl group. [0026]<br>
A method of producing polybutenyl succinimide may employ an arbitrary conventional method- For example, polybutenyl succinimide may be obtained by: reacting polybutene or chlorinated polybutene each having a molecular weight of about 200 to 4,000 with maleic anhydride at about 100 to 200°C; and reacting the thus-obtained polybutenyl succinimide with polyamine,<br>
Examples of polyamine include diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, and pentaethylene hexamine.<br>
Next, a method of producing succinimide containing boron may employ a conventional method- For example, succinimide containing boron may be obtained by: adding polyamine mentioned above, polybutenyl succinic acid (anhydride), and a boron compound such as boric acid to an organic solvent such as alcohols, hexane, or xylene; and heating the whole under appropriate conditions.<br>
Alkenyl or alkyl succinimidemaypreferably employ alkyl phenol or a sulfurized alkyl phenol derivative each prepared through Mannich<br><br>
condensation of alkenyl or alkyl succinimide and an aromatic compound such as alkyl phenol or sulfurized alkyl phenol. Alkyl phenol to be used has an alkyl group generally having 3 to 30 carbon atoms. [0027]<br>
Fatty acid amide used for the above item [2] is obtained from a fatty acid and polyamine, and a saturated or unsaturated straight-chain or branched carboxylic acid having 8 to 24 carbon atoms is preferably used as the fatty acid. The same polyamine as that used for the above item [1 ] is used-<br>
The same alkenyl or alkyl group as that used for the above item [1 ] is used for alkenyl or alkyl benzylamine used for the above item [3] . Examples of the boron compound to be used for the above items [1] to [3] include boric acid, boric anhydride, halogenated boron, borate ester, boramide, and boron oxide. Of those, boric acid is particularly preferred.<br>
Of the ashless dispersant containing boron, succinimide containing boron prepared by treating alkenyl or alkyl succinimide with a boron compound is particularly preferred.<br>
Meanwhile, examples of the ashless dispersant containing no boron that may be used include the above-mentioned alkyl or alkenyl succinimide, fatty acid amide, and alkyl or alkenyl benzylamine.<br>
In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, a mixture of at least one ashless dispersant containing boron and at least one ashless dispersant containing no boron may be used<br><br>
as the component (D) , [0028]<br>
Zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZnDTP) and an ashless dispersant such as polybutenyl succinimide to be mixed into the lubricating oil composition each have a function of increasing a friction coefficient between a clutch disc and a clutch plate. However, in the case where both additive are mixed and used such as in an engine oil composition, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate interacts with a basic amine site of the ashless dispersant, and thus an effect of increasing a friction coefficient between a clutch disc and a clutch plate is lost.<br>
Thus, the inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies, and have found that modification of the ashless dispersant with a boron compound protects a basic amine site with the boron compound and reduces interaction with zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate, to thereby develop a function of increasing a friction coefficient between a clutch disc and a clutch plate.<br>
In the present invention, in order to develop such a function effectively, a mass ratio (B/N) between B and N derived from the component (D) must be 0.5 or more, preferably 0.5 or more, and more preferably 0.6 to 1 - 2, [0029]<br>
Further, in order to develop such a function effectively, the component (D) in the lubricating oil composition of the present<br><br>
invention must be used in a B' content of 0.03 mass% or more and an N content of 0.05 mass% or more. An upper limit for the B content is not particularly limited, but is about 0•2 mass% in view of storage stability.  The B content is preferably 0.04 to 0.1 mass%.<br>
Meanwhile, the N content is preferred to be small in order to increase a friction coefficient, but if the N content is less than 0 . 05 mass% then the detergency significantly degrades. An upper limit for the N content is not particularly limited, but is about 0.2 mass% for providing favorable demulsifying property. [0030]<br>
The lubricating oil composition of the present invention may mix other additives as required within a range not inhibiting the object of the present invention.<br>
Examples of the other additives include: a metal-based detergent excluding the component (C); a hindered phenol-based, amine-based, phosphate-based, etc. antioxidant; an anti-wear agent or extreme pressure agent excluding the component (A) and the component (B) such as a sulfur-based (such as sulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, or thiophosphinates), halogen-based (such as chlorinated hydrocarbon), or organic metal-based anti-wear agent or extreme pressure agent; a viscosity index improver or pour point depressant such as polymethacrylate, an olefin copolymer, or polybutene; and a rust inhibitor, a corrosion inhibitor, and an antifoaming agent.<br>
The lubricating oil compositionof the present inventionhaving<br><br>
such a composition has a high static friction coefficient of wet clutch, has excellent frictional property in a power transmission mechanism, has excellent fuel saving property, and is suitably used for both power transmission lubricating oil and engine lubricating oil of two-wheeled vehicle, for example-Examples [0031]<br>
Next, the present inventionwillbedescribedmore specifically by way of examples, but the present invention is not limited to the examples in any way.<br>
Note that evaluation of a lubricating oil composition was performed following the method described below. <friction property test><br>
A friction coefficient of sample oil was measured under the following conditions by using an oscillation dynamic friction testing machine (SRV) ["SRVIII", available from Optimol Instruments Pruftechnik GmbH] , and fuel saving property was evaluated.<br>
(1)	Test piece: (a) disc SUJ2 material, (b) cylinder SUJ2 material<br>
(2)	Amplitude: 1.5 mm<br>
(3)	Frequency: 50 Hz<br>
(4)	Load: 400 N<br>
(5)	Temperature: 80°C<br><clutch frictional property><br>
Performance classification of clutch frictional property is<br><br>
defined in JASO two-wheeled four-cycle engine oil standards (JASO T903-98).<br>
A test was performed in accordance with JASO T904-98, which is a clutch f rictional property testingmethod, and a dynamic friction index (DFI), a static friction index (SFI), and stop time index<br>
(STI) were calculated. A sample having the respective indices of 1,45 or more, 1.15 or more, and 1.55 or more is classified as MA performance having a high friction coefficient of clutch and excellent power transmission capability.<br>
