				<td>ADAPTIVE BEARER CONFIGURATION FOR BROADCAST/MULTICAST<br>
SERVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to communication networks providing<br>
multimedia broadcast multicast service, and more particularly to methods and<br>
apparatus for providing and receiving multimedia broadcast multicast services within<br>
a communication network coverage area.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] The localized multicast approach reduces expended network resources by<br>
limiting transmissions to a geographic area defined by the radio coverage area of a<br>
base transceiver station or even smaller areas as defined by antenna coverage sectors<br>
of the base transceiver station. Multicast services in general are described in various<br>
standards such as the Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP), Universal Mobile<br>
Telephone System (UMTS) standards.<br>
[0003] Localized multicast is likewise generally described in the UMTS standards.<br>
The UMTS standards, Release 6, define a counting procedure for Multimedia<br>
Broadcast, Multicast Service (MBMS) whereby the network learns the status of<br>
mobile devices in each cell and configures Radio Bearers (RBs) based upon the<br>
learned status information.<br>
[0004] Two modes of operation are employed in the standards, namely, Point-to-Point<br>
(PTP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PTM). Under counting procedures, coverage areas<br>
having less than a preset number of users, employ PTP operation which requires setup<br>
of RBs individually per user. Conversely, coverage areas having at least the preset<br>
number of users will employ PTM for MBMS delivery wherein individual RBs are<br>
not required.<br>
[0005] These known procedures for MBMS delivery, more specifically, the<br>
procedures for selecting/switching between PTP and PTM modes have several<br>
disadvantages. First, employing and switching between two transmission modes<br><br>
complicates network procedures such as, but not limited to, Radio Link Control<br>
(RLC) buffer management, RB switching, etc.<br>
[0006] Second, using PIT fails to take advantage of the performance gain that may be<br>
achieved through using macro-diversity with PTM.<br>
[0007] Third, PTP/PTM switching requires a certain degree of counting accuracy<br>
which can cause undesired network loading on both the uplink access channel and the<br>
Radio Network Controller (RNC).<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015] Methods and apparatuses for providing adaptive bearer configuration for<br>
MBMS delivery are provided herein.<br>
[0016] A first aspect of the present disclosure is a method of operating a wireless<br>
infrastructure entity wherein a common radio resource is allocated for receiving a<br>
response from at least one mobile station. A request message, similar to a request for<br>
counting, is broadcast to all mobile stations within a coverage area. If at least one<br>
mobile station responds to the request, PTM transmission mode will be used for<br>
MBMS delivery within the given coverage area. If more than one mobile station<br>
within the coverage area responds to the request, then in accordance with an<br>
embodiment, the responses will be over the common radio resource. The total<br>
number of responses to the request message may be limited, in some embodiments, by<br>
providing a probability factor within the request message.<br>
[0017] Further in accordance with the first aspect, the broadcast request message may<br>
also include a specified signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) range. In a<br>
corresponding embodiment, mobile stations having the specified SINR will respond<br>
to the broadcast request, provided that such mobile stations also meet any other<br>
specified parameter requirements.<br>
[0018] A second aspect of the present disclosure, involves determining a modulation<br>
and coding scheme to employ for PTM mode and using the modulation and coding<br>
scheme to transmit the MBMS data to mobiles.<br>
[0019] A third aspect of the present disclosure is a base station, which may be for<br>
example an Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) Edge Node<br>
(EN), within an Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).<br>
In an embodiment, a base station has a transceiver and controller configured to<br>
allocate a common frequency and time based resource for receiving multiple<br>
responses to broadcast request messages. The base station determines whether at least<br><br>
one mobile station is within a coverage area of the transceiver and if so, transmits in<br>
PTM mode.<br>
[0020] The multiple responses from mobile stations responding to the broadcast<br>
request are received in a combined manner in accordance with some embodiments.<br>
[0021] Further in some embodiments related to the third aspect of the present<br>
disclosure, the base station may select a modulation and coding scheme for<br>
transmitting in PTM mode based upon at least one mobile station response to the<br>
broadcast request message.<br>
[0022] A fourth aspect of the present disclosure is a mobile station which may in<br>
some embodiments be a UMTS User Equipment (UE) or an E-UTRA UE. The<br>
mobile station comprises a transceiver and a controller which may utilize various<br>
modulation and coding schemes for transmitting and receiving. The mobile station<br>
measures STNR values for received signals and may indicate this information back to<br>
a base station in some embodiments. Alternatively, the mobile station may<br>
independently use the measured SINR value or values to select an appropriate<br>
modulation and coding scheme for receiving PTM transmission, and indicate the<br>
desired scheme to the base station. In one embodiment, this indication by the mobile<br>
may be implied by the selection of one of a plurality of common radio resources over<br>
which the mobile stations may respond to the request message broadcast by the<br>
network.<br>
[0023] Turning now to the drawings wherein like numerals represent like<br>
components, FIG. 1 illustrates a communications network 100, with various base<br>
stations 103, each base station 103 having a corresponding coverage area 105. In<br>
general, base station coverage areas may overlap and, in general, form an overall<br>
network coverage area. An MBMS coverage area may comprise a number of base<br>
station coverage areas 105, which may form a contiguous radio coverage area.<br>
However, it is not required to have contiguous MBMS coverage and therefore the<br>
MBMS coverage area may alternatively be distributed throughout an overall network<br><br>
coverage area. Furthermore, each coverage area may have a number of mobile<br>
stations or UEs 109. A number of bases stations 103 will be connected to abase<br>
station controller 101 via backhaul connections 107. The base station controller and<br>
base stations form a Radio Access Network (RAN). The overall network may<br>
comprise any number of base station controllers, each controlling a number of base<br>
stations. Note that the base station controller 101 may alternatively be implemented<br>
as a distributed function among the base stations.<br>
[0024] The base stations 103 may communicate with the mobile stations 109 via any<br>
number of standard air interfaces and using any number of modulation and coding<br>
schemes. For example, E-UMTS or CDMA2000 may be employed. Further, E-<br>
UMTS may employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and<br>
CDMA2000 may employ orthogonal spreading codes such as the Walsh codes. Semi-<br>
orthogonal spreading codes may also be utilized to achieve additional channelization<br>
over the air interface.<br>
[0025] FIG. 2 represents the coverage areas 105 of FIG. 1 in a simplified manner as<br>
hexagonal areas. Each hexagonal area corresponds to a base station or Edge Node<br>
(EN) coverage area, and is alternatively referred to as a cell, such as cells 203, 205<br>
and 207. Also, the network 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 will have a number of base<br>
station controllers such as base station controller 201 which may be connected to any<br>
number of cells.<br>
[0026] Typically, a base station controller will control a number of cells over a<br>
contiguous radio coverage area although such a schema is not required. Returning to<br>
FIG. 2, each cell may have a number of mobile devices within, for example cell 203<br>
has 1 mobile device, cell 207 has 9 mobile devices, and cell 205 has none.<br>
[0027] In FIG. 2, assuming that the number of mobile stations shown indicated in<br>
some cells arc configured to receive an MBMS service ("subscribed to MBMS"), then<br>
each mobile station will receive the MBMS data via PTM from its respective cell over<br><br>
a PTM Radio Bearer (RB). The cells that have no mobile devices subscribed to<br>
MBMS, for example cell 205, may not establish a PTM RB.<br>
[0028] It is to be understood that cells that do not have mobile stations subscribed to<br>
MBMS may still have mobile stations present although such mobile stations are not<br>
indicated in FIG. 2. Further, the cells shown in FIG. 2 are idealized. Radio coverage<br>
areas are more realistically represented by FIG. 1 which shows that radio coverage<br>
areas or cells 105 may overlap. Therefore, mobile stations are capable of<br>
communicating with several cells having overlapping areas. However, the idealized<br>
cell areas of FIG. 2 illustrates the concept of using the "best server," that is, the cell<br>
providing the mobile station with the best coverage at that particular time. The best<br>
server may be determined by any number of parameters such as signal-to-noise-and-<br>
interference ratio (SINR), bit error rate (BER), frame erasure rate (FER), or any other<br>
indicator, combination of indicators, or an indicator output from an algorithm using<br>
any one or more of the indicators as an input, all being understood by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
[0029] Therefore, returning to FIG. 2, a mobile station 209 may leave a cell having a<br>
PTM RB and move to a cell 211 which previously did not have a PTM RB<br>
established. In this case, the mobile station 209 may initiate PTM setup on the new<br>
best server cell 211.<br>
[0030] FIG. 3 is a time scale diagram showing the common resource allocated for<br>
receiving responses from mobile stations within a cell. The horizontal axis 301 is a<br>
scale of increasing time with time duration 303 being a time duration on the reverse<br>
link, or uplink which is the communication path from a mobile station to a base<br>
station. A number of resources may be allocated for receiving responses for various<br>
purposes such as improving reliability of reception. Additionally, specific resources<br>
may be allocated for receiving specific indication information from mobile stations<br>
responding via the particular specific resource. For example, mobile stations may<br>
indicate their respective SINR values, or portion of a specified SINR range, by<br>
responding via a particular resource.<br><br>
[0031] In an embodiment, a "0-1" counting is applied. More specifically, the base<br>
station need not differentiate between users. The base station only needs to determine<br>
whether any mobile stations are within the cell that are subscribed to MBMS and, in<br>
some embodiments also whether the mobile stations have not previously received the<br>
offered MBMS transmission. For example, a counting request from the base station<br>
may comprise a service identifier corresponding to the particular provider MBMS,<br>
and also a session identifier wherein multiple sessions may be available. If a mobile<br>
station is subscribed to MBMS as determined by the service identifier, but has not<br>
received the current session as determined by the session identifier, the mobile station<br>
may indicate that it wants to receive the offered session. Therefore, returning to FIG.<br>
3, the base station allocated a frequency and time based resource 303, for example one<br>
or multiple OFDM sub-carrier symbol durations. The base station thereafter,<br>
transmitted a broadcast message requesting a counting of mobile stations that want to<br>
receive the MBMS transmission.<br>
[0032] As illustrated in FIG. 3, a number of mobile stations, from user one 305,<br>
through an nth user 309 may respond during the symbol duration. In accordance with<br>
some embodiments, the mobile stations employ an ON/OFF keying scheme and<br>
transmit the same symbol over the same resource 303. The base station, in<br>
accordance with some embodiments, will receive the responses as a combination of<br>
identical symbols from the mobile stations joining in the response.<br>
[0033] If the base station receives the symbol over the allocated resource 303 during<br>
the allocated time duration the base station may decide that PTM transmission is<br>
required. Otherwise, if no symbol is detected by the base station, no PTM RB is<br>
established in that particular cell.<br>
[0034] One potential difficulty can arise due to difficult radio propagation conditions<br>
such as flat Rayleigh fading in the radio environment of any particular cell. That is,<br>
when the number of mobile stations responding is very small, reception performance<br>
may be very poor such that the base station cannot detect the symbol. Therefore, in<br><br>
some embodiments, repetition is employed to provide diversity and may be<br>
accomplished in both the frequency domain and the time domain.<br>
[0035] For example, in a system utilizing OFDM, two sub-carriers and two symbol<br>
durations may be allocated such that four repetitions of the symbols transmitted from<br>
the mobile stations will occur. Significant diversity gain as well as power gain may<br>
be achieved by employing such simple repetition as in accordance with some<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0036] Another potential difficulty may arise when the number of mobile stations<br>
responding is very large, for example 1000 or greater. In this case, interference with<br>
other nearby cells may occur. Therefore, in some embodiments, a multi-step counting<br>
procedure is employed with a Quick Indication (QI). This solution is illustrated by<br>
FTG. 4. FTG. 4 is a time scale diagram showing messages on the forward link<br>
(downlink) 401 and on the reverse link (uplink) 403.<br>
[0037] After a base station indicates a counting has started, by for example,<br>
broadcasting a request message, a default initial probability "P" is used to regulate the<br>
number of mobile stations responding to the request.<br>
[0038] Therefore, if 1000 mobile stations would have responded, and P = 0.01, then<br>
the average number of mobile stations transmitting counting responses would be 10 as<br>
a result of the probability test. If the base station does not detect a response, another<br>
request message may be broadcast with a higher probability factor. For example, if<br>
initially P = 0.01, then the next counting request will indicate P = 0.1. Alternatively,<br>
the mobile station will monitor for additional counting requests. If another request is<br>
received, the mobile stations will update P by a factor of 10 and repeat the probability<br>
test prior to responding.<br>
[0039] If the base station detects a counting response the counting stops and no<br>
further request messages are transmitted. Therefore, in FIG. 4, and also with respect<br>
to FIG. 1, a base station controller 101 will send the Temporary Mobile Group<br>
Identity (TMGI) and a session ID to all base stations (Edge Nodes) 103 within its<br><br>
control area. Each base station 103 will then broadcast the notification message QI<br>
409, during time interval T1 405 and allocate a resource for response as time interval<br>
T2 407. The notification message QI 409 will indicate at least the TMGI, session ID,<br>
initial probability factor P, and the allocated response resource on the reverse link.<br>
The QI can be one of a plurality of physical layer signals, through which the TMGI,<br>
session ID, initial probability factor P, and the allocated response resource on the<br>
reverse link, are changed or set in a manner known to the mobile station.<br>
Alternatively, one or all resources may be predefined in which case the resource<br>
allocation information need not be contained in the notification message QI 409.<br>
Furthermore, the QI can be used to indicate that the mobile stations should cease<br>
transmitting counting responses.<br>
[0040] After receiving the first QI 409, the mobile stations will run a probability test<br>
using the initial probability factor, P, and determine whether to join in the counting<br>
response. If a mobile station determines it should respond, it will transmit using<br>
ON/OFF Keying during the allocated response time interval T2 407. The base station<br>
103 may thereafter receive at least one response, or a combined response 415 during<br>
the time interval T2 407.<br>
[0041] If the base station 103 does not receive a response, it transmits a second QI<br>
411 after the first response time interval 407. The second QI 411 may be much<br>
simplified from the initial QI 409. The mobile stations 109 monitor for the next QI<br>
411. If no additional QIs are detected by the mobile station, then the mobile station<br>
may assume that the counting process is completed. If another QI is detected, for<br>
example QI 411, then the mobile station will update the probability factor to N times<br>
the initial probability factor, for example if N = 10, Pnext = 10 x Pinitial, and run the<br>
probability test again to determine whether to join the counting response.<br>
This procedure will repeat as shown in FIG. 4, until the base station 103 detects at<br>
least one response. For example, in FIG. 4 a third QI 413 may be transmitted and the<br>
mobile stations may update P to P = 0.1, run the probability test, and if appropriate,<br>
transmit the response 419. Note that if P = 1, and no response has been received, then<br><br>
the counting procedure is completed as it may be assumed that no mobile station is<br>
present within the cell coverage area.<br>
[0042] PIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating the primary components of a mobile<br>
station in accordance with some embodiments. Mobile station 500 comprises user<br>
interfaces 501, at least one processor 503, and at least one memory 511. Memory 511<br>
has storage sufficient for the mobile station operating system 505, applications 507<br>
and general file storage 509. Mobile station 500 user interfaces 501, may be a<br>
combination of user interfaces including but not limited to a keypad, touch screen,<br>
voice activated command input, and gyroscopic cursor controls. Mobile station 500<br>
has a graphical display 517, which may also have a dedicated processor and/or<br>
memory, drivers etc. which are not shown in FIG. 5.<br>
[0043] It is to be understood that FIG. 5 is for illustrative purposes only and is for<br>
illustrating the main components of a mobile station in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure, and is not intended to be a complete schematic diagram of the various<br>
components and connections therebetween required for a mobile station. Therefore, a<br>
mobile station may comprise various other components not shown in FIG. 5 and still<br>
be within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
[0044] Returning to FIG. 5, the mobile station 500 also comprises a number of<br>
transceivers such as transceivers 513 and 515. Transceivers 513 and 515 may be for<br>
communicating with various wireless networks using various standards such as, but<br>
not limited to, UMTS, CDMA2000, 802.11, 802.16, etc.<br>
[0045] Memory 511 is for illustrative purposes only and may be configured in a<br>
variety of ways and still remain within, the scope of the present disclosure. For<br>
example, memory 511 may be comprised of several elements each coupled to the<br>
processor 503. Further, separate processors and memory elements may be dedicated<br>
to specific tasks such as rendering graphical images upon a graphical display. In any<br>
case, the memory 511will have at least the functions of providing storage for an<br>
operating system 505, applications 507 and general file storage 509 for mobile station<br><br>
500. In one embodiment, applications 507 comprise a probability test application that<br>
is run after receipt of a QT message to determine whether mobile station 500 should<br>
join a counting response in accordance with some embodiments as described herein.<br>
[0046] Additionally, in some embodiments, applications 507 may comprise a<br>
modulation and coding scheme determination application that determines an<br>
appropriate modulation and coding scheme for receiving MBMS. Such embodiments<br>
are described further below.<br>
[0047] Turning now to FIG. 6, high level operation of the various embodiments is<br>
illustrated. To begin, a base station or base stations 103 allocate a common radio<br>
resource as in block 601. The common radio resource may be, for example, one or<br>
more OFDM sub-carriers. The base station or base stations 103 broadcast the<br>
counting request as shown in block 603. The counting request may include an initial<br>
probability factor, TMGI, session identifier, and further in some embodiments a SINR<br>
range.<br>
[0048] In block 605, at least one counting response is received from a mobile station,<br>
or a combined response is received from many mobile stations. The number of<br>
responses may be limited by the probability test which each mobile station will run<br>
using the provided initial probability factor. The mobile stations may increase this<br>
factor upon subsequently received counting requests. Finally, in block 607, the base<br>
station will establish a PTM RB and deliver MBMS assuming that a response has<br>
been received.<br>
[0049] Turning how to FIG. 7, another embodiment is illustrated wherein blocks 701,<br>
703, and 705 are similar to blocks 601, 603, and 605, respectively. However, in block<br>
705, the received response may indicate a modulation and coding scheme (MCS)<br>
achievable by the mobile stations. In some embodiments, the base station will ask for<br>
an achievable MCS state in block 703, and receive an MCS selection indication as<br>
part of the response in block 705. The MCS may be for example, rate 1/3 turbo<br>
coding used with one of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), Quadrature<br><br>
Amplitude Modulation (QAM) such as 4, 8,16, or 64-QAM. The MCS in general<br>
may be any other suitable modulation and coding scheme. Furthermore, the<br>
indication of MCS state may alternatively comprise an indication of SINR that<br>
corresponds to an MCS that could be used by the base station transmitter and that the<br>
mobile station could receive at an acceptable error rate.<br>
[0050] In a different embodiment, the response of block 705 provides indication that<br>
the mobile stations are within the STNR range provided in block 703, such that the<br>
base station may select an appropriate MCS as shown in block 707. In block 709, a<br>
PTM RB is established assuming that at least one response was received, and the<br>
determined MCS is used for MBMS delivery.<br>
[0051] By employing the various embodiments of the present disclosure, reverse link<br>
signaling overhead is reduced because the various embodiments utilize a physical<br>
layer signaling approach rather than using messaging, such that less information is<br>
transmitted. Further, because power transmitted from mobile stations responding to a<br>
counting is combined in the various embodiments, reliability is increased. Still<br>
further, the various embodiments reduce delay, because the physical layer in the base<br>
station may control counting, rather than higher layers in the base station controller.<br>
[0052] In another embodiment, a modulation and coder state (MCS) may be selected<br>
for delivery of MBMS. In Enhanced MBMS delivery (E-MBMS), very high signal-<br>
to-noise-and-interference ratios (SINR) may occur when many cells transmit in a<br>
single frequency network while low SINR may occur when only one cell transmits.<br>
Because the best efficiency is achieved by selecting proper MCS states as quickly as<br>
possible, some embodiments make this selection prior to beginning transmission,<br>
during the counting process.<br>
[0053] Therefore, in some embodiment the base station 103 may provide a SINR<br>
range such that only mobile stations having a SINR for signal reception that is within<br>
the range would join the counting. Other procedures, such as the probability test may<br>
still be used in conjunction with the SINR range requirement. In an alternative<br><br>
embodiment, the base station may request the mobile station to answer directly<br>
whether a given MCS is achievable; otherwise a mobile station may respond if it<br>
conforms to the SINR range and any other requirement such as the probability test.<br>
[0054] In some embodiments, a mobile station may reply with one bit indicating that<br>
it is within the SINR range. However, multiple bits may be transmitted to indicate<br>
channel conditions or a preferred MCS for the mobile station. Using additional bits,<br>
as in some embodiments, is helpful for indicating for example, where in a range the<br>
mobile station falls, assuming a large constraint range.<br>
[0055] Various approaches for SINR measurement by a mobile station may be used<br>
and remain within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the serving base<br>
station may indicate to the mobile stations which base stations will transmit, similar to<br>
a neighbor list, such that a mobile station may estimate SINR by measuring the pilot<br>
channels from each of the indicated base stations. Alternatively, the network may<br>
transmit a single pilot from all base stations that will deliver the service, such that a<br>
mobile station may determine the SINR from the combined pilot channel.<br>
[0056] While the preferred embodiments have been illustrated and described, it is to<br>
be understood that the disclosure is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes,<br>
variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
