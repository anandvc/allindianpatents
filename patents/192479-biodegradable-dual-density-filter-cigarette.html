				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to biodegradable dual density cigarette.<br>
More specifically the subject invention relates to biodegradable dual density<br>
cigarette comprising of two portions, a tobacco rod and butt portion joined to<br>
each other longitudinally.<br>
The embodiment of the invention resides in the cost effective process of<br>
manufacturing the dual density cigarettes and subsequent product such as<br>
high density cigarettes, plugs and other combinations.<br>
PRIOR ART <br>
The cigarettes presently available ill the national and International market can<br>
be categorized in two classes namely, plain (non-filter) and filter cigarettes.<br>
Cigarettes are made in various sizes in diameter and lengths. The cost of<br>
Plain cigarettes is substantially lower. These "plain cigarettes" attract<br>
smokers of two types - "Bidi smokers wanting to upgrade themselves "and"<br>
filter cigarette smoker opting for low cost cigarettes".<br>
The non-filter cigarettes have tobacco with normal density throughout the<br>
length of the cigarette. Often the loose tobacco particles enter the mouth of<br>
the smoker due to the absence of a filter. The Non-filter cigarette often turns<br>
soggy at the smoking end due to constant contact with the smoker's mouth.<br>
Besides, due to the relatively loose packing density of the tobacco and loss of<br>
tobacco particles from the nonsmoking end, the cigarette loses its stiffness.<br>
Filter cigarettes contain tobacco of normal density along with synthetic filters.<br>
The filter plug in a filter cigarette comprises of fibrous material attached to a<br>
normal density tobacco rod. The fibrous material can be cellulose, acetate<br>
tow, polypropylene tow, or any of the other known kind of synthetic fibrous<br>
material. These filter cigarettes are non-biodegradable, and require special<br>
cigarette making equipment and additionally these cigarettes are more<br>
expensive than non-filter cigarette.<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 09/988,828 teaches about a filter cigarette with<br>
tobacco filter in which the tobacco strand enclosed by a cigarette paper. The<br>
tobacco used is manufactured without using medium cut roll stem and without<br>
reconstituted tobacco with a width cut of 0.3 to 0.6 mm and the filter has a<br>
tobacco packing density of 350 to 400 g/cm3<br>
.<br>
EP 1250 854 A1 describes a poison-reduced cigarette includes adding<br>
hydrate of double salt of ferroso-ferric chloride into tobacco and cigarette filter<br>
to react with nicotine to form salt which will not be absorbed by the mucous<br>
membranes in the smoker's respiratory system for minimizing nicotine poison<br>
and for enhancing the smoker's health.<br>
EP 1032282 describes a filter for tobacco products, in particular cigarettes, is<br>
made of a cellulose nonwoven fabric produced by an air-laid process and<br>
spirally rolled.<br>
EP 1032283 describes a filter Cigarette comprising a biodegradable filter and<br>
a tobacco strand surrounded by cigarette paper, a non-woven air-laid<br>
cellulose filter with a normal retention capacity and a filter ventilation area<br>
extending in a peripheral direction. The filter cigarette has the combination of<br>
features. The filter has a condensate retention capacity of 40-60%; the nonwoven<br>
cellulose is non-crimped, the nicotine/tobacco strand condensate yield<br>
ratio lies between 0,6 and 0,9 (nicotine *10/condensate), the apparent density<br>
of the tobacco mixture of the tobacco strand ranges from 200 to 250mg/ml,<br>
the tobacco strand drag is between 45 and 65 mmw WS when measured in<br>
an enclosed form, air permeability of the cigarette paper is 20-50 CORESTA<br>
units and the filter ventilation degree is 15-50%.<br>
WO 01/58290 A1 discloses a cigarette filter for easily removing harmful<br>
materials like nicotine an tar from cigarette smoke. During inhalation, the filter<br>
can filter harmful ingredients such as nicotine and tar included in cigarette<br>
smoke, through a front filter, a mugwort-impregnated filtering-net, a diffusing<br>
body, a pine resin-impregnated filtering-net and then a back filter.<br>
Additionally, the filter which incorporates the mugwort and the pine resin<br>
therein thus is helpful in preserving the health of the smoker, as well as<br>
allowing the smoker to feel normal during inhalation, which results from the<br>
aromatic properties of the mugwort and the pine resin impregnated into<br>
filtering-nets present within the fHter.<br>
The filters of cigarettes designed to filter harmful materials, such as nicotine<br>
and tar, are provided at one end of the cigarette. Such filters are typically<br>
classified into several types as follows: That is, the conventional filters of the<br>
cigarettes are classified according to their structure into a Single filter<br>
consisting of one integrated filter, a double filter formed by a linear<br>
arrangement of two filter segments, and a multiples filter formed by the linear<br>
arrangement of a plurality of different kinds of filter segments. The filters are<br>
also Classified according to the material of the filters into a fiber filter, a<br>
chemical granule-laden filter, and a carbon granule-laden filter. In the prior<br>
art, fiber filters allow hazardous materials included in the Cigarette smoke to<br>
simply pass through their fibrous matrix, and thus a large effect cannot be<br>
expected. However, fiber filters, particularly those laden with carbon or<br>
chemical granules for removing nicotine and tar, have been most preferably<br>
and widely used as filters for cigarettes.<br>
Conventionally a cigarrette rod making machine employs a distributor which<br>
delivers fragmentized particles of tobacco leaves, fragmentized sheets of<br>
reconstituted tobacco and/or fragments of artificial tobacco to a stream<br>
building zone whereint he particles from a continuous stream. Such stream<br>
contains surplus of fibrous material and is converted into a continuous rod<br>
during travel with a conveyor past a trimming or equalizing device which<br>
removes the surplus. The resulting rod (also called filler) is thereupon<br>
condensed and draped into a web of cigarette paper or other suitable<br>
wrapping material to form with the weeb a cigarette rod which is subdivided<br>
(e.g., by a conventional cutoff) into sections of unit length or multiple unit<br>
length. The thus obtained cigarettes are. delivered to storage, toa packing<br>
machine or to a filter tipping machine. Certain tyupes of filter rod sections are<br>
or can be produced in a similar manner except that the fibrous material which<br>
forms the stream is a substance which intercepts certain presumably harmful<br>
ingredients of tobacco smoke when it constitutes the rod-shaped component<br>
of the filter mouthpiece in filter cigarette.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide the smoker a filter cigarette<br>
having a filter portion which is non-biodegradable that substantially reduces<br>
the tar and nicotine elements and having higher chloride contents.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide the smoker a filter cigarette<br>
which is at the same time inexpensive and environment friendly.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a naturally<br>
biodegradable cigarette having a smoke delivery profile comparable to the<br>
synthetic filter cigarette.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective process<br>
of producing high-density tobacco rod and subsequent product usage option<br>
such as high-density cigarette, plugs and other combinations.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to give satisfaction comparable to<br>
that of the conventional filter cigarette without actually having synthetic filter in<br>
the cigarette.<br>
The present invention provides a biodegradable, environmental friendly, cost<br>
effective filter cigarette which eliminates health hazards.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a biodegradable dual-density<br>
cigarette comprising of a rod of tobacco of predetermined length wrapped in<br>
cigarette paper wherein the tobacco content are packed at high density at the<br>
smoking end of a predetermined length and normal density for the remaining<br>
length upto the opposite end.<br>
The tobacco content at the said high density end primarily includes mixtures<br>
of cut and rolled stem (CRS), but can also include mixtures of graded<br>
tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, dust with binders or natural materials.<br>
The normal density of such rod is in the range of 225 mg/cc to 280 mg/cc<br>
while the high density of such rod is at least 280 mg/cc.<br>
The length ratio of normal and high density of said tobacco rod is 5:1 and is<br>
configured so as to maintain the desired smoke delivery profile. The highdensity<br>
end of the said cigarette is wrapped with porus paper of a different<br>
colour for the identification of the smoking high density end of the cigarette by<br>
the user.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a biodegradable dual density<br>
cigarette comprising a filler or tobacco rod and butt portion joined to each<br>
other longitudinally in a ratio of 5:1 wherein the tobacco rod is a blend of<br>
tobacco wrapped in a cigarette paper at a pressure drop of 22 to 50 mm of<br>
water column, the butt portion comprising atleast cut-roll stem particles of<br>
expanded fibres of density of at least 0.28/cc wrapped in a porous paper of<br>
atleast 100 mm of water gauge.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing<br>
of biodegradable dual densities cigarette comprising the steps of :<br>
subjecting the stem of the tobacco leaf to a conventional conditioning<br>
process for 10 to 20 minutes at 30-40° C. to quench the moisture uniformly;<br>
passing the said quenched stem through conditioning tunnel or through a<br>
flatner or a roller to flatten the stem;<br>
cutting the stem into small partictes of the size 30 to 180 cpi;<br>
cutting the small particles through an expansion heated tunnel at a<br>
temperature of 100 to 103°C for a period of 20 to 30 seconds;<br>
passing the said particles through a drier and a classifier to obtain a cut roll<br>
stem (CRS);<br>
cooling the CRS at room temperature by storing in boxes rolled humidifier;<br>
encapsulating the cooled cut rolled stem in a filter wrapping paper to obtain<br>
the filter butt;<br>
processing the filler or tobacco end with tobacco in the conventional manner;<br>
joining the butt portion in the conventional manner to obtain the<br>
biodegradable filler cigarette.<br>
The subject invention can better be understood with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. However, the same are for illustrative purposes and<br>
should not be construed to restrict the scope of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a dual density cigarette having normal density tobacco at<br>
one end and high-density tobacco at other end. The length ratio of normal<br>
and high density can be configured so to maintain the expected smoke<br>
delivery profile.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides for enhancement of smoke delivery profile<br>
comparable to normal synthetic filter cigarette as well as results in substantial<br>
reduction of tar and nicotine. Due the high density tobacco at the mouth end<br>
the sogginess of tobacco when put into the mouth and the entrance of loose<br>
tobacco particles entering into the mouth is also avoided.<br>
The cigarette is 100% biodegradable and is cost effective since the<br>
conventional machines can be used.<br>
This cigarette is to be smoked through high-density end and this high density<br>
tobacco portion is tipped with porous cork tipping paper of different colour for<br>
identification to enable the consumer to know that tipped portion of the<br>
cigarette is to be put in the mouth.<br>
High-density tobacco rods can be manufactured using tobacco material such<br>
as cut and rolled stem, graded tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, tobacco dust<br>
with binders as well as various combination of above or natural materials.<br>
Density of such rod may be selected as per individual product need. Normally<br>
the density selected are atleast 280 mg/cc. Figure 1 shows that the tobacco<br>
or filler rod (1) is a blend of tobacco wrapped in a cigarette paper at a<br>
pressure drop of 22 to 50 mm of water columnThe filler rod (1) is filled with<br>
blend of tobacco comprising 75 to 85 % of lamina and 15 to 25% of the<br>
expanded stem fibres or cutt-roll stem. The lamina is normal density tobacco<br>
of 4-6 cc/gm at the rate of 12.5% oven volatile preferably 5-6 cc/gm at the<br>
rate of 12.5% oven volatile. The butt portion (2) comprising atleast cut-roll<br>
stem particles of expanded fibres of the density of at least O.28/cc wrapped in<br>
a porous paper of atleast 100 mm of water gauge. The expanded stem is 4-7<br>
cc/gm at the rate of 12.5% oven volatile, preferably 6-7 cc/gm at the rate of<br>
12.5% oven volatile. The pressure drop in the tobacco rod is 5-9 water<br>
column per mm. of filler end while the pressure drop in the butt end is 3-4<br>
water column per mm. The stem portion is the mid ribb of tobacco plant leaf<br>
having lower nicotinic content and higher cloride content.<br>
Normal and high-density tobacco rods are manufactured on any conventional<br>
cigarette making machine using normal cigarette paper as wrapper for the<br>
rod. The stem of the tobacco leaf is subjected to a conventional conditioning<br>
process for 10 to 20 minutes at 30-40° C to quench the moisture uniformly.<br>
The quenched stem is passed through conditioning tunnel or through a flatner<br>
or a roller to flaten the stem. The stem is then cut into small particles of the<br>
size 30 to 180 cpi. The small particles are cut through an expansion heated<br>
tunnal at a temperature of 100 to 103° C for a period of 20 to 30 seconds.<br>
The particles are passed through a drier and a classifier to obtain a cut roll<br>
stem (CRS). The CRS are cooled at room temperature by storing in boxes<br>
rolled humidifier. The cooled cut rolled stem are encapsulated in a filter<br>
wrapping paper to obtain the filter butt;.<br>
The filler or tobacco rods are made to required length are then supplied to<br>
assembler, the purpose of this unit to assemble the normal and high density<br>
tobacco filter butts in the ratio of 5: 1.<br>
The assembler further cuts the high-density rods in suitable pieces normally 4<br>
to 6 pieces called "Plugs" but other combination are also possible. This is<br>
followed by assembly of these "plugs" with the normal tobacco rod and over<br>
tipping with the tipping paper of suitable width, size and colour. The tipping<br>
paper or plug wrap can either be normal or relatively high porous to give<br>
required smoke delivery values.<br>
This specially made dual density cigarette is capable of delivery of smoke<br>
profile comparable to any other conventional filters as is evident from the test<br>
results.<br>
While perticular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated<br>
and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in art that various other<br>
changes and modifications can be made without departing from the sprit and<br>
scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended<br>
claims all such changes and modifications that are with in the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
The following table shows the typical example of the property of the butt end:<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The following table shows the property of the filler or tobacco rod:<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
It is clear that the moisture nicotinic content are less in the butt end while TRS<br>
and cloride content are more in the but end as compared to the filler end.<br>
Analytical tests<br>
A number of analytical tests were conducted to compare the tar and nicotine<br>
content of the non-filter cigarettes, filter cigarettes and dual density cigarettes.<br>
The three analytical tables are as given below:<br>
Table 1 comprises of 3 sUb-tables showing the density trend of micro plain<br>
cigarettes (Table 1A), Plain and regular filter type cigarettes (Table 18) and<br>
King Size Brands (Table 1 C).<br>
The Tables 1A, 18 and 1C show the comparative tobacco density that exists<br>
in different brands of cigarette having a standard length of 59 mm. The data<br>
is taken for two years i.e. for the years 2000 and 2001. the figures show that<br>
the average density of tobacco in micro plain brands (Table 1A), filter size<br>
brands (Table 1B) and the king size brands (Table 1C) ranges betwen 232<br>
mg/cc and 264 mg/cc.<br>
The Table 2 features the analytical data showing the comparison of Tar and<br>
Nicotine in the non-filter and dual density cigarettes. The analytical data<br>
reveals that theDual Density Cigarettes shows lesser value of the tar &amp;<br>
nicotine as compared with the non-filter cigarettes of same lengths.<br>
Table 3 shows the comparison of "tar" and "nicotine" yield obtained from the<br>
conventional filter tipped cigarettes, the dual density cigarettes fitted with<br>
present invention and the non-filter plain cigarette. The table reve,als that the<br>
quality of smoke delivery of dual density cigarette is comparable with the filter<br>
cigarette. The tar content of the smoke from the dual density cigarette with a<br>
circumference of 24.44 mm is slightly higher than the tar content in the filter<br>
cigarette with the circumference of 24.46 mm.<br>
