				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention rotates to a method for selective plugging of channels in ceramic<br>
honeycomb structure.<br>
This invention further relates to a method of preparing solid plugs from green<br>
ceramic material, for selective sealing of open ends of channels In ceramic<br>
honeycomb structure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Ceramic Honeycomb wall-flow fitters are used for solid partteutete nitration from<br>
gases in which the particulates are mixed or suspended. The ceramic wall-now<br>
filters are fabricated from a ceffuter or honeycomb structure in which mutually<br>
adjoining cells or hollow passages extend through the structure between a pair of<br>
its opposing end faces where the open, transverse cross-sections of the eels are<br>
exposed. Fabrication of waH-now filters involves plugging selectively the end<br>
faces of the ceU In checkered board pattern such that the cells open at one end<br>
face are plugged at other end face. The walls of the cells in such a honeycomb<br>
structure are thin and porous with high permeability, which allows the fluid to flow<br>
through while preventing soft) particles from flowing.<br>
The ceramic wall-flow filters used for exhaust emission ffltratton in diesel engines<br>
are subjected to variable flow rates in which the pressure applied to the plugs are<br>
variable and sometimes It Is higher at higher emission rates. Oue to continuous<br>
Impingement of gases on the plugs In ceramic filters over a period of time, the<br>
erosion of the plugs are fast and can get punctured r the strength of the plug<br>
sintered along with ceramic honeycomb is not adequate.<br><br>
-2-<br>
DPF is fabricated using various materials such as cordlerlte, slcort carbide etc.<br>
The process of manufacturing Honeycomb involves extrusion molding, folowed<br>
by drying and then alternately plugging the end faces, folowed by firing. DiTerent<br>
methods are available for plugging the end faces of Honeycomb.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,329,162 also discloses ceramic honeycomb filers in which<br>
selective seals are provided to the Inlet and outlet channels by injecting a<br>
slnterable material or other sealng cement into the appropriate ends of the<br>
channels to form a "checkerboard" array of open/closed channels at each end<br>
face.<br>
Thermal expansion mismatch is one of the major disadvantages of using ceramic<br>
cement for sealing of honeycomb eels and 1 increases the stress levels at the<br>
end face of the honeycomb cells at higher temperatures, which may lead to<br>
cracking of fiers in use. Also the honeycombs sealed with ceramic cement can<br>
only be used at tow temperatures compared to that fabricated completely from<br>
cordtertte.<br>
US. Patent No. 4,410,591 describe alernate methods of fabricating a multiple<br>
flow path body such as a stationary heat exchanger. A honeycomb structure Is<br>
provided having Is eels arranged in columns across Is open end faces, an open<br>
end face of a honeycomb structure is dipped into a flowable resist material and<br>
the resist material removed from selected columns by cutting I away together<br>
wih the common wals of the adjoining cells In the totocted column or,<br>
alternatively, the waJs between the adjoining eels of the selected columns are<br>
cut away at the open end face of the structure before dipping the end face into<br><br>
-3-<br>
the ftowable resist material and the resist material It blown from the selected<br>
columns using compressed air directed down the selected columns where the<br>
adjoining cell walls had been removed. The end face was thereafter dipped Into<br>
slurry of cement to form a sealed channel across each of the selected columns.<br>
The remaining flowable resist material was subsequently removed by heating. As<br>
the cross-sectional density of cells in the honeycomb structure is increased, for<br>
example to Improve the efficiency of a filter body, the tolerances needed for the<br>
removal of adjoining ceN walls required by the Nod, et al method requires the<br>
partial destruction of adjoining cells are sealed in a checkered or other possible<br>
alternating cell patterns at the end faces.<br>
European patent No. 42,301 discloses a method In which a ceramic honeycomb<br>
is selectively sealed by bonding a sealing member to each end face of the<br>
honeycomb. The sealing member has same outer shape as that of the<br>
honeycomb and has network of alternate open channels separated by sealing<br>
portions in checkered pattern or any other desired pattern. The open channels in<br>
the sealing member are located corresponding to the eels of the honeycomb<br>
which are to be kept open. The extruded sealing members and green<br>
honeycomb are separately dried before the sealing members are fitted to the<br>
honeycomb body Itself, preferably by means or any organic adhesive, a glass<br>
material, or a ceramic material, foRowed by standard firing of the composite so<br>
formed. The ceramic honeycomb fHters produced by above method can not be<br>
sealed properly as the ceHs of the sealing member w* have different drying<br>
shrinkage than that In honeycomb resulting into mismatch of the cell openings In<br>
honeycomb to the sealing member. Otherwise, it requires exceptionally close<br>
absolute dimensional matching of both the structures, which can only be met with<br>
very high dimensional tolerances. It Is Impractical to fabricate the structures with<br>
such hfgft tolerances.<br><br>
-4-<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,411,856 proposes the use of a mask completely covering one<br>
end face of the monolith, this mask being provided with passages and with pog-<br>
Kke extensions on the side facing the monolith. The pegs are placed into the<br>
ducts that are not to be sealed whereas the composition Is Introduced through<br>
the passages in the mask into the end regions of the ducts to be sealed. An<br>
attempt is made to take the aforementioned deviation of the monotth from a<br>
desired geometry Into account by making the mask utilized of an elastic material.<br>
This method may be applicable within limits. There is, though, the problem that<br>
the spacing of the above-mentioned pegs to the passages h fixed so that the<br>
compensation of the deviations of (he monoftfh from the desired geometry,<br>
obtained by the elasticity of the mask, remains restricted to very low values.<br>
US Paten No. 5,766,393 discloses a method where expansive material is used<br>
to temporarily seal the alternate holes of Honeycomb in checkerboard pattern. A<br>
ceramic material paste is used to plug the remaining holes. The green<br>
honeycomb thus fabricated is sintered to produce dfesel partfculate fitter. The<br>
expensive materials used for sealing are burnt during the process of Iking and<br>
forms oponing in checkerboard pattern.<br>
In another US patent 6,627,123, a powdered material Is charged Into selected<br>
cells of honeycomb and then It is compacted by vfcratton, centrifuge, manual<br>
compaction or some other method. After compaction of the powdered material<br>
into the cells of the honeycomb laser energy is applied to heat it sufficiently to<br>
become ftowable which is further solidifies after cooling to form plugs.<br><br>
-5-<br>
The fitters produced by such method does not ensure uniform plug length and it<br>
wi result to differential back pressure when the filter Is used for gas fHtration.<br>
Due to this, a mechanical stress wi be generated during application and It may<br>
result in detonation of mechanical strength of filter.<br>
Also, during the process of plugging of green honeycomb with a plastic material,<br>
usually the material Is either fMad Into the ceHs by applying high pressure or a<br>
material with high flowabiity is used to improve the workability. In case of highly<br>
plastic material, the pressure applied on the honeycomb end face Is high which<br>
may damage or deform the eels In the process while In case of highly ffowable<br>
material the dispersing medium diffuses into the cell waR which is adequate to<br>
soften the cell walls.<br>
Another problem with above method is the high shrinkage of plugging material<br>
compared to the honeycomb, whfch is being plugged. Due to (his the green<br>
honeycombs are subjected to high stress during drying. TNs may lead to crack<br>
generation In the Wars after firing.<br>
During the process of plugging honeycombs by above method, when laser<br>
energy Is applied the heating of powdered malarial Is only done white adjoining<br>
cells, which are open, are not subjected to any heating. As a result of this,<br>
temperature differential is attained at different locations on the end surface of the<br>
honeycomb. Also the center portion of the honeycomb Is at low temperature than<br>
the end faces. Due to this a high level of stress is generating which can cause<br>
cracking of honeycomb.<br><br>
-6-<br>
Apart from this, a close control on heating of powdered material Is also needed,<br>
as the plugging material, which Is being heated, can conduct enough heat to<br>
deform the ceB wafts.<br>
In another US Patent No. 5,062,911 the method of plugging green honeycomb<br>
structure is disclosed where dried green honeycomb is wetted, preferably with<br>
water, to re-plastlctze the ceramic material at the race and a sttt-wef end cap<br>
body Is then firmly fitted onto each face with sufficient force to Integrate the<br>
plasticized ceramic material of each into a substantially continuous phase. Any<br>
excess material from the end cap that extends beyond the sides of the<br>
honeycomb Itself as a result of this pressing operation can be trimmed off so that<br>
the edges of the end caps are flush with tfm sides of ttm honeycomb. The end<br>
caps are then selectively perforated by a hand-held punch or tool having a pin<br>
that Is sized and shaped appropriately to pierce the end cap fn a manner<br>
congruent wlh the size and shape of the channel openings to be exposed.<br>
In the methods explained for plugging of honeycombs, a ftowable material Is<br>
used. The ftowable material Is charged Into the honeycomb cells by capillary<br>
action In certain cases while sometimes a plastic paste is pushed into the ceUs by<br>
applying pressure. Charging of material wlh high flowablHty Into the honeycomb<br>
cells Is mostly preferred as It gives higher plug length compared to that achieved<br>
by using plastic mass. The desirable consistency for material with high flowabHKy<br>
for this purpose » achieved only at higher water content and the quantity of<br>
material charged Into the cells of honeycomb Is much higher than the material<br>
quantity of ceN walls with which it makes contact. Due to this, localized softening<br>
and deformation of cafe in the green honeycombs is seen as the binders in<br>
honeycomb readily absorb water from charged material.<br><br>
-7-<br>
Another drawback of these methods Include the generation of high street<br>
locations on the end face of the honeycomb cells due to high drying shrinkage of<br>
materials used for plugging. This can lead to crack generation at end face of the<br>
cetfs In honeycomb fitters.<br>
Non-uniformity in plug length is also commonly seen in the fitters produced by<br>
above methods, which further leads to lower mechanical durability when used for<br>
gas filtration application at higher temperatures.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore, an object of this Invention to propose a method of preparing soHd<br>
plugs for selective sealing of channels in ceramic honeycomb structure which<br>
helps to avoid softening and deformation of eels during the method of plugging<br>
dried green ceramic honeycombs.<br>
It is further object of this invention to propose a method of preparing solid plugs<br>
for selective seating of channel in ceramic honeycomb structure which leads to<br>
uniform length of the plugs across the section of plugs between two end faces.<br>
Another object of this Invention to propose a method of preparing sold plugs for<br>
selective sealing of channels In ceramic honeycomb structure to reduce stress<br>
level in the honeycomb ceRs occurring due to higher drying shrinkage.<br>
Yet another object of this Invention to propose a method of preparing solid plugs<br>
for selective sealing of channels in ceramic honeycomb structure which haw<br>
better filtration efficiency and lower pressure drop.<br><br>

for selective seating of channels fn ceramic honeycomb structure, which provides<br>
any desired length of plugs even with higher celt density.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to this Invention Is provided a method for selective sealing of<br>
channels in ceramic honeycomb structure comprising, forming dried green plugs<br>
of ceramic material, followed by preparing a ceramic slurry containing a binder,<br>
selectively applying said slurry Into the cells of a honeycomb structure, and<br>
sealing the same by Inserting the plugs.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The step of forming the ceramic plug* comprises charging a plastic ceramic mix<br>
of plugging material Into the channels of fired honeycomb or plug forming<br>
apparatus.<br>
The ceramic material and slurry used are preferably of same composition as that<br>
used for fabricating honeycombs. However, it can also be made out of materials<br>
wUh therms) expansion nearer to that of honeycomb. The ceramk materials used<br>
for plug, slurry and honeycomb can be of cordferie, silicon, carbide, sicon<br>
nitride, mullite, alumina, zfrconia, aluminium tNanate etc. depending upon<br>
application. For low thermal expansion application cordlerRe or sWcon carbide Is<br>
predominantly used whHe for hfgh heat resistant application mufIKe, alumina<br>
zfrconia or aluminium titanata are used.<br>
Further, the method explained can also be used for plugging fired honeycombs<br>
where fired plugs can be inserted into the cells by using ceramic cement with<br>
thermal expansion nearer to that of honeycomb. This method of plugging can<br>
also be used for honeycombs having circular, rectangular or trigonal cells.<br>
The shrinkage of the material plugged into the cefls of honeycomb is significantly<br>
less and hence generates very small stress on the cell wads, thereby reducing<br>
the chances of crack generation in ceramic men.<br>
Fig 1 depicts an exemplary apparatus for forming dry green ceramic plugs. The<br>
apparatus can be made out of any corrosion resistant material, particularly from<br>
stainless steel. The apparatus has channels 1 extending in longitudinal direction<br>
and, which is open at end faces and with another opening along the surface 2 as<br>
shown In Fig 1. The channels extend parallel to each other separated by partition<br>
3.<br><br>
-10-<br>
The width of the partition are equal and can be varied for which a typical value<br>
here is 2.1mm. The channels are having square cross section for which the width<br>
is 2.1mm. Further, the apparatus has fine SMS 4 of width 0.2mm and at equal<br>
distance of typically 7 mm from each other. These sIMs have depth of 2.1mm and<br>
the bottom 5 has circular hole of diameter 0.25 mm extending along the bottom in<br>
transverse direction of the apparatus.<br>
For making dried green ceramic plugs, ceramic raw materials with same<br>
composition as used in honeycomb extrusion are mixed for 4 hrs in a cone<br>
blender and then mixed with 20% water In a high shear mixer for 15 to 30<br>
minutes. The mixed body prepared is kept for aging upto 12 hrs In a sealed<br>
container to avoid any moisture loss. Aging of body is done to get uniform<br>
distribution of moisture within the body. The aged body is mixed again in high<br>
shear mixer to get homogenous plastic body. The wet plastic ceramic mix Is flfted<br>
into the channels 1 of apparatus.<br>
After tVHng up of wet plastic ceramic mix Into the channel* 1 of apparatus In Fig<br>
1, a stainless steel sheet of typically 1 mm thickness and having a sharp edge at<br>
one end is used to wipe the excess material oozed out on the surface of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Further, stainless steel wires of typicaly 0.4 mm with metal beads at the ends as<br>
shown in Fig 2 are used to cut the plugs into required length. For cutting the<br>
plugs fWed Into the channels to required lengths the wire Is kept in stretched<br>
condition and run manually across the sifts 4 from the surface to the end of the<br>
slits in Fig 1.<br><br>
-11-<br>
The apparatus In Fig 1 fWed with wet ceramic mix in Us channels is Kept into an<br>
oven at 110*0 for 4 Hrs to dry and then removed for cooling it to ambient<br>
temperature. The ceramic material in the apparatus shrinks after drying and can<br>
be easily removed by pushing It from the end face of the channels using a<br>
member shown in Fig 3 with square cross section of 0.25 mm width and 50 mm<br>
length. By this method solid dried green plugs having square cross-section and<br>
of 6 mm length an 0.25 mm width are prepared. The plugs 3 shown In Fig 5 are<br>
formed by such method are having equal length measured across any section<br>
between two-ends of the plug.<br>
Dried green ceramic plugs can also be prepared by fUng up plastic mix Into a<br>
nred ceramic honeycomb and then drying it into oven at 11Q°C for 4 Hrs. To get<br>
suitable length and cross section of plug, fired honeycomb slices of required<br>
length are cut from the same lot of honeycombs, which are dried and kept for<br>
plugging. The cross section of plugs formed by this method exactly matches the<br>
ceRs of the dried green honeycombs, which are to be plugged. This method is<br>
adopted preferably If the deformation In ceHs of honeycomb Is more.<br>
A ceramic slurry used in the process of plugging honeycombs. It is preferably<br>
prepared out of same material as that used for extrusion of honeycombs. For<br>
preparing ceramic slurry 46% kaolin, 41% Talc and 13% Alumina by weight Is<br>
mixed and again blended with 5% methyl cellulose by weight for 2 hrs in a cone<br>
blender. Further, 36% water is added to the mix of ceramic materials and organic<br>
binder and then mixed for 30 minutes by using a stlrrer.<br>
To apply a thin coating of ceramic slurry on the cell walls at the end face 1 of the<br><br>
-12-<br>
honeycomb in Fig 4, a mask 2 with openings 2a In checkered pattern as shown<br>
in Fig 4 is used. The mask 2 can be made out of any material preferably with<br>
stainless steel sheet. Openings made in the mask are of the same dimension as<br>
that In honeycomb. The green honeycomb to be plugged with dried green plugs<br>
is kept vertically on a Rat surface and the mask is placed on the end face of the<br>
honeycomb in such a way that it covers the cells of honeycomb in checkerboard<br>
pattern.<br>
A thin coat of ceramic slurry is applied on the surface of the cell waRs at the end<br>
face as depicted In Fig 5. An enlarged view of ceR waNs across the section taken<br>
along the (ing X-X In honeycomb coated with ceramic slurry is shown in Fig 7.<br>
For applying ceramic slurry into the cells a fine brush is used. The brush is<br>
dipped Into ceramic slurry to adhere sufficient quantity of material Into It and then<br>
the material adhering to the brush is discharged by mopping it on the surface of<br>
the eels of honeycomb which are kept open for plugging. The ceramic slurry<br>
when applied using a brush Is easily absorbed Into the cells due to gravitational<br>
force as well as capillary action. So, the quantity of material discharged Into cells<br>
depends on the consistency of slurry made and dimension of the cefts. For<br>
plugging of green honeycombs the ceramic slurry applied is very small In quantity<br>
In order to avoid any softening of ceR walls. Also, N Is required to get a thin coat<br>
of slurry on the surface of ceR waRs.<br>
To optimize the quantity of slurry being discharged Info the cells, a pick and place<br>
mechanism can also be used where material flow can be controlled. A small<br>
quantity of slurry is picked and released into the cells selected for plugging as<br><br>
-13-<br>
shown In Fig 6. During (hi* process aft- Is blown from the other end of the channel<br>
in which slurry Is released to achieve e required length of slurry coating from the<br>
end face of the cells. The air blown from the other end of the channels also<br>
Increases the evaporation of water present In slurry. Thus, a very small quantity<br>
of water remains in the slurry coated on the honeycomb cell walls and which is<br>
not adequate to diffuse into the cell waifs thereby preventing the softening of ceH<br>
watts. Plug also may be soaked with slurry by wing truth or other moans.<br>
The plugs formed are now inserted into the cells fully to match one of the end<br>
surfaces of the plugs to the end face of the honeycomb.<br>
The method of masking and then plugging of cefe is done on the other end face<br>
of the honeycomb as explained earlier in such a way that the celts which are<br>
plugged on opposite side are open at tWs end.<br><br>
