SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTHENTICATING LIVE FEED FROM SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention elates generally to surveillance systems.<br>
II.	Background of the Invention<br>
Surveillance svstems are used in a wide number ox aDDlications to Dromote securir-. Typically, a surveillance system includes one or more video cameras that are mounted in a location sought to be monitored. The cameras send video footage to central monitoring areas where the video is observed by security personnel, or stored for later viewing, or both.<br>
As recognized by the present invention, existing surveillance systems suffer several drawbacks. One drawback is that of authentication, i.e., verifying that what is being monitored is actually what is within the scope of the surveillance camera or system. As understood herein, an audio/video stream from a surveillance camera can be digitally signed by the camera, but all that ensures is that the stream is from the signing camera, not that the stream itself accurately represents the image of the intended scope of surveillance. That is. a digital signature verifies the identity of the source camera but it does not verify that wha: is being sent from the camera is a real-time image of the intended scope of surveillance and not, e.g., a false image being fed through the camera by someone attempting to fool the surveillance system. Having made the observations discussed above, the present invention provides the below-disclosed solutions to one or more of the prior art drawbacks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method for surveillance includes generating a verification signal that can be detected within an observation scope of a surveilled location. The verification signal is sensed and sent to a monitoring location. Based on the verification signal, it is determined whether a surveillance stream generated by sensing the observation scope is a valid stream.<br>
In a preferred, non-limiting embodiment, the verification signal is a secure audible or visual s'isnal sensed bv an audio/video camera, e.2.. the sisnal can be a modulation of an unpredictabie random stream tr.L: is generated using a secret, such as but not limited to a cryptographic key. The random seed can be periodically refreshed from the momtonng location, if desired. Orr a challenge can be generated at the monitoring location, with the<br><br>
verification signal being generated in response thereto. The challenge can be generated by a manual action of a person or automatically generated.<br>
Preferably, the verification sienai is generated, sensed, sent to the monitoring location, and analyzed substantially in real time. Or, the'verification signal can be recorded by a trusted observer along with the surveillance stream, ^mestamped, and digitally signed bv the trusted observer, for future oiavback and analvsii. The surveilled location can be a moving location, such as an aircraft, ship, train, or vehicle.<br>
In another aspect, a surveillance system includes a secure signal transmitter that can be disposed within an intended observation scope in a surveilled location and configured to transmit at least one authentication signal. An authentication signal capture device is also disposable in the surveilled location to receive the authentication signal, and a receiver can be disposed in a monitoring location remote from the surveilled location and configured to receive signals from the capture device, including the authentication signal, for use thereof in verifying that a scope of surveillance is an intended scope in real time.<br>
In yet another aspect, a system for surveillance includes means for generating a secure signal stream detectable within an observation scope of a surveilled location. Means sense the secure signal stream, and means are provided for sending the secure signal stream to a monitoring location. Means are also provided for determining, based on the secure signal stream, whether a surveillance stream generated by sensing the observation scope is a valid stream.<br>
In still another aspect, a surveillance system includes a moving platform defining a surveilled location, and an audio/video camera in the surveilled location generates a real time audio/video stream of an intended observation scope. The audio/video stream is transmitted to a monitoring location remote from the moving platform. A secure signal transmitter is also disposed within the scope, and the secure signal transmitter generates a secure visual or audible signal that is part of the audio/video stream. An observer at the monitoring location verifies in real time that the audio/video stream is of the intended scope, based on the secure audible or visual signal.<br>
The details of the present invention, both as to its structure and operation, can best be understood in reference to the uc:onpanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a presently preferred surveillance system; Figure 2 is a flow chart of the overall logic of the invention; Figure 3 is a flow chart of one non-limiting example of the present logic; and Figure 4 is a flow chart of another non-limiting example of the present logic.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring initially to Figure L a system is shown, generally designated 10, for effecting video surveillance in one or more surveilled locations 12 and for selectively sending surveillance video, preferably in real time, to one or more monitoring locations 14, which can be remote from the surveilled location 12 and which can communicate with the surveilled location 12 via wired or wireless transmission principles or satellite communication systems. As but one non-limiting example, the surveilled location 12 can be the cockpit of an aircraft or a location in another moving platform such as a ship, train, or vehicle, and the remote monitoring location 14 can be a ground-based monitoring station in wireless communication with therewith. Or, the surveilled location 12 can be a fixed location that is in wireless or wired communication with the monitoring location 14, which can be a fixed or portable location or device.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, at least one respective authentication signal capture device 16 is disposed in each location 12. The capture device 16 can be a video camera, or microphone, or even an rf receiver that generates a real time surveillance stream representing a scope of observation in the surveilled location 12. Or, the capture device 16 can be a standalone device, e.g., a CCD, that functions apart from a conventional surveillance source such as a video camera. Alternatively, devices such as lenses and fiber optical cables can be used to transfer images to other locations for capture or recording.<br>
Within the scope of observation is a secure signal transmitter 18 which generates a secure verification stream in accordance with the disclosure below. The secure signal generator 18 can be enclosed in a tamper-proof enclosure if desired. The stream is sensed by the capture device 16. The secure signal transmitter 18 canj&gt;e, by way of non-limiting example only, a light emitting diode or other source of visual signals that is located within the intended scope of observation, or the secure signal transmitter IS can be a speaker or other audio signal source that is located within the intended scope of observation, or indeed<br><br>
the secure signal transmitter 18 can be an rf transmitter. In any case, however implemented, the secure signal transmitter preferably Transmits a secure stream signal, in that the signals from the transmitter are a continuous stream or are periodically transmitted bursts or other discrete transmissions that are made from time to time and detected by the capture device 16. The secure signal preferably is generated in accordance with a modulation of a randomly-generated or pseudorandomly-generated stream that may be based on an initial random seed.<br>
A microprocessor 20 or other processing circuitry or controller can be associated with one or more of the capture device 16 and secure signal transmitter IS. Signals from the capture device 16 can be sent :o the remote monitoring location 14 using a wired or wireless transceiver 22. When the secure signal transmitter 18 is an LED or equivalent device or speaker or equivalent device that transmits an audible or visual secure signal and the capture device 16 is the surveillance video camera itself, the authentication signal should be transmitted within the surveillance audio/video stream.<br>
Turning to the remote monitoring location 14, a transceiver 24 receives signals from the surveilled location 12, with the signals being processed as appropriate for analysis thereof by a microprocessor 26 in accordance with the flow charts herein. To this end, the microprocessor 26 can access a preferably software-implemented logic module 28 to execute the logic. The microprocessor 26 can output signals such as but not limited to a video signal containing signals from the secure signal transmitter 18 to a monitor 30 for viewing thereof by a person. If desired, the microprocessor 26 can output alarm signals to an audible or visual alarm 32, in accordance with the discussion below. An input device 34 can be used to input data including the below-described challenges to the system 10.<br>
Figures 2-4 show the logic that is executed by one or more of the microprocessors 20, 26 as embodied in computer program software. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the flow charts illustrate the structures of logic elements, such as computer program code elements or electronic logic circuits, that function according to this invention. Manifestly, the invention is practiced in its essential embodiment by a machine component that renders the logic elements in a form that instructs a digital processing apparatus (that is. a computer, controller, procer&gt;or, etc.) to perform a sequence o~t function steps corresponding to those shown.<br><br>
In other words, the logic may be embodied by a computer program that is executed &gt;y one or more *j{ the microprocessors 20,26 as a series of computer- or control element-executable instructions-. These instructions, which can be part of the logic module 28, may eside, for example, in RAM or on a hard drive or optical drive, or the instructions may be stored on magnetic tape, electronic read-only memory, or ether appropriate data storage levice that can be dynamically changed or updated.<br>
Commencing at block 36 in Figure 2, the secure stream, also referred to as an mthentication stream, is generated and transmitted by the transmitter 18, preferably ;ontinuously as defined above, within the intended scope of surveillance or observation. In Dne aspect, this secure stream is secure in the sense that it is substantially unpredictable. For instance, the stream may be a cryptographically generated pseudorandom stream. Any lppropriate pseudorandom generator can be used, e.g., block ciphers in counter mode can 3e used, without limitation.<br>
At block 38, the capture device 16 captures the secure stream, which is transmitted ■ o the monitoring location 14 for observation thereof by a remote observer. The observer :an be a person and/or a processor that verifies that the intended scope is being surveilled, based on the secure stream. For instance, a person can view the monitor 30 to determine whether a transmitter 18 that is, for example, an LED, is blinking in accordance with a "correct" sequence of blinks as more fully discussed below in relation to Figures 3 and 4. Or, the microprocessor 26 can process the signal substantially in real time and decode it to verify correctness. If an error is detected at decision diamond 40, the alarm 32 can be activated, and/or other corrective action taken.<br>
The present invention envisions that in one embodiment, the secure signal can be generated in response to a real-time random challenge from the monitoring location 14. Accordingly, at block 44 in Figure 3 the monitoring location 44 can generate a challenge. For example, a person can toggle an input-output device 34 such as a switch in a random pattern of "off" and "on" with the pattern being sent real-time to the secure signal transmitter 18 at block 46 to cause the transmitter 18 to repeat or mirror the challenge or otherwise respond to the challenge in a predetermined manner at block 48. The response to the challenge is transmitted back to r.he monitoring location 14 at block 50. If the secure signal transmitter 18 is an LED in the field of view of the video camera that is generating a video stream of the surveilled location 12, at block 52 the person can observe, using the<br><br>
monitor 30, whether the pattern of "off and "on" toggled in by the person is being properly repeated substantially in reel rime by the LED (or whether other proper responses are observed), to thereby verify that Uie real-time video stream from the surveillance camera is of the intended scope of observation. Alternatively, the processor 34 can automatically generate the challenge to ihe secure signal transmitter 13 and then process the return video stream to determine if the prcner response has been received. As vet another alternative, ihe response can be a digital signature of the challenge.<br>
In contrast to the challenge scheme shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 shows that the secure signal transmitter 18 can generate the secure signal based not on a challenge but on an internal encoding scheme using a pseudorandom seed. As but one example, the secure signal transmitter can use a pseudorandom seed to generate a data stream and modulate the stream with a private cryptographic key of a public/private key pair, and the processor 26 at the monitoring location can use a public key to verify the authentication signal. Or, a private key that is shared between both locations can be used. The capture device itself may digitally sign the captured signal for added security.<br>
Commencing at block 54, the transmitter 18 generates the secure signal using a secret, such as but not limited to the above-mentioned key. The secret can be held in the surveilled location 12 in a tamper-proof enclosure that can contain (or riot) the secure signal transmitter 18. The secure signal is transmitted at block 56 to the monitoring location 14, and at block 58 the monitoring location 14 (e.g., the processor 26 thereat) can use the above-mentioned public (or shared private) key to decode the stream in substantially real time to verify that it is correct and. hence, that the scope of observation being presented in the surveillance stream is the intended (proper) real-time scope. If desired, at block 60 a new random seed can be periodically sent from the monitoring location 14 to the secure signal transmitter 18 to refresh the seed.<br>
Also, for both embodiments shown in Figures 3 and 4, at block 62, the surveillance stream with secure signal stream can be recorded by a trusted observer in real time as it is received by the trusted observer. The trusted observer timestamps the stream and digitally signs it as it is received. Then, the stream can be subsequently analyzed off-line.to determine whether, when it v.-as rt;-:jived real-time by the trusted observer, it was of the proper scope, in accordance with principles above.<br><br>
