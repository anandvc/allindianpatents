				<td>The present invention relates to a device for the quantitative estimation of creatinine.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a device essentially consisting in combination a<br>
novel creatinine reactor and urea bio-sensor, for the quantitative estimation of creatinine.<br>
The present invention more particularly relates to a device for the quantitative estimation of<br>
creatinine having bienzyme reactor with two immobilized enzymes and a urea bio-sensor for<br>
potentiometric estimation of urea.<br>
Creatinine has become an important clinical analyte that is used for the determination<br>
of renal glomerular filtration rate and kidney dys-functioning and muscle disorder. Reference<br>
may be made to (1) K. Spencer, Am. Clin. Biochem., 23 (1986) 1; (2) S. Narayana and H.D.<br>
Appleton, Clin. Chem., 26 (1986) 1119. Creatinine is a byproduct of amino-acid metabolism<br>
and is the energy source for muscle tissue. The reference ranges for serum/plasma crsatinine<br>
and urine creatinine are 35 - 140 uM and 71-265 umokT'Kg"1, respectively, bul during<br>
disorder or disease condition the creatinine level may rise to &gt; 1000 pM. Reference may be<br>
made to (1) N.W. Tietz, Text Book of Clinical Chemistry, Saunders, Philadelphia, 1st Ed.,<br>
1986, 1810; and (2) F. S. Sena, D. Syed, R. B. McComb, Gin. Chem., 34 (1958) 994.<br>
Therefore, the assessment of creatinine levels in human blood or urine becomes cynically<br>
very important, and it is now the most requested analyte in the clinical laboratory.<br>
Spectrophotometric, enzymatic and electrochemical methods are the common<br>
methods for the estimation of creatinine. Reference may be made to (1) M. Jaffe, Z. Physiol.<br>
Chem., 10 (1886) 391; (2) J. A. Weber and A. P. Van. Zanten, Clin. Chem., 37 (1991) 695;<br>
(3) M.T. Joppesen and E. H. Hansen, Anal. Chim. Acta, 214 (1988) 147 and (4) J.K. ;uithony<br>
and R. S. Malcolm, Trends in Biotechnology, 18 (2000) 433.<br>
1. Spectrophotometric Method: In most of the clinical laboratories and almost all the<br>
commercially available analyzers use Spectrophotometric method based on the Jaffe<br>
reaction, in which the active methylene group reacts with alkaline sodium picrate to give<br>
red yellow complex. However, this reaction is not specific for creatinine because many<br>
substances present in bio-fluids could interfere in this assay e.g. cc-ketoacids, amines or<br>
NH4<br>
+, Reference may be made to J. A. Weber and A. P. Van. Zanten, Clin. Chem., 37<br>
(1991) 695 and also the detection level is very poor.<br>
2. Enzymatic Method: Several enzymatic methods (detected Spectrophotometrically) have<br>
been reported to increase specificity/selectivity. However, they are not yet widely used in<br>
clinical laboratories as they are laborious, costly and time consuming. Moreover, :he low<br>
detection limit is another major problem with this method, the reference may be made to<br>
(1) T. Konoshita, Y. Hiraga, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 28 (1980) 3501; and (2) N. Per kis and<br>
C. M. Wolff, Clin. Chem. 30 (1984) 1792.<br>
3. Electrochemical Methods: Recently bio-sensor systems based on electrochemical<br>
methods (amperometric) have been reported which have many advantagi<br>
techniques used to analyse creatinine in the clinical laboratories. They reduce t:<br>
complexity of routine clinical analysis. These sensors are based on either potent!<br>
s over<br>
e time,<br>
Dmetric<br>
or amperometric detection. Each system is characterised by certain advanta<br>
disadvantages. Trends in the literature indicate that the amperometric option is bepoming<br>
more popular and the first system to be successfully commercialised<br>
amperometric device. Reference may be made to, Nova Biomediacl, Rod<br>
Germany. Additionally Abbott Inc. has incorporated creatinine amperometric<br>
into their i-STAT point of care system. Reference may be made to, T. Mock et.a<br>
Biochem., 28 (1995) 187. However, the complicated instrumentation and high co<br>
amperometric detectors are one of the major drawback, over potentiometric detect<br>
The potentiometric detection is mainly based on detection of ammonia, the product of the<br>
enzymatic reaction of creatinine, the reference may be made to W. Matuszewjki, M.<br>
Troganowicz, M.E. Meyerhoff et.al., Electroanalysis, 5 (1993) 113. These potentiometric<br>
sensors are based on NH/ sensing electrodes, which have the major drawback of inter<br>
due to ammonia and several cationic substances. The drawback of these potent<br>
sensors is the low detection limit of creatinine in bio-fluids.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a device for the quantitative<br>
estimation of creatinine which obviates the drawbacks associated with the other<br>
sensors or detectors for creatinine.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device having in combination a<br>

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a device having a sol<br>

Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a device having a solid-state urea<br>
bio-sensor for the indirect detection of creatnine of the order of O.lm M and direct detection<br>
of urea of the order of 10<br>
Further objective of the present invention is to provide a cost effective, sensitive, selective<br>
and reusable device for the quantitative estimation of creatinine.<br>
In the present invention the major drawbacks associated with the<br>
methods/sensors/devices for the estimation of creatinine are minimized by using, two<br>
specific enzymes immobilized creatinine reactor and urea bio-sensor, thus providing the<br>
novel device of the present invention which essentially consists in combination a bi<br>
creatinine reactor and an urea bio-sensor. The output of the bio-sensor and a reference<br>
electrode being connected to a conventional measuring device such as a pH meter.<br>
The present invention describes a device for the quantitative estimation of creatinine based<br>
on bienzyme creatinine reactor and a urea bio-sensor. The estimation of the creatinine is<br>
based on the three enzymes viz. Creatininase, Creatinase and Urease. The enzymes<br>
creatininase and creatinase are immobilised in organically modified sol-gel film of precursor<br>
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 2-(3, 4-epoxycyclohexyl)-ethyltrimethoxysilane at the<br>
bottom of a reactor. The reactor is used for the estimation of the creatinine in the biological<br>
samples by converting creatinine in urea. Further the urea is estimated with a urea sensor<br>
based on urease enzyme, immobilised over a novel solid-state pH electrode. The estimation<br>
of the urea is back calculated for the quantification of creatinine in the sample. The sensor is<br>
sensitive to detect the urea as low as 10 j^M and creatinine up to 0. 1 mM.<br>
In figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification is shown a schemati<br>
device of the present invention. In the said figure 1 the various numbered parts are:<br>
1 . Non-reactive top open reactor.<br>
2. Inert metal plate / foil (mirror polished).<br>
3. Bienzyme with protective layer of sol-gel film.<br>
4. Non-reactive body of urea bio-sensor.<br>
5. Hollow pipe fitted on top of sensor body.<br>
6. Stand connected to hollow pipe (5) for enabling vertical movement.<br>

7. Electrical connection / output of bio-sensor.<br>
8. Conventional measuring device, such as pH meter.<br>

10. Polyaniline electroactive pH sensitive polymer film.<br>
11. Urease enzyme.<br>
12. Sol-gel protective layer<br>
13. Reference electrode (Ag/AgCl).<br>
The non-reactive top open reactor (1) with noble metal plate/foil (2) at bottom is used to<br>
caste a uniform bienzyme film (3) and sol-gel layer (12) is used to protect the enzymes from<br>
air oxidation and deactivation. A solid -state potentiometric urea bio-sensor<br>
(4,5,7,9,10,11,12) based on novel solid-state pH electrode and urease enzyme (11) is used to<br>
detect the urea formed on enzymatic reaction of creatinine with bienzymes cast at the bottom<br>
of the reactor. The urea bio-sensor is a solid-state pH electrode having urease enzyme (II) and<br>
sol-gel (12) layer over polyaniline electroactive pH sensitive film (10). The potential<br>
response of the urea bio-sensor is measured with respect to a standard reference el ectrode<br>
(13) such as Ag/AgCl electrode, calomel electrode, using a potential measuring device (8)<br>
such as a conventional pH meter.<br>
The creatinine reactor of the present invention is developed using two cylindrical p<br>
Teflon (diameter 1.25 inch, length 1.5 inch and 1.0 inch) having a well (internal diameter J/2<br>
inch and depth Vi inch) in one top Teflon cylinder. Both the pieces of Teflon cylinders are<br>
connectable together with a screw arrangement. Before connecting both the Teflon cylinders<br>
a noble metal plate/foil disk (mirror polished) of diameter greater than Vi inch is placed on the<br>
screwed rod of the second piece of Teflon cylinder and screwed in a way to get the metal<br>
plate at the bottom of the top cylinder.<br>
The well of the reactor having metallic bottom is used to cast the mixture of two ejnzymes<br>
of high activity i.e. creatinase/creatine amidinohydrolase 1- 50 mg and creatininase/cr<br>
amidohydrolase 1-50 mg with a protective layer of organically modified sol-gel<br>
precursor 3-aminopropyle triethoxy silane (70 jxl) and 2-(3,4-epoxy cyclo hexyl)-ethyl<br>
trimethoxy silane (20 (il) in 600 \a\ of polyethylene glycol and 5 \i\ of 0.1 M H<br>
enzymes in sol-gel layer are allowed to dry to get a solid layer and the well is<br>
perform the reaction with samples containing creatinine. The two enzymes presen<br>
bottom layer convert the creatinine present in the sample to urea. Further the ure

sample is estimated by a novel urea bio-sensor and creatinine is calculated in terms of urea detected.<br>
The urea bio-sensor of the present invention is developed based on solid-state pH electrode and urease enzyme. The pH electrode is developed based on a neutral (dedoped) polyaniline polymer coated electrochemically using non-aqueous electrolyte of acetonitrile containing aniline monomer and tetraphenyl borate over the noble metal electrode. Further the aqueous solution of urease enzyme (1-50 mg/ml) is immobilized over the polyaniline layer and protected with the sol-gel layer of precursor 3-aminopropyle triethoxy silane (70 JU.1) and 2-(3,4-epoxy cyclo hexyl)-ethyl trimethoxy silane (20 jul) in 600 ul of polyethylene glycol and 5ulof0.1 MHC1.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for the quantitative estimation of creatinine, characterised by combining an inert metal plate/foil bottomed (2) top open non-reactive body (1) bienzyme (3) creatinine reactor, the said reactor comprising of immobilized creatinase/creatine amidinohydrolase enzyme and creatininase/ creatinine amidohydrolase enzyme with a protective organically modified sol-gel layer (12) and a solid-state urea bio¬sensor (4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12) comprising of a non-reactive sensor body (4) having a noble metal plate / foil (9) in contact with modified polyaniline electroactive pH sensitive polymer film (10) coated electrode having immobilized urease enzyme (11) with a protective organically modified sol-gel layer (12), the said noble metal plate/foil (9) being provided with an electrical output connection (7) passing through a stand (6) mounted hollow pipe (5) fixed on top of the said sensor body (4), the said combination of bienzyme reactor and biosensor being provided with a reference electrode (13), the said biosensor electrical output (7) and reference electrode (13) being connected to a potential measuring device(8).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the creatinine reactor is constructed using 1-50 mg creatinase/creatine amidinohydrolase enzyme and 1-50 mg creatininase/creatinine amidohydrolase enzyme over the inert metal plate /foil bottom of the reactor.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the inert metal bottom of the reactor is a plate /foil of platinum, gold, stainless steel or any inert metal.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the non-reactive reactor body is of material such as Teflon, polyvinyl chloride, any plastic material on which enzymes can be immobilized.<br><br>
'drolase<br>
a noble<br>
satmme<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the organically modified sol-gel layer<br>
consists of precursors such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 2-(3,4-epoxycyciohexyl)-<br>
ethyltrimethoxy silane in polyethylene glycol or any other sol-gel precursor or p<br>
alcohol or polyvinyl chloride or any other protective polymer capable of forming solid and<br>
stable permeable film.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the piesent invention the urea bio-sensor is constructed using<br>
urease enzyme 1-50 mg/ ml over a modified polyaniline electroactive pH sensitive polyrner film<br>
coated electrode.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the pH sensitive polymer layer<br>
electrochemically or chemically formed polyaniline electroactive polymer doped film<br>
through organic or aqueous solvent.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the polyaniline electroactive polyrner film<br>
is doped with tetraphenylborate, perchlorate or any other soluble organic or inorganic salts<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the reference electrode is such as Ag/AgCl<br>
electrode, calomel electrode or any other commercially available reference electrode.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the electrical output (7) with respect to the<br>
reference electrode (13) being connected to a potential measuring device (8), such as a<br>
conventional pH meter.<br>
In the present invention the estimation of the creatinine is based on the three enzyijnes viz.<br>
Creatininase, Creatinase and Urease as shown below :<br>
Creatininase or<br>
Creatinine [ O=j NH ] + H2O ^  Creatine -1<br>
 = NH creatinine amidohydrolase<br>
N<br>
CH3<br>
Creatinase<br>
Creatine [H2NC(==NH)N(CH3)CH2COOH] + H2O « Sarcosine + Uria - 2<br>
creatine amidinohydrolase<br>
lyvinyl<br>
used is<br>
Urease<br>
Urea [NH2CONH2] + H2O 
+ -3<br>
In the reactor the two enzymes creatinase and creatininase immobilized in sol-gel film are<br>
cast at the metallic bottom of the reactor. When the sample containing creatinine is placed in<br>
the well the first two reactions take place in the reactor and urea formed as a final product as<br>
shown above. The urea so formed can be detected by the urea sensor based on polvaniline<br>
sensitive pH electrode as shown in the third reaction. The creatinine is nearly conveited into<br>
urea after placing the sample in the reactor for a sufficient time (15 minutes). The total<br>
volume is made up to 2 ml with tris-HCl buffer (ImM, pH 7.0). The urea is measured by urea<br>
bio-sensor along with Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Taking the known amount of creatinine<br>
in the reactor for a definite time period and then measuring the urea formed in that time<br>
period, a calibration curve can be plotted for creatinine.<br>
The pH electrode is tested before construction of the urea bio-sensor by estimat<br>
and base. The urea bio-sensor is also calibrated before taking any measurements.<br>
The novelty lies in the combination of bienzyme reactor, polvaniline solid-s<br>
electrode based urea bio-sensor to function as a device for the estimation of creatn<br>
first time a compact arrangement of bienzyme reactor, urea bio-sensor along with reference<br>
electrode, in combination, for measurement of creatinine is used as shown in figure-1 of the<br>
drawings.<br>
The non-obvious inventive steps to achieve the novelty, as stated above, residels in the<br>
constructional features of the bienzyme reactor and urea biosensor and combination thereof.<br>
The novel pH electrode is first time developed using a polyaniline electroactive<br>
conducting polymer synthesised from non-aqueous electrolyte using tetraphenylborate as<br>
supporting electrolyte. The urea bio-sensor based on pH electrode is unique, where urease<br>
ng acid<br>
ate pH<br>
ne. The<br>
enzyme is immobilised in a sandwich configuration between pH sensitive polyani ine and<br>
protective organically sol-gel film. The stability and sensitivity of the bio-sensor enhanced<br>
many fold in such type of configuration.<br>
The invention is further illustrated with the help of the following examples and tierefore<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
Example 1<br>
Development of Urea Bio-Sensor:<br>
Polyaniline was potentiostatically coated over Pt-disk electrode (2mm diameter) using<br>
non-aqueous electrolyte of acetonitrile containing 0.5 M aniline monomer and 0.5 M<br>
tetraphenylborate at 2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Polyaniline coated electrode was washed in<br>
acetonitrile and incubated in 0.1 M HC1 to get the pH sensitive electrode. pH sensitivity was<br>
tested at pH ranging from 2 to 10 and a linear plot of potential vs. H ion concentration was<br>
obtained between 3 to 9 as shown in figure-2 of the drawings accompanying this<br>
specification.<br>
Electrode was washed thoroughly in tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) and then urease enzyme was<br>
immobilized on the polymer film by pouring 50 ^1 of urease aqueous solution (10 rag/ml) in<br>
ImM tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) on the polymer film and allowed to dry for 10 hours at 4°C .<br>
Finally 50 \jd of sol-gel film was casted from its typical composition as described below:<br>
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (70 ul) and 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-ethyltrimetho&gt;cysilane<br>
(20 ul) in 600 (4.1 of polyethylene glycol and 5 |al of 0.1 M HC1 was cast over th; urease<br>
immobilized electrode and dried for 20 hours. Resultant bio-sensor was incubated in ImM<br>
trib-HCl buffer for 2 hrs and used for the detection of urea in the solution.<br>
Potential response was recorded in potentiometric cell of working volume of 2 ml of ImM<br>
tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) using bio-sensor electrode with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (with<br>
cell assembly reference electrode/test solution/urea bio-sensor). At the steady-state potential,<br>
varying concentrations of the aqueous urea solution were injected into the cell and the new<br>
steady-state potential was recorded as shown in figure-3 of the drawings accompanying this<br>
specification. A calibration curve was plotted for potential responses vs. urea concentrations.<br>
A linear response was observed with the 10 joM detection limit of the urea as siown in<br>
figure-4 of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
Example 2<br>
Estimation of Creatinine using bienzyme reactor and Urea Bio-Sensor:<br>
Creatinase/creatine amidinohydrolase 20 mg and creatininase/creatinine amidohydrolase<br>
20 mg, immobilized in organically modified sol-gel film of precursor 3-an,in Dpropyltriethoxysilane<br>
(70 jal) and 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-ethyltrimethoxysilane (20 |il) in 600 \JLof polyethylene glycol and 5 (4.1 of 0.1 M HC1. 100|j.l above solution was casted in the reactor<br>
9<br>
and allowed to dry for 20 hours at room temperature. A solid layer formed at the bottom of<br>
the reactor. A known concentration (0.1 mM) of creatinine sample 600 ^1 was take)n in the<br>
sample and allowed to stay for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes 500 ul was taken and injected<br>
into the potentiometric cell. Volume was increased to 2 ml with 1 mM tris-HCl (pH=7) and<br>
solid-state urea bio-sensor along with Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used to estiijnate the<br>
urea as described above in example-1..The potential response was directly plotted against the<br>
creatinine concentration. Similarly three higher concentrations of creatinine samples (0.5<br>
mM, 1 mM and 10 mM) were added and the response was plotted as shown in figure-5. A<br>
calibration curved for creatinine was plotted against potential response and log concentration,<br>
as shown in figure-6. A linear response was obtained with the lowest detection limit of 0.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. It is easy to make and cost effective device.<br>
2. It is a non-hazardous device for the detection of creatinine.<br>
3. Creatinine can be quantified in biological samples without any interference<br>
chemicals or ions.<br>
4. Creatinine can be detected up to 0.1 mM in aqueous samples.<br>
