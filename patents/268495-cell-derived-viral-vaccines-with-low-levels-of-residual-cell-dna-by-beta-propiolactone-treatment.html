TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention provides improved cell culture products and processes with reduced impurities.<br>
Specifically, the invention provides an improved method of degrading any residual functional cell<br>
culture DNA remaining associated with the cell culture generated product. According to the<br>
invention, residual functional cell culture DNA is degraded by treatment with a DNA alkylating<br>
agent, such as p-propiolactone (BPL). This process may be used to treat a range of cell culture<br>
products including vaccines and recombinant proteins.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Commercial production of viral vaccines typically require large quantities of virus as an antigen<br>
source. Commercial quantities of virus for vaccine production may be achieved by culture and<br>
replication of a seed virus in a cell culture system. Cell culture systems suitable for viral replication<br>
include mammalian, avian or insect cells, but mammalian cell culture systems are particularly<br>
preferred for viral vaccines to ensure proper glycosylation and folding of the virus' antigens proteins.<br>
For similar reasons, mammalian cell culture systems are also preferred for recombinant protein<br>
expression.<br>
If unmodified from their naturally occurring states, cell cultures have a limited ability to reproduce,<br>
and subsequently are impractical and inefficient for producing the amount of material necessary for a<br>
commercial vaccine or recombinant protein. Consequently, for manufacturing purposes, it is<br>
preferred that the cells are modified to be "continuous" or "immortalized" cell lines to increase the<br>
number of times they can divide. Many of these modifications employ mechanisms similar to those<br>
which are implicated in oncogenic cells. As such, there is a concern that any residual materials from<br>
the cell culture process, such as host cell DNA, be removed from the final formulation of a vaccine<br>
or recombinant protein product manufactured in these systems.<br>
A standard way of removing residual host cell DNA is by DNase treatment. A convenient method of<br>
this type is disclosed in European patent 0870508 and US patent 5948410, involving a two-step<br>
treatment, first using a DNase (e.g. Benzonase) and then a cationic detergent (e.g. CTAB).<br>
Current efforts to reduce this risk have focused on reducing the total concentration of residual host<br>
cell DNA. It is an object of the present invention to reduce the risk further by eliminating the<br>
functionality of any remaining host cell DNA.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides improved cell culture products and processes with reduced impurities.<br>
Specifically, the invention provides an improved method of degrading any residual functional cell<br>
culture DNA remaining associated with the cell culture generated product. According to the<br>
invention, residual functional cell culture DNA is degraded by treatment with a DNA alkylating<br><br>
agent, such as -propiolactone (BPL). This process may be used to treat a range of cell culture<br>
products including vaccines and recombinant proteins.<br>
The invention includes a vaccine comprising immunogenic proteins derived from a virus propagated<br>
on cell culture, wherein the vaccine is substantially tree of residual functional cell culture DNA. In<br>
addition, the invention relates to recombinant proteins expressed in cell culture, where the final<br>
recombinant protein formulation is substantially free of residual functional cell culture DNA.<br>
Functionality of any residual host cell DNA may be eliminated by treatment of the DNA with an<br>
alkylating agent which cleaves the DNA into portions small enough so that it is unable to code for a<br>
functional protein, to be transposed into a human recipient's chromosome, or otherwise recognized<br>
by recipient DNA replication machinery. Preferably, the length of degraded residual cell culture<br>
DNA is less than 500 base pairs. More preferably, the length of degraded residual cell culture DNA<br>
is less than 200 base pairs.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention provides improved cell culture products and processes with reduced impurities.<br>
Specifically, the invention provides an improved method of degrading any residual functional cell<br>
culture DNA remaining associated with the cell culture generated product. According to the<br>
invention, residual functional cell culture DNA is degraded by treatment with a DNA alkylating<br>
agent, such as P-propiolactone (BPL). This process may be used to treat a range of cell culture<br>
products including vaccines and recombinant proteins.<br>
The invention includes a vaccine comprising immunogenic proteins derived from a virus propagated<br>
on cell culture, wherein the vaccine is substantially free of residual functional cell culture DNA. In<br>
addition, the invention relates to recombinant proteins expressed in cell culture, where the final<br>
recombinant protein formulation is substantially free of residual functional cell culture DNA.<br>
Functionality of any residual host cell DNA may be eliminated by treatment of the DNA with an<br>
alkylating agent which cleaves the DNA into portions small enough so that it is unable to code for a<br>
functional protein, to be transposed into a human recipient's chromosome, or otherwise be<br>
recognized by recipient DNA replication machinery. The length of degraded (non-functional)<br>
residual cell culture DNA is preferably less than 1000 base pairs (e.g. less than 1000, 800, 700, 600,<br>
500, 400, 300, 200, 150, 100, 75, or 50 base pairs). Preferably, the length of degraded residual cell<br>
culture DNA is less than 500 base pairs. More preferably, the length of degraded residual cell culture<br>
DNA is less than 200 base pairs.<br>
As used herein, reference to "functional DNA" or "functional RNA" indicates a nucleotide sequence<br>
capable of being translated into a functional protein or transposed into a mammalian chromosome.<br>
Generally, nucleotide sequences capable of being translated to a functional protein require promoter<br>
regions, start codons, stop codons, and internal coding sequences for functional proteins. Where<br>
DNA damage occurs, as from addition of an alkylating agent, many of these regions are altered or<br><br>
destroyed, such that translation can longer proceed or only proceeds to form an oligopeptide subunit<br>
of the intended protein.<br>
"Degraded residual functional cell culture DNA" refers to functional DNA that cannot be translated<br>
into a functional protein or transposed into a mammalian chromosome. Preferably, "degraded<br>
residual functional DNA" has a length of less than 1000 base pairs, more preferably less than 500<br>
base pairs, even more preferably less than 250 base pairs, and most preferably less than 100 base<br>
pairs. The length of the degraded residual functional DNA can be determined by standard techniques,<br>
including gel electrophoresis.<br>
The invention provides for vaccine compositions and recombinant protein formulations which are<br>
substantially free of residual functional cell culture DNA. As used herein, substantially free of<br>
residual functional cell culture DNA refers to a composition or formulation where residual DNA<br>
fragments of less than 200 basepairs are detectable at less than 10 ng per 0.5 ml. The size of any<br>
residual cell culture DNA may be measured by standard techniques, including capillary gel<br>
electrophoresis and nucleic acid amplification technology.<br>
The use of an alkylating agent such as BPL in the invention provides the additional benefit of<br>
reducing aggregation and contaminants. Vaccine formulations with reduced aggregates may also<br>
have improved immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of a vaccine relies upon specificity of antibodies<br>
for particular viral epitopes. If the surface of a protein is bound or masked by unwanted molecules or<br>
hidden through aggregation in large macromolecules, the epitopes may become less recognizable and<br>
therefore less efficacious in a vaccine. In addition, vaccine formulations with reduced aggregates<br>
may have additional processing advantages. Purification processes rely upon isolation of the<br>
expected protein, for example hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in an influenza vaccine. If the<br>
protein is structurally modified by the presence of aggregates or cross-linking it may not be<br>
recognized and subsequently removed by column chromatography, filtration, or centrifugation.<br>
Alkylating agents<br>
Alkylating agents for use in the invention include substances that introduce an alkyl radical into a<br>
compound. Preferably, the alkylating agent is a monoalkylating agent, such as BPL. BPL is a<br>
monoalkylating agent widely used for inactivation of viruses in the preparation of many vaccines.<br>
BPL reacts with various biological molecules including nucleic acids where it causes structural<br>
modification by alkylation and depurination. BPL is generally represented by the following structure:<br><br>
In vitro, BPL generally reacts with nucleophiles present in high concentrations, under conditions<br>
favorable to nucleophilic substitution reactions - as in high heat, high BPL concentrations, and<br>
aprotic polar solvents - to form functionalized propionic acids, such as 7-(2-carboxyethyl)guanine or<br>
l-(2-carboxyethyl)deoxyadenosine (Scheme 1). Boutwell et al. Annals New York Academy of<br><br>
Sciences, 751-764; Perrin et al. Biologicals, 23 (1995) 207-211; Chen et al. Carcinogenesis, 2(2)<br>
(1981)73-80.<br>
Scheme 1 (from Chen et al.):<br><br>
Such binding or alkylating of DNA bases induces mutagenicity by a number of mechanisms<br>
including base pair substitutions, especially depurination, deletions, and cross linking of nucleosides.<br>
The high degree of mutagenicity and reactivity of BPL corresponds to rapid viral killing and<br>
subsequent DNA degradation to non-carcinogenic by-products.<br>
Any residual functional cell culture DNA is degraded by treatment with less than 1% BPL (e.g. less<br>
than 1%, 0.75%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.075%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.01%, or 0.005%). Preferably,<br>
residual functional cell culture DNA is degraded by treatment with between 0.1% and 0.01% BPL.<br>
The alkylating agent is preferably added to a buffered solution and the pH of the solution is<br>
preferably maintained between 5 and 10. More preferably the pH of the solution is maintained<br>
between 6 and 9. Even more preferably the pH of the solution is maintained between 7 and 8.<br>
In some methods, the alkylating agent is added more than once. For instance, a first BPL treatment<br>
may be performed and then a second BPL treatment may be performed. Between the first and second<br>
treatments there may be an alkylating agent removal step, but the alkylating agent may be added for<br>
the second treatment without removing any alkylating agent remaining from the first treatment.<br>
Preferably, the alkylating agent is also used as the inactivating agent for the virus used in the vaccine.<br>
The alkylating agents of the invention are preferred over traditional inactivating agents, such as<br>
formaldehyde, which can cross-link proteins to other material, including host cell DNA. Such cross-<br>
linking can lead to the formation of aggregates (such as protein-protein conglomerates, nucleotide<br>
combinations, and protein-nucleotide combinations). Because alkylating agents, such as BPL, do not<br>
rely on such cross-linking mechanisms for viral inactivation, use of such alkylating agents for viral<br>
inactivation minimizes the formation of aggregates and other impurities in the vaccine product. Such<br>
aggregates may comprises proteins ionically or covalently bound to other proteins, proteins ionically<br>
or covalently bound to other nucleotides, and/or nucleotides ionically or covalently bound to other<br>
nucleotides.<br>
As used herein, reference to "aggregation" or "an aggregate" indicates a mass or body of individual<br>
units or particles bound together to create larger groups or particles. Aggregation can be generally be<br>
determined by quantitative measurements of the desired components before and after a possible<br>
aggregating step or before and after application of an aggregate-disrupting method (e.g. by detergent<br><br>
treatment), by gel electrophoresis (such as Laemmli's system), chromatography, solution turbidity, or<br>
sedimentation studies and other methods well known in the art.<br>
Treatment with the alkylating agent, particularly with BPL, may involve phases with different<br>
temperatures. For instance, there may be a first phase at a low temperature (e.g. at between 2-8°C,<br>
such as about 4°C) and a second phase at a higher temperature, typically at least 10°C higher than the<br>
first phase (e.g. at between 25-50°C, such as about 37°C). This two-phase process is particularly<br>
useful where the alkylating agent is being used for both inactivation and DNA degradation. In a<br>
typical scheme, virus inactivation occurs during the lower temperature phase, and DNA degradation<br>
occurs during the higher temperature phase. As described in more detail below, an increased<br>
temperature can also facilitate removal of a heat-sensitive alkylating reagent.<br>
Immunogenic proteins<br>
Immunogenic proteins suitable for use in the invention may be derived from any virus which is the<br>
target of a vaccine. The immunogenic proteins may be formulated as inactivated (or killed) virus,<br>
attenuated virus, split virus formulations, purified subunit formulations, viral proteins which are<br>
isolated, purified or derived from a virus, and virus like particles (VLPs).<br>
The immunogenic proteins of the invention are viral antigens which preferably include epitopes<br>
which are exposed on the surface of the virus during at least one stage of its life cycle. The viral<br>
antigens are preferably conserved across multiple serotypes or isolates. The viral antigens include<br>

examples identified below. Viruses may be non-enveloped or, preferably, enveloped. Viruses are<br>

antigens may be selected from glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gH, fusion protein (gB), or immune<br>
escape proteins (gC, gE, or gl). VZV antigens may be selected from core, nucleocapsid, tegument, or<br>
envelope proteins. A live attenuated VZV vaccine is commercially available. EBV antigens may be<br>
selected from early antigen (EA) proteins, viral capsid antigen (VCA), and glycoproteins of the<br>
membrane antigen (MA). CMV antigens may be selected from capsid proteins, envelope<br>
glycoproteins (such as gB and gH), and tegument proteins.<br>
Papovaviruses: Antigens may be derived from Papovaviruses, such as Papillomaviruses and<br>
Polyomaviruses. Papillomaviruses include HPV serotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35,<br>
39, 41, 42, 47, 51, 57, 58, 63 and 65. Preferably, HPV antigens are derived from serotypes 6,11, 16<br>
or 18. HPV antigens may be selected from capsid proteins (L1) and (L2), or E1 - E7, or fusions<br>
thereof. HPV antigens are preferably formulated into virus-like particles (VLPs). Polyomyavirus<br><br>
viruses include BK virus and JK virus. Polyomavirus antigens may be selected from VP1, VP2 or<br>
VP3.<br>
Further provided are viral antigens described in Vaccines, 4th Edition (Plotkin and Orenstein ed.<br>
2004); Medical Microbiology 4th Edition (Murray et al. ed. 2002); Virology, 3rd Edition (W.K. Joklik<br>
ed. 1988); Fundamental Virology, 2nd Edition (B.N. Fields and D.M. Knipe, eds. 1991), which are<br>
contemplated in conjunction with the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Immunogenic proteins suitable for use in the invention may be derived from a virus which causes<br>
respiratory disease. Examples of such respiratory antigens include proteins derived from a respiratory<br>
virus such as Orthomyxoviruses (influenza), Pneumovirus (RSV), Paramyxovirus (PIV),<br>
Morbillivirus (measles), Togavirus (Rubella), VZV, and Coronavirus (SARS). Immunogenic proteins<br>
derived from influenza virus are particularly preferred.<br>
The compositions of the invention may include one or more immunogenic proteins suitable for use in<br>
pediatric subjects. Pediatric subjects are typically less than about 3 years old, or less than about 2<br>
years old, or less than about 1 years old. Pediatric antigens may be administered multiple times over<br>
the course of 6 months, 1, 2 or 3 years. Pediatric antigens may be derived from a virus which may<br>
target pediatric populations and/or a virus from which pediatric populations are susceptible to<br>
infection. Pediatric viral antigens include antigens derived from one or more of Orthomyxovirus<br>
(influenza), Pneumovirus (RSV), Paramyxovirus (PIV and Mumps), Morbillivirus (measles),<br>
Togavirus (Rubella), Enterovirus (polio), HBV, Coronavirus (SARS), and Varicella-zoster virus<br>
(VZV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV).<br>
The compositions of the invention may include one or more immunogenic proteins suitable for use in<br>
elderly or immunocompromized individuals. Such individuals may need to be vaccinated more<br>
frequently, with higher doses or with adjuvanted formulations to improve their immune response to<br>
the targeted antigens. Antigens which may be targeted for use in Elderly or Immunocompromized<br>
individuals include antigens derived from one or more of the following viruses: Orthomyxovirus<br>
(influenza), Pneumovirus (RSV), Paramyxovirus (PIV and Mumps), Morbillivirus (measles),<br>
Togavirus (Rubella), Enterovirus (polio), HBV, Coronavirus (SARS), Varicella-zoster virus (VZV),<br>
Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and Cytomegalovirus (CMV).<br>
After growing viruses, the aklylating agent may be used on purified virions e.g. on virions present in<br>
a clarified cell culture, or on virions purified from such a clarified cell culture. A method of the<br>
invention may involve removing cellular material by clarification, and then purification of virions<br>
from the clarified cell culture e.g. by chromatography. The alkylating agent maybe used on virions<br>
purified in this manner, or after a further optional step of ultrafiltration/diafiltration. Preferred<br>
methods use the aklylating agent not on the clarified supernatant of an infected cell culture, but on<br>
virions purified from such a clarified supernatant (cf. Morgeaux et al. (1993) Vaccine 11:82-90).<br>
The aklylating agent is preferably used after a step of endotoxin removal has taken place.<br><br>
Method steps<br>
The vaccine compositions of the invention may be prepared by isolation of the immunogenic protein<br>
and degradation of residual functional host cell DNA. Similarly, recombinant protein formulations<br>
may be prepared by isolation or purification of the recombinant protein and degradation of residual<br>
functional host cell DNA. These steps may be carried out sequentially or simultaneously. The step of<br>
degrading residual functional cell culture DNA is done by addition of an alkylating agent e.g. BPL.<br>
The alkylating agent and any residual side products are preferably removed prior to the final<br>
formulation of the vaccine or recombinant protein. Preferably, the vaccine composition or<br>
recombinant protein formulation contains less than 0.1% free propionic acid and BPL combined<br>
{e.g. less than 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.01%, 0.005%, 0.001%, or 0.01%. Preferably, the final<br>
vaccine composition or recombinant protein formulation contains less than 0.01% BPL.<br>
BPL can conveniently be removed by heating, to cause hydrolysis into the non-toxic<br>
P-hydroxypropionic acid. The length of time required for hydrolysis depends on the total amount of<br>
BPL and the temperature. Higher temperatures given more rapid hydrolysis, but the temperature<br>
should not be raized so high as to damage the active proteinaceous ingredients. As described below,<br>
heating to about 37°C for 2-2.5 hours is suitable for removing BPL.<br>
After treatment of DNA, the residual DNA products may be retained in the final immunogenic or<br>
recombinant composition. More preferably, however, they are separated from desired components<br>
e.g. separated from virions/proteins. Separation in this way may remove DNA degradation products<br>
in part or in full, and preferably removes any degraded DNA that is &gt;200bp. Thus a method of the<br>
invention may include a step of separating DNA from virions. This separation step may involve e.g.<br>
one or more of ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation (including gradient ultracentrifugation), virus core<br>
pelleting and supernatant fractionation, chromatography (such as ion exchange chromatography e.g.<br>
anion exchange), adsorption, etc.<br>
Overall, therefore, a method may involve treatment with an alkylating agent to degrade the length of<br>
residual DNA, and later purification to remove residual DNA (including removal of degraded DNA).<br>
Cell culture<br>
Vaccines of the invention are prepared from viruses which are propagated on cell culture. In<br>
addition, the invention includes formulations of recombinant proteins expressed in cell culture.<br>
Mammalian cell cultures are preferred for both viral replication and recombinant protein expression.<br>
A number of mammalian cell lines are known in the art and include cell lines derived from human or<br>
non-human primate {e.g. monkey) cells {e.g. PER.C6 cells which are described, for example, in<br>
WO01/38362, WO01/41814, WO02/40665, WO2004/056979, and WO2005/080556, incorporated<br>
by reference herein in their entireties, as well as deposited under ECACC deposit number 96022940),<br>
MRC-5 (ATCC CCL-171), WI-38 (ATCC CCL-75), HEK cells, HeLa cells, fetal rhesus lung cells<br>
(ATCC CL-160), human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells, typically transformed by sheared<br><br>
adenovirus type 5 DNA), Vero cells (from monkey kidneys), horse, cow (e.g. MDBK cells), sheep,<br>
dog (e.g. MDCK cells from dog kidneys, ATCC CCL34 MDCK (NBL2) or MDCK 33016, deposit<br>
number DSM ACC 2219 as described in WO 97/37000 and WO 97/37001), cat, and rodent (e.g.<br>
hamster cells, such as BHK21-F, HKCC cells, or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells), and may be<br>
obtained from a wide variety of developmental stages, including for example, adult, neonatal, fetal,<br>
and embryo.<br>
Suitable monkey cells are e.g. African green monkey cells, such as kidney cells as in the Vero cell<br>
line. Suitable dog cells are e.g. kidney cells, as in the MDCK cell line. Thus suitable cell lines<br>
include, but are not limited to: MDCK; CHO; 293T; BHK; Vero; MRC-5; PER.C6; WI-38; etc. The<br>
use of mammalian cells means that vaccines can be free from materials such as chicken DNA, egg<br>
proteins (such as ovalbumin and ovomucoid), etc., thereby reducing allergenicity.<br>
In certain embodiments the cells are immortalized (e.g. PER.C6 cells; ECACC 96022940). In<br>
preferred embodiments, mammalian cells are utilized, and may be selected from and/or derived from<br>
one or more of the following non-limiting cell types: fibroblast cells (e.g. dermal, lung), endothelial<br>
cells (e.g. aortic, coronary, pulmonary, vascular, dermal microvascular, umbilical), hepatocytes,<br>
keratinocytes, immune cells (e.g. T cell, B cell, macrophage, NK, dendritic), mammary cells<br>
(e.g. epithelial), smooth muscle cells (e.g. vascular, aortic, coronary, arterial, uterine, bronchial,<br>
cervical, retinal pericytes), melanocytes, neural cells (e.g. astrocytes), prostate cells (e.g. epithelial,<br>
smooth muscle), renal or kidney cells (e.g. epithelial, mesangial, proximal tubule), skeletal cells (e.g.<br>
chondrocyte, osteoclast, osteoblast), muscle cells (e.g. myoblast, skeletal, smooth, bronchial), liver<br>
cells, retinal cells or retinoblasts, lung cells, and stromal cells.<br>
WO97/37000 and WO97/37001 describe production of animal cells and cell lines that capable of<br>
growth in suspension and in serum free media and are useful in the production and replication of<br>
viruses, particularly influenza virus. Further details are given in WO03/023021 and WO03/023025.<br>
Preferred mammalian cell lines for growing influenza viruses include: MDCK cells, derived from<br>
Madin Darby canine kidney; Vero cells, derived from African green monkey (Cercopithecus<br>
aethiops) kidney; or PER.C6 cells, derived from human embryonic retinoblasts. These cell lines are<br>
widely available e.g. from the American Type Cell Culture (ATCC) collection, from the Coriell Cell<br>
Repositories, or from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). For example, the ATCC<br>
supplies various different Vero cells under catalog numbers CCL-81, CCL-81.2, CRL-1586 and<br>
CRL-1587, and it supplies MDCK cells under catalog number CCL-34. PER.C6 is available from the<br>
ECACC under deposit number 96022940.<br>
The most preferred cell lines for growing influenza viruses are MDCK cell lines. The original<br>
MDCK cell line is available from the ATCC as CCL-34, but derivatives of this cell line may also be<br>
used. For instance, WO97/37000 discloses a MDCK cell line that was adapted for growth in<br>
suspension culture ('MDCK 33016', deposited as DSM ACC 2219). Similarly, EP-A-1260581<br>
(WOO 1/64846) discloses a MDCK-derived cell line that grows in suspension in serum-free culture<br><br>
OB-702', deposited as FERM BP-7449). WO2006/071563 discloses non-tumorigenic MDCK cells,<br>
including 'MDCK-S' (ATCC PTA-6500), 'MDCK-SF101' (ATCC PTA-6501), 'MDCK-SF102'<br>
(ATCC PTA-6502) and 'MDCK-SF103' (PTA-6503). WO2005/113758 discloses MDCK cell lines<br>
with high susceptibility to infection, including 'MDCK.5F1' cells (ATCC CRL-12042). Any of these<br>
MDCK cell lines can be used.<br>
Manipulation of MDCK cell cultures in suspension and adherent cultures is described in<br>
WO97/37000, WO97/37001, WO03/023021, and WO03/023025. In particular, WO 03/023021 and<br>
WO 03/023025 describe laboratory and commercial scale cell culture volumes of MDCK suspension<br>
cells in serum-free media, chemically defined media, and protein free media. Each reference is<br>
incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
As an alternative to mammalian sources, cell lines for use in the invention may be derived from avian<br>
sources such as chicken, duck, goose, quail or pheasant. Avian cell lines may be derived from a<br>
variety of developmental stages including embryonic, chick and adult. Preferably, the cell lines are<br>
derived from the embryonic cells, such as embryonic fibroblasts, germ cells, or individual organs,<br>
including neuronal, brain, retina, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, or extraembryonic tissues and<br>
membranes protecting the embryo. Examples of avian cell lines include avian embryonic stem cells<br>
(WO01/85938 and WO03/076601) and duck retina cells (WO2005/042728). Suitable, avian<br>
embryonic stem cells, include the EBx cell line derived from chicken embryonic stem cells, EB45,<br>
EB14, and EB14-074 (WO2006/108846). Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) may also be used.<br>
These avian cells are particularly suitable for growing influenza viruses.<br>
Insect cell expression systems, such as baculovirus recombinant expression systems, are known to<br>
those of skill in the art and described in, e.g., Summers and Smith, Texas Agricultural Experiment<br>
Station Bulletin No. 1555 (1987). Materials and methods for baculovirus/insert cell expression<br>
systems are commercially available in kit form from, inter alia, Invitrogen, San Diego CA. Insect<br>
cells for use with baculovirus expression vectors include, inter alia, Aedes aegypti, Autographa<br>
californica, Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Spodoptera frugiperda, and Trichoplusia ni.<br>
Recombinant expression of proteins may also be conducted in bacterial hosts such as Escherichia<br>
coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus spp.. Yeast hosts suitable for recombinant expression of<br>
proteins include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Candida maltosa, Hansenual<br>
polymorpha, Kluyveromyces jragilis, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia guillerimondii, Pichia pastoris,<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Yarrowia lipolytica.<br>
Culture conditions for the above cell types are well-described in a variety of publications, or<br>
alternatively culture medium, supplements, and conditions may be purchased commercially, such as<br>
for example, as described in the catalog and additional literature of Cambrex Bioproducts (East<br>
Rutherford, NJ).<br><br>
In certain embodiments, the host cells used in the methods described herein are cultured in serum<br>
free and/or protein free media. A medium is referred to as a serum-free medium in the context of the<br>
present invention in which there are no additives from serum of human or animal origin. Protein-free<br>
is understood to mean cultures in which multiplication of the cells occurs with exclusion of proteins,<br>
growth factors, other protein additives and non-serum proteins, but can optionally include proteins<br>
such as trypsin or other proteases that may be necessary for viral growth. The cells growing in such<br>
cultures naturally contain proteins themselves.<br>
Known serum-free media include Iscove's medium, Ultra-CHO medium (BioWhittaker) or<br>
EX-CELL (JRH Bioscience). Ordinary serum-containing media include Eagle's Basal Medium<br>
(BME) or Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Eagle, Science, 130, 432 (1959)) or Dulbecco's<br>
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM or EDM), which are ordinarily used with up to 10% fetal calf<br>
serum or similar additives. Optionally, Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Eagle, Science, 130,<br>
432 (1959)) or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM or EDM) may be used without any<br>
serum containing supplement. Protein-free media like PF-CHO (JHR Bioscience), chemically-<br>
defined media like ProCHO 4CDM (BioWhittaker) or SMIF 7 (Gibco/BRL Life Technologies) and<br>
mitogenic peptides like Primactone, Pepticase or HyPep™ (all from Quest International) or<br>
lactalbumin hydrolyzate (Gibco and other manufacturers) are also adequately known in the prior art.<br>
The media additives based on plant hydrolyzates have the special advantage that contamination with<br>
viruses, mycoplasma or unknown infectious agents can be ruled out.<br>
Cell culture conditions (temperature, cell density, pH value, etc.) are variable over a very wide range<br>
owing to the suitability of the cell line employed according to the invention and can be adapted to the<br>
requirements of particular virus growth conditions or recombinant expression details.<br>
Cells may be grown in various ways e.g. in suspension, in adherent culture, on microcarriers.<br>
Cells may be grown below 37°C (e.g. 30-36°C) during viral replication (WO97/37001).<br>
The method for propagating virus in cultured cells generally includes the steps of inoculating the<br>
cultured cells with the strain to be cultured, cultivating the infected cells for a desired time period for<br>
virus propagation, such as for example as determined by virus titer or antigen expression (e.g.<br>
between 24 and 168 hours after inoculation) and collecting the propagated virus. The cultured cells<br>
may be inoculated with a virus (measured by PFU or TCID50) to cell ratio of 1:500 to 1:1, preferably<br>
1:100 to 1:5, more preferably 1:50 to 1:10. The virus can be added to a suspension of the cells or<br>
applied to a monolayer of the cells, and the virus is absorbed on the cells for at least 60 minutes but<br>
usually less than 300 minutes, preferably between 90 and 240 minutes at 25°C to 40°C, preferably<br>
28°C to 37°C.<br>
The infected cell culture (e.g. monolayers) may be removed either by freeze-thawing or by enzymatic<br>
action to increase the viral content of the harvested culture supernatants. The harvested fluids are<br>
then either inactivated or stored frozen. Cultured cells may be infected at a multiplicity of infection<br><br>
("m.o.i.") of about 0.0001 to 10, preferably 0.002 to 5, more preferably to 0.001 to 2. Still more<br>
preferably, the cells are infected at a m.o.i of about 0.01. Infected cells may be harvested 30 to 60<br>
hours post infection. Preferably, the cells are harvested 34 to 48 hours post infection. Still more<br>
preferably, the cells are harvested 38 to 40 hours post infection. Proteases (typically trypsin) are<br>
generally added during cell culture to allow viral release, and the proteases can be added at any<br>
suitable stage during the culture.<br>
The vaccine compositions of the invention will generally be formulated in a sub-virion form e.g. in<br>
the form of a split virus, where the viral lipid envelope has been dissolved or disrupted, or in the<br>
form of one or more purified viral proteins. The vaccine composition will contain a sufficient amount<br>
of the antigen(s) to produce an immunological response in the patient<br>
Methods of splitting viruses, such as influenza viruses, are well known in the art e.g. see<br>
WO02/28422, WO02/067983, WO02/074336, WO01/21151, etc. Splitting of the virus is carried out<br>
by disrupting or fragmenting whole virus, whether infectious (wild-type or attenuated) or non-<br>
infectious (e.g. inactivated), with a disrupting concentration of a splitting agent. Splitting agents<br>
generally include agents capable of breaking up and dissolving lipid membranes, typically with a<br>
hydrophobic tail attached to a hydrophilic head. The most preferred splitting agent is<br>
cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB). Further details of splitting are given below in the context:<br>
of influenza viruses.<br>
The disruption results in a full or partial solubilization of the virus proteins, altering the integrity of<br>
the virus. Preferred splitting agents are non-ionic and ionic (e.g. cationic) surfactants e.g.<br>
alkylglycosides, alkylthioglycosides, acyl sugars, sulphobetaines, betains,<br>
polyoxyethylenealkylethers, N,N-dialkyl-Glucamides, Hecameg, alkylphenoxy-polyethoxyethanols,<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, sarcosyl, CTABs (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromides), tri-N-<br>
butyl phosphate, Cetavlon, myristyltrimethylammonium salts, lipofectin, lipofectamine, and DOT-<br>
MA, the octyl- or nonylphenoxy polyoxyethanols (e.g. the Triton surfactants, such as Triton X-100<br>
or Triton N101), polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (the Tween surfactants), polyoxyethylene ethers,<br>
polyoxyethylene esters, etc.<br>
Methods of purifying individual proteins from viruses are well known and include, for example,<br>
filtration, chromatography, centrifugation steps and hollow fiber elution. In one embodiment, the<br>
proteins are purified by ion exchange resin.<br>
As a further alternative, the vaccine may include a whole virus e.g. a live attenuated whole virus or,<br>
preferably, an inactivated whole virus. Methods of inactivating or killing viruses to destroy their<br>
ability to infect mammalian cells are known in the art. Such methods include both chemical and<br>
physical means. Chemical means for inactivating a virus include treatment with an effective amount<br>
of one or more of the following agents: detergents, formaldehyde, formalin, BPL, or UV light.<br>
Additional chemical means for inactivation include treatment with methylene blue, psoralen,<br>
carboxyfullerene (C60) or a combination of any thereof. Other methods of viral inactivation are<br><br>
known in the art, such as for example binary ethylamine, acetyl ethyleneimine, or gamma irradiation.<br>
Preferably, the virus is inactivated with BPL.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
Compositions of the invention are pharmaceutically acceptable. They usually include components in<br>
addition to the antigens e.g. they typically include one or more pharmaceutical carrier(s) and/or<br>
excipient(s). A thorough discussion of such components is available in Remington: The Science and<br>
Practice of Pharmacy (Gennaro, 2000; 20th edition, ISBN: 0683306472).<br>
Compositions will generally be in aqueous form.<br>
The composition may include one or more preservatives, such as thiomersal or 2-phenoxyethanol. It<br>
is preferred, however, that the vaccine should be substantially free from (i.e. less than 5g/ml)<br>
mercurial material e.g. thiomersal-free (Banzhoff (2000) Immunology Letters 71:91-96;<br>
WO02/097072). Vaccines containing no mercury are more preferred. Preservative-free vaccines are<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
It is preferred to include a physiological salt, such as a sodium salt e.g. to control tonicity. Sodium<br>
chloride (NaCl) is preferred, which may be present at between 1 and 20 mg/ml. Other salts that may<br>
be present include potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium phosphate<br>
dehydrate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, etc.<br>
Compositions will generally have an osmolality of between 200 mOsm/kg and 400 mOsm/kg,<br>
preferably between 240-360 mOsm/kg, and will more preferably fall within the range of 290-310'<br>
mOsm/kg.<br>
Compositions may include one or more buffers. Typical buffers include: a phosphate buffer; a Tris<br>
buffer; a borate buffer; a succinate buffer; a histidine buffer (particularly with an aluminum<br>
hydroxide adjuvant); or a citrate buffer. Buffers will typically be included in the 5-20mM range.<br>
The pH of a composition will generally be between 5.0 and 8.1, and more typically between 6.0 and<br>
8.0 e.g. 6.5 and 7.5. A method of the invention may therefore include a step of adjusting the pH of<br>
the bulk vaccine prior to packaging.<br>
The composition is preferably sterile. The composition is preferably non-pyrogenic e.g. containing<br>
composition is preferably gluten free.<br>
Compositions of the invention may include detergent e.g. a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester surfactant<br>
(known as 'Tweens'), an octoxynol (such as octoxynol-9 (Triton X-100) or<br>
t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol), a cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ('CTAB'), or sodium<br>
deoxycholate. The detergent may be present only at trace amounts.<br>
The composition may include material for a single immunization, or may include material for<br>
multiple immunizations (i.e. a 'multidose' kit). The inclusion of a preservative is useful in multidose<br><br>
arrangements. As an alternative (or in addition) to including a preservative in multidose<br>
compositions, the compositions may be contained in a container having an aseptic adaptor for<br>
removal of material.<br>
Vaccines are typically administered in a dosage volume of about 0.5ml, although a half dose (i.e.<br>
about 0.25ml) may be administered to children.<br>
Compositions and kits are preferably stored at between 2°C and 8°C. They should not be frozen.<br>
They should ideally be kept out of direct light.<br>
Methods of treatment, and administration of vaccines<br>
Compositions of the invention are suitable for administration to animal (and, in particular, human)<br>
patients, and the invention provides a method of raising an immune response in a patient, comprising<br>
the step of administering a composition of the invention to the patient.<br>
The invention also provides a kit or composition of the invention for use as a medicament.<br>
The invention also provides the use of immunogenic proteins derived from a virus propagated on cell<br>
culture, wherein said vaccine is substantially free of residual functional cell culture DNA, in the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for raising an immune response in a patient.<br>
The immune response raized by these methods and uses will generally include an antibody response,<br>
preferably a protective antibody response. Methods for assessing antibody responses, neutralizing<br>
capability and protection after viral vaccination are well known in the art. For influenza virus, for<br>
instance, human studies have shown that antibody titers against HA are correlated with protection (a<br>
serum sample hemagglutination-inhibition titer of about 30-40 gives around 50% protection from<br>
infection by a homologous virus) [Potter &amp; Oxford (1979) Br MedBull 35: 69-75].<br>
Compositions of the invention can be administered in various ways. The most preferred<br>
immunization route is by intramuscular injection (e.g. into the arm or leg), but other available routes<br>
include subcutaneous injection, intranasal, oral, intradermal, transcutaneous, transdermal, etc.<br>
Vaccines prepared according to the invention may be used to treat both children and adults. The<br>
patient may be less than 1 year old, 1-5 years old, 5-15 years old, 15-55 years old, or at least 55 years<br>
old. Patients may be elderly (e.g. &gt;50 years old, &gt;60 years old, and preferably &gt;65 years), the young<br>
(e.g. 
pregnant women, the chronically ill, immunodeficient patients, patients who have taken an antiviral<br>
compound (e.g. an oseltamivir or zanamivir compound for influenza; see below) in the 7 days prior<br>
to receiving the vaccine, people with egg allergies and people travelling abroad. The vaccines are not<br>
suitable solely for these groups, however, and may be used more generally in a population.<br>
Treatment can be by a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be used<br>
in a primary immunization schedule and/or in a booster immunization schedule. In a multiple dose<br>
schedule the various doses may be given by the same or different routes e.g. a parenteral prime and<br><br>
mucosal boost, a mucosal prime and parenteral boost, etc. Administration of more than one dose<br>
(typically two doses) is particularly useful in immunologically naiVe patients. Multiple doses will<br>
typically be administered at least 1 week apart (e.g. about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks,<br>
about 6 weeks, about 8 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 12 weeks, about 16 weeks, etc.).<br>
Vaccines produced by the invention may be administered to patients at substantially the same time as<br>
(e.g. during the same medical consultation or visit to a healthcare professional or vaccination centre)<br>
other vaccines e.g. at substantially the same time as a bacterial vaccine, such as a diphtheria vaccine,<br>
a tetanus vaccine, a pertussis vaccine, a DTP vaccine, a conjugated H.inflvenzae type b vaccine, a<br>
meningococcal conjugate vaccine (such as a tetravalent A-C-W135-Y vaccine), a pneumococcal<br>
conjugate vaccine, etc.<br>
Similarly, vaccines of the invention may be administered to patients at substantially the same time as<br>
(e.g. during the same medical consultation or visit to a healthcare professional) an antiviral<br>
compound effective against the virus of the vaccine. Where the vaccine is an influenza vaccine, for<br>
instance, the compound(s) may be a neuraminidase inhibitor (e.g. oseltamivir and/or zanamivir).<br>
These antivirals include a (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetylamino-5-amino-3(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-<br>
carboxylic acid or a 5-(acetylamino)^-[(ammoiminomethyl)-amino]-2,6-anhydro-3,4,5-trideoxy-D-<br>
glycero-D-galactonon-2-enonic acid, including esters thereof (e.g. the ethyl esters) and salts thereof<br>
(e.g. the phosphate salts). A preferred antiviral effective against influenza is (3R,4R,5S)-4-<br>
acetylamino-5-amino-3(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylic acid, ethyl ester, phosphate<br>
(1:1), also known as oseltamivir phosphate (TAMEFLU™).<br>
Host cell DNA<br>
Measurement of residual host cell DNA is within the normal capabilities of the skilled person. The<br>
total amount of residual DNA in compositions of the invention is preferably less than 20ng/ml e.g.<br>
DNA is preferably less than 500 base pairs in length.<br>
The assay used to measure DNA will typically be a validated assay (Guidance for Industry:<br>
Bioanalytical Method Validation. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug<br>
Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Veterinary Medicine<br>
(CVM). May 2001; Lundblad (2001) Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry 34:195-197). The<br>
performance characteristics of a validated assay can be described in mathematical and quantifiable<br>
terms, and its possible sources of error will have been identified. The assay will generally have been<br>
tested for characteristics such as accuracy, precision, specificity. Once an assay has been calibrated<br>
(e.g. against known standard quantities of host cell DNA) and tested then quantitative DNA<br>
measurements can be routinely performed. Three principle techniques for DNA quantification can be<br>
used: hybridization methods, such as Southern blots or slot blots (Ji et al. (2002) Biotechniques.<br>
32:1162-7 ); immunoassay methods, such as the Threshold™ System (Briggs (1991) J Parenter Sci<br>
Technol. 45:7-12.; and quantitative PCR (Lahijani et al. (1998) Hum Gem Ther. 9:1173-80). These<br><br>
methodg are all familiar to the skilled person, although the precise characteristics of each method<br>
may depend on the host cell in question e.g. the choice of probes for hybridization, the choice of<br>
primers and/or probes for amplification, etc. The Threshold™ system from Molecular Devices is a<br>
quantitative assay for picogram levels of total DNA, and has been used for monitoring levels of<br>
contaminating DNA in biopharmaceuticals (Briggs (1991) supra). A typical assay involves non-<br>
sequence-specific formation of a reaction complex between a biotinylated ssDNA binding protein, a<br>
urease-conjugated anti-ssDNA antibody, and DNA. All assay components are included in the<br>
complete Total DNA Assay Kit available from the manufacturer. Various commercial manufacturers<br>
offer quantitative PCR assays for detecting residual host cell DNA e.g. AppTec™ Laboratory<br>
Services, BioReliance™, Althea Technologies, etc. A comparison of a chemiluminescent<br>
hybridization assay and the total DNA Threshold™ system for measuring host cell DNA<br>
contamination of a human viral vaccine can be found in Lokteff et al. (2001) Biologicals. 29:123-32.<br>
These various analytical methods may also be used for measuring the length of residual host cell<br>
DNA. As mentioned above, the average length of residual host cell DNA, after treatment with the<br>
alkylating agent, is preferably less than 500 base pairs, or even less than 200 base pairs.<br>
In relation to canine cells in particular, such as MDCK cells, analysis of the genome reveals 13<br>
coding sequences 
fragmentation of DNA to 
unlikely that any fragment would actually correspond to one of the 3 genes around that length<br>
(namely: secretin at 81bp; PYY at 108bp; and osteocalcin at 135bp).<br>
Adjuvants<br>
Compositions of the invention may include an adjuvant, which can function to enhance the immune<br>
responses (humoral and/or cellular) elicited in a patient who receives the composition. The use of<br>
adjuvants with viral vaccines is well known e.g. in hepatitis vaccines, polio vaccines, etc. The<br>
FLUAD™ influenza vaccine includes an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant.<br>
Adjuvants that can be used with the invention include, but are not limited to, aluminum salts,<br>
immunostirnulatory oligonucleotides, saponins, lipid A analogs (such as 3dMPL) and oil-in-water<br>
emulsions. These and other adjuvants are disclosed in more detail in Powell &amp; Newman (Vaccine<br>
Design: The Submit and Adjuvant Approach, Plenum Press 1995, ISBN 0-306-44867-X) and<br>
O'Hagan (Vaccine Adjuvants: Preparation Methods and Research Protocols, volume 42 of Methods<br>
in Molecular Medicine series, ISBN: 1-59259-083-7).<br>
The adjuvants known as aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate may be used. These names<br>
are conventional, but are used for convenience only, as neither is a precise description of the actual<br>
chemical compound which is present (e.g. see chapter 9 of Powell &amp; Newman). The invention can<br>
use any of the "hydroxide" or "phosphate" adjuvants that are in general use as adjuvants. Adsorption<br>
to these salts is preferred.<br><br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides with adjuvant activity are well known. They may contain a<br>
CpG motif (a dinucleotide sequence containing an unmethylated cytosine linked by a phosphate bond<br>
to a guanosine), a TpG motif, an oligo-dT sequence, an oligo-dC sequence, double-stranded RNA,<br>
palindromic sequences, a poly(dG) sequence, etc. Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides will typically<br>
comprise at least 20 nucleotides, and may comprise fewer than 100 nucleotides.<br>
Saponins (chapter 22 of Powell &amp; Newman) are a heterologous group of sterol glycosides and<br>
triterpenoid glycosides that are found in the bark, leaves, stems, roots and even flowers of a wide<br>
range of plant species. Saponins from the bark of the Quillaia saponaria Molina tree have been<br>
widely studied as adjuvants. Saponin adjuvant formulations include purified formulations, such as<br>
QS21, as well as lipid formulations, such as ISCOMs. Saponin compositions have been purified<br>
using HPLC and RP-HPLC, and specific purified fractions using these techniques have been<br>
identified, including QS7, QS17, QS18, QS21, QH-A, QH-B and QH-C. Preferably, the saponin is<br>
QS21. A method of production of QS21 is disclosed in US patent 5057540. Saponin formulations<br>
may also comprise a sterol, such as cholesterol (WO96/33739). Combinations of saponins and<br>
cholesterols can be used to form unique particles called immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs),<br>
ISCOMs, which typically also include a phospholipid.<br>
3dMPL (also known as 3 de-O-acylated tnonophosphoryl lipid A or 3-0-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl<br>
lipid A) is an adjuvant in which position 3 of the reducing end glucosamine in monophosphoryl lipid<br>
A has been de-acylated. 3dMPL has been prepared from a heptoseless mutant of Salmonella<br>
mirmesota, and is chemically similar to lipid A but lacks an acid-labile phosphoryl group and a base-<br>
labile acyl group. 3dMPL can take the form of a mixture of related molecules, varying by their<br>
acylation (e.g. having 3,4, 5 or 6 acyl chains, which may be of different lengths).<br>
Various oil-in-water emulsions with adjuvant activity are known. They typically include at least one<br>
oil and at least one surfactant, with the oil(s) and surfactant(s) being biodegradable (metabolisable)<br>
and biocompatible. The oil droplets in the emulsion generally have sub-micron diameters, with these<br>
small sizes being achieved with a microfluidiser to provide stable emulsions. Droplets with a size<br>
less than 220nm are preferred as they can be subjected to filter sterilization.<br>
Specific oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants useful with the invention include, but are not limited to:<br>
•	A submicron emulsion of squalene, Tween 80, and Span 85. The composition of the emulsion<br>
by volume can be about 5% squalene, about 0.5% polysorbate 80 and about 0.5% Span 85. In<br>
weight terms, these ratios become 4.3% squalene, 0.5% polysorbate 80 and 0.48% Span 85.<br>
This adjuvant is known as 'MF59', as described in more detail in Chapter 10 of Powell &amp;<br>
Newman and chapter 12 of O'Hagan. The MF59 emulsion advantageously includes citrate<br>
ions e.g. lOmM sodium citrate buffer.<br>
•	An emulsion of squalene, a tocopherol, and Tween 80. The emulsion may include phosphate<br>
buffered saline. It may also include Span 85 (e.g. at 1%) and/or lecithin. These emulsions may<br>
have from 2 to 10% squalene, from 2 to 10% tocopherol and from 0.3 to 3% Tween 80, and the<br><br>
weight ratio of squalene:tocopherol is preferably 
Squalene and Tween 80 may be present volume ratio of about 5:2. One such emulsion can be<br>
made by dissolving Tween 80 in PBS to give a 2% solution, then mixing 90ml of this solution<br>
with a mixture of (5g of DL--tocopherol and 5ml squalene), then microfluidising the mixture.<br>
The resulting emulsion may have submicron oil droplets e.g. with an average diameter of<br>
between 100 and 250nm, preferably about 180nm.<br>
•	An emulsion of squalene, a tocopherol, and a Triton detergent (e.g. Triton X-100). The<br>
emulsion may also include a 3d-MPL. The emulsion may contain a phosphate buffer.<br>
•	An emulsion comprising a polysorbate (e.g. polysorbate 80), a Triton detergent (e.g. Triton<br>
X-100) and a tocopherol (e.g. an a-tocopherol succinate). The emulsion may include these<br>
three components at a mass ratio of about 75:11:10 (e.g. 750g/ml polysorbate 80, 100g/ml<br>
Triton X-100 and 100g/ml -tocopherol succinate), and these concentrations should include<br>
any contribution of these components from antigens. The emulsion may also include squalene.<br>
The emulsion may also include a 3d-MPL. The aqueous phase may contain a phosphate buffer.<br>
Influenza vaccines<br>
The invention is particularly suitable for preparing influenza virus vaccines. Various forms of<br>
influenza virus vaccine are currently available e.g. see chapters 17 &amp; 18 of Plotkin &amp; Orenstein<br>
(Vaccines, 4th edition, 2004, ISBN: 0-7216-9688-0). They are generally based either on live virus or<br>
on inactivated virus. Inactivated vaccines may be based on whole virions, 'split' virions, or on<br>
purified surface antigens (including hemagglutinin). Influenza antigens can also be presented in the<br>
form of virosomes (nucleic acid free viral-like liposomal particles). Antigens purified from a<br>
recombinant host (e.g. in an insect cell line using a baculovirus vector) may also be used.<br>
Chemical means for inactivating a virus include treatment with an effective amount of one or more of<br>
the following agents: detergents, formaldehyde, p-propiolactone, methylene blue, psoralen,<br>
carboxyfullerene (C60), binary ethylamine, acetyl ethyleneimine, or combinations thereof.<br>
Non-chemical methods of viral inactivation are known in the art, such as for example UV light or<br>
gamma irradiation.<br>
Virions can be harvested from virus-containing fluids by various methods. For example, a<br>
purification process may involve zonal centrifugation using a linear sucrose gradient solution that<br>
includes detergent to disrupt the virions. Antigens may then be purified, after optional dilution, by<br>
diafiltration.<br>
Split virions are obtained by treating purified virions with detergents (e.g. ethyl ether, polysorbate 80,<br>
deoxycholate, tri-N-butyl phosphate, Triton X-100, Triton N101, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide,<br>
etc.) to produce subvirion preparations, including the 'Tween-ether' splitting process. Methods of<br>
splitting influenza viruses are well known in the art e.g. WO02/28422, WO02/067983,<br>
WO02/074336, WO01/21151, WO02/097072, WO2005/113756 etc. Splitting of the virus is typically<br>
carried out by disrupting or fragmenting whole virus, whether infectious or non-infectious with a<br><br>
disrupting concentration of a splitting agent. The disruption results in a full or partial solubilization<br>
of the virus proteins, altering the integrity of the virus. Preferred splitting agents are non-ionic and<br>
ionic (e.g. cationic) surfactants e.g. alkylglycosides, alkylthioglycosides, acyl sugars, sulphobetaines,<br>
betains, polyoxyethylenealkylethers, N,N-dialkyl-Glucamides, Hecameg, alkylphenoxy-<br>
polyethoxyethanols, quaternary ammonium compounds, sarcosyl, CTABs (cetyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium bromides), tri-N-butyl phosphate, Cetavlon, myristyltrimethylammonium salts,<br>
lipofectin, lipofectamine, and DOT-MA, the octyl- or nonylphenoxy polyoxyethanols (e.g. the Triton<br>
surfactants, such as Triton X-100 or Triton N101), polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (the Tween<br>
surfactants), polyoxyethylene ethers, polyoxyethlene esters, etc. One useful splitting procedure uses<br>
the consecutive effects of sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde, and splitting can take place<br>
during initial virion purification (e.g. in a sucrose density gradient solution). Thus a splitting process<br>
can involve clarification of the virion-containing material (to remove non-virion material),<br>
concentration of the harvested virions (e.g. using an adsorption method, such as CaHPO4 adsorption),<br>
separation of whole virions from non-virion material, splitting of virions using a splitting agent in a<br>
density gradient centrifugation step (e.g. using a sucrose gradient that contains a splitting agent such<br>
as sodium deoxycholate), and then filtration (e.g. ultraflltration) to remove undesired materials. Split<br>
virions can usefully be resuspended in sodium phosphate-buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
Purified surface antigen vaccines comprise the influenza surface antigens hemagglutinin and,<br>
typically, also neuraminidase. Processes for preparing these proteins in purified form are well known<br>
in the art.<br>
Influenza virus strains for use in vaccines change from season to season. In the current<br>
inter-pandemic period, vaccines typically include two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one<br>
influenza B strain, and trivalent vaccines are typical. The invention may also use HA from pandemic<br>
strains (i.e. strains to which the vaccine recipient and the general human population are<br>
immunologically naive), such as H2, H5, H7 or H9 subtype strains (in particular of influenza A<br>
virus), and influenza vaccines for pandemic strains may be monovalent or may be based on a normal<br>
trivalent vaccine supplemented by a pandemic strain. Depending on the season and on the nature of<br>
the antigen included in the vaccine, however, the invention may protect against one or more of<br>
influenza A virus hemagglutinin subtypes HI, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, Hll, H12,<br>
H13,H14,H15orH16.<br>
As well as being suitable for immunizing against inter-pandemic strains, the compositions of the<br>
invention are particularly useful for immunizing against pandemic strains. The characteristics of an<br>
influenza strain that give it the potential to cause a pandemic outbreak are: (a) it contains a new<br>
hemagglutinin compared to the hemagglutinins in currently-circulating human strains, i.e. one that<br>
has not been evident in the human population for over a decade (e.g. H2), or has not previously been<br>
seen at all in the human population (e.g. H5, H6 or H9, that have generally been found only in bird<br>
populations), such that the human population will be immunologically naive to the strain's<br>
hemagglutinin; (b) it is capable of being transmitted horizontally in the human population; and (c) it<br><br>
is pathogenic to humans. A virus with H5 hemagglutinin type is preferred for immunizing against<br>
pandemic influenza, such as a H5N1 strain. Other possible strains include H5N3, H9N2, H2N2,<br>
H7N1 and H7N7, and any other emerging potentially pandemic strains. Within the H5 subtype, a<br>
virus may fall into HA clade 1, HA clade 1', HA clade 2 or HA clade 3 (World Health Organization<br>
(2005) Emerging Infectious Diseases ll(10):1515-2L), with clades 1 and 3 being particularly<br>
relevant. Other strains whose antigens can usefully be included in the compositions are strains which<br>
are resistant to antiviral therapy (e.g. resistant to oseltamivir and/or zanamivir), including resistant<br>
pandemic strains.<br>
Compositions of the invention may include antigen(s) from one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 or more)<br>
influenza virus strains, including influenza A virus and/or influenza B virus. A trivalent vaccine is<br>
preferred, including antigens from two influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain.<br>
The influenza virus may be a reassortant strain, and may have been obtained by reverse genetics<br>
techniques. Thus an influenza A virus may include one or more RNA segments from a A/PR/8/34<br>
virus (typically 6 segments from A/PR/8/34, with the HA and N segments being from a vaccine<br>
strain, i.e. a 6:2 reassortant). It may also include one or more RNA segments from a A/WSN/33<br>
virus, or from any other virus strain useful for generating reassortant viruses for vaccine preparation.<br>
Typically, the invention protects against a strain that is capable of human-to-human transmission,<br>
and so the strain's genome will usually include at least one RNA segment that originated in a<br>
mammalian (e.g. in a human) influenza virus. It may include NS segment that originated in an avian<br>
influenza virus.<br>
HA is the main immunogen in current inactivated influenza vaccines, and vaccine doses are<br>
standardized by reference to HA levels, typically measured by SRID. Existing vaccines typically<br>
contain about 15ug of HA per strain, although lower doses can be used e.g. for children, or in<br>
pandemic situations, or when using an adjuvant. Fractional doses such as i4 (i.e. 7.5ug HA per<br>
strain), lA and Vs have been used, as have higher doses (e.g. 3x or 9x doses). Thus vaccines may<br>
include between 0.1 and 150ug of HA per influenza strain, preferably between 0.1 and 50ug e.g.<br>
0.1-20|ig, 0.1-15ng, 0.1-10ug, 0.1-7.5.g, 0.5-5ug, etc. Particular doses include e.g. about 15, about<br>
10, about 7.5, about 5, about 3.8, about 1.9, about 1.5, etc. per strain.<br>
For live vaccines, dosing is measured by median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) rather than<br>
HA content, and a TCID50 of between 106 and 108 (preferably between 1065-107.5) per strain is.<br>
typical.<br>
HA used with the invention may be a natural HA as found in a virus, or may have been modified. For<br>
instance, it is known to modify HA to remove determinants (e.g. hyper-basic regions around the<br>
cleavage site between HA1 and HA2) that cause a virus to be highly pathogenic in avian species.<br>
After treating a virion-containing composition to degrade host cell DNA (e.g. with BPL), the<br>
degradation products are preferably removed from virions e.g. by anion exchange chromatography.<br><br>
Once an influenza virus has been purified for a particular strain, it may be combined with viruses<br>
from other strains e.g. to make a trivalent vaccine as described above. It is preferred to treat each<br>
strain separately and to mix monovalent bulks to give a final multivalent mixture, rather than to mix<br>
viruses and degrade DNA from a multivalent mixture.<br>
General<br>
The term "comprising" encompasses "including" as well as "consisting" e.g. a composition<br>
"comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y.<br>
The word "substantially" does not exclude "completely" e.g. a composition which is "substantially<br>
free" from Y may be completely free from Y. Where necessary, the word "substantially" may be<br>
omitted from the definition of the invention.<br>
The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means, for example, x±10%.<br>
By the terms "isolated" and "purified" is meant at least 50% pure, more preferably 60% pure (as with<br>
most split vaccines), more preferably 70% pure, or 80% pure, or 90% pure, or 95% pure, or greater<br>
than 99% pure.<br>
Unless specifically stated, a process comprising a step of mixing two or more components does not<br>
require any specific order of mixing. Thus components can be mixed in any order. Where there are<br>
three components then two components can be combined with each other, and then the combination<br>
may be combined with the third component, etc.<br>
Where animal (and particularly bovine) materials are used in the culture of cells, they should be<br>
obtained from sources that are free from transmissible spongiform encaphalopathies (TSEs), and in<br>
particular free from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Overall, it is preferred to culture cells<br>
in the total absence of animal-derived materials.<br>
Where a compound is administered to the body as part of a composition then that compound may<br>
alternatively be replaced by a suitable prodrug.<br>
Where a cell substrate is used for reassortment or reverse genetics procedures, it is preferably one<br>
that has been approved for use in human vaccine production e.g. as in Ph Eur general chapter 5.2.3.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the results of PCR amplification of 6 named targets in the MDCK genome.<br>
Some samples were diluted as indicated, up to 1:10000, prior to PCR.<br>
Figure 3 shows the results of PCR amplification of SINE sequences in the MDCK genome. As in<br>
Figures 1 &amp; 2, DNA was sometimes diluted prior to PCR. In the lower panel, the figures are the<br>
starting amount of DNA in the PCR (fg).<br>
Figure 4 shows the effect of BPL treatment on the size of MDCK DNA. Genomic DNA was<br>
incubated with BPL at different temperatures and for different lengths of time. Figure 5 shows<br>
similar results. Agarose gels were stained with SYBRGold.<br><br>
Figure 6 shows capillary electrophoresis of residual DNA (top line) relative to markers (bottom line)<br>
having the indicated sizes.<br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Influenza viruses (A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1), A/Panama/2007/99(H3N2); B/Jiangsu/10/2003;<br>
A/Wyoming/3/2003(H3N2)) were grown in MDCK cells in a suspension culture, following the<br>
teaching of WO97/37000, WO03/23025 and WO04/92360. The final culture medium was clarified to<br>
provide virions, which were then subjected to chromatography and ultrafiltration/diafiltration.<br>
Virions in the resulting material were inactivated vising -propiolactone (final concentration 0.05%<br>
v/v; incubated for 16-20 hours at 2-8°C, and then hydrolyzed by incubating at 37°C for 2-2.5 hours).<br>
CTAB was then used to split the virions, and various further processing steps gave a final<br>
monovalent bulk vaccine containing purified surface proteins.<br>
MDCK DNA was characterized to evaluate its amount, size, and integrity at three stages of the<br>
manufacturing process: (A) after the ultrafiltration/diafiltration step; (B) after P-propiolactone<br>
treatment; and (C) in the final monovalent bulk. Capillary gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid<br>
amplification were used to investigate the size, the integrity and the biological activity of any<br>
residual genomic DNA.<br>
Size determination<br>
As mentioned above, the size of residual host cell DNA was analyzed at stages (A), (B) and (C) by<br>
capillary gel electrophoresis. The analysis was performed on five separate virus cultures.<br>
500 samples were removed at these three points and treated with 10 l proteinase K at 56°C for<br>
16 to 22 h followed by a total DNA extraction with the DNA Extractor Kit (Wako Chemicals)<br>
following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was resuspended in 500 ul ultra pure water for<br>
electrophoresis on a P/ACE MDQ Molecular Characterization System (Beckman Coulter) at a<br>
constant temperature of 20°C. Eleven molecular size markers were used, from 72 to 1353 bp. The<br>
nucleic acid detection limit (DL) for this method was 0.7 pg/ml.<br>
Based on the size markers and relative density of the DNA bands, the distribution and size of the<br>
DNA fragments were determined and assigned to four different size categories between ranging from<br>1000 bp. Figure 6 shows capillary electrophoresis of a stage (C) sample. The analysis<br>
shows that all detectable residual DNA in mis sample is substantially below 200bp in length.<br>
Average results from the five cultures are shown in the following table:<br><br><br>
8PL treatment thus causes a ~10-fold reduction in the amount of DNA, but also shifts the<br>
distribution away from long sequences towards small fragments 
between steps (B) and (C), including chromatography and ultrafiltration steps, reduced total DNA<br>
levels another ~70-fold, and removed all detectable DNA &gt;200bp.<br>
DNA amplification<br>
Neoplastic cell transformation is a phenomenon often associated with modified proto-oncogenes<br>
and/or modified tumor suppressor genes. Sequences from several such canine genes were analyzed<br>
by PCR before and after BPL treatment i.e. at points (A) and (B). In addition, DNA from uninfected<br>
MDCK cells was treated and tested. Proto-oncogenes tested were: H-ras and c-myc. Tumor<br>
suppressor genes tested were: p53; p21/waf-l; and PTEN. In addition, repetitive SINE sequences<br>
were analyzed by PCR. The high copy number for SINEs facilitates sensitive detection.<br>
All samples were spiked with an external control DNA (pUC19 fragment) for monitoring the quality<br>
of the sample preparation and the PCR. In all experiments a consistent amplification of the spike<br>
control was observed, indicating that residual hydrolyzed BPL and by-products present in the PCR<br>
mixtures does not have inhibitory effects on the assay and ensured a sufficient quality of sample<br>
preparation and PCR. Samples were diluted in 10-fold steps before amplification, until PCR products<br>
could not be detected, thereby indicating the log reduction in DNA levels. The detection limit for the<br>
PCR assay is 55pg.<br>
PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Figure 1 shows results obtained in<br>
uninfected MDCK cells, and Figure 2 shows results obtained during virus culture. All six analyzed<br>
genes showed a strong amplification signal before BPL treatment, but signal strength diminished<br>
after exposure to BPL. In all tested production lots, residual MDCK genomic DNA was decreased by<br>
at least 2 log values after BPL exposure.<br>
Because Figure 2 shows results at stage (B), before further purification, the results over-represent<br>
DNA present in final bulk vaccines. Due to the sensitivity when using SINE sequences, however,<br>
PCR was also possible at stage (C), in the final monovalent bulk. Results of this analysis are shown<br>
in Figure 3. DNA amplification in (A) and (B) was relatively similar for the SINE region, indicating<br>
that BPL is less active on smaller DNA sequences. Even for these small sequences, however, there<br>
was a notable reduction in the amplification signal for all of the analyzed samples. Comparison of the<br>
PCR signal intensities between sample collection point (B) and (C) reflects the reduction of residual<br>
DNA due to intermediate purification steps.<br>
Extrapolating from the gene-based analysis, and based directly on the SINE-based analysis, a total<br>
DNA level of <lng per dose and often is expected in a final vaccine.></lng><br>
Temperature<br>
BPL treatment during virus inactivation had two independent steps: (1) add BPL to the virion-<br>
containing mixture at 2-8°C; then (2) raise the temperature to 37°C to hydrolyse BPL. The effects of<br>
the two BPL steps on MDCK DNA inactivation and fragmentation were investigated.<br>
Purified genomic DNA from uninfected MDCK cells was treated with a final concentration of<br>
0.05% (v/v) BPL at 2-8°C for 16 hours, or at 37°C or 50°C for up to 6.5 hours. Fragmentation of<br>
DNA was checked afterwards, and results are shown in Figure 4. These experiments reveal the<br>
activity of BPL against cellular DNA, but uninfected cells do not reflect the state of MDCK after<br>
viral growth because cellular DNA is already highly fragmented due to apoptosis.<br>
At 2-8°C, the difference between untreated and treated DNA on an agarose gel was negligible,<br>
suggesting that DNA fragmentation by BPL may not substantially occur during under these<br>
conditions. In contrast, DNA was greatly modified at both 37°C and 50°C, with the higher<br>
temperature leading to an accelerated reaction kinetic. DNA from untreated cells showed a relatively<br>
distinct band in an agarose gel, with a light smear of degradation products (Figure 5, lane 3). After a<br>
short BPL incubation at 37°C, however, MDCK DNA smeared down from the gel slots and band<br>
signal intensity decreased (Figure 5, lane 2). Longer incubation periods resulted in the disappearance<br>
of large genomic DNA molecules and enhanced fragmentation of MDCK DNA.<br>
In further experiments, BPL was first incubated with cells at 4°C for 16 hours. In a first population,<br>
the temperature was raized to 37°C for 2 hours; in a second population, BPL was removed by<br>
centrifugal filters and then the temperature was raized. Much lower (&gt;2 log lower) residual DNA<br>
levels were seen in the first population.<br>
Thus the DNA fragmentation observed during BPL treatment seems to occur mainly during the BPL<br>
hydrolysis step at 37°C rather than during the virus inactivation step at 2-8°C.<br>
It will be understood that the invention has been described by way of example only and modifications<br>
may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br><br>
