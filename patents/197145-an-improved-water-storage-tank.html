				<td>This invention relates to an improved water storage tank.<br>
The water storage tank are well known in the art and comprises a cylindrical or square type container. A central opening is provided in the top cover of the container for facilitating the cleaning of the container as and when required. An inlet is provided near the top end having a float valve secured therewith inside the container to allow filling of the container with water. A water outlet having a water tap provided outside the container for the supply of water from said container.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the conventional water tank. One of the main disadvantage is that the float valve is placed below the top cover of the water tank and therefore a substantial space near the top end inside the water tank is not utilized and thus reduces the capacity of the water tank.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the silt is accumulated at the bottom of the water tank and the water tank is not completely cleaned even by a plumber.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the water become very hot during the summer season and which is very uncomfortable for use and particularly when it has to be cooled in a refrigerator.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that at lot of water is wasted when the float value is damaged or not working properly which is very common and thus continuous monitoring is required during the filling process of the water tank.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a novel water storage tank in which the water remains at the atmospheric temperature in all the seasons.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a water storage tank having a novel float valve near the top cover of the water tank for the maximum utilization of the area of the water tank.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a water tank having a synchronized valve assembly for water inlet and water draining which avoids the silt accumulation at the bottom of the water tank.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a water tank having the air pockets around the walls of the water tank which avoids the heating of the water contained inside the water tank.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an improved water storage tank comprising: a water container having a central opening in the top of the container, a float valve provided near the top of the container to stop supply of water to the container when water level reaches upto level of the valve, an inlet tube connected to the said float valve, an outlet tube provided to get water supply from the said tank, characterized in that: a plurality of air pockets are provided around the wall of  the  said container for allowing circulation of air around the said container, an inclined chamber with inclined top surface is provided on the bottom of the said container for facilitating of silt accumulation in a silt chamber provided in the bottom on one side of said inclined chamber, the said float valve comprises a hollow sphere with slots/openings provided diametrically opposite to each other, a ball disposed within the said sphere so as to stop the supply of water to the container by closing the opening of said inlet tube when water level reaches upto level of the said valve, a synchronized valve comprising an inlet valve and a drain valve coupled to each other is provided in the said inclined chamber so as to ensure closure of the drain valve when the inlet valve is open and vice versa, and a floating tube with an opening below    the    top    cover    of   the    container    provided    for    draining    excess    water.<br>
In accordance with this invention the water storage tank comprises a cylindrical or square type container having the air pockets provided outside the wails of the container. The air pockets are provided for the circulation of the environmental air around the water container which facilitate to keep the water inside the container at the atmospheric temperature. An inclined chamber is provided inside the water tank above the bottom of the container so as to constitute a small silt. accumulation chamber at the bottom of the container. The synchronised valve assembly is provided in the inclined chamber such that when the water is supplied in the water tank the cleaning outlet is closed but the water supply from the water outlet may be obtained. A novel valve is provided at the water inlet just below the top cover of the water tank for supplying the water into the water tank and to stop the water supply when the water tank is filled up with the water upto the level of the valve. A drain tube having an opening near the top cover is provided for the draining of the water when the water level crosses the  valve level.<br>
A water storage tank according to a preferred embodiment  of this invention is  herein  described and   illustrated  in  the  accompanying   drawings wherein -. -Fig.i   shows the front, view of the  water  storage<br>
tank and ; Fig.2   shows   the sectional view  of  the  water<br>
storage, tank. Referring to the drawings particularly fig.l, the water storage tank of this invention has a cylindrical container 1 having an air pockets 2 provided around the wall of the container. An air inlet 3 and air outlet (not shown) is provided in each air pocket 2 for the circulation of air around the water storage container 1 and which avoids the heating of the water contained in the container 1. An inclined chamber 4 is provided on the bottom 5 of the container 1 for providing a silt chamber G at one side of the container 1. A synchronised valve assembly 7 is provided in the inclined chamber 4 such that during the supply of the water to the container 1 the  cleaning/draining<br>
outlet valve 8 is closed. Similarly when the cleaning valve 8 is open the water inlet valve<br>
9 is closed. An outlet tube 10 having a valve 11 provided therewith, is provided to get the<br>
normal water supply from the water tank 1 as and when required. A float valve 12 is<br>
provided at the discharge end of the water inlet supply tube 13 just below the top cover<br>
14 of the container 1. The float valve according to this invention comprises a hollow<br>
sphere 12 with the slots/opening 12A provided diametrically opposite to each other. A<br>
ball 12B is disposed within the sphere 12 so as to stop the supply of the water to the<br>
container when the water level reaches upto the level of the valve 12. The float valve 12<br>
is closed by upward movement of the ball 12A due to the water pressure inside the<br>
container 1. A floating tube 14A having an opening below the top cover 14 of the<br>
container 1 is provided for draining the excess water when the water level crosses the<br>
level of the float valve 12 and thus the overflow of the water from the central opening 15<br>
is stopped. A transparent window 16A is provided in the silt chamber to<br>
see	therethrough to determine the level of the silt accumulated in the silt ehambei . When the ;cilt chamber 16 is filled with the silt the cleaning valve 8 is open and thus the silt accumulated in the silt chamber is drained out. automatically and fhue the water tank is cleaned..<br><br><br><br><br><br>
