				<td>Work-piece with AlCr-Containing Hard Substance Coating<br>
and Process for its Production<br>
The invention pertains to the technical area of work-pieces which are coated with a<br>
coating system that at least contains one layer of the composition (AlyCr1-y) X according<br>
to claim 1 and 2. The invention further pertains to a PVD-process for depositing at least<br>
one (AlyCr1-y) X-layer on a work-piece according to claim 16.<br>
The invention covers the following:<br>
Hard substance coated work-pieces with one or a sequence of several different<br>
aluminium-chromium nitride or carbonitride coatings.<br>
Tools, particularly cutting and deforming tools (drills, mills, reversible cutting<br>
plates, thread-borers, thread-formers, hob cutters, punches, dies, draw-<br>
punches etc.) and application of these tools with aluminium-chromium nitride<br>
or aluminium-chromium carbonitride coatings.<br>
Components, especially components in mechanical engineering, e.g. sprocket<br>
wheels, pumps, cup-tappets, piston rings, injector needles, complete bearing<br>
sets or their individual components and application of these components with<br>
AlCrN or AlCrCN coatings.<br>
A process for producing aluminium-chromium nitride or -carbonitride coating<br>
having a defined coating structure.<br>
From the state-of-the-art technology, various AlCrN coatings are known. Thus the<br>
document JP 09-041127 describes a wear resistant hard substance coating having the<br>
following composition: (Al1-y Xy) Z, whereby X = Cr, V or Mg, Z = N, C, B, CN, BN or<br>
CBN and 0 
cutting plates.<br>
D. Schulz and R. Wilberg describe in "Multi-component hard thin films...", Thin films<br>
(Proc 4th int Sympos. Trends and New Applications of Thin Films 1993) DGM<br>
Info.gesellschaft Oberursel, 1993, page 73, a CrAIN coating, which during a drilling test<br>
achieved twice the tool edge life of a TiAIN coated drill. Depositing of the coating took<br>
place in a hollow cathode process that however on account of a discontinuous<br>
vaporisation process causes a strong fluctuation in chromium/aluminium distribution in<br>
the (CrAl) N-coating.<br>
M. Kawate et. al mentions in "Oxidation Resistance of Cr1-x A1XN &amp; Ti1-x A1XN films"<br>
Surf. &amp; Coat. Tech.Vol. 165 to (2003), pages 163 - 167 a Cri-XA1XN coating, which with<br>
high Al-content and Wurtzit-structure reveals an improved oxidation resistance as<br>
compared to traditional TiAlN-coatings.<br>
E. Lugscheider, K. Bobzin, K. Lackner compare in investigations of Mechanical and<br>
Tribol Properties of CrAIN + C Thin Coatings Deposited on Cutting Tools " arced<br>
CrAlN-coatings and CrAlN-coatings that are additionally provided with even harder,<br>
carbon containing cover coating. All coatings have coefficients of friction rapidly rising<br>
to high values.<br>
It is the technical task of this invention to present (AlyCr1-y) X-coated work-pieces, e.g.<br>
chipping tools, cutting and forging tools or components for machining and forging, as<br>
well as a process for depositing of such coatings on a work-piece, and thereby avoid the<br>
disadvantages of the state-of-the-art technology.<br>
This includes work-pieces, which at least with respect to the Al/Cr-ratio have an<br>
adjustable uniform or variable coating composition, and at least for certain applications,<br>
reveal a higher wear resistance than work-pieces provided with coatings known so far.<br>
In order to investigate the wear resistance of (AlyCr1-y) N or -CN coatings on different<br>
tools, Cr-coatings with varying aluminium content was deposited on different work-<br>
pieces in an industrial coating plant of the type RCS of the company Balzer, as described<br>
also in EP 1186681 in figures 3-6, description on page 12, line 26 to page 14 line 9.<br>
The mentioned document is hereby declared as an integral part of this application.<br>
Additionally, the cleaned work-pieces were fixed, depending on the diameter, on double-<br>
rotating substrate carriers, or on triple-rotating substrate carriers for diameters lesser than<br>
50 mm, and two titanium-metallurgic and four powder-metallurgic produced targets of<br>
different AlCr alloys were mounted in six cathode arc sources attached to the walls of the<br>
coating plants.<br>
Subsequently the work-pieces were first brought to a temperature of approx. 500° C by<br>
means of radiation heaters connected to the plant and the surface was subjected to etch-<br>
cleaning with Ar-ions by introducing a bias-voltage of-100 to -200 V under Ar-<br>
atmosphere at a pressure of 0.2 Pa.<br>
Thereafter, by operating the two Ti-sources with a power of 3.5 KW (140 A) in pure<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 3 Pa and a substrate voltage of-50 V over a period<br>
of 5 min., an approx. 0.2 urn thick TiN adhesive coating was deposited; subsequently, by<br>
operating the four AlCr-sources with a power of 3 KW for a duration of 120 min., an<br>
AlCrN-coating was deposited. In order to achieve an optimum coating transition, the<br>
sources were operated together for a period of 2 min. Then a nitride coating on AlCr-<br>
base in pure nitrogen atmosphere, similarly at a pressure of 3 Pa and a substrate voltage<br>
of-50 V, was deposited. Basically, the process pressure in each of these steps can be<br>
adjusted in a range of 0.5 to approx. 8 Pa, preferably between 2.5 and 5 Pa, whereby<br>
either a pure nitrogen atmosphere or a mixture of nitrogen and an inert gas, e.g. argon for<br>
nitride coatings, or a mixture of nitrogen and carbon-containing gas that can be mixed<br>
with an inert gas if required, can be used for carbonitride coatings. Correspondingly, for<br>
depositing oxygen- or boron-containing coatings, oxygen or a known boron-containing<br>
gas can be mixed.<br>
Coating properties like crystal structure of the coating, coating thickness, coating<br>
hardness, wear resistance and adhesion of AlCrN-coatings in relation to the chemical<br>
composition and crystal structure, as well as composition of the used targets are listed in<br>
table 1. Process parameters like target capacity, substrate pre-stress, process pressure and<br>
temperature are summarized in table 2.<br>
Table 3 shows a measurement series, during which AlCrN-coatings were deposited using<br>
targets with Al/Cr-ratio equal to 3, under application of different substrate voltages. The<br>
wear resistance was determined with a precision wear tester of the Fraunhofer Institut-<br>
IST/Braunschweig, whereby a modified spherical grinding method based on DIN EN<br>
1071-2 was applied to determine the rate of wear. Details of the process can be found in<br>
Michler, Surf. &amp; Coat.Tech., vol. 163-164 (2003), page 547, col. 1 and fig. 1. The<br>
mentioned document is hereby declared as an integral part of this application.<br>
The invention is described in details below on the basis of figures. The following are<br>
shown:<br>
Fig. 1 XRD-spectrum of an AlCrN with B1 and B4 structure<br>
Fig.2 XRD-spectrum of AlCrN-coatings in relation to the chemical composition Al/Cr:<br>
A = 75/25, C = 50/50, D = 25/75.<br>
As one can see from table 1 and fig. 1 and from Kawate's, "Micro-hardness and lattice<br>
parameter of Cr1-xAlxN films", J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 20 (2), March/April 2002; pages<br>
569-571. for Al-concentration of greater than 70 At% share of metal content in the<br>
coating, a hexagonal (B4) layer structure could be determined, and for lower Al-<br>
concentrations a cubical (B1) layer structure was determined. For hexagonal layers, HV-<br>
values of approx. 2100 HV0.03 could be measured, and for cubic layer structures however<br>
higher HV-values of approx. 2800-3100 HV0.03 (see table 1). For higher Cr-contents<br>
(sample D) a hardness of approx. 2300 HV0.03 was determined. For this composition,<br>
different from the AIN-lattice of the high aluminium-containing coatings as shown in fig.<br>
2A, one finds a CrN-lattice as shown in fig. 2D.<br>
Subsequently the tool edge lives of 6 mm HSS-drills coated with AlCrN were determined<br>
as shown in example 1 below, on a steel material DIN 1.2080 having hardness of 230<br>
HV, with a shear thrust of 0.12 mm and cutting velocity of 35 m/min. It was seen that, in<br>
contrast to the range of AlyCr1-yN l<y described as particularly favourable in></y>
document JP 09-041127, a chromium content of greater than 0.3 proved to be more<br>
advantageous. For chromium contents greater than or equal to 0.8, the performance<br>
capacity dropped on account of the CrN-lattice present for this application area. The<br>
increase in tool edge life of cubic layers as compared to hexagonal AlCrN-layers was<br>
235% in this test.<br>
For coating in a transition region with an Al-content between 60% and 75%, not only the<br>
preferred orientation but also the basic structure of the crystal lattice can be adjusted<br>
through the process parameters. Thus, for example, in experiment B (table 2), a<br>
hexagonal structure is generated at a low pressure of 1 Pa and a substrate voltage of-50<br>
V, whereas a cubic structure gets generated in a pressure range of 3 Pa and substrate<br>
voltage of-50 V. Thus the hexagonal structure gets deposited at relatively lower bias<br>
voltage and low pressure, whereas the preferred cubic structure is deposited at higher<br>
pressure or at higher bias voltage. With higher Al-contents it is no longer possible to<br>
generate a cubic layer structure.<br>
Work-pieces as per the invention therefore have a special feature of a cubic (AlyCr1-y) X<br>
coating with the following composition: X = N or CN, preferably however N, and 0.2 
Y 
with an average grain size of approx. 20 - 120 nm.<br>
Methods as per the invention have the special feature of process conducting, in which a<br>
cubic (AlyCr1-y) X layer with a composition as defined above is deposited. For the<br>
described cathode arc method one could use target compositions of 75 to 15% aluminium<br>
contents. In case of higher aluminium contents, the process parameters will have to be<br>
adjusted as described above, in order to generate a cubic crystalline structure.<br>
Advantageous thereby is the application of powder-metallurgic targets produced by cold<br>
pressing, that have a higher stability than AlCr-targets produced in a fusion-metallurgic<br>
or sinter-metallurgic manner, which especially with high Al-contents mostly contains<br>
brittle phases.<br>
Such targets are cold-pressed by mixing starting materials in powder form and then<br>
subsequently through several deformations, e.g. in a forging press, at temperatures below<br>
660° C, compressed by rheology and cold-welding and brought to a final condition with a<br>
theoretical density of about 96 - 100%.<br>
It can further be seen that for an AlCrN-coating that was deposited with targets having<br>
composition of Al/Cr = 3, the wear resistance can be influenced by the substrate pre-<br>
stress. With increasing substrate pre-stress the resistance to abrasive wear gets reduced<br>
(see table 3). Already in case of a very small negative substrate voltage, which is not<br>
explicitly shown in the table, say of only a few Volts (3 - 10 V and random intermediate<br>
values), one can achieve a marked improvement as compared to floating substrates (no<br>
external voltage supply). At approx. -20 V the wear resistance for Al/Cr = 3 reaches a<br>
maximum and again drops at higher voltages. From the experiments for determining the<br>
wear behaviour, one can derive an optimum range of substrate voltage between 3 and 150<br>
V, particularly between 5 and 40 V, in which a very small wear rate between 0.4 and 1.0,<br>
particularly between 0.4 and 0.8 m3 m-1 N-1 1015, was measured. The same holds good<br>
also for cubic coatings as per the invention having different Al/Cr-composition, in which<br>
no wear rates above 1.5 m3 m-1 N-1 10-15 was measured. However, it should be noted that<br>
also the wear resistance of floating coatings deposited with high substrate voltage is<br>
significantly greater than the wear resistance of known TiAIN-coatings, whose wear co-<br>
efficient is significantly higher. For example, for a TiAIN-coating deposited analogous to<br>
the AlCrN-coatings (experiment 2, Al 47 at%, Ti 53 at%), a wear rate of 3.47 m3 m-1 N-1<br>
10-15 was measured.<br>
With the help of the above described method, particularly by using powder-metallurgic<br>
produced TiAl-targets, coatings with low roughness could be deposited. The measured<br>
Ra-values lie in the range between 0.1 and 0.2 µm and thus moved in the same range like<br>
comparably produced CrN-coatings. Further smoothening of the coatings was obtained<br>
by using a magnetic field generating device consisting of two opposite-poled magnet<br>
systems, which is designed in such a way that the component B1 of the result ir. magnetic<br>
field that is perpendicular to the surface, revealed mostly constant small values over a<br>
large section of the surface, or even zero. The values of the perpendicular magnetic<br>
component B1 were thereby set lesser than 30, preferably lesser than 20, ideally lesser<br>
than 10 gauss. The Ra-values of the thus deposited (AlyCr1-y) X-coatings lay in the range<br>
of 0.5 and 0.15 µm. The magnetic field was generated with the help of two opposite-<br>
poled coils arranged co-axially behind the targets.<br>
Furthermore, while depositing (AlxCr1-x) X-coatings, also other good-conducting, nitride<br>
or even metallic adhesive coatings can be used, or for certain applications one can also do<br>
away with such an adhesive coatings. For achieving particularly high productivity, an<br>
AlCWAICrN-adhesive coating can be applied instead of TiN-adhesive coating, whereby<br>
it is possible to provide all arc sources of a coating plant with AlCr-targets and increase<br>
the coating rates.<br>
Similarly, depositing of gradient coating with increasing Al-content towards the surface<br>
is possible, if two target types with different Al/Cr-ratios are used; or starting with a Cr-<br>
and/or CrN-adhesive coating by continuous or step-wise regulation of the corresponding<br>
target performances of a coating chamber equipped with Cr- as well as AlCr-target, a<br>
change in coating composition can be achieved. Mainly for an industrial application for<br>
such coating systems, there is the possibility to adjust the process parameters mainly over<br>
the entire coating sequence and hence over the entire coating thickness in a reproducible<br>
manner. Minor fluctuations in the composition, as effected by the substrate movement on<br>
a single or multiple-rotating substrate carrier, can be used in addition to a nano<br>
structuring formed partly or over the entire coating thickness, i.e. laminating in nano- or<br>
micrometer range. Process-technically, if unalloyed chromium and aluminium targets are<br>
used, a rougher structured hard coating is deposited, than in case of using alloyed AlCr-<br>
targets.<br>
The known processes as per the state-of-the-art technology are less suitable for this, in<br>
which the vaporisation process of at least one component is difficult to control or is<br>
discontinuous, because one cannot achieve a reproducible coating quality.<br>
Of course it is also possible to produce such coatings on other vacuum coating plants or<br>
even through sputtering processes, whereby however, the lower ionisation of the process<br>
gas in sputtering processes can be compensated if required by known measure like<br>
special adhesive coating, additional ionisation etc., in order to attain a comparable<br>
coating adhesion.<br>
Basically, with such Cr1-xAlxN coatings with cubic structure very different work-pieces<br>
can be coated. The example for these are cutting tools like millers, hob cutters, ball-end<br>
millers, planar millers and profile millers, as well as drills, thread-borers, broaching tools,<br>
reamers and reversible cutting plates for turning and milling machining or deforming<br>
tools like punches, dies, draw-rings, ejecting cores or thread-formers. Even injection<br>
moulding tools, e.g. for metallic injection moulding alloys, synthetic resins or<br>
thermoplastic synthetic substances, particularly injection moulding tools that are used for<br>
producing synthetic moulded parts or data carriers like CDs, DVDs and others, can be<br>
protected with such coatings. A further area of application would be structural<br>
components that have a high requirement of wear resistance, sometimes coupled with<br>
high resistance oxidation. Examples from the pump and engine industry are sealing<br>
rings, pistons, punches, sprocket wheels and valve drives like cup-tappets and tipping<br>
levers, or needles for injection nozzles, compressor shafts, pump spindles, or many<br>
components that have one or more gear elements.<br>
Furthermore, on account of the basically similar behaviour of (AlyCr1-y) X coatings, even<br>
in improvement of the wear and tear behaviour can be expected, if in the following<br>
coating systems the target composition and coating parameters are selected in such a way,<br>
that a cubic coating structure is attained.<br>
(AlyCr1-y) X coatings, whereby we have X = N, C, B, CN, BN, CBN, NO, CBO, BO,<br>
CNO, BNO, CBNO, preferably however N or CN and 0.2 = Y = 0.7, preferably 0.40 = Y<br>
=0.68.<br><br>
Thus (Al66 Cr34) NO coatings with different N/O-ratio were deposited and their coating<br>
properties were tested. The coating parameters were selected similarly as mentioned<br>
above. The total pressure was set between 1 to 5 Pa for an oxygen flow between 20 and<br>
60 sccm (rest nitrogen); the substrate voltage was set between -40 to -150 V, the<br>
temperature to 450° C and the source power was set at a current of 140 A at 3.5 KW.<br>
This yielded coatings with an O/N-ratio of approx. 0.2 and 0.6 and 0.2. In various<br>
milling tests one could see that the coatings were superimposed with low oxygen content.<br>
The results were significantly better than those attained for tool edge life with traditional<br>
TiN or TiCN. On account of the improved anti-friction properties of the above (AlyCr1-y)<br>
X coatings, as compared to known TiAIN-coatings, from the ecological and economic<br>
points of view one obtained an interesting possibility in the operation of tools,<br>
particularly cutting tools and deforming tools, in that one can either do away with<br>
lubricants or use only minimum lubricant quantities. Under the economic aspect it<br>
should be taken into account that the costs for cooling lubricants, particularly in cutting<br>
tools, could be significantly higher than for the tool itself.<br>
There is a further possibility of improving the anti-friction properties of a coating system<br>
containing an (AlyCr1-y) X coating as per the invention, if a sliding layer is additionally<br>
applied as outer layer. It is thereby advantageous if the sliding layer has a lower hardness<br>
than the (AlyCr1-y) X coating and also has inflow property.<br>
The sliding coating system could thereby be made up of at least one metal or one carbide<br>
of a metal and dispersed carbon, MeC/C, whereby the metal is a metal of the group IVb,<br>
Vb and/or VIb and/or silicium. Ideally suited for this, is particularly a WC/C-cover<br>
coating with a hardness that can be adjusted between 1000 and 1500 HV, which then<br>
reveals excellent inflow properties. Even CrC/C-coatings show a similar behaviour,<br>
however with a somewhat higher friction coefficient.<br>
In deep hole borers coated in this manner, after producing one to three bore holes, an<br>
excellent inflow smoothening of the chipping surfaces could be determined, which till<br>
now could be achieved only by cumbersome mechanical machining. Such properties are<br>
also particularly interesting for the structural component applications with sliding,<br>
friction or rolling loads, especially with lacking lubrication or dry-run, or if<br>
simultaneously an uncoated counter-body has to be supported.<br>
Further possibilities for formation of a final sliding coating are metal-free diamond-like<br>
carbon coatings, or MoSx-, WSX- or titanium-containing MoSx- or MoWx-coatings.<br>
The sliding layer can be applied, as already mentioned, directly on the (AlyCr1-y) X<br>
coating or after applying further adhesive coating, which could be designed as metallic,<br>
nitride, carbide, carbonitride or even as gradient coating with continuous transition<br>
between (AlyCr1-y) X- and sliding layer, in order to achieve a good adhesion of the<br>
coating combination.<br>
For example, WC/C- or CrC/C-coatings can be produced after applying a sputtered or<br>
arc-ed Cr- or Ti-adhesive coating by sputtering WC-targets under addition of a carbon-<br>
containing gas. The share of carbon-containing gas is increased with time, in order to<br>
attain a larger share of free carbon in the coating layer.<br>
Further advantageous applications for different (AlyCr1-y) X hard-coated tools are<br>
described below with examples of applications for different cutting operations.<br>
Example 1: Milling of structural steel<br>
Tool: Shank mill for hard metal<br>
Diameter D = 8 mm, no of teeth z = 3<br>
Material: Structural steel Ck 45,DIN1.1191<br>
Milling parameters:<br>
Cutting velocity vc = 200/400 m/min.<br>
Thrust velocity vf = 2388/4776 mm/min.<br>
Radial gripping width ae = 0.5 mm<br>
Axial gripping width ap = 10 mm<br>
Cooling: emulsion 5%<br>
Process: down-cut milling<br>
Wear criteria: free surface wear VB = 0.12 mm<br><br>
Example 1 shows a comparison of the tool edge life of coated HM-millers, which were<br>
tested for different cutting parameters.<br>
It becomes thereby very clear that in comparison to the industrially used coating systems<br>
so far, like TiCN and TiAIN, the mentioned AlCrN-coatings have higher tool edge lives.<br>
It is further clear from the result that with increasing Al-content there is an improvement<br>
in the tool edge life behaviour (compare with experiment no. 3, 5, 6), as long as cubic<br>
Bl-structure is retained as shown in example 1. This is primarily on account of improved<br>
oxidation resistance and hardness (see table 1) that can be determined with increasing Al-<br>
content. Particularly in the area of dry machining and high-velocity machining (e.g. vc =<br>
400 m/min.), the very good oxidation resistance of the AlCrN-coating plays a role.<br>
Furthermore, it can also be determined in this test that on reversing the crystal lattice<br>
from VI to V4 structure, the wear behaviour gets worse (compare with experiment 3 and<br>
4).<br>
Example 2: Milling of austenitic steel<br>
Tool: Shank miller for hard metal<br>
Diameter D = 8 mm, no of teeth z = 3<br>
Material: austenitic steel X 6 CrNiMoTi 17 12 2, DIN 1.4571<br>
Milling parameters:<br>
Cutting velocity vc = 240 m/min.<br>
Tooth thrust fz = 0.08 mm<br>
Radial gripping width ae = 0.5 mm<br>
Axial gripping width ap = 10 mm<br>
Cooling: emulsion 5%<br>
Process: down-cut milling<br>
Wear criteria: free surface wear VB = 0.1 mm<br><br>
Example 2 shows a comparison of tool edge lives of coated HM-millers. Here also,<br>
similarly with the AlCrN-coating an improvement in wear could be achieved as<br>
compared to industrially used hard substance coatings. The tool edge life improvement<br>
for AlCrN could be achieved, on the one hand, by means of a not yet proved slight<br>
inclination of the second alloy element Cr to the material lubrication, as compared to Ti<br>
in TiAIN-coatings, and on the other hand, on account of the good wear resistance of the<br>
AlCrN-coatings (A, B, D) as per the invention as one can see in table 1, with<br>
simultaneous high hardness.<br>
Example 3: Milling of hardened tool<br>
Tool: Ball-end miller for hard metal<br>
Diameter D = 10 mm, no of teeth z = 3<br>
Material: K 340 (62 HRC) corresponding to C 1.1%, Ai 0.9%, Mn 0.4%, Cr 8.3%, Mo<br>
2.1%, Mo 2.1%, V 0.5%.<br>
Milling parameters:<br>
Cutting velocity vc = 0 - 20 m/min.<br>
Tooth thrust fz = 0.1 mm<br>
Radial gripping width ae = 0.2 mm<br>
Axial gripping width ap = 0.2 mm<br>
Cooling: dry<br>
Process: down-cut milling and conventional milling, finishing<br>
Wear criteria: free surface wear VB = 0.3 mm<br><br>
Example 3 and Example 4 show an improved withstanding path of the AlCrN-coatings as<br>
compared to the industrially used TiAIN-coatings. AlCrN is suitable also particularly for<br>
dry milling which requires high specifications with respect to oxidation resistance and<br>
wear resistance.<br>
Example 5: Boring in tool steel<br>
Tool: borer HSS (S 6-5-2), diameter D = 6 mm<br>
Material: tool steel X 210 Cr 12, DIN 1.2080 (230 HB)<br>
Boring parameters:<br>
Gutting velocity vc = 35 m/min.<br>
Thrust f= 0.12 mm<br>
Bore hole depth z = 15 mm, bottom hole<br>
Cooling: emulsion 5%<br>
Wear criteria: torque switch-off (corresponds to a corner wear of &gt; 0.3 mm)<br><br>
Example 6 shows a comparison of the standardized no of holes of HSS-boring over the<br>
layer thickness with AlyCr1-y N/AlCr1-y CN coatings having different Al content.<br>
Layers were produced with the parameters corresponding to table 2. There one can see<br>
that with increasing aluminium content there is an increase in withstanding time up to<br>
nearly 70% share of the aluminium in the metal content. On further increasing and hence<br>
depositing of the coating with hexagonal crystal structure, the performance/capacity<br>
however drops significantly. In the range between 41.5 and 69.5 % Al (experiment 15,<br>
17), one could see a clear performance increase for this application as compared to the<br>
state-of-the-art technology (experiment 18).<br>
Example 6. Deep hole boring 5 x D in Ck45<br>
Tool: borer of hard metal, diameter D == 6.8 mm<br>
Material: construction steel 1.1191 (Ck 45)<br>
Boring parameters:<br>
Cutting velocity vc = 120 m/min.<br>
Thrust f= 0.2 mm<br>
Bore hole depth z = 34 mm, bottom hole<br>
Cooling: emulsion 5%<br>
Wear criteria: corner wear VB = 03 mm.<br><br>
Example 6 shows an improved withstanding path of the AlCrN-coating as compared to<br>
the industrially used TiAIN-coatings for a boring application. Here the improved<br>
abrasive wear resistance of the AlCrN-coating as per the invention plays a role.<br>
Additionally, as in the case of experiment no.20, coated borers were provided with a WC-<br>
carbon sliding coating after applying a Cr-adhesive layer, whereby under otherwise same<br>
testing conditions, one could achieve a clearly improved withstanding time. Toque<br>
measurements carried out simultaneously revealed a clearly lower torque than without<br>
slidifig coating. One could also determine a better surface quality of the bored holes and<br>
till shortly before ending the withstanding time, there was no colouring due to excessive<br>
temperature load.<br>
Example 7: Thread-boring 2 x D in austenitic steel<br>
Tool: thread-borer HSS, thread dimension M 8<br>
Material: austenitic steel 1.4571 (X6 Cr Ni Mo Ti 17/12/2)<br>
Cutting parameters:<br>
Cutting velocity vc = 3 m/min<br>
Thread depth: 2 x D<br>
Thread type: sack hole<br>
No of threads: 64<br>
Cooling: emulsion 5%<br>
Wear criteria: torch flow over thread number, optical wear assessment after 64 threads.<br><br>
Explanation for (1)<br>
+ satisfactory wear behaviour during thread-boring<br>
++ good wear behaviour during thread-boring<br>
+++ very good wear behaviour during thread-boring<br>
In all AlCrN-coatings one can achieve a reduction in average maximum cutting moment<br>
as compared to the state-of-the-art technology (TiCN). On account of the very good wear<br>
resistance of the higher aluminium-containing coatings, one further gets improved wear<br>
behaviour as compared to TiCN. However, in this example, probably on account of the<br>
adhesive inclination of the aluminium that leads to material lubrication and then to<br>
coating dissolutions, the coating from experiment no. 23 shows a better wear picture than<br>
no. 22.<br>
Thread borers coated as in experiment no. 22 and 23 were additionally provided with a<br>
Ti-containing MoS2-coating after applying a AlCr-adhesive layer with a WC/carbon-<br>
sliding layer, or after applying a Ti-adhesive layer, whereby similarly under otherwise<br>
same testing conditions, one could achieve an improvement in withstanding time and a<br>
better surface quality of the machined material.<br>
Example 8: Hob miller on Cr-Mo steel<br>
Tool: hob cutter<br>
Material: DIN S 6-7-7-10 (ASP 60)<br>
Diameter D = 80 mm, length L = 240 mm, modulus m = 1.5<br>
25 chip grooves<br>
Gripping angle a = 20°<br>
Reference profile 2, no of teeth 50, passage width 25 mm<br>

Cutting velocity vc = 260 m/min.<br>
Thrust: 2 mm/U<br>

Cooling: dry cutting, compressed air for removing the chips<br><br>
In the experiments 25 to 30 several hob millers made of powder-metallurgic high-<br>
velocity steel (HSS) were tested with different coating systems in dry cut. With the tools<br>
coated as per the invention (experiment 29 and 30) one could achieve significant<br>
improvements with respect to the known TiCN or TiAIN-coated millers. It can also be<br>
similarly identified that AlCrN-coatings with low (no. 28) or too high Al-content offer a<br>
slight protection against wear if a hexagonal crystal structure (no. 27) is present.<br>
Even the following example numbers 31 to 33 show the clear superiority of AlCrN-<br>
coating as per the invention with cubic crystal lattice, especially stoichiometric nitrogen<br>
share and an Al-content of 66%. Hob millers made of PM HSS or hard metal were<br>
thereby tested in dry as well as in emulsion-lubricated cutting.<br>

Further experiments, not mentioned here in details, yielded a very good tool edge life<br>
duration even at higher cutting velocity ranges up to vc = 450 m/min. Even the tool edge<br>
lives of coated hard metal rolling millers could be significantly increased in wet<br>
machining as well as in dry machining.<br>
Example 9. Rough milling of tool steel<br>
Material: shank mill HSS<br>
Diameter D = 10 mm, no of teeth z = 4<br>

Milling parameters:<br>
Cutting velocity vc = 60 m/min.<br>
Tooth thrust f2 = 0.05 mm<br>
Radial gripping width ae = 3 mm<br>
Axial gripping width a, = 5 mm<br>
Cooling: emulsion 5%<br>
Process: down=cut milling, roughing<br>

Similar results were also achieved with powder-metallurgically produced cermet<br>
consisting of a TiN, TiC or a Ti (CN)-phase to which in individual cases molybdenum<br>
and/or tantalum was added. As binder phase, Ni or Ni/Co was used.<br>
Example 11: Thread-forming in galvanized plate<br>

TiAIN: 3500 threads<br>
(Alo.66 Cro.34) N: 8800 threads<br>
Experiments with coated CBN (cubic boron nitride) or cermet tools: reversible cutting<br>
plates made of different CBN-sintering materials with a CBN-content between 30 - 99%<br>
by volume, rest being binding agents, were coated on one side with known TiAIN-<br>
coatings according to experiment 8 and on the other side with AlCrN-coatings as per the<br>
invention according to experiment 3, 5 and 6. However, on account of the non-<br>
conducting character of CBN-sintering material, for the etching and coating process<br>
pulsed substrate bias was applied in the medium frequency range, preferably in a<br>
frequency range of 20 to 250 KHz.<br>
For materials with a CBN-content up to 90%, a binding agent powder was used, which<br>
consists of at least one of the elements of the following group: nitride, carbide, boride and<br>
oxide of Ti-, V- or Cr-group, i.e. IVa-, Va- and Vla-elements as well as aluminium or Al-<br>
compounds.<br>
For materials with a CBN-content up to 95% a binding agent powder was used, which<br>
consists of titanium nitride and at least one of the elements of the following group:<br>
cobalt, nickel, tungsten carbide, aluminium or an aluminium compound.<br>
For materials with a CBN-content greater than 90%, also a binding agent powder was<br>
used which consists of titanium nitride and at least one of the elements of the following<br>
group: boride or boron nitride of alkali metals or mineral alkali metals.<br>
In subsequently conducted turning and milling experiments, in most cases one could find<br>
a clearly improved wear behaviour as compared to TiAIN-coatings. Similar was the case<br>
in a particularly cumbersome external turning experiment, in which only a partially<br>
hardened shaft of complex geometry was machined in interrupted cut.<br>

Work-piece: 1.0338<br>
Process: the tool is pressed against the work-piece with a rotation speed of approx. 2800<br>
rpm, 3000 N. Due to the kinetic energy the work-piece becomes red hot, i.e. is brought to<br>
approx. 1000° C and deformed.<br><br>
