				<td>Priority is claimed to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/723,880, filed October 4, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/820,743, filed July 28, 2006, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to methods of making low-fat, fat free, or full-fat snack food products, and products made according to the method, in which food pieces are subjected to enzyme and/or cation treatment and/or specific cooking and/or drying techniques, to provide for snack food products having the texture, flavor, and other characteristics of conventional full-fat products.<br>
Snack food products typically are made by frying sliced vegetable pieces in hot oil so that the moisture content of the sliced food pieces is reduced to a very low level and fat content is raised exponentially. Such products generally have a characteristic crispness that adds significantly to its organoleptic desirability. Fried potato or apple chips prepared using conventional methods generally have a fat content from about 30 percent to about 40 percent by weight, a percentage of fat that is considered by some to be unhealthy if these types of products are broadly substituted for low-fat foods and consumption is significant over time. While such products are accepted in the marketplace, consumers' desire to lower their fat consumption, limits this acceptance.<br>
Furthermore, the conventional methods generally used, require these foods to be fried at high temperatures that can result in the production of potentially deleterious by-products. Reports of such by-products in recent years have led to general concerns about both fried and baked foods, especially those containing high amounts of fats and carbohydrates. Reports of acrylamide formation, generally in proportion to the degree of browning of foods high in fats and carbohydrates, have raised significant concerns within the food industry, the potential for harmful effects of this particular processing by-product.<br>
concerns, efforts have been made to reduce the amount of fat in such snack food products, and more recently, to find ways to minimize formation of potentially deleterious substances such as acrylamide and the like.<br>
In recent years, "light" chips have been made using synthetic oils/fat that is substantially non-digestible and consequently non-absorbable by the human body, e.g. OLESTRA™. These products have received limited acceptance due in part to off-flavors perceived by some reports of detrimental gastrointestinal side effects and an FDA requirement of a warning label on such products, providing information that such fat substitutes may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as loose stools and abdominal cramping and/or the inhibition of absorption of some nutrients.<br>
While products such as potato and apple chips are typically made using conventional frying methods, snack food products made with other nutritionally beneficial vegetables and fruits such as carrots, squash, parsnips, yuccas, pears, and the like have not successfully entered the market substantially due to the lack of proper processing methods.<br>
There have been numerous efforts in the past to reduce the amount of fat in snack foods such as potato chips.<br>
Roan (U.S. Patent No. 4,058,631) discloses a method of making fried food in which raw food product is treated with an aqueous solution of an enzyme, such as alpha amylase, for a period of time sufficient for the enzyme to penetrate and coat the surface of the food, and thereafter the food product is deep fried. Roan indicates that when the surface of a raw, starchy food product is coated with an aqueous solution of alpha amylase prior to frying, less fat is absorbed in the food during frying than occurs without the enzyme treatment, and the flavor of the fried food is improved.<br>
Dreher et al. (U.S. Patent No. 4,756,916) discloses a process for producing low oil potato chips comprising washing potato slices with an aqueous solution, and applying oil to the washed slices to coat the slices with oil. The oil-coated slices are arranged as a monolayer on an endless conveyor belt, blanched at a temperature between about 160°F and 212°F, and then baked at a high temperature of at least about 390°F but below the smoke point of the oil, to partially dry the slices by<br>
feaacrh1gftrfe'ac|tife1biJs'lrtiDlsture content of the slices to about 10-20% by weight. The partially dried slices then are further baked at a lower temperature of about 290°-320°F to finish drying the slices by reducing the aqueous moisture content of the slices to about 2% by weight or less, to produce a product having an oil content of between about 10-25% by weight.<br>
Laufer (U.S. Patent No. 5,292,540) discloses a process for preparing potato chips comprising the steps of washing potatoes to remove foreign matter from the skin thereof, cutting the potato into thin slices, baking the slices for a period of about six to twelve minutes within a temperature range of about 250 to 500°F, and heating the slices in a microwave oven for about two to seven minutes.<br>
Yamashita (U.S. Patent No. 5,312,631) discloses a method for preventing cut pieces of agricultural products from sticking to each other during the steps of drying and cooking, which includes washing the cut pieces with, or immersing the same in, a solution of an amylolytic enzyme, or an acidic or alkaline aqueous solution. The cut pieces are blanched prior to enzyme treatment.<br>
Zussman (U.S. Patent No. 5,370,898) discloses a cooking process for food chip products that does not involve oil-based cooking. Food slices are washed with water to remove extractable surface starch, multi-layered, transported to an oven, and baked in a fluidized bed of hot air or steam. The baking process is a multi-step process, whereby the food slices are exposed to a higher pressure in a first zone for several minutes to ensure that the individual food pieces are separated. The pressure is then lowered in a second zone for a second period of time. Similarly, in a third zone the pressure is reduced for a predetermined period of time to finish cooking the food products. Thereafter the chips are air-dried or finished in a dryer.<br>
Lewis et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,441,758) discloses the preparation of low-fat or fat free potato chips or straws by a process comprising slicing potatoes to form slices or straws, blanching the sliced potato, and treating the slices during or after blanching with a high temperature amylase enzyme to prevent later sticking together of slices during processing. The slices are thereafter dehydrated to a moisture content of 12% to 30%, and thereafter toasted to about 2% moisture at a temperature of 140°C<br>
to jacr-CJ'.^Tfie-tildiciifi'hl^h temperature amylase is required so that the enzyme remains effective during processing, and is not inactivated by the blanching step.<br>
Petelle et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,470,600) discloses a method of making fat-free potato chips, by initially cooking potato slices in a three zone primary oven, by first radiant heating the slices and then subjecting the slices to two successive stages of forced air heating to reduce the moisture content of the slices to near a final moisture content. Petelle et al. further discloses independently controlling the time duration in each of the three zones, simultaneously forcing the air into the top and bottom surfaces of the slices in the primary oven to a near final moisture content of about 15% by weight, independently controlling the time duration of the slices in the dielectric heater to a final moisture content of about 7% by weight using wavelengths of about 65.8 feet at a frequency of about 15 mhz, and allowing the slices to successively, increasingly pile up in the last two forced air stages and the dielectric heating stage.<br>
Benson et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,603,973) discloses a process for making potato chips without the use of oil, wherein whole potatoes are cut into discrete slice pieces which are washed to remove starch or debris from the slice surfaces. The slices are arranged in a single layer and the surface water is removed from the slice surfaces by exposing them to blasts of air and suction. Alternatively, the slices may be washed in warm water at a temperature of about 130°F to preheat them. The slices are transferred to a heated conveyor to enter an infrared zone for exposure to high intensity infrared energy for a short period of time, less than 25 seconds, effecting a blanching of the slices and quenching of naturally-occurring deleterious enzyme action. In a subsequent step, dry air is impinged upon the slices from above and below to reduce the water content below 35% by weight. The slices are accumulated in a multi-layer pack and dried in moving air until moisture content has been obtained to a level on the order of 0.5% to 2%.<br>
Wiedersatz (U.S. Patent No. 5,858,431) discloses a method for preparing fat-free snack chips, comprising preparing slices of raw food product, which are subjected to a high intensity air knife arrangement to remove surface moisture, then exposed to a hot air fluid bed impingement including multiple dual-zone hot air fluid bed impingement ovens operating under different predetermined conditions. In the<br>
4 preferred1 embodiWeilfrthe slices are exposed to two dual-zone hot air fluid bed impingement ovens, the first oven having a conveyor belt transporting slices through the oven at a speed of 2.5 to 3.0 feet per minute and operating at 500 to 525°F (zone 1) and 450 to 500°F (zone 2), and the second oven having a conveyor belt operating at a speed of 1.5 to 2.0 feet per second and at 350 to 400°F (zone 1) and 300 to 350°F (zone 2). The first impingement oven of the preferred embodiment removes approximately 50 to 60 per cent of the moisture in each slice, while the second impingement oven of the preferred embodiment removes approximately 20 to 30 per cent of the remaining moisture. The slices may then have oil and/or seasoning applied thereto, and are passed to a combination microwave and hot air dryer which removes entrained moisture without scorching the chips.<br>
Xu et al. (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0004085) discloses methods for producing a consumable product from potatoes, comprising: (a) treating a potato substance with an effective amount of one or more exogenous enzymes selected from the group consisting of an amyloglucosidase, glucose oxidase, laccase, lipase, maltogenic amylase, pectinase, pentosanase, protease, and transglutaminase, and (b) processing the enzyme-treated potato substance to produce a potato product. In one embodiment, blanching of the potato substance may occur prior to enzyme treatment. The processing step may include frying in oil or baking.<br>
Despite the many advances in the processing of snacks and chips, there nevertheless remains a need for improvements to these products, and the processes for making them, characterized by improved crispness, mouth feel and flavor properties, reduction of fat content and overall improvement in nutritional profile, including minimization of exposure to conditions that can result in the formation of potentially deleterious by-products, all resulting from processes that are feasible, efficient, manageable, and are practically and economically scaleable for production at output levels necessary for product commercialization in an adequately fuel efficient production environment. There also remains a need for eliminating the conventional deep frying processes that traditionally have been used for the production of full-fat and some reduced fat snack foods, and controlling the amount of fat in such products to provide a predetermined amount. Further, there remains a need for snack food products made from certain fruits vegetables, nuts, grains and<br>
theiiKerortneTieaitroer versions of numerous currently available snack products, not previously feasible to make and the methods for their production.<br>

Additional features of the invention can be understood in reference to the accompanying descriptive matter in which there is illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
PiaeR^efrFW WEPREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a snack food product processed in such a manner so as to provide a plurality of cut or shaped food pieces that have a taste, texture and/or appearance of conventionally produced products made by a process including a step in which the food pieces are fried in oil (typically at temperatures of greater than about 300°F). Preferably, a snack food product prepared in accordance with the present invention has at least one, preferably at least three, preferably at least five, of the following attributes: a crisp texture, a fat content of less than about 0.5% by weight, a moisture content of greater than about 0.5% by weight, a ratio of percent by weight of moisture to percent by weight of fat of at least about 12, and the food pieces will fracture at less than or equal to about 12 N and have an average Young's modulus of equal to or greater than about 3.5 N/mm.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment the present invention provides a snack food product and the method of its production and/or cooking processed in such a manner so as to provide a plurality of cut or shaped food pieces that (i) have a new and/or unique taste, texture and/or appearance, or (ii) have less fat and/or are considered as healthier versions of currently available products, or (Hi) have been made from vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, legumes or any other consumable ingredients and their combination thereof where the production of such products were not previously feasible due to lack proper production and/or cooking methods.<br>
Surprisingly, the present invention has been found to retain the desired high quality, flavor, texture, appearance and consumer acceptability of high-fat snacks, through certain desirable treatment of the raw materials and subsequent cooking under conditions that eliminates, optionally minimizes, and/or controls the amount of contact with fats, such as oils or oil substitutes, and limit the potential for producing potentially deleterious by-products. Further, in contrast with known conventional frying methods, the food pieces may be infused with a predetermined amount of fat in a 'totally controlled environment' during the production process. In addition to being able to control the desired amount of fat being infused into the products of present invention to an exact amount, the present invention entirely eliminates the need for utilizing pools of hot oils or oil substitutes, and maintaining, filtering out, and, at last, in most cases, disposing of the related fats used in the production process.<br>
' fh adctrt!dtlrtne~pr@semin^ention also eliminates the need for using defatters in the production of relevant low-fat snack food products.<br>
The term "food pieces" is intended to include substantially any foods.   Preferably, the food pieces may be provided as cut or shaped food pieces that can be shaped or reshaped directly from their raw state. These foods include potato, beet, pumpkin, squash, tomato, mushroom, zucchini, carrot, eggplant, apple, pear, bananas, berries, grains, beans, nuts, seeds, rutabaga, plantain, taro, okra, onion, parsnip, yam, sweet potato, yucca, papaya, mango, pineapple, and the like. These foods include pureed, sliced, diced, milled, grinded, powdered, or pulverized fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, beans, seeds and the like, including products such as beans, rice, corn, wheat and the like. Singly or in combinations, the aforementioned products and ingredients can be manipulated to form sheets, slices or pieces of food composition through extrusion or sheeting of a prepared dough or mixture and the like. The dough or mixture thus formed then can be extruded or cut into any desired shapes. There are many variations on this basic procedure for manipulating flour or dough into a shape suitable for the present process. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,600,193 (mixing corn flour with seasonings); 3,922,370 (mixing water, rice and rice flour); and 3,348,950 (mixing corn, sucrose, water, and corn grits), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, the process of the invention can be used with all foods that were heretofore fried or with foods that cannot tolerate the frying process. The format of the food can include, for example, sticks, strips, slices, chips, crinkle cut, waffles, flakes, and the like. Flaked products may be made into bars or cereals themselves or used as ingredients for granola, granola bars, or add-ins to yogurt, cereals, trail mixes, snack mixes, and the like.<br>
For example, corn tortilla products or bean chips can be prepared initially by forming a composition from water and corn or bean flour, or alternatively cooked corn or beans, and cooked in conventional tortilla ovens. Tortilla or bean strips or rounds can be treated and processed using the current invention to produce fat free or low fat snack products that have a crispy texture and flavor of fried foods without frying in oil or oil substitutes. Generally, the process of the present invention can be used with<br>
all Sfiack'Tbbds-th&amp;t ha^fe-tbditionally been fried in oil to achieve a crisp texture and traditional fried flavor.<br>
In another embodiment, the sheeted or extruded dough or mixture described herein can be made from a potato mixture or other starch material, alone or in combination with other ingredients, and then processed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention to a crispy finished product without frying.<br>
Preferred food pieces are derived from fruits and/or vegetables that have a generally solid inner matrix that is exposed when sliced and demonstrates fracturability when a slice is bent. In a preferred embodiment, the food pieces are derived from potatoes such as those generally used to produce potato chips. In preferred embodiments, the food pieces comprise a potato substrate. The potato substrate may simply be farm-grown potatoes (e.g. raw potatoes) of any variety. Such varieties include, but are not limited to, Bintje, Russet Burbank, Yukon Gold, Kennebec, Norchip, Atlantic, Shepody, Sebago, Red Pontiac, Red Warba, Irish Cobbler "BC", Norgold Russet "BC", Norland, Atlantic, White Rose, Superior, Centennial Russet, Keswick "NB 1", Green Mountain, La Soda, Red La Rouge, Red Nordland, Red Bliss, Yellow Finnish, Ruby Crescent, and Australian Crescent, Russian Blue, Peruvian Blue, Superior, Katahdin, and sweet potato varieties such as Beauregard, Jewel, Nemagold, Centennial, Excel, Regal, Southern Delite (Hernandez, Vardaman .Travis, White Delight, Sumor, Nancy Hall, Picadita, Campeon, Star Leaf/Boniato, Japanese, Chinese, and Okinawan Purple and the like.<br>
In accordance with first and/or second embodiments of the invention, a method is provided for making a snack food product, comprising,<br>
(a)	providing a plurality of cut or shaped food pieces;<br>
(b)	exposing the food pieces to a solution comprising one or more enzymes<br>
and/or one or more cations to coat the surface thereof;<br>
(c)	thereafter blanching the plurality of food pieces for a time sufficient to<br>
inactivate any enzymes on the surface of the food pieces, wherein the food pieces<br>
have an initial moisture level after the blanching step; and<br>
(d)	reducing the initial moisture level to a final moisture level of from about<br>
0.2 to about 10% by weight. In accordance with additional embodiments, the final<br>
moisture level is preferably from about 0.5 to about 5.0% by weight.<br>
' An1ntefM6diate"Mdistare"ffevel of about 10 to about 80% by weight, preferably about 10 to about 50% by weight, more preferably about 15 to about 35% by weight, may be achieved with a number of the embodiments of the present invention. Thereafter, the food pieces are exposed to a second moisture level reduction procedure which reduces the intermediate moisture level to the final moisture level. The intermediate and the final drying steps may further be broken down to sub steps, or alternatively combined into one step.<br>
Suitable enzymes, forms taken by the enzymes, commercial availability, etc. for use in accordance with the present invention are chosen from one or more of the enzymes listed in U.S. Patent No. 4,058,631; U.S. Patent No. 5,312,631; and U.S. Patent No. 7,056,544, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. Preferably, the enzyme is other than a high-temperature enzyme, such as the high temperature amylase described in U.S. Patent No. 5,441,758. However, under certain circumstances, such an enzyme may be used in accordance with the invention, and the use of a high temperature enzyme is not disclaimed herein. Preferred enzymes in accordance with the present invention include amylase, cellulase, invertase, pectinase and amyloglucosidase, with amylase being the most preferred. Preferably, the one or more enzymes is present in the solution at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 5% by weight.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the enzyme solution may further comprise one or more cations, or the cations can be provided in a solution without enzymes. The term "cation-producing compound" is intended to include compounds in which cations are produced in solution via dissociation of the cation with an anion, either at ambient temperatures or with the addition of heat. Suitable cation-producing compounds in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, alkali metal salts, such as lithium, sodium and/or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, such as magnesium and/or calcium salts; aluminum compounds; and group VA metal compounds, such as nitrogen, phosphorous and/or bismuth compounds (e.g., ammonium). More preferred from this set of compounds are calcium salts, magnesium salts, potassium salts, aluminum compounds and nitrogen compounds, with calcium salts being the most preferred. Preferably, the one or<br>
s is-presenrirfthe solution at a concentration of from about 0.1 to" about 5% by weight, more preferably from about 0.2 to about 2.5% by weight.<br>
The exposure of the food pieces to the enzyme solution, optionally including cations as described above, or the cation solution without enzymes, provides various improved properties to the snack food product. The term "improved property" is defined herein as any property of a snack food product that is altered by the action of the one or more enzymes and/or cations relative to a snack food product in which the food pieces are not treated with such a solution. The improved property may include, but is not limited to, increased crispiness, reduced stickiness, increased firmness of the raw and/or blanched material, reduced browning from enzymatic and/or Maillard reactions, increased color brightening, increased color retention, increased color enhancement, reduced color fading, increased stiffness, increased rugged or smooth appearance, improved flavor, and reduced fat content. Many of these terms are defined more fully in U.S. Patent No. 7,056,544, hereby incorporated by reference. The other terms are defined in accordance with their customary meaning as would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
It will be appreciated that crispness and/or stiffness can be increased in a measured way, so that, for instance, if a certain crispness or a certain stiffness is desired to achieve certain processing goals or for producing a certain finished snack food product, crispness or stiffness can be controlled by varying the amount of exposure to the one or more enzymes and/or cations.<br>
The improved property may be determined by comparison of a snack food product prepared in accordance with the methods of the present invention, versus a snack food product prepared in accordance with prior art methods. Techniques for determining such improved properties achieved by use of the present methods are described herein. Organoleptic qualities may be evaluated using procedures well established in the food industry, and may include, for example, the use of a trained panel of sensory evaluators. Other methods could include texture analysis and comparisons such as those disclosed herein below.<br>
Preferably, the food pieces are exposed to the enzyme solution (with or without cations), or the cation solution, for a time of about 0.5 to about 45 minutes, more<br>
15 minutes, most preferably about 0.5 to about •&amp; minutes.<br>
In alternative embodiments, other nutrients including vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin A, Vitamin, B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folic Acid, Phosphorous, Magnesium, Copper, Calcium, Zinc, Iron and the like can be added to the products of present invention either by infusing such vitamins and minerals into the food pieces in the enzyme treatment, cation treatment and/or blanching process, or in an additional step or by spraying a compound including any desired vitamins and/or minerals over the food pieces prior to or after cooking. This procedure results in a product that is nutritionally fortified and provides an opportunity to make snack food products that are healthier. In alternate embodiments, flavor enhancers and seasoning blends such as salt (NaCI), sugar, herb extracts, fruit extracts, vegetable extracts and the like or a combination thereof can be infused into the snack food product by steeping or soaking the cut food pieces with the respective salt, sugar, herbs, fruits, vegetables and the like, thereby incorporating these flavoring components into the food pieces either in the blanch water and/or by having a separate step following or prior to the blanching step in which flavors are fused into the cut food pieces. Alternately, cut food pieces may be soaked in concentrated flavor extracts that are either aqueous or otherwise. In yet another embodiment, the snack food products of the present invention may be coated with chocolate, caramel, syrups, and coatings made from fruits or vegetables or any other similar covering, thereby creating other novel gourmet snacks that are free of, or alternatively low or high in fat.<br>
If preferred, any predetermined amount of digestible and/or synthetic fat, such as an oil or oil substitute, may be added to and/or blended and mixed with the dough or mixture prior to cooking or alternatively can be applied in any process such as spraying on the food pieces, prior to, during, or after the pre-cooking step. Preferably, the oil is a cooking oil not containing fatty acids such as canola, sunflower or safflower oils, which may be applied to the vegetable pieces by either spraying the oil onto the food pieces or by flash soaking the food pieces in oil or by any other feasible method, such as applying to the blanch water or spraying onto a conveyer belt or a tray before and/or after food pieces are placed onto such tray or<br>
belt* ffi'alfetriate" fetntiodiments where oil is used, although any food grade oiror on substitute can be used, the preferred oils will be unrefined oils and those having a low smoke point, preferably extra virgin olive oil, hemp seed oil, walnut oil, sesame oil, flaxseed oil, coconut oil, unrefined canola oil, semi-refined canola oil, unrefined peanut oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, high-oleic sunflower oil, unrefined corn oil, soy oil, unrefined soy oil, unrefined sesame oil, flavor infused oils, emulsified vegetable shortening, and the like, synthetic oils such as OLESTRA™ and the like. Alternative oils that offer health benefits, such as SMART BALANCE™, ENOVA™ and the like, may be used either alone or in combination with other natural or synthetic oils such as those discussed above.<br>
Food Piece Preparation. The food pieces are cut, formed or shaped from one or a combination of food materials. For raw vegetables or raw plant materials, the food pieces are preferably cleaned, optionally peeled, and cut. Preferred vegetables such as potatoes, vegetables, fruit, or other food products are preferably cut into slices, sticks or strips of a desirable size and shape for chips, sticks, shoestrings, wavy cut chips, crinkle cut chips, waffle cut chips, straight cut chips and sticks and the like. After cutting, forming or shaping, the prepared food pieces are preferably contacted with an aqueous solution, such as a water, to remove free starch. Removing the free starch is best for optimizing use and reducing the amount of enzyme, plus free starch can leave a powdery appearance after drying the chip.<br>
Enzyme and/or Cation Treatment: The prepared food pieces may be exposed to an enzyme solution or a cation solution, more preferably an enzyme and cation solution. When enzyme treatment is performed, the enzymes are preferably used in amounts that contribute to one or more of the improved properties as defined herein and/or provide at least one of the following advantages: increasing the crispness, reducing the stickiness and improving color of finished products. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the optional cations increase the activity of the enzymes, reducing time in the solution, and also make the cut food pieces more firm or rigid so they are easier to process. Further, cations may also decrease enzymatic browning as well as contribute to the snack food product's nutritional profile.<br>
The appropriate exposure to a given enzyme or cation for improving a specific property or properties of a snack food product will depend on the enzyme or cation in<br>
sWltedi"fU'e"rst&gt;n may determine a suitable enzyme or cation exposure on the basis of methods known in the art. Where both enzyme and cation treatments are performed, the treatments are preferably carried out simultaneously using a single solution, although the treatments may also be performed separately using an enzyme solution followed by a cation solution, or a cation solution followed by an enzyme solution. Salts and/or flavoring ingredients can also be added to any of the solutions.<br>
The enzymes to be used in the methods of the present invention may be in any form suitable for the use in question, e.g., in the form of a dry powder, agglomerated powder, or granulate, in particular a non-dusting granulate, a liquid, in particular a stabilized liquid, or a protected enzyme. Granulates and agglomerated powders may be prepared by conventional methods, e.g., by spraying the enzyme(s) onto a carrier in a fluid-bed granulator. The carrier may consist of particulate cores having a suitable particle size. The carrier may be soluble or insoluble, e.g., a salt (such as NaCI or sodium sulfate), a sugar (such as sucrose or lactose), a sugar alcohol (such as sorbitol), starch, rice, corn grits, or soy. The enzymes may be contained in slow-release formulations. Methods for preparing slow-release formulations are well known in the art. Liquid enzyme preparations may, for instance, be stabilized by adding nutritionally acceptable stabilizers such as a sugar, a sugar alcohol or another polyol, and/or lactic acid or another organic acid according to established methods.<br>
In preferred embodiments the enzyme and/or cation treatment is applied prior to blanching. In alternative embodiments, the enzyme and/or cation treatment is applied concurrently during the blanching, or as an additional treatment after blanching. In the case of certain shaped food pieces such as sheeted products that are made from a combination of food materials or a dough, the enzyme and/or cation treatment may be applied after the shaped food pieces have been through the Initial baking step that is customary in production of such products.<br>
Blanching. Several embodiments of the present invention include a step whereby the food pieces are blanched. Preferably, the food pieces are blanched for a time period sufficient to achieve any of the following: 1) to inactivate any enzymes that naturally occur on the surface of the pieces and/or to inactivate any enzymes added<br>
tiufthgrthe"'e^zymB"treatment step described above; 2) to gelatinize at least a'portion of the naturally occurring starches; 3) to remove excess free sugars so as to reduce Maillard browning and potential for formation of acrylamides; and 4) to improve texture and flavor. Typically, the food pieces are preferably blanched by immersion in an aqueous solution, preferably containing from about 0.5% to about 8% by weight, more preferably from about 2% to about 5% by weight, most preferably about 3% by weight of one or more cations, as defined above. In preferred embodiments, the cations are selected from NaCI, KCI, MgCI2 and CaCI2. The blanching may be conducted at a temperature of preferably from about 60°C to about 120°C, more preferably from about 70°C to about 100°C. In alternate embodiments, the blanching may be conducted by exposure to steam (at ambient or higher pressures), preferably for about 15 seconds to about 10 minutes, more preferably for about 40 seconds to about 3 minutes, depending upon the amount of blanching desired. Alternatively, any known method of blanching such as microwave, Ohmic heating, super heat steam, infrared heating and the like can be used in accordance with the present invention.<br>
If necessary, the food pieces are then preferably drained or conveyed under an air curtain to remove excess water. In alternate embodiments, any known method of removing excess surface water may be employed. Salt can be added before, during or after blanching. Any salts that are suitable for use in foods may be used, but NaCI, KCI, MgCI2, CaCI2 and the like are preferred.<br>
The blanching step may not be applicable and/or necessary in cases of certain shaped food pieces such as sheeted products that are made from a combination of food materials or a dough.<br>
Reducing Moisture Level. The moisture in the food pieces is preferably reduced to a final moisture level of about 0.5 to about 10% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 5% by weight. This moisture reduction may be achieved in a number of different ways.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the moisture reduction step includes cooking the food pieces in one or more dryers or ovens independently selected from the group consisting of forced air convection ovens, fluidized bed dryers/ovens, vibrating<br>
', impingement dryers/ovens, pulsed fluidized bed ' dryers/ovens (e.g., Aero Pulse dryers), rotary dryers/ovens, rotary drum dryers/ovens, rotary spiral drum dryers/ovens, tray ovens, stationary dryers/ovens, spiral roasters/dryers (such as, for example, FMC Spiral Roto-Louvre Roaster/Dryers), microwave dryers/ovens, infrared dryers/ovens, super heat airless driers, vacuum driers, vacuum belt dryers and ohmic dryers, or any similar drying/cooking apparatus.<br>
In one embodiment, the food pieces are cooked for about 0.5 to about 40 minutes at temperature of from about 160°F to about 400°F, more preferably from about 275°F to about 325°F.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the moisture reduction comprises bringing the food pieces to a first temperature for a first time period, and thereafter bringing the food pieces to a second temperature for a second time period. Preferably, bringing the food pieces to the first temperature for the first time period, such as but not limited to a temperature of about 160°F to about 400°F, preferably between about 275°F to about 375°F for a time of about 0.5 to about 40 minutes, reduces the initial moisture level to an intermediate moisture level of about 10 to about 80% by weight, and bringing the food pieces to the second temperature for the second time period, such as but not limited to a temperature of about 160°F to about 375°F, preferably between about 275° F and about 350° F, and more preferably between about 300°F to about 325°F for a time of about 4 to about 35 minutes, preferably about 5 to about 12 minutes and more preferably about 6 to about 11 minutes, reduces the intermediate moisture level to the final moisture level of about 0.5 to about 10%. In preferred embodiments, the second temperature is lower than the first temperature.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the first stage of the process comprises drying the food pieces in a rotary dryer, rotary drum dryer, rotary spiral drum dryer, fluidized bed dryer/oven or vibrating fluidized bed dryer/oven to remove up to about 30% by weight, preferably up to about 50% by weight, and most preferably up to about 90% by weight of the initial moisture, and thereafter the second stage reduces the moisture level to the final moisture level of about 0.5 to about 10%. Preferably, the drying step is conducted a temperature of about 160°F to about 400°F, more<br>
pr4fe'irlfefy:Fr6n1&gt;"&amp;b1bi:i(t!1275bF to about 350°F, and even more preferably trom about 300°F to about 325°F, for a time of about 2 to about 40 minutes, more preferably from about 5 to about 25 minutes, and even more preferably from about 6 minutes to about 18 minutes.<br>
In still other preferred embodiments, the reduction of the moisture level to the final moisture level of about 0.5 to about 10% may be accomplished solely using a rotary dryer, rotary drum dryer, rotary spiral drum dryer, fluidized bed dryer/oven or vibrating fluidized bed dryer/oven, in one or more drying steps. No additional cooking procedure is utilized in this embodiment. Generally the same temperature and time conditions indicated above may be used in such an embodiment, over one or more stages.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is drying/cooking with the use of spiral roasters/dryers. The drying principles and product behavior for this method closely mirror rotary ovens and rotary drum drying, except the internal spiral allows for precise control of drying time within the vessel. Typically, in spiral roaster/dryers the drying air entry into the product bed between the spiral flights is through the perforated plate or screen wrapped around the flights. Precise control of drying time within the vessel combined with the use of this method will result in a higher product quality, process effectiveness and added process efficiencies and output levels not experienced or expected previously.<br>
During any of the stages, the food pieces may be exposed to air at an air speed of from about 200 to about 15,000 feet per minute. According to additional, alternative embodiments of the present invention, even lower air velocities may be used depending on the food pieces being prepared and/or the equipment being used. The process is further controlled by selectively increasing and/or decreasing the air speed to control the exposure of the product to temperature and airflow, thereby optimizing the quality of the finished product. Sequential adjustments to temperature and airflow allow for a controlled drying process that beneficially maintains the product temperature below temperatures that cause browning and carmelization until the product reaches a target moisture content. Manipulation of the different zones of temperature and air velocity allow for optimization of the texture, color, and flavor, as well as economical efficiency of the process.<br>
, for example, any similar type rotary dryer or rotary arum dryer, "flash dryers", airless or superheated steam dryer and the like such as, for example, those available from Applied Chemical Technologies, Carrier Vibrating, Inc., The Dupps Company and the like, may be used in place of the dryers. Alternatively, microwave, infrared, impingement, vibrating impingement, tray oven, convection oven, stationary oven, fluidized bed or vibrating fluidized bed drying, vacuum drying, vacuum belt drying or the like can be employed in the process of partially or completely dehydrating the cut food pieces, each resulting in a different degree of efficiency and level of output. The use of a steam blancher, such as those available from the Lyco Company, alone or in combination with any of the foregoing equipments, provide numerous additional alternatives for either a partial or complete dehydrating process. When applicable, any versions of the foregoing equipment described herein in relation to the various embodiments of the present invention, such as, for instances, batch or continuous processing equipment, static or vibrating equipment designs and the like may be employed.<br>
Moisture sensing equipment such as those available from Drying Technologies, Inc. (i.e., DTI 500, DTI 5000) and the like can be installed inside the rotary dryer or the like to ensure proper drying conditions on an automated basis.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the partially dried food pieces are then transferred to an impingement oven, a fluidized bed dryer/oven, a vibrating fluidized bed dryer/oven, a vacuum belt dryer/oven or any other similar equipment via a conveyor belt or any other conveying device or method. After moisture reduction, the resultant snack food products may then be cooled either at ambient or reduced temperatures, and optionally seasoned and/or coated as desired and packaged for distribution and consumption.<br>
Optional seasoning blends can be applied to products preferably using adhesives such as gums, starches, proteins, that can be used to create a sticky surface on the products for adherence of the seasoning blends as is generally known within the food industry.<br>
To obtain a blistered effect on the product surface similar to the typical appearance observed when foods are fried, the food pieces are preferably cooked at a<br>
lempTsraTtrreroraneasr^fife'F after about halfway through the moisture removal. Next, the food pieces are cooked at a temperature of about 310°F with a high velocity air flow (e.g., an air speed of about 500 to about 15,000 feet per minute) to achieve a final moisture content of about 2 to about 5%. The final drying when using certain types of equipment such as a vacuum dryer may take place at temperatures below those indicated above.<br>
The process efficiency can be further improved by, after the moisture reduction is complete, running the food pieces through an "Equilibrator" system, that takes the hot product, exhausts the air from it, pulling off the heat thereby cooling it as the final moisture is removed.<br>
The invention also contemplates reducing the moisture level down to the intermediate moisture level by any of the methods described herein, cooling and storing the moist product at ambient, refrigeration or freezer conditions, then subsequently frying, drying or baking the product to achieve the final moisture level. Alternatively, the frying step may immediately follow the steps of reducing the moisture level down to the intermediate moisture level.<br>
In addition, the invention contemplates flash frying or baking any of the snack food products prepared in accordance with the invention, either in a commercial or retail setting or at home.<br>
The present invention also includes snack food products made by any of the methods described herein.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will be understood upon consideration of the following illustrative and comparative examples.<br>
Example 1: Potato Chips: Approximately 2,333 grams of Yukon Gold variety potatoes were washed, then sliced to an average slice thickness of 1.90 mm, yielding approximately 2288 grams of sliced potatoes. The sliced potatoes were rinsed for 15 seconds in cold water (18"C/65°F) and drained. The drained potato slices were placed in a solution of 0.5% amylase (American Labs, Inc. Fungal Amylase-100,000 SKB/gram Lot ALI00517-04) and 1% aqueous Calcium,Chloride (32% aqueous solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) and held for 3<br>
, the treated potato slices were Diancnea in 93'C (200 degrees F) water containing 3% salt (NaCI) (Cargill Top Flow Salt) for 1 minute. Blanched potato slices were dipped into cold water for about 15 seconds to halt cooking, then drained. The potato slices were then placed directly on a conveyor belt of an impingement oven (Impinger® I, Model No. 1240 from Lincoln Food Service Products, Inc., Fort Wayne, IN) set at 140°C/285°F and belt time of 13.25 minutes. After drying, the potato chips were allowed to cool completely, then placed in moisture proof bags and sealed. The total yield was 467 grams of potato chips. The resulting chips were observed visually and determined to have a light golden color, a good potato chip flavor and a crisp light texture.<br>
Samples were analyzed for moisture using the convection oven method; by measuring the weight lost as a result of heating a ground sample (4 grams, run in triplicate) in a convection oven under controlled conditions (100°C for 24 hours). The percent of weight lost was reported as the percent of moisture in the sample. In this example, the final moisture content was 4.42%.<br>
Samples were analyzed for fat using the chloroform extraction method of F.I. Shahii (see reference provided below) with minor variations:<br>
Prior to extraction, the sample is ground in a blender.<br>
1.	Prepare a 2:1 solution of chloroform: methanol.<br>
2.	Measure 10g of ground sample into a flask; add 50 mis of 2:1<br>
chloroform/methanol solution.<br>
3.	Stir covered for 1 hour.<br>
4.	Pour into a clean flask through filter paper.<br>
5.	Rinse the initial flask and remaining solids into the new flask with a small<br>
amount of the 2:1 solution of chloroform: methanol.<br>
6.	Add 30-35 mis of distilled water and mix.<br>
7.	Let sit at 4°C overnight.<br>
8.	TOfflW^iltfidFflc^ layer containing water and methanol with a water •<br>
aspirator and glass pipette.<br>
9.	Weigh a new round bottom flask and record.<br><br>
10.	Pour the remaining solution into the new flask through a filter, pass the<br>
remaining layer of chloroform (and fat) over sodium sulfate to remove any remaining<br>
water. Wash all of the fat into the flask using additional chloroform.<br>
11.	Using a rotovap at 50°C/80rpm, remove (by evaporation) the remaining<br>
chloroform.<br>
12.	Place flask in the chemical fume hood overnight to completely evaporate any<br>
remaining chloroform.<br>
13.	Weigh flask after drying is complete, record and determine the amount of fat.<br>
The results indicated that the samples contained an average of about 0.30% fat. The average final thickness of the sample chips after drying was determined to be 1.38 mm by measuring thickness of 10 chips using digital calipers.<br>
The "chloroform method" is based upon the method disclosed by F.I. Shahii, "Extraction and Measurement of Total Lipids", Current Protocols in Food Analytical Chemistry. John Wiley and Sons, 2003, pp D1.1.4.<br>

The texture of the potato chips was evaluated using a TA.XT2 Texture Analyzer using a 0.25" diameter ball probe and a chip/cracker fixture. Individual chips were rested over the 18 mm diameter opening on the plate's cylindrical opening, and were punctured with the ball probe. The ball probe traveled at 4.0 mm/s until a force of 10 grams was detected; then the ball probe was punctured through the chips at a speed of 1.0 mm/second. The probe was withdrawn at 10.0 mm/second. A sampling of 25 chips was used for each test. Analysis of the test chips resulted in an average peak<br>
is statistically similar to LAY'S® Light Chips (ULts rn/v-j J25.59 grams of force and Low Fat KETTLE KRISPS™ at 416.06 grams of force. AY'S® Classic was slightly less at 254.23 grams of force.<br>

Test 2: Density measurement of potato chips using the multipycnometer. The multipycnometer (Quantachrome model MVP-D160-E) employs the technique of fluid displacement to determine volume. The fluid used in the instrument is helium. Potato chip volume was determined by measuring the pressure difference when a known quantity of helium is allowed to flow from a known reference volume into the sample cell containing the chips. Samples were weighed before measuring the volume. Each chip was broken into 2-4 pieces to allow them to fit into the measuring cell. Densities were calculated using the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
W	= weight of potato chips (g)<br>
Vc	= Cell volume (cm3)*<br>
VR	= Reference volume (cm3)*<br>
PI	= pressure reading of the reference<br>
P2	= pressure reading of the cell<br>
*VC and VR were established during instrument calibration.<br>

Example 2: Regular Fat-Free Potato Sticks: Russet Burbank Potatoes were peeled and cut Julienne style lengthwise to achieve approximately 2mm height and width. After slicing 540 grams of these, the raw potato sticks were rinsed for under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed sticks were held in a solution containing 500 grams water (43°C/110°F), 5 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 5 grams calcium chloride solution (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated potato sticks were drained, then blanched in 87°C/190°F water containing 3% Cargill Sea Salt (3000g cold water, plus 90g salt) for 1 minute 30 secpnds before draining. Blanched potato sticks were placed directly on perforated aluminum tray<br>
oven (Impinger® I, Model No. 124U rrom uncom r-ooa Service Products, Inc., Fort Wayne, IN) set at 140°C/285°F. Oven belt speed was set at 24 minutes. Every 5 minutes, the tray was shaken to stir the potato sticks to allow for even drying. The process yielded approximately 103 grams of fat-free potato sticks, which were then cooled and packaged. The potato sticks were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a pleasant cooked potato flavor, golden color, and light crisp texture.<br>
Example 3: Larger Size. Puffed Potato Strips: Yukon Gold potatoes were peeled and cut slices approximately 2mm thick. These slices were then cut into strips approximately 6mm wide. Approximately 750 grams of these raw potato strips were rinsed under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed strips were held in a solution containing 500 grams water (43°C/110°F), 5 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 5 grams calcium chloride (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated potato strips were drained, then blanched in 87°C/190°F water containing 3% Cargill Sea Salt (3000g water, plus 90g salt) for 1 minute 30 seconds before draining. The blanched potato strips were placed directly on perforated aluminum tray and put into an impingement oven (Impinger® I, Model No. 1240 from Lincoln Food Service Products, Inc., Fort Wayne, IN) set at 135°C/275°F. Oven belt speed was set at 27 minutes. Every 5 minutes, the tray was shaken to stir the potato strips to allow for even drying. The process yielded approximately 129 grams of fat-free potato strips, with a light texture, approximately 90% of the strips puffed into almost cylindrical shape, giving them the appearance of crispy French fries. The fat-free potato strips were judged by trained sensory professionals to have a very rich buttery flavor, crisp light texture and appetizing appearance.<br>
Example 4: Carrot Chips: Carrots were peeled and cut into slices approximately 2 mm thick. Approximately 500 grams of these carrot slices were rinsed under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed carrot slices were held in a solution containing 500 grams water (43°C/110°F), 5 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 5 grams calcium chloride (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated carrot slices were drained, then blanched in 87°C/190°F water containing 2% Cargill<br>
40 g. salt) for 1 minute 15 seconds before draining.  I ne blanched carrot slices were placed directly on belt of an impingement oven (Impinger® I, Model No. 1240 from Lincoln Food Service Products, Inc., Fort Wayne, IN) set at 135°C/275°F. Oven belt speed was set at 15 minutes. The process yielded approximately 120 grams of fat-free carrot chips, with a light texture, bright orange color and pleasant sweet carrot flavor.<br>
Example 5: Fat-Free Beet Chips: Fresh red beets were peeled and cut into slices approximately 1.6 mm thick. Approximately 590 grams of these beet slices were rinsed under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed beet slices were held in a solution containing 500 grams water (43°C/1100F), 5 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 5 grams calcium chloride (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated beet slices were drained, then blanched in 87°C/190°F water containing 2% Cargill Sea Salt (2000g water, plus 40g salt) for 1 minute 15 seconds before draining. The blanched beet slices were placed directly on belt of an impingement oven (Impinger® I, Model No. 1240 from Lincoln Food Service Products, Inc., Fort Wayne, IN) set at 135°C/275°F. Oven belt speed was set at 15 minutes. The process yielded approximately 130 grams of fat-free beet chips, with a light, crisp texture, dark beet red color and pleasant beet flavor.<br>
Example 6: Fat-Free Parsnip Chips: Fresh parsnip roots were peeled and cut into slices approximately 1.6 mm thick. Approximately 500 grams of these parsnip slices were rinsed under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed parsnip slices were held in a solution containing 500 grams water (43°C/110°F), 5 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 5 grams calcium chloride (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated parsnip slices were drained, then blanched in 87°C/190°F water containing 2% Cargill Sea Salt (2000g water, plus 40g salt) for 1 minute 15 seconds before draining.

Example 28: Use of Rotary or Rotary Drum Dryer as the first step of the cooking process: Chipping potatoes were washed, peeled, sliced to approximately 1.55mm thickness, and then washed and exposed to a solution containing bacterial amylase (Lot No. AL105175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), and calcium chloride solution (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties). Next the enzyme treated potato slices were drained followed by blanching at 87° C/1900 F water containing 2% Cargill sea salt before then again draining. Then the blanched potato<br>
s1ic&amp;S"Were"cooiea'"arfd"$tci!red. Several samples of the sliced potatoes were iesieu on an Omni Mark moisture analyzer available from Denver Equipment Company before and after the dehydrating step. The analyzer indicated that raw enzyme treated potato slices had a moisture level between 80% and 85% after blanching and just prior to drying.<br>
The sliced potatoes were then placed in bulk form inside a rotary drum dryer provided by Spray Dynamics and partially dehydrated in mass quantity at a 
The test was repeated for several times at temperatures ranging between about 275°F and about 350°F and for periods as low as about 5 and as high as about 14 minutes. The visual results were all surprisingly good as in the first trail and consistent among trials.<br>
Moisture levels following the dehydrating processes of various lengths between about 5 to about 14 minutes produced snack food slices with a moisture content ranging between about 40% and about 70%.<br>
To further test the efficacy of the teachings of the present invention an additional test was conducted using the rotary drum dryer available from Spray Dynamics. Potato slices without enzyme treatment were placed in the drum dryer in the same manner as explained above and partially dehydrated at 300°F for periods as high as about 12 minutes. The process consistently produced less preferable results as, following the dehydrating step, the slices had a color, texture, quality, flavor and odor deemed to be commercially undesirable. The drying was inconsistent. Some slices had dried out to a hard consistency similar to and/or as of dehydrated potatoes. Other slices, however, were totally or partially wet or even burnt totally or around the edges. It is believed that food products containing high levels of starch will be greatly enhanced<br>
as the enzyme treatment possibly breaKs down tne sugars on the surface of the food slice.<br>
Then, the pretreated dehydrated potato slices of potatoes processed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention were used to produce potato chips that have same texture, crunchiness, color, taste and mouth feel as conventionally deep fried potato chips. Pretreated potato slices cooked at a temperature of about 300°F for about 8 minutes containing approximately 51% moisture (Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices) were used in the following tests.<br>
Example 28A: Approximately 5,000 grams of the Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices were poured onto the opening conveyer belt of a fluidized bed dryer available from Witte Company and were further massively subjected to heat at a temperature of about 325°F for about 6 minutes. The air velocity was between about 300 to about 350 cfm. The cooked Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices were then left to cool down to ambient temperature (80°F). The resulting potato chips, included some air pockets/blistering resembling conventional fried chips, and had excellent texture, mouth feel, taste, color, and crunchiness totally commensurate with or better than that of their counterpart potato chips that are made through conventionally deep frying methods.   The trial yielded approximately 1,990 grams of fat free potato chips.<br>
Example 28B: Approximately 1,500 grams of the Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices were placed in a multiple layer configuration on the conveyer belt of an industrial Air Force® impingement oven (Heat and Control Company, Hayward, CA 94545) creating a bed depth of 1 inch, then processed for 5.5 minutes at 148°C/300°F. The process yielded approximately 660 grams of fat-free potato chips, which were cooled and packaged. The potato chips were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a pleasant cooked potato flavor, golden color, and light crisp texture.<br>
Example 28C: Approximately 2,000 grams of the Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices were processed further in a multi layer format using an industrial Aeropulse® pulsed-air fluid bed processor (Aeroglide Corporation, Raleigh, NC 27626) set at 148°C/300°F for 5 minutes. The process yielded approximately 830 grams of fat free potato chips, which were cooled and packaged. The potato chips were evaluated by<br>
and were noted to have a pleasant cooked potato flavor, golden color, and light crisp texture.<br>
Example 28D: Approximately 1000 grams of the Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices were further processed using a convection oven (Model # 6203, Lincoln Steam'r Oven, Lincoln Food Service Products, Fort Wayne, IN). The potato slices were placed on perforated trays and cooked in the oven for 12 minutes at 148°C/300°F until the products were fully dried. The trial resulted in approximately 400 grams of finished fat free potato chips. The potato chips were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a pleasant cooked potato flavor, golden color, and light crisp texture.<br>
Example 28E: Approximately 2000 grams of the Pretreated Dehydrated Potato Slices were further processed in a stationary tray dryer (National Dryer Machinery Company, Philadelphia, PA), by placing the potato slices in a layer approximately % inch deep and drying for 16 minutes at a temperature of 148°C/300°F. The trial resulted in approximately 810 grams of fat free potato chips. These chips were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a bright golden color, excellent potato chip flavor and light crisp texture.<br>
Example 29: Impingement oven for initial dry, then vibrating fluidized bed dryer for final Regular Fat Free Potato Chips: Snowden variety chipping potatoes were washed and sliced using a Ditto Dean vegetable slicer with a C3 blade, to achieve slice thicknesses of approximately 1.60mm. After slicing, 3.95 Ibs. of the raw potato slices were rinsed for under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed slices were held in a solution containing 3000 grams water (43°C/110°F), 30 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 30 grams calcium chloride solution (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated potato slices were drained, then blanched using steam in a M-6 Dixie Vegetable Blancher/Cooler (Dixie Canning Company, Athens Georgia, 30603) for 40 seconds.    The blanched potato slices were placed directly on the belt of and impingement oven set at 176°C/350°F, and dried for 5 minutes to reduce the moisture content to 36%, then the chips were layered to a bed depth of 2 inches, then placed into an lab model vibrating fluid bed processor (Carrier Vibrating Equipment, Inc., Louisville, KY 40213) with a drilled<br>
at 160°C/320UF for 2 minutes.  I ne process yielded approximately 1 pound of fat free potato chips, which were cooled and packaged. The potato chips were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a pleasant cooked potato flavor, golden color, and light crisp texture.<br>
Example 30: Steam Blanch, then vibrating fluidized bed dryer for entire drying step on Fat Free Sweet Potato Chips: Common variety sweet potatoes were washed, peeled, and sliced using a Ditto Dean vegetable slicer with a C3 blade, to achieve slice thicknesses of approximately 1.80mm. After slicing, 3.0 Ibs. of the raw sweet potato slices were rinsed for under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed slices were drained and blanched using steam in a M-6 Dixie Vegetable Blancher/Cooler (Dixie Canning Company, Athens Georgia, 30603) for 50 seconds. The blanched sweet potato slices were rinsed under cold water spray for 3 minutes, drained then stored in plastic bags in a cooler overnight. The blanched sweet potato slices were layered to a bed depth of 2 inches in an lab model vibrating fluid bed processor (Carrier Vibrating Equipment, Inc., Louisville, KY 40213) with a drilled hole type plate, and dried/cooked at 176°C/350°F for 4 minutes.   Temperature of the processor was then reduced to 160°C/320°F and product was cooked for an additional 2 minutes before the processor temperature was reduced to 148°C/300°F for additional two minutes of final drying/cooking time. The sequential temperature reductions allowed for a controlled drying process, maintaining product temperature below 148°C/300°F at the final stages of drying when no evaporative cooling was taking place to prevent product browning and controlling caramelization of natural sugars present in the product. This controlled process yielded approximately 0.75 of fat-free sweet potato chips, which were cooled and packaged. The sweet potato chips were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a very pleasant sweet flavor, bright orange color, and light crisp texture.<br>
The above process was repeated a number of times with sweet potatoes that were additionally treated with calcium chloride, amylase enzyme and the combination of the two yielding desired products with great color, texture and taste.<br>
, squash, and a varieties of carrots including yellow, orange, white and purple carrots were processed in similar procedures as above all resulting in excellent products having great taste, color and texture.<br>
Example 31: Steam Blanch, then vibrating fluidized bed dryer for entire drying step on Fat Free Potato Sticks: Common Russet potatoes were washed, peeled, and sliced using a Ditto Dean vegetable slicer with an AS-4 blade, to achieve juilienne slice or stick shape with 2.0mm square, and average length of 8 cm. After slicing, 2.80 Ibs. of the raw potato sticks were rinsed for under 65°F running water for 15 seconds. Then the rinsed potato sticks were drained, held in a solution containing 3000 grams water (43°C/110°F), 30 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 30 grams calcium chloride solution (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated potato sticks were drained, and blanched using steam in a M-6 Dixie Vegetable Blancher/Cooler (Dixie Canning Company, Athens Georgia, 30603) for 55 seconds. The blanched potato sticks were rinsed under cold water spray for 3 minutes, drained, then potato sticks were marinated in a in a solution containing 1000 g. water, 75 grams of tomato juice, 10 grams lemon juice, 10 grams carrot juice plus 10 grams of salt in a cooler overnight. The following day, the marinated potato sticks were drained and layered to a bed depth of 2 inches in an lab model vibrating fluid bed processor (Carrier Vibrating Equipment, Inc., Louisville, KY 40213) with a drilled hole type plate, and dried/cooked at 160°C/320°F for 6 minutes. Temperature of the processor was then reduced to 148°C/300°F and product was cooked for an additional 2 minutes before the processor temperature was reduced to 140°C/285°F for additional two minutes of final drying time. The sequential temperature reductions allowed for a controlled drying process, maintaining product temperature below 148°C/300°F at the final stages of drying when no evaporative cooling was taking place to prevent product browning and controlling caramelization of natural sugars present in the product. This controlled process yielded approximately 0.60 of fat-free potato sticks, which were cooled and packaged. The resulting product was very bright golden in color, with a pleasant, slightly salty buttery potato flavor and having an excellent crispy light texture.<br>
Chios using vibrating fluidized bed drver tor rmai<br>
cooking: Commercial 6 inch diameter white corn tortillas were purchased at the local grocery store, each tortilla was cut into eight wedges or triangles. Approximately 500 grams of these tortilla pieces were held in a solution containing 3000 grams water (43°C/110°F), 30 grams bacterial amylase (Lot No. ALI05175-04, American Laboratories, Inc.), 30 grams calcium chloride solution (32% solution Calcium Chloride from DSM Food Specialties) for 3 minutes. The enzyme treated tortilla pieces were drained, then layered to a bed depth of 1 1/2 inches and placed into a lab model vibrating fluid bed processor (Carrier Vibrating Equipment, Inc., Louisville, KY 40213) with a drilled hole type plate, and dried/cooked at 160°C/320°F for 7 minutes. The process yielded approximately 200 grams of tortilla chips, which were cooled and packaged. The tortilla chips were evaluated by trained sensory professionals and were noted to have a pleasant cooked tortilla flavor, a very light golden color, smooth appearance, and light crisp texture. When compared with a sample processed in a similar manner but without the enzyme treatment, the sample processed using the procedure of the present invention was noted to be much lighter in texture and exhibited a lighter crunch and crispiness. The sample processed without enzyme treatment but rather held in just water for 3 minutes was tough and less crispy than the one which was produced using the process of the present invention.<br>
Example 33: Crispness Tests. Vegetable snack chips are favored for their crispy, crunchy bite which is particularly characteristic of traditional fried chips. Crispness and crunchiness can be quantified with an instrument that records the force required to break chips as well as their stiffness prior to failure. The ratio of increased resistance to increased flexure or deformation is Young's modulus (also called the elastic modulus). Vickers and Christensen (Vickers, Z.M. and Christensen, C.M. 1980. Relationship between sensory crispness and other sensory and instrumental parameters. Journal of Texture Studies 1 1 : 291-307.) found that, of instrumental measurements, Young's modulus had the highest correlation to crispness in foods. These authors showed that it is also helpful to record the sound made when the chip breaks since they found crispness was very closely related to loudness during fracture. The importance of snack food sound is underscored by Vickers' (Vickers, Z.M. 1983. Pleasantness of Food Sounds. Journal of Food Science 48: 783-786.)<br>
of food sounds was highly correlated with descriptors :risp' and 'crunchy.1<br>
Vccordingly, to be perceived as crisp and crunchy, snack food products need to have in adequate stiffness, (as reflected in Young's modulus) and to emit at least a certain level of sound upon breaking. At the same time, snack food products should lot require so great a force as to cause mouth pain or injury. To evaluate crispness, samples were fractured on a TA.XT Plus Texture Analyzer (Stable Microsystems, Sodalming, U.K.) fitted with a TA-101 Chip Rig and a 5 kg load cell. The TA-101 rig nas 2 cm diameter by 2 cm tall pipe which supports the chip in a horizontal position. ^ 5 mm ball descended at 1 mm/sec until 5 g resistance was sensed, then it continued 30 mm and the force of resistance was recorded as the chip bent and fractured. A Stable Microsystems Audio Envelope Detector was used to record the sound produced during fracture.<br>
To demonstrate the crispness/crunch of various snack products, representative samples were analyzed to measure the force required and acoustic levels resulting from fracturing chips. The analysis methods consisted of testing samples of chips listed in Table 3 below, labeled A through M, with samples A, B, C, D, L and M being produced in accordance to the present invention as described in examples 28, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 5 respectively, with retail samples E, F, G, H, I J, and K purchased at a local grocery store in Lincoln, Nebraska.   Representative chips were selected from each sample, handled, and analyzed in a consistent manner to obtain the data presented in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6.<br>
From each sample of about 25 chips, 9 chips were selected for the test. The more uniform chips were selected for measurement, because chips were variable in thickness and blistering. The nine selected chips were fractured and measurements were made of the force required to fracture each chip as the probe broke each chip while moving toward the chip at a uniform speed of 1 mm/second. Exponent software was used to generate a plot of force (Newtons) against distance (mm), and to determine (1) the initial slope, which is Young's Modulus, as discussed above, (2) the peak force required to fracture the chip and (3) peak loudness upon fracture of the chip. Excel Spreadsheet software was used to calculate means, standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Prior to this objective testing, samples A, B, C,<br>
found to be favorably crisp and cruncny ana samples E through K were determined to be within the indicated shelf life on the original package.<br>
Graphs plotting force (N) against distance (mm) traveled by the probe were generated for each force measurement. Each of these plots depict a series of increases in resistance to applied force as the chip bends under pressure from the probe just prior to fracture. The probe is moving toward the chip at a constant velocity of 1mm per second (1 mm/sec). In each case, the increase in resistance to applied force is followed by a sudden drop in resistance to such force as the chip breaks. In most cases, the chips fracture and break in a series of fractures. The first fracture, however, is the focus for determining the peak force required to fracture the chip. The peaks created in this way, characterize the chip's texture, i.e., how much does the chip resist bending before breaking, how far will it bend before breaking and at what distance and force does it break. These quantities 'fingerprint' fracture properties and their crispness and crunchiness. The sudden loss in resistance (after the force peaks) is accompanied by a recorded sound event since the chip is set vibrating by the sudden loss in deformation and stress. As noted above, typical graphs include 2 to 4 major force peaks and a corresponding number of sound peaks. The slope prior to each peak estimates the aforementioned Young's modulus, which is a good estimate of crunchiness. Since the samples tested were all crisp, any of the chips with an average Young's modulus greater than 3.5 N/mm are clearly crisp. In accordance with the present invention, it is preferable to product a snack food product with a Young's modulus of about 3.5, more preferably about 4.0, even more preferably 4.5, and even more preferably about 5.0 N/mm. It is also preferable to have a snack food product that will fracture at about 12, preferable about 10 and more preferably about 9 N of force applied to the chip so that the snack food product is crunchy but does not require so much force so that is hurts to eat the product.<br>
