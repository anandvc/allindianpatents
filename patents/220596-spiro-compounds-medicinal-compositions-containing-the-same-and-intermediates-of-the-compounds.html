DESCRIPTION<br>
SPIRO COMPOUNDS, MEDICINAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE<br>
SAME AND INTERMEDIATES OF THE COMPOUNDS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel spiro compounds that act as selective estrogen receptor modulators.  More particularly, this invention relates to a spiro[indene-1,1'-indan] derivatives and compounds related thereto, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and intermediates for the compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Female ovarian function rapidly decreases in several years before and after menopause, and postmenopausal blood estrogen level becomes not more than 1/10 of that before menopause.  Therefore, postmenopausal females tend.to express, besides what is called a climacteric syndrome, conditions due to the shortage of estrogen, such as lipidosis, arteriosclerotic disease, osteoporosis, dysmnesia, cognitive impairment and the like.  To ameliorate such various conditions of postmenopausal females, hormone replacement therapy using estrogen and progestin in combination (hereinafter to be referred to as HRT) or estrogen replacement therapy (hereinafter to be referred to as ERT) has been applied.<br>
Hot flash, which is the main complaint of the climacteric syndrome, is remarkably ameliorated by HRT and ERT.  It has been established that severity and frequency of osteoporosis can be reduced by these replacement therapies.  Moreover, it has been reported that these replacement therapies show desirable effects on lipid metabolism, cardiovascular system and psychoneurotic system.  However, HRT and ERT are associated with problems in that the incidence of breast cancer and endometrioma increases, side effects such as mammalgia, genital bleeding and the like are expressed at high frequency and the like.<br>
To reduce such side effects, therefore, the development of a pharmaceutical agent having only the desirable objective activities from various estrogenic actions expressed by HRT and ERT is proceeding.  At present, raloxifene hydrochloride ([6-hydroxy-2-(4-<br><br>
hydroxyphenyl)benzo[b]thien-3-yl] [4- [2- (1-v piperidinyl)ethoxyjphenyl]-methanone hydrochloride) has been clinically used as a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis and tamoxifen citrate ((Z)-2-[4-(l,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethanamine citrate) has been clinically used as an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of breast cancer.  These pharmaceutical agents are called selective estrogen receptor modulators (hereinafter to be referred to as SERM), because they show an estrogenic activity and an antiestrogenic activity at various ratios and levels for respective target organs.  While raloxifene hydrochloride acts as an estrogen agonist for the bone and lipid metabolisms, it acts as an estrogen antagonist for the genital organs such as uterus, breast and the like.  On the other hand, tamoxifen citrate also acts as an estrogen agonist for the bone and lipid metabolisms, like raloxifene hydrochloride, and acts as an estrogen antagonist for breast.  However, it acts as a partial agonist for uterus, unlike raloxifene hydrochloride. Such difference in the activity characteristics depends on the chemical structure of each pharmaceutical agent, which is considered to be based on the difference in the steric structure of the compound-receptor complex.  This means that a novel SERM having different activity characteristics can be created.<br>
An ideal SERM acts as an estrogen agonist for the tissues expecting an estrogenic activity and simultaneously acts as an estrogen antagonist for the tissues for which an estrogenic activity is not preferable.  Use of such SERM makes it possible to alleviate deficiency symptom of estrogen, while preventing the development of breast cancer and endometrioma, or treating them.  However, SERMs clinically used at present are not pharmaceutical agents fully satisfied as such an ideal SERM.  To be precise, it is known that raloxifene hydrochloride and tamoxifen citrate reduce the incidence of breast cancer and show a prophylactic or therapeutic effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis as well as a lipid metabolism-improving action, but show no ameliorating action on hot flash,<br><br>
which is the main complaint of the climacteric syndrome, and rather, aggravate hot flash [Doren M, J. Endocrinol. Invest., 22., 625 (1999)].<br>
