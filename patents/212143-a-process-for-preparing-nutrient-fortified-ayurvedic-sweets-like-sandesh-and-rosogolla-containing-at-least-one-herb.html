				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Conventional sweetmeats used mainly casein and sugar as their principal ingredients, occasionally adding colouring and flavouring agents. Some of the synthetic colouring agents have been found to be deleterious to human health, and people are increasingly growing apathetic to the intake of sweet items for fear of weight gain, rise in blood sugar and cholesterol level, and so on. The present invention provides a process for preparing heald-food items in the form of common sandesh and rasogolla by incorporating natural anti-oxidants and nutrients which have been found to overcome many of the previous shortcomings. On the contrary, they are cardiac-friendly and raises HDL-level in people. The process resides in selecting, processing and preparing extracts, pastes or granules from plants, herbs, plant products or parts thereof to obtain the active ingredients, fortifying them with microhutrients and/or bioactive materials, preparing a premix of casein, chhana, soya-protein or whey-protein with the fortified active ingredients, partially drying in pre-mix, forming desired sweets from the fortified pre-mix by standard procedures.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing NUTRIENT FORTIFIED AYURVEDIC SWEETS LIKE SANDESH AND ROSOGOLLA CONTAINING AT LEAST ONE HERB. This invention particularly aims at a novel means of producing edible items containing plant extracts, concentrates, pulp, oleoresins, oils, natural colorants, anti-oxidants, by-products, pastes, dried powder and whole matter from plant leaves, bark, roots, fruits, vegetables including herbs, spices, dates, spirulina, nuts, Gorgon nuts (Euryale Ferox), walnuts, almonds, cashew nuts, ground nut with heat and acid enzyme or salt-coagulated milk products like "chhana", "paneer", "cheese", whey protein concentrates and "chhana" analogues derived from Soymilk and baked "chhana" products, including partially or wholly dehydrated milk products.<br>
Heretofore sweetmeats of various types, texture, composition and taste were made either from milk products like "chhana", casein, whey protein, etc. or from lentils in granular or pulverised or extruded form like "besan", "sattu", etc. Almost invariably sugar syrup, juice, powder or crystals were used for preparing such sweetmeats which to some extent acted as the preservative. "Khir" (obtained by slow dehydration of milk) or "Khoa" were used in making sweets like "Peda", which often used "pistachio" or jaffran for imparting colour, taste and aroma to the finished products and such products are popular in whole of northern and western India. In West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and other eastern India States, sandesh and rosogolla are two of the. most popular sweets, which are prepared from "chhana". Vegetative materials like leaves of lemon tree, lemongrass extract and walnut or nutmeg paste have occasionally been used to impart aroma, taste and mouth-feeling.<br>
The protective action of fruits and vegetables has been attributed to the presence of anti-oxidants, especially anti-oxidant vitamins like ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol and ß carotene [Willett 1944; Prior &amp; Co. 2000]. Numerous studies have conclusively shown that the majority of the anti-oxidant activity may be due to presence of compounds selected from the group of flavonoids, isoflavone, flovones, anthocyanin, catechin and isocatechin, rather than from vitamin C, E and p-carotene. Besides, peptide proteins have shown formation of stable linkages of co-ordinate bonding with p-carotene and polyphenol group of anti-oxidants.<br>
Thus for no attempt has been made to prepare sweetmeats and other milk products incorporating herbs and products from vegetative origin to impart specific beneficial physiological actions.<br>
The main benefit accrued from such incorporation of herbs or articles and extracts from vegetative sources in enrichment of products with anti-oxidants, minerals, trace elements, vitamins and various other bio-active nutrient fortified health foods and herbal sweets.<br>

Difficulties confronted in the course of preparation of the products incorporating herbs and / or extracts from vegetative source mainly centered round mode and extent of incorporation and stabilization of the added herbal or vegetative derivatives. Normally the base material is selected from the group of acid, salt and heat-coagulated chhana, casein, soya milk and whey-protein. Attempts are also being made to incorporate herbs and/or vegetative products into "Srikhand", a particular variety of sweetmeat prepared by careful gradual dehydration of yoghurt under controlled conditions.<br>
The principal object of this invention, is to provide a process for the preparation of functionally active, nutrient fortified ayurvedic herbal sweets.<br>
A further object of this invention is to evolve a process for preparation of nutritive and bio-active health foods and herbal sweets which impart curative and specific disease - resistant properties in consumers of such food items.<br>
A still further object of this.invention is to provide a process for- preparing milk, soya, whey or lentil-based food items by including therein herbs, materials from vegetative sources, derivatives or extracts thereof to impart specific, desirable beneficial properties to the end products.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for modifying the conventional mode of preparing sweetmeats to amve at functionally active, nutrientfortified ayurvedic herbal sweets.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a range of functionally active, nutrient fortified ayurvedic herbal sweet pre-mix, which can be processed or converted into specific, desired edible products.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention, which provides a process for making nutrient fortified ayurvedic herbal sweets which comprises in combination the following steps:<br>
(a) cleaning selected plants, herbs, plant products or parts thereof with water at ambient temperature or thereabout, followed by drying to a moisture level varying between 0.8% and 3.4% to maintain the stable vegetable structure;<br>
(b) processing the dried materials from step (a) by cutting, grinding and size separation;<br>
(c) preparing active ingredients from herbs and/or vegetables such as herein described as obtained from step (b) in the form of extract, paste or granule;<br>
(d) fortifying the said active ingredients with micronutrients and/or bioactive materials such as herein described in amounts varying between 50 and 200 µg in the form of concentrated liquid or dehydrated powder mixed with food components like carbohydrate, protein, fat, or mixtures thereof containing vitamins B1, B2, B` B6, minerals likeZn, Fe, Se, Cu, Cr and amino acids;<br>
(e) preparing a pre-mix by admixing the composition obtained from step (d) with acid or salt and heat-coagulated casein, cheese analogue produced from acid and heat coagulated milk protein, whey protein or soya protein in amounts varying between 50:20 and 80:10 by weight of protein: composition to produce milk protein containing clusters of protein mycelium associated with water molecules, thereafter subjecting the mixture to extrusion in an extruder operating at 200-850 rpm, 5000-15000 psi and at temperature between 10°C and 75°C;<br>
(f) partially drying the pre-mix obtained from step (e) in a hammer mill wherein the peripheral speed of the hammer tips varies from 10,000 ft./min to 22,000 ft/min to reduce the particle size of around 200 mesh size;<br>
(g) optionally adding one or more materials selected from the group of preservatives, anti-oxidants, colorants, flavouring materials, starch, surfactants and binding agents such as hereinbefore described, depending on the nature of the final product desired, and<br>
(h) forming the desired sweets from the fortified pre-mix from step (g) by procedures<br>
such as herein described.<br>
For instance, food grade gum like gum guar or gum acacia may be mixed with the pre-mix for preparing herbal sandesh, and other milk-based reconstituted products like rosogolla, rosomalai, pudding, caramel, etn. may be prepared from the pre-mix bv following conventional techniaues.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail, elaborating on the different<br>
steps followed.<br>
Processing : (i) All plant leaves, fruits, vegetables, roots, herbs, spices, tea, dates, spirulina, nuts<br>
such as cashew or gorgon-nuts, etc.are collected in fresh condition, cleaned with cold<br>
water, and dried to a moisture level of 0.8 - 3.4% to keep the vegetable structure intact, (ii) The vegetative or herbal resources are then separated on the basis of the active<br>
bio-molecule present therein, as their intrinsic properties can activate many types of<br>
prokinetic reactions in the course of biochemical synthesis: (iii) Accordingly, the herbal or vegetative products as outlined in (i) above, are<br>
subjected to a series of processing like cutting, grinding, size separation and collecting<br>
the products in three different groups to be used with milk products, soya milk, whey<br>
proteins or yoghurt preparation "Srikhand " at a later stage :<br>
Group A : Products from step (iii) of desired size is subjected to process of extraction in hot or cold water or in rectified spirit (˜ 92-95% C2H5OH), and other food grade organic solvents. Concentrates are prepared by rotary vacuum evaporation after clarifying the filtrate by ultrafiltration. Freeze-dried concentrates of the extract can be prepared for retaining its nutritional and other sensory qualities over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Group B : Aforesaid vegetative products can produce mixed dry powder or paste after blanching the rate materials like leaves, shoots, bark, roots, etc. in hot water at around 50°C to 80°C for 1-2 mins., dewatering, drying, followed by grinding to obtain the desired form.<br>
Group C : Vegetative products in their raw or purified form can be made to produce a dry pre-mix in a suitable mixing unit, preferably operating at a high speed, after selecting desired particle size through size separation, the preferred range being between 0.05 and 1.0 micron, (iy) . Each of the products of Groups A, B and C was subjected to testing and the<br>
proximate analysis data are given below in a tabulator form,.based on,lOOgm. Sample.<br>
(v) Heat and acid (or salt) coagulated chhana is prepared from standardized and<br>
pasteurized milk containing 3.5% fat at 95°C using one or more of the three reagents, namely, calcium lactate, citric lactate, citric acid and lactic acid, including spent chhana water their respective concentration ranging between 0.5% and 8% by wt.<br>
In a similar manner, standardization, homogenized and pasteurized soymilk may be used to prepare heat and acid coagulated soy chhana as an analogous product.<br>
Whey protein concentration are collected and dried in a r.otary vacuum evaporator as active protein ingredients.<br>
(vi) Types of product: Three different types of products may be developed by using chhana, chhana analogue and whey protein concentrate alongwith aqueous or alcoholic or organic solvents extracts, paste and dry power of herbs, vegetables, for instance -<br>
Type I -: .<br>
Aqueous solution of the extract is mixed with chhana, chhana analogue or whey protein concentrate in a high speed blender operating at around 800 rpm. over a period of 30 mins-60 mins till the product become soft, homogenous and viscous. The amount of aqueous extract added is around 10-30% by weight with respect to chhana containing less than 10% moisture. The viscoelastic characteristics are adjusted by adding modified starch, arraroot, polysaccharide or potato starch and other stabilizing agent like gum arabic or acacia, and keeping the entire mass in a steam heated blender maintained at a temperature of around 10°-60°C with constant agitation at 300-500 rpm.<br>
As and when the mass becomes solidified with acceptable textural properties (like, for instance, hardness, cohesiveness, stringiness, gumminess and chewiness), the product is collected for making the pro-mix, which in turn can be converted into "rosogolla", "rosomalai", and the like products.<br>
Alternately, micromixing may be achieved by subjecting chhana or chhana analogue along with the aqueous or alcoholic or organic solvents extracts in a high speed, ultra pressure extruder. Type II:<br>
Vegetative products in the paste form are blended with dry chhana or chhana analogue and whey protein in a low speed paddle type mixer operating at 25 to 70 rpm whereby the paste particles get distributed throughout the mass of the mix. When the mass becomes sticky and slightly hardy, it is transferred into a high, speed dispenser type blender having operating speed in the range of 1200-5000 r.p.m. The operation is continued for around 30-60 mins till the mass becomes soft in texture. Thereafter medified starch, stabilising agent, gum arabic or gum acasia is mixed and blended at 300-500 rpm to obtain a pre-mix for making rosogolla and sandesh.<br>
The mass of "pre-mix" may be subjected to further micro-mixing, if so desired, in a high speed ultra-pressure extrusion unit having pre-mixing facilities. Type III:<br>
Dry powder of vegetative products having 0.5 -1 micron particle size with less than 2% moisture is mixed in 10-3.0% proportion (by wt.) with chhana or chhana analogue with whey protein having less than 10% moisture. Initially the mass is mixed in a slow speed paddle type mixer over a period of around 30 mins-60 mins, and the soft mass is again mixed in a high speed (1200-1500 rpm) impact type blender, so that the ultimate mass of the material gains the desired texture for making pre-mix of the final products.<br>
(vii) Products from pre-mix materials<br>
Pre-mixes prepared as in Type I, II and III may be further mixed with natural dried herbs, vegetables, fruit powder, date, carrot, tomato powder, beet powder, dried wood apple, spirulina, peanut, gorgonnut, cocoa, banana flours, milo, defatted soya flour, whey protein, amino-acids, anti-oxidant supplements including bio-active molecules from plants and vegetable extracts, binding materials, surface activeagets including<br>
micronutrients. Selected from the group of Zinc, Selenium, Iron, Copper and Manganese in a high speed, 500-700 rpm ultrahigh pressure (5000-15000 psi) extruder (specially twin screw extruder of minimum dia. 45) to achieve a higher degree of micro-mixing so that a number of desirable functional properties of the end product can be assured.<br>
(viii) The products obtained in (vii) are dried upto less than 2% moisture level and pulverized to a particle size of 0.01 -0.5 |i in a high speed hammer mill with high impact load. The resulting product may be collected and packed in vacuum or in nitrogen atmosphere for prolonged preservation.<br>
The development product is a "pre-mix" for making various types of sweetmeats like sandesh, rosogolla, rosomalai etc.<br>
(ix) "Pre-mix" obtained in (viii) may be further blended with chhana or chhana analogue, sweetening agent and other ingredients in a high speed blender to make chhana ball for making herbal rosogolla by cooking it in sugar syrup of around 70° Br. At 80°-90°C for 20-30 mins. Requisite permisible binding agent may also be uses, if and when needed.<br>
(x) In a similar manner the same "pre-mix" may be used to prepare herbal sandesh or sandesh-like products using additional ingredients, if necessary.<br>
(xi) The "pre-mix" can be used to prepare herbal baked chhana-based products in an oven (preferably a "microoven" having thermostatic control) at round 120°-160°C for 20-30 min, using other ingredients, if and when necessary.<br>
(xii) Other herbal sweets can also be prepared by using the aforesaid fortified pre-mix of various formulations including desired additives, a few instances of which are given hereafter by way of illustration and not way of limitation.<br>

The product obtained as shown in Example 1 to 4 were subjected to three different, yet significant experiments namely -<br>
1. Anti-oxidant capacity of the products ;<br>
2. Stability of the anti-oxidant vis-a-vis loss of anti-oxidants during processing and product development, and .<br>
3. Mouth feeling and Sensory test of.the product. Experiment No. 1 :<br>
The antioxidant activities against hydroxyl radicals of the plant leaves, herbs and other natural ingredients and biological samples were studied for the products like Herbal Rosogolla, Carrot Rosogolla, Herbal Sandesh and other specific Herbal Sandesh. The results demonstrated clearly that all natural ingredients tested in this study had antioxidant activities against not only peroxyl radicals but also hydroxyl radicals. It is an important finding that these natural<br>
ingredients acted as antioxidants when a transition metal (viz. Cu+2) oxidant was used in the product formulations, and the antioxidant activity also increased as their concentrations increased. It has been observed that the transition metal initiated pro-oxidant actions of Vitamin A, Ascorbic acid, Vitamin E and p -Carotene. In terms of antioxidant quality in vitro, the natural antioxidant mixture contained in plant leaves, herbs, vegetables and fruit extracts appears to be better than a single antioxidant or a simple antioxidant mixture of Ascorbic Acid, a-Tocopherol and P-Carotene.<br>
Experiment No 2 :<br>
Experiments were carried out at different temperatures varying between 30°C and 90°C to find the stability of antioxidant during processing of the products. A wide variation was observed for P-Carotene, Lutein, a-Tocopherol, Ascorbic acid and total antioxidant of polyphenols and flavanoids. Processing at elevated temperatre in the presence of oxygen is reported to cause considerable loss in antioxidant activity and it was found to be in the range of 4.8-62% for P-Carotene, lutein upto 46%, ascorbic acid upto 89%, a-tocopherol upto 32%, and polyphenols and flavonoids upto 86%. However, stabilizing agent like citric acid and extracts of fruit concentrates, ascorbyl palmiate, ascorbic palmiate, DL -tocopherol acetate, some varieties of co-fatty acids, soya leitin and TBHQ can decrease the activity to the extent of around 20-55% at specified temperature, depending on the composition of the products.<br>
Experiment No. 3 :<br>
The quality of Herbal Sweets was evaluated with the help of a sensory panel, and the product-acceptability was observed to be quite satisfactory with a considerable extent of pleasant mouth feeling.<br>
Experomentment No. 4 and 5 :<br>
Detailed manufacturing procedure of fruits, vegetables and herbs-fortified Rosogolla and Sandesh are illustrated hereinbelow :<br>
A Preparation of base sample :<br>
Heat, acid or salt coagulated chhana is prepared from standardised and pasteurised milk containing 3.5% fat, or from cow/buffalo milk at around 95°C using a coagulant selected from the group of citric acid, lactic acid, calcium lactate and citric lactate at a concentration of from 0.5-8.0% by wt., or sour whey, drained from any pressure batch of prepared chhana.<br>
In a similar manner, standardised, homogenized and pasteurised soymilk may be used to prepare heat and acid coagulated soy chhana as an analogous product.<br>
Whey protein concentrates are collected and dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator to be used as an active protein ingredient.<br>
B Preparation of fortified sample (Herbs / Fruits / Vegetables):<br>
i) collection of plants, herbs, plant products or parts thereof in fresh<br>
condition.<br>
ii) cleaning with warm/cold water at ambient temperature. iii) Blanching of plant materials in hot water at around 50°-80°C for 1 -2 mins.<br>
This step, however, is not necessary for all plant materials. iv) Plant materials/herbs can be fortified in different forms such as dried<br>
powder, paste, concentrate or as premix form, obtained as outlined below.<br>
a) Dried powder form :-<br>
Fresh, cleaned, blanched/unblanched plant materials are subjected to a drying step to obtain a moisture level varying between 0.8%-3.4%. Next the dried materials are processed by cutting &amp; grinding.<br>
b) Paste form :-<br>
Fresh, cleaned, blanched/unblanched plant materials are blended in a blender for 5-10 mins. to get uniform mass/paste.<br>
c) Concentrate :-<br>
• Active bio-molecules are extracted from the plant parts either by hot or cold water or by any other suitable food grade organic solvents like ethanol. Concentrates are prepared by rotary vacuum evaporation after clarifying the filtrate of extracted solution by ultrafiltration. Freeze dried<br>
concentrates of the extract can also be prepared for retaining its nutritional and other sensory qualities over a prolonged period of time, d) Premix preparation :-<br>
Premixes are prepared by admixing the dried plant parts/concentrates/pastes with chhana/chhana analogues in predetermined amounts, followed by subjecting the mixture to extrusion in an extruder operating at 200-850 rpm, 5000-15000 psi and at temperatures ranging between 10°C and 75°C. Partially drying the pre-mix in a high speed hammer mill to reduce the particle size to a range between 0.01 and 0.5m<br>
Among the 4 types of fortified samples, dried plant materials and paste forms are easy to prepare and economic. But for better nutritional benefits, concentrates and pre-mixes are useful. Concentrates are normally used in the preparation of natural colour which is used to substitute the artificial colours used in sweetmeat industry. For better nutrient fortification use of pre-mix happens to be most preferable.<br>
Carrot Rosogilla :-<br>
Ingredients :- i) Carrot (with skin) used in paste form<br>
ii) Chhana<br>
iii) Stabilizer and binding agent (maida, arrowroot)<br>
iv) Cooking sugar syrup (Brix - 55-60°)<br>
v) Soaking sugar syrup (Brix - 28-34°)<br>
(i) Carrot paste :-<br>
Selected fresh, young, tender dark orange carrot<br>
Cut carrot with skin into small pieces<br>
Blanch the carrot pieces in hot water for 2 minutes<br>
Grind the blanched carrot pieces in grinder to get uniform carrot paste.<br>
(ii) Chhana preparation :-<br>
Heat the strained cowmilk upto 95°C<br>
Cool down to a temp, at about 70°C<br>
Use citric/lactic/calcium lactate solution, or sour whey for milk curdling/coagulation<br>
Strain the coagulated milk with muslin cloth<br>
Excess whey from curdled milk by giving a pressure<br>
Chhana becomes ready for further utilization<br>
Carrot Rosogolla preparation :-<br>
Mix carrot paste with chhana<br>
Use maida and / or arrowroot in the mixture to stabilize the structure of rosogolla<br>
Make small balls<br>
Cook balls in sugar syrup of 55-60 Brix at temperature of around 95-990C for 10-15 minutes<br>
Soak the balls in sugar syrup at 30-35° Brix for 8-10 hrs. or packed in can / food grade poly pack<br>
Ready for consumption<br>
Note :- Proportion of Carrot paste addition to chhana varies from (20%-50%) depending upon the choice and demand of the customer. But use of higher percentage of carrot paste needs more stabilizer/binder.<br>
Chemical composition :-<br>
Normal Carrot Rosogolla<br>
Moisture - 52% 53%<br>
Fat - 5.44% 4.75%<br>
Protein - 5.28% 4.56%<br>
Sugar • - 43.02% 43.01%<br>
Ash - 1.62 1.63<br>
Acidity of syrup - 3.92 (ml. N/10 NaOH) 3.92<br>
soln.<br>
Herbal Sandesh :-<br>
Ingredients :- i) Herbs &amp; Veg. Such as Tulsi, Pudina, Corriander, Curry leaf, Beet<br>
root, Carrot, Ginger, Amla, Turmeric, etc. ii) Chhana<br>
iii) Stabilizer and binding agent iv) Sugar<br>
Manufacturing process :-<br>
Chhana preparation same as rosogolla.<br>
llerbs / Veg. Paste :-<br>
Select Fresh, Young tender veg. / herbs<br>
clean the herbs with normal water at ambient temp.<br>
chop into small pieces<br>
grind in a blender for 2-3 min. to get uniform paste.<br>
Siindesh preparation :-<br>
mash chhana thoroughly to break lump &amp; granular structure of casein<br>
mix the mashed chhana with proper quantity of binder<br>
liansfer V2 part of mashed chhana to a large flat shaped iron pan heated to around 40°-90°C<br>
Add required quantity of sugar in heated iron pan<br><br>
stir continuously with a flat, wooden surface stick in a process of continuous surface exposure till the desired degree of viscosity and gumminess of the mass are arrived at.<br>
add rest part of mashed chhana in heated pan when previous mass becomes slightly sticky<br>
add herb paste in varying amount (3-12%) depending upon the herbs/veg. type.<br>
stir the total mixture properly<br>
bring down the temp, of the total mass dough to ambient condition<br>
divide dough into different small masses<br>
give desired shape &amp; size to small masses of sandesh using different moulds.<br>
pack in can or vacuum packages for longer shelf life<br>
Stabilizer :-<br>
Normally CMC can be used for better colour retention.<br>
Note:- Herbs / spices can be added in tray dried or freeze dried form or in solvent extracted form. But all other methods are expensive, cause reduction of flavouring compound as well as colour.<br>
Heller ß-carotene retention :-<br>
ß-Carotene is highly susceptible to light as well as heat. So osmosis process can be involved for better p-Carotene retention of the product.<br>
O|smosis :-<br>
Honey can be used as sweatening agent which has high antioxidant properly.<br>
Chhana —&gt; kneaded properly —» Mixed with blanched carrot date paste (20-25%) —&gt; then add honey (1 kg chhana = 25-30g honey) —&gt; then place the sample in cone, sugar soln. (60-70" Brix) or honey —&gt; keep the sample at 4°C temp. —&gt; after 24 hrs. it is ready for comsumption —&gt; sample container should be covered with aluminium foil to avoid light penetration.<br>
Better retention of [3 - Carotene :-<br>
1. For better carotene retention carrot juice can be extracted. Then this juice will be mixed with soaking syrup of rosogolla or the sugar syrup containing juice will be boiled with prepared rosogolla ball at low temp. (40°C) under low pressure.<br>
2. Spray dried carrot juice / powder will be mixed with soaking syrup. It enhances better carotene retention of the sample.<br>
3. Biological metal ion such as zinc, copper etc. has a good role in ß carotene stabilization. Salt of zinc, manganese, copper etc. can be mixed with milk. Then the milk will curdled. Carrot paste will be mixed with this curdled chhana. Copper, zinc etc. present in curdled chhana will help in better binding of ß carotene with chhana. Calcium lactate chhana contain more calcium and help in providing more nutrients.<br>
4. Use of paste form of ß carotene - source in sandesh also helps in better P-Carotene retention.<br>
The products prepared in accordance with the present invention offer many desirable characteristics and the evolved process also has a number of distinct advantages, which are, inter<br>
alia, as shown below :-<br>
(a) Modification of starch (from all sources even dehydrated flours of root carbohydrates) through gelatinisation over a wide range of solubility and textural characteristics.<br>
"(b) Denaturisation of proteins (even large unfolded molecules) through linearization over a substantial directional alignment or shifting to chain structure (resulting in higher biological value or protein efficiency ratio).<br>
(c) Uniform and irreversible stable binding of gelatinized starch with added proteins or amino acids, micronutrtents (e.g. vitamins, minerals and natural sources of antioxidants), flavours and colors.<br>
(d) Development of synergistic effect by increasing active binding sites in protein for bettedinkages of herbal bio-active molecules with Zinc, Iron, Copper Solenium and / or manganese due to involvement of electron transport mechanism or torsion force field applied to peptide bonds, resulting in Cis-Trans transformation of protein (e.g. chhana, chhana analogue of soy protein and whey protein) towards more stable under mechanical shear, pressure and low temperature ranging between 40°C-80°C.<br>
(e) Denaturation of spherical or secondary structure of protein and complex vegetable proteins by decreasing its a-helical content due to compression properties under ultra high-pressure of extension process.<br>
(f) Conversion of casein to caseinates with ingredients of herbs and vehetable proteins and bioactive molecules.<br>
(g) Deactivation of enzymes (such as, or example lipase and peroxides) activity to cause oxidative decomposition of the end product.<br>
(h) Dexturization of starch (larger starch molecules one broken into shorter chains) and deztrinization of starch by using better control on biochemical reactions of reducing sugars, amylose, amlylopectins, phytosterol, residual lipids, active alkloids and bioactive molecules, emulsifying and surface active agents under high mechanical shear and medium heat.<br>
(i) Better management of Maillard reactions by controlling the various effects of<br>
temperature and extrusion speeds on product quality.<br>
. (j) High temperature-short residence time (HTST) action destroys anti-growth factors (like trypsine inhibitors), phytic acid in soybean, active toxic alkaloids and aflatoxins effecl<br>
are minimized, bacteria are killed, pesticide residues are reduced, eliminated or<br>
transformed to non-toxic compounds, (k) Effective micro-mixing of viscous media and functional ingredients (plant leaves, herbs,<br>
spices, roots, fruit pulp-concentrate-dried powder, date, spirulina, micro-encapsulated<br>
natural colours and antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, amino-acids, organic acids extracted<br>
from natural sources, natural flavors, dietary fibre, protein hydrolysates, texturing agents,<br>
gelatin, saccharose, glucose / fructose syrup) by using high to low shear depending on<br>
nature and composition of pre-mix for achieving better mixed products. (1) Transformation of antioxidant like ß-carotene to more stable form Cis to Trans during<br>
micro-mixing with other natural ingredients and functional components into a cooked,<br>
semi-cooked and cooled products. (m) Alkaline treatment process for better control of bio-chemical reactions for some toxic<br>
alkaloids and specific feed. (n) Hydrolysis of hemicellulose of fibres present in plant leaves, herbs and other natural<br>
ingredients to assimillable form, thereby increasing calorie content of the products. (o) Better retention of nutrients like vitamin B-Complex, iron, calcium and bio-activity of<br>
natural ingredients than any other physical or mechanical process. (p) Better utilization of high moisture feed, even upto 35%, using proper pre-conditioning<br>
unit with the feeder of the extruder to make value added product at cheaper cost than any<br>
other process. (q) Wide range of particle size distribution in micro-mixing so that the products show their<br>
higher biological value, bio-availability and corresponding maximum range of enzyme<br>
digestibility factor.<br>
