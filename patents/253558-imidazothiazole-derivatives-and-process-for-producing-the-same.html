				<td>IMIDAZOTHIAZOLE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 011923/2005 (filing date: January 19, 2005), which is a previous Japanese patent application, and claims to enjoy a profit of the right of priority, and the whole disclosure of the previous Japanese application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to imidazothiazole derivatives useful as an intermediate for the production of carbapenem derivatives having potent antimicrobial activity and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, and a process for producing the same. [0003] Background Art<br>
Carbapenem derivatives have potent antimicrobial activity and a broad antimicrobial spectrum and thus have been energetically studied as a highly useful ß-lactam agent.<br>
WO 02/42312 reports finding that carbapenem derivatives having a 7-(l-carbamoylmethylpyridinium-3-yl)carbonylimidazo[5,l-b]thiazole group at the 2-positipn on the carbapenem ring, that is, compounds of formula (A), have high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria including MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), PRSP (penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), Haemophilus influenzae, and p-lactamase producing bacteria, and, at the same time, have high stability against DHP-l(kidney dehydropeptidase-1). Japanese Patent No. 3527003 reports that imidazothiazoles which have been unsubstituted or<br>
substituted at the 3-position of the cephem ring, are useful for the development of potent antimicrobial activity. This Japanese Patent No. 3527003 describes substituents in substituted imidazothiazoles which embrace compounds according to the present invention. In the technique disclosed in this patent, however, there is still room for improvement, for example, in procedure process.<br>
[0004]	Further,	WO	2004/055027	reports<br>
2-bromoimidazo[5,l-b]thiazole (a compound of formula (VI')) that is an intermediate important for the substituent at the 2-position on the carbapenem ring in the compound of formula (A). Compounds of formula (A) can be produced according to scheme A from 2-bromoimidazo[5,l-b]thiazole which may be produced according to the present invention.<br>
[0005]         Scheme A<br><br><br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
[0006] Further, WO 2004/055027 discloses the following scheme B as a process for producing 2-bromoimidazo[5,l-b]thiazole (a compound of formula (VI')).<br>
[0007]         Scheme B<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [0008]	In this scheme B,  2-bromoimidazo[5,l-b]thiazole<br>
of formula (VI') as an intermediate important for carbapenem derivatives of formula (A) is produced by reacting a compound of formula (6) produced through five steps using aminoacetonitrile (a compound of formula (1)) as a starting compound with a brominating agent to give a compound of formula (7) and then reacting the compound of formula (7) with a dehydrating agent.<br>
This scheme B, however, involves a cost problem that the compound of formula (1) as the starting compound is expensive and, at the same time, has operational problems that the total number of steps in the scheme is large and, in addition, the step of converting the compound of formula (6) to the compound of formula (7) suffers from a low yield and produces a large amount of decomposition products.<br>
Accordingly, a method for synthesizing 2-bromoimidazo[5,l-b]thiazole, which can use a more inexpensive starting compound, requires a smaller number of steps, and has advantages of production cost and operational improvement, has still been desired.<br>
[0009]	On the other hand, Journal of Fluorine Chemistry,<br>
1995, 279 reports that isocyanoethyl acetate is reacted with trifluoroacetimidoyl chloride having a substituent on the nitrogen atom in the presence of a base to construct an imidazole ring. This reaction, however, is a monocyclic ring formation reaction for a substituted imidazole, and, so far as the present inventors know, whether or not a bicyclic imidazo[5,l-b]thiazole ring having a different ring construction and a 2 - halogenated imidazo[5,l-b]thiazole ring can be constructed in the same manner as described in this document has not been known.<br>
[0010]	Further, Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry,  1983,<br>
1605 reports a reaction for decarboxylation by heating an aromatic carboxylic acid in trichlorobenzene under<br>
reflux. So far as the present inventors know, however, whether or not this method can be similarly applied to carboxyl group-containing imidazo[5,l-b]thiazole ring derivatives has not been known.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]	The   present   inventors   have   now   succeeded   in<br>
preparing compounds of formula (I), which will be<br>
described later, as an intermediate for the synthesis of<br>
carbapenem derivatives of formula (A). The present<br>
inventors have succeeded in synthesizing<br>
imidazothiazole derivatives of formula (I) which will be<br>
described later at high yield by reacting a<br>
2,5-dihalogenated	thiazole,	derived	from<br>
2-aminothiazole which is inexpensively available, with an isocyanoacetic ester. Further, this production process has an operational advantage, can avoid the bromination step, and can synthesize a contemplated compound with higher safety. The present invention has been made based on such finding.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a synthetic intermediate that can realize the production of carbapenem derivatives of formula (A) in an efficient and safe manner at a low production cost. That is, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel method for constructing a bicyclic imidazo[5,l-b]thiazole ring.<br>
[0012]	According   to   the   present   invention,   there   is<br>
provided a compound of formula (I):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
X represents a halogen atom; and R1 represents group -COR2;<br>
wherein R2 represents group OM or C1-12 alkyloxy wherein M represents a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or quaternary ammonium.<br>
[0013]	There   is   provided   a   process   for   producing   a<br>
compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, said process comprising the following steps (a) and (b):<br>
(a)	reacting   a   compound   of formula   (II)   with  a<br>
compound of formula (III) in the presence of a base:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X and X1 each independently represent a halogen atom,<br>
R3OOCCH2NC	(III)<br>
wherein R3 represents Cl-12 alkyl, and<br>
(b)	optionally   further   subjecting   the   compound<br>
prepared in step (a) to a hydrolysis reaction.<br>
[0014]	According    to    another    aspect    of   the    present<br>
invention, there is provided a process for producing a compound of formula (VI),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein X represents a halogen atom, said process comprising heating a compound of formula (V),  a  compound  of formula  (IV),  or a compound  of formula (V) prepared by hydrolyzing the compound of formula (IV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X represents a halogen atom; M represents a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or quaternary ammonium, and<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X represents a halogen atom; and R3 represents C1-12 alkyl.<br>
[0015] According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided use of a compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, as a synthetic intermediate for the manufacture of antimicrobial agents.<br>
[0016] The use of the compound of formula (I) according to the present invention and the production process thereof can realize the production of compounds of formula (VI), which are an intermediate important for compounds of formula (A), using a more inexpensively available starting material in a smaller number of steps as compared with the prior art technique. Further, according to the present invention, since the conventional bromination step can be avoided, the problem of low yield of this step, the problem of decomposition products, and the operational problem can be avoided, and, at the same time, the safety can be more improved. Further, according to the present invention, the number of steps necessary from the starting compound to the important intermediate can be reduced to the half or less of the number of steps necessary for the prior art technique, and the step involving a low yield can be avoided. At the same time, the yield of the important intermediate and the whole reaction efficiency can be significantly improved (for example, by a factor of 10 or more). As a result, according to the process of the present invention, for<br>
example, a production cost reduction and production control can significantly be improved, and carbapenem derivatives (compounds of formula (A)) having excellent antimicrobial activity and a broad antimicrobial spectrum can be efficiently synthesized.<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein X, X1, and R3 were as defined above; and R4 represents a chlorine atom or optionally substituted amino.<br>
[0035] Production of compounds of formula (I)<br>
The process for producing a compound of formula<br>

(a)	reacting   a   compound   of formula   (II)   with  a<br>
compound of formula (III) in the presence of a base;<br>
and<br>
(b)	optionally   further   subjecting   the   compound<br>

[0036] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the reaction in step (a) is carried out in a polar solvent in a temperature range of -40°C to 50°C.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the production process of the compound of formula (I), when a hydrolysis reaction is carried out as step (b), a compound of formula (V) is obtained as the compound of formula (I).<br>
[0037] The production process of compounds embraced in formula (I) (that is, compounds of formula (IV) or (V)) and compounds of formula (VI) using these compounds will be described in more detail.<br>
[0038] Step I: Production of compounds of formula (IV)<br>
Compounds   of  formula   (IV)   can   be   synthesized according to scheme I. Scheme I<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein R3, X, and X1 are as defined above.<br>
According to the process shown in scheme I, in step I-1, a compound of formula (IV) is produced by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula (III) in the presence of a base. For example, in the above scheme, when R3 represents ethyl and X represents a bromine atom, formula (IV) may be<br>
represented by formula (IVa); (Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0039] (Step I-1)<br>
In use, the compounds of formulae (II) and (III) in step I-1 may be synthesized, or alternatively may be commercially available. For example, a part of the compounds of formula (II) are available from Aldrich, and a part of the compounds of formula (III) are available, for example, from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.<br>
In this step, an imidazothiazole ring is formed by reacting the compound of formula (II) with the compound of formula (III). A compound of formula (IV) can be produced by reacting the compound of formula (II) with the compound of formula (III) in the presence of a base.<br>
[0040] The solvent used in step I-1 is not particularly limited so far as the solvent does not adversely affect the reaction in this step. A person having ordinary skill in the art could properly select the solvent. Example of such solvents include hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene, halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride, ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, dimethoxyethane, cyclopentyl methyl ether, aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, nitromethane, nitroethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide, and mixed solvents thereof. Ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-dioxane and polar solvents such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide may be mentioned as preferred solvents.<br>
More	preferred	solvents	include<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide and a mixed solvent composed of N,N-dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
[0041] Usable bases include, for example, alkali metal<br>
hydrides such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride,<br>

isopropylcyclohexylamide, lithium dicyclohexylamide,<br>
lithium	bistrimethylsilylamide,	sodium<br>
bistrimethylsilylamide,	and	potassium<br>
bistrimethylsilylarnide. They may also be used in a combination of two or more. Preferred are alkali metal hydrides. Sodium hydride is more preferred.<br>
[0042] The reaction temperature range may vary depending, for example, upon the solvent used. In general, however, the reaction temperature range is from -100°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably -40 to 50°C.<br>
The reaction time varies depending, for example, upon the solvent used and the reaction temperature. In general, however, the reaction time is 10 min to 24 hr.<br>
The compound of formula (IV) thus obtained may be<br>
subjected to conventional post treatment. The<br>
conventional post treatment is treatment that is well<br>
known to a person having ordinary skill in the art, and<br>
examples thereof include quenching (stopping of the<br>
reaction) and extraction.	Further, conventional<br>
methods such as precipitation, crystallization, gell filtration, and column chromatography on silica gel may be if necessary applied for isolation and purification.<br>
[0043] Step II: Production of compounds of formulae (V) and (VI)<br>
Compounds   of   formulae   (V)   and    (VI)    may   be synthesized according to scheme II. Scheme II<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein R3, M, and X are as defined above. [0044] A compound of formula (VI) can be produced by hydrolyzing a compound of formula (IV) preferably in the presence of a base to give a compound of formula (V) and heating the compound of formula (V) preferably in a solvent, or directly heating a prepared compound of formula (V) preferably in a solvent. A compound of formula (VI) can also be produced by directly heating the compound of formula (IV) in a solvent.<br>

Here, for example, when X represents a bromine atom, formula (VI) may be represented by formula<br>
(VI'). [0045] (Step II-l (step of hydrolysis))<br>
This step is the step of conducting a hydrolysis reaction of a compound of formula (IV). A compound of formula (V) can be produced by reacting a compound of formula (IV) in the presence of a base or an acid in a solvent that does not adversely affect the reaction.<br>
The solvent used in step II-l is not particularly limited so far as the solvent does not adversely affect the reaction in this step. The solvent can be properly selected by a person having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Such solvents include, for example, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, and water. Two or more of them may be mixed together to prepare a mixed solvent that may be used as the solvent. Preferred are water, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile and the like. Water, methanol, and ethanol are more preferred.<br>
Bases include, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, and cesium carbonate. Preferred bases include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide.<br>
Acids include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, and acetic acid. Preferred acids include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and acetic acid. [0046] The reaction temperature range may vary depending, for example, upon the solvent used. In general, however, the reaction temperature range is from -100°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably 0 to 70°C.<br>
The reaction time may vary depending, for example, upon the solvent used  and the reaction temperature. In general, however, the reaction time is 10 min to 24 hr, preferably 30 min to 24 hr.<br>
The compound of formula (V) thus obtained may be subjected to conventional post treatment. Further, conventional methods such as precipitation, crystallization, gel filtration, and column chromatography on silica gel may be if necessary applied for isolation and purification. After the completion of the hydrolysis, the compound of formula (V) may also be isolated as a carboxylic acid salt. [0047] (step II-2)<br>
This step is the step of conducting a decarboxylation<br>
reaction of a compound of formula (V). The compound of formula (VI) can be produced by heating a compound of formula (V) preferably in a solvent.<br>
The solvent used in step II-2 is not particularly limited so far as the solvent does not adversely affect the reaction in this step. The solvent can be properly selected by a person having ordinary skill in the art. Examples of such solvents include dimethyl sulfoxide, l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH) pyrimidinone, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, xylene, diphenyl ether, ethylene glycol, toluene, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and water. Two or more of them may be mixed together to prepare a mixed solvent that be used in this step. The solvent is preferably a single solvent or mixed solvent having a boiling point of 100°C or above.<br>

Additives usable herein include, for example, carboxylic<br>
acids or anhydrides thereof such as benzoic acid and<br>
acetic anhydride, phenols such as phenol and catechol,<br>
mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
and hydrobromic acid, metal salts such as lithium<br>
chloride, lithium bromide, and lithium iodide, and<br>
