Description Compound Material and Method Tor Its Production<br>
The invention pertains to a compound material made of a coated hard metal or cermet base body, on which the only layer, or in case of a multi-layered coating at least one layer which is 0.??m to 25?m thick, preferably the outermost layer, contains an Al2O3 phase and another phase which consists of ZrO2 and/or HfO2.<br>
The invention further pertains to a method for producing a coating containing a First Al2O3 phase and a second phase consisting of ZrO2 and/or HfO2 on a substrate body or on a substrate body coated with one or several layers, with the help of a CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) method at deposition temperatures between 900°C and 1000°C in the gas phase, which contains the necessary gases for deposition from the group AlC3, ZrCl4 ,HfCl4, CO2. H2, CH4 and N2 or inert gases, and under pressures from 10 to 100000 Pa<br>
Already from the document DE 27 36 982 AI a wear protection coating for moulded parts is described, especially tools, consisting of a moulded body, preferably made of hard metal, and one or several surface coatings, out of which at least one protective coating is made of a ceramic matrix in which another material is embedded   The ceramic matrix and the embedded material clearly possess different thermal coefficients of expansion, so that the protective coating is covered by the finest possible micro-cracks   As embedding material to be used in a ceramic matrix made of Al2O3, unstabilised and/or partly stabilised ZrO2 is suggested   For producing such a coating according to the CVD method, aluminium trichloride, carbondioxide and hydrogen are introduced into the gas phase for formation of<br>
Al2O3, and zirconium tetrachloride and water vapour are introduced for formation of ZrO2 in a reaction container ai 1 l00°C   Due to the difference in thickness between the resistant tetragonal modification above a conversion temperature of about 1l00°C and the resistant, monocitnic modification of the zirconium oxide below approx  11OO°C, in case of a corresponding phase conversion one gets a significant change in volume of the embedded zirconium oxide   This result in, the fact, that with increasing volume of zirconium oxide, at be  time the micro, in the deposited ceramic coating gets increased<br>
The DF. 28 25 009 CO- describes a hard-metal body with a thin, wear-resistant  made of alutnmxum oxide, which entirely or at least to the extent of 85%,<br><br>
2<br>
consists of K-modification and the eventually remaining portion of a-modification forms on the surface regions or spots of a size of maximum 10 ?m. The aluminium oxide coating can additionally contain titanium, zirconium and/or hafnium.  For producing this ceramic coating with the help of the CVD method, apart from H2, AlCl3, CO2 and CO some small quantities of 0.03 to 0 5% TiCl4 is added to the gas mixture.<br>
This addition however only exclusively or almost exclusively serves the purpose of formation of the K-aluminium oxide-phase.<br>
A further CVD method for deposition of Al2O3 and/or ZrC2 by using an additional reagent like hydrogen sulphide, is described in the document EP 0 523 021 Bl.<br>
The document DE 195 18 927 Al describes a coated cutting tool consisting of a sinter carbide substrate or ceramic substrate with a wear-resistant compound ceramic coating, which has two different oxide phases, e.g. made of Al2O3 and ZrO2, and additionally a doping agent which is selected from the group sulphur, selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth or compounds of these mentioned elements. For producing this two-phased coating according to a CVD method, aluminium and zirconium chloride, carbondioxide with hydrogen as carrier and a H2S gas is conducted over the substrate body at a temperature approx. 700 to 1250°C and a pressure of 133 Pa to surrounding pressure, whereby the two-phased coating gets deposited with a doping agent.<br><br>
The document EP 0 786 536 Al describes a coated hard metal body with a 3 to 20 ?m thick aluminium oxide layer, which has been deposited by the CVD and/or PVD method and which should contain 0 005 to 0 5 percent by weight of chlorine   Facultatively, in this layer there could be 0.5 to 10 percent by weight of Zr and/or Hf as well as 1 5 to 15 percent by weight of Ti<br>
The document EP 0 162 652 A2 describes a multi-layered coating on a hard metal substrate body with an inner layer, which consists of at least one carbide, nitride, carbonitride. carbo-oxinitride, oxinitride. boric nitride or boric carbonitride of titanium, and an outer multi-layered coating with a total thickness of 5 to 20 urn, which consists of several AI2O3 layers with respective thicknesses of 001 to 2 ??, out of which each consists of an Al2O3 -film, in which titanium oxide is dissolved or at least 30 percent by volume of titanium oxide coexists The layers are separated by intermediate layers of 0.1 to 2 ?? thickness each, which respectively consist of TiC, TiN, TiCN, TiCNO, TiNO, titanium oxides, Ti (BN), Ti (BNC), SiC. AIN and A1ON<br>
It is the task of this invention to improve the wear resistance of the already mentioned compound material. Particularly for application of this compound material as cutting tool for machining of material, one should aim for improvement of service life and efficiency<br><br>
-3a-<br>
Furthermore, it is the task of this invention to present a method for producing an improved compound material<br>
This task is fulfilled by the compound material as mentioned in claim I, which as per the invention has the special feature, that the coating containing the Al2O3 and a second phase of ZrO2 and/or HfO2, additionally has a third fine dispersive phase which consists of an oxide, oxicarbide, oxinitride or oxicarbonitride of titanium, with the exception of such a coating which has chlorine content of 0 005 to 0 5 percent by weight.   The third phase could particularly be made of TiO2, TiO, Ti2O, Ti2O3, Ti (0, C), Ti(O, N) or Ti(O, C, N) or mixture phases of these which are referred to below generally as TiOx-phases   The embedding of TiOx-compounds into the two-phased ceramic coating brings about a dispersion-strengthening effect which significantly improves the wear resistance of the coating.<br><br>
According to a special design form of the invention, the share of this third phase (TiOx) in the total quantity of the ceramic coating should be 0.2 or even preferably 0 6 to 5 mol%. preferably at least 1 mol%    The molecular ratio of the Al2O3 phase to the ZrO2 phase, HfO2 phase or ZrO2/HfO2-phase, which could also be formed as an oxide mixture (Zr. Hf) O2, is adapted according to the requirement, i e purpose of application of the compound material   It is generally known that aluminium oxide has a high degree of hardness and a low heal conductivity at 10000C.   In case of application of the compound material as cutting tool, the heat generated during machining is therefore mainly conducted to the borings and only to a much lesser extent to the cutting tool, which reduces the danger of plastic deformations of the cutting edge   Aluminium oxide is also oxidation resistant at high temperatures, the inclination towards wear with iron substances as well as the coefficient of friction is very low   However, in case of deposition of pure Al2O3-coatings one has the problem, that the grain growth during deposition can be only controlled with great difficulties   The ZrO2 or HfO2. which compared to AI2O, are more resistant to chemical reactions and have extraordinarily low frictional values vis-a-vis iron substances, are on the other hand softer than Al2O3, but however have the advantage that during common deposition with Al2O3 they reduce the crystallite growth of the Al2O3-phase and in the compound also reduce the coefficient of friction   Besides, the ZrO2-and/or HfO2-portion in the Al2O3 coating increases their heat-insulating effect, as ZrO2 only has I/10 of the heat conductivity as compared to Al2O3   Depending on the purpose of application, during which one should be able to utilize better chemical inertness, improved heat insulation of the ZrO2 or HfO2 or the higher wear resistance of A12O3 against friction, one should select the corresponding ratio of both phases accordingly. Ideally, the ratio of Al2O3 phase with respect to the ZrO2-, HfO2- or ZrO2/ HfO2-phase should lie between 9/10 and 10/1, whereby the ZrO2 and HfO2 could be present in the monoclinical and/or tetragonal form<br>
The third, fine-crystalline phase, according to another version of the invention, has a size which is less than 1/100 of the size of the crystallite of the A12O3 and the ZrO2- or HfO2-phases.<br><br><br>
-5-<br>
According to a further version of the invention, the compound material coating is multi-layered and has at least one layer made of carbide, nitride, carbonitride of one of the elements of the IVa- to Vla-group of the period system. Here, as intermediate layer between the basic body and the outermost layer made of Al2O3/ZrO2 (if required replaced totally or partly by HfO2) /TiOx, one uses a coating of TiN and/or Ti (C, N). These layers prevent the danger of the relatively brittle ceramic coating from getting peeled off from the basic body.<br>
The thickness of the Al2O3/Zr02 or HfO2/TiOx layer should preferably be between 1 ?m and 10 ?m, particularly between 2 urn and 8 urn. The total thickness of coating should not exceed<br>
25 ?m.<br>
In a special design form, the first layer deposited on the base body and made of a titanium nitride or titanium carbonitride has a thickness between 3 and 8 urn and the second layer made of Al2O3/ZrO2 or HfO2/TiOx has a thickness between 2 and 8 ?m, whereby this second layer is either the outer layer or on this second layer an external layer of TiN, ZrO2 or ZrCN with a thickness between 1 and 5 urn has been deposited.<br>
For producing the above described Al2O3- ZrO2- or HfO2- TiOx-layer, as per the invention the method as mentioned in claim 9 is suggested. For CVD deposition, deposition temperatures of between 900°C and 1000°C are selected. The temperature should not be below 900°C as, far as possible on account of the otherwise too low deposition rate, whereas the deposition temperatures of 1000°C should not be exceeded, as at high temperatures very thick depositions occur in the region of the edges of the compound material, which particularly lead to undesirable crumbling during application of the compound material as cutting tool. The pressure in the gas atmosphere which is composed of AICI3, ZrCl3, HfCl4, CO2, H2, CH4 and<br><br>
-6-<br>
N2 or inert gases, is 10 to 100000 Pa   According to the invention, the gas phase contains 0 2 to 5 mol % TiCl4   With the exception of the portions of titanium chloride as per the invention in the gas phase, the CVD method is basically known from the state-of-the-art technology, e g. from the already cited document DF 195 18 927 Al.<br>
According fo a further design, the gas phase portion of the AlCl3 is 1 to 5 mol % and/or (he gas phase portion of ZrCl4 or HfCl4 is 0 2 to 5 mol %, in order to obtain the desired relative percentual shares of the AlO3-phase to the ZrO2- or HfO2-phase   The gas phase pressure should ideally he below 10000 Pa. preferably 8000 Pa   For deposition of a multi-layered coating on a hard meial base body, which had a composition of 94 M% WC. rest Co, a CVD method with a gas phase temperature of 1000°C was selected   The pressure of the respective gas phase was 8000 Pa<br>
In a first design example, on the mentioned hard metal body a subsequent layer of TiN. Ti (C. N) and the described AlO3/ZrO2/TiO-outer layer was applied   The individual layer thicknesses as well as the gases used can be obtained from the following table<br>

Total thickness	14 2<br>
The gas phase composition in case of deposition of outer layer consisted of 10 1 AlCl3, 2 5 1 ZrCl4, 161 TiCl4. 20 HCO2. 40 1 N2. 320 1 H2 and 1 5 1 CH4,   The layer structure can be<br><br>
obtained in fig. I which-shows a REM fractured structure picture.  As one can see from the enlarged REM-structural image of the outer layer, as shown in fig. 2, the outer layer had Al2O3 - portions appearing as dark phases. ZrO2 portions appearing as bright phases, as well as a TiOX phase which can be seen as white dots. This phase has a crystallite size which is lesser than 1/100 of the crystallite size of both the other phases of Al2O3; and ZrO;.<br>
¦   As a comparison to this, on a substrate body which similarly has a composition 94 M% WC. 6 M% Co. the following layer sequence was applied.<br>
