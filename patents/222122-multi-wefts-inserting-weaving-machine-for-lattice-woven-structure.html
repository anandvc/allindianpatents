[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a multi wefts inserting weaving machine of a lattice woven structure for an industrial purpose.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
The weaving rrmchine of the present invention can produce a lattice woven structure by waving warps through a block arraying device followed by simultaneously supplying a plural number of wefts through weft supplying rollers.<br>
An intersection lattice structure is conventionally used for reinforcing the material of public works and protecting structures such a barn, structures on construction, facility and so forth.<br>
Forming an intersectional structure of a strong material requires a step of waving the material in a regular pattern. Conventionally, the step has been accomplished by up and down round trip movements of a heald. However, the conventional weft inserting weaving machines such as a projectile weaving machine and a shuttle weaving machine are limited in terms of weft-directional width of their final product. Further they have a problem that the strong and thick weft material cannot be employed.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors endeavor to develop the present machine capable of weaving a wide lattice structure for an industrial purpose, wherein the weft-directional width of the product is theoretically unlimited by increasing the number of rows o f u nit b locks, a nd a p lural n umber o f s trong o r t hick w efts a re s imultaneously inserted through weft supplying rollers.<br>

[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
The lattice structure of the present invention represents any structure used for industrial purposes wherein warp and weft are intersected each other.<br>
The multi wefts inserting weaving machine of the present invention comprises a block arraying device (203) at the center of upper part which is followed by a tension controlling guide (401), warp distributing rollers (404) and warp creels (301) in a warp-direction. A take-up roller (702) for taking up a lattice woven structure produced is equipped preceding the block arraying device in a warp-direction, and a device for binding the wefts and warps at contact points in the lattice woven structure may be optionally employed between the block arraying device (203) and the take-up roller (702). In a weft-direction, the block arraying device is followed by weft supplying rollers (402) and weft creels successively, and preceded by a weft sensor (609). A shearing apparatus including a shearing motor (606), a shearing crank (607) and a shearing blade (608) is located between the block arraying device (203) and the weft supplying roller (402). An operational part of the present weaving machine is located under the block arraying device (203).<br>
In the present invention, the lattice woven structure is obtained by arraying the unit blocks (201) on the internal side of facing upper (203a) and lower (203b) plates alternatively in accordance with the desired pattern of lattice; locating warps (303) between upper and lower plates at specific intervals; waving warps along the warp-directional grooves (202a) installed on the surface of unit blocks (201)to form openings for wefts by approaching the upper and lower plates each other; and inserting wefts through weft directional grooves (202b) installed on the surface of the unit blocks (201).<br>
Hereinafter, the feature of each part of the present weaving machine is described with taken injunction with the .accompanying drawings.<br>
The block arraying device (203) comprises an upper plate (203a) and a lower<br>
5<br><br>
plate (203b) facing each other. Combining grooves (204) installed inside (facing side) of each plate enable the unit blocks to reversibly attach to the upper and lower plates so that the attaching positions of the unit blocks can be altered in accordance with the lattice intervals and patterns of the desired lattice woven structure.<br>
In the present invention, the unit blocks are arrayed on the internal sides of facing upper (203a) and lower (203b) plates alternatively in accordance with the desired pattern of lattice structure. Alternative array of the unit blocks (201) on the internal sides of upper (203 a) and lower (203b) plates means that the unit blocks on the upper plate and the unit blocks on the lower plate are not arrayed to contact each other but arrayed in neighbors and/or turns to wave the warps along the grooves on the surface of the unit blocks and form the openings for wefts, when the upper and lower plates approach each other. The attaching points (501) of the unit blocks on die block arraying device represent contact points of the warps and wefts in the lattice woven structure. Total number of the unit blocks arrayed on the upper (203a) and the lower (203b) plates are same as the number of the contact points (501) of the warps and wefts in the desired lattice structure.<br>
The hexahedral unit block wherein two rectangular grooves (202a, b) are installed in different depths on the surface and the other groove is installed on the back surface for reversible attaching to the combining grooves (204) of the upper or lower plate, is shown in Fig. 3. When attaching to the combining grooves (204) the unit blocks are oriented so as that the weft (304) is supplied through a deeper one of the two rectangular grooves (202). The two rectangular grooves are smoothed and rounded to facilitate the insertion of the weft and the warp. Further, the width and depth of the rectangular grooves (202) may be varied depending on dimension and hardness of warp and weft.<br>
The warp is supplied to the block arraying device from the warp creel through the warp distributing roller (404) and the tension controlling guide (401). The warp distributing roller keeps a specific distance between the neighboring warps, for example the same distance as the interval of the warp-directional rows of the unit blocks which are arrayed in accordance with the gauge of the desired lattice structure. A conventional tension controlling guide may be employed in the present weaving machine.   For instance, as shown in Fig. 5, the tension controlling device wherein five<br>
6<br><br>
(5) rollers are arranged up and down alternatively may be used in the present invention.<br>
The weft supplying roller (402) of the present weaving machine is equipped at each weft-directional row of unit blocks and guides the weft of various dimensions to the weft directional groove (202b) of the unit block. As shown in Fig. 5, the weft supplying roller (402) preferably consists of a plural number of rollers, for instance 4 rollers in upper and lower part, respectively, and the number of rollers may be varied depending on weft material. Further, a guide groove (403) is installed on the surface of the weft supplying roller (402) to level the weft, prevent the secession of the weft, and control the tension of the weft. The width and depth of the guide groove (403) may be varied depending on dimension of the weft.<br>
Fig. 6 ^grammatically shows the operation mechanism of the block arraying device of the present weaving machine from a weft-directional side (unit blocks of solid line (201a) and of dotted line (201b) represent those in different rows when viewed from a warp-directional side). In Fig 6 (a), the warps (303) are located between upper (203a) and lower (203b) plates, the upper plate descends and the lower plate rises. As indicated in Fig. 6 (b), when the upper and lower plate get sufficiently close, the warp is waved along the warp directional grooves (202a) of the unit blocks, to form the weft directional openings for weft inserting. Subsequently the weft is inserted'into the opening along the weft-directional groove (202b) of the unit block to form a lattice woven structure as seen in Fig. 6 (c). The weft is supplied by the weft supplying roller (402) and cut by the shearing apparatus (606, 607 and 608) when the end of the weft contacts the weft sensor (609). Lastly, as seen in Fig 6 (c) the upper plate rises and the lower plate (203b) descends to release a lattice woven structure (101).<br>
The present weaving machine may further c omprise a device for binding the wefts and warps at contact points such as a point welding apparatus and a thermo-fusion roller depending on physical properties of the weft and warp.<br>
The present multi wefts inserting weaving machine is able to produce lattice woven structure of various lattice intervals and patterns by altering the number and the attaching points of the unit blocks to combining grooves (204) installed on the internal sides of the upper and lower plates. For instance, a plain lattice structure is obtained by arraying one row of unit blocks on the upper plate and another row of the unit blocks on the lower plate alternatively in both warp and weft directions and making the total<br>
7<br><br>
number of rows even. A 2/1 twill lattice structure is obtained by arraying two rows of the unit blocks on the upper plate and another one row on the lower plate alternatively or vice versa. Accordingly the total number of the rows is a multiple of three (3). Figs. 7 and 8 show the plain and twill lattice structures obtained by the present weaving machine, respectively (the unit blocks arrangement of A leads to the lattice structure of B).<br>
The present multi wefts inserting weaving machine is able to produce the wide lattice woven structure in a high rate by increasing the number of the rows of the unit blocks in a weft-direction and a warp-direction. The more are the warp-directional rows of the unit blocks, the more wefts are inserted simultaneously so as to speed up the production of the lattice structure, and the more are the weft-directional rows of the unit blocks, the wider lattice structure is obtained.<br>
The present weaving machine further comprises an operational part under the block arraying device (203). The operational mechanism of the present weaving machine is described with taken injunction with Fig. 9.<br>
The thick or strong warps, i.e., steel wire and metal wire are supplied through the tension controlling guide (401) and placed between upper and lower plates at specific intervals in accordance with the gauge of the desired lattice structure. As shown in fig 9, the rotation of transfer motor (601) drives the up and down movement of transfer rods (603) which are connected to upper and lower plates through transfer cranks (602), subsequently to lead downward movement of the upper plate and upward movement of the lower plate so as to wave the warps to form openings for wefts. The rotation of a weft inserting motor (604) drives the rotation of the weft supplying roller (402) and the weft is supplied along a series of the weft directional grooves (202b) of the unit blocks to form a lattice structure (101). When the end of the weft contacts the weft sensor (609), the rotation of the shearing motor (606) is delivered to up and down movement of the shearing blade (608) through the shearing crank (607) by an electric relay method, and the wefts are cut by a same length in accordance with the width of the lattice structure. The lattice woven structure (101) is transferred and taken up by the take-up roller (702) driven by the take-up motor (701) located at a warp-directional front of the block arraying device (203). Before the lattice structure taken up, the weft and warp may be bound at contact points (501) by the device for binding such as a point<br>
8<br><br>
welding apparatus and a thermo-fusion roller depending upon their physical properties.<br>
The present invention provides a preparing method of a lattice woven structure by using the multi wefts inserting weaving machine ofthe present invention, comprising the following steps:<br>
(1)	a step of arraying unit blocks (201) on the upper (203 a) and lower (203b) plates in accordance with the pattern of a desired lattice woven structure (101);<br>
(2)	a step of locating warps (303) between the upper plate (203a) and lower plates (203b) at specific intervals;<br>
(3)	a step of waving the warps (303) along the warp-directional grooves (202a) installed on the surface ofthe unit block (201) by approaching the upper (203a) and lower (203b) plates;<br>
(4)	a step of inserting the wefts (304) along the weft directional grooves (202b) installed on the surface ofthe unit block (201).<br>
Hereinafter, each step of the preparing method of the present invention is described in case of a plain lattice structure.<br>
(1) the step of arraying the unit blocks on the upper and lower plates The unit blocks are arrayed on the internal (facing) sides ofthe upper and lower plates in accordance with the pattern of the desired lattice woven structure. One row of the unit blocks are arrayed on the upper plate and another row on the lower plate alternatively in both weft and warp directions. That is, one unit block on the upper plate is neighbored with four unit blocks on the lower plate and vice versa. Total number ofthe rows ofthe unit blocks is even, and the interval ofthe rows is 10 to 100 mm, preferably 30 to 70 mm in both weft and warp directions.<br>
(2) the step of locating warps between the upper plate and lower plate The. warps, i.e., thick fiber and strong material, equipped in the creels (301) are supplied to the block arraying device (203) along the tension controlling gui.de roller (401) while maintaining specific intervals such as same intervals as the warp-directional rows of the unit blocks by the warp distributing roller (404). Further, the warp may be linearized by a heating apparatus employed in the tension controlling guide (401) before supplying.<br>
(3) the step of waving the warps by approaching the upper and lower plates The warps (303) are waved along the warp directional grooves (202a) installed<br>
9<br><br>
on the unit block (201) by approaching the upper (203a) and lower (203b) plates, to form the weft-directional openings, which consist of the weft directional grooves (202b) of the unit blocks, for weft inserting.<br>
(4) the step of inserting the wefts<br>
The wefts (304) in the weft creels (302) are supplied along the weft-directional grooves (202a) by the weft supplying rollers (402) wherein a guide groove (403) is installed on the surface to level the weft, prevent the secession of the weft, and control the tension of the weft. The depth and width of the guide groove (403) are varied depending on the dimension of the weft. The heating apparatus may also be employed in the weft supplying roller to linearize the weft. The wefts also keep specific intervals each other, for example the same interval as that of the weft-directional rows of the unit blocks which are arrayed in accordance with the gauge of the desired lattice structure.<br>
The present invention provides a preparing method of lattice woven structures of great variety of the lattice intervals and patterns, which comprises a step of altering the number and the attaching points of the unit blocks to combining grooves installed on the internal sides of the upper and lower plates in the step (1).<br>
The present invention also provides a preparing method of producing the wide lattice woven structure, which further comprises a step of increasing the number of the rows of the unit blocks in a weft-direction in the step (1) and a preparing nl ethod of producing the lattice woven structure in a high rate, which further comprises a step of increasing the number of the rows of the unit blocks in a warp-direction in the step (1). The more are the warp-directional rows of the unit blocks, the more wefts are inserted simultaneously so as to speed up the production of the lattice structure. The more are the weft-directional rows of the unit blocks, the wider lattice structure is obtained.<br>
The preparing method of the present invention may further comprise a step of binding together the warp and weft at contact points by the device for binding such as a point welding apparatus and a thermo-fusion roller depending on physical properties of weft and warp.<br>
Accordingly, the lattice woven structure from the strong or thick material can easily woven by the present multi wefts inserting weaving machine, and the lattice woven structures of various patterns can be obtained by varying the number and the attaching positions of the unit blocks.<br>
