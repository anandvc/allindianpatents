The invention relates to a method and a jigger for dyeing textile webs of polyester (PES) fibres or mixtures of PES fibres and other natural fibres, more particularly cellulose fibres such as cotton, linen, wool or the like and synthetic fibres such as viscose fibres, wherein a web of material is unwound from a roll, conveyed through a dyeing bath and then wound to form a roll and the process is repeated after each reversal of motion of the web.<br>
Polyester fibres are much more difficult to dye than other conventional textile fibres.  This is because of their closed structure and high degree of orientation, which results in low swelling capacity and in water-repellent properties.  In addition, the polyester fibre does not contain any free dye-bonding groups and has only slightly affinity for water-soluble dyes.<br>
With few exceptions, polyester fibres can be dyed only with dispersion dyes, which can be used on polyester textiles by the following three basic methods:<br>
1)	Dyeing at temperatures up to 100°C on machines operating at atmospheric pressure, using special aids or "carriers";<br>
2)	Dyeing at temperatures between 120°0 and 130°C on "HT" dyeing machines operating at elevated pressure and<br><br>
3)  Thermosol methods wherein the dye applied to the material is fixed by dry heat at a temperature range from 190° to 220°C.<br>
The thermosol method mentioned in 3) is disadvantageous owing to the relatively low liquor pick-up of about 35% when dyeing textile webs containing up to 100% polyester fibres. More particularly the dye pick-up is insufficiently uniform. In addition, the thermosol method, like all continuous processes, is economic only for dyeing large batches.<br>
Dyeing with carriers as per 1) was frequently used, particularly in the first phase of introduction of polyester fibres into textile production.  Nowadays it is much less used.  Carriers allow PES fibres to swell adequately at temperatures as low as 95°C, thus promoting the diffusion of dyes into the PES fibres. However, carriers are usually toxic and their use is inconsistent with protection of the environment.<br>
The main method of extractive dyeing therefore is HT dyeing at 120°C to 130°C.  However dyeing at temperatures above 100°C is possible only on installations designed for an excess pressure corresponding to the stated temperature range.<br>
For example it is known to use an "HT" jigger for dyeing of PES fibres with dispersion dyes, enabling dyeing to be carried out at a temperature of 120°C to 130°C.  To this end, the jigger casing must withstand a vapour pressure of 2 to 5 bar.  This complicates the construction and operation of a plant of this kind.<br><br>
The object of  tne invention therefore is to improve the dyeing of textile webs of polyester and mixtures thereof.<br>
This problem is solved by a proposed method having the features in claim 1.<br>
One critical factor when dyeing PES is the dyeing temperature.  In dyeing machines which operate without pressure (at atmospheric pressure), the liquor cannot be raised above the boiling temperature, which as is known depends on the height above sea level.  At a height above sea level of about 300 metres, the maximum temperature attainable in closed dyeing vessels is about 98°C to 99°C, even if the space inside the jigger hood is perfectly sealed.<br>
According to the invention, the textile web after leaving the dyeing bath, which is at or immediately below boiling point, is heated and brought to the saturated steam temperature of 100°C and is wound up under these operating conditions.  (The temperature is so to speak incorporated in the winding and assists the winding-up process).  A temperature gain of only a few degrees results in an appreciable increase of several percent in the dye yield.  The inventive step ensures the maximum temperature increase possible at atmospheric pressure, and is used to improve the result of the process.  By means of the invention, textile webs containing polyester fibres can be dyed with good colour depth and colour fastness in apparatus requiring a comparatively simple and not pressure-resistant casing and with comparatively low use of energy.<br><br>
without need for a large number of passes of material through the dyeing bath.<br>
The additional heating according to the invention is advantageously provided by blowing saturated steam (claim 2).<br>
The efficiency of dyeing according to the invention is increased by a suitable choice of dye.  Use is made of dispersion dyes which diffuse into and dye the polyester fibres under the stated conditions, i.e. at temperatures of about 100°C.  The selection is also determined by fulfilment of the following criteria:<br>
a)	Dye yield under atmospheric pressure at least 65% or more at 2% dyeing, i.e. weight of dye in the liquor = 2% weight of material-<br>
b)	Light-fastness at the same depth of colour is at least 5 (DIN 54004).<br>
c)	Washing fastness at 60°C at least 4/4-5/4-5 (DIN 54010) -<br>
d)	Fastness in reducing medium.<br>
The following types of dispersion dyes have been found particularly advantageous in this respect for dyeing textile webs of PES fibres by the method according to the invention (claim 3):<br>
Colour Index Disperse Yellow 3<br>
e.g. Cellintongelb G (BASF)<br><br>
Colour Index Disperse Yellow 60 e.g. Resolingelb RL (Bayer)<br>
Colour Index Disperse Yellow 68<br>
e-g, Samarongoldgelb HGL (Hoechst)<br>
Colour Index Disperse Orange 3<br>
e.g. Cellitonorange GR (BASF)<br>
Colour Index Disperse Red 1<br>
e.g. Cibacetscharlach 2B (Ciba-Geigy)<br>
Colour Index Disperse Red 50<br>
e.g. Resolinscharlach RR (Bayer)<br>
Colour Index Disperse Violet 1<br>
e.g. Cibacetviolett 2R (Ciba-Geigy)<br>
Colour Index Disperse Blue 81<br>
e.g. Resolinblau GRL (Bayer)<br>
These dyes, in the widest sense, are "small-molecular" dispersion dyes, i.e. "low-energy" types with high migration capacity, i.e. requiring little energy for penetrating into the fibres and having acceptable fastness on sublimation.  The same applies, with some restrictions, to "medium-molecular" dispersion dyes, i.e. "medium-energy" types with adequate migration capacity and very good fastness on  sublimation.  Large molecular dispersion dyes or "high-energy" types with low migration capacity and maximum fastness on sublimation are usually less suitable or unsuitable.<br><br>
The said dispersion dyes meet the previously-mentioned criteria.  They can also be used for trichromatic dyeing to the required extent, and also have sufficient fastness on sublimation.  The said types of dyes are more efficient, particularly in combination with the additional heating, i.e. at higher dyeing temperatures.<br>
Another important factor improving the efficiency of dyeing by the method according to the invention is the liquor ratio or concentration gradient.  The concentration gradient influences the diffusion of dye into the fibres.<br>
According to claim 4 the dyeing liquor ratio should be from 1 : 1,3 to 1 : 2.5.  This doubles the concentration of dye in the liquor compared with conventional jiggers.  The same factor has a very marked effect on the dye yield.<br>
One exemplfied embodiment of the invention will now be explained in detail with reference to a drawing of a two-tank jigger of the kind in question.  The drawing is a perspective view, partly diagrammatic and in section, of a jigger having known basic components.<br>
The jigger comprises two winding rollers 21, 22 in a casing 10, between which a textile web 1 of PES fibres is wound and unwound and between which two small tanks 11, 12 are disposed, for alternate or successive use during the same run, a vertically adjustable width-adjusting and spreading tube 13 being disposed between the tanks.  Rollers 14, 15 for pressing with adjustable force against the winding rollers 21, 22 are provided<br><br>
ana designed to improve the neatness of the rolls-  The casing 10 is suitably and efficiently sealed against penetration of or exchange with external air.  It has a pivotable hatch 16 for batch-changing.<br>
An automatic control system 17 associated with temperature sensors (not shown separately in the drawing) keeps the dyeing liquors 2, 3 in the tanks 11, 12, by means of heating registers 4, at a temperature equal to or only slightly, e.g. 1%°C below the boiling point of the dye liquors at the prevailing atmospheric pressure.<br>
Steam-spraying tubes 18, 19 carrying saturated steam and provided with nozzles along their length are disposed in the space above the dyeing tanks 11, 12 (optionally only one of which is used) in such manner that the textile web 1 is sprayed over its entire width with saturated steam 24 in that region of the winding roller on which the textile web 1 of PES fibres has just been wound (i.e. roller 22 in the drawing).  The steam-spraying tubes 18 are disposed immediately in front of the place where the textile web 1 runs on to the roll and act on the corresponding side of the textile web 1, which faces them when the roll is being wound, so that it runs on to the roll immediately after its temperature has been raised by a few degrees.  The steam-spraying tubes 19 act on the outer periphery of the roll.  The spraying raises the temperature to the saturated steam temperature, at least in that area of the web 1 which is running on to the roll, and at the periphery of the roll.  Of course, spraying of saturated steam can advantageously be continued when<br><br>
The PES textile web ±s unwound from the corresponding roll (from roller 21 in the drawing).<br>
In principle, other methods can be used for additionally heating the textile web 1.  As before, heating is controlled by the automatic control unit 17, using suitable measuring devices.<br>
It has been found very advantageous to add "film-forming agents" to the dyeing liquor for PES fibres in tanks 11 and 12.  Film-forming agents based on acrylamide polymers increased the liquor pick-up by 10%.  The increased amount of liquor was particularly advantageous inside the roll of material, because the dye supply during the residence time on the roll was greater and the dye diffusion was accelerated.  Dyeing was also found to be more uniform.  As little as 3 to 5 g of an acrylamide polymer-based film-forming agent per litre of dyeing liquor was sufficient.<br>
The following test dyeing operations were performed on the jigger as described;<br>

PES (pre-washed), 1200 m, 246.4 kg<br>
