				<td>Heat-stable anion exchangers<br>
The present invention relates to heat-stable anion exchangers based on at least one aromatic monomer and at least one crosslinker having structural elements of the general formula (I)<br>
 <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where<br>
Ak, Ak', Ak"   are in each case independently of one another identically or differently a C\-C\s-alkyl radical,<br>
n	is an even number between 5 and 18,<br>
x + y = 2 and<br>
X is Cl, Br, OH, HC()3, HS04, 1/2 (S04), 1/2 CO3, N03, F, H2PO4, 1/2 HPO4, 1/3 PO4 with the result that these anion exchangers, preferably in the OH form, withstand a working temperature of at least 60°C, preferably of at least 80°C, over a relatively long time, a process for production thereof and also uses thereof A relatively long period in the meaning of the present invention is 1 to 12 months, preferably 1 to 10 months, particularly preferably 1 to 8 months.<br>
Ion exchangers are used in many sectors such as, for example for softening water, for deionizing and purifying aqueous solutions, for separation and purification of sugar and amino acid solutions and for producing high-purity water in the electronics and Pharmaceuticals industries. However, the conventional anion exchangers cannot be used under extreme temperature conditions. In particular, their thermal stability leaves something to be desired. If it is wished to avoid premature breakdown of the functional groups, the maximum temperature for a long term use must not be above 60°C. Even at room temperature, with conventional resins, a certain breakdown of the resin and release of the resin constituents into the surrounding solution, what is termed bleaching, is unavoidable.<br>
For certain applications having high working temperatures in the range above 60°C, anion exchangers are required which withstand these elevated temperatures for a relatively long time period. Such conditions occur, for example, in deionizing in the heat-exchange of various machinery and plants, such as, for example, engines and power stations (conventional and nuclear).<br>
 <br>
In such applications, the anion exchangers are usually used in combination with a cation exchanger, also in mixed form in what are termed mixed beds. In order to be able to comply with the task of deionizing, the anion exchangers must be used with OH" as counterion (what is termed the OH form),<br>
EP-A 0 444 643 and IP-A 2003 230881 mention anion-exchange resins which can be used in the OH form at relatively high temperatures. The production pathway of these thermally stable resins proceeds via a complex chemistry which is associated with low yields. As a result, the availability of these resins is not assured in industrial amounts.<br>
An object of the present invention was therefore the synthesis of bead-type anion exchangers which withstand a working temperature of at least 60°C, preferably at least 80°C, over a relatively long time, to make them available in industrial amounts.<br>
The solution of the object and subject matter of the present invention are anion exchangers in bead form based on at least one aromatic monomer and at least one crosslinker having structural elements of the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where<br>
Ak, Ak', Ak"   are in each case independently of one another identically or differently a CrC,8-alkyl radical,<br>

X is Cl, Br, OH, HCO3, HSO4) '1/2(S04), 1/2 C03, N03, F, H2PO4, 1/2 HPO4) Vi PO4.<br>
Surprisingly, the anion exchangers according to the invention exhibit particularly thermostable properties and are, in addition, compared with the anion exchangers known from the prior art, simple to synthesize. They are outstandingly suitable for deionizing water in cooling circuits or for use as catalyst in chemical reactions.<br>
The anion exchangers according to the invention can be obtained either by alkylating amine-containing bead polymers or by polymerization of alkylated amine-containing monomers.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a process for producing heat-stable anion exchangers based on at least one aromatic monomer and at least one crosslmker containing a structural element of the general formula (I),<br>
 <br>

where   Ak, Ak', Ak' are in each case independently of one another identically or differently a Cr C18-alkyl radical,<br>
n	is an even number between 5 and 18,<br>
K + y-2 and<br>
X is Cl, Br, OH, HCO3, HS04, 1/2 (SO4),'1/2 CO3, NO3, F, H2PO4,1/2 HPO4,1/2 PO4, characterized in that either amine-containing bead polymers are alkylated, or alkylated amine-containing monomers are polymerized, and the ion exchangers obtained by both variants are converted to the ionic form by changing the charge,<br>
For producing amine-containing bead polymers, preferably amine-containing monomers, particularly preferably vinylbenzylamines, alone or in combination with other non-functional monomers are (co)polymerized in bead form.<br>
A preferred method for producing amine-containing bead polymers is first to generate non-functionalized bead polymers by suspension polymerization of non-functionalized monomers and to provide these with amine functions in one or more downstream step(s).<br>
As non-functional!zed monomers, use is made in general of monoethylenically unsaturated aromatic monomers, preferably styrene, a-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, t-butylsryrene or vinylnaphthalene. Substances which are highly suitable are also mixtures of these monomers and also mixtures of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers having up to 20% by weight of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, preferably chlorostyrene, bromostyrene, acrylonitnle,<br>
methacrylonitrile, esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylhexyl methacrylate, decyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate, or iso-bomyl methacrylate. In particular, preference is given to styrene and vinyltoluene.<br>
Crosslinkers are added to the monomers. Crosslinkers are generally multiethylenically unsaturated compounds, preferably divinylbenzene, divinyltoluene, trivinylbenzene, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol divinyl ether, diethylene glycol divinyl ether, butanediol dtvmyl ether, octadiene or triallyl cyanurate. Particular preference is given to the vinylaromatic crosslmkers divinylbenzene or trivinylbenzene. Very particular preference is given to divinylbenzene. The Crosslinkers can be used alone or as a mixture of various Crosslinkers. The total amount of Crosslinkers to be used is generally 0.1 to 80% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 60% by weight, particularly preferably 1 to 40% by weight, based on the sum of the ethylenically unsaturated compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, pore forming agents, which are termed porogens, can also be added to the monomers. The porogens serve for formation of a pore structure in the non-functional bead polymer. As porogens, use is preferably made of organic diluents. Particularly preferably, use is made of those organic diluents which dissolve to less than 10% by weight, preferably less than 1% by weight, in water. Porogens which are suitable in particular are toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, cyclohexane, octane, isooctane, decane, dodecane, isododecane, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, dibutyl phthalate, n-butanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol and n-octanol. Very particular preference is given to toluene, cyclohexane, isooctane, isododecane, 4-methyl-2-pentanol and methyl isobutyl ketone. As porogen, however, use can also be made of non-crosslinked linear or branched polymers, such as, for example, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate).<br>
The porogen is customarily used in amounts of 10 to 70% by weight, preferably 25 to 65% by weight, in each case based on the sum of the ethylenically unsaturated compounds.<br>
In the production of the non-functional bead polymers, the abovementioned monomers, in a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, are polymerized in aqueous suspension in the presence of a dispersion aid using an initiator.<br>
As dispersion aid, use is preferably made of natural and synthetic water-soluble polymers. Particularly preferably, use is made of gelatin, starch, poly(vinyl alcohol), polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly(acryhc acid), poly(methacrylic acid) or copolymers of (meth)acrylic acid and (meth)acrylic esters. Very particularly preferably, use is made of gelatin or cellulose derivatives, in particular<br>
cellulose esters and cellulose ethers, such as carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose or methylhydroxyethylcellulose. The amount of the dispersion aid used is generally 0.05 to 1%, preferably 0.1 to 0.5%, based on the aqueous phase.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, initiators are used. Suitable initiators are compounds which form free radicals on temperature increase. Preferably, use is made of peroxy compounds, particularly preferably dibenzoyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, bis-(p-chlorobenzoyl) peroxide, dicyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate and tert-amyl peroxy-2-ethylhexane and also azo compounds, particularly preferably 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile) or 2,2 '-azobis(2-methyliso-butyronitrile) or else aliphatic peroxy esters, preferably tert-butyl peroxyacetate, tert-butyl peroxyisoburyrate, tert-butyl peroxypivalate, tert-butyl peroxyoctoate, tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, tert-butyl peroxyneodecanoate, tert-amyl peroxypivalate, tert-amyl peroxyoctoate, tert-amyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, tert-amyl peroxyneodecanoate, 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexanoyl-peroxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-dipivaloyl-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-bis(2-neodecanoylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, di-tert-butyl peroxyazelate and di-tert-amyl peroxyazelate.<br>
The initiators are generally used in amounts of 0.05 to 6.0% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 5.0% by weight, particularly preferably 0.2 to 2% by weight, based on the sum of the ethylenically unsaturated compounds.<br>
The aqueous phase can contain a buffer system which sets the pH of the aqueous phase to between 12 and 3, preferably between 10 and 4. Particularly highly suitable buffer systems contain phosphate, acetate, citrate or borate salts.<br>
It can be advantageous to make use of an inhibitor dissolved in the aqueous phase. Inhibitors which come into consideration are both inorganic and organic substances. Examples of inorganic inhibitors are nitrogen compounds such as hydroxylamine, hydrazine, sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite. Examples of organic inhibitors are phenolic compounds such as hydroquinone, hydroqumone monomethyl ether, resorcinol, pyrocatechol, tert-butyl pyrocatechol, condensation products of phenols with aldehydes. Further organic inhibitors are nitrogenous compounds such as, for example, diethylhydroxylamine and isopropylhydroxylamine. Resorcinol is preferred as inhibitor. The concentration of the inhibitor is 5-1000ppm, preferably 10-500 ppm, particularly preferably 20-250 ppm, based on the aqueous phase.<br>
The organic phase can be dispersed into the aqueous phase as droplets by stirring or by jetting. An organic phase is taken to mean the mixture of monomer(s) and crosslinker(s) and also if appropriate porogen(s) and/or initiator(s). hi classic dispersion polymerization, the organic droplets are generated by stirring. On a 4 liter scale, typically, stirrer speeds of 250 to 400 rpm are used. If the droplets are produced by jetting, it is advisable, to obtain uniform droplet diameter, to<br>
encapsulate the organic droplets. Processes for microencapsulation of jetted organic droplets are described, for example, in EP-A 0046 535, the contents of which with respect to microencapsulation are incorporated by reference in the present application.<br>
The average particle size of the optionally encapsulated monomer droplets is 10-1000/mi, preferably 100-1000 pirn.<br>
The ratio of the organic phase to the aqueous phase is generally 1:20 to 1:0.6, preferably 1:10 to 1:1, particularly preferably 1:5 to 1:1.2.<br>
However, the organic phase, in the seed-feed process can also be added to a suspension of seed polymers which take up the organic phase according to EP-A 0 617 714, the teaching of which is incorporated by reference in the present application. The mean particle size of the seed polymers swollen by the organic phase is 5-1200 /mi, preferably 20-1000 /mi. The ratio of the sum of organic phase + seed polymer to aqueous phase is generally 1:20 to 1:0.6, preferably 1:10 and 1:1, particularly preferably 1:5 to 1:1.2.<br>
The monomers are polymerized at elevated temperature. The polymerization temperature depends on the decomposition temperature of the initiator and is typically in the range from 50 to 150°C, preferably 60 to 120°C. The polymerization time is 30 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 2 to 15 hours.<br>
At the end of polymerization, the non-functional bead polymers are separated off from the aqueous phase, for example on a vacuum filter, and, if appropriate dried.<br>
By jetting or by seed-feed processes, the monodisperse heat-stable anion exchangers preferred according to the invention are obtained. In the present application, substances are described as monodisperse in which at least 90% by volume or by mass of the particles have a diameter which is in the range of the most frequent diameter within an interval of width of ±10% of the most frequent diameter.<br>
For example, in the case of a substance having the most frequent diameter of 0.5 mm, at least 90% by volume or by mass are within a size interval between 0.45 mm and 0.55 mm, and in the case of a substance having the most frequent diameter of 0.7 mm, at least 90% by volume or by mass are within a size interval between 0.77 mm and 0.63 mm.<br>
Functionahzation to give amine-containing bead polymers can proceed by various processes. For instance, the bead polymers can be reacted to give amine-containing bead polymers by chloromethylation and subsequent reaction with, for example, hexamethylenetetramine according to DD 79152 and IL 52121.<br>
A preferred process tor reacting non-functional polyvinylaromatic bead polymers to give amine-containing bead polymers is what is termed the phthalimide process according to US 4952608, DAS 2519244 and EIP-A 1 078 690, the teaching of which with respect to the phthalimide process is hereby incorporated by reference in the present application. In this case the non-functionalized polyvinylaromatic bead polymers are condensed with phthalimide derivatives. As catalyst, use is made of oleum, sulphuric acid or sulphur trioxide.<br>
Elimination of the phthalic acid radical and thus liberation of the aminomethyl group is performed by treating the phthalimidomethylated crosslinked bead polymer with aqueous or alcoholic solutions of an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at temperatures between 100 and 250°C, preferably 120 to 190°C. The concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution is in the range from 10 to 50% by weight, preferably 20 to 40% by weight. This process enables the production of aminoalkyl-containing crosslinked bead polymers having a substitution of the aromatic nuclei greater than 1.<br>
The resultant aminomethylated bead polymer is finally washed alkali free using deionized water.<br>
Alkylation of the amine-contaim'ng monomers and/or polymers proceeds, for example, by reaction with co-functional alkylammonium salts of the general formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)where<br>
n	is an integer between 5 and 18,<br>
Y	is Br, Cl, I or (SO4)1/3,<br>
X"	is a suitable eounterion such as, for example, Cl", Br", I", (SO42")1/2 NO3", HC03" and<br>
Ak, Ak', Ak"   are, in each case independently of one another, identically or differently a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, with or without functional<br>
groups<br>
Preferably, n is an integer from 5 to 11, Y is Br and/or Cl, X" is Br" and/or Cl" and Ak, Ak', Ak" are, in each case independently of one another, methyl, ethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, n-propyl, 2-hydroxy-propyl or n-butyl. In particular preferably, the alkylation proceeds by means of 5-bromopentyltri-<br>
methylammomum bromide, 6-bromohexyltrimethylammonium bromide, 5-chloropentyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride or 6-chlorohexyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
The co-functional alkylamrnonium salts can be used alone or else as a mixture of various co-functional alky [ammonium salts.<br>
The aminofunctional bead polymer is reacted with the co-functional alkylamrnonium salts in a solvent which not only swells the aminofunctional bead polymer but also dissolves the co-functional alkylamrnonium salts. Such solvents are, for example, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide and acetonitrile. Preference is given to water and methanol, particular preference to water.<br>
The reaction of the aminofunctional bead polymer with the co-functional alkylamrnonium salts generally proceeds at temperatures between 20°C and 100°C, preferably between 30°C and 80°C, particularly preferably between 30°C and 70°C. The reaction time is generally 0.5 to 48 h, preferably 1 to 36 h, particularly preferably 1 to 24 h. It is advantageous to carry out the reaction at a constant pH between pH 7 and pH 11, preferably between pH 8 and pH 10.<br>
The molar ratio of co-functional alkylamrnonium salts to amino groups in the aminofunctional bead polymer is generally 0.1 to 5, preferably 0.5 to 4, particularly preferably 1 to 3.<br>
After the end of the reaction, the resins are generally isolated and washed with solvent, preferably water, in order to extract the unreacted co-functional alkylamrnonium salts.<br>
The resins can be brought into the desired ionic form by changing their charge using various alkali metal hydroxide solutions, acids and salts. For instance, by treatment with sulphuric acid, what is termed the sulphate form is generated, where the anion exchanger predominantly bears sulphate ions as countenons; by treatment with sodium hydroxide solution the hydroxide form is generated, where the anion exchanger predominantly bears hydroxide ions as countenons; by treatment with sodium chloride solution the chloride form is generated, where the anion exchanger predominantly bears chloride ions as counterions, etc. For the synthesis of thermostable anion exchangers, changing the charge to the OH form is preferred.<br>
In applications for demineralization, and in particular what are termed mixed beds (polishers), resins are required which bear up to 95% hydroxide ions as counterions.<br>
Such resins can be generated by a particular sequential changing of charge using various solutions. For instance, treatment, for example, using 1 to 10 bed volumes of dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 15% by weight) followed by 1 to 20 bed volumes of sodium hydroxide solution (2 to 15% by weight) has been proved to be particularly efficient. Preference is given to 5 bed volumes of 10% strength<br>
by weight sulphuric acid followed by 4 bed volumes of 10% strength by weight sodium hydroxide solution. A bed volume is taken to mean the volume which the resin packing takes up in water after vibrating to constant volume.<br>
The strongly basic anion exchangers obtained according to the invention are distinguished by high exchange capacity, good osmotic and mechanical stability and by excellent thermal stability, for which reason they are outstandingly suitable and can be used for deionizing water in cooling circuits or for use as catalyst in chemical reactions. The strongly basic anion exchangers obtained according to the invention are very particularly suitable in the treatment of radioactively contaminated cooling circuits of primary and/or secondary circuit systems in nuclear reactors. In addition, their use in fuel cooling installations of nuclear power stations can lead to prolonged working cycles owing to the thermal stability.<br>
The strongly basic anion exchangers obtained according to the invention are, in particular, able to obtain 80% of their original strongly basic exchange capacity in the hydroxide form (at least 90% hydroxide counterions) after 3600 h at 80°C in deionized water, and also to obtain 50% of their original strongly basic exchange capacity after 3600 h at 100°C in deionized water.<br>
In a rapid test they are able to obtain 95% of their original strongly basic exchange capacity in the hydroxide form after 60 h at 100°C in 0.1 mol/1 sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter by examples. These examples are in no way a restriction of the invention described here.<br>

As a comparative example, Lewatit®    Monoplus MP500 was taken as conventional anion exchanger having benzyltrimethylamrnonium groups.<br>
Amount of weakly basic groups in mole per litre of resin in the hydroxide form: 0.02. Amount of strongly basic groups in mole per litre of resin in the hydroxide form: 0.91. Example 10:    Testing of thermal stability (rapid test).<br>
For estimation of the behaviour of a resin after 3600 h at 80°C in deionized water, the thermal stability of the anion exchange resin is tested in the following rapid test:<br>
In each case 100 ml of resin is charged into 400 ml of 0.1 mol/1 of sodium hydroxide solution and stirred for 60 h at 100°C. After the resin has cooled the volume is determined and the amount of weakly basic and strongly basic groups per litre of resin is determined.<br>
The product (resin volume) x (amount of strongly basic groups per litre of resin) gives the amount of strongly basic groups present in the tested sample.<br>
By comparing the amount of strongly basic groups before and after thermal treatment, the percentage breakdown of strongly basic groups during thermal treatment is calculated.<br>
The results are summarized in table 1:<br>
Table 1: Thermal testing of the resins from examples 4 to 9.<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It may be seen that the resins of the invention (examples 4 and 5) exhibit no significant breakdown of the strongly basic groups during the thermal treatment. Li contrast, in the commercially available resin, about one third of the strongly basic groups decompose (example 9).<br>
Resins which have fewer than 5 carbon atoms between benzylamino group and quaternary ammonium group likewise show a significant breakdown of the strongly basic groups (example 6, four carbon atoms, arid example 7, three carbon atoms).<br>
Example 8 clearly shows that thermostable anion exchangers are only obtained when the benzylamino group is not quaternized.<br>
Structure of the resin from example 8:<br>

 (Farmula Removed)<br>
<br>
 <br>
Example 11     Testing of thermal stability (long-term test)<br>
In each case 100ml of the resins from example 4 and example 9 were placed in 150ml of deionized water and heated at 80°C for 3600 h. After completion of the test, resin volume and amounts of weakly basic and strongly basic groups per litre of resin were determined.<br>
The following results were obtained:<br>
Table 2: Thermal testing of the resins from examples 4 to 9 (long-term test).<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It may be seen that after 3600 h at 80°C in the OH form in the resin according to the invention (example 4), more than 80% of the strongly basic groups are preserved. In the commercial resin not according to the invention (example 9), in contrast, after the test less than 60% of the strongly basic groups are preserved.<br>
