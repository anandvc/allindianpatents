				<td>Scrapers for link chains of scraper chain conveyors and<br>
scraper-securing element therefor<br>
The invention relates to scrapers for link chains of<br>
scraper chain conveyors, in particular double center<br>
scraper chain conveyors, comprising a one-part scraper<br>
body with a head web connecting two lateral scraper<br>
wings and at least one insertion pocket between the<br>
scraper wings for insertion of a horizontal chain link<br>
of the link chain and securing the scraper on an<br>
inserted horizontal chain link by means of a detachable<br>
scraper-securing element which can be connected to the<br>
head web, wherein the insides facing one another of the<br>
scraper wings are provided below the head web with a<br>
groove, the head web has on both front sides bearing<br>
zones for the fronts of vertical chain links of the<br>
link chain and on its underside on both sides of the<br>
bearing zones a limb bed for limbs of the horizontal<br>
chain links of the link chain. The invention also<br>
relates to the scraper-securing element provided for<br>
these scrapers.<br>
A generic scraper is known from DE 102 25 341 Cl. The<br>
known scraper can be fixed to link chains whose<br>
horizontal and vertical chain links in each case<br>
comprise oval ring eyelet members with round chain<br>
fronts. Fixing of the scraper on the horizontal chain<br>
links of these link chains is performed by means of a<br>
securing strap which runs in one piece between both<br>
insides of the scraper wings and clamps the horizontal<br>
chain links from below against the underside of the<br>
head web. The securing of the strap on the head web<br>
against detachment is performed by means of dowel pins<br>
which can be inserted into through bores, which dowel<br>
pins penetrate through the pins which are formed on the<br>
upper side of the strap and engage with corresponding<br>
locking recesses in the head web.<br><br>
DE 197 01 579 Al discloses a link chain whose front<br>
sections have straight front zones and whose vertical<br>
chain links have a wire cross-section which is constant<br>
around the full circumference and is provided on the<br>
outer periphery with a flat section. A link chain<br>
formed in this manner can also be used in high-<br>
performance scraper chain conveyors and the chain links<br>
are subject to less wear than those of a standard<br>
scraper chain with vertical and horizontal round wire<br>
chain links. The scrapers known from DE 197 01 579 Al<br>
have, for connection to this link chain, a head web on<br>
whose underside a pin projects onto which a horizontal<br>
web chain link having a transverse web can be pushed<br>
and can be fixed by means of separate locking rails. In<br>
one particular configuration of scraper and horizontal<br>
chain link, the passages in the transverse webs can<br>
also be formed substantially T-shaped. This<br>
configuration enables a positive-locking closure of pin<br>
and transverse web, wherein the chain links can be<br>
mounted at the pins only in a defined swivel position.<br>
The scrapers provided in DE 197 01 579 Al require<br>
special horizontal web chain links with transverse web<br>
and are also not suitable for withstanding the large<br>
forces which occur with a high-performance conveyor.<br>
The object of the invention is to create a scraper in<br>
particular for a link chain with special chain links<br>
which has a sufficiently long lifetime and is reliably<br>
entrained even in the case of large width and thus high<br>
potential conveying power and with low wear by the<br>
horizontal chain links of a link chain.<br>
These and further objects are achieved according to the<br>
invention in that the grooves in the insides of the<br>
scraper wings extend over the height of the limb beds<br>
up to the head web and form receivers for entrainment<br>
projections on the outer faces of the limbs of the<br>
horizontal chain links. The scrapers according to the<br>
invention are particularly suitable for a link chain<br><br>
which the applicant has developed together with the<br>
scrapers and which is the subject matter of a parallel<br>
application with the same filing date. In this link<br>
chain, entrainment projections which can cooperate with<br>
the receivers formed by the grooves on the scrapers by<br>
positive fit are formed on the outer surfaces of the<br>
limbs of the horizontal chain links in order, as a<br>
result, to move the scrapers evenly and well-supported<br>
in the conveying direction preferably in a pushing<br>
manner. In order to achieve this, the grooves in the<br>
scraper wings extend on both sides of the limb beds up<br>
to the head web such that particularly reliable, even<br>
and also low-wear entrainment of the scrapers is<br>
achieved in the running direction of the link chain due<br>
to the engagement of the entrainment projections with<br>
the grooves in the scraper.<br>
In the case of the particularly preferred<br>
configuration, the grooves in the insides extend up to<br>
the underside of the scraper wings. This not only<br>
enables precise placing and insertion of the horizontal<br>
chain links, but rather the grooves can, as is<br>
explained further below, also fix and hold a scraper-<br>
securing element by positive fit in the direction of<br>
movement.<br>
The invention can in principle also be used in the case<br>
of scrapers for single center scraper chain conveyors<br>
in which only two grooves are formed in the insides of<br>
the scraper wings and a scraper-securing element<br>
extends between these two grooves in the insides of the<br>
scraper wings. However, the preferred configuration of<br>
the scrapers has an intermediate web located at the<br>
head web between both scraper wings, which intermediate<br>
web in each case delimits an insertion pocket at one<br>
side with its outsides which face the insides and also<br>
has in each case a groove in the outside, which groove<br>
extends over the height of the limb beds up to the head<br>
web and forms a receiver for an entrainment projection<br><br>
on the outer surface of the limbs of the horizontal<br>
chain links. A corresponding scraper then has two<br>
insertion pockets lying next to one another for<br>
horizontal chain links of the link chain strands lying<br>
next to one another of a double center chain. Each<br>
horizontal chain link inserted into an insertion pocket<br>
then engages with its entrainment projections at one<br>
side of the chain bed with a groove on the inside of<br>
one of the scraper wings and on the other side of the<br>
chain bed with a groove in the outside of the<br>
intermediate web. According to one potential<br>
configuration, a scraper-securing element could then be<br>
provided which furthermore extends exclusively between<br>
both grooves in the insides and, as a one-part scraper-<br>
securing element, simultaneously secures both inserted<br>
horizontal chain links on the scraper against falling<br>
out. Nevertheless, this particularly preferred<br>
configuration provides that the grooves also reach in<br>
the outsides up to the underside of the central web,<br>
wherein the underside of the central web is then formed<br>
substantially flush with the undersides of the scraper<br>
wings in order to improve the bearing of the scrapers<br>
on the conveyor base of a conveyor. Two insertion<br>
pockets are therefore present, into which in each case<br>
a horizontal chain link with an associated scraper-<br>
securing element can be inserted and secured against<br>
falling out.<br>
In the case of the particularly preferred<br>
configuration, the limb beds are formed for insertion<br>
of horizontal chain links which have straight front<br>
zones on the front sections and recesses provided with<br>
entrainment projections in the outer surfaces of the<br>
limbs connecting the front sections to one another.<br>
Moreover, the bearing zones are preferably formed at<br>
the head web of the scraper for supporting of vertical<br>
chain links of a link chain, whose wire cross-section<br>
is constant around the full circumference and is<br>
provided on the outside with a flat section and on the<br><br>
inside preferably with a circular camber, wherein<br>
bevels are preferably formed at the transition of the<br>
flat section to the circular arc. It is particularly<br>
advantageous for receiving of the horizontal chain<br>
links of a corresponding scraper link chain if the limb<br>
beds comprise surfaces which run out flat towards the<br>
insides of the scraper wings and/or the outsides of the<br>
intermediate web, on which surfaces the substantially<br>
rectangular horizontal chain links can then be<br>
particularly well supported.<br>
The fixing of the scraper-securing element on the<br>
scraper is preferably performed by means of a fixing<br>
screw and a nut which cooperates therewith. To this<br>
end, it is particularly advantageous if a screw passage<br>
for the shaft of the fixing screw and/or a recess for<br>
insertion of a nut which cooperates with the fixing<br>
screw is/are formed in the head web between both<br>
bearing zones. It is particularly advantageous if an<br>
introduction inclination for a detachment tool opens<br>
into each recess in order to be able to detach a<br>
potentially rusted-tight nut from the shaft of the<br>
fixing screw even after many hours of operation. In<br>
this case, the detachment or tightening of the nut can<br>
be performed particularly advantageously from above and<br>
thus with easy access at all times in the upper trunk<br>
of a scraper chain conveyor, wherein possibly for<br>
mounting the scraper wings must only be pushed on from<br>
above onto the scraper-securing elements and the fixing<br>
screws and the screws must be tightened.<br>
It is particularly advantageous for the cooperation of<br>
the scraper with the vertical chain links if the<br>
bearing zones preferably embodied as circular arc-<br>
shaped cambers also extend over the front sides of a<br>
projection protruding downward at the head web between<br><br>
projection over a relatively large surface area, as a<br>
result of which a relatively large bearing face is<br>
achieved between the vertical chain links and the front<br>
sides of the scrapers and simultaneously a good angling<br>
capacity of the vertical chain links in the vertical<br>
direction is enabled. This vertical angling capacity is<br>
particularly necessary if the link chain with the<br>
connected scrapers runs around on a driven chain wheel.<br>
The projection is expediently provided centrally with<br>
the screw passage.<br>
As already explained further above, it is particularly<br>
advantageous if the scrapers have scraper-securing<br>
elements which can be inserted from below into the<br>
insertion pockets and have at their upper side limb<br>
beds for the limbs of the horizontal chain links and<br>
have at their transverse sides a projection which can<br>
be introduced into the grooves. The projection on the<br>
transverse sides of the scraper-securing element then<br>
secures this by positive locking in the grooves in the<br>
insides of the scraper wings or the outsides of the<br>
preferably present intermediate web, as a result of<br>
which the grooves are given a dual function, namely to<br>
bring about, on the one hand, a positive-locking<br>
closure between horizontal chain links and scrapers<br>
and, on the other hand, a positive-locking closure in<br>
the direction of travel of the link chain between the<br>
scraper-securing elements and the scrapers. Moreover,<br>
the projection can preferably comprise a vertical web<br>
with a preferably trapezoidal cross-section which<br>
correspondingly cooperates with grooves in the insides<br>
and outsides on the scraper which likewise have a<br>
trapezoidal cross-section and extend from a groove base<br>
to the surfaces of the insides or outsides on the<br>
scraper.<br>
It is particularly advantageous, in particular for the<br>
mounting of the scraper on the link chain, if the<br>
scraper-securing elements are provided in their base<br><br>
surface with a receiving recess for the screw head of a<br>
fixing screw. It is particularly expedient if the<br>
receiving recess forms a positive-locking anti-twist<br>
device for the screw head since then exclusively a<br>
mounting tool for the nut which can be screwed onto the<br>
shaft of the fixing screw must be placed from above<br>
without the fixing screw having to be fixed by a<br>
locknut. In order to tighten the nut, it is then<br>
sufficient to prevent a rotation of the scraper. The<br>
receiving recess can in particular be formed as a<br>
transverse slot which e.g. receives the screw head of a<br>
hammerhead screw as a fixing screw in a rotationally<br>
fixed manner.<br>
The width of the scraper-securing means can preferably<br>
substantially correspond to the minimum distance of the<br>
bearing zones for the vertical chain links on the front<br>
zones of the head web. Furthermore, the scraper-<br>
securing element can preferably be provided centrally<br>
between both entrainment projections with a raised<br>
portion on the sides of which limb beds for the limbs<br>
of the horizontal chain links are formed. The raised<br>
portion and/or the projection can be provided laterally<br>
with rounded portions for cooperation with the limbs of<br>
the chain links of the link chain, wherein the rounded<br>
portions then preferably run out flat towards the<br>
outside or inside. The raised portion and/or the<br>
projection can, in the case of the horizontal chain<br>
links according to the invention, enclose in inner<br>
eyelets of these chain links and lie on top of one<br>
another there in the mounting status of scrapers,<br>
horizontal chain link and scraper-securing element.<br>
The invention also relates to a scraper-securing<br>
element for securing a scraper on horizontal chain<br>
links of a link chain of a double center scraper chain<br>
conveyor which are inserted into insertion pockets on<br>
the scraper, wherein the base of the scraper-securing<br>
element is provided on its transverse sides with<br><br>
projections for engagement with grooves in the inside<br>
of the scraper wings and the outside of an intermediate<br>
web on the head web of a scraper.<br>
Further advantages and configurations of a scraper<br>
according to the invention including a scraper-securing<br>
device shall become apparent from the following<br>

Fig. 8 shows a chain strand of a link chain in<br>
which the scrapers according to the<br>
invention are preferably used.<br>
The scraper generally designated in the figures by 10<br>
is formed for a relatively wide underground high-<br>
performance scraper chain conveyor in which a link<br>
chain 50 embodied as a double center chain rotates with<br>
two link chain strands 51 formed identically to one<br>
another for conveying the extraction material, in<br>
particular coal. In this case, scrapers 10 according to<br>
the invention are in each case connected at a distance<br>
from one another to horizontal chain links 52 which<br>
have chain fronts 53 with a straight front side 54 as<br>
is already easily apparent from Fig. 1.<br>
Link chain 51 without mounted scrapers is shown in a<br>
top view in Fig. 8 to which reference is made first. In<br>
each case two horizontal chain links 52 formed<br>
identically to one another with front parts 53 having<br>
straight front sides 54 are connected to one another by<br>
means of a vertical chain link 60, which vertical chain<br>
link 60 has a constant cross-sectional profile 61<br>
around the full circumference. Cross-sectional profile<br>
61 of vertical chain links 60 is, around the full<br>
circumference, provided on its outside with a flat<br>
section 62 and embodied on its inside facing an inner<br>
opening with a circular arc-shaped camber 63. Flat<br>
section 62 of cross-sectional profile 61 forms a<br>
transition in each case via bevels 64 into circular<br>
arc-shaped camber 63 and vertical chain links 60 which<br>
are generally relatively small engage with inner<br>
openings 55 of horizontal chain links 52. All<br>
horizontal chain links 52 have limbs 56 which connect<br>
front sections 53 embodied in a rectangular shape on<br>
the front side to one another, and limbs 56 are<br>
provided on their outside with a recess 57 in which,<br>
centrally between both front sections 53, an<br>
entrainment projection 58 protruding into recess 57 is<br><br>
formed with a trapezoidal cross-sectional profile which<br>
serves for improved scraper connection by positive-<br>
locking entrainment of the scrapers. Link chain 51 with<br>
approximately rectangular horizontal chain links 52 and<br>
flat vertical chain links 60 is particularly suitable<br>
for high-performance scraper chain conveyors since, on<br>
the one hand, horizontal chain links 52, during<br>
rotation around a chain wheel, are only subject to low<br>
surface pressures with the pockets of the chain wheel<br>
and, on the other hand, the articulated play between<br>
vertical chain links 60 and horizontal chain links 52<br>
is also improved in particular by bevels 64, as a<br>
result of which the overall wear characteristics of<br>
link chain 51 are minimized. The scraper chain shown in<br>
Fig. 8 forms the subject matter of a separate<br>
application with the same filing date, to which<br>
disclosure reference is made for completion of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
The structure of scrapers 10 embodied for connection to<br>
horizontal chain links 52 will now be explained with<br>
additional reference to Fig. 2 to 7. Each scraper 10<br>
has at its lateral ends two scraper wings 1 which are<br>
integrally connected to one another by means of a head<br>
web 2. Scraper 10 according to the invention preferably<br>
comprises a cast part and front sides 3 of scraper<br>
wings 1, which reach down to underside 8 of scraper 10,<br>
have convex recesses 4 in order to improve the<br>
conveying capacity of scrapers 1 according to the<br>
invention in operational use. The connection of<br>
scrapers 10 to horizontal chain links 52 of double<br>
center chain 50 is performed into insertion pockets 5<br>
below head web 2. Both insertion pockets 5 lying next<br>
to one another are herein divided from one another by<br>
means of a solid, in cross-section trapezoidal<br>
intermediate web 6 whose underside 7 ends flush with<br>
underside 8 of scraper wings 1, as is particularly<br>
apparent from Fig. 6. In order to reduce the weight of<br>
scrapers 10, both scraper wings 1 are provided with<br><br>
cavities 9 open to underside 8, which cavities 9 are<br>
already preferably provided during original shaping of<br>
scraper 10. Each scraper wing 1 has, below head web 2,<br>
an inside 11 which forms one of both lateral<br>
delimitations for insertion pockets 5. The other<br>
lateral delimitation of each insertion pocket 5 is<br>
formed by respective outsides 12 of central web 6.<br>
Insides and outsides 11, 12 diverge slightly, as a<br>
result of which the width of insertion pockets 5<br>
increases towards underside 7 or 8. For positive-<br>
locking anchoring of horizontal chain links 52 having<br>
entrainment projections 58 in insertion pockets 5,<br>
grooves 13 and 14 are formed both in insides 11 of<br>
scraper wings 1 and in outsides 12 of central web 6,<br>
grooves 13 and 14 protruding upwards substantially from<br>
underside 8 of scraper 10 to underside 2' of head web<br>
2. Grooves 13 provided according to the invention in<br>
insides 11 and grooves 14 in the outsides of<br>
intermediate web 6 are particularly apparent from Fig.<br>
1, 4, 5 and 7. Since grooves 13 and 14 run over the<br>
entire height of insertion pockets 5, they extend both<br>
across a region in which a scraper-securing element 40<br>
is received in each insertion pocket 5 as well as<br>
across the region directly below underside 2' of head<br>
web 2 in which limb beds 15 for limbs 56 of horizontal<br>
chain links 52 are formed. Fig. 3 and 4 show herein the<br>
status after and before mounting of horizontal chain<br>
link 52 and of scraper-securing element 40 in insertion<br>
pockets 5. Fig. 3 illustrates that entrainment<br>
projections 58 on horizontal limbs 56 extend to groove<br>
base 13' or 14' of respective grooves 13, 14 such that<br>
the scrapers are therefore fixed in a positive-locking<br>
manner in the direction of movement of the link chain<br>
on horizontal chain links 52. Fig. 1 shows the<br>
positive-locking engagement of entrainment projections<br>
58 with, grooves 13 and 14. Figures 3 and 4 furthermore<br>
illustrate that, between limb beds 15 of each insertion<br>
pocket 5, a conical projection 17 protruding downward<br>
across web head 2 is formed, which projection 17 has<br><br>
laterally trough-shaped recesses 18 as a part of limb<br>
beds 15. The front side of the projection which<br>
coincides with front side 19 of head web 2 is provided<br>
with trough-shaped bearing zones 20 for chain fronts 65<br>
of vertical chain links 60. Therein, in each case, a<br>
bearing zone 20 simultaneously forms a division for<br>
both limb beds 15 of an insertion pocket 5 lying next<br>
to one another. The relatively flat progression, which<br>
is semicircularly cambered across the height of<br>
scrapers 10, of the surface of bearing zones 20 on<br>
which the fronts of vertical chain links 60 flattened<br>
on the outside bear is particularly clearly apparent<br>
from Fig. 2 and 5.<br>
Centrally between both bearing zones 20 which lie<br>
opposite one another, each insertion pocket 5 is<br>
assigned a screw passage 21 passing perpendicularly<br>
through head web 2 which, due to projection 17, reaches<br>
relatively far into insertion pocket 5. On upper side<br>
2' of web head 2, each screw passage 21 opens into a<br>
recess 22 which serves to receive a fixing nut 41, as<br>
Fig. 1 and 2 in particular show. Herein, an<br>
introduction inclination 23 for a detachment tool opens<br>
into each recess 22 in order to detach a potentially<br>
rusted-tight nut 41 from shaft 43' of a fixing screw 43<br>
which fixes scraper-securing element 40 and horizontal<br>
chain link 52 in insertion pocket 5. Fixing screw 43 is<br>
embodied as a cap screw, in particular a hammerhead<br>
screw, whose head 44 engages in a positive-locking<br>
manner with a transverse slot 45 on underside 4 6 of<br>
base 47 of scraper-securing element 40 in a<br>
rotationally fixed manner, while shaft 43' of fixing<br>
screw 43 passes through a bore in scraper-securing<br>
element 40 and through screw passage 21 in head web 2,<br>
in order then to be able to screw fixing nut 41 onto<br>
shaft 43'.<br>
As is in turn particularly apparent from Fig. 3 and 4,<br>
base 47 of scraper-securing element 40 has, at its<br><br>
upper side, a raised section 48 and, at its transverse<br>
sides, in each case a projection 49. Both projections<br>
49 are substantially adapted in terms of cross-section<br>
and width to entrainment projections 58 of horizontal<br>
chain links 52 and to the groove geometry of grooves<br>
13, 14 so that, in the mounted state, projections 49<br>
can likewise enclose on the transverse sides of<br>
scraper-securing element 40 into grooves 13 and 14 on<br>
both sides of insertion pockets 5 in order to support<br>
inserted horizontal chain link 52 downward over its<br>
entire width and prevent tilting movements between<br>
horizontal chain link 52 and scraper 10. Raised section<br>
48 cooperates, in the mounted state of scraper 2, chain<br>
link 52 and scraper-securing element 40, with<br>
projection 17 on the underside of head web 2 and both<br>
engage with inner openings 55 of horizontal chain links<br>
52, as Fig. 2 and 3 in particular illustrate. At the<br>
same time, limb beds 30 whose geometry is substantially<br>
adjusted to the geometry of limb beds 15 on the<br>
underside of head web 2 are formed on the upper side of<br>
scraper-securing elements 40 together with trough-<br>
shaped recesses on both sides of raised section 48. All<br>
limb beds 15 and 30 run out in each case flat to<br>
grooves 13, 14 or to projections 49 in order to achieve<br>
a good interaction and a large-area bearing with limbs<br>
56 of horizontal chain links 52.<br>
The mounting of scrapers 20 on horizontal chain links<br>
52 of the double center chain is particularly<br>
facilitated by the positive-locking fixing of screw<br>
heads 44 of fixing screws 43 since a tool for<br>
tightening or detaching nuts 41 must be put in place<br>
exclusively from above without the fixing screw having<br>
to be fixed by a locknut from the underside. Mounting<br>
can in particular also be performed with an electrical<br>
screwdriver.<br>
Numerous modifications which should fall within the<br>
scope of protection of the attached claims are apparent<br><br>
to the person skilled in the art from the above<br>
description. An exemplary embodiment is not represented<br>
in which only one scraper-securing element is used to<br>
secure both horizontal chain links in the insertion<br>
pockets. In the case of such an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the central web would only reach to the lower height of<br>
the limb beds. An exemplary embodiment is also not<br>
shown of the use of a scraper having only one insertion<br>
pocket on a single center chain.<br><br>
