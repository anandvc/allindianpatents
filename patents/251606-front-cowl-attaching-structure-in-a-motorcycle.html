COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, rule 13]<br>
"FRONT COWL ATTACHING STRUCTURE IN A MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD., a corporation of Japan having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle in which a body frame supports a front cowl made of synthetic resin which 5  is placed in front of a head pipe provided at a front end of the body frame and, more particularly, to an improved attaching structure of the front cowl. [0002] [Prior Art] 10        A motorcycle in which a front cowl is supported by a stay fixed to a body frame is already known according to, for example, a patent document 1 below and the like. [0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1] 15        Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Sho 61-226385 [0004] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, in the conventional motorcycle mentioned above, attaching bosses provided in the front cowl are attached 20 to the stay fixed to the body frame. With this attaching structure, when the stay is extended to a position close to the front cowl, the size of the stay becomes large. When the size of the stay is therefore reduced and the attaching bosses on a front cowl side are elongated to a stay side, there occurs 25 a disadvantage with regard to support strength for the front cowl. In addition, heat sinks are made corresponding to the attaching bosses while forming the front cowl made of synthetic<br><br>
resin, and thereby the appearance of the front cowl can be<br>
degraded.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention was accomplished in the light of 5 the above circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a front cowl attaching structure in a motorcycle, in which miniaturization and weight reduction of a stay on a body frame side is enabled while maintaining support strength thereof, and appearance degradation of a front cowl<br>
10  is prevented. [0006] [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to attain the aforementioned object, in a motorcycle in which a front cowl made of synthetic resin is<br>
15 placed in front of a head pipe, the front cowl being supported by a body frame including the head pipe steserably bearing a front fork, a main frame extending rearward from the head pipe, and a down tube connected to the head pipe under the main frame and extending downward toward the rear, the invention defined in<br>
20 claim 1 is characterized in that the front cowl includes an outer cowl and inner cowls attached to an inner side of the outer cowl, a rear portion of the outer cowl is attached to a fuel tank mounted on the main frame, a front portion of the outer cowl is supported by a head pipe stay fixed to the head pipe through<br>
25  an intervening object, and lower portions of the inner cowls are fixed to a down tube stay fixed to the down tube. [0007]<br>
3<br><br>
According to the above-described construction of the invention defined in claim 1, the front cowl having a hollow-box shape is constructed of the outer cowl and the inner cowls, thus achieving improved rigidity and weight reduction of the front 5 cowl. In addition, the rear portion of the outer cowl is attached to the fuel tank in the front portion of the body frame, and thus it is not required to provide a stay in the body frame in order to support the rear portion of the outer cowl. Further, the rear portion of the outer cowl can be brought into proximity<br>
10  to the fuel tank, and thus it is not required to provide particularly long projections in the rear portion of the outer cowl in order to attach the outer cowl to the fuel tank. Therefore, heat sinks are prevented from being made on the surface of the outer cowl in portions to be attached to the fuel<br>
15  tank, and attaching strength is not deteriorated.  Furthermore, since the front portion of the outer cowl is supported by the head pipe stay fixed to the head pipe through the intervening object,  it is not required to provide particularly long projections in the front portion of the outer cowl in order to<br>
20 be supported by the head pipe stay. Therefore, heat sinks are prevented from being made on the surface in the front portion of the outer cowl, and attaching strength is not deteriorated. Moreover, the lower portions of the inner cowls, attached to the inner side of the outer cowl, are attached to the down tube<br>
25 stay, and thereby the inner cowls can be brought into proximity to the down tube stay without increasing the size of the down tube stay.  Thus, sufficient attaching strength can be ensured<br><br>
while avoiding an increase in the size of the down tube stay. Consequently, the head pipe stay and the down tube stay provided on a body frame side to support the front cowl can be made smaller and lighter while maintaining the support strength thereof, and 5 appearance degradation of the front cowl can also be prevented. [0008]<br>
Moreover, in addition to the construction of the invention defined in claim 1, the invention defined in claim 2 is characterized in that projections extending rearward are<br>
10 provided in a head light serving as the intervening object, and the front portion of the outer cowl is fixed to the* head light attached to the head pipe stay by inserting the projections into the head pipe stay. According to this construction, the head light can be positioned so that the head light can be prevented<br>
15  from swinging right and left by the insertion of the projections into the head pipe stay.  Therefore, the number of spots, in the head light, to be attached to the head pipe stay is reduced, thereby improving assembly workability. [0009]<br>

inner cowls 39....<br>
[0028]<br>
25        A down tube stay 85 is fixed to the down tube 8 in the<br>
body frame 5.  This down tube stay 85 includes an attaching plate<br>
8 6 fastened to a front face of the down tube 8, a support pipe<br><br>
87 extending toward both right and left sides from the attaching plate 86, and support plates 88... respectively fixed to both right and left ends of the support pipe 87. Rubbers 89... having cylindrical metal collars 90... in center portions thereof are 5 attached to both of the support plates 88.... [0029]<br>
Meanwhile, attaching projections 91... extending over the support plates 88... are integrally provided in lower portions of the inner cowls 39... in a protruding manner, and nuts 92...,<br>
10  each having an approximate U-shape, are attached to these attaching projections 91....  Thereafter, washers 93... abutted on the bottom of the rubbers 89... and bolts 94... inserted through the collars 90... are screwed and fastened to the nuts 92....  Thus, the lower portions of the inner cowls 39... are attached to the<br>
15  down tube stay 85 through the rubbers 89.... [0030]<br>
Next, effects of this embodiment are described. The front cowl 31 made of synthetic resin includes the outer cowl 38 and the pair of right and left inner cowls 39... attached to<br>
20  the inner side of the outer cowl 38.  The front cowl 31 is constructed of the outer cowl 38 and the inner cowls 39... to have a hollow-box shape, thereby achieving improved rigidity and weight reduction of the front cowl 31. [0031]<br>
25 In addition, the rear portion of the outer cowl 38 is attached to the fuel tank 23 mounted on the front portion of the body frams 5, that is, on the main frame 7.  Therefore, it<br><br>
is not required to provide a stay in the body frame 5 in order to support the rear portion of the outer cowl 38. Additionally, the rear portion of the outer cowl 38 can be brought into proximity to the fuel tank 23. Therefore, it is not required 5 to provide particularly long projections in the rear portion of the outer cowl 38 in order to attach the outer cowl 38 to the fuel tank 23. Thus, heat sinks can be prevented from being made on the surface of the outer cowl 38 in portions to be attached to the fuel tank 23, and attaching strength is not<br>
10  deteriorated. [0032]<br>
Furthermore, since the front portion of the outer cowl 38 is supported by the head pipe stay 47 fixed to the head pipe 6 through the head light 43, it is not required to provide<br>
15 particularly long projections in the front portion of the outer cowl 38 to be supported by the head pipe stay 47. Thus, heat sinks are prevented from being made on the surface in the front portion of the outer cowl 38, and attaching strength is not deteriorated.<br>
20   [0033]<br>
Further, the lower portions of the inner cowls 39..., attached to the inner side of the outer cowl 38, are attached to the down tube stay 85 fixed to the down tube 8 in the body frame 5.  Therefore, the inner cowls 39... can be brought into<br>
25 proximity to the down tube stay 85 without increasing the size of the down tube stay 85. Thus, sufficient attaching strength can be ensured while avoiding an increase in the size of the<br><br>
down tube stay 85. [0034]<br>
Consequently, the head pipe stay 47 and the down tube stay 85 provided on a body frame 5 side in order to support the front 5 cowl 31 can be made smaller and lighter while maintaining the support strength thereof, and appearance degradation of the front cowl 31 can also be prevented. [0035]<br>
Moreover, the pair of projections 54, 54 extending 10  rearward are provided in the head light 43,  and these projections 54, 54 are inserted into the perforations 55, 55 of the head pipe stay 47 so that the head light 43 is attached to the head pipe stay 47.  Therefore, the head light 43 can be positioned so that the head light 43 is prevented from swinging 15  right and left by the insertion of the projections 54... into the head pipe stay 47 .  Thus, the number of spots, in the head light 43, to be attached to the head pipe stay 47 is reduced, and thereby assembly workability can be improved. [0036] 20        The example of the present invention is described hereinabove.  However, the present invention is not limited to the example described above and various design changes may be made without departing from the present invention as set forth in the scope of claims. 25  [0037]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described in the foregoing, according to the invention<br><br>
defined in claim 1, improved rigidity and weight reduction of<br>
the front cowl can be achieved.  In addition, the head pipe stay<br>
and the down tube stay provided on the body frame side in order<br>
to support the front cowl can be made smaller and lighter while<br>
5  maintaining the support strength thereof.  Thus, appearance<br>
