REDUCED PUFFING NEEDLE COKE FROM DECANT OIL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[OOOl] Carbon electrodes, especially graphite electrodes, are used in the steel<br>
industry to melt both the metals and supplemental ingredients used to form<br>
steel in electrothermal furnaces. The heat needed to melt the substrate metal<br>
is generated by passing current through a plurality of electrodes and forming<br>
an arc between the electrodes and the metal. Currents in excess of 100,000<br>
amperes are often used.<br>
[0002] Electrodes are typically manufactured from needle coke, a grade of<br>
coke having an acicular, anisotropic microstructure. For creating graphite<br>
electrodes that can withstand the ultra-high power throughput, the needle<br>
coke must have a low electrical resisitivity and a low coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion (CTE) while also being able to produce a relatively high-strength<br>
article upon graphitization.<br>
[0003] The specific properties of the needle coke may be dictated through<br>
controlling the properties of the coking process in which an appropriate<br>
carbon feedstock is converted into needle coke. T5T)ically, the grade-level of<br>
needle coke is a function of the CTE over a determined temperature range.<br>
For example, premium needle coke is usually classified as having an average<br>
CTE of from about 0.00 to about 0.30xlO"6/C° over the temperature range of<br>
from about 30°C to about 100°C while regular grade coke has an average CTE<br>
of from about 0.50 to about 5.00xlO"6/C° over the temperature range of from<br>
about 30°C to about 100°C.<br>
[0004] To evaluate the CTE of a coke, it is first calcined to a temperature of<br>
about 1,000 to 1,400°C. It is then admixed with a molten pitch binder and<br>
the pitch/coke mixture is extruded to form a green electrode. The electrode is<br>
then baked to about 800-900°C and then heated from 2,800-3,400°C to effect<br>
graphitization. The CTE is measured on the graphitized electrode using<br>
either a dilatometer or the capacitance method (The capacitance method is<br>
described in a publication "Capacitance Bridge Measurements of Thermal<br>
Expansion" presented at the 1986 International Conference on Carbon at<br>
2<br>
Baden-Baden Germany. The procedure for evaluating coke CTE is found in<br>
publication by E.A. Heintz, Carbon Volume 34, pp. 699-709 (1996), which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).<br>
[0005] In addition to low CTE, a needle coke suitable for production of<br>
graphite electrodes must have a very low content of sulfur and nitrogen.<br>
Sulfur and nitrogen in the coke generally remain after calcination and are<br>
only completely removed during the high temperature graphitization process.<br>
[0006] Needle coke derived from petroleum is produced using a decant oil<br>
feedstock. The decant oil is the residual fraction from catalytic treating of a<br>
petroleum (gas oil) distillate. It is usually common to utilize a treatment with<br>
hydrogen and a catalyst to treat the decant oil or precursor distillate to<br>
remove the sulfur and reduce the effective puffing of the coke. However, such<br>
treatments have only a very limited effect on the removal of nitrogen. High<br>
levels of nitrogen in the decant oil will result in coke puffing during<br>
graphitization.<br>
[0007] If the needle coke contains too high a concentration of nitrogen and<br>
sulfur, the electrode will experience "puffing" upon graphitization. Puffing is<br>
the irreversible expansion of the electrode which creates cracks or voids<br>
within the electrode, diminishing the electrode's structural integrity as well<br>
as drastically altering both its strength and density.<br>
[0008] The degree of puffing generally correlates to the percentage of nitrogen<br>
and sulfur present in the needle coke. Both the nitrogen and sulfur atoms<br>
are bonded to the carbon within the feedstock through covalent bonding<br>
t5T)ically in a ring arrangement. The nitrogen-carbon and sulfur-carbon<br>
bonding is considerably less stable than carbon-carbon bonding in high<br>
temperature environments and will rupture upon heating. This bond rupture<br>
results in the rapid evolution of nitrogen and sulfur containing gases during<br>
high temperature heating, resulting in the physical puffing of the needle coke.<br>
Another source of puffing may be the rupture of sulfur to sulfur bonds.<br>
[0009] A variety of methods have been attempted to reduce the puffing of<br>
needle coke during the graphitization process, with most directed to the<br>
effects of sulfur. The approaches used involve either treating the needle coke<br>
3<br>
feedstock with a catalyst and hydrogen to remove sulfur prior to coking or to<br>
introduce chemical additives to the coke which inhibit the puffing process.<br>
[OOIO] One such approach has been the use of an inhibitor additive to either<br>
the initial feedstock or the coke mixture prior to the graphitization to an<br>
electrode body. U.S Patent No. 2,814,076 teaches of the addition of an alkali<br>
metal salt to inhibit the puffing. Such salts are added immediately prior to<br>
graphitizing an electrode. Notably, sodium carbonate is added by<br>
impregnating the article through a sodium carbonate solution.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent No. 4,312,745 also describes the use of an additive to<br>
reduce the puffing of sulfur-containing coke. Iron compounds, such as iron<br>
oxide are added to the sulfur-containing feedstock with the coke being<br>
produced through the delayed-coking process. However, the use of such<br>
inhibitors can be detrimental to the coke, one such effect is an increase in the<br>
CTE of the coke.<br>
[0012] Orac et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,118,287) discloses the addition of an<br>
alkali or alkaline earth metal to the coke at a temperature level above that<br>
where the additive reacts with the carbon but below the puffing threshold to<br>
thereby preclude puffing.<br>
[0013]Jager (U.S. Patent No. 5,104,518) describes the use of sulphonate,<br>
carboxylate or phenolate of an alkaline earth metal to a coal tar prior to the<br>
coking step to reduce nitrogen puffing in the 1400°C-2000°C temperature<br>
range. Jager et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,068,026) describes using the same<br>
additives to a coke/pitch mixture prior to baking and graphitization, again to<br>
reduce nitrogen-based puffing.<br>
[0014] Other attempts have been made to preclude the puffing of electrodes<br>
through the use of carbon additives or various hydro-removal techniques. In<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,814,063, Murakami et al. describes the creation of an<br>
improved needle coke through the hydrogenation of the starting stock in the<br>
presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. Subsequently, the hydrogenated<br>
product undergoes thermal cracking with the product being cut into different<br>
fractions. In Japan Patent Publication 59-122585, Kaji et al. describes<br>
hydrorefining a pitch in the presence of a hydrogenating catalyst to remove<br>
4<br>
nitrogen and sulfur, followed by coking of the pitch to give a reduced puffing<br>
needle coke.<br>
[0015]Goval et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,286,371) teaches of passing a feedstock<br>
through a hydrotreating reaction zone to produce a hydrotreated residual<br>
product wherein the product can undergo a solvent extraction process.<br>
[0016]Didchenko et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,167,796) teaches the use of a large<br>
pore size hydrotreating catalyst with hydrogen to remove sulfur from a<br>
petroleum decant oil prior to coking.<br>
[0017] Unfortunately, needle coke produced by the prior art usually fails to<br>
address the problems of nitrogen remaining in the needle coke that is to be<br>
graphitized into an electrode. The additives used to reduce the puffing<br>
characteristics of needle coke counteract the sulfur components which would<br>
otherwise be liberated from the needle coke but fail to preclude puffing<br>
resulting from the nitrogen components.<br>
[0018] What is desired, therefore, is a process for producing reduced puffing<br>
needle coke which does not require the use of puffing inhibitor additives.<br>
Indeed, a process which is superior in removing nitrogen from a feedstock for<br>
the production of needle coke which will be graphitized to an electrode article<br>
has been found to be necessary for producing high strength, reduced-puffing<br>
electrodes. Also desired is the inventive reduced-puffing needle coke with<br>
reduced nitrogen content for the production of graphite electrodes.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The present invention provides a process which is uniquely capable of<br>
reducing the nitrogen content of a decant oil feedstock for creating reducedpuffing<br>
needle coke. The inventive process provides a method where neither<br>
additives nor high temperature hydrogenation steps are necessary to remove<br>
the nitrogen from the decant oil feedstock in the process of making needle<br>
coke. Such reduced-puffing needle coke resists expansion during<br>
graphitization and provides electrode articles with improved density and<br>
strength characteristics, a combination of needle coke characteristics not<br>
heretofore seen. In addition, the inventive process for producing needle coke<br>
5<br>
provides a reduced-puffing needle coke from decant oil without the excessive<br>
expenditures of both hydrogen and thermal energy.<br>
[0020] More particularly, the inventive process reduces the nitrogen present<br>
in the decant oil feedstock by means of a nitrogen removal system. The<br>
nitrogen removal system comprises an adsorption separator where the<br>
nitrogen components can be removed from the decant oil feedstock. Such<br>
nitrogen removal systems allow for the entering decant oil feedstock stream<br>
to have a nitrogen content of from about 0.3% by weight to about 2% by<br>
weight and will produce a final calcined needle coke product having a<br>
nitrogen content of from about 0.03% to about 0.2% by weight. An important<br>
characteristic of this inventive process is the ability for the nitrogen removal<br>
process to function throughout a wide range of temperatures. Specifically the<br>
nitrogen removal system can function at ambient conditions as well as the<br>
standard temperatures required for the flow of a decant oil feed stock. For<br>
the removal of nitrogen, the decant oil feedstock can flow through a variety of<br>
system designs, including absorption beds and multiple columns arranged for<br>
the continuous treatment of the decant oil feedstock while one column is<br>
offline.<br>
[0021] The inventive nitrogen removal system for producing reduced puffing<br>
needle coke carbon should use a nitrogen removal method which can operate<br>
without the addition of excessive thermal energy or hydrogen gas to facilitate<br>
nitrogen removal firom the decant oil feedstock. The nitrogen removal system<br>
may include an activated carbon article as the primary nitrogen removal<br>
element of the nitrogen removal system. The activated carbon article acts to<br>
bind and physically remove the nitrogen containing components from the<br>
decant oil feedstock as the feedstock passes through the nitrogen removal<br>
system.<br>
[0022] Alternatively, the nitrogen removal system may contain other suitable<br>
adsorbent materials including activated carbon fibers, activated alumina,<br>
silica gel, silica alumina and xeolites, which can optimally reduce the<br>
nitrogen content of the feedstock from about 0.03% to about 0.2% by weight.<br>
6<br>
[0023] In addition, it has been found highly advantageous to have a<br>
restoration system for the nitrogen removal system. The restoration system<br>
acts to regenerate the removal properties of the nitrogen removal system,<br>
through the disengagement of the nitrogen from the removal system. In<br>
nitrogen removal systems incorporating an activated carbon structure, the<br>
restoration system removes the nitrogen containing components from the<br>
internal pore system of the activated carbon. Alternatively, in nitrogen<br>
removal systems incorporating a alumina or siUca-based adsorbents, the<br>
restoration system removes the nitrogen components from the active<br>
adsorption sites, freeing the active sites for future nitrogen adsorption.<br>
[0024] The decant oil feedstock fed into the nitrogen removal column should<br>
be relatively free from ash as ash components may preclude needle coke<br>
formation with a low coefficient of thermal expansion.<br>
[0025] After the decant oil feedstock exits the nitrogen removal column, the<br>
feedstock enters a hydrodesulfurization unit for the removal of excess sulfur<br>
existing in the decant oil. Hydrodesulfurization, as known to those skilled in<br>
the art, is a common method of utilizing a hydrogen feed stream and catalyst<br>
to remove sulfur components from a petroleum based product.<br>
[0026] Subsequent to the hydrodesulfurization, the decant oil enters a delayed<br>
coking unit for the conversion of treated decant oil feedstock to needle coke.<br>
Delayed coking, as known in the art, is the thermal cracking process in which<br>
the liquid decant oil feedstock is converted into the solid needle coke. The<br>
delayed coking of the reduced puffing decant oil feedstock should be a batchcontinuous,<br>
or semi continuous, process where multiple needle coke drums<br>
are utilized so that one drum is always being filled with feedstock.<br>
[0027] An object of the invention, therefore, is a process for creating reduced<br>
puffing needle coke to be employed in applications such as production of<br>
graphite electrodes.<br>
[0028] Another object of the invention is a process for creating reduced puffing<br>
needle coke having a nitrogen reducing system incorporating activated carbon<br>
as a nitrogen adsorbing agent.<br>
7<br>
[0029] Still another object of the invention a process for creating reduced<br>
puffing needle coke having a nitrogen reducing system incorporating an<br>
alumina or silica-containing adsorbent for the removal of nitrogen from the<br>
decant oil feedstock.<br>
[0030] Yet another object of the invention is a reduced puffing coke which<br>
contains substantially less nitrogen and exhibits very little or no expansion<br>
upon graphitization.<br>
[0031] These aspects and others that will become apparent to the artisan upon<br>
review of the following description can be accomplished by providing a decant<br>
oil feedstock having an average nitrogen content of from about 0.3% to about<br>
2% by weight and treating the decant oil feedstock with the nitrogen removal<br>
system under relatively mild conditions at temperatures no greater than<br>
140°C. The inventive process advantageously reduces the nitrogen content of<br>
the decant oil feedstock from about 0.03% to about 0.2% by weight allowing<br>
the feedstock to be converted into reduced-puffing needle coke.<br>
[0032] The inventive process can utihze a nitrogen removal system with a<br>
variety of adsorbing agents, especially activated carbon, as well as activated<br>
alumina, sihca gel, silica alumina and xeohtes. Such additives are readily<br>
available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemical Co. and have been<br>
used for chromatographic separations and for separating heterocychcs from<br>
petroleum-derived diesel oil (Y. Sano et al.. Fuel 84, 903 (2005)).<br>
[0033] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and<br>
the following detailed description provide embodiments of the invention and,<br>
when read in light of the attached drawing, are intended to provide an<br>
overview or framework of understanding to nature and character of the<br>
invention as it is claimed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0034] Fig. 1 is a schematic flow-diagram of the process to produce reduced<br>
pufiing needle coke from a decant oil feedstock.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0035] Reduced-puffing needle coke is prepared from fluid catalytic cracking<br>
decant oil, which contains up to about 0.4% by weight of ash. Ash is typically<br>
8<br>
known as contaminant of a noncarbonaceous nature with a range of particle<br>
size. Typical ash components in decant oil are catalyst particles remaining<br>
from the cracking process used in producing the decant oil. In producing<br>
needle coke, the ash content should be reduced as excess ash results in an<br>
increase of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the final needle coke<br>
product.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Figure 1, ash-containing decant oil 10 flows into the<br>
ash-reduction system 12 for the removal of a significant portion of ash. As<br>
known to those skilled in the art, ash sohds can be removed from decant oil<br>
through a variety of methods. These methods include a filtration system<br>
wherein the decant oil is passed through a membrane filter or a high-speed<br>
centrifugation system wherein centrifugal force is used to separate out the<br>
ash. An additional method involves the utiUzation of high voltage electric<br>
fields which polarize the ash particles allowing them to be captured from the<br>
decant oil. Initial decant oil 10 can have an ash content of from about 0.1% to<br>
0.4% by weight prior to the treatment by the ash-reduction system 12.<br>
Through treatment by the ash-reduction system 12 utilizing one or more of<br>
the above methods, ash-reduced decant oil 14 will have a ash percentage by<br>
weight of less than about 0.01%, more preferably below about 0.006%, most<br>
preferably below about 0.003%.<br>
[0037] Upon treatment by the ash-reduction system 12, the ash-reduced<br>
decant oil 14 is directed toward the nitrogen removal system 16. As is<br>
necessary for the specific nitrogen removal system 16, the ash-reduced decant<br>
oil 14 can be heated or cooled to facilitate the best possible removal of<br>
nitrogen components during the processing within the nitrogen removal<br>
system 16. Specifically, slight heating can be utilized to decrease the<br>
viscosity of the decant oil and provide better contact between the oil and the<br>
reactive surfaces within the nitrogen removal system, however! such heating<br>
is not required for proper activity of the nitrogen removal system.<br>
[0038] In one embodiment the nitrogen removal system 16 comprises a<br>
column loaded with nitrogen removing material. The column arrangement<br>
may include one or more columns in a parallel arrangement. Multiple<br>
9<br>
columns are ideal so that when one goes off line, nitrogen removal system 16<br>
can still be continuously operated.<br>
[0039] In one alternative, the separation columns within the nitrogen removal<br>
system are of the fixed-bed (static) type. In these reactors the nitrogenremoving<br>
material is fixed and the column must be taken off line from decant<br>
oil processing to remove or regenerate the nitrogen-removing material. In<br>
another alternative, the columns within the nitrogen removal system are of<br>
the moving bed type. In moving bed type systems, the unit contains a<br>
fluidized bed of nitrogen removing material wherein the material is<br>
continuously removed and added to maintain desired activity of the nitrogen<br>
removal system.<br>
[0040] One type of nitrogen removing material is activated carbon, carbon<br>
that has been treated to possess a ramified pore system throughout the<br>
carbon structure, resulting in a large internal specific surface area.<br>
Specifically, the activated carbon in the nitrogen removal system 16 can have<br>
a surface area in excess of 200m2/g, with upper limits up to and above about<br>
3000 m2/g. Such activated carbon for the nitrogen removal system 16, can be<br>
created from a variety of organic sources, including, but not limited to<br>
hardwoods, coal and coke products, cellulosic materials and polymer resins.<br>
Additionally, the activated carbon can be activated carbon fibers, rather than<br>
typical activated carbon in granular formation. Tjrpically the activated<br>
carbon will have a trimodal pore distribution of micropores, mesopores, and<br>
macropores, with the pore size ranging from less than 2 nanometers for<br>
micropores to greater than 50 nm for macropores.<br>
[0041] The primary means of removing nitrogen components from the ashreduced<br>
decant oil within nitrogen removal system 16 is through adsorption<br>
by activated carbon . The two primary physical considerations of the<br>
activated carbon to consider in best selecting activated carbon for the<br>
adsorption of nitrogen components from a decant oil are the total surface area<br>
and pore structure. A large total surface of the activated carbon permits the<br>
availability of more active sites for the interaction with nitrogen components<br>
of ash-reduced decant oil 14. Furthermore, both the macropores and the<br>
10<br>
mesopores of the activated carbon provide mechanical exclusion of particles<br>
from becoming adsorbed within the ramified pore system of the activated<br>
carbon, while allowing smaller molecules to the inner micropores. The pore<br>
size physically limits the particular size of the molecule which can reach the<br>
inner micropores of the activated carbon and thus be removed from ashreduced<br>
decant oil 14. The nitrogen containing components, within ashreduced<br>
decant oil 14, are sufficiently small in molecular size to reach the<br>
micropores of the activated carbon and become trapped and thereby removed<br>
from ash-reduced decant oil 14.<br>
[0041] While any form of activated carbon is effective at nitrogen removal in<br>
accordance with the present invention, pH-neutral activated carbon has been<br>
found to be especially effective. In addition, in another embodiment of the<br>
use of activated carbon in nitrogen removal system 16, acid-washed (or<br>
partially neutralized) activated carbon or activated carbon with surface<br>
functional groups having high nitrogen affinity is employed, either in<br>
substitution for pH-neutral activated carbon, or in combination therewith.<br>
Reference herein to "activated carbon" refers to activated carbons generally or<br>
to any or all of pH-neutral activated carbon, acid-washed or partially<br>
neutralized activated carbon, activated carbon with surface functional groups,<br>
or combinations thereof<br>
[0042] The use of acid-washed or partially neutralized activated carbon may<br>
be more effective at the removal of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
compounds (typically Lewis bases) from decant oil. The acid-washed or<br>
partially neutralized activated carbon would have additional acidic functional<br>
groups as compared with pH-neutral activated carbon, which can make<br>
bonding interactions with nitrogen-containing species more likely. Activated<br>
carbons having surface functional groups with high nitrogen affinity, such as<br>
those impregnated with metals such as NiCb, can more effectively form<br>
metal-complexes with nitrogen species and so trap the nitrogen compounds<br>
within the carbon.<br>
[0043] An additional component of nitrogen removal system 16 is the<br>
structural elements which maintain the activated carbon while ash-reduced<br>
11<br>
decant oil 14 passes through the bed. Tj^jical to adsorption with activated<br>
carbon, the activated carbon may require a substantial retention time with<br>
the ash-reduced decant oil 14 for the removal of nitrogen. Ash-reduced<br>
decant oil 14 may be in contact with the activated carbon on the order of<br>
hours to adequately remove nitrogen from the feedstock. To make possible<br>
the immobility of the activated carbon, a fixed bed type column is a preferred<br>
embodiment, as this style is commonly used for the adsorption from liquids.<br>
In an additional embodiment, the activated carbon can be housed in a moving<br>
bed column wherein the activated carbon is slowly withdrawn as it becomes<br>
spent.<br>
[0044] For the optimgd removal of nitrogen from ash-reduced decant oil 14 by<br>
the nitrogen removal system 16, processing parameters can be designed for<br>
best reaction conditions between the activated carbon and the decant oil. As<br>
adsorption usually increases with decreasing temperature, ash-reduced<br>
decant oil 14 can be fed into nitrogen removal system 16 at the lowest<br>
temperature consistent with adequate flow of the decant oil. Furthermore,<br>
the pH can optionally be altered to also facihtate better adsorption, t5T)ically<br>
allowing the nitrogen within the ash-reduced decant oil 14 to be in a more<br>
adsorbable condition.<br>
[0045] Other process considerations include the time in which the decant oil is<br>
in contact with the activated carbon. Adsorption is also dependent upon the<br>
total time in which the nitrogen components are able to be in contact with the<br>
activated carbon. Therefore, increasing contact time between the activated<br>
carbon and the decant oil allows for a greater proportion of the nitrogen to be<br>
removed. Methods of increasing contact time include reducing the flow rate<br>
of the decant oil, increasing the amount of activated carbon within the bed, or<br>
providing activated carbon with a greater surface area.<br>
[0046] Upon diminished performance of the adsorption of nitrogen from ashreduced<br>
decant oil 14, the activated carbon component may be either<br>
discarded or reactivated for continued use. Depending on the costs of thermal<br>
energy and the current price of activated carbon, economics might dictate the<br>
disposal of the activated carbon and the deposit of fresh activated carbon<br>
12<br>
within the beds of nitrogen removal system 16. If nitrogen removal system 16<br>
includes one or more moving bed columns, the activated carbon can<br>
continuously be drawn off as the catalyst becomes spent. Otherwise, the<br>
system can be shut down and the activated carbon can be removed in a batchwise<br>
fashion.<br>
[0047] In a further alternative, the activated carbon of the nitrogen removal<br>
system 16 can undergo regeneration where the activated carbon is<br>
significantly freed of adsorbed nitrogen components. In one embodiment, the<br>
spent carbon is allowed to flow from nitrogen removal system 16 to the<br>
regeneration unit 20 via connection 18. Possible mechanisms for travel of the<br>
activated carbon from nitrogen removal system 16 to regeneration unit 20<br>
include either a gravity-induced flow or a pressurized flow arrangement for<br>
transport of the spent activated carbon to regeneration unit 20. Upon<br>
regeneration, the activated carbon can flow backing the nitrogen removal<br>
system 16 via connection 22. Alternatively, the static bed containing the<br>
spent activated carbon can be completely taken off line and the spent<br>
activated carbon can be removed in a batch-wise fashion and inserted into the<br>
regeneration system 20.<br>
[0048] In one embodiment of the regeneration system 20, the nitrogen<br>
removal system utilizes a thermal regeneration technique to reactivate the<br>
spent activated carbon. Specifically, the regeneration unit may include a<br>
furnace or rotary kiln arrangement for the thermal vaporization of adsorbents<br>
on the activated carbon. Typical temperatures for vaporizing the absorbed<br>
molecules can range from about 400°C up to about 1000°C. In one<br>
embodiment, the absorbed molecules are vaporized at a temperature of no<br>
more than about 900°C. In another embodiment, the temperature may range<br>
from about 400°C up to about 600°C. In a further embodiment, the<br>
temperature may range from about 700°C to about 1000°C. Alternatively, the<br>
spent activated carbon can be stripped by steam for the removal of<br>
contaminants. In steam stripping regeneration the temperature of the steam<br>
can vary from about 100°C up to about 900°C for the removal of most<br>
adsorbents.<br>
13<br>
[0049] With the above regeneration techniques the activated carbon will<br>
eventually have to be replaced as the thermal regeneration techniques as well<br>
as the steam regeneration techniques, oxidize a portion of the activated<br>
carbon each time. For instance, approximately 10% by weight of the<br>
activated carbon can be lost during each thermal regeneration while about 5%<br>
by weight of the activated carbon is lost when utilizing steam regeneration<br>
techniques.<br>
[0050] In an alternative embodiment of the nitrogen removal system 16, a<br>
variety of inorganic adsorbents can used in a column type arrangement to<br>
function as nitrogen removal system at temperatures much lower than prior<br>
art processes, preferably under temperature and other conditions which are<br>
lower than prior art processes, and more preferably at or about ambient<br>
conditions or lower. The adsorbent can be of a variety of high surface<br>
inorganic materials, including preferably activated alumina as amorphous<br>
alumina, silica alumina, titania, zirconia, silica gel, charged silica, zeolite,<br>
and a variety of high surface area active metal oxides including those of<br>
nickel, copper, iron and so on. These adsorbents with their high surface<br>
areas provide a large number of active sites for the removal of nitrogen<br>
components from the decant oil.<br>
[0051] Specifically, gamma alumina can have a surface area of from about 1<br>
m2/g to over 100 rnVg, is quite rigid and can be formed in a variety of shapes<br>
for placement within the nitrogen removal system 16. These shapes include a<br>
variety of sized pellets, honeycomb, helical, and a variety of polygonal<br>
arrangements typical for fixed bed reactors.<br>
[0052] Such type of adsorbent materials are used in analytical separations<br>
such as chromatography. Active alumina adsorbents have also been used for<br>
separation of heterocyclic compounds from diesel oil. (Y. Sano et al., Fuel 84,<br>
903 (2005)).<br>
[0053] Similar to activated carbon, inorganic adsorbents such as activated<br>
alumina can also be recycled as its disposal would be quite costly in the<br>
production of reduced-puffing needle coke. Larger contaminants can be<br>
removed through a steam stripping process wherein the adsorbent material is<br>
14<br>
exposed to steam in a temperature range of from about 100°C to about 500°C,<br>
however if desired, the temperature may be greater than 500°C, and a<br>
pressure of from about 10 psig to about 50 psig. Any contaminants not<br>
removed can be removed through a subsequent thermal treatment to<br>
regenerate the adsorption activity. The thermal treatment process includes<br>
temperatures in the range of from about 500°C to about 900°C. Total<br>
processing time for regeneration is dependant upon the selected thermal<br>
treatment temperature allowing the user to optimize the regeneration specific<br>
to the overall needle coke production process. Over repeated regenerations,<br>
the adsorbent will lose activity and require its replacement or reconstruction.<br>
[0054] Upon exiting the nitrogen removal system 16, treated decant oil 24 is<br>
directed to the to the hydrodesulfurization unit. Nitrogen-reduced decant oil<br>
24 exits nitrogen removal system 16 and enters hydrodesulfurization unit 26<br>
for the removal of sulfur from the nitrogen-reduced decant oil 24. As sulfur is<br>
a major cause of puffing among graphite electrodes produced from decant oil,<br>
the sulfur content must be significantly reduced prior to coking the decant oil.<br>
Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a process where the sulfur compounds are<br>
reacted with hydrogen gas in the presence of some catalyst, usually at<br>
elevated temperatures. HDS is a well known art in the art and used<br>
extensively in producing coke from high-sulfur containing feedstocks.<br>
Examples of desulfurization include U.S. Patent No. 2,703,780, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 3,891,538, U.S. Patent No 4,075,084, and U.S. Patent No. 5,167,796. A<br>
practitioner of the art would be able to tailor the degree of hydrogenation for<br>
decant oil to reduce the amount of sulfur by weight to below 0.5%, preferably<br>
below 0.25%, most preferably below 0.1%.<br>
[0055] After the reduction of sulfur of the decant oil by hydrodesulfurization<br>
unit 26, the desulfurized decant oil is directed to coking unit 28. A variety of<br>
methods exist for coking a decant oil feedstock, with delayed coking being the<br>
most common method for creating needle coke. A standard delayed coking<br>
unit preferably comprises two or more needle coke drums operated in a batchcontinuous<br>
process. Typically, one portion of the drums is filled with decant<br>
oil while the other portion of the drums undergoes thermal processing.<br>
15<br>
[0056] Prior to a needle coke drum being filled, the drum is preheated by<br>
thermal gases recirculated from the coking occurring in the other set of<br>
needle coke drums. The heated drums are then filled with preheated decant<br>
oil feedstock wherein the liquid feedstock is injected into the bottom portion of<br>
the drum and begins to boil. With both the temperature and pressure of the<br>
coking drum increasing, the Uquid feedstock becomes more and more viscous.<br>
The coking process occurs at temperatures of from about 400°C to about<br>
550°C, preferably 425-525, and more preferably 450-500, and pressures from<br>
about ambient up to about 100 psig. Slowly, the viscosity of the decant oil<br>
increases and begins to form needle coke.<br>
[0057] The coke produced by the aforementioned process is then calcined at<br>
temperatures up to or about 1400°C. The calcined reduced puffing needle<br>
coke preferably has a CTE below about 2.0 cm/cmA'C*10'^, more preferably<br>
below about 1.25 cm/cm/'C*10'^, and most preferably below about 1.0<br>
cm/cm/°C*10"'^. Furthermore, the calcined reduced puffing needle coke has<br>
less than about 0.2% by weight, more typically about 0.1% by weight, and<br>
most preferably less than 0.03% by weight nitrogen content while having less<br>
than about 1.0% by weight sulfur content, and the needle coke exhibits very<br>
little nitrogen-induced physical expansion during graphitization to<br>
temperatures well above 2000°C.<br>
[0058] Also disclosed herein is a method of creating reduced puffing needle<br>
coke. The method includes a) passing decant oil through an activated carbon<br>
nitrogen removal system to produce reduced nitrogen decant oil; b)<br>
hydrodesulfurizing the reduced nitrogen decant oil to create low-sulfur,<br>
reduced nitrogen decant oiL' c) coking the low-sulfur, reduced nitrogen decant<br>
oil; and d) calcining the coke obtained from step (c) to create reduced puffing<br>
needle coke. The activated carbon nitrogen removal system may include<br>
activated carbon with a surface area of from about 200 m2/g to about 3000<br>
m2/g. The activated carbon may be in the form of activated carbon fibers.<br>
Additionally, the activated carbon may have surface functional groups.<br>
Furthermore, the activated carbon may be impregnated. The activated<br>
carbon nitrogen removal system may comprise one or more columns; the<br>
16<br>
column may be a fixed-bed t5T)e or moving-bed type. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the activated carbon nitrogen removal system may further<br>
comprise a regeneration unit; a preferred regeneration unit utilizes steam<br>
regeneration at a temperature of at least about 100°C.<br>
[0059] Further disclosed is another method of creating reduced puffing needle<br>
coke. This method includes a) removing ash from decant oil to create ashreduced<br>
decant oil; b) passing the ash-reduced decant oil through an<br>
adsorption zone to produce reduced nitrogen decant oil; c) coking the lowsulfur,<br>
reduced nitrogen decant oil; and d) calcining the coke obtained fi:om<br>
step (c) to create reduced puffing needle coke. The adsorption zone of step (b)<br>
may include a support impregnated with a catalyst. A preferred support is<br>
activated alumina. The adsorption zone may further comprise a regeneration<br>
unit; a preferred regeneration unit may include steam stripping of the<br>
contaminants from the adsorbent. Alternatively, the regeneration unit may<br>
include thermal stripping of the contaminants from the adsorbent.<br>
[0060] Without intending to limit the scope of the invention, the<br>
following examples demonstrate the advantages of the practice of the present<br>
invention in removing nitrogen from a decant oil.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0061] A 20 cubic centimeter (cc) sample of decant oil having a nitrogen<br>
content of 1857 parts per million (ppm) is diluted with toluene at a 1:1 ratio<br>
by volume, and blended with an absorbent. The absorbent is an activated<br>
carbon commercially available from Kansai Coke &amp; Chemical Co. having a<br>
surface area of 2700 square meters per gram (m^/g) and pore volume of 1.31<br>
milliliters per gram (ml/g). Before the adsorption experiment, the adsorbent is<br>
pretreated under vacuum at 80°C in order to remove water and other<br>
contaminants, which might inhibit the adsorption of nitrogen compounds.<br>
The decant oil/toluene blend is heated to 100°C to have sufficient fluidity and<br>
is then blended with adsorbent at an oil/adsorbent weight ratio of 5^1, and<br>
maintained for 2 hours. After adsorption, the treated decant oil is separated<br>
from adsorbent and toluene is removed by evaporation under N2 flow. The<br>
treated decant oil is found to have a nitrogen content of 1541 ppm, a decrease<br>
17<br>
of 17%.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0062] In order to remove further nitrogen compounds, two-stage adsorption<br>
experiments are performed at the same adsorption conditions. The decant oil<br>
produced in Example 1 is separated from the adsorbent, and then<br>
immediately mixed with fresh activated carbon for second stage adsorption.<br>
The second stage adsorption is also performed at 100°C for 2 hours. The<br>
resulting decant oil is found to have a nitrogen content of 1168 ppm, a 37%<br>
decrease from the original sample.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0063] A 20 cubic centimeter (cc) sample of decant oil having a nitrogen<br>
content of 1990 parts per million (ppm) is blended with one of two absorbents.<br>
One of the absorbents is an activated carbon commercially available as<br>
Nuchar SA-20 from Westvaco, having a surface area of 1843 square meters<br>
per gram (m2/g) and an average pore size of 28.6 angstroms. The other<br>
absorbent is an acidic activated alumina commercially available from Aldrich<br>
Chemical Co., having a gamma crystalline phase with a surface area of 155<br>
m2/g and an average pore size of 58 angstroms. Before the adsorption<br>
experiment, the adsorbents are pretreated under vacuum at 80°C in order to<br>
remove water and other contaminants, which might inhibit the adsorption of<br>
nitrogen compounds. The decant oil is heated to 140°C to have sufficient<br>
fluidity and is then blended with adsorbent at an oil/adsorbent weight ratio of<br>
5:1, and maintained for 2 hours. After adsorption, the treated decant oil is<br>
separated from adsorbent. The decant oil treated with activated carbon is<br>
found to have a nitrogen content of 1617 ppm, a decrease of 18.8%; the<br>
decant oil treated with activated alumina is found to have a nitrogen content<br>
of 1707 ppm, a decrease of 14.2%.<br>
[0064] Based on the results shown in Examples 1-3, the inventive adsorption<br>
process at mild operating conditions (low temperature and pressure) can<br>
significantly reduce the nitrogen concentration in decant oil, resulting in the<br>
production of improved needle coke feedstock.<br>
