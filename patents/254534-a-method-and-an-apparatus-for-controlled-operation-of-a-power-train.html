CONTROL ARCHITECTURE AND METHOD FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL<br>
OPTIMIZATION OF INPUT TORQUE AND MOTOR TORQUE IN FIXED GEAR FOR A<br>
HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for powertrain<br>
control systems employing electro-mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices.<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to a vehicle drivelinc. One such<br>
transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, typically an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the<br>
vehicle driveline. Electrical machines, operatively connected to an electrical<br>
energy storage device, comprise motor/generators operable to generate motive<br>
torque for input to the transmission, independently of torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electrical machines are further operable to<br>
transform vehicle kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline. to<br>
electrical energy potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage<br>
device. A control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the<br>
operator and provides operational control of the powertrain system, including<br>
controlling transmission gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative<br><br>
2<br>
devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical<br>
energy storage device and the electrical machines.<br>
[0003] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear modes and continuously variable modes through<br>
actuation of the torque-transfer clutches, typically employing a hydraulic<br>
circuit to effect clutch actuation. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational<br>
speed of the transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of<br>
the input member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more<br>
torque-transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when<br>
rotational speed of the transmission output member is variable based upon<br>
operating speeds of one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines<br>
can be connected to the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct<br>
connection. Clutch actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a<br>
hydraulic circuit.<br>
[0004] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions are tasked with implementing control schemes to<br>
monitor system states and control operation of various systems and actuators<br>
to effectively control powertrain operation. Such a system is described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and an<br>
apparatus are provided to control operation of a powertrain system comprising<br>
a torque transmission device operative to transmit torque input from a plurality<br>
of torque-generative devices.<br><br>
3<br>
[0006] The method is directed to identify preferred operating conditions for<br>
operating the powertrain in a fixed gear operating range state. The exemplary<br>
powertrain comprises an internal combustion engine and first and second<br>
electrical machines and an electro-mechanical transmission selectively<br>
operative to transmit torque therebetween. The method comprises determining<br>
a range of permissible input torques and motor torques input from the first<br>
electrical machine to the transmission, and determining a plurality of motor<br>
torques input from the second electrical machines based thereupon. A<br>
plurality of costs are determined, with each cost based upon the range of input<br>
torques and the motor torques for the first and second electrical machines<br>
determined thereupon. A preferred input torque and a preferred motor torque<br>
is identified based upon the determined costs.<br>
[0007] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>

[0011] Fig. 3 is a graphical depiction, in accordance with the present<br>
invention; and,<br>
[0012] Figs. 4 - 9 are schematic flowcharts, in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose oflimiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0014] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953.409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios', which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode.<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12<br>
having an input speed, N, that is preferably driven by the internal combustion<br>
engine 14. The engine 14 has a crankshaft having characteristic speed NK<br>
which is operatively connected to the transmission input shaft 12. When a<br>
clutch device (not shown) operatively connects the engine and transmission,<br>
the engine speed NE and output torque TE can differ from transmission input<br>
speed N, and input torque T,.<br><br>
5<br>
[0015] The transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28.<br>
and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e.. clutches CI 70, C2 62. C3 73. and<br>
C4 75. An electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br>
transmission control module 17, is operative to control actuation and<br>
deactivation of the clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-actuated rotating friction clutches. Clutches CI and C3<br>
preferably comprise comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices<br>
grounded to the transmission case 68.<br>
[0016] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined to an outer gear member of the second planetary gear<br>
set 26, and connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, referred to as MG-A.<br>
[0017] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60. to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through clutch C2 62. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64, which has an output rotational speed, N0. An inner gear member of the<br>
second planetary gear set 26 is connected to an inner gear member of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. and<br><br>
6<br>
is connected to a second electrical machine comprising a motor/generator 72,<br>
referred to as MG-B.<br>
[0018] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60.<br>
MG-A and MG-B are both of an annular configuration which permits them<br>
to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of MG-A<br>
and MG-B. Transmission output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive output torque, To to vehicle wheels.<br>
Each clutch is preferably hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid from a pump, described below, via an electro-hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42.<br>
[0019] The transmission 10 receives input torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
and referred to as 'TV, 'lY, and 'IV respectively, as a result of energy<br>
conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical energy<br>
storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises one or more<br>
batteries. Other electrical energy and electrochemical energy storage devices<br>
that have the ability to store electric power and dispense electric power may<br>
be used in place of the batteries without altering the concepts of the present<br>
invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based upon factors including<br>
regenerative requirements, application issues related to typical road grade<br>
and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as emissions, power<br>
assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to TPIM<br><br>
7<br>
19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an clement of the control<br>
system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 transmits<br>
electrical energy to and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the<br>
TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the<br>
ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and respective<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality.<br>
[0020] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC transmission lines and provides AC current to the respective<br>
electrical machine, i.e., MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and<br>
31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC] current from<br>
the electrical machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and transmits<br>
current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the<br>
inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical<br>
energy storage device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-<br>
phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that<br>
is mounted on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known<br>
complementary three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br><br>
8<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23.<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPLVL) 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the<br>
transmission 10 through a request for a torque output. Exemplary vehicle<br>
operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal,<br>
transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the<br>
aforementioned control modules communicates with other control modules,<br>
sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol<br>
utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols<br>
provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between<br>
the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br><br>
9<br>
[0022] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23. TCM 17. TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the Ul 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque request ('Tu_RE(y) output to driveline<br>
90, the input torque T, originating from the engine, clutch torque ('IV: \') for<br>
the N various torque-transfer clutches CI. C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10;<br>
and motor torques TAand TBfor MG-A and MG-B. The TCM 17 is operative])'<br>
connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, including monitoring<br>
various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and executing<br>
control signals for various solenoids to control pressure switches and control<br>
valves contained therein.<br>
[0023] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual input torque, T,, to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity. ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12 which translate to<br>
transmission input speed, N,, manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br><br>
10<br>
[0024] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques (T(L EST \) for each of the N clutches C1, C2, C3. and,<br>
C4 and transmission output rotational speed, N0 of shaft 64. Other actuators<br>
and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to<br>
the HCP for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids<br>
to actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes,<br>
as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0025] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power,<br>
referred to as a range PBAT_MiNto PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0026] The TPIM 19 includes previously referenced power inverters and<br>
motor control modules configured to receive motor control commands and<br>
control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or regeneration<br>
functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate the torque commands for<br>
MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, i.e., TA and TB, based upon input from the IICP 5,<br>
which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system operating<br>
parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B are<br>
implemented by the control system, including the TPIM 19, to control MG-<br>
A and MG-B. Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and MG-B are<br><br>
11<br>
derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or conventional<br>
rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and communicates motor speeds<br>
to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Iilectrical current is transferable to<br>
or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the liSD 74 is being<br>
charged or discharged.<br>
[0027] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0028] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device.<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br><br>
12<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0029] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and fable 1,<br>
below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Transmission Operating	Actuated Clutches<br>
Range State		<br>
Mode I - Engine Off (M1_Eng Off)	C1 70	<br>
Mode I - Engine On (M1_Eng_On)	C1 70	<br>
Fixed Ratio 1 (GR1)	C1 70	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 2 (GR2)	C1 70	C2 62<br>
Mode II - Engine Off (M2_Eng Off)	C2 62	<br>
Mode II - Engine On (M2_Eng__On)	C2 62	<br>
Fixed Ratio 3 (GR3)	C2 62	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 4 (GR4)	C2 62	C3 73<br>
[0030] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3. and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each of the operating range states. Additionally, in various<br>
transmission operating range states, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as<br>
electrical motors to generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate<br>
electrical energy. A first mode, i.e., Mode I, is selected when clutch C1 70 is<br><br>
13<br>
actuated in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear<br>
set 28. The engine 14 can be either on or off. A second mode, i.e.. Mode II. is<br>
selected when clutch C1 70 is released and clutch C2 62 is simultaneously<br>
actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28.<br>
Again, the engine 14 can be either on or off. For purposes of this description.<br>
Engine Off is defined by engine input speed, NE, being equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute (RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.<br>
Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect when the electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are not discussed<br>
herein.<br>
[0031] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds at shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each operating range state. The combination of two<br>
modes with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each range state allows the<br>
transmission 10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition lo highway<br>
speeds, and meet various other requirements as previously described.<br>
Additionally, the control system coordinates operation of the transmission 10<br>
so as to allow synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0032] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e.. either<br>
clutch CI 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br><br>
14<br>
[0033] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e., Ni/N(), is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors or<br>
generators. They are independent of engine to output power flow, thereby<br>
enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any combination<br>
thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio 1 that<br>
motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by power<br>
from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B. through planetary gear set<br>
28 by accepting power from ESD 74.<br>
[0034] Referring now to Fig. 3, various transmission operating modes are<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, N0, and transmission input<br>
speed. N, for the exemplary powertrain control system shown in Fig. 1 and 2.<br>
The Fixed Ratio operation is shown as individual lines for each of the specific<br>
gear ratios, GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, as described with reference to Table 1,<br>
above. The continuously variable Mode operation is shown as ranges of<br>
operation for each of Mode I and Mode II. The transmission operating range<br>
state is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and continuously variable<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific clutches. The control<br>
system is operative to determine a specific transmission operating mode based<br>
upon various criteria, using algorithms and calibrations executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention. Selection of the<br>
operating range state of the transmission depends primarily on the operator<br><br>
15<br>
torque request TO_REQ and the ability of the powertrain to meet that output<br>
torque request.<br>
[0035] Referring to Table 1 and again to Fig. 3, the low range operating state<br>
includes selective actuation of clutches C2. C1, and C4, facilitating operation<br>
in any one of continuously variable Mode I, and fixed gears GR1. GR2, and<br>
GR3. The high range operating state includes selective actuation of clutches<br>
C2, C3, and C4, facilitating operation in any one of continuously variable<br>
Mode II and fixed gears GR3 and GR4. The ranges of continuously variable<br>
operation for Mode I and Mode II can overlap.<br>
[0036] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13. the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine operator torque request, TO_REQ, at shaft 64. Selectively<br>
operated components of the transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and<br>
manipulated to respond to the operator demand. For example, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has selected<br>
a forward drive range and manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake<br>
pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output torque which affects how and when the<br>
vehicle accelerates or decelerates.<br>
[0037] Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g.,<br>
road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating mode is determined<br>
for the exemplary transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes demand for an operator<br>
demand for torque, typically communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as<br>
previously described. Additionally, a demand for output torque is predicated<br>
on external conditions, including, e.g., road grade, road surface conditions, or<br><br>
16<br>
wind load. The operating mode may be predicated on a powertrain torque<br>
demand caused by a control module command to operate of the electrical<br>
machines in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating<br>
mode. The operating mode can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine operable to determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The control system manages torque<br>
inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 based upon an<br>
outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system optimization occurs<br>
to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery<br>
charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the<br>
torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br>
required to arrive at the desired torque output, as described hereinbelow.<br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range oi'<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0038] Referring now to Figs. 4 - 8, controlling operation of a hybrid<br>
powertrain is described, with reference to the exemplary powertrain described<br>
in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Referring specifically to Fig. 4, the method and system<br>
described herein comprise an aspect of strategic control optimization (Block<br>
110), wherein a preferred or desired operating range state (Op RangeDliS) is<br>
selected based primarily upon output speed, N0 of shaft 64 and the operator<br>
torque request, T0 REQ- Output of the strategic control includes the preferred or<br>
desired operating range state ('Op RangeDES') and desired input speed<br>
('Ni_DES') each which are input to a shift execution control block 120. Other<br><br>
17<br>
aspects of the overall architecture for strategic optimization and control of the<br>
exemplary powertrain are described in co-pending U.S. patent application<br>
serial number _/	,	(Attorney Docket No. GP-308478-PTH-CD),<br>
entitled CONTROL ARCHITECTURE FOR OPTIMIZATION AND CONTROL OF A<br>

not be described herein.<br>
[0039] Further details can be found in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S.<br>
patent application Serial No.	/	(Attorney Docket No. GP-308470-<br>
PTH-CD), entitled CONTROL ARCHITECTURE FOR SELECTION OF OPTIMAL<br>
MODE OR GEAR AND INPUT SPEED FOR A HYBRID POWERTRAIN SYSTEM, which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The method comprises the<br>
following steps, executed as one or more algorithms in the control modules of<br>
the distributed control module architecture. The method includes monitoring<br>
output of the transmission, typically N0, the operator torque request, T0 Rf(), at<br>
shaft 64, and, the available battery power PBAT- MIN and PBAi MAX- At least one<br>
allowable operating range state, described with reference to Table 1, is<br>
identified. A torque range for each of the allowable range states is<br>
determined. A cost for operating in each of the determined torque ranges is<br>
calculated, and one of the determined torque ranges is selected as a preferred<br>
operating range state based upon the calculated costs for each determined<br>
torque range. The powertrain is controlled to the preferred operating range<br>
state thereafter.<br>
[0040] Referring now to Fig. 5, a functional block diagram details the<br>
strategic control block 110 of Fig. 4, and depicts inputs N0 and T„_REy to a<br>
strategic manager segment 220, which has outputs to a system constraint<br><br>
18<br>
segment 240 and an optimization segment 260. The output of the system<br>
constraint segment 240 is input to the optimization segment 260. The outputs<br>
of the optimization segment 260 are input to the shift stabilization and<br>
arbitration segment 280, which has an output comprising the preferred<br>
operating range state, OP_RangeDES and desired input speed, N, „i s.<br>
[0041] Referring now to Fig. 6, the strategic manager segment 220 includes<br>
operator inputs, typically torque requests and other inputs through the Ul 13.<br>
cost structure information, described hereinbelow, and raw strategic inputs.<br>
comprising raw parametric signals related to the hybrid powertrain operating<br>
conditions, including those related to the ESD 74. Outputs from the strategic<br>
manager segment 220 comprise cost structure information (COST), strategic<br>
inputs including transmission output speed N0, range of available battery<br>
power PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX, and the operator torque request T0 !<eg.></eg.>
[0042] Referring now to Fig. 7, a detailed description of the strategic system<br>
constraints segment 240 is now described. The output speed N„ is input to<br>
strategic speed constraint segment 230. The speed constraint segment 230<br>
determines maximum and minimum input speeds for operating in each<br>
continuously variable mode, i.e., N,_M!N_M1, N, MAX Ml. N, M,N M2, and<br>
N, MAX_M2, in order to determine which of the hybrid operating range states,<br>
i.e., GR1, GR2, GR3, GR4, Ml Eng Off, Ml Eng On, M2 Eng Off. and<br>
M2_Eng_On, are allowable based upon current operating constraints,<br>
specifically output speed N0. There are three output paths 242. 244. 246 from<br>
segment 240 which supply inputs to optimization segment 260. Output path<br>
244 provides relevant system constraint information, comprising a range of<br>
torque values in form of minimum and maximum motor torques for MG-A<br><br>
19<br>
(TA MIN, TA MAX) and minimum and maximum input torques (T, VMN. T, MAX) tor<br>
each of the fixed gear operations, i.e., GR1, GR2, GR3. GR4. This<br>
information is communicated to each of segments 270. 272. 274, and 276 oi~<br>
segment 260.<br>
[0043] Referring now to Fig. 8, the strategic optimization segment 260 is<br>
now described. The allowable hybrid operating range states output from<br>
segment 240 to the strategic optimization segment 260 are used to identi fy<br>
which of the optimization segments 262, 264, 266, 268, 270, 272. 274 and 276<br>
are to be executed. Segments 262, 264, 266, 268, 270, 272, 274 and 276 each<br>
comprise optimization segments, wherein an optimum operating cost (P(osr) is<br>
determined for each of the permissible operating range states, based upon the<br>
inputs previously described, including the previously described range of<br>
torque values and costs related to driveability, fuel economy, emissions, and<br>
battery life. The optimum operating cost preferably comprises a minimum<br>
operating cost at a powertrain operating point within the range of attainable<br>
torque values for each operating range state.<br>
[0044] Referring now to Fig. 9, a method to determine preferred operating<br>
conditions for operating the exemplary powertrain in fixed gear mode<br>
operating range state, i.e., any one of GR1, GR2. GR3. and GR4, is described.<br>
The range of permissible input torque values to the transmission and driveline.<br>
comprising minimum and maximum input torques T, MIN and, T, V,AN. and<br>
minimum and maximum motor torques output from MG-A, i.e., TA_M,N, and<br>
TA_MAX, are input from segment 244 to segment 360 for each of blocks 270.<br>
272, 274, and 276. Segment 360 comprises a two-dimensional search engine<br>
("2D Search Engine"), which iteratively generates parametric values for<br><br>
20<br>
transmission input torque and MG-A torque, [Ti, TA]j for execution in an<br>
iterative loop 366. The subscript "j" refers to a specific iteration, and ranges<br>
in value from 1 to n. The quantity of iterations, n, can be generated by any<br>
one of a number of methods, either internal to the search engine, or as a part of<br>
the overall method. It is understood that the method can. alternatively, use as<br>
inputs the range of permissible input torque values to the transmission and<br>
driveline, comprising minimum and maximum input torques T, VUN and, T, MAX.<br>
and minimum and maximum motor torques output from MG-B. i.e., TB M1N.<br>
and TB_MAX, input from segment 244 to segment 360 for each of blocks 270,<br>
272, 274, and 276.<br>
[0045] The parametric values for input torque and MG-A torque, [ T|, TA]j<br>
are input to a system equation 362, from which a parametric value for motor<br>
torque TB is determined. The motor torques TAand 1 and input torque T, are<br>
input to a cost function 364, which calculates a cost (Pro.sT)j for operating the<br>
exemplary powertrain to achieve the specific parametric input torque and<br>
motor torque from iteration step j. The cost determined during each iteration<br>
is returned and captured, or analyzed, in the search engine 360 depending<br>
upon specifics of the search engine 360. The search engine 360 itcratively<br>
evaluates parametric values for the cost (PCOST)I and identifies a preferred cost.<br>
which comprises a minimum cost for all the iteratively calculated parametric<br>
values in this embodiment. The preferred cost and corresponding values for<br>
input torque and MG-A torque [Tj, TA, PCOSTWF are output to block 280 from<br>
each of blocks 270, 272, 274, and 276, and comprise a preferred cost for each<br>
of the fixed gear ratios.<br><br>
21<br>
[0046] The method includes determining the range of permissible input<br>
torques T,__MAX to T,_MIN and motor torques TA_M!N, and TA MAX. The permissible<br>
input torques comprise practical constraints associated with the specific engine<br>
embodiment, and are based upon operating characteristics of the specific<br>
engine used. The permissible motor torques comprise application-specific<br>
limits related to electrical motor design and available battery power. The<br>
permissible input torques and motor torques for MG-A are preferably input<br>
through line 244 for any of the gears GR1. GR2, GR3. GR4 to segment 360.<br>
which comprises an element of each of segments 270, 272, 274, 276, and<br>
comprise an output from segment 240, described above.<br>
[0047] The ranges of permissible input torques T,_M,N. and, T, MAX and<br>
permissible MG-A torques TA_N.MN and TA MAX comprise boundary conditions<br>
that are input to the two-dimensional search engine 360 including iterative<br>
search loop 366. The two-dimensional search engine comprises any one of<br>
several known methods executed as an algorithm in one of the control<br>
modules which is operative to generate parametric values for T, and TA within<br>
the ranges of permissible values, output the parametric values | T, f A. 1 V|, to<br>
the iteration loop 366 to determine a correlated cost, (PCOST)J, and evaluate the<br>
resultant, i.e., [PCOST]J in the search engine 360. The search engine determines<br>
a preferred resultant, i.e.. [T, TA, PCOST]PREF, by comparing the resultant from<br>
each iteration with a previously determined resultant. When the preferred<br>
resultant comprises a minimum value for the correlated cost, the engine 360<br>
selects and captures and stores the lesser value of the resultant and the<br>
previously determined resultant. When the search engine has executed the<br>
search over the range of parametric values for T, and TA, the final captured<br><br>
22<br>
resultant comprises the preferred resultant, [T,. TA, PCOST|PREF, which is then<br>
output to block 280.<br>
[0048] The two dimensional search engine 360 can comprise any one of<br>
several known search engines operative to generate parametric values for T,<br>
and TA within the ranges of permissible values therefore. By way of example,<br>
one such search engine iterativcly generates combinations of inputs over the<br>
entire range of permissible input torques TLM,Nto T, MAX, and over the entire<br>
range of permissible MG-A torques TA M,N to TA MAX. By way of example.<br>
another search engine referred to as a direct search method comprises a<br>
heuristic sampling search process wherein parametric values for T,. and TA are<br>
determined for input to the system equation (Block 362). The two-<br>
dimensional direct search method comprises a known method for solving<br>
optimization problems that does not require any information about the gradient<br>
of the objective function, and is applicable to a method wherein there are two<br>
or more degrees of freedom, which comprise independent variables T, and T x<br>
in this embodiment. The direct search method comprises an algorithm that<br>
searches a set of points around the first or current parametric values, looking<br>
for the value of the objective function, i.e., the output of the cost function, to<br>
be lower than the value at the current point. Regardless of the search engine<br>
utilized, it resides as an algorithm in one of the control modules for execution<br>
during ongoing operation of the vehicle.<br>
[0049] The parametric values for input torque and MG-A torque are input to<br>
system equation 362, from which a parametric value for motor torque Th3 is<br>
determined. When the exemplary transmission is operated in one of the fixed<br>
gear operating range states, the speed relationship between MG-A. MG-B. the<br><br>
23<br>
engine input, N1 and the transmission output N0 is defined as shown in Eq. 1.<br>
below:<br><br>
wherein N, comprises the input speed from engine 14, N0 is the transmission<br>
output speed, NAand NB are the operating speeds for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
and bi i, b2i, and b}\ are known scalar values determined for the specific<br>
application. In this application, when the transmission output speed, N0is<br>
known, N, for the engine 14, and NAand NB can be determined. I he torque<br>
relationship between MG-A and MG-B is as defined in Eq. 2, below:<br><br>
wherein T, is the input torque from engine 14, T0is the transmission output<br>
torque, i.e., the requested output torque, T0_REQ, TAand TB are the operating<br>
torques for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. N t represents time-rate change in input<br>
speed of the engine 14, and dn, di2, di3, dii, are known scalar values<br>
determined for the specific application. In this application, when the<br>
transmission output torque T0 is known, there are two degrees of freedom i.e.,<br>
T, and TA, by which TB can be determined. The system equation 362. derived<br>
from Eqs. 1 and 2, is as follows in Eq. 3:<br><br><br>
24<br>
|3|<br>
wherein an, an, an. and bi are known scalar values determined for the specific<br>
application.<br>
The iterative search process preferably comprises selecting parametric values<br>
for T,and TA which are input to an algorithm comprising the system equation,<br>
shown as Eq. 3 above (Block 362) to generate an output comprising a<br>
corresponding parametric value for motor torque TB.<br>
[0050] The selected parametric values for T, and TA and the calculated<br>
parametric value for motor torque TB output from Eq. 3 are all input to the cost<br>
function (Block 364) to calculate a cost, PCOST- which is associated with the<br>
selected parametric values for Ti and TA. The cost, PC()ii-y. and 11 and TA |T|.<br>
TA, PCOST]J are input back through the search loop to segment 360, which<br>
iteratively executes the two-dimensional search method over the range of<br>
permissible input torque Ti and motor torque TA to converge on an preferred<br>
or optimal value for cost (PCOST)PRF&gt;- The optimal value for cost. P( ()ST is<br>
preferably a minimum cost value in this embodiment.<br>
[0051] The cost information used in the cost function 364 preferably<br>
comprises operating costs which are generally determined based upon factors<br>
related to vehicle driveability. fuel economy, emissions, and battery life for the<br>
determined torque range. Furthermore, costs are assigned and associated with<br>
fuel and electrical power consumption associated with a specific operating<br>
point of the powertrain system for the vehicle. Lower operating costs are<br>
generally associated with lower fuel consumption at high conversion<br><br>
25<br>
efficiencies, lower battery power usage, and lower emissions for an operating<br>
point, and take into account a current operating range state of the powertrain<br>
system. The optimum operating cost (Pros?) can be determined by calculating<br>
a total powertrain system loss, comprising an overall system power loss and a<br>
cost penalty, such as can be associated with controlling battery state of charge.<br>
The overall system power loss comprises a term based upon engine power loss<br>
driven by fuel economy and exhaust emissions, plus losses in the mechanical<br>
system (e.g., gears, pumps, belts, pulleys, valves, chains), losses in the<br>
electrical system (e.g., wire impedances and switching and solenoid losses),<br>
and heat losses. Other losses include electrical machine power losses and<br>
internal battery power losses. Other factors may also be considered, including<br>
factors related to battery life due to depth of discharge of the KSD 74. current<br>
ambient temperatures and their effect on state of charge of the battery.<br>
Operating costs are preferably developed relative to specific<br>
powertrain/vehicle applications during vehicle calibration pre-production. An<br>
exemplary method for determining engine power losses are described in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication Number<br>
2005/0256633 A2, entitled COST STRUCTURE METHOD INCLUDING FUEL<br>
ECONOMY AND ENGINE EMISSION CONSIDERATIONS, the contents of which are<br>

20. The apparatus of claim 19, wherein the code to determine the plurality<br>
of costs further comprises:<br>
code to iteratively select parametric values for the input torque and the motor<br>
torque from the first electrical machine;<br>
code to determine a motor torque from the second electrical machine based<br>
upon the selected parametric values for the input torque and the motor<br>
torque from the first electrical machine; and,<br>
code to determine a cost for each of the iteratively selected parametric values<br>
for the input torque and motor torque from the first electrical machine<br>
and the motor torque from the second electrical machine determined<br>
therefrom.<br><br>
There is provided a control system for a powertrain system including an electro-mechanical transmission that is selectively operative in a plurality of fixed gear modes and continuously variable modes. The control system is adapted to identify preferred operating conditions for operating the powertrain<br>
in a fixed gear operating range state. The method comprises determining a range of permissible input torques and motor torques input from a first electrical machine to the transmission, and determining a plurality of motor torques input from a second electrical machines based thereupon. Costs are determined, based upon the engine inputs and the motor torques for the first and second electrical machines determined thereupon. A preferred input<br>
torque input and a preferred motor torque input is identified based upon the determined costs.<br></td>
