FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to a multifunction peripheral device. Particularly the present invention relates the facsimile reception. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of redirecting fax based on the memory condition.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED PRIOR ART<br>
In the conventional method when a fax is fired from a source fax machine to a destination fax machine it results in a handshake between the source and the destination fax machines. During this handshake the source and destination machines negotiate and decides on a protocol for data transfer to take place. After this the destination fax machine starts receiving the fax that is sent by the source machine. Here if there is some error in the receiving machine like paper currently not available etc., then the data that is being transmitted from the source fax machine will start storing in the memory of the destination fax machine. If the memory of the destination machine is almost full then it cannot receive the fax and the transmission will not happen. Even if the memory is not sufficient for holding a bigger amount of data that is transferred from the source (for example a high resolution picture), then also the transmission will fail.<br><br>
US Patent 5291302A discloses a special computer-based fax Store and Forward Facilities (SAFF's) as an integral part of a switched telephone network system. All fax transmissions entering into the network are routed to such a facility, typically geographically near the originating machine where they are temporarily stored by the computer in a mass storage buffer.<br>
US2002054397 describes an image processing device which has a mass storage device capable of storing a large number of image data. The stored image data is transferred to an external device connected in the network.<br>
All the above mentioned methods have a similar drawback. They do not explain rerouting of fax based on the memory/error status and redirecting the faxes to pre-configured number when the destination memory is low.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to re-route the fax that is being sent from a source fax machine to Mass Storage device (MSD) or to a pre-configured number when the memory on the destination side is less to store the incoming fax.<br>
This invention proposes a method by which the fax can be redirected based on the memory/error status at the destination side. This will prevent failure in the fax<br><br>
transmission when the memory at the destination side is low. This is done by redirecting the fax that is sent by the source MFP to a MSD where it will be stored or to a pre-configured number.<br>
For this the Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP) at the destination side is provided with a menu option named store fax at MSD (Mass storage device) or re-direct it to a pre-configured number. The user has the option to turn on/off these features. Once any one of these features is turned ON, then it means that fax rerouting has been enabled. So in this case if the memory at the destination MFP is low then the fax that is being sent from the source MFP will be rerouted to the MSD or to the pre-configured number depending upon the option selected from the menu.<br>
The main advantage of this invention is that there is no constraint for reception of fax due to memory. Also in case of storing the fax at the MSD the user can get the fax printed whenever he want as it will be stored in the MSD. In case of redirecting the fax to a pre-configured number the received fax can be printed there or can also be stored if it has some memory to store them.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method of redirecting fax based on the memory condition wherein a source machine send the said fax to a Mass Storage device (MSD) or to a pre-configured number when the memory on the destination machine is less to store the incoming fax.<br><br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a flow chart showing rerouting fax to a Mass Storage Device (MSD) or to a pre-configured number.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br><br>
2<br>
The present invention explains how the fax rerouting takes place based on the memory or error status of the MFP. Consider the case in which the source MFP is sending fax to a destination MFP. If the MFP is able to print the incoming fax then it will be printed. If at receiving end the MFP has gone out of paper or if it has met with an error then the fax that is being sent will get stored in the memory of the destination MFP as long as the memory is more than 50%. Once the memory reaches 50% if fax rerouting is enabled then automatically the fax that is being sent from the source MFP will be sent page by page and stored at the MSD or it will be rerouted to the pre-configured number.<br>
The rerouting facility can be turned ON/Off at the destination MFP. This is done with the help of menu option named Store Fax at MSD and/or redirect it to a pre-configured number. Based upon the option selected from the menu fax rerouting will take place. The fax redirection feature can be enabled by configuring the fax option also.<br>
If the option of rerouting the fax to a MSD is selected at the destination MFP then the MFP will ask the user to enter a username and a password for connecting to the MSD where the incoming fax will be stored. Once the user has entered the username and the password, the fax redirection feature is activated. So if the source MFP is sending a fax to a destination MFP and if the destination MFP has met with an error or if there is no paper in the tray then as long as the memory is more than 50% the incoming fax will be stored in the destination MFP itself, once it reaches up to 50% mark it will start sending the fax, page by page,<br><br>
to the pre-configured MSD where it will be stored. Here once the fax is completely received then MFP again checks for the error conditions. If the error conditions related to fax are rectified then it will fetch the pages from the MSD and start printing the pages in the same sequence in which they were received.<br><br>
2<br>
If the option of rerouting the fax to a pre-configured number is selected then as explained above once the memory reaches the 50% mark the fax being sent from the source MFP will be rerouted to the pre-configured number where either it will be printed or it will be stored if it has some memory to store them.<br>
Referring Fig 1 it shows the sequence of events that will happen once fax rerouting is enabled. First when the source MFP sends the fax to the destination MFP, the MFP at the destination end checks for possibility to print the incoming fax (it checks for paper, toner etc.,) if there is no error in the status of the MFP, then the MFP will continue with printing the fax. But if the MFP finds an error in the status of the MFP (like paper not available etc.,) then it will store the incoming fax in its memory as long as the memory is more than 50%. Once it reaches the 50% mark the MFP will check whether redirection of fax is enabled or not. If it is enabled it will check for the particular option.<br>
If the option of storing the fax at the MSD is enabled then the incoming fax will be rerouted and stored at the MSD. When the fax transmission is over, the MFP will again check for the status, if it is ready to print the fax pages then the fax pages stored at the MSD will be fetched and will be printed in the order in which<br><br>
they were sent.<br>
If the other option of rerouting the fax to a pre-configured number is enabled then the incoming fax will be rerouted to the pre-configured number where the fax will be printed.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
