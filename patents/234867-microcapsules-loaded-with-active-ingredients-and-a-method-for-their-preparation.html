THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to microcapsules, compositions comprising the microcapsules and to a method for their preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Isolating functional molecules or substances in inert materials has many useful benefits and applications where chemical contact between the active ingredient and the immediate environment should be minimized. For example, make-up compositions, such as make-up colors are currently using a very limited number of approved natural pigments and even fewer artificial organic colors. Many dyes and pigments with desired color shades of natural or synthetic origin are not approved for skin contact because their safety for direct skin contact has not been demonstrated. Isolating the colorants in a transparent and inert isolating material provides a way to prevent the direct contact between the color molecules and the skin, while retaining (or even enhancing) the color intensity. Another very important application is in sunscreen compositions. The active ingredients in sunscreens have been reported to cause contact dermatitis and may cause photo contact dermatitis. Moreover, the light-excited species of these reagents may undergo photodecomposition reactions resulting in the production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which may bear deleterious effects on live tissues. Thus, encapsulating sunscreen active ingredients by enveloping them within a transparent silica shell offers a sophisticated way to benefit from the light-absorbing capability of sunscreens, while substantially isolating them and/or their possible photodecomposition products from the live tissues. Another example, from a totally different field, is the encapsulating of food colors either for prolonging the shelf life of food products containing unstable natural colors such as lycopene and carotene or<br>
2.<br><br>
for isolating artificial food colors that have undesirable side effects. Encapsulating food colors of the second type in inert transparent microcapsules provides a way to prevent the digestion of these colorants while maintaining their desired color effect.<br>
US patent Nos. 6,303,149, 6,238,650, 6,468,509, 6,436,375 and International publication Nos. WO 01/80823, WO 03/034979 and WO 03/039510 (the disclosures of these patents and publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), disclose sol-gel microcapsules and methods for their preparation. In these patents and publications the loading of the active ingredients (termed also "functional molecules") which constitutes the core of the microcapsules is up to 95% (w/w).<br>
US patent No. 6,365,642 discloses a process for obtaining open-celled foams by polymerizing a high internal phase (water-in-oil) emulsion, which has small amount of a continuous oil phase and a relatively greater amount of discontinuous phase. The water-in-oil emulsion taught cannot be used to form sol-gel microcapsules since the oil constitutes the external phase.<br>
EP 0934 773 relates to microcapsules, wherein the capsule wall is composed of organopolysiloxane, and to a method for producing such microcapsules.<br>
There is a widely recognized need and it will be highly advantageous to have microcapsules comprising a high concentration (above 95% w/w) of the core material (which includes the active ingredient) and yet which is capable of minimizing the contact between the active ingredient and the environment. Such high concentration of the core material is required, for example, in order to obtain high Sun Protection Factor (SPF) values, or in many other applications where high loading of an encapsulated active ingredient in the composition is required.<br>
Additionally it will be highly advantageous to have an efficient encapsulation method which is simplified in production lower in cost (i.e involving less monomer and less waste disposal) and which is capable of<br>
3<br><br>
having high concentrations (above 95% w/w) of the core material (active ingredient) and yet preventing the leaching of the active ingredient from the microcapsules. Such a method will facilitate the encapsulation of a wide variety of molecules or substances, where the application may demand high loading of the encapsulated molecules or substances.<br>
Moreover, it will be highly advantageous to have an oil-in-water emulsion having a high concentration (above 50%) of the internal oily phase and to have emulsions which is simplified in production.<br>

The flourescent dye may be for example nile red, perylene, pyrene, antracene, or mixtures thereof.<br>
10<br><br>
Preferably the precursors are selected from metal alkoxide monomers, semi-metal alkoxide monomers, metal ester monomers, semi-metal ester monomers and from monomers of the formula M(R) n (P) m, wherein M is a metallic or semi metallic element, R is a hydrolysable substituent, n is an integer from 2 to 6, P is a non polymerizable substituent and m is and integer from 0 to 6, a partially hydrolyzed and partially condensed polymer thereof, or any mixture thereof.<br>

The sunscreen agent may be as defined above.                                                        Most preferably the sunscreen agent is selected from octylmethoxy <br>
cinnamate, 3-butylmethoxydibenzoyl methane, benzophenone-3, 2-ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate, or mixtures thereof and said precursor is tetraethoxy silane.<br>
The precursors which may be used in the present invention (termed also sol-gel precursers) are also described in US patent Nos. 6,303,149, 6,238,650, 6,468,509, 6,436,375 and International publication Nos. WO 01/80823, WO 03/034979 and WO 03/039510 (the disclosures of these patents and publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).<br>
Recognizing that metal and semi metal alkoxide monomers (and their partially hydrolyzed and condensed polymers) such as tetramethoxy silane (TMOS), tetraethoxy silane (TEOS),) etc. are very good solvents for numerous molecules and substances (active ingredients) is highly advantageous since it facilitated the utilization of this solubility property to load the dissolved molecules or substances in the monomeric precursor solvent or in the hydrolysis-condensation polymer of the monomer solvent. Nonetheless, the present invention may also be used to coat or load molecules or substances (active ingredients) which can be suspended in the precursors.<br>
12<br><br>
The particle size of the microcapsules may be in the range of 0.01-l000µm in diameter, preferably 0.1-100µm in diameter and more preferably 1-1 0µm in diameter.<br>
The microcapsules of the present invention may be useful for human or non-human applications, as they may be easily incorporated in various carriers. The microcapsules may be easily dispersed or suspended in a carrier or diluent.<br>
Simple mixing with any suitable mixer or stirrer is sufficient to achieve an effective dispersion. If necessary high shear forces may be applied to facilitate fast and efficient mixing of the microcapsules in the carrier.<br>
Preferably the microcapsules are non-leaching when dispersed in a carrier.<br>
The present invention additionally relates to a composition comprising microcapsules as defined in the present invention and a carrier.<br>
The composition may be for example a cosmetic composition, a pharmaceutical composition, a food composition, a composition used in agriculture or industrial processes.<br>
Preferably the microcapsules are dispersed in the carrier.<br>
The carrier may be a cosmetic carrier, a pharmaceutical carrier, a food carrier, a carrier used in agriculture or industrial processes.<br>
The carrier may be a liquid, a semi solid or a solid carrier.<br>
The carrier may be for example an emulsion, a cream, an aqueous solution, an oil, an ointment, a paste, a gel, a lotion, a milk, a suspension, a powder, a processed food , a spray, a paint, a lacquer, a coating, a plastic or a detergent.<br>
The carrier may further comprise at least one non-encapsulated active ingredient.<br>
13<br><br>
The final form of the composition may be for example an emulsion, an aqueous solution, an oil, a semi-solid formulation (such as a cream, an ointment, a paste, or a gel), a lotion, a milk, a suspension, a powder, a capsule, an aerosol, a spray, a foam, a shampoo, a hair conditioner, a lacquer, a makeup, a solid stick, a toothpaste, a food, a paint, a plastic or a coating.<br>
The particle size of the microcapsules can be controlled to the range 0.01-1000µm, preferably 0.1-l00µm, more preferably 1-l0µm in diameter.<br>
The particle size of the microcapsules can be controlled for example by controlling the particle size of the oil droplets of the emulsion used to prepare the microcapsules (the preparation of the emulsion and microcapsules is detailed below in the described process).<br>
The composition may be in the form of a suspension or a powder wherein the powder particles (microcapsules) or the suspended particles (microcapsules) are preferably of 0.01 - l000µ in diameter.<br>
More preferably the composition may be in the form of a suspension or a powder wherein the powder or the suspension includes 0.1-10µ (diameter) spherical particles (microcapsules), has a smooth texture, and is transparent when suspended in cosmetic or skin care formulations and applied to skin.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be applied topically.<br>
By one embodiment the microcapsules of the present invention are leachless (non-leaching), this is highly advantageous since encapsulation of a sensitive active ingredient in the microcapsules can protect it from other ingredients in the formulation and from the environment, and thus extends the shelf life of the end-product. The active ingredients in sunscreens have been reported to cause contact dermatitis and may cause photo contact dermatitis. Moreover, the light-excited species of these reagents may undergo photodecomposition reactions resulting in the production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which may bear deleterious effects on live tissues.<br>
14<br><br>
Therefore, formulating leachless microcapsules is particularly advantageous in sunscreen compositions where there is a need to isolate the sunscreen active agents an/or their possible photodecomposition products from the live tissues.<br>
Additional examples and applications in which isolation of the active ingredients from the environment is advantageous are described in the background of the invention.<br>
Surprisingly it was found in the present invention, in accordance to the leachless aspect, that the leaching of the microcapsules loaded with an active ingredient, being the sunscreen agent, into cosmetic oils or into an aqueous solution including a surfactant is less than 1%, preferably less than 0.5% after vigorous shaking.<br>
By another embodiment the microcapsules of the present invention are designed to release the active ingredient.<br>
In certain applications such as medical (oral or topical) or agricultural it may be desired to achieve immediate or controlled release of the active ingredient from the microcapsules.<br>
The release of active ingredient from the microcapsule can be designed to be immediate, delayed or sustained; this can be controlled by varying the composition of the microcapsular shell, its diameter, and by varying the composition of the carrier surrounding the microcapsules.<br>
Release can be obtained and controlled by aging time, thermal treatment or any mechanical mean that can change the characteristic porosity or strength of the shell, or by chemical means such as organic polymers and/or surfactants that may be added while the microcapsules are being formed, to control the surface nature of the shell and the rate of diffusion through the pores. Since the microcapsular shell may be composed of sub-micron particles, the effective pore size of the shell may be controlled by electrolytes or any other chemical component of the formulation. This may be a trigger for release of the active ingredients from the microcapsules.<br>
15<br><br>
Since the encapsulation creates micro-domains within the entire formulation, one active ingredient can be encapsulated while a second active ingredient can be present in the carrier that surrounds the microcapsules. This is advantageous when the ingredients acts synergistically together, yet one is chemically reactive with another.<br>
Alternatively each of the active ingredients may be microencapsulated in separate microcapsules.<br>
In an alternative, the active ingredient may be encapsulated alone, or with other ingredients within the same microcapsule. Co-encapsulation of compounds that enhance stability of the sensitive ingredient is beneficial. For example, anti oxidants can be co-encapsulated with oxygen-sensitive or oxidant-sensitive ingredients, to give "localized protection".<br>
The present invention additionally relates to a suspension, substantially free of colloidal silica, comprising microcapsules as described in the present invention.<br>
The colloidal silica (nanoparticles of silica) is produced during the polymerization of the precursors at the oil-water interphase as an intermediate of the production of the final microcapsules shell. The monomer precursors used in the polymerization reaction do not remain as such but either constitute the microcapsules shell or are left as residual material in the form of colloidal silica unattached to the shell. Preferably 0-20% w/w, more preferably 0-10%w/w and most preferably 0-5% of the colloidal silica is unattached to the shell of the microcapsules (i.e. present in the reaction medium in a free form and does not constitute the micarocapsule's shell).<br>
As used herein the term "substantially free of colloidal silica" means that the suspension of the microcapsules include minute, insignificant amount of the colloidal silica in the suspension medium, preferably less than 20%w/w more preferably less than 10% and most preferably less than 5% w/w.<br>
16<br><br>
The term "minute insignificant amount of the colloidal silica in the suspension medium" means that preferably 0-20% w/w, more preferably 0-10%w/w and most preferably 0-5%w/w of the colloidal silica is unattached to the shell of the microcapsules (i.e. present in the reaction medium in a free form and does not constitute the micarocapsule's shell).<br>
The term "suspension medium" refers to the reaction medium used to prepare the microcapsules and more particularly to the aqueous phase used in the preparation of the emulsion and microcapsules as will be described in the process below.<br>
Similarly, depending on the type of the precursor used to prepare the microcapsules it is appreciated that the suspension is also substantially free of colloidal Titania, Zirconia, Alumina, etc.<br>
Preferably the suspension consists essentially of the microcapsules.<br>
As used herein the term "suspension consists essentially of the microcapsules" means mat the suspension is substantially free of or contains an acceptable concentration of by-products (such as free colloidal silica) produced during the preparation of the microcapsules, which enables using the suspension without further purification.<br>
Most preferably the suspension of microcapsules which is obtained by the process described in the present invention is used without the need of further purification steps.<br>
The suspension may be dispersed in a carrier.<br>
The carrier may be a cosmetic carrier, a pharmaceutical carrier, a food carrier, a carrier used in agriculture or industrial processes.<br>
The carrier may be a liquid, a semi solid or a solid carrier.<br>
Preferably the microcapsules are non-leaching in the medium of the suspension.<br>
Preferably the suspension is non-leaching when the suspension is dispersed in a carrier.<br>

The present invention further relates to a process for preparing microcapsules having a core material encapsulated within a microcapsular shell, said core material comprises at least one active ingredient, said process comprising the step of;<br>
preparing an oil-in-water emulsion by emulsification of an oily phase, comprising a water insoluble precursor and the core material, in an aqueous phase, comprising an aqueous solution having a pH in the range 2-7, under appropriate shear forces and temperature conditions;<br>
the process comprising at least one of the following conditions:<br>
(i)	the concentration of the oily phase based on the total<br>
weight of the emulsion is from 50% to 90% w/w;<br>
(ii)	the weight ratio of the precursors to the core material is<br>
from 5/95 to 25/75;<br>
thereby obtaining microcapsules having above 95% w/w of said core material.<br>
Preferably the process comprising a combination of the two conditions (i) and<br>
(ii).<br>
Preferably the process comprising condition (ii).<br>
The process of the present invention is based on the preparation of an oil-in-water emulsion by emulsifying a hydrophobic solution (oily phase) that comprises the precursors and the core material comprising the at least one active ingredient (molecules or substances to be loaded), in aqueous solution, with or without the need for mixing said emulsion with another aqueous solution to accelerate the condensation-polymerization reaction.<br>
In the present invention the term "mixing" also relates to dropwise addition of one solution to the other, by pouring one solution to the other, or any other method of combining the two solutions together.<br>
18<br><br>
Surprisingly it was found in the present invention that decreasing the weight ratio of the precursor to the core material to the range of 5/95 - 25/75, and/or preparing a concentrated oil-in water emulsion wherein the concentration of the oily phase in the emulsion is above 50% (w/w), and performing the condensation-polymerization process in a pH of 2-7, preferably 2-5, and more preferably 3-4, enables an efficient encapsulation of the core material with high concentration (above 95% w/w) of the core material and yet prevents the leaching of the core material (including the active ingredient) from the microcapsules. As the concentration of the oil phase in the emulsion increases the yield of the reaction increases because it is possible to obtain more microcapsules at each reaction.<br>
Unexpectedly it was found that although the weight ratio of the presursor to the core material was decreased from the prior art typical data of about 50/50 to the range of 5/95 - 25/75, the polymerization of the precursor was of high efficiency and a higher yield was obtained from the point of view of the quantity of silica developed on the shell of the microcapsule, as revealed by the high concentration of the core material and insignificant amount of the residual precursor in the reaction aqueous medium (in the form of colloidal silica) in which the microcapsules are produced. This is highly advantageous since it minimizes the environmental contamination, does not require treatment of the reaction waste water and thus simplifies and lowers the cost of the process.<br>
Another advantage of the process of the present invention is the elimination of the step of isolation of the microcapsules by centrifugation, filtration, re-suspension etc, which is needed in the prior art in order to obtain a high concentration of particles in the final product (in previous patent we needed to isolate the microcapsules from the mother liquor in order to obtain a concentration of 40% (by weight) of sunscreen in the suspension while in the present invention we obtain it at the and of the reaction due to the high loading<br>
19<br><br>
of the active ingredient in the oil phase at the emulsion step and due to the high concentration of the oily phase in the emulsion - 50-90% w/w.<br>
The process may further comprise the step of mixing (diluting) and stirring said emulsion with another aqueous solution at a suitably selected pH in the range 2-7, to obtain loaded microcapsules in a suspension.<br>
Preferably the pH of the aqueous solution is in the range 2-5.<br>
More preferably the pH of the aqueous solution is in the range 3-4.<br>
The pH ranges above refer to the aqueous solution of the emulsification step and/or the optional further step of mixing and stirring the emulsion with another aqueous solution.<br>
In case the aqueous phase of the emulsion has a pH in the range 2-5, more preferably 3-4, the microcapsules in suspension can be obtained after the emulsification step without the need of further steps such as mixing and stirring the obtained emulsion with another aqueous solution as described above or adding a catalyst such as an acidic solution.<br>
Preferably the microcapsules in suspension are obtained after the emulsification step without the need of further steps such as mixing and stiring the obtained emulsion with another aqueous solution as described above or adding a catalyst such as an acidic solution. In this case the pH of the aqueous solution is preferably in the range 2-5 and more preferably in the range 3-4.<br>
This case (where the microcapsules in suspension are obtained after the emulsification step without the need of further steps) is preferred since the yield of the production of the microcapsules per reaction is higher compared to a process comprising a further step of adding another solution to obtain the microcapsules. Occasionally it will be beneficial to further mix and stir the obtained emulsion with another aqueous solution to avoid the interconnection between the microcapsules obtained by the first process (i.e. without the addition of another aqueous solution).<br>
20<br><br>
Performing the condensation-polymerization process in a pH range of 2-7, preferably in the range of 2-5, and more preferably in the range of 3-4 was found to be highly advantageous since at this catalytic pH a more linear polycondensation reaction is obtained at the oil-water interface of the emulsion, thereby reducing the risk of coalescence between the oil drops which can take place at a higher pH. At a higher pH (above pH 7) a random fast polycondensation reaction produces lots of oligomers which promotes the interconnection of the dispersed oil drops.<br>
The emulsification in the process of the present invention may be conducted by adding an aqueous phase to an oily phase or alternatively by adding an oily phase to an aqueous phase.<br>
Preferaby the process comprising:<br>
(a)	mixing a core material and a precursor forming an oily phase;<br>
(b)	emulsifying said oily phase in an aqueous phase having a pH in the range 2-7 to form an oil-in water emulsion; and<br>
(c)	stirring the product obtained in step (b) until microcapsules are formed.<br>
Preferably the process comprising:<br>
(a)	mixing a core material and a precursor in a production reactor forming an oily phase;<br>
(b)	adding an aqueous phase having a pH in the range 2-7 to the production reactor in step (a) to form an oil-in-water emulsion; and<br>
(c)	stirring the product obtained in step (b) until microcapsules are formed.<br>
Preferably the processes of the present invention are conducted in one production reactor.<br>
Conducting the process in one reaction production is preferred since it reduces handling and the cost of the process.<br>
21<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment all the ingredients are mixed in one reactor without transferring the product obtained at the end of each stage of the encapsulation (such as the oily phase, aqueous phase or the emulsion) to a new reactor for further handling of the product until it is ready for special treatment such as isolation of the microcapsules by centrifugation.<br>
The above described process provides also a new process for making emulsions in which all ingredients are added to one production reactor. The novelty of preparing the emulsion and the obtained microcapsules is also based on the order at which the chemical reagents (ingredients) are added to the reactor. The process described is highly advantageous because it is simplified in production, highly efficient, saves time, and therefore lower in cost, compared to the "classical" procedure, in which each phase (oil and water) are prepared separately in two different reactors and then mixed in a third reactor or mixed in the water phase reactor after addition of the oil phase to the water phase or mixed in the oily phase reactor after addition of the water phase to the oily phase (depending on the type of emulsion (w/o or o/w) and the type of surfactant. Classically the dispersed phase is added to the dispersing phase but it is also possible to add inversely if the surfactant used for emulsification do not have the ability to produce the opposite type of emulsion).<br>
The emulsification in the present invention may also be conducted by the "classical" procedure, in which each phase (oil and water) are prepared separately in two different reactors and then mixed in a third reactor or by preparing each phase (oil and water) separately in two different reactors and then adding the oily phase to the aqueous phase (or adding the water phase to the oily phase) as described above.<br>

Recognizing that metal and semi metal alkoxide monomers (and their partially hydrolyzed and condensed polymers) such as tetramethoxy silane (TMOS), tetraethoxy silane (TEOS) etc. are very good solvents for numerous molecules and substances (active ingredients) is highly advantageous since it facilitated the utilization of this solubility property to load the dissolved molecules or substances in the monomeric precurser solvent or in the hydrolysis-condensation polymer of the monomer solvent.

31<br><br>

The process of the present invention may further include the step of modifying the surface charge of the products by adding anionic or cationic surfactants or polymers during any step of the process.<br>
The process of the present invention may be conducted for example by the following non-limiting steps:<br>
(a) A solution comprising of the water insoluble precursors (such as metal alkoxides) with or without a co-solvent and/or surfactant and the molecules to be encapsulated is emulsified in an aqueous solution having a pH in the range of 2-7, that may contain various surfactants, i.e. cationic, anionic or non-ionic surfactants, which are utilized to assist in stabilizing the emulsions. This emulsion is created under appropriate shear forces, utilizing an apparatus such as a homogenizer, a high-pressure homogenizer, a sonicator or membranes.<br>
32<br><br>
The oil phase of the emulsion may optionally contain additives for improving the process and/or for obtaining an improved product. Examples for such additives are viscosity modifying reagents (i.e., thickeners), acids or bases that dissolve in the precursor of choice and assist in catalyzing the hydrolysis-condensation polymerization reaction, surfactants and others.<br>
(b) The emulsion obtained by step (a) may be optionally mixed with another aqueous solution at a suitably selected pH (preferably a pH in the range of 2-7), which may also contain additional surfactants.<br>
The emulsion obtained in step (a) and/or the reaction mixture of step (b) may be heated or cooled, subject to vacuum, or pressure, or kept under inert gas atmosphere, subject to changes in pH, or subject to an optional further aging period at room or accelerated temperature.<br>
The resulting particles (microcapsules) can be optionally isolated and rinsed through cycles of centrifuge or filtration and re-suspension in deionized water or by dialysis or by any other technique known in the art.<br>
The water insoluble solution (of step (a)) and the aqueous solutions (of steps (a) and (b) and of the optional further rinses) may contain various surfactants and any other additives for improving the process and/or the product.<br>
Since the encapsulation process of the present invention is highly efficient, resulting in minute amounts of by products or reaction precursors in the aqueous reaction mixture, the obtained suspension of step (a) or (b) may be used without further treatment (such as rinsing, centrifugation, filtration, resuspension).<br>
Occasionally, the reaction medium of the microcapsules may be changed for example by diafiltration, addition or replacement of the reaction medium.<br>
The obtained suspension of step (a) or (b) may be incorporated for example into a suitable carrier.<br>
33<br><br>
The final product obtained by the process of the present invention may be used in a dispersion form without further treatment or after re-suspension in water with optional addition of suitable additives such as non-ionic, cationic or anionic polymers, or any other suspension aid known to the skilled artisan in this field. This dispersion shows extremely low leaching of the encapsulated material into surfactants solution in water, or into cosmetic oils.<br>

The following examples clarify and demonstrate the present invention. They are not under any circumstances exclusive and do not intend to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Background to examples<br>
As was mentioned in the background, the case of encapsulated sunscreen agents is of a special importance. Sunscreen products are widely used all over the world by all ages and gender, however, not only that the active ingredients in these products may cause contact dermatitis, but also the light-excited species of these reagents may cause photo contact dermatitis. Thus, encapsulating sunscreen active ingredients in transparent microcapsules like silica offers a sophisticated way to benefit from the light-absorbing capability of sunscreens, while substantially isolating them and/or their possible photodecomposition products from the live tissues.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - octylmethoxy cinnamate (OMC) in TEOS (tetraethoxy silane).<br>
Octylmethoxy cinnamate (OMC), a widely used sunscreen has been encapsulated in microcapsules (silica microcapsules) by the following procedure:<br>
38<br><br>
276g OMC was mixed with 24g TEOS. The organic phase was emulsified in 161g of aqueous solution containing 1% cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) under high shear forces using a PT 6100 Polytron homogenizer at 9000rpm for 5minute. The vessel walls were cooled by immersion in an ice-water bath during the homogenizing process. This emulsion was then poured into an IKA LR-A 1000 Laboratory reactor, equipped with Eurostar Power control-vise P4 stirrer, containing 230.5g of an aqueous solution having a pH of 3.8. The mixture was stirred at 400 rpm until the emulsion was completly mixed with the acidic solution, then the stirring rate was lowered to 60 rpm. The microcapsules obtained at the end of the reaction were isolated using a Sorvall RC-5C PLUS centrifuge equipped with SLA-1500 head at 12500RPM for 30min. The cake obtained by this process was reconstituted and stirred in pure water and further isolated by the same process. The cake obtained at the end of this process was reconstituted in an aqueous solution containing dispersants, preservatives and pH stabilizers: 1% w/v Polyvinylpirrolidone (dispersant), 0.3% w/v chlorophenesin (preservative), and 0.2 % w/v citric acid sodium citrate buffer (PH stabilizer).<br>
The composition of the microcapsules obtained by this process consists of 97.55% (w/w) OMC, enveloped in a tiny silica shell having a particle size ranging between 0.75 and 2.5 µ.<br>
Formulation of the microcapsule suspension obtained by this process is described in Formula A, (Example 5, Table 1) which affords a transparent smooth and pleasant cream when applied on the skin<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and OMC in TEOS<br>
82.8g benzophenone-3, an UV-B as well as UV-A sunscreen agent, was dissolved in 193.2g OMC. The obtained mixture was dissolved in 24g TEOS and the organic phase was emulsified under high shear forces (same as<br>
39<br><br>
described in Example 1) in 161g aqueous solution containing 1% cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC). The obtained emulsion was then poured into the reactor (same as above) containing 230g HCl aqueous solution at pH=3.5. The mixture was stirred at 400 rpm until the emulsion was completly mixed with the acidic solution, then the stirring rate was lowered to 60 rpm. The microcapsules obtain at the end of the reaction were isolated using a Sorvall RC-5C PLUS centrifuge equipped with SLA-1500 head at 12500RPM for 30min. The cake obtained by this process was reconstituted and stirred in pure water and further isolated by the same process. The cake obtained at the end of this process was reconstituted in an aqueous solution containing dispersants, preservatives and pH stabilizers: 1% w/v Polyvinylpirrolidone (dispersant), 0.3% w/v chlorophenesin (preservative), and 0.2 % w/v citric acid sodium citrate buffer (PH stabilizer).<br>
The composition of the microcapsules obtained by this process consists of 98.0 % (w/w) BP-3/OMC solution, enveloped in a tiny silica shell having a particle size ranging between 0.75 and 2.5µ.<br>
Formulation of this product in a neutral cosmetic cream (w/o lotion), afforded a cosmetic cream with a broad absorption spectrum in the UV, as expected from a mixture of those two sunscreens used. As a result a transparent smooth and pleasant feel cream was obtained when applied on the skin.<br>
The content of the core (active ingredient) above 95% w/w, for the microcapsules tested was performed by the following method: 200 mg of the microcapsules suspension was dissolved in 1 ml of 5M NaOH (in order to dissolve the microcapsules shell) and then the mixture was diluted to a volume of 100ml with methanol. The quantity of the active ingredient was determined by HPLC. The total weight of the solids (microcapsules) was determined by drying the suspension to maximum dryness at 105°C. The percentage of the active ingredient was determined by dividing the weight of the active ingredient by the total weight of the microcapsules.<br>
40<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3- butylmethoxydibenzoyl methane (BMDBM) in 2-Ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3, 3-diphenylacrylate (Octocrylene)<br>
85.5g BMDBM, a UVA sunscreen agent, was completely dissolved in 199.5g octocrylene (UVB absorber) at 40degC for 3 hours under intensive stirring. The obtained mixture was mixed with 15g TEOS. The oil phase was then emulsified in 16lg of aqueous solution containing 1% (w/w) cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) under high shear forces using a PT 6100 Polytron homogenizer at 15000rpm for l0minute. The vessel walls were cooled by immersion in an ice-water bath during the homogenizing process. This emulsion was then poured into an IKA LR-A 1000 Laboratory reactor, equipped with Eurostar Power control-vise P4 stirrer, containing 230.5g HCl aqueous solution at pH 3.8. The mixture was stirred at 400 rpm until the emulsion was completly mixed with the acidic solution, then the stirring rate was lowered to 60 rpm. The microcapsules obtain at the end of the reaction were isolated using a Sorvall RC-5C PLUS centrifuge equipped with SLA-1500 head at 12500RPM for 30min. The cake obtained by this process was reconstituted and stirred in pure water and further isolated by the same process. The cake obtained at the end of this process was reconstituted in an 1% polyvinyl pyrrolidon (PVP K30, ISP) to afford a stable dispersion. The composition of the microcapsules obtained by this process consists of BMDBM/OCT solution enveloped in a tiny silica shell having a particle size of 0.3-2.7 µ and an aqueous solution containing dispersants (1% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidin).<br>
Formulation of this product in a neutral cosmetic cream (w/o lotion) afforded a cosmetic cream with a broad absorption spectrum in the UV, as expected from a mixture of those two sunscreens used. As a result a transparent smooth and pleasant feel cream was obtained when applied on the skin.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Leaching -out test for the encapsulated OMC in water suspension:<br>
In order to test the encapsulation properties of the microcapsules a leaching-out test was developed. The leaching out test was conducted by vigorous shaking of the suspension (of microcapsules) in 3% polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) solution in water at room temperature, followed by filtration of the particles (0.2µ, cut off filter), and spectral analysis of the filtrate. The amount of the active ingredient leached (free active ingredient) was determined using a calibration curve. A linear response (calibration curve) of the active ingredient dissolved in the same surfactant solution (3% Tween 60 in water) determined spectrophotometrically was obtained at the concentration range 0-0.5%(w/w) of the active ingredient in the surfactant solution. This surfactant solution is commonly used in cosmetic formulations. The ability of this solution to solubilize encapsulated ingredients in water was confirmed by testing this procedure on encapsulated ingredients. The leaching out rate measured as described here for particles in suspension was less than 0.3%. The leaching was in the range 0.1-0.2 w/w.<br>
No significant changes in the leaching rate under the same conditions was observed after homogenization of the suspension with an IKA product type disperser rotated at 2000RPM for 35min and after y-irradiation treatment at 2.5Mrad.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
In order to test the integrity of the encapsulation ability of the microcapsules after formulation in the cosmetic carrier described in table 1, a leaching-out test was developed. In this test the formulated particles are submitted to a vigorous shaking in a 3% polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) aqueous solution at room temperature followed by filtration of the particles (0.2µ cut off filter), and spectral analysis of the<br>
42<br><br>
filtrate. The results show leaching out of 0.15%w/w of the active ingredient (OMC), which clearly show that the integrity of the encapsulation was saved.<br>

Encapsulation of fluorencent dyes<br>
The microencapsulation technology for the entrapment (microencapsulation)<br>
of fluorescent dyes is the same as the microencapsulation of oil soluble<br>
sunscreens with the modification that a non-liquid (solid powder) flourescent<br>
dye is used.<br>
The process for fluorencent dyes encapsulation was performed by the following steps:<br>
43<br><br>
1.	Dissolving of the fluorescent dye within a selected oil (active phase -AP);<br>
2.	Mixing the AP from (1) with TEOS which forms the oil phase (OP);<br>
3.	Emulsification of the OP from (2) with an aqueous surfactant solution (water phase) forming the emulsion stage (EM);<br>
4.	The EM obtained from (3) was diluted to a final concentration with a catalytic water solution (catalyst phase - CT) forming the reaction stage (RE) and mixed to form microcapsules.<br>
The RE stage takes about 24hs until the microcapsule's silica-shell is formed. After this period, depending on its final application, the product is kept in the reaction mixture or isolated by centrifugation or dried by any of the different drying technologies (lyophilization, spray-drying, freeze-drying).<br>
The following microcapsules of flourecsent dyes were prepared by the described process:<br>
1.	Encapsulation of Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Isopropyl myristate (IPM)<br>
2.	Encapsulation of Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Homosalate (HMS)<br>
3.	Encapsulation of Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Dipropyleneglycoldibenzoate(DPGDB)<br>
4.	Encapsulation of Perylene (PE) dissolved in Octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC)<br>
5.	Encapsulation of Perylene (PE) dissolved in Homosalate (HMS)<br>
44<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7: Encapsulation of Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Isopropyl myristate (IPM)<br>
A solution of 387gr of IPM containing 10mg of NR was prepared and further mixed with 68gr of Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in order to obtain the oil phase (OP). The OP was added to 246gr of a 1% (w/w) water solution of cetyltrimethylammoniumchloride (CTAC) and mixed with a high-shear mixer. The emulsion obtained was mixed in a 1 liter reactor containing 350gr of an acidic aqueous solution (containing 0.22 g of HCL) having a pH of 3.8 for 24 hours to form microcapsules in suspension.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Encapsulation of Nile Red dissolved in HMS, Nile red dissolved in DPGDB, Perylene dissolved in OMC and perylene dissolved in HMS. Microcapsules 2-5 listed above in example 6 were prepared as described above (in example 7) using instead of Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Isopropyl myristate (IPM) the following flourecsent dyes and oils:<br>
2.	Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Homosalate (HMS)<br>
3.	Nile Red (NR) dissolved in Dipropyleneglycoldibenzoate (DPGDB)<br>
4.	Perylene (PE) dissolved in Octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC); or<br>
5.	Perylene (PE) dissolved in Homosalate (HMS)<br>
All the amounts of the ingredients used to prepare microcapsules 2-5 were identical to the amounts used in example 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 9: octylmethoxy cinnamate (OMC) in TEOS (tetraethoxy silane).<br>
Octylmethoxy cinnamate (OMC), a widely used sunscreen is encapsulated in microcapsules (silica microcapsules) by the following procedure:<br>
45<br><br>
276g OMC is mixed with 24g TEOS. The organic phase is emulsified in 161g of aqueous solution containing 1% cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) having a pH of 3.5, under high shear forces using a PT 6100 Polytron homogenizer at 9000rpm for 5minute. The vessel walls are cooled by immersion in an ice-water bath during the homogenizing process. This emulsion is then poured into an IKA LR-A 1000 Laboratory reactor, equipped with Eurostar Power control-vise P4 stirrer and the mixture is stirred at 60 rpm for 24 hrs. The microcapsules obtain at the end of the reaction are isolated using a Sorvall RC-5C PLUS centrifuge equipped with SLA-1500 head at 12500RPM for 30min. The cake obtained by this process is reconstituted and stirred in pure water and further isolated by the same process. The cake obtained at the end of this process was reconstituted in an aqueous solution containing 1% w/v Polyvinylpirrolidone.<br>
Alternatively the microcapsules in suspension obtained at the end of the reaction are used without the further steps of isolation and reconstitutuion. The microcapsules suspension obtained is easily dispersed in cosmetic carriers.<br>
