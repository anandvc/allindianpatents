Process for separating out at least one organic compound<br>
The present invention relates to a process for separating out at least one organic compound.<br>
During the preparation of medicinal products or cosmetic products, organic compounds or compositions of organic compounds of natural origin are often used, for example as active principle. Generally, natural raw materials contain desired organic compounds in low concentration in a substrate.<br>
It is consequently necessary to isolate the organic compounds or the compositions of organic compounds from the substrate.<br>
Patent application WO-A-00/64555 describes the extraction of active principles from a raw material with a solvent containing pentafluoropropane. The handling of this solvent and of fractions containing the active principle is difficult and the extraction selectivity is not always satisfactory.<br>
The invention is directed towards overcoming these problems.<br>
The invention consequently relates to a process for separating out at least one organic compound from a substrate containing the said organic compound, comprising a treatment of the substrate with an extraction medium comprising at least one fluoro compound with an atmospheric boiling point of greater than or equal to 25°C, so as to form a fraction comprising organic compound and fluoro compound.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the process according to the invention allows an efficient and selective separation of desired organic compounds from a substrate, in particular of natural origin. The organic compounds may be recovered essentially without undergoing chemical modifications. The process according to the invention may be performed easily.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the fluoro compound has a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of greater than or equal to about 25°C. Good results are obtained with a fluoro compound that has a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of greater than or equal to about 30°C. In one preferred variant, the fluoro compound has a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of greater than or equal to about 35°C. A fluoro compound with a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of greater than or equal to about 40°C is most particularly preferred. The fluoro compound generally has a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of less than or equal to about 200°C. Good results are<br><br>
obtained with a fluoro compound that has a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of less than or equal to about 100°C. In one preferred variant, the fluoro compound has a boiling point at 101.3 kPa of less than or equal to 80°C.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the fluoro compound generally has a Kauri-butanol number (ASTM Dl 133-02) of greater than or equal to about 0. Good results are obtained with a fluoro compound that has a Kauri-butanol number of greater than or equal to about 5. In one preferred variant, the fluoro compound has a Kauri-butanol number of greater than or equal to about 9. The fluoro compound generally has a Kauri-butanol number of less than or equal to about 50. Good results are obtained with a fluoro compound that has a Kauri-butanol number of less than or equal to about 30. In one preferred variant, the fluoro compound has a Kauri-butanol number of less than or equal to 20.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the fluoro compound often contains only fluorine as halogen. It is preferably chosen from fluoro ethers, hydrofluoroalkanes and perfluoroalkanes.<br>
The hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and perfluorocarbons that may be used in the process according to the invention may be linear, branched or cyclic and generally contain 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbon atoms.<br>

Often, the oxygen atoms in the perfluoropolyether are exclusively present in ether bonds C-O-C.<br>
Perfluoropolyethers that may be used are, for example, those corresponding to the general formulae CF3-[(OCF(CF3)-CF2)a-(0-CF2)b]0-CF3 (I) and CF3-[(OCF2-CF2)c-(0-CF2)d]0-CF3 (II) in which a, b, c and d independently denote integers greater than 0. Perfluoropolyethers that may be used are, for example, those sold by Solvay Solexis under the name Galden®.<br>
In another variant, the fluoro ether is a hydrofluoropolyether.

In the process according to the invention, the organic compound may be chosen, for example, from oxygen-containing hydrocarbons, nitrogen-containing hydrocarbons or unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Often, the organic compound is a natural product chosen, for example, from terpenes, steroids, triglycerides, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, prostaglandins, alkaloids and vitamins and also from derivatives of these natural products, in particular oxygen-containing derivatives.<br>
Examples of terpenes that may be mentioned include mono-, sesqui-, di-, tri- and tetraterpenes and derivatives thereof, in particular oxygen-containing derivatives such as alcohols or esters, in particular acetates.<br>
Specific examples of such terpenes that may be separated out, for example, in particular with perfluorohexane, are chosen from P-pinene, limonene, linalool, sugenol, menthol, thymol and linalyl acetate.

Specific examples are chosen from caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the substrate is often of natural origin.<br>
In this case, the process according to the invention may be performed, for example, in the following manner:<br>
(a)	the substrate of natural origin is prepared, for example by chopping it or micronizing it;<br>
(b)	the prepared substrate is treated according to the process according to the invention;<br>

(d)	the recovered portion is subjected to at least one purification operation.<br>
The purification operation may be, for example, an evaporation of at least some of the fluoro compound, a crystallization or a chromatography operation.<br><br>
It has been found that the fluoro compounds described above, in particular 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane, may be used as solvent for dewaxing concretes, i.e. for particularly efficiently precipitating waxes from a natural extract, for example from essential oils.<br>
The concretes may be obtained, for example, by extraction of plants containing essential oils with a non-fluoro solvent as described above, in particular hydrocarbons. For the dewaxing, fluorinated organic compound is added to the concrete, which has optionally been concentrated beforehand.<br>
