The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Fluidized Catalytic Process for Production of Dimethyl Ether from Methanol Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing ether from alcohols, more specifically a fluidized catalytic process for production of dimethyl ether from methanol<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Dimethyl ether (DME) can be produced by one-step process and two-step process. The one-step process refers to one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether from the synthetic gas, and the two-step process refers to synthesis of methanol from the synthetic gas, and then preparation of dimethyl ether via dehydration.<br>
The two-step process is carried out via two steps, i.e. synthesizing methanol from the synthetic gas, and then dehydrating methanol with the catalysis of an acid to prepare dimethyl ether. The two-step process for synthesis of dimethyl ether is the primary process for producing dimethyl ether at home and abroad. Said two-step process uses fine methanol as the feedstock, and has the advantages of less byproducts of the dehydration reaction, high purity of dimethyl ether, mature technique, wide adaptability of the device, and simple post-treatment. Said two-step process can be directly used in a methanol factory, or other non-methanol factory having established public utilities. Generally, ZSM-5 molecular sieve comprising Y-Al203/Si02 is used at home or abroad as the dehydration catalyst, wherein the reaction temperature is controlled at 280-340□ and the pressure at 0.5 to 0.8MPa. The single-pass conversion of methanol is from 70 to 85%; and the selectivity of dimethyl ether is greater than 98%.<br>
CN1180064A discloses a process for producing dimethyl ether from methanol at a fairly low temperature (from 100 to 125□) and almost atmospheric pressure (from 0 to 0.05 MPa gauge pressure) in the presence of a new catalyst to produce a dimethyl ether gas. <br>
CN1125216A discloses a process for producing dimethyl ether from methanol, comprising feeding methanol into the vaporization c6lumn to remove substances having a high boiling point and impurities, catalytically dehydrating in the presence of a composite solid acid catalyst in a multi-stags cold quenching reactor, then feeding the dehydrated product into a high performance package column for fractionation, and selecting different operation reflux ratios according to different requirements to produce a dimethyl ether product having a purity from 90 to 99.99%.<br>
CN1368493A discloses a process for producing dimethyl ether by catalytically dehydrating methanol, and relates to a process for producing dimethyl ether by catalytic dehydration of methanol, wherein the dehydration is carried out in the presence of a solid acid catalyst containing S042". In the catalyst, S042" is preferably in an amount from 2 to 25 wt%. The preferred catalyst support is selected from the group consisting of Y-AI203, N-A,2Q3 and Si02.<br>
CN1301686A discloses a process for producing dimethyl ether by dehydrating methanof, comprising using sulfuric acid modified kaolin as a catalyst for the preparation of dimethyl ether via methanol dehydration.<br>
US2004/0034255A1 discloses a process for producing dimethyl ether, which includes dehydrating methanol in vapor phase in the presence of an activated alumina catalyst having an average pore radius of 2.5 nm to 8.0 nm and having a sodium oxide content less than 0.07 wt %.<br>
Said processes above primarily concern producing dimethyl ether by dehydrating methanol via catalysis with a composite solid acid, an acid-modified kaolin, an activated alumina, and the like. Moreover, a fixed bed reactor is mainly used therein. The resultant dimethyl ether is usually used as fine chemicals. In addition, said processes have a small scale of production and a higher production cost. <br>
On the other side, the attempt of multipoint feeding has been carried out in various fixed bed methods or catalytic cracking methods. For example, US4761513 discloses a toluene alkylation method, comprising feeding the alkylation reagents from different sites of the fixed bed. In these methods, fairly big catalyst bed are needed to receive the reaction heat in order to prevent the potentially adverse effect of exothermic reaction on the product selectivity, resulting in a great increase of the device investment and operating cost. In addition, the reaction of producing dimethyl ether by dehydration of methanol is an exothermic reaction. Under the nearly adiabatic circumstance, the temperature of the catalyst bed layer gradually increases along with the proceedings of the reaction. If the reaction heat fails to be taken out or consumed timely, the pyrolytic reaction of methanol is prone to take place to produce much non-condensable gases, e.g. carbon oxides and hydrogen gas. Meanwhile, excessive high reaction temperature also results in the further dehydration of the resultant dimethyl ether to produce many low-carbon olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene and butylene, so as to render notable decrease of the selectivity of dimethyl ether.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Thus the inventor seeks for a novel process for the preparation of dimethyl ether, which is suitable for large-scale production, has high methanol conversion and dimethyl ether selectivity, and can avoid deep reaction resulting in low-carbon olefins.<br>
With extensive efforts and studies, the inventor invents a fluidized catalytic process for producing dimethyl ether by dehydration of methanol in gaseous phase on the basis of the prior art, so as to increase the methanol conversion and the selectivity of dimethyl ether.<br>
The fluidized catalytic process for producing dimethyl ether from methanol in the present invention is carried out in a reactor in which the catalyst is in a fluidized state, comprising the following steps:<br>
(1) feeding the methanol feedstock via two or more locations selected from the bottom, lower part, middle part and upper part of the reactor, contacting with the catalyst for preparation of dimethyl ether via methanol dehydration, carrying out the reaction of preparing dimethyl ether by methanol dehydration to obtain the reaction stream, separating said reaction stream to obtain a coked catalyst and a crude product primarily containing the target product, i.e. dimethyl ether; and <br>
(2) totally or partially feeding the coked catalyst obtained in step (1) into a regenerator in a continuous or batch manner for regeneration via coke-burning, the regenerated catalyst being directly recycled to step (1) after being totally or partially cooled.<br>
Said methanol feedstock contains from 5 to 100 wt.%, preferably from 50 to 100 wt.%, more preferably from 90 to 100 wt.% of methanol, and may contain a small amount of impurities such as water the like. Said methanol feedstock is derived from crude methanol produced by gasification and synthesis from various fossil fuels, such as natural gas, coal, oil sand, petroleum oil and the like, or derived from other sources. Methanol in the present invention can be fed in a liquid phase, or in a gaseous phase after the heat exchange with the reaction product or other heat sources.<br>
The reactor of the present invention comprises a riser reactor, a fluidized bed reactor, a composite riser + fluidized bed reactor, or other modified versions thereof, wherein said riser and fluidized bed may be isodiametric risers and fluidized beds, or various diameter-variable risers and fluidized beds.<br>
The present invention preferably applies a composite riser (also referred to as "rising device") + fluidized bed reactor, wherein the reactor is arranged in a manner that the fluidized bed reactor is disposed at the top of the riser. Under the circumstance that a part of the coked catalyst is fed into the regenerator for regeneration via coke-burning in step (2), the remaining coked catalyst is cooled and recycled to the bottom of the reactor to re-participate in the reaction. At this time, a first catalyst mixing device may be disposed at the bottom of the riser. Due to such arrangement, the cooled coked catalyst can be quickly mixed with the regenerated catalyst from the regenerator, and the mixed catalyst and feedstock can be quickly risen to the fluidized bed reactor via the riser, so as to enable the temperature distribution and the catalyst activity distribution in the whole reactor to be more uniform than those in a single fluidized bed reactor. Meanwhile, since the catalyst and reactant stream in the riser move upward in an axial direction of the riser in a manner similar to piston flow and lead to less back-mixing, the use of the riser + fluidized bed reactor efficiently controls the reaction depth, so as to enable the dehydration reaction to more evenly release heat at different positions in the axial direction of the reactor and to have notable effect on increasing the single-pass conversion rate of methanol and the selectivity of dimethyl ether. Said methanol feedstock in step (1) is preferably fed from any two or more locations selected from the <br>
bottom of the first catalyst mixing device, the lower part of the riser, the middle part of the riser, the upper part of the riser, and the fluidized bed reactor, more preferably from said two to four locations.<br>
The relative ratios of the methanol charging rate at different feeding locations should not be limited. During the multipoint feeding of the methanol material in step (1), nozzles, distributing pipe and/or distributing rings may be used.<br>
The catalyst provided in the present invention comprises zeolite-type molecular sieves or/and non-zeolite-type molecular sieves. When the catalyst comprises both zeolite-type molecular sieves and non-zeolite-type molecular sieves, the weight ratio of said non-zeolite-type molecular sieves to zeolite-type molecular sieves ranges from 0.01 to 99, preferably from 0.02 to 98.<br>

Said zeolite-type molecular sieves having a large-pore structure are selected from the group consisting of FAU-structure zeolites, BETA-structure zeolites and modifiers thereof, wherein said FAU-structure zeolites are Y-series zeolites which is one or more selected from the group consisting of Y-type zeolites, HY zeolites, REY zeolites, REHY zeolites, USY zeolites, REUSY zeolites and modifiers thereof.<br>

Said non-zeolite-type molecular sieve is a silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve, e.g. selected from one or more of SAPO-34, SAPO-11, SAPO-17, SAPO-41 and SAPO- 44. Said molecular sieve may be a commercially available product, or may be prepared by any of the current methods. In addition, said non-zeolite-type molecular<br><br><br>

The catalyst provided according to the present invention may comprise a matrix acting as a binder, diluent and support in the catalyst. Said matrix is optionally one or more selected from various heat resistant inorganic oxides commonly used as the catalyst support and/or matrix, e.g. one or more selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, titanium oxide, magnesia, alumina-magnesia, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titanium oxide, silica-zirconia, titanium oxide-zirconia, silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina- titanium oxide, silica-alumina-magnesia, silica-alumina-zirconia, natural zeolite, synthetic zeolite molecular sieve, non-zeolite-type molecular sieve and clay, preferably one selected from synthetic zeolite molecular sieve, non-zeolite-type molecular sieve, silica, alumina and silica-alumina, or the compounds thereof. On the basis of the total weight of the catalyst, the content of said matrix components which are preferably one or more selected from alumina, silica and silica-alumina is not more than 95 wt%, preferably from 10 wt% to 90 wt%.<br>
The catalyst provided according to the present invention may optionally comprises one or more metal components selected from the group consisting of non- aluminum metals from Group IIIA, metals from Group IVA, metals from Group VA, metals from Group MB, metals from Group IVB, metals from Group VIB, metals from Group VIIB, metals from Group VIII and rare earth metals, preferably one or more selected from iron, gallium, germanium, tin, zirconium, copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, lanthanum, cerium, lanthanum-enriched mixed rare earth metals and cerium-enriched mixed rare earth metals.

The reaction is carried out at a temperature from 100 to 550□, preferably from 150 to 380□, more preferably from 180 to 350□, and at a pressure from 1 to 1500kPa, preferably from 1 to 1000kPa (the pressures in the present invention all refer to gauge pressures), wherein the weight ratio of the catalyst to alcohol feedstock (catalyst/alcohol ratio) is from 0.001 to 50, preferably from 0.005 to 40, and the total weight hourly space velocity is from 0.01 to 100h-1, preferably from 0.1 to 50h-<br>
The part of coked catalyst which is sent to the coke-burning step accounts for 0.5 to 100%of total weight of the coked catalyst. Under the circumstance that a part of the coked catalyst is fed into the regenerator for regeneration via coke-burning, the remaining coked catalyst is cooled and recycled to the bottom of the reactor to re- participate in.the reaction, wherein said part of the coked catalyst for regeneration accounts for 0.5 to 99%of total weight of the coked catalyst.<br>
Said regeneration is a single-stage or two-stage regeneration, and said<br>
io	■ 20 oct 2009 <br>
regenerated catalyst is a partially regenerated catalyst (i.e. semi-regenerated catalyst) or/and totally regenerated catalyst.<br>
The part of the regenerated catalyst directly recycled to step (1) after being cooled accounts for 0.5 to 100%of total weight of the regenerated catalyst. While a part of the regenerated catalyst in step (2) is directly recycled to step (1), the other part of regenerated catalyst is cooled and then recycled to step (1) mixed with the fresh catalyst.<br>
Said catalyst is one or more selected from the group consisting of the regenerated catalyst, fresh catalyst, semi-regenerated catalyst and coked catalyst.<br>
The regenerated catalyst recycled to the reactor is cooled to a temperature from 100 to 650□ via direct or indirect heat exchange. Direct heat exchange refers to heat exchange by directly contacting air having a lower temperature with the regenerated catalyst, wherein said air is the whole or partial of the air compressed with an air compressor and fed into the regenerator, i.e. preheating the air fed into the regenerator by using the high temperature heat energy of partial regenerated catalyst. Said direct heat exchanger is in a form of a fluidized bed or a riser, and the cooled catalyst separated by a cyclone separator is fed into the fluidized bed reactor after the impurity gases (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and the like) are stripped with hot water vapour. Indirect heat exchange refers to the use of a heat exchanger, wherein the hot catalyst passes through the tube pass, and water vapour passes through the shell pass.<br>
In the process of the present invention, since the dehydration of methanol is an exothermic reaction, and the temperature of the catalyst bed will increase, some means need to be taken to control the temperature increase of the catalyst bed in order to avoid the effect of the temperature increase on the dimethyl ether selectivity, wherein said means include increasing the catalyst replacement rate, multipoint feeding of methanol, releasing the heat emitted during the dehydration of methanol via a heat remover. Said heat remover may be a coil pipe disposed in the catalyst bed, wherein the feed methanol vapor, or water vapor may pass through the tube pass.<br>
In the process of the present invention, methanol is dehydrated, and the reaction product is separated to obtain the gas product primarily containing dimethyl ether. Said gas product can be directly used as fuels such as civil liquefied gas and the like, or further separated to obtain dimethyl ether having a high purity as fine chemicals. The liquid phase product obtained by separation is recycled to the methanol dehydration reactor for further reaction.<br>
According to the fluidized catalytic process for producing dimethyl ether from methanol, the reaction temperature of the catalyst bed can be efficiently controlled by controlling the feeding manner of the feedstock, the reaction conditions and selecting suitable reaction device and catalyst. Thus the heat released from such dehydration is more evenly distributed at different positions in the axial direction of the reactor, so as to avoid the occurrence of local high temperature in the reactor and of the deep dehydration reaction (e.g. production of low-carbon olefins) and to reduce carbon deposit on the catalyst and to prolong the service life of the catalyst. In addition, the process of the present invention can ensure large-scale production of dimethyl ether. Without prejudice to the present invention, the application of the process of the present invention by reference to the mature fluidized bed reaction technology can enable the yield of dimethyl ether in a single fluidized bed reactor to be more than 1000,000 ton/year, so that the process of the present invention is suitable for industrial application. In the present invention, the single-pass conversion of methanol is generally more than 80%, and the selectivity of dimethyl ether is more than 98%. Under preferred conditions, the single-pass conversion of methanol is as high as 84.72%, and the selectivity of dimethyl ether is as high as 99.25%.<br>
