				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present disclosure relates to a material for cutting details with high demands on,<br>
among other things, corrosion resistance and hardness. Details of the material should be<br>
possible to be made by photoetching, and in order to meet these demands, a very particular<br>
combination of properties is required according to the discussion below.<br>
When first studying what is required for a material to be suitable for cutting tools, the<br>
hardness is ot great importance. A harder material resists plastic deformation better, which<br>
is a common degradation mechanism for cutting edges - that they simply bend and/or are<br>
deflected when stressed. Furthermore, a harder material will resist wear better and thereby<br>
an edge will remain sharp longer, or in other words, have better edge durability. An addi-<br>
tional advantage of a harder material is that the normally seen decreasing toughness gives<br>
an improved burr breaking in mechanical grinding and polishing, whereby a sharper edge<br>
may be obtained. An absolute minimum in hardness of a material intended for edges with<br>
demands on edge durability and possibility of mechanical sharpening is judged to be 56<br>
HRC (hardness on the Rockwell C-scale, which corresponds to approx. 615 HV 1 kg<br>
measured as hardness in Vickers with the load of 1 kg).<br>
A factor that further drastically affects the edge durability of a material is the presence of<br>
hard particles (carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides which henceforth are denominated<br>
jointly as carbonitrides) in the material. An increasing volume fraction of carbonitrides<br>
gives a material having better edge durability. However, there are limitations that have to<br>
be taken into consideration - the possibility again of making a truly sharp edge by<br>
mechanical machining or photoetching. In mechanical machining of edges having small<br>
edge angles (
inclusions), of a diameter larger than 10 µm, cause tear outs and edge damage, the initial<br>
sharpness of the edge drastically being deteriorated. For the manufacture of edges by<br>
etching, the demands are even greater. In photoetching, which is suitable for the manu-<br>
facture of complex details in thin materials, parts of the material surface are protected by a<br>
protection film. On the areas that are unprotected, the etching medium (for instance a<br>
mixture of HCl and FeCl3), which is sprayed on the surface, is allowed to make a chemical<br>
processing. By virtue of the different electrochemical properties of the bulk mass and the<br><br><br>
carbonitrides, the etching will be accelerated in the border between bulk mass and<br>
earbonitride. This entails that the carbonitrides risk being etched out of the material. In<br>
order for this phenomenon not to affect the finished product negatively, carbonitrides of a<br>
diameter larger than 5 µm must not be present in the material. A usual cause of large<br>
carbonitrides is alloying additives of very strong carbide formers, such as, for instance,<br>
vanadium, and therefore this type of alloying elements should preferably be avoided.<br>
Another cause of large carbonitrides is poor process control when casting and hot working<br>
the materials. Large (0 &gt; 10 µm) carbonitrides, above all angular primary carbides formed<br>
in the casting, also limits the possibility of polishing the material shiny.<br>
Upon corrosion attacks on martensitic stainless chromium steel, they are most often of the<br>
type pitting corrosion. The three most important alloying elements to control this corrosion<br>
type are chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen. A frequently used measurement of the<br>
resistance against pitting corrosion is the PRE-value (Pitting Resistance Equivalent),<br>
PRE =% Cr + 3,3● % Mo + 16 ● % N. Experience shows that the PRE-value according to<br>
the expression above should be above 25 for martensitic chromium steels in order to attain<br>
a sufficient corrosion resistance in an environment of chloride ions.<br>
An additional demand on the material according to the present invention is that it, in a<br>
cost-effective and quality-assured way, should be possible to harden by a continuous<br>
process (strip widths up to 1000 mm and strip thicknesses down to 15 µm) including<br>
furnace for the austenitizing, quenching for the conversion to martensite and finally a fur-<br>
nace for tempering. In the austenitizing, the carbonitrides in the material are dissolved to a<br>
certain extent and the contents of alloying elements increase in the matrix. In order for this<br>
dissolution to occur evenly (enables good dimensional tolerances) and within a short time<br>
(high productivity), it is required that the carbonitrides are small in size (Ø 
furthermore that the size distribution is even, which is controlled by an accurately con-<br>
trolled production process. The production process for the material includes melting of<br>
raw materials in an electric arc furnace alternatively a high frequency furnace. The content<br>
of carbon in the material can be controlled by choice of raw materials or by carbon<br>
elimination either in AOD (Argon Oxygen Decarburization), CLU (Creusot Loire<br>
Uddeholm) or another refining process. As an alternative, the material may be remelted in<br><br><br>
a secondary metallurgical process such as VIM (Vacuum Induction Melting), VAR<br>
(Vacuum Arc Remelting), ESR (Electroslag Remelting), or the like. Casting may take<br>
place in the traditional way into ingot or by continuous casting. A first strong reduction is<br>
made in the warm state, and then the material is spheroidized. Next, cold rolling is carried<br>
out in a plurality of steps including intermediate annealing operations. The material may<br>
be delivered to customer either in cold-rolled, annealed, or hardened and tempered form.<br>
The stainless martensitic chromium steel according to the discussion above has advantages<br>
to austenitic materials for the manufacture of details by photochemical processing. These<br>
advantages are, among other things, that the material after hardening has a very good<br>
flatness and is almost strain free. The material also allows a good productivity for this type<br>
of machining.<br>
In order to be able to meet the demands above and simultaneously produce a finished<br>
material in strip form in a cost-effective way, a very accurate optimization is required of<br>
above all alloying elements, but also process parameters. For the production cost to end up<br>
on a reasonable level, it is required that the material can be produced by a normal (non-<br>
pressurized) metallurgical process. This gives a practical limitation in the content of nitro-<br>
gen of maximum 0,20 % by weight, in a well-controlled process. Therefore, the content of<br>
nitrogen should be between 0,15-0,20 % by weight. The hardness of the material in the<br>
hardened form is substantially determined by the content (carbon + nitrogen) in % by<br>
weight, and in order to be able to attain a hardness of over 56 HRC without deep freezing,<br>
with sufficient remaining volume fraction of carbonitrides for the edge durability, this sum<br>
has to be greater than 0,55 % by weight, provided that high contents of carbonitride<br>
formers such as chromium and molybdenum are pres??ent. This entails that the content of<br>
carbon generally has to be above 0,40 % by weight and that the ratio of carbon to nitrogen<br>
becomes greater than 2. With this relatively high content of carbon, the carbon activity has<br>
to be limited for avoiding formation of primary carbides in the solidification, which is<br>
provided by keeping the content of silicon low, i.e. within the interval of 0,1-1,0%,<br>
preferably 0,1-0,80 %, most preferably 0,15-0,55 %, by weight. In the hardening, the<br>
material is austenitized at 950-1150 °C, preferably 1000-1070 °C, and then quenched<br>
(suitably in oil, between cooling clamps or by means of compressed air) to room<br>
temperature. A tempering is made at about 200 °C in order to achieve a hardness &gt; 56<br><br><br>
HRC. With deep freezing to -80 °C before tempering, an additional hardness enhancement<br>
of about 2 HRC can be attained.<br>
Chromium has to be added to the material in a sufficient quantity in order to form a<br>
corrosion-protecting oxide film on the material surface, but at high contents of chromium,<br>
again the risk of the formation of large primary carbides arises, which has to be avoided.<br>
Therefore, the content of chromium should be 12-15 %, preferably 13-15 %, most<br>
preferably 14-15 %, by weight. Molybdenum is then added in sufficient quantity to give a<br>
PRE &gt; 25. A suitable content of Mo is 2,5-4,0 %, preferably 2,6-4,0 %, most preferably<br>
2,6-3,0 %, by weight/At high additions of molybdenum and nitrogen, it is risked that the<br>
hot working properties of the material are deteriorated, and in order to limit this risk, other<br>
elements having similar effect should be kept on a minimal level - the content of copper<br>
has to, for instance, be kept below 0,1 % by weight. Nickel and cobalt are expensive<br>
alloying materials, which are stable in a normal metallurgical process, which means that<br>
the contents are accumulated over time in steel making based on recycled steel. For<br>
stainless steels, there are limitations as regards the content of nickel of max 1 % in order<br>
for the material not to be classified as potential carcinogenic and allergenic according to<br>
the Euro directive 99/45/EC, and therefore this content has been set as a maximum content<br>
regarding nickel for the alloy according to the patent. Preferably, nickel is not added<br>
actively in the material and the content of nickel is determined to max. 0,7 % in order to<br>
avoid the austenite stabilization that otherwise would be the consequence. The alloy also<br>
contains 0,1-1,0 %, preferably 0,4-0,8 %, most preferably 0,4-0,7 %, by weight, of Mn<br>
which is another element that stabilizes the austenite. The maximum content of cobalt has<br>
been set to 4 %, on one hand because of the expense and on the other hand to avoid too a<br>
fast accumulation of cobalt in the processing of recycled steel depending on the element<br>
normally being seen as an impurity in stainless steel, above all within the nuclear power<br>
industry. Preferably, cobalt is not added actively in the material and the content of cobalt<br>
is set to max 0,5 %, in spite of the increasing impact of the element on the martensite<br>
formation temperature. Hence, an addition of cobalt may displace the phase transformation<br>
upon cooling after hardening toward more martensite.<br><br><br>
In consideration of today's standard materials, it is observed that it is very few that meet<br>
the demand PRE &gt; 25 in combination with HRC &gt; 56. Adding the demand on carboni-<br>
trides Ø 
440 C meet, for instance, only the demand on hardness. In order to meet the demands on<br>
PRE-value and carbonitrides according to the above, there are only austenitic and duplex<br>
materials available, but in these, the hardness and the edge durability is, however,<br>
inadequate.<br>
Upon an examination of other patent specifications within this area, in particular the<br>
following four have been noticed. DE-A-39 01 470 discloses a material suited for, among<br>
other things, razor blades and knives. However, the patent teaches a pressurized<br>
metallurgy in order to achieve contents of nitrogen above 0,20 % by weight, and thereby<br>
maximally twice as high content of carbon as of nitrogen. Furthermore, two experimental<br>
alloys are mentioned, both with hardness below 600 HV. The patent also teaches additions<br>
of vanadium in low contents. Therefore, the material will not meet the above-mentioned<br>
demand on hardness and avoidance of the alloy element vanadium, and furthermore, the<br>
production cost will become very high. According to EP-A-638 658, vanadium is used in<br>
order to achieve a strong secondary hardening upon tempering to high temperatures, which<br>
may be an advantage, for instance if the material is to be coated or used at high<br>
temperatures. However, this is objectionable if the material is to be etched into final form<br>
or be used to produce very sharp edges, according to the above. The patent states 40 µm as<br>
the largest allowable size of carbonitrides unlike the 5 µm stated as the maximum limit<br>
according to the present invention. EP-A-750 687 states the maximum content (carbon +<br>
nitrogen) to 0,55 % by weight, which according to the pres??ent invention is judged to be<br>
a minimal content in order to achieve sufficient hardness. This is confirmed by the fact<br>
that the aim what relates to hardness in the EP publication is HRC &gt; 50, and that the<br>
experimental alloy that achieves the highest hardness reaches 56,3 HRC (this is after<br>
tempering for 1 h at only 180 °C). This limited hardness in combination with a small share<br>
of remaining carbonitrides will cause inadequate edge durability for edge applications with<br>
high demands. Foremost, the patent specification also focuses articles with extremely high<br>
demands on corrosion resistance, why also copper has been added, and therefore the<br>
hardness and the hot workability has been neglected. As regards the patent specification<br><br><br>
US-A-6 235 237, which above all relates to steel edges for skis with demands on damping,<br>
the combination of high content of chromium, low content of molybdenum and low<br>
content of nitrogen gives a hardness below 50 HRC according to the examples in the<br>
patent specification, and thereby inadequate edge durability for edge applications with<br>
high demands.<br>
Thus, a first object of the present invention is to provide a new steel alloy, which<br>
overcomes all the above-mentioned drawbacks of prior art.<br>
In particular, the object of the present invention is to provide a steel alloy that has a<br>
hardness of at least 56 HRC, has excellent corrosion resistance and can be machined by<br>
means of photoetching.<br>
In a surprising way for a person skilled in the art, these and additional objects have<br>
succeeded to be attained by providing a steel alloy according to the following composition<br>
(in % by weight):<br><br>
the hardness &gt; 56 HRC being attained without deep freezing, as well as PRE &gt; 25, defined<br>
as PRE = % Cr + 3,3 • % Mo + 16 • % N. The balance to achieve 100 % consists of iron<br>
and normally occurring impurities due to the raw material and/or the manufacturing<br>
process. Preferably, it is considered that the maximum size of carbides, nitrides and<br>
carbonitrides is Ø 
able to dissolve the carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides during austenitisation.<br><br>
Preferably, the steel alloy according to the present invention has the following<br>
composition (in % by weight):<br><br>
as well as the balance Fe and normally occurring impurities.<br>
Even more preferred, the steel alloy according to the present invention has the following<br>
composition (in % by weight):<br><br>
as well as the balance Fe and normally occurring impurities.<br>
Materials manufactured according to the present disclosure are especially suitable for the<br>
use in applications such as, for instance, knives in the food industry having high demands<br>
on hardness and edge durability in combination with corrosion resistance due to chloride<br><br>
ion-containing environment as well as corrosive dishwashing detergents. Other areas are<br>
cutting edges for dry and wet shaving, surgical edge applications as well as diving knives.<br>
Additional fields of application for the new material are, for instance, doctor blades in the<br>
printing industry as well as doctor blades (also known as coater blades) and creping blades<br>
in the pulp industry.<br>
Choice of way of manufacture of the material depends, among other things, on desired<br>
material volume, maximum allowed production cost and demands on slag purity. Cus-<br>
tomer requirements such as hardened and tempered, and cold-rolled, respectively, finish,<br>
naturally has also an effect. However, the manufacture will always comprise a metallurgi-<br>
cal process at normal atmospheric pressure (1 atm = 1 bar). The metallurgical process<br>
comprises melting in an electric arc furnace or a high frequency furnace. The content of<br>
carbon is adjusted either by the choice of alloying materials or by carbon elimination in<br>
AOD or CLU or another refining process. The content of nitrogen is adjusted either by the<br>
supply in the form of gas or by the use of nitrogenous alloying materials. Alternatively, the<br>
material may be remelted in a secondary metallurgical process such as VIM, VAR, ESR or<br>
the like. Casting may be effected into ingot or via continuous casting, and then hot<br>
working follows down to strip form. After the hot working, the material is spheroidized<br>
and then cold-rolled in a plurality of steps into desired thickness including intermediate<br>
recrystallization annealing operations. Upon customer want of a hardened and tempered<br>
delivery finish, this hardening takes place in a continuous strip process in the form of an<br>
austenitizing in protective atmosphere, a quenching (for the phase transformation into<br>
martensite), and finally a tempering to desired hardness. The material is then cut into<br>
desired widths or is cut into planar lengths depending on the customer want. The final<br>
product may be produced by any conventional process; for example, from hardened strip<br>
material by photoetching and forming, or from cold-rolled strip material by<br>
punching/cutting, forming, hardening, tempering and finally grinding. It is also<br>
conceivable to sell the material in the wire, tube or ingot form.<br>

microstructure of the composition.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a comparison between Alloy 1 and two comparative examples<br>
with regard to the hardness levels and structures.<br>
Example 1<br>
One melt of material of the present disclosure, Alloy 1, has been produced in ten<br>
ton scale with CLU-metallurgy. The material has been ingot casted, hot rolled and<br>
thereafter cold rolled with intermediate annealings down to suitable thickness for<br>
evaluation. The melt of the present invention has the composition as indicated in Table 1,<br>
Alloy 1. The material according to the present disclosure is compared with three grades:<br>
Comparative examples 1-3. The nominal composition of the comparative examples 1-3 is<br>
also given in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
A general outline between the comparative examples is illustrated in Figure 1,<br>
showing the hardness versus corrosion resistance as well as the influence of the alloying<br>
elements C, N, Cr and Mo.<br><br><br><br>
For evaluation of corrosion resistance and cutting ability for the material according<br>
to the present disclosure six knife blades were produced and evaluated according to ISO<br>
8442.1 and ISO 8442.5. Three blades (A-C) were produced in material from Alloy 1,<br>
hardened at 1055°C, deep frozen, and tempered at 275 °C to reach hardness between<br>
58 - 58,5 HRC. Three blades (D-F) were also produced in the composition according to<br>
Comparative example 1 hardened at 1080°C, deep frozen, and tempered at 230°C to reach<br>
hardness between 58 - 58,5 HRC. All the blades were ground and finished in the same<br>
equipment to produce comparable edges and finishes. The result from the test is shown in<br>
the Table 2.<br>
The corrosion test according to ISO 8442.1 shows that the material according to<br>
the present disclosure passes the test whereas the Comparative example 1 fails in the test.<br>
The results from the edge testing according to ISO 8442.5 are on the very same level for<br>
the new grade and for Comparative example 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
The corrosion properties of the material of the present disclosure were also<br>
measured by anodic polarization/critical pitting potential (CPP) and compared with<br>
Comparative example 1 and Comparative example 2. Samples were taken from Alloy 1<br>
and from Comparative example 1 and Comparative example 2 respectively, all<br>
compositions given in Table 1. The sample of Alloy 1 was hardened at 1035°C, the<br>
samples of Comparative example 1 were hardened at 1080°C, and the samples of<br>
Comparative example 2 were hardened at 1030°C, according to recommendation for each<br><br>
alloy. The tempering for all grades was performed at 225°C. All surfaces of the samples<br>
were finished with 600 grit wet grinding. The test solution was 0,1% NaCl, the test was<br>
performed at 20°C, and the potential over the sample was increased with 75 mV/minute<br>
with a start at -600 mV. Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the solution to reduce the<br>
oxygen level. The criteria used for start of pitting was set to I &gt; 10 µA/cm2. The result<br>
from the test is shown in Figure 2.<br>
 Example 3<br>
Hardening tests were performed on material of Alloy 1 and compared with typical<br>
data for Comparative example 1, Comparative example 2 and Comparative example 3.<br>
The hardening of Alloy 1 was done at 1035°C and quenching to 20°C, but also at 1055°C<br>
in combination with deep freezing at -70°C. The hardness is shown in Figure 3 as a<br>
function of tempering temperature after tempering for 30 minutes.<br>
It can be seen that for all normal tempering temperatures in the range 175-450°C<br>
Alloy 1 has a higher hardness than Comparative example 1 and Comparative example 2.<br>
For tempering temperatures above 225°C the hardness for Alloy 1 is also higher than for<br>
Comparative example 3 because of an improved tempering resistance of Alloy 1 caused by<br>
the high alloy contents of molybdenum and nitrogen, which makes it less sensitive to high<br>
temperatures. This bonus of an improved tempering resistance of Alloy 1 can be highly<br>
beneficial for example in products where surface coating by PVD or with PTFE is<br>
involved.<br>
Example 4<br>
In Figure 4, Alloy 1 is compared with Comparative example 1 and Comparative<br>
example 2 with regard of corrosion resistance and hardness. All samples were tempered at<br>
225°C and heat treated as described above. It is desired that the composition possesses a<br>
high corrosion resistance as well as a high hardness. This is illustrated by an arrow in<br>
Figure 4 showing the desired direction of the properties. It is easily seen that Alloy 1 of<br><br><br>
the present invention combines an improved hardness as compared with Comparative<br>
example 1 with an improved corrosion resistance as compared with Comparative example<br>
2.<br>
The typical microstructure for material of Alloy 1 in the annealed condition is a<br>
ferritic matrix with uniformly distributed secondary carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides.<br>
Furthermore, the microstructure of Alloy 1 is free from primary carbides, nitrides or<br>
carbonitrides with a diameter bigger than 5 µm. A typical structure of Alloy 1 is shown in<br>
Figure 5, wherein the microphotograph is taken in light optical microscope at 1000 x<br>
magnification after polishing and etching of a transverse cross section. Etching was done<br>
in 4% Picric acid with a minor addition of hydrochloric acid. The average diameter of the<br>
carbides, nitrides and/or carbonitrides was estimated to approximately 0,4 µm.<br>
For edge applications where very keen edges are to be produced either by<br>
mechanical methods or by etching the above structure free from primary carbides with a<br>
diameter larger than 5 µm is necessary to avoid tear outs or etching defects on the edge.<br>
As a comparison a microphotograph, taken under the same conditions, showing the typical<br>
structure for Comparative example 3 is shown in Figure 6.<br>
In Figure 7 the hardness levels and structures are compared for Alloy 1 of the<br>
invention, Comparative example 1 and Comparative example 3.<br>
Example 5<br>
Since the properties of the steel are highly dependent on the hardening conditions,<br>
estimations outgoing from the basic chemical composition may be misleading.<br>
Equilibrium calculations at a predetermined suitable hardening temperature using the<br>
software ThermoCalc is one way to more accurately calculate the final properties and have<br>
been performed for Alloys 2-6, Alloy 1, as well as Comparative examples 1-3. The<br><br><br>
compositions of Alloys 2-6 are given in Table 3 and the results of the calculations are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br>
The database used has been TCFE3. Optimal hardening temperatures have been<br>
selected and used in the modelling for the different grades. Outgoing from the austenite<br>
phase composition at hardening temperature, values for PRE, Ms and weight percent of the<br>
interstitials nitrogen and carbon have been calculated. Also the phase percentage of M23C6<br>
carbide in equilibrium with the austenitic phase, which is an important factor for wear and<br>
edge durability, has been calculated. For PRE, the previously discussed equation has been<br>
used. Ms was calculated using Andrew's formula, as shown below:<br><br>
Comparison between Alloy 1 and Comparative example 1 shows that the steel<br>
according to the invention has significantly higher PRE-values but at the same time<br>
comparable interstitial content and amount of carbide phase, which should result in a steel<br>
with similar hardness and edge performance but significantly increased corrosion<br><br>
resistance. Comparative example 2 is closer to Alloy 1 in PRE but the lower amount of<br>
'interstitials in the matrix together with a lower amount of carbide phase predicts a lower<br>
hardness and inferior edge properties. These data correspond to the actual measurements<br>
in the previous example. The Ms-temperature for Alloy 1 is lower than both Comparative<br>
example 2 and Comparative example 1 but in the same range as Comparative example 3,<br>
which has a known good hardenability, but where the carbide content significantly higher<br>
resulting in a coarser microstructure as shown before in Figure 6.<br><br><br><br>
Alloys 2-6 are other possible embodiments of the composition according to the<br>
present disclosure, that result in different properties even though the difference in<br>
chemical composition is small. Alloys 2 and 4 have comparable values for PRE, interstitial<br>
content and Ms, which results in similar corrosion resistance, hardness and hardenability<br>
but with about twice the amount of M23C6 carbides in Alloy 4, the edge durability will be<br>
higher in this grade. Highest amount of interstitials in the matrix and thus the highest<br>
expected hardness is achieved in Alloy 3, which still has a sufficient hardenability due to<br>
the addition of Cobalt. Alloy 5 has even higher amount of cobalt compared to Alloy 6,<br>
which improves the hardenability even further without drastically changing the other<br>
properties.	<br><br>
