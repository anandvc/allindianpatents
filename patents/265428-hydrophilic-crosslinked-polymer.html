Hydrophilic crosslinked polymer<br>
The present invention relates to a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, prefera-<br>
bly in the form of porous particles, and to the preparation and use thereof.<br>
The polymer according to the invention is produced by polymerisation from<br>
chain-forming hydrophilic vinyl ethers and crosslinking N,N'-divinyl com-<br>
pounds, preferably heterocyclic N,N'-divinyl compounds.<br>
Hydrophilic, crosslinked, polymeric support materials are frequently em-<br>
ployed in areas such as chromatography, solid-phase synthesis or cataly-<br>
sis. In particular for use as support material in chromatography, polymers of<br>
this type should have the following properties:<br>
-	the materials should be sufficiently hydrophilic that, in particular, use in<br>
biochromatography is possible<br>
-	it should be possible for the materials to be modified, if required, by<br>
means of separation effectors in order that their separation properties<br>
can be matched to the particular separation problem<br>
-	the polymer must be sufficiently stable to hydrolysis<br>
-	in particular for applications in the area of high-pressure liquid chroma-<br>
tography, the material must have adequate pressure/flow stability<br>
-	the materials should have adequate pore sizes<br>
In addition, it should be possible to prepare polymers of this type in as<br>
simple and reproducible a manner as possible.<br>
WO 03/104294 discloses polyvinyl ethers, in particular for use in solid-<br>
phase synthesis. The polymers disclosed usually exhibit very strong swell-<br>
ing behaviour.<br>
DE 37 14 276 and DE 3344912 disclose crosslinked polymers based on<br>
vinyl acetates. In order to produce a hydrophilic polymer, the acetate<br>
groups have to be saponified subsequently.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-2-<br>
WO 9513861 discloses polyvinyl ethers for separation purposes which are<br>
prepared by cationic polymerisation. The cationic polymerisation described<br>
must be carried out in combination with complex protecting-group chemis-<br>
try.<br>
EP 0 266 503 discloses crosslinked polymers which are prepared by means<br>
of suspension polymerisation from monomers containing epoxide groups.<br>
The resultant polymers containing epoxide groups can then be used for the<br>
immobilisation of biologically active substances.<br>
EP 0 482 339 discloses a copolymer based on allyl monomers. In particu-<br>
lar, the copolymer based on EP 0 482 339 comprising 1,2,-dihydroxy-3-<br>
allyloxypropane and N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide, commercially available<br>
under the name FractoPrepÂ® (Merck KGaA, Germany), exhibits good prop-<br>
erties for biochromatography with respect to hydrophilicity, stability to<br>
hydrolysis and pressure/flow stability. However, the disadvantage of this<br>
material is the complex preparation process by means of inverse suspen-<br>
sion polymerisation.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to provide a hydrophilic<br>
polymeric support material which meets the above-mentioned requirements<br>
with respect to porosity, hydrophilicity, stability to hydrolysis and pressure/<br>
flow stability and in addition is simple to prepare.<br>
It has been found that copolymerisation of hydrophilically substituted alkyl<br>
vinyl ethers using crosslinking, preferably heterocyclic N,N'-divinyl com-<br>
pounds enables the preparation of hydrophiiic polymers having good prop-<br>
erties, in particular for biochromatography. The polymers are preferably<br>
prepared by means of suspension polymerisation.<br><br>

This means the polymer is formed by copolymerisation of at least one com-<br>
pound from the group of the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ethers of<br>
the formula I and at least one compound from the group of the crosslinking<br>
agents of the formula II and/or III and/or IV. Preferably, only one compound<br>
from the group of the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ethers of the<br>
formula I and one compound from the group of the crosslinking agents of<br>
the formula II, III or IV is employed. However, it is also possible to employ<br>
one or more compounds from the group of the hydrophilically substituted<br>
alkyl vinyl ethers of the formula I and/or one or more compounds from the<br>
group of the crosslinking agents of the formula II and/or III and/or IV. Fur-<br>
thermore, further polymerisable compounds which are copolymerised into<br>
the polymer backbone can be added to the polymerisation mixture. These<br>
are typically compounds having at least one polymerisable double bond.<br>
Preferably, only one compound from the group of the hydrophilically sub-<br>
stituted alkyl vinyl ethers of the formula I and one compound from the group<br>
of the crosslinking agents of the formula II, III or IV is employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ether<br>
employed is a compound of the formula I in which R4 is a radical which car-<br>
ries a hydroxyl group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ether<br>
employed is 1,2-ethanediol monovinyl ether, 1,3-propanediol monovinyl<br>
ether, 1,4-butanediol monovinyl ether, 1,5-pentanediol monovinyl ether,<br>
1,6-hexanediol monovinyl ether or diethylene glycol monovinyl ether and<br>
the cycloaliphatic vinyl ether employed is cyclohexanedimethanol mono-<br>
vinyl ether, particularly preferably 1,4-butanediol monovinyl ether, 1,5-<br>
pentanediol monovinyl ether, diethylene glycol monovinyl ether or cyclo-<br>
hexanedimethanol monovinyl ether.<br>
The crosslinking agents employed are preferably compounds of the formula<br>
il. Preference is given to the use of divinylpropyleneurea (1,3-divinyl-tetra-<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-15-<br>
hydropyrimidin-2-one) or particularly preferably divinylethyleneurea (1,3-<br>
divinylimidazolin-2-one).<br>
The proportion of the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ethers with<br>
respect to the weight of the polymer is typically between 1 % (by weight)<br>
and 90% (by weight) or a maximum proportion by weight of the alkyl vinyl<br>
ether which corresponds to a molar ratio of 2:1, based on a bifunctional<br>
crosslinking agent, if the alkyl vinyl ether does not homopolymerise. The<br>
proportion of the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ethers is preferably<br>
between 10 and 80% (% by weight), particularly preferably between 35 and<br>
60%. Accordingly, the proportion of the crosslinking agent is between 10<br>
and 99 (% by weight), preferably between 20 and 90%, particularly prefera-<br>
bly between 40 and 65%.<br>
The process-engineering design of the copolymerisation of unsaturated<br>
compounds is known to the person skilled in the art. To this end, a free-<br>
radical polymerisation is carried out. A suspension polymerisation initiated<br>
by free radicals, also known as bead polymerisation, is preferably carried<br>
out. Descriptions of the way in which a polymerisation of this type is carried<br>
out are given, for example, in EP 1179732 A2 (general description page 4,<br>
lines 18 to 26, and page 5, line 3, to page 6, line 9, and, in particular,<br>
Example 1) or in EP 0006199 B1 (general description page 3, line 19, to<br>
page 4, line 13, and, in particular, Example 1). Depending on the dissolu-<br>
tion behaviour of the monomers, an oil-in-water suspension polymerisation<br>
(normal-phase polymerisation) is carried out in a particularly simple proce-<br>
dure in the case of water-insoluble or sparingly water-soluble monomers,<br>
which are also known as oil. In the case of water-soluble monomers, by<br>
contrast, the latter are dissolved in water and suspended and polymerised<br>
in a water-immiscible or only sparingly water-miscible organic solvent<br>
(inverse polymerisation).<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
- 16-<br>
It has been found that, in particular in the case of the use of divinylethylene-<br>
urea or divinylpropyleneurea in combination with the preferred hydrophili-<br>
cally substituted alkyl vinyl ethers, such as 1,4-butanediol monovinyl ether,<br>
1,5-pentanediol monovinyl ether, diethylene glycol monovinyl ether or<br>
cyclohexanedimethanol monovinyl ether, a (normal-phase) suspension<br>
polymerisation can be carried out. This offers the advantage of a very<br>
simple preparation process for the polymers according to the invention<br>
since the hydrophilic polymer is obtained in a single reaction step without<br>
having to carry out the complex inverse suspension polymerisation. A<br>
further major advantage of the hydrophilically substituted alkyl vinyl ethers<br>
employed in accordance with the invention is that a subsequent hydrolysis<br>
step does not have to be carried out in order to produce a hydrophilic poly-<br>
mer. Instead, the use of the hydroxyl-containing vinyl ethers as starting<br>
materials results in the direct formation of a hydroxyl-containing polymer.<br>
The suspension polymerisation is carried out in a known manner.<br>
The suspension medium used in the normal-phase suspension polymerisa-<br>
tion is typically water.<br>
One or more stabilisers and/or one or more interface-active compounds<br>
can, as is known, be added to the suspension medium.<br>
Stabilisers which can be employed are a multiplicity of water-soluble<br>
macromolecular compounds or also finely divided inorganic compounds.<br>
Examples of macromolecular stabilisers are polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly-<br>
acrylates, polycarboxylates, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxyalkyl-<br>
cellulose, methylcellulose or polyethylene glycols. Preference is given to<br>
the use of polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Inorganic compounds which can be employed as stabilisers are, for exam-<br>
ple, calcium phosphate or magnesium hydroxide.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-17-<br>
Salts, ionic liquids or buffer substances, such as, for example, Na2HPO4<br>
and NaH2PO4, can furthermore be added to the aqueous phase.<br>
Suitable interface-active compounds are, in particular, anionic and nonionic<br>
surfactants, such as ethoxylates of long-chain alcohols, ethoxylated mono-,<br>
di- and trialkylphenols, alkali metal and ammonium salts of Ci2 - Ci8 alkyl-<br>
sulfonic acids or arylsulfonic acids.<br>
For carrying out the polymerisation according to the invention, the organic<br>
phase, also known as the oil phase, is suspended in the aqueous phase.<br>
After initiation and performance of the polymerisation, the polymer can typi-<br>
cally be filtered off or removed from the reaction mixture in another manner.<br>
Residues of solvents or other additives can be removed by washing with<br>
suitable solvents or, for example, steam distillation.<br>
In an embodiment, the oil phase comprises inert solvents (porogens) in<br>
order to set the desired pore sizes, in addition to the monomers.<br>
Suitable organic solvents (porogens) are, for example, aliphatic hydro-<br>
carbons (C6 - C18), such as, for example, hexane, dodecane or benzine<br>
mixtures, cycloaliphatic compounds, such as cyclohexane, aromatic hydro-<br>
carbons, such as toluene, ethylbenzenes or xylenes, or alcohols, such as<br>
aliphatic C4 - C12-alcohols, for example heptanol, dodecanol, cyclohexanol,<br>
polyethylene glycols or polypropylene glycols of various molecular weight.<br>
or esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids, such as butyl acetate or propyl propi-<br>
onate, or esters of aromatic carboxylic acids, such as propyl benzoate, or<br>
esters, such as butyl glycol acetate or glycerol triacetate, or ethers, such as<br>
di-n-butyl ether, di-n-amyl ether, dipheny! ether, ethylene glycoi mono-<br>
phenyl ether and ethylene glycol diethyl ether.<br>
These solvents can be employed individually or as a mixture of two or more<br>
solvents. They can either act as swelling agent or precipitant for the poly-<br>
mers and in this way influence the porosity.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-18-<br>
Examples of swelling agents for the polymers according to the invention are<br>
lower alcohols, aliphatic esters or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene.<br>
Examples of precipitants are aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as dodecane or<br>
benzine mixtures. The porosity of the polymers can be fixed through the<br>
type and amount of the solvents in combination with the degree of cross-<br>
linking of the polymer.<br>
Furthermore, one or more initiators acting as free radicals are typically<br>
added to the organic phase.<br>
Examples of free-radical initiators are organic peroxides, such as di-tert-<br>
butyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, bis(o-methylbenzoyl) peroxide, tert-butyl<br>
hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropyl peroxide dicarbonate,<br>
cyclohexanone peroxide, or aliphatic azo compounds, such as a, a'-azobis-<br>
isobutyronitrile, azobiscyanovaleric acid, 1,1'-azocyclohexane-1,1'-dicarbo-<br>
nitrile or azodicarboxamide. Preference is given to a, a'-azobisisobutyro-<br>
nitrile.<br>
Initiators which can be activated by means of radiation, for example UV<br>
radiation, can also be employed in accordance with the invention as free-<br>
radical initiators.<br>
The phase ratios in the suspension polymerisation can typically be varied in<br>
the volume ratio between 1:20 (oil phase to aqueous phase) and 2:1, ratios<br>
between 1:5 and 1:1, particularly preferably between 1:3 and 1:1, are pre-<br>
ferred.<br>
The ratio of organic solvent to monomer is typically between 1:20 and 4:1,<br>
preferably between 1:5 and 3:1, particularly preferably between 1:1 and<br>
2.5:1.<br>
The concentration of the initiator, based on the amount of monomer, is typi-<br>
cally between 0.01% (by weight) and 10% (by weight), preferably between<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-19-<br>
0.1 and 7% (by weight) and particularly preferably between 0.2 and 7% (by<br>
weight).<br>
The concentration of stabilisers, based on the amount of suspension<br>
medium, generally water, is between 0.01 and 7% (by weight), typically<br>
between 0.02 and 5% (by weight), particularly preferably between 0.05 and<br>
2.5% (by weight).<br>
The suspension polymerisation is then carried out by mixing the two phases<br>
with vigorous stirring. In addition, the temperature of the mixture is typically<br>
kept at 20 to 100Â°C, preferably 40 to 100Â°C, for a period of 1 to 20 hours.<br>
The mixture is typically heated at 40 to 100Â°C over a period of 0.5 to 5<br>
hours and subsequently post-polymerised again for several hours at 70 to<br>
100Â°C. The mixture should be stirred throughout the time. These tempera-<br>
ture data relate to a system in which water is used as suspension medium.<br>
On use of other polar solvents instead of water, other temperature ranges<br>
may be possible or appropriate, depending on the boiling point of the sol-<br>
vent.<br>
it is generally advantageous to carry out the polymerisation according to the<br>
invention in a protective-gas atmosphere.<br>
Finally, the mixture is generally cooled to room temperature, the organic<br>
solvents are removed, if they were added during the polymerisation, and<br>
the product is stored in water, an aqueous buffer or a mixture of water with<br>
an organic solvent, such as ethanol.<br>
If necessary, the polymer can be brought to the desired particle-size distri-<br>
bution by sieving or another type of classification.<br>
If an inverse suspension polymerisation or an emulsion polymerisation is to<br>
be carried out instead of the normal-phase suspension polymerisation, it is<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-20-<br>
known to the person skilled in the art how to modify the composition of the<br>
reaction solutions.<br>
The polymerisation according to the invention can likewise be carried out<br>
continuously. The particle production here is particularly preferably carried<br>
out using static mixers, in particular micromixers or caterpillar mixers. In<br>
these mixers, the spatial distribution of two components to be mixed is<br>
influenced, with utilisation of the flow energy, by the flow management, for<br>
example by separation and recombination, twisting, distortion and expan-<br>
sion, so that large interfaces are formed for diffusive exchange between the<br>
components and a particularly uniform particle-size distribution can be<br>
achieved due to the high shear forces. Different mixers and their structure<br>
are known. For example, systems of this type are described in EP 1177243.<br>
In order to carry out the reactions, the aqueous phase flows, for example,<br>
continuously with a defined volume flow through the micromixer. The oil<br>
phase is subsequently fed in via the second inlet, likewise with a defined,<br>
precisely set volume flow. The ratio of the two volume flows can be in a<br>
broad range and depends on the desired particle size, the nature and dis-<br>
tribution of the particle sizes, the viscosity of the aqueous and the oil phase,<br>
depending on the reaction temperature, and the reaction kinetics and the<br>
requisite ratio of the porogens in the end mixture in order to achieve a suit-<br>
able pore structure. The volume flow ratio between the aqueous phase and<br>
the oil phase is preferably 1:10 to 100:1, in particular 2:1 to 20:1. The sus-<br>
pension exiting from the static mixer is preferably polymerised in a continu-<br>
ously operating reactor.<br>
It is likewise possible to reverse the procedure described above. For exam-<br>
pie, for the polymerisation of particularly hydrophilic monomers, the latter<br>
are supplied via the aqueous phase. Further details on the synthesis of<br>
bead polymers with the aid of micromixers are given in EP 1177243.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-21 -<br>
It is furthermore known to the person skilled in the art how the particle size<br>
of the resultant polymer can be influenced, inter alia through the nature and<br>
amount of the addition of suspension stabilisers and interface-active com-<br>
pounds and the stirring intensity. In general, particle diameters between 3<br>
urn and 500 urn, preferably between 3 urn and 300 urn, can be produced by<br>
means of suspension polymerisation, depending on the type of stirrerand<br>
the rotational speed. The particles can have an irregular shape or can pref-<br>
erably be spherical.<br>
If the polymers according to the invention are prepared by means of emul-<br>
sion polymerisation, particle diameters, for example, between 20 nm and<br>
3000 nm, preferably between 100 and 500 nm, can be produced.<br>
The polymers according to the invention can furthermore be prepared or<br>
exist in the form of membranes, fibres, hollow fibres, a coating or as a<br>
monolithic moulding. Monolithic mouldings are three-dimensional bodies,<br>
for example in cylindrical form.<br>
The polymers according to the invention can equally be employed as com-<br>
posite materials, i.e., for example, as a coating, for example of inorganic<br>
particles, or a moulding, or mixed with, for example, inorganic constituents.<br>
An example thereof are particles of the polymer according to the invention<br>
which can themselves be magnetised by copolymerisation of magnetisable<br>
particles or of a magnetisable core.<br>
The polymers according to the invention are preferably in the form of non-<br>
porous or particularly preferably porous particles. Depending on the type<br>
and amount of the porogenic solvent employed, the pore sizes can typically<br>
be between 2 and 300 nm. In accordance with the invention, pore size<br>
denotes pore radius. Preference is given to pore sizes or pore radii bet-<br>
ween 2 and 200 nm. In particular, if the polymers according to the invention<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-22-<br>
are in the form of monolithic mouldings, they can also have pore sizes up to<br>
1000 nm.<br>
The pore distribution in the materials according to the invention can be<br>
monomodal, bimodal or oligomodal, preferably monomodal or bimodal.<br>
The pore sizes are preferably measured by means of size exclusion chro-<br>
matography (SEC). A measurement example in this respect is given in<br>
Example 3 and Figure 2.<br>
The hydrophilic, crosslinked polymers according to the invention are par-<br>
ticularly suitable as sorbents in chromatography, as support materials for<br>
the immobilisation of biologically and/or catalytically active substances or as<br>
support materials for solid-phase syntheses of, for example, biopolymers,<br>
such as nucleic acids or peptides, or for combinatorial chemistry.<br>
The materials according to the invention are distinguished by good stability<br>
to hydrolysis, in particular in basic medium, and by good pressure/flow sta-<br>
bility. Furthermore, their high hydrophilicity makes them particularly suitable<br>
for biochromatographic methods. The examples contain additional experi-<br>
mental data on these properties.<br>
The polymers according to the invention are particularly suitable as sor-<br>
bents. For this purpose, they are introduced in a known manner into chro-<br>
matography columns or capillaries. The polymer according to the invention<br>
can equally be packed in cartridges for chromatographic or other purposes.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to chromatography columns,<br>
capillaries or cartridges which contain a polymer according to the invention<br>
as sorbent or support material.<br>
The polymers according to the invention can be employed in their native<br>
form, i.e. without further derivatisation steps, for example, depending on the<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-23-<br>
porosity set, for size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or for reduction of<br>
the salt content of solutions if these solutions contain target molecules<br>
whose molecular weight differs significantly from the molecular weight of<br>
the salt,<br>
or provided with other or additional functionalities by one or more derivati-<br>
sation steps. In particular, they can be derivatised by means of separation<br>
effectors. These separation effectors may be either ionic or neutral or have<br>
a preferred affinity or selectivity for one or more target molecules.<br>
The covalent bonding of the separation effectors generally takes place via<br>
the functional groups present on the polymer, such as, for example,<br>
hydroxyl groups, for example with formation of an ester or preferably an<br>
ether function, directly or via a linker or spacer. In another preferred em-<br>
bodiment, the linking to the base material takes place via graft polymeri-<br>
sation, such as, for example, a cerium(IV)-catalysed graft polymerisation<br>
with formation of a C-C link to the base material.<br>
Separation effectors are known to the person skilled in the art in the area of<br>
chromatography. Separation effectors are substituents which can be intro-<br>
duced into the support material as early as during the synthesis of the base<br>
material or subsequently and influence the surface properties of the support<br>
material. In particular, targeted derivatisation of support materials by means<br>
of separation effectors produces support materials having certain chroma-<br>
tographic properties. In particular, separation effectors can have the fol-<br>
lowing terminal groups:<br>
a) an ionic or ionisable group, for example<br>
-NR'Rs or-N+R7R8R9,<br>
in which<br>
R7 and Rs,	independently of one another,<br>
H, alkyl having 1-5 C atoms<br>
and<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-24-<br>
Rs	alkyl having 1-5 C atoms<br>
with the proviso that, if X = -N+R?R8R9, R7 and Rs cannot be H,<br>
-	guanidinium<br>
-SO3-<br>
-	carboxylic acids<br><br>
b)	a hydrophobic group, for example -OR"! 0 or -NHR' 0, where R10 denote<br>
Ci-C2n-alkyl&gt; C6-C25-aryl, C7-C25-alkylaryl or C7-C25-arylalkyl, and<br>
where these radicals may also have been derivatised by means of nitrile<br>
or C-|-C5-alkoxy, and where, in addition, one or more non-adjacent CH2<br>
groups may have been replaced by NH or O or, in addition, one or more<br>
CH groups may have been replaced by N;<br>
c)	a metal chelate group;<br>
d)	a thiophilic radical;<br>
e)	a chiral radical.<br>
f)	biomolecules, such as proteins (for example antibodies, protein A), pep-<br>
tides, amino acids, nucleic acids, saccharides, biotin, etc.<br>
g)	organic radicals which have increased affinity or selectivity for certain tar-<br>
get molecules (for example mono- or bistriazine-based separation<br>
effectors in accordance with WO 9710887 and WO 04/052870).<br>
Thiophilic radicals are disclosed, for example, in EP 0 165 912.<br>
If it is intended firstly to provide the polymer with a universal linker, it can,<br>
for example for the introduction of epoxide groups, be reacted with glycidyl<br>
compounds, such as butanediol diglycidyl ether.<br>
Furthermore, the polymer according to the invention can, as base material,<br>
be provided by graft polymerisation with tentacle-like structures, which can<br>
in turn carry the corresponding separation effectors or be functionalised by<br>
means of the latter. The grafting is preferably carried out in accordance with<br>
EP 0 337 144. The chain produced is linked to the base material via a<br>
monomer unit. To this end, the base material according to the invention is<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-25-<br>
suspended in a solution of monomers, preferably in an aqueous solution.<br>
The grafting-on of the polymeric material is effected in the course of a con-<br>
ventional redox polymerisation with exclusion of oxygen. The polymerisa-<br>
tion catalyst employed is cerium(IV) ions, since this catalyst forms free-radi-<br>
cal sites on the surface of the base material, from which the graft polymeri-<br>
sation of the monomers is initiated.<br>
The polymerisation is terminated by termination reactions involving the<br>
cerium salts. For this reason, the (average) chain length can be influenced<br>
by the concentration ratios of the base material, the initiator and the mono-<br>
mers. Furthermore, uniform monomers or also mixtures of different mono-<br>
mers can be employed; in the latter case, grafted copolymers are formed.<br>
Suitable monomers for the preparation of the graft polymers are monomers<br>
conforming to formula V or VI.<br><br>
These monomers are (meth) acrylic acid (Y = -COOH), (meth)acrylic acid<br>
derivatives where<br><br>
aiiylamines (Y = -CH2 NH2, -CH2NR12R13), (meth)acrylonitriles (Y = -CN),<br>
acroleins (Y = - CHO), vinylcarboxylates (Y = -OCOCHR15R16) or vinylene-<br>
carbonates of the formula VI.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-26-<br>
All these monomers are polymerisable substances containing reversibly<br>
bonding groups which can be polymerised by means of free radicals in<br>
aqueous solution and which may be neutral, acidic or basic.<br>
If the monomers employed are vinylenecarbonates of the formula VI or<br>
vinylcarboxylates CR*R** = CR11-OCOCHR15R16 of the formula V, the<br>
product obtained is preferably subsequently converted into a separating<br>
material containing hydroxyl groups. This conversion into a hydroxyl phase<br>
is achieved by a mild alkaline or acidic saponification known per se. For<br>
example, the reaction can be carried out using methanolic K2CO3 solution<br>
at room temperature, described, for example, by Y. Tezuka et al., in<br>
Macromol. Chem. 186, 685-694 (1985).<br>
In the formulae V and VI, R11 preferably denotes H, i.e. the acrylic acid<br>
derivatives are preferred.<br>
Y in formula V preferably denotes<br><br>
-COCHR15R16 or-CH2NH2, secondarily preferably<br>
-CNor-CHO.<br>
R15 and R16, independently of one another, denote H or an alkyl group<br>
having up to 5 C atoms. At least one of the radicals R15 and R16 is prefera-<br>
bly H. The following radicals are particularly preferred: acetoxy, propionyl-<br>
oxy, butyryloxy, valeryloxy and hexanoyloxy radical.<br>
Z in formula V denotes -OR14, -OH or -NR12R13, preferably -NR12R13.<br>
Preference is given here to compounds in which Z denotes - NR12R13 and<br>
one of the radicals R12 and R13 is H.<br>
The radicals R12 and/or R13 preferably denote an alkyl, phenyl, phenyialkyl<br>
or alkylphenyl group, where the alkyl and/or phenyl group may be mono- or<br>
polysubstituted, preferably mono- or disubstituted, particularly preferably<br>
monosubstituted, by an alkoxy, cyano, amino, mono- or dialkylamino, tri-<br>
alkylammonium, carboxyl, sulfonyl, acetoxy or acetamino radical.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-27-<br>
The radicals R12 and/or R13 preferably denote alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, cyanoalkyl,<br>
aminoalkyl, mono- ordialkylaminoalkyl, trialkylammoniumalkyl, carboxyalkyl<br>
or sulfonylalkyl having up to 10 C atoms, preferably up to 6 C atoms, par-<br>
ticularly preferably up to 4 C atoms in the alkyl group, which may be linear<br>
or branched. R12 and/or R13 accordingly preferably denote methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, 2-methoxyethyl,<br>
2-, 3- or 4-oxapentyl, 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-oxahexyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-oxaheptyl,<br>
isopropyl, 2- butyl, isobutyl, 2-methylbutyl, isopentyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-<br>

pentyl, 2-methyl- 3-oxahexyl, furthermore also heptyl, octyl, nonyl ordecyl.<br>
Preference is furthermore also given to alkyl groups which are substituted<br>
by a cyano, carboxyl or sulfonyl group. Accordingly, R12 and/or R13 prefera-<br>
bly denote cyanomethyl, cyanoethyl, cyanopropyl, cyanobutyl, cyanopentyl,<br>
cyanohexyl, 2-cyanopropyl, 2- cyanobutyl, carboxylmethyl, carboxylethyl,<br>
carboxylpropyl, carboxylisopropyl, carboxylbutyl, carboxylpentyl, carboxyl-<br>
hexyl, carboxyl- 2-methylpropyl, carboxyl-2-methylbutyl, sulfonylmethyl,<br>

sulfonyl-2-methylpropyl, sulfonyl-2-methylbutyl, sulfonyl-3- methylbutyl,<br>
sulfonyl-2-methylpentyl, sulfonyl-3- methylhexyl or sulfonyl-2-ethylpentyl.<br>
The alkyl groups are furthermore preferably monosubstituted by an amino,<br>
mono- or dialkylamino or trialkylammonium group. The alkyl groups here<br>

As already mentioned above, there are sorbents in which exclusively one<br>
type of separation effector is present in the base matrix ("single mode" sor-<br>
bents), and copolymers or "mixed mode" sorbents in which at least two<br>
different types of separation effectors are present in the sorbent. "Single<br>
mode" sorbents separate the dissolved substances (solutes) on the basis<br>
of one type of interaction between separation effector and solutes. On use<br>
of mixed mode sorbents, the separation of the dissolved substances (sol-<br>
utes) is based on different types of interactions between separation effector<br>
and solutes. Chromatographic methods of this type are known as mixed<br>
mode chromatography.<br>
In the simplest case, for example, the hydrophobicity of the base matrix is<br>
utilised in order to provide a sorbent which is suitable for mixed mode<br>
chromatography by introduction of an ionic separation effector. Mixed<br>
mode sorbents are also accessible by reaction of a base matrix with two<br>
different reactants, one of which introduces, for example, a hydrophobic<br>
group, the other an ionic group into the base matrix. The disadvantage of<br>
the two procedures consists in that the steric relationship between the dif-<br>
ferent types of separation effectors are not defined.<br>
This disadvantage is avoided in the case of mixed mode sorbents in which<br>
the different separation effectors are combined in a ligand. This ligand is<br>
bonded to the base matrix.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-31 -<br>
Both types of mixed mode sorbents mentioned above are described in a<br>
review article by L.W. McLaughlin (1989) in Chem.Rev. 89, 309 - 319. A<br>
mixed mode sorbent whose different separation effectors are bonded in a<br>
single ligand can be prepared, for example, from a chloropropyl-substituted<br>
support material by conversion of the chlorine derivatives into bromine<br>
derivatives followed by reaction with benzyldimethylamine: the ligand is<br>
bonded to the base matrix via a C3 chain. This is followed by a dimethyl-<br>
substituted ammonium group, to which a lipophilic benzyl radical is<br>
bonded. A reverse arrangement of hydrophobic and ionic separation<br>
effectors in a ligand is obtainable by reaction of aminopropyl-substituted<br>
support material with p-diethylaminobenzoic acid: in this ligand, the tertiary<br>
amino group is oriented distally of the base matrix, while in the former vari-<br>
ant, the hydrophobic benzyl group is arranged distally.<br>
Further embodiments of such ligands having two separation effectors are<br>
disclosed in the following documents: WO 96/09116, WO 97/29825,<br>
WO 00/69872 and WO01/38228. The patent application EP 04028798.9<br>
discloses more complex ligands having more than one separation effector<br>
each, and anion exchange groups whose nitrogen is in the form of an aza<br>
derivative of polycyclic structures, for example the quininuclidine system.<br>

Depending on the type of separation effectors, the use of the polymers<br>
according to the invention corresponds by way of example to affinity chro-<br>
matography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chro-<br>
matography, size exclusion chromatography, chiral chromatography or<br>
mixed mode chromatography or liquid-liquid partition chromatography<br>
The polymers according to the invention, in their native form or provided<br>
with separation effectors corresponding to the application, can be used in<br>
known chromatographic conceptional methods in which a sorbent is used.<br>
These methods can in principle be divided into discontinuous and continu-<br>
ous methods. Examples of discontinuous methods are mentioned in<br>
"Preparative Chromatography" (Ed. H. Schmidt-Traub, Wiley-VCH Verlag<br>
Weinheim, 2005, ISBN 3-527-30643-9, page 183-189). Further examples<br>
are flash chromatography, expanded bed chromatography, inter alia. Fur-<br>
thermore, the polymers according to the invention, in their native form or<br>
provided with separation effectors corresponding to the application, can be<br>
used in continuous methods, such as, for example, simulated moving bed<br>
chromatography. Further examples of continuous methods are described in<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-35-<br>
"Preparative Chromatography" (Ed. H. Schmidt-Traub, Wiley-VCH Verlag<br>
Weinheim, 2005, ISBN 3-527-30643-9, page 190-204).<br>
Both the continuous methods and also the discontinuous methods can be<br>
carried out, depending on the objective, either isocratically or also using the<br>
gradient technique. It is known to the person skilled in the art how the sor-<br>
bent according to the invention, native or provided with separation effectors,<br>
is to be employed for the desired objective in one of the said methods.<br>
The polymers according to the invention can also be used in thin-layer<br>
chromatography.<br>
Even without further comments, it is assumed that a person skilled in the art<br>
will be able to utilise the above description in the broadest scope. The<br>
preferred embodiments and examples should therefore merely be regarded<br>
as descriptive disclosure which is absolutely not limiting in any way.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all applications, patents and publica-<br>
tions mentioned above and below, in particular the corresponding applica-<br>
tion EP 05 016 846.7, filed on 03.08.2005, is incorporated into this applica-<br>
tion by way of reference.<br>
Examples<br>
1. Preparation of a copolymer from butanediol monovinyl ether and divinyl-<br>
ethyleneurea<br>
1050 ml of deionised water (Dl water) are charged into a double-walled<br>
reactor, and 0.32 g of tributyl phosphate, 4.2 g of sodium sulfate, 0.01 g of<br>
sodium laurylsulfonate and 2.1 g of polyvinyl alcohol as stabiliser are dis-<br>
solved therein. The organic phase, consisting of 96.25 g of butanediol<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-36-<br>
monovinyl ether, 78.45 g of divinylethyleneurea, 175 g of dodecanol and<br>
4.2 g of a,a'-azobisisobutyronitrile, is added to the aqueous phase with stir-<br>
ring at room temperature after mixing and dissolution of the constituents.<br>
The suspension is stirred vigorously and subsequently warmed to 70Â°C<br>
while flushing with nitrogen. After about 2 hours, the polymerisation is con-<br>
tinued at 80Â°C for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer<br>
is filtered off with suction, the porogen is removed by steam distillation, and<br>
the product is stored in 20% ethanolic solution.<br>
130 g of polymer, based on the dry weight, are obtained. The average par-<br>
ticle size is 80 urn.<br>
Characterisation of the porous structure:<br>
Specific surface area (BET): 322 m2/g<br>
The swollen volume of the reaction product is 4.3 ml/g.<br>
2. Determination of the retention behaviour of proteins (nonspecific binding)<br>
The determination of the retention behaviour of proteins as a function of the<br>
salt concentration is employed to investigate the protein-binding behaviour<br>
of the unmodified support material. Since proteins only bind nonspecifically<br>
to the unmodified support material, it is advantageous if as little background<br>
binding as possible occurs.<br>
The binding behaviour of the material according to the invention (prepared<br>
corresponding to Example 1) is depicted in comparison with the unmodified<br>
copolymer comprising 1,2,-dihydroxy-3-al!ylaxypropane and methylenebis-<br>
acrylamide, commercially available under the name FractoPrep^' (Merck<br>
KGaA, Germany). Figure 1 shows the binding behaviour of the proteins<br>
lysozyme and bovine serum albumin and of NaNO3. The abbreviation FP<br>
stands for FractoPrepÂ®, B/D stands for the copolymer according to the<br>
invention comprising butanediol monovinyl ether and divinylethyleneurea.<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-37-<br>
The recovery of the measured proteins, quoted as the quotient of the photo-<br>
metrically determined amount of protein eluted from the column under the<br>
run conditions to the protein applied to the column, is greater than 90%<br>
under all experimental conditions.<br>
3.	Size exclusion chromatoqraphv on the polymer according to the inven-<br>
tion<br>
An illustrative pore structure of the polymer according to the invention is<br>
shown by way of example in Figure 2 through the experimentally deter-<br>
mined distribution coefficient Kd of dextrans of various molecular weights,<br>
expressed by the viscosity radius of the dextrans.<br>
4.	Base stability investigations<br>
The material according to the invention prepared corresponding to Example<br>
1 is stored at room temperature in 0.5 M NaOH (volume ratio<br>
NaOH:polymer gel = 4:1).<br>
After certain times, the separation behaviour of the polymer is tested with<br>
reference to the retention behaviour in the separation of various pullulanes<br>
(PSS, Mainz, Germany) as marker compounds.<br>
Eluent: 100 mM NaCI, 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2<br>
Column: 300x10 mm, flow rate: 0.8 ml/min, refractive index detector.<br>
Figure 3 shows the results. It is clearly evident that storage in dilute sodium<br>
hydroxide solution has absolutely no effect on the distribution coefficient.<br><br>

5.) Separation of a protein mixture<br>
The polymer according to the invention, consisting in this example of a co-<br>
polymer of 65% by weight of butanediol monovinyl ether and 35% by weight<br>
of divinylethyleneurea in the form of spherical porous particles having an<br>
average particle diameter of 107 pm, is provided with cationic separation<br>
effectors by means of Ce(IV)-initiated graft polymerisation of 2-acrylamido-<br>
2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid corresponding to the procedure described<br>
on page 10 under Preparation Example A2 in WO 03/031062. The density<br>
of functional SO3 groups in this polymer is obtained as 1195 umol, based<br>
on 1 g of dry matter. The ion exchanger material prepared (BATCH: BDM<br>
SO3 DZ38) is introduced into a Superformanceâ¢ glass column, Goetec<br>
Labortechnik (depth of the sorbent bed 40 mm, diameter 10 mm) and<br>
equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.0. 500 ul of a<br>
solution of 5 mg/ml of chymotrypsinogen A, 5 mg/ml of lysozyme and<br>
5 mg/ml of cytochrome C in 20 mM NaH2PO4 are applied to the column.<br>
After the application, elutibn is carried out via a linear gradient over the<br>
course of 12 column volumes to 100% of a solution of 20 mM NaH2PO4,<br>
1 M NaCI, pH 6.0. The elution behaviour of the polymer according to the<br>
invention results in separation of the individual proteins of the mixture.<br>
Figure 4 shows the associated chromatogram.<br>
6.) Pressure/flow behaviour<br>
The polymer according to the invention in its native form, consisting of 65%<br>
by weight of butanediol monovinyl ether and 35% by weight of divinyl-<br>
ethyleneurea (BATCH: BDM PS02/E), is introduced into a Superformanceâ¢<br>
glass column, Goetec Labortechnik, having a diameter of 50 mm. The<br>
depth of the sorbent bed is 20 cm. The average particle diameter of the<br>
spherical porous polymer is 107 urn. The pressure drop over this column is<br>
measured as a function of the flow rate of a solution of 100 mM NaCI,<br>
20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.0. Even at a very high flow rate of 1400 cm/h, the<br><br>
WO 2007/014591	PCT/EP2006/005484<br>
-39-<br>
pressure drop is less than 3 bar. Figure 5 shows the associated graphical<br>
representation of the pressure/flow measurement.<br><br>
