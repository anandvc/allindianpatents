				<td>COMPOUNDS TO TREAT ALZHEIMER"S DISEASE"<br>
A SUBSTITUTED AMINE<br>
This application is being filed as a PCT International Patent Application in<br>
the name of Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a U.S. national corporation and resident,<br>
(Applicant for all countries), on 29 June 2001, designating all countries except US.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds useful in treatment of<br>
Alzheimer"s disease and similar diseases.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Alzheimer"s disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain<br>
primarily associated with aging. Clinical presentation of AD is characterized by loss<br>
of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment, and orientation. As the disease<br>
progresses, motor, sensory, and linguistic abilities are also affected until there is<br>
global impairment of multiple cognitive functions. These cognitive losses occur<br>
gradually, but typically lead to severe impairment and eventual death in the range of<br>
four to twelve years.<br>
Alzheimer"s disease is characterized by two major pathologic observations in<br>
the brain: neurofibrillary tangles and beta amyloid (or neuritic) plaques, comprised<br>
predominantly of an aggregate of a peptide fragment know as A beta. Individuals<br>
with AD exhibit characteristic beta-amyloid deposits in the brain (beta amyloid<br>
plaques) and in cerebral blood vessels (beta amyloid angiopathy) as well as<br>
neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles occur not only in Alzheimer"s<br>
disease but also in other dementia-inducing disorders. On autopsy, large numbers of<br>
these lesions are generally found in areas of the human brain important for memory<br>
and cognition.<br>
Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restricted anatomical distribution<br>
are found in the brains of most aged humans who do not have clinical AD.<br>
Amyloidogenic plaques and vascular amyloid angiopathy also characterize the<br>
brains of individuals with Trisomy 21 (Down"s Syndrome), Hereditary Cerebral<br>
Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type (HCHWA-D), and other<br>
neurogenerative disorders. Beta-amyloid is a defining feature of AD, now believed<br>
to be a causative precursor or factor in the development of disease. Deposition of A<br>
beta in areas of the brain responsible for cognitive activities is a major factor in the<br>
development of AD. Beta-amyloid plaques are predominantly composed of amyloid<br>
beta peptide (A beta, also sometimes designated betaA4). A beta peptide is derived<br>
by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is comprised of 39-42<br>
amino acids. Several proteases called secretases are involved in the processing of<br>
APP.<br>
Cleavage of APP at the N-terminus of the A beta peptide by beta-secretase<br>
and at the C-terminus by one or more gamma-secretases constitutes the beta-<br>
amyloidogenic pathway, i.e. the pathway by which A beta is formed. Cleavage of<br>
APP by alpha-secretase produces alpha-sAPP, a secreted form of APP that does not<br>
result in beta-amyloid plaque formation. This alternate pathway precludes the<br>
formation of A beta peptide. A description of the proteolytic processing fragments<br>
of APP is found, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,441,870; 5,721,130; and<br>
5,942,400.<br>
An aspartyl protease has been identified as the enzyme responsible for<br>
processing of APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site. The beta-secretase enzyme<br>
has been disclosed using varied nomenclature, including BACE, Asp, and<br>
Memapsin. See, for example, Sinha et al., 1999, Nature 402:537-554 (p501) and<br>
published PCT application WO00/17369.<br>
Several lines of evidence indicate that progressive cerebral deposition of<br>
beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) plays a seminal role in the pathogenesis of AD and<br>
can precede cognitive symptoms by years or decades. See, for example, Selkoe,<br>
1991, Neuron 6:487. Release of A beta from neuronal cells grown in culture and<br>
the presence of A beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both normal individuals and<br>
AD patients has been demonstrated. See, for example, Seubert et al., 1992, Nature<br>
359:325-327.<br>
It has been proposed that A beta peptide accumulates as a result of APP<br>
processing by beta-secretase, thus inhibition of this enzyme"s activity is desirable<br>
for the treatment of AD. In vivo processing of APP at the beta-secretase cleavage<br>
site is thought to be a rate-limiting step in A beta production, and is thus a<br>
therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. See for example, Sabbagh, M., et al.,<br>
1997, Alz. Dis. Rev. 3,1-19.<br>
BACE1 knockout mice fail to produce A beta, and present a normal<br>
phenotype. When crossed with transgenic mice that overexpress APP, the progeny<br>
show reduced amounts of A beta in brain extracts as compared with control animals<br>
(Luo et.al., 2001 Nature Neuroscience 4:231-232). This evidence further supports<br>
the proposal that inhibition of beta-secretase activity and reduction of A beta in the<br>
brain provides a therapeutic method for the treatment of AD and other beta amyloid<br>
disorders.<br>
Published PCT application WO00/47618 entitled "Beta-Secretase Enzyme<br>
Compositions and Methods" identifies the beta-secretase enzyme and methods of its<br>
use. This publication also discloses oligopeptide inhibitors that bind the enzyme"s<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention includes compounds of formula (XV) that are useful in<br>
treating and preventing Alzheimer"s disease. The anti-Alzheimer"s compounds of<br>
formula (XV) are made by methods well known to those skilled in the art from<br>
starting compounds known to those skilled in the art. The process chemistry is well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Examples of preparing various compounds of<br>
formula (XV) are included in charts A-C. One skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
these are all well known reactions in organic chemistry. A chemist skilled in the art,<br>
knowing the chemical structure of the biologically active compounds of formula<br>
(XV) of the invention would be able to prepare them by known methods from<br>
known starting materials without any additional information. The explanation below<br>
therefore is not necessary but is deemed helpful to those skilled in the art who desire<br>
to make compounds of the invention.<br>
CHART A illustrates a general method of synthesizing compounds of the<br>
invention. The anti-Alzheimer"s coumpounds of formula (XV) are prepared by<br>
starting with the corresponding epoxide (I). The epoxides (I) are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared from known compounds by<br>
methods well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of formula (XV) of<br>
the present invention have at least two enantiomeric centers which give four<br>
enantiomers. The first of these enantiomeric centers derives from the epoxide<br>
starting material (I). If a desired enantiomer is preferred, it is preferred to<br>
commercially obtain or produce the desired enantiomer (S or R) rather than produce<br>
an enantiomerically impure mixture and then have to separate out the desired<br>
enantiomer. For the epoxide (I), R1 is:<br>

Before the synthesis is begun, the free amino group of the epoxide (I) must<br>
be protected with an amino protecting group. There are a number of methods well<br>
known to those skilled in the art for accomplishing this step. Amino protecting<br>
groups are well known to those skilled in the art. See for example, "Protecting<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and sons, New York, N.Y., 1981,<br>
Chapter 7; "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, New York,<br>
N.Y., 1973, Chapter 2. The function of the amino protecting group is to protect the<br>
free amino functionality (-NH2) during subsequent reactions on the epoxide (I)<br>
which would not proceed well, either because the amino group would react and be<br>
functionalized in a way that is inconsistent with its need to be free for subsequent<br>
reactions, or the free amino group would interfere in the reaction. When the amino<br>
protecting group is no longer needed, it is removed by methods well known to those<br>
skilled in the art. By definition the amino protecting group must be readily<br>
removable as is known to those skilled in the art by methods well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable amino PROTECTING GROUP is selected from the group<br>
consisting of f-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, formyl, trityl, acetyl,<br>

butoxycarbonyl (BOC) and benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), it is more preferred that the<br>
protecting group be t-butoxycarbonyl. One skilled in the art will understand the<br>
preferred methods of introducing a t-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl<br>
protecting group and may additionally consult T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts in<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry," John Wiley and Sons, 1991 for guidance.<br>

The epoxide (I) is combined with the hydrazine in hot isopropanol resulting<br>
in the selective formation of the hydrazine (II) arising from alkylation of the<br>
unsubstituted nitrogen (M. Nakakata, Tetrahedron Letters 1993, 6095-6098).<br>
Monoacylation of the hydrazine -NH-NH- with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride or other<br>
acylating agent gives (HI) and reduces the reactivity of this group to further<br>
acylation irrespective of which hydrazine nitrogen the first acyl group becomes<br>
attached to (B. Gisin, Helv. Chim. Acta 1970, vol 53, 1030-1043. S. Shinagawa,<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1981, vol 29, 3630-3638). Removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl<br>

The compound that is the source of Rn can be coupled with any well known<br>
coupling agents, an example of which is carbodiimide. Cleavage of the<br>
acylhydrazine linkage gives the compounds (XV).<br>
CHART A" gives a more specific example of one method of synthesizing<br>
compounds of the invention (XV). The anti-Alzheimer"s coumpounds of formula<br>
(XV) are prepared by starting with the corresponding epoxide (I). The epoxides (I)<br>
are well known to those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared from known<br>
compounds by methods well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of<br>
formula (XV) of the present invention have at least two enantiomeric centers which<br>
give four enantiomers. The first of these enantiomeric centers derives from the<br>
epoxide starting material (I). If a desired enantiomer is preferred, it is preferred to<br>
commercially obtain or produce the desired enantiomer (S or R) rather than produce<br>
an enantiomerically impure mixture and then have to separate out the desired<br>
enantiomer.<br>
The exemplary synthesis begins by reacting the epoxide (I) with an armoatic<br>
hydraxine in hot isopropanol results in the selective formation of the hydrazines (II)<br>
arising from alkylation of the unsubstituted nitrogen (M. Nakakata, Tetrahedron<br>
Letters 1993, 6095-6098). Monoacylation of the hydrazine -NH-NH- with<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl chloride or other acylating agent gives (III) and reduces the<br>
reactivity of this group to further acylation irrespective of which hydrazine nitrogen<br>
the first acyl group becomes attached to (B. Gisin, Helv. Chim. Acta 1970, vol 53,<br>
1030-1043. S. Shinagawa, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1981, vol 29, 3630-3638). Removal<br>
of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group of (111) will provide the free amine (IV),<br>
which is coupled to the isophthalic acid (XIV) using carbodiimide or other well<br>
known coupling agents. Cleavage of the acylhydrazine linkage gives a compound of<br>
the invention (XV).<br>
CHART B offers another example of a method that can be utilized to make<br>
compounds of the invention. Selective acylation of methylhydrazine on the<br>
substituted nitrogen (D. Butler, J. Medicinal Chemistry 1971, vol. 14, 1052-1054)<br>
will provide acylhydrazine VI. Treating this hydrazide with epoxide I in hot<br>
isopropanol will provide adduct VII (S. Wang, J. Medicinal Chemistry 1997, vol 40,<br>
937-941. G. Bold, J. Medicinal Chemistry 1998, vol 41, 3387-3401). Cleavage of<br>
the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group and coupling to isophthalic acid (XIV) will<br>
provide a compound of the invention (XV).<br>
CHART C offers a general method of making compounds (XV) of the<br>
invention, wherein X is O. A general method of synthesizing compounds (XV) of<br>
the invention wherein X is O, begins with a protected epoxide (I). The epoxide (I)<br>
again serves to provide R1, R2, and R3 of the final product (XV), the discussion of<br>
these compounds offered above applies equally here. The epoxide is opened with a<br>
hydroxylamine having the formula RA-O-NH2. The hydroxylamine serves both to<br>
open the epoxide ring and provide RA to the final product (XV). Once the<br>
hydroxylamine has been reacted with the epoxide (I), the adduct (XI) is formed.<br>
Adduct (XI) has R1, R2, R3, and RA of the compounds (XV) of the invention. The<br>
possible identities of R1, R2, R3, and RA, as well as the protecting group discussed<br>
above, apply to adduct (XI) as well. The next step in the synthesis of compounds<br>
(XV) of the invention, wherein X is 0 is cleavage of the protecting group. The<br>
protecting groups and methods of cleaving them discussed above apply similarily to<br>
these compounds. After the protecting group has been cleaved from adduct XI, the<br>
next step involves acylation with the source of Rn.<br>
CHART C offers another more specific illustrative example of one method<br>
of making compounds (XV) of the invention, wherein X is O. Epoxide (I) opening<br>
with O-benzylhydroxylamine gives the adduct XI (S. Rosenberg, J. Medicinal<br>
Chemistry 1990, vol 33, 1582-1590). Cleavage of the tert-butoxycarbonyl<br>
protecting group and acylation with isophthallic acid (as prepared, for example, by<br>
the method below) provides the target compound XIII.<br>
The preparation of isophthallic acid for use in the above synthesis can be<br>
accomplished for example, by the below synthesis, referring to CHART D below.<br>
Methyl isophthalate (1 equiv, 11.1 mmol) was dissolved in 50:50 THF:DMF (20<br>
mL) before the addition of 1,1"carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) (1.2 equiv, 13.3 mmol) at<br>
ambient temperature. Upon addition of CDI, a color change from colorless to<br>
yellow, as well as evolution of gas (CO2), was observed. After gas evolution<br>
subsided (approximately one minute or less), the amine (1.2 equiv, 13.3 mmol)<br>
dissolved in DMF and diisopropylethyl amine (1.2 equiv, 13.3 mmol) was added.<br>
After 12 hours of stirring at ambient temperature, the reaction was partitioned<br>
between saturated aqueous NH4Cl and ethyl acetate, and the aqueous layer was<br>
extracted twice more with ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were then washed<br>
with saturated aqueous solutions of NaHCO3 and NaCl, and dried over anhydrous<br>
MgSO4 or NaSO4. Filtration of the drying agent and removal of solvents in vacuo<br>
gave the crude white solid or clear oil. Purification of these compounds if needed<br>
was achieved via chromatography on silica gel with 30-40% ethyl acetate in<br>
hexanes (80-90% yield).<br>
The methyl isophthalate mono-alkyl or di-alkyl amide (1 equiv, 11.1 mmol)<br>
was then treated with LiOH-H2O (3 equiv, 33.3 mmol) in a minimum amount of<br>
1:2:1 THF:MeOH:H2O and allowed to stir overnight at ambient temperature. After<br>
12 hours, the solvents were removed in vacuo and subsequently partitioned between<br>
H2O and ethyl acetate. If emulsions prohibit separation of the two layers, a small<br>
amount of brine was added to aid in separation. The aqueous layer was extracted<br>
once more with ethyl acetate (to remove any unreacted starting material). The<br>
aqueous layer was then acidified with concentrated HC1 until pH = 3. The cloudy-<br>
white acidic aqueous solution thus obtained was then extracted three times with<br>
ethyl acetate. These combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous MgSO4<br>
or Na2SO4. Filtration of the drying agent and removal of solvents in vacuo gave the<br>
crude white solid. The mono- or di-alkyl amide isophthalate was used crude in the<br>
next reaction (90-100% yield).<br>

The (S,R)-substituted amines (XV) are amines and as such form salts when<br>
reacted with acids. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred over the cor-<br>
responding (S,R)-substituted amines (XV) since they produce compounds which are<br>
more water soluble, stable and/or more crystalline.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are any salt which retains the activity of<br>
the parent compound and does not impart any deleterious or undesirable effect on<br>
the subject to whom it is administered and in the context in which it is administered.<br>
Phannaceutically acceptable salts include salts of both inorganic and organic acids.<br>

Methods of the Invention<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are useful for treating humans or animals<br>
suffering from a condition characterized by a pathological form of beta-amyloid<br>
peptide, such as beta-amyloid plaques, and for helping to prevent or delay the onset<br>
of such a condition. For example, the compounds are useful for treating Alzheimer"s<br>

of Alzheimer"s disease in those who would progress from MCI to AD, for treating<br>
Down"s syndrome, for treating humans who have Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage<br>
with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type, for treating cerebral amyloid angiopathy and<br>
preventing its potential consequences, i.e. single and recurrent lobal hemorrhages,<br>
for treating other degenerative dementias, including dementias of mixed vascular<br>
and degenerative origin, dementia associated with Parkinson"s disease, dementia<br>
associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia associated with cortical<br>
basal degeneration, and diffuse Lewy body type Alzheimer"s disease. The<br>
compounds and compositions of the invention are particularly useful for treating or<br>
preventing Alzheimer"s disease. When treating or preventing these diseases, the<br>
compounds employed in the methods of the invention can either be used<br>
individually or in combination, as is best for the patient.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating" means that the compounds employed in<br>
the methods of the invention can be used in humans with at least a tentative<br>
diagnosis of disease. The compounds employed in the methods of the invention will<br>
delay or slow the progression of the disease thereby giving the individual a more<br>
useful life span.<br>
The term "preventing" means that the compounds employed in the method of<br>
the invention are useful when administered to a patient who has not been diagnosed<br>
as possibly having the disease at the time of administration, but who would normally<br>
be expected to develop the disease or be at increased risk for the disease. The<br>
compounds employed in the methods of the invention will slow the development of<br>
disease symptoms, delay the onset of the disease, or prevent the individual from<br>
developing the disease at all. Preventing also includes administration of the<br>
compounds employed in the methods of the invention to those individuals thought to<br>
be predisposed to the disease due to age, familial history, genetic or chromosomal<br>
abnormalities, and/or due to the presence of one or more biological markers for the<br>
disease, such as a known genetic mutation of APP or APP cleavage products in brain<br>
tissues or fluids.<br>
In treating or preventing the above diseases, the compounds employed in the<br>
methods of the invention are administered in a therapeutically effective amount.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the particular<br>
compound used and the route of administration, as is known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
In treating a patient displaying any of the diagnosed above conditions a<br>
physician may administer a compound employed in the method of the invention<br>
immediately and continue administration indefinitely, as needed. In treating patients<br>
who are not diagnosed as having Alzheimer"s disease, but who are believed to be at<br>
substantial risk for Alzheimer"s disease, the physician should preferably start<br>
treatment when the patient first experiences early pre-Alzheimer"s symptoms such<br>
as, memory or cognitive problems associated with aging. In addition, there are some<br>
patients who may be determined to be at risk for developing Alzheimer"s through the<br>
detection of a genetic marker such as APOE4 or other biological indicators that are<br>
predictive for Alzheimer"s disease. In these situations, even though the patient does<br>
not have symptoms of the disease, administration of the compounds employed in the<br>
methods of the invention may be started before symptoms appear, and treatment<br>
may be continued indefinitely to prevent or delay the onset of the disease.<br>
Dosage Forms and Amounts<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered orally, parenterally, (TV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo SQ),<br>
sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally, topically, or rectally. Dosage<br>
forms known to those of skill in the art are suitable for delivery of the compounds<br>
employed in the methods of the invention.<br>
Compositions are provided that contain therapeutically effective amounts of<br>
the compounds employed in the methods of the invention. The compounds are<br>
preferably formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets,<br>
capsules, or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for<br>
parenteral administration. Typically the compounds described above are formulated<br>
into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in<br>
the art.<br>
About 1 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds employed in the<br>
methods of the invention or a physiologically acceptable salt or ester is compounded<br>
with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative,<br>
stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical<br>
practice. The amount of active substance in those compositions or preparations is<br>
such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. The compositions are<br>
preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 2 to<br>
about 100 mg, more preferably about 10 to about 30 mg of the active ingredient.<br>
The term "unit dosage from" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary<br>
dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
To prepare compositions, one or more compounds employed in the methods<br>
of the invention are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a<br>
solution, suspension, emulsion, or the like. Liposomal suspensions may also be<br>
suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according<br>
to methods known to those skilled in the art. The form of the resulting mixture<br>
depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration<br>
and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective<br>
concentration is sufficient for lessening or ameliorating at least one symptom of the<br>
disease, disorder, or condition treated and may be empirically determined.<br>
Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the<br>
compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the<br>
art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. In addition, the active<br>
materials can also be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired<br>
action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, or have another action.<br>
The compounds may be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in<br>
the composition or may be combined with other active ingredients.<br>
Where the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for<br>
solubilizing may be used. Such methods are known and include, but are not limited<br>
to, using cosolvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants such as<br>
Tween®, and dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the<br>
compounds, such as salts or prodrugs may also be used in formulating effective<br>
pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The concentration of the compound is effective for delivery of an amount<br>
upon administration that lessens or ameliorates at least one symptom of the disorder<br>
for which the compound is administered. Typically, the compositions are formulated<br>
for single dosage administration.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention may be prepared<br>
with carriers that protect them against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-<br>
release formulations or coatings. Such carriers include controlled release<br>
formulations, such as, but not limited to, microencapsulated delivery systems. The<br>
active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount<br>
sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side<br>
effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be<br>
determined empirically by testing the compounds in known in vitro and in vivo<br>
model systems for the treated disorder.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the invention can be enclosed in<br>
multiple or single dose containers. The enclosed compounds and compositions can<br>
be provided in kits, for example, including component parts that can be assembled<br>
for use. For example, a compound inhibitor in lyophilized form and a suitable<br>
diluent may be provided as separated components for combination prior to use. A<br>
kit may include a compound inhibitor and a second therapeutic agent for co-<br>
administration. The inhibitor and second therapeutic agent may be provided as<br>
separate component parts. A kit may include a plurality of containers, each<br>
container holding one or more unit dose of the compound employed in the method<br>
of the invention. The containers are preferably adapted for the desired mode of<br>
administration, including, but not limited to tablets, gel capsules, sustained-release<br>
capsules, and the like for oral administration; depot products, pre-filled syringes,<br>
ampoules, vials, and the like for parenteral administration; and patches, medipads,<br>
creams, and the like for topical administration.<br>
The concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend<br>
on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage<br>
schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in<br>
the art.<br>
The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a<br>
number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that<br>
the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being<br>
treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by<br>
extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations<br>
and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated.<br>
It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens<br>
should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional<br>
judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the<br>
compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions.<br>
If oral administration is desired, the compound should be provided in a<br>
composition that protects it from the acidic environment of the stomach. For<br>
example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its<br>
integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in the intestine. The<br>
composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such<br>
ingredient.<br>
Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier<br>
and may be compressed into tablets or enclosed in gelatin capsules. For the purpose<br>
of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound or compounds can be<br>
incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, capsules, or troches.<br>
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents and adjuvant materials can be included<br>
as part of the composition.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like can contain any of the<br>
following ingredients or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as, but not<br>
limited to, gum tragacanth, acacia, com starch, or gelatin; an excipient such as<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, starch, or lactose; a disintegrating agent such as, but not<br>
limited to, alginic acid and corn starch; a lubricant such as, but not limited to,<br>
magnesium stearate; a gildant, such as, but not limited to, colloidal silicon dioxide; a<br>
sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; and a flavoring agent such as<br>
peppermint, methyl salicylate, or fruit flavoring.<br>
When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material<br>
of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms<br>
can contain various other materials, which modify the physical form of the dosage<br>
unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The compounds can<br>
also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing<br>
gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose<br>
as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings, and flavors.<br>
The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials that do not<br>
impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action.<br>
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or<br>
topical application can include any of the following components: a sterile diluent<br>
such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, a naturally occurring vegetable<br>
oil such as sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, and the like, or a<br>
synthetic fatty vehicle such as ethyl oleate, and the like, polyethylene glycol,<br>
glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvent; antimicrobial agents such as<br>
benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and sodium<br>
bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers<br>
such as acetates, citrates, and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity<br>
such as sodium chloride and dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in<br>
ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic, or other<br>
suitable material. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be<br>
incorporated as required.<br>
Where administered intravenously, suitable carriers include physiological<br>
saline, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and solutions containing thickening and<br>
solubilizing agents such as glucose, polyethylene glycol, polypropyleneglycol, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Liposomal suspensions including tissue-targeted liposomes may<br>
also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared<br>
according to methods known for example, as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,522,811.<br>
The active compounds may be prepared with carriers that protect the<br>
compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-release<br>
formulations or coatings. Such carriers include controlled release formulations, such<br>
as, but not limited to, implants and microencapsulated delivery systems, and<br>
biodegradable, biocompatible polymers such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate,<br>
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid, and the like.<br>
Methods for preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered orally, parenterally (TV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo-SQ), sublingually,<br>
intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally, topically, or rectally. Dosage forms known to<br>
those skilled in the art are suitable for delivery of the compounds employed in the<br>
methods of the invention.<br>
Compounds employed in the methods of the invention may be administered<br>
enterally or parenterally. When administered orally, compounds employed in the<br>
methods of the invention can be administered in usual dosage forms for oral<br>
administration as is well known to those skilled in the art. These dosage forms<br>
include the usual solid unit dosage forms of tablets and capsules as well as liquid<br>
dosage forms such as solutions, suspensions, and elixirs. When the solid dosage<br>
forms are used, it is preferred that they be of the sustained release type so that the<br>
compounds employed in the methods of the invention need to be administered only<br>
once or twice daily.<br>
The oral dosage forms are administered to the patient 1, 2, 3, or 4 times<br>
daily. It is preferred that the compounds employed in the methods of the invention<br>
be administered either three or fewer times, more preferably once or twice daily.<br>
Hence, it is preferred that the compounds employed in the methods of the invention<br>
be administered in oral dosage form. It is preferred that whatever oral dosage form<br>
is used, that it be designed so as to protect the compounds employed in the methods<br>
of the invention from the acidic environment of the stomach. Enteric coated tablets<br>
are well known to those skilled in the art. In addition, capsules filled with small<br>
spheres each coated to protect from the acidic stomach, are also well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
When administered orally, an administered amount therapeutically effective<br>
to inhibit beta-secretase activity, to inhibit A beta production, to inhibit A beta<br>
deposition, or to treat or prevent AD is from about 0.1 mg/day to about 1,000<br>
mg/day. It is preferred that the oral dosage is from about 1 mg/day to about 100<br>
mg/day. It is more preferred that the oral dosage is from about 5 mg/day to about 50<br>
mg/day. It is understood that while a patient may be started at one dose, that dose<br>
may be varied over time as the patient"s condition changes.<br>
Compounds employed in the methods of the invention may also be<br>
advantageously delivered in a nano crystal dispersion formulation. Preparation of<br>
such formulations is described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,145,684. Nano<br>
crystalline dispersions of HIV protease inhibitors and their method of use are<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,045,829. The nano crystalline formulations typically<br>
afford greater bioavailability of drug compounds.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered parenterally, for example, by IV, IM, depo-IM, SC, or depo-SC. When<br>
administered parenterally, a therapeutically effective amount of about 0.5 to about<br>
100 mg/day, preferably from about 5 to about 50 mg daily should be delivered.<br>
When a depot formulation is used for injection once a month or once every two<br>
weeks, the dose should be about 0.5 mg/day to about 50 mg/day, or a monthly dose<br>
of from about 15 mg to about 1,500 mg. In part because of the forgetfulness of the<br>
patients with Alzheimer"s disease, it is preferred that the parenteral dosage form be a<br>
depo formulation.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered sublingually. When given sublingually, the compounds employed in<br>
the methods of the invention should be given one to four times daily in the amounts<br>
described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered intranasally. When given by this route, the appropriate dosage forms<br>
are a nasal spray or dry powder, as is known to those skilled in the art. The dosage<br>
of the compounds employed in the methods of the invention for intranasal<br>
administration is the amount described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered intrathecally. When given by this route the appropriate dosage form<br>
can be a parenteral dosage form as is known to those skilled in the art. The dosage<br>
of the compounds employed in the methods of the invention for intrathecal<br>
administration is the amount described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered topically. When given by this route, the appropriate dosage form is a<br>
cream, ointment, or patch. Because of the amount of the compounds employed in<br>
the methods of the invention to be administered, the patch is preferred. When<br>
administered topically, the dosage is from about 0.5 mg/day to about 200 mg/day.<br>
Because the amount that can be delivered by a patch is limited, two or more patches<br>
may be used. The number and size of the patch is not important, what is important<br>
is that a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds employed in the<br>
methods of the invention be delivered as is known to those skilled in the art. The<br>
compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be administered rectally<br>
by suppository as is known to those skilled in the art. When administered by<br>
suppository, the therapeutically effective amount is from about 0.5 mg to about 500<br>
mg.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be<br>
administered by implants as is known to those skilled in the art. When<br>
administering a compound employed in the method of the invention by implant, the<br>
therapeutically effective amount is the amount described above for depot<br>
administration.<br>
The invention here is the new compounds employed in the methods of the<br>
invention and new methods of using the compounds employed in the methods of the<br>
invention. Given a particular compound employed in the method of the invention<br>
and a desired dosage form, one skilled in the art would know how to prepare and<br>
administer the appropriate dosage form.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention are used in the<br>
same manner, by the same routes of administration, using the same pharmaceutical<br>
dosage forms, and at the same dosing schedule as described above, for preventing<br>
disease or treating patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and preventing or<br>
delaying the onset of Alzheimer"s disease in those who would progress from MCI to<br>
AD, for treating or preventing Down"s syndrome, for treating humans who have<br>
Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type, for treating<br>
cerebral amyloid angiopathy and preventing its potential consequences, i.e. single<br>
and recurrent lobar hemorrhages, for treating other degenerative dementias,<br>
including dementias of mixed vascular and degenerative origin, dementia associated<br>
with Parkinson"s disease, dementia associated with progressive supranuclear palsy,<br>
dementia associated with cortical basal degeneration, and diffuse Lewy body type of<br>
Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention can be used in<br>
combination, with each other or with other therapeutic agents or approaches used to<br>
treat or prevent the conditions listed above. Such agents or approaches include:<br>
acetylcholine esterase inhibitors such as tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine, marketed<br>
as COGNEX®), donepezil hydrochloride, (marketed as Aricept® and rivastigmine<br>
(marketed as Exelon®); gamma-secretase inhibitors; anti-inflammatory agents<br>
such as cyclooxygenase II inhibitors; anti-oxidants such as Vitamin E and<br>
ginkolides; imrnunological approaches, such as, for example, immunization with A<br>
beta peptide or administration of anti-A beta peptide antibodies; statins; and direct<br>
or indirect neurotropic agents such as Cerebrolysin®, AIT-082 (Emilieu, 2000,<br>
Arch. Neurol. 57:454), and other neurotropic agents of the future.<br>
It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the exact dosage and<br>
frequency of administration will depend on the particular compounds employed in<br>
the methods of the invention administered, the particular condition being treated, the<br>
severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, general physical condition of<br>
the particular patient, and other medication the individual may be taking as is well<br>
known to administering physicians who are skilled in this art.<br>
Inhibition of APP Cleavage<br>
The compounds employed in the methods of the invention inhibit cleavage of<br>
APP between Met595 and Asp596 numbered for the APP695 isoform, or a mutant<br>
thereof, or at a corresponding site of a different isoform, such as APP751 or<br>
APP770, or a mutant thereof (sometimes referred to as the "beta secretase site").<br>
While not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, inhibition of beta-secretase<br>
activity is thought to inhibit production of beta amyloid peptide (A beta). Inhibitory<br>
activity is demonstrated in one of a variety of inhibition assays, whereby cleavage of<br>
an APP substrate in the presence of a beta-secretase enzyme is analyzed in the<br>
presence of the inhibitory compound, under conditions normally sufficient to result<br>
in cleavage at the beta-secretase cleavage site. Reduction of APP cleavage at the<br>
beta-secretase cleavage site compared with an untreated or inactive control is<br>
correlated with inhibitory activity. Assay systems that can be used to demonstrate<br>
efficacy of the compound inhibitors of the invention are known. Representative<br>
assay systems are described, for example, in U.S. Patents No. 5,942,400, 5,744,346,<br>
as well as in the Examples below.<br>
The enzymatic activity of beta-secretase and the production of A beta can be<br>
analyzed in vitro or in vivo, using natural, mutated, and/or synthetic APP substrates,<br>
natural, mutated, and/or synthetic enzyme, and the test compound. The analysis<br>
may involve primary or secondary cells expressing native, mutant, and/or synthetic<br>
APP and enzyme, animal models expressing native APP and enzyme, or may utilize<br>
transgenic animal models expressing the substrate and enzyme. Detection of<br>
enzymatic activity can be by analysis of one or more of the cleavage products, for<br>
example, by immunoassay, fluorometric or chromogenic assay, HPLC, or other<br>
means of detection. Inhibitory compounds are determined as those having the<br>
ability to decrease the amount of beta-secretase cleavage product produced in<br>
comparison to a control, where beta-secretase mediated cleavage in the reaction<br>
system is observed and measured in the absence of inhibitory compounds.<br>
Beta-Secretase<br>
Various forms of beta-secretase enzyme are known, and are available and<br>
useful for assay of enzyme activity and inhibition of enzyme activity. These include<br>
native, recombinant, and synthetic forms of the enzyme. Human beta-secretase is<br>
known as Beta Site APP Cleaving Enzyme (BACE), Asp2, and memapsin 2, and has<br>
been characterized, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,744,346 and published PCT<br>
patent applications WO98/22597, WO00/03819, WO01/23533, and WO00/17369,<br>
as well as in literature publications (Hussain et al., 1999, Mol. Cell. Neurosci.<br>
14:419-427; Vassar et al., 1999, Science 286:735-741; Yan et al., 1999, Nature<br>
402:533-537; Sinha et al., 1999, Nature 40:537-540; and Lin et al., 2000, PNAS<br>
USA 97:1456-1460). Synthetic forms of the enzyme have also been described<br>
(WO98/22597 and WO00/17369). Beta-secretase can be extracted and purified<br>
from human brain tissue and can be produced in cells, for example mammalian cells<br>
expressing recombinant enzyme.<br>
Useful inhibitory compounds are effective to inhibit 50% of beta-secretase<br>
enzymatic activity at a concentration of less than 50 micromolar, preferably at a<br>
concentration of 10 micromolar or less, more preferably 1 micromolar or less, and<br>
most preferably 10 nanomolar or less.<br>
APP Substrate<br>
Assays that demonstrate inhibition of beta-secretase-mediated cleavage of<br>
APP can utilize any of the known forms of APP, including the 695 amino acid<br>
"normal" isotype described by Kang et al., 1987, Nature 325:733-6, the 770 amino<br>
acid isotype described by Kitaguchi et. al., 1981, Nature 331:530-532, and variants<br>
such as the Swedish Mutation (KM670-1NL) (APP-SW), the London Mutation<br>
(V7176F), and others. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,766,846 and also Hardy,<br>
1992, Nature Genet. 1:233-234, for a review of known variant mutations.<br>
Additional useful substrates include the dibasic amino acid modification, APP-KK<br>
disclosed, for example, in WO 00/17369, fragments of APP, and synthetic peptides<br>
containing the beta-secretase cleavage site, wild type (WT) or mutated form, e.g.,<br>
SW, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No 5,942,400 and WO00/03819.<br>
The APP substrate contains the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP (KM-DA<br>
or NL-DA) for example, a complete APP peptide or variant, an APP fragment, a<br>
recombinant or synthetic APP, or a fusion peptide. Preferably, the fusion peptide<br>
includes the beta-secretase cleavage site fused to a peptide having a moiety useful<br>
for enzymatic assay, for example, having isolation and/or detection properties. A<br>
useful moiety may be an antigenic epitope for antibody binding, a label or other<br>
detection moiety, a binding substrate, and the like.<br>
Antibodies<br>
Products characteristic of APP cleavage can be measured by immunoassay<br>
using various antibodies, as described, for example, in Pirttila et al., 1999, Neuro,<br>
Lett. 249:21-4, and in U.S. Patent No. 5,612,486. Useful antibodies to detect A beta<br>
include, for example, the monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Senetek, St. Louis, MO) that<br>
specifically recognizes an epitope on amino acids 1-16 of the A beta peptide;<br>
antibodies 162 and 164 (New York State Institute for Basic Research, Staten Island,<br>
NY) that are specific for human A beta 1-40 and 1-42, respectively; and antibodies<br>
that recognize the junction region of beta-amyloid peptide, the site between residues<br>
16 and 17, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,593,846. Antibodies raised against a<br>
synthetic peptide of residues 591 to 596 of APP and SW192 antibody raised against<br>
590-596 of the Swedish mutation are also useful in immunoassay of APP and its<br>
cleavage products, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,604,102 and 5,721,130.<br>
Assay Systems<br>
Assays for determining APP cleavage at the beta-secretase cleavage site are<br>
well known in the art. Exemplary assays, are described, for example, in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,744,346 and 5,942,400, and described in the Examples below.<br>
Cell Free Assays<br>
Exemplary assays that can be used to demonstrate the inhibitory activity of<br>
the compounds employed in the methods of the invention are described, for<br>
example, in WO00/17369, WO 00/03819, and U.S. Patents No. 5,942,400 and<br>
5,744,346. Such assays can be performed in cell-free incubations or in cellular<br>
incubations using cells expressing a beta-secretase and an APP substrate having a<br>
beta-secretase cleavage site.<br>
An APP substrate containing the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP, for<br>
example, a complete APP or variant, an APP fragment, or a recombinant or<br>
synthetic APP substrate containing the amino acid sequence: KM-DA or NL-DA, is<br>
incubated in the presence of beta-secretase enzyme, a fragment thereof, or a<br>
synthetic or recombinant polypeptide variant having beta-secretase activity and<br>
effective to cleave the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP, under incubation<br>
conditions suitable for the cleavage activity of the enzyme. Suitable substrates<br>
optionally include derivatives that may be fusion proteins or peptides that contain<br>
the substrate peptide and a modification useful to facilitate the purification or<br>
detection of the peptide or its beta-secretase cleavage products. Useful<br>
modifications include the insertion of a known antigenic epitope for antibody<br>
binding; the linking of a label or detectable moiety, the linking of a binding<br>
substrate, and the like.<br>
Suitable incubation conditions for a cell-free in vitro assay include, for<br>
example: approximately 200 nanomolar to 10 micromolar substrate, approximately<br>
10 to 200 picomolar enzyme, and approximately 0.1 nanomolar to 10 micromolar<br>
inhibitor compound, in aqueous solution, at an approximate pH of 4 -7, at<br>
approximately 37 degrees C, for a time period of approximately 10 minutes to 3<br>
hours. These incubation conditions are exemplary only, and can be varied as<br>
required for the particular assay components and/or desired measurement system.<br>
Optimization of the incubation conditions for the particular assay components<br>
should account for the specific beta-secretase enzyme used and its pH optimum, any<br>
additional enzymes and/or markers that might be used in the assay, and the like.<br>
Such optimization is routine and will not require undue experimentation.<br>
One useful assay utilizes a fusion peptide having maltose binding protein<br>
(MBP) fused to the C-terminal 125 amino acids of APP-SW. The MBP portion is<br>
captured on an assay substrate by anti-MBP capture antibody. Incubation of the<br>
captured fusion protein in the presence of beta-secretase results in cleavage of the<br>
substrate at the beta-secretase cleavage site. Analysis of the cleavage activity can<br>
be, for example, by immunoassay of cleavage products. One such immunoassay<br>
detects a unique epitope exposed at the carboxy terminus of the cleaved fusion<br>
protein, for example, using the antibody SW192. This assay is described, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent No 5,942,400.<br>
Cellular Assay<br>
Numerous cell-based assays can be used to analyze beta-secretase activity<br>
and/or processing of APP to release A beta. Contact of an APP substrate with a<br>
beta-secretase enzyme within the cell and in the presence or absence of a compound<br>
inhibitor of the invention can be used to demonstrate beta-secretase inhibitory<br>
activity of the compound. Preferably, assay in the presence of a useful inhibitory<br>
compound provides at least about 30%, most preferably at least about 50%<br>
inhibition of the enzymatic activity, as compared with a non-inhibited control.<br>
In one embodiment, cells that naturally express beta-secretase are used.<br>
Alternatively, cells are modified to express a recombinant beta-secretase or synthetic<br>
variant enzyme as discussed above. The APP substrate may be added to the culture<br>
medium and is preferably expressed in the cells. Cells that naturally express APP,<br>
variant or mutant forms of APP, or cells transformed to express an isoform of APP,<br>
mutant or variant APP., recombinant or synthetic APP, APP fragment, or synthetic<br>
APP peptide or fusion protein containing the beta-secretase APP cleavage site can<br>
be used, provided that the expressed APP is permitted to contact the enzyme and<br>
enzymatic cleavage activity can be analyzed.<br>
Human cell lines that normally process A beta from APP provide a useful<br>
means to assay inhibitory activities of the compounds employed in the methods of<br>
the invention. Production and release of A beta and/or other cleavage products into<br>
the culture medium can be measured, for example by immunoassay, such as Western<br>
blot or enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) such as by ELISA.<br>
Cells expressing an APP substrate and an active beta-secretase can be<br>
incubated in the presence of a compound inhibitor to demonstrate inhibition of<br>
enzymatic activity as compared with a control. Activity of beta-secretase can be<br>
measured by analysis of one or more cleavage products of the APP substrate. For<br>
example, inhibition of beta-secretase activity against the substrate APP would be<br>
expected to decrease release of specific beta-secretase induced APP cleavage<br>
products such as A beta.<br>
Although both neural and non-neural cells process and release A beta, levels<br>
of endogenous beta-secretase activity are low and often difficult to detect by EIA.<br>
The use of cell types known to have enhanced beta-secretase activity, enhanced<br>
processing of APP to A beta, and/or enhanced production of A beta are therefore<br>
preferred. For example, transfection of cells with the Swedish Mutant form of APP<br>
(APP-SW); with APP-KK; or with APP-SW-KK provides cells having enhanced<br>
beta-secretase activity and producing amounts of A beta that can be readily<br>
measured.<br>
In such assays, for example, the cells expressing APP and beta-secretase are<br>
incubated in a culture medium under conditions suitable for beta-secretase<br>
enzymatic activity at its cleavage site on the APP substrate. On exposure of the cells<br>
to the compound inhibitor, the amount of A beta released into the medium and/or the<br>
amount of CTF99 fragments of APP in the cell lysates is reduced as compared with<br>
the control. The cleavage products of APP can be analyzed, for example, by<br>
immune reactions with specific antibodies, as discussed above.<br>
Preferred cells for analysis of beta-secretase activity include primary human<br>
neuronal cells, primary transgenic animal neuronal cells where the transgene is APP,<br>
and other cells such as those of a stable 293 cell line expressing APP, for example,<br>
APP-SW.<br>
In vivo Assays: Animal Models<br>
Various animal models can be used to analyze beta-secretase activity and /or<br>
processing of APP to release A beta, as described above. For example, transgenic<br>
animals expressing APP substrate and beta-secretase enzyme can be used to<br>
demonstrate inhibitory activity of the compounds employed in the methods of the<br>
invention. Certain transgenic animal models have been described, for example, in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,877,399; 5,612,486; 5,387,742; 5,720,936; 5,850,003;<br>
5,877,015,, and 5,811,633, and in Ganes et al., 1995, Nature 373:523. Preferred are<br>
animals that exhibit characteristics associated with the pathophysiology of AD.<br>
Administration of the compound inhibitors of the invention to the transgenic mice<br>
described herein provides an alternative method for demonstrating the inhibitory<br>
activity of the compounds. Administration of the compounds in a pharmaceutically<br>
effective carrier and via an administrative route that reaches the target tissue in an<br>
appropriate therapeutic amount is also preferred.<br>
Inhibition of beta-secretase mediated cleavage of APP at the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site and of A beta release can be analyzed in these animals by measure of<br>
cleavage fragments in the animal"s body fluids such as cerebral fluid or tissues.<br>
Analysis of brain tissues for A beta deposits or plaques is preferred.<br>
On contacting an APP substrate with a beta-secretase enzyme in the presence<br>
of an inhibitory compound employed in the method of the invention and under<br>
conditions sufficient to permit enzymatic mediated cleavage of APP and/or release<br>
of A beta from the substrate, the compounds employed in the methods of the<br>
invention are effective to reduce beta-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP at the<br>
beta-secretase cleavage site and/or effective to reduce released amounts of A beta.<br>
Where such contacting is the administration of the inhibitory compounds employed<br>
in the methods of the invention to an animal model, for example, as described above,<br>
the compounds are effective to reduce A beta deposition in brain tissues of the<br>
animal, and to reduce the number and/or size of beta amyloid plaques. Where such<br>
administration is to a human subject, the compounds are effective to inhibit or slow<br>
the progression of disease characterized by enhanced amounts of A beta, to slow the<br>
progression of AD in the, and/or to prevent onset or development of AD in a patient<br>
at risk for the disease.<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all scientific and technical terms used herein have<br>
the same meaning as commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this<br>
invention belongs. All patents and publications referred to herein are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
DEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS<br>
The definitions and explanations below are for the terms as used throughout<br>
this entire document including both the specification and the claims.<br>
I. CONVENTIONS FOR FORMULAS AND DEFINITIONS OF VARIABLES<br>
The chemical formulas representing various compounds or molecular<br>
fragments in the specification and claims may contain variable substituents in<br>
addition to expressly defined structural features. These variable substituents are<br>
identified by a letter or a letter followed by a numerical subscript, for example, "Zi"<br>
or "Rj" where "i" is an integer. These variable substituents are either monovalent or<br>
bivalent, that is, they represent a group attached to the formula by one or two<br>
chemical bonds. For example, a group Z1 would represent a bivalent variable if<br>
attached to the formula CH3-C(=Z1)H. Groups Ri and Rj would represent monoval-<br>
ent variable substituents if attached to the formula CH3-CH2-C(Ri)(Rj)H2. When<br>
chemical formulas are drawn in a linear fashion, such as those above, variable sub-<br>
stituents contained in parentheses are bonded to the atom immediately to the left of<br>
the variable substituent enclosed in parenthesis. When two or more consecutive<br>
variable substituents are enclosed in parentheses, each of the consecutive variable<br>
substituents is bonded to the immediately preceding atom to the left which is not<br>
enclosed in parentheses. Thus, in the formula above, both R, and Rj are bonded to<br>
the preceding carbon atom. Also, for any molecule with an established system of<br>
carbon atom numbering, such as steroids, these carbon atoms are designated as Ci,<br>
where "i" is the integer corresponding to the carbon atom number. For example, C6<br>
represents the 6 position or carbon atom number in the steroid nucleus as tradition-<br>
ally designated by those skilled in the art of steroid chemistry. Likewise the term<br>
"R6" represents a variable substituent (either monovalent or bivalent) at the C6<br>
position.<br>
Chemical formulas or portions thereof drawn in a linear fashion represent<br>
atoms in a linear chain. The symbol"-" in general represents a bond between two<br>
atoms in the chain. Thus CH3-O-CH2-CH(Ri)-CH3 represents a 2-substituted-1-<br>
methoxypropane compound. In a similar fashion, the symbol "=" represents a<br>
double bond, e.g., CH2=C(Rj)-O-CH3, and the symbol "=" represents a triple bond,<br>
e.g., HC=C-CH(Ri)-CH2-CH3. Carbonyl groups are represented in either one of two<br>
ways: -CO- or -C(=O)-, with the former being preferred for simplicity.<br>
Chemical formulas of cyclic (ring) compounds or molecular fragments can<br>
be represented in a linear fashion. Thus, the compound 4-chloro-2-methylpyridine<br>
can be represented in linear fashion by N*=C(CH3)-CH=CC1-CH=C*H with the<br>
convention that the atoms marked with an asterisk (*) are bonded to each other<br>
resulting in the formation of a ring. Likewise, the cyclic molecular fragment, 4-<br>
(ethyl)-l-piperazinyl can be represented by -N*-(CH2)2-N(C2H5)-CH2-C*H2.<br>
A rigid cyclic (ring) structure for any compounds herein defines an<br>
orientation with respect to the plane of the ring for substituents attached to each<br>
carbon atom of the rigid cyclic compound. For saturated compounds which have<br>
two substituents attached to a carbon atom which is part of a cyclic system, -<br>
C(X1)(X2)- the two substituents may be in either an axial or equatorial position<br>
relative to the ring and may change between axial/equatorial. However, the position<br>
of the two substituents relative to the ring and each other remains fixed. While<br>
either substituent at times may lie in the plane of the ring (equatorial) rather than<br>
above or below the plane (axial), one substituent is always above the other. In<br>
chemical structural formulas depicting such compounds, a substituent (X"i) which is<br>
"below" another substituent (X2) will be identified as being in the alpha<br>
configuration and is identified by a broken, dashed or dotted line attachment to the<br>
carbon atom, i.e., by the symbol"----" or "...". The corresponding substituent<br>
attached "above" (X2) the other (X1) is identified as being in the beta configuration<br>
and is indicated by an unbroken line attachment to the carbon atom.<br>
When a variable substituent is bivalent, the valences may be taken together<br>
or separately or both in the definition of the variable. For example, a variable Ri<br>
attached to a carbon atom as -C(=Ri)- might be bivalent and be defined as oxo or<br>
keto (thus forming a carbonyl group (-CO-) or as two separately attached<br>
monovalent variable substituents alpha-Ri_j and beta-Ri-k. When a bivalent variable,<br>
Ri, is defined to consist of two monovalent variable substituents, the convention<br>
used to define the bivalent variable is of the form "alpha-Ri-j:beta-Ri-k" or some<br>
variant thereof. In such a case both alpha-Ri-j and beta-Ri-k are attached to the<br>
carbon atom to give -C(alpha-Ri-j)(beta-Ri-k)-. For example, when the bivalent<br>
variable R6, -C(=R6)- is defined to consist of two monovalent variable substituents,<br>
the two monovalent variable substituents are alpha-R6-1:beta-R6-2,.... alpha-R6-<br>
9:beta-R6-10, etc, giving -C(alpha-R6-1)(beta-R6-2)-,.... -C(alpha-R6-9)(beta-R6-10)-, etc.<br>
Likewise, for the bivalent variable R11, -C(=R11)-, two monovalent variable substitu-<br>
ents are alpha-R11-1:beta-R11-2. For a ring substituent for which separate alpha and<br>
beta orientations do not exist (e.g. due to the presence of a carbon carbon double<br>
bond in the ring), and for a substituent bonded to a carbon atom which is not part of<br>
a ring the above convention is still used, but the alpha and beta designations are<br>
omitted.<br>
Just as a bivalent variable may be defined as two separate monovalent<br>
variable substituents, two separate monovalent variable substituents may be defined<br>
to be taken together to form a bivalent variable. For example, in the formula<br>
-C1(Rj)H-C2(Rj)H- (C1 and C2 define arbitrarily a first and second carbon atom,<br>
respectively) Ri and Rj may be defined to be taken together to form (1) a second<br>
bond between C1 and C2 or (2) a bivalent group such as oxa (-O-) and the formula<br>
thereby describes an epoxide. When R, and Rj are taken together to form a more<br>
complex entity, such as the group -X-Y-, then the orientation of the entity is such<br>
that C1 in the above formula is bonded to X and C2 is bonded to Y. Thus, by<br>
convention the designation "... Rj and Rj are taken together to form -CH2-CH2-O-<br>
CO- ..." means a lactone in which the carbonyl is bonded to C2. However, when<br>
designated "... Rj and Ri are taken together to form -CO-O-CH2-CH2-the convention<br>
means a lactone in which the carbonyl is bonded to C1.<br>
The carbon atom content of variable substituents is indicated in one of two<br>
ways. The first method uses a prefix to the entire name of the variable such as "C1-<br>
C4", where both "1" and "4" are integers representing the minimum and maximum<br>
number of carbon atoms in the variable. The prefix is separated from the variable by<br>
a space. For example, "C1-C4 alkyl" represents alkyl of 1 through 4 carbon atoms,<br>
(including isomeric forms thereof unless an express indication to the contrary is<br>
given). Whenever this single prefix is given, the prefix indicates the entire carbon<br>
atom content of the variable being defined. Thus C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl describes a<br>
group CH3-(CH2)n-0-CO- where n is zero, one or two. By the second method the<br>
carbon atom content of only each portion of the definition is indicated separately by<br>
enclosing the "Ci-Cj" designation in parentheses and placing it immediately (no<br>
intervening space) before the portion of the definition being defined. By this<br>
optional convention (C1-C3)alkoxycarbonyl has the same meaning as C2-C4 alkoxy-<br>
carbonyl because the "C1-C3" refers only to the carbon atom content of the alkoxy<br>
group. Similarly while both C2-C6 alkoxyalkyl and (C1-C3)alkoxy(C1-C3)alkyl<br>
define alkoxyalkyl groups containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, the two definitions<br>
differ since the former definition allows either the alkoxy or alkyl portion alone to<br>
contain 4 or 5 carbon atoms while the latter definition limits either of these groups to<br>
3 carbon atoms.<br>
When the claims contain a fairly complex (cyclic) substituent, at the end of<br>
the phrase naming/designating that particular substituent will be a notation in<br>
(parentheses) which will correspond to the same name/designation in one of the<br>
CHARTS which will also set forth the chemical structural formula of that particular<br>
substituent.<br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
Example A<br>
Enzyme Inhibition Assay<br>
The compounds of the invention are analyzed for inhibitory activity by use<br>
of the MBP-C125 assay. This assay determines the relative inhibition of beta-<br>
secretase cleavage of a model APP substrate, MBP-C125SW, by the compounds<br>
assayed as compared with an untreated control. A detailed description of the assay<br>
parameters can be found, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,942,400. Briefly, the<br>
substrate is a fusion peptide formed of maltose binding protein (MBP) and the<br>
carboxy terminal 125 amino acids of APP-SW, the Swedish mutation. The beta-<br>
secretase enzyme is derived from human brain tissue as described in Sinha et.al,<br>
1999, Nature 40:537-540) or recombinantly produced as the full-length enzyme<br>
(amino acids 1-501), and can be prepared, for example, from 293 cells expressing<br>
the recombinant cDNA, as described in WO00/47618.<br>
Inhibition of the enzyme is analyzed, for example, by immunoassay of the<br>
enzyme"s cleavage products. One exemplary ELISA uses an anti-MBP capture<br>
antibody that is deposited on precoated and blocked 96-well high binding plates,<br>
followed by incubation with diluted enzyme reaction supernatant, incubation with a<br>
specific reporter antibody, for example, biotinylated anti-SW192 reporter antibody,<br>
and further incubation with streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase. In the assay,<br>
cleavage of the intact MBP-C125SW fusion protein results in the generation of a<br>
truncated amino-terminal fragment, exposing a new SW-192 antibody-positive<br>
epitope at the carboxy terminus. Detection is effected by a fluorescent substrate<br>
signal on cleavage by the phosphatase. ELISA only detects cleavage following Leu<br>
596 at the substrate"s APP-SW 751 mutation site.<br>
Specific Assay Procedure:<br>
Compounds are diluted in a 1:1 dilution series to a six-point concentration<br>
curve (two wells per concentration) in one 96-plate row per compound tested. Each<br>
of the test compounds is prepared in DMSO to make up a 10 millimolar stock<br>
solution. The stock solution is serially diluted in DMSO to obtain a final compound<br>
concentration of 200 micromolar at the high point of a 6-point dilution curve. Ten<br>
(10) microliters of each dilution is added to each of two wells on row C of a<br>
corresponding V-bottom plate to which 190 microliters of 52 millimolar NaOAc,<br>
7.9% DMSO, pH 4.5 are pre-added. The NaOAc diluted compound plate is spun<br>
down to pellet precipitant and 20 microliters/well is transferred to a corresponding<br>
fiat-bottom plate to which 30 microliters of ice-cold enzyme-substrate mixture (2.5<br>
microliters MBP-C125SW substrate, 0.03 microliters enzyme and 24.5 microliters<br>
ice cold 0.09% TX100 per 30 microliters) is added. The final reaction mixture of<br>
200 micromolar compound at the highest curve point is in 5% DMSO, 20 millimolar<br>
NaAc, 0.06% TX100, at pH 4.5.<br>
Warming the plates to 37 degrees C starts the enzyme reaction. After 90<br>
minutes at 37 degrees C, 200 microliters/well cold specimen diluent is added to stop<br>
the reaction and 20 microliters/well is transferred to a corresponding anti-MBP<br>
antibody coated ELISA plate for capture, containing 80 microliters/well specimen<br>
diluent. This reaction is incubated overnight at 4 degrees C and the ELISA is<br>
developed the next day after a 2 hour incubation with anti-192SW antibody,<br>
followed by Streptavidin-AP conjugate and fluorescent substrate. The signal is read<br>
on a fluorescent plate reader.<br>
Relative compound inhibition potency is determined by calculating the<br>
concentration of compound that showed a fifty percent reduction in detected signal<br>
(IC50) compared to the enzyme reaction signal in the control wells with no added<br>
compound. In this assay, the compounds of the invention exhibited an IC50 of less<br>
than 50 micromolar.<br>

the inhibitory compounds of the invention. Useful substrates include the following:<br>
Biotin-SEVNL-DAEFR[oregon green]KK                        [SEQ ID NO: 1 ]<br>
Biotin-SEVKM-DAEFR[oregon green]KK                       [SEQ ID NO: 2]<br>
Biotin-GLNIKTEEISEISY-EVEFRC[oregon green]KK [SEQ ID NO: 3]<br>

[SEQ ID NO: 5]<br>
The enzyme (0.1 nanomolar) and test compounds (0.001 - 100 micromolar)<br>
are incubated in pre-blocked, low affinity, black plates (384 well) at 37 degrees C<br>
for 30 minutes. The reaction is initiated by addition of 150 millimolar substrate to a<br>
final volume of 30 microh"ter per well. The final assay conditions are: 0.001-100<br>
micromolar compound inhibitor; 0.1 molar sodium acetate (pH 4.5); 150 nanomolar<br>
substrate; 0.1 nanomolar soluble beta-secretase; 0.001% Tween 20, and 2% DMSO.<br>
The assay mixture is incubated for 3 hours at 37 ° C, and the reaction is terminated<br>
by the addition of a saturating concentration of immunopure streptavidin. After<br>
incubation with streptavidin at room temperature for 15 minutes, fluorescence<br>
polarization is measured, for example, using a LJL Acqurest (Ex485 nm/ Em530<br>
nm). The activity of the beta-secretase enzyme is detected by changes in the<br>
fluorescence polarization that occur when the substrate is cleaved by the enzyme.<br>
Incubation in the presence or absence of compound inhibitor demonstrates specific<br>
inhibition of beta-secretase enzymatic cleavage of its synthetic APP substrate. In this<br>
assay, compounds of the invention exhibited an IC50 of less than 50 micromolar.<br>
Example C<br>
Beta-secretase inhibition: P26-P4"SW assay<br>
Synthetic substrates containing the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP are used to<br>
assay beta-secretase activity, using the methods described, for example, in published<br>
PCT application WO00/47618. The P26-P4"SW substrate is a peptide of the<br>
sequence: (biotin)CGGADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNLDAEF [SEQ ID<br>
NO: 6]<br>
The P26-P1 standard has the sequence:<br>
(biotin)CGGADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL                   [SEQ ID NO: 7]<br>
Briefly, the biotin-coupled synthetic substrates are incubated at a<br>
concentration of from about 0 to about 200 micromolar in this assay. When testing<br>
inhibitory compounds, a substrate concentration of about 1.0 micromolar is<br>
preferred. Test compounds diluted in DMSO are added to the reaction mixture, with<br>
a final DMSO concentration of 5%. Controls also contain a final DMSO<br>
concentration of 5%. The concentration of beta secretase enzyme in the reaction is<br>
varied, to give product concentrations with the linear range of the ELISA assay,<br>
about 125 to 2000 picomolar, after dilution.<br>
The reaction mixture also includes 20 millimolar sodium acetate, pH 4.5,<br>
0.06% Triton X100, and is incubated at 37 degrees C for about 1 to 3 hours.<br>
Samples are then diluted in assay buffer (for example, 145.4 nanomolar sodium<br>
chloride, 9.51 millimolar sodium phosphate, 7.7 millimolar sodium azide, 0.05%<br>
Triton X405, 6g/liter bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to quench the reaction, then<br>
diluted further for immunoassay of the cleavage products.<br>
Cleavage products can be assayed by ELISA. Diluted samples and standards<br>
are incubated in assay plates coated with capture antibody, for example, S Wl 92, for<br>
about 24 hours at 4 degrees C. After washing in TTBS buffer (150 millimolar<br>
sodium chloride, 25 millimolar Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), the samples are<br>
incubated with strepavidin-AP according to the manufacturer"s, instructions. After a<br>
one hour incubation at room temperature, the samples are washed in TTBS and<br>
incubated with fluorescent substrate solution A (31.2 g/liter 2-amino-2-methyl-l-<br>
propanol, 30 mg/liter, pH 9.5). Reaction with streptavidin-alkaline phosphate<br>
permits detection by fluorescence. Compounds that are effective inhibitors of beta-<br>
secretase activity demonstrate reduced cleavage of the substrate as compared to a<br>
control.<br>
Example D<br>
Assays using Synthetic Oligopeptide-Substrates<br>
Synthetic oligopeptides are prepared that incorporate the known cleavage site<br>
of beta-secretase, and optionally detectable tags, such as fluorescent or<br>
chouromogenic moieties. Examples of such peptides, as well as their production<br>
and detection methods are described in U.S. Patent No: 5,942,400, herein<br>
incorporated by reference. Cleavage products can be detected using high<br>
performance liquid chouromatography, or fluorescent or chouromogenic detection<br>
methods appropriate to the peptide to be detected, according to methods well known<br>
in the art.<br>
By way of example, one such peptide has the sequence SEVNL-DAEF [SEQ ID<br>
NO: 8], and the cleavage site is between residues 5 and 6. Another preferred<br>
substrate has the sequence ADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL-DAEF [SEQ<br>
ED NO: 9], and the cleavage site is between residues 26 and 27.<br>
These synthetic APP substrates are incubated in the presence of beta-<br>
secretase under conditions sufficient to result in beta-secretase mediated cleavage of<br>
the substrate. Comparison of the cleavage results in the presence of the compound<br>
inhibitor to control results provides a measure of the compound"s inhibitory activity.<br>
Example E<br>
Inhibition of beta-secretase activity - cellular assay<br>
An exemplary assay for the analysis of inhibition of beta-secretase activity<br>
utilizes the human embryonic kidney cell line HEKp293 (ATCC Accession No.<br>
CRL-1573) transfected with APP751 containing the naturally occurring double<br>
mutation Lys651Met52 to Asn651Leu652 (numbered for APP751), commonly<br>
called the Swedish mutation and shown to overproduce A beta (Citron et.al., 1992,<br>
Nature 360:672-61r4), as described in USPN 5,604,102.<br>
The cells are incubated in the presence/absence of the inhibitory compound<br>
(diluted in DMSO) at the desired concentration, generally up to 10 micrograms/ml.<br>
At the end of the treatment period, conditioned media is analyzed for beta-secretase<br>
activity, for example, by analysis of cleavage fragments. A beta can be analyzed by<br>
immunoassay, using specific detection antibodies. The enzymatic activity is<br>
measured in the presence and absence of the compound inhibitors to demonstrate<br>
specific inhibition of beta-secretase mediated cleavage of APP substrate.<br>
Example F<br>
Inhibition of Beta-Secretase in Animal Models of AD<br>
Various animal models can be used to screen for inhibition of beta-secretase<br>
activity. Examples of animal models useful in the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, mouse, guinea pig, dog, and the like. The animals used can be wild type,<br>
transgenic, or knockout models. In addition, mammalian models can express<br>
mutations in APP, such as APP695-SW and the like described herein. Examples of<br>
transgenic non-human mammalian models are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,604,102, 5,912,410 and 5,811,633.<br>
PDAPP mice, prepared as described in Games et al., 1995, Nature 373:523-<br>
527 are useful to analyze in vivo suppression of A beta release in the presence of<br>
putative inhibitory compounds. As described in USPN 6,191,166,4 month old<br>
PDAPP mice are administered compound formulated in vehicle, such as corn oil.<br>
The mice are dosed with compound (1-30 mg/ml; preferably 1-10 mg/ml). After<br>
time, e.g., 3-10 hours, the animals are sacrificed, and brains removed for analysis.<br>
Transgenic animals are administered an amount of the compound inhibitor<br>
formulated in a carrier suitable for the chosen mode of administration. Control<br>
animals are untreated, treated with vehicle, or treated with an inactive compound.<br>
Administration can be acute, i.e., single dose or multiple doses in one day, or can be<br>
chouronic, i.e., dosing is repeated daily for a period of days. Beginning at time 0,<br>
brain tissue or cerebral fluid is obtained from selected animals and analyzed for the<br>
presence of APP cleavage peptides, including A beta, for example, by immunoassay<br>
using specific antibodies for A beta detection. At the end of the test period, animals<br>
are sacrificed and brain tissue or cerebral fluid is analyzed for the presence of A beta<br>
and/or beta-amyloid plaques. The tissue is also analyzed for necrosis.<br>
Animals administered the compound inhibitors of the invention are expected<br>
to demonstrate reduced A beta in brain tissues or cerebral fluids and reduced beta<br>
amyloid plaques in brain tissue, as compared with non-treated controls.<br>
Example G<br>
Inhibition of A beta production in human patients<br>
Patients suffering from Alzheimer"s Disease (AD) demonstrate an increased<br>
amount of A beta in the brain. AD patients are administered an amount of the<br>
compound inhibitor formulated in a carrier suitable for the chosen mode of<br>
administration. Administration is repeated daily for the duration of the test period.<br>
Beginning on day 0, cognitive and memory tests are performed, for example, once<br>
per month.<br>
Patients administered the compound inhibitors are expected to demonstrate<br>
slowing or stabilization of disease progression as analyzed by changes in one or<br>
more of the following disease parameters: A beta present in CSF or plasma; brain or<br>
hippocampal volume; A beta deposits in the brain; amyloid plaque in the brain;<br>
and scores for cognitive and memory function, as compared with control, non-<br>
treated patients.<br>
Example H<br>
Prevention of A beta production in patients at risk for AD<br>
Patients predisposed or at risk for developing AD are identified either by<br>
recognition of a familial inheritance pattern, for example, presence of the Swedish<br>
Mutation, and/or by monitoring diagnostic parameters. Patients identified as<br>
predisposed or at risk for developing AD are administered an amount of the<br>
compound inhibitor formulated in a carrier suitable for the chosen mode of<br>
administration. Administration is repeated daily for the duration of the test period.<br>
Beginning on day 0, cognitive and memory tests are performed, for exmple, once<br>
per month.<br>
Patients administered the compound inhibitors are expected to demonstrate<br>
slowing or stabilization of disease progression as analyzed by changes in one or<br>
more of the following disease parameters: A beta present in CSF or plasma; brain or<br>
hippocampal volume; amyloid plaque in the brain; and scores for cognitive and<br>
memory function, as compared with control, non-treated patients.<br>
