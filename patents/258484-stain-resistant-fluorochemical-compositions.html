STAIN-RESISTANT FLUOROCHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to coating compositions. More specifically, the invention relates to coating compositions comprising a non-urethane (meth)acryl compound and a fluorochemical.<br>
Background<br>
Certain commonly used materials, such as optical displays, textiles, metlas, stone, wood, leather, etc, are susceptible to scratches, abrasion, and soiling during routine use. In some instances, protective films or coatings may be applied to the surfaces of these materials in order to provide protection and enhance durability, performance, and appearance.<br>
UV-curable systems based on the polymerization of an acrylic resin, such as a urethane (meth)acrylate compound, have been used as protective coating compositions for a variety of surfaces. In some instances, it may be desirable to modify or enhance the performance of these coatings by introducing particular structures, such as fluorinated groups, into the polymeric network. Fluorinated groups can be incorporated into these compositions through the copolymerization of the acrylic resin with a low amount (
Although various protective coatings have been developed using fluorinated polymers, a need remains for improved coating compositions with better performance and longevity than existing systems.<br><br>
Summary of Invention<br>
In is often desirable for a protective topcoat layer to be stain-resistant in order to improve the look and appearance of the coated surface. One approach for providing stain resistance is to incorporate a fluorochemical compound into the topcoat composition. We found that, under certain circumstances, ambient light can degrade urethane-containing topcoats thus reducing the stain resistance of the fluorochemical additives. We have also found that certain stains and dyes have a high affinity for the urethane-groups present in many of the acrylate materials that are typically used in protective surface coating compositionss thereby hindering the improved stain resistance provided by the fluorochemical.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention features a coating composition that comprises a non-urethane acryl or methacryl compound in combination with a fluorochemical. Typically, the non-urethane (meth)acryl compound is an aliphatic or aromatic (meth)acryl compound. The fluorochemical typically comprises a monofunctional (per)fluoropolyether (meth)acryl compound or a C8F17C2H402CCH=CH2 telomer. In other embodiments, the fluorochemical may be C4F9S02NMrC2H4OC(0)CRCH2, C4F9CH2CH2OC(0)CH=CH2, or C6F)3CH2CH20C(0)CRCH2 wherein R is H, methyl or other lower alkyl<br>
In yet another embodiment, the fluorochemical may comprise a compound represented by the structure CPF2p+iS02(R)C2H402CCH=CH2, where R is a O, to Ce alkyl group.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the fluorochemical may comprise a compound represented by the formula CpF2p+iC2H402CCH=CH2, where p is a 3, to 20 and prefereably averages between 6 and 8.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the coating composition may comprise a combination of a urethane (meth)acryl compound and a non-urethane (meth)acryl compound. Typically, the coating composition contains less than 50 percent, more typically less than 30 percent, most typically less than 10 percent by weight of a urethane-containing (meth)acrylate. In other embodiments, the coating composition is substantially free of urethane (meth)acrylate.<br><br>
The compositions of the invention are typically photopolymerizable and thus may further include a photointiator. The compositions may be coated onto a substrate and then polymerized, for example, by exposure to UV radiation. The reaction product of the non-urethane (meth)acryl compound and the fluorochemical monomer(s) forms a stain-resistance protective topcoat on the substrate that maintains it stain resistance even after prolonged exposure to ambient light conditions.<br>
The coating composition of the invention may be used provide a protective topcoat on a variety of substrate surfaces, such as, for example, wood and vinyl.<br>

Suitable structures for divalent Rf groups include, but are not limited to, -CF20(CF2O)q(C2F40)nCFr, -(CF2)30(C4F80)n(CF2)r, -CF20(C2F40)nCF2-, and -CF(CF3)(OCF2CF(CF3))sOCtF2tO(CF(CF3)CF20)nCF(CF3)-, wherein q has an average value of 0 to 50, 1 to 50, 3 to 30, 3 to 15, or 3 to 10; n has an average value of 0 to 50, 3 to 30, 3 to 15, or 3 to 10; s has an average value of 0 to 50, 1 to 50, 3 to 30, 3-to 15, or 3 to 10; the sum (n + s) has an average value of 0 to 50 or 4 to 40; the sum (q + n) is greater than 0; and t is an integer of 2 to 6.<br>
As synthesized, compounds according to Formula II typically include a mixture of Rf groups. The average structure is the structure averaged over the mixture components. The values of q, n, and s in these average structures can vary, as long as the compound has a number average molecular weight of at least about 400. Compounds of Formula I often have a molecular weight (number average) of 400 to 5000, 800 to 4000, or 1000 to 3000.<br>
The linking group W between the perfluoropolyether segment and (meth)acryl or -COCF=CH2 endgroup includes a divalent group selected from an alkylene, arylene, heteroalkylene, or combinations thereof and an optional divalent group selected from carbonyl, carbonyloxy, carbonylimino, sulfonamido, or combinations thereof.

Alternatively or in addition to at least one monofunctional (per)fluoropolyether acrylate compound, the (per)fluoropolyether acrylate compound may be polyfunctional, having two or more (meth)acryl groups such as (meth)acrylate groups.<br>
One type of preferred polyfunctional perfluoropolyether acrylate compounds comprises at least one terminal F(CF(CF3)CF20)aCF(CF3)- group wherein a averages 4 to 15. In some embodiments, the polyfunctional perfluoropolyether acrylates comprises a terminal HFPO- group. As used herein "HFPO-" refers to the structure F(CF(CF3)CF20)aCF(CF3)- wherein a averages 6 to 7 (e.g. 6.3). Exemplary compounds include for example<br>
HFPO-C(0)N(H)C(CH2OC(0)CH=CH2)2CH2CH3)and HFPO-C(0)N(H)C(CH2OC(0)CH=CH2)2H.<br>
Theperfluoropolyther acrylate comprising at least one terminal HFPO-group and at least two (meth)acryl groups can be prepared in a two step process. The first step is by reaction of poly(hexafluoropropylene oxide) esters, such as HFPO-C(0)OCH3 or acid halides HFPO-C(0)F, with materials containing at least 3 alcohol or primary or secondary amino groups to produce HFPO- amide poiyols or polyamines, HFPO- ester poiyols or polyamines, or HFPO- amides, or HFPO-esters with mixed amine and alcohol groups. The second is (meth)acrylation of the alcohol and/or amine groups with (meth)acryloyl halides, (meth)acrylic anhydrides or (meth)acrylic acid. Exemplary syntheses thereof are set forth in the examples.<br>
In other embodiments, the (per)fluoropolyether acrylate compound may be a compound preparable by Michael-type addition of a reactive (per)fluoropolyether with a poly(meth)acrylate, such as the adduct of HFPO-<br>
C(0)N(H)CH2CH2CH2N(H)CH3 with trirnethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA). Such (per)fluoropolyether acrylate compounds are further described in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/841,792 "Polymerizable Compositions, Methods of Making the Same, and Composite Articles Therefrom", filed on May 7,2004.<br><br>

(RA)-W-(CH2RF1-H)	(Formula III)<br>
wherein RA is as previously described (i.e. a (meth)acrylate or a CH2=CFCO group); RF1 is a fluoroalkylene group comprising 2 to 7 carbon atoms; and W is a linking group. RA of Formula III is preferably an acrylate group. RF1 may be a linear or branched perfluorinated alkylene moiety.<br>
Other suitable perfluoropolyether monomers are described by Larson, et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,614,667 at column 4, lines 24-55, cited portion.<br>
The monofiinctional fluorinated compounds of Formula III can be synthesized by known techniques. An exemplary monofunctional fluorinated compound of Formula III, co-hydro 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentyl acrylate (H-C4Fg-CH20-C(0)-CH=CH2), is commercially available from Oakwood Products, West Columbia, S.C. Monofunctional fluorinated compounds of Formula III having the formula H(CF2)nCH2OCOCH=CH2 where n= 2, 4, and 6 as well as CF3CHFCF2CH2OCOC(CH3)CH2 (2,2,3,4,4,4 hexafluorobutyl methacrylate) are commercially available from Lancaster Chemical, Windham, NH.<br>
The inclusion of one or more monofunctional fluorinated compounds of Formula III can further improve the compatibility of at least certain perfluoropolyether acrylate compounds with the poly(meth)acrylate crosslinking agents. This aspect is particularly advantageous for embodiments wherein a monofunctional perfluoropolyether acrylate compound is employed such HFPO-C(0)N(H)CH2CH2OC(0)CH=CH2.<br>
The amount of monofunctional fluorinated compound(s) of Formula III utilized in the coating composition of the invention can vary depending on the kind and amount of (per)fluoropolyether acrylate compound employed. Typically, the amount ranges from about half the amount of the (per)fluoropolyether acrylate<br><br>
compound to about twice the amount of the (per)fluoropolyether acrylate compound.<br>
Initiators for polymerization of the coating composition<br>
To facilitate curing, polymerizable compositions according to the present invention may further comprise at least one free-radical thermal initiator and/or photoinitiator. Typically, if such an initiator and/or photoinitiator are present, it comprises less than about 10 percent by weight, more typically less than about 5 percent of the polymerizable composition, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition. Free-radical curing techniques are well known in the art and include, for example, thermal curing methods as well as radiation curing methods such as electron beam or ultraviolet radiation. Further details concerning free radical thermal and photopolymerization techniques may be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,233 (Grant et ah); 4,855,184 (Klun et al.); and 6,224,949 (Wright et ah).<br>
Useful free-radical thermal initiators include, for example, azo, peroxide, persulfate, and redox initiators, and combinations thereof.<br>
Useful free-radical photoinitiators include, for example, those known as useful in the UV cure of acrylate polymers. Such initiators include benzophenone and its derivatives; benzoin, alpha-methylbenzoin, alpha-phenylbenzoin, alpha-allylbenzoin, alpha-benzylbenzoin; benzoin ethers such as benzil dimethyl ketal (commercially available under the trade designation "IRGACURE 651" from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation of Tarrytown, New York), benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin n-butyl ether; acetophenone and its derivatives such as 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-l-propanone (commercially available under the trade designation "DAROCUR 1173" from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation) and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (commercially available under the trade designation "IRGACURE 184", also from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation); 2-methyl-l-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-(4-morpholinyl)-l-propanone commercially available under the trade designation "IRGACURE 907", also from Ciba Specialty<br><br>
Chemicals Corporation); 2-benzyl-2- (dimethy!amino)-l-[4-(4-nnorpholiny])phenyl]-]~bulanone commercially available under the trade designation "IRGACURE 369" from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation); aromatic ketones such as benzophenone and its derivatives and anthraquinone and its derivatives; onium salts such as diazonium salts, iodonium salts, sulfonium salts; titanium complexes such as, for example, that which is commercially available under the trade designation "CGI 784 DC", also from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation); halornethylnitrobenzenes; and mono- and bis-acylphosphines such as those available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation under the trade designations "IRGACURE 1700", "IRGACURE 1800", "IRGACURE 1850VIRGACURE 819" "IRGACURE 2005", "IRGACURE 2010", "IRGACURE 2020" and "DAROCUR 4265". Combinations of two or more photoinitiators may be used. Further, sensitizers such as 2-isopropyl thioxanthone, commercially available from First Chemical Corporation, Pascagoula, MS, may be used in conjunction with photoinitiator(s) such as ""IRGACURE 369".<br>
Other reactive and non-reactive ingredients A variety of inorganic oxide particles can be used in the coating compositions. The particles are typically substantially spherical in shape and relatively uniform in size. The particles can have a substantially monodisperse size distribution or a polymodal distribution obtained by blending two or more substantially monodisperse distributions. The inorganic oxide particles are typically non-aggregated (substantially discrete), as aggregation can result in precipitation of the inorganic oxide particles or gelation of the hardcoat. The inorganic oxide particles are typically colloidal in size, having an average particle diameter of about 0.001 to about 0.2 micrometers, less than about 0.05 micrometers, and less than about 0.03 micrometers. These size ranges facilitate dispersion of the inorganic oxide particles into the binder resin and provide ceramers with desirable surface properties and optical clarity. The average particle size of the inorganic oxide particles can be measured using transmission electron<br><br>
microscopy to count the number of inorganic oxide particles of a given diameter-Inorganic oxide particles include colloidal silica, colloidal titania, colloidal alumina, colloidal zirconia, colloidal vanadia, colloidal chromia, colloidal iron oxide, colloidal antimony oxide, colloidal tin oxide, and mixtures thereof. The inorganic oxide particles can consist essentially of or consist of a single oxide such as silica, or can comprise a combination of oxides, such as silica and aluminum oxide, or a core of an oxide of one type (or a core of a material other than a metal oxide) on which is deposited an oxide of another type. Silica is a common inorganic particle. The inorganic oxide particles are often provided in the form of a sol containing a colloidal dispersion of inorganic oxide particles in liquid media. The sol can be prepared using a variety of techniques and in a variety of forms including hydrosols (where water serves as the liquid medium), organosols (where organic liquids so serve), and mixed sols (where the liquid medium contains both water and an organic liquid), e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,407 (Goetz et al.); 5,677,050 (Bilkadi et al) and 6,299,799 (Craig et al.). Aqueous sols (e.g. of amorphous silica) can be employed. Sols generally contain at least 2 wt-%, at least 10 wt-%, at least 15 wt-%, at least 25 wt-%, and often at least 35 wt-% colloidal inorganic oxide particles based on the total weight of the sol. The amount of colloidal inorganic oxide particle is typically no more than 50 wt-% (e.g. 45 wt-%). The surface of the inorganic particles can be "acrylate functionalized" as described in Bilkadi et al. The sols can also be matched to the pH of the binder, and can contain counterions or water-soluble compounds (e.g., sodium aluminate).<br>
The coating compositions can conveniently be prepared by mixing an aqueous sol of inorganic oxide particles with a free-radically curable binder precursor (e.g., one or more free-radically curable monomers, oligomers or polymers that can participate in a crosslinking reaction upon exposure to a suitable source of curing energy). The resulting composition usually is dried before it is applied, in order to remove substantially all of the water. This drying step is sometimes referred to as "stripping". An organic solvent can be added to the resulting ceramer composition before it is applied, in order to impart improved<br><br>
viscosity characteristics and assist in coating the ceramer composition onto the substrate. After coating, the ceramer composition can be dried to remove any added solvent, and then can be at least partially hardened by exposing the dried composition to a suitable source of energy in order to bring about at least partial cure of the free-radically curable binder precursor.<br>
The coating composition described herein may fijrther various other reactive and non-reactive ingredients. For example the composition may comprise polymerizable (meth)acryl compounds with alkyl, perfluoroalkyl, and perfluoroalkylene moieties. Examples of these compounds include butyl acrylate, lH,lH-2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluorobutyl acrylate, available from Sigma-Aldrich; lH,lH,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate, available from Lancaster Synthesis, Windham, NH; and C4F9S02N(CH3)CH2CH2OC(0)CH-CH2 made by the procedure of Examples 2A and 2B of WO01/30873A. Numerous other (meth)acryl compounds with perfluoroalkyl moieties are mentioned in US 4,968,116 and in US 5,239,026 (including (perfluorocyclohexyl)methyl acrylate).<br>
The compositions described herein are typically, thought not always, free of hydrophilic ingredients since the inclusion of such tends to reduce anti-soiling properties as well as stain certain media. Hydrophilic components are also susceptible to degradation upon exposure to aqueous based cleaning agents.<br>
Those skilled in the art appreciate that the coating compositions can contain other optional adjuvants, such as, binders, surfactants, antistatic agents (e.g., conductive polymers), leveling agents, matting agents (e.g., silica particles), photosensitizers, ultraviolet ("UV") absorbers, stabilizers, antioxidants, lubricants, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, suspending agents and the like. Other particles which may be included in the compositions are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,730,388.<br>
The hardcoat formulation can be water-based or solvent-based or 100% solids with no solvent. Where appropriate, polymerizable components can optionally be diluted, for example, to 10 percent by weight total solids in methyl ethyl ketone. Two percent by weight of a photoinitiator such as DAROCUE 1173 (Ciba Specialty Products, Terrytown, NY) may be included in the polymerizable<br><br>
compositions using a 10 percent solids photoinitiator solutions in methyl ethyl ketone. The photoinitiator can be added before dilution to the final percent by weight total solids. Dilution to the final percent by weight total solids can be achieved, achieved using methyl isobutyl ketone.<br>
Application of coating composition to the substrate<br>
The coating composition can be applied to the hardcoat using a variety of conventional coating methods. Suitable coating methods include, for example, spin coating, knife coating, die coating, wire coating, flood coating, padding, spraying, roll coating, dipping, brushing, foam application, and the like. The coating is dried, typically using a forced air oven. The dried coating is at least partially and typically completely cured using an energy source.<br>
Preferred energy sources include ultraviolet light curing devices that provide a UV "C" dosage of about 5 to 60 millijoules per square centimeter (mJ/cm2). Preferably curing takes place in an environment containing low amounts of oxygen, e.g., less than about 100 parts per million. Nitrogen gas is a preferred environment.<br>
Preferably the coating composition is applied at a sufficient amount to provide a cured layer having a thickness of at least about 10 nanometers, and preferably at least about 25 nanometers. Typically, the cured layer has a thickness of less than about 50 mils, preferably less than about 10 mils, and more preferably less than about 5 mils. Accordingly, the bulk of the durability is provided by the underlying coating layer.<br>
The coating compositions may be applied to a variety of substrates, including those identified in a U.S. Patent Application entitled "Articles Comprising A Fluorochemical Surface Layer and Related Methods," having U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/640,478, filed on December 30, 2004.<br>
Further features and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, which are in no way intended to be limiting thereof. The present invention should not be considered limited to the particular examples described herein, but rather should be understood to cover all aspects of the<br><br>
invention as fairly set out in the attached claims. Various modifications, equivalent processes, as well as numerous structures to which the present invention can be applicable will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art to which the present invention is directed upon review of the instant specification.<br>
EXAMPLES As used in the following examples, "HFPO-" refers to the end group F(CF(CF3)CF20)aCF(CF3)- wherein Ua" ranges between 5 and 12, and averages about 6.3, with an average molecular weight of 1,211 g/mol, and which can be prepared according to the method reported in U.S. Pat. No. 3,250,808 (Moore et al.).<br>
Preparation of Fluorochemical Compounds<br>
The following fluorochemical compounds HFPO-MA and LTMDA, designated herein as FC-1 and FC-2, respectively, and shown in Table l,were used the following examples. The preparation of HFPO-MA and LTMDA are described below.<br><br><br>
1.	Preparation of Monofunctional Perfluoropolyether Methacrylate,<br>
HFPO-C(0)N(H)CH2CH20C(0)C(CH3)=CH2l(FC-l)<br>
HFPO-C(0)N(H)CH2CH2OC(0)C(CH3)=CH2 (HFPO-AEMA) (FC-2) is made by a procedure similar to that described in U.S. Publication No. 2004-0077775, entitled "Fluorochemical Composition Comprising a Fluorinated Polymer and Treatment of a Fibrous Substrate Therewith," filed on May 24, 2002, for Synthesis of (HFPO)k-methacrylate, substituting<br>
F(CF(CF3)CF20)aCF(CF3)C(0)NHCH2CH2OH with a=6.8, molecular weight 1344, for the F(CF(CF3)CF20)aCF(CF3)C(0)NHCH2CH2OH with a=10.5.<br>
2.	Preparation of LTMDA (FC-2)<br>
LTMDA was prepared essentially in the same manner as described in example 15 of U.S. Patent No. 3,810,874, except that instead of making a dimethacrylate from the diol, a diacrylate was made.<br>
Preparation of the Coating Composition.<br>
Substrates were coated with polymerizable compositions using materials and amounts by weight as reported in the following examples (100% solids unless specified). The commercially available hardcoat compositions listed in Table 2 were used in the coating compositions as described below.<br><br><br>
Contact Angle Test<br>
The coatings were rinsed for 1 minute by hand agitation in IPA before being subjected to measurement of water and hexadecane contact angles. Measurements were made using as-received reagent-grade hexadecane (Aldrich) and deionized water filtered through a filtration system obtained from Millipore Corporation (Billerica, MA), on a video contact angle analyzer available as product number VCA-2500XE from AST Products (Billerica, MA). Reported values are the averages of measurements on at least three drops measured on the right and the left<br><br>
sides of the drops, and are shown in Table 2. Drop volumes were lyiL for receding contact angle.<br>
Marker Resistance Test<br>
The tip of a SANFORD (R) KING SIZE permanent black marker was cut with a razor blade at an angle to allow for a wide marking width. Using a ruler, a straight line was drawn on the test sample using the marking at a speed of approximately 6 inches per second. The marked sample was then placed next to a 1-5 rating standard with 1 being the lightest and 5 being the darkest. The process was repeated three times and the average of the three tests was taken.<br>
Example 1 O.lg of FC-1, 9.9 g of HC-1, and O.lg of DAROCUR 1173 photoinitiator were added to a vial and shaken for 5 minutes before coating. A piece of vinyl substrate (4" x 6") was coated with the above acrylate mixture using a Meyer Bar (#10) to give a 1 mil thickness. The acrylate mixture was then polymerized using a PRC UV processor (Model #84-502) at a line speed of 13 ft/min. The coating layer cured to provide a shiny, smooth hardcoat on the vinyl substrate. The coated vinyl had a receding C16H34 contact angle at 60 degrees.<br>
Examples 2-13 The coating compositions listed in Table 3 below, containing one of each of the fluorochemical compounds FC-1 and FC-2 in combination with one of each of the hardcoat compositions HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, HC-5 and HC-6, were prepared as follows. 0.025 g of fluorinated polyether acylate (either FC-1 or FC-2), 9.975 g of the hardcoat composition (either HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, HC-5, HC-6), and 0.1 g of DAROCUR 1173 photoinitiator were added to a vial and shaken on a for 5 minutes before coating. Each of the compositions was then hand coated onto a white vinyl substrate (4" x 6") using a rubber glove to give a thin layer of the coating composition, which was then photopolymerized as described above in<br><br>
example 1. Each of the samples of coated substrate were then exposed to a fluorescent light. The samples were then tested with the Marker Resistance test described above, after 1,5, 13 and 27 days exposure to the fluorescent light. The results are summarized in Table 4, below.<br><br><br><br>
The above data indicate that the urethane-acylates HC-5 and HC-6 (E10-E13) did not perform as well on the Marker Resistance Test as the non-urethane-containing acylates HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, and HC-4 (E2-E9). The aliphatic actylates HC-1, HC-2, and HC-3 (E2-E7) generally performed better than the aromatic acylate HC-4 (E8-E9). It was also observed that fluorochemical coatings derived from aliphatic non-urethane hardcoat compositions gave much better performance stabilities to ambient fluorescent light regardless of which fluorochemicals were used, whereas the aromatic non-urethane hardcoat composition performed better with some fluorochemicals than with others.<br>
Examples 14-21 The compositions listed in Table 5 were prepared and coated onto a vinyl substrate using the same procedures described above for examples 2-19, except that<br><br>
a mixture of HC-3 (non-urethane acrylate) and HC-6 (urethane acrylate) were used at the following weight ratios: 100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, 50/50, 25/75, and 0/100. FC-1 was used as the fluorochemical component. The samples were tested with the Marker Resistance test described above, after 1, 8, 13 and 22 days exposure to the fluorescent light. The results are summarized in Table 6, below.<br><br><br><br><br>
The above data show that the stain resistance of the compositions, as measured by the Marker Resistance Test, decreases as more of the urethane-containing acrylate HC-7 is added to the composition. Thus, in topcoat systems involving the copolymerization of an acrylic resin with a fluorinated monomer, such as a fluorinated (meth)acrylate compound, the particular non-fluorochemical (meth)acylates used can have a significant impact on the stain-resistance characteristics of the topcoat composition. The data presented herein show that compositions which contain an aliphatic or aromatic non-urethane-containing acrylate as the non-fluorochemical (meth)acrylate monomer component generally exhibit better stain resistance than compositions containing a urethane (meth)acrylate as the non-fluorochemical component of the composition.<br>
Examples 22-23 The formulations show in Table 8 were prepared and coated onto a vinyl substrate using the procedures described above. About 1 wt-% of photoinitiator was added to each of the formulations.<br><br><br>
Once applied to the substrate and polymerized, the samples were passed under a UV light (H bulb) 1,5, 10, and 15 times and the Black Marker Test was performed in order to test the effect of increasing amounts of light exposure on the stain resistant properties of the coating compositions. Three contact angle measurements were also taken after the final pass under the UV light. The results are shown below in Tables 9 and 10<br><br><br>
The above results show that the stain resistance of the urethane acrylate-containing composition HC-6 (E22) degraded after repeated exposure to UV light, while the stain resistance of the non-urethane acrylate composition HC-1 (E23) remained relatively constant.<br>
Various modifications and alterations to this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
