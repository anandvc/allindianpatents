Food spreads<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel food spread and its production. In particular, it concerns a food spread containing a mixture of at least an edible oil from a natural origin and a monogiyceride for human consumption.<br>
Food spreads such as margarine and butter are commonplace in the kitchen. They are used in the home and in industry for cooking, baking, sandwiches and numerous food products. In recent years, attention has been directed to producing healthier food spreads, in the form of reduced fat alternatives to the existing products.<br>
Margarines contain a water phase and an oil phase, which are emulsified. They arc generally in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion. The taste of margarines and food spreads is due mostly to water soluble flavors, oil soluble flavors and salt included in the water phase. Margarine type compounds contain at-least 80% of fat by weight. The fat content is made up mainly of polysaturated fats. In the production of margarine the polysaturated fats are hydrogenated, however the hydrogenated products contain harmful trans fatty<br>
acids.<br>
Butter, margarine and food spreads contain preservatives and need to be refrigerated. They have no known positive health value and their use is ihercforc generally based on their taste and cooking properties.<br>
The therapeutic properties of oils from natural origins, such as olive oil and avocado oil have been widely documented. Olive oil has been indicated as having a therapeutic effect in stomach ailments (1, la), increasing memory (2), decreasina mortality from heart disease due to increasing blood flow (3) and softening skin (4V Additionally, olive oil is used in relieving ear infection, may reduce the nsk of certain cancers (5, 6), decreases calcium loss from bones and increases mineral absorption (7). In children, olive oil has been linked to stimulating growth and development (8).<br><br>
The properties of olive oil result from its chemical structure. Olive oil is matic up of 75% oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid, approximately 14% poiyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid and about 11% saturated fatty acids. Oleic acid, the main constituent of olive oil is very stable and is therefore less readily acidified to produce carcinogenic free radicals. In contrast, margarine consists of mainly (64%) poiysaturated fatty acids and only 30% monounsaturated fatty acids.<br>
Likewise, the properties of avocado oil are a result of its structure. It is made up of 10% 18:2 (0-6 fatty acid, 70% 18:1 co-9 fatty acid and 20% 18:0 (0-6 fatty acid. As is the case in olive oil, a major component of avocado oil is monounsaturated tauy acid. Avocado oil has a characteristically bitter taste. On distillation of the oii, ihe laste improves, but the nutrition value decreases.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,226,895, U.S. Patent No. 4,284,655 and U. S. Patent No. 5,409,727 disclose food spreads containing an oil in water emulsion. However, in the present invention, water, is not used. Moreover, the food spread of the present invention does not form with the addition of water.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,360,626 discloses an edible food product containing an oii phase thickened with a texturizing agent comprising an aikyl-substituted, non-nirogen containing oil-soluble polymer having a molecular weight of at least 20(){) daltons. The monoglyceride of the present invention is less than 2000 daltons. In addition, a food spread is disclosed containing an aqueous phase and an oil phase. The present invention does not contain an aqueous phase.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,376,398 discloses a fat component useful for preparing a reduced calorie food product, the fat component comprising an edible triglyceride and a polytetramethylene ether glycol esterified with a fatty acid entity. In contrast, the present invention does not contain a polytetramethylene ether glycol.<br>
The background art discloses reduced fat alternatives to margarines and existing food spreads, however, none of these prior art references suggests the production of a food spread containing a mixture of only an edible oil of natural origin, preferabiy with therapeutic properties and a monoglyceride.<br><br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a food spread as is described in the present invention.<br>

DESCRIPTTON OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is of a food spread containing a mixture of at least one edible oil of natural origin and a monoglyceride for human consumption. The oil is preferably one or more of the oils from the group of olive oil, avocado oil, canola oik soybean oil, sunflower oil, nut oils, walnut oik peanut oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oik coconut oik rice bran oil, mustardseed oil, camelina oil, chia oil, flaxseed oil, perilla oik fish oil, palm oil, sesame oil, wheatgerm oil, jojoba oil or com oil and combinations thereof. More preferably an oil such as avocado oil, fish oil, palm oil or olive oil is used and most preferably the oil is olive oil and fish oik The oils used in the present invention are non-hydrogenated.<br>
In an altemative embodiment, the food spread can optionally contain a mixture of at least one synthetic edible oil or edible oil of natural origin and combinations thereof and a monoglyceride.<br>
The monoglycerides used are preferably derivatives of oleic, or palmific acid. The oil is present preferably in an amount of from about 85 to about 98 percent and most preferably of from about 93 to about 96 percent. The monoglyceride is present preferably<br><br>
in an amount of from about 2% to about 15%. more preferably of from about 4 percent to about 7 percent and most preferably in an amount of about 7percent.  The monoglyccnde functions as a solidifying agent. The more monoglyceride used, the greater the degree of solidity of the food spread at room temperature. It is therefore possible to produce a desired degree of solidity, by changing the proportion of monoglyceride.<br>
At room temperature monoglycerides are not soluble in edible oils. The monoglycerides are dissolved in the oil at temperatures of from about 45°C to about 75°C and preferably from about 60°C to about 75°C and more preferably from about 68°C to about 70°C. Smoothing agents can optionally be added to improve the texture of the spread, such as, but not limited to Tween 80 or vitamin E in an amount of about, but not limited to 0.05%. At these temperatures, the monoglycerides dissolve and the olive oil mixture becomes a transparent solution. On cooling to room temperature, the solution is transformed to a food spread.<br>
In the case of oils such as avocado oil where the taste is less distinctive or less appealing, natural fat soluble flavoring can be added.<br>
The commercially available food spreads are mostly manufactured for their taste, rather than for any health benefit. Margarine food spreads are made by hydrogenation of polysaturated acids, which produce compounds that are easily acidified to free radicals resulting in carcinogenic products. Consequently, there is a tremendous need for a healthier food spread alternative, such as is provided in the present invention. The food spread of the present invention is made without hydrogenation of the oil and preferably uses oils that have potential therapeutic properties. In addition the food spread of the present invention is suitable for use by sufferers of lactose intolerance.<br>
No aqueous phase is used in the spread of the present invention. The addition of water was found to prevent the formation of the spread of the present invention.<br>
The spread of the present invention is particularly advantageous, due to the simplicity of the process of manufacture. Optionally, only 3 simple steps are involved, heating, mixing, and cooling. The process does not involve the more expensive procedures of hydrogenation or high pressure. The effective temperature range of from<br><br>
about 45°C to about 75°C , preferably from about 60°C to about 75°C and more preferably from about 68°C to about 70°C is easily achieved. This temperature range is important as at temperatures below, the spread is not produced. It is unexpected that an oil, such as olive oil, which is liquid at room temperature, should become a solid spread with the addition of only a monoglyceride. Due to the simplicity of manufacture and few ingredients of the spread, this process is very economical. The resulting food spread has a shelf life that is dependent on the shelf life of the monoglyceride. The monoglyceride can typically be kept without spoilage for at least about 1 year in the absence of refrigeration.<br>
In addition, the product of the invention not only has a nutritional basis, but preferably also has potential positive therapeutic properties depending on the oil ineredient.<br>
It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description. The invention includes other embodiments and can be practiced or implemented in various ways. Also it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
The present invention may be better understood with reference to the examples and the accompanying description.<br>
Example 1<br>
General Method of Food spread Production<br>
The food spread of the present invention contains a mixture of at least one edible oil of natural origin and a monoglyceride. The non-hydrogenated oil is preferably one or more of the oils from the group of olive oil, avocado oil, canola oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, nut oils, walnut oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, coconut oil, rice bran oil, mustardseed oil, camelina oil, chia oil, flaxseed oil, perilla oil, fish oil, palm oil, sesame oil, wheatgerm oil, jojoba oil or com oil More preferably an oil such as avocado oil, fish oil, palm oil or olive oil is used and most preferably the oil is olive oil<br><br>
and fish oil In an alternative embodiment, the food spread can optionally contain a mixture of at least one synthetic edible oil and;or an edible oil of natural origin and combinations thereof and a monoglyceride.<br>
The monoglycerides used are preferably derivatives of oleic, or palmitic acid. Smoothing agents can optionally be added such as, but not limited to Tween 80 or vitamin E in an amount of about, but not limited to 0,05%.<br>
The synthesis of the food spread optionally involves three main steps, heating the mixture to produce a solution, mixing the components of oil and monoglyceride, and cooling the solution to form the food spread.<br>
According to step 1 of the synthesis of the food spread, the monoglyceride and oil are heated. The oil is present preferably in an amount of from about 85 to about 98 percent and most preferably of from about 93 to about 96 percent. The monoglyceride is present preferably in an amount of from about 2% to about 15%, more preferably of from about 4 percent to about 7 percent and most preferably in an amount of about 7percent, A smoothing agent is optionally present m an amount of about 0.05%.<br>
At room temperature monoglycerides are generally not soluble in the oil. The monoglycerides are preferably dissolved in the oil at temperatures of from 45°C to about 75°C and preferably from about 60°C to about 75°C and more preferably from about 68°C to about 70°C. At these temperatures, the monoglycerides dissolve and the olive oil mixture becomes a transparent solution.<br>
According to step 2 of the synthesis of the food spread, the monoglyceride, smoothing agent and oil are mixed.<br>
In step 3 of the synthesis of the food spread, the solution is preferably cooled to room temperature. On cooling, the solution is transformed to a food spread.<br>
Optionally, additives, such as fat soluble flavorings can be added to produce a food spread with a distinctive taste. This is preferable when the oil, such as avocado oil does not have an attractive taste.<br><br>
