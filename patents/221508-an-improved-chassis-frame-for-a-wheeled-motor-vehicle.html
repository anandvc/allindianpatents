ORIGINAL<br>
1019/MUM/2004<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved chassis frame for a wheeled motor vehicle an improved version in the chassis system for the vehicle to vary its dimension i.e. length of the vehicles in order to increase the load capacity with respect to the volume of the load and decreased vise versa. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to occupy more volume of load when needed and to contract the size of the vehicle when not needed and help the traffic to run safely The prior art invention do not teach about the feature of the present invention.<br>
US 5498119: The innovation is about the telescopic conveyor which is fixed on the chassis of the vehicle and there is no telescopic movement of chassis further the conveyor boom is telescopic whereas the chassis is not movable the relative movement is along the boom portion and can be detachable from the chassis is only the base. The turret deck is not the integral part of the chassis but an attachment to the chassis. The portion is similar to the crane and no alteration of the chassis is possible. The purpose and application of this invention is to assess to a distant part from chassis with the turret deck, whereas in present inventions to accommodate more volume of load when required and reduce the size of chassis when not required. The chassis is adjustable as per load requirement. In the present invention the moving chassis/sliding chassis is the integral part of the vehicle chassis and not add on part. The above stated US5498119 is a belt conveyor system with hydraulic jack whereas in present invention it is a sliding platform moving in only one direction to and fro only.<br><br>
US4449724: The main difference between present invention and prior art is the telescopic tanker for carrying fluid in this invention the entire tanker is collapsible along with the wheels and is relative to the first fixed chassis whereas in present invention a sliding base platform moving within the fix point and wheels are stable and non extendable. The tanker claimed in claim-2 of the prior art are pivotally attached to a first member when extents along with the wheels, whereas the present invention the sliding chassis slides over the fixed chassis to have limited movement. Also the prior art invention has hydraulic cylinders to lift the chassis and then pivotal attachment and extend, whereas in present invention motor or handle to have the telescopic movement along with the same plane of chassis with the help of power screw, nut &amp; gear train, there are link provided for stability. Guide wheels are used to support the tanker for movement in prior art whereas the present invention is provided for the smooth movement of the sliding chassis over the fixed chassis. The prior art invention is basically the arrangement for chassis for carrying liquid or gas whereas the present invention is for carting bulk load<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a chassis system to occupy more volume of load when needed and to contract the size of the vehicle when not needed and help the traffic to run safely.<br>
Another object of the improved version of the chassis which are capable of altering the size i.e. length of the vehicle required by expanding and contracting and very useful on the overcrowded roads.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved chassis frame for a wheeled motor vehicle an improved version in the chassis system for the vehicle to vary its dimension, i.e. length of the vehicles in order to increase the load capacity with respect to the volume of the load and decreased vise versa. The present invention comprises fixed chassis and moving/sliding chassis the sliding chassis slide over the fix chassis giving the desired effect. The DC motor or handle can be used to rotate the main power screw either clockwise or anticlockwise direction resulting the sliding chassis to slide in or out over fixed chassis. There are limit switch provided on the fix chassis to prevent excessive stretch of the moving chassis and as soon as the limit switch come in operation when the sliding chassis moves in there is also limit switch provided to avoid the sliding chassis coming more in and maintaining the safe distance. Also the Sesser arrangement is provided to reinforce the mechanism and stabilized the sliding chassis the wheels and tracks are provided on the sliding chassis and the fixed chassis respectly so avoid the friction and smooth operation.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An improved chassis frame for a wheeled motor vehicle comprises fixed chassis(1) provided with channels an elongated sliding chassis(2) of a varying length substantially to increase or decrease the size of the vehicle, said section contains central portion comprised of at least one lower longitudinally extending element of a box like cross section stopper plate(11,14) to impart rigidity to the sliding chassis, electric motor(5)<br><br><br>
mounted on the fixed chassis meshed to gear(4) which include power screw(6) rotates as the motor start, the said power screws are screwed through the sliding chassis(2) by means of nut in order to get to and fro motion when the motor rotates clockwise and anticlockwise. The power screw connected to sliding chassis by means of nut welded to body of slidable chassis provided with stopper plate (11) rigidly fixed to the fixed chassis that is last limit for movement of sliding chassis. Track (7) and wheel (8) arrangement made in the channel to facilitate smooth movement of slidable chassis. The length of the sliding chassis is such that rear road wheel are at centre when the sliding chassis fully extended.<br>
The limit switches provided on fixed chassis to stop the motor after the<br>
desired position reached by the movable platform.<br>
The reinforcing links are provided between the stopper plate and moving<br>
platform to prevent excessive stretch of the chassis and provide stability to<br>
» the system during vehicle running.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Fig 1A is an arrangement for telescopic chassis<br>
Fig 2B is a track fitted on the fixed chassis.<br>
Fig 2C is a stopper plate for preventing excessive stretching of the chassis.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to Fig. (1) The improved chassis frame for a wheeled motor vehicle comprises fixed chassis (1) to which wheel (3) is fitted. There is an electric DC motor (5) meshed to the gear (4), which has the power screw (6) which will rotate as the motor starts. The power screw are screwed through<br><br>
the moving chassis (2) by means of the nut in order to get the "to and fro" motion when the motor rotates clockwise and anticlockwise respectly.There are limit switch (15) and (16) provided on the channel chassis to restrict the excess travel of the moving chassis and also to maintain the minimum distance while contracting of the moving chassis. There is a stopper plate (11) rigidly fixed to the fixed chassis (1) and motor mounting (13) on which the motor is mounted. The chassis or the sliding chassis (2) has the set rotating wheel-Fig 2-B.The wheels are fixed at the regular interval on both the sides in order to reduce the friction and for the easy operation under the loaded condition, there is track (7) fitted on the fixed chassis as shown in the Fig2B in order to ensure the direction of the moving chassis and to reduce the wear and tear of the sliding parts. Both the fixed chassis (1) and the moving or sliding chassis (2) are reinforced (10) (9) in order to carry the desired load.<br>
For the additional safety the fixed chassis and moving or sliding chassis are guided each other the sessior mechanism(14) in order to prevent the excessive stretching of the chassis during the operation and to provided stability to the structure during the vehicle in motion Referred in Fig -2C . Referring to the figures the chassis shown in the drawing bears the rear part of the vehicle and all the attachments of the chassis including engine and gear box and differential to be fixed on the fixed chassis. An improved chassis frame for a wheeled motor vehicle can be replaced by handle crank for manual operation.<br><br>
