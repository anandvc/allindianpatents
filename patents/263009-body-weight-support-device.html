The crotch joint parts 21 (21L, 21R) are positioned outside crotch joints of the user P, respectively, and are nodes for rotatably connecting the waist belt part 11 and the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R) around the Y-axis,<br>
The crotch joint parts 21 (21L, 21R) comprise the crotch joint part actuators 21a (left crotch joint part actuator 21aL, right crotch joint part actuator 2laR) and crotch joint part encoders 21b (left crotch joint part encoder 21bL, right crotch joint part encoder 21bR), respectively.<br>
The crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aR) comprise electric motors and reducers, respectively, bases of the actuators 21a (21aL, 2laR) are fixed to left/right parts of the actuator attachment part 13, and output shafts of the actuators 21a (21aL, 21aR) are fixed to upper ends of the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R). The output shafts of the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aR) rotate around the Y-axis, and thereby the npper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R.) rotate around the Y-axis, respectively, making the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21 aL, 21aR) axes for the waist belt part 11. Accordingly, the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aR) can generate torques between the waist belt part 11 and the tipper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R). In a state of the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aR) not generating the torques, the crotch joint parts 21 (21L, 21R) become very small in rotation resistance thereof, result in becoming a rotation-free state, arid thus do not cause a trouble in Swinging forward a leg of the user P. Meanwhile, an attachment relationship of the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aR) is not limited to the above one,<br>
The crotch joint part encoders (rotary encoders) 21b (21bL, 21bR) are one example of the "leg link part behavior detection mechanism" in the 'DISCLOSURE OP THE INVENTION,' and as data concerning a behavior of the leg link parts 20 (20L, 20R), detect a rotation angle of the crotch joint part actuators 2la (21aL, 21aR). The rotation angle detected is output to a control unit 50.<br>
The upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R) are links extending along outside of upper thighs of the user P. Upper ends of the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R)<br>
are connected to the crotch joint parts 21 (21L, 21K), respectively. In addition, lower ends of the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R) are connected to the knee joint parts 23 (23L, 23R), respectively.<br>
The knee joint parts 23 (23L, 23R) are positioned outside knee joints of the user P and are nodes for rotatably connecting the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R) and the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) around the Y-axis. The knee joint parts 23 (23L, 23R) comprise the kaee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) and knee joint part encoders 23b (left knee joint part encoder 23bL, right knee joint part encoder 23bR),<br>
The knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) comprise electric motors and reducers, respectively, bases of the actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) are fixed to lower ends of the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R), and output shafts of the actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) are feed to upper ends of the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R). The output shafts of the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) rotate around the Y-axis, and thereby the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) rotate around the Y-axis, making the knee joint parts 23 (23aL, 23aR) axes for the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R). Accordingly, the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) can generate torques between the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R) and the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R), In a state of the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) not generating the torques, the knee joint parts 23 (23aL, 23aR) become very small in rotation resistance thereof, result in becoming a rotation-free state, and thus do not cause a trouble in swinging forward a leg of the loser P. Meanwhile, the attachment relationship of the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) is not limited to the above one.<br>
The knee joint part encoders (rotary encoders) 23b (23bL, 23bR) are one example   of  the   "knee   link   part   behavior   detection   mechanism"   in   the<br>
"DISCLOSURE OF TEE INVENTION," and as data concerning the behavior of the leg link parts 20 (20L, 20K), detect a rotation angle of the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) The rotation angle detected is output to the control unit 50.<br>
The lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) are links extending along outside of lower thighs of the user P. Upper ends of the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) are connected to the knee joint parts 23 (23L, 23R), respectively. In addition, lower ends of the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) are connected to the ankle joint parts 25 (25L, 26R), respectively.<br>
The ankle joint parts 25 (25L, 25R) are nodes for rotatably connecting the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) and the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30 R) around the Y-axis. The ankle joint parts 25 (25L, 25R) move, following an operation of ankle joints of the user P, so as not to interrupt her or his walking motion.<br>
[Foot Attachment Parts]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 to 4, the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30 R) are parts attached to feet of the user P. As shown in FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C, each of the foot attachment parts 30 comprises a shoe 31, a reinforcement plate 32, and a support member 33. Meanwhile, in FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C the right foot attachment part 30R is depicted.<br>
Meanwhile, the foot attachment parts 30 are one example of the "floor contact part" in the "DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION."<br>
The shoe 31 is a shoe contactably attached to a foot of the user P.<br>
The reinforcement plate 32 is a resin member provided along outside of the foot of the user P, and is designed to be a structure of being able to transmit a floor reaction force received by the shoe 31 to the leg link part 20.<br>
The support member 33 is a resin member for supporting the ankle joint<br>
part  25  in collaboration  with  the  reinforcement plate  32.   Meanwhile, the reinforcement plate 32 and the support member 33 may also be made of metal.<br>
In the embodiment the leg link parts 20 and the foot attachment parts 30 have structures of being able to support part of the weight of the user P transmitted through the body attachment part 10.<br>
In addition, at bottom of the shoe 31 is provided one of floor contact sensors 31a (left floor contact sensor 31aL, right floor contact sensor 31aR). The floor contact sensors 3la (31aL, 3laR) output an ON signal to the control unit 50 (see FIG. 7) during a floor contact.<br>
The floor contact sensors 31a (31aL, 3laR) detect whether or not the foot attachment parts 30 has contacted the floor, and in the embodiment, are provided at foot bottoms of the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R). The floor contact sensors 31a (31aL, 31aR) are one example of the "floor contact detection mechanism" in the "DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION."<br>
la addition, the "floor" is not limits to a floor of a building and may be a face such as a ground surface which the foot attachment parts 30 contact when the user P with the body weight support device 1A moves (walks).<br>
As the floor contact sensors 31a (31aL, 31aR), a sensor using a conductive rubber switch, a piezoelectric element, and a strain gauge is suitable. Although in the embodiment the floor contact sensors 3 la (31aL} 31aR) for a one-axis detection are used, they may also use a floor contact sensor that can detect more than one axis. In addition, although in the embodiment the floor contact sensors 31 a (31aL, 31aR) are provided at center portions of bottoms of the shoes 31, respectively, they may also be provided at heel portions, respectively. In addition, a plurality of floor contact sensors 31a may be provided at one of the shoes 31.<br>
Although in the embodiment the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22K) and<br>
the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R) are assumed to be aluminum members, they may also be formed of another material such as carbon that is lightweight and has a sufficient strength. In other words, the body attachment part 10, the leg link parts 20 (20L, 20K), and the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R) may have a strength that can give a body weight support force to the user P by either left or right ones of the leg link parts 20 and the foot attachment parts 30, and a material thereof is appropriately selectable.<br>
The backpack 40 is something which the user P shoulders and comprises the control unit 50 (see FIG. 7), an input/output interface 60 (see FIG. 7), and a battery (not shown). The control unit 50 will be described later in detail<br>
The input/output interface 60 connects an external computer and the like to the control unit 50. For example, personal data such as the weight of the user P is given to the control unit 50 from the external computer.<br>
The battery supplies electric power to the load sensors 71a (71aL, 71aR), the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aE)., the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR), the crotch joint part encoders 21b (21bL, 21bR), the knee joint part encoders 23b (23bL, 23bR), the floor contact sensors 3la (3laL, ElaR), and the control unit 50. The power supply by the battery is controlled by the control unit 50.<br>
Meanwhile, the backpack 40 and the input/output interface 60 are not indispensable configuration requirements of the present invention. In other words, the attached mode of the control unit 50, the input/output interface 60, and the battery is not limited to one by the backpack 40, and such a mode of directly fitting them to the body attachment part 10 is also available.<br>
Subsequently, the control unit 50 will be described. FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing a function of the body weight support device 1A related to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the control -unit 50 comprises a weight memory unit 51, a target assist force calculation unit 52, an initial torque value calculation unit 53, a comparison unit 54, an actuator state detection unit 55, a floor contact foot determination unit 56, and an output instruction unit 57.<br>
The weight memory unit 51 obtains the weight (weight data) of the user P and memorizes (temporary memory) it. The weight may be input to the control unit 50 directly by the user P or the weight which the control unit 50 recognizing the user P has memorized in advance may be read from the weight memory unit 51. In addition, the weight may also be designed to be input to the weight memory unit 51 through the input/output interface 60 from the external computer. In addition, the weight memory unit 51 may also he designed to memorize only a value of the weight of the user P as the weight.<br>
The target assist force calculation unit 52 reads the weight data memorized in the weight memoiy unit 51, and calculates a target body weight support force based on the weight data.<br>
The "target body weight support force" is a target value of a force (a Z-axis positive direction on a horizontal floor in a standup state) given to the user P by the body weight support device 1A, and a predetermined ratio (for example, 30 % of the weight) of the weight of the user P is set. In the embodiment, together with a target body weight support force Pa, are calculated a minimum body weight support force Fal and a maximum body weight support force Fa2. Here, the minimum body weight support force Fal corresponds to the "lower limit value of the target body weight support force" and the maximum body weight support force Fa2 corresponds to the "upper limit value of the target body weight support force" in the "DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION."<br>
For example, in a case of setting a support force of 30 %-of the weight as the<br>
target body weight support force Fa, a value of 28% of the weight is calculated as the minimum body weight support force Fal; a value of 32% of the weight is calculated as the maximum body weight support force Fa2. These assist forces Fa, Fal, and Fa2 are appropriately set according to a body weight support force wanted to be given, to the user P, a calculation capacity, a characteristic of each of the actuators 21a and 23a, a characteristic of each of the sensors lla and 31a, and the like.<br>
A ratio setting of the target body weight support force Fa, the minimum body weight support force Fal, and the maximum body weight support force Fa2 is appropriately changeable, and for example, it is enabled to set an arbitrary value from the external computer through the input/output interface 60.<br>
The initial torque value calculation unit 53 calculates initial torque values to be given to the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL, the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR, the left knee joint part actuator 23aL, and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR, based on the target body weight support force Fa.<br>
The initial torque values are calculated for each of three cases: (1) both-feet floor contact; (2) left-foot floor contact (right foot not in contact with the floor); and (3) right-foot floor contact (left foot not in contact with the floor).<br>
In other words, (1) in the case of the both-feet floor contact are calculated initial torque values given to the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL, the right crotch joint part actuator 21aE, the left knee joint part actuator 23aL, and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR; (2) in the case of the left-foot floor contact are calculated initial torque values given to the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL and the left knee joint part actuator 23aL, and then those given to tihe right crotch joint part actuator 21aR and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR are zero; and (3) in the case of the right-foot floor contact are calculated initial torque values given to the<br>
right crotch joint part actuator 21aR and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR, and then those given to the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL and the left knee joint part actuator 23aL are zero.<br>
These initial torque values are ones for improving an initial response of the body weight support device 1A, and it is preferable to make the values that enable the device LA to transit to a state of bringing out the target body weight support force Fa smoothly and early from an initial state. By generating torques in each actuator of the initial state according to its initial torque value, even if the user P abruptly leaves her or Ms weight to the body weight support device 1A, it surely prevents the user P from falling down or losing her or his balance and thus can stably establish her or bis standup state. Here, as the initial state can be cited an activation of the body weight support device 1A and a change (both-feet floor contact to one-foot floor contact and vice versa) of a floor contact state thereof,<br>
In addition, giving the initial torque values also contribute to a prevention of a trouble of the body weight support device 1A<br>
Meanwhile, because torque values to be output by the actuators 2 la and 23a change according to the assist forces Fa, Pal, and Fa2 and rotation angles of the actuators 21a and 23a, the initial torque value may be designed to be set with also using a current rotation angle of each of the actuators 21a and 23a.<br>
The comparison unit 54 compares a body weight support force Fb (herein after simply referred to as load Fb" if necessary) at present time, based on a detection load of the load sensors 71a (7laL, 71aR) with a calculation result of the target assist force calculation unit 52. The comparison unit 54 memorizes a relationship between an actual detection value by the load sensors 71a (71aL, 71aR) and a body weight support force by the leg link parts 20 in the actual detection value. Accordingly, the comparison unit 54 can obtain the body weight<br>
support force Fb actually acting, based on a detection result of the load sensors 71a<br>
(71aL, 71aR).<br>
As  a comparison result, there are three results: (11) Fb<fal></fal>
FalsFb<fa2 and fb>Fa2. The comparison result is output to the output<br>
instruction unit 57.<br>
Based on output from the left crotch joint part encoder 21bL, the right crotch joint part encoder 21bR, the left knee joint part encoder 23bL, and the right knee joint part encoder 23bR, the actuator state detection unit 55 detects a state of each of these joint parts. The detection result is output to the output instruction unit 57.<br>
The floor contact foot determination unit 56 determines in which state of (1) both-feet floor contact, (2) left-foot floor contact, or (3) right-foot floor contact a floor contact foot is,<br>
In other words, the floor contact foot determination, unit 56 determines that: a case of there being output from both of the left floor contact sensor 31aL and the right floor contact sensor 31aR is (1) a state of both-feet floor contact; a case of there being output only from the left floor contact sensor 31aL is (2) a state of left-foot floor contact (right foot not in contact with the floor); and a case of there being output only from the right floor contact sensor 31aE is (1) a state of right-foot floor contact (left foot not in contact with the floor). The determination result is output to the output instruction unit 57.<br>
The output instruction unit 57 decides and instructs output of each of the actuators 21aL, 21aR, 23aL, and 23aR, based on the calculation result of the initial torque value calculation unit 53, the comparison result of the comparison unit 54, the detection result of the actuator state detection unit 55, and the determination result of the floor contact foot determination unit 56.<br>
The output instruction unit 57 expects a behavior of the leg link parts 20 (20L, 20R), based on the detection results of the actuator state detection unit 55 and these variation amounts, and decides the output of each of the actuators 21aL, 21aR, 23aL, and 23aR, based on the expectation result<br>
For example, in FIG. 13A described later, when an angle θ1R becomes large enough and nears a predetermined value (for example, set in an angle at timing when the right foot is separated from the floor last time), it is expected that the right foot will soon separate from the floor. In other words, the control unit 50 obtains and memorizes an angle θ1 (floor separation angle: corresponding to a rotation angle of the crotch joint part actuators 21a) at tuning when a foot is separated from the floor. Then the control unit 50 expects the behavior of a leg of the user P, using the floor separation angle θ 1.<br>
Thus by moving the ratio of the body weight support force Fb to the left leg link part 20L, the right foot becomes in the air and can prepare (smooth transfer of a torque output fluctuation of the actuators) a state of having to support bis weight only by a left system (the body attachment part 10, the left leg link part 20L, and the left foot attachment part 30L), and realize a more stable body weight support.<br>
[Torque Generation Direction]<br>
Subsequently, a torque generation direction of the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 21aK) and the knee joint part actuators 23a (23aL, 23aR) will be described. FIGS. 8A and 8B are drawings illustrating a torque generation direction by a crotch joint part actuator and a knee joint part actuator; FIG. 8A is a schematic drawing showing a state of a torque being: sufficiently generated; and FIG. 8B is a schematic drawing showing a state of torque being insufficient and a user becoming such a state of losing her or his balance. Meanwhile, .in drawings below,<br>
"ON" in the drawings indicates the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R) are in contact with the floor, "OFF" indicates the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R) are not in contact with the floor.<br>
In FIGS. 8A and 8B a line L1 is a horizontal line along the waist belt part 11; lines 2 are lines extending in a longitudinal direction of the upper thigh link parts 22 (22L, 22R); angles θ1 (θ 1L, θ 1R) are ones made by the line L1 and the<br>
*<br>
upper thigh link parts 22; and angles θ 2 (θ 2L, θ 2R) are ones made by the lines L2 and the lower thigh link parts 24 (24L, 24R)<br>
As showa in FIG. 8A, in a case of the body weight support device 1A bringing out a sufficient body weight support force, the user P can keep a standup state even if she or he does not support the whole weight by her or his own legs.<br>
But as shown in FIG. 8B, in a case of a leg force of the user P is insufficient and the body weight support device 1A not bringing out the sufficient body weight support force, the device 1A change a posture of the user P so that the angles θ  1 (θ 1L, θ IE) become smaller and the angles θ 2 (θ 2L, θ 2R) become larger.<br>
In other words, in order to bring out the sufficient body weight support force, the body weight support device 1A may respectively generate torques in such a direction that the crotch joint part actuators 21a (21aL, 2laR) make the angles θ 1 (θ 1L, θ 1E) larger, and in such a direction that the knee joint part actuators 23a(23aL,23aR) make the angles θ 2(θ 2L, θ 2R) smaller.<br>
Meanwhile, each of the actuators 21a and 23a are controlled so that a movable range of each of the joint parts 21 and 23 does not exceed at least that of joint parts of an ordinary human being. Therefore, safety is further unproved, In addition, the upper thigh link parts 22, the knee joint parts 23 (knee joint part actuators 23a), and the lower thigh link parts 24 are adjusted in length thereof so that the upper thigh link parts 22 and the lower thigh link parts 24 do not become<br>
in line foot folly elongated) and so that the knee joint parts 23 always become a bent state (avoidance of a singular point, see FIGS. 3 and 4). In. other words, the body weight support device 1A is designed to be a structure of surely preventing the upper thigh link parts 22 and the lower thigh link parts 24 from becoming in line and bending to a reverse side. Thus an impact to the attachment parts (body attachment part 10, foot attachment parts 30) is alleviated and a controllability of a weight relief amount by the actuators 21a and 23a is improved. Meanwhile, in order to surely restrict the movable range of the actuators 21a and 23a, a mechanical stopper may be provided at each of the actuators 21 and 23 and each of the link parts 22 and 24.<br>
[Relationsbip Between Generation Torque and Body Weight Support Force]<br>
Subsequently, a relationship between a generation torque and a body weight support force will be described.<br>
FIGS. 9 and 10 are drawings illustrating a relationship between a generation torque and a body weight rapport force; FIG. 9 is a drawing illustrating a relationship between a generation torque of a knee joint part actuator and a body weight support force; and FIG. 10 is a drawing illustratuig a relationship between a generation torque of a crotch joint part actuator and a body weight support force.<br>
Firstly, referring to FIG. 9, a relationship between a generation torque of the right knee joint part actuator 23aR and a body weight support force will be described. Here, it is assumed that the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR is<br>
unrotatably fixed<br>
If the right foot attachment part 30R contacts a floor and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR generates a torque in a direction of lessening the angle θ 2R, a rotation force is given to the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR in a<br>
tangential direction of a circle making the actuator 23aR a center. An anti-gravity direction (Z-axis direction) component of the rotation force is a body weight support force FalR by the right knee joint part actuator 23aR.<br>
Subsequently, referring to FIG. 10, a relationship between a generation torque of the right crotch, joint part actuator 21aR and a body weight support force will be described. Here, it is assumed that the right Knee joint part actuator 23aR is unrotatably fixed<br>
If the right foot attachment part 30R contacts the floor and the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR generates a torque in a direction of enlarging the angle θ 1R, a rotation force is given to the body attachment part 10 in a tangential direction of a circle making the actuator 21aR a center. The anti-gravity direction (Z-axis direction) component of the rotation force is a body weight support force Fa2R by the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR,<br>
Meanwhile, although not shown, a body weight support force FalL by the left knee joint part actuator 23aL and a body weight support force Fa2L by the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL are generated appropriately, a target body weight support force (total assist force) Fa by the body weight support device 1A is expressed by following equations:<br>
(1) both-feet floor contact<br>
(2)	left-foot floor contact<br>
Fa= FalL+Fa2L; and<br>
(3)	right-foot floor contact<br>
[Load of Foot Attachment Parts]<br><br>
Subsequently, a load on the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R) will he described. FIG. 11 is a graph showing a result of measuring a pressure loaded on the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R) in walking, A transition of the pressure in walking and an effect of the body weight support device 1A can be explained by FIG. 11. In a state that pressure sensors were attached to two places (heel portion and position of metatarsophalangeal joint of a foot of a leg [MP] joint of a root of thumb of a foot) of bottom sides of the foot attachment parts 30 (30L, 30R) of the body weight support device 1A, the user P put on the device 1A and walked. Output of the pressure sensors is indicated in voltage. While the user P walked, it is turned out that an appearance of the load transiting alternately in the left foot attachment part 30L and the right foot attachment part 30E from a heel to a foot tip thereof. The body weight support device 1A gives the body weight support force Fa to the user P, thereby reduces a maximum load (Fc to Fc") on her or his feet, and facilitates walking. [Operation Example of Body "Weight Support Device]<br>
Subsequently, an operation example of the body weight support device 1A will be described. FIG. 12 is a flowchart showing the operation example of the body weight support device 1A related to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Firstly, in a state of the user P having put on the body weight support device 1A, the weight of the user P is input The weight input is memorized in the weight memory unit 51 (step S1).<br>
Subsequently, the target assist force calculation unit 52 calculates the target body weight support force Fa (Fal, Fa2), based on the weight of the -user P memorized in the weight memory unit 51 (step S2).<br>
Subsequently, the initial torque value calculation unit 53 calculates an initial torque value, based on the target body weight support force Fa (step S3).<br>
Subsequently, the floor contact foot determination unit 56 identifies a floor contact foot, based on the output of floor contact sensors 31a (step S4).<br>
If it is determined that the floor contact foot is only the left foot, the output instruction unit 57 drives the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL and the left knee joint part actuator 23aL so as to generate a torque depending on the initial torque value (step S5a).<br>
If it is determined that the floor contact foot is both feet, the output instruction unit 57 drives the left crotch joint part actuator 21aL, the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR, the left knee joint part actuator 23aL, and the right knee joint part actuator 23aE so as to generate a torque depending on the initial torque value (step S5b).<br>
If it is determined that the floor contact foot is only the right foot, the output instruction unit 57 drives the right crotch joint part actuator 2laR and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR so as to generate a torque depending on the initial torque value (step S5c).<br>
Subsequently, the load sensors 71a detect the load Fb (step S6), and the comparison unit 54 compares the detected load Fb with the calculated target body weight support force Fa (Fal, Fa2) (step S7). Meanwhile, a detection value itself by the load sensors 71a may be simply compared to a threshold value of the detection value converted based on the calculated target body weight support force Fa.<br>
If the load Fb is less than Fal, the output instruction unit 57 increases a current amount to the actuators of a floor contact foot by a predetermined amount, and thus increases a generation torque by a predetermined amount (step 8a).<br>
If the load Fb is not less than Fal and not more than Fa2, the output instruction unit 57 keeps the torque of the actuators of the floor contact foot (step 8b).<br>
If the load Fb exceeds Fa2, the output instruction unit 57 decreases the current amount of the floor contact foot hy a predetermined amount, and thus decreases a generation torque by a predetermined amount (step 8c).<br>
Meanwhile, the predetermined amount for the increase/decrease of the current is appropriately set according to a calculation capacity of the control unit 50, a characteristic of each of the actuators 21a and 23a, and that of each of the sensors 71a and 31a.<br>
Subsequently, if an OFF signal is input to the control unit 50 (Yes in step S9), the body weight support device IA ends the processing. If the OFF signal is not inpat to the control unit 50 (No in the step S9), the floor contact foot determination unit 56 determines whether or not there exists a change of the floor contact foot (step S10).<br>
If it is determined that there exists the change of the floor contact foot (both-feet floor contact to one-foot floor contact and vice versa) (Yes in the step S10), transit to the step S4 In addition, if it is determined that there does not exist the change of the floor contact foot (No in the step S10), transit to the step S6.<br>
[State Transition and Torque Generation of Leg Link Parts]<br>
Subsequently, a state transition of the body weight support device 1A accompanied with the user P walking will be described, particailarly taking notice of a state transition of the right leg part 20R. FIGS. 13 A to 13D and 14A to 14C are drawings illustrating a state transition of the angle θ 1R and angle θ 2R of the right leg link part R in the user P walking.<br>
Meanwhile, a walking mode is different in every user P and a knee angle in walking is also different in her or him One example thereof is shown in FIGS. 13A tol3Dandl4Atol4C.<br>
When the right leg of the user P is positioned at a most rear position (FIG. 13A, a state 1), the right upper thigh link part 22R,and the right lower thigh link part 24R become almost in line. At this time the angle θ 1R becomes masimuia (θ1R=θ 1Rmax), and the angle θ 2R becomes minimum (θ 2R= θ 92Rmin). Here, because the right foot attachment part 30R contacts the floor, the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR generates a torque in a direction of enlarging the angle 91R, and the right knee joint part actuator 22aR generates a torque in a direction of lessening the angle θ 2R.<br>
If the user P swings forward (in the X-axis positive direction) her or his right leg, the right leg (right foot attachment part 30) is separated from the floor. Here, the generation torque of the right crotch joint part actuator 21aB and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR becomes "zero." After the separation of the right leg, because the angle θ 1R gradually becomes smaller and the right foot attachment part 30R follows the knee joint part 23R with delaying for it, the angle θ 2R becomes larger for some tune, and in a state of the angle θ 2R having become maximum (θ 2R= θ 2Rmax),, the part 23R continues on being swung forward (FIG. 13B, a state 2).<br>
If the user P continues on swinging forward the right leg from the state 2, the angle θ 1R becomes minimum (θ 1H= θ1Rmin) (FIG, 13C, a state 3), Thereafter, because although the angle θ 1R gradually becomes larger, the foot attachment part 30R comes forward with delaying for the knee joint part 23R, the angle θ 2R gradually becomes smaller, and the foot attachment part 30R contacts the floor (FIG. 13D, a state 4). Thereafter, while the left leg performs the above described operation similar to the right leg (FIG. 14A, a state 5; FIG. 14B, a state 6; and FIG. 14C, a state 7 (= the state 1)), that is, when the right leg contacts the floor, the right crotch joint part actuator 21aR generates a torque in a direction of always enlarging<br>
the angle θ 1R, and the right knee joint part actuator 23aR generates a torque in a direction of always lessening the angle θ 2R.<br>
Meanwhile, it is also available to design in a leg being in the air so that each of the crotch joint part actuators 21a generates a torque in a counterclockwise direction in FIGS. 13A to 13D, and thus gives the assist force Fa (Fal, Fa2) to the upper thigh of the user P for the swinging-forward operation.<br>
In accordance with the body weight support device 1A following effects can be obtained.<br>
(1)	Because the body weight support device 1A supports part of the weight of the<br>
user P, it can reduce a load on her or his legs accompanying her or Ms weight<br>
support.<br>
(2)	Because the body weight support device 1A detects a load on herself or himself<br>
and supports a definite ratio of her or his weight, based on the load, it can perform a<br>
support corresponding to her or his posture change and the like.<br>
(3)	Because the body weight support device 1A gives a body weight support force<br>
only to a floor contact foot, it can give a suitable body weight support force<br>
accompanied with the change of a walking posture and dose not interrupt the<br>
operation of a leg not in contact with the floor.<br><br>
(4)	Because different from a stick (crutches, a four-point support stick, and, the like)<br>
the body weight support device LA does not need an operation by the hands of the<br>
user P, she or he can use the hands even during a walking assist. In addition, there<br>
is no possibility of her or his arms and upper body becomiag tired, accompanied<br>
with, a long time use thereof.<br>
(5)	Because the body weight support device 1A has a compact configuration along<br>
with the legs of the user P, it does not become an obstacle even in moving a narrow<br>
passage, staircases, and the like- In addition, because a configuration of each of the<br>
actuators 21a and 23a and the link parts 22 and 24 is analogous to a mechanism of a human lower limb, and these are arranged along the limbs (legs) of the -user P, the configuration tends more to synchronize a human walking operation and is better in a transmission efficiency of the body weight support fores than a configuration using a directly moved actuator and an assist device of a configuration of being separated from the lower limbs of the user P.<br>
(6)	Because the body weight support device 1A does not need a wheel, it can be used,<br>
without depending on a floor condition.<br>
(7)	The body weight support device 1A has less constraint regions in the user P, it is<br>
suitable for a long time use. In other words, different from a conventional walking<br>
aid device, because the device 1A related to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention does not need the constraint of such, knees and upper thighs and can<br>
almost do without the constraint of the legs of the user P, she or he does not feel an<br>
uncomfortable constraint and ache. In addition, the body weight support device 1A<br>
does with less constraint regions, it can be lighter weight, various users can use the<br>
body weight support device 1A of one type, and thus the device 1A results in being<br>
very high in versatility.<br>
(8)	In addition, the body weight support device 1A also has a feature that a portion<br>
(attachment portion of the crotch joint part actuators 21a) where the body weight<br>
support force is given to the user P from the device 1A and a portion (upper thigh<br>
portion and groin portion of the body attachment part 10) where she or he leaves<br>
her or his weight are positioned within a substantially same vertical plane (Y-Z<br>
plane in FIGS. 3 and 4. By making such the configuration,, it is prevented to<br>
generate an unnecessary moment in the user P in a pitch direction (around the<br>
Y-axis) when performing a body weight support.<br>
[Variation Example]<br>
Subsequently, concerning variation examples of the body attachment part 10 will be mainly described a difference from the body weight support device 1A. FIGS. 15A, 15B, and 15C are drawings showing the variation examples of the body attachment part 10. Meanwhile., in the BIGS. 15A to 15C each, backpack 40 is omitted.<br>
A body attachment part 110 of a body weight support device 1B shown in FIG. 15A comprises a waist belt part 11, actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, crotch belt parts 112L and 112R. The crotch belt parts 112L and 112R are cloth members put around the crotch of the user P and are connected to the actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, respectively.<br>
The body weight support device 1B is realized to be lightweight by mating the belt of the body attachment part 10 simpler than the body weight support device 1A shown in FIG. 1.<br>
A body attachment part 210 of the body weight support device 1C shown in FIG. 15B comprises the waist belt part 11, the actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, upper thigh belt parts 212L and 212R. The upper thigh belt parts 212L and 212R are cloth members put around the upper thighs of the user P and are connected to the actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, respectively.<br>
The body weight support device 1C is an example of heightening a support function in the upper thighs of the user P more than the body weight support device 1B and instead alleviating a stress in her or his groin portion.<br>
A body attachment part 310 of the body weight support device 1D shown in FIG. 15C comprises the waist belt part 11, the actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, armpit support parts 312L and 312R. The armpit support parts 312L and 312R are members for supporting the armpits of the user P and are connected to the<br>
actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, respectively. The armpit support parts 312L and 312E, the actuator attachment parts 13L and 13R, the leg link parts 20L and 20K, the foot attachment parts 30L and 30R have a structure of being- able to support a load on the armpit support parts 312L and 312R.<br>
The body weight support device 1D is an example suitable for the user P that is difficult to constrain her or bis upper thighs and groin portion due to a disease, an injury, and the like.<br>
Other than these is also available such a device configuration where a body weight support force by a body weight support device is given to a jaw portion of the user P.<br>
Subsequently, concerning a variation example of the control unit 50 will be mainly described a difference from the body weight support device 1A. FIG. 16 is a block diagram showing the variation example of the control unit 50.<br>
A control unit 450 of a body weight support device 1E shown in FIG. 16 comprises a target assist force memory unit 451 instead of the weight memory unit 51 and the target assist force calculation unit 52.<br>
The target assist force memory unit 451 memorizes the target body weight support force Fa (for example, 10 kg) of a predetermined value set in advance. In addition, the target assist force memory unit 451 memorizes the minimum body weight support force Fal (for example, 9 kg) and the maximum body weight support force Fa2 (for example, 11 kg) corresponding to the target body weight support force Fa. In an operation flow of such the body weight support device 1E is calculated an initial torque value using these values, and a torque of an actuator is controlled.<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention is described, referring to the drawings, the invention is not limited thereto and the embodiment is appropriately changeable in design without departing the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
(1)	Although each of the above mentioned body weight support devices is designed<br>
to integrate a joint part and an actuator, they may be designed to be separate bodies<br>
and to transmit a drive force of the actuator to the joint part through a drive force<br>
transmission mechanism comprising a link mechanism, a belt, and the like.<br>
(2)	The body weight support device may also be designed to omit a crotch joint part<br>
actuator and to drive the joint part only by a knee joint part actuator. In this case<br>
are realized the lightweight of the body weight support device and the simplification<br>
of the control.<br>
(3)	Although the body weight support device is designed to arrange each actuator<br>
and each link part along outside of a user's limb, all actuators and link parts or at<br>
least one of them may also be arranged inside the user's lower limb.<br>
(4)	The body weight support device may also be such a configuration that each foot<br>
attachment part is omitted and a lower end of a lower thigh link part contacts a<br>
floor. In this case, while synchronizing the body weight support device with a<br>
walking operation of a user by providing a lower limb attachment part, which is<br>
connected to a leg link part instead of her or his foot constraint by the foot<br>
attachment part and is attached to any of an ankle, a lower thigh, a knee, and a<br>
upper thigh, body weight support   control is enabled by detecting a floor contact<br>
foot with a floor contact sensor provided at any of her or his foot bottom and a lower<br>
end of the lower thigh link part.<br>
(5)	Although in the control flow of FIG. 12 a case is described as an example that the<br>
control unit 50 performs processing according to a program (body weight support<br>
program) stored in advance, the program may also be designed to be provided in the<br>
body weight support device from outside by a recording medium and a network<br>
(6)	Although each of the body weight support devices is provided in both lower limbs<br>
of a user, it may also be a configuration of being provided in either one of the right or left limb- For example, in a case that a function of only one foot of the user- is lowered, a body weight support force can be given by providing the body weight support device only in the lower limb whose function is lowered,<br>
