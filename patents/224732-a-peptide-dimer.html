CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
Priority is claimed to United States provisional application serial nos. 60/469,993 and 60/470,244<br>
both filed on May 12, 2003. The contents of these priority applications are incorporated into the present<br>
disclosure by reference and in their entireties.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to peptide compounds that are agonists of the erythropoietin<br>
receptor (EPO-R). The invention also relates to therapeutic methods using such peptide compounds to<br>
treat disorders associated with insufficient or defective red blood cell production. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, which comprise the peptide compounds of the invention, are also provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone of 165 amino acids, with a molecular weight of<br>
about 34 kilodaltons (kD) and preferred glycosylation sites on amino-acid positions 24, 38, 83, and 126.<br>
It is initially produced as a precursor protein with a signal peptide of 23 amino acids. EPO can occur in<br>
three forms: a, ß, and asialo. The a and ß forms differ slightly in their carbohydrate components, but<br>
have the same potency, biological activity, and molecular weight. The asialo form is an a or ß form with<br>
the terminal carbohydrate (sialic acid) removed. The DNA sequences encoding EPO have been reported<br>
[U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,008 to Lin].<br>
EPO stimulates mitoric division and differentiation of erythrocyte precursor cells, and thus<br>
ensures the production of erythrocytes. It is produced in the kidney when hypoxic conditions prevail.<br>
During EPO-induced differentiation of erythrocyte precursor cells, globin synthesis is induced; heme<br>
complex synthesis is stimulated; and the number of ferritin receptors increases. These changes allow the<br>
cell to take on more iron and synthesize functional hemoglobin, which in mature erythrocytes binds<br>
oxygen. Thus, erythrocytes and their hemoglobin play a key role in supplying the body with oxygen.<br>
These changes are initiated by the interaction of EPO with an appropriate receptor on the cell surface of<br>
the erythrocyte precursor cells [See, e.g., Graber and Krantz (1978) Ann. Rev. Med. 29.51-66].<br>
EPO is present in very low concentrations in plasma when the body is in a healthy state wherein<br>
tissues receive sufficient oxygenation from the existing number of erythrocytes. This normal low<br>
concentration is sufficient to stimulate replacement of red blood cells which are lost normally through<br>
aging.<br>
The amount of EPO in the circulation is increased under conditions of hypoxia when oxygen<br>
transport by blood cells in the circulation is reduced. Hypoxia may be caused, for example, by substantial<br>
blood loss through hemorrhage, destruction of red blood cells by over-exposure to radiation, reduction in<br>
oxygen intake due to high altitude or prolonged unconsciousness, or various forms of anemia. In<br>
response to such hypoxic stress, elevated EPO levels increase red blood cell production by stimulating the<br>
proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells. When the number of red blood cells in circulation is greater<br>
than needed for normal tissue oxygen requirements, EPO levels in circulation are decreased.<br>
Because EPO is essential in the process of red blood cell formation, this hormone has potentially<br>
useful applications in both the diagnosis and the treatment of blood disorders characterized by low or<br>
defective red blood cell production. Recent studies have provided a basis for the projection of EPO<br>
therapy efficacy for a variety of disease states, disorders, and states of hematologic irregularity, including:<br>
beta-thalassemia [see, Vedovato, et al. (1984) Acta. Haematol. 71:211-213]; cystic fibrosis [see,<br>
Vichinsky, et al. (1984) J. Pediatric 105:15-21]; pregnancy and menstrual disorders [see, Cotes, et al.<br>
(193) Brit. J. Ostet. Gyneacol. 90:304-311]; early anemia of prematurity [see, Haga, et al. (1983) Acta<br>
Pediatr. Scand. 72; 827-831]; spinal cord injury [see, Claus-Walker, et al. (1984) Arch. Phys. Med.<br>
Rehabil. 65:370-374]; space flight [see, Dunn, et al. (1984) Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 52:178-182]; acute<br>
blood loss [see, Miller, et al. (1982) Brit. J. Haematol. 52:545-590]; aging [see, Udupa, et al. (1984) J.<br>
Lab. Clin. Med. 103:574-580 and 581-588 and Lipschitz, et al. (1983) Blood 63:502-509]; various<br>
neoplastic disease states accompanied by abnormal erythropoiesis [see, Dainiak, et al. (1983) Cancer<br>
5:1101-1106 and Schwartz, et al. (1983) Otolaryngol. 109:269-272]; and renal insufficiency [see,<br>
Eschbach. etal. (1987) N. Eng. J. Med. 316:73-78].<br>
Purified, homogeneous EPO has been characterized [U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,195 to Hewick]. A<br>
DNA sequence encoding EPO was purified, cloned, and expressed to produce recombinant polypeptides<br>
with thesame biochemical and immunological properties and natural EPO. A recombinant EPO molecule<br>
with oligosaccharides identical to those on natural EPO has also been produced [See, Sasaki, et al. (1987)<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 262:12059-12076].<br>
The biological effect of EPO appears to be mediated, in part, through interaction with a cell<br>
membrane bound receptor. Initial studies, using immature erythroid cells isolated from mouse spleen,<br>
suggested that the EPO-binding cell surface proteins comprise two polypeptides having approximate<br>
molecular weights of 85,000 Daltons and 100,000 Daltons, respectively [Sawyer, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 84:3690-3694]. The number of EPO-binding sites was calculated to average from 800 to<br>
1000 per cell surface. Of these binding sites, approximately 300 bound EPO with a Kd of approximately<br>
90 pM (picomolar), while the remaining bound EPO with a reduced affinity of approximately 570 pM<br>
[Sawyer, et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:5554-5562]. An independent study suggested that EPO-<br>
responsive splenic erythroblasts, prepared from mice injected with the anemic strain (FVA) of the Friend<br>
leukemia virus, possess at total of approximately 400 high and a low affinity EPO binding sites with Kd<br>
values of approximately 100 pM and 800 pM, respectively [Landschulz, et al. (1989) Blood 73:1476-<br>
1486].<br>
Subsequent work indicated that the two forms of EPO receptor (EPO-R) were encoded by a<br>
single gene. This gene has been cloned [See, e.g., Jones, et al. (1990) Blood 76, 31-35; Noguchi, et al.<br>
(1991) Blood 78:2548-2556; Maouche, et al. (1991) Blood 78:2557-2563]. For example, the DNA<br>
sequences and encoded peptide sequences for murine and human EPO-R proteins are described in PCT<br>
Pub. No. WO 90/08822 to D'Andrea, et al. Current models suggest that binding of EPO to EPO-R results<br>
in the dimerization and activation of two EPO-R molecules, which results in subsequent steps of signal<br>
transduction [See, e.g., Watowich, et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2140-2144].<br>
The availability of cloned genes for EPO-R facilitates the search for agonists and antagonists of<br>
this important receptor. The availability of the recombinant receptor protein allows the study of receptor-<br>
ligand interaction in a variety of random and semi-random peptide diversity generation systems. These<br>
systems include the "peptides on plasmids" system [described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,270, 170]; the "peptides<br>
on phage" system [described in U.S. Pat No. 5,432,018 and Cwirla, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 87:6378-6382]; the "encoded synthetic library" (ESL) system [described in U.S. patent application<br>
Ser. No. 946,239, filed Sep. 16, 1992]; and the "very large scale immobilized polymer synthesis" system<br>
[described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; PCT Pub. No. 90/15070; Fodor, et al. (1991) Science 251:767-773;<br>
Dower and Fodor (1991) Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 26:271-180; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,186].<br>
Peptides that interact to a least some exent with EPO-R have been identified and are described,<br>
for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,773,569; 5,830,851; and 5,986,047 to Wrighton, et al.; PCT Pub. No. WO<br>
96/40749 to Wrighton, et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,078 and PCT Pub. No. 96/40772 to Johnson and Zivin;<br>
PCT Pub. No. WO 01/38342 to Balu; and WO 01/91780 to Smith-Swintosky, et al. In particular, a group<br>
of peptides containing a peptide motif has been identified, members of which bind to EPO-R and<br>
stimulate EPO-dependent cell proliferation. Yet, peptides peptides identified to date that contain the<br>
motif stimulate EPO-dependent cell proliferation in vitro with EC50 values of about 20 nanomolar (nM)<br>
to about 250nM. Thus, peptide concentrations of 20nM to 250nM are required to stimulate 50% of the<br>
maximal cell proliferation stimulated by EPO.<br>
Given the immense potential of EPO-R agonists, both for studies of the important biological<br>
activities mediated by this receptor and for treatment of disease, there remains a need for the<br>
identification of peptide EPO-R agonists of enhanced potency and activity. The present invention<br>
provides such compounds.<br>
The citation and/or discussion of cited references in this section and throughout the specification<br>
is provided merely to clarify the description of the present invention and is not an admission that any such<br>
reference is "prior art" to the present invention.<br>

a carbamate linkage or an amide linkage to an activated polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety, where the<br>
PEG has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons (the term "about" indicating that in<br>

covalently attached via a carbamate or an amide linkage to an activated PEG moiety, where PEG has a<br>
molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 50,000 Daltons (the term "about" indicating that in<br>
preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight).<br>
Each PEG moiety may be, individually, 10,000 Daltons (10kD), 20kD, 30kD, 40kD, or 50kD.<br>

Leu or L; Isoleucine is Ile or I; Metbionine is Met or M; Valine is Val or V; Serine is Ser or S; Praline is<br>
Pro or P; Threonine is Thr or T; Alanine is Ala or A; Tyrosine is Tyr or Y; Histidine is His or H;<br>
Glutamine is Gln or Q; Asparagine is Asn or N; Lysine is Lys or K; Aspartic Acid is Asp or D; Glutamic<br>
Acid is Glu or E; Cysteine is Cys or C; Tryptophan is Trp or W; Arginine is Arg or R; and Glycine is Gly<br>

or Np; N-methylglycine (also known as sarcosine) is MeG or Sc; and acetylated glycine (N-acetylglycine)<br>
is AcG.<br>
As used herein, the term "polypeptide" or "protein" refers to a polymer of amino acid monomers<br>
that are alpha amino acids joined together through amide bonds. Polypeptides are therefore at least two<br>
amino acid residues in length, and are usually longer. Generally, the term "peptide" refers to a<br>
polypeptide that is only a few amino acid residues in length. The novel EPO-R agonist peptides of the<br>
present invention are preferably no more than about 50 amino acid residues in length. They are more<br>
preferably of about 17 to about 40 amino acid residues in length. A polypeptide, in contrast with a<br>
peptide, may comprise any number of amino acid residues. Hence, the term polypeptide included<br>
peptides as well as longer sequences of amino acids.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and<br>
compositions that are "generally regarded as safe", e.g., that are physiologically tolerable and do not<br>
typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, dizziness and the like,<br>
when administered to a human. Preferably, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means<br>
approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia<br>
or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The<br>
term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the compound is<br>
administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those<br>
of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil<br>
and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are<br>
preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin.<br>
As used herein the term "agonist" refers to a biologically active ligand which binds to its<br>
complementary biologically active receptor and activates the latter either to cause a biological response in<br>
the receptor, or to enhance preexisting biological activity of the receptor.<br>
Novel peptides that are EPO-R agonists<br>
The present invention provides novel peptide compounds, which are EPO-R agonists of<br>
dramatically enhanced potency and activity. These peptide compounds are homodimers of peptide<br>
monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLYACHMGPIT(l-nal)VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO: 1),<br>
or homodimers of peptide monomers having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLYACHMGPIT(1-<br>
nal)VCQPLR(MeG)K (SEQ ED NO: 2); where each amino acid is indicated by standard one letter<br>
abbreviation, "(AcG)" is N-acetylglycine, "(1-nal)" is 1-naphthylalanine, and "(MeG)" is "(MeG)" is N-<br>
methylglycine, also known as sarcosine. Each peptide monomer of a peptide dimer contains an<br>
intramolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of the monomer. Such monomers may be<br>
represented schematically as follows:<br><br>
These monomeric peptides are dimerized to provide peptide dimers of enhanced EPO-R agonist<br>
activity. The linker (L?) moiety is a branched teriary amide, which bridges the C-terrnini of two peptide<br>
monomers, by simultaneous attachment to the C-terminal lysine residue of each monomer. The tertiary<br>
amide linker can be depicted as:<br><br>
where: X is NCO-(CH2)2-NIH-; C1 of the linker forms an amide bond with the s-amino group of the C-<br>
terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer; C2 of the linker forms an amide bond with the s-<br>
amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer; and N1 of X is attached via<br>
a carbamate linkage or an amide linkage to an activated polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety, where the<br>
PEG has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons (the term "about" indicating that in<br>
preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight).<br>
The tertiary amide linker may also be depicted as:<br><br>
where: X is NCO-(CH2)2-NH-C3O-: Cl of the linker forms an amide bond with the s-amino group of the<br>
C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer, and C2 of the linker forms an amide bond with the<br>
e-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer. The peptide dimers of<br>
the invention further comprise a spacer moiety of the following structure:<br><br>
where: C4 of the spacer is covalently bonded to C3 of X; N1 of the spacer is covalently attached via a<br>
carbamate or an amide linkage to an activated PEG moiety; and N2 of the spacer is covalently attached via<br>
a carbamate or an amide linkage to an activated PEG moiety, where PEG has a molecular weight of about<br>
10,000 to about 60,000 Daltons (the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules<br>
will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight).<br>
Thus, the novel peptides of the invention can also contain a PEG moiety, which is covalently<br>
attached via a carbamate linkage or an amide linkage to the tertiary amide linker of the peptide dimer.<br>
PEG is a water soluble polymer that is pharmaceutically acceptable. PEG for use in the present invention<br>
may be linear, unbranched PEG having a molecular weight of about 20 kilodaltons (20K) to about 60K<br>
(the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less,<br>
than the stated molecular weight). Most preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 30K to<br>
about 40K. One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer size based on such<br>
considerations as the desired dosage; circulation time; resistance to proteolysis; effects, if any, on<br>
biological activity; ease in handling; degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of PEG on a<br>
therapeutic peptide.<br>
Peptides, peptide dimers and other peptide-based molecules of the invention can be attached to<br>
water-soluble polymers (e.g., PEG) using any of a variety of chemistries to link the water-soluble<br>
polymer(s) to the receptor-binding portion of the molecule (e.g., peptide + spacer). A typical embodiment<br>
employs a single attachment junction for covalent attachment of the water soluble polymer(s) to the<br>
receptor-binding portion, however in alternative embodiments multiple attachment junctions may be used,<br>
including further variations wherein different species of water-soluble polymer are attached to the<br>
receptor-binding portion at distinct attachment junctions, which may include covalent attachment<br>
junction(s) to the spacer and/or to one or both peptide chains. In some embodiments, the dimer or higher<br>
order multimer will comprise distinct species of peptide chain (i.e., a heterodimer or other<br>
heteromultimer). By way of example and not limitation, a dimer may comprise a first peptide chain<br>
having a PEG attachment junction and the second peptide chain may either lack a PEG attachment<br>
junction or utilize a different linkage chemistry than the first peptide chain and in some variations the<br>
spacer may contain or lack a PEG attachment junction and said spacer, if PEGylated, may utilize a<br>
linkage chemistry different than that of the first and/or second peptide chains. An alternative embodiment<br>
employs a PEG attached to the spacer portion of the receptor-binding portion and a different water-<br>
soluble polymer (e.g., a carbohydrate) conjugated to a side chain of one of the amino acids of the peptide<br>
portion of the molecule.<br>
A wide variety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) species may be used for PEGylation of the receptor-<br>
binding portion (peptides + spacer). Substantially any suitable reactive PEG reagent can be used. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the reactive PEG reagent will result in formation of a carbamate or amide bond<br>
upon conjugation to the receptor-binding portion. Suitable reactive PEG species include, but are not<br>
limited to, those which are available for sale in the Drug Delivery Systems catalog (2003) of NOF<br>
Corporation (Yebisu Garden Place Tower, 20-3 Ebisu 4-chome, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-6019) and the<br>
Molecular Engineering catalog (2003) of Nektar Therapeutics (490 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama<br>
35806). For example and not limitation, the following PEG reagents are often preferred in various<br>
embodiments: mPEG2-NHS, mPEG2-ALD, multi-Arm PEG, mPEG(MAL)2, mPEG2(MAL), mPEG-<br>
NH2, mPEG-SPA, mPEG-SBA, mPEG-thioesters, mPEG-Double Esters, mPEG-BTC, mPEG-<br>

NHS-PEG-VS, NHS-PEG-MAL), PEG acrylates (ACRL-PEG-NHS), PEG-phosphoIipids (e.g., mPEG-<br>
DSPE), multiarmed PEGs of the SUNBRITE series including the GL series of glycerine-based PEGs<br>
activated by a chemistry chosen by those skilled in the art, any of the SUNBRITE activated PEGs<br>
(including but not limited to carboxyl-PEGs, p-NP-PEGs, Tresyl-PEGs, aldehyde PEGs, acetal-PEGs,<br>
amino-PEGs, thiol-PEGs, maleimido-PEGs, hydroxyl-PEG-amine, amino-PEG-COOH, hydroxyl-PEG-<br>
aldehyde, carboxylic anhydride type-PEG, functionalized PEG-phospholipid, and other similar and/or<br>
suitable reactive PEGs as selected by those skilled in the art for their particular application and usage.<br>
The novel peptides of the invention can also contain two PEG moieties that are covalently<br>
attached via a carbamate or an amide linkage to a spacer moiety, wherein the spacer moiety is covalently<br>
bonded to the tertiary amide linker of the peptide dimer. Each of the two PEG moieties used in such<br>
embodiments of the present invention may be linear and may be linked together at a single point of<br>
attachment Each PEG moiety preferably has a molecular weight of about 10 kilodaltons (10K) to about<br>
60K (the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some<br>
less, than the stated molecular weight). Linear PEG moieties are particularly preferred. More preferably,<br>
each of the two PEG moieties has a molecular weight of about 20K to about 40K, and still more<br>
preferably between about 20K and about 40K. Still more preferably, each of the two PEG moieties has a<br>
molecular weight of about 20K. One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer size based<br>
on such considerations as the desired dosage; circulation time; resistance to proteolysis; effects, if any, on<br>
biological activity; ease in handling; degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of PEG on a<br>
therapeutic peptide.<br>
The present invention also comprises peptide agonists that are homodimers of peptide monomers<br>
having the amino acid sequence (AcG)GLYACHMGPIT(l-nal)VCQPLR(MeG) (SEQ ID NO: 3), where<br>
each amino acid is indicated by standard one letter abbreviation, "(AcG)" is N-acetylglycine, "(1-nal)" is<br>
1-naphthylalanine, and "(MeG)" is N-methylglycine, also known as sarcosine. Each peptide monomer of<br>
the peptide dimer contains an intramolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of the<br>
monomer. Such monomers may be represented schematically as follows:<br><br>
These monomeric peptides are dimerized to provide peptide dimers of enhanced EPO-R agonist<br>
activity. The linker (L?) moiety is a lysine residue, which bridges the C-termini of two peptide<br>
monomers, by simultaneous attachment to the C-terminal amino acid of each monomer. One peptide<br>
monomer is attached at its C-terminus to the lysine's e-amino group and the second peptide monomer is<br>
attached at its C-terminus to the lysine's a-amino group. For example, the dimer may be illustrated<br>
structurally as shown in Formula I, and summarized as shown in Formula II:<br><br>
In Formula I and Formula n, N2 represents the nitrogen atom of lysine's e-amino group and N1 represents<br>
the nitrogen atom of lysine's a-amino group.<br>
The peptide dimers of the invention further comprise a spacer moiety of the following structure:<br><br>
At one end, N1 of the spacer is attached via an amide linkage to a carbonyl carbon of the lysine linker. At<br>
the opposite end, N2 of the spacer is attached via a carbamate linkage or an amide linkage to an activated<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety, where the PEG has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about<br>
60,000 Daltons (the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh<br>
more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). More preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of<br>
about 20,000 to 40,000 Daltons.<br>
Thus, the novel peptides of the invention also contain a PEG moiety, which is covalently attached<br>
to the peptide dimer. PEG is a water soluble polymer that is pharmaceutically acceptable. PEG for use in<br>
the present invention may be linear, unbranched PEG having a molecular weight of about 20 kilodaltons<br>
(20K) to about 60K (the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh<br>
more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Most preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of<br>
about 20K to about 40K, and still more preferably a molecular weight of about 30K to about 40K. One<br>
skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer size based on such considerations as the desired<br>
dosage; circulation time; resistance to proteolysis; effects, if any, on biological activity; ease in handling;<br>
degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of PEG on a therapeutic peptide.<br>

This dimeric structure can be written [Ac-peptide, disulfide]2Lys-spacer-PEG20-40K to denote an<br>
N-terminally acetylated peptide bound to both the a and e amino groups of lysine with each peptide<br>
containing an intramolecular disulfide loop and a spacer molecule forming a covalent linkage between the<br>
C-terrninus of lysine and a PEG moiety, where the PEG has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about<br>
40,000 Daltons.<br>
Preferred peptide dimers of the present invention include, but are not limited to:<br><br>
Stercoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino<br>
acids such as a,a-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional<br>
amino acids may also be suitable components for compounds of the present invention. Examples of<br>
unconventional amino acids include, but are not limited to: ß-alanine, 3-pyridylalanine, 4-hydroxyproline,<br>
O-phosphoserine, N-methylglycine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-<br>
hydroxylysine, nor-leuoine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids. Other modifications are also<br>
possible, including modification of the amino terminus, modification of the carboxy terminus,<br>
replacement of one or more of the naturally occurring genetically encoded amino acids with an<br>
unconventional amino acid, modification of the side chain of one or more amino acid residues, peptide<br>
phosporylation, and the like.<br>
The peptide sequences of the present invention and be present alone or in conjunction with N-<br>
terminal and/or C-terminal extensions of the peptide chain. Such extensions may be naturally encoded<br>
peptide sequences optionally with or substantially without non-naturally occurring sequences; the<br>
extensions may include any additions, deletions, point mutations, or other sequence modifications or<br>
combinations as desired by those skilled in the art. For example and not limitation, naturally-occurring<br>
sequences may be full-length or partial length and may include amino acid substitutions to provide a site<br>
for attachment of carbohydrate, PEG, other polymer, or the lite via side chain conjugation. In a variation,<br>
the amino acid substitution results in humanization of a sequence to make in compatible with the human<br>
immune system. Fusion proteins of all types are provided, including immunoglobulin sequences adjacent<br>
to or in near proximity to the EPO-R activating sequences of the present invention with or without a non-<br>
immunoglobulin spacer sequence. One type of embodiment is an immunoglobulin chain having the EPO-<br>
R activating sequence in place of the variable (V) region of the heavy and/or light chain.<br>
Preparation of the peptide compounds of the invention:<br>
Peptide synthesis<br>
The peptides of the invention may be prepared by classical methods known in the art. These<br>
standard methods include exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis methods, fragment<br>
condensation, classical solution synthesis, and recombinant DNA technology [See, e.g., Merrifield J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1963 85:2149].<br>
In one embodiment, the peptide monomers of a peptide dimer are synthesized individually and<br>
dimerized subsequent to synthesis.<br>
In another embodiment, the peptide monomers of a dimer are linked via their C-terrnini by a<br>
branched tertiary amide linker LK moiety having two mnctional groups capable of serving as initiation<br>
sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that<br>
enables binding to another molecular moiety (e.g., as may be present on the surface of a solid support). In<br>
this case, the two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto two reactive nitrogen groups of the<br>
linker LK moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. Such synthesis may be sequential<br>
or simultaneous.<br>
In another embodiment, the two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto two reactive<br>
nitrogen groups of the linker LK moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. Such<br>
synthesis may be sequential or simultaneous. In this embodiment, a lysine linker (Lk) moiety having two<br>
amino groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g.,<br>
the carboxyl group of a lysine; or the amino group of a lysine amide, a lysine residue wherein the<br>
carboxyl group has been converted to an amide moiety -CONH2) that enables binding to another<br>
molecular moiety (e.g., as may be present on the surface of a solid support) is used.<br>
Where sequential synthesis of the peptide chains of a dimer onto a linker is to be performed, two<br>
amine functional groups on the linker molecule are protected with two different orthogonally removable<br>
amine protecting groups. The protected linker is coupled to a solid support via the linker's third<br>
functional group. The first amine protecting group is removed, and the first peptide of the dimer is<br>
synthesized on the first deprotected amine moiety. Then the second amine protecting group is removed,<br>
and the second peptide of the dimer is synthesized on the second deprotected amine moiety. For example,<br>
the first amino moiety of the linker may be protected with Alloc, and the second with Fmoc. In this case,<br>
the Fmoc group (but not the Alloc group) may be removed by treatment with a mild base [e.g., 20%<br>
piperidine in dimethyl formamide (DMF)], and the first peptide chain synthesized. Thereafter the Alloc<br>
group may be removed with a suitable reagent [e.g., Pd(PPh3)/4-methyl morpholine and chloroform], and<br>
the second peptide chain synthesized. Note that where different thiol-protecting groups for cysteine are to<br>
be used to control disulfide bond formation (as discussed below) this technique must be used even where<br>
the final amino acid sequences of the peptide chains of a dimer are identical.<br>
Where simultaneous synthesis of the peptide chains of a dimer onto a linker is to be performed,<br>
two amine functional groups of the linker molecule are protected with the same removable amine<br>
protecting group. The protected linker is coupled to a solid support via the linker's third functional group.<br>
In this case the two protected functional groups of the linker molecule are simultaneously deprotected,<br>
and the two peptide chains simultaneously synthesized on the deprotected amines. Note that using this<br>
technique, the sequences of the peptide chains of the dimer will be identical, and the thiol-protecting<br>
groups for the cysteine residues are all the same.<br>
A preferred method for peptide synthesis is solid phase synthesis. Solid phase peptide synthesis<br>
procedures are well-known in the art [see, e.g., Stewart Solid Phase Peptide Syntheses (Freeman and Co.:<br>
San Francisco) 1969; 2002/2003 General Catalog from Novabiochem Corp, San Diego, USA; Goodman<br>
Synthesis of Peptides and Peptidomimetics (Houben-Weyl, Stuttgart) 2002]. In solid phase synthesis,<br>
synthesis is typically commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide using an a-amino protected<br>
resin. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for instance, by attaching the required a-amino acid to<br>
a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, a polystyrene resin, a benzhydrylamine resin, or the<br>
like. One such chloromethylated resin is sold under the trade name BIO-BEADS SX-1 by Bio Rad<br>
Laboratories (Richmond, CA). The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin has been described<br>
[Bodonszky, et al. (1966) Chem. Ihd. London 38:1597]. The benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin has been<br>
described [Pietta and Marshall (1970) Chem. Commun. 650], and the hydrochloride form is commercially<br>
available from Beckman Instruments, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). For example, an a-amino protected amino<br>
acid may be coupled to a chloromethylated resin with the aid of a cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according<br>
to the method described by Gisin (1973) Helv. Chim. Acta 56:1467.<br>
After initial coupling, the a-amino protecting group is removed, for example, using<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions in organic solvents at room temperature.<br>
Thereafter, a-amino protected amino acids are successively coupled to a growing support-bound peptide<br>
chain. The a-amino protecting groups are those known to be useful in the art of stepwise synthesis of<br>
pepu'des, including: acyl-type protecting groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoroacetyl, acetyl), aromatic urethane-<br>
type protecting groups [e.g., benzyloxycarboyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz], aliphatic urethane protecting<br>
groups [e.g., t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl], and alkyl type<br>
protecting groups (e.g., benzyl, triphenylmethyl), fluorenylmethyl oxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbonyl<br>
(Alloc), and l-{4,4-dimetbyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-l-ylidene)ethyl (Dde).<br>
The side chain protecting groups (typically ethers, esters, trityl, PMC, and the like) remain intact<br>
during coupling and is not split off during the deprotection of the ammo-terminus protecting group or<br>
during coupling. The side chain protecting group must be removable upon the completion of the<br>
synthesis of the final peptide and under reaction conditions that will not alter the target peptide. The side<br>
chain protecting groups for Tyr include tetrahydropyranyl, tert-butyl, trityl, benzyl, Cbz, Z-Br-Cbz, and<br>
2,5-dichloTobenzyl. The side chain protecting groups for Asp include benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, methyl,<br>
ethyl, and cyclohexyl. The side chain protecting groups for Thr and Ser include aceryl, benzoyl, trityl,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, and Cbz. The side chain protecting groups for Arg include<br>
nitro, Tosyl (Tos), Cbz, adamantyloxycarbonyl mesitoylsulfonyl (Mts), 2,2,4,6,7-<br>
pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), 4-mthoxy-2,3,6-trimethyl-benzenesulfonyl (Mtr), or<br>
Boc. The side chain protecting groups for Lys include Cbz, 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Cl-Cbz), 2-<br>
bromobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Br-Cbz), Tos, or Boc.<br>
After removal of the a-amino protecting group, the remaining protected amino acids are coupled<br>
stepwise in the desired order. Each protected amino acid is generally reacted in about a 3-fold excess<br>
using an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-1,1,3,3<br>
tetramethyluronium hexailuorophosphate (HBTU) or dicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCC) in solution, for<br>
example,' in methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide (DMF), or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the desired peptide is decoupled from<br>
the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrogen fluoride<br>
(HF), which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin, but also cleaves all remaining side chain<br>
protecting groups. When a chloromethylated resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results in the<br>
formation of the free peptide acids. When the benzhydrylamine resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment<br>
results directly in the free peptide amide. Alternatively, when the chloromethylated resin is employed, the<br>
side chain protected peptide can be decoupled by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give the<br>
desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a side chain protected alkylamide or<br>
dialkylamide. Side chain protection is then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen<br>
fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides.<br>
In preparing the esters of the invention, the resins used to prepare the peptide acids are employed,<br>
and the side chain protected peptide is cleaved with base and the appropriate alcohol (e.g., methanol).<br>
Side chain protecting groups are then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to<br>
obtain the desired ester.<br>
These procedures can also be used to synthesize peptides in which amino acids other than the 20<br>
naturally occurring, genetically encoded amino acids are substituted at one, two, or more positions of any<br>
of the compounds of the invention. Synthetic amino acids that can be substituted into the peptides of the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, N-methyl, L-hydroxypropyl, L-3, 4-<br>
dihydroxyphenylalanyl, d amino acids such as L- d-hydroxylysyl and D-d-methylalanyl, L-a-<br>
methylalanyl, ß amino acids, and isoquinolyl. D-amino acids and non-naturally occurring synthetic<br>
amino acids can also be incorporated into the peptides of the present invention.<br>
Peptide modifications<br>
One can also modify the amino and/or carboxy termini of the peptide compounds of the invention<br>
to produce other compounds of the invention. For example, the amino terminus may be acetylated with<br>
acetic acid or a halogenated derivative thereof such as a-chloroacetic acid, a-bromoacetic acid, or a-<br>
iodoacetic acid).<br>
One can replace the naturally occurring side chains of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (or<br>
the stereoisomeric D amino acids) with other side chains, for instance with groups such as alkyl, lower<br>
alkyl, cyclic 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered alkyl, amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower<br>
alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and with 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered<br>
heterocyclic. In particular, proline analogues in which the ring size of the proline residue is changed from<br>
5 members to 4, 6, or 7 members can be employed. Cyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if<br>
unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic. Heterocyclic groups preferably contain one or more<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur heteroatoms. Examples of such groups include the furazanyl, furyl,<br>
imidazolidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl (e.g. morpholino),<br>
oxazolyl, piperazinyl (e.g., 1-piperazinyl), piperidyl (e.g., 1-piperidyl, piperidino), pyranyl, pyrazinyl,<br>
pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl (e.g., 1-pyrrolidinyl),<br>
pyrrolinyl, pyrrolyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiomorpholinyl (e.g., thiomorpholino), and triazolyl.<br>
These heterocyclic groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Where a group is substituted, the<br>
substituent can be alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, oxygen, or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl.<br>
One can also readily modify peptides by phosphorylation, and other methods [e.g., as described in<br>
Hruby, et al. (1990) Biochem J. 268:249-262].<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention also serve as structural models for non-peptidic<br>
compounds with similar biological activity. Those of skill in the art recognize that a variety of techniques<br>
are available for constructing compounds with the same or similar desired biological activity as the lead<br>
peptide compound, but with more favorable activity than the lead with respect to solubility, stability, and<br>
susceptibility to hydrolysis and proteolysis [See, Morgan and Gainor (1989) Ann. Rep. Med. Chem.<br>
24:243-252]. These techniques include replacing the peptide backbone with a backbone composed of<br>
phosphonates, amidates, carbamates, sulfonamides, secondary amines, and N-methylamino acids.<br>
Formation of disulfide bonds<br>
The compounds of the present invention contain two intramolecular disulfide bonds. Such<br>
disulfide bonds may be formed by oxidation of the cysteine residues of each peptide monomer.<br>
In one embodiment, the control of cysteine bond formation is exercised by choosing an oxidizing<br>
agent of the type and concentration effective to optimize formation of the desired isomer. For example,<br>
oxidation of a peptide dimer to form two intramolecular disulfide bonds (one on each peptide chain) is<br>
preferentially achieved (over formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds) when the oxidizing agent is<br>
DMSO or iodine (I2).<br>
In other embodiments, the formation of cysteine bonds is controlled by the selective use of thiol-<br>
protecting groups during peptide synthesis. For example, where a dimer with two intramolecular<br>
disulfide bonds is desired, the first monomer peptide chain is synthesized with the two cysteine residues<br>
of the core sequence protected with a first thiol protecting group [e.g., trityl(Trt), allyloxycarbonyl<br>
(Alloc), and 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)ethyl (Dde)or the like], then the second<br>
monomer peptide is synthesized the two cysteine residues of the core sequence protected with a second<br>
thiol protecting group different from the first thiol protecting group [e.g., acetamidomethyl (Acm), t-butyl<br>
(tBu), or the like]. Thereafter, the first thiol protecting groups are removed effecting bisulfide cyclization<br>
of the first monomer, and then the second thiol protecting groups are removed effecting bisulfide<br>
cyclization of the second monomer.<br>
Other embodiments of this invention provide for analogues of these disulfide derivatives in which<br>
one of the sulfurs has been replaced by a CH2 group or other isotere for sulfur. These analogues can be<br>
prepared from the compounds of the present invention, wherein each peptide monomer contains at least<br>
one C or homocysteine residue and an a-amino-?-butyric acid in place of the second C residue, via an<br>
intramolecular or intermolecular displacement, using methods known in the art [See, e.g., Barker, et al.<br>
(1992) J. Med. Chem. 35:2040-2048 and Or, et al. (1991) J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149]. One of skill in<br>
the art will readily appreciate that this displacement can also occur using other homologs of a-amino-?-<br>
butyric acid and homocysteine.<br>
In addition to the foregoing cyclization strategies, other non-disulfide peptide cyclization<br>
strategies can be employed. Such alternative cyclization strategies include, for example, amide-<br>
cyclisation strategies as well as those involving the formation of thio-ether bonds. Thus, the compounds<br>
of the present invention can exist in a cyclized form with either an intramolecular amide bond or an<br>
intramolecular thio-ether bond. For example, a peptide may be synthesized wherein one cysteine of the<br>
core sequence is replaced with lysine and the second cysteine is replaced with glutamic acid. Thereafter a<br>
cyclic monomer may be formed through an amide bond between the side chains of these two residues.<br>
Alternatively, a peptide may be synthesized wherein one cysteine of the core sequence is replaced with<br>
lysine (or serine). A cyclic monomer may then be formed through a thio-ether linkage between the side<br>
chains of the lysine (or serine) residue and the second cysteine residue of the core sequence. As such, in<br>
addition to disulfide cyclization strategies, amide-cyclization strategies and thio-ether cyclization<br>
strategies can both be readily used to cyclize the compounds of the present invention. Alternatively, the<br>
amino-terminus of the peptide can be capped with an a-substituted acetic acid, wherein the a-substituent<br>
is a leaving group, such as an a-haloacetic acid, for example, a-chloroacetic acid, a-bromoacetic acid, or<br>
a-iodoacetic acid.<br>
Addition of branched tertiary amide linker<br>
The peptide monomers may be dimerized by a branched tertiary amide linker moeity. In one<br>
embodiment, the linker is incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a<br>
linker Lk moiety contains two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis<br>
and one or more other functional groups (e.g., a carboxyl group or an ammo group) that enables binding<br>
to one or more other molecular moieties, the linker may be conjugated to a solid support. Thereafter, two<br>
peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker Lk<br>
moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique.<br>
In alternate embodiments, the linker may be conjugated to the two peptide monomers of a peptide<br>
dimer after peptide synthesis. Such conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the linker contains two functional groups suitable for attachment to the target<br>
functional groups of the synthesized peptide monomers. For example, a linker containing two carboxyl<br>
groups, either preactivated or in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent, may be reacted with the<br>
target lysine side chain amine groups of each of two peptide monomers.<br>
For example, the peptide momomers may be chemically coupled to the tertiary amide linker,<br><br>
where: X is NCO-(CH2)2-NH-Y and Y is a suitable protecting group, such as a t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)<br>
protecting group; A* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C1 of<br>
the linker to the e-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide monomer; and B* is a<br>
suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C2 of the linker to the s-amino<br>
group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer.<br>
Additionally, for example, the peptide monomers may be chemically coupled to the tertiary<br>
amide linker,<br><br>
where: X is NCO-(CH2)2-NH-C3O-; A* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to<br>
conjugate C1 of the linker to the c-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the first peptide<br>
monomer; and B* is a suitable functional group, such as N-oxy succinimide, used to conjugate C2 of the<br>
linker to the s-amino group of the C-terminal lysine residue of the second peptide monomer; and the<br>
tertiary amide linker is chemically bonded to the spacer moiety,<br><br>
where: C3 of X is covalently bonded to C4 of the spacer; and Y is a suitable protecting group, such as a t-<br>
butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group.<br>
Addition of lysine linker<br>
The peptide monomers may be dimerized by a lysine linker LK moiety. In one embodiment, the<br>
lysine linker in incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a lysine linker<br>
LK moiety contains two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a<br>
third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to another<br>
molecular moiety, the linker may be conjugated to a solid support Thereafter, two peptide monomers<br>
may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the lysine linker Lk moiety in a<br>
variation of the solid phase synthesis technique.<br>
In alternate embodiments where a peptide dimer is dimerized by a lysine linker Lk moiety, said<br>
linker may be conjugated to the two peptide monomers of a peptide dimer after peptide synthesis. Such<br>
conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art. In one embodiment, the linker<br>
contains at least two functional groups suitable for attachment to the target functional groups of the<br>
synthesized peptide monomers. For example, a the lysine's two free amine groups may be reacted with<br>
the C-terminal carboxyl groups of each of two peptide monomers.<br>
Addition of spacer<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention further comprise a spacer moiety. In one embodiment<br>
the spacer may be incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a spacer<br>
contains a free amino group and a second functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that<br>
enables binding to another molecular moiety, the spacer may be conjugated to the solid support.<br>
In one embodiment, a spacer containing two functional groups is first coupled to the solid support<br>
via a first functional group. Next the lysine linker Lk. moiety having two functional groups capable of<br>
serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an<br>
amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety is conjugated to the spacer via the<br>
spacer's second functional group and the linker's third functional group. Thereafter, two peptide<br>
monomers may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker LK moiety in a<br>
variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. For example, a solid support coupled spacer with a free<br>
amine group may be reacted with a lysine linker via the linker's free carboxyl group.<br>
In alternate embodiments the spacer may be conjugated to the peptide dimer after peptide<br>
synthesis. Such conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art. In one embodiment,<br>
the linker contains at least one functional group suitable for attachment to the target functional group of<br>
the synthesized peptide. For example, a spacer with a free amine group may be reacted with a peptide's<br>
C-terminal carboxyl group. In another example, a linker with a free carboxyl group may be reacted with<br>
the free amine group of a lysine amide.<br>
Attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG)<br>
In recent years, water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been used for<br>
the covalent modification of peptides of therapeutic and diagnostic importance. Attachment of such<br>
polymers is thought to enhance biological activity, prolong blood circulation time, reduce<br>
immunogenicity, increase aqueous solubility, and enhance resistance to protease digestion. For example,<br>
covalent attachment of PEG to therapeutic polypeptides such as interleukins [Knauf, et al. (19SS) J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 263;15064; Tsutsumi, et al. (1995) J. Controlled Release 33:447), interferons (Kita, et al. (1990)<br>
Drug Des. Delivery 6:157), catalase (Abuchowski, et al. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252:582), superoxide<br>
dismutase (Beauchamp, et al. (1983) Anal. Biochem. 131:25), and adenosine deaminase (Chen, et al.<br>
(19S1) Biochim. Biophy. Acta 660:293), has been reported to extend their half life in vivo, and/or reduce<br>
their immunogenicity and antigenicity.<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention may comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety,<br>
which is covalently attached to the branched tertiary amide linker or the spacer of the peptide dimer via a<br>
carbamate linkage or via an amide linkage. An example of PEG used in the present invention is linear,<br>
unbranched PEG having a molecular weight of about 20 kiloDaltons (20K) to about 40K (the term<br>
"about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the<br>
stated molecular weight). Preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 30K to about 40K.<br>
Another example of PEG used in the present invention is linear PEG having a molecular weight<br>
of about 10K to about 60K (the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will<br>
weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of<br>
about 20K to about 40K. More preferably, the PEG has a molecular weight of about 20K.<br>
Examples of methods for covalent attachment of PEG (PEGylation) are described below. These<br>
illustrative descriptions are not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
a variety of methods for covalent attachment of a broad range of PEG is well established in the art. As<br>
such, peptide compounds to which PEG has been attached by any of a number of attachment methods<br>
known in the art are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
For example, PEG may be covalently bound to the linker via a reactive group to which an<br>
activated PEG molecule may be bound (e.g., a free ammo group or carboxyl group). PEG molecules may<br>
be attached to amino groups using methoxylatcd PEG ("mPEG") having different reactive moieties. Such<br>
polymers include mPEG-succinimidyl succinate, mPEG-succinimidyl carbonate, mPEG-imidate, mPEG-<br>
4-nitrophenyl carbonate, and mPEG-cyanuric chloride. Similarly, PEG molecules may be attached to<br>
carboxyl groups using methoxylated PEG with a free amine group (mPEG-NH2).<br>
In some embodiments, the linker or spacer contains a terminal amino group (i.e., positioned at the<br>
terminus of the spacer). This terminal amino group may be reacted with a suitably activated PEG<br>
molecule, such as mPEG-para-nitrophenylcarbonate (mPEG-NPC), to make a stable covalent carbamate<br>
bond. Alternatively, mis terminal amino group may be reacted with a suitably activated PEG molecule,<br>
such as an mPEG-succinimidyl butyrate (mPEG-SBA) or mPEG-succinimidyl propionate (mPEG-SPA)<br>
containing a reactive N-hydroxl-succinimide (NHS) group, to make a stable covalent carbamate bond. In<br>
other embodiments, the linker reactive group contains a carboxyl group capable of being activated to form<br>
a covalent bond with an amine-containing PEG molecule under suitable reaction conditions. Suitable<br>
PEG molecules include mPEG-NH2 and suitable reaction conditions include carbodiimide-mediated<br>
amide formation or the like.<br>
EPO-R agonist activity assays:<br>
In vitro functional assays<br>
In vitro competitive binding assays quantitate the ability of a test peptide to compete with EPO<br>
for binding to EPO-R. For example (see, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,773,569), the extracellular<br>
domain of the human EPO-R (EPO binding protein, EBP) may be recombinantly produced in E. coli and<br>
the recombinant protein coupled to a solid support, such as a microtitre dish or a synthetic bead [e.g.,<br>
Sulfolink beads from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, DL)]. Immobilized EBP is then incubated with<br>
labeled recombinant EPO, or with labeled recombinant EPO and a test peptide. Serial dilutions of test<br>
peptide are employed for such experiments. Assay points with no added test peptide define total EPO<br>
binding to EBP. For reactions containing test peptide, the amount of bound EPO is quantitated and<br>
expressed as a percentage of the control (total=100%) binding. These values are plotted versus peptide<br>
concentration. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of test peptide which reduces the binding<br>
of EPO to EBP by 50% (i.e., 50% inhibition of EPO binding).<br>
A different in vitro competitive binding assay measures the light signal generated as a function of<br>
the proximity of two beads: an EPO-conjugated bead and an EPO-R-conjugated bead. Bead proximity is<br>
generated by the binding of EPO to EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with EPO for binding to EPO-R<br>
will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a 50% decrease in light emission is defined as the IC50 value.<br>
The peptides of the present invention compete very efficiently with EPO for binding to the EPO-<br>
R. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to inhibit the binding of EPO at substantially<br>
lower concentrations of peptide (i.e., they have very low IC50 values).<br>
The biological activity and potency of monomeric and dimeric peptide EPO-R agonists of the<br>
invention, which bind specifically to the EPO-receptor, may be measured using in vitro cell-based<br>
functional assays.<br>
One assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line expressing human EPO-R and further<br>
transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Upon exposure to EPO or<br>
another EPO-R agonist, such cells respond by synthesizing luciferase. Luciferase causes the emission of<br>
light upon addition of its substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of EPO-R activation in such cells may be<br>
quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity. The activity of a test peptide is measured by adding<br>
serial dilutions of the test peptide to the cells, which are then incubated for 4 hours. After incubation,<br>
luciferin substrate is added to the cells, and light emission is measured. The concentration of test peptide<br>
that results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50.<br>
The peptides of the present invention show dramatically enhanced ability to promote EPO-R<br>
signaling-dependent luciferase expression in this assay. This enhanced function is represented by their<br>
ability to yield half of the maximal luciferase activity at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e.,<br>
they have very low EC50 values). This assay is a preferred method for estimating the potency and<br>
activity of an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention.<br>
Another assay may be performed using FDC-P1/ER cells [Dexter, et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med.<br>
152:1036-1047], a well characterized nontransformed murine bone marrow derived cell line into which<br>
EPO-R has been stably transfected. These cells exhibit EPO-dependent proliferation.<br>
In one such assay, the cells are grown to half stationary density in the presence of the necessary<br>
growth factors (see, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,773,569). The cells are then" washed in PBS and<br>
starved for 16-24 hours in whole media without the growth factors. After determining the viability of the<br>
cells (e.g., by trypan blue staining), stock solutions (in whole media without the growth factors) are made<br>
to give about 105 cells per 50µL. Serial dilutions of the peptide EPO-R agonist compounds (typically the<br>
free, solution phase peptide as opposed to a phage-bound or other bound or immobilized peptide) to be<br>
tested are made in 96-well tissue culture plates for a final volume of 50µL per well. Cells (50µL) are<br>
added to each well and the cells are incubated 24-48 hours, at which point the negative controls should<br>
die or be quiescent Cell proliferation is then measured by techniques known in the art, such as an MTT<br>
assay which measures H3-thymidine incorporation as an indication of cell proliferation [see, Mosmann<br>
(1983) J. Immunol. Methods 65:55-63]. Peptides are evaluated on both the EPO-R-expressing cell line<br>
and a parental non-expressing cell line. The concentration of test peptide necessary to yield one half of<br>
the maximal cell proliferation is recorded as the EC50.<br>
The peptides of the present invention show dramatically enhanced ability to promote EPO-<br>
dependent cell growth in this assay. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to yield half of<br>
the maximal cell proliferation stimulation activity at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e.,<br>
they have very low EC50 values). This assay is a preferred method for estimating the potency and<br>
activity of an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention.<br>
In another assay, the cells are grown to stationary phase in EPO-supplemented medium, collected,<br>
and then cultured for an additional 18 hr in medium without EPO. The cells are divided into three groups<br>
of equal cell density: one group with no added factor (negative control), a group with EPO (positive<br>
control), and an experimental group with the test peptide. The cultured cells are then collected at various<br>
time points, fixed, and stained with a DNA-binding fluorescent, dye (e.g., propidium iodide or Hoechst<br>
dye, bom available from Sigma). Fluorescence is then measured, for example, using a FACS Scan Flow<br>
cytometer. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle may then be determined, for example,<br>
using the SOBR model of CellFIT software (Becton Dickinson). Cells treated with EPO or an active<br>
peptide will show a greater proportion of cells in S phase (as determined by increased fluorescence as an<br>
indicator of increased DNA content) relative to the negative control group.<br>
Similar assays may be performed using FDCP-1 [see, e.g., Dexter et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med.<br>
152:1036-1047] or TF-1 [Kitamura, et ah (1989) Blood 73:375-380] cell lines. FDCP-1 is a growth<br>
factor dependent murine multi-potential primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell line that can proliferate,<br>
but not differentiate, when supplemented with WEHI-3-conditioned media (a medium that contains IL-3,<br>
ATCC number TIB-68). For such experiments, the FDCP-1 cell line is transfected with the human or<br>
murine EPO-R to produce FDCP-1-hEPO-R or FDCP-1-mEPO-R cell lines, respectively, that can<br>
proliferate, but not differentiate, in the presence of EPO. TF-1, an EPO-dependent cell line, may also be<br>
used to measure the effects of peptide EPO-R agonists on cellular proliferation.<br>
In yet another assay, the procedure set forth in Krystal (1983) Exp. Hematol 11:649-660 for a<br>
microassay based on H3-thymidine incorporation into spleen cells may be employed to ascertain the<br>
ability of the compounds of the present invention to serve as EPO agonists. In brief, B6C3Fi mice are<br>
injected daily for two days with phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg). On the third day, spleen cells are removed<br>
and their ability to proliferate over a 24 hour period ascertained using an MTT assay.<br>
The binding of EPO to EPO-R in an erythropoietin-responsive cell line induces tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation of both the receptor and numerous intraccllular proteins, including She, vav and JAK2<br>
kinase. Therefore, another in vitro assay measures the ability of peptides of the invention to induce<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R and downstream intracellular signal transducer proteins. Active<br>
peptides, as identified by binding and proliferation assays described above, elicit a phosphorylation<br>
pattern nearly identical to that of EPO in erythropoietin-responsive cells. For this assay, FDC-P1/ER<br>
cells [Dexter, et al. (1980) J Exp Med 152:1036-47] are maintained in EPO-supplemented medium and<br>
grown to stationary phase. These cells are then cultured in medium without EPO for 24 hr. A defined<br>
number of such cells is then incubated with a test peptide for approximately 10 min at 37°C. A control<br>
sample of cells with EPO is also run with each assay. The treated cells are then collected by<br>
centrifugation, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.<br>
The electrophoresed proteins in the gel are transferred to nitrocellulose, and the phosphoryrosine<br>
containing proteins on the blot visualized by standard immunological techniques. For example, the blot<br>
may be probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (e.g., mouse anti-phosphotyrosine IgG from<br>
Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), washed, and then probed with a secondary antibody [e.g., peroxidase<br>
labeled goat anti-mouse IgG from Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Washington, DC)]. Thereafter,<br>
phosphotyrosine-containing proteins may be visualized by standard techniques including colorimetric,<br>
chemiluminescent, or fluorescent assays. For example, a chemiluminescent assay may be performed<br>
using the ECL Western Blotting System from Amersham.<br>
Another cell-based in vitro assay that may be used to assess the activity of the peptides of the<br>
present invention is a colony assay, using murine bone marrow or human peripheral blood cells. Murine<br>
bone marrow may be obtained from the femurs of mice, while a sample of human peripheral blood may<br>
obtained from a healthy donor. In the case of peripheral blood, mononuclear cells are first isolated from<br>
the blood, for example, by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient [Stem Cell Technologies,<br>
Inc. (Vancouver, Canada)]. For this assay a nucleated cell count is performed to establish the number and<br>
concentration of nucleated cells in the original sample. A defined number of cells is plated on methyl<br>
cellulose as per manufacturer's instructions [Stem Cell Technologies, Inc. (Vancouver, Canada)]. An<br>
experimental group is treated with a test peptide, a positive control group is treated with EPO, and a<br>
negative control group receives no treatment. The number of growing colonies for each group is then<br>
scored after defined periods of incubation, generally 10 days and 18 days. An active peptide will promote<br>
colony formation.<br>

the present invention are disclosed in Greenberger, et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:2931-<br>

An instrument designed by Molecular Devices Corp., known as a microphysiometer, has been<br>
reported to be successfully used for measurement of the effect of agonists and antagonists on various<br>
receptors. The basis for mis apparatus is the measurement of the alterations in the acidification rate of the<br>
extracellular media in response to receptor activation.<br>
In vivo functional assays<br>
One in vivo functional assay that may be used to assess the potency of a test peptide is the<br>
polycymemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay. For this assay, mice are subjected to an alternating<br>
conditioning cycle for several days. In this cycle, the mice alternate between periods of hypobaric<br>
conditions and ambient pressure conditions. Thereafter, the mice are maintained at ambient pressure for<br>
2-3 days prior to administration of test samples. Test peptide samples, or EPO standard in the case<br>
positive control mice, are injected subcutaneously into the conditioned mice. Radiolabeled iron (e.g.,<br>
Fe59) is administered 2 days later, and blood samples taken two days after administration of radiolabeled<br>
iron. Hematocrits and radioactivity measurements are then determined for each blood sample by standard<br>
techniques. Blood samples from mice injected with active test peptides will show greater radioactivity<br>
(due to binding of Fe59 by erythrocyte hemoglobin) than mice that did not receive test peptides or EPO.<br>
Another in vivo functional assay that may be used to assess the potency of a test peptide is the<br>
reticulocyte assay. For this assay, normal untreated mice are subcutaneously injected on three<br>
consecutive days with either EFO or test peptide. On the third day, the mice are also intraperitoneally<br>
injected with iron dextran. At day five, blood samples are collected from the mice. The percent (%) of<br>
reticulocytes in the blood is determined by thiazole orange staining and flow cytometer analysis (retic-<br>
count program). Li addition, hematocrits are manually determined. The percent of corrected<br>
reticulocytes is determined using the following formula:<br>
% RETICcorrected = % RETICobserved X (HematocritINDIVIDUAL / HematocritNORMAL)<br>
Active test compounds will show an increased % RETICCORRECTED level relative to mice that did not<br>
receive test peptides or EPO.<br>
Use of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention are useful in vitro as tools for understanding the<br>
biological role of EPO, including the evaluation of the many factors thought to influence, and be<br>
influenced by, the production of EPO and the binding of EPO to the EPO-R (e.g., the mechanism of EPO<br>
/EPO-R signal transduction/receptor activation). The present peptides are also useful in the development<br>
of other compounds that bind to the EPO-R, because the present compounds provide important structure-<br>
activity-relationship information that facilitate that development<br>
Moreover, based on their ability to bind to EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be<br>
used as reagents for detecting EPO-R on living cells; fixed cells; in biological fluids; in tissue<br>
homogenates; in purified, natural biological materials; etc. For example, by labeling such peptides, one<br>
can identify cells having EPO-R on their surfaces. In addition, based on their ability to bind EPO-R, the<br>
peptides of the present invention can be used in in situ staining, FACS (fluorescence-activated cell<br>
sorting) analysis, Western blotting, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), etc. In addition, based<br>
on their ability to bind to EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be used in receptor<br>
purification, or in purifying cells expressing EPO-R on the cell surface (or inside permeabilized cells).<br>
The peptides of the invention can also be utilized as commercial reagents for various medical<br>
research and diagnostic purposes. Such uses can include but are not limited to: (1) use as a calibration<br>
standard for quantitating the activities of candidate EPO-R agonists in a variety of functional assays; (2)<br>
use as blocking reagents in random peptide screening, i.e., in looking for new families of EPO-R peptide<br>
ligands, the peptides can be used to block recovery of EPO peptides of the present invention; (3) use in<br>
co-crystallization with EPO-R, i.e., crystals of the peptides of the present invention bound to the EPO-R<br>
may be formed, enabling determination of receptor/peptide structure by X-ray crystallography; (4) use to<br>
measure the capacity of erythrocyte precursor cells induce globin synthesis and heme complex synthesis,<br>
and to increase the number of ferritin receptors, by initiating differentiation; (5) use to maintain the<br>
proliferation and growth of EPO-dependent cell lines, such as the FDCP-1-mEPO-R and the TF-1 cell<br>
lines; (6) use related to labeling the peptides of the invention with a radioactive chromophore; and (7)<br>
other research and diagnostic applications wherein the EPO-R is preferably activated or such activation is<br>
conveniently calibrated against a known quantity of an EPO-R agonist, and the like.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, methods of treatment and manufacture of a<br>
medicament are provided. The peptide compounds of the invention may be administered to warm<br>
blooded animals, including humans, to simulate the binding of EPO to the EPO-R in vivo. Thus, the<br>
present invention encompasses methods for therapeutic treatment of disorders associated with a<br>
deficiency of EPO, which methods comprise administering a peptide of the invention in amounts<br>
sufficient to stimulate the EPO-R and thus, alleviate the symptoms associated with a deficiency of EPO in<br>
vivo. For example, the peptides of this invention will find use in the treatment of renal insufficiency<br>
and/or end-stage renal failure/dialysis; anemia associated with AIDS; anemia associated with chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases (for example, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic bowel inflammation) and<br>
autoimmune disease; and for boosting the red blood count of a patient prior to surgery. Other disease<br>
states, disorders, and states of hematologic irregularity that may be treated by administration, of the<br>
peptides of this invention include: beta-thalassemia; cystic fibrosis; pregnancy and menstrual disorders;<br>
early anemia of prematurity; spinal cord injury; space flight; acute blood loss; aging; stroke, ischemia<br>
(both CNS and cardiac); and various neoplastic disease states accompanied by abnormal erythropoiesis.<br>
In other embodiments, the peptide compounds of the invention may be used for the treatment of<br>
disorders which are not characterized by low or deficient red blood cells, for example as a pretreatment<br>
prior to transfusions. In addition, administration of the compounds of this invention can result in a<br>
decrease in bleeding time and thus, will find use in the administration to patients prior to surgery or for<br>
indications wherein bleeding is expected to occur. In addition, the compounds of this invention will find<br>
use in the activation of megakaryoctes.<br>
Since EPO has been shown to have a mitogenic and chemotactic effect on vascular endothelial<br>
cells as well as an effect on central cholinergic neurons [see, e.g., Amagnostou, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 87:5978-5982 and Konishi, et al. (1993) Brain Res. 609:29-35], the compounds of this<br>
invention will also find use for the treatment of a variety of vascular disorders, such as: promoting wound<br>
healing; promoting growth of collateral coronary blood vessels (such as those that may occur after<br>
myocardial infarction); trauma treatment; and post-vascular graft treatment. The compounds of this<br>
invention will also find use for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders, generally<br>
characterized by low absolute levels of acetyl choline or low relative levels of acetyl choline as compared<br>
to other neuroactive substances e.g., neurofransmitters.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions of the above EPO-R<br>
agonist peptide compounds are provided. Conditions alleviated or modulated by the administration of<br>
such compositions include those indicated above. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be for<br>
administration by oral, parenteral (intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous<br>
injection), transdermal (either passively or using iontophoresis or electroporation), transmucosal (nasal,<br>
vaginal, rectal, or sublingual) routes of administration or using bioerodible inserts and can be formulated<br>
in dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration. In general, comprehended by the invention<br>
are pharmaceutical compositions comprising effective amounts of an EPO-R agonist peptide, or<br>
derivative products, of the invention together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives,<br>
solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions include diluents of various buffer<br>
content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and<br>
solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium<br>
metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose,<br>
mannitol); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as<br>
polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Hylauronic acid may also be used. Such<br>
compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo<br>
clearance of the present proteins and derivatives. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th<br>
Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042) pages 1435-1712 which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder (e.g.,<br>
lyophilized) form.<br>
Oral Delivery<br>
Contemplated for use herein are oral solid dosage forms, which are described generally in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. 1990 (Mack Publishing Co. Easton PA 18042) at Chapter<br>
89, which is herein incorporated by reference. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches<br>
or lozenges, cachets, pellets, powders, or grannies. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be<br>
used to formulate the present compositions (as, for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,925,673). Liposomal encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be derivatized with<br>
various polymers (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5.013,556). A description of possible solid dosage forms for the<br>
therapeutic is given by Marshall, K. In: Modern Pharmaceutics Edited by G.S. Banker and C.T. Rhodes<br>
Chapter 10, 1979, herein incorporated by reference. In general, the formulation will include the EPO-R<br>
agonist peptides (or chemically modified forms thereof) and inert ingredients which allow for protection<br>
against the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material in the intestine.<br>
Also contemplated for use herein are liquid dosage forms for oral administration, including<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, and syrups, which may contain other<br>
components including inert diluents; adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents; and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
The peptides may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious.<br>
Generally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the<br>
component molecule itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the<br>
blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the<br>
component or components and increase in circulation time in the body. As discussed above, PEGylation<br>
is a preferred chemical modification for pharmaceutical usage. Other moieties that may be used include:<br>
propylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyproline, poly-1,3-dioxolane and poly-1,3,6-tioxocane [see,<br>
e.g., Abuchowski and Davis (1981) "Soluble Polymer-Enzyme Adducts," in Enzymes as Drugs.<br>
Hocenberg and Roberts, eds. (Wiley-Interscience: New York, NY) pp. 367-383; and Newmark, et al.<br>
(1982) J. Appl. Biochem. 4:185-189].<br>
For oral formulations, the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the<br>
duodenum, the jejunem, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available<br>
formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or<br>
elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach<br>
environment, either by protection of the peptide (or derivative) or by release of the peptide (or derivative)<br>
beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine.<br>
To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples<br>
of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate<br>
(CAT), hydroxypropyhnethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate<br>
phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S,<br>
and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films.<br>
A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection<br>
against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to<br>
swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic (i.e.<br>
powder), for liquid forms a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick<br>
starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing<br>
techniques can be used.<br>
The peptide (or derivative) can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the<br>
form of granules or pellets of particle size about lmm. The formulation of the material for capsule<br>
administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs, or even as tablets. These therapeutics<br>
could be prepared by compression.<br>
Colorants and/or flavoring agents may also be included. For example, the peptide (or derivative)<br>
may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within<br>
an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.<br>
One may dilute or increase the volume of the peptide (or derivative) with an inert material. These<br>
diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, a-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose,<br>
sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including<br>
calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents<br>
are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell.<br>
Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form.<br>
Materials used as disintegrates include but are not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant<br>
based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxyrnethylcellulose,<br>
ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and<br>
bentonite may all be used. The disintegrants may also be insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered<br>
gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders, and can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya<br>
or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.<br>
Binders may be used to hold the peptide (or derivative) agent together to form a hard tablet and<br>
include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include<br>
methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone<br>
(PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate<br>
the peptide (or derivative).<br>
An antifrictional agent may be included in the formulation of the peptide (or derivative) to<br>
prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the peptide<br>
(or derivative) and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its<br>
magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes.<br>
Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene<br>
glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000.<br>
Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drag during formulation and to aid<br>
rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic<br>
silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.<br>
To aid dissolution of the peptide (or derivative) into the aqueous environment a surfactant might<br>
be added as a welting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,<br>
dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could<br>
include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential nonionic detergents that<br>
could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate,<br>
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 20, 40, 60, 65<br>
and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be<br>
present in the formulation of the protein or derivative either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.<br>
Additives which potentially enhance uptake of the peptide (or derivative) are for instance the fatty<br>
acids oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.<br>
Controlled release oral formulations may be desirable. The peptide (or derivative) could be<br>
incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, e.g.,<br>
gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the formulation. Some enteric<br>
coatings also have a delayed release effect. Another form of a controlled release is by a method based on<br>
the Oros therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), i.&amp; the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which<br>
allows water to enter and push drug out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects.<br>
Other coatings may be used for the formulation. These include a variety of sugars which could be<br>
applied in a coating pan. The peptide (or derivative) could also be given in a film coated tablet and the<br>
materials used in this instance are divided into 2 groups. The first are the nonenteric materials and<br>
include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose, providone<br>
and the polyethylene glycols. The second group consists of the enteric materials that are commonly esters<br>
of phthalic acid.<br>
A mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating may be<br>
carried out in a pan coater or in a fluidized bed or by compression coating.<br>
Parenteral delivery<br>
Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable<br>
organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving,<br>
wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a<br>
bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the<br>
compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using sterile water, or some<br>
other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.<br>
Rectal or vaginal delivery<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain,<br>
in addition to the active substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax. Compositions<br>
for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.<br>
Pulmonary Delivery<br>
Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the EPO-R agonist peptides (or derivatives<br>
thereof). The peptide (or derivative) is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses<br>
across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream [see, eg., Adjei, et al. (1990) Pharmaceutical<br>
Research 7:565-569; Adjei, et al. (1990) Int. J. Pharmaceutics 63:135-144 (leuprolide acetate); Braquet, et<br>
al. (1989) J. Cardiovascular Pharmacology 13(sup5): 143-146 (endothelin-1); Hubbard, et al. (1989)<br>
Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. III, pp. 206-212 (a1-antitrypsin); Smith, et al. (1989) J. Clin. Invest.<br>
84:1145-1146 (a-1-proteinase); Oswein, et al. (1990) "Aerosolization of Proteins", Proceedings of<br>
Symposium on Respiratory Drug Delivery II Keystone, Colorado (recombinant human growth hormone);<br>
Debs, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 140:3482-3488 (interferon-? and tumor necrosis factor a); and U.S. Pat<br>
No. 5,284,656 to Platz, et al. (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for<br>
pulmonary delivery of drugs for systemic effect is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,569 to Wong, et al.<br>
Contemplated for use in the practice of ±is invention are a wide range of mechanical devices<br>
designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered<br>
dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific<br>
examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent<br>
nebulizer (Mallinckrodt Inc., St Louis, MO); the Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products,<br>
Englewood, CO); the Ventolin metered dose inhaler (Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC); and the<br>
Spinhaler powder inhaler (Fisons Corp., Bedford, MA).<br>
All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of peptide (or<br>
derivative). Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the<br>
use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful<br>
in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other<br>
types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified peptides may also be prepared in different<br>
formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed.<br>
Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise<br>
peptide (or derivative) dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically active<br>
protein per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g., for<br>
protein stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a<br>
surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the peptide (or derivative) caused by<br>
atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol.<br>
Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided<br>
powder containing the peptide (or derivative) suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The<br>
propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a<br>
hydrochlorofiuorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations<br>
thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as<br>
a surfactant.<br>
Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry<br>
powder containing peptide (or derivative) and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol,<br>
sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to 90%<br>
by weight of the formulation. The peptide (or derivative) should most advantageously be prepared in<br>
particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5<br>
mm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.<br>
Nasal Delivery<br>
Nasal delivery of the EPO-R agonist peptides (or derivatives) is also contemplated. Nasal<br>
delivery allows the passage of the peptide to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic<br>
product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for<br>
nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyelodextran.<br>
Dosages<br>
For all of the peptide compounds, as further studies are conducted, information will emerge<br>
regarding appropriate dosage levels for treatment of various conditions in various patients, and the<br>
ordinary skilled worker, considering the therapeutic context, age, and general health of the recipient, will<br>
be able to ascertain proper dosing. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on<br>
the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment desired. Generally dosage levels of 0.001<br>
to 10 mg/kg of body weight daily are administered to mammals. Generally, for intravenous injection or<br>
infusion, dosage may be lower. The dosing schedule may vary, depending on the circulation half-life and<br>
the formulation used.<br>
The peptides of the present invention (or their derivatives) may be administered in conjunction<br>
with one or more additional active ingredients or pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention is next described by means of the following examples. However, the use of<br>
these and other examples anywhere in the specification is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope<br>
and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified form. Likewise, the invention is not limited to any<br>
particular preferred embodiments described herein. Indeed, many modifications and variations of the<br>
invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this specification, and can be made<br>
without departing from its spirit and scope. The invention is therefore to be limited only by the terms of<br>
the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which the claims are entitled.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide dimers by solid phase synthesis<br>
Step 1 - Synthesis of Cbz-TAP: A solution containing the commercially available diamine<br>
('TAP" from Aldrich Chemical Co.) (10g, 67.47mmol) in anhydrous DCM (100 ml) was cooled to 0°C.<br>
A solution of benzyl chloroformate (4.82ml, 33.7mmol) in anhydrous DCM (50ml) was added slowly<br>
through a dropping funnel over a period of 6-7 h. maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at<br>
0°C throughout, then allowed to warm to room temperature (~25°C). After a further 16h, the DCM was<br>
removed under vacuum and the residue partitioned between 3N HCl and ether. The aqueous layers were<br>
collected and neutralized with 50% aq. NaOH to pH 8-9 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl<br>
acetate layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, then concentrated under vacuum to provide the crude<br>
mono-Cbz-TAP (5g, about 50% yield). This compound was used for the next reaction without any<br>
further purification.<br><br>
Step 2 - Synthesis of Cbz-TAP-Boc: To a vigorously stirred suspension of the Cbz-TAP (5g,<br>
17.7mmol) in hexane (25ml) was added Boc2O (3.86g, 17.7mmol) and stirring continued at RT overnight.<br>
The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (25ml) and washed with 10% aq. citric acid (2X), water (2X)<br>
and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The<br>
crude product (yield 5g) was used directly in the next reaction.<br><br>
Step3 - Synthesis of Boc-TAP: The crude product from the previous reaction was dissolved in<br>
methanol (25ml) and hydrogenated in presence of 5% Pd on Carbon (5% w/W) under balloon pressure for<br>
16 hrs. The mixture was filtered, washed with methanol and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to provide<br>
the crude H-TAP-Boc product (yield 3.7g). The overall approximate yield of Boc-TAP after Steps 1-3<br>
was 44% (calculated based on the amount of Cbz-Cl used.)<br><br>
Step 4 - Synthesis of TentaGel-Linker: TentaGel bromide, (2.5 g, 0.48 mmol/g, from Rapp<br>
Polymere, Germany), phenolic linker (5 equivalent, and K2CO3 (5 equivalent) were heated in 20 mL of<br>
DMFto 70°C for 14h. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was washed (0.1 N HCl, water, ACN,<br>
DMF, MeOH) and dried to give an amber-colored resin.<br><br>
Step 5 - Synthesis of TentaGel-linker-TAP(Boc): 2.5 gms of the resin from above and H-TAP-<br>
Boc (1.5gms, 5eq.) and glacial AcOH (34 µl, 5 eq.) was taken in a mixture of 1:1 MeOH-THF and shaken<br>
overnight. A 1M solution of sodium cyanoborohydride (5eq) in THF was added to this and shaken for<br>
another 7hrs. The resin was filtered washed (DMF, THF, 0.1 N HCl, water, MeOH) and dried. A small<br>
amount of the resin was benzoylated with Bz-Cl and DIEA in DCM and cleaved with 70% TFA-DCM<br>
and checked by LCMS and HPLC.<br><br>
Step 6 - Synthesis of TentaGel-linker-TAP-Lys: The resin from above was treated with a<br>
activated solution of Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH (prepared from 5 eq. of ammo acid and 5 eq. of HATU<br>
dissolved at 0.5 M in DMF, followed by the addition of 10 eq. of DIEA) and allowed to gently shake 14h.<br>
The resin was washed (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and dried to yield the protected resin. Residual amine<br>
groups were capped by treating the resin with a solution of 10% acetic anhydride, 20% pyridine in DCM<br>
for 20 minutes, followed by washing as above. The Fmoc groups are removed by gently shaking the resin<br>
in 30% piperideine in DMF for 20 minutes, followed by washing (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and drying.<br><br>
Step 7-Synthesis of TentaGel-Linher-TAP-Lys(Peptide)2: The resin from above was<br>
subjected to repeated cycles of Fmoc-amino acid couplings with HBTU/HOBt activation and Fmoc<br>
removal with piperidine to build both peptide chains simultaneously. This was convenently carried out<br>
on a ABI 433 automated peptide synthesizer available from Applied Biosystems, Inc. After the final<br>
Fmoc removal, the terminal amine groups were acylated with acetic anhydride (10 eq.) and DEEA (20 eq.)<br>
in DMF for 20 minutes, follwed by washing as above.<br><br>
Step 8 - Cleavage from resin: The resin from above was suspended in a solution of TFA<br>
(82.5%), phenol (5%), erhanedithiol (2.5%), water (5%), and thioanisole (5%) for 3h at room temperature.<br>
Alternative cleavage cocktails such as TFA (95%), water (2.5%), and triisopropylsilane (2.5%) can also<br>
be used. The TFA solution was cooled to 5 °C and poured into Et2O to percipatate the peptide. Filtration<br>
and drying under reduced pressure gave the desired peptide. Purification via preparative HPLC with a<br>
C18 column afforded the pure peptide.<br><br>
Step 9 - Oxidation of peptides to form intramolecular disulfide bonds: The peptide dimer was<br>
dissolved in 20% DMSO/water (1 mg dry weight peptide/mL) and allowed to stand at room temperature<br>
for 36h. The peptide was purified by loading the reaction mixture onto a C18 HPLC column (Waters<br>
Delta-Pak C18, 15 micron particle size, 300 angstrom pore size, 40 mm x 200 mm length), followed by a<br>
linear ACN/water/0.01% TFA gradiant from 5 to 95% ACN over 40 minutes. Lyopholization of the<br>
fractions containing the desired peptide affords the product as a fluffy white solid.<br><br>
Step 10 - PEGylation of the terminal -NH2 group:<br>
PEGylation via a carbamate bond: The peptide dimer was mixed with 1.5 eq. (mole basis) of activated<br>
PEG species (mPEG-NPC from NOF Corp. Japan) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes<br>
4eq of DIEA was added to above solution. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature 14h, followed<br>
by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide was confirmed by<br>
MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange<br>
chromatography as outlined below.<br><br>
PEGylation via an amide bond: The pepiide dimer is mixed with 1.5 eq. (mole basis) of 1 eq. activated<br>
PEG species (PEG-SPA-NHS from Shearwater Corp, USA) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After<br>
5 minutes 10eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 2h,<br>
followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide was<br>
confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion<br>
exchange chromatography as outlined below.<br><br>
Step 11 - Ion exchange purification: Several exchange supports were surveyed for their ability<br>
to separate the above peptide-PEG conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in addition to their<br>
ability to retain the starting dimeric peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded into a 1 cm<br>
column, followed by conversion to the sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until elutant was<br>
pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than to the hydrogen form (eluted with either 0.1 N HC1 or 0.1 M<br>
HOAc until elutant matched load pH, ca. 5 column volumes), followed by washing with 25% ACN/water<br>
until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to conjugation or the peptidc-PEG conjugate was dissolved in 25%<br>
ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH adjusted to 
with 2-3 column volumes of 25% ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the peptide was released<br>
from the column by elution with 0.1 M NE4OAc in 25% ACN/water, again collecting 5 mL fractions.<br>
Analysis via IIPLC revealed which fractions contained the desired peptide. Analysis with an Evaporative<br>
Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD) indicated thai: when the peptide was retained on the column and was<br>
eluted with the NH4OAc solution (generally between fractions 4 and 10), no non-conjugated PEG was<br>
observed as a contaminant. When the peptide eluted in the initial wash buffer (generally the first 2<br>
fractions), no separation of desired PEG-conjugate and excess PEG was observed.<br>
The following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the pcptide-PEG conjugate,<br>
and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugates peptide:<br>

Example 2: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide dimers by fragment condensation<br>
Step 1- Synthesis of(Cbz)2-Lys: Lysinc is reacted under standard conditions with a solution of<br>
benzyl chloroformate to obtain lysine protected at its two amino groups with a Cbz group.<br><br>
Step 2 - Synthesis of Boc-TAP: Boc-TAP is syntheisized as described in Steps 1 through 3 of<br>
Example 1.<br>
Step 3 - Coupling of(Cbz)2-Lys and Boc-TAP: (Cbz)2-Lys and Boc-TAP are coupled under<br>
standard coupling conditions to obtain (Cbz)2-Lys-TAP-Boc.<br><br>
Step 4 - Lys-TAP-Boc: The crude product from the previous reaction is dissolved in methanol<br>
(25ml) and hydrogenated in presence of 5% Pd on Carbon (5% w/W) under balloon pressure for 16 hrs.<br>
The mixture is filtered, washed with methanol and the filtrate concentrated in vacua to provide the crude<br>
Lys-TAP-Boc product<br><br>
Step 5 - Synthesis of peptide monomers by fragment condensation: Four peptide fragments of<br>
the peptide monomer sequence are synthesized by standard techniques. These partially protected<br>
fragments are then subjected to two independent rounds of coupling. In the first round, the N-terminal<br>
half of the monomer is formed by coupling two of the peptide fragments, while the C-terminal half of the-<br>
monomer is formed by coupling the other two of the peptide fragments. In the second round of coupling,<br>
the N-tenninal and C-terminal halves are coupled to form the fully protected monomer. The monomer is<br>
then OBn-deprotected by standard techniques.<br><br>
Step 6 - Oxidation of peptide monomers to form intramolecular disulfide bonds: The OBn-<br>
deprotectcd condensed peptide monomers are then oxidized with under iodide to form intramolecular<br>
disulfide bonds between the Acm-protected cysteine residues of the monomers.<br><br>
Step 7- Coupling of Lys-TAP-Boc to oxidized OBn-deprotected monomers to form a peptide<br>
dinner: Lys-TAP-Boc is coupled to a two-fold molar excess of the oxidized OBn-deprotected monomers<br>
under standard conditions to form a peptide dimer. The peptide dimer is then deprotected under standard<br>
conditions.<br>
Step 8 - PEGylation of deprotected dimer: The deprotected peptide dimer is then PEGylated as<br>
described in Step 10 of Example 1.<br>
Step 9 - Ion exchange purification: The PEGylated peptide dimer is then purified as described<br>
in Step 11 of Example 1.<br>
Example 3: In vitro activity assays<br>
This example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the<br>
novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for<br>
these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding<br>
affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetic peptides that have been previously described.<br>
EPO-R agonist peptide dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1 or<br>
Example 2. The potency of these peptide dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro activity assays,<br>
including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a competitive binding assay, and a C/BFU-e assay.<br>
These four assays are described in further detail bslow.<br>
The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2.<br>
1. Reporter assay<br>
This assay is based upon a on a murine pre-B-cell line derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR<br>
fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the<br>
human EPO receptor to the intra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further<br>
transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric<br>
receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene,<br>
and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of<br>
EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity.<br>
The Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEMZF12 medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture<br>
of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # T1B-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 18 h before the assay,<br>
cells are starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1%<br>
WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 106 cells/mL are cultured in the<br>
presence of a known concentration of test peptide, or with EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN)<br>
as a positive control, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant).<br>
Serial dilutions of the test peptide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h<br>
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, Wi) is added to<br>
each well. Following a 5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount<br>
Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, Ill.). Light counts are plotted relative to test<br>
peptide concentration and analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50 [See Table 2: Reporter EC50].<br>
2. Proliferation assay<br>
This assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line, Baf3, transfected to express human EPO-R.<br>
Proliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The<br>
degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to<br>
the number of viable cells.<br>
The BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells arc cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco)<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEH1-3 supernatant (ATCC # TB-68). Cultured cells<br>
are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of 1x106 cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice<br>
with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and resuspended to a density of 1x106 cells/ml in DMEM/F12<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50µL aliquots (~50,000 cells) of the cell<br>
suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50uL aliquots of dilution series of test<br>
EPO mimetic peptides, or 50µL EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or Aranesp™<br>
(darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commerically available from Amgen) in DMEM/F12 media<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernalant 1) are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well<br>
volume of 100µL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test<br>
peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 810pM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated<br>
for 48h at 37°C. Next, 10µL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then<br>
allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then slopped by adding 10% SDS ÷ 0.014N HCl. The plates<br>
are then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelenght of 595nm is then<br>
measured by spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are<br>
constructed and the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a half-maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50 [See Table 2: Proliferation EC50].<br>
3. Competitive Binding Assay<br>
Competitive binding calculations are made Using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a<br>
function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R-binding<br>
peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non-radiative energy<br>
transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with<br>
the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially<br>
available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to<br>
the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R<br>
will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission.<br>
In more detail the method is as follows: Add 4uL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist<br>
peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2µL / well of<br>
receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15µL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads<br>
(Packard), 15µL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody ab179 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coatcd<br>
acceptor beads (protein A will bind to the ab179 antibody; Packard), 112.5µL of a 1:6.6 dilution of<br>
recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein which contains the abl79 target epitope) and 607.5µL of<br>
Alphaquest buffer (40mM HEPES, pH 7.4; lmM MgCl2; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix.<br>
Add 2µL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-binding peptide tracer, AF33068 (30nM final concentration).<br>
AF33068, an EPO-R binding peptide (see Table 3 "Reporter EC50 (pM)"), is made according to the<br>
methods described in Example 1.<br><br>
Centrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight<br>
at room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light<br>
emission vs concentration of peptide and analyse with Graph Pad or Excel.<br>
The concentration of test peptide (hat resuits in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that<br>
observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50 [See Table 2: AQ IC50].<br>
4. C/BFU-e Assay<br>
EPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red<br>
blood cell presursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and<br>
differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotent stem cells.<br>
For this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in EMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to<br>
mcthylcellulose to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylcellulose and peptide mixture is then<br>
vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100,000 cells/mL) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells<br>
(Poietics/Cambrex) are thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of 1mg/ml DNAse (Stem<br>
Cells) in a 50mL tube. Next, 40-50 mL MDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added<br>
drop by drop along the side of the 50mL tube for the first 10mL, and then the remaining volume of<br>
medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and<br>
the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in 1ml of 2MDM medium<br>
and me cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (10µL aliquot of cell suspension on slide,<br>
and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/ml). The cells are then diluted in IMDM medium to<br>
a cell density of 15,000 cells/mL A 100µL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose<br>
plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is<br>
vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate 1mL using blunt-end needle.<br>
Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand).<br>
Incubate the plated mixtures at 37°C under 5% CO2 in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the<br>
presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of<br>
100X). The concentration of test peptidc at which the numer of formed colonies is 90% of maximum,<br>
relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 2: C/EFU-e<br>
EC90].<br>
5. Radioligand Competitive Binding Assay<br>
An alternative radioligand competition binding assay can also be used to measure IC50 values of peptides<br>
in this invention. This assay measures binding of 125I-EPO to EPOr. The assay is preferably performed<br>
according to the following exemplary protocol:<br>
A. Materials<br>
B. Determination of appropriate receptor concentration.<br>
One 50 µg vial of lyophilized recombinant EPOr extracellular domain fused to the Fc portion of<br>
human IgG1 is reconstituted in 1 mL of assay buffer. To determine the correct amount of receptor to use<br>
in the assay, 100 µL serial dilutions of this receptor preparation are combined with approximately 20,000<br>
cpm in 200 µL of iodinated recombinant human Erythropoietin (125I-EPO) in 12 x 75 mm polypropylene<br>
test tubes. Tubes are capped and mixed gently at 4 °C overnight on a LabQuake rotating shaker.<br>
The next day, 50 µL of a 50 % slurry of Protein-G Sepharose is added to each tube. Tubes are<br>
then incubated for 2 hours at 4 °C, mixing gently. The tubes are then centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 RPM<br>
(3297 x G)to pellet the protein-G sepharose. The supernatants are carefully removed and discarded. After<br>
washing 3 times with 1 mL of 4 °C assay buffer, the pellets are counted in a Wallac Wizard gamma<br>
counter. Results are then analyzed and the dilution required to reach 50 % of the maximum binding value<br>
is calculated.<br>
C. IC50 Determination for peptide<br>
To determine the IC50 of AF37702, 100 µL serial dilutions of the peptide are combined with 100<br>
µL of recombinant erythropoietin receptor (100 pg/tube) in 12 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes. Then<br>
100 µL of iodinated recombinant human Erytbropoietin (125I-EPO) is added to each tube and the tubes are<br>
capped and mixed gently at 4°C overnight.<br>
The next day, bound I25I-EPO is quantitared as described above. The results are analyzed and the<br>
IC50 value calculated using Graphpad Prism version 4.0, from GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA).<br>
The assay is repeated two or more times for each peptide tested, for a total of 3 or more replicate IC50<br>
determinations.<br>
Example 4: In vivo activity assays<br>
This example describes various in vivo assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide dimers are prepared<br>
according to the methods provided in Example 1 or Example 2. The in vivo activity of these peptide<br>
monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythemic exhypoxic mouse<br>
bioassay and a rcticulocyte assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.<br>
1. Polycythemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay<br>
Test peptides are assayed for in vivo activity in the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay<br>
adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191: 1065-1067. This assay<br>
examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce<br>
new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of<br>
radiolabelcd iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells.<br>
BDF1 mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are<br>
determined for all animals, and low weight animals (
successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consista<br>
of 18 hr at 0.40±0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning the mice<br>
are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing.<br>
Test peptides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS + 0.1% BSA vehicle<br>
(PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected<br>
with 1% DMSO. Each dose group containa 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck)<br>
with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample.<br>
Forty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal<br>
injection of 0.2 ml of Fe59 (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 µCuries/mouse. Mouse body<br>
weights are determined 24hr after Fe59 administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe59<br>
administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined<br>
(heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe59 incorporation<br>
using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less<br>
than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit<br>
values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.<br>
Results are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of<br>
radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples from each group is calculated.<br>
2. Reticulocyte Assay<br>
Normal BDF1 mice are dosed (0.5 mL, injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with<br>
either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, mice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally)<br>
with iron dextran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO2 and bled by cardiac<br>
puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each blood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining<br>
and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits are manually determined. The corrected<br>
percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula:<br>
% RETICCORRECTED = % RETICOBSERVED X (HematocritINDIVIDUAL / HematocritNORMAL)<br>
3. Hematological Assay<br>
Normal CD1 mice are dosed with four weeldy bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive<br>
control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg,<br>
are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are<br>
5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the<br>
remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weeldy body weights are recorded.<br>
The dosed mice are mice arc fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and terminal<br>
blood samples are collected via cardiac or abdominal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice)<br>
and on Days 15 and 29 (4 mice/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutainer® brand tubes.<br>
Preferred anticoagulant is ethylenediarninetetraacetic acid (EDTA).<br>
Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as<br>
hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrooyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analysers<br>
well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the<br>
amino acid sequence (AcG)GLYACHMGPlT(1-nal)VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO: 1)<br>
Step 1 - Synthesis of peptide monomers: Peptide monomers are synthesized using standard<br>
Fmoc chemistry on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer, using TG-RAM resin (0.18 mmol/g Rapp •<br>
Polymere, Germany). For the synthesis of peptide monomers with an amidated carboxy terminus, the<br>
fully assembled peptide is cleaved from the resin with 82.5% TFA, 5% water, 6.25% anisole, 6.25%<br>
ethanedithiol. The deprotected product is filtered from the Tesin and precipitated with diethyl ether. After<br>
thorough drying, the product is purified by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography<br>
with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacelic acid. The structure of the peptide is<br>
confirmed by electospray mass spectromelry. The peptide is dissolved in a 1:1 solution of DMSO:water<br>
at a concentration of 1mg/mL to affect disulfide formation. The product is purified by C18 reverse phase<br>
high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The peptide monomers may be illustrated as follows:<br><br>
Step 2 - Synthesis of the trifunctional linker: To a solution of diethyl iminoacetate (10.0g, 52.8<br>
mmol) and Boc-beta-a]aninc (10.0g, 52.8 mmol) in 100 mL of DCM was added diisopropylcarbodiimide<br>
(8.0 mL, 51.1 mmol) over 10 minutes at room temperture. The reaction mixture warmed to ~10 degrees<br>
during the addition, then cooled back to room temperature over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was<br>
allowed to stir overnight and the precepitated diiscpropylurea was filtered off. The solvent was removed<br>
under reduced pressure to afford a gum, and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and again filtered to<br>
remove the additional precipatated urea. The organic phase was placed into a separtory funnel, washed<br>
(sat. NaHCO3, brine, 0.5 N HCl, brine), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure<br>
to afford the diester product as a colorless oil. The diester was taken up in a 1:1 mixture of MeOH:THF<br>
(100 mL) and to this was added water (25 mL), and then NaOH (5g, 125 mmol). The pH was measured<br>
to be &gt;10. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then acidified to pH 1 with<br>
6N HCl. The aq. Phase was staurated with NaCl and extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate. The combined<br>
organic phase was washed (brine), dried (MgSO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a<br>
white semi-solid. The solid was dissolved in 50 mL of DCM and to this was added 300 mL hexane to<br>
create a white slurry. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford the diacid as a white<br>
solid (14.7 g, 91.5% yield for 2 steps). To a solution of the diacid (1g, 3.29 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF was<br>
added N-hydroxysuccinimide (770 mg, 6.69 mmol) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (1.00 mL, 6.38 mmol)<br>
and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (3 mg, 0.02 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and the<br>
solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and filtered to remove<br>
the precpitated urea. The organic phase was placed into a separiory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCO3, brine,<br>
0.5 N HCl, brine), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the di-NHS<br>
ester product as a white solid (1.12g, 68% yield).<br><br>
Step 3 - Coupling of the trifunctional linker to the peptide monomers: For coupling to the<br>
linker, 2 eq peptide is mixed with 1 eq of trifunctional linker in dry DMF to give clear solution, 5eq of<br>
DIEA is added after 2 minutes. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 14h. The solvent is<br>
removed under reduced pressure and the crude product is dissolved in S0% TFA in DCM for 30min to<br>
remove the Boc group, followed by purification with, C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of the dimer<br>
is confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. This coupling reaction attaches the linker to the nitrogen<br>
atom of the e-amino group of the lysine residue of each monomer.<br>
Step 4 -PEGylation of the peptide dimer:<br>
PEGylation via a carbamate bond: The peptidc dimer is mixed with an equal amount (mole basis) of<br>
activated PEG species (mPEG-NPC from NOF Corp. Japan) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After<br>
5 minutes 4eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 14h,<br>
followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated peptide is confirmed<br>
by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange<br>
chromalography as outlined below.<br><br>
PEGylation via an amide bond: The peptide, dimer is mixed with an equal amount (mole basis) of<br>
activated PEG species (PEG-SPA-NHS from Shearwater Corp, USA) in dry DMF to afford a clear<br>
solution. After 5 minutes 10eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient<br>
temperature 2h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated<br>
peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via<br>
cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below.<br><br>
Step 5: - Ion exchange purification of peptides: Several exchange supports were surveyed for<br>
their ability to separate the above peptide-PEG conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in<br>
addition to their ability to retain the starting dimeric peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded<br>
into a 1 cm column, followed by conversion to the sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until<br>
elutant was pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than to the hydrogen form (eluted with either 0.1 N HCl<br>
or 0.1 M HOAc until elutant matched load pH5 ca. 5 column volumes), followed by washing with 25%<br>
ACN/water until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to conjugation or the peptide-PEG conjugate was<br>
dissolved in 25% ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH adjusted to 
column. After wasliing with 2-3 column volumes of 25% ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the<br>
peptide was released from the column by elution with 0.3 M NH4OAc in 25% ACN/waler, again<br>
collecting 5 mL fractions. Analysis via HPLC revealed which fractions contained the desired peptide.<br>
Analysis with an Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD) indicated thai when the peptide was<br>
retained on the column and was eluted with the NH4OAc solution (generally between fractions 4 and 10),<br>
no non-conjugated PEG was observed as a contaminant. When the peptide eluted in the initial wash<br>
buffer (generally the first 2 fractions), no separation of desired PEG-conjugate and excess PEG was<br>
observed.<br>
The following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the peptide-PEG conjugate,<br>
and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugates peptide:<br>

Example 7: In vitro activity assays<br>
This example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the<br>
novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for<br>
these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding<br>
affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetric peptides that have been previously described.<br>
EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are prepared according to the methods provided in<br>
Example 1 or Example 2. The potency of these peptide dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro<br>
activity assays, including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a competitive binding assay, and a<br>
C/BFU-e assay. These four assays are described in further detail below.<br>
The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2.<br>
1. Reporter assay<br>
This assay is based upon a on a murhie pre-B-cell lin derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR<br>
fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the<br>
human EPO receptor to the infra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further<br>
transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric<br>
receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene,<br>
and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate lucifenn. Thus, the level of<br>
EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitatcd via measurement of luciferase activity.<br>
The BaO/EpoR/GCSER fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% feial bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture<br>
of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # TIB-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 18 h before the assay,<br>
cells are starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1%<br>
WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented<br>
with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 106 cells/mL are cultured in the presence of a known<br>
concentration of test peptidc, or with EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as a positive control,<br>
in DMEM/FI2 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). Serial dilutions of the<br>
test peplide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h at 37°C in a 5% CO2<br>
atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, Wi) is added to each well. Following a<br>
5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount Luminometer (Packard<br>
Instrument Co., Downers Grove, I11.). Light counts a.re plotted relative to test peptide concentration and<br>
analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-maximal<br>
emission of light is recorded as the EC50<br>
2. Proliferation assay<br>
This assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line, Baf3, transfecied to express human EPO-R.<br>
Proliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The<br>
degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to<br>
the number of viable cells.<br>
The BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells are cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco)<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEHI-3 supernatant (ATCC # TIB-68). Cultured cells<br>
are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of 1x106 cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice<br>
with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and resuspended to a density of 1x106 cells/ml in DMEM/F12<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50µL aliquots (~50,000 cells) of the cell<br>
suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50µL aliquots of dilution series of test<br>
EPO mimetic peptides, or 50µL EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or Aranesp™<br>
(darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commerically available from Amgen) in DMEM/F12 media<br>
supplemented with 10% PBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant 1) are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well<br>
volume of 100µL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test<br>
peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 810pM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated for<br>
4Sh at 37°C. Next, 10µL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then<br>
allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then stopped by adding 10% SDS + 0.0 1N HCl. The plates are<br>
then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelenght of 595nm is then measured by<br>
spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are constructed and<br>
the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that results in a half-<br>
maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50.<br>
3. Competitive Binding Assay<br>
Competitive binding calculations are made using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a<br>
function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R-binding<br>
peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non-radiative energy<br>
transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with<br>
the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially<br>
available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to<br>
the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R<br>
will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission.<br>
In more detail the method is as follows: Add 4µL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist<br>
peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2µL / well of<br>
receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15µL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads<br>
(Packard), 15µL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody ab179 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coated<br>
acceptor beads (proiein A will bind to the abl79 antibody; Packard), 112.5µL of a 1:6.6 dilution of<br>
recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein which contains the ab179 target epitope) and 607.5µL of<br>
Alphaquest buffer (40mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 1mM MgCl2; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix. Add<br>
2µL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-bmding peptide tracer, AF33068 (30nM final concentration).<br>
AF33068, an EPO-R binding peptide (see Table 3 "Reporter EC50 (pM)"), is made according to the<br>
methods described in Example 1.<br><br>
Centrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight at<br>
room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light<br>
emission vs concentration of peptide and analyse with Graph Pad or Excel.<br>
The concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that<br>
observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50.<br>
4. C/BFU-e Assay<br>
EPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red<br>
blood cell presursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and<br>
differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotcnt stem cells.<br>
For this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to<br>
methylcellulosc to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylccllulose and peptide mixture is then<br>
vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100,000 cells/mL) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells<br>
(Poietics/Cambrex) are thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of 1mg/ml DNAse (Stem<br>
Cells) in a 50mL tube. Next, 40-50 mL IMDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added<br>
drop by drop along the side of the 50mL tube for the first 10mL, and then the remaining volume of<br>
medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and<br>
the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in 1ml of IMDM medium<br>
and the cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (10µL aliquot of cell suspension on slide,<br>
and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/ml). The cells arc then diluted in IMDM medium to a<br>
cell density of 15,000 cells/mL. A 100µL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose<br>
plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is<br>
vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate 1mL using blunt-end needle.<br>
Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand).<br>
Incubate the plated mixtures at 37°C under 5% CO2 in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the<br>
presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of .<br>
100X). The concentration of test peptide at which the numer of formed colonies is 90% of maximum,<br>
relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 2: C/BFU-e<br>
EC90].<br>
Example 8: In vivo activity assays<br>
This example describes various in vivo assays thai are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are<br>
prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1. The in vivo activity of these peptide<br>
monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythenic exhypoxic mouse<br>
bioassay and a reticulocyte assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.<br>
1. Polycyihemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay<br>
Test peptides are assayed for in viva activity in the polycyihemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay<br>
adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191: 1065-1067. This assay<br>
examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce<br>
new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of<br>
radiolabeled iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells.<br>
BDFl mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are<br>
determined for all animals, and low weight animals (
successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consista<br>
of 18 hr at 0.40±0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning the mice<br>
are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing.<br>
Test peplides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS + 0.1% BSA vehicle<br>
(PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected<br>
with 1% DMSO. Each dose group conlaina 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck)<br>
with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample.<br>
Forty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal<br>
injection of 0.2 ml of Fe59 (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 µCuries/mouse. Mouse body<br>
weights are determined 24hr after Fe59 administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe59<br>
administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined<br>
(heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe59 incorporation<br>
using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less<br>
than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit<br>
values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.<br>
Results are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of<br>
radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples from each group is calculated.<br>
2. Reticulocyte Assay<br>
Normal BDF1 mice are dosed (0.5 mL, injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with<br>
either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, mice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally)<br>
with iron dextran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO2 and bled by cardiac<br>
puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each blood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining<br>
and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits are manually determined. The corrected<br>
percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula:<br>
% RETICcorrected = % RFTICOBSERVED X (HematocritINDIVIDUAL / HematocritNORMAL)<br>
3. Hematological Assay<br>
Normal CD.1 mice are dosed with four weekly bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive<br>
control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg,<br>
are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are<br>
5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the<br>
remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weekly body weights are recorded.<br>
The dosed mice are mice are fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isofiurane and terminal<br>
blood samples are collected via cardiac or abdom:.nal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice)<br>
and on Days 15 and 29 (4 micc/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutainer® brand tubes.<br>
Preferred anticoagulant is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).<br>
Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as<br>
hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrocyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analysers<br>
well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).<br>
Example 9: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptide homodimers of peptide monomers having the<br>
amino acid sequence (AcG)GLYACIIMGPIT(l-naI)VCQPLRK (SEQ ID NO: 1)<br>
Step 1 - Synthesis of peptide monomers: Peptide monomers are synthesized using standard<br>
Fmoc chemistry on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer, using TG-RAM resin (0.18 mmol/g Rapp<br>
Polymere, Germany). For the synthesis of peptide monomers with an amidated carboxy terminus, the<br>
fully assembled peptide is cleaved from the resin with 82.5% TFA, 5% water, 6.25% anisole, 6.25%<br>
ethanedithiol. The deprolected product is filtered from the resin and precipitated with diethyl ether. After <br>
thorough drying the product is purified by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography<br>
with a gradient of acelonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The structure of the peptide is<br>
confirmed by electospray mass spectrometry. The peptide monomers may be illustrated as follows:<br>
(AcG)GLYACHMGPIT(l-nal)VCQPLRK-NH2<br>
Step 2 - Synthesis of the triftinctional linker:<br>
To a solution of diethyl iminoacetate (10.0g, 52.8 mmol) and Boc-beta-alanine (10.0g, 52.8<br>
mmol) in 100 mL of DCM was added diisopropylcarbodiimide (8.0 mL, 51.1 mmol) over 10 minutes at<br>
room temperture. The reaction mixture warmed Lo ~10 degrees during the addition, then cooled back to<br>
room temperature over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight and the<br>
precipitated diisopropylurea was filtered off. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford<br>
a gum, and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and again filtered to remove the additional precipatated<br>
urea. The organic phase was placed into a sepatory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCO3, brine, 0.5 N HCl.<br>
brine), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the diester product as a<br>
colorless oil. The diester was taken up in a 1:1 mixture of MeOH:THF (100 mL) and to this was added<br>
water (25 mL), and then NaOH (5g, 125 mmol), The pH was measured to be &gt;10. The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then acidified to pH 1 with 
saturated with NaCl and extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase was washed<br>
(brine), dried (MgSO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a white semi-solid. The solid<br>
was dissolved in 50 mL of DCM and to this was added 300 mL hexane to creaie a white slurry. The<br>
solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford the diacid as a white solid (14.7 g, 91.5% yield for<br>
2 steps). To a solution of the diacid (Ig, 3.29 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF was added N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
(770 mg, 6.69 mmol) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (1.00 mL, 6.38 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine<br>
(3 mg, 0.02 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight and the solvent removed under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and filtered to remove the precipitated urea. The<br>
organic phase was placed into a separtory funnel, washed (sat. NaHCO3, brine. 0.5 N HCl, brine), dried<br>
(MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the di-NHS ester product as a white<br>
solid (1.12g, 68% yield).<br><br>
Step 3 - Coupling of the trifunctional linker to the peptide monomers:<br>
For coupling to the linker, 2 eq peptide is mixed with 1 eq of trifunctional linker in dry DMF to<br>
give a clear solution, and 5eq of DIEA is added after 2 minutes. The mixture is stirred at ambient<br>
temperature for 14h. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the crude product is dissolved in<br>
80% TFA in DCM for 30min to remove the Boc: group, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase<br>
HPLC. The structure of the dimer is confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. This coupling<br>
reaction attaches the linker to the nitrogen atom of the s-amino group of the lysine residue of each<br>
monomer. <br>
Step 4 - Synthesis of PEG moiety comprising two linear PEGS chains linked by Lysine<br>
mPEG2-Lysinol-NPC<br>
Lysinol, which may be obtained commercially, is treated with an excess of mPEG2-NPC to<br>
obtain MPEG2-IysinoI, which is then reacted with NPC to form mPEG2-lysinol-NPC.<br>
mPEG2-Lys-NHS<br>
This product may be obtained commercially, for example, from the Molecular Engineering<br>
catalog (2003) of Nektar Therapeutics (490 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806), item no.<br>
2Z3X0T01.<br>
Step 5 - PEGylation of the peptide dimer:<br>
PEGylation via a carbamate bond:<br>
The peptidc dimer and the PEG species (mPEG2-Lysmol-NPC) are mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio in<br>
dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes 4eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The<br>
mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 14h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC.<br>
The structure of PEGylated peptide is confirmed by MALD1 mass. The purified peptide was also<br>
subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below.<br><br>
PEGylation via an amide bond:<br>
The peptide dimer and PEG species (mPEG2-Lys-NHS from Shearwater Corp, USA) are mixed<br>
in a 1:2 molar ratio in dry DMF to afford a clear solution. After 5 minutes 10eq of DIEA is added to<br>
above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature 2h, followed by purification with C18<br>
reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylatcd peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified<br>
peptide was also subjected to purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below.<br><br>
Step 6: - Ion exchange purification of peptides: Several exchange supports were surveyed for<br>
their ability to separate the above peptide-PEG conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in<br>
addition to their ability to retain the starting dimeric peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded<br>
into a 1 cm column, followed by conversion to the sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until<br>
elutant was pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than to the hydrogen form (eluted with either 0.1 N HCl<br>
or 0.1 M HOAc until elutant matched load pH, ca. 5 column volumes), followed by washing with 25%<br>
ACN/water until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to conjugation or the peptide-PEG conjugate was<br>
dissolved in 25% ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH adjusted to 
column. After washing with 2-3 column volumes of 25% ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the<br>
peptide was released from the column by elution with 0.1 M NH4OAc in 25% ACN/water. again<br>
collecting 5 rnL fractions. Analysis via HPLC revealed which fractions contained the desired peptide.<br>
Analysis with an Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD) indicated that when the peptide was<br>
retained on the column and was eluted with the NH4OAc solution (generally between fractions 4 and 10),<br>
no non-conjugated PEG was observed as a contaminant. When the peptide eluted in the initial wash<br>
buffer (generally the first 2 fractions), no separation of desired PEG-conjugatc and excess PEG was<br>
observed.<br>
The following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the peptide-PEG conjugate,<br>
and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugates peptide:<br>

This example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the<br>
novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for<br>
these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding<br>
affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetic peptides that have been previously described.<br>
EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and diners are prepared according to the methods provided in<br>
Example 1 or Example 2. The potency of these peptide dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro<br>
activity assays, including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a competitive binding assay, and a<br>
C/BFU-e assay. These four assays are described in further detail below.<br>
The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2.<br>
1. Reporter assay<br>
This assay is based upon a on a murme p.:e-B-ce!l lin derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR<br>
fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the<br>
human EPO receptor to the intra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further<br>
transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric<br>
receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene,<br>
and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of<br>
EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity.<br>
The Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% fetal bovine serum (PBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture<br>
of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # TJB-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 18 h before the assay,<br>
cells arc starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1%<br>
WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 10° cells/mL arc cultured in the<br>
presence of a known concentration of test peptide, or with EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN)<br>
as a positive control, in DMEMZF12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant).<br>
Serial dilutions of the test peptide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h<br>
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, Wi) is added to<br>
each well. Following a 5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount<br>
Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, Ill.). Light counts are plotted relative to test<br>
peptide concentration and analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50<br>
2. Proliferation assay<br>
This assay is based upon a murine prc-B-cell line, Bafi, transfected to express human EPO-R.<br>
Proliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The<br>
degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to<br>
the number of viable cells.<br>
The BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells are cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco)<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEHI-3 supernatant (ATCC # TIB-68). Cultured cells<br>
are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of 1x106 cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice<br>
with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and rcsuspended io a density of 1x106 cells/ml in DMEM/F12<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50µL aliquots (-50,000 cells) of the cell<br>
suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50µL aliquots of dilution series of test<br>
EPO mimetic peptides, or 50µL EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or Aranesp™<br>
(darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commercially available from Amgen) in DMEM/F12 media<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supema:ant I) are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well<br>
volume of 100µL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test<br>
peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 810pM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated<br>
for 48h at 37°C. Next, 10µL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then<br>
allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then stopped by adding 10% SDS + 0.01N HCl. The plates<br>
are then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 595nm is then<br>
measured by spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are<br>
constructed and the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a half-maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50.<br>
3. Competitive Binding Assay<br>
Competitive binding calculations are made using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a<br>
function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R-binding<br>
peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non-radiative energy<br>
transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with<br>
the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially<br>
available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to<br>
the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R<br>
will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission.<br>
In more detail the method is as follows: Add 4µL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist<br>
peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2µL / well of<br>
receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15µL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads<br>
(Packard), 15µL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody abl79 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coated<br>
acceptor beads (protein A will bind to the abl79 antibody; Packard), 112.5µL of a 1:6.6 dilution of<br>
recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein v/hich contains the ab 179 target eptiope) and 607.5µL of<br>
Alphaquest buffer (40mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 1mM MgCl2; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix.<br>
Add 2µL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-bindi.ig peptide tracer, AF33068 (30nM final concentration).<br>
AF33068, an EPO-R binding peptide (see Table 3 "Reporter EC50 (pM)"), is made according to the<br>
methods described in Example 1.<br><br>
Centrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight<br>
at room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light<br>
emission vs concentration of peptide and analyse with Graph Pad or Excel.<br>
The concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that<br>
observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50.<br>
4. C/BFU-e Assay<br>
EPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red<br>
blood cell precursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and<br>
differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotent stem cells.<br>
For this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in 1MDM medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to<br>
methylcellulose to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylcellulose and peptide mixture is then<br>
vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100.000 cells/ml.) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells<br>
(Poictics/Cambrex) arc thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of lmg/ml DNAse (Stem<br>
Cells) in a 50mL tube. Next, 40-50 mL TMDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added<br>
drop by drop along the side of the 50mL tube for the first 10mL, and then the remaining volume of<br>
medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and<br>
the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in 1ml of IMDM medium<br>
and the cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (10µL aliquot of cell suspension on slide,<br>
and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/nil). The cells are then diluted in IMDM medium to<br>
a cell density of 15,000 cells/mL. A 100µL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose<br>
plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is<br>
vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate 1mL using blunt-end needle.<br>
Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand).<br>
Incubate the plated mixtures at 37°C under 5% CO2 in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the<br>
presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of<br>
100X). The concentration of test peptide at which the number of formed colonies is 90% of maximum,<br>
relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 2: C/BFU-e<br>
EC90].<br>
Example 12: In vivo activity assays<br>
This example describes various in vivo assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are<br>
prepared according to the methods provided ir. Example 1. The in vivo activity of these peptide<br>
monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythemic exhypoxie mouse<br>
bioassay and a reticulocy te assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.<br>
1. Polycythemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay<br>
Test peptides are assayed for in vivo activity in the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay<br>
adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191: 1065-1067. This assay<br>
examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce<br>
new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of<br>
radiolabeled iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells.<br>
BDF1 mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are<br>
determined for all animals, and low weight animals (
successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consists<br>
of 18 hr at 0.40±0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning the mice<br>
are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing.<br>
Test peptides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS ÷ 0.1% BSA vehicle<br>
(PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected<br>
with 1% DMSO. Each dose group contains 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck)<br>
with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample.<br>
Forty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal<br>
injection of 0.2 ml of Fe59 (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 µCuries/mouse. Mouse body<br>
weights are determined 24hr after Fe59 administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe59<br>
administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined<br>
(heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe59 incorporation<br>
using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less<br>
than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit<br>
values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.<br>
Results are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of<br>
radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples from each group is calculated.<br>
2. Reticulocyte Assay<br>
Normal BDF1 mice are dosed (0.5 mL. injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with<br>
either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, nice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally)<br>
with iron dexrran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO2 and bled by cardiac<br>
puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each tlood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining<br>
and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits arc manually determined. The corrected<br>
percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula:<br>
% RETICCORRECTED = % RETICobserved X (HematocritINDIVIDUAL / HematocritNORMAL)<br>
3. Hematological Assay<br>
Normal CD1 mice are dosed with four weekly bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive<br>
control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg,<br>
are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are<br>
5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the<br>
remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weekly body weights are recorded.<br>
The dosed mice are mice are fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and terminal<br>
blood samples arc collected via cardiac or abdominal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice)<br>
and on Days 15 and 29 (4 micc/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutainer® brand tubes.<br>
Preferred anticoagulant is ethylencdiaminetetraaceiic acid (EDTA).<br>
Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as<br>
hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrocyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analyzers<br>
well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).<br>
