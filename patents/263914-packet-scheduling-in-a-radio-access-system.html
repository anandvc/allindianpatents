				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to packet scheduling in a radio access system, and more<br>
particularly, though not necessarily, to packet scheduling for a high speed downlink shared<br>
channel of a wideband code division multiple access system.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Compared to second-generation mobile communication systems, one of the most<br>
important aspects of third-generation mobile systems is enhanced packet-data access. The<br>
ITU standard known as wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), Release 99,<br>
provides for data rates of 384 kbit/s for wide area coverage and up to 2 Mbit/s for hot-spot<br>
areas, which is sufficient for most existing packet-data applications. However, as the use<br>
of packet data services increases and new services are introduced, greater capacity will be<br>
required. WCDMA Release 5 extends the specification with, among other things, a new<br>
downlink transport channel that enhances support for interactive and background services,<br>
and, to some extent, streaming services, yielding a considerable increase in capacity<br>
compared to Release 99. Release 5 also significantly reduces delay and provides peak<br>
data rates of up to 14 Mbit/s. This enhancement, which commonly goes under the<br>
abbreviation, HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access), is the first step in evolving<br>
WCDMA to provide even more outstanding performance.<br>
An important objective of the HSDPA design has been to retain the functional split<br>
introduced in Release 99 between layers and nodes. Minimal architectural changes should<br>
ensure a smooth upgrade and enable operation in environments where not every cell of the<br>
network supports the new functionality. Nonetheless, given that the key features are rapid<br>
adaptation to changes in the radio environment and fast retransmission of data, it follows<br>
that the corresponding functionality should be placed as close to the air interface as<br>
possible. The introduction of HSDPA therefore affects primarily the radio base station<br>
(RBS, also called Node B), in particular through the addition of a new medium access<br>
control sub-layer (MAC-hs). The architecture retains the radio network controller (RNC)<br>
functionality of Release 99. By switching channels in the RNC, the system can easily<br>
2<br><br>
handle terminal movement from a cell that supports HSDPA to one that does not. That is,<br>
when switching a terminal from the high-speed downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH) to a<br>
dedicated channel (DCH) in a non-enhanced cell, the system ensures uninterrupted<br>
service, albeit at a lower data rate. Conversely, when a terminal enters a cell that supports<br>
HSDPA, the system can switch the terminal from a dedicated channel to the HS-DSCH.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates schematically a WCDMA system with MAC-hs functionality.<br>
The scheduler, which is part of the MAC-hs in the Node B, is a key element that<br>
determines the overall behavior of the system. For each transmission time interval (TTI)<br>
on the HS-DSCH, the scheduler determines which terminal (or terminals) the HS-DSCH<br>
should be transmitted to, and, in collaboration with the link adaptation mechanism, at what<br>
data rate. A significant increase in capacity can be obtained if, instead of allocating radio<br>
resources sequentially (i.e. so-called round-robin scheduling), the scheduler employs<br>
channel dependent scheduling: that is, the scheduler prioritises transmissions to terminals<br>
having favourable instantaneous channel conditions. By prioritizing these terminals, the<br>
network experiences mostly good conditions. The effect is greater diversity at the system<br>
level, hence the term "multi-user diversity". As load in the cell increases, the number of<br>
terminals queued for scheduling increases. This in turn raises the probability of being able<br>
to schedule transmissions to terminals with good channel quality.<br>
In considering and comparing scheduling algorithms, it is necessary to distinguish<br>
between two kinds of variations in service quality:<br>
•	rapid variations in service quality; and<br>
•	long-term variations in service quality.<br>
Rapid variations in service quality are due, for example, to multipath fading and variations<br>
in the interference level. For many packet-data applications, relatively large short-term<br>
variations in service quality are acceptable or go unnoticed. Long-term variations in<br>
service quality are due, for example, to changes in the distance between the terminal and<br>
the Node B. Such long-term variations should generally be minimised.<br>
A practical scheduling strategy exploits the short-term variations while maintaining some<br>
degree of long-term fairness between users. In principle, system throughput decreases the<br>
more fairness is enforced. Therefore, a trade-off must be reached. Typically, the higher<br>
the system load, the greater the discrepancies between different scheduling strategies.<br>
3<br><br>
Channel-dependent schedulers must estimate the instantaneous radio conditions of the<br>
terminal. Therefore, each terminal that uses high-speed services transmits regular channel<br>
quality reports to the Node B via the HS-DPCCH (high speed dedicated physical control<br>
channel, an uplink control channel). The scheduler might also use other information<br>
available in the Node B to assess terminal radio conditions.<br>
HSDPA includes a new frame for transporting MAC-d PDUs from the RNC to the Node<br>
B. The UTRAN user-plane protocol termination points of HSDPA are illustrated in<br>
Figure 2. The user-plane "flow" through the different layers (of Figure 2) is illustrated in<br>
Figure 3. RLC SDU's (, i.e. higher layer data units - typically IP packets) are segmented<br>
into RLC PDUs - RLC (and possibly MAC-d) headers are added in the RNC. The<br>
RLC/MAC-d PDUs are carried in Iub user-plane frames (not illustrated in the figure) to<br>
the Node B, where the MAC-d PDUs (MAC-hs SDUs) are queued in MAC-hs buffers<br>
(one or more buffers or queues are provided for each user terminal) for scheduled<br>
transmission over the air. [The Transport Network Layer (TNL) can be realised either<br>
with ATM or IP.]<br>
Depending on the link quality and the amount of scheduled resources, different numbers<br>
of MAC-hs SDUs fit into a given transport block. The HSDPA scheduler in the Node B<br>
can be designed with many different objectives in mind. For example, a round-robin<br>
scheduler assigns equal resources to all active users without taking into account any<br>
differences in link quality, while a Maximum C/I scheduler always chooses the user with<br>
the best link quality. A Maximum-C/I scheduler delivers maximum cell throughput, but<br>
this scheduler can be very unfair to badly placed users in a loaded cell. Typically, some<br>
combination of the two extremes above, termed a "Proportional Fair" scheduler, is used.<br>
Typical inputs to the HSDPA scheduler include the MAC-hs buffer fill levels in the Node<br>
B and the CQI (link quality) reports from the user terminals.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A problem with the current HSDPA solution is the fact that the HSDPA scheduler lacks<br>
information identifying where a higher data layer data unit (e.g. IP packet) begins and<br>
ends. When a user terminal (or "UE" according to 3G terminology) is allocated resources<br>
by the scheduler, the MAC-hs can, depending on the link quality reported by the UE (CQI<br>
4<br><br>
report), choose a suitable transport block size to be used in the next transmission interval.<br>
However, there is no means for the MAC-hs to know if a higher layer data unit has been<br>
fully transmitted or not. Since the RLC performs the segmentation (within the RNC) and<br>
re-assembly (within the UE), the end-user will not receive any direct benefit from the<br>
transmission until the whole IP packet has been fully transmitted. If only a part of an RLC<br>
SDU fitted into the scheduled transmission interval, the protocol layers above the RLC in<br>
the UE will not receive the RLC SDU before additional resources have been scheduled to<br>
the user. In a loaded cell, this will mean a significant delay.<br>
To illustrate this problem, a scenario can be considered where twenty active users are<br>
sharing an HSDPA channel within a given cell of a WCDMA mobile network. For<br>
simplicity, it is assumed that all users have the same link-quality and that each user can<br>
have an instantaneous peak-data rate of 800 kbps if scheduled in a pure TDM-fashion. It<br>
is also assumed that all twenty users have one full IP packet of 1 kbyte in their MAC-hs<br>
buffers and that a Round-Robin-type scheduler for each 2ms TTI is in use (a Maximum-<br>
C/I would do the exactly the same job, as no differences in link quality have been<br>
assumed).<br>
The service time of a 1 kbyte packet over 800 kbps is 10 ms (5 TTIs). The aggregated<br>
buffers of all 20 users with 1 kbyte each will require a transmission capacity equivalent of<br>
200 ms channel occupancy (100 TTIs). However, since the scheduling interval (TTI) is 2<br>
ms, it means that the first IP packet will be successfully forwarded to upper layers only<br>
after 162 ms - the last one at 200 ms after transmission of the first scheduled unit. This is<br>
because the scheduler does not "know" the boarders of the IP packet, and the scheduler<br>
will allocate one TTI to each user at a time. Thus, the scheduler will schedule one<br>
segment of each packet to each user at a time. This results in a mean packet transfer time<br>
of 181 ms in the present example.<br>
The problems with this approach to scheduling are further pronounced by HSDPA<br>
mobility. At HSDPA handover, the MAC-hs buffer is reset, resulting in all data stored in<br>
the MAC-hs buffer being deleted. In RLC acknowledged mode (AM) mode, lost data has<br>
to be re-transmitted leading to additional delays of partly transmitted RLC SDUs. In the<br>
above example, if it is assumed that an (arbitrary) UE is subject to a handover 120 ms after<br>
the first scheduling event, handover will always result in the loss of a partly transmitted<br>
5<br><br>
packet, because all UEs will have a packet "in flight". For RLC unacknowledged mode<br>
(UM), lost MAC-hs fragments escalate into the loss of the full RLC SDU . Thus, with<br>
highly mobile equipment, it is beneficial to have as few partly transmitted RLC SDUs in<br>
flight, as this reduces the risk of losses at times of handover. Whilst the specified HSDPA<br>
"flow-control" mechanism between the Node B and the RNC can regulate the amount of<br>
data buffered in a MAC-hs - to reduce the amount of losses at times of handover - when<br>
scheduled, each IP packet should then be fully transmitted as soon as possible, to avoid the<br>
transmission being interrupted by a handover resulting in the loss of the partly transmitted<br>
packet.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
scheduling data for transmission over the air interface of a radio access network, said data<br>
being transported over the air interface on a downlink shared channel, the method<br>
comprising:<br>
receiving data in the form of higher layer data units at a radio network controller;<br>
segmenting and/or concatenating said higher layer data units into protocol data<br>
units;<br>
forwarding said protocol data units from the radio network controller to a radio<br>
base station serving one or more user terminals, the radio network controller also<br>
identifying to the radio base station the boundaries of the higher layer data units<br>
within the protocol data units; and<br>
at the radio base station, scheduling each protocol data unit, or sub-units thereof,<br>
for transmission over the air interface in dependence upon the higher layer unit(s)<br>
to which the data contained in the protocol data unit or sub-unit belong(s).<br>
The step of identifying to the radio base station the protocol data units belonging to a<br>
common higher layer data unit, may be carried out using in-band signalling, e.g. by<br>
including a special field in the user plane frame carrying the protocol data units. More<br>
particularly, a higher layer data unit length indicator may be included in the user plane<br>
frame header for each higher layer data unit, indicating the beginning and end of a<br>
sequence of RLC PDUs belonging to the higher layer data unit.<br>
Alternatively, for each higher layer data unit, all of the RLC PDUs belonging to a given<br>
higher layer data unit may be included in the same user plane frame. RLC PDUs<br>
6<br><br>
belonging to the more than one higher layer data unit may be included in the same frame,<br>
but only whole packets.<br>
The invention is applicable to wideband code division multiple access radio networks in<br>
particular, e.g. 3G. However, it is also applicable to evolved 3G networks including Super<br>
3G, 4G, as well as to EV-DO, EV-DV.<br>
In the case of 3G (or an evolved 3G network using a similar channel configuration), said<br>
downlink shared channel is preferably a high speed downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH),<br>
and the interface between the radio network controller and the radio base station is the Iub<br>
interface. Preferably, said step of identifying to the radio base station the protocol data<br>
units belonging to a common higher layer data unit comprises implicitly or explicitly<br>
identifying this information in the Iub/Iur user plane frames or frame structure.<br>
Said step of scheduling protocol data units for transmission over the air interface may<br>
comprise one of:<br>
Prioritising MAC-hs queues including partly sent RLC SDUs over queues containing only<br>
completely unsent RLC SDUs.<br>
Prioritising MAC-hs queues including on average small RLC SDUs over those MAC-hs<br>
queues including on average relatively large RLC SDUs.<br>
Always scheduling sufficient resources to each MAC-hs queue to fully transmit at least<br>
one RLC SDU from a MAC-hs queue.<br>
Choosing one or more transport block sizes suitable for carrying one or more scheduled<br>
RLC SDUs. This may be done dynamically.<br>
Scheduling may also take into account other factors including, for example, the link-<br>
quality for a given user.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the present invention, said higher layer data units are IP<br>
packets.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a radio network controller<br>
for use in a radio access network, the controller comprising:<br>
7<br><br>
an input for receiving data in the form of higher layer data units at a radio network<br>
controller;<br>
a processor for segmenting and/or concatenating said higher layer data units into<br>
protocol data units; and<br>
transmission means for forwarding said protocol data units to a radio base station<br>
serving one or more user terminals,<br>
said processor being arranged to identify to the radio base station the boundaries of<br>
the higher layer data units within the protocol data units.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a radio base station for use in<br>
a radio access network, the radio base station comprising:<br>
an input for receiving protocol data units sent by a radio network controller;<br>
a processor for determining from information sent to the radio base station by the<br>
radio network controller, protocol data units belonging to a common higher layer<br>
data unit, and for scheduling each protocol data unit for transmission over the air<br>
interface in dependence upon the higher layer data unit to which it belongs.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a method of transmitting<br>
data over the air interface of a radio access network, said data being transported over the<br>
air interface on a downlink shared channel, the method comprising:<br>
receiving data in the form of higher layer data units at a radio network controller;<br>
loading each higher layer data unit into a corresponding protocol data unit;<br>
forwarding said protocol data units from the radio network controller to a radio<br>
base station serving one or more user terminals; and<br>
at the radio base station, segmenting the received protocol data units into data<br>
blocks, and scheduling each data block for transmission over the air interface in<br>
dependence upon the higher layer unit to which it belongs.<br>

The problems caused by the requirements of HSDPA to schedule the transmission of RLC<br>
PDUs at the radio base station or Node B have been considered above. The solution<br>
proposed here is to provide the Node B with information identifying the boundaries and<br>
sizes of RLC SDUs (e.g. IP packets). Whilst the Node B may or may not use this<br>
information in isolation, it does allow the Node B to make a more "intelligent" decision<br>
regarding the scheduling of RLC PDUs for transmission, thereby optimising the capacity<br>
offered by the HS-DSCH. The solution might be thought of as an "IP-centric" packet<br>
scheduling solution, and relies upon the fact that IP packet boarders are "known" to the<br>
RNC.<br>
9<br><br>
Considering the example discussed above, with twenty active users are sharing an HSDPA<br>
channel within a given cell of a WCDMA mobile network, the benefits of the IP-centric<br>
approach can be quantified. If the scheduler knows the IP packet borders, it can invest 5<br>
TTI:s for each UE at a time, thereby completing the sending of the first packet in 10 ms<br>
and the last one 200 ms after the first scheduling event. The IP centric scheduler results in<br>
a mean packet transfer time of 105 ms. Considering the case of a UE subject to a<br>
handover 120 ms after the first scheduling event, for the IP centric scheduler, this will<br>
result in the loss of a packet in less than 50% of cases, as more than 50% of the UEs will<br>
already have received their IP packet in full prior to the handover.<br>
The information identifying the IP packet boundaries needs to be transferred to the Node<br>
B, and can be done either explicitly or implicitly, as follows.<br>
Explicitly: This involves including a Length Indicator (LI) in the Iub/Iur user-plane frame<br>
structure for the HS-DSCH, which indicates where an RLC SDU begins and where it ends.<br>
Formally, this requires an interface between RLC/MAC/FP to forward the RLC length<br>
indicator information (held within the RNC) from the RLC layer to the Iub/Iur user-plane<br>
frame protocol. The new LI is then carried in the HS-DSCH Iub frame (header or header<br>
extension). Such a solution could potentially be included in the 3G TS 25.435.<br>
Implicitly: This requires that the Iub/Iur user-plane frame-protocol implementation be<br>
designed to always send the RLC PDUs belonging to a common RLC SDU within the<br>
same Iub/Iur user-plane frame. This solution could easily be implemented without the<br>
need for standardisation (although the solution could also be standardized as an "Iub/Iur<br>
service option"). If RLC concatenation is performed such that a single RLC PDU can<br>
contain data from two successive RLC SDUs, this rule may be modified to allow the last<br>
RLC/MAC PDU in a frame to contain concatenated data from the subsequent RLC SDU.<br>
Regardless of how the IP packet boundary information is transmitted to the Node B, the<br>
NodeB scheduler utilises the (new) information in its scheduling decisions. The scheduler<br>
may still use a number of different criteria in deciding upon which MAC-hs queue to<br>
schedule next. For example, fairness aspects need to be considered, and the aspect of link<br>
10<br><br>
quality dependent scheduling should still be accounted for. Specific scheduling strategies<br>
could include:<br>
•	Prioritising MAC-hs queues including partly sent RLC SDUs over queues<br>
containing completely unsent RLC SDUs, such that the MAC-hs queue which is<br>
estimated to require the least resources to finalise the transmission of the partly<br>
sent RLC SDU is transmitted first. This ensures that the transmission of a partly<br>
transmitted IP packet is resumed as soon as possible - possibly by balancing other<br>
scheduling criteria with the present one.<br>
•	Prioritising the scheduling of resources to MAC-hs queues including small RLC<br>
SDUs over those MAC-hs queues including large RLC SDUs. This makes use of<br>
the assumption that small packets tend to belong to time-sensitive applications, or<br>
to connection establishments.<br>
•	A particular scheduler for Conversational Class Radio Access Bearers realised<br>
with RLC UM, such that the scheduler always schedules enough resources to each<br>
MAC-hs queue to fully transmit at least one RLC SDU.<br>
Each of these prioritisation schemes may be combined with one or more other criteria for<br>
scheduling transmission from the MAC-hs queues. One such other criterion may be, for<br>
example, the link-quality, where a queue is prioritised depending to the amount of<br>
resources/TTIs that are estimated to be needed to transmit one or several complete RLC<br>
SDUs stored in the MAC-hs queue.<br>
The term "prioritising" can in general terms be understood as "weighting" - in case there<br>
are many different aspects that the scheduler is accounting for (such as fairness, delay, link<br>
quality...).<br>
Rather than use an approach that selects RLC PDUs individually according to whether or<br>
not they belong to an RLC SDU that is already in-flight, an HS-DSCH transport block<br>
selection mechanism can be utilised which chooses a transport block size that can include<br>
one or several full IP packets. The MAC-hs "fills" transport blocks with RLC PDUs<br>
belonging to the same IP packet, using the information received from the RNC.<br>
It is noted that an implicit requirement of the approach described here is that the re-<br>
transmission of data over the air interface is prioritised ahead of the transmission of RLC<br>
11<br><br>
PDUs belonging to completely unsent RLC SDUs, as retransmissions will of course<br>
belong to "in-flight" RLC SDUs.<br>
A particular implementation is a realization of RLC UM over HS-DSCH together with IP<br>
centric scheduling to minimize packet-losses at times of handover.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates schematically the main functional components of the radio network<br>
controller and the Node B. These include, for the radio network controller: an input 1 for<br>
receiving IP packets; a processor 2 implementing the RLC entity; and an output 3 coupled<br>
to the physical transport network. For the Node B, the figure illustrates: an input 4<br>
coupled to the physical transport network; a processor 5 which receives the RLC PDUs<br>
from the input 4, and an output 7 coupled to the base station transmitter for sending data<br>
over the air interface. The processor 5 operates as a scheduler, scheduling the<br>
transmission of RLC PDUs from the various MAC-hs buffers 6. Figure 5 is a flow<br>
diagram illustrating the main steps in the mechanisms described above.<br>
The exemplary implementations described above provide the following potential<br>
advantages:<br>
The proposed HSDPA IP-centric scheduler provides lower per-packet delay on average<br>
compared to existing schedulers.<br>
It results in fewer outstanding and partly transmitted RLC SDUs, which at times of<br>
HSDPA handover translates into lower delays for RLC AM and fewer losses for RLC<br>
UM.<br>
Fewer losses for RLC UM translates into a smaller resource (capacity) wastage.<br>
Fewer losses or lower delays result in better perceived quality for the end user.<br>
The person of skill in the art will appreciate that various modifications may be made to the<br>
above described embodiment without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
In particular one might consider implementing a method where each higher layer data unit<br>
(e.g. IP packet) is packed into a single lower-layer protocol data unit. This would require<br>
12<br><br>
a "flexible" RLC/MAC, which can accept any PDU/SDU sizes. Although this is not<br>
possible for current implementations of 3G, it may be possible for example in Super 3G).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, IP packets may be concatenated at the RNC<br>
without segmentation, i.e. one RLC PDU will contain two or more complete IP packets.<br>
Upon receipt of an RLC PDU at the Node B, the PDU will be segmented into data blocks<br>
or sub-units for transmission over the air interface. The RNC will identify to the Node B<br>
where IP packets begin and end within the PDU. The Node B will schedule a sub-unit for<br>
transmission in dependence upon the IP packet to which it belongs.<br>
