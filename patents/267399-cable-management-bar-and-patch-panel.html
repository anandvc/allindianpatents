Cable Management Bar and Patch Panel<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a telecommunications connecting<br>
panel and, more particularly, to a patch panel including a frame member detachably<br>
coupled to a cable management bar.<br>
Background<br>
Local area networks and telecommunications connections often use<br>
patch panels, especially at the customer's premises, to enable inter- or cross-<br>
connection between telecommunications equipment. Patch panels typically<br>
comprise a frame member including plurality of connector locations wherein any of<br>
a variety of jacks, including, but not limited to, copper and fiber, may be mounted.<br>
The jacks allow for fairly rapid connection and disconnection between two jacks in<br>
the same patch panel, or between one jack in the patch panel and another jack in a<br>
nearby patch panel, with a patch cord. One type of jack and plug arrangement for a<br>
patch panel is an RJ45 type connector, described in U.S. Patent No. 5,639,261.<br>
Other patch panels and jacks are shown and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,299,956<br>
and 5,674,093.<br>
There is an increasing need for cable management in order to keep<br>
the various cables organized and protected from damage. One area where damage<br>
and/or loss of performance may occur with cables is when excessive bending of the<br>
cable occurs. A cable management bar provides a support structure whereon the<br>
plurality of cables running to the connector locations may be supported to alleviate<br>
any excessive bending. One example of a cable management bar is shown and<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,600,106 to Standish et al., the entirety of which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Various concerns arise in the case of cable management bars. One<br>
concern is that the bars may be difficult to mount if they mount to the rack or cabinet<br>
at mounting locations different from the panel mounting locations and separate<br>
hardware pieces are used to mount the bars to the rack or cabinet. In addition, if the<br>
bars are permanently affixed to the panels, not every situation requires bars, thereby<br>
resulting in unnecessary structure in the rack or cabinet.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention relates to a telecommunications connecting<br>
panel and, more particularly, to a patch panel including a frame member detachably<br>
coupled to a cable management bar.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1-7, an embodiment of a patch panel 100<br>
with a frame member 110 is shown for use in inter- or cross connecting<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/108038	PCT/US2006/012664<br>
telecommunications equipment. Also shown is a cable management member 150.<br>
Patch panel 100 may be mounted to a rack or cabinet of conventional construction<br>
(not shown), such as with fasteners passing through openings 118 of the frame<br>
member 110.<br>
The frame member 110 includes parallel bars 106, 108 extending<br>
from a first frame end 114 to a second frame end 116. A plurality of members 320<br>
extend between bars 106, 108 to form the offset between bars 106, 108. As shown<br>
in Figures 15 and 16, each member 320 includes an extension 326, surfaces 328,<br>
329, and an aperture 322 extending through member 320.<br>
Referring back to Figures 1-7, bars 106, 108 and members 320 define<br>
therebetween a plurality of connector locations 120 running from the first frame end<br>
114 to the second frame end 116, wherein any of a variety of jacks or connector<br>
elements, including, but not limited to, copper and fiber, can be mounted. For<br>
example, RJ45 jacks, coax connectors, and fiber optic adapters can be mounted in<br>
connector locations 120, such as with snaps.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, a plurality of connector modules<br>
700, each including a plurality of jacks 702, are rotatably mounted in connector<br>
locations 120 formed between members 320. See Figure 17. Members 320 can be<br>
used to selectively lock connector modules 700 to frame member 110 as desired.<br>
Additional details regarding a frame member configured in a manner similar to that<br>
of frame member 110 are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,537,106 to Follingstad, the<br>
entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The frame member 110 further includes first and second end flanges<br>
224 and 226 with openings 118 positioned at the first and second frame ends 114<br>
and 116. The first and second end flanges 224 and 226 can be used to mount the<br>
frame member 110 to a support structure such as a rack or cabinet. Structure and<br>
methods other than first and second end flanges may also be used to mount the<br>
frame member 110 to a rack or cabinet, such as, for example, the frame member can<br>
be integrally attached to a rack during manufacture of the rack itself.<br>
Referring now to Figures 8-14, the cable management member 150 is<br>
shown in greater detail. Cable management member 150 generally includes a<br>
horizontal main bar 380 with first and second ends 382, 384, and side members 482<br>
and 484 coupled to bar 380 at the first and second ends 382, 384.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/108038	PCT/US2006/012664<br>
The bar 380 includes a flat surface 392 and a vertical flange 394. In<br>
the example shown, the flat surface 392 defines a plurality of slots 396. In example<br>
embodiments, cable ties (not shown) can be extended through the slots 396 to secure<br>
cables extending along flat surface 392 of bar 380.<br>
Side members 482, 484 include fingers 490, 492 and 491, 493 that<br>
generally form C-shaped openings 494, 495. Four protrusions 496, 497, 498, 499<br>
extend inwardly from each of side members 482, 484 towards an opposite one of<br>
side members 482, 484. See Figure 10. Protrusions 496, 497 form space 500, and<br>
protrusions 498, 499 form space 501 therebetween. In the example embodiment,<br>
protrusions 497, 499 include tapered surfaces 497a, 499a that assist in coupling<br>
member 150 to frame member 110, as described below.<br>
In the example shown, ends 486 of side members 482, 484 are<br>
coupled to bar 380 by spot welding each side member 482, 484 to a respective end<br>
382, 384 of the bar 380. In this manner, opposite ends 488 of side members 482,<br>
484 can be flexed slightly outwardly with respect to each other to detachably couple<br>
the main bar 380 to the frame member 110, as described further below. Other<br>
methods for coupling the side members 482, 484 to the bar 380 can also be used or,<br>
in alternative embodiments, side members 482, 484 can be formed as part of the<br>
main bar 380.<br>
In the examples shown, the frame member 110 and cable<br>
management member 150 are both made of sheet metal. For example, the horizontal<br>
bar 380 can be made of 16 gauge (0.060") sheet metal, and the side members 482,<br>
484 can be made of rolled metal (see roll 510 in side member 484 shown in Figure<br>
10) to provide a semi-rigid construction. Other materials can be used.<br>
The members 320 can be formed of a number of materials such as<br>
plastic or metal.<br>
Referring now again to Figures 1-7, the frame member 110 and cable<br>
management member 150 can be detachably coupled as follows. As shown in<br>
Figures 5-7, protrusions 497, 499 of side member 482 of cable management bar 150<br>
can be positioned in aperture 322 of member 320 located at the first frame end 114<br>
of frame member 110. In this position, spaces 500, 501 receive extension 326 of<br>
member 320 (see Figure 6) so that extension 326 is sandwiched between protrusions<br>
496, 497 and 498, 499 of side member 482. In addition, protrusion 497 engages<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/108038	PCT/US2006/012664<br>
surface 328 of member 320, and protrusion 499 engages surface 329 of member 320.<br>
In this configuration, side member 482 is held in place on frame member 110.<br>
Once side member 482 of cable management bar 150 is coupled to<br>
frame member 110 as described above and shown in Figures 5-7, side member 484<br>
on second end 384 of bar 150 is swung in a direction Y towards member 320 located<br>
at the second frame end 116 of frame member 110. As second end 384 reaches bar<br>
150, tapered surfaces 497a, 499a of protrusions 497, 499 contact edge 326a of<br>
extension 326 of member 320 (see Figures 5, 15, and 16) located at second frame<br>
end 116. Tapered surfaces 497a, 499a ride along edge 326a and cause side member<br>
484 to flex slightly outwardly in a direction X (see Figures 5 and 7) until ends 497b,<br>
499b of protrusions 497, 499 clear edge 326a of extension 326 of member 320.<br>
Once protrusions 497, 499 of side member 484 clear edge 326a of extension 326,<br>
protrusions 497, 499 are received in aperture 322. Extension 326 is also received in<br>
spaces 500, 501 of side member 484. In this configuration, both side members 482,<br>
484 are coupled to frame member 110. See Figures 1-4.<br>
To decouple the cable management member 150 from the frame<br>
member 110, a slight outwardly directed force in direction X can be applied to either<br>
side member 482 or 484. For example, a force in direction X shown in Figures 5<br>
and 7 can be applied to side member 484 so that protrusions 496, 498 of side<br>
member 484 are removed from aperture 322 of member 320. Second end 384 of<br>
cable management bar 150 can then be swung away from the second frame end 116<br>
of frame member 110 in a direction Z, and then side member 482 can be removed<br>
from the first frame end 114 of frame member 110.<br>
In accordance with the example embodiments described above, the<br>
cable management member 150 can be detachably mounted to members 320 of the<br>
frame member 110, rather than being mounted to a rack or cabinet. Because the<br>
cable management member 150 mounts directly to the frame member 110, there is<br>
no need for additional structure on the rack or cabinet for mounting the cable<br>
management member 150. Also, no additional hardware or holes are necessary. In<br>
addition, a cable management member in accordance with the present invention can<br>
be easily removed when not needed and can further be retrofitted to a frame member<br>
if needed at a later point.<br>
