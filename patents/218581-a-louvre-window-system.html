				<td>A LOUVRE WINDOW SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to a louvre system for louvre windows,<br>
and particularly for louvre windows comprising glass, metal, timber, plastic<br>
blades etc, and comprises a plurality of improvements to existing louvre<br>
systems, these improvements being directed to improvements to reducing<br>
water penetration and to drain water- from a louvre window, and<br>
improvements to the louvre operating system by which louvre blades can be<br>
opened and closed together. Other improvements to the louvre system will<br>
also become apparent.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Louvre windows consist of a surround frame formed of upper<br>
and lower horizontal frame portions and opposed side frame portions which<br>
are fastened together. The frame supports an array of horizontal louvres<br>
which pivot about horizontal pivot pins between louvre open and louvre closed<br>
positions. It is known to tip the frame on its side such that the louvres extend<br>
vertically, however the invention will be described with respect to horizontally<br>
extending louvre blades.<br>
For louvre windows, the blades are typically formed of glass (but<br>
can be made of other material) and are rectangular when viewed in plan. The<br>
blades can have a length of anywhere between 20 to 120cm, a width of<br>
between 10 to 40cm, and a thickness of between 4 to 20mm.<br>
As it is not practical to drill holes in glass blades, it is usual for<br>
the blades to be supported by end clips. One end clip is pivotally attached to<br>
one side frame portion and the other end clip is pivotally attached to the other<br>
side frame portion. It is normal for the end clips on one side frame portion to<br>
be functionally attached together such that all the end clips can be rotated by<br>
a louvre operating mechanism. The end clips on the other side frame portion<br>
can usually pivot independently.<br>
In order to reduce water penetration through the louvre window,<br>
the blades are in an overlapping configuration when closed, which means that<br>
a lower longitudinal edge of an upper blade overlaps the uppei longitudinal<br>
edge of an adjacent lower blade. It is also known to have end clips<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
configured to seal against each other to minimise water penetration through<br>
the end clips. The configuration of the end clip includes a longitudinal rib<br>
which seals against the U-shaped aluminium channel as the end clip pivots<br>
from the open position to the closed position.<br>
Notwithstanding many attempts to redesign the end clip, water<br>
still penetrates through the join between one end clip and a second end clip<br>
when the clips are in the closed position. This is exacerbated when there is<br>
also a pressure differential between the front of the louvre and the rear of the<br>
louvre. A pressure differential often occurs during sudden storms where the<br>
pressure inside the room can be appreciably lower than the outside pressure<br>
resulting in an air/water mixture being forced between the end clips when the<br>
louvres are in the closed position.<br>
Overlapping blades are not very effective in preventing water<br>
penetration. Under strong wind and rain conditions, water can be forced<br>
uphill between the overlapping closed blades and into the interior of the<br>
louvre window. One way to minimise this is to increase the degree of overlap<br>
but this increases the size and weight of a louvre window and reduces optical<br>
transparency.<br>
One form of the present invention is to provide a redesigned<br>
end clip which now has at least one drainage channel to drain water which<br>
may pass between one end clip and another end clip. Suitably, a number of<br>
drainage channels are provided to greatly reduce the possibility of water<br>
penetrating entirely through the end clips<br>
Conventional louvre operating mechanisms rotate the end clips<br>
on one side frame portion by engaging with and rotating the pivot pins. The<br>
mechanism is simple as the louvre pivots about a central portion which<br>
means that the pivot pin is easily accessible to the mechanism.<br>
A particular disadvantage with conventional louvre mechanisms<br>
is the rather large load placed on the operating mechanism when opening or<br>
closing a louvre window of the type described above. This requires<br>
components to be made of strong material, usually steel which adds to the<br>
manufacturing cost. As well, it can be difficult for a person to manipulate a<br>
conventional operating mechanism due to the larger loads.<br>
The main reason for the relatively large load being placed on<br>
operating mechanism is due to the end clip frictionally engaging with the Li-<br>
shaped channel as the end clip moves either from the closed position to the<br>
open position or from the open position to the closed position. The reason for<br>
this is that the end clip is provided with a longitudinal sealing rib or bead<br>
which wipes across the U-shaped channel as the clip rotates to the closed<br>
position, or awayfrom the closed position. This wiping action places a load<br>
on the operating system, and therefore a restriction is placed on the number<br>
of louvre blades which can be rotated by a single operating system, typically<br>
to about six blades.<br>
It would be an advantage to rotate more blades using a single<br>
handle without jeopardising or reducing the sealing action of the end clip.<br>
The reason why it would be an advantage is in being able to align the handles<br>
horizontally when a number of separate louvre windows are positioned in a<br>
single room. That is, if a room contains, say, 3 banks of louvre windows, it is<br>
aesthetically pleasing if the handles could all be at the same distance either<br>
from the ground or from the ceiling (that is aligned horizontally). Furthermore,<br>
if a handle could operate a large number of blades without damaging or<br>
destroying the operating mechanism, greater versatility would be present in<br>
placement of the handles, not only for aesthetic appeal, but also to allow<br>
mobility impaired persons (such as wheelchair persons) to operate a louvre<br>
window where are otherwise the handle may be placed in a position which is<br>
too high (or too low) for easy access by the mobility impaired person.<br>
However it is not possible to simply remove the sealing rib on<br>
the end clip in order to reduce the load placed on the operating system, as<br>
this will now reduce the weatherproofmg of the entire louvre window.<br>
It is known to open larger louvre structures using assistance<br>
from pneumatic rams, but this requires pressure piping to be installed around<br>
the frame and greatly adds to the cost. Large helical springs have also been<br>
used to assist in movement of larger louvres (typically steel or metal louvres)<br>
for fire ventilation.<br>
Various types of louvre actuating devices are known to open<br>
and close the louvre blades. A typical and very common louvre operating<br>
mechanism comprises a pair of flat metal rods which are positioned within the<br>
U-shaped channel. The louvre end clip is attached to the bearing. The<br>
bearing has a rear face containing two spaced apart stubby pins. One metal<br>
rod is attached to one of the pins and the other metal rod is attached to the<br>
other pin. The rods reciprocate in opposite directions and are controlled by<br>
an external handle. Movement of the handle either upwardly or downwardly<br>
causes one of the rods to move one way and the other rod to move the other<br>
way which in turn rotates the bearing and therefore the end clip and therefore<br>
the louvre between the closed and the open positions. The pair of flat metal<br>
rods connects between 4-6 end clips to rotate together upon operation of the<br>
handle.<br>
With this system, the short stubby pins which are attached to the<br>
bars exhibit quite strong forces upon operation of the louvre operating<br>
mechanism. Importantly, these pins exhibit a bending force as well as a<br>
shear force. While the pins are typically strong enough to withstand the shear<br>
forces, it is found that most failure of the louvre operating mechanism occurs<br>
when the pins break due to the bending force. Therefore, it would be an<br>
advantage if it was possible to develop a louvre operating mechanism which<br>
would place less bending force on the pins.<br>
Another disadvantage with this conventional system is the<br>
requirement to process and assemble two bars into the U-shaped channel as<br>
part of the manufacture of the operating system. The heads of the pins need<br>
to be permanently deformed to hold the bars in position. This requires<br>
specialised assembly equipment, and once the operating system is<br>
assembled no part of the assembly can be readily replaced. Therefore, if,<br>
say, one of the pins is damaged, it is necessary to remove the entire louvre<br>
operating system and to replace it. This is quite expensive and laborious.<br>
It is known to provide a louvre operating mechanism which has<br>
only a single bar. This provides certain advantages over the assembly<br>
described above. Typically, the single bar is a rack and pinion system where<br>
the bar is provided with a rack (a type of tooth structure), and the bearing (to<br>
which the end clip is attached) is provided with some sort ot pinion<br>
arrangement. It is essential that the teeth on the rack and the teeth on the<br>
pinion are formed in the correct shape which requires both to be moulded<br>
components. The bar containing the rack is formed into smaller sections<br>
which are joined together such that the required number of blades can be<br>
operated with a single handle. It is extremely important that the spacing<br>
between the racks on the bar is exactly correct, otherwise operation of the<br>
handle will result in louvre blades closing or opening in a nonuniform manner.<br>
For instance, one louvre blade could be in the fully closed position while an<br>
adjacent louvre blade is in the almost closed position and this is certainly<br>
undesirable. Therefore, the manufacture and the assembly of this type nf<br>
louvre operating system is expensive and requires extreme accuracy.<br>
The large majority of louvre systems manufactured in the world today<br>
rely on a simple handle and link systems to operate the louvre mechanism<br>
(open and close the louvre blades). This simple handle/link also provides<br>
complete and positive closure of the window by means of the handle/link joint<br>
being forced over-centre via an intuitive action of pushing the handle into a<br>
closed position.<br>
The handle/link joint is constructed using a purpose made rivet or stud<br>
with the link being attached to either the top or bottom face of the handle The<br>
method of attaching the link to one face of the handle via a rivet results in<br>
flexing of this joint when locking -(over centre closing)- pressure is applied to<br>
the system (tests have confirmed that there Is a correlation between locking<br>
pressure, blade to blade contact, and water penetration resistance). Because<br>
one member is placed on top of the other member and then joined together<br>
via a rivet, the acting/reacting forces are not in alignment with each other<br>
which introduces a bending moment at the joint, which in turn results in<br>
flexing of the joint. This flexing of the joint ultimately results in failure of the<br>
joint (the most common failure being that the rivet either breaks, or pulls out<br>
of the link).<br>
It would be an advantage if if were possible to minimise or<br>
eliminate this disadvantage.<br>

an end clip containing Internal drainage channels.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a louvre system<br>
containing various improvements and which may overcome at least some of<br>
the abovementioned disadvantages.<br>
In one form, the invention resides in a louvre end clip, the end<br>
clip having an outer body, a longitudinal recess formed in the outer body and<br>
which is adapted to accommodate the edge of a louvre blade, the outer body<br>
having at least one internal drainage chamber which allows water to drain<br>
through the end clip when the end clip is in the closed position.<br>
Previous end clips failed to provide internal drainage chambers<br>
which meant that if water did penetrate between end clips, it would simply run<br>
over the outside of the end clip and hopefully into a lower collection channel<br>
on the bottom of the louvre window. However, this is quite unsightly and<br>
often water drips off the end clips and lands on the floor rather than passing<br>
down the various louvre blades and fnto the collection channel on the bottom<br>
of the louvre window. The internal drainage chamber can be seen as a water<br>
collection chamber.<br>
Suitably, the at least one drainage or collection chamber has an<br>
open bottom and forms a closed chamber with the U-shaped channel to<br>
which the end clip is attached when the clip is in the closed position. This<br>
reduces the weight of the end clip and can also reduce the load placed on the<br>
louvre operating system by not having a closed bottom wall that may<br>
frictionally rub against the U-shaped section. However, if an entirely closed<br>
chamber is considered desirable it will form part of the present invention.<br>
Suitably, the at least one chamber has an at least partially open<br>
top end and an at least partially open bottom end. Thus, when a number of<br>
end clips are all in the closed position and in line with each other, the<br>
chamber on each end clip can communicate with the chamber on each<br>
adjacent end clip to form a single drainage channel to allow water to quickly<br>
and unobtrusively drain into the collecting channel or some other form of<br>
channel/drainage means on the lower part of the louvre frame.<br>
Suitably, the at least one chamber extends between the<br>
longitudinal recess which accommodate the louvre blade, and an outer edge<br>
of the end dip.<br>
It is preferred that the at least one chamber has a curved outer<br>
wall and therefore may comprise a curved outer wall extending between the<br>
longitudinal recess and the free edge of the end clip. It is preferred that the<br>
outer wall is uniformly curved.<br>
It is preferred that the at least one chamber has one wall which<br>
is defined by a wall which comprises the longitudinal recess.<br>
In use, any water which penetrates between adjacent closed<br>
end clips will pass into the at least one chamber. In this area, there will<br>
typically be a change of pressure and velocity conditions and this typically<br>
results in water droplets becoming more easily separated from the air and<br>
dropping into and along the at least one chamber to be drained away.<br>
Suitably, the end clip is provided with more than one drainage<br>
chamber. Thus, a second drainage chamber may be provided. The second<br>
drainage chamber may comprise the longitudinal recess and more preferably<br>
may comprise a gap formed between the louvre blade that is positioned within<br>
the longitudinal recess and the bottom wall of the longitudinal recess.<br>
If necessary, a spacing means may be provided to ensure that<br>
the louvre blade is not pushed all the way into the longitudinal recess such<br>
that a gap is no longer formed. The spacing means may comprise a<br>
projection or a plurality of projections, a rib, and the like. The spacing means<br>
may be sufficient to ensure that there is a gap of least 1-8 mm.<br>
The end clip suitably has a third drainage chamber. The third<br>
drainage chamber may be similar to the at least one chamber but on the<br>
other side of the clip.<br>
Thus, a preferred end clip can be provided with 3 drainage<br>
chambers/zones/areas being an outer chamber (the at least one chamber) an<br>
intermediate chamber (in the longitudinal recess), and an inner chamber (the<br>
third drainage chamber which is on the other side of the longitudinal recess).<br>
It is preferred that the at least one chamber and the third inner<br>
chamber have a curved outer wall, and therefore in another form the invention<br>
resides in an end clip for a louvre, the end dip comprising a longitudinal body,<br>
the longitudinal body being substantially semicircular in cross-section, and<br>
having a longitudinal recess into which a louvre blade can fit.<br>
Another advantage with the above clip configuration is that when<br>
the clips are all in the closed position, a substantially continuous line is<br>
produced which provides better drainage and weatherproofing.<br>
If desired, a shroud can be provided. The shroud may comprise<br>
an extending lip that extends over an adjacent clip when the two clips are in<br>
the closed position and to provide further weatherproofing. The shroud may<br>
be formed integrally with the clip. The length of the shroud has an effect on<br>
the weatherproofing of the clips, however if the shroud is too long, the shroud<br>
may be damaged and manufacturing costs are increased. After much<br>
research and experimentation it has been found that the shroud length is<br>
dependent on the gap width between adjacent clips, and a ratio of shroud<br>
length to gap width should be between 5-6. Thus, if the gap width is<br>
approximately 1 mm, the shroud length should be between 5 mm 6 mm.<br>
In order to allow a single handle to manipulate a larger than<br>
normal number of louvre blades, and in order to avoid manufacture of<br>
extremely heavy duty and expensive louvre operating systems, the present<br>
invention is also directed to an arrangement where the load on the operating<br>
system can be reduced which thereby aHows a handle to operate a larger<br>
than normal number of louvres blades.<br>
One form of the present invention allows this to happen by<br>
ensuring that the clip does not frictionally engage or rub up along the U-<br>
shaped section until just before the clip is pivoted to the fully closed position<br>
at which time a seal is formed. Thus, once the clip has been only slightly<br>
opened, the sealing engagement between the clip and the channel is typically<br>
lost which means that there is much less load placed on the louvre operating<br>
system upon further operation of the end clip.<br>
In one form this can be achieved by providing an assembly of an<br>
end clip, a bearing and a channel member, the end clip being pivotaliy<br>
attached to the channel member to enable the end clip to be rotated between<br>
a closed position where the end clip is substantially in line with the channel<br>
member, and an open position where the end clip pivots to an angle relative<br>
to the channel member, the bearing being attached to the end clip such that<br>
rotation of the bearing causes the end clip to rotate, the bearing having a<br>
portion which is positioned in the channel member, this portion being provided<br>
with a first camming member, the channel member being provided with<br>
camming surface, the position of the camming member and the second<br>
camming surface being such that a seal is obtained only when the bearing<br>
member is rotated to the louvre closed position, but when the bearing<br>
member is rotated to a partially louvre opening position, the seal is lost.<br>
Thus, the end clip can now be rotatably attached tn the channel<br>
member quite loosely by which is meant that the end clip does not frictionally<br>
rub up across the channel member for most of the time that the end clip<br>
moves between opened in closed positions. Only when the end clip is in the<br>
almost closed position does the cam engage to pull the end clip against the<br>
channel member to provide a good seal. Slight opening of the end clip will<br>
release the cam thereby allowing the end clips to again move with little<br>
frictional load against the channel member.<br>
It is envisaged that there will be many different types of<br>
camming actions or pulling actions to pull the end dip against the channel<br>
member when the end clip is in the almost closed position, and it is<br>
considered that the invention should not be limited to just one type of cam<br>
arrangement.<br>
Thus, in a broader form of this invention there may be provided<br>
an assembly comprising an end clip, a bearing to which the end clip is<br>
attached, a channel member to which the bearing is attached, the bearing<br>
being rotatable relative to the channel member, the bearing or channel<br>
member being provided with a cam arrangement such that when the end clip<br>
is in the almost closed position, the end clip is pulled against the channel<br>
member to provide a seal.<br>
The end clip can now be attached such that there is a gap<br>
between the end clip and channel member (thereby reducing frictional<br>
engagement), and although this in theory could allow water to more easily<br>
pass through the end clip, as soon as the end clip is rotated to the closed<br>
position, it is pulled against the channel member to provide a good seal<br>
thereto.<br>
The camming device can be spring-loaded so that any tolerance<br>
issues are negated.<br>
For the majority of the open/close cycle, the cam is not<br>
functioning with the results that there is negligible contact between the clip<br>
and the channel. This minimises load on the operating mechanism. Thi3<br>
allows a greater number of blades to be operated with the one handle. This<br>
enables the handles to be positioned in a more economically sound position.<br>
The cam functions to pull the end clip to the face of the channel<br>
member. Another advantage with this is any visible light between the end clip<br>
and channel Is eliminated This can improve the aesthetics and the<br>
perception of weatherproofing.<br>
It is preferred that the end clip comprises a concave bow over its<br>
length. This is done such that the pulling down of the clip onto the channel by<br>
the cam will result in the clip being called into contact with the channel over<br>
the full length of the clip.<br>
In a further form of the invention there is provided an improved<br>
louvre operating system. This operating system requires only a single bar<br>
(which is already known), but the bar has a particular shape and is held in a<br>
particular manner that provide significant benefits.<br>
Therefore, another form of the invention is directed to a louvre<br>
operating system which comprises an elongate operating bar, the bar being<br>
substantially L-shaped to define 2 elongate legs which are substantially at<br>
right angles to each other, one leg being provided with a plurality of sprocket<br>
tooth forms spaced along the leg.<br>
With thi3 arrangement, the tooth form is can be punched into<br>
one leg of the L section bar, with the other leg providing sufficient strength to<br>
the bar. If the bar was simply flat, the tooth form might weaken the bar which<br>
means that the bar might have to be formed of stronger and more expensive<br>
material.<br>
Preferably, a single operating bar is used to rotate all the louvre<br>
blades. Thus, it is no longer necessary to manufacture operating bars in<br>
smaller links and connect the bars together that possesses a number of<br>
disadvantages described above. Also, punching the tooth form into one leg<br>
of the bar is a relatively simple operation to carry out and the pitching<br>
accuracy is easy to achieve and maintain as this can be built into the tool.<br>
The louvre operating assembly may comprise the elongate bar<br>
as described above, and a bearing which is attached to an end clip, the<br>
bearing being provided with a tooth profile which can engage with the tooth<br>
form on the operating bar such that reciprocation of the operating bar will<br>
cause rotation of the bearing. Suitably, the operating bar contains a plurality<br>
of such forms, and may have between 2-15 tooth forms on a single operating<br>
bar. This can engage with approximately 2-15 bearings that allow 2-15 louvre<br>
blades to be operated by a single handle.<br>
The handle may be connected to a link that is contained in a slot<br>
in the handle at the joint between link and handle. This enables the rivet to be<br>
supported (or fixed) to both sides of the slot in the handle. This minimizes any<br>
bending forces on the rivet, increases the strength of the joint (for components<br>
of the same size made from the same material); and eliminates any flexing of<br>
the joint under locking pressure as there is no component of the force at the<br>
joint acting perpendicular to acting / reacting forces at the handle / link joint.<br>

BEST MODE<br>
Referring to the accompanied drawings and particularly to Figure 1, the louvre<br>
window system having a louvre end clip 10 which is generally semicircular in<br>
configuration and contains a longitudinal recess 11 formed in the body and which<br>
is adapted to accommodate the edge of a louvre blade 12.<br>
End clip 10 is positioned on a channel member and has a unique curved<br>
configuration and contains at least one drainage chamber 14. Drainage chamber<br>
14 is defined by one sidewall 15 of recess 11, and the curved outer wall 16 of<br>
end clip 10. The end clip has an open bottom 17, but when the end clip is in the<br>
closed position illustrated in figure 1, the outer wall 18 closes chamber 14. Of<br>
course, when the end clip is pivoted to the open position, chamber 14 is now<br>
open at the bottom 17.<br>
Chamber 14 extends along the length of louvre clip 10, and this is better<br>
illustrated in figures 8 and 9. Chamber 14 has two end faces 19, 20(only end<br>
face 19 being illustrated in figure 8). Each end face is formed with an opening 20<br>
to allow water to pass into and down chamber 14.<br>
Testing reveals that one of the main areas where water penetrates the system is<br>
at the intersection between adjacent clips. Because the louvre system functions<br>
by adjacent overlapping blades a gap is formed between adjacent end clips.<br>
Normal manufacturing tolerances makes it virtually impossible to eliminate the<br>
gap. Under a situation where there is a pressure differential between the inside<br>
and the outside of a lourve window, air infiltrates and water tracks through the<br>
gap between overlapping clips and enters the inside of the system.<br>
With the clip design that forms part of the present invention, any.........................<br>
air/water mixture that passes between the clips initially contacts the upper<br>
end of chamber 14, which has opening 20. The physical geometry in this<br>
area is that the "air gap" greatly increases between the narrower gap between<br>
the clips and the quite large opening into chamber 14. This increase in<br>
volume reduces the velocity and the pressure of the air/water. The result is<br>
what can be seen as a reducing vortex that "dumps" water from the air<br>
stream, the water then passing or dropping into chamber 14.<br>
The end clip of the embodiment has a second drainage<br>
chamber 21. The second drainage chamber can be seen as an intermediate<br>
drainage chamber and is defined by the lowermost portion 21 of recess 11,<br>
this being best illustrated in figure 1. This lowermost portion exists between<br>
the bottom of blade 12 and the bottom wall of recess 11. Although this<br>
chamber is not as large as chamber 14, it nevertheless does function to drain<br>
water. To prevent blade 12 from being pushed up against the bottom wall of<br>
recess 11, a small spacing member 22 is provided to ensure that chamber 21<br>
exists.<br>
The end clip finally has a third chamber 23. Third chamber 23 in<br>
the embodiment is identical in size and configuration to chamber 14 except<br>
that it extends on the other side of blade 11. Chamber 23 is defined by one<br>
sidewall 24 of recess 11 and curved outer wall 25 of end clip 10. The third<br>
chamber 23 functions as a backup to drain any water that may pass over<br>
chamber 14 and chamber 21.<br>
Thus, end clip 10 in the embodiment has 3 drainage chambers<br>
providing an extremely effective drainage of water passing between the clips.<br>
The shape of the end clip is such that when a number of end<br>
clips are in the closed position (see figure 8 illustrating 2 end clips in the<br>
closed position) the outside curved side wall is virtually a single continuous<br>
curved side wall which provides improved drainage and improved aesthetic<br>
appeal and allows for easier cleaning.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the gap 26 between two adjacent end clips<br>
and through which air/water can pass.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate another part of the invention that is the<br>
cam arrangement. Previously, In order to ensure that end clip 10 was<br>
properly sealed against channel member 13 when in the closed position, it<br>
was necessary for the inner wall of the end clip to have some form of<br>
longitudinal sealing rib which pressed against outer wall 18 of channel<br>
member 13. However, this increased the force required to operate each end<br>
clip and placed a limitation on the number of louvres which could be operated<br>
by a single operating mechanism and by a single handle.<br>
In the present invention, the end clips 10 are rotated by a<br>
bearing. 27, bearing 27 being illustrated in figures 3, 4 and 6 and being best<br>
illustrated in figures 10 and 11 which shows the bearing by itself.<br>
Bearing 27 has an outer wall 28 (see figure 11) fitted with a pair<br>
of opposed extending fingers 29. Fingers 29 extend to each side and grip the<br>
outer walls of recess 11 on end clip 10. This is best illustrated in figures 3<br>
and 4. Thus, rotation of bearing 27 causes rotation of the attached end clip.<br>
An opening (not illustrated) is provided in channel member 13 to allow the<br>
outer wall 28 and the fingers 29 of bearing 27 to project through the channel<br>
member and to engage with the outer walls of recess 11. It can also be seen<br>
from figure 3 that the fingers are positioned inside chambers 14 and 23.<br>
Bearing 27 has an inner portion 30 which is positioned inside<br>
channel member 13 as illustrated in figure 3. The inner portion is provided<br>
with a camming portion 31 that comprises a resilient strip.<br>
The inner wall of channel member 13 is provided with a<br>
camming surface 32.<br>
The camming arrangement is such that when end clip 10 is in<br>
the closed position illustrated in figure 3, camming portion 31 is against<br>
camming surface 32 which functions to pull bearing 27 slightly into channel<br>
member 13 by a distance of between 1-3 mm. As bearing 27 is attached to<br>
end clip 10, end clip is also pulled against the outer wall 18 of channel<br>
member 13. Thus, when in the closed position, end clip 10 seals against the<br>
outer wall of channel member 13.<br>
However, when the clip is slightly rotated by only a few degrees,<br>
camming portion 31 is rotated away from camming surface "32 (this being best<br>
illustrated in figure 4) that again allows the end clip to now not be pulled up<br>
against channel member 13.<br>
Referring to figure 5 there is illustrated a shroud according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. Shroud 35 covers the gap between adjacent<br>
clips. After much research and experimentation if has now been found that<br>
the efficiency of the shroud is maximised if the ratio between the gap width<br>
and the shroud length is between 5-6. Thus, if gap 36 is approximately 1 mm,<br>
the length of the shroud should be~belween 5 mm and 6 mm.<br>
"Figures 6, 7, 12 and 13 illustrate parts of a louvre operating<br>
assembly according to an embodiment of the invention. The louvre operating<br>
assembly comprises a single L-shaped operating bar 37. The L-shaped<br>
operating bar means that the bar has two leg portions 38, 39 that are<br>
substantially at right angles to each other. The leg portion 39 is best<br>
illustrated in figures 12 and 13 while the other leg portion 38 Is best illustrated<br>
in figure 6. A sprocket tooth form 40 can be punched into leg portion 39 in a<br>
relatively simple operation. The pitching accuracy is easy to achieve and<br>
maintain as this is built into the punching tool. The other leg portion 38 is not<br>
punched, and provides strength to the operating bar.<br>
Bearing 27 is a moulding and has matching tooth 41 moulded<br>
into the form.<br>
Bearing 27 has a snap on cap 42 (see figure 6 and figure 14).<br>
The snap on cap traps leg member 39 between bearing 27 and the snap on<br>
cap 42. This is best illustrated in figure 6. Other leg member 38 is guided by<br>
the sidewall of channel member 13. This arrangement means that the forces<br>
between the operating bar and bearing 27 are shear forces, which maximises<br>
the strength of the components in the system.<br>
The mechanism is also easier to assemble as the components<br>
are put together one on top of the other and in sequence. The sequence and<br>
case of assembly lends itself to the development of an automatic assembly<br>
process.<br>
The camming surface 32 in the embodiment comprises a centre<br>
rib. The centre rib also gives extra strength to the channel. In some<br>
installations the louvre assembly is screwed into the window frame through<br>
the centre of the channel. This has the tendency to deform the channel in the<br>
area where the screw is positioned with the result that the system fails the<br>
water penetration resistance requirements because of the gap caused by the<br>
defamation of the channel. The extra strength given by the rib assists in<br>
eliminating this problem.<br>
Referring to figures 15-17 there is illustrated a particular slotted<br>
handle design to form part of the louvre operating mechanism. As illustrated<br>
in these particular figures, the louvre operating mechanism comprises a pair<br>
of slide members 50, 51. Each slide member is provided with a tooth profile<br>
.52 which engages with a gear 53. Gear 53 is part of the end clip 54 of a<br>
louvre. The slide members 50, 51 are operated by pulling handle 55 either up<br>
or down. In figure 15, handle 55 is in the up position and the louvres are<br>
closed, while in figure 16 handle 55 is in the down position and the louvres<br>
are open.<br>
Handle 55 is pivotly mounted (typically via a rivet 56) to one of<br>
the slide members. Handle 55 is mounted to the other slide member via a<br>
link member 57 which is pivotly connected to the other slide member and to<br>
the handle 55. Link member 57 is pivotly connected to the handle via a pin<br>
58. Referring now to figures 17A-D, there is illustrated that handle 55 has a<br>
slot 60 and link member 57 can pivot partially into and out of slot 60. This<br>
enables pin 58 to be supported or fixed to both sides of the slot in the handle.<br>
This minimises any bending forces on the pin and increases the strength of<br>
this particular joint. There is reduced or no flexing of the joint under locking<br>
pressure as there is no component of the force at the joint which acts<br>
perpendicular to acting/reacting forces at the handle/link joint.<br>
It should be appreciated that various changes and modifications<br>
may be made to the embodiment described without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br>
