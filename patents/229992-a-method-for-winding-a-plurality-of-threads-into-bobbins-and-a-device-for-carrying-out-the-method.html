Method and device for winding a plurality of threads<br>
The invention relates to a method for winding a plurality of threads into bobbins , according to the preamble of claim 1, and to a device for carrying out the method, according to the preamble of claim 10.<br>
In the production of synthetic threads, a tendency is increasingly to be observed whereby a multiplicity of threads are spun simultaneously from a polymer melt in parallel and next to one another in a spinning position and are subsequently wound into bobbins. Thus, it is known to spin ten, twelve, sixteen or Bore threads in parallel and wind them simultaneously into bobbins. The winding of the threads may in this case take place by means of bobbin-winding machines in -which the bobbins are held and wound on a bobbin spindle. In the case of relatively large bobbin widths and a high number of threads, the bobbin-winding machines of this type require correspondingly long bobbin spindles. Novel concepts have therefore been developed in which the threads are wound simultaneously into bobbins on two bobbin spindles arranged parallel to one another. Such a method and such a device are known from WO 03/068648 Al.<br>
In the known method and the known device, the threads are wound simultaneously into bobbins on two bobbin spindles arranged next to one another. For this purpose, the bobbin spindles are driven in each case by means of a spindle drive. Bach of the bobbin spindles is assigned one of two pressure rollers which are held in each case radially moveably with respect to the bobbin spindle via a rocker. During the winding of the threads into bobbins, the pressure rollers bear against the circumference of the bobbies With an increasing bobbin diameter,  both the pressure roller and the<br><br>
bobbin spindle can in this case be varied in their position- As a further degree of freedan, the moveably held pressure rollers can additionally be moved radially with respect to the bobbin signals by means of a slide. Moreover, bearing in mind that, as a rule, the threads are wound into bobbins at a constant winding speed, it is necessary for the bobbins to be driven by the bobbin spindle as far as possible at circumferential speeds which remain the same. Due to the multiplicity of degrees of freedom, however, it is unavoidable that the bobbins of the two bobbin spindles have differences in the bobbin make-up.<br>
It is true that DE 40 18 095 Al discloses a method for the winding of threads on a bobbin spindle, in which the rotational speed of the bobbin spindles is regulated as a function of the rotational speed of the pressure roller in such a way that the circumferential speed in each case assumes a constant value. Such regulation of the circumferential speed of the growing bobbins on each of the bobbin spindles leads necessarily to different settings and windings on account of the multiplicity of freedoms of movement. The method known in a prior art and the known device therefore have the disadvantage that each of the bobbin spindles produces bobbins with different bobbin make-ups. Deviations in the circumferential speeds of the bobbins thus lead directly to varied thread tensions during winding.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method and a device of the generic type, in which essentially uniform bobbins are wound on the two bobbin spindles during the simultaneous winding of the threads.<br>
A further aim and object of the irrrention is by winding to generate as identical thread tensions as possible onto threads of the thread set to be wound.<br><br>
The object is achieved, according to the invention,	by<br>
means of a method having the features as claimed	in<br>
claim 1 and by means of a device having the features	as<br>
claimed in claim 10.<br>
Advantageous deve1opments of the invention are defined by  the features and feature combinations of the respective sub claims.<br>
The invention is distinguished in that the variation in the drive rotational speeds of the bobbin spindles during the winding of the bobbins is controlled by means of a common closed loop. The changes in the drive rotational speeds of the bobbin spindles can thus be carried out synchronously- The control of the bobbin spindle drives takes place simultaneously. For this purpose, first, the rotational speed of one of the pressure rollers is detected. By means of a control device, a collective change in the drive rotational speeds of the bobbin spindles is carried out as a function of the respective measured rotational speed of the pressure roller, in such a way that the rotational speed of the detected pressure roller remains essentially constant. The second pressure roller not incorporated in the closed loop is thus automatically put into the same state as the pressure roller monitored by a sensor.<br>
To carry out the method, the device according to the invention has a rotational speed sensor which is assigned to one of the pressure rollers in order to detect the rotational speeds of the latter. The rotational speed sensor is connected to the spindle drives of the bobbin spindles by means of a control device so as to form a closed Loop. The sensor signal can thus be utilized advantageously for activating both spindle drives.<br><br>
So that, as far as possible, both bobbin spindles can be operated at an identical rotational. speed and consequently with identical circumferential speeds of the bobbins, according to an advantageous development of the invention the bobbin spindles are driven and controlled synchronously. For this purpose, the spindle drives are preferably formed by two synchronous motors and a control apparatus, the control apparatus being connected to the control device. This development is distinguished particularly by the flexibility in the arrangement of the pressure rollers and of the bobbin spindles. Thus, the pairings of pressure roller and bobbin spindle could be arranged both next to one another and one above the other. By the variation in rotational speed of one of the pairings between spindle and pressure roller being detected, the synchronous drives of the bobbin spindles lead necessarily to the same control settings in the undetected pairing.<br>
When the threads are being wound and deposited on the circumference of the bobbins, slip phenomena are possible between the circumferential surface of the bobbin and the circumferential surface of the pressure roller. In order to avoid such slip phenomena occurring in a different way on the two pressure rollers, the development of the invention is preferably adopted in which the pressure rollers are coupled to one another mechanically or electrically in such a way that both pressure rollers rotate at the same rotational speed. For coupling, the pressure rollers are connected to one another by a gearing means. The gearing means could be designed mechanically or electrically in order to achieve the rotational speed adaptation of the two pressure rollers.<br>
In  this  case,  the  pressure  rollers  can  also  be additionally driven contradireczionally by means of an<br><br>
external drive, this being conducive particularly to bobbin-changing operations. Preferably, however, the external drive of the pressure rollers is suitable for producing specific load conditions between the driven bobbins and the pressure rollers. Thus, the external drive of the pressure rollers can be designed in such a way that there is always a conveying component or a braking component acting on the circumference of the bobbins. By a load condition being stipulated, the thread tension of the bobbin-wound threads can advantageously be influenced, since defined slip phenomena can be set between the pressure rollers and the bobbins.<br>
The external drives of the pressure rollers are also suitable for driving the bobbin spindles by friction, so that the spindle drives for the direct drive of the bobbin spindles could be dispensed with.<br>
Owing to the increase in the bobbin diameter, a superposed deflecting movement between the bobbin spindles and the pressure rollers must additionally be executed. Such deflecting movements can be executed individually or collectively, basically no contact being lost between the pressure roller and the circumference of the bobbins. A possibility for checking whether contacts are maintained is advantageously afforded by the development of the invention in which the bobbin spindles are driven in each case by means of two asynchronous motors. Due to the load condition predetermined by the external drives of the pressure rollers, the asynchronous motors are operated in the same frequency range. A balancing of the operating states of the asynchronous motors would thus make it possible to direcrly detect incorrect positions causing lack of contact between the pressure roller and the bobbin spindle. Control signals could be<br><br>
generated correspondingly from this which carry out a correction of the deflecting movement.<br>
The deflecting movements can be executed in a simple way such that, during winding, the pressure rollers are guided jointly by a movable holder. Identical settings of the pressure forces in the two bobbin-winding stations can consequently be produced.<br>
It is also possible, however, to guide the pressure rollers independently of one another so as to be movable radially with respect to the bobbins. In this case, the pressure rollers are preferably held by movable rockers which are pivotably held independently of one another on the machine housing or the movable holder.<br>
In principle, however, there is also the possibility that the pressure rollers are held fixedly and the deflecting movements are executed solely by the bobbin spindles. For this purpose, the bobbin spindles may in each case be guided preferably synchronously by means of two movable spindle carriers.<br>
It is also possible, however, to execute the deflecting movement between the pressure rollers and the bobbin spindles for the growth of the bobbins both by means of a movement of the pressure rollers and by means of a movement of the bobbin spindles. Moreover, the use of a movable spindle carrier in the form of a bobbin turret has the advantage that, in each bobbin-winding station, a second bobbin spindle can be held, so that the two bobbin spindles can be guided alternately into a bobbin-winding region and a changing region.<br>
The method according to the invention is explained in more  detail  below  by  means  of  some  exemplary<br><br>
embodiments of the device according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying figures in which:<br>
fig. 1        illustrates a front view and<br>
fig. 2        a diagrammatic rear view  of a first<br>
exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention;<br>
figs 3, 4<br>
and 5         show diagrammatically further exemplary<br>
embodiment s of the device according to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention.<br>
Figs 1 and 2 illustrate a first exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention. In this case, fig. 1 shows a front view and fig. 2 a diagram of the rear view of the exemplary embodiment.<br>
The set-up of the exemplary embodiment is explained first with reference to fig.1.<br>
The exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention has two bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 which are formed next to one another in a machine stand 12. In this case, the bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 are designed mirror-symmetrically with respect to a central plane of symmetry. Thus, the right bobbin-winding station 29.1 consists of a spindle carrier 10.1 mounted rotatably in the machine stand 12. A first projecting bobbin spindle 7.1 and, offset at 180°, a second projecting bobbin spindle 11.1 are held on the spindle carrier 10.1. Is this case, the first bobbin spindle 7.1 is in an operating position for winding one or more threads. The second bobbin spindle<br><br>
11.1	is located in a changing position for the exchange<br>
of a full bobbin for an empty bobbin tube.<br>
Mirror-symmetrically with respect to the spindle carrier 10.1, a second spindle carrier 1G.2 arranged in the same plane or in an offset plane is held in the machine stand 12 in the second bobbin-winding station 29.2. The spindle carrier 10.2 carries the projecting bobbin spindles 7.2 and 11.2. In the operating situation illustrated, the bobbin spindle 7.2 is in the operating position and the bobbin spindle 11.2 is in a changing position.<br>
Each of the spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 is preceded in the thread run in each case by a pressure roller 6.1 and 6.2. In this case, in the bobbin-winding station 29.1, the pressure roller 6.1 cooperates with the bobbin spindle 7.1 in order to wind a thread 1.1 into a bobbin 9.1. During the winding of the thread 1.1, the pressure roller 6.1 bears against the circumference of the bobbin 9.1 to be wound.<br>
In the bobbin-winding station 29.2, the pressure roller 6.2 cooperates correspondingly with the bobbin spindle located in the operating position, in this case 7.2, in order to wind a second thread 1.2 into the bobbin 9.2. In this case, too, the pressure roller 6.2 bears against the circumference of the bobbin 9.2 to be wound.<br>
The pressure rollers 6.1 and 5 - 2 are mounted rotatably and are fastened to a holder 13. The holder 13 carries a traversing device 4 preceding the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2. The traversing device 4 is arranged in a central plane between the bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 and for each bobbin-winding station 29.1 and<br>
29.2	has a traversing thread guide 5.1 and 5.2 by means<br><br>
of which the in running threads 1.1 and 1.2 are shifted to and fro within a traversing stroke.<br>
The traversing device 4 can be formed, for example, by a reverse-threaded shaft which on the circumference has one or more grooves for guiding the traversing thread guides 5.1 and 5.2.<br>
On a top side of the holder 13, a thread guide carrier 3 is provided, which carries the thread guides 2.1 and 2.2. In this case, the thread guide 2.1 is assigned to the bobbin-winding station 29.1 and the thread guide 2.2 is assigned to the bobbin-winding station 29.2.<br>
The holder 13 is designed to be vertically movable by means of a slide 15 and the slide guides 14.1 and 14.2. The slide 15 is in this case held in the slide guides 14.1 and 14.2 by means of two force generators 16.1 and 16.2, in such a way that the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 bear in each case with a predetermined pressure force against the respective bobbins 9.1 and 9.2 during the winding of the threads 1.1 and 1.2,<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in fig. 1, a thread 1.1 and 1.2 is wound into a bobbin 9.1 and 9.2 in each case in the bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2. In principle, however, devices of this type are used for winding a plurality of threads simultaneously into bobbins. For this purpose, a plurality of bobbin tubes 8.1 and 8.2 plugged on one behind the other are held on the bobbin spindles 7.1 and 7.2, In this case, 8, 10 or even more bobbin tubes can be held simultaneously by a bobbin spindle 7.1 and the bobbin spindle 7.2. In this case, the bobbin spindles, the pressure rollers and the traversing device have a corresponding projecting length, so that a plurality of threads can be simultaneously wound in parallel and next to one another.<br><br>
It is unimportant for the method according to the invention, however, whether one thread (as illustrated) or a plurality of threads are wound into bobbins in each case in the bobbin-winding stations 29.1 = 29.2.<br>
For a further explanation of the first exemplary embodiment, the drive situation of the bobbin spindles 7,l and 7.2 is explained below with reference to fig. 2. For the sake of clarity, fig. 2 has illustrated diagrammatically a rear view of only those device parts of the bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 which are required for carrying out the method according to the invention.<br>
In the bobbin-winding station 23.2, the bobbin spindle 7.2 is coupled to a spindle drive 23.2 via a spindle end 22.2. The spindle drive 23.2 is assigned a control apparatus 24.2 which is connected to the overriding control device 21. The bobbin 9.2 wound on the bobbin spindle 7.2 is in this case illustrated by dashes. The freely rotatably mounted pressure roller 6.2, which is likewise illustrated by dashes, bears against the circumference of the bobbin 9.2. The pressure roller 6.2 has a roller end 18.2. The roller end 18.2 is assigned a rotational speed sensor 2 0 by means of which the rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.2 can be detected. The rotational speed sensor 2 0 is connected to the control device 21.<br>
In the other bobbin-winding station 29.1, the bobbin spindle 7.1 is coupled to the spindle drive 23.1 by-means of the spindle end 22.1. The spindle drive 23.1 is assigned a control apparatus 24.1 -which is likewise connected to the control device 21. The bobbin 3.1, likewise illustrated by dashes, which is formed on the circumference of the bobbin spindle 7.1 is in contact with the  second pressure roller 6.1.  The pressure<br><br>
roller 6.1 of the second bobbin-winding station 29.1 is likewise held freely rotatably. The pressure roller 6.1 is in this case coupled with a roller end 18.1 to the pressure roller 6.2 of the other bobbin-winding station 29.2 by a gearing means 19. In this exemplary embodiment, the gearing means 19 is designed mechanically in the form of a belt or chain, so that the two pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 of the two bobbin-winding stations rotate at the same rotational speed.<br>
For a further explanation, then, reference is made to the two figures 1 and 2. For winding the thread 1.1 in the bobbin-winding station 29.1, the bobbin spindle 7.1 is driven clockwise (fig. 1) by the spindle drive 23.1. The pressure roller 6.1 bears against the circumference of the bobbin 9.1 to be wound and is driven in the opposite direction by friction.<br>
In the bobbin-winding station 29.2, the bobbin spindle 7.2 is driven counterclockwise (fig. 1) by the spindle drive 23.2 in order to wind the thread 1.2 into the bobbin 9.2. In this case, the pressure roller 6.2 rotates clockwise on the circumference of the bobbin 9.2 at the corresponding rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1. Rotational transmission between the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 takes place by the gearing means 19. The two bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 are wound synchronously, so that an identical make-up of the bobbins 9.1 and 9.2 takes place on each of the bobbin spindles 7.1 and 7.2.<br>
In order to obtain a constant winding speed of the threads 1.1 and 1.2, the rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.2 is detected continuously by the rotational speed sensor 20 and is fed to the control device 21. A desired rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.2 is filed in the control device 21. As soon<br><br>
as an inadmissible deviation is detected between the sensed actual rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.2 and the filed desired rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.2, a control signal is generated and is fed to the control apparatuses 24.1 and 24.2. The control apparatuses 24.1 and 24.2 vary the drive rotational speeds of the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 in the desired way such that a changed actual rotational speed is obtained on the pressure roller 6.2. A constant circumferential speed of the bobbins 9.1 and 9.2 can thus be set during the entire winding of the threads 1.1 and 1.2. The spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 are in this case preferably formed by asynchronous motors. The rotational speed feedbacks of the asynchronous motors take place preferably by means of a multiplex circuit, so that only one input is required on the control device.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the deflecting movement required during the winding of the threads 1.1 and 1.2 on account of the growth of the bobbins 9.1 and 9.2 can be executed both by means of the moveably held holder 13 and by means of the moveably held bobbin spindles 7.1 and 7.2. Owing to the fixed arrangement of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 on the holder 13, the growth of the bobbins 9.1 and 9.2 can take place synchronously as a result of the movement of the slide 15.<br>
The rotary drives, not illustrated here, of the spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 are likewise preferably operated synchronously in order to perform a deflecting movement, and, for example, the two spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 can thus be coupled to one another by gearing means and be activated by means of one rotary drive.<br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates diagrammatically a further exemplary embodiment for controlling the bobbin spindle drive of the two bobbin-winding stations by the method according to the invention. The exemplary embodiment according to fig. 3 is designed essentially identically to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1 and fig. 2, and therefore only the differences are explained below. In the bobbin-winding station 29.1, the bobbin spindle 7.1 and the pressure roller 6.1 cooperate for the winding of the bobbin 9.1. The pressure roller 6.1 is mounted freely rotatably, a rotational speed sensor 20 being assigned to the roller end 18.1. The rotational speed sensor 20 is connected to the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 by means of the control device 21 so as to form a closed loop. For this purpose, the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 are assigned a control apparatus 24. The spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 are formed in each case by synchronous motors. The control apparatus 24 is coupled to the control device 21.<br>
In the second bobbin-winding station 29.2, the bobbin spindle 7.2 and the pressure roller 6.2 cooperate.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the two pressure rollers<br>
6.1	and 6.2 bear against the circumference of the<br>
bobbins 9.1 and 9.2 to be wound. The bobbins 9.1 and<br>
9.2	are driven in each case by the bobbin spindles 7.1<br>
and 7.2 and the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 connected<br>
to these. The rotational speed of the pressure rollers<br>
6.1 and 6.2  is  thus determined by the respective<br>
circumferential speed of the bobbins 9.1 and 9.2. The<br>
rotational speed of the pressure roller 6,1 is detected<br>
by the rotational speed sensor 2 0 and is fed to the<br>
control  device  21.  An  actual-value/desired-value<br>
comparison takes place in the control device 20. If<br>
there is an inadmissible difference, a control signal<br>
is generated in the control device 21 and is fed to the<br>
control apparatus 24. The spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2<br><br>
are operated at a changed drive rotational speed by means of the control apparatus 24. The change in the drive rotational speed takes place synchronously in both bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2, the variation of the circumferential speed and consequently the variation of the rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1 taking effect in the bobbin-winding station 9.1 and being signaled to the control device 21 via the rotational speed sensor. In contrast to the preceding exemplary embodiment, both pressure rollers 6.1 and 6 .2 of the adjacent bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 are freely rotatable independently of one another. This gives rise to high flexibility in the arrangement of the subassemblies of the two bobbin-winding stations, which is not only restricted to a horizontally designed arrangement.<br>
Figs 4 and 5 illustrate diagrammatic ally further exemplary embodiments for the device according to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention, both exemplary embodiments being essentially identical to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 1. Reference is made to that extent to the preceding description relating to fig. 1 and only the differences are explained below.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 4, the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 of the two bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 are driven by means of an external drive 25. In this case, the external drive 2 5 is formed by a belt drive 26 and an electric motor 28, the electric motor 28 being assigned a control apparatus 27. The control apparatus 27 is coupled to the control device 21. By means of the external drive 25, the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 are driven in opposition in the direction of rotation required for winding.<br><br>
The drive of the bobbin spindles 7.1 and 7.2 and the regulation of the drive rotational speeds of the bobbin spindles take place correspondingly to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 2. Reference is made to that extent to the preceding description, the bobbin-winding stations 29.1 and 29.2 being interchanged in their assignment for the monitoring of the rotational speed.<br>
By means of the external drive 25, a load condition can be set between the drives of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 and the drives of the bobbin spindles 7.1 and 7.2. The pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 can thus exert both a driving action and a braking action on the bobbin surfaces of the bobbins 9.1 and 9.2. The load condition is supplied by the control device 21. In order to avoid, misbehavior in the form of absent contacts during the superposed deflecting movement of the bobbin spindles or of the pressure rollers, a balancing of the actual load conditions can additionally be carried out within the control device 21. For this purpose, the operating states, in particular the drive frequencies of the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2, are fed to the control device 21 via the control apparatuses 24.1, and 24.2. For this purpose, the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 are designed as asynchronous motors. In the event that both bobbin-winding stations 29,1 and 29.2 wind with the prescribed setting, no substantial differences in the operating states of the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 arise. In the event that one of the drives has a deviating drive frequency, a correction of the deflecting movement is carried out, so that a possibly absent contact can be restored.<br><br>
The  exemplary  embodiment  illustrated  in  fig. 5 essentially  identical  to  the - exemplary  embodiment according to fig. 3. In this case, the pressure rollers<br><br>
6.1 and 6.2 are driven by means of an external drive 25 which is formed in this case by two electric motors 28.1 and 28.2 and an assigned control apparatus 27. The electrical coupling of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 by means of an external drive 25 can thus be combined.<br>
The method according to the invention and the device according to the invention are not restricted to the arrangement of the individual assemblies which is illustrated according to fig. 1. In principle, in particular, the pressure rollers in the bobbin-winding stations may be held radially moveably with respect to the bobbin spindle by means of rockers. The holding of the bobbin spindles and of the pressure rollers is critical essentially only for the execution of the deflecting movement. Independently of the deflecting movement, however, the circumferential speed of the bobbins must always be set in such a way that the threads can be wound at an identical winding speed and therefore essentially with a constant thread tension.<br><br>
