				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a propylene/1 -hexene copolymer, a method for its<br>
preparation, and its use for pipes, in particular pressure pipes.<br>
Polymer materials are frequently used for the preparation of pipes for various<br>
purposes, such as fluid transport, e.g. water or natural gas. The transported fluid may<br>
be pressurized and have varying temperature, usually within the range of about 0°C<br>
to about 70°C. Such pipes are typically made of polyolefms. Because of the high<br>
temperatures involved, hot water pipes made from polyolefms have to meet specific<br>
requirements. The temperature in a hot water pipe might range from 30°C to 70°C.<br>
However, peak temperature can be up to 100°C. To secure long term use, the<br>
selected pipe material must be able to withstand a temperature exceeding the range<br>
mentioned above, According to the standard DIN 8078, a hot water pipe made of<br>
propylene homo- or copolymer must have a run time of at least 1000 h without<br>
failure at 95°C and a pressure of 3.5 MPa.<br>
Due to its high thermal resistance, if compared to other polyolefms, polypropylene is<br>
particularly useful for applications at increased temperature, such as hot water pipes.<br>
However, besides thermal resistance, a polypropylene useful for pipe applications<br>
needs to have high stiffness in combination with high resistance to slow crack<br>
growth.<br>
There are two different cracking modes of polypropylene pipes: ductile or brittle<br>
failure.<br>
Ductile failure is associated with macroscopic yielding, i.e. there is a large material<br>
pull out adjacent to the location of failure.<br>
However, the majority of cracking taking place in polypropylene pipes is of brittle<br>
type and does not exhibit large deformation. Brittle failure usually occurs under low<br>
stress and takes a long time to propagate through the material via the process of slow<br><br><br>
crack growth. Such type of failure is the least-desirable since it is difficult to detect at<br>
an early stage.<br>
Thus, for any polypropylene being useful for pipe applications, in particular pressure<br>
pipe applications, it is desired to have a beneficial compromise between high<br>
resistance to slow crack growth, thermal resistance, rigidity, and impact strength.<br>
However, quite frequently it turns out that one of these properties can only be<br>
achieved on the expense of the other properties.<br>
Pipes made of propylene homopolymer show high thermal resistance in combination<br>
with high rigidity whereas resistance to slow crack growth is lowered. Slow crack<br>
growth properties can be improved by using propylene copolymers. However, the<br>
incorporation of comonomers into the polypropylene chain has a detrimental impact<br>
on thermal resistance and rigidity, an effect that needs to be compensated by mixing<br>
with an additional propylene homopolymer component. Furthermore, the higher the<br>
comonomer content, the higher is the risk that polymeric material is washed out by<br>
the transport fluid.<br>
WO 2005/040271 A1 discloses a pressure pipe comprising a resin formed from (i) a<br>
random copolymer comprising units of propylene and a C2 to CIO alpha-olefin, and<br>
(ii) a propylene-ethylene elastomer.<br>
WO 2006/002778 Al discloses a pipe system having at least one layer comprising a<br>
semi-crystalline random copolymer of propylene and 1-hexene. The copolymer<br>
exhibits a broad monomodal molecular weight distribution and has a rather high<br>
content of xylene solubles.<br><br><br>
WO 03/042260 discloses a pressure pipe made from a propylene copolymer which is<br>
at least partially crystallized in the p-modification.<br>
Considering the requirements of pressure pipe materials discussed above, it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a polypropylene having a high resistance to<br>
slow crack propagation while still keeping thermal resistance and rigidity on a high<br>
level. Furthermore, it is desired to minimize the potential risk of washing out<br>
polymeric material from the pipe by the pressurized fluid.<br>
The finding of the present invention is to provide a pVnucleated propylene 1-hexene<br>
copolymer with low amounts of xylene solubles.<br>
Thus the object outlined above is in particular solved by a propylene copolymer (A)<br>
(a)	comprising at least 1-hexene as a comonomer,<br>
(b)	having a comonomer content in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 wt-%,<br>
(c)	having a xylene soluble fraction equal or below 2.5 wt.-%, and<br>
(d)	being partially crystallized in the P-modification, preferably having a<br>
P-modification of at least 50 %.<br>
Preferably the copolymer (A) comprises a p-nucleating agent (B).<br>
Alternatively the present invention can be defined by a propylene copolymer (A)<br>
(a)	comprising at least 1-hexene as a comonomer,<br>
(b)	having a comonomer content in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 wt-%, and<br>
(c)	having a xylene soluble fraction equal or below 2.5 wt-%,<br>
wherein the propylene copolymer (A) comprises additionally a p-<br>
nucleating agent (B).<br><br><br>
Surprisingly it has been found out that with said propylene copolymer (A) pipes are<br>
obtainable having superior slow crack propagation performance compared to pipes<br>
being state of the art. Moreover not only the slow crack propagation performance of<br>
the pipes based on the inventive propylene copolymer (A) is outstanding but<br>
additionally also the stiffness and the impact performance of the pipe and of the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) are excellent. In particular the Izod impact resistance at<br>
low temperatures and the flexural modulus are above average (compare table 5).<br>
The present invention demands specific requirements for the inventive materials,<br>
which are described in the following in more detail.<br>
One important requirement of the present invention is that the propylene copolymer<br>
(A) has a rather low xylene soluble fraction.<br>
Xylene solubles are the part of the polymer soluble in cold xylene determined by<br>
dissolution in boiling xylene and letting the insoluble part crystallize from the<br>
cooling solution (for the method see below in the experimental part). The xylene<br>
solubles fraction contains polymer chains of low stereo-regularity and is an<br>
indication for the amount of non-crystalline areas.<br>
Accordingly it is preferred that the xylene solubles of the inventive propylene<br>
copolymer (A) is equal or less than 2.5 wt.-%, more preferably less than 2.3 wt.-%<br>
and yet more preferably less than 2.2 wt.-%. In preferred embodiments the xylene<br>
solubles are in the range of 0.1 to 2.5 wt.-% and more preferably in the range of 0.1<br>
to 2.3 wt.-%.<br>
As further requirement of the present invention is the inventive propylene copolymer<br>
(A) must be 6-nucleated, i.e. the propylene copolymer (A) must be partially<br><br>
crystallized in the ß-modification. Thus it is preferred that the amount of ß-<br>
modification of the propylene copolymer (A) is at least 50 %, more preferably at<br>
least 60 %, still more preferably at least 65 %, yet more preferably at least 70 %, still<br>
yet more preferably at least 80 %, like about 90 % (determined by DSC using the<br>
second heat as described in detail in the example section).<br>
Of course the propylene copolymer (A) may also comprise B-nucleating agents (B).<br>
As β-nucleating agent (B) any nucleating agent can be used which is suitable for<br>
inducing crystallization of the propylene copolymer (A) in the hexagonal or pseudo-<br>
hexagonal modification. Preferred p-nucleating agents (B) are those listed below,<br>
which also includes their mixtures.<br>

•	dicarboxylic acid salts of metals from group IIa of periodic system, e. g.<br>

•	mixtures of dicarboxylic acids and salts of metals from group IIa of periodic<br>
system.<br>
Still further suitable β-nucleating agents (B) are<br>
•	salts of metals from group IIa of periodic system and imido acids of the<br>
formula<br><br>
wherein x = 1 to 4; R = H,-COOH, C1-C12-alkyl, C5-C8-cycloalkyl or C6-C12-<br>
aryl, and Y =C1-C12-alkyl, C5-C8-cycloalkyl or C6-C12-aryl-substituted<br>
bivalent C6-C12-aromatic residues, e. g.<br>
calcium salts of phthaloylglycine, hexahydrophthaloylglycine, N-<br>
phthaloylalanine and/or N-4-methylphthaloylglycine.<br><br><br>
Preferred β-nucleating agents (B) are any one or mixtures of N, N'-dicyclohexyl-2, 6-<br>
naphthalene dicarboxamide, quinacridone type or pimelic acid calcium-salt<br>
(EP 0 682 066).<br>
The amount of ß-nucleating agents (B) within the propylene copolymer (B) is<br>
preferably up to 2.0 wt-%, more preferably up to 1.5 wt.-%, like 1.0 wt.-%. Thus it<br>
is appreciated that the B-nucleating agents (B) are present within the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) from 0.0001 to 2.0000 wt.-%, more preferably from 0.0001 to<br>
2.0000 wt.-%f, yet more preferably from 0.005 to 0.5000 wt.-%.<br>
In this context it is mentioned that the polypropylene copolymer (A) may comprise<br>
additives as usual in the art. However, the polypropylene copolymer (A) does not<br>
comprise further other polymer types. Thus the propylene copolymer (A) can be seen<br>
as a composition of said propylene polymer (A) and the B-nucleating agents (B) and<br>
optionally further additives, but without other polymers.<br>
Accordingly the propylene polymer (A) may comprise up to 10 wt.-% additives,<br>
which includes the mandatory B-nucleating agents (B) but optionally also fillers<br>
and/or stabilizers and/or processing aids and/or antistatic agents and/or pigments<br>
and/or reinforcing agents.<br>
Further it is mandatory that the polypropylene copolymer (A) comprises at least 1-<br>
hexene as comonomer.<br>
However, the propylene copolymer (A) may comprise further a-olefin(s), like C2,<br>
C4, C5, or C7 to C10 a-olefin(s). In such a case ethylene is in particular preferred.<br>
Thus in one preferred embodiment the propylene copolymer (A) is a terpolymer<br>
comprising propylene, 1-hexene and ethylene. However, it is more preferred that the<br><br><br>
propylene copolymer (A) does not comprise further comonomer(s), i.e. 1-hexene is<br>
the only comonomer of the propylene copolymer (A) (binary propylene-hexene<br>
copolymer).<br>
Thus the binary propylene-1-hexene copolymer is particularly preferred.<br>
More preferably the above defined propylene copolymer (A) is a random copolymer.<br>
Thus a random propylene copolymer according to the present invention is a random<br>
propylene copolymer produced by statistical insertion of units of 1-hexene (if present<br>
with units of ethylene or a C4, C5, or C7 to C10 α-olefin, preferably ethylene, to give<br>
a random terpolymer).<br>
The type of comonomer has a significant influence on a number of properties like<br>
crystallization behaviour, stiffness, melting point or flowability of the polymer melt.<br>
Thus to solve the objects of the present invention, in particular to provide an<br>
improved balance between stiffness, impact resistance and slow crack propagation<br>
performance it is necessary that the propylene copolymer comprises 1-hexene as a<br>
comonomer at least in a detectable manner, in particular of at least 1.0 wt.-%.<br>
On the other hand the increase of the comonomer content, in particular of 1-hexene,<br>
in the propylene copolymer (A) is associated with the increase of the xylene solubles<br>
fraction and thus the potential risk of washing out polymeric material from the pipe<br>
by the pressurized fluid. Moreover with increase of comonomer in the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) the stiffness drops undesirably.<br>
Thus, to achieve especially good results the propylene copolymer (A) comprises<br>
preferably not more than up to 3.0 wt-% comonomer, in particular 1-hexene, based<br>
on the weight of the propylene copolymer (A). As stated above the comonomer 1-<br><br><br>
hexene is mandatory whereas other a-olefins can be additionally present. However<br>
the amount of additional a-olefins shall preferably not exceed the amount of 1-<br>
hexene in the propylene copolymer (A). More preferably the amount of comonomer,<br>
in particular of 1-hexene, within the propylene copolymer is equal or below 2.2 wt-<br>
%, still more preferably equal or below 2.0 wt.-% and yet more preferably equal or<br>
below 1.8 wt.-%. Accordingly the amount of comonomer, in particular 1-hexene,<br>
within the propylene copolymer (A) is from 1.0 to 3.0 wt.-%, more preferably from<br>
1.0 to 2.2 wt.-%, still more preferably from 1.0 to 2.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably of<br>
1.0 to 1.9 wt.-%, yet still more preferably of 1.0 to 1.8 wt.-%. In a particular<br>
preferred embodiment the amount of comonomer, in particular 1-hexene, is 1.0 to 1.8<br>
wt.-%, more preferred 1.1 to 1.6 wt.-%.<br>
In case the propylene copolymer (A) is a binary propylene-1-hexene copolymer - an<br>
embodiment which is particularly preferred - the ranges as defined in the previous<br>
paragraph refer to 1-hexene only.<br>
The comonomer content of the propylene copolymer (A) can be determined with FT<br>
infrared spectroscopy, as described below in the examples.<br>
Additionally it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) is an isotactic<br>
propylene copolymer. Thus it is preferred that the propylene copolymer has a rather<br>
high pentad concentration, i.e. higher than 90 %, more preferably higher than 92 %,<br>
still more preferably higher than 95 % and yet more preferably higher than 98 %.<br>
Additionally it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) is not chemically<br>
modified as it is known for instance from high melt strength polymers (HMS-<br>
polymer). Thus the propylene copolymer (A) is not cross-linked. The impact<br>
behaviour can normally also improved by using branched polypropylenes as for<br><br><br>
instance described in EP 0 787 750, i.e. single branched polypropylene types (Y-<br>
polypropylenes having a backbone with a single long side-chain and an architecture<br>
resembles a "Y"). Such polypropylenes are characterized by rather high melt<br>
strength. A parameter of the degree of branching is the branching index g'. The<br>
branching index g1 correlates with the amount of branches of a polymer. The<br>
branching index g' is defined as g'=[rV]br/[IV]iin in which g' is the branching index,<br>
[IVbr] is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polypropylene and [IV]iin is the<br>
intrinsic viscosity of the linear polypropylene having the same weight average<br>
molecular weight (within a range of ±10 %) as the branched polypropylene. Thereby,<br>
a low g'-value is an indicator for a high branched polymer. In other words, if the g'-<br>
value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene increases. Reference is made in<br>
this context to B.H. Zimm and W.H. Stockmeyer, J. Chem. Phys. 17,1301 (1949).<br>
This document is herewith included by reference. Thus it is preferred that the<br>
branching index g' of the propylene copolymer (A) shall be at least 0.85, more<br>
preferably at least 0.90, yet more preferably at least 0.95, like 1.00.<br>
It is further appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) must show a rather broad<br>
molecular weight distribution (MWD). A broad molecular weight distribution<br>
(MWD) of propylene copolymer (A) is appreciated as it supports the improved<br>
stiffness behaviour of the propylene copolymer (A). It may also improve the<br>
processability of the propylene copolymer (A).<br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) can be measured by SEC (also known as<br>
GPC), whereby it is expressed as Mw/Mn, or by a Theological measurement, like<br>
Polydispersity Index (PI) - measurement or Shear Thinning Index (SHI) -<br>
measurement. In the present case primarily the Polydispersity Index (PI) is used as<br>
measurement. All the measurements are known in art and further defined below in<br>
the example section.<br><br>
Thus the propylene copolymer (A) has preferably a Polydispersity Index (PI) of at<br>
least 3.0, preferably of at least 3.5 more preferably of at least 4.0, still more<br>
preferably of at least 4.2. Upper values of the Polydispersity Index (PI) may be 8.0,<br>
like 6.0. Thus the Polydispersity Index (PI) of the propylene copolymer (A) is<br>
preferably in the range of 3.0 to 8.0, more preferably in the range of 3.5 to 7.0, yet<br>
more preferably in the range of 3.5 to 6.0.<br>
A further indicator for a broad molecular weight distribution of the inventive<br>
propylene copolymer (A) is the weight average molecular weight (Mw). The weight<br>
average molecular weight (Mw) is the first moment of a plot of the weight of polymer<br>
in each molecular weight range against molecular weight.<br>
The weight average molecular weight (Mw) is determined by size exclusion<br>
chromatography (SEC) using Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument with online<br>
viscosimeter. The oven temperature is 145 °C. Trichlorobenzene is used as a solvent<br>
(ISO 16014).<br>
It is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) has a weight average molecular<br>
weight (Mw) of at least 500,000 g/mol, more preferably of at least 600,000 g/mol.<br>
Preferred ranges are from 650,000 g/mol to 1,500,000 g/mol, more preferably from<br>
750,000 to 1,200,000 g/mol.<br>
Moreover the propylene copolymer (A) can be monomodal or multimodal, like<br>
bimodal.<br>
The expression "multimodal" or "bimodal" used herein refers to the modality of the<br>
polymer, i.e. the form of its molecular weight distribution curve, which is the graph<br><br><br>
of the molecular weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight. As will be<br>
explained below, the polymer components of the present invention can be produced<br>
in a sequential step process, using reactors in serial configuration and operating at<br>
different reaction conditions. As a consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific<br>
reactor will have its own molecular weight distribution. When the molecular weight<br>
distribution curves from these fractions are superimposed to obtain the molecular<br>
weight distribution curve of the final polymer, that curve may show two or more<br>
maxima or at least be distinctly broadened when compared with curves for the<br>
individual fractions. Such a polymer, produced in two or more serial steps, is called<br>
bimodal or multimodal, depending on the number of steps.<br>
In any case the Polydispersity Index (PI) and/or the weight average molecular weight<br>
(Mw) of the propylene copolymer (A) as defined in the instant invention refer(s) to<br>
the total propylene copolymer (A) be it monomodal or multimodal, like bimodal.<br>
Preferably the comonomer content, like 1 -hexene content, is higher in the high<br>
molecular weight fractions compared to the low molecular weight fractions. Thus the<br>
comonomer content, like 1 -hexene content, in the fraction having an intrinsic<br>
viscosity of equal to higher than 3.3 dl/g is higher than in the fraction having an<br>
intrinsic viscosity of less than 3.3 dl/g.<br>
Further it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) has a rather low melt flow<br>
rate. The melt flow rate mainly depends on the average molecular weight. This is due<br>
to the fact that long molecules render the material a lower flow tendency than short<br>
molecules. An increase in molecular weight means a decrease in the MFR-value. The<br>
melt flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 min of the polymer discharged through a<br>
defined die under specified temperature and pressure conditions and the measure of<br>
viscosity of the polymer which, in turn, for each type of polymer is mainly<br><br><br>
influenced by its molecular weight but also by its degree of branching. The melt flow<br>
rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C (ISO 1133) is denoted as<br>
MFR2 (230 °C).<br>
Thus it is required that propylene copolymer (A) has a melt flow rate (MFR2<br>
(230 C)) equal or below 0.8 g/10min, more preferred of equal or less than<br>
0.5 g/10min, still more preferred equal or less than 0.4 g/lOmin. On the other hand<br>
the MFR2 (230 °C) should be more than 0.05 g/10min, more preferably more than<br>
0.1g/10min.<br>
In case the melt flow rate is measured under a load of 5 kg the following is preferred.<br>
The propylene copolymer (A) has preferably a melt flow rate (MFR5 (230 C)) equal<br>
or below 4.0 g/10min, more preferred of equal or less than 2.5 g/10min, still more<br>
preferred equal or less than 1.8 g/10min. On the other hand the MFR2 (230 °C)<br>
should be more than 0.1 g/10min, more preferably more than 0.3 g/10min.<br>
Accordingly a preferred range is from 0.3 to 1.8 g/10min.<br>
Additionally it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) enables to provide<br>
pipes with a rather high resistance to deformation, i.e. have a high stiffness.<br>
Accordingly it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) in an injection molded<br>
state and/or the pipes based on said material has(have) a flexural modulus measured<br>
according to ISO 178 of at least 950 MPa, more preferably of at least 1000 MPa, yet<br>
more preferably of at least 1100 MPa<br>
Furthermore it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) enables to provide<br>
pipes having a rather high impact strength. Accordingly it is preferred that propylene<br>
copolymer (A) in an injection molded state and/or the pipes based on said material<br><br><br>
has(have) an impact strength measured according the Charpy impact test (ISO 179<br>
(leA)) at 23 °C of at least 35.0 kJ/m2, more preferably of at least 40.0 kJ/m2, yet<br>
more preferably of at least 41.0 kJ/m2 and/or an high impact strength measured<br>
according the Charpy impact test (ISO 179 (leA)) at -20°C of at least 1.5 kJ/m2,<br>
more preferably of at least 1.8 kJ/m2, yet more preferably of at least 2.0 kJ/m2.<br>
The instant propylene copolymer (A) has been in particular developed to improve the<br>
properties of pipes, in particular in terms of very good slow crack propagation<br>
performance by keeping the other properties, like resistance to deformation and<br>
impact strength, on a high level. Thus the instant invention is also directed to the use<br>
of the propylene copolymer (A) for a pipe, like a pressure pipe, or for parts of a pipe,<br>
like a pressure pipe, and for the manufacture of pipes.<br>
In addition it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) enables to provide<br>
pipes having a very good slow crack propagation performance. Thus it is preferred<br>
that the propylene copolymer (A) and/or the pipes based on said material has(have) a<br>
slow crack propagation performance measured according to the full notch creep test<br>
(FNCT) (ISO 16770; at 80 °C and applied stress of 4.0 MPa) of at least 7000 h.<br>
The propylene copolymer (A) may comprise - in addition to the P-nucleating agents -<br>
further additives, like fillers not interacting with the P-nucleating agents, e.g. mica<br>
and/or chalk<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is also directed to pipes and/or pipe fittings, in<br>
particular pressure pipes, comprising the propylene copolymer (A) as defined in the<br>
instant invention. These pipes, in particular pressure pipes, are in particular<br>
characterized by the flexural modulus, impact strength and slow crack propagation<br>
performance as defined in the previous paragraphs.<br><br><br>
The term "pipe" as used herein is meant to encompass hollow articles having a length<br>
greater than diameter. Moreover the term "pipe" shall also encompass supplementary<br>
parts like fittings, valves and all parts which are commonly necessary for e.g. a hot<br>
water piping system.<br>
Pipes according to the invention also encompass single and multilayer pipes, where<br>
for example one or more of the layers is a metal layer and which may include an<br>
adhesive layer.<br>
The propylene copolymer (A) used for pipes according to the invention may contain<br>
usual auxiliary materials, e. g. up to 10 wt.-% fillers and/or 0.01 to 2.5 wt.-%<br>
stabilizers and/or 0.01 to 1 wt.-% processing aids and/or 0.1 to 1 wt.-% antistatic<br>
agents and/or 0.2 to 3 wt.-% pigments and/or reinforcing agents, e. g. glass fibres, in<br>
each case based on the propylene copolymer (A) used (the wt.-% given in this<br>
paragraph refer to the total amount of the pipe and/or a pipe layer comprising said<br>
propylene copolymer (A)). In this respect, it has to be noted, however, that any of<br>
such of auxiliary materials which serve as highly active a-nucleating agents, such as<br>
certain pigments, are not utilized in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) as defined above is<br>
produced in the presence of the catalyst as defined below. Furthermore, for the<br>
production of propylene copolymer (A) as defined above, the process as stated below<br>
is preferably used.<br>
Thus the manufacture of the inventive propylene copolymer (A) comprises the steps<br>
of:<br><br><br>
(a)	producing a propylene copolymer (A) as defined herein, preferably in<br>
a multistage process and subsequently<br>
(b)	treating the propylene copolymer (A) with a P-nucleating agent (B),<br>
preferably at temperatures in the range of 175 to 300 °C, and<br>
(c)	cooling and crystallizing the propylene copolymer (A) composition.<br>
In the following the process will be described in more detail.<br>
Preferably the propylene copolymer (A) is produced in the presence of a Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalyst, in particular in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst capable of<br>
catalyzing polymerization of propylene at a pressure of 10 to 100 bar, in particular 25<br>
to 80 bar, and at a temperature of 40 to 110 °C, in particular of 60 to 100 °C.<br>
Generally, the Ziegler-Natta catalyst used in the present invention comprises a<br>
catalyst component, a cocatalyst component, an external donor, the catalyst<br>
component of the catalyst system primarily containing magnesium, titanium, halogen<br>
and an internal donor. Electron donors control the stereo-specific properties and/or<br>
improve the activity of the catalyst system. A number of electron donors including<br>
ethers, esters, polysilanes, polysiloxanes, and alkoxysilanes are known in the art.<br>
The catalyst preferably contains a transition metal compound as a procatalyst<br>
component. The transition metal compound is selected from the group consisting of<br>
titanium compounds having an oxidation degree of 3 or 4, vanadium compounds,<br>
zirconium compounds, cobalt compounds, nickel compounds, tungsten compounds<br>
and rare earth metal compounds. The titanium compound usually is a halide or<br>
oxyhalide, an organic metal halide, or a purely metal organic compound in which<br>
only organic ligands have been attached to the transition metal. Particularly preferred<br><br><br>
are the titanium halides, especially titanium tetrachloride, titanium trichloride and<br>
titanium tetrachloride being particularly preferred.<br>
Magnesium dichloride can be used as such or it can be combined with silica, e.g. by<br>
absorbing the silica with a solution or slurry containing magnesium dichloride. The<br>
lower alcohol used may preferably be methanol or ethanol, particularly ethanol.<br>
One preferred catalyst to be used according to the invention is disclosed in<br>
EP 591 224 which discloses a method for preparing a pro-catalyst composition from<br>
magnesium dichloride, a titanium compound, a lower alcohol and an ester of phthalic<br>
acid containing at least five carbon atoms. According to EP 591 224, a trans-<br>
esterification reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature between the lower<br>
alcohol and the phthalic acid ester, whereby the ester groups from the lower alcohol<br>
and the phthalic ester change places.<br>
The alkoxy group of the phthalic acid ester used comprises at least five carbon<br>
atoms, preferably at least eight carbon atoms. Thus, as the ester may be used<br>
propylhexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, di-isodecyl phthalate and ditridecyl<br>
phthalate. The molar ratio of phthalic acid ester and magnesium halide is preferably<br>
about 0.2:1.<br>
The transesterification can be carried out, e.g. by selecting a phthalic acid ester - a<br>
lower alcohol pair, which spontaneously or by the aid of a catalyst, which does not<br>
damage the pro-catalyst composition, transesterifies the catalyst at an elevated<br>
temperature. It is preferred to carry out the transesterification at a temperature which<br>
is 110 to 115 °C, preferably 120 to 140 °C.<br><br><br>
The catalyst is used together with an organometallic cocatalyst and with an external<br>
donor. Generally, the external donor has the formula<br>
R„R'mSi(R"O)4<br>
-n-m<br>
wherein<br>
R and R' can be the same or different and represent a linear, branched or cyclic<br>
aliphatic, or aromatic group;<br>
R" is methyl or ethyl;<br>
n is an integer of 0 to 3;<br>
m is an integer of 0 to 3; and<br>
n+mis 1 to 3.<br>
In particular, the external donor is selected from the group consisting of cyclohexyl<br>
methylmethoxy silane (CHMMS), dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane (DCPDMS),<br>
diisopropyl dimethoxy silane, di-isobutyl dimethoxy silane, and di-t-butyl dimethoxy<br>
silane.<br>
An organoaluminium compound is used as a cocatalyst. The organoaluminium<br>
compound is preferably selected from the group consisting of trialkyl aluminium,<br>
dialkyl aluminium chloride and alkyl aluminium sesquichloride.<br>
According to the invention, such catalysts are typically introduced into the first<br>
reactor only. The components of the catalyst can be fed into the reactor separately or<br>
simultaneously or the components of the catalyst system can be precontacted prior to<br>
the reactor.<br>
Such pre-contacting can also include a catalyst pre-polymerization prior to feeding<br>
into the polymerization reactor. In the pre-polymerization, the catalyst components<br>
are contacted for a short period with a monomer before feeding to the reactor.<br><br><br>
As stated above, the propylene copolymer (A) can have a unimodal or multimodal,<br>
like bimodal, molar mass distribution (MWD). Thus, the equipment of the<br>
polymerization process can comprise any polymerization reactors of conventional<br>
design for producing propylene copolymers (A). For the purpose of the present<br>
invention "slurry reactor" designates any reactor, such as a continuous or simple<br>
batch stirred tank reactor or loop reactor, operating in bulk or slurry and in which the<br>
polymer forms in particulate form. "Bulk" means a polymerization in reaction<br>
medium that comprises at least 60 wt.-% monomer. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment the slurry reactor comprises (is) a bulk loop reactor. By "gas phase<br>
reactor" is meant any mechanically mixed or fluid bed reactor. Preferably the gas<br>
phase reactor comprises a mechanically agitated fluid bed reactor with gas velocities<br>
of at least 0.2 m/sec.<br>
Thus, the polymerization reactor system can comprise one or more conventional<br>
stirred tank slurry reactors, as described in WO 94/26794, and/or one or more gas<br>
phase reactors.<br>
Preferably the reactors used are selected from the group of loop and gas phase<br>
reactors and, in particular, the process employs at least one loop reactor and at least<br>
one gas phase reactor. This alternative is particularly suitable for producing the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) with a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD)<br>
according to this invention. By carrying out the polymerization in the different<br>
polymerization reactors in the presence of different amounts of hydrogen the MWD<br>
of the product can be broadened and its mechanical properties improved. It is also<br>
possible to use several reactors of each type, e.g. one loop reactor and two or three<br>
gas phase reactors or two loop reactors and one gas phase reactor, in series.<br><br><br>
In addition to the actual polymerization reactors used for producing the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) the polymerization reaction system can also include a number of<br>
additional reactors, such as pre- and/or post-reactors. The pre-reactors include any<br>
reactor for pre-polymerizing the catalyst with propylene. The post-reactors include<br>
reactors used for modifying and improving the properties of the polymer product.<br>
All reactors of the reactor system are preferably arranged in series.<br>
The gas phase reactor can be an ordinary fluidized bed reactor, although other types<br>
of gas phase reactors can be used. In a fluidized bed reactor, the bed consists of the<br>
formed and growing polymer particles as well as still active catalyst come along with<br>
the polymer fraction. The bed is kept in a fluidized state by introducing gaseous<br>
components, for instance monomer on such flowing rate which will make the<br>
particles act as a fluid. The fluidizing gas can contain also inert carrier gases, like<br>
nitrogen and also hydrogen as a modifier. The fluidized gas phase reactor can be<br>
equipped with a mechanical mixer.<br>
The gas phase reactor used can be operated in the temperature range of 50 to 115 °C,<br>
preferably between 60 and 110 °C and the reaction pressure between 5 and 50 bar<br>
and the partial pressure of monomer between 2 and 45 bar.<br>
The pressure of the effluent, i.e. the polymerization product including the gaseous<br>
reaction medium, can be released after the gas phase reactor in order optionally to<br>
separate part of the gaseous and possible volatile components of the product, e.g. in a<br>
flash tank. The overhead stream or part of it is re-circulated to the reactor.<br>
After the polymerization the propylene copolymer (A) is blended with the P-<br>
nucleating agent (B) as defined above to obtain the propylene copolymer (A). The<br><br>
mixing can be carried out by methods known per se, e.g. by mixing the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) with the β-nucleating agent (B) in the desired weight relationship<br>
using a batch or a continuous process. As examples of typical batch mixers the<br>
Banbury and the heated roll mill can be mentioned. Continuous mixers are<br>
exemplified by the Farrel mixer, the Buss co-kneader, and single- or twin-screw<br>
extruders.<br>
In case pipes shall be produced of the propylene copolymer (A) than after the<br>
manufacture of the inventive material the following steps follow. In general the<br>
inventive propylene copolymer (A) is extruded and subsequently formed into a pipe.<br>
Accordingly the inventive pipe is preferably produced by first plasticizing the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) of the instant invention in an extruder at temperatures in<br>
the range of from 200 to 300 °C and then extruding it through an annular die and<br>
cooling it.<br>
The extruders for producing the pipe can be single screw extruders with an L/D of 20<br>
to 40 or twin screw extruders or extruder cascades of homogenizing extruders (single<br>
screw or twin screw). Optionally, a melt pump and/or a static mixer can be used<br>
additionally between the extruder and the ring die head. Ring shaped dies with<br>
diameters ranging from approximately 16 to 2000 mm and even greater are possible.<br>
The melt arriving from the extruder is first distributed over an annular cross-section<br>
via conically arranged holes and then fed to the core/die combination via a coil<br>
distributor or screen. If necessary, restrictor rings or other structural elements for<br>
ensuring uniform melt flow may additionally be installed before the die outlet. After<br>
leaving the annular die, the pipe is taken off over a calibrating mandrel, usually<br><br><br>
accompanied by cooling of the pipe by air cooling and/or water cooling, optionally<br>
also with inner water cooling.<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail by the examples<br>
provided below.<br>
Examples<br>
Definitions/Measuring Methods<br>
The following definitions of terms and determination methods apply for the above<br>
general description of the invention as well as to the below examples unless<br>
otherwise defined.<br>
Melting temperature and degree of crystallinity<br>
Melting temperature Tm, crystallization temperature Tcr, and the degree of<br>
crystallinity were measured with Mettler TA820 differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC) on 5 to 10 mg, typically 8±0.5 mg samples. Both crystallization and melting<br>
curves were obtained during 10°C/min cooling and heating scans between 30°C and<br>
225°C. Melting and crystallization temperatures were taken as the peaks of<br>
endotherms and exotherms. The degree of crystallinity was calculated by comparison<br>
with heat of fusion of a perfectly crystalline polypropylene, i.e. 209 J/g.<br>
Number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw)<br>
and molecular weight distribution (MWD) are determined by Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatography (GPC) according to the following method:<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight distribution<br>
(MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight and Mw is<br>
the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a method based on ISO 16014-<br><br><br>
1:2003 and ISO 16014-4:2003. A Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument, equipped<br>
with refractive index detector and online viscosimeter was used with 3 x TSK-gel<br>
columns (GMHXL-HT) from TosoHaas and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized<br>
with 200 mg/L 2,6-Di tert butyl-4-methyl-phenol) as solvent at 145 °C and at a<br>
constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. 216.5 uL of sample solution were injected per<br>
analysis. The column set was calibrated using relative calibration with 19 narrow<br>
MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the range of 0.5 kg/mol to 11 500 kg/mol and a<br>
set of well characterised broad polypropylene standards. All samples were prepared<br>
by dissolving 5 -10 mg of polymer in 10 mL (at 160 °C) of stabilized TCB (same as<br>
mobile phase) and keeping for 3 hours with continuous shaking prior sampling in<br>
into the GPC instrument.<br>
Rheology: Dynamic rheological measurements were carried out with Rheometrics<br>
RDA-II QC on compression molded samples under nitrogen atmosphere at 200°C<br>
using 25 mm -diameter plate and plate geometry. The oscillatory shear experiments<br>
were done within the linear viscoelastic range of strain at frequencies from 0.01 to<br>
500 rad/s. (IS06721-1)<br>
The values of storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G"), complex modulus (G*) and<br>
complex viscosity (η*) were obtained as a function of frequency (ω).<br>
The Zero shear viscosity (η0) was calculated using complex fluidity defined as the<br>
reciprocal of complex viscosity. Its real and imaginary part are thus defined by<br><br><br><br>
The polydispersity index, PI, is calculated from cross-over point of G'(ω) and<br>
G"(ω).<br>
There is a linear correlation between f'and f' with zero ordinate value of 1 /η0<br>
(Heino et al.1)<br>
For polypropylene this is valid at low frequencies and five first points (5<br>
points/decade) are used in calculation of η0.<br>
Shear thinning indexes (SHI), which are correlating with MWD and are<br>
independent of MW, were calculated according to Heino 1,2) (below).<br>
SHI<br>
SHI is calculated by dividing the Zero Shear Viscosity by a complex viscosity value,<br>
obtained at a certain constant shear stress value, G*. The abbreviation, SHI (0/50), is<br>
the ratio between the zero shear viscosity and the viscosity at the shear stress of 50<br>
000 Pa.<br>

The 13C-NMR spectra of polypropylenes were recorded on Bruker 400MHz<br>
spectrometer at 130 °C from samples dissolved in l,2,4-trichlorobenzene/benzene-d6<br>
(90/10 w/w). For the pentad analysis the assignment is done according to the<br>
methods described in literature: (T. Hayashi, Y. Inoue, R. Chujo, and T. Asakura,<br>

Melt Flow Rate (MFR2)<br>
The melt flow rates were measured with a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C. The melt flow<br>
rate is that quantity of polymer in grams which the test apparatus standardized to ISO<br>
1133 extrudes within 10 minutes at a temperature of 230 °C under aload of 2.16 kg.<br>

baseline corrected peak maxima of a quantitative band at 727 cm-1, with the baseline<br>

The comonomer content C was determined using a film thickness method using the<br>
intensity of the quantitative band I(q) and the thickness of the pressed film T using<br><br><br>
the following relationship: [ I(q) / T ]m + c = C where m and c are the coefficients<br>
determined from the calibration curve constructed using the comonomer contents<br>
obtained from 13C NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Content of ß-modification:<br>
The ß-crystallinity is determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC<br>
is run according to ISO 3146/ part 3 /method C2 with a scan rate of 10 °C/min. The<br>
amount of fi-modification is calculated from the second heat by the following<br>
formula:<br>
ß-area/(α-area+ ß-area)<br>
Since the thermodynamical ß-modification starts to be changed into the more stable<br>
α-modification at temperatures above 150 °C, a part of the B-modification is<br>
transferred within the heating process of DSC-measurement. Therefore, the amount<br>
of ß-PP determined by DSC is lower as when measured according to the method of<br>
Turner-Jones by WAXS (A. Turner-Jones et. al., Makromol. Chem 75 (1964) 134).<br>
"Second heat" means that the sample is heated according to ISO 3146 / part<br>
3 / method C2 for a first time and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of<br>
10 °C/min. The sample is then heated a second time, also according to<br>
ISO 3146 / part 3 / method C2. This second heat is relevant for measurement and<br>
calculation.<br>
During the "first heat" all thermal history of the sample giving rise to different<br>
crystalline structure, which typically comes from different processing conditions<br>
and/or methods, is destroyed. Using the second heat for determination of B-<br>
crystallinity, it is possible to compare samples regardless of the way the samples<br>
were originally manufactured.<br><br><br>
The xylene solubles (XS, wt.-%):<br>
Analysis according to the known method (ISO 6427): 2.0 g of polymer is dissolved<br>
in 250 ml p-xylene at 135°C under agitation. After 30±2 minutes the solution is<br>
allowed to cool for 15 minutes at ambient temperature (21 °C) and then allowed to<br>
settle for 30 minutes at 25±0.5°C. The solution is filtered and evaporated in nitrogen<br>
flow and the residue dried under vacuum at 90 °C until constant weight is reached.<br>
XS% = (100 x m1 x v0) / (mo x v1), wherein<br>
m0 = initial polymer amount (g)<br>
m1 = weight of residue (g)<br>
