				<td>Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of lipid soluble extract from Curcuma species in high yield from rhizomes and leaves of species of zingiberaceae family, particularly Curcuma species and also use of the said oil, its constituents, and novel derivatives of said constituents, for the treatment of Neurocerebrovascular disorders.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Neurocerebrovascular diseases like cerebrovascular infarction, stroke, ischemic attacks etc. are caused by an interruption of the blood supply resulting from disease of the arteries carrying blood to the brain.<br>
Of the three general types of stroke,cerebral hemorrhage is caused by rupture of a blood vessel with bleeding into the brain (intra cerebral hemorrhage) or under its covering membrane, while cerebral thrombosis stems from obstruction of a cerebral blood vessel when a blood clot forms within the walls.<br>
The clot may be caused by abnormal thickening of the blood, damage to the vessel wall from arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, inflammation of the arteries or inflammation of the veins.<br>
If the blood supply is stopped completely or is reduced to less than one-fourth its normal level, softening of the brain (cerebral infarction) results, causing permanent brain damage.<br>
Cerebral embolism is obstruction of a cerebral artery by a blood clot or a foreign body migrating from another part of the body's circulation like when a clot that has formed on the inside wall of one of the arteries in the neck travels up to the brain and blocks a major artery branch.<br>
Trasient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are brief episodes of symptoms caused by temporary interruptions of the blood supply. Reversible ischemic neurological deficits( RINDs) are small cerebral infarction. Multiple cerebral infarction can lead to permanent confusion and memory loss. Ischemic stroke is a medical emergency. After TIAs or stroke occur, treatment may be<br><br>
surgical or medical.Surgery may be needed in some cases to remove any blockage of blood<br>
vessels going to the brain.<br>
Medication can prevent the formation of blood clots on the atheroscl-erotic plaques within the<br>
vessel wall. Brain swelling commonly accompanies brain infarction or hemorrhage.No<br>
satisfactory treatment is available.<br>
Currently used drugs in peripheral vascular and cerebral disorders include ergot alkaloids,<br>
aspirin, anti-coagulants etc. The latter are used following strokes to prevent further<br>
cerebrovascular incidents but their use is contraindicated if the stroke was the result of<br>
hemorrhage.<br>
The use of TICLOPIDINE, a highly effective anti-platelet agent to treat stroke cases is<br>
restricted in its long term use due to its adverse side-effects. Tissue plasminogen activator<br>
(t-PA) used to treat clots in the coronary arteries (acute heart attack), is a natural clot<br>
dissolving substance produced by the body which can blow open a blood clot in the brain that<br>
causes the acute ischemic brain damage characteristic of a stroke.While t-PA can dissolve the<br>
blood clot that causes a blood vessel blockage, there are other complications which occur<br>
during ischemic stroke which must be addressed if permanent brain damage is to be<br>
prevented. It is critically important to have nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide .scavengers in the<br>
blood stream when t-PA is administered to reduce the free radical damage that will occur<br>
when the blood flow is restricted and even more when the flow is resumed.<br>
Nitric oxide(NO) and superoxides inflict damage on important biomolecules and their<br>
increased production has been implicated in human diseases like cerebro-,cardiovascular,<br>
inflammatory, neurological dysfunctions and cancer etc.[ Onoda M., Inano H.,Nitrc<br>
oxide:Biology and Chemistry, 4(5),505-515 (2000)].<br>
Most strokes culminate in a core area of ceil death (infarction) and the blood flow is so<br>
drastically reduced that the cells usually can not recover.Brain cells die as a result of the<br>
actions: calcium activated proteases (enzymes which digest cell proteins),lipases(enzymes<br>
which digest cell membranes) and free radicals formed as a result of the ischemic cascade.<br>
Without neuroprotective agents, nerve cells may be irreversibly damaged within several<br>
minutes. Any disruption of blood flow to the brain causes massive tree radical damage that<br>
induces much of the re-perfusion injury to brain cells, typical of strokes. When blood flow is<br>
interrupted and subsequently restored (reperfused), tissues release iron that acts as a catalyst<br>
for the formation of free radicals that often permanently damage brain cells. Protecting brain<br>
cells from injury caused by blood flow disruption, therefore, is of prime importance. If an<br>
ischemic stroke..is happening , the use of large .quantities of. antL-oxidants like melatonin,<br>
vitamins and herbs like Ginkgo biloba have been suggested to provide some benefit.<br>
Magnesium in an oral dose of 1500 mg. is a safe nutrient to relieve an arterial spasm, a<br>
common problem in thrombotic strokes.<br>
The ancient Indian system of medicine-Ayurveda-is concerned with the prevention, diagnosis<br>
and cure of disease.The word "dis-ease"- a right translation of illness is viewed as a<br>
dysfunction of the whole body and is attributed to the circulation and transformation of<br>
ubiquitous humoral fluids.<br>
Most of the Ayurvedic drugs are products of high repute which act on a number of<br>
dysfunctions of the body involving various organs and aim at preventing problems or<br>
restoring a normal situation, and try to recover the patient completely. Evolved over a long<br>
period of time and experimentation, they are the results of a particular combination of certain<br>
fundamental elements which determine their properties which in turn are responsible for the<br>
chemical, biological or therapeutic effects of those substances. There is no substance when<br>
correctly prepared which can not be used as remedy.<br>
Ayurveda describes a number of beneficial effects of rhizomes and leaves of various species<br>
belonging to zingiberaceae family, especially those of Curcuma longa L.syn.Curcuma<br>
domestica Valeton, rhizomes and leaves popularly known as Turmeric or Haldi. Prominent<br>
among these are the anti-bacterial, antirungal wound healing and the anti-inflammatory<br>
actions which enabled turmeric paste to be used as a house hold remedy to treat wounds and<br>
inflammation.<br>
In recent years, its constituents-Curcumin and other curcuminoids have been found to exhibit<br>
besides these activities, choleretic, cholagogic, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer,, inhibition of<br>
leukotriene biosynthesis, 5-lipoxygenase, cyclo-oxygenase, lipid peroxidation, superoxide<br>
and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging effects.<br>
Turmeric -a highly reputed herb in Indian system of medicine-Ayurveda-is the rhizome of<br>
Curcuma longa L.Syn. Curcuma domestica Valeton (Fam. Zingiberaceae) ,which grows<br>
abundantly in India. It has long been used as a spice and a colouring agent in food as well as a<br>
naturally occurring medicine. Its powder or extracts are recommended to treat wounds and<br>
inflammation.<br>

500 mg / daily in divided doses and for other Ailments. 10 -1000 mg/ daily in divided<br>
doses),to provide a highly effective cure/treatment for human diseases wherein nitric oxide<br>
(NO) and free radical oxidative damage are implicated such as all type of stroke, thrombosis,<br>
infarction and neurological dysfunctions and which may also be of therapeutic use in certain<br>
type of cancer such as leukemia, Alzheimer's disease wounds and even HTV./ AIDS.<br>
Examples<br>
The following examples broadly illustrate the invention without in anyway limiting the nature<br>
and scope of the invention:<br>
Example 1<br>
This example describes the method of obtaining Curcuma oil and its constituents in high<br>
yields and preparation of its dosage formulations. Improved extraction procedure of Curcuma<br>
oil and its constituents from Curcuma longs L. syn. Curcuma domestica Valeton or other<br>
Curcuma species rhizomes.<br>
The usual extractive procedure employs three or four percolations of dry powdered Curcuma<br>
rhizomes with an organic solvent like light petroleum, toluene, alcohol etc. and distillation of<br>
the solvent from the percolates. In case of alcoholic extracts, after solvent removal the<br>
residual concentrate is triturated with a non-polar organic solvent like light petroleum<br>
followed by removal of the solvent by distillation to yield Curcuma oil in 1 to 1.5 percent<br>
yields.<br>
Hot extraction (Soxhlet) leads to loss of essential volatile constituents. When these procedures<br>
were changed to extraction of the dry powdered Curcuma rhizomes with appropriate organic<br>
solvents such as light petroleum, acetone, alcohol etc. with continous stirring by mechanical<br>
stirrers driven by electric motors or manually or agitation with sonicator followed by<br>
removal of the solvent from the extracts by distillation under reduced pressure below 45° C<br>
the yield and quality of the Curcuma oil increased appreciably.<br>
In a typical procedure, dry finely powdered Curcuma longa L. rhizomes (1 kg) were<br>
successively percolated with n-hexane (3 liters) in a stainless steel or glass percolator / vessel<br>
fitted with a tap near the bottom to drain out the percolate, and the contents were stirred<br>
under slow motion continuously for 24 hours each time by a mechanical stirrer driven by an<br>
electric motor. The orange-yellow percolate was drained out and the procedure repeated four<br>
to five times. Solvent was distilled off from the percolates under reduced pressure below 45<br>
0 C to yield an orange yellow odoriferous liquid (51 gms = 5.1% yield).<br>
Likewise, initial extraction of finely powdered Curcuma longa L rhizomes (1 kg) with<br>
acetone or alcohol (5x 3 liters) under continuous stirring for 24 hours each time followed by<br>
removal of the solvent from the percolates by distillation under reduced pressure below 45°C<br>
and exhaustive trituration of the residual concentrate with n-hexane or toluene (6x500 ml)<br>
followed by removal of the solvent by distillation under reduced pressure below 45°C<br>
yielded an orange yellow odoriferous liquid (60 gm.=6% yield).<br>
Column chromatography of this orange yellow odoriferous liquid (20.0 gm.) over a silica gel<br>
column, using n-hexane, n-hexane: ethyl acetate (in varying proportions) mixture and ethyl<br>
acetate successively gave ar-d-turmerone (formula 1, 55%) and turmerones (a-,p- formula 2,<br>
20%) as major constituents (fraction- A.) followed by curcumene(10%) &amp; zingiberine<br>
(fraction- B) and other minor constituents -germacrone, curcumerone, zedoarone,<br>
zedoarondiol, isozdedoarondiol, curcumenone, curlone etc. (fraction C) whose activity was<br>
low..<br>
Distillation of Curcuma oil (20.0 gms.) under reduced pressure (140-160°C / 9mm Hg)<br>
yielded ar-d-turmerone rich major fraction I (formula 1, 15.0 gms) alongwith other<br>
turmerones (a-,p-, formula 2) and other minor constituents (4.2 gms, fraction II) Fraction I<br>
Ar-d-turmerone a-turmerone, ab A and R= Me<br>
P-Turmerone, R= =CH2<br>
had refractive index (no30) 1.4990, specific optical rotation (L)25+19.6. Curcuma oil itself or<br>
its individual constituents obtained by chromatography or distillation under high vacuum are<br>
used singly or in combination with each other with and without other therapeutically<br>
beneficial compounds to prepare appropriate clinically effective formulations.<br>
The solid dosage form may be obtained by maceration of Curcuma oil as such or its<br>
individual constituents singly or in combination with each other particularly ar-d-turmerone,<br>
cc-,p- turmerones with starch and microcrystalline cellulose in suitable proportions in a mixer<br>
till the mixture becomes a free flowable powder which may be filled in capsules or converted<br>
into tablets as per therapeutically desired specifications.<br>
In a typical example, Curcuma oil (10.0 gm.) was dissolved in ethanol (100ml). Starch<br>
(S.Ogm) and microcrystalline cellulose (85.0 gm) were added to this solution. The contents<br>
were mixed thoroughly and solvent was removed by drying below 45°C. The resulting<br>
product was passed through 40-mesh size sieve to obtain free flowing granules. These<br>
granules were then compressed into tablets of appropriate dosage requirements, e.g. each<br>
tablet weighing SOOmg.contain 50mg of Curcuma oil.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Focal cerebral ischaemiai<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats of 270-375 gm weight from CDRI Animal House were used for<br>
this study. Rats were housed in a 12-hr, light / dark cycle and water was given ad libitum.<br>
Animals were fasted overnight and anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium, 30mg/kg.<br>
Rectal temperature was monitored. Transient ischaemia / reperfusion was performed using an<br>
intravascular filament to occlude the middle cerebral artery unilaterally [Longa<br>
Z.E.,Weinstein P.R., Carlson S., Cummins R.; Reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion<br>
without craniectomy in rats : Stroke ,20, 84-91(1989) ] for 2 hours followed by reperfusion<br>
for the remainder of 36 hours. Animals were assigned randomly to the following groups of<br>
n=5 rats (1) Control: Sham operated. (2.) Ischaemic / reflow- no treatment. (3.) Ischaemic<br>
/reflow-treated group:( i) Curcuma oil (weight/ml., 0. 86gm.), 683.65 mg./kg., given i.p. and<br>
P.O. (ii) . Fraction- A(weight /ml.,0. 88gm.), 569. 56 mg/kg., given , i.p. and P.O. (iii).<br>
Fraction -B. (weight /ml.,0. 91gm.) 938.86mg / kg., given, i.p. and P.O. The animals<br>
were sacrificed &amp; brains were removed and quickly frozen. Eight coronal section of of 2mm<br>
thickness from each brain were cut and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride at 37°<br>
C for 30min. and post fixed by formalin. Each brain slice was photographed. The area of<br>
infarct hi each slice was evaluated in a double blind manner. From groups (1,2,'&amp;3) rats n=3 ,<br>
brain was removed and processed for mitochondrial Ca 2+ estimation .<br>
Experimental Protocol:<br>
Isolation of forebrain mitochondria:<br>
Mitochondria were isolated from the rat forebrain according to the method of Lai and Clark<br>
[Lai. J.C.K., Clark J.P., Preparation of synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria from<br>
mammalian brain: Method Enzymol.," 55, 51-60(1979)] with slight modifications. Rat<br>
forebrain was immediately removed after decapitation and immersed in ice- cold isolation<br>
medium or Phosphate Buffered Saline. Brains were minced and rinsed to remove all the traces<br>
of blood. The tissue was homogenized (10% w/v) in an appropriate medium using a<br>
motorized Teflon homogenizer and immediately centrifuged at 1800g for 10 min. The<br>
supernatant was decanted and the pellet rehomogenized and centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 min.<br>
Supernatants from the first and the second spins were added together and centrifuged at<br>
17,000 g for 20 minutes. The resultant pellet was resuspended in specific mediums and<br>
centrifuged at 17000 g. for 5 minutes.<br>
Determination of mitochondrial content:<br>
Calcium content of mitochondria isolated from forebrain was estimated according to the<br>
method of Zaidan E. and Sims N.R. [The calcium content of mitochondria from brain sub<br>
regions following short term fore brain ischaemia and recirculation in the rat; J. Neurochem.,<br>
(53,1812-1819(1994)], with slight modifications , In brief, mitochondria (0. 3 mg. protein) in<br>
succinate mediun were loaded with Fura-2AM (0-5uM) and incubated for 30 min. at 37°C<br>
with constant shaking . The mitochondria were then washed twice in succinate medium and<br>
re-suspended in the same medium.<br>
The ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at exciting wavelength of 340 and 380 nm with emission at<br>
510 nm was determined using a Shimadzu RF 5000 Spectrofluorometer. Mitochondrial<br>
Calcium([Ca 2+]m), is presented as tracings of the 340/380 fluorescence ratio[Macleod K.T<br>
and Harding S.E.; Effect of phorbolester in contraction, intracellular pH and intracellular Ca2+<br>
in isolated mammalian ventricular myocytes. J. Physiol. (London) ,444,481-498 (1991)].<br>
Result: Infarct from focal ischaemic rat in pretreated group was completely prevented as seen<br>
in Fig. 1 &amp; 2. In the group where test compound / agent was given post occlusion of middle<br>
cerebral artery, six out of seven brain sections shows complete prevention (Fig.3), whereas in<br>
one about 20% of the area showed up as infarcted. Mitochondria isolated from forebrain from<br>
animals made sham, ischaemc and treated with the test compound group (i) showed the<br>
intracellular calcium levels close to normal (Fig.4).<br>
Example 3<br>
Collagenase-induced infra-cerebral hemorrhage:<br>
Adult male rats (250-350 gm.) from the CDRI-Animal House were used in the following<br>
experiments. The rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and<br>
placed in a stereotaxic frame (for rats, Narashige, Japan). Rosenberg etal's method<br>
[Rosenberg G.A. Mun-Bryce S., Mary B.S. and Kornfeld M., Collagenase-induced<br>
intracerebral hemorrhage in rats: Stroke, 21, 801-807 (1990)] was followed. An incision was<br>
made in the scalp and a 23- guage needle was implanted into the caudate nucleus and the<br>
putamen (at the coordinates of A5.8, L3.0, HI). ( A stereotaxic atlas of the rat brain, eds.R.<br>
M. Elliot, Gardener Lindzey and Kenneth , MacCorquodale. Meredith Publishing Company,<br>
1967). Rats(n=10) were injected with collagenase (0.01 IU in 2(il of saline) and for sham with<br>
2 ul of normal saline. After infusion, the needle was removed and the wound was sutured. The<br>
animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia, kept in a warm place and allowed access to<br>
food and water. Eighteen hours later, the animals were evaluated for neurological deficit by<br>
measuring scoring of abnormal possture and hemiplegia according to Yamamoto et.al. [<br>
Yamamoto A.Tamura, Kirino T., Shimizu M and Sano K. Behavioral changes after focal<br>
cerebral ischaemia by left middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Brain Research ,452, 323-<br>
328.(1988)]. Later rats were reanaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium, 30-mg/kg i.p. and<br>
brain was removed. Rats were assigned randomly into three groups. Group 1, received,saline.<br>
Collagenase (0.01 IU in 2jo,l saline) treated Groups 2 &amp; 3 received fraction A (683. 65mg/kg)<br>
after 5 and 7 hours of collagenase treatment by the oral route.<br>
Antioxidant estimations<br>
Mitochondria were isolated as described in example 2.For antioxidant estimations, the<br>
mitochondria were rinsed and suspended in phosphate buffer. For the other estimations<br>
mitochondria were resuspended in a medium containing sucrose 250 mM, KPkPCU 6 mM and<br>
succinate 6mM, pH 7.2. The isolation procedure was carried out at 4°C.<br>
Antioxidants:<br>
The oxygen scavenging enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and<br>
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were estimated in mitochondria isolated from forebrain<br>
of experimental animals.<br>
SOD: SOD activity was measured by the inhibition of NADH, PMS, NET and absorbance<br>
monitored at 560 nm. Enzyme activity is expressed in U/min/mg protein. [Nishikini M., Rao<br>
N.A., Yagi K., The occurrence of superoxide anion in the reaction of reduced PMS and<br>
molecular oxygen. Biochem Biophysi. Res. Commun., 46, 849- 854 (1972)].<br>
CAT: CAT activity was assayed by measuring the UV absorbance change of H2O2 at 240 nm<br>
according to Aebi [Aebi H., In Methods of Enzymatic Analysis (Third edition) ed. H.U.<br>
Bergmeyer Academic Press, New York and London, Vol.2 pp 673-684. (1974)]<br>
Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TEARS):<br>
Mitochondrial TEARS levels were measured as an index of malondialdehyde and hence lipid<br>
peroxidation by the method of Okhawa et. el.[0khawa H., Ohishi N., Yagi K., Assay of lipid<br>
peroxides in animal tissues by thiobarbituric acid reaction: Anal. Biochem., 95, 351 (1979)] at<br>
532 nm. Functional deficit was estimated according to Bederson [Bederson I.E., Pitts, L.H.<br>
Tsiji M., Nishimura M.C. Davis R.L., Barkowisk H., Rat MCAO: Evaluation of model and<br>
development of a neurologic examination, Stroke, 17, 472 (1986)] and water contents were<br>
estimated. Both the parameters were found to be significantly reduced as compared to<br>
untreated group.<br>
Protein Assay<br>
Mitochondrial protein was determined by the method of Lowry et.al. [Lowry O.K.,<br>
Rosbrough N.J., Farr. A.L., Randall K.J.; Protein measurement with folin phenol reagent: J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 193, 265 (1951)] using bovine serum albumin(BSA) as standard.<br>
Result: The test compound (fraction A) given 5 hours after collagenase treatment significantly<br>
reduced the edema. Neurological deficit at 5 &amp; 7 hours of treatment were scored as grade 4<br>
in untreated group and grade 0-2 in treated group. Mortality in untreated group was 3 out of 5<br>
and in treated group 1 out of 5.<br>
SOD: SOD value in 5 hours was almost normal while in case of test compound (fraction A)<br>
given after 7 hours post collagenase treatment the SOD levels were augmented (Fig. 5).<br>
Catalase: This enzyme is reported to be presenfin minute amount in brain (Fig. 6)<br>
TBARS: At 5 hours post collagenase treatment, the values were close to that of collagenase<br>
treated animals, while at 7 hours the values were decreased significantly as compared to the<br>
normal group indicating the anti-oxidant property of the test compound-fraction A (Fig.7).<br>
Mitochondria were isolated as described in Example 2.<br>
Example 4<br>
Adult male rats (250-3 50gm.) from the C.D.R.I. Animal house were anaesthetized with<br>
30mg./ kg. Pentobarbitone sodium. Jugular veins of the rats were exposed. Five drops of 10 %<br>
formalin in 65 % methanol was dropped on the vein. Six hours were allowed for thrombus<br>
formation which was then graded according to its presence or absence.[Blake O. R., Ashwin<br>
J.G.Jaques L.B.,; An assay for the antithrombotic<br>
activityofanticoagulants:J.Clin.Pathol.,72,118 (1959)]. Fraction A (ar-d-turmerone and<br>
turmerones) was given 200jj,l.i.p./300gm.rat in the treated group,while the untreated (control)<br>
group received equivalent amount of saline (i.p).<br>
Result: The thrombus in the untreated group was 2.8mg. and in the treated group it was<br>
0.75mg. showing an increase of 373.33 % in untreated versus treated group.<br>
Example 5<br>
Rats were made hypertensive according to Goldblatt et. al.[ Goldblatt H., Lynch J., Hanezal<br>
R.F., Serville W.W.: Studies on experimental hypertension,: The production of persistent<br>
elevation of systolic blood pressure by means of renal ischaemia J Exp Med ;59:347-379<br>
(1934)]. Eight weeks later the hypertensive rats had an average initial blood pressure of 200<br>
mm/Hg. After Curcuma oil , 683.65mg./kg. was administered intraperitoneally the blood<br>
pressure fell to 115 mm /Hg in 15 min. and stayed at that level for more than 60 min.<br>
ResultiThe compound lowers the blood pressure significantly in hypertensive rats and not in<br>
the normotensive rats. It reduces blood pressure without bradycardia due to P- adrenergic<br>
receptor antagonism or reflex tachycardia common to vasodilator [Nichols A.J,Gallai<br>
M.Ruffolo R.P Jr. Studies on the mechanism of arterial vasodilation produced by the noval<br>
antihypertensive agent. Carvediolol. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol., 5:25-38 (1991) ].<br>
Example 6<br>
Abdominal aorta was mounted according to Wolfgang et. al. [Wolfgang Auch-Schwelk,<br>
Zvonimir S.Katusic and Paul M.Vanhoutte : contractions to oxygen derived free radicals are<br>
augmented in aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rats., Hypertension ,13, 859-<br>
864(1989)]. Aortic rings were contracted with norepinephrine 10"8 to 10"5 M.The contracted<br>
vessels were relaxed by acetylcholine or Curcuma oil, added in a stepwise manner.<br>
Acetylcholine was added in a concentration of 10"7 to 10"5 M. For Curcuma oil, the final<br>
contraction achieved was 0.861mg in a 8ml bath (Fig. 8). Protein Kinase C activator, Phorbol<br>
12-Myristate 13- Acetate (PMA) (10"7 M ) induced contraction in the intact and denuded<br>
aortic strip preparation. Pretreatment with Curcuma, oil ,0.881 mg. completely inhibited PMA<br>
induced contraction. It inhibits protein kinase C [Kaczmarck L. K.; The role of Protein Kinase<br>
C in regulation of ion channels and neurotransmitter release: Trends in Neurosciences, 10, 30-<br>
34 (1987); Jin-Moo Lee, Grabb M.C., Zipfel G.J., Choi D. W., J. Clin. Invest., 106, (6), 723-<br>
731(2000).<br>
Result: Curcuma oil and acetylcholine caused complete relaxation in norepinephrine induced<br>
contraction showing a significant vasorelaxant effect.<br>
Example 7<br>
Nitric oxide was first characterized in the central nervous system at the intracellular messenger<br>
mediating the increase in cGMP levels mat follows activation of glutamate receptors (Garthwaite J,<br>
Charles S.L. and Chess-Williams R. Endothelium derived relaxing factor release on activation of<br>
NMDA receptors suggest a role as intracellular messenger in the brain. Nature 336, 385-388 (1988).<br>
Simultaneous generation of NO and superoxide radicals favours the production of a toxic reaction<br>
product peroxynitrite anion (Beckman JS, Beckman TW, Chen J, Marshal PA and Freeman BA).<br>

oxide and superoxide. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 1620 (1990). Once near or inside a cell<br>
peroxynitrite can damage or deplete a number of vital components, DNA by strand scission, lipid by<br>
lipid peroxidation aconitase and antioxidant availability (Cuzzocrea S, Riley. DP, Caputi AP and<br>
Salvemini D. Antioxidant therapy: a new pharmacological approach ion shock, inflammation and<br>
ischemia/reperfusion injury. Pharmacol. Rev. 53: 135-159, (2001). To test the nitric oxide scavenging<br>
property of the test agent invitro testing was carried out using an NO donor sodium nitroprusside.<br>
Nitric oxide (NO) scavenging by test compounds/agents:<br>
Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) generates Nitric oxide (NO) [Sreejayan and Rao M.N.A: Nitric<br>
oxide scavenging by curcuminoids, J.Pharm. Pharmacol.,4P, 105-107(1997)]. fraction -A,<br>
86.14mg was mixed in phosphate-buffer saline at different concentration of SNP ( 5-40 mM)<br>
Griess reagent in 1:1 ratio was mixed with the test compound (fraction -A). The absorbance of<br>
the above chromophore buffer formed with SNP, test compound (fraction -A) and Griess<br>
reagent was read at 546 nm and refer to the absorbance of standard solution of potassium<br>
nitrite treated in the same way with Griess reagent ( Green L.C, Wagner D.A.,Glogowski J,<br>

Results :SNP generates nitric oxide and test compound (fraction A) scavenges the nitric oxide<br>
thus generated. The result indicated the test compound (fraction A) hi focal ischaemia to be a<br>
scavenger of nitric oxide (Fig. 9).<br><br><br><br>
