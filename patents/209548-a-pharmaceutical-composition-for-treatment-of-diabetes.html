Method of treating metabolic disorders, especially diabetes, or a disease or condition<br>
associated with diabetes<br>
• *<br>
The invention relates to a combination, such as a combined preparation or phaimaceutical composition, respectively, which comprises nateglinide or repagiinide and at least one other antidiabetics compound selected from the group consisting of this azolidinedione derivatives (glitazones), sulfonyl urea derivatives and metformin for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the prevention, delay of progression or treatment of diseases, especially metabolic disorders and in particular type 2 diabetes and di senses and conditions associated with diabetes; the use of such combination for the preparation of a medicament for the prevention, delay of progression or treatment of metabolic disorders; the use of such combination for the cosmetic treatment of a mammal in order to effect a cosmetically beneficial loss of body weight; a method of prevention, delay of progression or treatment of diseases in warm-blooded animals; a method of improving the bodily appearance of a warm-blooded animal; to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises nateglinide as the sole active agent in the composition and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and to a process of making such phaimaceutical composition.<br>
The generally accepted aims in the treatment of diabetes are to provide relief from symptoms, improvement of the quality of life and prevention of both acute (hyperosmolar coma and ketoacidosis) and chronic complications (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy and premature atherosclerosis).   2 diabetes is characterized by both increased peripheral insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion. At least two abnormalities of insulin secretion are recognized: in the first phase insulin is both delayed and inadequate in the face of elevated circulating glucose levels and in the second phase insulin secretion is lost Several metabolic, hormonal, and pharmacological entities are known to stimulate insulin secretion including glucose, amino-acids and gastrointestinal peptides. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) performed in Type IIDDM subjects has established that lowering of blood glucose is associated with decreases in the onset and progression of diabetic microvascular complications (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group; N. Engl. J. Med. 1993,329,977-986). Therefore, one therapeutic focus is on optimizing and potentially normalizing glycolic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Presently available oral agents fail to meet this therapeutic challenge<br><br>
in some patient subgroups, result sometimes in side-effects or are fraught with other problems.<br>
The present invention relates to a combination, such as a combined preparation or pharmaceutical composition, respectively, which comprises nateglinide of formula (I)<br><br>
or repagiinide and at least one other antidiabetic compound selected from the group consisting of thiazolidinedione derivatives (glitazones), sulfonyl urea derivatives and metformin,<br>
in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and optionally at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; for simultaneous, separate or sequential use, particularly in the prevention, delay of progression or treatment of diseases, especially metabolic disorders and in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus and diseases and conditions associated with diabetes meliitus. Such a combination is preferably a combined preparation or a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
By the term 'a combined preparation or pharmaceutical composition, respectively, which comprises nateglinide or repagiinide and at least one other antidiabetic compound selected from the group consisting of glitazones, sulfonyl urea derivatives and metformin, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt and optionally at least one pharmaceuticaily acceptable carrier, for simultaneous, separate or sequential use**, there is meant especially a It of parts* in the sense that the components nateglinide or repagiinide and at least one other antidiabetic compound selected from the group consisting of glitazones, sulfonyl urea derivatives and metformin can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the components, i.e. simultaneously or at different time pointed. The parts of the kit of parts can then e.g. be administered simultaneously or chronology Icily staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any<br><br>

hereby incorporated into the present application by reference to this publications. Comprised are likewise the corresponding stereoisomers as well as the corresponding crystal modifications, e.g. solvates and polymorphs, which are disclosed therein. The term nateglinide as used herein comprises crystal modifications (polymorphs) such as those disclosed in EP 0526171 81 or US 5.488,510, respectively, the subject matter of which is incorporated by reference to this application, especially the subject matter of claims 8 to 10 as well as the nonexpanding references to the B-type crystal modification. Preferably, in the present invention the B- or H-type, more preferably the H-type, is used.<br>
Any one or more or combinations of these compounds and other similar compounds or fragments are hereinafter called "anti-diabetic drugs", in the description of compositions and methods of treating the disease.<br>
Furthennore, MCC555 can be formulated as disclosed on page 49, lines 30 to 45, of EP 0 604 983 B1; englitazone as disclosed from page 6, line 52, to page 7, line 6, or analogous to Examples 27 or 28 on page 24 of EP 0 207 605 B1; and darglitazone and 5-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxa2olyl)-ethoxy)]benzyl}-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (BM-13.1246) can be formulated as disclosed on page 8, line 42 to line 54 of EP 0 332 332 B1. AY-31637 can be administered as disclosed in column 4, lines 32 to 51 of US 4,997,948 and rosiglitazone as disclosed on page 9, lines 32 to 40 of EP 0 306 228 A1, the latter preferably as its maleate salt<br>
Corresponding to the needs of the single patient and under the proviso that it is intended by a physician to administer the combinations, e.g. the pharmaceutical compositions, in separate tablets, it is possible to administer the antidiabetics as launched, e.g. rosiglitazone in the form as it is launched under the trademaric AVANDIA™. Troglitazone can be administered in the fonn as it is launched under the trademarks ReZulin ™, PRELAY™, ROMOZIN™ (in the United Kingdom) or NOSCAL™ (In Japan). Pioglitazone can be administered as disclosed In Example 2 of EP 0193 256 A1, preferably in the form of the monohydrochloride salt or in the form as launched under the trademark ACTOS ™. Ciglitazone can, for example, be Fomnylated as disdosed in Example 13 of US 4,287,200. If the drug metformin shall be administered in a separate pharmaceutical composition, it can be administered in the form as it is laundered e.g. under the trademark DIABETOSAN ™. If<br><br>
the drug metformin shall be administered in a separate phannaceutical composition in the form of its hydrochloride salt, the metonym hydrochloride salt can be administered in the form as it is launched e.g. under the trademarks DIABETASE 500 ™, DIABETASE 850™ or GLUCOPHAGE S™. Glyburide can be taken in the form as it is launched under the trademark AZUGLUCON™ or EUGLUCON™, Tolbutamide can be administered in the fonn as it is launched under the trademark ORABET, glimepiride as launched under the trademark AMARYL™, glidazide as launched under the trademark DIAMICRON™, glibornuride as launched under the trademark GLUBORID™ and gliquidone as it is launched under the trademark GLURENORM™.<br>
The compounds to be combined can be present as pharmaceutically acceptable. If these compounds have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The compounds having an acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. For example the compounds to be combined can be present as a sodium salt, as a maleate or hydrochloride. The compounds to be combined can also be present in the form of solvates.<br>
The recommended dose for rosiglitazone taken as a single drug is 4 mg or 8 mg administered either as a single dose or in divided doses twice daily. The best responses with rosiglitazone in the treatment of diabetes are observed with 4 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for pioglitazone taken as a single dmg is 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg taken once dally.<br>
The nature of diabetes and related diseases or conditions is multifactorial. Under certain circumstances, drugs with different mechanisms of action may be combined. However, just considering any combination of drugs having different mode of action but acting in the similar field does not necessarily lead to combinations with advents aqueous effects.<br>
All the more surprising is the experimental finding that the combined administration of nategiinide or repaglinide and at least one other antidiabetic compound selected from the group consisting of glitziness, in particular rosiglitazone, troglitazone and pioglitazone, sulfonyl urea derivatives and metformin results not only in a benefited, especially a<br><br>
synergistic, therapeutic effect, but also in additional benefits resulting from the combined treatment and further surprising beneficial effects compared to a.monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active compounds used in the combinations disclosed herein.<br>
In particular, all the more surprising is the experimental finding that the combined administration of nateglinide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an antidiabetic thiazolidinedione derivative, results not only in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect but also in additional benefits resulting from combined treatment such as a surprising prolongation of efficacy, a broader variety of therapeutic treatment and surprising beneficial effects on diseases and conditions associated with diabetes, e.g. less gain of weight.<br>
It can be shown by established test models and especially those test models described herein that the combination of nateglinide or repagiinide and at least one other antidiabetic compound selected from the group consisting of glitazones, in particular rosiglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, sulfonyl urea derivatives and the biguanide metformin, or in each case a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, results in a more effective prevention or preferably treatment of diseases, especially metabolic disorders, and in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus and diseases and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus. In particular, it can be shown by established test models and especially those test models described herein that the combination of nateglinide and an antidiabetic thiazolidinedione derivative, or in each case a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, results in a more effective prevention or preferably treatment of diseases, especially metabolic disorders, more especially diabetes and in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus, and diseases and conditions associated with diabetes.<br>
If taken simultaneously, this results not only in a further enhanced beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect, but also in additional benefits resulting from the simultaneous treatment such as a surprising prolongation of efficacy, a broader variety of therapeutic treatment and surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less increase of weight, on diseases and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus, for a number of combinations as described herein. Moreover, for a human patient, especially forelderiy people, it is more convenient and easier to remember to take two tablets at the same time, e.g. before a<br><br>
meal, than staggered in time, i.e. according to a more complicated treatment schedule. More preferably, both active ingredients are administered as a fixed combination, i.e. as a single tablet, in all cases described herein. Taking a single tablet is even easier to handle than taking two tablets at the same time. Furthermore, the packaging can be accomplished with less effort.<br>
The person skilled in the pertinent art is fully enabled to select a relevant animal test model to prove the hereinbefore and hereinafter indicated therapeutic indications and beneficial effects. The pharmacological activity may, for example, be demonstrated following essentially an in-vivo test procedure in mice or in a clinical study as described hereinafter.<br>
In-viyo test in mice for blood glucose control<br>
ICR’CDI mice (male, five weeks old, body weight: about 20 g) are abstained from food for 18 hours, and then used as test subjects. The combination according to the present invention and the active Ingredients alone are suspended in 0.5% CMC-0-14M sodium chloride buffer solution (pH 7.4) or suspended in 0.5 percent by weight. The solution or suspension thus obtained is administered orally in fixed volume amounts to the test subjects. After predetermined time, the percentage decrease of the blood glucose against the control group is determined.<br>
Clinical double-blind, randomized, parallel-croup studies in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet or monotherapv and diet alone<br>
These studies prove in particular the synergism of the claimed combinations, such as the combined preparations or pharmaceutical compositions, respectively. The beneficial effects on diseases and conditions assonated with diabetes mellitus as defined in this application can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The studies are, in particular, suitable to assess the effects of monotherapy with nateglinide, repagllnide, a glitazone, a sulfonyl urea derivative or metformin and a combination of nategllnideor repaglinide with one or more compounds selected from flie group consisting of a glitazones, a sulfonyl urea derivatives or metfonmin on glycolic<br><br>
control. The studies are especially suitable to assess the effects of monotherapy with metformin or the corresponding hydrochloride salt or a combination of nateglinide and metfomiin or the con-responding hydrochloride salt on glycemic control. Subjects with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who have not achieved near nonmoglycemia (HbAic 
Before starting with the double-blind treatment for 16 or 24 weeks, the subjects are administered for four or eight weeks nateglinide matching placebos before breakfast, lunch and dinner, and<br>
(1)	a placebo matching with the glitazone troglitazone administered later on e.g. with breakfast only (study 1 - period I),<br>
(2)	a placebo matching with the glitazone pioglitazone 5 mg tablet administered later on before breakfast, lunch and dinner (study 2 - period I).<br>
The subjects are then separated Into four treatment groups for the 16'week or 24-week double-blind studies (period II) as depicted below. Approximately 150 to 170 subjects are randomized per treatment group. The total study duration including the run-in period for each subject is 24 to 28 weeks. Statistical analysis can be carried out by methods   known in the art<br>
Study 1: Combination of 120 ma nateglinide and froqiitazone<br>
In a particular embodiment of this study, before starting with the double-blind treatment for 24 weeks, the subjects are administered for four weeks nateglinide matching placebos before breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a placebo matching with the antidiabetic<br><br>
thiazolidinedione administered later on with breakfast only (period I). The subjects are then separated into four treatment groups for the 24-week double-blind study (period II) as depicted below for the case that trogiltazone is chosen as the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione. Approximately 170 subjects are randomized per treatment group. The total study duration including the run-in period for each subject is 28 weeks<br><br>
*   administered before breakfast, lunch, and dinner; ** daily dosage<br>
Nateglinide tablets contain either 120 mg or matching placebo. Troglitazone tablets can be purchased commercially and used to prepare the 600 mg tablets matching the corresponding placebo capsules.<br><br>
"  administered both before breakfast, lunch, and dinner<br>
Nateglinide tablets contain either 120 mg or matching placebo. Pioglitazone tablets can be purchased commercially and used to prepare the 5 mg tablets matching the con’esponding placebo capsules.<br><br>
study 3: Combination of 60 mq natealinide and 250 ma of metformin admmistered as a single pharmaceutical composition<br>
In this study in period I the subjects are administered for four weeks matching placebos before breakfast, lunch and dinner, before starting with the treatment for 24 weeks. The subjects are then separated into four treatment groups for the 24-week study (period II) as depicted below. The total study duration including the run-in period for each subject is 28 weeks. Both drugs are combined in a fixed phamiaceutical composition administered before each main meal comprising as pharmaceutically active components:<br><br>
Study 4: Combination of 60 or 120 mq nategiinide before meals and 1000 mq of metonym as a daily doses<br>
Subjects with HbAic values of 6.8 -11 % receive metformin for at least 3 months und at least 1500 mg/day during the last 4 weeks before starting period 0. After period 0 extending over 4 weeks in which period 1000 mg/day metformin plus nateglinide placebo are given to the subjects, the subjects are randomized to nateglinide placebo, 60 mg nateglinide or 120 mg nateglinide before main meals for 24 weeks while continuing to receive 1000 mg metformin daily.<br><br><br>
** immediately after breakfast and dinner<br>
For example, the following procedure can'be followed in order to take blood samples: The subject is advised not to take the morning dose of study medication or eat breakfast on the day of a scheduled study visit The miming dose is administered by site personnel after the collection of all fasting laboratory samples and completion of all study procedures. Visits are scheduled to be performed at 2 week inten/als during Period I, and 4 to 8 week intervals during Period II. Subjects have fasted for at least 7 hours at the time of each visit. All blood samples for laboratory evaluations are drawn between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM. All tests are conducted in accordance with GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) principles following procedures known in the art.<br>
HbAic is measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLG) using the ion-exchange method on a Bio-Red Diamater analyzer.

The combined administration of nategiinide or repaglinide and at least one other antidiabetic compound selected from the group consisting of glitazones, sulfonyl urea derivatives and metformin results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect, especially on type 2 diabetes, and also in additional benefits such as a decrease of diabetes-related mortality, a surprising prolongation of efficacy of the drug (such delaying the eventual need for insulin), a broader variety of therapeutic treatment, maintaining the target blood glucose level in type 2 diabetes patients, providing a good initial blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes patients, only modest changes in fasting plasma glucose level, and further surprising beneficial effects, comprising e.g. less or no gain of body weight, a decrease of gastrointestinal side effects or an improved safety profile, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active compounds used in the combinations disclosed herein. In particular, the further surprising beneficial effects can also be observed during the treatment of metabolic disorders other than type 2 diabetes and during the treatment of diseases and conditions associated with type 2 diabetes. Further benefits are that lower doses of the individual drugs to be combined according to the present invention can be used to reduce the dosage, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects (e.g. anaemia, oedema, headache).<br>
Furthemiore, in a number of combinations as disclosed herein the side-effects observed with one of the components surprisingly do not accumulate on application of the combination.<br>
The beneficial tfierapeutic effect, additional benefits and espedally the surprising beneficial effects are observed in particular within nategiinide. Very good results have been obtained within titer combination of nategiinide and motioning or metformin hydrochloride.<br>
The beneficial therapeutic effects, additional benefits and also the surprising benefited effects are absented especially in human subjects suffering from a more severe form of type 2 diabetes, i.e. human subjects having an elevated HbA ic (glycosylated haemoglobin)<br><br>
value at baseline of greater 8 % and more particular in human subjects having a HbA ic value at baseline of greater than 9.5 %, before treatment with the combinations described herein. If nategiinide is administered to such human patients, preferably, such human patients obtain a dose of between 90 and 200 mg, more preferably between 100 and 150 mg, for example 120 mg, nategiinide per meal as part of the combination given to them.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a dose of between 45 and 85 mg. more preferably 60 mg. of nategiinide per meal is administered as part of the combination to human subjects having a HbAic value at baseline between 6,8 % and 8 %, in particular between 6.8 % and 7%. This provides the option to increase the amount of nategiinide later on. which option is advantegous especially in a situation when the HbA ic value at baseline exceeds values of 7% after starting the treatment of the human subject for a period of time or constantly or if the responsible physician determines that the treatment schedule has to be changed to higher amounts of nategiinide for other reasons. One preferred combination partner in this embodiment is metformin.<br>
Furthermore, the beneficial therapeutic effects, additional benefits and also the surprising beneficial effects are observed especially in human subjects having a body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 35 kg/m’ in particular a BMI of 27 to 35 kg/m’, and even more enhanced in human subjects with a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m’. Human subjects having a BMI greater 30 kg/m’ are defined to be clinically obese.<br>
Additionally, the beneficial tiierapeutio effects, additional benefits and also the surprising beneficial effects are observed especially in patients poorly controlled by monotherapy with one of the components of the combinations disclosed herein.<br>
Further benefits are that lower doses of the individual drugs to be combined according to tiie present invention can be used to reduce the dosage, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects (e.g. anaemia, oedema, headache). This is in accordance with tiie desires and requirements of tiie patients to be treated.<br><br>

Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention used for the combination therapy suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oii liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient wth the canler which constitutes one or more necessary ingrediente. in general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and<br><br>
intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid earners or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
The combination of compounds of the present invention is useful In the treatment of diabetes. For these purposes, the combinations of the present Invention may be administered orally, parenteralty (including subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrastemal injection or Infusion techniques), by inhalation spray, or rectally, in dosage unit fonnulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. These can be administered in a fixed combination dosage form or separately.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the combination therapies of the present invention there is further provided a method of treating and a pharmaceutical composition for treating obesity and diabetes. The treatment involves administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of each compound in the combination of the present invention.<br>

The composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods Include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient vwth the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid earners or finely divided solid cam'ers or both, and then, if necessaiy, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, Inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened witii an inert liquid diluent Desirably, each tablet contsdns from about 2.5 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, preferably about 60 mg to al&gt;aut 200 mg, and most preferably about 120 mg to about 180 mg of the active ingredient.<br><br>
When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Capsules employed in the present invention may be made from any pharmaceutically acceptable material such as gelatin or cellulose derivatives.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify ttie physical forni of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both.<br>
The composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, may be used for enteral, such as oral or rectal, administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmacologically active compound, alone or in combination with one or more phannaceutically acceptable carriers, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application.<br>
The composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, contains, for example, from about 10 to about 100 percent by weight, preferably 80 percent by weight, preferably from about 20 to about 60 percent by weight, of the active ingredient. The most preferable commercial levels range from 18 to 29% active ingredients. Compositions according to ttie invention for enteral administration are, for example, those in unit dose forms, such as sugarcoated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories.<br>
These are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. Thus, tiie pharmaceutical composition can be obtained by combining the active ingredient witti solid carriers, if desired granulating a mixture obtained, and processing the mbcture or granules, if desired or necessary, after addition of suitable excipients to give tablets or sugar-coated tablet cores.<br>
The granulation step may be performed by a high shear wet granulator, of the type conventional in tiie art Either a top or bottom driven granulator may be used, witti a collette gral granulator being an example of a preferred embodiment One skilled in tiie art can readily detenrnlne tiie optimal granulation time. A preferred granulation time ranges from about 1 to about 4 minutes, and is most preferably about 2 minutes.<br><br>
After granulation, the granules may be dried by conventional steps, including for example a drying step performed by a fluid bed drier. The dried granules may ttien be passed to a wire mesh screen apparatus to break up any fraction of granules having an undesirable size. Examples of preferred screening devices include a Frewitt MG 400 and a Frewitl MG 624.<br>
After granulation, the granules may be further blended with additional composition ingredients, or even additional quantities of ingredients previously granulated- Diffusion mixers of various mixing container geometries may be used for the blending step. Typical mixers used for blending include, for example, a V-blender or a bin blender such as a Stocklin mixer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, is produced by a process that comprises granulating in the presence of water to form granules, drying the granules, and optionally screening the granules, for example, through a wire mesh screen. All of the ingredients of the composition may be added prior to or during the granulation. Alternatively, all or a portion of one or more of the ingrediente may be added after the granulation step is complete. For example, all or a portion of anti-adherent (e.g.’ silica), all or a portion of lubricant (e.g., magnesium stearate) and/or all or a portion of disintegrant (e.g., croscarmellose or any salt thereof) may be added after the granulation. In a preferred aspect of the invention, all ingredients except the magnesium stearate and the colloidal silica are loaded into the granulator, then they are added later.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the process of producing the composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, may be performed wiltiout the need for a pulverization step. As used herein, the terms 'pulverization' and "pulverize" refer to any process that involves the grinding or smashing cutting of particles to reduce the particles' size. In a prefen-ed aspect of the invention, the composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, Is capable of being produced without pulverizing tiie granules between the granulation step and the drying and/or compression step used to form the granules into a tablet<br>
The composition, in particular pharmaceutical composition, described herein is further capable of being granulated VM*thout ttie need for pulverization before or after the granulati*on step. As used herein, tfie term "capable of being granulated wittiout ttie need<br><br>
for pulverization" defines a property of the composition as opposed to a requirement that the composition is actually produced without a pulverization step. Thus, the term "capable of..." when used to describe a composition, specifically does not impose any process or product-by-process limitation on the composition. The composition is further capable of being successfully fornied, by compression for example, Into tablets ready for administration to the patient.<br>
It has been observed that after granulation, a granular composition having an acceptable granule size was obtained even though water was added during the granulation. More specifically, the composition, in particular phanmaceutical composition, is capable of being grnulated (and successfully tabletted after granulation) in the presence of about 25 to about 80% percent by weight of water without the need for the above-mentioned pulverization. Preferably, the granulation may be perfomied with the addition of about 25 to about 40 percent by weight water. More preferably, the granulation may be performed with the addition of about 22 to about 37 percent by weight water, and even more preferably 27 percent by weight water, when producing tablets containing 120 mg, 90 mg, 60 mg, and 30 mg of nateglinide. When producing 180 mg nateglinide tablets, preferably about 33 to about 40, and more preferable, 33 to about 37 percent by weight of water is added to the granulation. Because the granules may be screened, after a drying step, without the loss of substantial quantities of material, a pulverization step may be successfully avoided.<br>
