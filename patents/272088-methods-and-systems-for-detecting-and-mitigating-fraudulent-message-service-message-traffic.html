				<td>purposes, each requires screening on a per subscriber basis, which can become cumbersome as the number of subscribers and the volume of message traffic increase. In addition, each of these methods may fail to stop fraudulent message service message traffic that appears to be from an authorized sender and that does not cause a flooding threshold to be exceeded.<br>
Accordingly, in light of these difficulties associated with conventional message service message screening mechanisms, there exists a need for methods, systems, and computer program products for detecting and mitigating fraudulent message service message traffic.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

It is determined whether the SCCP CgPA parameter contains an<br>
SCCP address that is associated with the first communications networl<. in response to determining that the sccp cgpa parameter contains an address is associated with first communication network a mitigating action performed.></.>
According to another aspect, a method for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic based on unbalanced message service message traffic flow is provided. The method includes monitoring a number of message service messages received from a communications network. A number of message service messages sent to the communications network is monitored. It is determined whether the number of message service messages received from the communications network and the number of message service messages sent to the communications network differ by at least a threshold amount, where an amount can include an absolute number or a percentage of total message traffic transmitted between the networks.

According to yet another aspect, message service message fraud may be detected by dark number analysis. In one exemplary method, a first message service message is observed. The first message includes a message recipient identifier and a message originator identifier. It is determined whether the message recipient identifier is to an unassigned or dark number. In response to determining that the message recipient identifier is an unassigned or dark number, the message originator is identified as a suspicious originator, in response to observing a second message service message sent by the message originator, a mitigating action is performed.<br>
According to yet another aspect, message service message fraud may be detected by observing en-or messages generated by message service messages that are sent to dark or unassigned numbers. In one exemplary implementation, a method for detecting such fraud may include observing a message service error reporting message that is associated with an attempt to deliver a message service message from a message originator to an unknown subscriber. It is determined wliether tlie message originator lias triggered more than a predetermined threshold number of message service error reporting messages. In response to determining that the message originator has triggered more than a predetermined threshold number of message service error reporting messages, a mitigating action Is performed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer program products for detecting and mitigating fraudulent message service message traffic. Figure 1 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary overall steps of a method for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 1, in step 100, message service message traffic may be monitored. The monitoring of message service message traffic may be performed on actual message service messages that are routed through the network or on copies of those messages. In one implementation, message service messages may be monitored by a routing node that routes signaling messages. Figure 2 is a block diagram of an exemplary routing node for detecting fraudulent message service messages. In Figure 2, routing node 200 includes a message service message monitoring function 202 that identifies message service messages from ingress messages.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, in block 102, it is determined that the monitored message service message traffic is fraudulent based on the presence of at least one of:<br>
(a)	message service message traffic received at a first network from a second network where the message service message traffic includes at least one message that has an SCCP calling party address internal to the first network;<br>
(b)	a volume of message service message traffic received at the first network from the second network that exceeds a volume of message service message traffic sent by the first network to the second network by a threshold amount; and<br>
(c)	message service message traffic that is sent to a dark number. Returning to Figure 2, routing node 200 includes a message service message fraud detection function 204 that detects the presence of message service message fraud by one or more of the methods described in block 102 of Figure 1.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, in block 104, a mitigating action is performed in response to determining that the monitored message service message traffic is fraudulent. For example, referring to Figure 2, message service message fraud detection function 204 may take appropriate action based on a determination that the monitored message service message traffic is fraudulent. If the traffic is determined to be fraudulent because a fraudulent SCCP calling party address has been inserted in a message service message, it may be desirable to block message service messages from the sending network that have the identified calling party address. If the traffic is detennined to be fraudulent because of an imbalance of message service message traffic between networks, it may be desirable to block all trafTic from the network that is sending the higher volume of traffic, as this higher volume may indicate spam. If the traffic is determined to be fraudulent based on messages being directed to a dark number, the sender of such messages may be blocked from sending further message service messages into a network. Each of these fraud detection functions will now be described in more detail.<br>
As stated above, one method for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic includes determining whether the calling party address in a received message is internal and the message was received from an external network. In general, an internal or local SCCP calling party address should not be present in messages coming from an outside network. As such, if an observed message service message is received on a signaling link that is used to connect to an outside or foreign network, and the CgPA parameter value contained within the SCCP part of the message is associated with the local SCCP network entity, the message may be identified as fraudulent.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process for screening message service message traffic to determine the presence of message service message fraud through analysis of SCCP calling party address network information according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 3, in block 300, at a first communications network, a message service message is monitored. The message service message is received from a second communications network. The message service message includes an SCCP calling party address parameter. Figure 4 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary system for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 4, a signal transfer point 400 includes monitoring function 202 and message service message fraud detection function 204 described above. Monitoring function 202 may identify received message service message traffic and fon/vard the message service message traffic to fraud detection function 204. STP 400 also includes a message service message proxy 402 for providing message service to subscribers of the Internet. A mobile switching center (MSG) 404 provides switching services for mobile terminal 408, which connects to MSG 404 via base station 406. An SMSG 410 performs store and fonA/ard processing for received message service messages. A home location register 412 stores subscriber data and location infonnation.<br>
In operation, when monitoring function 202 receives and identifies a message service message, monitoring function 202 fonvards the message to fraud detection function 204. Returning to Figure 3, in blocks 302 and 304, it is detemnined whether the SGGP GgPA parameter in the message contains an address that is associated with the first networi
Message service messages that are screened for fraud may be transmitted using SS7 message transfer part layers 1-3 or Internet protocol. For example, messages screened by node 400 may be sent over traditional SS7 signaling links or over IP signaling links, using an IETF SIGTRAN SGGP user adaptation layer. The fraud detection performed by the subject matter described herein is independent of the underiying transport layer used to carry message service message traffic through the networl<.></.>
Figure 5 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components of STP 400 for identifying fraudulent message service message traffic according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Refening to Figure 5, STP 400 includes a plurality of modules 500,502, and 504 connected to each other via a bus 505. Each module 500, 502, and 504 may include a printed circuit board with an application processor and a communications processor mounted thereon. The application processor of each module performs signaling message processing functions, including, in some cases, the identification of fraudulent message service message traffic. The communications processor on each module controls communication with other modules via bus 505.<br>
In the illustrated example, module 500 comprises a link interface module (LIM) for interfacing with SS7 signaling links. LIM 500 includes a message transfer part level 1 and 2 function 506, I/O queue 508, a gateway screening function 510, a discrimination function 512, a distribution function 514, and a routing function 516. MTP level 1 and 2 function 506 performs MTP level 1 and 2 operations for received messages, such as error detection, error correction, and message sequencing. I/O queue 508 queues inbound messages for processing the higher layers. Gateway screening function 510 screens incoming messages to determine whether to allow the messages into the network. Discrimination function 512 determines whether received messages are addressed to STP 400 or are to be through switched. Through switched messages may be fonA/arded to routing function 516 for distribution to the card or module associated with the outbound signaling link. Messages addressed to STP 400 may be passed to distribution function 514 for fonvarding to another module for internal processing.<br>
DCM 502 includes hardware and software for interfacing with IP signaling links. In the illustrated example, only the modules associated with outbound message processing are shown. In particular, DCM 502 includes an adaptation layer function 516 for implementing one of the SIGTRAN protocols for sending SS7 messages over IP links, a transport layer function 518 for performing transport layer functions, such as connection oriented transport of messages over IP, a network layer function 520 for performing network layer functions, such as routing, and a physical layer 522 for performing physical layer functions, such as error detection, error correction, and physical transmission of a message over a signaling link. Transport layer 518 may be implemented using UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Network layer 520 may be implemented using IP. Physical layer 522 may be implemented using a suitable physical layer protocol, such as Ethernet. DCM 502 may also include components 510, 512, 514, and 516 for processing inbound IP encapsulated SS7 messages.<br>
Module 504 comprises a database services module (DSM) for performing database related processing of messages. In one embodiment, database related processing includes identification of message service messages and screening those messages for fraud detection through network analysis of SCCP calling party address network information. In particular, DSM 504 includes message service message monitoring function 202 and message service message fraud detection function 204. In this example, fraud detection function 204 is configured to identify fraudulent message service messages based on the presence of an SCCP calling party parameter that is associated with an internal network when the message is received from an external network.<br>
In operation, when a message service message is received via an SS7 signaling link, it is passed up SS7 protocol the stack to message distribution function 514, which distributes the message to DSM 504for further processing. Monitoring function 202 identifies the message as a message service message and fonvards the message to fraud detection function 204. Fraud detection function 204 performs a lookup to determine whether the SCCP calling party address parameter in the message identifies an internal network when the message is from an external network. In response to detemriining that an internal SCCP calling party address is received from an extemal network, fraud detection function 204 may perfomi a mitigating action, such as discarding the message, generating alert, etc.<br>
Figure 6 is a table illustrating exemplary data that may be used by fraud detection function 204 in identifying internal SCCP addresses received on external linksets and performing the appropriate actions. In Figure 6, the first column in the table identifies the linkset on which the message was received. This information may be determined by having the receiving module insert a linkset identifier in the message or any other suitable means by which the receiving linkset may be identified. The second column in the table identifies the SCCP calling party address. In the first entry of the table, the first calling party address is assumed to be an external calling party address. Accordingly, the action identified in the third column is to allow the message. In the second entry in the table, the calling party address is assumed to be an internal calling party address. Accordingly, the action identified in the third column of the table is to block the message.<br>
Returning to Figure 5, if a message is allowed, it may be passed to routing function 516, which routes the message to its destination via the appropriate link interface module. If the message is blocked, screening function 204 may delete the message and generate a notification to the appropriate party.<br>
Figure 7 is a network diagram illustrating an alternate example of a system for identifying fraudulent message service message traffic according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 7, the network includes the same components illustrated in Figure 4. However, rather than perfontiing message service message fraud detection at STP 400, the detection is performed at a message service message processing platfomri (MPP) 700.<br>
Figure 8 is a block diagram of an exemplary internal architecture of message processing platform 700 according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 8, message processing platform 700 includes an SS7 or IP protocol stack 802 for sending and receiving message service messages over an IP network. An I/O queue 804 queues messages for inbound and outbound processing. A service selection manager 806 screens incoming messages to identify the type of service required for the messages. Message service message monitoring function 202 may be implemented as a sub-function of service selection manager 806 for identifying message service messages for a fraud detection function. A plurality of screening processes 808 may screen messages based on the identified service type. In the illustrated example, message service message fraud detection function 204 may be one of the screening processes 808. An SCCP calling party address network analysis database 810 may include data similar to that illustrated in Figure 6 for screening message service messages. A usage measurements and billing database 812 may also be provided to generate billing data for message service messages that pass screening and are delivered.<br>
In operation, when a message service message is received, it is passed by protocol stack 802 to I/O queue 804. Service selection manager 806 invokes MSM monitoring function 202 to identify the service type required for the message. In this example, the service type is assumed to be MSM fraud detection. Accordingly, the message is passed to MSM fraud detection function 204. MSM fraud detection function 204 performs a lookup in SCCP CgPA network analysis database 810 detemnine whether the SCCP calling party address in the message corresponds to an internal calling party address received on a link from an external network. If this condition is true, MSM fraud detection function 204 may perform a mitigating action, such as dropping the message. If the message passes, it may be passed by fraud detection function 204 to I/O queue 804 and through protocol stack 802 to be sent over the network to the destination. A billing entry 812 may be modified to indicate that screening has occurred and/or that the message is delivered.<br>
Figure 9 is a network diagram illustrating yet another embodiment of a system for identifying fraudulent message service message traffic according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Refening to Figure 9, a network includes components 404, 406, and 408 previously described. In addition, the network includes a gateway mobile switching center 900 that connects network 418 to remote networks 414 and 902. Message service message monitoring and fraud detection may be performed by a message service message monitoring and fraud detection platform 904 that includes functions 202 and 204 described above. In addition, platfomn 902 includes link probes 906 that passively copy signaling messages that traverse signaling links 908. Thus, rather than screening messages that are actually delivered or not delivered, platform 904 screens signaling message copies, which is less disruptive to message delivery. Other than screening message copies, the operation of platform 904 is the same as that described above with regard to the examples illustrated in Figures 3-8.<br>
According to another aspect of the subject matter described herein, fraudulent message service message traffic may be indicated by an imbalance in ingress and egress message service message traffic at a network. For example, fraudulent message service message traffic may be identified by monitoring and analyzing the ratio or relative volumes of message service message traffic received from and sent to a remote network. Ingress and egress message service message statistics may be compiled and analyzed for message service message traffic communicated between different network operators. Figure 10 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic based on relative ingress and egress message service message traffic volumes according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 10, in step 1000, a number of message service messages received from a communications network is monitored. Referring to the network example illustrated in Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may monitor the volume of message service messages received from remote network 414.<br>
Returning to Figure 10, in step 1002, a number of message service messages sent to the communications network are monitored. For example, in Figure 4, message service message monitoring function 202 may fonward message service messages to fraud detection function 204. Fraud detection function 204 may monitor the number of messages sent to network 414.<br>
Returning to Figure 10, in step 1004, it is detemiined whether the number of message service messages received from the communications network and the number of message sen/ice messages sent to the communications network differ by at least a threshold amount. Returning to Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may determine whether the number of messages sent to network 414 differs from the number of messages received from network 414 by at least a threshold amount. In step 1006, in response to determining that the number of message service messages received from the communications network and the number of message service messages sent to the communications network differ by at least a threshold amount, a mitigating action is performed. For example, in Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may perform a mitigating action, such as generating an alarm to the network operator, generating an alert to the intended recipient, and/or discarding the message.<br>
The functionality for detecting message service message fraud through analysis of ingress and egress traffic balance may be implemented on any suitable platform, such as routing node 200 illustrated in Figure 2, STP 400 illustrated in Figure 5, MPP 700 illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, or monitoring platform 904 illustrated in Figure 9. Exemplary data for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic through analysis of ingress and egress traffic balance is illustrated in Figure 11. Referring to Figure 11, a message service message egress ingress table maintains message counts for messages sent to and from different networks. In particular, the first entry in the table is for network 1. In network 1, egress count for the network exceeds the ingress count by over 100,000 messages. The disparity threshold is 1000. The time period during which the counts are compared is 30 minutes. Thus, when a new message anrives at network 1, the ingress count is incremented. When a new message leaves network 1, the egress count is incremented. A running 30 minute time window is used for the analysis so that the disparity threshold has meaning. Since the ingress and egress counts differ by an amount that is greater than the disparity threshold, the action is triggered. In this example, the action is an alarm. In the second example in the table illustrated in Figure 11, for network 2, the ingress and egress counts differ by only one. The disparity threshold is a 1000. Accordingly, the mitigating action is not triggered.<br>
According to another aspect of the subject matter described herein, fraudulent message service message traffic may be identified by analyzing patterns of message service messages that are sent to unassigned or dark numbers. The dark number may be an MSISDN number or other mobile identification number that has not been assigned to a mobile subscriber. In one implementation, a network operator may reserve one or more mobile identification numbers for the purpose of assisting and identifying fraudulent message service messages. That is, the one or more mobile Identification numbers within a range of assignable numbers may intentionally be unassigned for the purpose of detecting fraudulent message service message traffic.<br>
Figure 12 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps for detecting fraudulent message service message traffic based on messages sent to unassigned or dark numbers according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to Figure 12, in step 1200, a first message service message is observed. The first message service message includes a recipient identifier and an originator identifier. Refening to Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may receive a message and identify the recipient and originator Identifier. In step 1202, It may be determined whether the message recipient Identifier ran-esponds to an unassigned number. Returning to Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may access a database of unassigned numbers that are intentionally unprovisioned by the network operator for purposes of fraud detection.<br>
In step 1204, in response to determining that the message recipient identifier is an unassigned number, the message originator may be Identified as a suspicious originator. Retuming to Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may identify the message originator as suspicious because the message originator sent a message to an unassigned number.<br>
In step 1206, in response to receiving a second message service message sent by the message originator, a mitigating action may be performed. For example, refen^ing to Figure 4, once a message originator sends a message to unassigned number, fraud detection function 204 may provision a database so that further messages from that originator may be blocked, alerts may be generated, or other mitigating actions may be performed.<br>
In one implementation, SMS fraud detection application 204 may include a database or table that contains a list of unassigned or dari( mobile identification numbers. Fraud detection application 204 may also include a message buffer that temporarily buffers at least a portion of one or more of the monitored message service messages. Fraud detection application 204 may examine message recipient infomiation contained in an observed message service message and determine whether the message recipient identifier is included In the darl
Subsequently received message service messages may be examined by fraud detection application 204 to detemiine whether the message originator associated with each obsen/ed message service message is contained in the<br>
suspicious originator list. If a predetermined number of message service<br>
"i<br>
messages are observed from a message originator that is contained in the suspicious originator list, then messages from that message originator may be blocked or discarded and alarms may be generated.<br>
The subject matter for detecting message service message fraud based on messages sent to dark or unassigned numbers can be implemented using any suitable platfomi, such as routing node 200 illustrated in Figure 2, STP 400 illustrated in Figure 4, message processing platform 700 illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, or monitoring and fraud detection platform 904 illustrated in Figure 9.<br>
According to another aspect of the subject matter described herein, fraudulent message service message traffic sent to unassigned numbers may be identified based on the presence of error messages generated in response to messages sent to unknown subscribers. Figure 13 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps for detecting message service message fraud based on messages sent to unknown subscribers. Refening to Figure 13, in step 1300, a message service message error reporting message that is associated with an attempt to deliver a message service message from a message originator to an unknown subscriber may be received. For example, fraud detection function 204 illustrated in Figure 4 may detect SMS error messages that are sent in response to an SMS message that is sent to an unknown subscriber. Such error messages may be triggered by the SMSC. In step 1302, it is determined whether the message service message has triggered more than a threshold number of error messages. For example, in Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may maintain a number of error messages generated for different subscribers. In step 1304, in response to determining that the message originator has triggered more than the predetermined threshold of error messages, a mitigating action may be performed. For example, in Figure 4, fraud detection function 204 may block future messages from the originator or notify the network operator.<br>
In one implementation, fraud detection function 204 may observe MAP FailureReport messages and maintain counts or statistics associated with the number of failure report messages that report an unknown subscriber error. If the number of failure report messages exceeds a predetermined threshold value, then a mitigating action may be performed. Mitigating actions may include, but are not limited to, discarding or blocking transmission of subsequent message service messages from the originator or the message service message that triggered the failure report messages, generating an alarm, or generating an alert notification message that may be sent to a network operation staff member. The functionality for detecting message service message fraud based on error messages, such as failure report messages may be implemented using any suitable platform, such as routing node 200 illustrated in Figure 2, STP 400 illustrated in Figure 4, message processing platfonn 700 illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, or monitoring and fraud detection platform 904 illustrated in Figure 9.<br>
It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter. Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
