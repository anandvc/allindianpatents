				<td>Field of the Technology<br>
The invention generally relates to optical transmission module with digital adjustment and the adjusting method in an optical communication system and its parameters.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In an optical communication system, an optical transmission module converts an electrical signal to an optical signal, and its performance affects the system performance directly. Therefore, an optical transmission module is important in the system. Conventionally, an optical transmission module with analog adjustment is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig.l, the optical transmission module is mainly consisted of four parts: a laser 11, which performs electro-optical conversion; a laser driver 12, which makes impedance match, drives the laser and sets parameters; an automatic power control (APC) circuit 13, which makes power of the transmitted signal stable; and an automatic temperature control (ATC) circuit 14, which makes temperature of the laser stable to guarantee a stable optical wavelength.<br>
Input signals of an optical transmission module include a differential clock signal and a differential data signal, which are inputted to the laser driver 12, the laser shutdown signal, which is inputted to the APC circuit 13. The signals for reporting upward performance of an optical transmission module, include the laser refrigerating current outputted from ATC circuit 14; the average power of a transmitted optical signal outputted from APC circuit 13, and the laser bias current.<br>
Parameters of the optical transmission module are adjusted mainly through potentiometers. Extinction ratio and cross point of the laser is adjusted by the potentiometers Rl and R2 through the laser driver 12. The optical wavelength trimming signal of the optical transmission module is adjusted by the potentiometer<br>
R3 through ATC circuit 14. The optical power of the optical transmission module is adjusted by the potentiometer R4 through APC circuit 13.<br>
There are also other additional circuits, such as a laser shutdown circuit, a power supply etc. Since they are no relation with the invention, so they have not been drawn here.<br>
Advantages of the optical transmission module with analog adjustment are mature technically, and are popularly used by communication device vendors; but there are disadvantages:<br>
(1)	Accuracy and stability of parameters of the optical transmitter depends on accuracy and stability of the potentiometers, and a potentiometer changes its resistance by changing the slider position, which is a mechanical device. Since contacts of a mechanical potentiometer have problems of contact fault, temperature drift and contact moving etc., drift of potentiometer parameters is unavoidable.<br>
(2)	adjustment of a potentiometer is complicated so that it is difficult for an optical transmission module to be implemented automatic production and production cost will be higher during manufacture. In addition, performance of an optical transmission module depends on skills of workers, so it is difficult to guarantee performance consistency of products.<br>
(3)	It is difficult to create a product database for parameters of adjustment and testing of optical transmission module products. The product database is very important for ameliorating performance of optical transmission module.<br>
(4)	During application, parameters of an optical transmission module will be drift along with increasing of service time. It is necessary to adjust parameters of an optical transmitter without interrupting its service, but this is impossible for a device adjusted by potentiometers.<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Reference to drawings, the invention will be described in more detail.<br>
Fig.2 shows a diagram of an optical transmission module with digital adjustment. Comparing with Fig.l shown a diagram of an optical transmission module with analog adjustment, the similar parts include the laser 21, which performs electro-optical conversion; the laser driver 22, which makes impedance match, drives the laser and sets parameters; the automatic power control (APC) circuit 23, which makes<br>
the transmitted power stable; and the automatic temperature control (ATC) circuit 24, which makes temperature of the laser stable to guarantee a stable optical wavelength.<br>
Input signals of an optical transmission module include the differential clock signal and the differential data signal, which are inputted to the laser driver 22, the laser shutdown signal, which is inputted to the APC circuit 23. The laser outputs the optical signals. The signals for reporting upward performance of an optical fransmission module, include the laser refrigerating current outputted from ATC circuit 14; the average power of a fransmitted optical signal outputted from APC circuit 13, and the laser bias current.<br>
The digital adjustment circuit 25 and memory 26 are parts that are newly added for the invention. The digital adjustment circuit 25 respectively sends adjustment signals of extinction ratio and cross point to the laser driver 22, optical wavelength trimming signal to ATC circuit 24 and optical power adjustment signal to APC circuit, which are performed by potentiometers Rl to R4 in Fig. 1.<br>
In the following, the digital adjustment circuit 25, the memory 26 and their adjusting method will be further described.<br>
Reference to Fig.3 and Fig.5 and compare Fig.3 with Fig.2, Fig.3 shows the devices of the memory 26 and the digital adjustment circuit 25. The memory 26 applies I2C EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) with 24C64 I2C interface, which has great storages and simple interfaces, and is used for storing parameters of the optical transmission modules. The digital adjustment circuit 25 applies digital-to-analog converter (DAC) device that is consisted of 12 bits serial D/A converter connecting with four operational amplifiers. The input signals of wherein 12 bits serial D/A converter are a serial clock signal, a chip strobe signal and the serial data, and wherein 12 bits serial D/A converter outputs four analog signals, which are converted levels respectively by the four operational amplifiers to form a extinction ratio adjustment signal, a cross point adjustment signal, an optical power adjustment signal and an optical wavelength trimming signal.<br>
DAC device is a digital-to-analog converter. The output voltage of a 12bits DAC satisfies the following formula:<br>
Wherein V0 is the analog output voltage, VREF is the reference voltage, Data are the digital input of DAC device and N is the number of bits of the DAC device.<br>
Reference to Fig.4 and Fig.6 and compare Fig.4 with Fig.2, Fig.4 shows the memory 26 and the digital adjustment circuit 25. The memory 26 applies I2C EEPROM with 24C64 I2C interface, which has great storages and simple interfaces, and is used for storing parameters of the optical transmission modules. The digital adjustment circuit 25 applies digital adjustment potentiometer that is consisted of 64 grades potentiometer connecting with four operational amplifiers. The input signals of the 64 grades potentiometer are a serial clock signal, a chip strobe signal and the serial data, and the 64 grades potentiometer outputs four analog signals, which are converted levels respectively by the four operational amplifiers to form: a extinction ratio adjustment signal, a cross point adjustment signal, an optical power adjustment signal and an optical wavelength trimming signal.<br>
Reference to Fig.7, the digital adjustment potentiometer is consisted of connecting a resistance array with a multi-channel selection analog switch (64 channels). The resistance array is consisted of the first to sixty-third resistances that are serially cormected between PI and P2. By writing different data to the register of the multi-channel selection analog switch, different analog switch is cormected to the output PW, so output voltage can be changed. This is similar to the moving of the slider of a mechanical potentiometer.<br>
Two embodiments of the digital adjustment circuit that is kernel of an optical transmission module are shown in Fig.3 to Fig.7. First embodiment applies DAC device for the digital adjustment circuit and takes DAC mode. Second embodiment applies digital adjustment potentiometer for the digital adjustment circuit and takes digital potentiometer mode. Both embodiments all apply a memory.<br>
In both embodiments, four operational amplifiers implement level conversion and impedance isolation. The output voltage range of a digital adjustment potentiometer or a DAC device is 0 to Vref (reference voltage). When using different laser drivers, the adjusted voltage ranges of optical transmission module are different.<br>
In practice, the adjustment signal range of extinction ratio, cross point and optical power is 0 to -4V, and the range of the optical wavelength trimming signal is 2 to -2V. These different ranges of adjustment voltages can be obtained by level conversion in the four operation amplifiers. Furthermore, output impedance of a DAC device or a digital adjustment potentiometer is larger, so load capability is worse. In the embodiments, with high input impedance of the operational amplifiers, impedance isolation between an adjusted chip and a digital adjustment potentiometer or a DAC device can be implemented.<br>
In the embodiments, data of an optical transmission module, which are stored in the EEPROM, includes: a parameter table of optical transmission modules, a table for upward reporting transmission optical power of lasers and information of modules. Among them, the parameter table is a basis for on-line optical power adjustment. Taking a DAC device as a digital adjustment circuit, the parameter table of an optical transmission module is described in the following.<br>
The parameter table of an optical transmission module is shown in Table 1. The index item is a preset transmitted power taking dBm as a unit, and its range is from -3.0 to +3.0 with a space of 0.5dBm (stored data are two's complement represented by a hex). Other items are optical power data, extinction ratio data, cross point data and optical wavelength data, and they are all represented by two bytes of a hex that will be written to DAC device corresponding channels.<br>
Table<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 Since extinction ratio data, optical power data, cross point data and optical wavelength data are linear function of its adjustment voltage, so when adjusting and testing an optical transmission module, only two points are needed to obtain the laser parameters. By obtaining parameters of a laser at these two points, parameters of a laser in the whole range of output optical power can be obtained. Limited by computing overhead and storage, in this invention every 0.5dBm is a space for storing data in the EEPROM. When reading out, software can obtain parameters of a laser at any transmitted optical power by looking for the table and calculating with linear interpolation.<br>
Reference to Fig. 8, creation of the parameters table of an optical transmission module is further described.<br>
First step, when the laser emitting optical power is at about -2dBm, adjust and test parameters of the optical transmission module so that the extinction ratio, the cross point and the optical wavelength satisfy the ITU-T standards; and then record a<br>
group of data: a transmitted optical power (Power 1), DAC channel data of an optical power (DAC-Power 1), DAC channel data of a extinction ratio, DAC channel data of a cross point (DAC- 1) and DAC channel data of an optical wavelength (DAC-Wave 1).<br>
Second step, change the laser emitting optical power to about +1.0dBm, do the same adjusting and testing as step 1 and record the second group of data: Power 2, DAC-Power 2, DAC channel data of a extinction ratio, DAC- 2 and DAC-Wave 2.<br>
Third step, since every adjusted and tested parameter are linear function of the transmitted optical power (dBm unit is transformed to mW unit here), connect these two points, obtained at step 1 and step 2 respectively, with a linear line, curves of DAC-Optical Power function, DAC-Extinction Ratio function, DAC-cross Point function and DAC-Optical wavelength function are drawn, respectively.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a curve of DAC-Extinction Ratio function of the transmitted optical power. The two points are [0.56mW(-2.0dBm), 0A08H] and [1.41mW(1.5dBm), 0794H]. From this curve, DAC-Extinction Ratio data of every expected transmitted optical power can be obtained. Similarly, a curve of DAC-Optical Power function of the transmitted optical power, a curve of DAC-function of the transmitted optical power, a curve of DAC-Optical wavelength fimction of the transmitted optical power can be obtained. When the transmitted optical power is taken with every 0.5dBm in the range. Table 1 is obtained.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a direct adjustment laser with refrigeration structure. In this structure TEC is a refrigerating silicon, TH is a heat-sensitive resistance, and a pair of optical transmitter diodes and optical receiver diodes (PIN diodes) are used for optical detection by against light and reporting upward the laser emitting optical power. For a laser with refrigeration, if a bias is provided for the PIN diodes, the optical current is a linear function of the input optical power (mW). Therefore, a curve of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) data function of transmitted optical power can be defined by the two points method used above, and the table for upward reporting transmitted optical power can be created.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a curve of ADC data function of transmitted optical power. The two points are [0.56mW (   - 2.0dBm ) ,029FH] and [1.41mW ( l.5dBm ) ,05ACH].<br><br>
From this curve, ADC data corresponding to every expected transmitted optical power<br>
can be obtained. When every 0.5dBm transmitted optical power is taken, the table for upward reporting transmitted optical power (Table 2) can be obtained.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 Limited by float-point processing capability of CPU and overhead of software, the ADC data of transmitted optical power are obtained by looking up the table and taking linear interpolation.<br>
In the memory, information of an optical transmission module are kept in ASCII characters, mainly including vendor information, type code of the module, produced date, the product sequence number etc.<br>
The module information, such as the exclusive product sequence number, is convenience for management and quality trace; and is written once during production then it is read only and is not modified and deleted.<br>
Reference to Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, which show respectively reporting upward principle and procedure of the transmitted optical power. Analog value of a transmitted optical power is detected against by light, and is inputted to ADC after<br>
amplified by an operational amplifier. The converted value is a digital data and serially outputted from the serial interface of the ADC. With the data by looking up the table upward reporting transmitted optical power in the EEPROM and taking linear interpolation, a transmitted optical power can be obtained and reported upward through the EEPROM serial interface.<br>
Fig. 13 shows the invention adjustment procedure of transmitted optical power of an optical transmission module that is adjusted digitally. The digital adjustment hardware is a DAC device or a digital adjustment potentiometer. With software, the transmitted optical power and other parameters are continuously adjusted, and implementation steps includes:<br>
Creating a parameter table of the optical transmission module. Table 1, and storing in the memory;<br>
Looking up the table based on an expected transmitted optical power, and taking linear interpolation to obtain the corresponding DAC data;<br>
Writing the DAC data to DAC channel<br>
Before executing the steps above, whether legitimacy of the table is checked. If reported data is error, the procedure is ended.<br>
By setting a memory in an optical transmission module, the invention implements parameters setting and performance reporting. Through a digital adjustment circuit, parameters and transmitted optical power of an optical transmission module can be adjusted in digital mode.<br>
