FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system for providing back up to contents of a mobile phone.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
With enhancement in technology, mobile phones are becoming more than mere devices to carry on voice communication. As a result, text communication through mobile phones is gaining popularity. Sometimes text messages being sent and received by mobile phones contain useful information and to preserve this information a back up is required. With the existing methodology SMS (Short Message Service) can be stored in a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP) to create a back up and can then be printed out from the MFP. But if some problem occurs in the internal hardware of the MFP, the stored back up data will be lost. Hence there is a need for a method and system to address this issue.<br>
One such technique has been disclosed in EP1437903. The patent describes a method and system for configuring a mobile phone to a printer. In an implementation, a mobile phone receives a message that includes printer information to be printed by the printer. A short message system can be, used to transmit the message to the mobile phone, The printer information is processed and stored in printer configuration memory in the mobile phone. The mobile phone can be designed to automatically configure the appropriate memory locations according to the received printing information, or enable the user to<br><br>
copy the printing information to the appropriate memory locations. However, the patent does not explicitly mention the concept of transferring the contents of a mobile phone to a MFP. As a result, the method does not facilitate various options that are inbuilt in the MFP.<br>
This feature has been disclosed in another patent, EP1389882A1. The patent describes an apparatus having a printing function that includes control means and printing means. When SMS messages are received from an SMS centre (SMSC) via a transmitter, SMS terminal (SMTE) in a facsimile machine or a MFP having a short message service (SMS) function, the SMS messages are displayed on a display window. Further it is determined whether the SMS messages are stored, whether the stored and registered SMS messages are printed in the order of a descending series or an ascending series. Subsequently, the SMS messages are printed. However in case if the MFP's hardware circuitry crashes then the stored SMS will be lost. The present invention has been designed to address this issue.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a method and system to transfer contents of a mobile phone like SMS and phone book data to a Multi Functional Peripheral and create a backup.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to transfer the SMS or phone book data backed up in the MFP to a Personal Computer (PC) in the form of a file or any other format.<br><br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to transfer the SMS or phone book data backed up in the MFP to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) storage device or to an e-mail address in the form of a file or any other format.<br>
According to the present invention, a user of a mobile phone selects options available through a user interface of the mobile phone for storing and printing content of the mobile phone. For example, the content can be an SMR and/or phone book data. After selecting the option, the mobile phone searches for the surrounding wireless devices. Once it identifies a MFP supporting a wireless interface, a connection between the mobile phone and the MFP is established. Subsequently, the content from the mobile phone is sent to the MFP for storing and printing jobs. Further, the content after getting stored in the MFP can be transferred to a PC in the form of a file or any other format. Further, the content stored in the MFP can be transferred to a USB storage device or to an e-mail address in the form of a file or any other format.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for providing back up to content of a mobile phone, the method comprising:<br>
a.	sending the content of the mobile phone to a Multi Functional<br>
Peripheral (MFP), the MFP being a wireless device at the surrounding<br>
of the mobile phone;<br>
b.	sending the content by the MFP to one or more devices; and<br>
c.	saving the content of the mobile phone at the MFP and the one or<br>
more devices.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a system for providing back up to content of a mobile phone, the system comprising:<br><br>
a.	a mobile phone configured to send the content;<br>
b.	a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP) configured to receive and save the<br>
sent content, the MFP being a wireless device at the surrounding of<br>
the mobile phone; and<br>
c.	one or more devices, the one or more devices configured to save the<br>
content sent by the mobile phone.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart illustrating the detailed steps for providing back up to content of a mobile phone, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawing. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawing are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for<br><br>
teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for providing backup to content of a mobile phone. The method involves transferring content like SMS and/or phone book data- from a mobile phone to a Multi Functional Peripheral (MFP). The content can then be stored or printed on the MFP, Further, the stored content in the MFP can be transferred to a Personal Computer (PC) in the form of a file or any other format. Furthermore, the stored content in the MFP can be transferred to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) storage device or to an e-mail address in the form of a file or any other format.<br>
According to the present invention, a mobile phone is configured and programmed with a user interface that provides various options like sending content to different devices, storing content as a file or any other format, and printing the content.<br>
A step by step process along with the involved system elements has been explained below, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention:<br>
1.	A user of a mobile phone selects one of the options provided by the mobile phone user interface<br>
2.	Mobile phone searches for surrounding wireless devices<br>
■	«<br>
3.	An MFP having a wireless interface is searched<br>
4.	The MFP sends an acknowledgement response to the mobile phone about the status whether it is ready to accept the job or not. In case the<br><br>
MFP is not ready, the mobile phone waits for a pre-defined time. Still if the MFP is not ready it searches for another wireless interface. However, if the MFP is ready, a connection between the mobile phone and the MFP gets established.<br>
5.	The mobile phone then sends content to the MFP<br>
6.	MFP receives the content and interprets the option selected by the user of the mobile phone.<br>
7.	If it is a send and store option, then a storage location is specified through the user interface of the MFP by selecting option for storing data in the MFP hard drive, or in an USB storage device or in an e-mail address.<br>
8.	Depending upon the storage location chosen, the data will be stored either in the MFP hard drive or in an USB storage device or in an e-mail address.<br>
9.	If it is a print job, the data will be sent from the mobile phone to a printer module of the MFP and data gets printed out.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, separate headers for each option selected by the user are added with the content transferred from the mobile phone to the MFP. Thereafter, the MFP extracts the header information from the content, interprets the option selected by the user, and takes appropriate actions.<br>
The above mentioned process has been explained below. Figure 1  is a flowchart<br><br>
illustrating the detailed steps for providing back up to content of a mobile phone, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The content can be for example an SMS and/or a phone book. The user of a mobile phone goes to the SMS or phone book option of the mobile phone and selects one among the options provided on the mobile phone. These options include but are not limited to send and store or print. The mobile phone then searches for surrounding wireless devices. When a MFP having wireless interface responds with an acknowledgement that is ready to accept the SMS/phone book data, then the mobile phone transmits the SMS/phone book data to the MFP along with a header information which contains the information whether the content has to be stored or it has to be printed . For example, the header information differentiates the 'send and store' option from the 'print' option. Accordingly, the MFP takes appropriate action.<br>
If the MFP identifies the option as 'send and store' then the MFP provides an option in the user interface specifying the storage location in which the SMS/ phone book data has to be stored. The storage location may be the MFP hard drive itself or it may be an USB storage device or it may be an e-mail address. When the storage location is specified, the MFP checks for the specified storage location and if it is the MFP hard drive itself then it stores the SMS/phone book data of the mobile phone in the hard drive of the MFP and provides an user interface option to select the stored content. If the MFP while checking for the storage location specified, finds the specified storage location as an USB storage device then the MFP hands over the SMS/phone book data<br><br>
to the USB driver which in turn will store it in the USB storage device in the form of a file or any other format.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, if the specified storage location is an USB storage device, then the USB storage device has to be connected to the MFP so that the SMS/phone book data can be transferred from the MFP to the USB storage device through the USB port of the MFP.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, if the MFP while checking for the storage location specified, finds the specified storage location as an e-mail address, then the MFP will hand over the SMS/phone book data to an e-mail module of the MFP. This module sends the SMS/phone book data to the configured e-mail address in the form of a file or any other format. In this case the MFP should have scan to e-mail capability so that it transfers the SMS/phonebook data to the e-mail address.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, if the MFP identifies the option as 'print' from the header information, then the MFP hands over the SMS/phone book data to the printer module of the MFP and the data gets printed out.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, the SMS/phone book data stored in the MFP can be transferred to a PC in the form of a file or any other<br>
format.<br>
