The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of meta-substituted arylalkanoic acids starting from m-aryl-olefins,<br>
A number of meta-substituted arylalkanoic acids are known, being pharmaceutically interesting as analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents, such as: 2-ami-no-3-benzoyl-phenylacetic acid (amfenac), 2-(3-phenoxy-phenyl)-propionic acid (fetoprotein), 2-(3-ben2oyl-phe-nyl)-propionic acid (ketoprofen), 2-(2-hydroxy-5-ben-zoyl-phenyl)-propionic acid, 2-(2-hydroxy-3-benzoyl-phe-nyl)-propionic acid, 2-(2-amino-5-benzoyl-phenyl)-pro-phonic acid, 2-(4-hydroxyben2oyl-phenyl)-propionic acid, 2-(3-hydroxybenzoyl-phenyl)-propionic acid, 3-(2-hydro-xybenzoyl-phenyl)-propionic acid, 2-(4-benzoylamino-phe-nyl)-propionic acid, 2-{3-ben2oyl-4-amino-phenyl-propio-nic acid), 2-(4-benzoyloxy-phenyl)-propionic acid.<br>
Some of these compounds have a well-established use in therapy; other compounds, such as 2-(2-hydroxy-5-ben-zoyl-phenyl)-propionic, 2-(2-hydroxy-3-benzoyl-phenyl)-propionic, 2-(4-hydroxy-benzoyl-phenyl)-propionic, 2-(3-hydroxybenzoyl-phenyl)-propionic acids, are examples of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory which are metabolites or potential metabolites of ketoprofen.<br>
Ketoprofen is one of the most widely used no steroidal antiinflammatory agents, with a consumption in the region of hundreds of thousands tons a year. The arrangement of meta-substituents to the aryl-aliphatic residue makes the processes for the total synthesis of<br><br>
these compounds rather expensive and complex, so that up to now no general procedures suitable for their preparation are known.<br>
The available, more established synthetic procedures involve usually reagents (bromine, cyanides, benzene) and/or carboxylation and alkylationâ€™s reactions which, although formerly usual, are now undesirable in terms of safety of the workers as well as environmental impact, which is nowadays an exceedingly serious problem.<br>
Now a process has been found for the preparation of meta-substituted arylalkanoic acids of formula<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl, A is a C1-C4 alkyl group or aryl, aryloxy or aroyl optionally substituted with one or more alkyl, hydroxy, amino, cyano, nitro, alkoxy, halo alkyl, haloalkoxy substituents;<br>
which comprises:<br>
a) Claisen rearrangement of compounds of formula (II):<br><br><br>
in which A'is C1-C6 alkyl group or benzyl, aryl, aryloxy or aroyl optionally substituted with one or more alkyl, hydroxy, amino, cyano, nitro, alkoxy, haloalkoxy substituents, and R is as defined above, X is 0, S or NH and the A' group is at the ortho or para position to the X-alkylene group, to give a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein A' and R are as defined above, XR1 is at the ortho position to the allyl chain and is a OH, NH2 or S(C3-C10) acyl group;<br>
b)	optional elimination of the -XR1 group be means of a dehydroxylation, deamination or desulfuration reaction;<br>
c)	oxidative cleavage of the compound (III);<br>
d)	elimination of the -XR1, OH or NH2 groups by dehydroxylation or deamination reactions, when not already carried out in step b).<br>
Claisen rearrangement of the compounds of formula II in step a) is effected using conventional conditions, for example using solvents such as hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, halo hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof, at a temperature ranging from about 50'C to the solvent's reflux temperature, for times from about 2 to about 10 hours.<br>
The compounds of formula II are known or they can be prepared according to known methods, starting from<br><br>
suitable phenols, anilines or thiophenyl, by reaction with suitable allyl or crotyl halides, in the presence of strong bases and of solvents such as halo hydrocarbons, ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof.<br>
The OH or NH2 groups resulting from the Claisen rearrangement at the ortho position to the allyl chain can be removed with conventional methods: in case of amino groups, nitrosation reactions with alkali nitrites will for example be used, followed by decomposition of the diazonium salt in the presence of copper sulfate catalytic amounts. The OH groups, on the other hand, can be removed treating the corresponding trifluoromesylate with formic acid and triethylamine in the presence of palladium acetate/triphenylphosphine complex. Said reactions can be indifferently carried out before or after the double bond degradation reaction to give the carboxylic acid (step c).<br>
The oxidative cleavage of the double bond can be carried out either by means of ozonolysis or using potassium permanganate in phase transfer conditions. During the oxidative cleavage of the double bond in phase transfer conditions with KMnO^, the benzyl group linked to the aromatic ring is oxidized at the same time into the benzoyl group.<br>
On the other hand, when the XRj^ group is an S-acyl group, known desulfuration reactions can be effected, for example by means of Raney nickel, but such reactions have to be carried out before the oxidative cleavage of the double bond. The desulfuration reaction can be carried out directly on the S-acyl group, or on the SH<br><br>
group,  resulting  from the hydrolysis of  the  S-acyl group.<br>
Claisen rearrangement of the compounds of formula II in which X is sulfur takes place in the presence of C3-C10 fatty acid anhydrides, for example butyric anhydride or higher ones, as described in Tetrahedron Letters 1971, 1969, to give directly the compounds of formula III wherein R-j^ is an acyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Of course, the synthesis of the compound known as amfenac (see above) requires no elimination of the amino group at the ortho position to the allyl chain.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly advantageous from the environmental point of view, allows to obtain the products in very high yields and provides a versatile synthetic procedure, adaptable to a number of meta-substituted arylacetic or arylpropionic acid derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE	1<br>
Preparation of Ketoprofen a) from 4-hydroxy-benzofenone<br><br>
Compound 1 (3 g, 15.1 mmoles) was dissolved in 30 ml of acetone,   2 (4.2 g, 30 mmoles) was added<br><br>
keeping the mixture under stirring. Compound 3 (1.6 ml, 15.5 mmoles) dissolved in 15 ml of acetone was dropped into the mixture, which was kept under stirring at room temperature for 12 hours and subsequently at 40Â°C for 3 hours. The reaction was complete (TLC control Hexane/EtOAc 8:2). Acetone was evaporated off, the residue was taken up with water (20 ml) and extracted with EtOAc (50 ml). The organic extracts were washed with brine and dried over Na2S04, then filtered and the solvent was evaporated off. 3.8 g (15 mmoles) of the product were recovered (pale yellow oil, solid at + 4'C) sufficiently pure to be used in the subsequent reaction. Hexane/EtOAc 7:3. Rf = 0.38.<br><br>
2.8 g of compound 4 (11.1 mmoles) were dissolved in DMA (dimethylaniline), heating to a temperature of 210' (temperature of the outer oil bath) for 10 hours (2 X 5 hours). The progress of the reaction was controlled by TLC (Hexane/Etoac 7:3) on a sample taken from the mixture and poured into a 2N HCl solution and extracted with EtOAc.<br>
At the end of 10 hours the starting product had almost disappeared; the mixture was worked up as the control samples. The organic extracts were washed first with 2N HCl to remove completely DMA,<br><br>
then with brine and dried over Na2S04, filtered and the solvent was evaporated off. A crude weighing 2.55 g was obtained, which was purified on a chromatographic column (Hexane/EtOAc 8:2). The resulting product had still a slightly yellow colour which disappeared upon washing with Hexane:EtOAc 7:3, 1.97 g (7.8 mmoles) of a white solid 5 were obtained. Hexane/EtOAc 7:3. Rf = 0,14.<br><br>
Compound 5 (1.8 g 7.15 mmoles) was dissolved in 18 ml of dry CH2CI2 under argon atmosphere. The mixture was cooled to a temperature of -25*C with an acetone/dry ice mixture. Compound 7 (1.27 ml, 7.3 mmoles) was added, stirring for 30 minutes, then 6 (1.17 ml, 7.15 mmoles) was added in small portions, checking the temperature. The mixture was kept under stirring at -25*0 for a further hour, then it was left to warm at room temperature, diluted with ethyl ether and washed with 2N HCl (3 x 10 ml) and with brine (2 x 10 ml). The mixture was then dried over Ha2S04, filtered and the solvent was evaporated off. 2.5 g of a pale yellow oil 8 were obtained, which was used in the subsequent reaction.<br>

Compound 8 (2.5 g, 6.52 mmoles) was dissolved in 18 ml of DMF, 12 (19.4 ml, 2.7 ml) was added at room temperature and subsequently compounds 9 (57 mg, 0.255 mmoles) and 10 (134 mg, 0.511 mmoles) were added under an argon stream. After that, compound 11 (0.6 g, 13.1 moles) was added in small amounts. Temperature was raised to 60'C for 1 hour. The solution changed colour to black. An amount of the mixture was taken with a capillary tube for the control, the content was shaken in 2N HCl and extracted with CH2C12. The TLC control showed the completion of the reaction. The cooled mixture was poured into 2N HCl and extracted repeatedly with ethyl ether. The organic phase was washed with 2N HCl, sat. NaHC03 and brine, then dried over NajSO^ and the solvent was evaporated off. Compound 13 was obtained as a yellow oil (1.45 g, 6.2 mmoles).  Hexane/EtOAc 95:5 - Rf = 0.65.<br><br><br>
Compound 13 (1.4 g, 5.93 mmoles) was dissolved in CH2CI2 (35 ml), then water (35 ml), cone. H2SO4 (1.89 ml), glacial acetic acid (0.7 ml) and a small amount of Aliquat were added. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room tempeÂ¬rature and KMnO^ (2.7 g, 17 mmoles) was added in small amounts, stirring for 48 hours. A TLC control of the organic phase evidenced the disappearance of the starting product. The mixture was added with Na2S20c until the brown colour due to manganese dioxide disappears completely, then it was diluted with CH2CI2 and the phases were separated. The organic phase was extracted with sat. NaHC03, the aqueous phase was acidified with 2N HCl and extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was dried over Na2S0^ and evaporated. The crude (950 mg) was taken up into a benzene/petroleum ether 6:20 mixture to crystallize pure Ketoprofen (white solid) (725 mg, 2.85 mmoles). CH2CI2/CH3OH 95:5 Rf = 0.14.<br><br><br>
Compound 15 (13 g, 0.23 moles) was suspended in 50 ml of H2O, 8 drops of cone. HCl were added and the mixture was heated to ebullition. After 1/2 hour compound 14 (10.4 g, 0.045 moles) dissolved in 50 ml of 95% EtOH was dropped therein. The mixture was heated again to ebullition, keeping reflux for 2 hours. A TLC control (Hexane/EtOAc 7:3) showed the reaction was complete. EtOH was evaporated off, the mixture was alkalinized with 2N NaOH, extracted with EtOAc (2x100 ml), dried over Ua2S0^ and the solvent was evaporated off. A pale yellow solid was obtained, which was washed with an hexane/EtOAc mixture. Compound 16 was obtained as a white solid (7.1 g, 0.036). Hexane/EtOAc 7:3 Rf = 0.3.<br><br>
Compound 16 (7.1 g, 0.036 moles) was dissolved in dry CHjClj (50 ml), 17 (3.46 ml, 0.036 moles) was added at room temperature, stirring for 12 hours. A TLC control (Hexane: EtOAc 7:3) evidenced the disappearance of the starting product. Solvent was evaporated off and the formed acetic acid was removed by evaporation (azeotropic mixture with toluene). 8.3 g (0.035 moles) of 18 as a white solid were obtained.  Hexane/EtOAc 7:3 Rf = 0.1.<br><br><br>
Compound 18 (8.2 g, 0.035 moles) was dissolved in hot CH2CI2 (80 ml) (50'C), the solution was left to cool slightly and 19 (2.1 g of a 50% mineral oil dispersion, 0.052 moles) was added. The mixture was heated to 50 C, stirring for 30 minutes. The abundant precipitate formed was added with compound 20 (4.23 ml, 0.042 moles) dissolved in 20 ml of dry CH2Cl2. The mixture was kept overnight at room temperature and at 50'C for 8 hours. The starting product had almost disappeared, the mixture was diluted with CH2CI2, washed with a 5% NaH2PO4 solution, then with brine. The organic phase was dried over Na2S04 and the solvent was evaporated off. Compound 21 was obtained as a pale yellow solid, which was sufficiently pure to be used in the subsequent reaction (8.6 g 0,029  moles).  Hexane/EtOAc  7:3 Rf = 0.44.<br><br><br>
95% EtOH (15 ml), cone, HCl (15 ml) was added and the mixture was heated to ebullition for 3 hours. The TLC control (Hexane/EtOAc 1:1) evidenced the formation of a UV active spot with Rf = 0. 21 had not completely disappeared. EtOH was evaporated off, the acid solution was washed with EtOAc to remove the residual starting product, the solution was alkalinized with 5% NaOH and extracted again with EtOAc, dried over Na2S0^, filtered and the solvent was evaporated off. The resulting yellow oil was washed with Hexane/EtOAc 7:3, to precipitate compound 23 as a powdery yellowish solid (5.5 g, 0.022 moles). Hexane/EtOAc 7:3 Rf = 0.64.<br><br>
Compound 23 (0.2 g, 0.8 mmoles) was dissolved in toluene, 24 (0.1 g, 0.8 mmoles) was added and temperature was raised to lOO'C for 5 hours. After a night at room temperature, heating was maintained for a further 5 hours. TLC (Hexane/EtOAc 8:2) showed no increases in the desired product. The mixture was left to cool, poured into 2N HCl (5 ml), alkalinized with 2N NaOH and extracted with EtOAc. The extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The solvent was evaporated off. A crude of about 200 mg was obtained,  150  mg  of  which  were  purified  on<br><br>
chromatographic column (Hexane: EtOAc 9:1). 18 mg of 25 were obtained (0.07 mmoles). Hexane: EtOAc 8:2 Rf = 0.4<br><br>
Compound 25 (30 mg, 0.12 mmoles) was dissolved in 4 ml of H2O added with 15 yl of cone. HCl. The mixture was boiled for 5 minutes, then cooled on ice to 15'C and added with a further 15 pi of cone. HCl. After stirring for 15 minutes at lO'C, 8.8 mg of 26 (0.127 mmoles) dissolved in 0.4 ml of H2O were added, stirring for 20 minutes. EtOH (3 ml) added with a spatula tip of CuSO4 was heated to 60'C in another flask. This solution was added with the mixture containing the diazonium salt in small amounts (slight gas evolution), keeping for 30 minutes at 50'C. EtOH was evaporated off, the residue was extracted with EtOAc and dried over Na2S04. The solvent was evaporated off.
