				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a multimedia call handling , more<br>
particularly but not exclusively to multimedia call handling in the network and in a<br>
telecommunications call centre, and in particular although not exclusively to such a<br>
call centre which is capable of handling in an integrated way not only standard<br>
telephony services but also communications carrying data and/or video<br>
information.<br>
In a typical prior art call centre, incoming calls are first directed to an<br>
automatic call distributor (ACD). This strips off the calling line ID from the<br>
incoming call and, with the aid of an intelligent interface, arranges for the call to be<br>
routed across a LAN or WAN, to the most appropriate person within the call centre<br>
domain. The ACD may be capable of dealing not only with standard (voice)<br>
telephony, but also ISDN services. Typically, in incoming voice message will be<br>
automatically switched to an appropriate standard telephone, or to a voice mail<br>
unit, or to an interactive voice response (IVR) unit. Similarly, incoming ISDN calls<br>
may be directed to an appropriate ISDN 'phone, or to a VC-8000 terminal, allowing<br>
video conferencing.<br>
Such a prior art system is technically complex, since the ACD has to<br>
interface with a large number of different devices, each making use of different<br>
protocols. In some prior art call centres, the ACD may have to handle audio,<br>
video, data and telephony services. This complexity causes difficulties, not only<br>
in setting up such a system initially, but also in the expansion of such systems, for<br>
example when the organisation in question requires more terminals or additional<br>
services. The maintenance of such a system requires the use of relatively skilled<br>
personnel.<br>
An alternative more rationalised approach is described in our co-pending<br>
PCT patent application no GB97/02782, (Publication No WO98/17048). This<br>
discloses a call centre using a distributed approach to provide, for the first time,<br>
the capability of achieving integrated video, audio data and telephony functionality<br>
within the call centre environment, together with the possibility of connectivity to<br>
the Internet, ISDN, PSTN and other wide-area networks.<br>
While such an approach works well in practice, it does require a certain<br>
defined level of functionality for the individual call centre terminals.      Such an<br><br>
approach may not, therefore, be desirable where an organisation intending to set<br>
up a call centre has already made a significant investment in incompatible<br>
terminals.<br>
While call centes as such usually include functionality and call control<br>
close to the terminal environment, in certain circumstances the level of intelligence<br>
required at the call controller may require substrantial investment in high lecvel<br>
processing capability. Thus it may also be desirable for some functionality of call<br>
centres to be provided in a more centralised manner while not increasing the<br>
multimedia traffic load on the main network.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
multimedia telecommunications call centre comprising a computer network<br>
arranged to carry addressed multimedia calls, a first terminal, a second terminal<br>
and a multipoint controller, the multipoint controller being arranged to control the<br>
setting up of a logical call control channel between the first and second terminals,<br>
thereby permitting a multimedia call to be made from the first to the second<br>
terminal, characterised in that a call physical datastream is then carried from the<br>
first to the second terminal directly across the network without mediation by the<br>
multipoint controller.<br>
While the terms multipoint controller and multipoint control unit are defined in<br>
certain telecommunication Standards as having a specific meaning, the terms as<br>
used herein should not be considered to be limited by that definition but rather in<br>
the context of this specification as including a virtual switch operating to set up<br>
multimedia channels on a physical network.<br>
The fact that the physical data/media stream passes across the network<br>
without mediation, interception or interruption by the multipoint controller or virtual<br>
switch, avoids what could otherwise represent a switching bottleneck. In<br>
addition, such an approach provides improved scalability.<br>
In the present specification and claims, the term "multimedia" refers to a<br>
device which is capable of dealing with one or more (and preferably two or more)<br>
of the following types of call: standard audio (voice) calls, video and data. The<br>
data functionality may, but need not, comply with the Data Conferencing Standard<br>
T.I 20 of the International Telecommunication Union.<br>
Preferably, the multipoint controller acts to control all routing from an<br>
initiating terminal to one of a plurality of possible recipient terminals.     Since it is<br><br>
the multipoint controller that controls the routing, rather than the terminals<br>
themselves, the terminals do not require complex functionality. In particular, there<br>
is no requirement for the terminals to support any call transfer functionality.<br>
Since the multipoint controller handles only the call control aspects (for example by<br>
defining which terminal addresses are to be connected together), scalability will<br>
not generally be a problem; the multipoint controller does not handle the physical<br>
connections, and therefore does not need to deal with transfer or switching of the<br>
physical data/media streams themselves.<br>
Preferably, call routing is effected by defining a logical call control channel<br>
from the first terminal to the multipoint controller, and then from the multipoint<br>
controller to the second terminal. All calls may be terminated by the multipoint<br>
controller, and not by the individual terminals.<br>
Preferably, the call centre and all the terminals connected to it are H.323<br>
compliant; in other words, they comply with the International Telecommunication<br>
Union (ITU) H.323 standard protocol. Routing control between the terminals is<br>
mediated by the multipoint controller according to the ITU H.245 standard<br>
protocol.<br>
If three-way calls or conference calls are required, a multipoint processor<br>
may be provided. This provides for the centralised processing of audio, video<br>
and/or datastreams within the multipoint conference, either by mixing or by<br>
switching.<br>
The present invention, in one preferred forms, provides the possibility, for<br>
the first time, of achieving the goal of scalability in an H.323 call centre<br>
environment.<br>
The invention further extends to a method of transmitting multimedia calls<br>
within a call centre environment as specified by the apparatus set out above and/or<br>
as described in the specific description and the claims.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
multimedia call handling environment including a network layer having a multiplicity<br>
of nodes and at least a plurality of terminals each connected to a respective one of<br>
said nodes, an access manager responsive to requests from the terminals to effect<br>
activation of instances of call control to handle each such request, said instances<br>
of call control setting up of a logical call control channel between first and second<br>
ones of said terminals, thereby permitting a multimedia call to be made from the<br><br>
first to the second terminal, characterised in that a call physical datastream is then<br>
carried from the first to the second terminal directly across the network without<br>
mediation by the multipoint controller.<br>
Preferably call control instances may communicate with a service control point, the<br>
service control point comprising processing means and a data store such that<br>
substantially greater call control functionality may be performed centrally for<br>
multiple call control instances.<br>
The invention may be carried into practice in a number of ways and a<br>
preferred multimedia call centre embodying the invention will now be described<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a multimedia call centre according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates schematically the central role of the multipoint control<br>
unit;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the signal flows involved in setting up a multimedia call<br>
between two terminals;<br>
Figure 4 shows the use of a multipoint processor for three-way calls;<br>
Figure 5 illustrates one possible approach using a terminal's "auto-answer"<br>
facility;<br>
Figure 6 shows in more detail one specific implementation:       and<br>
Figure 7 shows a network implementation of call centre functionality with<br>
centralised intelligence.<br>
A multimedia call centre in accordance with the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention is shown schematically in Figure 1. The telephony and<br>
computer equipment of an individual organisation, illustrated generally by the<br>
reference numeral 10, is coupled with an external network 12, for example the<br>
public telephone network or the Internet, via a gateway 14. The equipment<br>
owned by the organisation is delimited in the Figure from the external network 1 2<br>
by the wavy line 16. It is to be understood that the equipment to the right of that<br>
line will normally be privately owned, although it need not necessarily all reside in<br>
one building or indeed even at one site. For large organisations, the privately<br>
owned equipment may be spread across several sites, and perhaps in several<br>
different  countries,   with  the  elements  being   linked   by   an   appropriate   private<br><br>
telephony and/or computer network.      In this description, anything to the right of<br>
the wavy line 16 will be referred to as being in the "call centre domain".<br>
The typical call centre shown in Figure 1 comprises a physical LAN 30<br>
(shown in double lines) having a plurality of nodes 32. Some of the nodes define<br>
terminals 22,23, while others define respectively a call controller 24, a gateway<br>
14, a multipoint controller (MC) or virtual switch 20 and a gatekeeper 21.<br>
An incoming call from a terminal 18 on the external network 12 arrives at<br>
the gateway 14, which then makes a request of the gatekeeper 21 to enquire<br>
whether the call may be placed onto the LAN 30. If the gatekeeper grants<br>
permission, the virtual switch 20 opens a logical call control channel 40 with an<br>
appropriate recipient terminal 22. Once the logical call control channel has been<br>
opened and properly set up, the physical datastream representative of the call is<br>
then routed directly across the LAN 30 to the terminal 22 without any further<br>
mediation, interruption or interception by the virtual switch.<br>
The virtual switch 20 is itself controlled by a call controller 24 which may<br>
reside on a separate node of the LAN 30. The logical control channel between the<br>
call controller 24 and the switch 20 is shown schematically by the single line 42.<br>
The call controller 24 operates according to the requirements of the specific<br>
business application 26; this will generally be embodied within a computer<br>
program running on the computer which hosts the call controller 24.<br>
The purpose of the gatekeeper 21 is to act as a "policeman" or bandwidth<br>
manager, to protect the LAN 30 against a large number of calls (particularly video<br>
calls) being placed at once. The gatekeeper may also provide the lookup table<br>
between the addressing scheme used by the LAN 30 and that used by the external<br>
network 12.<br>
Communications between the gatekeeper 21 and the call controller 24<br>
take place across the LAN 30, preferably in accordance with the CSTA standard<br>
protocol of the European Computer Manufacturers Association. Communications<br>
between the gateway 14 and the gatekeeper 21 also take place across the LAN<br>
30, this time preferably in accordance with the International Telecommunication<br>
Union H.323 standard protocol as defined by the ITU recommendation of 28 May<br>
1996, entitled "Visual telephone systems and equipment for local area networks<br>
which provide a non-guaranteed quality of service". The virtual switch 20 may<br>
handle routing control with the terminals 22,23 by means of the standard H.245<br><br>
protocol as defined by the International Teleconnmunication Union,<br>
Recommendation Version 2 dated 4 June 1996, entitled "Control Protocol for<br>
Multimedia Communication". Communications between terminals 22,23 across<br>
the LAN 30 may use any appropriate protocol, for example TCP/IP. The LAN 30<br>
itself may be of any convenient type, and topology, such as for example an<br>
Ethernet or a Token Ring network.<br>
Since in this embodiment the gateway 14 and the gatekeeper 21<br>
effectively act together as a virtual PBX (Private Branch Exchange), the gateway<br>
and the gatekeeper need to take on additional functionality, such as call queuing,<br>
under control of the business application 26.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates schematically the central role of the multipoint<br>
controller/virtual switch 20 in effecting logical connections between a plurality of<br>
external terminals 50 and a plurality of internal terminals 52, within the call centre<br>
domain, all under control of the call controller 24. It should be understood that<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the virtual or logical domain (e.g. H.245), and not the actual<br>
physical connections along which the physical datastreams will actually flow.<br>
Within this logical domain, the multipoint controller 20 is effectively acting as a<br>
cross-point switch between a plurality of logical call control channels 54 connected<br>
to the outside world and a plurality of logical call control channels 56 connected to<br>
the call centre terminals.<br>
Although the logical/addressing channels are controlled by the multipoint<br>
controller, the controller does not handle the physical media or datastreams. The<br>
distinction is illustrated in Figure 3 which shows the signalling protocol required to<br>
set up a call from one terminal 22 on the network to another terminal 23. As<br>
may be seen from a comparison with Figure 1, the virtual switch 20 can<br>
communicate with the first terminal 22 via the logical call control channel 40, and<br>
with the second terminal 23 via a logical call control channel 41. It will be<br>
understood, of course, that at the physical level the signalling is actually all<br>
transferred via the LAN 30. The terminals 22,23 are physically connected by a<br>
link 30' of the LAN 30. For ease of description, the terminal 22 will be referred<br>
to as A, the terminal 23 as B and the virtual switch 20 as C.<br>
First, A sends a Setup request to C, which returns a Connect signal back<br>
to A to confirm receipt. C then sends a Setup request to the Call Controller 24,<br>
which returns a Setup signal back to C, specifying the address of the terminal B to<br><br>
which the call is to be transferred.       C then sends a Setup request to B, which<br>
returns its own Connect signal back to C.<br>
Next, C communicates both with A and B. This starts with an H.245<br>
capabilities ("Caps") exchange, followed by an H.245 Mode Request from C to<br>
each of A and B. An Open Logical Channel signal is then sent from A to C, and<br>
from C to B, specifying that it is terminal A that wishes to talk to terminal B.<br>
Corresponding Open Logical Channel Acknowledgement Signals are returned from<br>
B to C, and then from C to A..<br>
In accordance with the Open Logical Channel Requests, the media (data)<br>
stream is now transferred directly across the link 30' from A to B. Once the call<br>
has been completed, the Multipoint Controller closes the Logical Channels between<br>
AB.<br>
It will be understood that in the scenario of Figure 3, the Multipoint<br>
Controller/Virtual Switch is identifying itself as such to both A and B, to force A<br>
and B to obey Mode Requests. This method requires, of course, that the<br>
individual terminals can communicate with the switch, but this is a relatively easy<br>
requirement for the terminals to satisfy, even if they do not have sufficient<br>
functionality to talk directly to each other or to effect call transfers.<br>
Figure 4 shows a more complex arrangement including the facility to deal<br>
with conference calls having three or more participants. In this variant, the<br>
multipoint controller/virtual switch 20 forms part of a multipoint control unit (MCU)<br>
60, which itself defines a node 61 on the LAN 30. In addition to the multipoint<br>
controller, the MCU also includes one or more multipoint processors 55 which<br>
provide for the centralised processing of audio, video and/or datastreams in a<br>
multipoint conference. In the example shown, the multipoint processor connects<br>
three terminals 23,25,27 all of which reside on the LAN 30. It would be equally<br>
possible, however, for one or more of the participating terminals to reside on the<br>
external network 12.<br>
The multipoint processor 55 provides for the mixing, switching or other<br>
processing of the physical media streams making up the conference call under the<br>
control of the multipoint controller 20. Since the multipoint processor handles the<br>
actual media streams, unlike the multipoint controller, it may to some extent<br>
represent a limitation on the scalability of the system.      If necessary, however.<br><br>
several multipoint processors may be provided within the MCU 60 to handle the<br>
expected conference call bandwidth.<br>
Little in the way of functionality is required of the individual terminals,<br>
merely that they are capable of communicating with the multipoint controller.<br>
However, that does not exclude the possibility of making use of terminals having<br>
additional functionality to allow "power dialling". The term "power dialling means<br>
that the number to be dialled is selected using the application (eg in software),<br>
with the application then dialling the selected number. Even if this additional<br>
functionality cannot be provided by the terminals, "power dialling" may<br>
nevertheless be achievable provided that auto-answer is available, using the<br>
arrangement shown in Figure 5.<br>
Here, the terminal 70 that wishes to invoke an end-to-end connection first<br>
sends a request to the call controller 24, which communicates with the business<br>
application 26. The call controller then communicates with the virtual switch 20,<br>
and it is the switch which is responsible for sending setup signals both to the<br>
original terminal 70 and to the distant end. The setup signal from the multipoint<br>
controller to the terminal is received using the terminal's auto-answer facility. A<br>
distinction should be made between Figures 3 and 5 in as much as in Figure 3, the<br>
setup message is outgoing from terminal A and incoming to terminal B. In Figure<br>
5, the setup messages are outgoing from the virtual switch and incoming to both<br>
terminals.<br>
Using such an approach, the terminal at the distant end receives a setup<br>
signal which has apparently been issued from the terminal 70, but has in fact been<br>
issued by the virtual switch.<br>
An alternative practical realisation of the embodiment of Figure 1 is shown<br>
in Figure 6. In this Figure, identical reference numerals are used, where<br>
appropriate, and for simplicity only the logical and not the physical connections are<br>
shown. The call centre of Figure 6 is rather more complex, in that it incorporates<br>
a variety of different gateways 1 5, allowing access to the external network 1 2 via<br>
a variety of different protocols, for example the International Telecommunication<br>
Union protocols H.320 and H.324. In addition, a dedicated node 81 on the LAN<br>
hosts a firewall 82 allowing an external terminal 81 access via the Internet or an<br>
external Intranet 80. The firewall 82 is controlled (logical connection not shown)<br>
by the call controller 24.<br><br>
With such an arrangement, entirely transparent call switching may be<br>
provided by the MCU 60 between any of the terminals 50, or the terminal 81, and<br>
any of the call centre terminals 52.<br>
In a network or service platform based arrangement of the call handling system<br>
hereinbefore described, referring now to figure 7, each of the terminals 52 has<br>
access to one or more nodes in the network transport layer 30" corresponding to<br>
the LAN 30 of figure 1. Gateways 15 connected to respective nodes of the<br>
network transport layer 30"allow access from the PSTN 12 to the call handling<br>
system and other nodes may allow access from other networks, for example from<br>
the Internet 80.<br>
Now as shown in the drawing, the gatekeeper functionality is handled by a virtual<br>
switch controller 90 which has a RAS (registration, admissions and status)<br>
manager 91 which communicates via the network nodes with each endpoint<br>
attached terminal 52 to effect call control functions. Endpoints are equivalent of<br>
nodes in the previously described call centre. The RAS manager co-operates with a<br>
call control - virtual switch function which has effective access to high level<br>
intelligence for example in the manner provided by service Control Points to<br>
Service Switching Points in an intelligent communications network.<br>
Thus on receipt of a request for connection from one of the H323 endpoints<br>
(equivalent of gateways), the gatekeeper function within the virtual switch control<br>
unit 90 may apply to a call control application 95 in a service control point 96, the<br>
call control application using call details appended to a communications message<br>
to determine the required connection at the network layer. Instructions are<br>
encoded in message form from the high level intelligence at the SCP based on<br>
business applications (not shown sepeartely) and using data from a central<br>
database 94. These instructions are used by the virtual switch controller to<br>
instruct the gateway to set up the required channel on the network such that<br>
terminal to terminal communication occurs without media streams passing through<br>
the virtual switch control.<br>
Should it be necessary for the incoming multimedia call to be moved to another<br>
terminal then the transferring terminal will request a transfer from the virtual<br>
switch control by messaging through the RAS manager. Again, switching detail<br>
may be requested from the higher level intelligence and this causes the virtual<br>
switch control to set up the appropriate channel between the transferring terminal<br><br>
and the transferred to terminal to allow data interchange across the network layer<br>
without involving the virtual switch control in the transfer. This occurs in th esame<br>
manner as that described with reference to figure 3 except that the virtual switch<br>
&amp; call control instance started by the RAS Manager 91 uses the SCP 96 to<br>
5    determine the channel to be opened.<br><br><br>
