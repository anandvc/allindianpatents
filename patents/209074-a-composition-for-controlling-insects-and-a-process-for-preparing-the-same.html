This invention relates to a composition for controlling insects and a process for preparing the same. More particularly, this invention relates a composition for controlling tea mosquito bugs and its preparation.<br>
The present day trend is to discourage the use of chemical pesticides for control and irradiation of pests to avoid long-term adverse effect on the environment, resistance to a particular chemical due to prolonged use, cumulative and non-cumulative side effects, that surface due to the use of pesticide contaminated products are some of the main reasons against the continuous use of chemical pesticides. Biological, eco and environmentally friendly measures for controlling pests assume significance under this circumstance.<br>
Pheromones are chemical substances produced by animals and insects. They function as stimuli to other individual of the same species for one or more behavioral responses. Sex pheromones of some insects have been used for trapping insects of the opposite sex for bio assay.<br>
An object of this invention is to control tea mosquito bugs by luring adult males with the sex pheromones of female tea mosquito bugs. Yet another object is to develop a chemical composition similar to the volatiles secreted by female tea mosquito bugs which shows optimum attraction to the males of the same species.<br>
Studies were conducted to identify the sex-attracted pheromones produced by female tea bugs mosquito, scientifically known as Helopeltis theilvora,      Volatiles produced by newly emerged unmated females were<br><br>
extracted and analysed by gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrum. From important compounds, among them, two more predominant compounds were identified. Studies were carried out to assess the response of male mosquito to these compounds. Males were found to be highly sensitive in their behavioral response to these compounds. Sensitivity and orientation towards the source of pheromone were also found to be optimum. It was also observed that a combination of two specific compounds exhibited maximum potential for attracting the males of the species.<br>
Studies were then conducted with the identified chemical compounds alone and in combination with each other. Volatile extracts containing species specific pheromones secreted by female tea bugs are found to contain trans-2-hexenyl acetate, cis-3-hexen-l-ol (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and (E)-2-hexen-l-ol.<br>
Commercially available cis-3-hexen-ol was converted into (E)-2-hexen-l-ol by acetylating with acetic acid and pyridine in the presence of dichloromethane trans-2-hexenyl acetate was deacetylated using sodium carbonate in the presence of methanol and converted into (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate.<br>
These compounds were used as attractants for male tea mosquito bugs individually and in blends. Our study showed that individual compounds did not exhibit any species specific attraction towards female mosquito bugs. However blends of (E)-2-hexen-l-ol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in proportions varying from 1 : 3 to 1: 7 showed high attraction rate.<br>
Data of field attraction studies of two different combinations is given below :<br><br><br>
Degree of attraction corresponding to + + is medium; corresponding to + + + is high and corresponding to + + + + is very high.<br>
These compositions of synthetic chemicals can replace natural pheromones in effectively trapping of tea mosquito bugs, which are responsible for considerable damage in tea estates. Trapping and subsequent elimination of male mosquito bugs will adequately control and eventually even eradicate the mosquito population. Any conventional means of trapping and destruction may be used for this purpose. Strips and baits provided with the blend of the two compounds or tunnels having the bait dispersed therein may be used for this purpose.<br>
Our studies clearly showed that a composition containing (E)-2-hexen-l-ol and (Z)-3"hexenyl acetate preferably in the ratio of 1:3 to  1: 7 show<br><br>
synergistic properties and that the two compounds when individually used failed to attract male tea bug mosquitoes.<br>
Accordingly this invention relates to a composition for controlling insects such as Helopeltis theivora or tea mosquito bug which comprises a blend of (E)-2-hexen-l-ol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for preparing a composition for controlling Helopeltis theivora or tea mosquito bug, which comprises the step of blending (E)-2-hexen-l-ol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate.<br>
Attraction studies and experiments were carried out to show the effectivity and specificity of the compositions. Rubber Septa baited with the composition and blank baits were set up for such studies, which were carried out at many locations. The results obtained clearly showed that the composition of this invention exhibited medium to very high attraction towards male tea bug mosquitoes.<br>
Control and elimination male mosquito bugs eventually eradicates tea mosquito bugs, which cause considerable damage in tea estates.<br>
The above disclosure and the appended claims do not exclude obvious alteration and modification known to persons skilled in the art.<br><br><br><br>
