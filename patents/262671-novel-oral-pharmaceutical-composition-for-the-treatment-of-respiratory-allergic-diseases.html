The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION - The present invention provides novel oral pharmaceutical compositions for respiratory allergic diseases comprising active agent and one or more pharmaceutical acceptable excipients. The present invention describes process for preparation and method of using compositions. Preferably the compositions increase the efficacy of treatment associated with particularly respiratory and allergic diseases, leading to grater patient compliance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION - Ambroxol is a secretolytic agent used in the treatment of respiratory diseases associated with viscid or excessive mucus. The substance is a mucoactive drug with several properties including secretolytic and secretomotoric actions that restore the physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract, which play an important role in the body's natural defence mechanisms. Ambroxol is indicated as "secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport. It promotes mucus clearance, facilitates expectoration and eases productive cough, allowing patients to breathe freely and deeply". There are many different formulations developed since the first marketing authorisation in 1978. Ambroxol is very effective in the form of tablets, capsule and powder thereof.<br>
Although acute upper respiratory diseases (AURDs) such as common cold and influenza are common, few interventions have been proven to be effective in their prophylactic and treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ambroxol for preventing AURD including treatment of pneumonia, treatment of bronchiolitis, treatment of children with asthma, the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusions of Ambroxol treatment of childhood respiratory disease is effective and less adverse reaction, high security, is worthy of clinical use.<br>
Respiratory diseases to cough, sputum, and dyspnea based disease. Infant tracheobronchial stenosis than in adults and the lack of elastic tissue, ciliary movement function is poor, weak cough reflex, poor alveolar macrophage function, non-specific respiratory tract and specific immune functions are poor. These characteristics make children prone to respiratory infections, and infected mucus airway obstruction and difficult to spit up. So while the cause of the treatment, timely application of expectorant drugs and asthma drugs, in order to control symptoms and prevent disease progression. Ambroxol now widely used in abnormal and expectoration of sputum associated with dysfunction of various acute and chronic respiratory diseases, expectorant treatment of respiratory diseases in children in recent years has also been widely used.<br>
A large dose of Ambroxol in alveolar type cells to promote surfactant synthesis and secretion material. In addition, surface active substances covered by respiratory epithelium, the bacteria can not directly touch the surface of the respiratory tract, can reduce the risk of infection, thus preventing respiratory tract infection, and a synergistic effect with antibiotics is the treatment of respiratory tract infection in infants and young children an effective adjuvant.<br><br>
In summary, Ambroxol, Ketotifen and Levocetirizine are able to treatment of respiratory diseases as a safe and effective drug by oral adjuvant especially for the respiratory infection in children with the less adverse reaction.<br>
According to United States Patent 6391886 wherein Oral compositions containing therapeutical agents wherein the undesirable consumer aesthetics associated with these agents are mitigated using coolants and sweeteners<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION- It is an objective of the present invention to provide novel oral pharmaceutical composition comprising one active agent and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Preferably the composition is administered to a subject particularly human by oral form wherein the composition forms a drug that releases the pharmaceutically active agent over a desired period of time, thereby increasing the efficacy of treatment associated with particularly respiratory and allergic diseases thereof leading to greater patient compliance.<br>
The novel compositions of the present invention preferably provide the active agent to localize in certain tissues, thereby increasing the efficacy of treatment, associated with such tissues. The compositions of the present invention may be used for especially respiratory and allergic diseases in a subject in need thereof.<br>
The present invention provides a novel therapeutic oral pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of respiratory allergic diseases. This composition comprises Ambroxol, levocetirizine, Ketotifen thereof.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION -The present invention provides a novel therapeutic oral pharmaceutical administration for respiratory and allergic diseases and thereof. This comprises Ambroxol, levocetirizine, Ketotifen thereof.<br>
This is a need for the development of a pharmaceutical formulation that contains a high concentration of active ingredient where the formulation is storage able<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention Ambroxol is a secretolytic agent used in the treatment of respiratory diseases associated with viscid or excessive mucus. It is a mucoactive drug with several properties including secretolytic and secretomotoric actions that restore the physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract, which play an important roie in the body's natural defence mechanisms.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present, Ketotifen is a second-generation H1 receptor antagonist /mast cell and basophile stabilizer. The main function of ketotifen in this invention is that it's working as an active bronchodilator.<br>
"An active bronchodilator is a substance that dilates the bronchi and bronchioles, decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs. They are used for the treatment of breathing difficulties specially in the case of obstructive lung diseases such as Asthma, Emphysema, Bronchitis ,Chrom'c obstructive pulmonary disease and thereof." Ketotifen is used to up-regulate beta-2 adrenergic receptors down-regulated by beta-2 adrenergic agonists. It upregulates adrenergic receptors due to its phosphodiesterase inhibition. It provides symptom relief and a minimal decrease in beta-agonist use but no significant change in pulmonary function<br>
In the case of asthma, Ketotifen is an antihistamine preparation with prolonged preventive effect on the frequency and intensity of the asthma attacks. Its mechanism of action ultimately is associated with reduction of histamine, serotonine and other mast cell mediators release, and simultaneous selective blocking of the H1-receptors. As a result of the latter effects the level of the cell cAMP in enhanced and eosinophilic infiltration is inhibited. Although the preparation influences favorably expectoration, Ketotifen is used to minimize the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. It is used on a long-term basis to prevent symptoms of mild to moderate allergic asthma and may allow for reduction of doses of other asthma medication. Ketotifen may also be used to prevent hay fever and allergic skin reactions and thereof. Ketotifen decreases the actions of histamine, a substance that is released by the body to cause an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions may include asthma, hay fever, nasal congestion, skin rash and swelling and thereof.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention levocetirizine is safe and effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. The compound shows a rapid onset of action, high bioavailability and affinity for the H1 receptor. It demonstrates many anti-inflammatory effects that enhance the clinical therapeutic benefit not only in short-term but also in long-term treatments. Its safe effective activity for treatment of allergic disease in both adults and children.<br><br>
Furthmore, the compatible composition according to the invention can be used to produce respiratory and allergic protective preparation for the prophylactic or treatment of related respiratory and allergic diseases caused by active ingredients like Ambroxol. levocetirizine, Ketotifen.<br>
An active ingredient represents a promising respiratory protection in the case of hay fever, asthma, They are taken orally as tablets, capsules, granules or powder but according to the invention, the compatible solutes can be used to produce a medicine in the oral form  to treat disease that are caused by Ambroxol,levocetirizine, Ketotifen and thereof.
