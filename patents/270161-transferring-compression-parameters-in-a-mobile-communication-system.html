				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TRANSFERRING COMPRESSION PARAMETERS IN A MOBILE COMMU­NICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the invention:<br>
The invention relates to mobile communication systems. Particularly, the invention relates to the transfer of packet header and data compression parame­ters in a mobile communication system.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
A disadvantage associated with wireless- data transmission is that the data transfer rate is limited compared to wire-line data transmission. Especially, the data transfer rate is limited in cellular mobile' communication systems where a given frequency band must be shared by a number of simultaneous users. When transferring packet data in a cellular mobile communi­cation system, the data transfer rate made available for application layer data transmission is further re­duced due to frame and packet headers. For example, when the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is car­ried over the Internet Protocol (IP) version 4, the total header size is 40 bytes of which TCP layer head­ers take 20 bytes and IP layer headers 20 bytes. In IPv6 the IP layer header size is 40 bytes. The problem is made worse in the cases where IP-in-IP tunneling is used, for example, in association with the Mobile IP.<br>
In order to alleviate the aforementioned problems associated with wireless and in general slow links payload data and header compression schemes have been introduced. Examples of such header compression schemes are Van Jacobson header compression defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request For Comments (RFC 1144) and Degermark header compression defined in the IETF RFC 2507. An example of a payload<br>
data compression scheme is V.42bis by International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T) .<br>
Generally, header compressions rely on the fact that a large part of the headers contain informa­tion, which remains constant during the course of a typical TCP/IP connection. Similarly, when Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP) is carried over IP, a signifi­cant part of the packet headers remain constant in any given flow, which carries, for example, streaming mul­timedia. An IP header comprises a number of fields. As a sequence of IP packets is transmitted, there is no need to repeatedly transmit the fields that are not changed between subsequent packets. Those fields that usually change with small or predictable values, for example, TCP sequence numbers in TCP headers, may be encoded incrementally so that the number of bits needed for transmitting the value of those fields de­creases significantly. Only those fields that change often and randomly, for example, checksums or authen­tication data, need to be transmitted in entirety in each header. In header compression is sent occasion­ally a packet with a full header, which establishes a context. Thereupon, in subsequent packets compressed headers refer to the established context and may con­tain incremental changes to the context. In order for the header compression to work, it is necessary that a sender and a receive maintain the same context. A num­ber of different contexts may be maintained in the sender and the receiver side to support different packet streams carried over same link, that is, for example, TCP/IP connections or UDP packet flows.<br>
Payload data compression relies, on the other hand, upon the redundancy of data to be carried in packet payload. For example, there may be repeating strings in packets. The compression is achieved by maintaining by at the sender and at the receiver side code dictionaries than comprise information on strings<br>
comprised ±n the uncompressed data. The code diction­aries enable the sender to refer to codes instead of entire strings while the transmission occurs in the compressed mode. The V.42bis compression relies on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. More information on the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm can be found, for example, in US patents 4,955,066, 4,701,745 and 5,016,009.<br>
In association with mobile communication sys­tems the use of header compression and payload data compression has been standardized, for example, in the General Packet Radio System (GPRS) . Header compression and payload data compression is used between a mobile station and a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) in or­der to decrease the amount of data to be transmitted over the air interface between the mobile station and a base transceiver station.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 1, which is a block diagram illustrating the architecture and the protocol stacks in a GPRS system in association with the GSM Edge Radio Access Network (GERAN) . The GPRS system is specified, for example, in the 3G Partner­ship Project (3GPP) specification 23.060. The protocol stacks are illustrated from the user plane point of view. In Figure 1 there is a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 106. GGSN 106 is connected to an external net­work (not shown) via a Gi-interface. The external net­work may be an arbitrary IP network, for example, the Internet or an intranet. In Figure 1 there is also a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 104. GGSN 106 commu­nicates with SGSN 104, which routes packets to and from Mobile Station (MS) 100 via a Base Station Sub­system (BSS). SGSN 104 takes care of the mobility re­lated tasks such as the maintaining of mobile station 100 location information, network registrations, rout­ing area and location updating, Packet Data Context (PDF) activation and deactivation, handovers and the paging of mobile station 100. Part of the above men-<br>
tioned tasks are naturally done in other network ele­ments with which SGSN 104 is communicating. The GGSN is responsible for routing and tunneling packets to and from a number of SGSN 104 and other SGSNs. The routing is based on SGSN address information main­tained in a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context held by GGSN 106. There is at least one PDP context for each network address activated for MS 100, for example, an IP address or an X.25 address or a PPP link.<br>
In Figure 1, the uppermost protocol layer in MS 100 is the application layer (APPL) . The applica­tion layer may be any protocol, for example, a proto­col from the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) stan­dard or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP.) or the Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP), Over the TCP/IP may be carried, for example, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The application layer communication is ex­changed with a peer host, which may be located behind the Ga-interface, for example, in the Internet. Below the application layer there is the IP layer or alter­natively X.25 layer, which in GPRS is supported by both MS 100 and GGSN 106. The IP address for packets addressed to MS 100 points to GGSN 106. An IP packet 114 is conveyed to MS 100 using GPRS user plane proto­cols below the IP layer. Between GGSN 106 and SGSN 104 IP packet 114 is conveyed using the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP). A GTP packet carried further over UDP/IP.<br>
In SGSN 104 IP packet 114 data is routed based on MS 100 location information 'and passed to Sub-Network Dependent Convergence Protocol (SNDCP) layer. SNDCP is specified in the 3GPP specification 44.065. SNDCP layer maps network-level characteristics onto the characteristics of the underlying network. For example, SNDCP takes care of the transmission and reception of Network layer Protocol Data Units (N-PDU.) carrying IP packets. For example, IP packet 114 is<br>
carried in N-PDU 112. SNDCP multiplexes several packet data protocol packets for the same MS. It segments IP packet 114 to LLC frames, for example, LLC frame 110. It also reassembles packets from LLC frames. Header compression and data compression is also performed at SNDCP layer. The header compression scheme mentioned in the  3GPP  specification  23.060  includes  TCP/IP header compression. V.42bis is mentioned as a method for data compression. At the SNDCP layer there are a number of compression entities  (not shown)  each of which have associated with them an algorithm and the entity specific parameters. Each SNDCP entity, which supports protocol control information compression, is able to negotiate at least one protocol control infor­mation compression entity using XID parameter negotia­tion as specified in the 3GPP specification 44.064. The initiating SNDCP entity defines a set of requested compression entities, together with the algorithm and parameters for each compression entity. The set of compression entities and their algorithms and parame­ters are transmitted to the peer SNDCP entity. The peer SNDCP entity responds with the set of negotiated compression entities and their algorithms and parame­ters . The peer SNDCP entity selects the proposed pa­rameter values or other appropriate values for the ne­gotiated compression entities. The information on the set of compression entities used and their algorithms and parameters is referred to hereinafter as the SNDCP compression parameters. Other compression information held at the SNDCP layer comprise,  for example,  at least one header compression context and at least one code dictionary. SNDCP performs parameter negotiation between MS 100 and SGSN 104. SNDCP also buffers N-PDUs in the case of acknowledged mode services.<br>
The Logical Link Control (LLC) layer provides a highly reliable link between MS 100 and SGSN 104. The LLC is specified in 3GPP specifications 44.064 and<br>
04.64. The LLC is independent of the underlying radio protocols and hides the BSS and radio interface re­lated tasks from the LLC layer users: LLC supports variable-length information frames. LLC supports both acknowledged and unacknowledged data transfers, that is, acknowledged and unacknowledged modes of opera­tion. LLC provides services typical to a link layer comprising parameter negotiation, flow control in the Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM), sequence control to maintain the ordering of LLC-frames, expedited deliv­ery for high-priority data, error detection, error re­covery and indication. LLC performs data confidential­ity by means of the ciphering of LLC-frame contents. LLC also supports user identity confidentiality by means of the use of Temporary Logical Link Identity (TLLI) instead of International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). A Service Access Point Identifier (SAPI) identifies a point, at which LLC services are provided by a Logical Link Entity (LLE) , in other words an LLC entity, to a layer-3 entity. Conse­quently, SAPI identifies an LLE that should process an LLC frame and also a layer-3 entity that is to receive information carried by the LLC frame. The layer-3 en­tity is, for example, an SNDCP entity.<br>
The relay layer relays LLC PDUs between the Um and Gb interfaces in' the BSS. The Base Station Sys­tem GPRS Protocol (BSSGP) layer specified in 3GPP specification 08.18 conveys routing and QoS-related information between the BSS and the SGSN. For example, it carries radio resource related requests from the SGSN to the BSS 102. It also carries LLG frames be­tween the BSS and the SGSN. In addition to LLC frames it also carries signaling PDUs associated with GRPS mobility management. The Network Service (NS) layer transports BSSGP PDUs between BSS and SGSN. NS may be based on Frame Relay (FR) . The 'RLC sub-layer within the RLC/MAC layer provides a radio technology depend-<br>
ent reliable link between MS 100 and BSS 102. The MAC sub-layer performs the retjuesting and reservation of radio resources and maps LLC frames onto the GSM physical channels. The task of the MAC layer is to en­sure efficient sharing of common radio resources by several mobile stations. The RLC/MAC layer is defined in the 3GPP specification GSM 04.60.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 2, which is a block diagram - illustrating packet transmission before and after a routing area update in a prior art GPRS network. In Figure 2 there is an MS 100, Base Trans­ceiver Stations (BTS) 224-228 and Base Controller Sta­tions (BSC) 210-214 in BSS 216. There is a GGSN 200, which is connected to IP network 201. From IP network<br>
is received a downlink packet stream 240. Ini­<br>
tially/ downlink packet flow 240 is tunneled from GGSN<br>
200 to SGSN 202 ae packet stream 241. Initially, SGSN<br>
routes packets from packet stream 241 to MS 100<br>
via BSC 212 and BTS 222 as packet stream 242. Packet<br>
stream 242 is carried from an SNDCP entity 252 in SGSN<br>
202 to SNDCP entity 230 in MS 100 using an LLC connec­<br>
tion serving both SNDCP entities. BSC 212 and BTS 222<br>
are referred to as source BSS 262. MS 100 communicates<br>
with BSC 212 via BTS 222. In routing area update re­<br>
lated signaling SGSN 202 communicates with MS 100 via<br>
BSC 212 arid a BTS 222 within BSS 262.<br>
When MS 100 detects that a new cell has bet­ter radio quality, it must start camping on the new cell, which is served by BTS 224. The new cell is in the area of a new SGSN 204. After the handover, packet stream 240 should be routed to MS 100 from GGSN 200 via SGSN 204, BSC 214 and BTS 224. BSC 214 and BTS 224 are also referred to as a target BSS 264. While the PDF contexts have not yet been updated in GGSN 200, SGSN 202 must forward any unacknowledged packets to SGSN 204. The packets are sent from SGSN 202 as packet stream 243. After GGSN 200 has received a PDF context<br>
update request and processed it, it may start sending packets from packet stream 240 directly to SGSN 204 as packet stream 244. SGSN 204 sends packets from packet streams 243 and 244 to MS 100 as packet stream 245. Packet stream 245 is carried from an SNDCP entity 254 in SGSN 204 to SNDCP entity 230 in MS 100 using an LLC connection serving both SNDCP entities. Before packets may be sent from SGSN 204 to MS 100 after the detec­tion of a routing area update, an XID reset procedure must be performed between SNDCP entities 254 and 230. Otherwise, the LLC parameters will not match in the MS 100 and SGSN 254 and all LLC frames will be rejected.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 3, which is a signaling diagram depicting routing area update sig­naling in a prior art GPRS network such as illustrated in Figure 2. At time tj. an MS 100 detects an event that Indicates that it must .start using a new cell (not shown) . The new cell is within a new routing area, which is controlled by a new SGSN 204. MS 100 sends a Routing Area Update Request message to SGSN 204 as illustrated with arrow 301. The message is sent via a target BSS 264, which controls the new cell. SGSN 204 sends an SGSN Context Request message illus­trated with arrow 302 to an old SGSN 202 to get the mobility management and PDP contexts for MS 100. The SGSN Context Request message comprises, for example, an old routing area identifier, a Temporary Logical Link Identity (TLLI) and the new SGSN address. SGSN 202 responds with message SGSN Context Response illus­trated with arrow 303. The SGSN Context Response mes-.sage provides the mobility management context and at least one PDP context associated with MS 100. After receiving the SGSN Content response message SGSN 204 may initiate an XID reset procedure. XID-reset proce­dure comprises that an. SNDCP entity 254 in SGSN 204 requests an LLC-entity in SGSN 204 to send an XID com­mand message to MS 100 as illustrated with arrow 304.<br>
In the case of XID reset, the XID Command message in­cludes a Reset parameter, which tells the peer LLC en­tity to reset the LLC parameters. MS 100 acknowledges the XID Command with the XID Response message as il­lustrated with arrow 305.<br>
As defined in 3GPP specification 44.064 sev­eral actions take place at the XID procedure if a Re­set parameter is detected in an XID Command message. All requests pending from layer 3 to the LLC entities in SGSN 204 and MS 100 are discarded without any fur­ther action. Any ongoing Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM) establishment, release and XID negotiation pro­cedures are aborted, except the XID negotiation per­taining to a Reset parameter. The LLC layer parameters are set to the default values. Any Logical Layer Enti­ties (LLE) in ABM state is changed to Asynchronous Disconnected Mode (ADM) state. Unconfirmed state vari­ables V(U) and V(UR) are set to 0. Further, all Over­flow Counters (OC) for unacknowledged information transfer are set to 0.<br>
After having received the SGSN 204 address, SGSN 202 may start forwarding packets to it as illus­trated with arrow 306. SGSN 204 must update PDF con­texts in the GGSNs that have PDF contexts active for MS 100. The updating of PDF contexts specifies, for example, the new SGSN address for the GGSNs. SGSN 204 sends the Update PDF Context Request message to GGSN 200 and receives Update PDF Context Response message as acknowledgement, as illustrated with arrows 307 and 308, respectively. The routing area update is acknowl­edged with Routing Area Update Accept message sent by SGSN 204 to MS 100, which responds by sending Routing Area Update Complete message to SGSN 204, as illus­trated with arrows 309 and 310.<br>
The ABM release that is performed in associa­tion with the processing of XID Reset parameter speci­fied in the XID Command message causes significant<br>
problems in prior art. After the XID reset the ABM mode must be re-established with Set Asynchronous Bal­anced Model (SABM) negotiation sent to MS 100. This is illustrated using arrow 310. The Unnumbered Acknow­ledgement (UA) response to the ABM mode re-establishment from MS 100 is illustrated with, arrow 311.<br>
However, without knowledge of the previously used SNDCP parameters there is no possibility to re­establish the ABM mode with the SNDCP parameters that were used by the old SGSN, namely SGSN 202, to commu­nicate with MS 100. There are three problems related to this. Firstly, if SGSN 204 does not propose any compression entities, in other words, header or data compression entities, in the SNDCP compression parame­ters negotiated after XID reset procedure, there is no guarantee that the MS 100 will stop using the previ­ously used SNDCP compression parameters. Secondly, if SGSN 204 proposes any compression entities there is no guarantee that MS 100 is capable of changing them. Thirdly, if SGSN 204 in fact proposes a header com­pression entity, there remains the question as to whether RFC 1144 or RFC 2507 header compression should be used by default. Some mobile stations do not work properly in the first case and some do not work prop­erly in the second and third cases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the mo­bile node comprises a mobile terminal, for example, a UMTS terminal, a GSM terminal, a GPRS terminal, a WLAN terminal or a terminal within an arbitrary cellular radio system. In other words, the mobile node may be a Mobile Station (MS) in a mobile communication system.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the mo­bile node comprises a mobile computer, for example, a laptop computer, palmtop computer or a personal digi­tal assistant (PDA) .

When receiving a routing area update message from the base station subsystem, the second packet switching node requests information on the mobile node from the first packet switching node.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, sending a routing area update message from the mobile node to the second packet switching node performs the inform­ing of. the second packet switching node of the entry of the mobile node to an area controlled by the second packet switching node. In other words, as the mobile node enters an area, for example, a routing area con­trolled by the second packet switching node, it sends a routing area update message to the second packet switching node. Thereupon, the second packet switching node is aware that the mobile node is within an area controlled by it.<br>

The signaling plane protocol entity comprises a GPRS Tun­neling Protocol (GTP) entity or an application entity communicating with a GTP protocol entity. The protocol entities may be implemented, for example, as a soft­ware module, program block or thread. The exchange of information between the protocol entities is config­ured to be performed, for example, using inter process communication mechanisms such as message passing or shared memory buffers.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the sec­ond packet switching node is a Base Station Subsystem (BSS) node, for example, a base station controller or a base station. In one embodiment of the invention, the first or the second packet switching node is a node, which performs the forwarding and switching of data packets at link layer. The invention is not re­stricted to packet switching nodes that switch packets at network layer level in the manner of e.g. IP routers. By packets are meant herein throughout this<br>
disclosure data packets pertaining to any protocol layer, for example, network layer packets, link layer frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the at least one compression parameter is received from the first packet switching node to the second packet switching node when the first packet switching node requests handover preparation from the second packet switching node. This means that the at least one com­pression parameter is sent from the first packet switching to the second packet switching node in the message that requests handover preparation.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the send­ing of logical link layer frames or any other messages between the mobile node and the packet switching nodes is performed via a radio access network so that the frames and messages are forwarded by one or many in­termediate network elements such as base station con­trollers, radio network controllers and base trans­ceiver stations. In one embodiment of the invention, the first and the second packet switching nodes are directly connected to base transceiver stations and manage the radio network control procedures directly.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the com­puter program is stored on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may be a removable memory card, magnetic disk, optical disk or magnetic tape.<br>
The benefits of the invention are associated with improved reliability of data transmission to and from a mobile node. With the invention it is now pos­sible to provide a uninterrupted packet data connec­tion to a mobile node even as the mobile node changes from an area controlled by a first packet switching node to an area controlled by a second packet switch­ing node. The packet data connection is no longer ter­minated, if the second packet switching node proposes other compression parameters than previously used.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart depicting one em­bodiment of a method for compression parameter trans­fer, which utilizes a routing area update signaling as illustrated in Figure 4. The signaling is performed in the GPRS system architecture, which is illustrated in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. At step 500 a MS 100 waits for Rout­ing Area (RA) update condition. RA update condition is fulfilled as MS 100 detects an event that indicates that it must start using a new cell (not shown) . The new cell is within a new routing area, which is con­trolled by a new SGSN 204. MS 100 sends a Routing Area Update Request message to SGSN 204 as illustrated with arrow 401. Thereupon, the method continues at step 502.<br>
At step 502 SGSN 204 sends an SGSN Context Request message illustrated with arrow 402 to SGSN 202 to get the mobility management and PDF contexts for MS 100. SGSN 202 obtains the SNDCP parameters associated with an SNDCP entity 252. The SNDCP parameters com­prise at least the SNDCP compression parameters. The SGSN 202 packs the SNDCP parameters 450 to the SGSN Context Response message. In one embodiment of the in­vention, the SNDCP parameters are packet to the pri­vate extension information element, which may be in­cluded in any GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) signaling message. The GTP and the private extension information element are defined in the 3GPP specification 29.060. The format of the SNDCP parameters carried in the pri­vate extension information element is the same as is used in XID negotiation procedure. The format is de­fined in the 3GPP specification 44.065, which defines the SNDCP protocol layer in GPRS. Thereupon, SGSN 202 responds with the SGSN Context Response message illus­trated with arrow 403. SGSN 204 takes the SNDCP pa­rameters and provides them to SNDCP entity 254.' The SGSN Context Response message provides also the mobil­ity management context and at least one PDF context associated with MS 100.<br>
At step 504 SGSN 204 starts performing the XID Reset procedure. SNDCP entity 254 requests the XID Reset procedure from the LLC entity associated with Service Access Point Identifier 1 using a primitive<br>
LLGMM-RESET. Thereupon, the LLC entity forms an XID Command frame, provides it with the XID Reset parame­ter and IOV-UI parameter. The LLC entity sends the XID Command to the peer LLC entity as illustrated with ar­row 404. The peer LLC entity resets all other SAPIs and default values are taken into use.<br>
The peer LLC entity in MS 100 prepares and sends an XID Response message to SGSN 204 as illus­trated with arrow 405. LLC entity in SGSN 204 responds with LLGMM-RESET-CNF primitive to SNDCP entity 254, which verifies that a successful XID negotiation of Reset and IOV-UI has been made.<br>
After having received the SGSN 204 address from SGSN Context Request message, SGSN 202 may start forwarding packets to it as illustrated with arrow 406. SGSN 204 must update PDP contexts in the GGSNs that have PDP contexts active for MS 100. The updating of PDP contexts specifies, for example, the new SGSN address for the GGSNs. SGSN 204 sends the Update PDP Context Request message to GGSN 200 and receives Up­date PDP Context Response message as acknowledgement, as illustrated with arrows 407 and 408, respectively. The routing area update is acknowledged with Routing Area Update Accept message sent by SGSN 204 to MS 100 as illustrated with arrow 409.<br>
At step 506 SGSN 204 waits for Routing Area Update Complete message to SGSN 204, as illustrated with arrow 410.<br>
At step 508 the layer-3 parameters associated with at least each logical link connection carrying user plane data are re-negotiated. The re-negotiation of connections comprises, for example, the re-establishment of ABM modes for connections between peer LLC entities that were in ABM mode before the XID-reset, and XID-negotiation between peer LLC enti­ties that were in Asynchronous Disconnected Mode (ADM) before the XID-reset. For example, at step 508 SNDCP<br>
entity 254 of Figure 4 in SGSN 204 requests all LLC entities that were in ABM mode before the XID-reset to re-establish ABM mode. In the case illustrated in Fig­ure 4 in SGSN 204 there is one LLC entity for which ABM mode must be re-established. The SMDCP entity re­quests ABM mode establishment using LL-ESTABLISH-REQ primitive, which provides the SNDCP parameters in turn comprising the compression, parameters. In Figure 4 the LLC entity in SGSN 204 sends an SABM message as illus­trated with arrow 411. The SABM message comprises XID parameters. The XID parameters comprise the SNDCP pa­rameters 450 as layer-3 parameters. The XID negotia­tion is  performed  as  part  of  the  ABM mode  re-establishment.  The received layer-3  parameters  are sent by the LLC entity in MS 100 to the SNDCP entity 230 in MS 100. SNDCP entity 230 may change some of the SNDCP parameters to better suit its requirements while MS 100 uses the new cell. For example, MS 100 may de­cide to change at least one compression algorithm and its compression parameters to suit better the data transfer rates available in the new cell. SNDCP entity 230 provides the changed SNDCP parameters to LLC en­tity in MS 100, which responds with an Unnumbered Ac­knowledgement (UA) message that comprises SNDCP pa­rameters 451 changed by SNDCP entity 230 as XID pa­rameters. The UA message sent from MS 100 to SGSN 204 is illustrated with arrow 412. Received SNDCP parame­ters 451 are provided by the LLC entity in SGSN 204 to SNDCP entity 254.<br>
XID-negotiation between peer LLC entities that were in Asynchronous Disconnected Mode (ADM) be­fore the XID-reset involves the exchange of XID Com­mand and XID Response messages, which carry the XID-parameters, for example, the SNDCP parameters.<br>
After the negotiation is successful, at step 510 the SNDCP entities in MS 100 and SGSN 204 may start transmitting packets over the logical link con-<br>
neetions that have re-negoriated there SNDCP parame­ters .<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the SNDCP parameters are also sent during handover processing, when a real-time packet stream must be transmitted to a mobile station via a new SGSN, which serves a cell to which the mobile station is performing handover from an old cell. In that case the SNDCP parameters are sent, for example, in association with handover request message that is sent from the old SGSN to the new SGSN. Thereupon, the SNDCP parameters are provided to the mobile station.<br>
Figure 6 is a block diagram depicting the ar­chitecture of a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) in one embodiment of the invention. In Figure 6 there is an SGSN 600. SGSN 600 comprises a user plane protocol stack pair 610. Protocol stack pair 610 comprises a protocol stack for communicating over the Gb-interface, a protocol stack for communicating with a GGSN, and a relay function for relaying packets be­tween the two protocol stacks. SGSN 600 comprises also a protocol stack 612 for communicating with another SGSN. Protocol stack 612 is a GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) stack for control plane. When receiving an SGSN Context Request message from another SGSN, a GTP-C protocol entity 604 is configured to request the SNDCP parameters from an SNDCP entity 602. Upon receiving the request from GTP-C protocol entity 604, SNDCP en­tity 602 is configured to collect information held at SNDCP entity 602 that is associated with the mobile station pointed to using the TLLI that was obtained in the SGSN Context Request message. The SNDCP parameters comprise at least the SNDCP compression parameters pertaining to compression entities, together with the algorithm and parameters for each compression entity. SNDCP entity 602 is configured to respond to the re­quest and to provide the SNDCP parameters to GTP-C<br>
protocol entity 604 In one embodiment of the inven­tion, GTP-C protocol entity 604 is configured to re­turn SNDCP compression parameter default values that are always used at the SGSN without separately con­sulting SNDCP entity 602. The providing of information from SNDCP entity 602 to GTP-C protocol entity 604 is illustrated in Figure 6 with arrow 606.<br>
