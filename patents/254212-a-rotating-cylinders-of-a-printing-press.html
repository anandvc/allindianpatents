				<td>Description<br>
Rotating cylinders of a printing machine with end sided necks.<br>
The invention refers to rotating cylinders of a printing machine with end sided necks<br>
as per generic term of claims 1 or 2.<br>
Through the EPO 699 524 Bl drive pullings of printing units are revealed in doing so<br>
in an execution a single drive of the printer cylinder takes place through a single<br>
motor. In a design of the drive motor the rotor carrying the windings is movable<br>
axially opposite to a rack fixed stator.<br>
The DE 195 34 651 Al reveals a printing unit with cylinders lying in one plane, in<br>
doing so three from four cylinders are supported movable linear along cylinder plane<br>
for print-on or rather print-off position. On a front side of the cylinders their bearing<br>
takes place in jaws traversable away from each other, which from their side are rested<br>
on carriers which are supported on guide items assembled on the rack internal wall.<br>
The cylinders through pressure medium operated working cylinders are on-/off<br>
adjustable to each other and are rotatable in each case through drive motor. The stators<br>
of adjustable cylinders are assembled at the respective bearing holding device, the<br>
rotors are assembled on respective cylinder necks. On one of both rack sides the<br>
cylinder neck does not appear to penetrate the alignment of the side rack. On the<br>
machine side showing the jaws, the jaws admitting the necks with regard to the<br>
alignment of the side rack appear to be assembled on the internal side.<br>
In the WO 02/08 1218 A2 individual linear bearings for two transmission cylinders<br>
supported each in slide are known, in doing so the slide is rested on an input which<br>
comes out in direction cylinder from the alignment of the side rack. The drive of the<br>
cylinder takes place pair wise or individually through internal drive motors, in doing<br>
so the motor can be rack fixed in represented execution and can not be designed<br>
carried along in more closely represented way.<br>
Through the WO 03/025 406 Al a bearing assembly for cylinder is revealed in which<br>
one slide enclosing a linear guide is movable through an actuator assembled on the<br>
rack.<br>
The EP 1175 300 Bl shows a flexo printing machine with a plate cylinder driven<br>
directly on the neck, in doing so the motor is rested on a sliding item which is<br>
assembled on a carrying shoulder of the machine rack.<br>
Through the WO 98/06 581 Al a drive of a cylinder is revealed whose cylinder neck<br>
projecting in the alignment of the side rack via a coupling as for example a balancing<br>
coupling is combined with the rotor shaft of the drive motor. The stator is preferably<br>
assembled at an eccentric cam in which the cylinder neck is supported for the purpose<br>
of bearing change of cylinder axle.<br>
The EP 1052 093 A2 reveals a drive of a printer cylinder, in doing so a rotor is<br>
combined directly with the stub axle of the cylinder. The stator is combined via a<br>
1<br><br>
follow-up equipment with the side rack. The drive motor is design wise built as<br>
inserted motor, which can be executed as 3- phase current servomotor in synchronous<br>
design with permanent magnets. The EP 1052 093 A2 shows however no closer<br>
specific positioning direction, no cylinder neck which does not penetrate the<br>
alignment of the side rack, no cylinder whose length together with both necks is<br>
smaller / equal to clear span, no stator of the motor combined firmly in such way to<br>
the bearing block so that it moves along in adjustment and also no stator movable in<br>
axial direction and no execution with rotor movable axially relative to the rotating<br>
component.<br>
In the EPO 722 831 A2 like wise a drive of a printing unit cylinder is revealed, in<br>
doing so a rotor is combined directly with the stub axle of the cylinder. The rotor is<br>
movable together with the rotating component relative to the side rack. The stator is<br>
combined via a follow-up equipment with the side rack, in doing so via an additional<br>
linking equipment the eccentric disk carrying the stator may be coupled to each other<br>
firmly optionally, with an eccentric disk carrying the drive shaft. In not more closely<br>
described execution - in order to follow up the stator for maintaining of a sufficient<br>
air gap - a linear motor can engage on a supported stator shiftable axially. The EPO<br>
722 831 A2 shows however like wise no closer specified positioning direction, no<br>
cylinder neck, which does not penetrate the alignment of the side rack, no cylinder<br>
whose length together with both necks is less in length to the clear span, no drive<br>
motor designed as synchronous motor with permanent magnet activation and no<br>
execution with axially movable rotor relative to the rotating component.<br>
The DE 102 19903 Al reveals a friction cylinder, in doing so a rotor of a motor<br>
driving the friction cylinder is fixed on the cylinder neck and it's stator is fixed on the<br>
wall.<br>
The assignment lies at the base of the invention, to provide rotating cylinder of a<br>
printing machine with end sided necks simply built and yet powerful drives.<br>
The assignment is solved as per invention through the features of claim 1 or 2.<br>
The advantages to be obtained with the invention comprise in particular therein, mat a<br>
specially simple drive of an individually driven, movably rested rotation body of the<br>
printing machine is found. Through the special assembly of the bearing, the short neck<br>
and the detachable assembly of the motor on the movable bearing block or the side<br>
rack, the erection and the design is specially simple and serves over and above the<br>
vibration minimizing. Further in special execution through permanent magnet<br>
activated motors a specially stronger drive of the rotation body is achieved in small<br>
dimensions.<br>
In an advantageous execution, in which a motor internal bearing between stator and<br>
rotor can be dispensed with, the motor is specially simple designed and / or with<br>
regard to wearing parts specially requires little maintenance.<br>
In an advantageous execution as permanent excited motor the motor is designed with<br>
specially high drive capacity at simultaneously small structure size. Further to this,<br>
2<br><br>
herein electrical transmission media as for example sliding contact on a rotating<br>
component as for example the rotor are dispensed with when the rotor for the<br>
formation of magnet field has instead of electro-magnetically excited coils permanent<br>
magnets.<br>
Through an input of linear guides for the printer cylinders an ideal assembly position<br>
of the cylinders in relation to possible cylinder vibrations is reached. In addition<br>
through the cylinder bearing in linear guides minor actuator travels are realized and<br>
therefore also no synchronous spindle is required. The expensive assembly of three-<br>
ring bearing is dispensed with.<br>
The bearing inside on the side racks allows in addition to the simple assembly also the<br>
shortening of cylinder neck which is also effective as vibration reducer and also space<br>
saver.<br>
In the execution as per invention with the stator assembled on movable bearing block<br>
a simple coupling of cylinder and motor is provided.<br>
The further development of the linear bearing with movable stops makes possible a<br>
print relevant adjustment of the cylinder and further to this an automatic base<br>
adjustment- for a new configuration, a new off-set blanket etc.<br>

A printing machine, as for example reel fed rotary press, in particular a multi ink reel<br>
fed rotary press shows a printing unit 01 in which a print material 02, as for example a<br>
material path 02, short path 02 both side wise single or in particular in series both side<br>
wise in multiple as for example here four times or yet more number of paths at the<br>
same time may be printed in single way or in multiple ways through printer 04. Also<br>
one or more number of printing units 01 or rather printers 04 can be planned, in which<br>
one path 02 on the print position 05 is printable only one sided. The printers 04 have<br>
printer cylinders 06, 07 which are to be adjusted in print-on pair wise to each other.<br>
The solutions shown in the following can also be applied advantageously to printer 04<br>
in which the print material 02 is designed not as path shaped but as arch.<br>
Now it is advantageous that one or more number of printer cylinders 06, 07 and/or<br>
other rotating components - an internal, at least mechanically independent from other<br>
printers 04 or rather other aggregates - have drive motor (see below). This is<br>
preferably assembled mainly co-axially to the printer cylinder 06, 07 and in<br>
advantageous execution is coupled without intermediately connected gears to the<br>
printer cylinders 06; 07.<br>
The execution and coupling of the drive motor can be designed in manifold ways and<br>
is described closer below. Like wise these executions can be input in printers 04 or<br>
rather printing units 01 or also for other driven rotating components of most different<br>
design, in doing so in the following the input is described with the help of an<br>
advantageous execution of a printing unit 01 or rather advantageous design of a<br>
printer 04.<br>
The printing unit 01 shows in the example present here multiple number (in present<br>
case four) of vertically one above the other assembled double printers 03 for the both<br>
sided print in rubber-against-rubber-operation.<br>
5<br><br>
The double printer 03-here in shape of bridges-or-n-printers represented - are built in<br>
each case through two printers 04, which show each cylinders 06; 07 as for example<br>
printer cylinders 06; 07 designed one as transmission cylinder 06 and one as plate<br>
cylinder 07 as well as in each case one inking unit 08 and in case of wet off set print<br>
additionally a moist unit 09.<br>
In each case between the both transmission cylinders 06 in adjustment position a<br>
(double-) print position 05 is built. The mentioned components are denoted only on<br>
top most double printer 03 of Figure 1, in doing so the (double-) printers 03, 04<br>
assembled one above the other however mainly - in particular in the design of the<br>
features relevant for the invention - are executed identically. The double printers 03 -<br>
without the advantageous features of linear assembly described below - can be<br>
equally well executed against the representation in Figure 1 as U-unit opening<br>
upwards.<br>
As described to Figure 2 and 3 the printing unit 01 can be executed in an<br>
advantageous execution as for example centrally that means in the area of double print<br>
positions 05 or yet as represented in Figure 4, between plate cylinders 07 and inking<br>
unit 08 divisible operationally.<br>
In the upper double printer 03 of Figure 2 exemplany bearing assembly 14 are<br>
represented which - as for example for the purpose of on-/off positions-makes<br>
possible a movement of the respective cylinder 06; 07 in a direction vertical to it's<br>
rotation axle. This can in principle be an eccentric bearing assembly, a lever assembly<br>
or else in advantageous execution (see below) a linear bearing assembly, as for<br>
example a bearing unit 14.<br>
As likewise indicated as example in Figure 2 and 4, the ink units 08 (and if required<br>
moist units 09) can be designed as module having already multiple number of rollers<br>
with internal rack 16 or rather a frame structure 16 and can be designed as pre-<br>
erectable module applicable in the print unit 01. As explained below more in details,<br>
the cylinders 06, 07 with bearing units 14 allocated to them can be designed as pre-<br>
erectable or rather pre-erected cylinder units 17. In advantageous execution the<br>
rotation axles of the printer cylinders 06, 07 of a printer 04 can be executed in print-on<br>
mainly lying in a common plane E. The plane E takes in as for example an angle<br>
between 76° and 87°, in particular between 80° and 85° to the plane of the entering path<br>
02.<br>
In the following Figures 2 and 3 an advantageous execution of the printing unit 01 is<br>
represented in doing so this in the area of their double print positions 05, operation<br>
point of view, that means for set-up-and maintenance purpose (in contrast to<br>
disassembly or rather a demolition), is executed divisibly. Both the parts separable<br>
from each other are denoted here with part print units 01.1 and 01.2.<br>
For this the printer cylinders 06, 07 of multiple number (four) of double printers 03<br>
assembled one above the other, are rested rotatably in or rather on a right and a left<br>
rack-or rather wall section 11:12 as for example side rack 11, 12 in the way that both<br>
the printer cylinders 06,07 of a same printer 04 are allocated to the same rack or rather<br>
6<br><br>
wall section 11, 12. Preferably the printer cylinders 06, 07 of more number, in<br>
particular of all printers 04 printing the path 02 on the same side are rested on the<br>
same rack-or rather wall section 11,12.<br>
Printer cylinders 06; 07 can be supported in principle only one sided, that means over<br>
hung on only just one front sided rack section 11. Favourably however per part print<br>
unit 01.1; 01.2 two front sided rack sections 11; 12 assembled to the cylinders 06; 07<br>
are planned. Both the part print units 01.1 and 10.2 separable from each other have the<br>
respective rack sections 11,12 and printer 04 (printer cylinder 06; 07 and inking unit<br>
08 as well as if required moist unit 09).<br>
The part print units 01.1; 01.2 are movable along a direction vertical to the rotation<br>
axle of the cylinders 06; 07, one on top of other towards or rather away from each<br>
other in which one from both preferably space fixed (here part print unit 01.1) that<br>
means as for example on a floor 13 of the printing unit space, on a space fixed carrier<br>
13, on a fitting plate 13 or on a fitting frame 13 for the printing unit 01 is stationarily<br>
rested and the other (here part print unit 01.2) movably is rested against the floor 13 or<br>
rather carrier 13 or rather fitting plate 13 or fitting frame 13 (in the following carrier<br>
13).<br>
For this the external rack sections 12 are rested corresponding to each other, in not<br>
represented bearing items of the rack section 12 and of the carrier 13, as for example<br>
forming jointly a linear guide 15. These can be executed as rolls running on rails or<br>
else also as slide-or rolling element supported linear guide items allocated to each<br>
other.<br>
Preferably the wall sections 11; 12 are designed such that they are designed in their<br>
operating position A (Fig 2) on their side turned to each other pair wise in mainly<br>
shape complementary to each other and driven together on their separating lines or<br>
rather joint lines yet form mainly a closed side front.<br>
Figure 3 shows a maintenance position B of the printing unit 01 (without the bearing<br>
units 14 indicated in Figure 2), in doing so the relative position of the part print units<br>
01.1; 01.2 to each other is caused through movement of rack sections 12. The relative<br>
position can also be basically reached in another execution in which both the part print<br>
units 01.1; 01.2 or rather their rack sections 11; 12 are movably rested.<br>
In a variant (Figure 4) of a divisible printing unit 01 the side rack 11; 12 is not<br>
divisible in the way that the printer cylinders 06; 07 are separated at the print position<br>
05, but the printer cylinders 06; 07 in rather on a joint side rack 11; 12 are supported<br>
not divisibly, while to both sides the wall section 18 admitting the ink unit 08 may be<br>
brought up in an operating position A (not represented) or a maintenance position &amp;<br>
(represented). The division takes place here between plate cylinder 07 and ink- as well<br>
if required moist unit 08; 09.<br>
Plate-and transmission cylinder 07; 06 can be designed in an advantageous format<br>
design with roll barrel length of at least four as for example four or also for specially<br>
high production push six, print pages in news paper format in particular, in broad<br>
7<br><br>
sheet format existing assembled side by side. Thus a double wide path 02 side by side<br>
with four or rather one three times wide path 02 side by side with six newspaper pages<br>
can be printed and the plate cylinder 07 corresponding with four or rather six printing<br>
blocks, in particular with their ends aligned to each other can be assigned side by side.<br>
In a first format design the cylinders 06, 07 show a circumference which mainly<br>
corresponds to two one after the other assembled print pages in a newspaper format, in<br>
particular in the broad sheet format.<br>
In the executions of the printing unit 01 with plate cylinders 07 double large formats<br>
(two newspaper pages in the circumference one after the other) shows this in<br>
advantageous way two channels in circumference direction shifted around 180° to<br>
each other for admission of printing blocks, which preferably are designed via the<br>
totally effective roll barrel length through out The plate cylinder 07 can be fitted then<br>
with four or rather six print blocks side by side and each two print blocks one behind<br>
the other.<br>
The transmission cylinder 06 shows in double large format (two newspaper pages in<br>
the circumference one after the other) in an execution as for example only one channel<br>
for admission of one or more number of off-set blankets assembled side by side which<br>
is designed preferably over the entirely effective roll barrel length, through out.<br>
The transmission cylinder 06 can then be fitted with one off-set blanket going through<br>
via roll barrel length and reaching over mainly the full circumference or with two or<br>
three off-set blankets side by side reaching over mainly the full circumference. In<br>
another execution of double large transmission cylinders 06 this can have two or three<br>
off-set blankets side by side, in doing so these are shifted to each other around 180° in<br>
circumference direction. These off-set blankets shifted to each other can be held in<br>
two or rather three channel sections, which likewise are shifted in longitudinal<br>
direction of the cylinder 06 side by side, the respectively adjacent channel section,<br>
however around 180° to each other in circumference direction. In another execution<br>
the cylinders 06; 07 however also with single circumference- a print page in particular<br>
newspaper page in circumference direction-can be designed. Also the transmission<br>
cylinder 06 with double circumference and the plate cylinder 07 with single<br>
circumference can be designed. In the printers 04 for the job printing the cylinders 06;<br>
07 can be designed with circumference which corresponds to four lying tabloid pages.<br>
Basically the ink unit 08 can be designed in different way. It can be designed as<br>
represented as an example in Figure 1 as for example as intaking roller ink unit 08 as<br>
for example with two friction cylinders (as for example out of newspaper print) or else<br>
as example shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 as short ink unit 08 under use of a raster<br>
roller having cups.<br>
In not represented execution it can also be executed as roller ink unit 08 with two ink<br>
drawings and as for example three friction cylinders (as for example out of job<br>
printing).<br>
8<br><br>
In the case of dry off-set per printer 04 an inking unit 08, however no damping unit 09<br>
is planned. In the moist off-set, through the damping unit 09, strictly separated from<br>
inking unit 08 or else parallel combined via a stripper roller with the inking unit 08,<br>
moist medium is supplied.<br>
The damping unit 09 can be designed as damping unit 09 with at least three rollers<br>
(represented in Figure 1). Preferably the damping unit 09 is executed as so called<br>
contact less damping unit 09 in particular spray damping unit 09. As indicated like<br>
wise in Figure 2 and Figure 3 the printers 04 can have in each case a handling device<br>
19 for support of the printing block change. In preferred execution the handling device<br>
19 is executed as at least part automatic or even fully automatic printing block changer<br>
19.<br>
Independent from the advantageous design of the bearing described below, as bearing<br>
unit 14, it's special design and assembly, the coupling of the drive to the cylinder 06;<br>
07 a print-on-position from printer cylinder 06; 07 or rather at least a print-on-position<br>
in the frame work of the presetting of a position limited stop, by means of at least one<br>
actuator 43 can take place, in particular through a power controlled or rather via a<br>
power defined actuator 43 by means of which for positioning a defined or rather<br>
definable force F may be brought in print-on-direction on the cylinders 06; 07 or<br>
rather it's necks 21; 22. The specific loading in the nipping positions decisive for the<br>
ink transmission and with it the print quality among others, is therefore defined not<br>
through an indirect parameter like as for example a measured printing strip, but rather<br>
through the force equilibrium between the force F and the specific loading FL resulting<br>
between the cylinders 06; 07 and the resultant equilibrium.<br>
The planned actuator 43 in the projecting execution of the bearing units 14 is designed<br>
for that to prepare a suitable actuator travel As for the on-or rather off position and<br>
has therefore preferably at least one As corresponding stroke. The actuator 43 is<br>
planned for adjustment of the position print of rollers or rather cylinders 06, 07<br>
positioned to each other and/or for carrying out of print-on-/ off-position and is<br>
correspondingly designed. The actuator travel As (or rather stroke) amounts at least<br>
as for example 0.5mm for the plate cylinder 07 in particular at least 1mm.<br>
For base adjustment of a system therefore it can be planned in an advantageous<br>
execution that at least one cylinder 06 (07) may be set-up during a time gap in<br>
adjustment - without effective path limitation for print positions 05 - only power<br>
controlled on the adjacent cylinder 06 (07).<br>
Advantageously at least during a definite time gap of the adjustment process one<br>
cylinder 06 involved in the print position 05 is fixable or rather at least in direction of<br>
the print position 05 path limitable in a definite position, advantageously in the<br>
adjustment position found through the power equilibrium.<br>
In the following the principle of the power conn-oiled positioning (at least during the<br>
adjustment process) is explained in advantageous executions for the bearing and the<br>
actuator.<br>
9<br><br>
Figure 5 shows in plan view on the side racks in bearing units 14 rotatably supported<br>
cylinder 06, 07. In the execution with modules executed as cylinder units 17 (see<br>
below to Figure 6 and Figure 7) they show as for example a cylinder 06,07 with necks<br>
21, 22 and a pre-erected bearing unit 14 (pre-stressed and / or pre-adjusted) on the<br>
necks 21, 22. Bearing unit 14 and cylinder06, 07 receive already before the input in<br>
the print unit 01 their firmly defined position to each other and may be brought in<br>
together in the print unit 01.<br>
In an advantageous execution of the print unit 01 it is planned to rest the cylinders 06,<br>
07 rotatably in bearing unit 14 on the side racks 11, 12 which do not penetrate the<br>
alignment of the side racks 11, 12 and/or cylinders 06; 07 with their barrels 26; 27<br>
show including their necks 21; 22 a length L06; L07 which is smaller or equal to a<br>
clear span L between the side racks 11; 12 (Figure 5) carrying the printer cylinders 06;<br>
07 to both front sides. In the side racks 11; 12 carrying the printer cylinders 06; 07 to<br>
both front sides it does not deal preferably side wise with such open side racks so that<br>
the cylinders 06; 07 are axially removable rather with side racks 11,12 which show in<br>
axial direction one at least partly over lapping with the front side of the erected<br>
cylinder 06; 07 mat means the cylinder 06,07, in particulars it's bearing (see below) is<br>
surrounded front sided through the both side racks 11; 12 at least partly.<br>
Preferably all four printer cylinders 06; 07 (at least however three) have an internal<br>
bearing unit 14, in which the on-/off position mechanism is already integrated. It can<br>
also be planned for three or four cylinders 06; 07 bearing units 14 showing the on-/off<br>
position mechanism and for the fourth bearing unit 14 without on/off position<br>
mechanism.<br>
Figure 6and 7 show a preferred bearing unit 14 in schematically length- and cross<br>
section, based on linear actuator travels. The bearing unit 14 integrating the on-/off<br>
position mechanism shows in addition a bearing 31 as for example radial bearing 31,<br>
as for example a cylinder roller bearing 21, for rotational bearing of the cylinder 06;<br>
07 bearing medium 32, 33 or rather bearing item 32, 33 for a radial movement of the<br>
cylinder 06; 07- for print-on-or rather print-off position. For this the bearing unit 14<br>
(after fitting of the bearing unit 14 rack fixed) shows carrier fixed bearing items 32 as<br>
well as the bearing items 33 movable against this. The carrier fixed and movable<br>
bearing item 32; 33 are designed as jointly working linear items 32; 33 and jointly<br>
with corresponding sliding surface or in between lying rolling elements altogether as<br>
linear bearing 29. The linear items 32; 33 admit pair wise between them a bearing<br>
block 34 as for example slide 34 admitting the radial bearing 31. Bearing block 34 and<br>
the movable bearing item 33 can also be executed as single piece. The carrier fixed<br>
bearing items 32 are assembled on a carrier 37 which altogether is combined with side<br>
rack 11,12. The carrier 37 is as for example executed as carrier plate 37, which as for<br>
example has at least on one drive side a recess 38 for the engagement of a shaft 39 as<br>
for example drive shaft 39 of a neck 21; 22 of a cylinder 06; 07 not represented in<br>
Figure 7. Also the side rack 11; 12 on the drive side shows preferably a cut out or<br>
rather a break-out for a drive shaft 39. On the front side lying opposite to the drive<br>
side a recess 38 or a cutout in side rack 12; 11 must not be planned compulsorily.<br>
10<br><br>
Preferably a length of the linear bearing 29, in particular at least a length of the rack<br>
fixed bearing medium 32 in fitted condition, of the linear bearing 29 in the position<br>
direction S, is considered smaller than a diameter of the allocated printer cylinder 06;<br>
07.<br>
The design of the linear bearing 29 in the way that the jointly working bearing item<br>
32, 33 both are planned on the component bearing unit 14 - and not a part on the side<br>
rack 11,12 of the print unit 01 - makes possible a pre-assembly and pre adjustment or<br>
rather adjustment of the bearing tension. The advantageous assembly of both the<br>
linear bearings 29 engaging bearing block 34 makes possible a free from back lash<br>
adjustment, since both the linear bearings 29 lie opposite to each other in the way that<br>
the bearing pre-stress and the bearing forces receive or rather admit a main component<br>
in a direction vertical to rotation axle of the cylinder 06,07. The linear bearings 29 are<br>
thus adjustable in that direction on which it comes to the free from back lash position<br>
of the cylinder 06; 07. The assembly of the linear bearings 29 contains also special<br>
advantage with regard to the stiffness and stability. This is specially required in<br>
connection with an execution of a coupling of a stator (86, see below) on the bearing<br>
block 34.<br>
The linear bearings 29 (32,33) identifiable in Figure 6 and Figure 7 show thus in each<br>
case pairs corresponding, jointly working bearing medium 32 and 33 or rather their<br>
guide or working areas, designed as sliding surface (not represented) or with<br>
intermediately assembled rolling elements 23. As represented in Figure 8 in preferred<br>
execution at least of one of both, advantageously bom linear bearings 29 of a bearing<br>
unit 14 is executed such that both corresponding bearing media 32 and 33 in each case<br>
have at least two guiding areas 32.1; 32.2; 33.1; 33.2 which lie in planes El; E2<br>
inclined to each other. Both the guiding areas 32.1; 32.2; 33.1; 33.2 (or rather their<br>
planes Ei, E2) of the same bearing medium 32; 33 are as for example inclined to each<br>
other V-shaped as for example with an intermediate angle between 30 to 60°, in<br>
particular between 40 and 50°. Both the guiding areas 33.1; 33.2; 32.1; 32.2 of the<br>
jointly working bearing medium 33; 32 are inclined for this shape complementarity.<br>
At least one of both the pairs of jointly working guide areas 32.1; 32.2; 33.1; 33.2 lies<br>
parallel to a plane Ei which has a component unequal to zero in radial direction of the<br>
cylinder axle and through it prevents the movement degree of freedom in a purely<br>
axial direction of the cylinder 06; 07. Preferably both the pairs lie to plane Ei; E2<br>
which both show a component unequal to zero in radial direction of the cylinder axle,<br>
however in reverse inclination against the cylinder axle and through it prevent the<br>
movement degree of freedom in both axial directions of the cylinder 06; 07. A section<br>
line of bom planes Et; E2 runs parallel to the position direction S.<br>
In case, as identified in Figure 6, the bearing block 34 is enclosed between the both<br>
linear bearings 29 showing each two pairs jointly working guide areas 32.1; 33.1 and<br>
32.2; 33.2, in particular pre-stressed with pre-stressing, then the bearing block 34 has<br>
yet only one single movement degree of freedom along the position direction S.<br>
The inclined working - or rather guide areas 32.1; 32.2; 33.1; 33.2 are assembled in<br>
such way that they work oppositely to a relative movement of bearing parts of linear<br>
bearing 29 in axial direction of the cylinder 06; 07 that means the bearing is fixed in<br>
11<br><br>
axial direction. Preferably the linear bearings 29 of both bearing units 14 allocated to a<br>
cylinder 06; 07 front sidedly, show two such type pairs of jointly working guide areas<br>
32.1; 32.2; 33.1; 33.2 assembled to each other. In this case however in an<br>
advantageous way at least one of both the radial bearings 31 of both the bearing units<br>
14 has minor bearing end float A31 in axial direction.<br>
In Figure 6 and 8 the guide areas 32.1; 32.2; show the rack fixed bearing medium 32<br>
of the linear guide 29 in the semi space turned to the necks 21; 22. Hie rack fixed<br>
bearing medium 32 engage here the bearing block 34 assembled between mem. The<br>
rack fixed guide areas 32.1; 32.2 of both the linear bearings 29 engage thus partly the<br>
guide areas 33.1, 33.2 of the bearing block 34 with regard to an axial direction of the<br>
cylinder 06; 07.<br>
For correct placing of the bearing units 14 or rather cylinder units 17, together with<br>
bearing unit 14 erection aids 51, as for example dowel pins 51 can be planned in side<br>
rack 11; 12 to which the bearing unit 14 of the fully fitted cylinder unit 17 is aligned<br>
before they are combined through detachable holding medium 53, as for example<br>
screws 53 or even material fittingly through welding with side rack 11; 12. For the<br>
adjustment of the bearing pre-stressing in the linear bearing 29 to be taken up already<br>
before the input in the printing unit 01 and or after the input to be readjusted<br>
corresponding medium 54 as for example tension screws 54 can be planned (Figure<br>
6). Preferably the bearing unit 14- at least for cylinder side there-is protected through<br>
a cover 57 extensively against pollution or rather even executed as capsuled as<br>
component.<br>
In Figure 6 schematically the cylinder 06; 07 is identified with necks 21; 22 and a pre-<br>
erected bearing unit 14. This component can be input pre-erected between the side<br>
rack 11, 12 of the print unit 01 in erection friendly way and can be fixed to the<br>
planned sides for this. Preferably for a module form of construction the bearing units<br>
14 for plate-and transmission cylinders 07; 06 - if required till the permitted<br>
operational size of the actuator travel - are executed as per design. Through the pre-<br>
erectable execution the effective internal area of the radial bearing 31 and the external<br>
effective casing area of the necks 21; 22 can be executed cylindrical instead of taper,<br>
since the fitting of the bearing unit 14 on the necks 21; 22 as well as the adjustment of<br>
the bearing end float can take place out side of print unit 01. The bearing unit 14 can<br>
be as for example shrink-fitted.<br>
The assembly (bearing unit 14) erectable as whole is advantageously in the type of if<br>
required partly open housing out of as for example carrier 37 and/or as for example a<br>
frame (Figure 7) as for example the four side carriers 61; 62; 63; 64 as for example the<br>
side plates 61; 62; 63; 64 limiting the bearing unit 14 to all four sides towards out side<br>
and/or as for example the cover 57 (Figure 6). Inside of this housing or rather of this<br>
frame work the bearing block 34 showing the radial bearing 31, the linear bearing 29<br>
as well as in advantageous execution as for example the actuators 43 or the actuators<br>
43 are accommodated.<br>
The rack fixed bearing items 32 are assembled mainly parallel to each other and<br>
define a positioning direction S (Figure 7).<br>
12<br><br>
A print-on-position takes place through movement of the bearing block 34 in direction<br>
print position 05 by means of a force F brought up through at least one actuator 43 on<br>
the bearing block 34, in particular through a force controlled or rather via a force<br>
defined actuator 43, by means of which for positioning of a defined or rather definable<br>
force F in print-on-direction may be brought up on the bearing block 34 (Figure 7).<br>
The specific loading in the nipping positions decisive for the ink transmission and<br>
with it the print quality among others is therefore not defined through actuator travel,<br>
rather through the force equilibrium between the force F and specific load F1 resulting<br>
between the cylinders 06; 07 and the resulting equilibrium. In a first, not particularly<br>
represented execution cylinders 06, 07 are pair wise positioned to each other in which<br>
the bearing block 34 is charged with the correspondingly adjusted force F via the<br>
actuator (s) 43. In case more number (as for example three or four) of cylinders 06,<br>
07, in each case working jointly pair wise adjacent to each other in direct following<br>
are executed without a possibility for fixing or limiting of the actuator travel with a<br>
pure force dependent position mechanism, then in fact a system adjusted already in<br>
relation to the required pressure (specified load) is again correctly adjusted in<br>
sequence and followingly to take up a base adjustment on ground of partly over<br>
lapping reaction it is only hardly possible.<br>
For base adjustment of a system (with corresponding equipments etc) it is therefore<br>
planned in an advantageous execution that at least both the middle of four cylinders 06<br>
- or other wise expressed, at least all of cylinders 06 different from both the external<br>
cylinders 07 at least during a time gap in adjustment in a definite position are fixable<br>
or rather at least position limitable advantageously in the adjustment position found<br>
out through force equilibrium.<br>
An execution is specially advantageous, wherein the bearing block 34 - also during<br>
the operation - at least is movably supported in one direction from the print position<br>
05 away against a force as for example spring force, in particular a definable force.<br>
With it - in contrast to pure path limitation - at one side a maximum specific load in<br>
joint working of the cylinders 06; 07 is defined and on the other side a compliance as<br>
for example a path tearing with following winder on cylinder 06; 07 is made possible.<br>
To a side turned to the print position 05, bearing unit 14 - at least during the<br>
adjustment process - has a location changeable stop 41 which limits the actuator<br>
travel to the print position 05. The stop 41 is location changeable in the way, that the<br>
stop area 44 effective as stop is variable along the position direction S at least in one<br>
area. An adjustment device is thus planned in an advantageous execution (shiftable<br>
stop 41), by means of which the position of a print position near end - of - run<br>
position of the bearing block 34 is adjustable. For path limitation / adjustment, as for<br>
example a wedge drive serves as described below. The positioning of the stop 41 can<br>
basically take place manually or via an adjusting medium 46 executed as actuator 46.<br>
Further in advantageous execution, in Figure 6 and 7 not represented a holding or<br>
clamping medium is planned by means of which the stop 41 is fixed in the desired<br>
position. Further at least a resiliently working item 42 as for example a spring item 42<br>
13<br><br>
is planned, which brings a force FR from stop 41 in a direction from the path, on the<br>
bearing block 34. That means the spring item 42 causes a print-off-position for the<br>
case that the bearing block 34 is not impeded in other ways on the movement. A print-<br>
on-position takes place through moving of the bearing block 34 in direction stop 41<br>
through at least one actuator 43 in particular a force operated actuator 43 by means of<br>
which for positioning selectively a definite or definable force F in print-on-direction<br>
may be brought up on the bearing block 34. In case this force is greater than the re-<br>
setting force FR of the spring item 42, then in corresponding spatial design a<br>
adjustment of the cylinder 06,07 to the adjacent cylinder 06,07, and/or an adjustment<br>
of the bearing block 34 at the stop 41 takes place.<br>
In ideal case the brought up force F, the re-setting force FR and the position of the stop<br>
41 is selected such that between stop 41 and stop area of the bearing block 34 in<br>
adjustment position no essential force ∆F is transmitted, that as for example, it is<br>
valid /AF/0.l* (F - FR), in particular /∆F/
mis case the adjustment force between the cylinders 06; 07 is determined mainly via<br>
the clinging force F through the actuator 43. The specific loading in the nipping<br>
positions decisive for the ink transmission and with it the print quality among others is<br>
therefore primarily not defined through an actuator travel but in case of quasi free stop<br>
41 through the force F and the resulting equilibrium. Basically after finding of the<br>
base adjustment with the force F fitting for this a removal of stop 41 or rather a<br>
corresponding effective fixing only during base adjustment is thinkable.<br>
The actuator 43 can be executed basically as optional, actuator 43 bringing up a<br>
definite force F. advantageously the actuator 43 is executed as positioning medium 43<br>
to be operated through pressure medium in particular as piston 43 movable through a<br>
fluid.<br>
Advantageously with regard to possible tilting the assembly is of multiple number,<br>
here two such type actuators 43. The actuator (s) can either be integrated in the side<br>
carriers 63 or in the slide 34, or else as represented these can be assembled in a special<br>
component as for example an actuator item 59 and can be input in the bearing unit 14.<br>
As fluid preferably because of it's non-compressability a liquid as for example oil or<br>
water comes to input. In an other execution the actuator 43 also can be designed as<br>
piezo (piezo electric power bring up) or as magnet (magnetic force bring up), in<br>
particular electro magnet.<br>
For operation of the actuators 43 executed as hydraulic piston 43 either inside or out<br>
side of the bearing unit 14 a controllable valve 56 is planned. This is executed as for<br>
example as electronically controllable and places the hydraulic piston 43 in a position<br>
pressure less or at least on a minor pressure level, while in an other position the<br>
pressure P causing the force F exists. Additionally here for safety a not described<br>
leakage line is planned.<br>
In order to avoid too great on -/ off position path and even then to protect track<br>
winder, on the print position distant side of the bearing block 34 a path limitation<br>
through a location changeable, power limited stop 49 as overload safety 49 as for<br>
example spring item can be planned, which in operational pressure - off mat means<br>
14<br><br>
the pistons 43 are de-pressurised and/or retracted, in fact serve as stop 49 for the<br>
bearing block 34 in print-off position however complies in the case of a path winder<br>
or other excessive forces from the print position 05 and releases a greater path. A<br>
spring force of this over load safety 49 is selected greater than the sum of the forces<br>
from the spring items 42. In case of operational on- off adjustment therefore only a<br>
very short actuator travel as for example only 1 to 3 mm, may be planned.<br>
The stop 41 is executed as wedge 41 movable transverse to the positioning direction S<br>
in the represented execution (Figure 7), in doing so in movement of the same the<br>
position of the respective effective stop areas 44 varies along the position direction S.<br>
The wedge 41 supports as for example on a carrier fixed stop 58. The carrier fixed<br>
stop 58 is formed here as for example through a side carrier 61 of the bearing unit 14.<br>
The stop 41 executed as wedge 41 is movable through an actuator 46, as for example a<br>
pressure medium operating positioning item 46 like a piston 46 to be operated with<br>
pressure medium in a working cylinder with (double acting) piston via a transmission<br>
item 47 executed as for example as piston rod 47 or through an electromotor via a<br>
transmission item 47 executed as threaded spindle. This actuator 46 can be effective<br>
either in both directions or even, as represented here, may be executed as single way<br>
reactor which works in activation against a resetting spring 48. The force for the<br>
resetting spring 48 is selected so weak out of above mentioned reasons (widely power<br>
free stop 44) that the wedge 41 is held only against gravity - or vibration forces in it's<br>
correct position.<br>
Basically the stop 41 can also be executed on other type (as for example adjustable to<br>
the position direction, and fixable ram etc) in the way, that it forms in position<br>
direction S a variable and - at least during adjustment process - fixable stop area 44<br>
for the movement of the bearing block 34 in direction print position 05. In not<br>
represented execution a positioning of the stop 41 takes place as for example directly<br>
parallel to the position direction S through a drive medium, as for example a cylinder<br>
with (double acting) piston or an electromotor to be operated with pressure medium.<br>
In Figure 2 on the printer 03 executed as double printer 03 schematically per cylinder<br>
06;07 a bearing unit 14 assembled on side rack 11 is indicated. In an advantageous,<br>
here represented execution the rotation centers of cylinders 06; 07 form in print-on-<br>
setting an assumed connecting line or rather - plane E (in the following denoted as<br>
"linear double printer"). Preferably the plane E and the in- or rather out running path<br>
02 include an internal angle between 75 and 88°, in particular from 80 to 86° deviating<br>
from 90°. The bearing unit 14 of the transmission cylinder 06 in particular of all<br>
cylinders 06; 07 are assembled in the erected condition in the execution represented in<br>
Figure 2 on the side rack 11 in such way that their position directions S - as for<br>
example out of ground of a power defined print - on - setting - encloses maximum<br>
angle of 15° with the connecting plane E, as for example a peak angle of about 2° to<br>
15 , in particular form 4 to 10° with each other. In particular this assembly is of<br>
advantage with regard to the fitting when the positioning direction S runs horizontal<br>
and the path 02 runs mainly vertical.<br>
15<br><br>
In modified execution (Figure 1) of an angular (n-or u- printer) assembled double<br>
printer 03, under the plane E' the connecting plane of the cylinders 06 forming the<br>
print position 05 and under planes E" the connecting plane between plate and<br>
transmission cylinders 07, 06 will be understood and the above mentioned are related<br>
to the angle on the positioning directions at least of one of the cylinders 06 forming<br>
the print positions 05 or rather the plate cylinder 07 and the plane E' or rather E".<br>
One of the cylinders 06 forming the print position 05 can also be assembled stationary<br>
and operationally non-adjustable (if required however adjustable) in side rack 11; 12<br>
while the other is supported movable along the positioning direction S.<br>
An operational actuator travel to on -/ off-setting, along the position direction S<br>
between print-off and print-on - setting lies as for example in transmission cylinders<br>
06 at 0.5 to 3 mm, in particular at 0.5 to 1.5 mm and in the plate cylinders 07 at 1 to 5<br>
mm in particular at 1 to 3 mm.<br>
In execution as linear double printer 03 the plane E is inclined towards the plane of the<br>
in running and out running path 02 as for example an angle around 75° to 88° or rather<br>
92° to 105°, preferably an angle around 80 to 86 or rather 96 to 100°, on each of a path<br>
side (or rather 96 to 100° or rather a 80 to 86° on each other path sides).<br>
In an other not represented execution the bearing units 14 of the transmission cylinder<br>
06, in particular of all cylinders 06, 07 are assembled in erected condition on the side<br>
rack 11 in such way that their positioning directions S coincide with connecting plane.<br>
All positioning direction S of the printer 04 coincide with it and are not distanced<br>
from each other.<br>
In an execution variant the actuator 03 can be assembled integrated on the bearing<br>
block 34 and push it self off at the side plate 6.. In a further execution version,<br>
additionally at least one further, in activation acting away from the print position 05,<br>
actuator can be planned. This can replace or support the spring item 42.<br>
Figure 9 shows an execution example for the coupling of an axial drive for page<br>
recording equipment as for example on the side lying opposite to the drive side of the<br>
cylinders 06, 07; in particular of the cylinder 07 executed as plate cylinder. For this<br>
the neck 21 is coupled preferably with a device for axial movement of the cylinder 07,<br>
that means with a page recording drive 66 as for example a drive motor 66 (Figure<br>
37). The shaft 39 combined, with the neck 21 as example in the type of Figure 9 is<br>
combined via a bearing 67 as for example axial bearing with an axial drive 68,69, 72,<br>
73. The axial drive 68, 69, 72, 73 covers a spindle 68, in particular with at least one<br>
thread section 71, one spur gear 69 combined rotation fixed with the spindle 68 a<br>
pinion 72 as well as a motor 73 driving the pinion 72.<br>
The threading section 71 acts together with a bearing block fixed internal thread 74, as<br>
for example an internal thread 74 of a pot 76 combined with the bearing block 34, and<br>
causes, in case of twisting of spindle 68 an axial movement of the same together with<br>
shaft 39 (via the axial bearing 67) and neck 21.<br>
16<br><br>
The axial bearing 67 permits a relative rotation between shaft 39 and spindle 68, is<br>
designed pressure - and tension rigid however with regard to an axial direction of the<br>
cylinder 07. This takes place via a disk 78 assembled on the shaft 39 which as for<br>
example via rolling element 79 supported both side wise is path limited in both<br>
directions through spindle fixed stops 77. A shifting of the page recorder takes place<br>
now through the motor 73 via a not represented control equipment Herein the motor<br>
73 can either have at their disposal a - as for example previously calibrated<br>
correspondingly - motor internal position feed back or else a position feed back takes<br>
place at the control via a not represented sensor as for example a correspondingly<br>
calibrated rotary potentiometer which is coupled to a rotating component of the axial<br>
drive.<br>
Independent of the special design of the bearing and/or alignment of actuators travel<br>
to the plane E or rather E' or E" (small inclination or yet not) and/or of divisibility of<br>
the printing unit 01 and/or the coupling of an axial drive, followingly specially<br>
advantageous executions for coupling of a drive motor 66 to the rotation body<br>
designed here as cylinder 06; 07 and/or specially advantageous designs of the drive<br>
motor 66 driving the rotation body are shown.<br>
In an example not belonging to the invention, for the drive coupling, as represented in<br>
Figure 6 i.v.m Fig 10 or rather 11, the coupling of the cylinder 06,07 or rather of the<br>
neck 21; 22 takes place on a drive side of the print unit 01 to a drive as for example<br>
directly to a rotor of a drive motor 81 and/or a drive pulling, via at least one angle -<br>
and/or off-set balancing coupling 82. The drive motor 81, in particular it's rotor, can<br>
then be assembled rack fixed and must not follow the on-/off setting movement of the<br>
cylinder 06,07.<br>
Preferably the drive motor 81 to be coupled in this first execution for the drive of the<br>
cylinder 06; 07 (or rather rotating component) is designed as synchronous motor 81<br>
and/or permanent magnet excited electromotor, in particular as permanent magnet<br>
excited synchronous motor 81. This drive motor 81 is a directly driven circular motor<br>
and shows a stator with 3-phase current winding as well as a rotor with permanent<br>
magnets. Through this design of the drive motor 81, in particular the permanent<br>
magnets a high power density is achieved and makes therefore use of the gear ratio<br>
unnecessary. Thus the inaccuracies in drive strand as well as wear mechanical items<br>
like gear are dispensed with.<br>
The coupling of rotatory drive to the rotating component, here the cylinder 06, 07<br>
takes place herein as represented in Figure 6 as example for the first execution via the<br>
shaft 39, which covers on their cylinder near end one end of the neck 21, 22 and is<br>
combined rotation stiff as example via a clamping equipment 24 with the neck 21; 22.<br>
The clamping equipment 24 is here as for example designed as partly slit hollow shaft<br>
end which covers the neck ends (neck 21,22) and by means of a screw combination is<br>
to be pulled together in the way that a frictional locking rotation fixed combination<br>
between neck ends (necks 21; 22) and hollow shaft internal area is generated. The<br>
coupling can also in other way, as for example in circumference direction showing a<br>
form fitting, be executed. Also it is possible in an advantageous variant to<br>
manufacture the rotation fixed combination with tension elements in friction locking<br>
17<br><br>
condition. The shaft 39 is guided through a cut out in side rack 11; 12 which is<br>
dimensioned sufficiently large for the movement of the shaft 39 together with the<br>
bearing block 34 and which as for example is designed in the type of an elongated<br>
hole. As pollution safety a cover 28 with a collar covering the elongated hole can be<br>
planned, which as for example with bearing block 34, however is not combined with<br>
the shaft 39.<br>
At the cylinder distant end of the shaft 39 as represented in Figure 6, one of, if<br>
required, more in number serially assembled angle- and/or off-set balancing coupling<br>
82, in particular clutch disk coupling 82, may be coupled through a rotation fixed<br>
combination 36 as for example a tension item 36.<br>
In the Figure 10 not belonging to the invention with regard to the drive coupling<br>
schematically a drive motor 81, designed as permanent magnet excited drive motor<br>
81, in particular synchronous motor 81, is represented whose rotor 84 as for example<br>
via a motor shaft 85, carrying the rotor 84 rotation fixed and a further, rotation fixed<br>
coupling 83 as for example a jaw coupling 83 is coupled on the shaft 39. The stator 86<br>
of the drive motor 81 is combined rack fixed via a holding item 87 with the side rack<br>
11; 12. The rotor 84 is rested in the stator 86 via bearing 88 in particular radial bearing<br>
88 and if required is additionally secured against an axial movement. The axial<br>
movement in case of the cylinder 07 designed as plate cylinder 07 is taken up through<br>
the couplings 82. The rotor 84 or rather rotor of the synchronous motor 81 shows on<br>
it's circumference (in particular in circumference direction alternatively) pole out of<br>
permanent magnets 89. The stator 86 shows windings 91 lying opposite to the<br>
permanent magnet 89 for generation of magnetic fields through electric energy. The<br>
drive motor (as for example drive motor 81) designed as permanent magnet excited<br>
synchronous motor 81 is as example designed as field weakening synchronous motor.<br>
The field weakening of the synchronous motor is as for example planned up to a ratio<br>
1:10.<br>
It shows at least six pole pairs, advantageously at least 12 pole pairs. The permanent<br>
magnets 89 has preferably rare-earth-material. In particular advantageously the design<br>
of the permanent magnet 89 is with neodymium-iron-boron.<br>
The drive motor (as for example drive motor 81) designed as permanent magnet<br>
excited synchronous motor 81 shows as for example a sustained stall moment in the<br>
range of 50Nm to 200Nm, in particular for the drive of printer cylinders 06; 07 from<br>
50 to 150 Nm or rather for roller changer-or folding machine device drive of 100 to<br>
200 Nm.<br>
Advantageously the drive motor designed as permanent magnet excited synchronous<br>
motor 81 (as for example drive motor 81) has a maximum torque in range of 200 to<br>
800 Nm, 200 to 400 Nm for the drive of printer cylinders 06; 07 or rather for roller<br>
changer or folding machine drive of 600 to 800 Nm.<br>
The drive motor (as for example drive motor 81) designed as synchronous motor 81<br>
and/or permanent excited motor 81 has a for example a theoretical no-load speed in<br>
the area of 500 rotation / min to 600 rotations / min.<br>
18<br><br>
To the drive motor (as for example drive motor 81) designed as synchronous motor 81<br>
and/or permanent excited motor as for example a frequency converter is pre-<br>
connected for control of number of rotation. The stator 86 is advantageously executed<br>
with 3-phase current winding, in doing so sinusoidal commutation of the current takes<br>
place. Preferably on the drive motor (as for example drive motor 81) designed as<br>
synchronous motor 81 and/or permanent excited motor, a sensor 106 mentioned below<br>
as for example angle of rotation sensor 106 is planned. A rotation axle of the angle of<br>
rotation sensor 106 can be assembled advantageously coaxially to the rotation axle of<br>
the rotor 84 of the motor (as for example drive motor 81).<br>
Advantageously at the drive motor (as for example drive motor 81) designed as<br>
synchronous motor 81 and/or permanent excited motor, a cooling equipment in<br>
particular a fan wheel or a liquid cooling medium circuit, is planned.<br>
Additionally on the motor (as for exampled drive motor 81) designed as synchronous<br>
motor 81 or permanent excited motor a brake equipment can be planned. The motor<br>
can also be in put in generator operation on brake equipment.<br>
Further fitting mechanism for position correct fixing between stator 86 and rotor 84<br>
may be planned.<br>
That mentioned standard for design of permanent excited synchronous motor 81 can<br>
be partly or a together transmitted to corresponding drive motors (138; 139; 140; 141;<br>
142; 143; 152; 162; 163; see below) of other rotating components (133; 135; 136; 144;<br>
145; 146; 147; 148; 153; 164; see below) different from printer cylinders 06; 07.<br>
As represented in Figure 11 not belonging to the invention as regard to the drive<br>
coupling, the print cylinders 06; 07 in advantageous execution in each case are driven<br>
through a drive motor 81. The necessary off-set in case of on- / off-setting of the<br>
nipping position is made possible herein through the coupling 82.<br>
In the execution as per Figure 11 an ink unit gear with internal drive motor (for<br>
rotation and changing movement) and in case of the moist off set, a damping unit gear<br>
with internal drive motor (rotation and changing movement) work out a variability and<br>
accuracy.<br>
As for example in Figure 11 the drive of the printer 04 on the left side is represented<br>
for the proportion of the dry off-set (with out damping unit), on the right side for the<br>
wet off-set (with damping unit). Obviously both the printers 04 however are of same<br>
type of a real double printer 03. In the front sided view due to outline reasons roller<br>
diagrams are dispensed with and only the drive pullings with motors are represented.<br>
In the plan view the drive concept on the example of an ink unit 08 with two<br>
rotationally driven changeable rollers 92 as for example friction cylinder 92 and- in<br>
case of moist off-set-as example of a damping unit 09 with a rotationally driven, not<br>
represented friction cylinder is represented.<br>
The ink unit 018 shows in each case an internal, drive motor 93 mechanically<br>
independent from tne printer cylinders 06; 07 for the rotational drive. Through this in<br>
19<br><br>
particular both the friction cylinders 92 of the ink unit 08 are driven rotationally as for<br>
example via a gear not explained here further. In the case of moist off-set (right)<br>
mainly the same is valid for the drive of damping unit 09 with a drive motor 96 and a<br>
gear 97. Per friction cylinder 92 of the ink unit 08 and per friction cylinder of the<br>
damping unit 09 a friction gear generating axially changing movement can be<br>
assembled. This can however be driven basically through an additional drive motor or<br>
else as represented can be designed as a gear converting the rotation movement to an<br>
axial movement. In Figure 11 in advantageous design the bearings are indicated as<br>
bearing unit 14 in above mentioned execution for the bearing of four cylinders 06; 07.<br>
The shafts 39 are as for example guided through corresponding cutouts / breakouts in<br>
side rack 11, 12.<br>
The coupling between rack fixed drive motor 81 and plate cylinder 07, not belonging<br>
to the invention is preferably executed for making possible a page record control/-<br>
regulation in such way that it admits also an axially relative movement between plate<br>
cylinder 07 and drive motor 81. This can likewise take place through above mentioned<br>
clutch plate coupling 82 which makes possible through deformation in the area of<br>
clutch plate an axial length change. An axial drive executed in the way represented in<br>
Figure 9 or otherwise can be planned on the other rack side, as the rotational drive.<br>
Also the driven friction cylinder 92 of the ink unit 09 can be coupled via at least one<br>
coupling balancing angle deviations, with the drive motor 93.<br>
The drive motors 93 in the ink unit 08 and/or damping unit can be designed in the way<br>
of above described permanent magnet excited drive motor 93, in particular<br>
synchronous motor 93. Dimensioning and designing however if required can differ<br>
from above.<br>
In an execution example for the drive coupling (Figure 12) as per the invention the<br>
coupling between rotation body as for example cylinder 06, 07 and drive motor 81<br>
directly takes place-that means without one coupling making possible one axial<br>
relative movement and/or without an angle-and/or coupling balancing off-set at the<br>
shaft 39. This coupling can be solid, but detachably executed. In this execution the<br>
drive motor 81 as for example is not rack fixed, rather assembled cylinder fixed and is<br>
moved along in case on-/off setting - and if required in page recording shifting - with<br>
the cylinder 06, 07. In the case of cylinders 06; 07 movable by means of a bearing<br>
assembly 14 the drive motors 81 per printer cylinder 06, 07 are not combined on the<br>
side rack 11; 12 but directly with the movable bearing block 34 solidly as for example<br>
screwed and are moved along during the position movement,<br>
Figure 12shows a design of the drive of a rotating component, in particular of the<br>
cylinders 06; 07 supported on the bearing unit 14 with a drive motor 81 designed as<br>
synchronous motor 81 and/or permanent excited motor that means designed with a<br>
section of permanent magnet 89 on the rotor 84.<br>
The stator 86 is herein as for example directly or indirectly fixed on the moving part<br>
of the bearing unit 14 as for example on movable bearing block 34 solidly and<br>
together with this is movable. In case of other type of bearing assembly 14 the stator<br>
86 as for example is rested in the interior eccentric bush or rather the lever. The parts<br>
20<br><br>
corresponding to the bearing unit 14 are not provided once more in Figure 12 with<br>
reference symbols and can be taken from Figure 6. In the example of Figure 12 the<br>
stator 86 showing the windings 91 is bolted detachably with a holding medium 98 as<br>
for example a bush 98 in particular collar bush 98 which is detachably combined as<br>
for example through bolts 99, with bearing block 34. In the present execution the<br>
motor shaft 85 carrying the permanent magnets 89 or rather the rotor 84, of the drive<br>
motor 81 is built through the shaft 39 or rather in reverse the shaft 39 through the<br>
motor shaft 85. Motor shaft 85 and rotor 84 can be designed as single piece, so that in<br>
this case the motor shaft 85 carrier the permanent magnet 89 on it's circumference. In<br>
the example, motor shaft 85 and rotor 84 are designed as two components and as for<br>
example through a tension item 101 or rather locking assembly 101 are combined<br>
rotation fixed with each other.<br>
The rotation fixed combination between shaft 39 or rather motor shaft 85 and necks<br>
21, 22 is generated here through a friction lock as for example a tensioning element<br>
102 or rather locking assembly 102.<br>
In the result rotor 84 and cylinders 06; 07 (or rather neck 21; 22) are combined with<br>
each other in axial and radial direction solidly and rotation fixed. The combination can<br>
be designed however detachable on different positions. The rotor 84 moves thus along<br>
when the cylinder 06; 07 in particular the plate cylinder 07 is moved axially or<br>
radially. The stator 86 with regard to a movement vertical to the cylinder longitudinal<br>
axle is assembled cylinder fixed and moves along in on-/ off setting movements.<br>
In contrast to the execution of the drive motor 81 out of Figure 10, here preferably<br>
between stator 86 and rotor 84 no radial bearing for opposite support is assembled.<br>
For additional support and/or anti-rotation device of the permanent excited<br>
synchronous motor 81, in particular it's stator 86, a guide 103 can be planned on<br>
which the motor slides. The guide 103 is matched to the curve shape of adjustment<br>
path of the bearing assembly 14 ("similarity") and is designed here as linear guide<br>
103. For this a rack fixed part of the guide 103 with the side rack 11, 12 and the stator<br>
86 as for example via a support 104 as for example a support plate 104 is combined<br>
with the corresponding movable part of the guide 103. The degree of freedom of<br>
linear guide must only amount to few millimeters. In the represented execution the<br>
support and/or anti-rotation device can also be dispensed with, when the bearing<br>
assembly 14 in particular the linear bearing 29 is designed sufficiently stiff and load<br>
bearing in order to take up the torque between stator 86 and rotor 84 as well as tilting<br>
torque through the weight of the stator 86 (with bush 98 etc).<br>
In preferred execution of the drive motor 81, in particular as drive for rotating<br>
component with requirement on record holding capacity in circumference direction as<br>
printer cylinders 06; 07 or cylinder of a folding machine represent (see below) the<br>
drive motor 81 is designed as angular position regulated drive motor 81. For control or<br>
rather angular position regulation a sensor 106 combined rotation fixed with the<br>
component (cylinder 06; 07) or rather the drive motor 81 as for example a sensor 106<br>
detecting the angular position, in particular an angular position provider 106 is<br>
required, over which the actual angular position, is reported back to feed back control<br>
21<br><br>
circuit. In case of a component without requirement on record maintaining (as for<br>
example ink unit 08, in taking unit, or a draw roller) however with requirement on a<br>
selectable number of rotation the sensor 106 can be executed also only as the number<br>
of rotation detecting sensor 106, in particular revolution speed transmitter. In the case<br>
lying in Figure 12 of a cylinder 06; 07, the sensor 106 can basically be assembled<br>
optionally to one component combined rotation fixed with the cylinder 06; 07 as for<br>
example also on the neck 21, 22 lying opposite to the drive motor 81. In the<br>
advantageously represented execution, the sensor 106, in particular it's rotor is<br>
assembled however co-axially to the rotation axle on the cylinder distant end of the<br>
motor shaft 85. The stator of the sensor 106 is secure via an anti rotation device 107<br>
on the stator 86 of the drive motor 81 against twisting.<br>
The anti-rotation device 107 shows in radial direction a degree of freedom, thus the<br>
stator of the sensor 106 can follow a, if required, present untrue running of the motor<br>
shaft 85 and with it of the sensor rotor. The fixing of anti-rotation device 107 takes<br>
place for this as for example via a radially running elongated hole in which a pin<br>
engages. In order to maintain angle fault resulting from an untrue running smallest<br>
possible, the anti-rotation device 107 is executed as longer lever with regard to the<br>
radial direction. The length 107 from the sensor stator to the fixing point of the anti-<br>
rotation device 107 corresponds as for example at least to one external diameter,<br>
advantageously at least the double external diameter of the sensor rotor in order to<br>
maintain small the angle if required, of a swing movement present in case of out-of-<br>
balance.<br>
In advantageous execution the drive motor 81 shows a cooling (also in application on<br>
rotating components of the printing machine different from printer cylinders 06; 07).<br>
In simple not represented execution the cooling takes place through a fan wheel.<br>
Advantageously however a liquid cooling medium circuit is planned, in which<br>
tempered cooling medium, as for example water may be guided through the drive<br>
motor 81. In Figure 12 for this connecting bores 108 in the housing of the stator 86 is<br>
planned, through which the cooling medium may be guided in cooling medium<br>
channels 109 between the housing and a carrier carrying the windings 91. In the<br>
execution represented so far for Figure 12 the drive motor 81 and it's binding and<br>
periphery (sensor 106 and/or cooling and/or anti-rotation device 107) may be planned<br>
for the cylinders 06, 07 designed as plate cylinder 07 as well as transmission cylinder<br>
06. In a special execution of the cylinder 06, 07 in particular plate cylinder 07, this<br>
shows however holding - and/or detaching medium for fixing of fittings as for<br>
example printing blocks (in particular ends of end thrust plates) which are executed<br>
workable through pressure medium. Preferably the holding - and/or detaching<br>
medium are designed self secure, so that a holding without activation of pressure<br>
medium and an opening or rather detaching takes place through charging with<br>
pressure medium.<br>
The cylinder 07 shows as for example in axial direction more number as for example<br>
four or even six holding and/or detaching media workable independent of each other<br>
for fixing or rather detaching, likewise many adjacently assembled printing blocks as<br>
for example thrust plates. In the case of endwise thrust plates, the ends of thrust plates<br>
slip in slit on the cylinder casing area and are held preferably self secure through the<br>
22<br><br>
pressure medium workable holding medium. In the design of end less printing blocks<br>
as for example printing block sleeves, as for example on the cylinder casing out let<br>
openings for the pressure medium are planned, in doing so the printing blocks 07<br>
engaging the cylinders 07 as for example are detached through charging with pressure<br>
medium.<br>
The cylinder 07 can show in circumference direction in series more number as for<br>
example two holding - and/or detaching media workable, independent of each other,<br>
for fixing or rather for detaching like wise of many printing blocks as for example<br>
pressure plates assembled serially in circumference direction. Altogether then as for<br>
example two groups to each four or six pressure plates are to be assembled on the<br>
cylinder 07. The change of pressure plates takes place however group wise, so that in<br>
a definite cylinder position in all cases the holding medium of a group of pressure<br>
plates as for example four or six must be in position to be operated.<br>
For definite supply of multiple number of holding media in the cylinder 07 with<br>
pressure medium the drive strand shows a rotation transmitter through which multiple<br>
number of supply channels may be charged with pressure medium in the cylinder 07<br>
selectively independent of each other. In an advantageous execution the rotation<br>
carrying is designed with an interface between rotating and rotation fixed component<br>
to which the pressure medium flow to be transferred runs in axial direction. For this a<br>
rotor III designed in the type of circular ring is combined rotation fixed with the<br>
cylinder 07 or rather it's neck 21; 22 which shows (Fig 13) break outs 118 going<br>
through axially through the rotor 111. The break outs 118 remain in combination with<br>
the lines 117 (dash lined) leading to the individual holding medium. The number of<br>
spatial break outs 118 separated from each other on the rotor corresponds at least to<br>
the number of total holding media to be operated independent of each other. The rotor<br>
111 works together on an axially aligned, front sided contact area with an oppositely<br>
lying axially aligned, front sided contact area of a rotation fixed stator 112 (Fig 114)<br>
which in it's front sided contact area shows out let openings 119 in the way that they<br>
may be passed depending on relative angle position between stator 112 and rotor 111,<br>
selectively in coverage with an inlet opening of a break out 118 or also depending on<br>
the position selectively in cover with inlet openings of different break outs 119. The<br>
number of out let openings 119 corresponds at least to the number of holding medium<br>
or rather pressure plates of a group of serially assembled pressure plates here as for<br>
example four. These four out let openings 119 as for example are fed via four supplies<br>
113 out of lines separated from each other, not represented which in each case<br>
selectively are chargeable with pressure.<br>
In order to seal inter faces in the selected relative position of the cylinder 07 during<br>
the charging, in advantageous execution stator 112 and rotor 111 are relatively<br>
movable to each other and are designed pressable to each other. In the present<br>
execution the stator 112 is supported axially movable on the shaft 39 and is pressable<br>
via a ring shaped punch 116 on the rotor 111. The pressing takes place as for example<br>
through charging of a ring shaped intermediate space with a pressure medium, which<br>
is charged through a corresponding connection 114. In an execution of the cylinder<br>
06, 07 as for example as transmission cylinder 06, without the requirement of a<br>
pressure medium supply, the rotation transmitter with the described components can<br>
23<br><br>
be dispensed with and if required the drive motor 81 can be designed narrower to the<br>
cylinder 06; 07.<br>
In a variant not belonging to the invention for the second execution represented in<br>
Figure 12 the stator 86 is not solidly combined with the bearing block 34 but is carried<br>
via radial bearing 88 (comparable to Figure 10) on the motor shaft 85. Here at least<br>
one anti-rotation device 103, 104 as for example in the way represented in Figure 12 is<br>
required. This can be designed stiff in axial direction of the cylinder 06, 07 when the<br>
radial bearing 88 between rotor 84 or rather motor shaft 85 and stator 86 make<br>
possible an axial relative movement. In this case the rotor 84 moves in rack fixed<br>
stator 86 axially, when the cylinder 06; 07 is moved axially. In case rotor 84 or rather<br>
motor shaft 85 and stator 86 are secure against an axial relative movement, then the<br>
device must be executed for anti-rotation device 103, 104 also making possible a<br>
degree of freedom in axial direction of the cylinder 06; 07. In this case the rotor 84<br>
moves jointly with the stator 86 axially when the cylinder 06; 07 is moved axially.<br>
Since it deals only with few millimeters this can take place in a simple execution as<br>
for example through a long lever arm that means through a long support 104 with<br>
regard to the distance to the guide 103, in doing so the small axial movement is picked<br>
up through the deformation of the support 104. In a second execution either the guide<br>
103 or the binding of the support 104 at the stator 86 can show a further linear guide,<br>
however with a degree of freedom in axial direction of the cylinder 06; 07. This can as<br>
for example take place through bolts as for example on side rack 11; 12 on movable<br>
part of the guide 103 or on stator 86 and corresponding bore or rather suspension eye<br>
on the corresponding component as for example the rack fixed part of the guide 103,<br>
the support 104 in the area of the guide 103 or the support 104 in the area of the stator<br>
86.<br>
In the execution represented in Figure 12 a part 181 carrying the winding 91, of the<br>
stator 86 is combined in axial and radial direction solidly and rotation fixed but<br>
detachable - as for example via the represented, screw connection however not<br>
described in Figure 12 - with the movable part of the bearing assembly 14 and as for<br>
example with a housing 182 of the drive motor 81. This solid combination 184 (in<br>
Figure 12 altogether represented with dashlined arrow) represents there one solid<br>
combination in particular with regard to an axial direction and can be designed solid<br>
for not movable cylinder also in radial direction with regard to the side rack 11; 12.<br>
One part 183 carrying the permanent magnet 89, of the rotor 84 is combined there<br>
with regard to an axial relative movement solidly with the cylinders 06; 07, so that<br>
with an axial movement of the cylinder 06; 07 - as for example for adjustment of the<br>
page recorder compulsorily an axial relative movement between windings 91 and<br>
permanent magnets 89 can appear.<br>
In the following (Figure 15 to Fig 18), special advantageous execution variant of the<br>
drive motor 81 is represented which with regard to an axial positioning guarantee to<br>
each other an optimal workpoint between stator 86 and rotor 84. The Figures 15 to 18<br>
are represented simplified in contrast to Figure 12 and can additionally show a<br>
rotation transmitter described above and/or a support described above and/or anti-<br>
rotation device for the drive motor 81.<br>
24<br><br>
In a design not belonging to the invention, of the drive motor 81, the stator 86 is<br>
assembled in fact rotation fixed, in axial direction however not rack - or bearing fixed,<br>
but (at least in a definite order of magnitude for the page recorder) axially movable.<br>
Relative to the side rack 11; 12 and/or to a purpose of an-/off position moving parts of<br>
a bearing assembly 14 it however designed with anti-rotation device with regard to<br>
appearing torque.<br>
A coupling between stator 86 and rotor 84 which concerns the axial movement does<br>
not take place here mechanically but as for example via magnet force. In case now as<br>
for example a rotor movable axially jointly with the cylinder 06; 07 moves axially,<br>
then via the magnetic interaction the stator may be at least partly guided along. In<br>
ideal case, this may be carried along axially in the way, that the magnets of stator and<br>
rotor can remain in the optimal working point to each other that means the stator<br>
considered relative to the rotor can remain stationary in extreme case.<br>
The axial degree of freedom of the stator 86 with regard to the side rack 11; 12 and/or<br>
the bearing assembly 14 besides the rotation fixed combination with the side rack 11;<br>
12 and/or bearing assembly 14 on the other hand (anti - rotation device) can be<br>
realized in different way. Without restriction of the generalization, in Figure 15, 16<br>
and 17 three first advantageous execution shapes are represented. Herein there exists<br>
between stator windings and side racks 11; 12 and/or bearing assembly 14 or rather<br>
holding medium 98) in axial direction to solid, but in certain limits (as for example an<br>
axial relative movement in the area of at least 1 mm that means at least ± 0.5 mm out<br>
of a medium position considered) a "soft" combination in axial direction.<br>
In contrast to Figure 12 there exists in the example of Figure 15 not belonging to the<br>
invention, no solid combination (184) between the stator 86 (or rather of the part<br>
carrying the windings 91) and the housing 182. The part of the stator 181 carrying the<br>
windings 91 is supported in the housing 182 movable axially. For this housing 182<br>
and part carrying the windings 91, of the stator 181 as for example are designed with<br>
together working slide areas 186. The guarantee of maintaining radially relative<br>
position in simultaneously making possible an axial relative movement can in<br>
principle also take place in other way than with a slide guide showing slide area 186.<br>
In this execution the housing 182 (as in Figure 12) is combined pressure -/ tension<br>
stiff and rotation fixed with the holding medium 98 that means lastly with the bearing<br>
assembly 14 and/or the side rack 11, 12. With it however the motor torque is held, the<br>
stator 86 or rather it's part 181 is combined rotation fixed with bearing assembly or<br>
rather the side rack 11, 12. This takes place as for example via one or more number<br>
anti-rotation devices 187 (as for example coupling 187) form fitting with regard to a<br>
direction of rotation, between the stator 86 or rather it's part 181 and a rack - or<br>
bearing fixed part like it represents as for example the housing 182. In Figure 15 the<br>
rotation fixed combination through one or more number stops 188 as for example<br>
bolts assembled on the stator 86, is formed which is led in guide 189 as for example<br>
bore in the housing. This can also be executed in the reverse way. The anti-rotation<br>
device 187 form fitting in rotation direction shows inside their axial movement<br>
clearance in this execution no form fitting in axial direction but as for example only<br>
one end stop.<br>
25<br><br>
The sensor 106 can be represented either as in Figure 12 or else as in Figure 15 via a<br>
holding item 191 as for example a holding device or so called box combined with the<br>
housing 182. In Figure 16 the sensor 106 is combined via the holding medium 191<br>
mainly solidly with the housing 181, an axial relative movement between the shaft 39,<br>
85 and the rotor of the sensor takes place via a rotation fixed or rather rotation stiff,<br>
coupling 192 as for example a jaw coupling admitting however an axial movement<br>
preferably via a so called clutch - disk - or all-metal coupling.<br>
In the variant to the execution not belonging to the invention, of the axially movable<br>
stator as per Figure 16 the housing 182 is not combined pressure -/ tension stiff with<br>
the bearing assembly 14 or rather the side rack, but is movable it self axially, however<br>
is guided rotation fixed. The part 181 carrying the windings 91, of the stator is<br>
combined with the housing 182 as for example solidly so that housing 182 and the<br>
stator 86 or rather the part 181 move jointly axially. The housing is assembled<br>
opposite to the bearing assembly 14 or rather to the side rack 11; 12 rotation fixed,<br>
however axially (at least in certain limits) movable. This takes place as for example<br>
again via a form fitting anti-rotation device 187. In the Figure 16 not belonging to the<br>
invention the rotation fixed combination (anti-rotation device or rather coupling 187)<br>
assembled through one or multiple number of holding media 98 is formed in stop 193.<br>
In the Figure 16 not belonging to the invention the rotation fixed combination (anti-<br>
rotation device or rather coupling 187) is formed through one or more number stops<br>
193 or rather bolts 193 acting in rotation direction, assembled on holding medium 98,<br>
which is guided in a housing fixed guide 194 as for example bore 194. The guide 194<br>
can be designed as bore in a connecting bar 196 combined firmly with the housing<br>
182. This can also be designed in reverse way. The connecting bar can be designed as<br>
collar shaped annulus, in which more number of these guides 194 (or in reverse way<br>
bolts) can be assembled. Between the parts movable axially relative to each other here<br>
a sealing 197 or other type covering can be advantageously assembled to the housing<br>
182 or rather the connecting bar 196 and the holding medium 98. Also here the form<br>
fitting anti-rotation devices 187 in direction of rotation, do not show within their axial<br>
movement clearence any form fitting in axial direction but as for example only one<br>
end stop (see as for example thickening on end of bolts 193). In the Figure 17 not<br>
belonging to the invention, the anti-rotation device 187 is designed as coupling 187<br>
basing on deformation of individual multiple-disk 201 or clutch - disk pack, as for<br>
example in the type of a multiple disk - or whole metal coupling. The part 181<br>
carrying the windings 91, of the stator or rather the housing 182 is combined via a<br>
group of at least two spring items 202 distanced in circumference direction, with the<br>
holding medium 98 or rather the bearing block 34. The spring items 202 show in each<br>
case at least two multiple disks 201 or clutch-disk pack combined at one and with<br>
each other - as for example via a spacer piece 203 - it's other ends are combined with<br>
the part 181 carrying the windings 91, of the stator or rather the housing 182 at one<br>
side and with the holding medium 97 or rather the bearing block 34 on the other side.<br>
The housing 182 or rather the stator 112 can now be relatively moved axially to the<br>
holding medium 98 or rather to the bearing block, in doing so the relative movement<br>
of the deformation of the spring item 202 is admitted. The group of spring items<br>
shows at least two of these spring items 202, which are shifted preferably around 150°<br>
to 210° in circumference direction to each other. Through here a radial shifting in axial<br>
movement is opposed. In advantageous execution - as represented in Figure 17 - a<br>
26<br><br>
second, one is assembled in axial direction to the first distanced group spring items<br>
202, in doing so again one end of spring item 202 is assembled "stator fixed" and the,<br>
other "bearing block fixed". Through here a tilting of the stator 112 or rather of the<br>
housing 182 showing the stator 112 is prevented.<br>
In the executions as per the Figures 14 to 17 the windings 91 thus infact are combined<br>
rotation fixed with the bearing block 34, however movable in axial direction of the<br>
allocated cylinder 06, 07 considered relative to the bearing block 34 (in certain limits<br>
as for example at least 1 mm, in particular at least 2 mm). The anti-rotation device 187<br>
making possible an axial relative movement between the part 181 of the stator<br>
carrying the windings 91 and the bearing block 34 represents a rotation fixed,<br>
coupling 187 admitting however an axial relative movement which with<br>
corresponding stops (as for example guide stops out of Figure 15 and 16) or as<br>
represented in Figure 17, can be designed via a rotation fixed or rather rotation stiff,<br>
however socalled multi-disk-or all-metal coupling 187 admitting an axial relative<br>
movement, with corresponding spring packs.<br>
In a likewise execution not belonging to the invention, of the drive motor 81 the stator<br>
86 is assembled in axial direction rack-or bearing fixed in doing so the part 183 of the<br>
rotor 84 as for example rotor body, carrying the magnet, at least in a definite order of<br>
magnitude relative to a cylinder fixed shaft, that means in the result is movable axially<br>
relative to the cylinder 06, 07 (Figure 18). The part 183 of the rotor 84 carrying the<br>
magnet is however with regard to transmitting torque opposite to the cylinder 06; 07<br>
or rather the shaft 34; 85 is designed rotation fixed via an anti-rotation device 199.<br>
The part 183 of the rotor 84 carrying the magnets and the shaft 39; 85 can be moved to<br>
each other as for example via slide areas or similarly working media in axial direction.<br>
The anti-rotation device 199 making possible an axial relative movement, between<br>
shafts 39; 85 and rotor body 183 can be designed either via corresponding stops (as<br>
for example in tongue and groove principle or with stops comparable to Figure 15 and<br>
16) or as represented via a rotation fixed or rather rotation stiff, coupling 199 as for<br>
example a jib coupling, admitting however an axial relative movement preferably<br>
however via a so called multi-disk-or all-metal coupling. In case now as for example<br>
the cylinder 06; 07 moves axially then the rotor 84 or rather rotor body 183 is not<br>
moved compulsorily along axially, but can remain via magnetic interaction with the<br>
stator 86 axially - in the extreme case stationary, in the way that the magnets from<br>
stator 86 and rotor 84 can remain in optimal work point to each other.<br>
The represented execution variants out of Figure 15 and 18 or rather their principle is<br>
so far transferable also on following execution example of the drive motor 81 (or<br>
rather other drive motors see below 139; 140; 141; 142; 143; 162; 163) for<br>
application. Through the drive motor 81 (or rather other) herein preferably is designed<br>
as permanent magnet excited synchronous motor, it can also have in place of<br>
permanent magnets 91 corresponding windings for electrical structure of magnet<br>
fields.<br>
In an execution not belonging to the invention for the drive of the rotating component,<br>
as for example a cylinder 06; 07 or a roller, the drive motor 81 to its rotational drive<br>
can be designed 60 as external rotor motor 81 in particular like wise with permanent<br>
27<br><br>
magnet 89 on now out side lying rotor 84 (Figure 19). The rotor 84 is now as for<br>
example combined with the casing body of the cylinder 06; 07 or structured through<br>
this. The windings 91 of the stator 86 are provided with energy as for example through<br>
electric lines 121. The sensor 106 in principle can be combined on different positions<br>
rotation fixed with the cylinders 06, 07 and/or to the rotor 84, as for example also on<br>
the other front sides of the cylinder 06; 07 and shows as for example a signal line 121<br>
for drive control. In the example it is combined with rotor 84. Stator 86 and rotor 84<br>
are supported on each other over bearing 88, here radial bearing 88. For this the radial<br>
bearing 31 in bearing block 34 of the Figure 6 or rather 7 are dispensed with. The<br>
stator 86 is combined with the bearing block 34 and together with this, in particular<br>
linear movable in the case of not movable rotating components like as for example<br>
cylinder of a folding machine or draw roller, this principle without the application of<br>
bearing unit 14 can be transmitted.<br>
Figure 20 shows likewise a variant not belonging to the invention, in doing so in<br>
particular in the case of a cylinder 07 designed as plate cylinder 07, also an axial<br>
movement will follow through the drive motor 81. For this the rotor 84 shows a<br>
section 121 fixed with permanent magnet 123 in another way. The pole of the<br>
permanent magnet 123 alternate here as example in axial direction.<br>
In contrast for this as for example the pole alternate in the section of permanent<br>
magnet 89 as for example in circumference direction (also in Figure 10, 12 and 15)<br>
planned for the rotational drive. Windings 126 different from the windings 91 are<br>
lying opposite to the section of permanent magnet 123 planned for the axial<br>
movement, which are controllable via internal signal lines 124 from a machine control<br>
for the purpose of page recording adjustment. The bearing 88 are designed here as for<br>
example as an axial relative movement making possible roller bearing 88.<br>
As it is in the case of printer cylinders 06, 07 more number of adjacently assembled<br>
rotating components in each case are to be driven through drive motor 81, and the<br>
structure size of the drive motor 81 is limited through the distances of rotation axles of<br>
the adjacent rotation body, when these overlap in relation to the distances to the<br>
allocated component. The motor size rather in particular in the design of drive motors<br>
81 as direct drive without intermediate connection of gears can be possibly greater<br>
than the component diameter as for example cylinder diameter.<br>
A first possible solution is, as schematically represented in Fig 21, the adjacent drive<br>
motor 81 as for example in the execution as per Figure 12 however are to be shifted<br>
axially such that they do not overlap in any plane lying vertical to rotation direction.<br>
For this the shafts 39 (see Fig 9) can be designed longer or intermediate shafts may be<br>
planned.<br>
In an advantageous execution, in particular in limited construction space as for<br>
example in drive of printer cylinders 06, 07 the stator 86 can be built segmented, that<br>
means out of one or more number of segments, which does not surround the full circle<br>
circumference or rather which in multiple segments in sum do not surrounded the<br>
entire circle circumference. One or more number stator segments 86', surrounded thus<br>
purely a circumference angle, which is smaller than 360°, as for example smaller than<br>
28<br><br>
300°, in particular smaller than 240 . In case two segments are planned then these can<br>
be of any advantage depending on design space in circular circumference and<br>
surround in each case a circumference angle less than 150° in particular less than 120°.<br>
The stator 86 built out of at least one stator segment 86' or rather stator segments 86'<br>
or rather the fitting with windings 91, does not reach full circumferentially but only<br>
partly around circular circumference. In advantageous design in case of two stator<br>
segments 86' these are however assembled oppositely lying that means in<br>
circumference direction equally distributed.<br>
A first execution variant not belonging to the invention of this execution to the design<br>
of the drive is shown in Figure 22 in details. Herein a working area runs between<br>
stator 86 and rotor 84 or rather a work area between the permanent magnet 89 of the<br>
rotor 84 and the windings 91 of the stator 86, parallel and as for example co-axially to<br>
the rotation axle of the cylinder 06; 07 or the rotating component. The cylinder 06, 07<br>
shows as for example in area of it's casing surface or a front sided structure the<br>
permanent magnet 89 in circumference direction. The stator 86 showing the windings<br>
91 is assembled rack fixed out side of the cylinder 06, 07 (or rather a roller), however<br>
between the both side racks 11; 12. The stator 86 carrying the windings 91 reaches<br>
only over an angle segment (see Figure 23 to 26). The permanent magnets 89 can also<br>
be assembled on a neck 21, 22 or a front sided taper of the cylinder 06; 07 or rather of<br>
the component. Since the stator 86 here is assembled on the side rack 12 (11) in case<br>
of a, if required, movable cylinder 06, 07 the shaping of the stator 86 and/or it's<br>
distance to the rotor 84 are to be considered correspondingly (see for this as for<br>
example Fig 28).<br>
The detailed principle explained in Figure 22 for the segmented stator 86 is<br>
represented with the help of Figures 23 to 26 schematically in different variants.<br>
Reference symbols for the main components are provided only in Figure 23 a and on<br>
ground of shaping and filler sample can be transmitted on remaining variants in<br>
simple way.<br>
In a first, series of variants represented in the Figures 23 and 24, it deals with<br>
assemblies of stator 86 and rotor 84, in doing so one working area lies between stator<br>
86 and rotor 84 or rather one working area between the permanent magnet 89 of the<br>
rotor 84 and the windings 91 of the stator 86 parallel and as for example co-axially to<br>
the rotation axle of the cylinder 06; 07 or rather rotating component (short: axle<br>
parallel assembly). In the Figure 25 and 26 it deals with assemblies of stator 86 and<br>
rotor 84, in doing so one working area between stator 86 and rotor 84 or rather one<br>
working area between the permanent magnet 89 of the rotor 84 and the windings 91 of<br>
the stator 86 lies vertical to the rotation axle of the cylinder 06; 07 or rather rotating<br>
component (short: axle vertical assembly).<br>
Therein in the Figures 23 and 25 it deals with variants, wherein rotor 84 and stator 86<br>
lie on the side of the side rack 12; 11 turned to the cylinders 06; 07 or rather rotating<br>
components and in Figure 24 and 26 it deals with variants wherein rotor 84 and stator<br>
86 lie on external side of the side rack 12; 11 turned away from the cylinder 06; 07 or<br>
rather rotating components. The Figures 23a, 23c and 25a represent variants belonging<br>
to the invention, under consideration of a bearing assembly 14 for the movement of<br>
29<br><br>
the cylinder 06; 07 or rather a movable component, while the Figures 23b, 23d, 24a,<br>
24b, 25b, 26a and 26b represent variants not belonging to the invention for a usual<br>
side wall bearing of the rotating component. Figure wise representation of the Figures<br>
24a and 24b under consideration of bearing assemblies 14 are dispensed with. The<br>
Figures 23a, 23b and 24a represent drive motors 81 in the design of an internal rotor<br>
motor, while Figure 23c, 23d and 24b represent external rotor motors.<br>
In the executions as per the invention, as per Figure 23a, 23c and 25a the stator 86 is<br>
assembled in each case on movable part of the bearing assembly 14, in particular on<br>
the bearing block 34.<br>
The segmented execution of the stators 86 offers various possibilities for space saving<br>
assembly, from which in Figure 27 with the help of a double printer 03 four variants<br>
on the example of the axle parallel assembly are represented. The theory is to be<br>
transmitted correspondingly to other wise executed above mentioned variants. While<br>
in Figure 27a the drives of the cylinder 06, 07 in each case have two segment type<br>
stator 86 as for example stator segments 86', in the Figures 27b to 27d to each drive<br>
only one stator segment 86' is allocated.<br>
For the case not belonging to the invention, that the stators 86 or rather stator segment<br>
86' is designed rack fixed and the rotating component, in particular the cylinder 06; 07<br>
is designed movable in a direction vertical to the rotation axle, the stator segment 86'<br>
is so executed, that one movement of the cylinder 06; 07 in the border is guaranteed<br>
(Figure 28). For this the radius of effective stator area is so selected that the air gap<br>
also in the end position of the cylinders 06; 07 is not closed. This is advantageous as<br>
for example in assemblies as per Figure 23b, 23d 24a and 24b when the bearing is<br>
designed between side rack 12; 11 and neck 22; 21 as eccentric bearing.<br>
In the input of more number of stator segments 86' per drive the windings 91 can be<br>
connected either parallel or serially and can be operated by a control equipment 127.<br>
Also a separate activation of the windings 91 out of different control equipments 127<br>
is conceivable (Fig 29). Only one sensor 106 as for example angular position provider<br>
is required which provides all control equipments 127 with the position signals of the<br>
actual - signal. The position off set of the stator segment 86' to each other can be<br>
correspondingly in parameter in the control equipment 127 or rather to the control<br>
equipment 127. A sufficiently exact relative assembly of the stator segment 86' to<br>
each other in circumference direction is required, with it the stator segments 86' do not<br>
work against each other in operation. For this, maintaining of an exactness of less than<br>
one tenth of an angle-distance of the same side of a pair of same named pole following<br>
one after the other is of advantage. As for example in case of a pole pair number of 12<br>
in over the angle of as for example 120° reaching segment 24, poles lie with respective<br>
distance of the same side of 5°. The distance of same named poles runs up then to 10°<br>
and the maximum permissible angle error to 0.1 .<br>
Also in this execution, it is advantageous, to design the stator segments 86' liquid<br>
cooled. The sensor 106 can be assembled on the rotor 84 it self, on the necks 21, 22 of<br>
the same cylinder side or on oppositely lying necks 22, 21. The design with a large<br>
pole pair number per drive, as for example 12 pole pairs is of advantage.<br>
30<br><br>
As indicated in the Figures 27, 28 and 29, in an advantageous execution the rotor 84<br>
can be designed divisible in segments. The rotor 84 is made together out then as for<br>
example in circumference direction, of multiple number (as for example three, four,<br>
six or eight) rotor segments 84' which in sum cover the full circular circumference of<br>
360° however individually can be assembled / disassembled. The covering is without<br>
gap that means there exists as for example between rotor segments 84' no significant<br>
deviation from distance pattern of the alternating pole (permanent magnets or also<br>
windings) but also a distance of a pair of rotor segments 84' amount to highest 5° in<br>
circumference direction. Through here it is specially possible, to assemble or<br>
disassemble the rotor 84, without like wise to remove the cylinders 06; 07 or rather the<br>
allocated rotating components.<br>
For the case of the design of the rotating component as roller or else, in case no<br>
construction space problem exists between adjacent cylinders 06; 07, in a fourth not<br>
represented execution shape the stator 86 carrying the windings 91, of the Figure 22 to<br>
26, can be designed not segment type rather reaching around the entire circumference<br>
of the roller or rather of the cylinder 06, 07. In the execution named to the Figure 6<br>
and 10 for the drive of a cylinder 06; 07, the drive motor 81 is designed in particular<br>
as permanent magnet excited synchronous motor 81.<br>
The coupling mentioned in Figure 12 is advantageously for a drive motor 81 designed<br>
as permanent magnet excited synchronous motor 81, is however advantageously<br>
applicable also for other wise designed drive motor 81 as for example asynchronous<br>
motor in particular with a resolution gear reducing the speed.<br>
In a further execution example for the coupling of rotating component in particular of<br>
the component executed as plate cylinder 07, as represented in Figure 30<br>
schematically, in contrast to the execution as per Figure 20 a linear drive for the axial<br>
adjustment (page recorder) is integrated in the drive motor 81. The components of the<br>
axial and the rotational drive can in principle be assembled in axial direction one after<br>
the other (as in Figure 20). In an advantageous variant these are however assembled<br>
co-axially to each other and to the motor shaft or rather the shaft 39. In Figure 30 the<br>
windings 91; 126 for the radial and the axial drive, the permanent magnet 89; 123 for<br>
the radial and the axial drive, the rotor 84 carrying permanent magnet 89; 123 as well<br>
as the stator 86 carrying the windings 91; 126 are represented.<br>
Further to this, a sensor 106 detecting the position of angle rotation, a sensor 128<br>
detecting the axial position as well as a cooling medium channel is planned. The<br>
binding can either be rack fixed via coupling 82 as represented in Figure 6 and 10 or<br>
also as indicated in an advantageous execution on bush 98 corresponding to Figure 12.<br>
In principle not represented variants are possible, in doing so the rotational drive<br>
assembled in Figure 30 externally is assembled inside and the axial drive is assembled<br>
outside. Herein the permanent magnets 89; 123 and the windings are to be exchanged.<br>
The coupling of the drive motor 81 on the cylinders 06; 07 described on the example<br>
of the printer cylinder 06; 07 shows preferably a detachable connection between necks<br>
21; 22 and shaft 39 and motor shaft 85 in such way, that the neck 21; 22 in erected<br>
31<br><br>
condition of the cylinder 06; 07 does not penetrate the side rack 11; 12. The drive<br>
connection between the cylinder 06; 07 and the, drive motor 81 assembled in<br>
particular mainly co-axially to the rotation axle of the cylinder 06; 07 is here multi<br>
part wise, that means through at least one neck 06; 07 and a shaft 39 combined with<br>
this rotation fixed but detachably, which at the same time can represent the motor<br>
shaft 85.<br>
In addition to the drives for the printer cylinders 06; 07 the printer 04 or rather double<br>
printer 03 shows as indicated in Figure 11 at least one drive for a roller 92, in<br>
particular changeable roller 92 like as for example friction cylinder 92 of the ink unit<br>
08 and/or of the damping unit 09.<br>
The drive of at least one roller 92 can as represented in Figure 11, take place through a<br>
front sided drive motor 93 via a gear 94. The drive motor 93 can be designed in<br>
principle here as asynchronous motor or synchronous motor. In an advantageous<br>
execution of the ink unit drive with regard to a direct coupling without reducing gear<br>
the drive motor 93 from Fig. 11 however can be designed as synchronous motor 93, in<br>
particular as permanent magnet excited synchronous motor 93. The gear 94 shows<br>
herein as for example no rotational reducing gear, rather only one gear converting a<br>
rotation movement to a changing movement as for example changing gear.<br>
In this first execution for the ink unit drive no internal driving motor for the<br>
generation of changing movement is planned. In Figure 11 two friction cylinders 92 in<br>
ink unit 08 are planned which as for example may be driven both rotationally and<br>
changing via a mechanical drive connection through the drive motor. In a variant only<br>
the friction cylinder 92 assembled distanced to plate cylinder 07 is driven rotationally.<br>
In a specially advantageous execution the drive motor 93 of the ink unit drive<br>
designed as permanent magnet excited synchronous motor 93, however comparable<br>
with the drive motor 81 in Figure 30 has a drive motor 93, in which rotational drive as<br>
well as axial drive are integrated. To an execution, it is referred to the schematic<br>
representation and description to the Figure 30.<br>
In Figure 31 base items of the print machine are put together, in doing so in the print<br>
units 01 the above represented drive motors 81 for the rotating components 06, 07<br>
designed as print cylinder 06, 07 are planned. Further as for example a roller changer<br>
131 has a drive motor 138 driving a material roller 144 and/or a tension roller 145 of<br>
an insertion unit 132 has a drive motor 139 and/or a tension roller 133 post assembled<br>
to the printing unit 01 has a drive motor 141 and/or a tensioning roller 136 pre<br>
assembled to a folding funnel 134 has a drive motor 142 and/or a tension roller 135<br>
post assembled to a folding funnel 134 has a drive motor 140, and/or at least one<br>
cylinder 146; 147; 148 of a folding machine 137 has a drive motor 143.<br>
The material roller 144, the tension roller 145, the tension roller 133, the tension roller<br>
135, the tension roller 136, the cylinder 146, 147, 148 represent internally driven<br>
rotating components 144; 145; 133; 135; 136; 146; 147; 148 and can be driven in the<br>
meaning of above i.v.m rotating components called print cylinder 06; 07 through the<br>
drive motors 138,139,141,140,142,143. Herein the drive motors 138; 139, 140,<br>
32<br><br>
141, 142, 143 in a mentioned way in connection with the print cylinders 06; 07 can be<br>
coupled to the allocated component 144, 145, 133, 135, 136, 146, 147, 148, in doing<br>
so however in each case the bearing assembly 14 making possible on-/off position can<br>
be dispensed with. Also possibly the angle - and/or off set balancing couple can be<br>
dispensed with.<br>
The drive motor 138, 139, 141, 140, 142, 143 driving the rotating component 144;<br>
145; 133; 135; 136; 146; 147 in advantageous execution as permanent magnet excited<br>
and/or as synchronous motor 138, 139, 141, 140, 142; 143 designed drive motor 138;<br>
139; 141; 140; 142; 143 can be designed in above described way. The axial drive<br>
planned in a few executions can herein however be dispeused with. Differences can<br>
result in nominal and in maximum torque. One or more or all these drive motors 138,<br>
139, 140, 141, 142, 143 can be designed in the type of the drive motor 81 as<br>
permanent magnet excited synchronous motor 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143.<br>
In the print units 01 and in the folding machines 137 and/or in a tension roller 145 (in<br>
the fold structure 151 or in insertion unit 132) and/or on the roller changer 138,<br>
internal drive motors 81, 138, 139, 141, 140, 142; 143 in particular can be planned as<br>
permanent magnet excited and/or as synchronous motor 81; 138; 139; 14; 140; 142;<br>
143 designed drive motors 81; 138; 139; 141; 142; 143. With regard to coupling of<br>
synchronous motor 81 iv. m Figure 19 to 26 the mentioned one - however without the<br>
bearing assembly 14 - is also transmittable on the rotating component 144, 145, 133,<br>
135, 136; 146; 147; 148, which does not require any axial movement and/or position<br>
movement vertical to rotation axle.<br>
In the Figure 31, schematically, through a dash pointed line connecting the drive<br>
motors 81; 138; 139; 140; 141; 142; 143 a drive control is indicated, which is<br>
described closer in Fig 37 below.<br>
Figure 32 shows the front view of an execution example a roller changer 131 with the<br>
motor 138 designed as synchronous motor 138, in particular with permanent magnet<br>
exciting 89 (see above) by means of which the materials roller 144 is driven and<br>
wound up. At least one of two cones 149 as for example, is driven through a such<br>
type, above described synchronous motor 138 with permanent magnets 89 on rotor 84<br>
and windings 91 on stator 86. The other cone 149, as represented, can be non-driven<br>
or like wise can show a that type drive motor 138. The cone 149 is not designed here<br>
as expandable, however can also be designed expandable.<br>
Figure 33 shows a multiple number folding funnel 134 showing a folding structure<br>
151 with tension rollers 153 driven through drive motors 152, as rotating components<br>
153. Also these drive motors 152 can be designed as described above as directly<br>
coupled synchronous motors, in particular permanent magnet excited. In addition to<br>
the tension rollers 133, 153 represented in Figure 31 and 29 also driven guide items of<br>
a super structure can have a driving motor in the type of a synchronous motor as<br>
above described in one of the executions.<br>
The drive motor 81 of the cylinder 06; 07 and/or driving motor 93 of the ink unit 08<br>
and/or driving motor 93 of the ink unit 08 and/or the drive motor of the damping unit<br>
33<br><br>
09 and/or the driving motor 143, 162 in the folding machine 137 and/or the drive<br>
motor 139,140,141,142,152,163 of a tension roller 133; 135; 136; 145; 153; 164 (in<br>
the super structure and/or in the folding structure 151 and/or at the entry of the folding<br>
machine 137) and/or the driving motor 138 of the roller changer 131 can preferably be<br>
executed in the above mentioned design of the drive motor 81 as synchronous motor<br>
81 and/or as drive motor 81 permanent magnet exciting. Herein the drive of the<br>
cylinders 06; 07 can be subjected advantageously to an angle bearing control and the<br>
drive of the tension roller 133, 135, 136, 145, 153, 164 and of roller changer 131 can<br>
be subjected to a speed regulation if required with super imposed path tension control.<br>
An activation of the drive motor 139; 140; 141; 142; 152; 163 takes place as for<br>
example advantageously over an electronic guide axle as mentioned to Figure 37.<br>
The folding machine 137 represented schematically in Figure 34 shows as for example<br>
cylinder 146, 147, 148 designed one as cutting or rather knife cylinder 146, one as<br>
transport cylinder 147 and one as folding gate cylinder 148. The transfer of the folded<br>
products can be connectingly given to an impeller 154 and from there to a delivery<br>
section 156. At least transport cylinder 147 designed as folding knife cylinder 147 can<br>
be executed format variably that means a distance AU in circumference direction<br>
between holding medium 157 and respectively post assembled folding knives 158 in<br>
circumference of the transport cylinder 147 is executed changeably. For this the<br>
holding medium 157, as for example can be executed as punctured ledge or gripper at<br>
one side and the folding knife 158 on the other side can be assembled on two different<br>
co-axially assembled drums which twist to each in circumference direction. In case<br>
the distance A U between holding medium 157 and post assembled folding knife 158<br>
reduces then a product section 161 sectioned by a strand 159 through the knife<br>
cylinder transversely in extending of the folding knife 158 to a shorter section length<br>
is transversely folded and reversed. The strand 159 can comprise one or more number<br>
long folded or unfolded paths 02 or rather part paths.<br>
Cutting, transport, fold cylinders 146; 147; 148 and if required impeller 154 are driven<br>
preferably through at least one drive motor 143 (M), in particular at least one<br>
permanent excited (synchronous) motor 143, mechanically independent of printing<br>
units, super structure as well as fold structure. The drive can take place via a gear, in<br>
particular a reducing gear, from drive motor 143 to one or more number of cylinders<br>
146, 147, 148 of the folding machine 137.<br>
In the execution represented in Figure 34 it is driven from the drive motor 143 via a<br>
not represented gear (as for example not indicated pinion or rather drive wheels) on<br>
the cutting cylinder 146 (or rather on a multiple number of cutting cylinders). From<br>
the last one it is driven on the transport cylinder 147 and from this on fold gate<br>
cylinder 148. From the fold gate cylinder 148 if required, it can be driven via a belt<br>
drive on the impeller 154.<br>
In a not represented variant it is driven from the drive motor 143 via a pinion or drive<br>
wheel on the transport cylinder 147. It is driven from the last one on the cutting<br>
cylinder 146 and fold gate cylinder 148. It is driven on the impeller 154 from the fold<br>
gate cylinder 148 as for example again via the belt drive. In both the described cases<br>
34<br><br>
the delivery 156 has preferably an internal drive motor 162 (M) mechanically<br>
independent from the cylinders 146,147,148 and the impeller 154.<br>
Cutting, - transport, and fold gate cylinder 146, 147, 148 and if required impeller 154<br>
can also be driven mechanically independent of each other and from the printers 04<br>
through internal drive motors 143, 162 (M) (Figure 35). In a variant (Figure 36) the<br>
three cylinders 146, 147, 148 are jointly and impeller 154 as well as delivery 156<br>
individually driven.<br>
In another drive execution, cutting, - transport and fold gate cylinder 146, 147, 148 are<br>
driven at least through one joint or alternatively through each one drive motor 143<br>
mechanically independent from the printer, while in a first variant impeller 154 and<br>
delivery device 156 are driven rotationally through a joint drive motor mechanically<br>
independent of the cylinders 146, 147, 148 and of the print 04 and in a second variant<br>
in each case through internal drive motors 143, 162 (M).<br>
Also one, if required planned tape system for guiding to the product section 161 in<br>
which and through which folding machine 137 can be driven through an internal drive<br>
motor 162 (M) mechanically independent of the cylinders 146; 147; 148.<br>
The mentioned drive motors 143; 162 (M) as represented above can be designed<br>
advantageously as permanent magnet excited synchronous motors 143; 162 (M).<br>
In the entry area of the folding machine 137 a like wise tension roller 164 driven<br>
through a drive motor 163, as for example a permanent magnet excited, can be<br>
assembled as rotating component 164.<br>
In fact the drive controls described in the following basically also independent of the<br>
specially above described design of the drive motors 81, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143,<br>
162, 163 and of special linear bearing of the cylinders 06, 07 is of advantage.<br>
Specially the drive control; however is of advantage for the directly driven component<br>
in above mentioned executions.<br>
Figure 37 shows an example for the drive of a printing machine with multiple number,<br>
here as example two, printing units 01 executed as printing column 01 which show in<br>
each case multiple number of printers 04, here double printer 03. The printers 04 of a<br>
printing column 01 form together with their drive regulators 166, shortly drives 166<br>
and the drive motors 81, 93 a group 167, as for example drive motor 167 in particular<br>
a print position group 167 which via a sub assembled drive control 168 of this group<br>
167	is combined with a signal of a respective guide axle position 0 of virtually a<br>
guide axle guiding first signal line 171. The sub assembled drive control 168 can<br>
however also control sub groups of printing units 01 or other divisions. With this<br>
signal line 171 also further, units, showing an internally sub assembled drive control<br>
168	as for example one or more number control items (as for example tension roller<br>
133, 153, Figure 31, 33) of a super structure and/or folding structure 151 and/or of one<br>
or more number folding machinery 137 are combined. In the same way possible<br>
combinations to the roller changer 131  and to the insertion unit 132 are not<br>
represented here. The signal line 171 is here executed advantageously as a first<br>
35<br><br>
network 171 in ring topology, in particular as sercos-ring which the guide axle<br>
position 0 receives through the coordinated control 172 combined with the network<br>
171. This generates the circulating guide axle position 0 on the basis of preset values<br>
with regard to a preset production speed, which it receives from a computer and/or<br>
data processing unit 173 as for example a section computer. The computer and data<br>
processing unit 173 receives from their side the preset value of the production speed<br>
from a control position 174 or rather guide position computer 174 combined with it.<br>
In order to guarantee record holding prints and/or longitudinal cutting the<br>
mechanically independent from each other driven aggregates (printer 04 as well as<br>
folding machine 137), as for example depending on path guiding must stand to each<br>
other in correct angle position. Further for the drives 166 requiring individual record<br>
holding, off set values A 0 are reserved, which for the production define the correct<br>
relative angle position for joint guide axle and/or relative to one of the aggregates. At<br>
least this aggregate (print unit 04, as well as folding machinery 137) or rather their<br>
drives 166 are subjected to an angle bearing position. Other aggregates leading the<br>
path 02 like tension rollers 183, 135, 136 and/or roller changers 131 must not in any<br>
case be operated angle position regulated rather can be subjected to a control of<br>
number of rotations.<br>
The off set values A0 relevant for the individual for the individual drives 166 (at<br>
least for drive 166 with record requirement) for the respective production from the<br>
computer - and data processing item 173 via a second, signal line 176 different from<br>
first signal line 171, in particular a second network 176 are transmitted to sub<br>
assembled drive control 168 allocated to the respective drive 166 and in advantageous<br>
execution are stored there and processed with the guide axle position 0 to corrected<br>
control axle positions 0'.<br>
The communication of the offset value A0 on the sub assembled drive controls 168<br>
takes place as for example either via corresponding signal lines from the second<br>
network 176 directly for the drive control 168 (not represented) or advantageously via<br>
a control system 177 which is allocated to the respective group 167 or rather the unit<br>
showing an internal sub assembled drive control 168. The control system 177 is for<br>
this combined with the second network 176 (or rather with the computer and data<br>
processing unit 173). The control system 177 controls and/or regulates as for example<br>
the positioning elements different from the drive motor 81, 93 and drives of printer 04<br>
or rather folding machine 137 as for example ink supply, position movement from<br>
rollers and/or cylinders, damping units, positions etc. The control system 177 shows<br>
one or more number of (in particular store programmable) control units 178. This<br>
control unit 178 is combined via a signal line 179 with the sub assembled drive<br>
control 168. In case of multiple number control units 178 these are combined among<br>
each other through the signal line 179 as for example a Bus system 179. Via the first<br>
network 171 the drives 166 receive thus the absolute and dynamic information for<br>
circulation of a joint guide axle position 0 lying at the base and via a second signal<br>
path, in particular via at least one second network 176, the informations required for<br>
record meeting processing, in particular off set values A 0 are communicated for the<br>
record meeting relative position of the drives 166 or rather aggregates independent of<br>
each other mechanically.<br>
36<br><br>
The advantageous features as for example of a printing machine with existing double<br>
printers 03 (bearing assembly 14, drive coupling, motor execution as permanent<br>
magnet excited synchronous motor) are individually or in combination like wise are to<br>
be applied on printing units, that means mainly around 90° rotated double printers 03.<br>
Also the features of bearing assembly 14 and/or of the linear actuator travel and/or<br>
drive coupling, motor execution are to be applied also on nine-or ten cylinder satellite<br>
printing units individually or in combination.<br>
