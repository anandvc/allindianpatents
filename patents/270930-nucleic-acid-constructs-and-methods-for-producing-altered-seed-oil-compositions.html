FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to recombinant nucleic acid molecules, constructs, and other agents associated with the coordinate manipulation of multiple genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. In particular, the agents of the present invention are associated with the simultaneous enhanced expression of certain genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway and suppressed expression of certain other genes in the same pathway. The present invention is also directed to plants incorporating such agents, and in particular to plants incorporating such constructs where the plants exhibit altered seed oil compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Plant oils are used in a variety of applications. Novel vegetable oil compositions and improved approaches to obtain oil compositions, from biosynthetic or natural plant sources, are needed. Depending upon the intended oil use, various different fatty acid compositions are desired. Plants, especially species which synthesize large amounts of oils in seeds, are an important source of oils both for edible and industrial uses. Seed oils are composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols in which fatty acids are esterified to the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol.<br>
Soybean oil typically contains about 16-20% saturated fatty acids: 13-16% palmitate and 3-4% stearate. See generally Gunstone et al, The Lipid Handbook, Chapman &amp; Hall, London (1994). Soybean oils have been modified by various breeding methods to create benefits for specific markets. However, a soybean oil that is broadly beneficial to major soybean oil users such as consumers of salad oil, cooking oil and frying oil, and industrial markets such as biodiesel and biolube markets, is not available. Prior soybean oils were either too expensive or lacked an important food quality property such as oxidative stability, good fried food flavor or saturated fat content, or an important biodiesel property such as appropriate nitric oxide emissions or cold tolerance or cold flow.<br>
Higher plants synthesize fatty acids via a common metabolic pathway ~ the fatty acid synthetase (FAS) pathway, which is located in the plastids. (3-ketoacyl-ACP synthases are important rate-limiting enzymes in the FAS of plant cells and exist in several versions. p-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I catalyzes chain elongation to palmitoyl-ACP (CI6:0), whereas (3-ketoacyI-ACP synthase II catalyzes chain elongation to stearoyl-ACP (CI8:0). ร-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV is a variant of P-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, and can also catalyze chain elongation to 18:0-ACP. In soybean, the major products of FAS are 16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP. The desaturation of 18:0-ACP to form 18:1 -ACP is catalyzed by a plastid-localized soluble delta-9 desaturase (also referred to as "stearoyl-ACP desaturase")-See Voelker et al, 52 Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 335-61 (2001).<br>
The products of the plastidial FAS and delta-9 desaturase, 16:0-ACP, 18:0-ACP, and 18:1-ACP, are hydrolyzed by specific thioesterases (FAT). Plant thioesterases can be<br>
classified into two gene families based on sequence homology and substrate preference. The first family, FATA, includes long chain acyl-ACP thioesterases having activity primarily on 18:1-ACP. Enzymes of the second family, FATB, commonly utilize 16:0-ACP (palmitoyl-ACP), 18:0-ACP (stearoyl-ACP), and 18:1-ACP (oleoyl-ACP). Such thioesterases have an important role in determining chain length during de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in plants, and thus these enzymes are useful in the provision of various modifications of fatty acyl compositions, particularly with respect to the relative proportions of various fatty acyl groups that are present in seed storage oils.<br>
The products of the FATA and FATB reactions, the free fatty acids, leave the plastids and are converted to their respective acyl-CoA esters. Acyl-CoAs are substrates for the lipid-biosynthesis pathway (Kennedy Pathway), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is responsible for membrane lipid formation as well as the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols, which constitute the seed oil. In the ER there are additional membrane-bound desaturases, which can further desaturate 18:1 to polyunsaturated fatty acids. A delta-12 desaturase (FAD2) catalyzes the insertion of a double bond into 18:1, forming linoleic acid (18:2). A delta-15 desaturase (FAD3) catalyzes the insertion of a double bond into 18:2, forming linolenic acid (18:3).<br>
Many complex biochemical pathways have now been manipulated genetically, usually by suppression or over-expression of single genes. Further exploitation of the potential for plant genetic manipulation will require the coordinate manipulation of multiple genes in a pathway. A number of approaches have been used to combine transgenes in one plant - including sexual crossing, retransformation, co-transformation, and the use of linked transgenes. A chimeric transgene with linked partial gene sequences can be used to coordinately suppress numerous plant endogenous genes. Constructs modeled on viral polyproteins can be used to simultaneously introduce multiple coding genes into plant cells. For a review, see Halpin et al, Plant Mol. Biol. 47:295-310 (2001).<br>
Thus, a desired plant phenotype may require the expression of one or more genes and the concurrent reduction of expression of another gene or genes. Thus, there exists a need to simultaneously over-express one or more genes and suppress, or down-regulate, the expression of a another gene or genes in plants using a single transgenic construct.<br>

"CTP" refers to a chloroplastic transit peptide, encoded by the "chloroplastic transit peptide coding sequence".<br>
When referring to proteins and nucleic acids herein, "derived" refers to either directly (for example, by looking at the sequence of a known protein or nucleic acid and preparing a protein or nucleic acid having a sequence similar, at least in part, to the sequence of the known protein or nucleic acid) or indirectly (for example, by obtaining a protein or nucleic acid from an organism which is related to a known protein or nucleic acid) obtaining a protein or nucleic acid from a known protein or nucleic acid. Other methods of "deriving" a protein or nucleic acid from a known protein or nucleic acid are known to one of skill in the art.<br>
Double-stranded RNA ("dsRNA"), double-stranded RNA interference ("dsRNAi") and RNA interference ("RNAi") all refer to gene-specific silencing that is induced by the<br>
introduction of a construct capable of transcribing an at least partially double-stranded RNA molecule. A "dsRNA molecule" and an "RNAi molecule" both refer to a region of an RNA molecule containing segments with complementary nucleotide sequences and therefore can hybridize with each other and form double-stranded RNA. Such double-stranded RNA molecules are capable, when introduced into a cell or organism, of at least partially reducing the level of an mRNA species present in a cell or a cell of an organism. In addition, the dsRNA can be created after assembly in vivo of appropriate DNA fragments through illegitimate recombination and site-specific recombination as described in International Application No. PCT/US2005/004681, filed on February 11, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>

A cell or organism can have a family of more than one gene encoding a particular enzyme, and the capital letter that follows the gene terminology (A, B, C) is used to designate the family member, i.e., FAD2-1A is a different gene family member from FAD2-1B.<br>
As used herein, any range set forth is inclusive of the end points of the range unless otherwise stated.<br>
A.        Agents<br>
The agents of the invention will preferably be "biologically active" with respect to either a structural attribute, such as the capacity of a nucleic acid molecule to hybridize to another nucleic acid molecule, or the ability of a protein to be bound by an antibody (or to compete with another molecule for such binding). Alternatively, such an attribute may be catalytic and thus involve the capacity of the agent to mediate a chemical reaction or response. The agents will preferably be "substantially purified." The term "substantially purified," as used herein, refers to a molecule separated from substantially all other molecules normally associated with it in its native environmental conditions. More preferably a substantially purified molecule is the predominant species present in a preparation. A substantially purified molecule may be greater than 60% free, greater than 75% free, preferably greater than 90% free, and most preferably greater than 95% free from the other molecules (exclusive of solvent) present in the natural mixture. The term "substantially purified" is not intended to encompass molecules present in their native environmental conditions.<br>
The agents of the invention may also be recombinant. As used herein, the term "recombinant" means any agent (e.g., including but not limited to DNA or peptide), that is, or results, however indirectly, from human manipulation of a nucleic acid molecule. It is also understood that the agents of the invention may be labeled with reagents that facilitate detection of the agent, e.g., fluorescent labels, chemical labels, and/or modified bases.<br>
Agents of the invention include DNA molecules that have a nucleotide sequence which is capable of being transcribed in sense- and antisense-orientations that form at least one RNA molecule that is, at least in part, double-stranded. In a preferred embodiment, an agent of the invention is a double-stranded RNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that is a fragment of FAD2, FATB, or FAD2 and FATB. In another embodiment, an agent of the present invention is a DNA molecule capable of being transcribed to produce sense-and antisense-orientations of a nucleotide sequence in a host cell. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule can have a nucleotide sequence in a sense orientation and in an antisense orientation, or in another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule can have a<br>
nucleotide sequence in a sense orientation or an antisense orientation. Such nucleotide sequences can be operably linking to the same promoter, different promoters, a single promoter, or more than one promoter. Such nucleotide sequences can be on a single DNA molecule or more than one DNA molecule.<br>
Agents of the invention include nucleic acid molecules that comprise a DNA sequence which is at least 50%, 60%, or 70% identical over their entire length to a plant coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a plant coding or non-coding region. More preferable are DNA sequences that are, over their entire length, at least 80% identical; at least 85% identical; at least 90% identical; at least 95% identical; at least 97% identical; at least 98% identical; at least 99% identical; or 100% identical to a plant coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a plant coding or non-coding region.<br>
"Identity," as is well understood in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more nucleic acid molecule sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, "identity" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. "Identity" can be readily calculated by known methods including, but not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, ed., Oxford University Press, New York 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, ed., Academic Press, New York 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin and Griffin, eds., Humana Press, New Jersey 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, Academic Press 1987; Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov and Devereux, eds., Stockton Press, New York 1991; and Carillo and Lipman, SIAMJ. Applied Math, 48:1073 1988.<br>
Methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine identity are codified in publicly available programs. Computer programs which can be used to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG; a suite of five BLAST programs, three designed for nucleotide sequences queries (BLASTN, BLASTX, and TBLASTX) and two<br>
designed for protein sequence queries (BLASTP and TBLASTN). The BLASTX program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources, e.g., BLAST Manual, Altschul et al, NCBINLM NIH, Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul et al, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm can also be used to determine identity.<br>
Parameters for polypeptide sequence comparison typically include the following: Algorithm: Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453 (1970); Comparison matrix: BLOSSUM62 from Hentikoff and Hentikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-10919 (1992); Gap Penalty: 12; Gap Length Penalty: 4. A program that can be used with these parameters is publicly available as the "gap" program from Genetics Computer Group ("GCG"), Madison, Wisconsin. The above parameters along with no penalty for end gap are the default parameters for peptide comparisons.<br>
Parameters for nucleic acid molecule sequence comparison include the following: Algorithm: Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Bio. 48:443-453 (1970); Comparison matrix: matches - +10; mismatches = 0; Gap Penalty: 50; Gap Length Penalty: 3. As used herein, "% identity" is determined using the above parameters as the default parameters for nucleic acid molecule sequence comparisons and the "gap" program from GCG, version 10.2.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, a FATB fragment is derived from one-half of the total nucleotides in FATB starting at the 5' end. For all of these FATB fragments, the truncation or deletion can start at the 5' end, start at the 3' end, or be internal to FATB. In a preferred embodiment, a. FATB fragment is derived from one-half of the total nucleotides in FATB starting at the 5' end of FATB, is derived from one-third of the total nucleotides in FATB that are closest to the 5' end. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a FATB fragment contains a transit peptide encoding sequence, which preferably encodes for the chloroplast transit peptide.

By suppressing, at least partially reducing, reducing, substantially reducing, or effectively eliminating the expression of at least one or more endogenous genes, the amount of FAD2 and/or FAD3 available in a plant cell is decreased, i.e. the steady-state levels of the protein are reduced, and a decreased percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleate (CI8:2) and linolenate (CI8:3) may be provided. Modifications in the pool of fatty acids available for incorporation into triacylglycerols may likewise affect the composition of oils in the plant cell. Thus, a decrease in expression of FAD2 and/or FAD3 may result in an increased proportion of mono-unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (CI 8:1). When the amount of FATB is decreased in a plant cell, a decreased amount of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate and stearate may be provided. Thus, a decrease in expression of FATB may result in an increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (18:1). The simultaneous suppression of FAD2, FAD3, and FATB expression thereby results in driving the FAS pathway toward an overall increase in mono-unsaturated fatty acids of 18-carbon length, such as oleate (CI 8:1). See U.S. Patent No. 5,955,650.<br>
By increasing the amount of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KAS I) and/or beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV (KAS PV) available in a plant cell, a decreased percentage of 16:0-ACP may be provided, leading to an increased percentage of 18:0-ACP. A greater amount of 18:0-ACP in combination with the simultaneous suppression of one or more of<br>
FAD2, FAD3, and FATB, thereby helps drive the oil composition toward an overall increase in oleate (CI 8:1). By increasing the amount of delta-9 desaturase available in a plant cell, an increased percentage of unsaturated fatty acids may be provided, resulting in an overall lowering of stearate and total saturates.<br>
These combinations of increased and decreased enzyme expression may be manipulated to produce oil compositions, including fatty acids, having an increased oleate level, decreased linoleate, linolenate, stearate, and/or palmitate levels, and a decreased overall level of saturates. Enhancement of gene expression in plants may occur through the introduction of extra copies of coding sequences of the genes into the plant cell or, preferably, the incorporation of extra copies of coding sequences of the gene into the plant genome. Over-expression may also occur though increasing the activities of the regulatory mechanisms that regulate the expression of genes, i.e., up-regulation of the gene expression.<br>
Production of CP4 EPSPS in a plant cell provides the plant cell with resistance or tolerance to glyphosate, thereby providing a convenient method for identification of successful transformants via glyphosate-tolerant selection.<br>
Suppression of gene expression in plants, also known as gene silencing, occurs at both the transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level. There are various methods for the suppression of expression of endogenous sequences in a host cell, including, but not limited to, antisense suppression, co-suppression, ribozymes, combinations of sense and antisense (double-stranded RNAi), promoter silencing, and DNA binding proteins such as zinc finger proteins. (See, e.g., WO 98/53083, WO 01/14538, and U.S. Patent 5,759,829 (Shewmaker.)). Certain of these mechanisms are associated with nucleic acid homology at the DNA or RNA level. Such homology refers to similarity in DNA or protein sequences within the same species or among different species. Gene silencing occurs if the DNA sequence introduced to a host cell is sufficiently homologous to an endogenous gene that transcription of the introduced DNA sequence will induce transcriptional or post transcriptional gene silencing of the endogenous gene. Sufficient homology for suppression of steady state expression levels may be at least 50%, about 60%, or about 70% identical over the entire length of a DNA sequence to a plant coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a plant coding or non-coding region. More preferable are DNA sequences that are, over their entire length, at least 80% identical; at least 85% identical; at least 90% identical; at least 95% identical; at least 97% identical; at least 98% identical; at least 99% identical; or 100% identical to a<br>
plant coding region or non-coding region, or to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a plant coding or non-coding region. In plants, double-stranded RNA molecules can induce sequence-specific silencing. Gene silencing was often referred to as double-stranded RNA ("dsRNAi") in plants, as RNA interference or RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans and in animals, and as quelling in fungi.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a first set of DNA sequences, each of which exhibits sufficient homology to one or more coding or non-coding sequences of a plant gene such that when it is expressed, it is capable of effectively eliminating, substantially reducing, or at least partially reducing the level of an mRNA transcript or protein encoded by the gene from which the coding or non-coding sequence was derived, or any gene which has homology to the target coding or non-coding sequence.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises (a) a first set of DNA sequences, each of which exhibits sufficient homology to one or more coding or non-coding sequences of a plant gene such that when it is expressed, it is capable of effectively eliminating, substantially reducing, or at least partially reducing the level of an mRNA transcript or protein encoded by the gene from which the coding or non-coding sequence was derived, or any gene which has homology to the target non-coding sequence, and (b) a second set of DNA sequences, each of which exhibits sufficient homology to a plant gene so that when it is expressed, it is capable of at least partially enhancing, increasing, enhancing, or substantially enhancing the level of an mRNA transcript or protein encoded by the gene.<br>
As used herein, "a set" of DNA sequences can be one or more sequences, which either code or do not code for a protein. For example, a first set of DNA sequences can be composed of only a promoter, a non-coding region, and a terminator. A second set of DNA sequences can or can not be present after or before a first set of DNA sequences.<br>
As used herein, "a reduction" of the level or amount of an agent such as a protein or mRNA means that the level or amount is reduced relative to a cell or organism lacking a DNA sequence capable of reducing the agent. For example, "at least a partial reduction"<br>
refers to a reduction of at least 25%, "a substantial reduction" refers to a reduction of at least 75%, and "an effective elimination" refers to a reduction of greater than 95%, all of which reductions in the level or amount of the agent are relative to a cell or organism lacking a DNA sequence capable of reducing the agent.<br>
As used herein, "an enhanced" or "increased" level or amount of an agent such as a protein or mRNA means that the level or amount is higher than the level or amount of agent present in a cell, tissue or plant with a similar genetic background but lacking an introduced nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein or mRNA. For example, an "at least partially enhanced" level refers to an increase of at least 25%, and a "substantially enhanced" level refers to an increase of at least 100%, all of which increases in the level or amount of an agent are relative to the level or amount of agent that is present in a cell, tissue or plant with a similar genetic background but lacking an introduced nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein or mRNA. In a preferred embodiment, an increase in expression may be any expression where the protein is heterologous to the system. For example, any expression of CP4 EPSPS can be an increase in expression if there was no expression in the plant prior to the introduction of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein.<br>
When levels of an agent are compared, such a comparison is preferably carried out between organisms with a similar genetic background. Preferably, a similar genetic background is a background where the organisms being compared share 50% or greater, more preferably 75% or greater, and, even more preferably 90% or greater sequence identity of nuclear genetic material. In another preferred aspect, a similar genetic background is a background where the organisms being compared are plants, and the plants are isogenic except for any genetic material originally introduced using plant transformation techniques. Measurement of the level or amount of an agent may be carried out by any suitable method, non-limiting examples of which include comparison of mRNA transcript levels, protein or peptide levels, and/or phenotype, especially oil content. As used herein, mRNA transcripts include processed and non-processed mRNA transcripts, and proteins or peptides include proteins or peptides with or without any post-translational modification.<br>
The DNA sequences of the first set of DNA sequences may be coding sequences, intron sequences, 3'UTR sequences, 5'UTR sequences, promoter sequences, other non-coding sequences, or any combination of the foregoing. The first set of DNA sequences encodes one or more sequences which, when expressed, are capable of selectively reducing either or both the protein and the transcript encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2, FAD3, and FATB. In a preferred embodiment, the first set of DNA sequences is capable of expressing antisense RNA, in which the individual antisense sequences may be linked in one transcript, or may be in unlinked individual transcripts. In a further preferred embodiment, the first set of DNA sequences are physically linked sequences which are capable of expressing a single dsRNA molecule. In a different preferred embodiment, the first set of DNA sequences is capable of expressing sense cosuppresion RNA, in which the individual sense sequences may be linked in one transcript, or may be in unlinked individual transcripts. Exemplary embodiments of the first set of DNA sequences are described in Part B of the Detailed Description, and in the Examples.<br>
The second set of DNA sequences encodes one or more sequences which, when expressed, are capable of increasing one or both of the protein and transcript encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I {KAS I), beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV {KAS IV), delta-9 desaturase, and CP4 EPSPS. The DNA sequences of the second set of DNA sequences may be physically linked sequences. Exemplary embodiments of the second set of DNA sequences are described below in Parts C and D of the Detailed Description.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides methods for altering the composition of fatty acids and compounds containing such fatty acids, such as oils, waxes, and fats.

A preferred organ is a seed. For example, exogenous genetic material may be transferred into a plant cell and the plant cell regenerated into a whole, fertile or sterile plant or plant part.<br>
"Exogenous genetic material" is any genetic material, whether naturally occurring or otherwise, from any source that is capable of being inserted into any organism. Such exogenous genetic material includes, without limitation, nucleic acid molecules and constructs of the present invention. Exogenous genetic material may be transferred into a host cell by the use of a DNA vector or construct designed for such a purpose. Similarly, a virus can transfer exogenous genetic material into a host cell. Exogenous genetic material may have a DNA sequence identical to the endogenous gene, but have been re-introduced to the host cell by the use of a DNA vector or construct for the purpose of suppressing expression of the endogenous gene. Design of such a vector is generally within the skill of the art (See, e.g., Plant Molecular Biology: A Laboratory Manual, Clark (ed.), Springer, New York (1997)). In a preferred embodiment, exogenous genetic material is recombinant DNA.<br>
A construct or vector may include a promoter functional in a plant cell, or a plant promoter, to express a nucleic acid molecule of choice. A number of promoters that are active in plant cells have been described in the literature, and the CaMV 35S and FMV<br>
promoters are preferred for use in plants. Other examples of preferred promoters include bean arcelin and 7S alpha.

Nucleic acid molecules that may be used in plant transformation or transfection may be any of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to the illustrated embodiments. Exemplary nucleic acid molecules have been described in Part A of the Detailed Description, and further non-limiting exemplary nucleic acid molecules are described below and illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, and in the Examples.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, embodiments of the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention are shown in FIGS. 1-4. As described above, the nucleic acid molecule comprises (a) a first set of DNA sequences and (b) a second set of DNA sequences, which are located on one or more T-DNA regions, each of which is flanked by a right border and<br>
a left border. Within the T-DNA regions the direction of transcription is shown by arrows. The nucleic acid molecules described may have their DNA sequences arranged in monocistronic or polycistronic configurations. Preferred configurations include a configuration in which the first set of DNA sequences and the second set of DNA sequences are located on a single T-DNA region.<br>
In each of the illustrated embodiments, the first set of DNA sequences comprises one or more sequences which when expressed are capable of selectively reducing one, two or all of the proteins and transcripts encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2, FADS, and FATB. Preferably each sequence in the first set of DNA sequences is capable, when expressed, of suppressing the expression of a different gene, including without limitation different gene family members. The sequences may include coding sequences, intron sequences, 3 'UTR sequences, 5 'UTR sequences, other non-coding sequences, or any combination of the foregoing. The first set of DNA sequences may be expressed in any suitable form, including as a dsRNA construct, a sense cosuppression construct, or as an antisense construct. The first set of DNA sequences is operably linked to at least one promoter which drives expression of the sequences, which can be any promoter functional in a plant, or any plant promoter. Preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, a napin promoter, a 7Sฮฑ promoter, a 7Sฮฑ' promoter, an arcelin promoter, or a FAD2-1A promoter.<br>
The second set of DNA sequences comprises coding sequences, each of which is a DNA sequence that encodes a sequence that when expressed is capable of increasing one or both of the protein and transcript encoded by a gene selected from the group consisting of KAS I, KAS IV, delta-9 desaturase, and CP4 EPSPS. Each coding sequence is associated with a promoter, which can be any promoter functional in a plant, or any plant promoter. Preferred promoters for use in the second set of DNA sequences are an FMV promoter and/or seed-specific promoters. Particularly preferred seed-specific promoters include, but are not limited to, a napin promoter, a 7Sฮฑ promoter, a 7Sฮฑ' promoter, an arcelin promoter, a delta-9 desaturase promoter, or a FAD2-1A promoter.<br>
In the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the first set of DNA sequences, when expressed, is capable of forming a dsRNA molecule that is capable of suppressing the expression of one or both of the protein and transcript encoded by, or transcribed from, a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2, FADS, and FATB. The first set of DNA sequences depicted in FIG. 1 comprises three non-coding sequences, each of which expresses an RNA sequence (not shown) that exhibits identity to a non-coding region of a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2, FADS, and FATB genes. The non-coding sequences each express an RNA sequence that exhibits at least 90% identity to a non-coding region of a gene selected from the group consisting of FAD2, FADS, and FATB genes. The first set of DNA sequences also comprises three antisense sequences, each of which expresses an antisense RNA sequence (not shown) that is capable of forming a double-stranded RNA molecule with its respective corresponding RNA sequence (as expressed by the non-coding sequences).<br>
The non-coding sequences may be separated from the antisense sequences by a spacer sequence, preferably one that promotes the formation of a dsRNA molecule. Examples of such spacer sequences include those set forth in Wesley et al., Plant J., 27(6):581-90 (2001), and Hamilton et al, Plant J., 15:131-146 (1988). In a preferred aspect, the spacer sequence is capable of forming a hairpin structure as illustrated in Wesley et al., supra. Particularly preferred spacer sequences in this context are plant introns or parts thereof. A particularly preferred plant intron is a spliceable intron. Spliceable introns include, but are not limited to, an intron selected from the group consisting of PDK intron, FAD3-1A or FADS-IB intron #5, FADS intron #1, FADS intron #3A, FADS intron #3B, FADS intron #3C, FADS intron #4, FADS intron #5, FAD2 intron # 1, and FAD2-2 intron. Preferred spliceable introns include, but are not limited to, an intron selected from the group consisting of FADS intron #1, FADS intron #3A, FADS intron #3B, FADS intron #3C, and FADS intron #5. Other preferred spliceable introns include, but are not limited to, a spliceable intron that is about 0.75 kb to about 1.1 kb in length and is capable of facilitating an RNA hairpin structure. One non-limiting example of a particularly preferred spliceable intron is FADS intron #5.<br>
The sense-oriented, non-coding molecules may be optionally separated from the corresponding antisense-oriented molecules by a spacer segment of DNA. The spacer segment can be a gene fragment or artificial DNA. The spacer segment can be short to facilitate forming hairpin dsRNA or long to facilitate dsRNA without a hairpin structure. The spacer can be provided by extending the length of one of the sense or antisense molecules as disclosed in US 2005/0176670 Al. Alternatively, a right-border-right-border ("RB-RB") sequence can be created after insertion into the plant genome as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2005/0183170.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, the nucleic acid molecule comprises two T-DNA regions, each of which is flanked by a right border and a left border. The first T-DNA region comprises the first set of DNA sequences that is operably linked to a promoter, and the first T-DNA region further comprises a first part of the second set of DNA sequences that comprises a first promoter operably linked to a first coding sequence, and a second promoter operably linked to a second coding sequence. The second T-DNA region comprises a second part of the second set of DNA sequences that comprises a third promoter operably linked to a third coding sequence. In a preferred embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a single T-DNA region, which is flanked by a right border and a left border. The first and second sets of DNA sequences are all located on the single T-DNA region.<br>
In the dsRNA-expressing embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the order of the sequences may be altered from that illustrated and described, however the non-coding sequences and the antisense sequences preferably are arranged around the spacer sequence such that, when expressed, the first non-coding sequence can hybridize to the first antisense sequence, the second non-coding sequence can hybridize to the second antisense sequence, and the third non-coding sequence can hybridize to the third antisense sequence such that a single dsRNA molecule can be formed. Preferably the non-coding sequences are in a sense orientation, and the antisense sequences are in an antisense orientation relative to the promoter. The numbers of non-coding, antisense, and coding sequences, and the various relative positions thereof on the T-DNA region(s) may also be altered in any manner suitable for achieving the goals of the present invention.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the illustrated nucleic acid molecule comprises a T-DNA region flanked by a right border and a left border, on which are located the first and second sets of DNA sequences. The first set of DNA sequences is operably linked to a promoter and a transcriptional termination signal. The second set of DNA sequences that comprises a first promoter operably linked to a first coding sequence, a second promoter operably linked to a second coding sequence, and a third promoter operably linked to a third coding sequence. The transcriptional termination signal can be any transcriptional termination signal functional in a plant, or any plant transcriptional termination signal.

Agrobacterium-mediated transfer is a widely applicable system for introducing genes into plant cells. See, e.g., Fraley et al, Bio/Technology 3:629-635 (1985); Rogers et al, Methods Enzymol 153:253-277 (1987). The region of DNA to be transferred is defined by the border sequences and intervening DNA is usually inserted into the plant genome. Spielmannefa/., Mol Gen. Genet. 205:34(1986). Modern Agrobacterium transformation vectors are capable of replication in E. coli as well as Agrobacterium, allowing for convenient manipulations.

G.        Oil Compositions<br>
For many oil applications, saturated fatty acid levels are preferably less than 8% by<br>
weight, and more preferably about 2-3 % by weight. Saturated fatty acids have high<br>
melting points which are undesirable in many applications. When used as a feedstock or fuel, saturated fatty acids cause clouding at low temperatures, and confer poor cold flow properties such as pour points and cold filter plugging points to the fuel. Oil products containing low saturated fatty acid levels may be preferred by consumers and the food industry because they are perceived as healthier and/or may be labeled as "saturated fat free" in accordance with FDA guidelines. In addition, low saturate oils reduce or eliminate the need to winterize the oil for food applications such as salad oils. In biodiesel and lubricant applications oils with low saturated fatty acid levels confer improved cold flow properties and do not cloud at low temperatures.<br>
The factors governing the physical properties of a particular oil are complex. Palmitic, stearic and other saturated fatty acids are typically solid at room temperature, in contrast to the unsaturated fatty acids, which remain liquid. Because saturated fatty acids have no double bonds in the acyl chain, they remain stable to oxidation at elevated temperatures. Saturated fatty acids are important components in margarines and chocolate formulations, but for many food applications, reduced levels of saturated fatty acids are desired.<br>
Oleic acid has one double bond, but is still relatively stable at high temperatures, and oils with high levels of oleic acid are suitable for cooking and other processes where heating is required. Recently, increased consumption of high oleic oils has been recommended, because oleic acid appears to lower blood levels of low density lipoproteins ("LDLs") without affecting levels of high density lipoproteins ("HDLs"). However, some limitation of oleic acid levels is desirable, because when oleic acid is degraded at high temperatures, it creates negative flavor compounds and diminishes the positive flavors created by the oxidation of linoleic acid. Neff et al, JAOCS, 77 -.1303-1313 (2000); Warner et al.,J. Agric. Food Chem. 49:899-905 (2001). Preferred oils have oleic acid levels that are 65-85% or less by weight, in order to limit off-flavors in food applications such as frying oil and fried food. Other preferred oils have oleic acid levels that are greater than 55% by weight in order to improve oxidative stability.<br>
Linoleic acid is a major polyunsaturated fatty acid in foods and is an essential nutrient for humans. It is a desirable component for many food applications because it is a major precursor of fried food flavor substances such as 2,4 decadienal, which make fried foods taste good. However, linoleic acid has limited stability when heated. Preferred food oils have linoleic acid levels that are 10% or greater by weight, to enhance the formation of desirable fried food flavor substances, and also are 25% or less by weight, so that the formation of off-flavors is reduced. Linoleic acid also has cholesterol-lowering properties, although dietary excess can reduce the ability of human cells to protect themselves from oxidative damage, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Toborek et al., Am J. Clin. J. 75:119-125 (2002). See generally Flavor Chemistry of Lipid Foods, editors D.B. Min &amp; T.H. Smouse, Am Oil Chem. Soc, Champaign, IL (1989).<br>
Linoleic acid, having a lower melting point than oleic acid, further contributes to improved cold flow properties desirable in biodiesel and biolubricant applications. Preferred oils for most applications have linoleic acid levels of 30% or less by weight, because the oxidation of linoleic acid limits the useful storage or use-time of frying oil, food, feed, fuel and lubricant products. See generally, Physical Properties of Fats, Oils, and Emulsifiers, ed. N. Widlak, AOCS Press (1999); Erhan &amp; Asadauskas, Lubricant Basestocks from Vegetable Oils, Industrial Crops and Products, 11:277-282(2000). In addition, high linoleic acid levels in cattle feed can lead to undesirably high levels of linoleic acid in the milk of dairy cattle, and therefore poor oxidative stability and flavor. Timmons et al, J. Dairy Sci. 84:2440-2449 (2001). A broadly useful oil composition has linoleic acid levels of 10-25% by weight.<br>
Linolenic acid is also an important component of the human diet. It is used to synthesize the co-3 family of long-chain fatty acids and the prostaglandins derived therefrom. However, its double bonds are highly susceptible to oxidation, so that oils with high levels of linolenic acid deteriorate rapidly on exposure to air, especially at high temperatures. Partial hydrogenation of such oils is often necessary before they can be used in food products to retard the formation of off-flavors and rancidity when the oil is heated, but hydrogenation creates unhealthy trans fatty acids which can contribute to cardiovascular disease. To achieve improved oxidative stability, and reduce the need to<br>
hydrogenate oil, preferred oils have linolenic acid levels that are 8% or less by weight, 6% or less, 4% or less, less than about 3%, and more preferably 0.5-2% by weight of the total fatty acids in the oil of the present invention.<br>
Oil from soybean of the present invention can also be used as a blending source to make a blended oil product. By a blending source, it is meant that the oil from a soybean of the present invention can be mixed with other vegetable oils to improve the characteristics, such as fatty acid composition, flavor, and oxidative stability, of the other oils. The amount of oil from a soybean of the present invention which can be used will depend upon the desired properties sought to be achieved in the resulting final blended oil product. Examples of blended oil products include, but are not limited to, margarines, shortenings, frying oils, salad oils, etc. The oil from a soybean of the present invention can be a blended oil, synthesized oil or in a preferred embodiment an oil generated from an oilseed having an appropriate oil composition. An oil generated directly from an oilseed is a non-blended oil. In another aspect, an oil is directly from a mature oilseed. In this aspect, a mature seed as defined by a seed that is harvested in the field for commercial agricultural practices, such as sale for feed. In a preferred embodiment, the oil is a soybean oil. The oil can be a crude oil such as crude soybean oil, or can be a processed oil, for example the oil can be refined, bleached, deodorized, and/or winterized. As used herein, "refining" refers to a process of treating natural or processed fat or oil to remove impurities, and may be accomplished by treating fat or oil with caustic soda, followed by centrifugation, washing with water, and heating under vacuum. "Bleaching" refers to a process of treating a fat or oil to remove or reduce the levels of coloring materials in the fat or oil. Bleaching may be accomplished by treating fat or oil with activated charcoal or Fullers (diatomaceous) earth. "Deodorizing" refers to a process of removing components from a fat or oil that contribute objectionable flavors or odors to the end product, and may be accomplished by use of high vacuum and superheated steam washing. "Winterizing" refers to a process of removing saturated glycerides from an oil, and may be accomplished by chilling and removal of solidified portions of fat from an oil.<br>

1.5, 2., 2.5, 3, or 3.5 percent; and the upper limit is selected from the following percentages: 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, or 1.5 percent.<br>
An oil of the present invention is particularly suited to use as a cooking or frying oil. Because of its reduced polyunsaturated fatty acid content, the oil of the present invention does not require the extensive processing of typical oils because fewer objectionable odorous and colorant compounds are present. In addition, the low saturated fatty acid content of the present oil improves the cold flow properties of the oil, and obviates the need to heat stored oil to prevent it from crystallizing or solidifying. Improved cold flow also enhances drainage of oil from fried food material once it has been removed from frying oil, thereby resulting in a lower fat product. See Bouchon et al, J. Food Science 66: 918-923 (2001). The low levels of linolenic acid in the present oil are particularly advantageous in frying to reduce off-flavors.<br>
The present oil is also well-suited for use as a salad oil (an oil that maintains clarity at refrigerator temperatures of 40-50 degrees Fahrenheit). Its improved clarity at refrigerator temperatures, due to its low saturated fatty acid and moderate linoleic acid content, reduces or eliminates the need to winterize the oil before use as a salad oil.<br>
In addition, the moderate linoleic and low linolenic acid content of the present oil make it well-suited for the production of shortening, margarine and other semi-solid vegetable fats used in foodstuffs. Production of these fats typically involves hydrogenation of unsaturated oils such as soybean oil, corn oil, or canola oil. The increased oxidative and flavor stability of the present oil mean that it need not be hydrogenated to the extent that typical vegetable oil is for uses such as margarine and shortening, thereby reducing processing costs and the production of unhealthy trans isomers.<br>
An oil of the present invention is also suitable for use as a feedstock to produce biodiesel, particularly because biodiesel made from such an oil has improved cold flow, improved ignition quality (cetane number), improved oxidative stability, and reduced nitric oxide emissions. Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel typically comprised of methyl esters of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated C16-C22 fatty acids. Cetane number is a measure of ignition quality - the shorter the ignition delay time of fuel in the<br>
engine, the higher the cetane number. The ASTM standard specification for biodiesel fuel (D 6751-02) requires a minimum cetane number of 47.<br>
The use of biodiesel in conventional diesel engines results in substantial reductions of pollutants such as sulfates, carbon monoxide, and particulates compared to petroleum diesel fuel, and use in school buses can greatly reduce children's exposure to toxic diesel exhaust. A limitation to the use of 100% conventional biodiesel as fuel is the high cloud point of conventional soy biodiesel (2 degrees C) compared to number 2 diesel (-16 degrees C). Dunn et al, Recent. Res. Devel. in Oil Chem., 1:31-56 (1997). Biodiesel made from oil of the present invention has an improved (reduced) cloud point and cold filter plugging point, and may also be used in blends to improve the cold-temperature properties of biodiesel made from inexpensive but highly saturated sources of fat such as animal fats (tallow, lard, chicken fat) and palm oil. Biodiesel can also be blended with petroleum diesel at any level.<br>
Biodiesel is typically obtained by extracting, filtering and refining soybean oil to remove free fats and phospholipids, and then transesterifying the oil with methanol to form methyl esters of the fatty acids. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,891,203. The resultant soy methyl esters are commonly referred to as "biodiesel." The oil of the present invention may also be used as a diesel fuel without the formation of methyl esters, such as, for example, by mixing acetals with the oil. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,013,114. Due to its improved cold flow and oxidative stability properties, the oil of the present invention is also useful as a lubricant, and as a diesel fuel additive. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,888,947, 5,454,842 and 4,557,734.<br>
Soybeans and oils of the present invention are also suitable for use in a variety of soyfoods made from whole soybeans, such as soymilk, soy nut butter, natto, and tempeh, and soyfoods made from processed soybeans and soybean oil, including soybean meal, soy flour, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolates, texturized soy protein concentrate, hydrolyzed soy protein, whipped topping, cooking oil, salad oil, shortening, and lecithin. Whole soybeans are also edible, and are typically sold to consumers raw, roasted, or as edamame. Soymilk, which is typically produced by soaking and grinding whole soybeans,<br>
may be consumed as is, spray-dried, or processed to form soy yogurt, soy cheese, tofu, or yuba. The present soybean or oil may be advantageously used in these and other soyfoods because of its improved oxidative stability, the reduction of off-flavor precursors, and its low saturated fatty acid level.<br>
G.       Modulation of Suppression<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method of modulating gene suppression levels. Modulation of gene suppression can result in more or less gene suppression. Suppression of a gene product can be the result from insertion of a construct of the present invention into a plant genome. Similarly, modulation of gene suppression can be the result from insertion of a construct of the present invention into a plant genome. Other examples of methods to modulate gene suppression include, without limitation, antisense techniques, cosuppression, RNA interference (dsRNAi), transgenic animals, hybrids, and ribozymes using a construct of the present invention. The following examples are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.<br>
Suppression of a gene can be modulated by altering the length of the transcribable DNA used for suppression, which sequence is derived from the gene targeted for suppression. Many methods can be used for suppressing a gene using post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms. Without being limited to the theory, these methods are believed to have in common the expression of an RNA molecule which hybridizes to another RNA molecule. Surprisingly, there can be advantages to using a RNA molecule of particular lengths to modulate or moderate suppression of the steady state expression levels of a targeted endogenous gene.<br>
Gene suppression ofFAD2-l leads to elevated levels of oleic acid and reduction of linoleic acid levels. When FAD2-1 is heavily suppressed, levels of oleic acid can be greater than 65%, which causes a reduction in palmitic acid and linolenic acid levels. For example, when FAD2-1 is suppressed, oleic acid levels can reach 85% and the combined palmitic and stearic acid levels are reduced to about 10%. Similarly, downregulation of FATB results in decreased levels of saturated fatty acids, primarily palmitate. When FAD2<br>
and FATB are suppressed so that oleic levels are about 85%, saturate levels are about 10%. When FAD2 and FATB are suppressed so that oleic levels are greater than 85%, saturate levels can fall below 10%.<br>
In light of the present invention, saturate levels can be reduced to less than 10% without enhancing oleic acids above 85%. In one embodiment, the suppression of FAD2 is modulated by reducing the length of FAD2-1 intron introduced into the plant. Less suppression of FAD2 results in moderate levels of oleic acid, approximately 40-85% oleic acid. The suppression of FAD2 is reduced as the length of the FAD2-1 intron fragment introduced is reduced. For example, a FAD2-1 intron reduced in length by at least 100 contiguous nucleotides can reduce the suppression of FAD2 and the corresponding increase in oleic acid and decrease in linoleic acid levels.<br>
The relationship between the decrease in endogenous gene suppression and the decrease in length of homologous DNA can be determined empirically by introducing different lengths of DNA. For example, the amount of reduction in suppression obtainable by reducing the length of homologous introduced DNA can be determined by deleting increasing portions of the homologous DNA being introduced and assaying for expression of the targeted gene.<br>
Included in the present invention is a method for moderating suppression of FAD2 while still having a strong reduction of saturate levels in a plant. In such plants, oleic acid levels can range from 40-85%. Similarly, less than full suppression of FATB occurs when the combined 3' and 5' untranslated regions are introduced as compared to when the full-length FATB gene is introduced into a host cell. In a like manner, suppression levels of FATB are reduced when the 5' part of the open reading frame, which mostly encodes the chloroplast transit peptide, is introduced into a host cell. In cells with FAD2 and FATB suppressed using methods according to the present invention, oleic acid levels can be 40-85% while saturate levels can be between 1 to 9 percent.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of modulating gene suppression to reduce suppression relative to the suppression from a entire gene element, where a entire gene element can be an entire gene, an entire exon, an entire intron,<br>
an entire signal sequence, or an entire UTR, then constructing a recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprising a fragment of the endogenous sequence from the gene element; initiating expression of the recombinant nucleic acid molecule in a host cell; and suppressing the endogenous gene with the recombinant nucleic acid molecule. The gene being suppressed can be any gene, including FAD2 and FATB. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of modulating FAD2 or FATB suppression comprising: expressing a partial FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence in a host cell, where a FAD2 or FATB gene element is from an endogenous FAD2 or FATB gene in the host cell and a FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence can be a FAD2 or FATB gene, a FAD2 or FATB exon, a FAD2 or FATB intron, a FAD2 or FATB transit peptide coding region, or a FAD2 or FATB UTR; and the partial FAD2 or F^JS gene element sequence is less than the entire FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence; and suppressing an endogenous FAD2 or FATB with the partial FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence, where suppression levels of the FAD2 or FATB endogenous gene in the host cell are less than suppression levels of the FAD2 or FATB endogenous gene in a host cell with a similar genetic background and a second FAD2 or FATB nucleic acid sequence comprising the entire FAD2 or FATB gene element sequence of the FAD2 or FATB gene element.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of altering the oil composition of a plant cell by transforming a plant cell with a recombinant nucleic acid molecule which comprises a DNA sequence that suppresses endogenous expression of FAD2, FATB, or FAD2 and FATB where the DNA sequence comprises a nucleic acid sequence of FAD2, FATB, or FAD2 and FATB that is shorter than the entire sequence of an entire genetic element selected from a gene, an exon, an intron, a transit peptide coding region, a 3'-UTR, a 5'-UTR, and an open reading frame; and growing the plant cell under conditions where transcription of said DNA sequence is initiated, whereby the oil composition is altered relative to a plant cell with a similar genetic background but lacking the recombinant nucleic acid molecule. A gene element of FAD2 or FATB can be shortened in length by 50, 75, 100, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 nucleotides. A length of a gene element of FAD2 or FATB can<br>
be 50, 75, 100, 150, 175, 200, 220, 250, 300, 320, 350, 400, 420, 450, 500, 550 600, 800, or 1000 nucleotides.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of enhancing oleic acid content and reducing saturated fatty acid content in a plant seed by: i) shortening the length of an exogenous FAD2 DNA sequence in a host cell until the amount of suppression of FAD2 expression from a transformed plant is at least partially reduced relative to the suppression of FAD2 expression in a host cell with a similar genetic background and an entire exogenous FAD2 gene DNA sequence; and ii) growing a plant with a nucleic acid molecule comprising the shortened FAD2 DNA sequence, where the shortened FAD2 DNA sequence at least partially suppresses endogenous expression of FAD2; and iii) cultivating a plant that produces seed with a reduced saturated fatty acid content relative to seed from a plant having a similar genetic background but lacking the shortened FAD2 DNA sequence. The amount that the exogenous FAD2 DNA sequence is shortened to at least partially reduce suppression of the endogenous FAD2 can be determined empirically by introducing different lengths of DNA. For example, the amount of reduction in suppression obtainable by reducing the length of homologous introduced DNA can be determined by deleting increasing portions of the homologous DNA being introduced and assaying for expression of the targeted gene. The amount of suppression of FAD2 expression can be obtained as an average of three or more, six or more, ten or more, fifteen or more, or twenty or more seeds from a plant.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of producing a transformed plant having seed with a reduced saturated fatty acid content by transforming a plant cell with a recombinant nucleic acid molecule which comprises a DNA sequence that suppresses the endogenous expression of FAD2 and FATB, where the DNA sequence comprises a nucleic acid sequence of FAD2 that is shorter than the entire sequence of an entire genetic element selected from a gene, an exon, an intron, a transit peptide coding region, and a UTR; and growing the transformed plant, where the transformed plant produces seed with a reduced saturated fatty acid content relative to seed from a plant having a similar genetic background but lacking said recombinant nucleic acid molecule.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of modulating the fatty acid composition of oil from a seed of a temperate oilseed crop by isolating a genetic element of at least 40 nucleotides in length that is capable of suppressing the expression of an endogenous gene in the fatty acid synthesis pathway; generating more than one shortened fragment of the genetic element; introducing each of the more than one shortened fragments into a plant cell of the temperate oilseed crop to produce transgenic plants; and selecting a transgenic plant comprising a shortened fragment of determined length and sequence that effects a desirable change in seed oil fatty acid composition. In a preferred embodiment, the method above also includes constructing a recombinant DNA construct having at least two shortened fragments of two different endogenous genes that effect different desirable changes in seed oil fatty acid composition; introducing the recombinant DNA construct into a plant cell of the temperate oilseed crop to produce transgenic plants; and selecting a transgenic plant comprising the at least two shortened fragments and a fatty acid composition of oil from a seed having more than one desirable change effected by the at least two shortened fragments.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a soybean seed exhibiting an oil composition having a strongly reduced saturated fatty acid content and a moderately enhanced oleic acid content having a DNA sequence that suppresses the endogenous expression of FAD2 in a host cell, where the DNA sequence has a nucleic acid sequence of FAD2 that is shorter than the entire sequence of an entire genetic element selected from a gene, an exon, an intron, a transit peptide coding region, and a UTR.<br>

Example 2      Suppression Constructs<br>
2A.      FAD2-1 Constructs<br>
The FAD2-1A intron #1(SEQ ID NO: 1) is cloned into the expression cassette, pCGN3892, in sense and antisense orientations. The vector pCGN3892 contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'. Both gene fusions are then separately ligated into pCGN9372, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting expression constructs (pCGN5469 sense and pCGN5471 antisense) are used for transformation of soybean.<br>
The FAD2-1B intron (SEQ ID NO: 2) is fused to the 3' end of the FAD2-1A intron #1 in plasmid pCGN5468 (contains the soybean 7S promoter fused to the FAD2-1A intron (sense) and a pea rbcS 3') or pCGN5470 (contains the soybean 7S promoter fused to the FAD2-1A intron (antisense) and a pea rbcS 3') in sense and antisense orientation, respectively. The resulting intron combination fusions are then ligated separately into pCGN9372, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting expression constructs (pCGN5485, FAD2-1A &amp; FAD2-1B intron sense and pCGN5486, FAD2-1A &amp; FAD2-1B intron antisense) are used for transformation of soybean.<br>
2B.      FAD3-1 Constructs<br>
FAD3-1A introns #1, #2, #4 and #5 (SEQ ID NOs: 7, 8, 10 and 11, respectively), FAD3-1B introns #3C (SEQ ID NO: 23) and #4 (SEQ ID NO: 24), are all ligated separately into pCGN3892, in sense or antisense orientation. pCGN3892 contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'.

2C.      FatB Constructs<br>
The soybean FATB-1 intron II sequence (SEQ ID NO: 30) is amplified via PCR using a FATB-1 partial genomic clone as a template. PCR amplification is carried out as follows: 1 cycle, 95ยฐC for 10 min; 25 cycles, 95ยฐC for 30 sec, 62ยฐC for 30 sec, 72ยฐC for 30 sec; 1 cycle, 72ยฐC for 7 min. PCR amplification results in a product that is 854 bp long, including reengineered restriction sites at both ends. The PCR product is cloned directly into the expression cassette pCGN3892 in sense orientation, by way of Xhol sites engineered onto the 5' ends of the PCR primers, to form pMON70674. Vector pCGN3892 contains the soybean 7S promoter and a pea rbcS 3'. pMON70674 is then cut with Notl and ligated into pMON41164, a vector that contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter. The resulting gene expression construct, pMON70678, is used for transformation of soybean using Agrobacterium methods.<br>
Two other expression constructs containing the soybean FATB-1 intron II sequence (SEQ ID NO: 30) are created. pMON70674 is cut with Notl and ligated into pMON70675 which contains the CP4 EPSPS gene regulated by the FMV promoter and the KAS IV gene regulated by the napin promoter, resulting in pMON70680. The expression vector pMON70680 is then cut with SnaBl and ligated with a gene fusion of the jojoba delta-9 desaturase gene (SEQ ID NO: 41) in sense orientation regulated by the 7S promoter. The<br>
expression constructs pMON70680 and pMON70681 are used for transformation of soybean using Agrobacterium methods.<br>
2D      Combination Constructs<br>
Expression constructs are made containing various permutations of a first set of DNA sequences. The first set of DNA sequences are any of those described, or illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, or any other set of DNA sequences that contain various combinations of sense, antisense, or sense and antisense FAD2, FAD3, and FATB non-coding or coding regions so that they are capable of forming dsRNA constructs, sense cosuppression constructs, antisense constructs, or various combinations of the foregoing.<br>
FIGS. 5(a)-(c) depict several first sets of DNA sequences which are capable of expressing sense cosuppression or antisense constructs according to the present invention, the non-coding sequences of which are described in Tables 1 and 2 below. The non-coding sequences may be single sequences, combinations of sequences (e.g., the 5'UTR linked to the 3'UTR), or any combination of the foregoing. To express a sense cosuppression construct, all of the non-coding sequences are sense sequences, and to express an antisense construct, all of the non-coding sequences are antisense sequences. FIG. 5(d) depicts a first set of DNA sequences which is capable of expressing sense and antisense constructs according to the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 6(a)-(c) depict several first sets of DNA sequences which are capable of expressing dsRNA constructs according to the present invention, the non-coding sequences of which are described in Tables 1 and 2 below. The first set of DNA sequences depicted in FIG. 6 comprises pairs of related sense and antisense sequences, arranged such that, e.g., the RNA expressed by the first sense sequence is capable of forming a double-stranded RNA with the antisense RNA expressed by the first antisense sequence. For example, referring to FIG. 6(a) and illustrative combination No. 1 (of Table 1), the first set of DNA sequences comprises a sense FAD2-1 sequence, a sense FAD3-1 sequence, an antisense FAD2-1 sequence and an antisense FAD3-1 sequence. Both antisense sequences correspond to the sense sequences so that the expression products of the first set of DNA sequences are capable of forming a double-stranded RNA with each other. The sense<br><br>
sequences may be separated from the antisense sequences by a spacer sequence, preferably one that promotes the formation of a dsRNA molecule. Examples of such spacer sequences include those set forth in Wesley et al, supra, and Hamilton et al, Plant J., 15:737-746 (1988). The promoter is any promoter functional in a plant, or any plant promoter. Non-limiting examples of suitable promoters are described in Part D of the Detailed Description.<br>
The first set of DNA sequences is inserted in an expression construct in either the sense or anti-sense orientation using a variety of DNA manipulation techniques.   If convenient restriction sites are present in the DNA sequences, they are inserted into the expression construct by digesting with the restriction endonucleases and ligation into the construct that has been digested at one or more of the available cloning sites. If convenient restriction sites are not available in the DNA sequences, the DNA of either the construct or the DNA sequences is modified in a variety of ways to facilitate cloning of the DNA sequences into the construct. Examples of methods to modify the DNA include by PCR, synthetic linker or adapter ligation, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, filling in or cutting back of overhanging 5' or 3' ends, and the like. These and other methods of manipulating DNA are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Example 4      Plant Transformation and Analysis<br>
The constructs of Examples 2 and 3 are stably introduced into soybean (for example, Asgrow variety A4922 or Asgrow variety A3244 or Asgrow variety A3525) by the methods described earlier, including the methods of McCabe et al, Bio/Technology, 6:923-926 (1988), or Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transformed soybean plants are identified by selection on media containing glyphosate. Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with the constructs using gas chromatography. In addition, any of the constructs may contain other sequences of interest, as well as different combinations of promoters.<br>
For some applications, modified fatty acid compositions are detected in developing seeds, whereas in other instances, such as for analysis of oil profile, detection of fatty acid modifications occurring later in the FAS pathway, or for detection of minor modifications to the fatty acid composition, analysis of fatty acid or oil from mature seeds is preferred. Furthermore, analysis of oil and/or fatty acid content of individual seeds may be desirable, especially in detection of oil modification in the segregating R1 seed populations. As used herein, Ro generation indicates the plant arising from transformation/regeneration protocols described herein, the Rl generation indicates seeds grown on the selfed transgenic Ro plant. Rl plants are grown from the Rl seeds.<br>
Fatty acid compositions are determined for the seed of soybean lines transformed with the constructs of Example 3. One to ten seeds of each of the transgenic and control soybean lines are ground individually using a tissue homogenizer (Pro Scientific) for oil extraction. Oil from ground soybean seed is extracted overnight in 1.5 ml heptane containing triheptadecanoin (0.50 mg/ml). Aliquots of 200 ยตl of the extracted oil are derivatized to methyl esters with the addition of 500 ยตl sodium methoxide in absolute methanol. The derivatization reaction is allowed to progress for 20 minutes at 50ยฐC. The reaction is stopped by the simultaneous addition of 500 ju.1 10% (w/v) sodium chloride and 400 p-1 heptane. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters extracted in hexane are resolved by gas chromatography (GC) on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 GC (Palo Alto, CA). The GC was fitted with a Supelcowax 250 column (30 m, 0.25 mm id, 0.25 micron film thickness) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Column temperature is 175ยฐC at injection and the temperature programmed from 175ยฐC to 245ยฐC to 175ยฐC at 40ยฐC/min. Injector and detector temperatures are 250ยฐC and 270ยฐC, respectively.<br>
Example 5       Synthesized Fuel Oil with Improved Biodiesel Properties<br>
A synthesized fuel oil fatty acid composition is prepared having the following mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters: 73.3% oleic acid, 21.4% linoleic acid, 2.2% palmitic acid, 2.1% linolenic acid and 1.0% stearic acid (all by weight). Purified fatty acid methyl esters are obtained from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN, USA. The cetane number and ignition delay of this composition is determined by the Southwest Research Institute using an Ignition Quality Tester ("IQT") 613 (Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, USA).<br>
An IQT consists of a constant volume combustion chamber that is electrically heated, a fuel injection system, and a computer that is used to control the experiment, record the data and provide interpretation of the data. The fuel injection system includes a fuel injector nozzle that forms an entrance to the combustion chamber. A needle lift sensor in the fuel injector nozzle detects fuel flow into the combustion chamber. A pressure transducer attached to the combustion chamber measures cylinder pressure, the pressure within the combustion chamber. The basic concept of an IQT is measurement of the time<br>
from the start of fuel injection into the combustion chamber to the start of combustion. The thermodynamic conditions in the combustion chamber are precisely controlled to provide consistent measurement of the ignition delay time.<br>
For a cetane number and ignition delay test, the test fuel is filtered using a 5-micron filter. The fuel reservoir, injection line, and nozzle are purged with pressurized nitrogen. The fuel reservoir is then cleaned with a lint free cloth. A portion of the test fuel is used to flush the fuel reservoir, injection line, and nozzle. The reservoir is filled with the test fuel and all air is bled from the system. The reservoir is pressurized to 50 psig. The method basically consists of injecting at high pressure a precisely metered quantity of the test fuel into the combustion chamber that is charged with air to the desired pressure and temperature. The measurement consists of determining the time from the start of injection to the onset of combustion, often referred to as the ignition delay time. This determination is based on the measured needle lift and combustion chamber pressures. The normal cetane rating procedure calls for setting the skin temperature at 567.5ยฐC and the air pressure at 2.1 MPa.<br>
A fuel with a known injection delay is run in the IQT combustion bomb at the beginning of the day to make sure the unit is operating within normal parameters. The test synthetic is then run. The known fuel is run again to verify that the system has not changed. Once the fuel reservoir is reconnected to the fuel injection pump, the test procedure is initiated on the PC controller. The computer controls all the procedure, including the air charging, fuel injection, and exhaust events. 32 repeat combustion events are undertaken.<br>
The ignition delay is the time from the start of injection to the start of ignition. It is determined from the needle lift and cylinder pressure data. The rise of the injection needle signals start of injection. The cylinder pressure drops slightly due to the cooling effect of the vaporization of the fuel. Start of combustion is defined as the recovery time of the cylinder pressure - increases due to combustion to the pressure it was just prior to fuel injection.<br>
The measured ignition delay times are then used to determine the cetane number based on a calibration curve that is incorporated into the data acquisition and reduction software. The calibration curve, consisting of cetane number as a function of ignition delay time, is generated using blends of the primary reference fuels and NEG check fuels. In the case of test fuels that are liquid at ambient conditions, the calibration curve is checked on a daily basis using at least one check fuel of known cetane number (Ryan, "Correlation of Physical and Chemical Ignition Delay to Cetane Number", SAE Paper 852103 (1985); Ryan, "Diesel Fuel Ignition Quality as Determined in a Constant Volume Combustion Bomb", SAE Paper 870586 (1986); Ryan, "Development of a Portable Fuel Cetane Quality Monitor", Belvoir Fuels and Lubricants Research Facility Report No. 277, May (1992); Ryan, "Engine and Constant Volume Bomb Studies of Diesel Ignition and Combustion", SAE Paper 881616 (1988); and Allard et al, "Diesel Fuel Ignition Quality as Determined in the Ignition Quality Tester ("IQT")", SAE Paper 961182 (1996)). As shown in Table 3, the synthesized oil composition exhibits cetane numbers and ignition delays that are suitable for use for example, without limitation, as a biodiesel oil.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
 The fuel called "Check-High" is a calibration fuel. It should have a cetane number of 49.3ยฑ0.5. The unit is checked with the calibration before and after running the synthetic test fuel.<br>
The density (ASTM D-4052) cloud point (ASTM D-2500), pour point (ASTM D-97), and cold filter plugging point (IP 309/ASTM D-6371) are determined for the synthesized oil using ASTM D protocols. ASTM D protocols are obtained from ASTM, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA, USA. The results of these tests are set forth in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the synthesized oil composition exhibits numbers that are suitable for use as, for example without limitation, as a biodiesel oil.<br>

 Levels of nitric oxide emissions are estimated by evaluating the unsaturation levels of a biologically-based fuel, by measuring the fuel density and indirectly calculating the estimated emissions levels, or by directly measuring . There are also standard protocols available for directly measuring levels of nitric oxide emissions. The synthesized oil is estimated to have lower nitric oxide emissions levels than methyl esters of fatty acids made from conventional soybean oil based on an evaluation of the overall level of unsaturation in the synthesized oil. Oils containing larger numbers of double bonds, i.e., having a higher degree of unsaturation, tend to produce higher nitric oxide emissions. The oil has a total of 123 double bonds, as compared to conventional soybean oil's total of 153 double bonds, as shown in Table 5.<br>

 As reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Contract No. ACG-8-17106-02 Final Report, The Effect Of Biodiesel Composition On Engine Emissions From A DDC Series 60 Diesel Engine, (June 2000), nitric acid emissions of biodiesel compositions are predicted by the formula y = 46.959x - 36.388 where y is the oxide emissions in grams/brake horse power hours; and x is the density of biodiesel. The formula is based on a regression analysis of nitric acid emission data in a test involving 16 biodiesel fuels. The test makes use of a 1991 calibration, production series 60 model Detroit Diesel Corporation engine.<br>
The density of the synthesized oil is determined by Southwest Research Institute using the method ASTM D4052. The result shown in Table 4 is used in the above equation to predict a nitric oxide emission value of 4.89 g/bhp-h. This result is compared to a control soybean product. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory report gives the density and nitric oxide emissions of a control soy based biodiesel (methyl soy ester IGT). The density of the control biodiesel is 0.8877 g/mL, giving a calculated nitric oxide emission of 5.30 g/bhp-h. This calculated emission value is similar to the experimental value for nitric oxide emission of 5.32 g/bhp-h. The synthesized oil composition exhibits improved numbers compared to the control and is suitable for use, for example without limitation, as a biodiesel oil.<br>
Example 6      Optimum Fatty Acid Composition For Healthy Serum Lipid Levels<br>
The cholesterol lowering properties of vegetable compositions are determined to identify fatty acid compositions that have a more favorable effect on serum lipid levels than conventional soybean oil (i.e., lower LDL-cholesterol and higher HDL-cholesterol). Published equations based on 27 clinical trials (Mensink, R.P. and Katan, M.B. Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis, 12:911-919 (1992)) are used to compare the effects on serum lipid levels in humans of new oilseed compositions with that of normal soybean oil.<br>
Table 6 below presents the results of the change in serum lipid levels where 30% of dietary energy from carbohydrate is substituted by lipids. The results show that soybean oil already has favorable effects on serum lipids when it replaces carbohydrates in the diet. Improvements on this composition are possible by lowering saturated fat levels and by obtaining a linoleic acid level between 10-30% of the total fatty acids, preferably about 15-25% of the total fatty acids. When the proportion of linoleic acid is less than 10% of the total fatty acids, the new composition raises LDL-cholesterol compared to control soybean oil, even though the saturated fat content is lowered to 5% of the total fatty acids. When the proportion of linoleic acid is increased, the ability of the composition to raise serum HDL levels is reduced. Therefore, the preferred linoleic acid composition is determined to be about 15-25% of the total fatty acids.<br>

The soybean FAD 2-1A intron #1 is then directionally cloned into pMON68541 to generate KAWHIT03.0071 (soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 with soybean FAD3-1A intron<br>
#5).<br>
Step 9 - KAWHIT03.0035 (FAD3-1A 3'UTR in CM resistant vector) is digested with AscI and Hindlll and KAWHIT03.0071 (FAD2-1A intron and FAD3-1A intron #5 dsRNAi AMP resistant base vector) is digested with Mlul and Hindlll. The soybean FAD 3-1A 3'UTR is then directionally cloned into KAWHIT03.0071 to generate<br>
KAWHIT03.0072 (soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 and FAD3-1A 3'UTR with soybean FAD3-1A intron #5).<br>
Step 10 - KAWHIT03.0037 (FATB-l 3'UTR in CM resistant vector) is digested with AscI and Hindlll and KAWHIT03.0072 is digested with Mlul and Hindlll. The FATB-l 3'UTR is then directionally cloned into KAWHIT03.0072 to make KAWHIT03.0073 (soybean FAD2-IA intron, FAD3-IA 3'UTR, FATB-l 3'UTR with FAD3-IA intron #5).<br>
Step 11 - KAWHIT03.0073 is digested with BstXI and Sail and the fragment containing FAD2-1A intron, FAD3-IA 3'UTR and FATB-l 3'UTR is gel purified. In a different tube KAWHIT03.0073 is digested with Xhol and Sse8387I. The intron/3'UTR fragment is then cloned back into KAWHIT03.0073 in the opposite orientation on the other site of soybean FAD3-1A intron #5 to create KAWHIT03.0074 (soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR sense, soybean FATB-l 3'UTR sense, soybean, spliceable soybean FAD3-1A intron #5, soybean FATB-l 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 anti-sense).<br>
Step 12 - To link the dsRNAi construct to the 7S alpha' promoter and the TML 3', KAWHIT03.0074 and pMON68527 (7Sa'/TML3' cassette) are digested with Sad and ligated together to make pMON68563 (7S alpha' promoter - FAD2-1A intron #1 sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR sense, soybean FATB-l 3'UTR sense, spliceable soybean soybean FATB-l 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 anti-sense - TML3').<br>
Step 13 - To introduce the assembled dsRNAi construct into pMON70682, pMON68563 and pMON70682 are digested with NotI and ligated together to form pMON68536 comprising a 7S alpha' promoter operably linked to the double-stranded-RNA-forming construct of FAD2-1A intron #1 sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR sense, soybean FATB-l 3'UTR sense, spliceable soybean FAD3-1A intron #5, soybean FATB-l 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 anti-sense and TML3' terminator).<br>
Step 14 - pMON68536 is then digested with AscI and RsrII and pMON68529 (which contains the selectable marker CP4 fused to the FMV promoter and the RBCS 3' and the soybean FAD2 promoter driving the delta 9 desaturase) is digested with SanDI and AscI. The dsRNAi portion of pMON68536 is then directionally cloned into pMON68529 to create pMON68537 (7S alpha' promoter operably linked to the double-stranded-RNA-forming construct of FAD2-1A intron #1 sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR sense, soybean FATB-1 3'UTR sense, spliceable soybean FAD3-1A intron #5, soybean FATB-1 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 anti-sense and TML3' terminator and soybean FAD2 promoter driving the delta 9 desaturase).<br>
Example 8<br>
The following fifteen steps illustrate the construction of vector pMON68539 (Figure 22) designed for plant transformation to suppress FAD2, FAD3, and FATB genes and over-express delta-9 desaturase and the KASIV enzyme in soybean. In particular, the construct comprises a 7S alpha promoter operably linked to soybean sense-oriented intron and 3'UTRs, i.e., a FAD2-1A intron #1, a FAD3-1A 3'UTR, a FATB-1 3'UTR, a hairpin loop-forming spliceable intron, and a complementary series of soybean anti-sense-oriented intron and 3'UTR's, i.e., aFATB-1 3'UTR, aFAD3-1 A 3'UTR and aFAD2-1A intron #1, the soybean FAD2 promoter driving the delta-9 desaturase, and the Napin promoter driving KASIV.<br>

Step 5 - KAWHIT03.0034 is digested with Bspl20I and EcoRI and then ligated into KAWHIT03.0032 (empty CM resistant vector with a multiple cloning site) to make KAWHIT03.0035 (FAD3-IA 3'UTR in empty CM resistant vector).<br>

18664 = CTGTGTCAAAGTATAAACAAGTTCAG. The resulting PCR product is cloned into pCR 2.1 creating KAWHIT03.0038.<br>
Step 7 - Soybean FAD 2-1A intron #1 PCR product in KAWHIT03.0038 is cloned into KAWHIT03.0032 (empty CM resistant vector with a multiple cloning site) using the restriction sites Bspl20I and EcoRI. The resulting plasmid is KAWHIT03.0039 (soybean FAD 2-1A intron #1 in empty CM resistant vector).<br>
Step 8 - KAWHIT03.0039 is digested with AscI and Hindlll and pMON68541 (FAD3-1A intron #5 dsRNAi AMP resistant base vector) is digested with Mlul and Hindlll.

In a different tube KAWHIT03.0073 is digested with Xhol and Sse8387I. The Intron/3'UTR fragment is then cloned back into KAWHIT03.0073 in the opposite orientation on the other site of soybean FAD3-1A intron #5 to create KAWHIT03.0074 (soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR sense, soybean FATB-1 3'UTR sense, soybean,<br>
spliceable soybean FAD3-1A intron #5, soybean FATB-1 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 anti-sense).<br>
Step 12 - To link the dsRNAi construct to the 7S alpha' promoter and the TML 3', KAWHIT03.0074 and pMON68527 (7Sa7TML3' cassette) are digested with Sad and ligated together to make pMON68563 (7S alpha' promoter - FAD2-1A intron #1 sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR sense, soybean FATB-1 3'UTR sense, spliceable soybean soybean FATB-1 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD3-1A 3'UTR anti-sense, soybean FAD2-1A intron #1 anti-sense - TML3').<br>

Example 9<br>
This example illustrates plant transformation to produce soybean plants with suppressed genes.<br>
A transformation vector pMON68537 as prepared in Example 7 is used to introduce an intron/3 'UTR double-stranded RNA-forming construct into soybean for suppressing the A12 desaturase, A15 desaturase, and FATB genes. Vector pMON68537 also contains the delta-9 desaturase (FAB2) and the CP4 genes.   The vector is stably introduced into soybean (Asgrow variety A4922) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI (Martinell, U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301). The CP4 selectable marker allows transformed soybean plants to be identified by selection on media containing glyphosate herbicide.<br>
Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with the intron/3 'UTR dsRNAi expression constructs using gas chromatography. R1 pooled seed and R1 single seed oil compositions demonstrate that the mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions are altered in the oil of seeds from transgenic soybean lines as compared to that of the seed from non-transformed soybean, (See Table 7). For instance, FAD2 suppression provides plants with increased amount of oleic acid ester compounds; FAD3 suppression provides plants with decreased linolenic acid ester compounds; and FATB suppression provides plants with reduced saturated fatty ester compounds, e.g. palmitates and stearates. Selections can be made from such lines depending on the desired relative fatty acid composition. Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with constructs using gas chromatography.<br>

 Example 11<br>
Construct pMON95829 as described in Example 3D is used to introduce a FAD2-1 intron, double-stranded RNA-forming construct into soybean for suppressing the Fad2 gene. The vector is stably introduced into soybean (Asgrow variety A4922) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI (Martinell, U.S. Patent No. 6,384,301). The CP4 selectable marker allows transformed soybean plants to be identified by selection on media containing glyphosate herbicide. Subsequently, the genomes of transformed plants are screened for concurrent tandem insertion of the first T-DNA and the second T-DNA, i.e. in the "right border to right border" assembly. Screening is done with Southern hybridization mapping methods. Transformed soybean plants containing the preferred configuration in their genome are transferred to a green house for seed production.<br>
For example, leaf tissue was taken from the R0 plants transformed with construct pMON95829 and Southern analysis is performed. Probes and restriction enzyme digests are chosen in order to identify events containing a right-border-right-border ("RB-RB") assembly of both T-DNAs. Typically, approximately 25% of all transformants have properly assembled RB-RB T-DNAs.<br>
Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with a pMON95829 construct using gas chromatography as described in Example 4 to identify methyl esters of fatty acid compounds extracted from seeds. First, six R1 seeds taken from soybean plants transformed with construct pMON95829 are harvested, and the fatty acid composition of each single seed is determined. Since R1 plants of each event are segregating for the transgenes and, therefore, yield seeds with conventional soybean composition, as well as modified versions. The positive seeds are pooled and averaged for each event. The pooled positive averages demonstrate that the mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions are altered in the oil of seeds from transgenic soybean lines as compared to that of the seed from non-transformed soybean (See Table 9). For example, FAD2 suppression provides plants with increased amount of oleic acid ester compounds.<br>

Fatty acid compositions are analyzed from seed of soybean lines transformed with a pMON93770 construct using gas chromatography as described in Example 4 to identify methyl esters of fatty acid compounds extracted from seeds. First, six R1 seeds taken from soybean plants transformed with construct pMON93770 are harvested, and the fatty acid composition of each single seed is determined. Since R1 plants of each event are segregating for the transgenes and, therefore, yield seeds with conventional soybean composition, as well as modified versions. The positive seeds are pooled and averaged for each event. The pooled positive averages demonstrate that the mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions are altered in the oil of seeds from transgenic soybean lines as compared to that of the seed from non-transformed soybean (See Table 16). For example, FAD2 suppression provides plants with increased amount of oleic acid ester compounds.<br>

 Example 27<br>
TaqMan is an assay that quantifies nucleic acids via a selective amplification and real-time fluorescence measurements (also called real-time PCR). This procedure is used to determine the extent of target transcript suppression in transgenic developing seeds. To determine the absolute transcript levels of target mRNA in a sample, a standard curve is established for each TaqMan experiment. For this purpose, different amounts of cloned soy target gene sequence, diluted in 20 ng total RNA from canola, are amplified in parallel with the samples of unknown target amounts. Precision of the transcript copy number determined in this way has an error margin of 25%.<br>
For template material, total RNA is extracted using an ABI 6100 Nucleic Acid Prep Station, and 20ng is used per TaqMan sample. The samples are analyzed on an ABI 700 Sequence Detection instrument using ABI Prism-One Step RT-PCR Master Mix<br>
Chemistry. TaqMan Count (Ct) values from the end of the TaqMan PCR reaction are plotted against the known quantity of synthetic target sequence to calculate a linear regression so that the amount of FAD2-1 target DNA in an unknown sample can be determined from the TaqMan Ct values created at the end of each TaqMan PCR reaction.<br>
Plants were transformed with either pMON68540, pMON68546, or pMON80623, all of which suppress FAD2-1A (see Section 3 A and Figure 7 for descriptions of the constructs).<br>
Total RNA is obtained from null and transformed plants using an ABI 6100 Nucleic Acid Prep Station. Transformed plants are third generation homozygous and have levels of oleic acid greater than 50%. FAD2-1A primers, FAD2-1B primers, or FAD2-2A primers are added in separate TaqMan samples to the total RNA from each plant to be tested. The samples are analyzed on an ABI 700 Sequence Detection instrument using ABI Prism-One Step RT-PCR Master Mix Chemistry.<br>
All transgenic plants substantially suppress FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B transcript levels. None of the transgenic plants even partially reduced FAD2-2A or FAD2-2B levels.<br>
Plant to plant comparisons of FAD2-1A transcript levels in null plants determine natural variation between plants. FAD2-1A mRNA from developing seeds is assayed using PCR primers, which produce the Probe sequence in multiple plants. Seeds at size 0.2g fresh weight are taken from four different R2 null segregant plants, each plant from a different line. R2 seed pools of same size class and from four different null segregants are tested. PCR reactions are done in triplicate and the results are normalized in comparison to the amount of 18S RNA in each sample. Plant to plant biological variability in FAD2-1A transcripts is low. Three of the four samples have a normalized TaqMan Count (Ct) value of about 65 and one of the samples has a normalized TaqMan Ct value of about 50.<br>
