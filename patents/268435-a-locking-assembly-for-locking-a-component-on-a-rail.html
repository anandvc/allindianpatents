				<td>Field of invention<br><br>
The present disclosure relates to a locking assembly for use on an electrical or electronic component to be mounted on a roil.<br><br>
Background of the invention:<br><br>
A large number of systems hove components mounted on them and they are enclosed. Number of systems have been developed and used for mounting components such as electrical components, in enclosures. These systems use various conduit and rail structures for channeling the component and the v^ires to and from the components in a neat and orderly manner to facilitate installation and servicing. DIN roils are one popular type of system based on a standard set of flanged rails that con be cut to a desired length and attached to the interior of an enclosure. The rails have either inwardly or outwardly projecting flanges in a raised position along its length for receiving the components. The components, including a wide array of modular elements such as terminal blocks, input/output modules, dip switches etc feature corresponding structures designed to interface with the rail flanges to hold the components securely in place during installation and use.<br><br>
Components mount on the rail ore either screw- down or screwless styles. Screw-down structures generally placed on the DIN rail and may be slid along the roil for positioning. A screw is then held over one of the rail and driven into the flange to fasten the component in place. In addition to the complexity of Installation, a disadvantage of these structures is the need to independently secure each component via the screw. This process is not only time consuming, but may result in misalignment on the rail due to twisting of the component under the influence of the screw-down torque and  physical force exerted  in  drilling the screws. Therefore, in  many applications, the screwless mounting arrangements are often preferable. These arrangements include a component module having a hook-shaped rigid foot that is slipped over a first of the rail flanges, and a deformable leg that is then snapped over the opposite flange to secure the component to the roil. Because the modules are typically made of a moldable plastic material due to its good electrical insulation capabilities, metallic clips and the like are often provided in the rail interface features to bind the component more securely in place on the rail. For removal, the deformable leg may be bent free of the rail flange and the component may be removed by unhooking the rigid foot from the opposite flange.<br><br>
While such known screwless DIN roil mounting structures provide an attractive solution to the problem of quickly and easily attaching components in desired roil locations, they are not without drawbacks. For example, known arrangements of this type employ differently configured securing elements on either side of the module. These elements are added to the molded module during an assembly process, such as by heat staking<br><br>
It becomes difficult to snap into place and to remove from the roil since they are fitted with means of specialized components.<br><br>
There is a need, therefore, for an improved arrangement for mounting components along DIN rails. The arrangement should be of a straightforward design that con be easily manufactured and assembled on the rail. In particular, there is a need for a DIN roil mounting structure that provides good holding force while minimizing the complexity of working.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br><br>
The present disclosure defines locking assembly for locking a component on a rail comprising a sliding means and a locking means connected by on engaging means, the said engaging means has an angular profile movable along a variable rotational axis to convert the vertically exerted force on the slider into a horizontal force on the locking means causing the vertical movement of sliding means causes one end of the angularly profiled engaging means connected to the slider to rotationally move the engaging means, thereby causing movement of the other end of the engaging means connected io the locking means into a locking or unlocking position.<br><br>

Detailed Description:<br><br>
The locking assembly is described in detail as herein below and in Figure 1. A locking assembly for locking a component (4) on a rail comprising a sliding means (1), and a locking means (2) and an engaging means (3). The engaging means connects the sliding means and the locking means with each other. The assembly is fixed to the component.<br><br>
Figure 2 provides an exploded view of the assembly. A sliding means (1) is preferably a slider as shown in Figure 2. The slider is provided with slots (11,12) in the bottom for placement of engaging means. Slot (12)	provided on one side defines an open slot shaped to providing the opening on the outside; however it is also possible to define the slot by means of a closed front end snap (11) and only a back opening to provide better hold of the same as shown in figure . The present embodiment provides both possible slots to protect the engaging means from moving of the slider. The slider is also provided with a lead in means<br>
(13)which enable guiding of the slider through the component on the casing. The slider is provided with a handle on the top for gripping.<br><br>
The figure 2 also defines an engaging means. The present invention utilizes a UV-rod as an engaging means. The UV rod is shaped with a U profile and/or a V profile based on the application and thus called a UV-rod. The UV rod comprises two springs to form a V profile or a U profile. The ends of the two U/V profiles are connected to each other to form one single unit as shown in the figure. It is possible to have only one end connected as per the present embodiment, other embodiments include two independent V profile spring. Further the UV rod may even consist of a single unit placed at the centre to perform the some function. The spring is selected based on required tensile strength.<br>
The figure 2 also defines a locking clip (2) having a slot at the end to engage the engaging means (UV-rod). The slot (21) Is designed with a closed front end with a hook design fo provide a better hold of the engaging means. A T-plate can be included to lock the engaging means. The clip as defined has lead-in means (22) for sliding the locking clip into the guide provided at the bottom of the case on components. Different angles of the engaging means n accordance with the present embodiment are provided in the figures for clarity.<br><br>
The figure 3 describes a locking clip assembly consist of a sliding means, engaging means and the locking means connected to each other.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the assembly of locking clip assembly is provided herewith. Figures 4(a) -4(d) provides the steps of assembling the locking assembly to the component. Firstly, the locking clip Is slid into the groves provided at the bottom of the component on its casing as shown in figure 4(a). The UV-rod is then placed in the slot provided on the locking clip OS shown in figure 4 (b). The slider is then inserted Into the guide provided in the side of the component on the casing as shown in the figure 4 (c). When inserted partially and when at an optimum level, the slider, as shown in figure, is assembled with UV-rod by placing the other ends of the UV-rod into the slots available on the bottom of the slider. The ends of the UV-rod are positioned such that they are inline with the parallel guide provided with the case. The case- of the component provides a parallel guide for the clip to avoid mismatch of angle. With the clip, UV rod and the slider once connected, the slider is pushed further into the guide within the case till all the devices completely sits into the component, providing the required L shaped locking clip assembly as defined in figure 3 (d). This preferred process for mounting the locking means allows a very late assembly on the device so that it is possible to adjust the presence of locking means depending on the use of the device, but other mounting processes ore possible. Once fit the T-plate may be fitted to the locking clip to close the slot and restrict the UV-rod from downward movement and thus stopping the slider's downward movement and disassembling the locking clip assembly.<br>
The locking clip locks the component with the DIN rail. The UV rod provides tensile strength and pushes the lock in engaged position. The UV-rod now acts in a U-profile since it gets compressed and avoids the locking clip from moving backwards and thus fastening the locking clip with the DIN rail the UV-rod get compressed at U-profile. The other end UV rod is fitted to the slider and thus they are stably placed with each other.<br><br>
At the first instance for engaging the component on the DIN roil, the slider is pushed downward in vertical direction along the guide and this action pushes one end of the UV-rod. This vertical force exerted on the UV-rod is converted into a horizontal force due to the profile of the UV-rod. The other end of the UV-rod being connected to the locking clip pushes the clip towards the DIN rail. At exertion of on optimum vertical force on the slider the UV-rod fully engages and the clip locks with the DIN Rail. Figure defines the lock position of the component with the DIN roil.<br><br>
At lock position the UV-rod is compressed and the profile compresses to form a U profile due to the force exerted by the locking. However since the other end of the UV rod is now connected to the slider and placed at the Sonne level of the clip and within a slot on the casing of the component, this avoids further movement causing a tensile force on the spring. This force provides the locking force to be exerted on the locking clip with the DIN Rail.<br>
During disengagement, the same steps are followed as during engagement, but In the reverse order.<br><br>
Figure 5 (a) describes the disengagement action. To disengage the locking clip, the slider Is pulled vertically upward as shown in the figure. The pull force exerted by the slider is transferred on the UV-rod which now acts as a mechanical link. Due to the force exerted on the UV-rod on the outward direction of the profile due to the pull force on both the ends, it changes into a V profile. At being opplied an optimum pulling force on the slider, the other end of the UV-rod being connected to the locking clip drag the locking clip backward from its unlocking position. This pulls the locking head away from the DIN rail flanges to unlock from the DIN rail.<br><br>
Figure 5 (b) describes an engagement action. To reengage the component on the DIN rail, the slider Is pushed downward vertically along the guide and this action pushes one end of the UV-rod. This vertical force exerted on the UV-rod Is converted Into a horizontal force due to the profile of the UV-rod. Due to the force exerted on the UV-rod on the inward direction of the profile due to the push force on both the ends, it changes into a U profile. The other end of the UV-rod being connected to the locking clip pushes the clip towards the DIN rail leading to locking of the component with the DIN rail. At exertion of an optimum vertical force on the slider the UV-rod fully engages and the clip locks with the DIN Rail.<br><br>
Figure defines the lock position of the component with the DIN rail is pushed downward in vertical direction and intern the UV-rod pushes the locking clip outward in horizontal direction.<br><br>
