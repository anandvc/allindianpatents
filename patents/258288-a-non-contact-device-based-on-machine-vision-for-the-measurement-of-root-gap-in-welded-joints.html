FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for measuring weld root gap<br>
and distance between edges of an weld using an electronic camera,<br>
software and a lighting source. More particularly, the invention relates<br>
to a device for detecting the root gap and the gap at the top of the joint<br>
in a weld fit-up by machine vision.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Welding is a well-established manufacturing method for joining<br>
components. In welding, the most widely used method is the arc welding<br>
processes where the two parts are set in close contact with each other<br>
such that there exists a specific gap at the abutting surface and is called<br>
the root gap. The root gap is an important parameter in welding<br>
operation and has to be controlled to get good quality in weld. Generally<br>
the parts are set with the required root gap and the two parts are<br>
restrained from moving and they are mechanically joined together using<br>
clamps or similar appliances. The gap, thus set, may still be different<br>
from the required gap since the welding heat may lead to the variation<br>
of the gap in spite of the clamps. Thus the measurement of the gap and<br>
maintaining it are important for the welding operation.<br><br>
The root gap is measured by different gages such as vernier calipers, screw<br>
gages or weld gages utilizing mechanical arrangements and employing profile<br>
projectors and shadowgraphs using optical and electronic gadgets.<br>
Imaging technology for measurements in medical and mechanical fields are well-<br>
established technologies.<br>
Patent JP11047932 discloses about the measurement of root gap of a weld<br>
especially for two tubes. The two tubes are aligned and by means of two<br>
hydraulic cylinders the two surface positions are located and this is used for the<br>
correction of the misalignment. The invention utilizes mechanical devices<br>
whereas the proposed invention discusses about a machine-vision based system<br>
for the root gap in a weld.<br>
JP8101001 utilizes the mechanical measurement by using rulers for the<br>
measurement, whereas the present invention is totally a non-contact machine<br>
vision based system.<br>
US5026967 describes the welding parameters for the laser welding of dissimilar<br>
materials and does not refer to the weld root gap detection.<br>
JP2000263274 describes the aligning the edges mechanically using a rotating<br>
device and standard reference for a particular job. The present invention uses<br>
the machine vision method to identify the root gap.<br>
JP60257976 refers to the use of magnetic field generated by the welding current<br>
for detecting the root gap. The present invention uses the machine vision for the<br>
root gap measurement using an optical system JP60257976 is working on a<br>
principal of using the magnetic field created in the groove by the welding<br>
current. The present invention does not use magnetic field at all. The proposed<br>
invention also is not involved with any technical character related to any welding<br>
step. Presence of welding current flow is important for the invention as per<br>
Patent JP60257976 but the proposed invention does not require any welding.<br><br>
Patent GB1449044 discusses about a machine vision based system for detecting<br>
the weld shape. A shadow of an edge is used as a method of finding the root<br>
gap. The protection of a light on varying contoured surface produces a projected<br>
image of the shadow, which is affected by the surface contour. By taking a video<br>
of the shadow of the edge formed on the weld contour, the exact shape of the<br>
weld root and the edges are found. This enables the contour of the surface to be<br>
detected at one particular location. For the next location, the light source is<br>
moved along with the shadow forming edge and again the analysis is conducted.<br>
The root gap or the weld contour of the entire weld is not measured<br>
simultaneously as in proposed invention in contrast, root gap or the weld contour<br>
is measured at various points as number of stages. A wedge [2A] is placed in<br>
front of the light source. A shadow is formed on the job [4]. This image of the<br>
shadow is picked up by the camera [3] at an angle (Fig-2). This method of<br>
employing the light is called "structured lightning" in industrial parlance. The<br>
image captured by the camera is shown in the patent GB1449044 figure (3). The<br>
shape of the groove or that of a completed weld can be checked as shown in the<br>
Figures 4, 6 and 7. However this requires that the image is acquired at every<br>
section of the job for finding the root gap and the gap between the edges at the<br>
top. Whenever a shadow is formed by an edge, there will be spreading of<br>
shadow because of diffraction due to the edge effect on one side and the<br>
measurement may not be at the place intended.<br>
The present invention is based on acquisition of the image of a larger area and<br>
using image processing to detect edges in the larger area at a time for increased<br>
productivity. The present invention uses a light source [1] for illuminating an<br>
area of the job. Since the proposed invention uses larger illuminated area,<br>
diffraction resulted from edge effect due to structured light using edge or slit is<br>
eliminated.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose, a device for measuring the<br>
gap between the two edges of the root and top of a weld fit up using a non-<br>
contact optical method.<br>
Another object of the invention is to identify the gap for larger areas at a time<br>
for purpose of increased productivity.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a device, which will enable<br>
measurement from a far off distance.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to measure the root gap even in the<br>
environment of intense arc light produced by welding.<br>
A yet another object of the invention is to propose a device, which can be used<br>
in a zone just ahead of the weld when the welding is in progress.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a device that ensures that the<br>
measurement is done such that the feedback about the root gap and the gap at<br>
the top of the weld joint can be given electronically.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a device, which will enable the<br>
measurement when the weld root has very little access especially in thick joints.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention there is provided a device for measuring the<br>
root gap in a weld comprising; an electronic camera for acquiring the image of<br>
the weld groove, suitable light source to illuminate the groove, and a computer<br>
with image analysis software to undertake the analysis; Collect the image of the<br>
weld groove with the<br><br>
wedge [2A] is placed in front of the light source. A shadow is formed on<br>
the job [4]. This image of the shadow is picked up by the camera [3] at<br>
an angle (Fig-2). This method of employing the light is called '<br>
structured lighting ' in industrial parlance. The image captured by the<br>
camera is shown in the patent GB1449044 figure (3). The shape of the<br>
groove or that of a completed weld can be checked as shown in the<br>
Figures 4, 6 &amp; 7. However this requires that the image is acquired at<br>
every section of the job for finding the root gap and the gap between<br>
the edges at the top. Whenever a shadow is formed by an edge, there<br>
will be spreading of shadow because of diffraction due to the edge effect<br>
on one side and the measurement may not be at the place intended.<br>
The present invention is based on acquisition of the image of a larger<br>
area and using image processing to detect edges in the larger area at a<br>
time for increased productivity. The present invention uses a light source<br>
[1] for illuminating an area of the job. Since the proposed invention uses<br>
larger illuminated area, diffraction resulted from edge effect due to<br>
structured light using edge or slit is eliminated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The Invention includes a system consisting of an electronic camera for<br>
acquiring the image of the weld groove, suitable light source to<br>
illuminate the groove, and a computer with image analysis software to<br>
undertake the analysis. The image of the weld groove is collected with<br>
the camera placed vertically above the weld groove and two light<br>
sources located at an angle above the weld. The locating of the edge of<br>
the root, edge of weld top is carried out by mathematical operations on<br>
the acquired image. Measuring the locations of the edge lines at the top<br>
and the root and finding the difference between them to identify the root<br>
gap and the weld seam position through set up variant I (Fig 2) using<br>
reflected light is performed through the device setup. Measuring the<br>
locations of edge lines at the root and finding the difference between<br>
them to find the root gap only, using transmitted light, through the<br>
measurement set up variant II (Fig 5) is performed in another set of<br>
device.<br>
The illumination is such that the image of the top surface is brighter<br>
compared to the image of the weld groove and the root gap. The image<br>
of the root gap (zone 3) is darker than that of the sidewall which is<br><br>
mentioned as zone 1 and zone 3 in the image formation (Fig 6). The<br>
image collected from the camera covers a larger area effectively finding<br>
the root gap and the top edge for a specified length in an area decided<br>
by the camera resolution and the distance between the camera and the<br>
job.<br>
In the present invention, image collected from the camera is processed<br>
by doing the standard edge detection operations using image processing<br>
software. The choice of the saturation levels used decides the separation<br>
of the edges. A copy of the first image is cropped to include only root<br>
portion (excluding the top edge). When this cropped image is used for<br>
edge detection only the root is detected. However, when the second<br>
image which is cropped so that the cropped image includes the top edge<br>
i.e. zone 1 and zone 2 and a portion zone 3, is used for the edge<br>
detection, then only the top edges are detected. Hence by using one<br>
image and two software operations, the root gap and the distance<br>
between the top edges are detected. The nomenclature used in this<br>
specification is shown in fig 1. The distance between point A and point B<br>
is the distance between the edges at the top. The root gap is the<br>
distance between C and D.<br>
There are two variants to the invention and are described below:<br>
In variant I, (Fig 2) the device comprises of an electronic camera [2],<br>
two light sources [3] a shroud [4] covering the weld zone [1] and<br>
computer [5] with a required software. The camera is an electronic type<br><br>
with required resolution and ability to record and transmit the images to<br>
the computer. Two light sources are placed at two different locations at<br>
an angle such that the two sources, and the camera are aligned along<br>
the length of the weld and such that the camera is in between the two<br>
light sources. A shroud [4] covers on all the four sides of the camera<br>
such that the area covered for the image is shielded from external light.<br>
The computer [5] collects the image through the camera and the image<br>
is further processed. The image collected from the camera is processed<br>
by doing the standard edge detection operations using image processing<br>
software. The choice of the saturation levels used decides the separation<br>
of the edges. A copy of the first image is cropped to include only root<br>
portion (excluding the top edge) referred as cropping zone 2 as per fig<br>
7. When this cropped image is used for edge detection only the root is<br>
detected. However, when the second image which is cropped as per<br>
cropping zone 1 mentioned in fig 6 so that the cropped image includes<br>
the top edge i.e. weld image zone 1 and zone 2 and a portion of zone 3,<br>
is used for the edge detection, then only the top edges are detected.<br>
The resultant edge image is converted to the binary image and is shown<br>
as seen in fig 3 and fig 4. Hence by using one image and two software<br>
operations, the root gap and the distance between the top edges are<br>
detected. Variant II of the invention is as shown in figure 5 wherein the<br>
device comprises of an electronic camera [2], two light sources [3] kept<br>
at the bottom and computer [5] with the required software. The camera<br>
is an electronic type with required resolution and ability to record and<br>
transmit the images to the computer. Two light sources are placed at<br>
two different locations at the bottom such that the two sources, and the<br><br>
camera are aligned along the length of the weld ( Fig 5 ). A shroud[4]<br>
covers on all the four sides of the camera such that the area covered for<br>
the image is shielded from external light. The computer [5] collects the<br>
image from the camera and the image is further processed. The image is<br>
cropped as per cropping zone 2 as mentioned in Fig 7, so that the<br>
cropped image includes the root. The image is processed by the<br>
standard edge detection operations by the image processing software.<br>
The choice of the saturation levels used decides this separation of the<br>
edges. The resultant edge image is converted to the binary image and is<br>
shown in fig 4. By calibrating computer monitor pixel values with<br>
distance, it is possible to calculate the gap accurately.<br>
The invention as herein defined should not be read and construed in a<br>
restrictive manner, as several modifications, alterations and adaptations<br>
are possible within the scope and ambit of the invention as defined in<br>
the appended claims.<br><br>
