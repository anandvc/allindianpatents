				<td>Amino alcohol derivatives<br>
[Technical field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to amino alcohol derivatives having excellent<br>
immune suppression activity, pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, esters<br>
thereof or other derivatives thereof; to pharmaceutical compositions containing said<br>
compounds as an active ingredient; to the use of said compounds in the preparation of<br>
said pharmaceutical compositions; and to methods for prevention or treatment of<br>
autoimmune diseases, which comprise administering a pharmacologically effective<br>
amount of said compound to warm blooded animals in need of such prevention or<br>
treatment.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to optically active novel amino<br>
alcohol derivatives (particularly, optically active 4,4-disubstituted oxazolidin-2-one<br>
derivatives), which are useful synthetic intermediates for the preparation of said<br>
amino alcohol derivatives or other medicaments.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a novel processes for the<br>
excellent selective preparation of optically active 2-substituted 2-amino-l,3-<br>
propanediol mono-ester derivatives, which are useful synthetic intermediates for the<br>
preparation of said amino alcohol derivatives in optically active form.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
Steroids or antiinflammatory drugs have been used as therapeutic agents for<br>
inflammatory responses caused by abnormal immunological responses in diseases<br>
related to the immune system such as rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune<br>
diseases. However, these agents are agents that improve the symptoms, but they do<br>
not provide treatment of the causes.<br>
Although abnormal immunological responses have also been reported to<br>
contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and nephritis [Kidney International,<br>
51, 94 (1997); Journal of Immunology, 157, 4691 (1996)], no agents have ever been<br>
developed to improve the abnormal immunological responses.<br>
On the other hand, development of immune suppressors is important for<br>
prevention of immunological rejection occurring in organ transplantation or for the<br>
prevention or therapy of autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, well known<br><br>
immunosuppressors such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (TRL) are known to<br>
cause renal toxicity or hepatotoxicity. Although steroids have been administered<br>
together with immunosuppressors in order to decrease such adverse effects of the<br>
immunosuppressors, the immunosuppressing effects could not be satisfactorily<br>
elicited without the adverse events.<br>
From these backgrounds, many attempts have been made to find compounds<br>
exerting excellent immunosuppressing effects with low toxicity.<br>
The following compounds are known as immunosuppressive agents:<br>
(1) In the specification of WO94/08943 (EP627406) compounds of formula (a) are<br>
disclosed as immunosuppressive agents,<br><br>
wherein R is a straight or branched carbon chain which may have, in the chain, a<br>
group selected from the group consisting of a double bond, a triple bond, oxygen atom,<br>
sulfur atom,-N(R6)- (wherein R6 is a hydrogen atom), optionally substituted arylene,<br>
optionally substituted heteroarylene or the like, and which may be substituted, at the<br>
chain end thereof, by optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl,<br>
optionally substituted heteroaryl or the like; and R2, R3, R4, R5 are the same or<br>
different and each represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (a) have two oxymethyl groups (-CH2OR4 and -<br>
CH2OR5) as essential groups. The compounds of the present invention, however,<br>
have a -CH2OR3 group and a lower alkyl group and are different from the compounds<br>
of formula (a) in these substituents.<br>
In said specification no typical compounds similar to the compounds of formula<br>
(I) in the present invention are disclosed at all. Only the following two compounds<br>
of the compounds of formula (a) are highly similar in chemical structure to the<br>
compounds of formula (I) in the present invention:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 each are a hydrogen atom or the like; W is a hydrogen atom, an<br>
alkyl group or the like; Z is a single bond or an alkylene group; X is a hydrogen atom<br>
or an alkoxy group; Y is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, alkoxy, acyl, acyloxy, amino,<br>
acylamino group or the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (b) essentially have a phenyl group as a basic<br>
skeleton. The compounds of formula (I) in the present invention have a thiophene<br>
group instead of the phenyl group of compounds of formula (b) and are different from<br>
the compounds of formula (b) in the basic skeleton.<br>
In said specification no typical compounds similar to the compounds of formula<br>
(I) in the present invention are disclosed at all. Only the following three compounds<br>
of the compounds of formula (b) are highly similar in chemical structure to the<br>
compounds of formula (I) in the present invention:<br>
The compounds of formula (c) have two oxymethyl groups (-CH2OR3 and -<br>
CH2OR4) as essential substituent groups. The compounds of the present invention<br>
have a -CH2OR3 group and a lower alkyl group and are different from the compounds<br>
of formula (a) in these substituents. The compounds of formula (c) have a phenyl<br>
group between -(CH2)2 and -CO(CH2)4- as a basic skeleton. The compounds of<br>
formula (I) in the present invention have a thiophene group instead of the phenyl<br>
group of the compounds of formula (c). The present compounds of formula (I) are<br>
also different from the compounds of formula (c) in the basic skeleton. The<br>
compounds of formula (c) have only a phenyl group at the end of-CO-(CH2)4- group.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) in the present invention may have a phenyl group, a<br>
cycloalkyl group or a heterocyclic group at the end of the molecule.<br>
In said specification no typical compounds similar in chemical structure to the<br>
compounds of formula (I) in the present invention are disclosed at all. Only the<br>
following three compounds of the compounds of formula (c) are highly similar in<br>
chemical structure to the compounds of formula (I) in the present invention:<br>
On the other hand, various optically active substituted amino acid and substituted<br>
amino alcohol derivatives (particularly a-substituted amino acid and a-substituted<br>
amino alcohol derivatives) exhibit biological activity; are partial components of<br>
natural products and pharmaceutical agents; and are important synthetic intermediates.<br>
For example, a-methyl-a-vinyl amino acids are useful as an amino acid<br>
decarboxylase inhibitor; a-ethynyl-a-methyl amino acids are useful as a glutamic<br>
acid decarboxylase inhibitor; ISP-1 (Myriocin), which is isolated from metabolites of<br>
Isalia sinclairii, has immune suppression activity; and Conagenine and the<br>
like participate in the regulation of immune response through T-cells. From these<br>
results, a-substituted amino acid and amino alcohol derivatives are very interesting<br>
compounds as a partial component of natural products having biological activity, in<br>
the field of biochemistry and in the field of organic synthesis.<br>
These a-substituted amino acid and amino alcohol derivatives have an<br>
asymmetric center(s) and an efficient process for the preparation of one enantiomer<br>
thereof has been expected.<br>
There are a few reports of processes for the preparation of optically active<br>
substituted amino acid and amino alcohol derivatives and a few reports of synthetic<br>
examples of optically active amino alcohol derivatives such as optically active 4,4-<br>
disubstituted oxazolizin-2-one derivatives, which are useful synthetic intermediates of<br>
optically active substituted amino acid and amino alcohol derivatives described<br>
hereinbefore. For example, there are reports by C. Cativiela et al., Tetrahedron:<br>
Asymmetry, 9, 3517 (1998) and Synthesis of Optically active a-amino acids<br>
(Pergamon Press) R.M.Williams et al and the methods are largely classified into two<br>
groups for preparation of them. The one is a diasteroselective alkylation method<br>
using an assisting group for asymmetric synthesis, a typical example being a method<br>
described by Seebach in Helv. Chim. Acta., 71, 224 (1988) or the synthesis of a-<br>
substituted serine derivatives which are obtained by a highly diastereoselective aldol<br>
reaction using chiral bis-lactam ether carboxylic acid esters and Mg(II) and Sn(II)<br>
type Lewis acids described by Nagao and Sano et al. in Tetrahedron Lett., 36, 2097<br>
(1995) and Tetrahedron Lett., 36, 4101 (1995). The other one is a synthesis of a-<br>
substituted serine derivatives which are obtained by enantioselective enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis of prochiral a-symmetry diester compounds (a-substituted-a-protected<br>
malonic acid diesters) and is described by Nagao, Tamai et al., in Chemistry Lett., 239<br>
(1989) and Chemistry Lett., 2381 (1994).<br>
The former method has multi-step reactions and needs a stoichiometric<br>
asymmetric source. The latter method has a reduction step and cannot be used when<br>
a compound has a group unstable under reduction conditions.<br>
There are some reports described hereinbefore but, however the practically<br>
useful methods are limited. In general, one enantiomer is optically resolved from a<br>
racemic mixture. In this case there is a problem that the total yield of the desired<br>
compound is low.<br>
[Disclosure of the invention]<br>
The present inventors have performed painstaking research to complete these<br>
objectives, and found that the amino alcohol derivatives (I) of the present invention<br>
exert an excellent immunosuppressive effect with low toxicity and are useful as<br>
therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, Behcet's syndrome, Chron<br>
disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, aplastic anemia, scleoderma,<br>
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, multiple<br>
sclerosis, autoimmune bullosis, vulgarity psoriasis, vasculitis syndrome, Wegener's<br>
granuloma, uveitis, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, Goodpasture's syndrome,<br><br>
sarcoidosis, allergic granulomatous angitis, bronchial asthma, myocarditis,<br>
cardiomyopathy, aortic arch syndrome, myocardial postinfarction syndrome, primary<br>
pulmonary hypertension, minimal change nephrotic syndrome, membranous<br>
nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, focal glomerular sclerosis,<br>
crescent glomerulonephritis, myasthenia gravis, inflammatory neuropathy, atopic<br>
dermatitis, chronic actinic dermatitis, acute polyarthritis, Sydenhan chorea disease,<br>
progressive systemic sclerosis, adult onset type diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent<br>
diabetes mellitus, juvenile diabetes, atherosclerosis, glomerular nephritis,<br>
tuburointerstitial nephritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis,<br>
fulminant hepatic failure, viral hepatitis, GVHD, immunological rejection following<br>
organ transplantation, contact dermatitis, sepsis or other immunology related diseases,<br>
and completed the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides amino alcohol derivatives which exhibit low<br>
toxicity and excellent immune suppression activity, pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salts thereof, esters thereof or other derivatives thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing said amino alcohol derivatives, a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
an ester thereof, or other derivative thereof as an active ingredient; the use of said<br>
compounds in the preparation of said pharmaceutical compositions; or methods for<br>
prevention or treatment of the diseases described hereinbefore such as autoimmune<br>
diseases and the like, which comprise administering a pharmacologically effective<br>
amount of said compound to warm blooded animals in need of such prevention or<br>
treatment.<br>
The inventors have made a great effort to solve the problems described<br>
hereinbefore about a process for the preparation of optically active amino alcohol<br>
derivatives and intermediates thereof. They have found that optically active novel<br>
amino alcohol derivatives of formulae (La) and (Lb) (especially 4,4-disubstituted<br>
oxazolizin-2-one derivatives) can be obtained more easily than by conventional<br>
methods and said derivatives are useful synthetic intermediates for the preparation of<br>
optically active substituted amino acid and substituted amino alcohol derivatives and<br>
medicaments.<br>
In addition they have also made a great effort to find a process for the selective<br><br>
preparation of the optically active amino alcohol compounds of formulae (La) and<br>
(Lb). They found that optically active 2-substituted 2-amino-l,3-propanediol mono-<br>
ester derivatives of formulae (XLIVa) or (XLIVb) are useful intermediate for the<br>
preparation and said compounds of formulae (XLIVa) and (XLIVb) can easily be<br>
obtained from 2-substituted 2-amino-l,3-propanediol derivatives of formula (XLII)<br>
using carboxylic acid vinyl esters of formula (XLIII) in the presence of lipase through<br>
selective acylation of one hydroxyl group in good yield.<br>

When the compound of formula (I) has a basic group such as amino group, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be prepared by the reaction of compound (I) with<br>
an acid. When the compound of formula (I) has a carboxy group the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be prepared by the reaction of compound (I) with<br>
a base.<br>
The preferred salts based on a basic group include a hydrohalogenic acid salt<br>
such as a hydro fluoride, hydrochloride, hydrobromide or hydroiodide; an inorganic<br>
acid salt such as a nitrate, perchlorate, sulfate or phosphate; a lower alkanesulfonic<br><br><br>

When the Compound (I), a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, an ester<br>
thereof or other derivative thereof are allowed to stand so that they are opened to the<br>
atmosphere or are recrystallized, they may absorb water and water may be attached to<br>
them to form a hydrate.<br>
The salts of the present invention encompass such hydrates.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, esters<br>
thereof or other derivatives thereof have an asymmetric carbon (s) and can exist as<br>
optical isomer(s). In this invention a single optical isomer and a mixture of optical<br>
isomers are represented by the single chemical formula (I). The present invention<br>
encompasses the optical isomers individually and mixtures thereof in optional ratios.<br>
For example, the compounds of formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
esters thereof or other derivatives thereof have the following partial chemical formula<br>
wherein the -NR'R2 group is attached to an asymmetric carbon and the preferred<br>
absolute configuration at this asymmetric carbon is the R configuration.<br><br>
In the above formulae the "ester" refers to an ester of a compound of formula (I) which<br>
has a group capable of being esterified. The ester includes the ester of a hydroxyl group and<br>
the ester of a carboxy group. Each ester residual group belongs to a general protecting group<br>
in chemical reactions or a protecting group capable of being removed by a biological process<br>
such as hydrolysis in vivo.<br>
The "general protecting group in chemical reaction" can be cleaved by a chemical<br>
process such as hydrogenolysis, hydrolysis, electrolysis or photolysis.<br>
The "general protecting group in chemical reactions" and the "protecting group capable<br>
of being removed by a biological process such as hydrolysis in vivo" in the esters of a<br>
hydroxyl group have the same meaning as that described above for a hydroxyl protecting<br>
group.<br>
The "general protecting group in chemical reactions" in the ester of a carboxyl group<br>
preferably includes a lower alkyl group described hereinbefore; a lower alkenyl group such as<br>
ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, l-methyl-2-propenyl, 1 -methyl- 1-propenyl, 2-methyl-1-<br>

lower aliphatic acyl-lower alkyl group such as acetylmethyl; an aralkyl group<br>
described hereinbefore; or a silyl group described hereinbefore.<br>
The "protecting group capable of being removed by a biological process such as<br>
hydrolysis in vivo" can be cleaved by a biological process such as hydrolysis in the<br>
human body to afford a free acid or a salt thereof. Whether a derivative of formula<br>
(I) has such a protecting group can be easily determined. The derivative under<br>
investigation is administered intravenously to a test animal such as a mouse or a rat<br>
and the body fluids of the test animal are thereafter studied. If the parent compound<br>
or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof is detected in the body fluids of the test<br>
animal, the derivative under investigation is judged to have such a group. The<br>
"protecting group capable of being removed by a biological process such as<br>
hydrolysis in vivo" preferably includes a lower alkoxy lower alkyl group such as<br>
methoxyethyl, 1 -ethoxyethyl, 1-methyl-1-methoxyethyl, l-(isopropoxy)ethyl, 2-<br>
methoxyethyl, 2-ethoxyethyl, 1,1-dimethyl-1-methoxyethyl, ethoxymethyl, n-<br>

alkoxycarbonyl lower alkyl group such as methoxycarbonylmethyl; a cyano lower<br>
alkyl group such as cyanomethyl or 2-cyanoethyl; a lower alkylthiomethyl group such<br>
as methylthiomethyl or ethylthiomethyl; an arylthiomethyl group such as<br>
phenylthiomethyl or naphthylthiomethyl; a lower alkyl optionally substituted with a<br>
halogen atom(s) sulfonyl lower alkyl group such as 2-methanesulfonylethyl or 2-<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonylethyl; an arylsulfonyl lower alkyl group such as 2-<br>
benzenesulfonylethyl or 2-toluenesulfonylethyl; a l-(acyloxy) lower alkyl group<br>
described hereinbefore; a phthalidyl group described hereinbefore; an aryl group<br>
described hereinbefore; a lower alkyl group described hereinbefore; a carboxyalkyl<br>
group such as carboxymethyl; and an amide-formation residual group of an amino<br>
acid such as phenylalanine.<br>
When the compound of formula (I) in this invention has an amino group and/or a<br>
carboxyl group, such a compound can be converted to a derivative other than a<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt or an ester described hereinbefore. The "other<br><br>
derivative" refers to such a derivative, for example, an amide derivative such as an<br>
acy] group.<br>

After the completion of the reaction, the compound (VII) prepared as the target compound in<br>
this reaction may be collected from the reaction mixture according to a conventional method.<br>
For example, the target compound can be obtained by conducting the following steps<br>

derivative and of the resulting product with the compound (VIII) mainly depends on the<br>
starting material compounds, the base, the solvent and the reaction temperature employed in<br>
the reaction. The reaction is usually carried out in a period of from 15 minutes to 24 hours<br>
(preferably from 30 minutes to 12 hours).<br>

a diarylphophoryl azide derivative is used, the carboxyl group of the compound (VII) can be<br>
converted into the carbamoyl group without any problem by the reaction mentioned above.<br>

this reaction may be collected from the reaction mixture according to a conventional method.<br>

acetate); separating the organic layer containing the target compound; washing the extract<br>
with, for example, water and then drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate, anhydrous sodium bicarbonate or the like; and removing solvent by<br>
evaporation. The target compound can be isolated and purified, if necessary, by a suitable<br>

Raney nickel, and palladium-on-charcoal is most preferred.<br>
The pressure in the reduction reaction is not particularly limited, but the reaction is usually<br>
carried out at a pressure of from 1 to 10 atmospheric pressures.<br>
The reaction temperature mainly depends on the starting material compounds, the solvent and<br>
the base employed in the reaction. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature of from<br>
0Â°C to 100Â°C.<br>
The reaction time mainly depends on the starting material compounds, the reaction<br>
temperature, the solvent and the base employed in the reaction. The reaction is usually<br>
carried out in a period of from 5 minutes 1o 48 hours.<br>
For example, after removing the catalyst by filtration, the target compound can be obtained by<br>
concentrating the reaction mixture or conducting the following steps successively: adding an<br>
organic solvent which is<br><br><br>
not miscible with water (e.g. ethyl acetate); separating the organic layer containing the target<br>
compound; and then drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or<br>
the like; and removing solvent by evaporation.<br>
The target compound obtained can be isolated and purified, if necessary, by conventional<br>
methods such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or chromatography using appropriate<br>
eluent(s).<br>
In Step E7, a compound (XLVII) is converted into a compound of general formula (LI) in an<br>
inert solvent in the presence of a reducing agent. This step is carried out in a similar manner<br>
to that described earlier in Step E6 of the method E.<br>
In Step E8, a compound (La-2) which is a compound (La) where R3a is a hydrogen atom is<br>
prepared by hydrolyzing a compound (LI) in an inert solvent in the presence of a base. This<br>
step is carried out in a similar manner to that described earlier in Step E4 of the method E.<br>
Step E9 is a step for preparing a compound (La-1), and in this step, a compound (La-2) is<br>
converted into the compound (La-1) in an inert solvent in the presence of a base. This step is<br>
carried out in a similar manner to that described earlier in Step E5 of the method E.<br>
In Step E10, if necessary, a compound (La-3) which is a compound (La) where R2 and R3a<br>
together do not form a group (-(C=O)-) is prepared by protecting a hydroxyl group of the<br>
compound (La-2). The reaction of this step depends on the nature of the hydroxyl group to be<br>
protected, but it can be carried out by the procedures, for example, described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis (third Edition, 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.).<br>
Alternatively, a compound (Lb-3) can be prepared by conducting the steps E2-E10 of the<br>
method E successively using a compound (XLIVb) as the starting material instead of a<br>
compound (XLIVa).<br>
In Method F, a compound (XLVI) is synthesized.<br><br>
In the above scheme, Ar and Z are as defined earlier.<br>
In Step Fl, a compound (XLVI) is prepared by the reaction of a compound of general formula<br>
(LII) with triphenylphosphine in an inert solvent.<br>
The inert solvent used in the above-mentioned reaction is not particularly limited provided<br>
that it has no adverse effect on the reaction. Examples of suitable solvents include aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, ligroin or petroleum ether; aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
such as toluene, benzene or xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene; or ethers<br>
such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane or<br>
di(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether. Of these solvents, aromatic hydrocarbons (particularly<br>
benzene) are preferred.<br>
The reaction temperature mainly depends on the starting material compounds and the solvent<br>
employed in the reaction. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature of from room<br>
temperature to 200cC, preferably from 0Â°C to 150Â°C and most preferably at 110Â°C.<br>
The reaction time mainly depends on the reaction temperature, the starting material<br>
compounds and the solvent employed in the reaction. The reaction is usually carried out in a<br>
period of from 5 minutes to 96 hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 48 hours and most<br>
preferably in 24 hours.<br>
The product thus prepared in each step of the Method F can be, if necessary, isolated and<br>
purified by conventional techniques such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or procedures<br>
that are usually used for the isolation and purification of organic compounds. Examples of<br>
the suitable techniques include adsorption column chromatography using a stationary phase<br>
such as silica gel, alumina or florisil composed of magnesium-silica gel; partition<br>
chromatography using a synthetic adsorbent such as Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia), Amberlite<br>
XAD-11 (Rohm &amp; Haas) or Diaion HP-20 (Mitsubishi Chemical Company); ion-exchange<br>
chromatography; or normal and reversed phase liquid chromatography using silica gel or<br>
alkylated silica gel (preferably high performance liquid chromatography). The target<br>
compound prepared at each step is isolated and purified by any of these techniques or a<br>
suitable combination of these techniques using an appropriate solvent(s) as an eluent.<br><br>
The separation of the isomers can be, if necessary, carried out by means of any of the<br>
separation/purification procedures mentioned above after the completion of the reaction of<br>
each step or at the suitable stage after the completion of the desired step.<br>
The compounds such as (XXVIII), (XXXIV), (XLII), (XLIII) and (LII) used as the starting<br>
materials are either known compounds or can be prepared easily by known or similar<br>
methods.<br>

4-CyclohexYloxybut-1-yne<br>
To anhydrous dichloromethane (950 ml) were added cyclohexanone (32 ml, 0.31 mol), 1, 3-<br>
propanediol (33.5 ml, 0.46 mol), triethyl orthoformate (51.5 ml, 0.31 mol), and zirconium<br>
chloride (1.44 g, 6.18 mmol) followed by stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hour at<br>
room temperature. An ice-cold 1N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (1.5 1) was added to<br>
the reaction mixture, and the reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane, and then<br>
the dichloromethane layer was washed with water. The dichloromethane layer was dried over<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The<br>
residue was purified by distillation under reduced pressure to give cyclohexanone trimethyl<br>
ketal (26.8 g, 55% yield). To the suspension of zirconium chloride (24.9 g, 0.11 mol) 1N<br>
tetrahydrofuran (500 ml) was slowly added sodium borohydride (20.5 g, 0.54 mmol) under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere followed by stirring for 20 minutes at room temperature. A solution of<br>
tetrahydrofuran (170 ml) including cyclohexanone trimethyl ketal (16.9 g, 0.11 mol) obtained<br>
above was added dropwise 1N a nitrogen atmosphere to the reaction solution 1N an ice bath.<br>
After the end of dropping, the reaction solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. To<br>
this reaction solution was added ice-cold 2N hydrochloric acid (600 ml) 1N the ice bath to stop<br>
the reaction, and tetrahydrofuran was evaporated 1N vacuo. The water layer residue was<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate, and the ethyl acetate layer was washed with a saturated aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution. The ethyl acetate layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,<br>
and the solvent was evaporated 1N vacuo. The obtained residue was purified by<br>
chromatography on a silica gel column (elution solvent; hexane : ethyl acetate =10:1-5:2)<br>
to afford 3-cyclohexyloxypropan-1-ol (13.4 g, 78% yield).<br>
The obtained 3-cyclohexyloxypropan-1-ol (11.5 g, 72.9 mmol) was dissolved 1N<br>
dichloromethane (240 ml), and then molecular sieve 4 A (58 g) and pyridinium<br>
chlorochromate (23.8 g, 0.11 mol) were added thereto 1N the ice bath followed by stirring<br>
under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The reaction solution was diluted<br>
with ether, and then the solution was filtered through Celite. The Celite was washed with<br>
diethyl ether, and this filtrate was added to the previous filtrate. The total filtrate was<br>
evaporated 1N vacuo, and the residue was purified roughly by chromatography on a silica gel<br>
column (elution solvent; n-hexane : ethyl acetate = 20 : 1 - 10 : 1) to give a crude 3-<br>
cyclohexyloxypropionaldehyde (8.6 g).<br>
A dichloromethane solution (120 ml) of triphenylphosphine (57.7 g, 0.22 mol) 1N an ice bath<br>
were added dropwise to the dichloromethane solution (120 ml) including carbon tetrabromide<br><br><br>
(36.5 g, 0.11 mol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the end of dropping, the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred for 5 more minutes. To the reaction solution 1N the ice bath was added<br>
dropwise under a nitrogen atmosphere a dichloromethane solution (90 ml) of the crude 3-<br>
cyclohexyloxypropionaldehyde (8.6 g) obtained above, and after dropping, the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred for 25 more minutes. The reaction solution was diluted with<br>
dichloromethane, and washed with a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution<br>
and then with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. After the dichloromethane layer<br>
was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent was evaporated 1N vacuo. The residue<br>
was purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (elution solvent; hexane : ethyl acetate<br>
= 100 : 1 - 33 : 1) to afford 4-cyclohexyloxy-l, 1-dibromobut-1-ene (12.6 g, 55% yield, 2<br>
processes).<br>
To a tetrahydrofuran solution (130 ml) of 4-cyclohexyloxy-l, 1-dibromobut-1-ene (12.6 g,<br>
40.4 mmol) obtained above, was added dropwise under a nitrogen atmosphere at -78Â°C the<br>
hexane solution of 1.5N n-butyllithium (54 ml, 81.0 mmol). After the end of dropping, the<br>
reaction solution was stirred for 1 hour, and then wanned up gradually to room temperature.<br>
After the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 50 minutes, water was added<br>
thereto 1N the ice bath to terminate the reaction. The resulting reaction solution was extracted<br>
with diethyl ether, and the diethyl ether layer was washed with the saturated aqueous sodium<br>
chloride solution. The diethyl ether layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the<br>
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by chromatography<br>
on a silica gel column (elution solvent; hexane : ethyl acetate = 100 : 1 - 50 : 1) to give the<br>
title compound (4.35 g, 71% yield).<br>

Test Example 1<br>
Determination of the Inhibitory Activity against Host versus Graft Reaction (HvGR) 1N the<br>
Rat.<br>
(1) Two strains of rats (Lewis rats (male, 6 weeks old, Charles River Japan) and<br>
WKAH/Hkm (male, 7 weeks old. SLC Japan)) were used. Five rats (host) per group were<br>
used.<br>
(2) Induction of HvGR<br>
The spleen cells were isolated from the spleen of the rats and 1 x 108 cells were suspended 1N the RPMI640 medium (LIFE TECHNOLOGIES, Rockville MD USA). One hundred<br>
microliter (1 x 107 cells) of the spleen cell suspension whose cells were isolated from either<br>
WKAH/Hkm rats or Lewis rats were subcutaneously injected into the bilateral feet pad of the<br>
hindlimbs of the Lewis rat.<br>
(3) Administration of the Compound<br>
The compound was suspended 1N 0.5% tragacanth solution. The suspended compound was<br>
orally administered to rats 1N the drug-treated group (Lewis rats injected with spleen cells<br>
isolated from AH/Hkm rats, and treated with the compound) at a volume of 5 ml/kg. The<br>
treatment was started on the day of the spleen cell injection, once a day, for 4 successive days.<br>
Tragacanth solution (0.5%) was orally administered, instead of the suspension of the test<br>
compound, to the rats 1N the same strain group (Lewis rats injected with spleen cells which<br>
were isolated from the Lewis rats) and to the rats 1N the control group (Lewis rats injected<br>
spleen cells isolated from WKAH/Hkm rats, and not treated with the test compound).<br>
(4) Determination Procedures for Inhibitory Activity against HvGR<br>
The average weight of the popliteal lymph node of the same strain rats was subtracted from<br>
the weight of the popliteal lymph node of the individual rat (popliteal lymph gland weight due<br>
to HvGR). The inhibition rate of the popliteal lymph node weight due to HvGR of the<br>
individual rat treated with the test compound against the average weight of the control rats<br>
was calculated. The inhibitory activity of the test compound was expressed as an ID50 value<br>
(mg/kg) calculated from the dose-inhibition rate by the least square method.<br>
As the results of the present experiment, the compound of the present invention showed an<br>
excellent inhibitory activity against HvGR 1N the rat.<br><br><br>

Determination of the Inhibitory Activity of the Compounds of the Present Invention on<br>
Induction of Adjuvant Arthritis.<br>
1. Preparation of Adjuvant<br>
Heat-killed, Mycobacterium butylricum was suspended 1N mineral oil at a concentration of 2<br>
mg/ml and sonicated with an ultrasonic apparatus.<br>
2. Preparation of the Test Compound.<br>
The test compound was suspended 1N 0.5% Tragacanth solution.<br>
3. Induction of Adjuvant Arthritis<br>
The adjuvant prepared as described 1N 1 was intradermally injected into the right hind paw of<br>
the female rats (usually Lewis rats were used) at a volume of 0.05 ml. Five rats per group<br>
were used. 1N one group of rats, adjuvant was not injected for the control group.<br>
4. Administration of the Compound<br>
The compound solution prepared as described 1N 2 was orally administered to rats from the<br>
injection day of the adjuvant, once daily for 21 days, at a dose of 5 ml/kg. Tragacanth solution<br>
(0.5%) was orally administered to one group of rats treated with adjuvant (the control group)<br>
and also to rats not treated with adjuvant.<br>
5. Calculation methods of Inhibitory Activity of the Compound<br>
The volume of the right hind paw was determined with a plethymometer. The volume of the<br>
intact paw was subtracted from the individual volume, and the difference was used as the<br>
swelling volume. Then the inhibitory activity of the compound was calculated from the<br>
individual swelling volume of rats treated with the compound and that 1N the swelling volume<br>
of the control rats. The ID50 value of the compound was obtained from the doses treated and<br><br><br>
the average inhibitory rate of the group.<br>
From the present experiment, the compound 1N the present invention showed a potent<br>
inhibitory activity.<br>
