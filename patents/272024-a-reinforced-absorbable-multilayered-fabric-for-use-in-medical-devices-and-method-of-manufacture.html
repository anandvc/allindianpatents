	A REINFORCED ABSORBABLE MULTILAYERED FABRIC FOR USE IN<br>
		MEDICAL DEVICES AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5		The present invention relates to a reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric that<br>
	is useful in medical devices and its method of manufacture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		It is generally known to use multilayered fabrics in connection with medical<br>
10	procedures. For example, multilayered fabrics are used as all purpose pads, wound<br>
	dressings, surgical meshes, including hernia repair meshes, adhesion prevention meshes<br>
	and tissue reinforcement meshes, defect closure devices, and hemostats.<br>
		USP 5,593,441 to Lichtenstein et al describes a composite prosthesis preferably<br>
15	having a sheet of polypropylene mesh that allows tissue in-growth, such as Marlex®<br>
	mesh. This reference discloses that other surgical materials that are suitable for tissue<br>
	reinforcement and defect closure may be utilized, including absorbable meshes such as<br>
	a polyglactin 910 (Vicryl®) mesh. The composite prosthesis of Lichtenstein et al also<br>
	has an adhesion barrier, preferably a sheet of silicone elastomer. This reference<br>
20	generally suggests that that an oxidized regenerated cellulose such as Interceed® (TC7)<br>
	absorbable adhesion barrier (commercially available from Ethicon, Inc., in Somerville,<br>
	New Jersey) may be used as the adhesion barrier to produce a composite prosthesis<br>
	having short term effectiveness. The composite prosthesis of Lichtenstein et al is<br>
	described for use in reinforcing and repairing a weakened muscular wall while limiting<br>
25	the incidence of postoperative adhesions.<br>
		USP 5,686,090 to Schilder et al describes the use of a fleece in combination<br>
	with a nonabsorbable or absorbable film to prevent mis-growths to adjacent tissue and<br>
	to reduce adhesions. Schilder et al generally discloses that polypropylene, polyester,<br>
30	polyglactin, polydioxanone or poliglecaprone 25 may be used as the fleece material or<br>
	the film material. The term "fleece" as used in this reference is described by its<br>
	porosity, which is described as being in the range between 100 and 1000 l/(m2s) gas<br>
	flow, measured with an inlet pressure of 200 Pa, a test surface of 50 cm2 and a test<br>
1<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	thickness of 1 mm. The composite of Schilder et al is generally described as being a<br>
	multilayered implant.<br>
		Additionally, multilayered fabrics are useful for tissue engineering and<br>
5	orthopedic applications. The recent emergence of tissue engineering offers numerous<br>
	approaches to repair and regenerate damaged/diseased tissue. Tissue engineering<br>
	strategies have explored the use of biomaterials that ultimately can restore or improve<br>
	tissue function. The use of colonizable and remodelable scaffolding materials has been<br>
	studied extensively as tissue templates, conduits, barriers and reservoirs. In particular,<br>
10	synthetic and natural materials in the form of foams, sponges, gels, hydrogels, textiles,<br>
	and nonwovens have been used in vitro and in vivo to reconstruct/regenerate biological<br>
	tissue, as well as deliver chemotactic agents for inducing tissue growth. The different<br>
	forms of scaffolds may be laminated to form a multilayered tissue engineering scaffold.<br>
15		However, the prior art fails to describe or suggest a reinforced absorbable<br>
	multilayered fabric having a first absorbable nonwoven fabric reinforced by one or<br>
	more second absorbable woven or knitted fabric.<br>
		As used herein, the term "nonwoven fabric" includes, but is not limited to,<br>
20	bonded fabrics, formed fabrics, or engineered fabrics, that are manufactured by<br>
	processes other than weaving or knitting. More specifically, the term "nonwoven<br>
	fabric" refers to a porous, textile-like material, usually in flat sheet form, composed<br>
	primarily or entirely of staple fibers assembled in a web, sheet or batt. The structure of<br>
	the nonwoven fabric is based on the arrangement of, for example, staple fibers that are<br>
25	typically arranged more or less randomly. The tensile, stress-strain and tactile<br>
	properties of the nonwoven fabric ordinarily stem from fiber to fiber friction created by<br>
	entanglement and reinforcement of, for example, staple fibers, and/or from adhesive,<br>
	chemical or physical bonding. Notwithstanding, the raw materials used to manufacture<br>
	the nonwoven fabric may be yarns, scrims, netting, or filaments made by processes that<br>
30	include, weaving or knitting.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	2<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		The present invention is directed to a reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric<br>
	comprising a first absorbable nonwoven fabric reinforced by one or more second<br>
	absorbable woven or knitted fabric, and its method of manuafacture. More<br>
	particularly, the first absorbable nonwoven fabric comprises fibers comprising aliphatic<br>
5	polyester polymers, copolymers, or blends thereof; while the second absorbable woven<br>
	or knitted fabric comprises oxidized regenerated cellulose fibers.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric generally comprises a nonwoven<br>
10	fabric and one or more reinforcement fabric. The reinforcement fabric provides a<br>
	backing to which the nonwoven fabric may be attached, either directly or indirectly.<br>
		The nonwoven fabric functions as the first absorbable nonwoven fabric of the<br>
	reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric described herein. The first absorbable<br>
15	nonwoven fabric is comprised of fibers comprising aliphatic polyester polymers,<br>
	copolymers, or blends thereof. The aliphatic polyesters are typically synthesized in a<br>
	ring opening polymerization of monomers including, but not limited to, lactic acid,<br>
	lactide (including L-, D-, meso and D, L mixtures), glycolic acid, glycolide, ε-<br>
	caprolactone, p-dioxanone (l,4-dioxan-2-one), and trimethylene carbonate (1,3-dioxan-<br>
20	2-one).<br>
		Preferably, the first absorbable nonwoven fabric comprises a copolymer of<br>
	glycolide and lactide, in an amount ranging from about 70 to 95% by molar basis of<br>
	glycolide and the remainder lactide.<br>
25<br>
		In an alternative embodiment, the first absorbable nonwoven fabric comprises<br>
	fibers comprised of aliphatic polyester polymers, copolymers, or blends thereof, alone<br>
	or in combination with oxidized polysaccharide fibers.<br>
30		Preferably, the nonwoven fabric is made by processes other than weaving or<br>
	knitting. For example, the nonwoven fabric may be prepared from yarn, scrims, netting<br>
	or filaments that have been made by processes that include, weaving or knitting. The<br>
3<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	yarn, scrims, netting and/or filaments are crimped to enhance entanglement with each<br>
	other and attachment to the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric. Such crimped<br>
	yarn, scrims, netting and/or filaments may then be cut into staple that is long enough to<br>
	entangle. The staple may be between about 0.1 and 3.0 inches long, preferably between<br>
5	about 0.5 and 2.5 inches, and most preferably between about 1.0 and 1.5 inches. The<br>
	staple may be carded to create a nonwoven batt, which may be then needlepunched or<br>
	calendared into the first absorbable nonwoven fabric. Additionally, the staple may be<br>
	kinked or piled.<br>
10		Other methods known for the production of nonwoven fabrics may be utilized<br>
	and include such processes as air laying, wet forming and stitch bonding. Such<br>
	procedures are generally discussed in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and<br>
	Engineering, Vol. 10, pp. 204-253 (1987) and Introduction to Nonwovens by Albin<br>
	Turbank (Tappi Press, Atlanta GA 1999), both incorporated herein in their entirety by<br>
15	reference.<br>
		The thickness of the nonwoven fabric may range from about 0.25 to 2 mm. The<br>
	basis weight of the nonwoven fabric ranges from about 0.01 to 0.2 g/in2; preferably<br>
	from about 0.03 to 0.1 g/in2; and most preferably from about 0.04 to 0.08 g/in2. The<br>
20	weight percent of first absorbable nonwoven fabric may range from about 10 to 80<br>
	percent, based upon the total weight of the reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric.<br>
		The second absorbable woven or knitted fabric functions as the reinforcement<br>
	fabric and comprises oxidized polysaccharides, in particular oxidized cellulose and the<br>
25	neutralized derivatives thereof. For example, the cellulose may be carboxylic-oxidized<br>
	or aldehyde-oxidized cellulose. More preferably, oxidized regenerated polysaccharides<br>
	including, but without limitation, oxidized regenerated cellulose may be used to prepare<br>
	the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric. Regenerated cellulose is preferred due to<br>
	its higher degree of uniformity versus cellulose that has not been regenerated.<br>
30	Regenerated cellulose and a detailed description of how to make oxidized regenerated<br>
	cellulose are set forth in USP 3,364,200, USP 5,180,398 and USP 4,626,253, the<br>
	contents each of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety.<br>
4<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		Examples of fabrics that may be utilized as the reinforcement fabric include, but<br>
	are not limited to, Interceed® absorbable adhesion barrier, Surgicel® absorbable<br>
	hemostat, Surgicel Nu-Knit® absorbable hemostat and Surgicel® Fibrillar absorbable<br>
5	hemostat (each available from Johnson &amp; Johnson Wound Management Worldwide or<br>
	Gynecare Worldwide, each a division of Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, New Jersey).<br>
		The reinforcement fabric utilized in the present invention may be woven or<br>
	knitted, provided that the fabric possesses the physical properties necessary for use in<br>
10	contemplated applications. Such fabrics, for example, are described in USP 4,626,253,<br>
	USP 5,002,551 and USP 5,007,916, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
	reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
	reinforcement fabric is a warp knitted tricot fabric constructed of bright rayon yarn that<br>
	is subsequently oxidized to include carboxyl or aldehyde moieties in amounts effective<br>
15	to provide the fabrics with biodegradability.<br>
		In an alternative embodiment, the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric<br>
	comprises oxidized polysaccharide fibers in combination with fibers comprised of<br>
	aliphatic polyester polymers, copolymers, or blends thereof.<br>
20<br>
		The second absorbable woven or knitted fabric preferably comprises oxidized<br>
	regenerated cellulose and may have a basis weight ranging from about 0.001 to 0.2<br>
	g/in2, preferably in the range of about 0.01 to 0.1 g/in2, and most preferably in the range<br>
	of about 0.04 to 0.07 g/in2.<br>
25<br>
		The first absorbable nonwoven fabric is attached to the second absorbable<br>
	woven or knitted fabric, either directly or indirectly. For example, the nonwoven fabric<br>
	may be incorporated into the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric via<br>
	needlepunching, calendaring, embossing or hydroentanglement, or chemical or thermal<br>
30	bonding. The staple of the first absorbable nonwoven fabric may be entangled with<br>
	each other and imbedded in the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric. More<br>
	particularly, for methods other than chemical or thermal bonding, the first absorbable<br>
5<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	nonwoven fabric may be attached to the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric such<br>
	that at least about 1% of the staple of the first absorbable nonwoven fabric are exposed<br>
	on the other side of the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric, preferably about 10-<br>
	20% and preferably no greater than about 50%. This ensures that the first absorbable<br>
5	nonwoven fabric and the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric remain joined and<br>
	do not delaminate under normal handling conditions. The reinforced absorbable<br>
	multilayered fabric is uniform such that substantially none of the second absorbable<br>
	woven or knitted fabric is visibly devoid of coverage by the first absorbable nonwoven<br>
	fabric.<br>
10<br>
		One method of making the multilayered fabric described herein is by the<br>
	following process. Absorbable polymer fibers, having a denier per fiber of about 1 to 4,<br>
	may be consolidated to about 80 to 120 denier multifilament yarn and then to about 800<br>
	to 1200 denier yarns, thermally crimped and then cut to a staple having a length<br>
15	between about 0.75 and 2.0 inch. The staple may be fed into a multiroller dry lay<br>
	carding machine one or more times and carded into a uniform nonwoven batt, while<br>
	humidity is maintained between about 20-60% at a room temperature of 15 to 24°C.<br>
	For example, the uniform nonwoven batt may be made using a single cylinder roller-top<br>
	card, having a main cylinder covered by alternate rollers and stripper rolls, where the<br>
20	batt is doffed from the surface of the cylinder by a doffer roller and deposited on a<br>
	collector roll. The batt may be further processed via needlepunching or any other<br>
	means such as calendaring. Thereafter, the first absorbable nonwoven fabric may be<br>
	attached to the second absorbable woven or knitted fabric by various techniques such as<br>
	needlepunching. The reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric may then be scoured by<br>
25	washing in an appropriate solvent and dried under mild conditions for 10-30 minutes.<br>
		It is desirable to control process parameters such as staple length, opening of the<br>
	staple, staple feed rate, and relative humidity. For example, the consolidated yarns may<br>
	have from about 5 to 50 crimps per inch, and preferably from about 10 to 30 crimps per<br>
30	inch. Efficient cutting of the crimped yarns is desirable, as any long and incompletely<br>
	cut staple tends to stick on the carding machine and cause pilling. A preferred range of<br>
6<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	the staple length is from about 05 to 2.5 inches, and more preferably from about 1.0 to<br>
	1.5 inches.<br>
		To optimize uniformity and minimize the build-up of static electricity, the<br>
5	relative humidity may be controlled during batt processing, preferably during carding to<br>
	form the uniform nonwoven batt. Preferably, the nonwoven batt is processed using a<br>
	dry lay carding process at a relative humidity of at least about 20% at a room<br>
	temperature of about 15 to 24°C. For example, the nonwoven batt is processed at a<br>
	relative humidity of from about 40% to 60%.<br>
10<br>
		The multilayered fabric is scoured using solvents suitable to dissolve any spin<br>
	finish. Solvents include, but are not limited to, isopropyl alcohol, hexane, ethyl acetate,<br>
	and methylene chloride. The multilayered fabric is then dried under conditions to<br>
	provide sufficient drying while minimizing shrinkage.<br>
15<br>
		The reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric may have an average thickness of<br>
	between about 0.5 and 3.0 mm, preferably between about 1.00 and 2.5 mm, and most<br>
	preferably between about 1.2 and 2.0 mm. The reported thickness is dependent upon<br>
	the method of thickness measurement. Preferred methods are the ASTM methods<br>
20	(ASTM D5 729-97 and ASTM Dl 777-64) conventionally used for the textile industry in<br>
	general and non-woven in particular. Such methods can be slightly modified and<br>
	appropriately adopted in the present case as described below. The basis weight of the<br>
	reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric is between about 0.05 and 0.25 g/in2,<br>
	preferably between about 0.08 and 0.2 g/in2, and most preferably between about 0.1 and<br>
25	0.18 g/in2. The reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric is uniform such that there is<br>
	no more than about 10% variation (relative standard deviation of the mean) in the basis<br>
	weight or thickness across each square inch.<br>
		Additionally, the nonwoven fabric may comprise biologically active agents,<br>
30	such as hemostatic agents. Hemostatic agents that may be used include, without<br>
	limitation, procoagulant enzymes, proteins and peptides, either naturally occurring,<br>
	recombinant, or synthetic. More specifically, prothrombin, thrombin, fibrinogen, fibrin,<br>
7<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	fibronectin, Factor X/Xa, Factor VII/VIIa, Factor IX/IXa, Factor XI/XIa, Factor<br>
	XII/XIIa, tissue factor, von Willebrand Factor, collagen, elastin, gelatin, synthetic<br>
	peptides having hemostatic activity, derivatives of the above and any combination<br>
	thereof, may be utilized. Preferred hemostatic agents are thrombin and/or fibrinogen<br>
5	and fibrin.<br>
		Alternatively, the reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric may contain<br>
	bioactive agents to aid in the repair or regeneration of tissue. Examples of bioactive<br>
	agents include cell attachment mediators, such as peptide-containing variations of the<br>
10	"RGD" integrin binding sequence known to affect cellular attachment, biologically<br>
	active ligands, and substances that enhance or exclude particular varieties of cellular or<br>
	tissue ingrowth. Examples of such substances include integrin binding sequence,<br>
	ligands, bone morphogenic proteins, epidermal growth factor, IGF-I, IGF-II, TGF-β I-<br>
	III, growth differentiation factor, parathyroid hormone, vascular endothelial growth<br>
15	factor, hyaluronic acid, glycoprotein, lipoprotein, bFGF, TGF-beta superfamily factors,<br>
	BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-12, sonic hedgehog, GDF5, GDF6, GDF8, PDGF,<br>
	recombinant human growth and differentiation factor 5 (rhGDF-5), small molecules<br>
	that affect the upregulation of specific growth factors, tenascin-C, fibronectin,<br>
	thromboelastin, thrombin-derived peptides, heparin-binding domains, and the like.<br>
20<br>
		Bioactive agents may also include biologically derived substance selected from<br>
	the group consisting of demineralized bone matrix (DBM), platelet rich plasma, bone<br>
	marrow aspirate and bone fragments, all of which may be from autogenic, allogenic, or<br>
	xenogenic sources.<br>
25<br>
		In other embodiments, the reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric may<br>
	contain an inorganic filler. The inorganic filler may be selected from alpha-tricalcium<br>
	phosphate, beta-tricalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, calcium<br>
	sulfate, barium sulfate, hydroxyapatite, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments<br>
30	the inorganic filler comprises a polymorph of calcium phosphate such as a phosphate<br>
	glass.<br>
8<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		In yet another embodiment, the reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric can<br>
	be seeded or cultured with appropriate cell types prior to implantation for the targeted<br>
	tissue. Cells which can be seeded or cultured on the matrices of the current invention<br>
	include, but are not limited to, bone marrow cells, stromal cells, stem cells, embryonic<br>
5	stem cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, pluripotent<br>
	cells, chondrocyte progenitors, endothelial cells, macrophages, leukocytes, 5<br>
	adipocytes, monocytes, plasma cells, mast cells, umbilical cord cells,, postpartum<br>
	derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, epithelial cells, myoblasts, and precursor cells<br>
	derived from adipose tissue.<br>
10<br>
		The cells can be seeded on the multilayered fabric for a short period of time,<br>
	e.g. less than one day, just prior to implantation, or cultured for longer a period, e.g.<br>
	greater than one day, to allow for cell proliferation and matrix synthesis within the<br>
	seeded fabric prior to implantation.<br>
15<br>
		Additionally, the nonwoven fabric may comprise pharmacologically and<br>
	biologically active agents, including but not limited to, wound healing agents,<br>
	antibacterial agents, antimicrobial agents, growth factors, analgesic and anesthetic<br>
	agents. When used as a tissue scaffold, the reinforced absorbable multilayer fabric<br>
20	may be seeded or cultured with appropriate cell types prior to implantation for the<br>
	targeted tissue.<br>
		The reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric can be used as a scaffold in tissue<br>
	repair and regeneration applications. Examples of tissue repair and regeneration<br>
25	include rotator cuff repair, repair of damaged knee cartilage, and regeneration of skin,<br>
	muscle, or bone lost due to disease or injury.<br>
		The method for using the reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric is to: first<br>
	prepare a repair site for implantation, and then dispose the fabric at the site of repair.<br>
30	The fabric may be attached to the site of repair with sutures, tacks, or any of a number<br>
	of biocompatible glues.<br>

	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	Example 1. Nonwoven PGL fabric with ORC fabric.<br>
		Poly (glycolide-co-lactide) (PGL, 90/10 mol/mol) was melt-spun into fiber. A<br>
	multi-filament yarn was consolidated, crimped and cut into staple having a length of<br>
	1.75 inches. The staple was carded to create a nonwoven batt and then compacted to a<br>
5	thickness of about 1.25 mm and a density of about 98.1 mg/cc. The nonwoven fabric<br>
	was then needlepunched into a knitted carboxylic-oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)<br>
	fabric, available from Ethicon, Inc., under the tradename Interceed®, to secure the<br>
	nonwoven fabric to the ORC fabric. The final multilayered fabric comprised about 60<br>
	weight percent of the nonwoven fabric.<br>

10<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		Poly (glycolide-co-lactide) (PGL, 90/10 mol/mol) was melt-spun into fiber. A<br>
	80 denier multifilament yarn was consolidated into a 800 denier consolidated yarn. The<br>
	consolidated yarn was crimped at approximately 110 °C. The crimped yarn was cut into<br>
	staple having a length of about 1.25" in length. 20 g of the crimped staple was<br>
5	accurately weighed and laid out uniformly on the feed conveyor belt of a multi-roller<br>
	carding machine. The environmental conditions (temp: 21°C /55% RH) were<br>
	controlled. The staple was then carded to create a nonwoven batt. The batt was<br>
	removed from the pick-up roller and cut into 4 equal parts. These were re-fed into the<br>
	carder perpendicular to the collection direction. After this second pass the batt was<br>
10	weighed (19.8 g: 99% fabric yield) and then compacted into a felt. The compact felt<br>
	was precisely laid onto an ORC fabric and firmly attached via 2 passes in the<br>
	needlepunching equipment. The multilayered fabric was trimmed and scoured in 3<br>
	discrete isopropyl alcohol baths to remove spin finish and any machine oils. The<br>
	scoured multilayered fabric was dried in an oven at 70 °C for 30 minutes, cooled and<br>
15	weighed.<br>
		The "thickness" of the multilayered fabric was measured as described herein.<br>
	The measurement tools were:<br>
20	(1)	Mitutoyo Absolute gauge Model number ID-C125EB [Code number- 543-<br>
	452B]. The 1" diameter foot was used on the gauge.<br>
	(2)	A magnetic holder was used to lock in place and set the caliper up to the die<br>
	platen.<br>
	(3)	Two metal plates ~ 2.75" x 2" x 0.60", weighing between 40.8g to<br>
25	41.5g [combined total of ~82.18g].<br>
	The multilayered fabric was placed on a platen surface that is a smooth and machined<br>
	surface. The two metal plates were placed on top of each other on the multilayered<br>
	fabric and gently pressed at their corners to make sure the multilayered fabric is flat.<br>
30	The gauge foot was placed onto the top of the metal plates and was then re-lifted and<br>
	re-placed, at which time a reading was made.<br>
11<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	12 -1" X 1" pieces were die-cut from the scoured multilayered fabric and accurately<br>
	weighed. The thickness of each 1" X 1" piece was measured 4 -5 times in different<br>
	areas of the metal plate in order to obtain a reliable average. The weight and thickness<br>
	of each piece is shown in Table 1. The values indicate that the coverage of both layers<br>
5	is similar in all directions.<br>

10	Example 5. Effect of humidity on processing of polyglactin 910 staple.<br>
		80 denier polyglactin 910 consolidated yarn was crimped and cut into 1.75 inch<br>
	staple. Room temperature was maintained between 21-22 °C and the relative humidity<br>
	was controlled by a room humidifier and varied from 36-60%. No additional means of<br>
	static control were employed for this series of runs. Crimped staple was carded into a<br>
15	batt approximately 32"x8". The percent of staple incorporated into the batt after two<br>
	passes through the carding machine, i.e., the yield, increased with increasing humidity,<br>
	and the quality of the batt improved with yield.<br>

20	Example 7. Poly (glycolide-co-lactide) (PGL, 90/10 mol/mol) was melt-spun into<br>
	fiber. A 80 denier multifilament yarn was consolidated into a 800 denier consolidated<br>
	yarn. The consolidated yarn was crimped at approximately 110 °C. The crimped yarn<br>
13<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	was cut into staple having a length of about 1.25" in length. 44 g of the crimped staple<br>
	was accurately weighed after conditioning the yarn for about 30 minutes in a high<br>
	humidity environment (&gt;55% RH). The yarn was laid out uniformly on the feed<br>
	conveyor belt of a multi-roller carding machine. The feed time (5minutes) was<br>
5	accurately controlled to within 30-45 seconds. The environmental conditions (temp:<br>
	21°C /25% RH) were recorded. Static bars were employed near the 2nd Randomiser<br>
	roller as well as near the steel pick up roller and were turned on during the run to<br>
	minimize the detrimental impact of static generation on the uniformity and yield of the<br>
	resulting batt. The staple was then carded to create a nonwoven batt. Two vacuum<br>
10	inlets were strategically placed near the two edges of the 2nd Randomizer roller to<br>
	control the width of the ensuing batt. The batt was removed from the pick-up roller and<br>
	weighed (41g: 91% yield). The uniform batt was precisely laid onto an ORC fabric<br>
	and firmly attached via a single pass in the needlepunching equipment. The needle<br>
	penetration depth was controlled at 12 mm. The multilayered fabric was trimmed and<br>
15	scoured on a rack (along with other similarly produced sheets) suspended in a tank<br>
	containing isopropyl alcohol to remove spin finish and any machine oils. The scoured<br>
	multilayered fabric (matrix sheet) was calendered to remove excess solvent and dried in<br>
	an oven at 70°C for app. 30 minutes, cooled and weighed.<br>
20	Example 8.<br>
	The matrix sheet as described has an off-white/beige color on both sides. One side may<br>
	be described as the non-woven side where as the other side as the knitted fabric side.<br>
	For certain application, it may be vital to identify the non-woven versus knitted surfaces<br>
	of the matrix. Under difficult environmental conditions, the similarity in color and<br>
25	texture (to some extent) makes it difficult to identify one side from the other. Several<br>
	means were employed to impart sidedness to the matrix sheet, which enables the<br>
	observer to distinguish the 2 sides apart. These means include physical<br>
	(stitching/knitting, braiding, pleating, etc), thermo-mechanical (heat, heat embossing;<br>
	laser etching; etc) and chromic (use of a dye) means may be employed to achieve<br>
30	sidedness. The following examples describe some of the means:<br>
14<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
	8a) The matrix sheet was modified on the knitted fabric side by attaching a lmm wide 4<br>
	inch long braided tape of the polyglactin 910 fiber. The tapes although successful in<br>
	imparting sidedness add to the amount of the longer resorbing Polyglactin 910.<br>
5	8 b) A web made of dyed nylon fiber was placed under the knitted fabric and the non-<br>
	woven batt during the needle-punching step. The web is secured to the knitted fabric<br>
	side due to the needling process. The web affords excellent sidedness and if available<br>
	in an absorbable material, could be used to make completely resorbable, implantable<br>
	matrix sheets. The web (mesh) can be secured similarly on the non-woven side. Other<br>
10	means of securing the web may be thermo-mechanical in nature. Inclusion of such a<br>
	web can be for the reason of mechanical enforcement as well. In such cases the web<br>
	could be secured on either side or even between the two layers. Such a reinforced<br>
	structure may have multiple applications.<br>
15	8 c) The small amount of Polyglactin 910 that resides on the knitted fabric side (due to<br>
	the needle-punching step) of the matrix sheet can be thermally modified to create<br>
	sidedness. This can include heating under pressure such that a shiny film of Polyglactin<br>
	910 is formed. Other options include heat embossing a discernible pattern. Both<br>
	approaches achieve sidedness but may result in thermal degradation of the<br>
20	polymer/construct<br>
	8 d). The knitted ORC fabric, prior to the needle-punching step is pleated (vertical or<br>
	horizontal pleats). The pleats are stabilized by using heat and pressure. The pleated<br>
	fabric is then used in place of the regular fabric for the rest of the process as described<br>
25	in Example 7. The resulting matrix sheet has distinct stripes that achieve the sidedness.<br>
	8 e) Dyed Polyglactin 910 creates matrix sheet that is colored on the non-woven side<br>
	and off-white/beige on the other. This construct achieves sidedness. A dye can be used<br>
	similarly by employing a dyed suture thread etc. on the knitted side. The suture<br>
30	(braided into a tape or used as is) may be sewed in or thermally bonded.<br>
	Example 9. Rotator cuff repair using reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric.<br>
15<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		In the case of a rotator cuff problem, the surgeon first looks at the extent<br>
	of an injury using an arthroscope. Then, under general anesthesia, the patient<br>
	undergoes open surgery to repair the tear.<br>
5		After the anesthetic has been administered and the shoulder has been<br>
	prepared, a cosmetic incision is made over the top front corner of the shoulder.<br>
	This incision allows access to the seam between the front and middle parts of<br>
	the deltoid muscle. Splitting this seam allows access to the rotator cuff without<br>
	detaching or damaging the important deltoid muscle, which is responsible for a<br>
10	significant portion of the shoulder's power. All scar tissue is removed from the<br>
	space beneath the deltoid and the acromion (part of the shoulder blade to which<br>
	the deltoid attaches). Thickened bursa and the rough edges of the rotator cuff<br>
	and humerus (upper arm bone) are also smoothed to make sure that they pass<br>
	smoothly beneath the acromion and deltoid.<br>
15<br>
		The edges of the cuff tendons are identified and the quality and quantity<br>
	of the cuff tissue is determined. The goal of the repair is to reattach good<br>
	quality tendon to the location on the arm bone from which it was torn. A groove<br>
	or trough is fashioned in the normal attachment site for the cuff. To support the<br>
20	tendon and aid in healing, the surgeon sutures a patch of reinforced absorbable<br>
	multilayered fabric into place over it. Sutures (lengths of surgical thread) draw<br>
	the edge of the tendon securely into the groove to which it is to heal.<br>
		The surgeon then completes the surgery by closing the deltoid muscle<br>
25	and the skin incision. Over time, the body creates new tissue in the area that<br>
	matches surrounding tissue. The body also absorbs the implanted patch in two<br>
	to four months.<br>
	Example 10. Knee cartilage repair using reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric.<br>
30		First, the surgeon examines the knee through an arthroscope - a small device<br>
	that allows the doctor to see into your knee joint. If a lesion is detected, a surgical<br>
	procedure is performed.<br>
16<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		After the anesthetic has been administered and the knee has been prepared, a<br>
	cosmetic incision is made through the skin over the top front corner of the patella.<br>
	First, the damaged cartilage is removed. The reinforced absorbable multilayered fabric<br>
5	is then implanted into the lesion. The fabric may be attached to the lesion site with<br>
	sutures, tacks, or any of a number of biocompatible glues.<br>
		The surgeon then completes the surgery by closing the skin incision. Cartilage<br>
	cells migrate into and multiply in the implanted fabric, and the cell/fabric implant<br>
10	intergrates with surrounding cartilage. With time, the cells will mature and fill-in the<br>
	lesion with hyaline cartilage.<br>
	Example 11: Tissue repair usingjeinforced absorbable multilayered fabric.<br>
		Goat cartilage was harvested from femoral condyles of 1 to 1-1/2 year old goat<br>
15	knees. A first set of 5-millimeter diameter discs were made from the cartilage using a<br>
	punch. The cartilage discs were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing<br>
	antibiotic and antimycotics, then rinsed in PBS. Separately, a second set of 5-<br>
	millimeter diameter discs were made from ORC/Polyglactin multilayered fabric formed<br>
	as described in Example 1 and sterilized by Ethylene Oxide (EtO).<br>
20<br>
		The fabric discs were placed in between two cartilage discs and bonded<br>
	together with bovine fibrin glue. Constructs were implanted subcutaneously in SCID<br>
	mice. Six weeks following implantation, samples were collected and processed for<br>
	histology. Histological slides were assessed for repair tissue in the fabric discs by<br>
25	Hematoxylin /Eosin and Safranin O staining.<br>
		Results showed that cells had migrated into the scaffolds and formed new repair<br>
	tissue. At this time point the repair tissue was fibrous in nature.<br>
30	Example 12: Tissue repair usingjeinforced absorbable multilayered fabric having a<br>
	bioactive agent<br>
17<br><br>
	ETH5172FOREIGN1<br>
		Constructs for SCID implantation were prepared similar to that described for<br>
	Example 11 with the exception that the ORC/Polyglactin composites were loaded with<br>
	2.5 micrograms of recombinant human growth and differentiation factor 5 (rhGDF-5)<br>
	and lyophilized. Constructs were implanted in SCID mice and processed similar to<br>
5	Example 11. Histological slides were assessed for repair tissue in scaffolds by<br>
	Hematoxylin/Eosin and Safranin O staining.<br>
		Results showed that cells had migrated into the scaffolds and formed new repair<br>
	tissue. In the presence of the growth factor new cartilage like repair tissue was formed<br>
10	within the scaffolds. This repair tissue stained positive for Safranin O a stain specific<br>
	for sulfated proteoglycans.<br>

	not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention, but rather as contributing to<br>
