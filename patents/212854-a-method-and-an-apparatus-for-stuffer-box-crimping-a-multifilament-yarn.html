METHOD AMD DEVICE FOR STUFFER CRIMPING<br>
The invention relates to a method for staffer box crimping a multifilament yarn as defined in the preamble of claim 1, and a device for carrying out the method as defined in the preamble of claim 12.<br>
Both the method and the device for carrying out the method are known from EP 0 539 808 Bl,<br>
A multifilament synthetic endless yarn is advanced into a crimping device by means of a feed nozzle•  To this end, the feed nozzle comprises an injector, which introduces a pressure fluid into a conveying channel of the feed nozzle.  The crimp effect is based on  heating the yarn with the use of a heated conveying medium, jamming it in a stuffer box downstream of the feed nozzle, and forming a plug thereof.  The heated conveying medium is able to escape through holes provided in the stuffer box.  The yarn plug is removed from the stuffer box, at a defined speed, by a delivery roll downstream of the crimping device, and subsequently cooled.<br>
The use of the flow channel of the feed nozzle, which is disclosed in EP 0 539 808 Bl and constructed as a Laval nozzle, enables stuffer box crimping methods with yarn supply speeds as high as 4000 m/min.  In particular, this increase is realized without raising the pressure of the conveying medium.<br><br>
A further increase of the yarn speed requires a higher pressure of the conveying medium, since otherwise the yarn tension that is built up in the conveying nozzle, will not suffice to draw the yarn still reliably into the crimping device.  An increased pressure of the conveying medium, however, results on the other hand in that the yarn plug is blown out of the stuffer box, since the frictional forces between the yarn plug and the stuffer box wall are no longer adequate.  Moreover, in the case of high speeds and in particular in the case of low deniers, it is no longer possible to use the feed roll downstream of the crimping device because of the risk of lap formation.<br>
DE 21 16 274 B2 discloses a further device, wherein a feed nozzle and a crimping device cooperate. To this end, the conveying channel is provided directly upstream of the inlet to the stuffer box of the crimping device with a relief zone, in which the conveying fluid flowing within the conveying channel is able to expand.  In this process, the yarn is bulked by loosening the filament bundle.  Thus, the known device has the disadvantage that at higher yarn speeds and, with that, at higher fluid pressures, the expanded filament bundle gets hung up in the transitional region between the relief chamber and the last section of the yarn channel, and that thus an unwanted yarn plug forms already in the relief chamber.  A further disadvantage of the known device lies in that the yarn is deposited in the stuffer box only as a function of the conveying fluid that is carried along in the last portion of the yarn channel.  A defined conveyance of the yarn into the stuffer box does not occur.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to further develop the method and device of the described<br><br>
type for stuffer box crimping a multifilament yarn such that on the one hand high yarn speeds are made possible, and that on the other hand a yarn can be produced with a high and stable crimp.<br>
This object is accomplished by the method of the invention with the characterizing steps of claim 1, as well as by the device of the invention with the characterizing features of claim 12.<br>
The invention has the special advantage that the yarn is advanced to the crimping device in two successive conveying steps,  A first conveying step is designed such that the yarn is drawn into the device at a high yarn speed.  In the first step, the yarn speed is named intake speed.  In the second conveying step, which immediately follows the first conveying step, the yarn already advancing at a high speed is fed into the crimping device at a conveying speed.  In this process, the conveying speed in the second step is at least the same as, or greater than the intake speed of the first step.  This ensures that the tension in the yarn does not fall below a minimum, so that the filament bundle remains closed between the two steps,  A further advantage of the invention lies in that the delivery of the yarn into the stuffer box can be substantially directed only to the requirements of the plug formation.  The intake of the yarn for building up high yarn speeds is produced by the conveying fluid stream in the first step.<br>
The method of the present invention is especially suitable for very high yarn speeds, with the intake speed being at least 3,000 m/min., preferably at least 4,000 m/min.  In this process, it is preferred to withdraw the yarn from a spin zone by means of a draw system, and that after being drawn, the yarn is<br><br>
received by the conveying nozzle of the first step. However, it is also possible to withdraw the yarn from a feed yarn package.  Regardless of the way of making the yarn available, the intake speed of the yarn in the first step needs to be directed toward the end that an adequate tension of the advancing yarn does not fall below, for example, 10 cN.<br>
To be able to perform process variations, which are needed, for example, because of different polyester materials, the first conveying fluid stream in the first step and the second conveying fluid stream in the second step are controlled independently of each other.  This permits making fine adjustments both for building up a yarn tension in the upstream yarn path and for the crimp formation in the stuffer box.<br>
To produce the conveying fluid streams, the conveying fluid of the first step is maintained under a pressure from at least 2 bars to at most 15 bars, preferably from at least 4 bars to at most 12 bars.  In comparison therewith the pressure of the conveying fluid for producing the second conveying stream is adjusted to a small range from at least 1 bar to at most 8 bars, preferably from at least 2 bars to at most 6 bars.  In general, however, it is essential that the pressure of the conveying fluid in the first step assume a greater value than the pressure of the conveying fluid in the second step.  In this instance, the exact adjustment values are likewise dependent on the foregoing parameters, such as, for example, the type of polymer, yarn tension, crimp formation, etc.<br>
In an especially advantageous further development of the invention, the conveying fluid for the first conveying fluid stream and for the second conveying fluid stream is introduced by a common<br><br>
injector.  To this end, an expansion chamber is formed between the feed nozzles, in which the outlet of the conveying channel of the first feed nozzle and the inlet of the conveying channel of the second feed nozzle terminate.  The expansion chamber connects to a controllable throttle valve, so that it is possible to discharge a portion of the first conveying fluid stream that enters the expansion chamber.  Thus, the portion of the first conveying stream that remains within the expansion chamber, is used for producing the second conveying fluid stream in the subsequent conveying channel.  The controllable throttle valve permits adjusting the discharged conveying fluid stream.<br>
In tests that were performed by the method of the present invention, it was possible to realize in the case of a predrawn polyester yarn of the specification 167f46 and 83f36, at yarn delivery speeds of 5,100 m/min,, a crimp of 25% and a crimp stability of 85% with a yarn tension of 4 cN/dtex.  The values for crimp and crimp stability were determined in accordance with DIN [German Industrial Standards] 53 840 Part 1.<br>
In the case of a predrawn polyamide yarn of the specification 83f34, it was possible to realize at yarn delivery speeds of 4,500 m/min., a crimp of 20% and a crimp stability of 90% with a yarn tension of 4 cN/dtex.<br>
Particularly suitable as a conveying fluid medium is hot air.  It showed that the crimp of the yarn becomes greater as the hot air temperature increases.  An upper limit of 18°C was found for polyester and 240°C for polyamide.<br>
still better crimp values are obtained with overheated, if possible, dry vapor.<br><br>
To ensure a reliable plug formation in the stuffer box even at the high yarn speeds, it is advantageous to discharge the conveying fluid stream by means of a vacuum through openings in the front region of the stuffer box.<br>
At the beginning of the process, it is possible to introduce at times a fluid through an opening in the rear region of the stuffer box against the direction of the yarn movement, and to thus exert a braking effect on the yarn, thereby initiating the plug formation in the stuffer box.<br>
To carry out the method, the device of the present invention comprises two feed nozzles, each with a nozzle-shaped conveying channel.  Both feed nozzles follow each other in the direction of the advancing yarn such that the outlet of the one conveying channel is directly opposite to the inlet of the second conveying channel.  This permits producing through the feed nozzles two conveying fluid streams independently of each other for taking in the yarn in a first step, and transporting it in a second, downstream step into the stuffer box of the crimping device-<br>
In this connection, it is possible that each of the feed nozzles has an injector for introducing one fluid stream each into the associated conveying channels.  The injectors can be supplied individually or jointly by a controllable source of pressure.  In the case of a joint supply from a source of pressure, means for adjusting the pressure are to be provided separately-<br>
However, it is also possible to interconnect the feed nozzles such that they are jointly supplied by one injector.<br><br>
In this connection, it will be especially advantageous, when the feed nozzles are interconnected such that an expansion chamber is formed between the conveying channels, with the outlet cross section of the conveying channel terminating in the expansion chamber being greater than the narrowest cross section of the subsequent conveying channel, so that a transportation of the conveying fluid into the subsequent conveying channel remains ensured.  In this case, the expansion chamber connects to a controllable throttle valve.<br>
To be able to produce, if possible, a high tension on the yarn as it is taken in, the conveying channel formed in the first feed nozzle, is configured preferably as a Laval nozzle, so that the conveying fluid is able to reach sonic speed in a narrowest cross section of the Laval nozzle.  To ensure a uniform jamming of the yarn inside the stuffer box, the conveying channel of the second feed nozzle terminates directly in the stuffer box.<br>
In this connection, it will be especially advantageous, when the outlet of the conveying channel and the inlet of the stuffer box are arranged in a vacuum chamber.  The stuffer box connects via opening slots to the vacuum chamber, which is hooked up to a controllable source of vacuum.  This further development of the invention offers a further possibility of adjusting the second conveying fluid stream.<br>
For cooling the yarn plug leaving the stuffer box, a cooling drum is arranged preferably downstream of the crimping device.  In this arrangement, the yarn plug is guided over the circumference of the cooling<br><br>
drum and cooled by a cooling medium, preferably cooling air.<br>
In the following an embodiment is described in greater detail with reference to the attached drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an arrangement with a device according to the invention for carrying out the method of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view of a first embodiment of a device for carrying out the method of the invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of a further embodiment for carrying out the method of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of an arrangement with a device according to the invention for carrying out the method of the invention.  In this embodiment, a yarn 1 is fed in the direction of advance 2.  The yarn 1 can be supplied directly from a spinning device or from a feed yarn package.  When viewed in the direction of the advancing yarn, the arrangement comprises a first godet unit 3, a subsequent pair of godets 4, as well as a stuffer box crimping device 5. The stuffer box crimping device 5 is followed by a cooling drum 7.  A further godet unit 8 is provided in the yarn path downstream of the cooling drum 7.<br>
in the illustrated arrangement, the godet unit 3, which consists of a driven godet and a guide roll, withdraws the yarn 1 from a spinning device or a feed yarn package.  The yarn 1 is drawn between the godet unit 3 and the pair of godets 4, which is formed by two driven godets.  Preferably, at least one of the godets is heated.  Subsequently, the yarn 1 is taken into the stuffer box crimping device 5, advanced, and<br><br>
formed to a yarn plug 6.  In the crimping device, the yarn is crimped to the yarn plug 6 while being exposed to hot air or vapor, and while forming loops.  The yarn plug is then cooled in a cooling zone,   which is a cooling drum.  in the present embodiment,  in this process, the crimp is set.  The godet unit 8 withdraws the yarn from the cooling drum 7.  In so doing, the yarn plug 6 is again disentangled, while maintaining, however, the crimp of the filaments.<br>
A first e.mbodiment of the stuffer box crimping device as schematically shown in Figure 1, is illustrated in a schematic sectional view in Figure 2. The stuffer box crimping device 5 comprises a first feed nozzle 24, a second feed nozzle 25, and a crimping device 26.  The feed nozzles 24 and 25, as well as the crimping device 26 are combined to one structural part. The feed nozzle 24 includes a nozzle-shaped conveying channel 13, which connects on its upper side to a yarn inlet 9 and on its underside to an expansion chamber 14.  Preferably, the conveying channel 13 is designed and constructed as a Laval nozzle.  In the inlet region of conveying channel 13, the feed nozzle 24 includes an injector 12, which connects, via a supply line 11 to a source of pressure not shown.  The injector 12 terminates in conveying channel 13 with a plurality of injector bores.<br>
Directly downstream of the first feed nozzle 24 is the second feed nozzle 25.  The feed nozzle 25 comprises a conveying channel 16, which terminates on its upper side in expansion chamber 14, and connects on its underside to a stuffer box 17 of crimping device 26.  Between the conveying channel 13 of the first feed nozzle 24 and the conveying channel 16 of the second feed nozzle 25, the expansion chamber 14 extends, which<br><br>
is coupled with a throttle valve 27 via a relief channel 15.<br>
Downstream of the second feed nozzle 25 is the crimping device 26, which comprises a staffer box 17.  In its upper region, the stuffer box 17 is surrounded by a vacuum chamber 19, which connects to a source of vacuum 20.  The stuffer box 17 and vacuum chamber 19 are interconnected via a plurality of slot-shaped openings 18.  To this end, the slot-shaped openings 18 are arranged in the cylindrical wall of stuffer box 17 in the region of vacuum chamber 19. Outside of the vacuum chamber 19, an outlet opening 21 of the stuffer box 17 is formed.<br>
In the device illustrated in Figure 2, the yarn 1 is drawn at an intake speed into the conveying channel 13 through inlet 9.  To this end, a conveying fluid 10 is introduced into the conveying channel 13 via a supply line 11.  The pressure of the conveying fluid 10 in supply line 11 is rated such that the intake speed of yarn 1 maintains an adequate yarn tension at the yarn inlet 9.  Within conveying channel 13, the conveying fluid 10 is formed to a first conveying fluid stream, which advances the yarn 1. The conveying fluid stream and the yarn 1 advance through conveying channel 13, which is designed and constructed as a Laval nozzle in the present embodiment.  In the expansion chamber 14, the conveying fluid stream expands, and the pressure of conveying fluid 10 decreases.  In addition, a partial stream of the conveying fluid is discharged through relief channel 15 via throttle valve 27.  The amount of partial stream 10*1 is adjustable via throttle valve 27,  A remaining partial stream 10.2 is made to a second conveying fluid stream by means of conveying<br><br>
channel 16 of the second feed nozzle 25, which advances the yarn 1 at a conveying speed into the stuffer box 17.  In this connection, the pressure in expansion chamber 14 is rated such that the second conveying fluid stream generates a conveying speed of the yarn, which is at least the same as, however preferably greater than the intake speed of the yarn.  This produces between the steps a tension in the yarn, which prevents the filament bundle from unraveling prematurely, and thus ensures a reliable, continued transportation of the yarn into the stuffer box 17. While after its exit from conveying channel 16, the main portion of the second conveying fluid stream 10.3 is discharged through opening slots 18, the yarn 1 jams while forming loops, and forms a yarn plug 6.  As shown in the present embodiment, the removal the conveying fluid can be assisted by the vacuum chamber 19, from which the conveying fluid is discharged by means of the source of vacuum 20.  The yarn plug 6 leaves the crimping device through outlet opening 21 of stuffer box 17.<br>
At the start of the crimping process, it can happen that the yarn 1 is initially not jammed in the stuffer box 17 to form a yarn plug 6.  To initiate the jamming, a braking fluid 22 is supplied via an inlet opening 23 into the stuffer box 17 such that the braking fluid 22 exerts a decelerating effect on the yarn 1, and thus initiates the jamming for forming the plug 6,<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates a further embodiment of a stuffer box crimping device, as could be used, for example, in the arrangement of Figure 1. The stuffer box crimping device consists, for example, of a first feed nozzle 24, a second feed nozzle 25, and<br><br>
a crimping device 26,  In this embodiment, the feed nozzle 24 is realized as a separate component.  The feed nozzle 25 and crimping device 26 are integrated to one component.<br>
In their construction, the feed nozzle 24 and the crimping device 26 are identical with the embodiment of Figure 2.  Insofar, the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
At a small distance from, or directly downstream of the feed nozzle 24, the second feed nozzle 25 is arranged.  The feed nozzle 25 includes a nozzle-shaped conveying channel 16, which connects on its upper side to a yarn inlet 9.2, and on its underside to the stuffer box 17 of crimping device 26. An injector 12.2 is associated with conveying channel 16,  The injector 12.2 connects via a supply line 11.2 to a source of pressure not shown.  Via the supply line 11.2 and injector 12.2 a conveying fluid under pressure is introduced into conveying channel 16.  The conveying fluid is caused to form a conveying fluid stream, which advances the yarn 1 through the conveying channel 16 into the stuffer box 17.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, the conveying fluid stream is formed in feed nozzle 24 by the conveying fluid, which is supplied by injector 12,1 into conveying channel 13-  The second conveying fluid stream in feed nozzle 25 is formed by the conveying fluid, which is introduced into the conveying channel 16 by injector 12.2.  The operation of the embodiment of the stuffer box crimping device of Figure 3 is identical with the foregoing embodiment, so that the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Both the method of the invention and the device of the invention distinguish themselves in that two conveying fluid streams that can be produced independently of each other are used for taking in the yarn and for conveying it into the stuffer box.  It is thus possible to select the pressure of the supplied fluid, while taking the yarn 1 into the stuffer box crimping device, in such a manner that a minimal yarn tension remains intact.  In this connection, pressures of as much as 15 bars are possible.  Contrary thereto, the fluid for conveying the yarn into the stuffer box is rated in its pressure such that it ensures a reliable plug formation inside the stuffer box.  The pressure of the fluid for conveying the yarn is adjusted, preferably to a value from 2 bars to at most 6 bars.  The method of the invention is suitable for all types of polyester.  In particular, it is possible to use yarns of polyester, polyamide, or polypropylene. All types of polyester are suitable, such as, for example, PET, PPT, or PTT,  By the method of the invention, it has been possible to achieve, for example, from a polyester yarn of the specification 167f46 and 63f36, a crimp of 25% at yarn delivery speeds of 5,100 m/min, and a crimp stability of 65% with a yarn tension of 4 cN/dtex,  With that, it is made possible to produce in particular crimped textile yarns directly from freshly spun filaments in one process step.<br><br>
