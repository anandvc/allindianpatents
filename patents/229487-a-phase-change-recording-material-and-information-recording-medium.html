				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A PHASE-CHANGE RECORDING MATERIAL AND INFORMATION RECORDING<br>
MEDIUM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a phase-change<br>
recording material and an information recording medium<br>
employing it.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a recording method utilizing the phase change, a<br>
method has been known wherein the crystal structure of a<br>
metal or a semiconductor is reversibly changed by<br>
affecting energy beams or an energy flow such as light or<br>
electric current (Joule heat) (Appl. Phys. lett., Vol. 18<br>
(1971), pp. 254-257, U.S. Patent 3,530,441).<br>
Used practically at present as a means for recording<br>
on an information recording medium employing a phase-<br>
change type recording material, is a means to utilize a<br>
reversible change between the crystalline phase and the<br>
amorphous phase. Specifically, it is a means to let the<br>
crystalline state in a non-recorded/erased state and to<br>
form amorphous marks at the time of recording. Usually,<br>
a recording layer is locally heated to a temperature<br>
higher than the melting point and then rapidly cooled to<br>
form amorphous marks. On the other hand, the recording<br>
layer is heated at a temperature of approximately at most<br><br>
the melting point and at least the crystallization<br>
temperature, and slowly cooled so that the recording<br>
layer is kept at a temperature of at most the<br>
crystallization temperature for a certain retention time<br>
to carry out recrystallization. Namely, in general, a<br>
reversible change between the stable crystalline phase<br>
and the amorphous phase is utilized, and the information<br>
is recorded or retrieved by detecting the difference in<br>
physical parameters such as refractive index, electric<br>
resistance, volume and change in density, between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state.<br>
On the optical information recording medium among<br>
information recording mediums, recording and retrieving<br>
is carried out by utilizing a change in the reflectivity<br>
accompanying the reversible change between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state caused locally<br>
by irradiation with a focused light beam. Such an<br>
optical information recording medium having a phase-<br>
change type recording layer is being developed and used<br>
practically as a low cost large capacity recording medium<br>
excellent in portability, weather resistance, impact<br>
resistance, etc. For example, a rewritable phase-change<br>
type optical information recording medium (hereinafter a<br>
phase-change type optical information recording medium<br>
may sometimes be referred to simply as "phase-change type<br>
optical disk", "optical disk" or "disk") such as CD-RW,<br>
DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM is widely used. Further, it<br><br>
has been developed to achieve a high density by the use<br>
of blue laser or by an increase in NA of an objective<br>
lens, or to make high speed recording possible by<br>
improvement of the recording pulse waveform.<br>
As a material for such a phase-change type recording<br>
layer, a chalcogenide alloy is used in many cases. As<br>
such a chalcogenide alloy, a Ge-Sb-Te type, In-Sb-Te<br>
type, Ge-Sn-Te type or Ag-In-Sb-Te type alloy may, for<br>
example, be mentioned. Such an alloy is usually an<br>
overwritable material also.<br>
Here, overwriting is a means wherein when recording<br>
is carried out again on a once-recorded medium, writing<br>
is carried out without erasing before the recording, that<br>
is, a means of recording while erasing. On a phase-<br>
change type optical information recording medium,<br>
recording is carried out usually by overwriting, and<br>
accordingly recording while erasing (i.e. overwriting)<br>
may sometimes be referred to simply as recording.<br>
In recent years, along with increase in the amount<br>
of information, it has been desired to develop an<br>
information recording medium (particularly optical<br>
information recording medium) on which recording, erasing<br>
and retrieving at a higher speed are possible. As a<br>
material capable of satisfying both characteristics of<br>
excellent jitter characteristics and storage stability of<br>
amorphous marks even in such very high speed recording, a<br>
material containing as the main component a ternary<br><br>
composition of Sb-Ge-In is mentioned (JP-A-2001-39031,<br>
JP-A-2002-347341). This material is promising as a<br>
material to be used for a phase-change type optical disk<br>
on which high speed recording and erasing of information<br>
signals are carried out at a reference clock period of at<br>
most 15 ns.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, there is such a problem that repeated<br>
recording durability of the above material containing as<br>
the main component a ternary composition of Sb-Ge-In has<br>
to be further increased.<br>
For example, CD-RW is guaranteed to have repeated<br>
recording durability for 10 0 0 times in many cases (to<br>
insure the repeated recording 1000 times, it is required<br>
that repeated recording about 2000 times is possible on<br>
CD-RW) . On the other hand, of CD-RW employing the above<br>
ternary composition of Sb-Ge-In as the recording<br>
material, when the number of repeated recording is<br>
evaluated from a practical viewpoint, the upper limit of<br>
the number of repeated recording may be about 1000 times<br>
in some cases.<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the<br>
above problems, and the object is to provide a phase-<br>
change recording material on which high speed<br>
recording/erasing speed is possible, which has excellent<br>
jitter characteristics, which has a high storage<br><br>
stability of the recording signals, and which is<br>
excellent in repeated recording durability, and an<br>
information recording medium employing the above<br>
material. Particularly, it is to provide an optical<br>
information recording medium which is one mode of the<br>
applications of the information recording medium.<br>
Under these circumstances, the present inventors<br>
have conducted extensive studies and as a result, found<br>
that by adding at least either lanthanoid or Te to the<br>
above ternary composition, both characteristics of jitter<br>
characteristics against high speed recording/erasing and<br>
storage stability of the recording signals are satisfied,<br>
and further the repeated durability is remarkably<br>
improved, and achieved the present invention.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, the embodiments of the present invention will<br>
be explained in detail. However, the present invention<br>
is not limited to the following embodiments, and various<br>
modifications are possible within the range of the gists.<br>
[1] Phase-change recording material<br>
The phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention contains a composition represented by the<br><br>
following formula (1) as the main component:<br>
{ (Sb1-xGex) 1-yIny} 1-Z-wMzTew (1)<br>
wherein x, y, z and w are numbers satisfying 0 . 001oc≤X≤0 . 3 ,<br>
0≤y≤0.4, 0≤z≤0.2 and 0≤w≤0.1, and M is at least one<br>
element selected from lanthanoids, provided that z and w<br>
are not 0 at the same time. Further, each of x, y, z and<br>
w is an atomicity ratio.<br>
The phases-change recording material of the present<br>
invention is characterized in that at least either<br>
lanthanoid or Te is added in a predetermined proportion<br>
to the specific composition of Sb-Ge-In type. The phase-<br>
change recording material of the present invention has<br>
such effects that it is excellent in the repeated<br>
recording durability, in addition to the jitter<br>
characteristics and the storage stability of the<br>
recording signals.<br>
It has already been disclosed by one of the present<br>
inventors that the Sb-Ge-In type alloy is such a<br>
recording material that it is stable in either<br>
crystalline or amorphous state, and the phase change<br>
between these states at a relatively high speed is<br>
possible, and that an optical information recording<br>
medium having a recording layer employing the Sb-Ge-In<br>
type alloy in a specific composition exhibits excellent<br>
jitter characteristics and storage stability of the<br>
recording signals (JP-A-2001-39031). With respect to the<br>
above points, the present inventors have found that the<br><br>
Sb-Ge-In type alloy is excellent as a phase-change<br>
recording material as follows.<br>
Namely, since the crystallization speed of Sb is<br>
high, amorphous marks cannot be formed under the<br>
recording conditions which are employed for common<br>
optical disks, however, the crystallization speed becomes<br>
low when Ge is mixed with Sb. Accordingly, by mixing Ge<br>
with Sb, the crystallization speed can be adjusted to<br>
achieve a recordable crystallization speed.<br>
However, in an optical information recording medium<br>
having a recording layer employing a composition having<br>
Ge mixed with Sb, the jitters of the recorded signal tend<br>
to be significant. Accordingly, a phase-change recording<br>
material having Ge mixed with Sb is problematic for<br>
practical use. In fact, a phase-change type recording<br>
material of Sb-Ge type alloy has been discussed in<br>
literatures such as Appl. Phys. Lett. 60(25), 22 June<br>
1992, pp. 3123 to 3125. However, the present inventors<br>
have conducted recording on an optical disk employing the<br>
Sb-Ge type alloy for the recording layer under general<br>
recording conditions and conducted evaluation and as a<br>
result, although recording on the optical disk was<br>
possible, the jitters of the recording signal were<br>
significantly high, and the optical disk was not<br>
practicable. Accordingly, as a result of further<br>
studies, the present inventors have found that by adding<br>
an appropriate amount of In to the above Sb-Ge type<br><br>
alloy, the jitter characteristics of the recording<br>
signals become favorable, and found that the composition<br>
of a Sb-Ge-In type alloy is favorable as the phase-change<br>
recording material.<br>
However, as a result of further studies by the<br>
present inventors, it was found that of the phase-change<br>
recording material having a composition of a Sb-Ge-In<br>
type alloy, the crystallization speed tends to gradually<br>
decrease as compared with the initial one by carrying out<br>
repeated recording. Namely, repeated recording is<br>
carried out several thousands times on the phase-change<br>
recording material having a composition of a Sb-Ge-In<br>
type alloy, due to the above decrease in the<br>
crystallization speed, previously recorded amorphous<br>
marks are not adequately erased. Thus, the jitter<br>
characteristics tend to deteriorate due to the<br>
insufficient erasure of the amorphous marks. This<br>
tendency is remarkable when the In content is high.<br>
The present invention has been made particularly to<br>
overcome the above tendency, and makes it possible to<br>
increase the repeated recording durability (for example,<br>
the jitter characteristics when repeated recording is<br>
carried out) by adding at least either lanthanoid or Te<br>
in a specific composition. The reason why the repeated<br>
recording durability improves by addition of such a metal<br>
element is not clearly understood, but is supposed as<br>
follows.<br><br>
Namely, in the phase-change recording material<br>
having a composition of a Sb-Ge-In type alloy, in a case<br>
where a quick change in the temperature occurs by the<br>
repeated recording, a phenomenon similar to segregation<br>
may occur in some cases. If the segregation occurs, the<br>
crystallization speed tends to be low, and thus<br>
previously recorded amorphous marks may not be erased and<br>
remain in some cases. By the presence of a portion in<br>
which the amorphous marks are not erased, the jitter<br>
characteristics tend to deteriorate. It is supposed that<br>
by adding at least either lanthanoid or Te in a specific<br>
composition to the Sb-Ge-In type phase-change recording<br>
material, segregation is less likely to occur even if<br>
repeated recording is carried out, and such a phenomenon<br>
that the crystallization speed becomes low due to the<br>
repeated recording is less likely to occur. It is<br>
estimated that an optical information recording medium<br>
employing as the recording layer a phase-change recording<br>
material having at least either lanthanoid or Te added in<br>
a specific composition to the Sb-Ge-In type phase-change<br>
recording material (such as CD-RW) can maintain the<br>
initial crystallization speed even after repeated<br>
recording about 2 000 times.<br>
In the present invention, "containing a<br>
predetermined composition as the main component" means<br>
that the content of the above predetermined composition<br>
is at least 50 atomic% based on the entire materials or<br><br>
the entire layer in which the predetermined composition<br>
is contained. In order to further obtain the effect of<br>
the present invention, the above predetermined<br>
composition is contained in an amount of preferably at<br>
least 80 atomic%, more preferably at least 90 atomic%,<br>
particularly preferably at least 95 atomic%.<br>
Further, in the present invention, it is preferred<br>
that of the phase-change recording material, the<br>
crystalline state corresponds to a non-recorded state and<br>
the amorphous state corresponds to a recorded state.<br>
This is because it is supposed that not many crystal<br>
nuclei are present in the phase-change recording material<br>
of the present invention. That is, in a case where the<br>
amorphous state corresponds to a non-recorded state and<br>
crystalline state marks are formed in this amorphous<br>
state, it is preferred to use a phase-change recording<br>
material in which many crystal nuclei are present. This<br>
is because when a large number of crystal nuclei are<br>
present in the phase-change recording material, the shape<br>
of the crystalline state marks is less likely to be<br>
influenced by the position of the crystal nuclei. On the<br>
other hand, as described above, not many crystal nuclei<br>
are present in the phase-change recording material of the<br>
present invention, and accordingly favorable recording is<br>
likely to be carried out when the crystal state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state and amorphous state<br>
recording marks are formed in the crystalline state,<br><br>
rather than when the amorphous state corresponds to a<br>
non-recorded state and crystalline state recording marks<br>
are formed in the amorphous state.<br>
In order that the phase-change recording material of<br>
the present invention realizes excellent repeated<br>
recording durability in addition to the jitter<br>
characteristics and the storage stability of the<br>
recording signals, it is necessary that the respective<br>
metal elements as the main component are used in a<br>
specific composition. Detailed explanation will be made<br>
below.<br>
(Sb, Ge)<br>
The Ge amount based on the total amount of Sb and<br>
Ge, i.e. x in the above formula (1) is at least 0.0 01 and<br>
at most 0.3. Ge has a function to reduce the<br>
crystallization speed, to facilitate formation of an<br>
amorphous phase and to increase the storage stability of<br>
the amorphous phase. Accordingly, if the Ge content is<br>
low, the crystallization speed tends to be too high,<br>
whereby it becomes difficult to form the amorphous phase,<br>
or the storage stability of the amorphous phase tends to<br>
be insufficient in some cases. Accordingly, it is<br>
required that Ge is contained in a predetermined amount<br>
or more, and thus 0.001≤x in the above formula (1).<br>
Preferably 0.005≤x, more preferably O.Ol≤X, furthermore<br>
preferably 0.02≤x, particularly preferably 0.03≤x.<br>
On the other hand, if the Ge content is too high,<br><br>
the crystallization speed tends to be too low, and the<br>
erasure of the amorphous marks (crystallization) may not<br>
be carried out in some cases. Accordingly, in the above<br>
formula (1), x≤0.3 . With a view to controlling the<br>
crystallization speed favorably, it is preferred that<br>
x≤O.25, more preferably x≤0 . 2 , furthermore preferably<br>
x≤O.15, particularly preferably x≤O.1.<br>
(In)<br>
When In is contained, the signal amplitude tends to<br>
be high, and such an effect can be obtained that the<br>
jitter characteristics is improved. If the content is<br>
too low, the improving effect may not be obtained in some<br>
cases, and thus y indicating the content of In in the<br>
above formula (1) is 0≤y. Preferably 0≤y, more<br>
preferably 0.01≤y, furthermore preferably 0.05≤y,<br>
particularly preferably 0.l≤y, most preferably 0.15 ≤y.<br>
On the other hand, if the In content is too high, an In-<br>
Sb type stable crystalline phase having a low<br>
reflectivity (low reflectivity crystalline phase) may be<br>
always formed other than the crystalline phase to be used<br>
for recording in some cases, and in such a case, a phase<br>
change does not occur at all and recording cannot be<br>
carried out. Accordingly, y indicating the In content in<br>
the above formula (1) is y
preferably y≤0.3, furthermore preferably y
particularly preferably y
recording power tends to be low when the In content is<br><br>
high, and thus the above range is preferred.<br>
(Lanthanoid)<br>
The content of the lanthanoid is at least 0 and at<br>
most 0.2 in the above formula (1). Namely, z indicating<br>
the content of the lanthanoid in the above formula (1) is<br>
0≤z≤0.2.<br>
In a case where a lanthanoid is contained, the<br>
decrease in the crystallization speed due to the repeated<br>
recording is suppressed. In order to obtain this effect,<br>
in a case where Te is not contained, 0<z in the above></z>
formula (1) . Also with a view to suppressing the<br>
decrease in the crystallization speed due to the repeated<br>
recording, it is preferred that 0<z more preferably></z>
0.005≤z, furthermore preferably O.Ol≤z, particularly<br>
preferably 0.02≤2. The lanthanoid is supposed to have a<br>
role to increase the crystallization speed of the phase-<br>
change recording material when the repeated recording is<br>
carried out. Accordingly, it is supposed that when a<br>
lanthanoid is added to the phase-change recording<br>
material having the composition of the Sb-Ge-In type<br>
alloy of which the crystallization speed tends to be low<br>
by the repeated recording, the decrease in the<br>
crystallization speed due to the repeated recording will<br>
be suppressed. As mentioned above, the lanthanoid has a<br>
role to increase the crystallization speed of the phase-<br>
change recording material at the time of repeated<br>
recording, and thus if the amount of the lanthanoid is<br><br>
large, the crystallization speed may become higher than<br>
initial one by the repeated recording in some cases.<br>
On the other hand, if the content of the lanthanoid<br>
is too high, the initial crystallization tends to be<br>
difficult, the initial crystallization speed tends to be<br>
too low, or the signal amplitude tends to be low.<br>
Accordingly, in the above formula (1), z≤0 .2, and it is<br>
preferably z≤O.15, more preferably z≤O.l, furthermore<br>
preferably z≤O.07. As compared with a case where Te is<br>
added as mentioned hereinafter, the decrease in the<br>
signal amplitude is small when a lanthanoid is added, and<br>
thus addition of a lanthanoid is preferred from this<br>
viewpoint.<br>
A lanthanoid represents 15 elements of La, Ce, Pr,<br>
Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu. Such<br>
lanthanoids are. a series in which the 4f orbital is<br>
sequentially filled in view of the electron configuration<br>
and have similar properties, and are preferred. Among<br>
these lanthanoids, preferred is at least any of Eu, Gd,<br>
Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu, and more preferred is Gd<br>
or Tb. By using the above lanthanoid, the change in the<br>
crystallization speed at the time of repeated recording<br>
can be suppressed. The lanthanoid may be used alone or<br>
in combination as a mixture of at least two.<br>
(Te)<br>
The Te content is at least 0 and at most 0.1 in the<br>
above formula (1). Namely, w indicating the Te content<br><br><br>
in the above formula (1) is 0≤w≤.0 .1.<br>
Also in a case where Te is added, the decrease in<br>
the crystallization speed due to the repeated recording<br>
is suppressed. In order to obtain this effect, in a case<br>
where no lanthanoid is contained, 0<w in the above></w>
formula (1) . Also with a view to suppressing the<br>
decrease in the crystallization speed due to the repeated<br>
recording, it is preferably 0≤w, more preferably 0.005≤w,<br>
furthermore preferably 0.01≤w, particularly preferably<br>
0.02≤w.<br>
On the other hand, the reflectivity of the medium<br>
and the signal amplitude tend to be low by addition of<br>
Te, and thus in the above formula, w≤0.1, and it is<br>
preferably w≤0.09, more preferably w≤O.08, furthermore<br>
preferably w≤0.07, particularly preferably w≤0.06.<br>
(Relation between In and lanthanoid)<br>
Of the phase-change recording material of the<br>
present invention, the decrease in the crystallization<br>
speed due to the repeated recording tends to be<br>
significant if the In content in the phase-change<br>
recording material is high. On the other hand, the<br>
crystallization speed due to the repeated recording tends<br>
to be high if the content of the lanthanoid in the phase-<br>
change recording material is high. Accordingly, in order<br>
to reduce the change in the crystallization speed due to<br>
the repeated recording, it is preferred to control the<br>
relation of In and lanthanoid contents.<br><br>
From such a viewpoint, z/y in the above formula (1)<br>
is usually at least 0.001, preferably at least 0.01,<br>
more preferably at least 0.0.5, furthermore preferably<br>
at least 0.1, most preferably at least 0.15. The change in<br>
the crystallization speed at the time of repeated recording<br>
can be made small within this range.<br>
Further, z/y in the above formula (1) is preferably<br>
at most 1, more preferably at most 0.7, furthermore<br>
preferably at most 0.5, particularly preferably at most<br>
0.3, most preferably at most 0.25. Within this range,<br>
not only the initial crystallization (initialization<br>
carried out for the first time after production of an<br>
information recording medium) can be carried out<br>
favorably, but also the signal amplitude can be<br>
maintained high..<br>
(Relation of In and Te)<br>
With respect to the phase-change recording material<br>
of the present invention, the signal amplitude tends to<br>
decrease when Te is contained. Accordingly, in a case<br>
where Te is contained, favorable signal amplitude can be<br>
obtained by incorporating In in a large amount.<br>
Accordingly, the ratio of the In content (atomic%) to the<br>
Te content (atomic%) is preferably (In content)&gt;(Te<br>
content), more preferably (In content)&gt;1.5x(Te content),<br>
furthermore preferably (In content)&gt;2x(Te content),<br>
particularly preferably (In content)&gt;3x(Te content), most<br><br>
preferably (In content)&gt;3.5x(Te content). On the other<br>
hand, with a view to securing the signal amplitude,<br>
usually (In content)
content)
(Relation between lanthanoid and Te)<br>
To the phase-change recording material of the<br>
present invention, at least either lanthanoid or Te is<br>
added. Namely, either lanthanoid or Te may be used, or<br>
both may be used as combined. Such an effect that the<br>
decrease in the crystallization speed due to the repeated<br>
recording is suppressed can be obtained by addition of<br>
such an element, and in order to more securely obtain<br>
such an effect, z+w is preferably at least 0.01, more<br>
preferably at least 0.02. On the other hand, if<br>
lanthanoid or Te is contained excessively, the signal<br>
amplitude may decrease, or the initial crystallization<br>
may be difficult in some cases. Accordingly, z+w is<br>
usually at most 0.3, and it is preferably at most 0.25,<br>
more preferably at most 0.2, furthermore preferably at<br>
most 0.15, particularly preferably at most 0.1.<br>
The lanthanoid has such properties that it increases<br>
the crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material during the repeated recording. Accordingly, by<br>
addition of the lanthanoid, the decrease in the<br>
crystallization speed due to the repeated recording of<br>
the composition of the Sb-Ge-In type alloy will be<br>
suppressed. On the other hand, if the lanthanoid is<br><br>
contained in an excessively large amount, the initial<br>
crystallization tends to be difficult.<br>
Te makes it possible to suppress the decrease in the<br>
crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material due to the repeated recording. On the other<br>
hand, if Te is contained in an excessively large amount,<br>
the reflectivity of the medium and the signal amplitude<br>
tend to be low.<br>
As mentioned above, the lanthanoid and Te have an<br>
effect to suppress the decrease in the crystallization<br>
speed of the phase-change recording material due to the<br>
repeated recording, and on the other hand, they have<br>
different properties to make the initial crystallization<br>
difficult and to reduce the reflectivity of the medium<br>
and the signal amplitude, respectively. Accordingly,<br>
when the lanthanoid and Te are used together and their<br>
contents are controlled within the above range, the<br>
initial crystallization can be carried out favorably and<br>
the reflectivity of the medium and the signal amplitude<br>
can be made favorable, while suppressing the decrease in<br>
the crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material due to the repeated recording.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, it is<br>
preferred to use the lanthanoid and Te together.<br>
(Other matters)<br>
The recording/erasing is carried out usually by<br>
irradiating the recording layer with a laser beam spot<br><br>
radiated from the light irradiation portion while<br>
rotating the medium at a high speed, and relatively<br>
moving the light irradiation portion and the medium at a<br>
high speed. The case where the relative speed of<br>
movement is high is referred to as a state where the<br>
recording linear velocity (recording velocity) is high,<br>
and the case where the relative speed of movement is low<br>
is referred to as a state where the recording linear<br>
velocity (recording velocity) is low.<br>
In a state where the recording linear velocity is<br>
high, after the recording layer is once heated by the<br>
laser beam spot, it is rapidly cooled. Namely, the<br>
temperature history of the recording layer is in a<br>
quenching manner, and the higher the recording linear<br>
velocity, the more the amorphous phase is likely to be<br>
formed, and the less the crystalline phase is likely to<br>
be formed, on the recording layer having the same<br>
composition.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred to adjust the amounts<br>
of Ge, In and the lanthanoid within the above ranges of<br>
the contents depending upon the recording linear<br>
velocity, for example, to increase the crystallization<br>
speed in a medium of which the desired recording linear<br>
velocity is higher, and to reduce the crystallization<br>
speed in a medium of which the desired recording linear<br>
velocity is low.<br>
In order to improve various characteristics, Au, Ag,<br><br>
Al, Ga, Zn, Sn, Si, Cu, Mn, Pd, Pt, Rh, Pb, Cr, Co, Mo,<br>
W, Mn, 0, N, Se, V, Nb, Ta, Ti, Bi or the like may be<br>
added to the phase-change recording material as the case<br>
requires. In order to obtain the effect of improving the<br>
characteristics, the addition amount is preferably at<br>
least 0.1 at.% (atomic%) of the entire composition of the<br>
alloy. However, it is preferably at most 10 at.% so as .<br>
not to impair the preferred characteristics of the<br>
composition of the present invention.<br>
[2] Information recording medium<br>
Now, the information recording medium of the present<br>
invention will be explained below.<br>
The information recording medium of the present<br>
invention is an information recording medium having a<br>
recording layer and is characterized in that the<br>
recording layer has the composition represented by the<br>
following formula (1) as the main component:<br>
{ (Sb1-xGex) 1-YIny} 1-z-wMzTew (1)<br>
wherein x, y, z and w are numbers satisfying 0.001≤x≤0.3,<br>
0≤y≤0.4, 0≤z≤0.2 and 0≤w≤0.1, and M is at least one<br>
element selected from lanthanoids, provided that z and w<br>
are not 0 at the same time.<br>
In the present invention, the information recording<br>
medium is preferably such that the crystalline state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state, and the amorphous<br>
state corresponds to a recorded state. This is because<br>
it is estimated that not many crystal nuclei are present<br><br>
in the recording layer composition of the present<br>
invention. Namely, in a case where the amorphous state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state and crystalline state<br>
marks are formed in the amorphous state, it is preferred<br>
to use a recording layer composition in which many<br>
crystal nuclei are present. This is because when a large<br>
number of crystal nuclei are present in the recording<br>
layer, the shape of the crystalline state marks is less<br>
likely to be influenced by the position of the crystal<br>
nuclei. On the other hand, as described above, not many<br>
crystal nuclei are present in the recording layer<br>
composition of the present invention, and accordingly<br>
favorable recording is likely to be carried out when the<br>
crystal state corresponds to a non-recorded state and<br>
amorphous state recording marks are formed in the<br>
crystalline state, rather than when the amorphous state<br>
corresponds to a non-recorded state and crystalline state<br>
recording marks are formed in the amorphous state.<br>
By using the composition presented by the above<br>
formula (1) as the recording layer, an information<br>
recording medium having excellent recording<br>
characteristics such as the jitter characteristics, the<br>
storage stability of the amorphous marks and the repeated<br>
recording durability even at an ultrahigh speed recording<br>
can be realized.<br>
Such an information recording medium is not<br>
particularly limited so long as recording and retrieving<br><br>
of information are carried out by detecting the<br>
difference in physical parameters as between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state, and an<br>
information recording medium detecting the difference in<br>
the reflectivity, the electrical resistance, the volume,<br>
the change in density or the like may, for example, be<br>
mentioned. Particularly, the information recording<br>
medium employing the phase-change recording material of<br>
the present invention is suitable for an application to<br>
an optical information recording medium utilizing a<br>
change in the reflectivity due to a reversible change<br>
between the crystalline state and the amorphous state<br>
caused by irradiation with a laser beam.<br>
Further, the information recording medium of the<br>
present invention may be applied to an information<br>
recording medium utilizing a change in the electrical<br>
resistivity due to a reversible change between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state utilizing Joule<br>
heat generated by the electric current flow.<br>
Now, as one example of the information recording<br>
medium of the present invention, the specific structure<br>
of the optical information recording medium and the<br>
recording/retrieving method will be explained. Further,<br>
as another example of the information recording medium of<br>
the present invention, a case where the information<br>
recording medium of the present invention is used for an<br>
application other than the optical information recording<br><br>
medium will also be explained below.<br>
[2-1] Optical information recording medium<br>
(Layer structure)<br>
As the optical information recording medium, usually<br>
one having a multilayer structure as shown in Fig. l(a)<br>
or Fig. 1(b) is employed. Namely, it is preferred that<br>
on a substrate, a recording layer having a composition,<br>
represented by the above formula (1) as the main<br>
component is formed, and a protective layer is further<br>
formed, as evident from Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b).<br>
The more preferred layer structure of the optical<br>
information recording medium is such a structure that a<br>
first protective layer, a recording layer, a second<br>
protective layer and a reflective layer are formed in<br>
this order along the incident direction of the retrieving<br>
laser beam. Namely, in a case where the retrieving laser<br>
beam enters from the substrate side, preferred is a layer<br>
structure of a substrate, a first protective layer (lower<br>
protective layer), a recording layer, a second protective<br>
layer (upper protective layer) and a reflective layer<br>
(Fig. l(a)), and in a case where the retrieving laser<br>
beam enters from the recording layer side, preferred is a<br>
layer structure of a substrate, a reflective layer, a<br>
second protective layer (lower protective layer), a<br>
recording layer and a first protective layer (upper<br>
protective layer) (Fig. 1(b)).<br>
Needless to say, each layer may consists of at least<br><br>
two layers, and an interlayer may be formed between the<br>
respective layers. For example, between the substrate<br>
and the protective layer when the retrieving laser beam<br>
enters from the substrate side, or on the protective<br>
layer when the retrieving laser beam enters from the side<br>
opposite to the substrate, a translucent and extremely<br>
thin metal, semiconductor or dielectric layer having<br>
absorption, etc. may be formed so as to control the<br>
amount of the laser energy which enters the recording<br>
layer.<br>
Further, a reflective layer is formed on the side<br>
opposite to the incident side of the recording/retrieving<br>
laser beam in many cases as mentioned above, but this<br>
reflective layer is not essential. Further, the<br>
protective layer which is preferably formed on at least<br>
one side of the recording layer may be made to have a<br>
multilayer structure with materials having different<br>
characteristics.<br>
Now, the respective layers will be explained in<br>
detail.<br>
(A) Recording layer<br>
(A-l) Materials contained in recording layer and their<br>
amount<br>
The materials contained in the recording layer<br>
comprise a composition represented by the above formula<br>
(1) as the main component. This composition was already<br>
explained in detail, and the explanation is omitted here.<br><br>
In order to effectively obtain the effect of the present<br>
invention, the composition represented by the above<br>
formula (1) is contained usually in an amount of at least<br>
50 atomic%, preferably at least 80 atomic%, more<br>
preferably at least 90 atomic%, particularly preferably<br>
at least 95 atomic%, based on the entire recording layer.<br>
The higher the content is, the more remarkably the effect<br>
of the present invention can be obtained. However, even<br>
if another component such as 0 or N is contained at the<br>
time of film formation of the recording layer, the<br>
effects of the present invention such as high speed<br>
recording/erasing can be obtained when the content is<br>
within a range of from several atomic% to 20 atomic!.<br>
(A-2) Film thickness of recording layer<br>
The thickness of the recording layer is usually at<br>
least 1 nm, preferably at least 3 nm, more preferably at<br>
least 5 nm, particularly preferably at least 10 nm. With<br>
such a thickness, the contrast of the reflectivity<br>
between the crystalline state and the amorphous state<br>
will be adequate, and the crystallization speed will be<br>
adequate, whereby it will be possible to erase the record<br>
in a short time. Further, the reflectivity itself will<br>
be adequate. On the other hand, the thickness of the<br>
recording layer is usually at most 3 0 nm, preferably at<br>
most 2 5 nm, more preferably at most 2 0 nm, furthermore<br>
preferably at most 15 nm, still furthermore preferably at<br>
most 12 nm, particularly preferably at most 11 nm. With<br><br>
such a thickness, an adequate optical contrast will be<br>
obtained, and cracks are less likely to form on the<br>
recording layer. Further, no deterioration of the<br>
recording sensitivity due to increase in the thermal<br>
capacity will occur. Further, within the above film<br>
thickness range, the volume change due to the phase<br>
change can be moderately suppressed, and microscopic and<br>
irreversible deformation of the recording layer itself or<br>
the protective layer to be formed on or below the<br>
recording layer, which may cause noises when recording is<br>
repeatedly carried out, is less likely to be accumulated.<br>
Such accumulation of the deformation tends to decrease<br>
the repeated recording durability, and by bringing the<br>
film thickness of the recording layer to be within the<br>
above range, this tendency can be suppressed.<br>
In a case where recording/retrieving is carried out<br>
by means of a focused laser beam of an object lens having<br>
a numerical aperture of from about 0.6 to about 0.65 from<br>
a LD (laser diode) having a wavelength of about 6 50 nm,<br>
such as rewritable DVD, or for a high density medium on<br>
which recording/retrieving is carried out by means of a<br>
focused laser beam of an object lens having a numerical<br>
aperture of from about 0.7 to about 0.85 from a blue LD<br>
having a wavelength of about 400 nm, the requirement<br>
against noises is more strict, and accordingly in such a<br>
case, the more preferred thickness of the recording layer<br>
is at most 25 nm.<br><br>
(A-l) More preferred embodiment regarding recording layer<br>
film thickness<br>
In the present invention, it is considered that with<br>
respect to an optical information recording medium having<br>
a recording layer containing the composition represented<br>
by the above formula (1) as the main component, on which<br>
high speed recording/erasing is possible, by making the<br>
film thickness of the recording layer extremely thin, the<br>
recording characteristics at the second recording after<br>
the optical information recording medium is stored for a<br>
long time can be made favorable and the decrease in the<br>
reflectivity after the long term storage can be reduced.<br>
Specifically, it seems that by making the film thickness<br>
of the recording layer preferably at most 11 run, of the<br>
optical information recording medium employing the<br>
recording layer having a composition represented by the<br>
above formula (1), the recording characteristics at the<br>
second recording after long term storage tend to be<br>
improved, and the decrease in the reflectivity after long<br>
term storage tend to be reduced.<br>
Regarding the optical information recording medium<br>
employing the recording layer having a composition<br>
represented by the above formula (1), the jitter at the<br>
second recording after long term storage is somewhat poor<br>
in some cases. The reason is not necessarily clear, but<br>
is considered to relate to the tendency for the signal<br>
intensity at the first recording after the long term<br><br>
storage to be low. Namely, when recording is carried out<br>
after the optical information recording medium is stored<br>
for a long time, a signal amplitude at the first<br>
recording tends to be low. The signal amplitude recovers<br>
by further carrying out recording several times, and<br>
accordingly, the decrease in the signal amplitude at the<br>
first recording is considered to be caused by that the<br>
recording mark is less likely to be large when the<br>
crystalline portion after the long term storage is<br>
changed into an amorphous state for the first time.<br>
Further, the reason why the jitter is likely to<br>
deteriorate at the second recording after the long term<br>
storage is considered to be because a portion which is<br>
changed into an amorphous state for the first time after<br>
the long term storage (a portion which is not irradiated<br>
with a recording laser beam at the first recording) and a<br>
portion which is changed into an amorphous state again<br>
(for a second time) are both present. Namely, it is<br>
considered that there is a dispersion of the size of the<br>
amorphous marks due to the above presence of two phases<br>
in the second recording.<br>
Further, the cause of the tendency for the amorphous<br>
marks to be less likely to be large at the time of the<br>
first recording after the long term storage is not clear,<br>
but is considered that a certain change occurs at the<br>
crystalline portion of the recording layer by the long<br>
term storage, since the characteristics recover after<br><br>
several recordings. By making the recording layer<br>
extremely thin (preferably at most 11 run) , the<br>
characteristics at the second recording after the long<br>
term storage are improved, and this is considered to be<br>
because the above change at the recording layer<br>
crystalline portion tends to be suppressed.<br>
Further, by making the recording layer extremely<br>
thin (preferably at most 11 nm), the decrease in the<br>
reflectivity by the long term storage tends to be<br>
suppressed. The reason is not clear also, however, it is<br>
considered that the change of the recording layer after<br>
the long term storage is suppressed, similar to the<br>
improvement of the recording characteristics at the<br>
second recording after the long term storage.<br>
However, if the recording layer is made extremely<br>
thin, the recording characteristics such as the signal<br>
amplitude may be impaired in some cases. However,<br>
regarding this point, the recording characteristics such<br>
as the signal amplitude can be brought to an adequately<br>
satisfactory level by adjusting the layer structure of<br>
the optical information recording medium and the film<br>
thickness.<br>
Namely, in a case of the optical information<br>
recording medium wherein a protective layer, a recording<br>
layer having a composition represented by the above<br>
formula (1), a protective layer and a reflective layer<br>
are formed on a substrate in this order or in the<br><br>
opposite order, the signal intensity tends to be low when<br>
the film thickness of the recording layer is made<br>
extremely thin (thinner than about 12 nm for example).<br>
Accordingly, in a case where the recording layer is made<br>
extremely thin (at most 11 nm for example), a device is<br>
required to obtain a high signal intensity.<br>
For example, one method is to change the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer located on the side<br>
from which the laser beam enters the recording layer.<br>
Namely, the film thickness of the protective layer is<br>
made thinner than the film thickness of the protective<br>
layer with which the reflectivity of the optical<br>
information recording medium reaches the minimum value.<br>
The film thickness at which the reflectivity reaches the<br>
minimum value varies depending upon the laser wavelength<br>
to be used, however, it is in the vicinity of 50 nm at<br>
the film thickness in the vicinity of 650 nm in DVD. By<br>
employing such a film thickness, the signal intensity<br>
becomes optically high.<br>
However, it is known that when the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer on the laser beam incident side<br>
becomes thin, the thermal influence over e.g. the<br>
substrate tends to be significant, and the repeated<br>
recording durability tends to deteriorate in general.<br>
Accordingly, the above method of making the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer thin (in the vicinity<br>
of 50 nm for example) can be hardly employed. It is<br><br>
considered that an adequate repeated recording durability<br>
of an optical information recording medium can be<br>
obtained by employing a protective layer A (a protective<br>
layer containing a metal oxysulfide or a metal nitride)<br>
as described hereinafter for the entire protective layer<br>
or by employing the protective layer A as described<br>
hereinafter for the protective layer region of the<br>
protective layer which is in contact with the recording<br>
layer, even if the film thickness of the protective layer<br>
on the side from which the laser beam enters relative to<br>
the recording layer is made thin (at most 50 nm for<br>
example), against the above tendency. The details about<br>
the protective layer A will be explained below.<br>
Under the above situation, the film thickness of the<br>
recording layer of the present embodiment is preferably<br>
at most 15 nm, more preferably at most 14 nm, furthermore<br>
preferably at most 13 nm, particularly preferably at most<br>
12 nm, most preferably at most 11 nm.<br>
On the other hand, as mentioned above, also in a<br>
case where the film thickness of the recording layer is<br>
made extremely thin in order to improve the recording<br>
characteristics after the long term storage, no adequate<br>
signal intensity can be obtained even by adjusting the<br>
layers other than the recording layer if the film<br>
thickness of the recording layer is excessively thin.<br>
The lower limit of the signal intensity depends on the<br>
performance of the retrieving apparatus, and in a case of<br><br>
rewritable DVD, the signal intensity tends to be low and<br>
the use tends to be difficult if the recording layer film<br>
thickness is less than 3 nm.<br>
(A-4) Method for producing recording layer<br>
The above recording layer can be obtained by DC or<br>
RF sputtering of a predetermined alloy target in an inert<br>
gas, particularly in an Ar gas.<br>
Further, the density of the recording layer is<br>
usually at least 80%, preferably at least 90% of the bulk<br>
density. As the bulk density p, an approximate value<br>
from the following mathematical formula (2) is usually<br>
employed, but it may be actually measured by preparing a<br>
mass having an alloy composition constituting the<br>
recording layer:<br>
p=∑mipi (2)<br>
wherein mi is the molar concentration of each element i,<br>
and pi is the atomic weight of the element i.<br>
In the sputtering deposition method, the high energy<br>
Ar amount to be irradiated on the recording layer is<br>
increased by lowering the pressure of the sputtering gas<br>
(usually rare gas such as Ar, hereinafter explanation<br>
will be made with reference to the case of Ar) at the<br>
time of deposition, or by disposing the substrate in the<br>
vicinity of the front of the target, thereby to increase<br>
the density of the recording layer. The high energy Ar<br>
is usually either part of Ar ions to be irradiated on the<br>
target for sputtering which are bounced off and reach the<br><br>
substrate side, or the Ar ions in the plasma which are<br>
accelerated by the sheath voltage of the entire substrate<br>
face and reach the substrate.<br>
Such an irradiation effect of the high energy rare<br>
gas is referred to as an atomic peening effect, and in<br>
the sputtering by an Ar gas which is commonly employed,<br>
Ar is incorporated into the sputtering film by the atomic<br>
peening effect. Accordingly, the atomic peening effect<br>
can be appraised by the Ar amount in the film. Namely,<br>
the small Ar amount indicates a small high energy Ar<br>
irradiation effect, and a film with a low density is<br>
likely to form.<br>
On the other hand, if the Ar amount is large,<br>
irradiation of the high energy Ar tends to be intense,<br>
and the density of the film tends to be high. However,<br>
Ar incorporated in the film is likely to precipitate as a<br>
void at the time of repeated recording, and is likely to<br>
deteriorate the repeated recording durability.<br>
Accordingly, the discharge is carried out under an<br>
appropriate pressure, usually between the order of from<br>
10-2 to 10-1 Pa.<br>
Now, other constituting elements in the structure of<br>
the optical information recording medium which is the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
explained below.<br>
(B) Substrate<br>
As the substrate to be used in the present<br><br>
invention, a resin such as a polycarbonate, an acrylic<br>
resin or a polyolefin, or glass, or a metal such as<br>
aluminum may be employed. Usually guide grooves with a<br>
depth of a level of from 20 to 80 run are formed on the<br>
substrate, and thus preferred is a substrate made of a<br>
resin on which the guide grooves can be formed by<br>
molding. Further, in the case of a so-called substrate<br>
face incidence (Fig. l(a)) wherein the focused laser beam<br>
for erasing/retrieving the record enters from the<br>
substrate side, the substrate is preferably transparent.<br>
The thickness of the substrate is usually at least<br>
0.05 mm and at most 1.5 mm, however, one of about 1.2 mm<br>
for CD or one of about 0.6 mm for DVD is employed.<br>
Further, in a case where the optical head of the<br>
laser has a high NA (at least about 0.7) and a short<br>
wavelength is employed to achieve a high density, in Fig.<br>
1(b), a covering layer comprising a transparent resin is<br>
further formed on the protective layer on the laser beam<br>
incident side. As its thickness, usually a thin layer of<br>
from about 0.01 mm to about 0.1 mm may also be used.<br>
(C) Protective layer<br>
(C-1) General explanation regarding protective layer used<br>
in the present invention<br>
In the present invention, in order to prevent<br>
evaporation and deformation due to the phase change of<br>
the recording layer, thereby to control the thermal<br>
diffusion at that time, it is preferred that the optical<br><br>
information recording medium further has a protective<br>
layer. The protective layer is usually formed on one or<br>
both sides of the recording layer, preferably on both<br>
sides. The material of the protective layer is<br>
determined taking into consideration the refractive<br>
index, the thermal conductivity, the chemical stability,<br>
the mechanical strength, the adhesive properties, etc.<br>
Usually, a dielectric such as an oxide, sulfide, nitride<br>
or carbide of a metal or semiconductor, having high<br>
transparency and high melting point, or a fluoride of Ca,<br>
Mg, Li or the like may be employed.<br>
In this case, such an oxide, sulfide, nitride,<br>
carbide or fluoride may not necessarily take a<br>
stoichiometrical composition, and the composition may be<br>
controlled to adjust the refractive index, etc., and it<br>
is effective to use them as mixed. When repeated<br>
recording characteristics are taken into consideration, a<br>
mixture of dielectrics is preferred. More specifically,<br>
a mixture of ZnS or a chalcogen compound such as a rare<br>
earth sulfide with a heat resistant compound such as an<br>
oxide, nitride, carbide or fluoride may be mentioned.<br>
For example, a mixture of heat resistant compounds<br>
containing ZnS as the main component, or a mixture of<br>
heat resistant compounds containing an oxysulfide of the<br>
rare earth, particularly Y2O2S as the main component is<br>
an example of the preferred protective layer composition.<br>
As the material to form the protective layer,<br><br>
usually a dielectric material may be mentioned. The<br>
dielectric material may, for example, be an oxide of e.g.<br>
Sc, Y, Ce, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Zn, Al, Cr, In, Si<br>
or Ge, a nitride of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo,<br>
W, Zn, B, Al, Si, Ge or Sn, a carbide of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf,<br>
V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W or Si, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Further, as the dielectric material, a sulfide, selenide<br>
or telluride of e.g. Zn, Y, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb,<br>
Sb or Bi, an oxysulfide of e.g. Y or Ce, a fluoride of<br>
e.g. Mg or Ca, or a mixture thereof, may be mentioned.<br>
Further, as a specific example of the dielectric<br>
material, ZnS-SiO2, SiN, SiO2, TiO2, CrN, TaS2 or Y2O2S<br>
may, for example, be mentioned. Among these materials,<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is widely used in view of the high film<br>
deposition rate, the small film stress, the low rate of<br>
change of the volume due to the change in the temperature<br>
and the excellent weather resistance. In a case where<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is used, the compositional ratio of ZnS to SiO2<br>
i.e. ZnS:SiO2 is usually from 0:1 to 1:0, preferably from<br>
0.5:0.5 to 0.95:0.05, more preferably from 0.7:0.3 to<br>
0.9:0.1. Most preferably ZnS:SiO2 is 0.8:0.2.<br>
Taking the repeated recording characteristics into<br>
consideration, the film density of the protective layer<br>
is preferably at least 80% of the bulk state in view of<br>
the mechanical strength. In a case where a mixture of<br>
dielectrics is used, the theoretical density of the<br>
above-described mathematical formula (2) is employed as<br><br>
the bulk density.<br>
The thickness of the protective layer is usually at<br>
least 1 nm and at most 500 nm in general. When it is at<br>
least 1 nm, the effect of preventing the deformation of<br>
the substrate or the recording layer can be secured, and<br>
a role as the protective layer can be fulfilled.<br>
Further, when it is at most 500 nm, while the role as the<br>
protective layer can be fulfilled, such a phenomenon can<br>
be prevented that the internal stress of the protective<br>
layer itself, the difference in the elastic<br>
characteristics with the substrate or the like will be<br>
remarkable, and thus cracks are formed.<br>
Particularly when a first protective layer is<br>
formed, the first protective layer is required to<br>
suppress e.g. deformation of the substrate due to heat,<br>
and thus its thickness is usually at least 1 nm,<br>
preferably at least 5 nm, particularly preferably at<br>
least 10 nm. With such a thickness, accumulation of the<br>
microscopic deformation of the substrate during the<br>
repeated recording can be suppressed, and remarkable<br>
noise increase by scattering of the retrieving laser beam<br>
is less likely to occur.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of the first<br>
protective layer is preferably at most 2 00 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
100 nm, with relation to the time required for film<br>
formation. With such a thickness, the change of the<br><br>
groove shape of the substrate as viewed on the recording<br>
layer plane is less likely to occur. Namely, such a<br>
phenomenon that the depth or width of the grooves is<br>
smaller than the intended shape on the substrate surface<br>
is less likely to take place.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where a second<br>
protective layer is formed, the thickness of the second<br>
protective layer is usually at least 1 run, preferably at<br>
least 5 run, particularly preferably at least 10 nm so as<br>
to suppress the deformation of the recording layer.<br>
Further, it is preferably at most 2 00 nm, more preferably<br>
at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most 100 nm,<br>
particularly preferably at most 50 nm, so as to prevent<br>
accumulation of the microscopic plastic deformation in<br>
the interior of the second protective layer which occurs<br>
due to the repeated recording and to suppress the noise<br>
increase due to the scattering of the retrieving laser<br>
beam.<br>
The thicknesses of the recording layer and the<br>
protective layers are selected taking into consideration<br>
the interference effects attributable to the multilayer<br>
structure in addition to the restrictions from the<br>
viewpoint of the mechanical strength and reliability, so<br>
that the efficiency for absorption of the laser beam will<br>
be good, and the amplitude of recording signals, i.e. the<br>
contrast between the recorded state and the non-recorded<br>
state, will be large.<br><br>
The protective layer may be constituted by a<br>
plurality of layers made of different materials as<br>
described above. Particularly, it is preferred to form<br>
an interfacial layer containing no sulfur or having a low<br>
sulfur content at the interface on the side which is in<br>
contact with the recording layer and/or at the interface<br>
on the side which is in contact with the reflective layer<br>
containing Ag as the main component.<br>
The protective layer is produced usually by a known<br>
sputtering method.<br>
(C-2) Preferred embodiment of protective layer<br>
It is preferred that the information recording<br>
medium used in the present invention has a protective<br>
layer A in contact with the recording layer employing the<br>
composition represented by the above formula (1)<br>
(hereinafter "the composition represented by the above<br>
formula (1)" may sometimes be referred to as "the<br>
predetermined composition"), and the protective layer A<br>
contains a metal oxysulfide or a metal nitride.<br>
In a case where the information recording medium of<br>
the present invention is used as a phase-change type<br>
optical information recording medium, as the material of<br>
the protective layer, usually (ZnS) 80 (SiO2) 20 is used.<br>
This is because this material is excellent in<br>
transparency, the adhesive properties to a conventional<br>
recording layer, the sputtering rate, the cost, etc.<br>
However, when the protective layer of the above<br><br>
(ZnS) 80 (Si02)20 is used for the recording layer having the<br>
predetermined composition on which high speed<br>
recording/erasing is possible, it seems that an object to<br>
further improve the repeated recording durability arises<br>
in some cases. It is considered that one cause is that a<br>
quick change in temperature is brought about in erasing<br>
the record of a medium for high speed recording, as<br>
compared with a medium for low speed recording. For<br>
example, in a case where the recording linear velocity<br>
doubles, the time to increase the temperature of the<br>
recording layer by irradiation with the laser beam will<br>
be 1/2, and further, the cooling rate tends to be high<br>
also. This is because the temperature distribution of<br>
the melted region of the recording layer is gentle when<br>
the recording is carried out at a low linear velocity,<br>
whereas it tends to be sharp when the recording is<br>
carried out at a high linear velocity. Further, the<br>
distance between the melted region and the laser beam<br>
tends to be relatively long in the recording at a high<br>
linear velocity as compared with the recording at a low<br>
linear velocity. Of course, as the cause of the above<br>
repeated recording durability not being adequate, a cause<br>
resulting from the recording layer material itself, such<br>
as a difference in properties regarding the substance<br>
movement due to the melting and solidification, or such a<br>
cause that the atomic diffusion of e.g. sulfur which is<br>
reported in the case of the combination with a<br><br>
conventional recording material is more likely to occur,<br>
may also be considered.<br>
In the present invention, by forming a protective<br>
layer A containing GeN for example as the metal nitride<br>
or Y2O2S for example as the metal oxysulfide in contact<br>
with the recording layer containing a recording layer<br>
material of the predetermined composition, further<br>
improvement of the repeated recording durability of the<br>
information recording medium can be expected. The reason<br>
why the improvement of the repeated recording durability<br>
can be expected by forming a protective layer A<br>
containing a metal nitride such as GeN or a metal<br>
oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is not necessarily clear, but is<br>
considered to be because effects to suppress the<br>
deformation of the recording layer due to the quick<br>
change in the temperature by carrying out the high speed<br>
recording as compared with a conventional one, the<br>
substance movement in the recording layer, the atomic<br>
diffusion between the layers, can be obtained.<br>
(1) Protective layer A<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to<br>
incorporate a metal oxidesulfide or a metal nitride into<br>
the protective layer A in contact with the recording<br>
layer. Of course, a metal oxysulfide and a metal nitride<br>
may be used together. Now, explanation will be made in<br>
further detail.<br>
(1-1) Protective layer A containing metal oxysulfide<br><br>
In the present invention, it is preferred to use the<br>
protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide.<br>
Containing a metal oxysulfide means that the constituting<br>
element in the protective layer is present while<br>
maintaining the form of the metal oxysulfide.<br>
In the present invention, it is expected that the<br>
durability when recording is carried out repeatedly on<br>
the information recording medium further improves by<br>
forming the protective layer A containing a metal<br>
oxysulfide in contact with the recording layer having the<br>
predetermined composition. The reason is not clearly<br>
understood yet, but is considered to be related with high<br>
thermal conductivity and hardness of the protective layer<br>
A containing a metal oxysulfide and high uniformity of<br>
the distribution of the constituting element. Namely,<br>
the protective layer A in the present invention has high<br>
thermal conductivity and hardness as compared with a<br>
protective layer employing a composite dielectric<br>
containing ZnS as the main component, as represented by a<br>
ZnS-SiO2 film which has conventionally been commonly<br>
used. On the other hand, the refractive index of the<br>
protective layer A is usually from about 1.7 to about<br>
2.4 although it depends on the compositional ratio, and<br>
is substantially the same as that of a protective layer<br>
employing a composite dielectric containing ZnS as the<br>
main component.<br>
Further, it is considered that deformation of the<br><br>
recording layer due to thermal expansion tends to be<br>
small since the thermal conductivity of the protective<br>
layer A containing a metal oxysulfide is high. Namely,<br>
since the thermal conductivity of the protective layer A<br>
is high, the heat of the recording layer which is heated<br>
when the recording marks are formed by the laser can be<br>
let loose quickly. Accordingly, the difference in<br>
temperature between the interfacial region which is in<br>
contact with the recording layer of the protective layer<br>
A and the region of the protective layer A which is apart<br>
from the recording layer, or the difference in<br>
temperature between the mark-formed region and the<br>
peripheral region can be instantaneously dissolved. As a<br>
result, peeling of the film or occurrence of the cracks<br>
resulting from the difference in temperature can be<br>
suppressed. In other words, it is considered that the<br>
overwriting deterioration can be delayed. The thermal<br>
conductivity can be indirectly known from the value of<br>
the laser power when amorphous marks are formed on the<br>
prepared disk. Namely, the higher the thermal<br>
conductivity, the higher the laser power required to heat<br>
the recording layer tends to be. For example, in a case<br>
where a protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide<br>
is used, the laser power required for mark formation<br>
tends to be high as compared with a case where a<br>
protective layer of ZnS=SiO2=80:20 (mol%) is used. This<br>
is because the function of the protective layer A as a<br><br>
heat dissipation layer is increased due to a high thermal<br>
conductivity.<br>
Further, the JIS Knoop hardness of the protective<br>
layer using ZnS:SiO2=80:20 (mol%) is about 280, whereas<br>
the JIS Knoop hardness of the protective layer A using<br>
Y2O2S for example as the metal oxysulfide is about 520.<br>
The protective layer A having a high hardness is<br>
important with a view to preventing the deformation of<br>
the recording layer. If the hardness is low, it is<br>
difficult to appropriately suppress the change in the<br>
volume of the recording layer due to recording/erasing,<br>
i.e. the deformation resulting from the difference in the<br>
volume between the amorphous state and the crystalline<br>
state, and the deformation is accumulated along with the<br>
increase in the number of the repeated overwriting, thus<br>
causing decrease in the signal intensity.<br>
Further, in the protective layer A containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide, the metal atom is bonded to both sulfur<br>
and oxygen, and accordingly the mixing properties of<br>
sulfur with oxygen are so high and incomparable with a<br>
protective layer employing a mixture of a sulfide and an<br>
oxide such as ZnS-SiO2 or ZnS-Y2O3. Accordingly, it is<br>
considered that the protective layer A has stably high<br>
characteristics since the dispersibility of sulfur,<br>
oxygen and metal atoms such as selenium atoms is high as<br>
compared with conventional ZnS-SiO2. Accordingly, it is<br>
estimated that such a phenomenon that sulfur disperses<br><br>
from the protective layer to the recording layer during<br>
the repeated overwriting to cause a decrease in the<br>
reflectivity or a change in the crystallization speed is<br>
suppressed.<br>
Further, in a case where the protective layer A<br>
containing a metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in<br>
contact with the recording layer having the predetermined<br>
composition to be used in the present invention, the<br>
signal amplitude of the information recording medium<br>
tends to be high as compared with a case where the<br>
protective layer A contains a metal nitride such as GeN.<br>
The reason is not clear, but such a reason that the<br>
properties of the crystal growth of the recording layer<br>
are slightly changed by the protective layer A in contact<br>
with the recording layer, and the size of the amorphous<br>
marks to be formed varies, may be considered. Such<br>
properties are considered to be determined by the<br>
combination of the recording layer material and the<br>
material of the protective layer A, and with respect to<br>
the conventional recording layer material, the change of<br>
the signal intensity by the material of the protective<br>
layer A has not attracted an attention.<br>
As the metal element used for the metal oxysulfide,<br>
a rare earth metal element such as Sc, yttrium or a<br>
lanthanoid element such as La or Ce; or a transition<br>
metal element such as Ti may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Among them, a rare earth metal element is preferred, and<br><br>
a rare earth metal element selected from the group<br>
consisting of yttrium and La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb and<br>
Dy is particularly preferred. The oxysulfide of yttrium<br>
(Y2O2S) is thermochemically more stable than Y2O3 or Y2S3<br>
up to about 1000°C, and accordingly the most preferred<br>
element is yttrium.<br>
The content of the metal oxysulfide in the<br>
protective layer A is preferably at least 5 mol%, more<br>
preferably at least 10 mol%, most preferably at least 15<br>
mol%. If the content of the metal oxysulfide is too low,<br>
the overwriting characteristics may decrease in some<br>
cases. On the other hand, in view of the repeated<br>
overwriting characteristics etc., the content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide in the protective layer A is preferably<br>
as high as possible, and the content of the metal<br>
oxysulfide in the protective layer A may be at most 100<br>
mol%.<br>
Further, the content of the metal element<br>
constituting the metal oxysulfide in the protective layer<br>
A is usually at least 10 atomic%, preferably at least 20<br>
atomic%, more preferably at least 2 5 atomic%. The<br>
content of the metal element constituting the metal<br>
oxysulfide is an index indicating the content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide in the protective layer A, and if the<br>
metal element is too small, the effect for further<br>
improving the overwriting characteristics may not be<br>
adequate in some cases. On the other hand, in view of<br><br>
the repeated overwriting characteristics, the content of<br>
the metal oxysulfide in the protective layer A is<br>
preferably as high as possible, and thus the upper limit<br>
of the content of the metal element constituting the<br>
metal oxysulfide is the content of the metal element when<br>
the protective layer A consists entirely of the metal<br>
oxysulfide.<br>
Further, for the protective layer A, a metal<br>
oxysulfide and another material may be used together.<br>
Said another material is not particularly limited so long<br>
as it is a material which is commonly used for the<br>
protective layer. For example, a dielectric such as an<br>
oxide, sulfide, nitride or carbide of a metal or<br>
semiconductor, having high transparency and high melting<br>
point, or a fluoride of Ca, Mg, Li or the like, may be<br>
employed in general.<br>
In this case, such an oxide, sulfide, nitride,<br>
carbide or fluoride may not necessarily take a<br>
stoichiometrical composition, and the composition may be<br>
controlled to adjust the refractive index, etc., and it<br>
is effective to use them as mixed. When repeated<br>
recording characteristics are taken into consideration, a<br>
mixture of dielectrics is preferred.<br>
Further, as the material to be contained in the<br>
protective layer A, usually a dielectric material may be<br>
mentioned. As the dielectric material, an oxide of e.g.<br>
Sc, Y, Ce, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Zn, Al, Cr, In, Si<br><br>
or Ge, a nitride of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo,<br>
W, Zn, B, Al, Si, Ge or Sn, a carbide of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf,<br>
V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W or Si, or a mixture thereof may, for<br>
example, be mentioned. Further, as the dielectric<br>
material, a sulfide, selenide or telluride of e.g. Zn, Y,<br>
Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Bi, an oxysulfide of<br>
e.g. Y or Ce, a fluoride of e.g. Mg or Ca, or a mixture<br>
thereof may be mentioned.<br>
More specifically, an oxide, sulfide, nitride,<br>
carbide or fluoride of a metal or semiconductor, as<br>
represented by zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, silicon oxide,<br>
silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide, a rare<br>
earth oxide, a rare earth sulfide, a rare earth fluoride,<br>
magnesium fluoride, etc. may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Among them, particularly preferred is a zinc compound<br>
such as zinc sulfide or zinc oxide, which is excellent in<br>
the adhesive properties with the recording layer. As a<br>
result, a more stable and higher durability can be<br>
obtained.<br>
In a case where another material is contained in the<br>
protective layer A other than the metal oxysulfide, the<br>
content of the material is usually at most 99 mol%,<br>
preferably at most 90 mol%. On the other hand, it is<br>
usually at least 1 mol%, preferably at least 5 mol%.<br>
However, the appropriate content varies depending<br>
upon the type of the material to be mixed. For example,<br>
in a case where zinc sulfide is used as the above<br><br>
material, its amount may be high, and it is usually at<br>
least 20 mol%, preferably at least 3 0 mol%, furthermore<br>
preferably at'least 50 mol%, most preferably at least 60<br>
mol%.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where zinc oxide is<br>
used as the above material, a too high content tends to<br>
be unfavorable, and the content is usually at most 3 0<br>
mol%, preferably at most 2 0 mol%, furthermore preferably<br>
at most 10 mol%. Further, the molar content of zinc<br>
oxide is preferably at most half the molar content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide.<br>
As the particularly preferred composition of the<br>
protective layer A, a mixed composition containing Y2O2S<br>
and ZnS may be mentioned. In this case, particularly<br>
excellent overwriting characteristics can be obtained.<br>
In this case, the molar ratio of ZnS to Y2O2S is usually<br>
at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, more preferably at<br>
least 10%, and usually at most 1000%, preferably at most<br>
700%, furthermore preferably at most 500%.<br>
Further, it is possible to let zinc in the metal<br>
form be present in the protective layer A. However, it<br>
is contained preferably in the form of a zinc compound<br>
such as zinc oxide or zinc sulfide as described above.<br>
In the present invention, the purity of the<br>
protective layer A (the content of the metal oxysulfide<br>
or the content of a mixture of the metal oxysulfide with<br>
another material in the protective layer A) is preferably<br><br>
at least 90 mol%. The purity is preferably as high as<br>
possible, however, the influence of impurities in an<br>
amount less than 10 mol% over the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A is negligible. Particularly when the<br>
impurities are stable compounds, the bad influence tends<br>
to be small, however, if the amount of the impurities<br>
exceeds 10 mol%, there is high possibility that the<br>
physical property values such as the hardness or the<br>
stress of the film change, and the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A may deteriorate.<br>
The protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide<br>
can be formed by deposition by means of a sputtering<br>
method using a target containing a metal oxysulfide.<br>
Usually, a target having a composition within a range<br>
substantially the same as the preferred composition of<br>
the protective layer A is used.<br>
Namely, it is preferred to use one containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide as the target for sputtering. The type<br>
of the metal element of the metal oxysulfide to be used<br>
for the target is optionally selected according to the<br>
composition of the protective layer A.<br>
Further, in a case where the protective layer A<br>
contains a metal oxysulfide and another protective layer<br>
material, a target of a mixture of the metal oxysulfide<br>
and the another material may be used in accordance with<br>
the composition of the another material to be used.<br>
Further, a target of the metal oxysulfide and a target of<br><br>
the above another material may be separately prepared,<br>
and they are subjected to sputtering at the same time.<br>
The content of the metal oxysulfide in the target is<br>
usually at least 10 mol%, preferably at least 30 mol%,<br>
more preferably at least 50 mol%. If the content of the<br>
metal oxysulfide in the target is excessively low, the<br>
metal oxysulfide may be decomposed in the target, whereby<br>
the metal oxysulfide cannot be incorporated in the<br>
protective layer A in some cases. On the other hand, the<br>
content of the metal oxysulfide in the target varies<br>
depending upon the content of the above another<br>
protective layer material. However, in a case where a<br>
target comprising a metal oxysulfide simple substance is<br>
used, the content of the metal oxysulfide in the target<br>
is usually 100 mol%.<br>
Whether or not the metal oxysulfide is contained in<br>
the target can be confirmed by measuring the X-ray<br>
diffraction of the target.<br>
Further, the target containing a metal oxysulfide is<br>
produced usually by using a powder of the metal<br>
oxysulfide or a mixed powder of an oxide and a sulfide of<br>
the same metal, by using a known method such as hot<br>
pressing method. Preferred as the metal to be used is a<br>
rare earth or a metal element.<br>
As the conditions for sputtering, known conditions<br>
may be employed.<br>
For the analysis of the composition of the<br><br>
protective layer A, usually the composition may be<br>
identified by combination of e.g. Auger electron<br>
spectroscopy (AES), Rutherford back scattering (RBS),<br>
inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) etc.<br>
(1-2) Protective layer A containing metal nitride<br>
In the present invention, it is also preferred to<br>
use a protective layer containing a metal nitride as the<br>
protective layer A.<br>
A metal nitride tends to have a high thermal<br>
conductivity similar to the metal oxysulfide, and<br>
accordingly it is considered that the high thermal<br>
conductivity of the protective layer A suppresses peeling<br>
of the film or occurrence of the cracks resulting from<br>
the difference in temperature, and can delay<br>
deterioration of the overwriting, similar to the above<br>
case of one containing a metal oxysulfide as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
As the metal to be used for the metal nitride, at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
Si, Ge, Al, Ti, Ta, Cr, Mo, Nb, Zr and Hf may, for<br>
example, be mentioned. The nitride of such an element is<br>
stable, and thus the storage stability of the information<br>
recording medium tends to improve. A plurality of the<br>
above elements may be used. Preferred as the above<br>
element is Si, Ge, Al or Cr which provides higher<br>
transparency and excellent adhesion properties.<br>
In a case where one type of the above element is<br><br>
used, as the material formed by the above element and<br>
nitrogen, a nitride of the above element simple substance<br>
may be mentioned. More specifically, a composition in<br>
the vicinity of e.g. Si-N, Ge-N, Cr-N or Al-N may be<br>
mentioned. Among them, in view of higher effect for<br>
preventing diffusion into the recording layer, it is<br>
preferred to use Si-N (nitride of silicon), Ge-N (nitride<br>
of germanium) or Al-N (nitride of aluminum), and it is<br>
more preferred to use Ge-N (nitride of germanium).<br>
In a case where at least two of the above elements<br>
are used, as the material formed by the above elements<br>
and nitrogen, a composite nitride of the above elements<br>
may be mentioned. As such a compound, as representative<br>
examples using Ge-N, one containing, together with Ge,<br>
e.g. Al, B, Ba, Bi, C, Ca, Ce, Cr, Dy, Eu, Ga, In, K, La,<br>
Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Si, Sb, Sn, Ta, Te, Ti, V, W, Yb, Zn<br>
or Zr, such as Ge-Si-N, Ge-Sb-N, Ge-Cr-N, Ge-Al-N, Ge-Mo-<br>
N or Ge-Ti-N may be mentioned.<br>
The content of the metal nitride in the protective<br>
layer A is preferably at least 5 mol%, more preferably at<br>
least 10 mol%; most preferably at least 15 mol%. If the<br>
content of the metal nitride is too low, the overwriting<br>
characteristics may decrease in some cases. On the other<br>
hand, in view of the repeated overwriting characteristics<br>
etc., the content of the metal nitride in the protective<br>
layer A is preferably as high as possible, and the<br>
content of the metal nitride in the protective layer A<br><br>
may be at most 100 mol%.<br>
Further, the content of the metal element<br>
constituting the metal nitride in the protective layer A<br>
is usually at least 10 atomic%. Preferably at least 20<br>
atomic%, more preferably at least 2 5 atomic%. If the<br>
content of the metal nitride is too low, the effect for<br>
further improving the overwriting characteristics may not<br>
be adequate in some cases. On the other hand, in view of<br>
the repeated overwriting characteristics etc., the<br>
content of the metal nitride in the protective layer A is<br>
preferably as high as possible, and thus the upper limit<br>
of the content of the metal element constituting the<br>
metal nitride is the content of the metal element when<br>
the protective layer A consists entirely of the metal<br>
nitride.<br>
Further, for the protective layer A, a metal nitride<br>
and another material may be used together. As the<br>
another material and its content, the same material as<br>
one explained for the protective layer A containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide may be employed.<br>
In the present invention, the purity of the<br>
protective layer A (the content of the metal nitride or<br>
the content of a mixture of the metal nitride and another<br>
material in the protective layer A) is preferably at<br>
least 90 mol%. The purity is preferably as high as<br>
possible, however, the influence of impurities in an<br>
amount less than 10 mol% over the characteristics of the<br><br>
protective layer A is negligible. Particularly when the<br>
impurities are stable compounds, the bad influence tends<br>
to be small, however, if the amount of the impurities<br>
exceeds 10 mol%, there is high possibility that the<br>
physical property values such as the hardness or the<br>
stress of the film change, and the characteristics of the<br>
protective layer A may deteriorate.<br>
The protective layer A containing a metal nitride<br>
can be formed by deposition by means of a sputtering<br>
method using a target containing a metal nitride.<br>
Further, the protective layer A may be formed also by a<br>
reactive sputtering method in which a slight amount of a<br>
mixed gas of Ar and N2 is flown in a vacuum chamber, and<br>
under a predetermined vacuum pressure, a voltage is<br>
applied to a target comprising a predetermined metal (a<br>
metal element simple substance or a metal element<br>
composite in the metal nitride contained in the<br>
protective layer A) for discharge, and the ejected metal<br>
element simple substance or metal element composite is<br>
reacted with N2 to convert it into a nitride for<br>
deposition. Here, it has to be noted that the<br>
transparency of the protective layer A is hardly secured<br>
if the nitrogen content in the protective layer A is<br>
excessively low, and the improvement of the repeated<br>
recording durability of the optical information recording<br>
medium tends to be insufficient if the nitrogen content<br>
is excessively high. Accordingly, in a case where the<br><br>
above reactive sputtering method is employed, it is<br>
important to adjust the nitrogen flow amount. Further,<br>
the pressure at the time of sputtering also has an<br>
influence over the film properties. Usually, by<br>
decreasing the pressure, the protective layer A can be<br>
formed densely.<br>
For the analysis of the composition of the<br>
protective layer A, the composition can be identified<br>
usually by combination of Auger electron spectroscopy<br>
(AES), Rutherford back scattering (RBS), inductively-<br>
coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) etc.<br>
(1-3) Film thickness of protective layer A<br>
The preferred range of the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A varies depending upon the position at<br>
which the protective layer A is used.<br>
Namely, in a case where the protective layer A is<br>
formed as the first protective layer, the first<br>
protective layer is required to suppress e.g. the<br>
deformation of the substrate due to heat, and its<br>
thickness is usually at least 1 nm, preferably at least 5<br>
nm, particularly preferably at least 10 nm. With such a<br>
thickness, accumulation of the microscopic deformation of<br>
the substrate during the repeated recording can be<br>
suppressed, and a remarkable noise increase by scattering<br>
of the retrieving laser beam is less likely to occur.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of the first<br>
protective layer is preferably at most 2 00 nm, more<br><br>
preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
100 nm, with relation to the time required for film<br>
formation. With such a thickness, a change in the groove<br>
shape of the substrate as viewed on the recording layer<br>
plane is less likely to occur. Namely, such a phenomenon<br>
that the depth or width of the grooves is smaller than<br>
the intended shape on the substrate surface is less<br>
likely to take place.<br>
In a case where the protective layer A is formed as<br>
the second protective layer, the thickness of the second<br>
protective layer is usually at least 1 nm, preferably at<br>
least 5 nm, particularly preferably at least 10 nm so as<br>
to suppress deformation of the recording layer. Further,<br>
in order to prevent accumulation of microscopic plastic<br>
deformation in the interior of the second protective<br>
layer which occurs along with the repeated recording,<br>
thereby to suppress the noise increase by scattering of<br>
the retrieving laser beam, it is preferably at most 2 00<br>
nm, more preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore<br>
preferably at most 100 nm, particularly preferably at<br>
most 50 nm.<br>
However, in the present invention, usually the<br>
protective layer A having a high thermal conductivity and<br>
having a high hardness is formed in contact with the<br>
recording layer, and accordingly the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer A located on the side from which the<br>
laser beam enters relative to the recording layer can be<br><br>
made thin, as explained in the above explanation for the<br>
recording layer. Namely, in a case where the protective<br>
layer A is formed in contact with the recording layer<br>
face on the side from which the laser beam enters, the<br>
film thickness of the protective layer A is preferably at<br>
most 50 run.<br>
The sputtering rate of the material containing e.g.<br>
a metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S as the main component,<br>
tends to be low as compared with the sputtering rate of a<br>
material such as (ZnS)80(SiO2) 20 which has conventionally<br>
been employed. Accordingly, with a view to increasing<br>
the productivity of the information recording medium, the<br>
protective layer A containing e.g. a metal oxysulfide may<br>
be formed relatively thinly in contact with the recording<br>
layer and a protective layer B may be formed in contact<br>
with the protective layer A. Further, a material which<br>
has conventionally been employed (e.g. (ZnS) so (SiO2) 20)<br>
may be used for the protective layer B. The details of<br>
the specific embodiment of such an information recording<br>
medium will be described hereinafter.<br>
As mentioned above, in a case where the protective<br>
layer has a multilayer structure by using the protective<br>
layer A and the protective layer B, the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer A in the present invention is<br>
usually at least 0.1 nm, preferably at least 1 nm, more<br>
preferably at least 2 nm, furthermore preferably at least<br>
3 nm, particularly preferably at least 5 nm. On the<br><br>
other hand, the film thickness of the protective layer A<br>
is usually at most 100 run, preferably at most 50 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 2 5 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
10 nm.<br>
(1-4) Position of protective layer A and recording layer<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the<br>
protective layer A containing a metal oxysulfide or a<br>
metal nitride is formed in contact with the recording<br>
layer. More preferably, the above predetermined<br>
protective layer A is formed on both sides of the<br>
recording layer. It is because the repeated overwriting<br>
characteristics can be further improved by forming the<br>
above predetermined protective layer A on both sides of<br>
the recording layer. In general, by forming the above<br>
predetermined protective layer A on both sides of the<br>
recording layer, the recording layer and the protective<br>
layer A tend to peel off, however, it is considered that<br>
the above problem of peeling is less likely to occur in<br>
the recording layer employing the predetermined<br>
composition of the present invention.<br>
For example, if the protective layer A containing a<br>
metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in contact with<br>
a conventional recording layer of SbTe eutectic (Sb70Te30)<br>
composition, film peeling in an environment resistance<br>
test tends to occur. This tendency becomes more<br>
remarkable if the above protective layer A is formed on<br>
both sides of the recording layer. For example, with<br><br>
respect to a conventional recording layer employing a<br>
SbTe eutectic composition, if the protective layer A<br>
containing a metal oxysulfide such as Y2O2S is formed in<br>
contact with both sides of the recording layer, film<br>
peeling occurs in an environment resistance test with<br>
high humidity, and the adhesive properties and the<br>
weather resistance of the film tend to be not necessarily<br>
sufficient.<br>
(2) Protective layer B<br>
Another example of the preferred layer structure of<br>
the optical information recording medium is to make one<br>
or both of the first and second protective layers have a<br>
two-layer structure comprising the protective layer A and<br>
the protective layer B. In view of e.g. the repeated<br>
overwriting, it is preferred to make the first protective<br>
layer located on the laser beam incident side have a two-<br>
layer structure (Figs. 6(a), 6(b)), and it is more<br>
preferred to make both the first and the second<br>
protective layers have a two-layer structure comprising<br>
the protective layer A and the protective layer B (Figs.<br>
7(a) , 7(b) ) .<br>
In the above preferred layer structure, the first<br>
protective layer or the second protective layer has a<br>
two-layer structure comprising the protective layer A and<br>
the protective layer B, however, the layer structure is<br>
not limited to such an embodiment so long as the<br>
protective layer A is formed in contact with the<br><br>
recording layer. For example, it may be optionally<br>
carried out to make the first protective layer or the<br>
second protective layer have a multilayer structure of at<br>
least three layers, by further forming a protective layer<br>
formed by another material in contact with the protective<br>
layer B.<br>
(2-1) Material, production method etc. of protective<br>
layer B<br>
As the material of the protective layer B, a<br>
material commonly used for the protective layer may<br>
optionally be used. Such a material has already been<br>
explained, and the explanation is omitted here. The<br>
protective layers A and B may be two layers comprising<br>
different materials, or they may have a gradient<br>
composition in which the respective components gradually<br>
change.<br>
Further, as the method for producing the protective<br>
layer B, a production method commonly used for the<br>
protective layer may be used.<br>
(2-2) Film thickness of protective layer B<br>
The protective layer B is in contact with the<br>
protective layer A, and plays a role as the protective<br>
layer in a two-layer structure of the protective layer A<br>
and the protective layer B. Accordingly, the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer B is a film thickness<br>
obtained by subtracting the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A from the film thickness which is<br><br><br>
usually required for a protective layer.<br>
However, in the present invention, the protective<br>
layer A usually having a high thermal conductivity and a<br>
high hardness is formed in contact with the recording<br>
layer, and accordingly the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer located on the side from which the laser<br>
beam enters relative to the recording layer (for example,<br>
the film thickness of the protective layer A in a case<br>
where the protective layer is formed only by the<br>
protective layer A, or the total film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A and the protective layer B in a case<br>
where the protective layer A and the protective layer B<br>
are laminated to form the protective layer) can be made<br>
thin, as explained in the above explanation for the<br>
recording layer.<br>
Namely, the total of the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer A and the film thickness of the<br>
protective layer B is preferably at most 50 nm, in a case<br>
where the protective layer A is formed in contact with<br>
the recording layer face on the side from which the laser<br>
beam enters, and the protective layer B is further formed<br>
in contact with the protective layer A.<br>
As mentioned above, in a case where the protective<br>
layer has a multilayer structure by using the protective<br>
layer A and the protective layer B, the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer A in the present invention is<br>
usually at least 0.1 nm, preferably at least 1 nm, more<br><br>
preferably at least 2 nm, furthermore preferably at least<br>
3 ran, particularly preferably at least 5 nm. On the<br>
other hand, the film thickness of the protective layer A<br>
is usually at most 100 nm, preferably at most 50 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 25 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br>
10 nm. Accordingly, the film thickness of the protective<br>
layer B is the rest obtained by subtracting the film<br>
thickness of the protective layer A from the total film<br>
thickness of the protective layer.<br>
The thicknesses of the recording layer and the<br>
protective layers are selected taking into consideration<br>
the interference effects attributable to the multilayer<br>
structure in addition to restrictions from the viewpoint<br>
of the mechanical strength and reliability, so that the<br>
efficiency for absorption of the laser beam will be good,<br>
and the amplitude of recording signals, i.e. the contrast<br>
between the recorded state and the non-recorded state,<br>
will be large.<br>
(D) Reflective layer<br>
In the optical information recording medium, a<br>
reflective layer may further be formed. In the present<br>
invention, it is preferred that the optical information<br>
recording medium further has a reflective layer with a<br>
view to increasing the heat dissipation properties of the<br>
recoding layer.<br>
The position at which the reflective layer is formed<br>
usually depends at the incident direction of the<br><br>
retrieving laser beam, and it is formed on the opposite<br>
side of the recording layer from the incident side.<br>
Namely, in a case where the retrieving laser beam enters<br>
from the substrate side, the reflective layer is formed<br>
usually on the opposite side of the recording layer from<br>
the substrate, and in a case where the retrieving laser<br>
beam enters from the recording layer side, the reflective<br>
layer is formed usually between the recording layer and<br>
the substrate (Figs. l(a), 1(b)).<br>
As the material to be used for the reflective layer,<br>
a substance having a high reflectivity is preferred, and<br>
particularly preferred is a metal such as Au, Ag or Al<br>
which can be expected to have a heat dissipation effect<br>
also. The heat dissipation properties are determined by<br>
the film thickness and the thermal conductivity, and<br>
since the thermal conductivity is substantially in<br>
proportion to the volume resistivity in the case of such<br>
a metal, the heat dissipation performance may be<br>
represented by the sheet resistivity. The sheet<br>
resistivity is usually at least 0.05 Ω/□, preferably at<br>
least 0.1 Ω/□, and on the other hand, it is usually at<br>
most 0.6 Ω/□, preferably at most 0.5 Ω/□, more preferably<br>
at most 0.4 Ω/□, furthermore preferably at most 0.2 Ω/□.<br>
This is to guarantee particularly high heat<br>
dissipation properties, and is necessary to suppress<br>
recrystallization to a certain extent in a case where<br>
competition between the formation of an amorphous phase<br><br>
and the recrystallization is remarkable in the formation<br>
of amorphous marks, as in the recording layer to be used<br>
for the optical information recording medium. In order<br>
to control the thermal conductivity of the reflective<br>
layer itself or to improve the corrosion resistance, e.g.<br>
Ta, Ti, Cr, Mo, Mg, V, Nb, Zr or Si may be added in a<br>
small amount to the above metal. The addition amount is<br>
usually at least 0.01 atomic% and at most 20 atomic%. An<br>
aluminum alloy containing at least one of Ta and Ti in an<br>
amount of at most 15 atomic%, particularly an alloy of<br>
AlTa1- (0<o is excellent in corrosion resistance></o>
and is a particularly preferred reflective layer material<br>
with a view to improving the reliability of the optical<br>
information recording medium.<br>
Particularly in a case where the film thickness of<br>
the second protective layer is at least 40 nm and at most<br>
50 nm, the amount of the added element contained is<br>
preferably at most 2 atomic% so as to make the reflective<br>
layer have a high thermal conductivity.<br>
Particularly preferred as the material of the<br>
reflective layer is one containing Ag as the main<br>
component. "Containing Ag as the main component" means<br>
that Ag is contained in an amount of at least 50 atomic%<br>
based on the entire reflective layer. The content of Ag<br>
based on the entire reflective layer is preferably at<br>
least 70 atomic%, more preferably at least 80 atomic%,<br>
furthermore preferably at least 9 0 atomic%, particularly<br><br>
preferably at least 95 atomic%. Most preferred with a<br>
view to increasing the heat dissipation properties is to<br>
employ pure Ag as the material of the reflective layer.<br>
The reason why Ag is contained as the main component<br>
is as follows. Namely, recording is carried out again on<br>
recording marks which are stored for a long time, such a<br>
phenomenon may take place in some cases that the<br>
recrystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
layer is high only at the first recording immediately<br>
after the storage. The reason why such a phenomenon<br>
takes place is not clear, but is supposed to be because<br>
the size of the amorphous marks formed by the first<br>
recording immediately after the storage is smaller than<br>
the desired size of the marks due to increase in the<br>
recrystallization speed of the recording layer<br>
immediately after the storage. Accordingly, in a case<br>
where such a phenomenon takes place, Ag having extremely<br>
high heat dissipation properties may be used for the<br>
reflective layer to increase the cooling rate of the<br>
recording layer, whereby recrystallization of the<br>
recording layer at the first recording immediately after<br>
the storage can be suppressed and the size of the<br>
amorphous marks can be maintained to the desired size.<br>
A Ag alloy containing one member of Mg, Ti, Au, Cu,<br>
Pd, Pt, Zn, Cr, Si, Ge, Bi and a rare earth element in an<br>
amount of at least 0.01 atomic% and at most 10 atomic% in<br>
Ag has also a high reflectivity and a high thermal<br><br>
conductivity, is excellent in heat resistance and is<br>
preferred.<br>
The film thickness of the reflective layer is<br>
usually at least 10 nm so that the incident laser beam is<br>
completely reflected so that there is no transmitted<br>
light, and it is preferably at least 2 0 nm, more<br>
preferably at least 40 nm. Further, when it is too<br>
thick, there is no change in the heat dissipation effect,<br>
the productivity is unnecessarily deteriorated, and the<br>
cracks are likely to occur, and accordingly it is usually<br>
at most 500 nm. However, it is preferably at most 400<br>
nm, more preferably at most 3 00 nm.<br>
The recording layer, the protective layer and the<br>
reflective layer are formed usually by e.g. a sputtering<br>
method.<br>
It is preferred to carry out deposition in an in-<br>
line apparatus having a recording layer target, a<br>
protective layer target and, if necessary, a reflective<br>
layer material target provided in the same vacuum<br>
chamber, with a view to preventing oxidation or<br>
contamination among the respective layers. Further, it<br>
is excellent in view of the productivity also.<br>
(E) Protective coating layer<br>
It is preferred to form a protective coating layer<br>
comprising a ultraviolet-curing resin or a thermosetting<br>
resin on the outermost surface side of the optical<br>
information recording medium, so as to prevent direct<br><br>
contact with the air or to prevent scars by the contact<br>
with foreign materials. The protective coating layer has<br>
a thickness of usually from 1 urn to several hundred m.<br>
Further, a dielectric protective layer having high<br>
hardness may further be formed, or a resin layer may<br>
further be formed thereon.<br>
(Initial crystallization method of optical information<br>
recording medium)<br>
The recording layer is formed usually by a physical<br>
vapor deposition method in vacuum such as a sputtering<br>
method. However, in a state immediately after the<br>
deposition (as-deposited state), the recording layer is<br>
usually amorphous, and therefore, it is preferred to<br>
crystallize the recording layer to form a non-recorded or<br>
erased state. This operation is referred to as<br>
initialization (or initial crystallization). As the<br>
initial crystallization operation, a method such as oven<br>
annealing in a solid phase at a temperature of at least<br>
the crystallization temperature (usually from 150 to<br>
3 00°C) and at most the melting point, annealing under<br>
irradiation with a light energy of e.g. a laser beam or a<br>
flash lamp beam or melt initialization may, for example,<br>
be mentioned. In the present invention, among the above<br>
initial crystallization operations, it is preferred to<br>
employ melt initialization, since a phase-change<br>
recording material with a small formation of crystal<br>
nuclei is employed.<br><br>
In the melt initialization, if the recrystallization<br>
speed is too slow, there will be a time until the thermal<br>
equilibrium is reached, whereby other crystalline phases<br>
are likely to be formed. Accordingly, it is preferred to<br>
increase the cooling rate to some extent. Further, if<br>
the recording layer is held in a melted state for a long<br>
time, the recording layer may cause flow, a think film<br>
such as the protective layer may peel off by the stress,<br>
or e.g. the resin substrate may deform, thus leading to<br>
destruction of the medium, such being unfavorable.<br>
For example, the time for maintaining the<br>
temperature at a level of at least the melting point is<br>
preferably usually at most 10 s, preferably at most 1<br>
s.<br>
Further, for the melt initialization, it is<br>
preferred to employ a laser beam. It is particularly<br>
preferred to carry out initial crystallization by using<br>
an oval laser beam having its minor axis substantially in<br>
parallel with the scanning direction (hereinafter, this<br>
initialization method may sometimes be referred to as<br>
"bulk erasing"). In such a case, the length of the major<br>
axis is usually from 10 to 1000 urn, and the length of the<br>
minor axis is usually from 0.1 to 5 urn.<br>
Here, the lengths of the major axis and the minor<br>
axis of the beam are defined from the half value width in<br>
a case where the light energy intensity distribution<br>
within the beam is measured. With respect to the beam<br><br>
shape also, the minor axis length is preferably at most 5<br>
m, more preferably at most 2 m so as to easily realize<br>
local heating and rapid cooling in the minor axis<br>
direction.<br>
As the laser beam source, various types may be used<br>
including, for example, a semiconductor laser and a gas<br>
laser. The power of the laser beam is usually from about<br>
100 mW to about 10 W. Further, another light source may<br>
be used so long as a power density and a beam shape at<br>
the same level can be obtained. Specifically, a Xe lamp<br>
laser beam may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
In the initialization by bulk erasing, when a disk-<br>
form recording medium is used for example, the minor axis<br>
direction of an oval beam is brought substantially into<br>
line with the circumferential direction, and by rotating<br>
the disk, scanning is carried out in the minor axis<br>
direction, while moving the beam in the major axis<br>
(radial) direction every one revolution (one rotation),<br>
whereby initialization can be carried out over the entire<br>
surface. By doing this, a polycrystal structure aligned<br>
in a specific direction relative to the focused laser<br>
beam for recording/retrieving scanned along the track in<br>
the circumferential direction can be realized.<br>
The moving distance in the radial direction per one<br>
rotation is preferably set to be shorter than the major<br>
axis of the beam, so that the irradiated regions overlap,<br>
and the same radial region will be irradiated a plurality<br><br>
of times with the laser beam. As a result,<br>
initialization can certainly be carried out, and at the<br>
same time, it is possible to avoid non-uniformity of the<br>
initial crystallization state attributable to the energy<br>
distribution (usually from 10 to 20%) in the radial<br>
direction of the beam. On the other hand, if the moving<br>
distance is too short, undesirable crystalline phases<br>
tend to be formed. Accordingly, the moving distance in<br>
the radial direction is usually set to be at least 1/2 of<br>
the major axis of the beam. Further, the scanning<br>
velocity of the initialization energy beam is usually<br>
within a range of from 3 to 2 0 m/s.<br>
Whether or not at least the optical information<br>
recording medium of the present invention can be obtained<br>
by melt initialization can be judged by determining<br>
whether or not the reflectivity R1 in the non-recorded<br>
state after initialization is substantially equal to the<br>
reflectivity R2 in the erased state by recrystallization<br>
after recording of amorphous marks is carried out by a<br>
practical focused laser beam for recording (for example,<br>
a focused laser beam having a diameter of about 1 n).<br>
Here, R2 is the reflectivity at the erased portion after<br>
recording 10 times.<br>
Accordingly, the optical information recording<br>
medium of the present invention preferably satisfies the<br>
following relational expression (3) where the<br>
reflectivity at the non-recorded portion after initial<br><br>
crystallization is Rl and the reflectivity at the erased<br>
portion after recording 10 times is R2:<br>
∆R=2│R1-R2│/(R1+R2)xl00(%)
The reason why the reflectivity R2 at the erased<br>
portion after recording 10 times is taken as the judgment<br>
index is that when recording is carried out 10 times, the<br>
influence of the reflectivity in a crystalline state<br>
which may remain in a non-recorded state if recording is<br>
carried out only once, can be removed, and the entire<br>
surface of the optical information recording medium can<br>
be made to be in a state where it is recrystallized by<br>
recording and erasing at least once. On the other hand,<br>
if the number of recording is excessively higher than 10<br>
times, factors other than the change in the crystal<br>
structure of the recording layer, such as microscopic<br>
deformation of the recording layer due to the repeated<br>
recording or diffusion of a foreign element from the<br>
protective layer to the recording layer may cause a<br>
change in the reflectivity, and accordingly it tends to<br>
be difficult to judge whether or not the desired<br>
crystalline state can be obtained.<br>
In the above relational expression (3), AR is at<br>
most 10%, and it is preferably at most 5%. When it is at<br>
most 5%, an optical information recording medium having<br>
lower signal noises can be obtained.<br>
For example, of an optical information recording<br>
medium with Rl of about 17%, R2 may be substantially<br><br>
within a range of from 16 to 18%.<br>
The above erased state may also be obtained by<br>
irradiation with the writing power in a direct current<br>
fashion to melt the recording layer, followed by<br>
resolidification, without necessarily modulating the<br>
focused recording laser beam in accordance with a<br>
practical recording pulse-generating method.<br>
In order to obtain the desired initial crystalline<br>
state of the phase-change recording material to be used<br>
for the recording layer in the present invention, it is<br>
particularly important to set the scanning velocity of<br>
the initialization energy beam relative to the recording<br>
layer plane. Basically, it is important that the<br>
crystalline state after initial crystallization is<br>
similar to the crystalline state at the erased portion<br>
after recording, and accordingly, the scanning velocity<br>
is in the vicinity of the relative scanning linear<br>
velocity of the focused laser beam to the recording layer<br>
face when practical recording is carried out by using a<br>
focused laser.beam. Specifically, the initialization<br>
energy beam is scanned at a linear velocity of from about<br>
2 0 to about 80% of the maximum linear velocity when<br>
recording is carried out on the optical information<br>
recording medium.<br>
The maximum linear velocity for recording is, for<br>
example, a linear velocity when the erase ratio becomes<br>
at least 2 0 dB at the time of irradiation with an erasing<br><br>
power Pe in a direct current fashion at that linear<br>
velocity.<br>
The erase ratio is defined as the difference between<br>
the carrier level of signals of the amorphous marks<br>
recorded substantially at a single frequency and the<br>
carrier level after erasing by direct current irradiation<br>
of Pe. Measurement of the erase ratio is carried out as<br>
follows for example. Firstly, under recording conditions<br>
under which adequate signal characteristics (i.e. such<br>
characteristics that e.g. the reflectivity and the signal<br>
amplitude or the jitter satisfy specified values) are<br>
obtained, a condition with a high frequency is selected<br>
among modified signals to be recorded, recording is<br>
carried out 10 times at a single frequency to form<br>
amorphous marks, and the carrier level (C.L. at<br>
recording) is measured. Then, the direct current<br>
irradiation is carried out once on the amorphous marks<br>
while changing the erasing power Pe, and the carrier<br>
level at this-time (C.L. after erasing) is measured, to<br>
calculate the difference between C.L. at recording and<br>
C.L. after erasing, i.e. the erase ratio. When the power<br>
Pe of the direct current irradiation is changed, the<br>
erase ratio tends to increase once, decrease and then<br>
increase again in general. Here, the first peak value of<br>
the erase ratio observed when the power Pe starts being<br>
increased is taken as the erase ratio of the sample in<br>
this case.<br><br>
With respect to the scanning rate of the<br>
initialization energy beam, if the initialization energy<br>
beam is scanned at a velocity lower by about 2 0% than the<br>
above defined maximum linear velocity, phase isolation<br>
may occur and a single phase is less likely to be<br>
obtained, or even if a single phase is obtained,<br>
crystallites may extend particularly in the<br>
initialization beam scanning direction and become giant,<br>
or aligned in an unfavorable direction. Preferably, the<br>
initialization energy beam is scanned at a velocity of at<br>
least 30% of the recordable maximum linear velocity.<br>
On the other hand, if the initialization energy beam<br>
is scanned in a velocity equal to the recordable maximum<br>
linear velocity i.e. at a rate higher than about 80% of<br>
that, a region once melted by the initial scanning tends<br>
to be formed into an amorphous state again, such being<br>
unfavorable. This is because when the scanning linear<br>
velocity is high, the cooling rate of the melted portion<br>
tends to be high, and the time for resolidification tends<br>
to be short. With a focused recording laser beam having<br>
a diameter of about 1 micron, recrystallization by<br>
crystal growth from the crystalline region at the<br>
periphery of the melted region can be completed in a<br>
short time. However, in a case where scanning is carried<br>
out with an initialization oval laser beam, the melted<br>
region area in the major axis direction tends to be<br>
large, and accordingly it is necessary that<br><br>
recrystallization during resolidification is carried out<br>
over the entire melted region by lowering the scanning<br>
linear velocity than that at the time of practical<br>
recording. From such a viewpoint, the scanning linear<br>
velocity of the initial energy beam is preferably at most<br>
70% of the recording maximum linear velocity, more<br>
preferably at most 60%, most preferably lower than 50%.<br>
The optical information recording medium of the<br>
present invention has such characteristics that when<br>
initial crystallization is carried out by irradiation<br>
with a laser beam, it is possible to increase the moving<br>
speed of the medium relative to the laser beam. This<br>
makes it possible to carry out initial crystallization in<br>
a short time, and is preferred in view of improvement of<br>
the productivity and the cost reduction.<br>
(Recording and retrieving method of optical information<br>
recording medium)<br>
The recording/retrieving laser beam to be used for<br>
the optical information recording medium of the present<br>
invention is usually a laser beam such as a semiconductor<br>
laser or a gas laser, and its wavelength is usually from<br>
300 to 800 nm, preferably from about 350 to about 800 nm.<br>
Particularly, in order to achieve a high areal density of<br>
at least 1 Gbit/inch2, the focused laser beam diameter is<br>
required to be small, and it is desirable to obtain a<br>
focused laser beam by using a blue to red laser beam<br>
having a wavelength of from 3 50 to 68 0 nm and an object<br><br>
lens having a numerical aperture NA of at least 0.5.<br>
In the present invention, as mentioned above, it is<br>
usually preferred that the amorphous state corresponds to<br>
recording marks. Further, in the present invention, it<br>
is effective to record information by the mark length<br>
modulation system. This is particularly remarkable at<br>
the time of the mark length recording with a shortest<br>
mark length of at most 4 urn, particularly at most 1 pi.<br>
In a case where the recording mark is formed,<br>
recording by a conventional binary modulation system of<br>
the recording laser power may be carried out, however, in<br>
the present invention, it is particularly preferred to<br>
employ a recording method by a multi-level modulation<br>
system of at least ternary modulation wherein off-pulse<br>
periods are provided when a recording mark is formed as<br>
follows.<br>
Fig. 2 is schematic views illustrating the power<br>
pattern of the recording laser beam in the recording<br>
method of an optical information recording medium. When<br>
an amorphous mark which is mark length-modulated into a<br>
length nT (wherein T is the reference clock period, and n<br>
is the mark length possible in the mark length modulation<br>
recording and is an integer), the amorphous mark is<br>
divided into m=n-k (provided that k is an integer of at<br>
least 0) recording pulses, each recording pulse width is<br>
iT (l<i and an off-pulse section with a time of></i>
(l<i accompanies each recording pulse. with respect></i>
 <br>
to the divided recording pulse in Fig. 2, description of<br>
the reference clock period T is omitted in view of<br>
understandability of the figure. Namely, in Fig. 2, a<br>
part which should be described as iT is described simply<br>
as i for example. Here, it is preferred that i
i
be ∑i+∑i=n+j (j is a constant which satisfies -2<j></j>
so as to obtain an accurate nT mark.<br>
At the time of recording, irradiation with a<br>
recording laser beam with an erasing power Pe which may<br>
crystallize the amorphous state is carried out between<br>
marks. Further, at iT (i = l to m) , irradiation with a<br>
recording laser beam with a writing power Pw sufficient<br>
to melt the recording layer is carried out, and at a time<br>

By employing the above recording method, the power<br>
margin or the recording linear velocity margin can be<br>

The above recording system is a system particularly<br><br>
suitable for an optical information recording medium<br>
wherein the phase-change recording material of the<br>
present invention is used for the recording layer. This<br>
is because if the Ge amount is decreased to secure<br>
erasing (recrystallization) in a short time, the critical<br>
cooling rate required for amorphous mark recording tends<br>
to be extremely high, and formation of favorable<br>
amorphous marks tends to be difficult.<br>
Namely, decrease in the Ge amount promotes<br>
recrystallization of the amorphous marks from the<br>
peripheral crystalline portion and at the same time,<br>
increases the crystal growth rate at the time of melting<br>
and resolidification. If the recrystallization speed<br>
from the periphery of the amorphous mark is increased<br>
above a certain level, recrystallization from the<br>
peripheral portion of the melted region proceeds at the<br>
time of resolidification of the melted region formed for<br>
amorphous mark recording, and accordingly the region<br>
which is originally to be formed into an amorphous state<br>
tends to be recrystallized without being formed into an<br>
amorphous state. Accordingly, it is important to set the<br>
bias power Pb to be adequately low, or to adequately<br>
secure the cooling section by making i
(2<i or m-1></i>
Further, if the linear velocity at the time of<br>
recording increases, the clock period is shortened,<br>
whereby the off-pulse section is shortened, and the<br><br>
cooling effect tends to be impaired. In such a case, it<br>
is effective to divide the recording pulse at the time of<br>
nT mark recording, to set the cooling section by the off-<br>
pulse to be at least 1 nsec, more preferably at least 5<br>
nsec by the real time.<br>
[2-2] Application of information recording medium other<br>
than optical information recording medium<br>
The information recording medium of the present<br>
invention can be used as an optical information recording<br>
medium, since reversible phase-change recording at least<br>
by irradiation with laser beam is possible, as described<br>
above. However, the rewritable information recording<br>
medium used in the present invention can be applied to<br>
phase-change recording by passing an electric current to<br>
a microscopic region. Explanation will be made below<br>
with respect to this point.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic view illustrating the<br>
temperature history (curve a) at the time of amorphous<br>
mark recording, and the temperature history (curve b) at<br>
the time of erasing by recrystallization. At the time of<br>
recording, the temperature of the recording layer is<br>
increased to at least the melting point Tm in a short<br>
time by heating with an electric current at a high<br>
voltage and with a short pulse or a high power level<br>
laser beam, and after the electric current pulse or laser<br>
beam irradiation is turned off, the recording layer is<br>
rapidly cooled by heat dissipation to the periphery, and<br><br>
formed into an amorphous phase. When the cooling rate of<br>
the temperature at the time to from the melting point Tm<br>
to the crystallization temperature Tg is higher than the<br>
critical cooling rate for formation of an amorphous<br>
phase, the recording layer is formed into an amorphous<br>
phase. On the other hand, at the time of erasing, the<br>
recording layer is heated to at least the crystallization<br>
temperature Tg and at most about the melting point Tm, by<br>
application of a relatively low voltage or irradiation<br>
with a laser energy at a low power level, and maintained<br>
for at least a certain time, whereby recrystallization of<br>
the amorphous marks proceeds in a substantially solid<br>
phase state. Namely, if the holding time t1 is adequate,<br>
the crystallization will be completed.<br>
Here, regardless of the state of the recording layer<br>
before application of the energy for recording or<br>
erasing, the recording layer is formed into an amorphous<br>
phase when the temperature history of the curve a is<br>
imparted to the recording layer, and the recording layer<br>
is crystallized when the temperature history of the curve<br>
b is imparted to the recording layer.<br>
The reason why the rewritable information recording<br>
medium of the present invention may be used for phase-<br>
change recording by passing an electric current to the<br>
microscopic region, not only as an optical information<br>
recording medium, is as follows. Namely, it is the<br>
temperature history as shown in Fig. 4 that causes a<br><br>
reversible phase change, and the energy source which<br>
causes such a temperature history may be either a focused<br>
laser beam or an electric current heating (Joule heat by<br>
conducting).<br>
The change in the resistivity accompanying the phase<br>
change between the crystalline phase and the amorphous<br>
phase of the phase-change recording material used in the<br>
present invention, is adequately equal to the change in<br>
the resistivity by at least two orders of magnitude, as<br>
obtained by a.GeTe-Sb2Te3 pseudo binary alloy which is<br>
being developed as a non-volatile memory at present,<br>
particularly a Ge2Sb2Te5 stoichiometrical composition<br>
alloy (J. Appl. Phys., vol. 87, pages 4130 to 4133,<br>
2000) . Namely, when the resistivity in an amorphous<br>
state in an as-deposited state, and the resistivity after<br>
crystallization by annealing, of a rewritable information<br>
recording medium using a phase-change recording material<br>
containing a composition represented by the above formula<br>
(1) as the main component, are respectively measured,<br>
whereupon changes by at least three figures are<br>
confirmed. It is considered that the amorphous and<br>
crystalline states obtained by formation into an<br>
amorphous phase and the crystallization by current pulses<br>
are slightly different from the above amorphous state in<br>
an as-deposited state and the above crystalline state by<br>
annealing, respectively. However, it is expected that<br>
also in a case where the phase-change recording material<br><br>
used in the present invention is subjected to phase<br>
change by current pulses, a large change in the<br>
resistivity by a level of two orders of magnitude can<br>
adequately occur, since the above change in the<br>
resistivity by at least three orders of magnitude can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the<br>
structure of one cell of such a non-volatile memory. In<br>
Fig. 5, a voltage is applied between an upper electrode 1<br>
and a lower electrode 2, and an electric current is<br>
applied to a phase-change recording layer 3 containing a<br>
phase-change recording material (hereinafter sometimes<br>
referred to simply as a phase-change recording layer 3)<br>
and a heater portion 4. The phase-change recording layer<br>
3 is covered with an insulant 10 such as SiO2. Further,<br>
the phase-change recording layer 3 is crystallized in the<br>
initial state. In this case, initial crystallization is<br>
carried out by heating the entire system of Fig. 5 to the<br>
crystallization temperature (usually from about 100 to<br>
about 3 0 0°C) of the recording layer. In formation of an<br>
integrated circuit, the temperature increase to such an<br>
extent is commonly carried out.<br>
In Fig. 5, a particularly narrow portion 4 (heater<br>
portion) functions as a local heater, since heat is<br>
likely to generate by the Joule heat by application of an<br>
electric current between the upper electrode 1 and the<br>
lower electrode 2. A reversibly changeable portion 5<br><br>
adjacent thereto is locally heated and formed into an<br>
amorphous phase via the temperature history as shown by<br>
the curve a in Fig. 4, and recrystallized via the<br>
temperature history as shown by the curve b in Fig. 4.<br>
As the reading, a low electric current is passed to<br>
such an extent that the heat generation at the heater<br>
portion 4 can be ignored, and the potential difference<br>
between the upper and lower electrodes is read. Here,<br>
there is also a difference in the electric capacity<br>
between the crystalline and amorphous states, and<br>
accordingly the difference in the electric capacity may<br>
be detected.<br>
Practically, a further integrated memory has been<br>
proposed by employing a semiconductor integrated circuit<br>
formation technology (U.S. Patent 6,314,014), however,<br>
its basic structure is as shown in Fig. 5, and when the<br>
phase-change recording material used in the present<br>
invention is incorporated in the phase-change recording<br>
layer 3, the same function can be realized.<br>
Here, as the energy source which causes the<br>
temperature change as shown in Fig. 4, an electron beam<br>
may also be mentioned. As an example of a recording<br>
device employing an electron beam, a method wherein a<br>
phase-change recording material is locally irradiated<br>
with an electron beam radiated by a field emitter to<br>
cause a phase change, as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
5,557,59 6 may be mentioned.<br><br>
The present invention is not limited to the above<br>
embodiments. The above embodiments are examples, and any<br>
one having substantially the same structure as the<br>
technical idea as disclosed in the scope of the present<br>
invention and having the same effects is included in the<br>
present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to Examples wherein the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention is applied to an<br>
optical information recording medium. However, the<br>
present invention is by no means restricted to the<br>
application to an optical information recording medium<br>
within a range not to exceed the object of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the following Examples, an optical information<br>
recording medium may be referred to simply as "a disk",<br>
"an optical disk", "a phase-change type optical disk"<br>
etc. in some cases.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 to 3 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 and 2<br>
For measurement of the composition of the phase-<br>
change recording material used for the recording layer of<br>
an optical information recording medium, an acid<br>
dissolution ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic<br>
Emission Spectrometry) and a fluorescent X-ray analyzer<br>
were used. With respect to the acid dissolution ICP-AES,<br>
JY 38 S manufactured by JOBIN YVON was used as an<br><br>
analyzer, and the recording layer was dissolved in dil-<br>
HNO3 and quantitative determination was carried out by a<br>
matrix matching calibration method. As the fluorescent<br>
X-ray analyzer, RIX3 0 01 manufactured by Rigaku Denki<br>
Kogyo K.K. was used.<br>
[Preparation of phase-change type optical disk]<br>
On a disk-shape polycarbonate substrate having a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 0.6 mm, having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of 0.31 m, a groove<br>
depth of 29 nm and a groove pitch of 0.74 m, a<br>
(ZnS)80 (Si02)2o layer (80 nm) , a Sb-Ge-In-M-Te layer (13<br>
nm) , a (ZnS) so (SiO2) 20 layer (20 nm) , a Ta layer (2 run)<br>
and a Ag layer (2 00 nm) were formed by a sputtering<br>
method, and a protective coating layer comprising an<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin was further formed to prepare a<br>
phase-change type optical disk.<br>
The values of x, y, z and w when the composition of<br>
the Sb-Ge-In-M-Te recording layer is represented by<br>
{ (Sb1-xGex) 1-yIny}1-z-wMzTew are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Except for Comparative Example 2, the above<br>
compositions were substantially in accordance with the<br>
crystallization speed suitable for the following<br>
evaluation conditions. In the following initial<br>
crystallization and measurement of the disk<br>
characteristics, a glass substrate of 0.6 mm was overlaid<br>
on the opposite side to the laser beam incident side.<br>
[Initial crystallization]<br>
Initial crystallization was tried on each of these<br>
disks as follows. Namely, a disk rotated at 10 m/s was<br>
irradiated with a laser beam having a wavelength of 810<br>
nm and a power of 800 mW and having a shape with a width<br>
of about 1 urn and a length of about 7 5 n so that the<br>
major axis of the laser beam would be perpendicular to<br>
the above guide grooves, and the laser beam was<br>
continuously moved in a radius direction with a feed<br>
amount of 50 m per rotation to try initial<br>
crystallization. Initial crystallization could be<br>
carried out on disks of Examples 1, 2, 3 and Comparative<br>
Example 1 without any problem. However, no<br>
crystallization occurred (the reflectivity was not<br>
changed) on the disk of Comparative Example 2. Initial<br>
crystallization was tried similarly at a linear velocity<br>
of 2 m/s at a laser power of from 400 to 1000 mW,<br>
however, no crystallization occurred. Accordingly, it is<br>
considered that use of the disk of the Comparative<br>
Example 2 as a phase-change type optical disk is<br><br>
substantially difficult. It is considered to be because<br>
the Tb content in the recording layer of Comparative<br>
Example 2 is too high. Here, if the Ge amount is<br>
increased, the crystallization tends to be slower, and<br>
accordingly initial crystallization will be further<br>
difficult.<br>
[Disk characteristics]<br>
With respect to the disks of Examples 1, 2 and 3 and<br>
Comparative Example 1, recording/erasing was carried out<br>
on the guide grooves and the disk characteristics were<br>
evaluated as follows, by means of an optical disk tester<br>
DDU 1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd.<br>
having a pickup with NA of 0.65 and a laser wavelength of<br>
65 0 ran.<br>
Overwriting of EFM+ modulation signal was carried<br>
out at a linear velocity of 14 m/s up to 2000 times, and<br>
the relation between the recording cycle and the jitter<br>
when the recorded signal was retrieved was measured. The<br>
reference clock frequency at the time of recording was<br>
104.9 MHz (reference clock period was 9.53 ns), and the<br>
recording laser division method was as follows.<br>
Namely, when an amorphous mark with a length of nT<br>
(T is the reference clock period, and n is a natural<br>
number of from 3 to 14) was to be formed, the mark<br>
formation laser irradiation time was divided as shown in<br>
Fig. 2(b), and a recording pulse having a writing power<br>
Pw and an off-pulse having a bias power Pb were<br><br>
alternately irradiated. During the period for formation<br>
of the space between marks (crystalline portion), an<br>
erasing laser beam having an erasing power Pe was<br>
irradiated. In Fig. 2 (b) , for all n, m=n-l, i=0.5<br>
(l<i and here pw="16" mw></i>
Pb=0.8 mW and Pe=4.5 mW.<br>
At the time of retrieving, jitter measurement was<br>
carried out at a linear velocity of 3.49 m/s. The jitter<br>
was normalized by a reference clock period of 38.2 ns at<br>
the retrieving linear velocity. Here, the jitter in the<br>
present invention is one obtained by normalizing by the<br>
reference clock period a standard deviation (jitter) of<br>
the difference in time against PLL clock of the leading<br>
edge and the trailing edge of binary signals obtained by<br>
passing the retrieving signals through an equalizer and<br>
LPF, followed by conversion to binary signals by a<br>
slicer. A detailed measurement method is prescribed in<br>
DVD-ROM standard or DVD-RW standard.<br>
The result of the measurement of the relation<br>
between the recording cycle and the jitter when the<br>
recorded signal was retrieved is shown in Fig. 3. Of the<br>
disk of Comparative Example 1 using the Sb-Ge-In type<br>
phase-change recording material, the jitter value<br>
exceeded 11% by the repeated recording 2000 times, and<br>
use of the disk became difficult, whereas of the disks of<br>
Examples 1, 2 and 3 having Tb, Gd and Te added, the<br>
jitter value was at most 10% even after the repeated<br><br>
recording 2000 times. The disk of Comparative Example 1<br>
after the repeated recording 2000 times, was irradiated<br>
with a DC laser beam of 4.5 mW once to try to erase the<br>
recording marks (crystallization), whereupon unerased<br>
marks were clearly shown by the observation on an<br>
oscilloscope. On the other hand, on the disks of<br>
Examples 1, 2 and 3, no such clear unerased marks were<br>
shown by the similar observation.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The following experiment was carried out to indicate<br>
possibility of recording by a change in the electric<br>
resistivity on the phase-change recording material used<br>
in the present invention.<br>
Namely, on a polycarbonate substrate having a<br>
diameter of 12 0 mm, a Ge-In-Sb-Tb amorphous film having a<br>
film thickness of 50 nm and having the same composition<br>
as in Example 1 was prepared by sputtering.<br>
The resistivity of the above amorphous film was<br>
measured, and then the amorphous film was crystallized<br>
and the resistivity of the film after crystallization was<br>
measured.<br>
For initial crystallization, a laser beam having a<br>
wavelength of"810 nm and a power of 800 mW, and having a<br>
shape with a width of about 1 urn and a length of about 75<br>
m was used. While rotating the Ge-In-Sb-Tb amorphous<br>
film formed on the substrate at a linear velocity of 12<br>
m/s, the amorphous film was irradiated with the laser<br><br>
beam so that the major axis of the laser beam would be<br>
perpendicular to the guide grooves formed on the<br>
substrate. Further, the laser beam was continuously<br>
moved in the radius direction with a feed amount of 5 0 m<br>
per rotation to carry out initial crystallization.<br>
For measurement of the resistivity, a resistivity<br>
measurement device Loresta MP (MCP-T3 50) manufactured by<br>
Dia Instruments Co., Ltd. was used.<br>
No accurate resistivity of the amorphous film could<br>
be obtained since the resistivity was too high. However,<br>
in the measurement of another material having the same<br>
film thickness, a resistivity at a level of about 1x10-1<br>
Qcm can be measured, and thus the resistivity of the<br>
composition of Example 1 in an amorphous state is<br>
considered to be higher than 1x10-1 cm. On the other<br>
hand, the resistivity of the Ge-In-Sb-Tb film after<br>
crystallization was 0.52xl0-4 cm.<br>
From the above results, it was found that there is a<br>
change in the resistivity by at least three figures<br>
between the amorphous state and the crystalline state of<br>
the phase-change recording material used in the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is found that the phase-<br>
change recording material used in the present invention<br>
provides a large difference in the resistivity by the<br>
phase change between the amorphous state and the<br>
crystalline state, and can be applied to a rewritable<br>
information recording medium on which recording is<br><br>
carried out by the change in the electric resistance.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
