FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The present invention relates to a flooring having synthetic homogeneous amorphous marble and a manufacturing process of the same, and more particularly to a flooring made of synthetic homogeneous amorphous marble flooring, having a novel appearance, and a manufacturing process of the same.<br>
Composition synthetic marble flooring exhibit excellent endurance and an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and are mainly manufactured such that spot color chips of two or three different types are mixed with a synthetic compound and the mixture undergoes hot rolling, or a predetermined amount of the spot color chips are sprayed onto a pre-manufactured synthetic sheet and the sheet undergoes the hot rolling.<br>
After that, the base sheet is rotated and laminated after the primary rolling, and undergoes a secondary rolling so as to form the amorphous marble pattern, and is sanded and buffed. This process (Korean Laid-open Publication No. 10-1999-69415) is well known, and can remove the formality of the marble, but is limited to manufacture the composition flooring.<br><br>
Moreover, in the conventional vinyl flooring manufactured by the conventional homogeneous press process, the marble pattern exhibits limited variation.<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel homogeneous amorphous marble flooring manufactured by applying a low temperature process previously utilized only in manufacturing a composition vinyl flooring and an appearance of the amorphous marble flooring with an amorphous marble pattern by calendering while rotating and laminating the base sheet, and by applying a face-to-face pressing process in the conventional pressing of manufacturing the conventional homogeneous marble flooring, and a method for manufacturing the same.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a method of manufacturing a homogeneous amorphous marble flooring, comprising the steps of kneading a synthetic resin compound having a low-temperature processing additive with spot color chips having various colors and primarily rolling the kneaded compound to manufacture a primarily rolled sheet, laminating the primarily rolled sheets while cutting the sheet to have a predetermined size and rotating the sheet, performing secondary rolling the laminated sheets by a low-temperature calendering at the temperature of 60 to 100 Â°C to manufacture a semi-manufactured homogeneous amorphous marble flooring having wave patterns and coarse surface, pressing two pieces of the semi-manufactured homogeneous amorphous marble floorings by face-to-face pressing; and cutting the pressed semi-manufactured homogeneous amorphous marble flooring into two pieces in the horizontal direction, and then sanding and buffing the cut pieces.<br>
The low temperature processing additive employed in the present invention is at least one selected from among substituted polyglycol ethers, a mixture of fatty alcohol partial esters and fatty acid esters, preferably a combination of them.<br>
Synthetic resins, which may be employed in the present invention, include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), but the present invention is not limited to the same, and any thermal plastic resin capable of being rolled can be used as the synthetic resin in the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a homogeneous amorphous marble flooring, and the manufacturing process generally includes two processes. First is the process of producing serrn-manufactured amorphous marble flooring, and second is a face-to-face pressing, sanding, and buffing process.<br>
In the semi-manufactured amorphous marble sheet process, multi-colored spot color chips are kneaded with the compound, and the kneaded compound is primarily rolled into a sheet.   The sheet is rotated and laminated, and the laminated sheet is secondarily rolled by low-<br><br>
temperature calendering to yield a semi-manufactured amorphous marble sheet having wave patterns and coarse surface. Though this process has been for the production of composition vinyl flooring in the conventional art, the present invention expands this process to include the wave patterns and the coarse surface.<br>
Moreover, the present invention employs the amorphous marble appearance, not present in conventional vinyl flooring manufactured by the conventional homogeneous pressing, and incorporates the new process of face-to-face pressing in addition to the pressing so as to manufacture a novel homogeneous synthetic marble flooring.<br>
The difference between composition vinyl flooring and homogeneous vinyl flooring is defined in KS (Korean Standard) M3802 which states that vinyl flooring containing 30 % or more additives is homogeneous vinyl flooring and flooring containing 30 % or less additives is composition vinyl flooring.<br>
In the low temperature processing of the present invention, an additive is used for lowering the softening point of base sheet to maintain the activation state of the base sheet even when the temperature of processing goes down in some measure.<br>
In particular, the low temperature calendering process employed in the present invention maintains a low temperature, that is, 60 Â°C to 100 Â°C, of roll for applying high-temperature pressing and low-temperature calendering to the uniformly-laminated sheet having a specific thickness, based on a low temperature treatment capable of processing the base sheet even at lower temperatures compared to conventional processes.<br>
The present invention relates to manufacturing of a novel finished homogeneous amorphous marble flooring by manufacturing a semi-manufactured homogeneous amorphous marble flooring having wave patterns and coarse surface by the calendering and by performing face-to-face pressing on the semi-manufactured homogeneous amorphous marble flooring, and by r^rforming the splitting, sanding, and buffing. The wave pattern and coarse surface are formed by low-temperature calendering. The low-temperature processing additives used in the low-temperature treatment allow the process to be easily performed at the lower temperature than the conventional process, and in more detail, allow the lamination of the base sheet in the vacuum suctioa<br>
If the low-temperature treatment is not used in the present invention, some problems have arisen after low-temperature calendaring process. That is, if the process is carried out at the high temperature of 120 to 150 Â°C as in the conventional process, a roundly-extended pattern is formed instead of wave pattern.<br>
The present invention has solved the above problem by way of low-temperature calendering with low-temperature treatment.<br>
The present invention is made to obtain the wave patterns to form a distinguishable appearance, and the coarse surface is obtained by low-temperature calendering in order to form the wave patterns. In other words, since the coarse surface is appeared when the low-temperature calendering is performed, in order to overcome the coarse surface, the face-to-face<br><br>
pressing and the sanding and buffing are performed so as to make the surface smooth and to make the wave patterns into the soft marble patterns.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, as a result of manufacturing the semi-manufactured homogeneous amorphous marble flooring having the wave patterns and the coarse surface by the high-temperature rolling and the low-temperature calendering, and applying the face-to-face pressing and the sanding and buffing to the semimanufactured homogeneous amorphous marble flooring, it is confirmed that the soft marble patterns different from the appearance of the conventional homogeneous amorphous marble flooring can be obtained.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
According to the present invention, a finished homogeneous amorphous marble flooring is manufactured by calendering, face-to-face pressing, and sanding.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a process for manufacturing a semimanufactured flooring according to the present invention. The process largely includes a raw material compounding process, a kneading process of homogeneously heating and pressing the compounded raw materials, a mixing process of homogeneously mixing the raw materials, and a calendering process of forming an amorphous marble pattern.<br>
In more detail, in order to manufacture the synthetic homogeneous amorphous flooring, first, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compound is kneaded with multi-colored spot color chips and the kneaded compound undergoes a primary rolling so as to manufacture a base sheet, the base sheet is cut and rotated so as to be laminated, and the laminated sheet is processed by secondary rolling by means of a low temperature calendering process, so that the semi-manufactured flooring having wave patterns and coarse surface is manufactured.<br>
The composition of the base sheet 1 comprises 200 to 350 parts by weight of calcium carbonate as a filler, 20 to 40 parts by weight of dioctyl phthalate (DOP) as a plasticizer, 3 to 10 parts by weight of an epoxy, 2 to 10 parts by weight of a Ba-Zn based stabilizer, 2 to 10 parts by weight of a low temperature process additive, and a variety pigment, in 100 parts by weight of PVC (800 to 1,000 degrees of polymerization).<br>
The spot color chip 2 is manufactured such that pigments are compounded into the PVC and the compounded sheet is rolled, and the rolled sheet is pulverized into 0.5 mm to 20 mm by using a pulverizing machine, and the chips having various hardness are used by varying content of the plasticizer different from the content in the base sheet.<br>
The manufacturing process of the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring according to the present invention will be described in detail as follows.<br>
First, a predetermined amount of liquid and powder raw materials are compounded and distributed, the distributed raw materials are kneaded in a Banbury mixer 3 at 120 Â°C to 150 Â°C. The kneaded raw materials are manufactured into a cake-state base sheet 1 using a mixing roll 4 at 100Â°C tol30Â°C.<br><br>
The base sheet 1 and the spot chips 2 having various colors are made into a sheet with a thickness of less than 3.0 mm by a joining calender 5, the sheet is pulverized and heated in an oven 17 at 200 Â°C to 250 Â°C, the heated sheet 1 is rolled into a sheet with a thickness of 1.0 mm to 5.0 mm by a primary calender 8 at 110Â°C to 150 Â°C, the sheet is cut by a cutter 9, and the cut sheet is sucked in vacuum state and rotated by 90 degrees using a 90-degree-rotation equipment 10 and laminated 12 at a predetermined interval to have a step-shape. Here, "laminated at a predetermined interval" means to be laminated while keeping the predetermined interval 13. The spot chips 2 may be independently injected during the primary calendering.<br>
The cutter 9 serves to cut the primarily-rolled base sheet 1 to a predetermined length, and is constructed to cut the base sheet by the predetermined length by detecting the length of the cut sheet 1 using an optical sensor.<br>
The rotation equipment 10 is a vacuum-90-degree rotation equipment, and includes a hollow quadrangular case and a large number of silicon caps 11 attached to the lower side of the case, so as to suck the primarily-rolled base sheet 1 using the vacuum caps 11 at a negative pressure of 2 to 20 kg/cm2, when the sheet 1 is arrived at a desired position. The sucked base sheet 1 is laminated 12 while being rotated along the rails, and is supplied to the secondary calender 14.<br>
Meanwhile, the primarily-rolled base sheet 1 is manufactured by kneading and rolling the compounded PVC and the spot color chips 2, and is marbled in the length direction.<br>
Further, it is preferred to maintain a laminating interval of 100 mm to 500 mm after the rotation by 90 degrees. The pattern of the marble is varied according to the laminating interval and the number of the laminated layers, in other words, if the interval and the number of the laminated layers is small, the desired amorphous marble cannot be obtained because a marble slightly shifted in the width direction is appeared in the existing directed marble when the primarily formed marble is secondarily rolled after the rotation by 90 degrees.<br>
The amount of laminate base sheets 1 depends on the thickness of the sheet 1 and the laminated interval 13, and preferably 2 to 10 sheets are laminated.<br>
These laminated sheets are calendered by the secondary calender 14 at a low temperature of 60 Â°C to 100 Â°C, so that the semi-manufactured marble flooring having the wave patterns and coarse surface is manufactured. At that time, the marbles formed in the length direction are rotated 90 degrees and changed into natural amorphous marble, and the base sheet 1 and the spot color chips 2 are naturally associated with each other. The thickness of the secondary rolled sheet is maintained at 2.5 mm to 4.5 mm.<br>
Fig. 2 is a view illustrating joining the semi-manufactured flooring by pressing in the face-to-face contact manner according to the present invention. The secondary-rolled sheet is cut into sheets of 1 m x 1 m and the sheets are inserted into a mold to be faced each other and pressed at 150 Â°C to 200 Â°C.<br>
Fig. 3 is a view illustrating a splitting process for splitting semi-manufactured<br><br>
flooring into two pieces in the face-to-face pressing according to the present invention. The face-to-face semi-manufactured flooring is cut into pieces with a width of 3 to 5 mm, and the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring with a width of 2 to 3 mm is manufactured by sanding the pieces.<br>
In the present invention, the coarse surface is smooth and the wave patterns is soft through the face-to-face pressing and the sanding, so that the amorphous marble flooring looks like real marble. The homogeneous amorphous marble flooring according to the present invention has the same endurance and stain-resistance as the conventional flooring manufactured by homogeneous pressing and sanding, the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring having scratch or staining can be restored to its original state by easily removing the scratch or staining, and there are no gaps between the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring after installing them.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 are photographs of finished homogeneous amorphous marble flooring according to the present invention. The conventional marble flooring is manufactured by pressing the pieces or the chips and has marble patterns without directional marble patterns or formal marble patterns. However, since the conventional marble flooring uses the same pattern frequently, the conventional marble flooring becomes monotony and old, on the contrary, since the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring according to the present invention has a soft marble pattern different from the conventional marble flooring, the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring according to the present invention is new and distinguishable.<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
In order to manufacture the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring according to the present invention, a predetermined amount of respective liquid and powder raw materials are compounded and distributed. The uniformly distributed raw materials are kneaded in the Banbury mixer 3 by a screw at 120 Â°C to 150 Â°C, and the kneaded raw materials are manufactured into a cake-shaped base sheet 1 by using the mixing roll 4 at 100 Â°C to 130 Â°C.<br>
The base sheet 1 and the sport chip 2 having various colors are manufactured into a sheet with a width lower than 3.0 mm by using the joining calender 5. The base sheet 1 and the spot chips 2 having various colors are made into a sheet with a thickness of less than 3.0 mm by the joining calender 5, the sheet is pulverized and heated in an oven 17 at 200 to 250 Â°C, the heated sheet 1 is made into a sheet with a thickness of 1.0 to 5.0 mm by the primary calender 8 at 110 to 150 Â°C, the sheet is cut to a predetermined size, rotated by 90 degrees by the suction cap 11 of the rotation equipment 10, and laminated 12, and two or ten sheets laminated in the predetermined intervals 13 pass through the secondary calender 14 at 60 to 100 Â°C, so that a sheet with a thickness of 2.5 to 4.5 mm having the wave pattern and the coarse surface is manufactured by the low temperature calendering.<br><br>
The secondarily rolled sheet is cut into a1m x 1 m sheet so as to manufacture the semi-manufactured marble flooring, the semi-manufactured marble flooring is placed in the mold during the face-to-face pressing and pressed at 150 to 200 Â°C (See Fig. 2), the joined sheet is split into two pieces in order to manufacture a semi-manufactured marble flooring having a thickness of 3 to 5 mm (See Fig. 3), and thus the homogeneous amorphous marble flooring with a thickness of 2 to 3 mm is manufactured by sanding the pieces.<br>
