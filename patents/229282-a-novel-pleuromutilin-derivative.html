The present invention relates to tuberculosis treatment, such as treatment of diseases mediated by Mycobacterium, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with pleuromutillns.<br>
Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease mediated by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a major disease in developing countries, as well as an increasing problem in developed areas of the world. Although the infection may be asymptomatic for a considerable period of time, the disease is most commonly manifested as an acute inflammation of the lungs, resulting in fever and a nonproductive cough. If untreated, serious complications and death typically result. Tuberculosis may be generally controlled by antibiotic therapy, such as by treatment with Isoniazid, see e.g. The Merck Index, 12th edition, item 5203; Rifampin (Rifampicin®), see e.g. The Merck Index, 12th edition, item 8382, Streptomycin, see e.g. The Merck Index, 12th edition, item 8983; but a major problem is the development of strain drug resistance against such antibiotics.<br>
We have now found a compound class which shows surprisingly activitiy in the treatment of diseases caused by Mycobacterium, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, e.g. even against dnjg resistant strains.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides the use of a pleuromutilin in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of diseaeses mediated by Mycobacterium.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a method of treating diseases mpdiated by Mycobacterium, comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective, e.g. an anti-mycobacterium effective; amount of a pleuromutilin.<br>
Mycobacterium includes M. tuberculosis. Diseaeses mediated by Mycobacterium include mycobacterium infections. A pleuromutilin for treatment includes one or more pleuromutillns, e.g. a combination of different pleuromutillns. Treatment includes treatment and prophylaxis. A pleuromutilin for use according to the present invention or for treating diseases according to the present invention is designated hereinafter as "a pleuromutilin(s) of (according to) the present invention".<br><br>
A pleuromutilin of the present invention includes a pleuromutiiln in the form of a free base, and, where existing, in the form of a salt, in the form of a solvate and in the form of a salt and a solvate, e.g. and in the form of a complex, such as a cyclodextrin complex. A pleuromutilin of the present invention may exist in the form of isomers and mixtures thereof, e.g. including diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Isomeric mixtures nnay be separated as appropriate, e.g. according to a method as conventional, to obtain pure isomers. The present invention includes a pleuromutilin according to the present invention in any isomeric form and in any isomeric mixture, such as described in patent literature cited below, which patent literature is introduced herein by reference with respect to isomeric forms of pleuromutlins. Preferably the cofiguration in the mutilin ring is the same as in a naturally produced mutilin.<br>
Pleuromutilin, a compound of formula<br><br>
is a naturally occurring antibiotic, e.g. produced by the basidomycetes Pleurotus mutilus and pTpasseckerianus, see e.g. The Merck Index, 12th edition, item 7694. A number of further pleuromutiiins having the principle ring structure of pleuromutilin and having e.g. antibacterial activity, have been developed.<br>
A pleuromutilin of the present invention includes a pleuromutilin having the basic structural elements as set out in formula<br><br>
wherein R is vinyl or ethyl and the dotted line is a bond or is no bond.<br><br>
The following numbering system is used in the present application:<br><br>
The dotted line between positions 19 an 20 (and between positions 1 and 2) is a bond or is no bond. In a compound of formula A or of formula PLEU a hydrogen atom in positions 4, 7 and/or 8 of the ring system may be replaced by deuterium, and if the dotted line between positions 1 and 2 is no bond (single bond between positions 1 and 2) the ring system may be further substituted in positions 1 and/or 2, e.g. by halogen, deuterium or hydroxy. The group -0- in position 14 is further substituted, preferably by a substituted carbonyl group.<br>

Activity against strains of Mycobacterium, e.g. M.tuberculosis nnay be determined according to the following General Test Procedure:<br>
General Test procedure<br>
Is carried out according to the known and appropriate Agar Dilution Test.<br>
Agar is used as a substrate. Shortly before solidifaction of the Agar TEST COMPOUNDS in<br>
different concentrations are added and mixed into the still liquid agar mass (according to the<br>
Agar dilution test). Controls without TEST COMPOUNDS are also prepared for<br>
determination of strain growth ability. The thus prepared agars are inoculated after<br>
solidification with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Incubation is carried out in normal<br>
incubators at ZT'C. As a nutrition medium Middlebrook 7H10 + OADC (Oleic, Albumin,<br>
Dextrose, Catalase) Enrichment (pH 6.71- 6.73) is used.<br>
The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) which is the compound concentration in the agar<br>
which inhibits 99% of strain growth, is detemnined after 3 weeks, 4 weeks and 5 weeks after<br>
inoculation.<br>
Pleuromutilins of the present invention show activity against strains of Mycobacterium, e.g. M.tubercuiosis and are thus useful in the treatment of infectios caused by Mycobacterium. Pleuromutilins of the present invention surprisingly are even active against resistant and multiresistant M.tuberculosis strains, e.g. strains which are resistant against treatment with known pharmaceuticals useful in the treatment of tuberculosis, e.g. Isoniacid, Rifampicin, Streptomycin.<br>
