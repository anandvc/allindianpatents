				<td>A HEMODIALYSIS CARTRIDGE<br>
This invention is related to a cartridge and/or a method that provides an additional step of<br>
iontophoresis to conventional/classic hemodialysis procedure for those patients who have<br>
insufficient kidney functions. It enhances the hemodialysis performance in removing of urea from<br>
the blood using electrical potentials. Similarly, it is also related with the procedures such as<br>
peritoneal dialysis or related with the procedure when some compounds or molecules (charged or<br>
uncharged atoms or molecules, elements or ions) need to be removed from the blood (blood,<br>
plasma or serum) to dialysis solution in acute or chronic poisoning cases. It is possible to increase<br>
the efficiency of the hemodialysis method and to reduce the total time period of the procedure<br>
using this proposed cartridge and/or the method. There are no similar procedures and/or<br>
cartridges in use so far.<br>
Basically, hemodialysis is a process to remove urea and some other toxic compounds<br>
from blood into the hemodialysis solution by passive diffusion. In this procedure, a semi-<br>
permeable membrane is used as a dialysis membrane. While the blood is circulating<br>
continuously at the one side of the hemodialysis membrane, the hemodialysis solution at the<br>
other side, continuously circulates as well. During the process, urea present in the blood at high<br>
concentration, depending on the concentration gradient, it passes through the membrane from<br>
blood to the hemodialysis solution. Thus, the urea concentration in blood decreases by the time.<br>
In conventional hemodialysis procedures, the patient is connected to the hemodialysis machine<br>
for about 4 hours, and urea concentration generally decreases to 50% of the beginning level even<br>
at the best circumstances.<br>
In iontophoresis procedure, by using an electrical current (creating an electrical potential<br>
difference), the ions (molecules or atoms that having a net charge or partially charged) can be<br>
carried to the other side of the membrane according to applied current and electrical charge and it<br>
is possible to control it. Electrodes or similar tools are provided to the both side of the membrane<br>
and the applied electrical current or potential can vary as needed. The ions in the solution/blood<br>
migrate according to their charges and their movement is in proportional to the current. For<br>
instance positively charged ions migrate to the negative electrode side and vice versa. While the<br><br>
charged ions are migrating according to the electrical current, they also drag the uncharged<br>
molecules along with moving molecules. At this instance, traveling from one side to the other<br>
side of the membrane creates a flow, a turbulence occurs (this is called an electro-osmotic flow).1<br>
Therefore the unchanged particles (atoms/molecules) can also be able to pass through the<br>
membrane by being pulled into this vortex or into the motion and, this passage occurs at a much<br>
faster rate than that of passive diffusion.<br>
When the molecular structure of urea investigated, it is seen that some local charges are<br>
present on the molecule. According to the experiments we've conducted, the higher urea<br>
transportation was observed than passive diffusion and cathodal iontophoresis when urea was<br>
present at the positive electrode side because of the positive local charges on the molecule. There<br>
is also a possibility that the electroosmotic current was partially influential for this transfer.<br>
However, during the transfer, if the other small but charged ions like potassium and sodium are<br>
present, the transfer rate decreases; but still the transfer is much larger and faster than the<br>
classical method. These experiments were repeated using human blood obtained from the<br>
patients with uremia and similar results were achieved. With this invention the hemodialysis<br>
procedure is shortened in time and, simultaneously, provided much better result (cleaner blood).<br>
The previously conducted diffusion experiments were repeated with a peristaltic pump<br>
using human blood, hemodialysis solution and the hemodialysis cartridge in new proposed<br>
design. In the analysis of the samples taken from the blood that went through the cartridge, it is<br>
found that the urea level in blood when the iontophoresis procedure was used prompted 3 to 5<br>
times faster rate of decrease than the classical hemodialysis results. In other words, while the<br>
classical hemodialysis procedure takes 4 hours, the iontophoresis procedure of ours lowers the<br>
process time to about 30 minutes, and with much better results (Figure, 1).<br>
If the classical hemodialysis cartridge and proposed iontophoresis procedure is going to<br>
be used together; system is depicted in Figure 2. The cartridge used as a hemodialysis cartridge<br>
for removing urea from the blood simply comprises a holding compartment (Figure-2-1- and<br>
Figure-3-1); and because of the electrodes placed in the cartridge, (Figure-2-A and B; Figure-3-A<br>
and B) electric current can be applied and that, it is also designed for the use of classical<br>
hemodialysis cartridge.<br><br>
Accordingly, in this figure, the point labeled as 1 indicates the entry of blood and the label<br>
2 shows the exit of the blood. The labels 3 and 4 show the entry and exit points of the<br>
hemodialysis solution. The label 5 shows the hemodialysis cartridge's dialysis membrane. The<br>
label B shows positive electrode, and label A represents the negative electrode. Thus, when the<br>
system is activated, the blood and hemodialysis solution is circulating continuously and electric<br>
current is applied and at the end urea can be transferred to the hemodialysis solution with much<br>
faster rale. The labels A and B are the electrodes made by Ag and AgCl or they can be designed<br>
for same purpose in different shape or compositions. If needed, it is possible to use Ag for B, and<br>
AgCl for A.UV or ethylene oxide sterilization can be used for the sterilization of the electrodes.<br>
On the other hand, although the composition of the sterilized electrodes (Figure-2-A and<br>
B; Figure-3-A and B) is preferred to be Ag/AgCl for preventing the pH effect of the electrodes,<br>
they can be also made out of platinum, copper, gold, steel, graphite, vanadium, tungsten, etc. The<br>
composition, shape, design, connection point and their place in and outside of the cartridge, are<br>
not deterministic and specific properties for the electrodes. Some apparatuses which can be used<br>
in formation of electrical gradient may be utilized.<br>
In the experiments, when the clectrohemodialysis procedure was used, the sodium and<br>
potassium levels of the blood and the hemodialysis solutions have been analyzed. When this<br>
procedure used, the level of sodium and potassium is lowered in blood as well. This outcome is<br>
possibly same for some other ions and unchanged molecules. For preventing some possible<br>
complications, the ions and other material in the hemodialysis solution need to be adjusted.<br>
Hemodialysis solutions must be prepared according to the patients' needs. Or, the blood that<br>
exited from the hemodialysis cartridge can be connected to another cartridge and similarly ions<br>
can be replaced using reverse current and the problem can be solved. The hemodialysis<br>
solution(s) (at the beginning and at the supplementary durations) can be prepared according to the<br>
needed requirements of the patient to avoid any possible complications.<br>
Additionally, in these complications (the problems like imbalance of electrolytes and/or<br>
osmotic pressure or similar unwanted outcomes due to iontophoresis) problems can be overcame<br>
by producing a membrane that would have smaller pores. With two membranes present in one,<br>
first one allows the unwanted urea and the other molecules does not allowed by second material<br>
to go through. The application of electrical current to both membrane or by applying the classical<br><br>
methods to the second one (utilizing only the concentration gradient) the possible problems can<br>
be avoided.<br>
There is no research and experiments that have been published so far, the application of<br>
electrical current or potential and the gradual electrical effect have not been tried for the<br>
hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or removing unwanted molecules, ions etc. from the blood or<br>
other body fluid using a system like our proposed system here. In this study, the addition of<br>
iontophoresis procedure, in terms of shortening the time duration and bettering the quality of<br>
outcome; is a revolutionary format that is at the cutting edge of the known medical technology.<br>
In the literature there is no study or research have been conducted to this end.<br>
This invention, in addition to its speed and quality in the treatment of uremia, it has a high<br>
potential of removing unwanted/unneeded non-polar and especially polar substances during the<br>
acute and chronic poisoning; similarly with electrical current and the cartridge usage the<br>
unwanted items/substances in the blood can be pulled out into the hemodialysis solution. In the<br>
literature we came across that the electrical current lesser than 0.5 mA/cm2 does not cause<br>
damage to the blood or body cells1. For this reason the current that is low than 0.5 mA/cm2 would<br>
be an acceptable for a positive out come. The magnitude of the current can be chosen in required<br>
levels. For the system, direct or alternative current, square, sinus or triangular or even different<br>
frequencies and/or currencies can be applied. In this system, the electrical flow/current does not<br>
make any direct contact with any of the body cells; and therefore, it would be possible to exceed<br>
the electrical level of the aforementioned literature. However, because there is a likelihood of<br>
damaging the blood cells during a high currency flow this would not be recommended.<br>
Additionally, the pH levels was not affected by the Ag/AgCl electrodes, therefore we<br>
preferred. Electrodes can be made with different compounds or also some similar apparatuses<br>
with similar functions can be used. The electrodes may even be simply attached to the classical<br>
hemodialysis cartridges' blood and hem-dialysis solution's entry ports (Figure 3). If the available<br>
classical hemodialysis cartridge will be used, an alternative placement of the electrodes are<br>
shown in Figure 3. In this model, the electrodes can be attached to blood entry port and<br>
hemodialysis solution part as in the previous cases, and the classical hemodialysis cartridge can<br>
be used with minimal modifications. (In this model, electrodes in different composition or some<br><br>
apparatus with similar functions can be used). The electrodes themselves need to be sterilized. In<br>
accompanying figure 3. the labels 1,2,3,4 and 5 are the same labels 1,2,3,4 and 5 are the<br>
same labels as shown in Figure 2.<br>
As a result, this invention will prevent those patients who have insufficient kidney<br>
functions being hooked up to a hemodialysis machine for a long time. It will provide for the<br>
urea, creatine, and some toxic compounds to exit the blood in a better way. Additionally, the<br>
procedure's potential of removing the unwanted elements from the patient's blood stream in<br>
acute and chronic poisonings will provides a very valuable device in the field of medicine.<br>
With the exception of electrodes and similar apparatuses, the cartridge being proposed, in<br>
terms of shape and dimensions is very similar to chose cartridges used in classical hemodialysis.<br>
The difference of the cartridge, such as surface area or its membrane with different pore sizes,<br>
alone is not a distinctive quantification of the proposed device for patent purposes. The sizes,<br>
compositions, or locations (such as one being by the blood inflow side and the other being by the<br>
dialysis side or the solution) of the electrodes and' or some apparatuses with similar functions do<br>
not restrict its applicability for patent rights.<br>
Additionally, the composition of the hemodialysis solution, the properties of the dialysis<br>
membrane (color, texture, latex or biological tissue, pore size, selectivity, etc.), the way, the flow<br>
intensity and the direction of the blood, hemodialysis solution and the number of cartridge used<br>
connected before or after each other are not also deterministic and specific properties of the<br>
invention.<br>
