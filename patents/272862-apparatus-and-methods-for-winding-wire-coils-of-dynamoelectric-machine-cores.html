				<td>APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR WINDING WIRE COILS OF<br>
DYNAMOELECTRIC MACHINE CORES<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns winding wire coils<br>
of dynamoelectric machine cores and in particular it<br>
relates to depositing wire in slots by a wire<br>
dispensing needle having a relative motion with<br>
respect to the core.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Core slots have openings directed towards the<br>
center of a dynamo electric machine core, like the<br>
configuration of stators of DC Brushless motors. The<br>
wire coils consist of wire turns having portions<br>
positioned within the slots and across the end faces<br>
of the core. With such coil and core configurations,<br>
delivery of the wire from the needle occurs by<br>
causing repeated and sequential relative motions of<br>
translation, rotation and radial translation between<br>
the needle and the core.<br>
Either the core or the needle can be moved to<br>
generate the relative motions. The relative<br>
translations are usually parallel to the center axis<br>
(O) of the core in order to form rectilinear portions<br>
of the wire coils, which are placed within the slots<br>
and beyond the ends of the core. The relative<br>
rotational motions are usually around the center of<br>
the core in order to form bridging portions between<br>
two wire coils that are placed across the end faces<br>
of the core. The relative radial translations are<br>
usually in the radial direction of the core in order<br>
to place the turns of the coil according to a<br>
predetermined positioning arrangement, usually<br>
 <br>
referred to as "stratification", along the radial<br>
extension of the slots. Winding principles of this<br>
kind are well known and described in US 6,533,208, US<br>
6,991,194 and US 6,622,955 now assigned to the<br>
assignee of the present application.<br>
In winding scenarios for optimizing the stator<br>
dimensions and increasing the amount of wire that is<br>
required to fill the slots, the needle may not move<br>
within the slots of the core to deliver the wire.<br>
This is particularly due to the large dimensions of<br>
the needle with respect to the slot openings through<br>
which the needle would need to pass to enter or exit<br>
the slots. In addition, due to the large quantity of<br>
wire filling the slots, enough slot spacing would<br>
lack for any movement of the needle.<br>
It follows that for these scenarios it is<br>
desirable that the needle is kept constantly outside<br>
the slots during winding. Accordingly, the wire<br>
leaving the needle needs to be deflected and guided<br>
for entering the slots to reach required<br>
predetermined positions to form the wire coil. Only<br>
in this manner can the turns of the wire coil be<br>
deposited regularly within the slots, i. e. with a<br>
desired position order and without crossing one<br>
another, to achieve a coil having a high amount of<br>
wire placed in a minimum slot space. The accuracy<br>
with which the wire is positioned to form the wire<br>
coils is influenced by the speed of relative motion<br>
of the needles with respect to the core, and by the<br>
positioning accuracy that occurs in the operations<br>
and devices for guiding and positioning the wire<br>
during winding.<br>
US 3,338,526 provides movable needles for winding<br>
stators with wire guides, which are positioned<br>
 <br>
adjacent to the ends of the stator poles. The wire<br>
guides are sustained by support means located within<br>
the interior of the stator. Modern brushless cores<br>
like those wound according to the invention are<br>
designed to be extremely compact with high pole and<br>
wire occupancy. This means that the size of the<br>
cylindrical interior of the core leaves very little<br>
space for structural arrangements required to support<br>
or move the wire guides as shown in US 3,338,526.<br>
US 2,573,976 also provides movable needles for<br>
winding stators with wire guides, which are<br>
positioned adjacent to the ends of the stator poles.<br>
The needle is constrained to move outside the slot of<br>
the stator during the translation strokes that bring<br>
the needle between the two ends of the stator. At the<br>
end of the stator, the needle moves in a radial<br>
direction to bring the wire over a winding guide and<br>
into the slots. The wire is then deflected by the<br>
wire guide onto further wire guides having a conical<br>
configuration. The further wire guides definitely<br>
direct the wire against the end of the stator<br>
according to a random disposition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to<br>
provide a method and apparatus for winding cores of<br>
dynamo electric machines by relatively moving needles<br>
in conjunction with wire guides to deliver wire so<br>
that it becomes accurately positioned to form the<br>
wire coils.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a<br>
method and apparatus that allows winding at elevated<br>
speed and concomitant accuracy in positioning the<br>
wire turns around the poles of the core.<br>
The above and other objects are achieved by an<br>
 <br>
apparatus and method according to the invention for<br>
winding wire coils in slots located adjacent to poles<br>
of a core member of a dynamo electric machine<br>
component, as defined respectively by independent<br>
claims 1 and 24.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined<br>
by the dependent claims and in the following<br>
description.<br>
The principle underlying the invention provides<br>
wire guides that are relatively movable with respect<br>
to the needle and the core so that a wire leaving the<br>
needle can be delivered to predetermined positions<br>
around the poles of the core in order to form the<br>
wire coils. The wire guides are supported adjacent to<br>
the ends of the core by support means partially<br>
occupying positions of the trajectory where the<br>
needle needs to move during winding. The support<br>
means are movable according to the position occupied<br>
by the needle around the poles. The wire guides and<br>
the needle relatively move in the radial directions<br>
of the core to position the wire within the slots<br>
according to an orderly arrangement providing wire<br>
turns located progressively at different radial<br>
distances along the pole<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
A dynamo electric core such as a stator 10 having<br>
a central axis 0 provides slots 11 (generally shown<br>
in the above Figs, and shown in detail in Fig. 5)<br>
 <br>
where a wire W is delivered by a needle 15 for<br>
forming wire turns WT wound around poles 14. In order<br>
to optimise the amount of wire occupancy in the<br>
available space of slots 11, wire turns WT need to be<br>
in line according to the radial direction R of the<br>
slots, and also according to the transverse<br>
directions Y, as shown in Fig. 5. Needle 15 may be<br>
oversized with respect to the dimensions of the<br>
slots, therefore needle 15 may be relatively moved<br>
outside of slots 11 to wind the core, as shown in the<br>
Figs, accompanying the present application.<br>
According to the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, needle 15 and stator 10 are relatively<br>
moved with: translation motions in two opposite<br>
directions P and P', radial translations in two<br>
opposite directions of the stator R and R' , and two<br>
opposite rotations Q and Q'.<br>
The relative translations in directions P and P'<br>
can be obtained by translating the needle with the<br>
solutions described in the above cited prior art. It<br>
should be contemplated that stator 15 is caused to<br>
translate with solutions providing motor drives that<br>
translate housing 25 where the stator is supported<br>
during winding.<br>
The relative translations in directions R and R'<br>
to stratify the wire along the poles can be obtained<br>
by translating the needle in the radial direction of<br>
the stator. The solutions for achieving this radial<br>
movement can be those described in the previously<br>
cited prior art, or the stator is caused to translate<br>
in the radial directions by motor drives that<br>
translate housing 25 where the stator is supported<br>
for winding.<br>
The relative rotation in directions Q and Q' can<br>
 <br>
be obtained by rotating the needle with the solutions<br>
described in the previously cited prior art, or the<br>
stator is caused to rotate with solutions providing<br>
motor drives, like for example a motor and crown<br>
drive that rotate the housing where the stator is<br>
supported for winding.<br>
Figure 5 shows various instances of the winding<br>
process where needle 15 relatively moves from<br>
position A to B, and then from position B to C.<br>
Position A is occupied by the needle at the end of a<br>
relative translation motion (for example in direction<br>
P, i. e. towards the reader observing Fig. 5) to<br>
deliver a portion of a wire turn WT to be wound<br>
around pole 14'. In position A, wire W can be<br>
tensioned against the bottom of the slots and<br>
extending through the slot opening 11' to reach<br>
needle 15, like is shown in Figs. 2 and 5.<br>
After reaching position A, the needle needs to be<br>
relatively rotated in direction Q, and also<br>
relatively translated in direction R, in order to<br>
reach position B. During these movements to reach<br>
position B, wire W overlaps ledge 16 of wire guide 17<br>
to become aligned with area X of the pole where the<br>
wire needs to be definitely located to form the wire<br>
coil. At the same time, wire guide 17 can be<br>
relatively translated in direction R to reach the<br>
alignment of ledge 16 with area X of pole 14' . These<br>
relative movements of the wire guide in the R<br>
direction to align the wire with the various areas of<br>
the pole, as the wire coil continues its formation,<br>
generate a stratification arrangement that optimizes<br>
the wire occupancy in the slots.<br>
By continuing with an opposite relative<br>
translation in direction R', the needle moves to<br>
 <br>
position C, from where it can start opposite relative<br>
translation in direction P'. This movement makes the<br>
needle pass through stator 10, without being present<br>
within the slots in order to reach end 10".<br>
During the movements of the needle between<br>
positions B and C, wire W continues to run on wire<br>
guide 17 so that extension W of the wire is bent to<br>
avoid alignment with tip 12 of the pole, which is<br>
also necessary to guarantee an unimpeded opposite<br>
relative translation in direction P' of needle 15<br>
through stator 10.<br>
In order to continue to form an entire wire turn,<br>
needle 15 relatively travels to opposite end 10" of<br>
the stator, where relative movements of the needle in<br>
conjunction with a second wire guide 17' need to<br>
occur. Wire guide 17' can be similar to wire guide<br>
17, although wire guide 17' needs to be oppositely<br>
oriented, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The relative<br>
movements of needle 15 at end 10", and also those of<br>
wire guide 17', can be similar to those of needle 15<br>
and wire guide 17 previously described as occurring<br>
at end 10', except from the relative rotation of<br>
needle 15 at end 10" that needs to be in opposite<br>
direction Q'. Finally, to complete a wire turn,<br>
needle 15 will return to end 10' by means of a<br>
relative translation in direction P.<br>
Wire guide 17 can be a portion of single piece 19<br>
(see also Figs. 1 and 2), which also has a portion<br>
consisting of wire guide 17'. The two guide portions<br>
can be joined by body portion 19'. Wire guide<br>
portions 17 and 17' can have slanted riser portions<br>
18 where the wire can run to reach ledges 16 while<br>
the needle relatively moves between positions A and<br>
C. Wire guide portions 17 and 17' can be equipped<br>
 <br>
with respective contact surfaces 20 for being gripped<br>
by claw members 21 and 22 (see also Fig. 4a). Claw<br>
members 21 and 22 can grip on surfaces 20 in order to<br>
firmly hold piece 19, and therefore hold wire guides<br>
17 and 17' adjacent to the ends of stator 10, as is<br>
required to accomplish the winding steps described<br>
with reference to Figs. 1-5.<br>
The tips of the claw members can terminate in end<br>
portions that are received in windows 20' of piece<br>
19. The portions of clamps 21 and 22 that engage<br>
surfaces 20 are sized to extensively engage in order<br>
to firmly hold wire guides 17 and 17' in<br>
predetermined relative positions with respect to the<br>
stator during the winding steps described with<br>
reference to Figs. 1-5. Moreover, each of clamps 21<br>
and 22, on its own, is suitable for supporting piece<br>
19. In other words, clamps 21 can be gripping on<br>
respective surfaces 20 to support piece 19 (see Fig.<br>
3) when clamps 22 are not gripping on corresponding<br>
engaging surfaces 20. Similarly, clamps 22 can be<br>
gripping on corresponding engaging surfaces 20 to<br>
support piece 19 when pair of clamps 21 are not<br>
gripping on corresponding engaging surfaces 20 (see<br>
Fig. 4). In this situation, either clamps 21 or<br>
clamps 22 will be singularly holding piece 19.<br>
Accordingly, the clamps that are holding piece 19 can<br>
resemble a cantilever structure arrangement.<br>
Figure 3 shows the situation where clamps 21 are<br>
gripping piece 19, while needle 15 is moving inside<br>
the stator with relative translation in direction P<br>
to reach a position A at end 10' (towards the reader<br>
observing Fig. 3). More particularly as shown in Fig.<br>
3, clamps 21 are holding piece 19, and are doing so<br>
by occupying positions of the winding trajectory<br>
 <br>
along which needle 15 needs to move in conjunction<br>
with wire guide 17 at end 10'. The movements will be<br>
in the manner that has been described with reference<br>
to Fig. 5. Prior to the needle reaching clamps 21, as<br>
they are shown in Fig. 3, clamps 21 need to be moved<br>
out of the way (see Fig. 4) to allow the needle to<br>
reach a position A shown in Figs. 2 and 5. By moving<br>
clamps 21 out of the way, the required trajectory of<br>
needle 15 is no longer occupied by clamps 21,<br>
therefore needle 15 can complete the translation in<br>
direction P, and can also be moved to positions B and<br>
C, like has been described with reference to Fig. 5.<br>
In this situation of clamps 21 having been moved out<br>
of the way and released piece 19, piece 19 can be<br>
supported by clamps 22 so that wire guide portions 17<br>
and 17' are correctly positioned at ends 10' and 10".<br>
Similarly, the necessary movements of needle 15 at<br>
end 10" can occur shifting portion 22a of clamps 22<br>
out of the way, like has been described for clamps 21<br>
when clamps 22 are required to continue to support<br>
piece 19 to maintain the required positions of wire<br>
guide portions 17 and 17' at ends 10' and 10".<br>
As previously described, wire guides 17 and 17'<br>
need to be relatively moved in radial directions R<br>
and R' to align ledge 16 with the area X of the pole<br>
where the wire W needs to be drawn. This relative<br>
movement in the radial direction can be achieved by<br>
moving the stator or the needle in the radial<br>
direction; for example, in Fig. 1 the relative radial<br>
movement occurs by moving the stator housing 25 in<br>
direction R with assembly 26. Assembly 26 provides a<br>
motor and screw drive (the motor is not shown) for<br>
rotating screw 27 in a threaded sleeve portion 27' of<br>
support housing 25. Guide rods 28 can be suitable for<br>
 <br>
supporting and guiding support housing 25 during<br>
movement in directions R and R'.<br>
For actuating clamps 21 and 22 to hold piece 19<br>
according to the foregoing description, two motors 29<br>
and 30 are provided. Each motor is coupled to a<br>
respective shaft 31 and 32. In Fig. 1, motor 30 and<br>
shaft 32 are hidden respectively by motor 29 and<br>
shaft 31. Shafts 31 and 32 have key portions 31',<br>
which engage in ways of respective support sleeves<br>
33a, 33b, 33c, 33d. Each support sleeve carries a<br>
respective clamp of clamps 21 and 22. As shown in<br>
Figs. 3 and 4, clamps 21 are supported by respective<br>
sleeves 33a, 33b, whilst clamps 22 are supported by<br>
respective sleeves 33c, 33d. Support sleeves 33a,<br>
33b, 33c, 33d have an external toothed portion 33'<br>
for meshing with a similar meshing portion of an<br>
adjacent support sleeve 33a, 33b, 33c, 33d, like is<br>
shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for clamps 21.<br>
Rotation of shafts 31 and 32, by means of their<br>
respective motors 29 and 30, causes rotation of<br>
support sleeves 33a, 33b, 33c, 33d, so that clamps 21<br>
or 22 are caused to release or hold piece 19. Motors<br>
29 and 30 can be independently powered by lines 29'<br>
and 30' connected to drive and control means 35,<br>
which can power a bidirectional rotation of motors 29<br>
and 30, in a synchronized and sequenced way achieved<br>
by the previously described operations of causing<br>
clamps 21 and 22 to grip and release piece 19 as a<br>
function of the position of needle 15 around the<br>
pole.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, shaft 32 passes through<br>
support sleeve 33b of clamps 21 (see the left side<br>
support sleeve of Figs. 3 and 4) with a certain<br>
clearance. Shaft 32 reaches and engages a directly<br>
 <br>
opposite support sleeve 33c (partially visible in<br>
Figs. 3 and 4), which carries one of clamps 22. Shaft<br>
32 turns support sleeve 33c of clamps 22, like is the<br>
case for shaft 31, which causes support sleeve 33a<br>
shown on the right side of Fig. 3 to rotate. The<br>
partially hidden support sleeve 33c meshes with the<br>
support sleeve 33d of clamps 22 shown in Figs. 1 and<br>
2. In this way support sleeves 33c, 33d of clamps 22<br>
can be rotated by shaft 32 linked to motor 30,<br>
independently of the rotation of the support sleeves<br>
33a, 33b of clamps 21.<br>
Support sleeves 33a, 33b, 33c, 33d are assembled<br>
on a frame member 36, which can be translated on<br>
guides (not shown) in directions P and P' by means of<br>
screw 37 which can be rotated by motor 38. The<br>
translations of frame member 36 have the effect of<br>
separating more or less wire guides 17 and 17'<br>
respectively from end 10' and end 10" of stator 10.<br>
The separation can occur in synchronization with the<br>
movements of needle 15. For example, guide portion 17<br>
can be brought nearer to end 10' (by rotation of<br>
screw 37 in one direction), before needle 15 arrives<br>
and accomplishes relative motions at end 10', like<br>
those described with reference to Fig. 5. Similarly,<br>
guide portion 17' can be brought nearer to end 10"<br>
(by rotation of screw 37 in opposite direction P' ),<br>
when needle 15 has to accomplish relative motions at<br>
end 10", like those described with reference to Fig.<br>
5. The step of separating guide portions 17 and 17'<br>
more or less from ends 10' and 10" changes the<br>
running distance that wire W needs to accomplish from<br>
ledge 16 of guide portions to stator 10 when needle<br>
15 is relatively moving at ends 10' and 10". This<br>
distance can help in the accuracy with which wire W<br>
 <br>
is positioned on stator 10 and can be determined in<br>
practice as a function of the winding parameters and<br>
the core configurations that need to be wound.<br>
As an alternative to using motors 29 and 30 to<br>
open and close clamps 21 and 22, it should also be<br>
contemplated to couple shafts 31 and 32 to the motor<br>
and mechanical drives for moving needle 15 - as<br>
described in US 6, 533, 208 and US 6, 622, 955 - by<br>
means of gear transmission and cams which synchronize<br>
opening and closing clamps 21 and 22 with the winding<br>
movements of needle 15.<br>
As an alternative for moving wire guides 17 and<br>
17' in radial directions R and R', it should also be<br>
contemplated that motor and guide assemblies (not<br>
shown) would be suitable for moving frame member 38<br>
in radial directions R and R'.<br>
Tube portions 40 may be contemplated to shield the<br>
tips of adjacent poles 14 against catching of wire W<br>
on adjacent poles when winding pole 14'. As shown in<br>
Fig. 1, tube portions 40 can be clamped to clamping<br>
constraint assembly 41, which can be part of the<br>
carriage that moves on guides 28.<br>
With reference to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1,<br>
stator 10 can be positioned with respect to piece 19,<br>
like is required to start winding an unwound stator,<br>
by opening clamps 22, moving housing 25 sufficiently<br>
in direction R to clear guide portions 17 and 17',<br>
and by translating frame member 36 in direction P'.<br>
Although not shown, stator housing 25 may be<br>
equipped with index means for turning stator 10<br>
around axis 0 to position further poles in alignment<br>
with wire guides 17 and 17', like it has been shown<br>
for pole 14'.<br>
Control means 35 can be programmed with algorithms<br>
 <br>
and parameters that can control motors 29 and 30<br>
according to a numerical position control that can<br>
achieve specific rotations of motors 29 and 30, when<br>
the needle is at certain predetermined positions with<br>
respect to the pole. In this way, clamps can be<br>
opened and closed as a function of the needle<br>
position during winding to accomplish the winding<br>
principles described previously with reference to<br>
Figures 1 - 6. This can be provided in a similar<br>
manner also for the other motors: for example for the<br>
motor (not shown) accomplishing the relative movement<br>
of the housing in the radial directions R and R', and<br>
for motor 38 that shifts wire guides 17 and 17' from<br>
the ends of the stator.<br>
A further embodiment of this invention is shown<br>
with reference to Figs. 6-12. Two pieces 50 and 51<br>
for supporting respective wire guide portions 52, 52'<br>
and 53, 53' are positioned through stator 10 (in Fig.<br>
6 stator 10 has been omitted for reasons of clarity,<br>
although it is shown in Figs. 8 - 11). Each of pieces<br>
50 and 51 can be similar to portions of a tube with<br>
wire guide portions 52, 52', 53, 53' formed from<br>
respective structural extensions as shown in Figs. 6<br>
- 12. The structural extensions can be upstanding<br>
portions separated by a certain distance to provide<br>
free spacing that acts as a wire passage 54 during<br>
winding.<br>
Needle 15 can be relatively moved in conjunction<br>
with wire guides 52, 52', 53, 53' at ends 10' and 10"<br>
of the stator, like is shown in Figs. 8-11. More<br>
particularly, Figs. 7 and 8 show needle 15 at the end<br>
10' of the stator when a translation stroke in<br>
direction P is finishing, like is position A of Fig.<br>
5. Here, wire W reaches the needle by passing through<br>
 <br>
passage 54 (see also Fig. 8). From position A, needle<br>
15 can be relatively moved in radial direction R to<br>
reach position A' in order to align wire W above<br>
ledge 16 of wire guide 52 (see also Figs. 7 and 9).<br>
Then, needle 15 can be relatively rotated in<br>
direction Q to pass the wire across pole 14' and<br>
above ledge 16 of wire guide 52 (see Fig. 10). At<br>
this point, pieces 50 and 51 can be relatively<br>
rotated (see Fig. 11) to align wire guide 53 with<br>
pole 14'. This also aligns passage 54 with the slot<br>
where the wire will need to return into stator 10.<br>
Successively, needle 15 can be relatively moved in<br>
opposite radial direction R' and translated in<br>
direction P' back into the stator (see Fig. 11) for<br>
completing a wire turn WT at end 10". During the<br>
initial step of the relative translation in opposite<br>
direction P', needle 15 can pass through passage 55,<br>
whilst wire W passes through passage 54. At the same<br>
time wire W is also drawn definitely across pole 14'<br>
in the position that is aligned with ledge 16 of wire<br>
guide 53. Passage 55 can be an enlargement of the<br>
spacing existing between pieces 50 and 51 as shown in<br>
the figures. At end 10", the needle can continue the<br>
wire turn by accomplishing relative movements in<br>
conjunctions with wire guides 52' and 53', like those<br>
described for end 10' in conjunction with wire guides<br>
52 and 53, except from the relative rotation which<br>
will be substituted by an opposite rotation in<br>
direction Q'. Large spacing 56 is formed between<br>
pieces 50 and 51, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, for<br>
allowing the movements of needle 15 at end 10".<br>
Pieces 50 and 51 can be moved more or less in<br>
directions P and P' to distance wire guides 52, 52' ,<br>
53, 53' more or less from ends 10' and 10" of the<br>
 <br>
stator, for the same reasons that have been described<br>
with reference to the previous embodiment. Pieces 50<br>
and 51 may be distanced from ends 10' and 10"<br>
differently with respect to each other in the step of<br>
Figs. 8-11. More particularly, wire guides 53, 53'<br>
may need to be positioned further from ends 10' and<br>
10" in order to avoid interference with a completely<br>
wound coil (not shown), if present on adjacent pole<br>
14".<br>
As shown in Figs. 13a, 13b and 13c, pieces 50 and<br>
51 can be moved more or less in directions P and P'<br>
to distance wire guides 52, 52', 53 and 53' more or<br>
less from ends 10' and 10" of the stator. In this way<br>
wire guides 52, 52' , 53 and 53' will be more or less<br>
adjacent to a pole being wound in order to support<br>
wire W on ledge 16 until a turn is sufficiently wound<br>
around a pole. Furthermore, wire guides 52, 52', 53<br>
and 53' may need to be positioned at a certain<br>
distance form ends 10' and 10", for accommodating<br>
completely wound coils that have been already wound<br>
around an adjacent pole 14". As shown in Fig. 13a,<br>
wire guides 53 and 53' are maintained at a sufficient<br>
distance from ends 10' and 10" to accommodate the<br>
turns of finished coil C. At the same time wire<br>
guide 52' has been maintained adjacent to end 10" to<br>
continue supporting the turn being formed (see also<br>
Fig. 7) at a required stratification level. In Fig.<br>
13b, wire guide 53 has been brought near to pole 14'<br>
to support wire W when the needle translates through<br>
the stator in direction P' to reach end 10". In Fig.<br>
13c, needle 15 has reached end 10" where it has been<br>
translated in direction R and rotated in direction Q'<br>
to complete the turn. Following the situation of Fig.<br>
13c, wire guides 52, 52', 53 and 53' will be indexed<br>
 <br>
to occupy the positions shown in Fig. 13a so that a<br>
successive turn can be formed.<br>
Figures 8-11 show that during the steps of the<br>
relative motions of needle 15 to wind the wire coil,<br>
certain portions of pieces 50 and 51 occupy positions<br>
of the trajectory of needle 15, when needle 15 needs<br>
to move in other position of its trajectory for<br>
winding.<br>
It has been shown that pieces 50 and 51 are<br>
rotated between two angular positions, and that, as a<br>
result, needle 15 becomes free to accomplish relative<br>
translations in directions P and P'. Also passage 54<br>
has been rotated between two angular positions, so<br>
that wire W can pass through passage 54, when needle<br>
15 accomplishes relative translations in directions P<br>
and P'. Pieces 50 and 51 can be respectively<br>
supported by coupling to shafts 60 and 61. Shafts 60<br>
and 61 can slide in respective guide seats 62 and 63<br>
of shaft 64. Shafts 60 and 61 have a key connections<br>
60 and 61 in guide seats 62 and 63 for transmitting<br>
rotation around axis 0 from shaft 64 to shafts 60 and<br>
61. Shaft 64 is supported on bearings 67 of support<br>
member 68. Motor 66, carried by support member 68 and<br>
coupled to shaft 64 through joint 69, rotates shaft<br>
64 around centre axis O, thereby rotating pieces 50<br>
and 51 around axis O. Linear actuators 69 and 70 have<br>
respective connection arms 71 and 72, which engage,<br>
with their tips 71' and 72f, respectively grooves 73<br>
and 74 extending along the circular surfaces of<br>
pieces 50 and 51. This arrangement causes translation<br>
of pieces 50, 51 in directions P and P' and allows<br>
rotation of pieces 50 and 51 in directions Q and Q',<br>
like has been described in conjunction with Figs. 8 -<br>
11. Translation of pieces 50 and 51 in directions P<br>
 <br>
and P' can be required for distancing wire guides 52,<br>
52', 53, 53' more or less from ends 10' and 10".<br>
Support member 68 is supported on vertical guides 65<br>
of carriage member 7 6 for accomplishing movement in<br>
direction R, and also oppositely to direction R. A<br>
motor (not shown) for turning screw 77, which is<br>
engaged in a threaded sleeve of support member 68,<br>
translates support member 68 on guides 65 to achieve<br>
translation in directions R and R'. Carriage 7 6 can<br>
translate on horizontal guides 78 of the apparatus<br>
frame. A motor and a screw (not shown) can cause<br>
carriage 76 to translate in directions P and P' to<br>
withdraw or to place pieces 50, 51 within the<br>
interior of stator 10 at the start, or the end of the<br>
winding operations. In combination, stator 10 can be<br>
relatively translated in direction R and R' to clear<br>
wire guides 52, 52', 53, 53' when translating<br>
carriage 76 in directions P and P' to withdraw, or to<br>
place, pieces 50, 51 within the interior of stator<br>
10.<br>
Similarly to the solutions presented for the first<br>
embodiments, controls like 35 can be equipped with<br>
algorithms and parameters that can control the motor<br>
66 of the second embodiment according to a numerical<br>
position control, which will cause specific rotations<br>
of pieces 50 and 51, and also of wire passage 54,<br>
when the needle is at certain positions with respect<br>
to the pole. A similar situation can occur for the<br>
other motors of the second embodiment; for example,<br>
the motors not shown for the relative movement of the<br>
housing in the radial directions R and R' and for<br>
translating carriage 78 in directions P and P'.<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown with reference to Figs. 14 - 17.<br>
 <br>
Pieces 150 and 151 carry respectively wire guide<br>
portions 117, and 117'. Pieces 150 and 151 are<br>
positioned external to stator 10. More particularly,<br>
piece 150 is positioned adjacent to end 100' of<br>
stator 10 by means of movement assembly 130, whilst<br>
piece 151 is positioned adjacent to end 100" of<br>
stator 10 by means of movement assembly 131. In Figs.<br>
14 and 15 piece 151 and guide portions 117' can be<br>
seen on the opposite side 100" of the stator, due to<br>
the transparency of housing 125.<br>
Support member 121 carries annular ring 118,<br>
which becomes centred inside the bore of stator 10<br>
(as shown in Figs. 14 - 17) by pushing support member<br>
121 against housing 125.<br>
Support member 121 can be pushed against housing<br>
125 by spring 122, and distanced away from housing<br>
125 by moving shaft 123 in direction P. The mechanism<br>
for moving shaft 123 is not shown for reasons of<br>
clarity.<br>
Annular ring 118 provides gap 120, which is<br>
aligned with the openings of the stator slots 111 by<br>
rotating stator 10 around axis 0 using an index<br>
mechanism (not shown). The edges of gap 120 mask the<br>
edges of the poles, and therefore act as guide<br>
surface for the wire running through the openings of<br>
the stator slots. The index mechanism can be present<br>
in housing 125. Housing 125 bears the stator, as<br>
shown, so that the slots of the stator are aligned<br>
with pieces 150 and 151, and therefore with guide<br>
portions 117 and 117', when requiring to wind the<br>
coils with wire W delivered by needle 115.<br>
Alignment of pieces 150 and 151 with the stator<br>
causes alignment of wire guide portions 117 and 117'<br>
with respective poles and slots where the wire W<br>
 <br>
needs to be wound, like is shown in more detail with<br>
the sequences of Figs. 16 and 17.<br>
With particular reference to Figs. 14 and 15,<br>
piece 150 extends along a circular path on the right<br>
side 160 of stator 10. Piece 150 is supported by<br>
shaft 170 of assembly 130. More particularly, shaft<br>
170	is cantilevered with respect to slide 171. Slide<br>
171	is placed at an eccentric distance XE from centre<br>
axis O and can be moved in direction T or opposite<br>
direction T' by rotation of screw 172 engaged in a<br>
threaded sleeve (not shown) assembled within slide<br>
171. Screw 172 is rotated by pulley, belt and motor<br>
assembly 173. Consequently, slide 171 is moved in<br>
direction T or opposite direction Tf so that piece<br>
150, and therefore guide portion 117, translates in<br>
radial directions R and R' of the stator. Translation<br>
in direction T will move piece 150 and guide portion<br>
117 in direction R, whilst translation in direction<br>
T' will move piece 150 and guide portion 117 in<br>
direction R'<br>
Piece 151 extends along a circular path on left<br>
side 161 of stator 10. Piece 151 is supported by a<br>
shaft (not shown, although similar to shaft 170) of<br>
an assembly 131. Assembly 131 can be equipped with<br>
parts and performances similar to assembly 130, so<br>
that piece 151 and therefore guide portion 117'<br>
respectively translates in radial directions R and R'<br>
on side 100" by means of translations in direction T<br>
and T', respectively.<br>
Frame 174 of assembly 130 for supporting screw<br>
172	and assembly 173 can run on guides 175 to<br>
position piece 150 and guide portion 117 adjacent to<br>
or away from stator end 100, i.e. frame 174 can move<br>
towards or away from the reader observing Fig. 14.<br>
 <br>
Assembly 131 has similar members and performances<br>
to position piece 151 and guide portion 117' adjacent<br>
to or away from stator end 100".<br>
When pieces 150 and 151 have moved away from the<br>
stator/ and also support member 121 has moved away<br>
from the stator, clearance is created for moving<br>
housing 125 between pieces 150 and 151. This is<br>
required when stator 10 has to be aligned with the<br>
winding needle 115, with stator 10 that has been<br>
previously loaded in housing 125 in a location which<br>
is aside with respect to the winding position of<br>
housing 125 shown in Fig. 14 - 17.<br>
Guide portions 117 and 117' are equipped with<br>
ledge surfaces 116 and 116' extending axially away<br>
from pieces 150 and 151, respectively. This is<br>
required so that wire extending from the coil to the<br>
needle can be supported by ledge surfaces 116 and<br>
116' in order to be aligned with areas X of the pole<br>
where the wire needs to be drawn when needle 15 is<br>
relatively moving outside stator 10 at ends 100' and<br>
100".<br>
In other words, guide portions 117 and 117' can<br>
be structural portions extending from pieces 150 and<br>
151 in directions pointing away from respective ends<br>
100 and 100' of the stator where pieces 150 and 151<br>
are adjacent, like is shown for portions 117 and 117'<br>
in Fig. 14. Ledge surfaces 116 and 116' are thus<br>
aligned with areas X of the pole where the wire needs<br>
to be drawn by relative movement of pieces 150 and<br>
151 in direction R and R'. This movement in direction<br>
R and R' is obtained by the movements of pieces 150<br>
and 151 in directions T and T' produced by assemblies<br>
130 and 131, as described in the foregoing.<br>
 <br>
Figures 16 and 17 show winding sequences<br>
occurring with needle 115 at end 100' and using piece<br>
150 and wire guide 117. Similar sequences can occur<br>
with piece 151 and wire guide 117' when needle 115 is<br>
at end 100"<br>
With reference to Fig. 16, guide portion 117 is<br>
aligned with pole 114" that is adjacent to pole 114'<br>
where the wire is being drawn to wind the coil. Edge<br>
117a of guide portion 117 is aligned with slot 111<br>
where the wire W needs to pass to be drawn around<br>
pole 114'. The needle has moved beyond end 100' by<br>
passing wire W through gap 120, i.e. the needle has<br>
moved in direction P towards the reader observing<br>
Fig. 15 and wire W is extending from slot 111 through<br>
gap 120. Guide portion 117 has been relatively moved<br>
in direction R to be in position for alignment of<br>
ledge surface 116 with the area of pole 114' where<br>
the wire W needs to be drawn for the particular<br>
stratification position that is required in the<br>
particular instant of coil winding. Then, (see Fig.<br>
17), needle 115 is relatively moved in direction R to<br>
occupy position 140 to allow wire W to be drawn above<br>
ledge 116. Then, stator 10 can be rotated in<br>
direction RQ' to draw wire W out of needle 115 and<br>
above ledge surface 116. At the end of the rotation,<br>
edge 117a of guide portion 117 is aligned with the<br>
opposite slot 111' of pole 114'. Successively, needle<br>
115 is moved back in direction R' so that it remains<br>
aligned with slot 111' in position 141, which is an<br>
alignment condition for translating the needle into<br>
the hollow space of the stator, i.e. in direction P'<br>
away from the reader observing Fig. 17 in order to<br>
draw the wire through opposite slot 111'. While<br>
moving needle 115 back in direction R', wire W<br>
 <br>
becomes supported by ledge 116 and extends to needle<br>
115 with portion WS in alignment with the opening of<br>
slot 111' (see Fig. 17). Then, needle 115 can be<br>
translated in direction P' to draw the wire around<br>
the pole. The edges of gap 120 of ring 118 will keep<br>
wire W aligned with the opening of slot 111' when the<br>
needle is translating in direction P'. At end 100",<br>
guide portion will have edge 117'a aligned with slot<br>
111'. Therefore, at end 100" similar operations can<br>
occur with guide portion 117' and by means of<br>
opposite rotations RQ of the stator so that the wire<br>
becomes supported by ledge 116', in order to complete<br>
a turn of the coil around pole 114'.<br>
For forming multiple turns of the coils around<br>
pole 140', pieces 150 and 151 will be displaced in<br>
directions T for predetermined increments generated<br>
by motors of assemblies like 173 of assemblies 130<br>
and 131. As a result ledge surfaces 116 and 116' will<br>
become aligned with successive radial positions of<br>
the poles to progressively stratify the wire.<br>
The relative movements of needle 115 in<br>
directions R and R' at end 100' and 100 can be<br>
obtained by predetermined radial movement of housing<br>
125 in direction R and R', like has been shown for<br>
housing 25 of Fig. 1, or by predetermined movement of<br>
needle 115 in directions R and R' using motor and<br>
mechanical drives like those described in US<br>
6,533,208 and US 6,622,955.<br>
