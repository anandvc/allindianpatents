				<td>MICROBIOLOGICALLY SOUND AND STABLE SOLUTIONS OF<br>
GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE SALT FOR THE TREATMENT OF<br>
NARCOLEPSY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to the fields of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions to be used in treatments, such as, sleeping disorders, such as. e.g..<br>
narcolepsy (particularly cataplexy), drug abuse, alcohol and opiate withdrawal, a reduced<br>
level of growth hormone, anxiety, analgesia, effects in certain neurological disorders<br>
such as Parkinson's Disease, depression, certain endocrine disturbances and tissue<br>
protection following hypoxia/anoxia such as in stroke or myocardial infarction, or for an<br>
increased level of intracranial pressure or the like. The present invention particularly<br>
relates to the field of pharmaceutical production of microbiologically resistant and<br>
chemically stable preparations or solutions of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), also<br>
known as 4-hydroxybutyrate, and the sodium salt of GHB (sodium oxybate) and other<br>
salts such as magnesium, ammonium and calcium, e.g.<br>
Background Art<br>
GHB is an endogenous compound with hypnotic properties that is found in many<br>
human body tissues. GHB is present, for example, in the mammalian brain and other<br>
tissues. In brain the highest GHB concentration is found in the hypothalamus and basal<br>
ganglia and GHB is postulated to function as a neurotransmitter (Snead and Morley,<br>
1981). The neuropharmacologic effects of GHB include increases in brain acetylcholine,<br>
increases in brain dopamine, inhibition of GABA-ketoglutarate transaminase and<br>
depression of glucose utilization but not oxygen consumption in the brain. GHB is<br>
converted to succinate and then metabolized via the Krebs cycle. Clinical trials have<br>
shown that GHB increases delta sleep and improves the continuity of sleep<br>
(Ladinsky et al., 1983; Anden and Stock, 1973; Stock et al., 1973; Labont, 1973;<br>
Lapierre et al., 1988; Lapierre el al., 1990; Yamda al., 1967; Grove-White and<br>
Kelman, 1971;Scharf, 1985).<br>
GHB has typically been administered in clinical trials as an oral solution (Lee,<br>
1977; Mamelak, 1977; Hoes, 1980; Scharf, 1985; Scrima, 1990; Gallimberti, 1992;<br>
Series, 1992; Lammers, 1993). GHB treatment substantially reduces the signs and<br>
symptoms of narcolepsy, i.e. daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis and<br>
hypnagogic hallucinations. In addition, GHB increases total sleep time and REM sleep,<br>
and it decreases REM latency (Mamelak et al, 1973; Yamada et al, 1967; Bedard et al,<br>
1989), reduces sleep apnea (Series et al, 1992; Scrima et al, 1987), and improves general<br>
anesthesia (Hasenbos and Gielen, 1985).<br>
GHB has several clinical applications other than narcolepsy and sleep disorders.<br>
GHB has been reported to reduce alcohol craving, the number of daily drinks consumed,<br>
and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in patients (Gallimberti et al., 1989;<br>
Gallimberti et al., 1992; Gessa etal., 1992). GHB has been used to decrease the<br>
symptoms of opiate withdrawal, including both heroin and methadone withdrawal<br>
(Gallimberti et al, 1994; Gallimberti et al., 1993). It has analgesic effects that make it<br>
suitable as a pain reliever (U.S. Patent No. 4,393,236). Intravenous administration of<br>
GHB has been reported to reduce intracranial pressure in patients (Strong, A. 1984).<br>
Also, administration of GHB was reported to increase growth hormone levels in patients<br>
(Gerra et al, 1994; Oyama et al, 1970).<br>
A good safety profile for GHB consumption, when used long term for treatment<br>
of narcolepsy, has been reported. Patients have been safely treated for many years with<br>
GHB without development of tolerance (Scharf, 1985). Clinical laboratory tests carried<br>
out periodically on many patients have not indicated organ or other toxicities (Lammers,<br>
1993; Scrima, 1990; Scharf, 1985; Mamelack, 1977; Mamelak, 1979; Gallimberti, 1989;<br>
Gallimberti, 1992; Gessa, 1992). The side effects of GHB treatment have been minimal<br>
in incidence and degree of severity, though they include sleepwalking, enuresis,<br>
headache, nausea and dizziness (Broughton and Mamelak, 1979; Mamelak et al, 1981;<br>
Mamelak et al, 1977; Scrima et al, 1989; Scrima et al, 1990; Scharf etal, 1985).<br>
The pharmacokinetics of GHB have been investigated in alcohol dependent<br>
patients (Ferrara et al, 1992) and in normal healthy males (Palatini et al, 1993) after oral<br>
administration. GHB possesses a rapid onset and short pharmacological effect<br>
(Ferrara et al., 1992; Palatine et al., 1993; Lee, C, 1977; van der Bogert; Gallimberti,<br>
1989; Gallimberti, 1992; Lettieri and Fung, 1978; Arena and Fung, 1980; Roth and<br>
Giarman, 1966; Vickers, 1969; Lee, 1977). In alcohol dependent patients, GHB<br>
absorption into and elimination from the systemic circulation were fast processes.<br>
Virtually no unchanged drug could be recovered in the urine. There were preliminary<br>
indications that the pharmacokinetics of GHB might be non-linear or dose-dependent<br>
(Ferrara et al., 1992). In the healthy volunteers study, the pharmacokinetics of three<br>
rising GHB doses (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) were investigated. These findings indicate<br>
that both the oral absorption and elimination processes of GHB were capacity-limited<br>
though the degree of dose dependency was moderate (Palatini et al., 1993).<br>
Organic salts and amides of GHB have been produced to reduce the physiological<br>
side effects of GHB (U.S. 5,380,937). Magnesium and calcium salt have been produced<br>
to reduce the hygroscopic nature of GHB or powdered forms (U.S. 4,393,236; British<br>
Patent No. 922,029). However, problems with the storage of GHB solutions still exist.<br>
GHB degrades into gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and possibly other degradants in<br>
solution depending upon the pH and other factors. Also, the contamination by<br>
microorganisms in GHB solutions rapidly surpass acceptable limits, and preservatives<br>
can adversely affect the pH and thus, GHB's stability. As a chronically used product<br>
which requires high levels of drug, the volume of a non-concentrated product creates cost<br>
and handling issues. Thus, there is an immediate need for effective solutions of GHB<br>
that are stable to biological or chemical degradation.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention overcomes deficiencies in the prior art by providing<br>
compositions of GHB in an aqueous medium that are resistant to microbial growth.<br>
These compositions are also resistant to the uncontrolled degradation of GHB into GBL<br>
or other substances. The compositions of the present invention are stable compositions of<br>
GHB that improve shelf-life, and provide a titratable formulation of GHB for easy dose<br>
measurement. In addition, the concentrated solutions embodied in this invention reduce<br>
shipping and storage requirements and allow patients to carry more drugs for their<br>
convenience. The present invention provides methods to treat a number of conditions<br>
treatable by GHB, referred to herein as "therapeutic categories." Therapeutic categories<br>
for the present invention include, but are not limited to, sleeping disorders, drug abuse,<br>
alcohol and opiate withdrawal, a reduced level of growth hormone., anxiety, analgesia,<br>
effects in certain neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease, depression, certain<br>
endocrine disturbances and tissue protection following hypoxia/anoxia such as in stroke<br>
or myocardial infarction, or an increased level of intracranial pressure or other conditions<br>
treatable with GHB.<br>
The invention first provides a pharmaceutical composition of GHB rendered<br>
chemically stable and/or resistant to microbial growth in an aqueous medium. Preferred<br>
GHB salts of the present invention include sodium, ammonium and calcium. As used<br>
herein in certain embodiments, "stable" may mean resistant to degradation of GHB into<br>
its known or unknown decomposition elements. The level of GBL that is acceptable can<br>
be up to 0.1% of the formulation as per the ICH guidelines for shelf-life determination.<br>
As used herein in certain embodiments, "resistant to microbial growth" or "resistant to<br>
microbial challenge" means that the formulations meet the criteria set by the Food and<br>
Drug Administration and the U.S. Pharmacopoeia for products made with aqueous bases<br>
or vehicles, which for bacteria means not less than a 1.0 log reduction from the initial<br>
count at 14 days, and no increase from the 14 days count at 28 days, and for yeast and<br>
molds, no increase from the initial calculated count at 14 and 28 days. As used herein in<br>
certain embodiments, an "aqueous medium" may mean a liquid comprising more than<br>
about 50% water. In certain preferred embodiments, an "aqueous medium" may be a<br>
solution, suspension, gel or emulsion of GHB, with a solution of GHB being most<br>
preferred. Preferred gels are thixotropic gels. Compositions that are resistant to<br>
microbial growth are created by dissolving or mixing GHB in an aqueous medium to a<br>
concentration or content of greater than of about 150 mg/ml GHB to the maximal<br>
solubility of GHB. The solubility of GHB is up to about 750 mg/ml at room temperature<br>
(20°C to about 25°C), however, heating the aqueous medium during preparation up to<br>
100°C will increase GHB solubility to at least about 1000 mg/ml. A preferred<br>
concentration or content of GHB is about 500 mg/ml.<br>
The amount of GHB that may be mixed or dissolved into an aqueous medium and<br>
still be resistant to microbial growth depends upon the pH of the aqueous medium. In<br>
certain embodiments the presence of a preservative may allow the amount of GHB<br>
contained in the compositions of the present invention to be increased and still maintain<br>
resistance to chemical degradation and/or microbial growth. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the pH of the aqueous medium of the pharmaceutical composition is<br>
about 3 to about 10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pH of said aqueous medium is about 6 to about<br>
7.5. The pH may be from about 3.0 to about 10.3, namely of about 3.0, about 3.1.<br>
about 3.2, about 3.3, about 3.4, about 3.5, about 3.6, about 3.7, about 3.8, about 3.9.<br>
about 4.0, about 4.1, about 4.2, about 4.3, about 4.4, about 4.5, about 4.6, about 4.7,<br>
about 4.8, about 4.9, about 5.0, about 5.1, about 5.2, about 5.3, about 5.4, about 5.5,<br>
about 5.6, about 5.7, about 5.8, about 5.9, about 6.0, about 6.1, about 6.2, about 6.3,<br>
about 6.4, about 6.5, about 6.6, about 6.7, about 6.8, about 6.9, about 7.0, about 7.1,<br>
about 7.2, about 7.3, about 7.4, about 7.5, about 7.6, about 7.7, about 7.8, about 7.9,<br>
about 8.0, about 8.1, about 8.2, about 8.3, about 8.4, about 8.5, about 8.6, about 8.7,<br>
about 8.8, about 8.9, about 9.0, about 9.1, about 9.2, about 9.3, about 9.4, about 9.5,<br>
about 9.6, about 9.7, about 9.8, about 9.9, about 10.0, about 10.1, about 10.2, or<br>
about 10.3. and all pH values between each of the listed pH values, of the aqueous media.<br>
This will produce a GHB composition that is resistant to microbial growth as defined by<br>
the test described herein. As used herein, the term "about" generally means within about<br>
10-20%.<br>
These pH values will produce compositions resistant to microbial growth in an<br>
aqueous medium if the amount of GHB added, admixed, or dissolved is from above<br>
about 150 mg/ml to about 450 mg/mi, namely, above about 150 mg/ml, about<br>
160 mg/ml, about 170 mg/ml, about 180 mg/ml, about 190 mg/ml, about 200 mg/ml,<br>
about 210 mg/ml, about 220 mg/ml, about 230 mg/ml, about 240 mg/ml, about<br>
250 mg/ml, about 260 mg/ml, about 270 mg/ml, about 280 mg/ml, about 290 mg/ml,<br>
about 300 mg/ml, about 310 mg/ml, about 320 mg/ml, about 330 mg/ml, about<br>
340 mg/ml. about 350 mg/ml, about 360 mg/ml, about 370 mg/ml, about 380 mg/ml,<br>
about 390 mg/ml, about 400 mg/ml, about 410 mg/ml, about 420 mg/ml, about<br>
430 mg/ml, about 440 mg/ml, to about 450 mg/ml, and all amounts of GHB between the<br>
values listed.<br>
At the medium to high end of the concentration or content of GHB that may be<br>
dissolved or mixed in the aqueous medium, the maximal pH that may be used is reduced<br>
at room temperature. This is shown in Fig. 1, a graphical presentation of acceptable<br>
formulation ranges. At a concentration or content of about 450 mg/ml GHB, the pH may<br>
be of about 3.9 to about 10.3. At a concentration or content of about 500 mg/ml GHB,<br>
the pH may be of about 4.75 to about 10.3. At a concentration or content of about 600<br>
mg/ml GHB, the pH may be of about 6.1 to about 10.3. At a concentration or content of<br>
about 750 mg/ml GHB, the pH may be of about 7.0 to about 10.3. Of course, all pH and<br>
concentration or content values in between each of the listed pH and concentration or<br>
content values are encompassed by the invention.<br>
Certain embodiments may be selected as sub-ranges from these values of GHB<br>
content and aqueous medium pH. For example, a specific embodiment may be selected<br>
as a content of about 170 mg/ml to about 440 mg/ml GHB in an aqueous medium, at a<br>
pH range of about pH 5.5 to about pH 8.7. Another example of how a range may be<br>
selected in an embodiment would be the selection of a content of about 155 mg/ml of<br>
GHB, which is a value between the above listed values, to a content of about 350 mg/ml<br>
of GHB, and the selection of a pH range of the aqueous medium, such as a pH range of<br>
about 8.87, which is a value between the listed pH values, to a pH of about 8.93, which is<br>
another value between the listed values of pH. A third example of ranges that may be<br>
selected for a specific embodiment would be selection of a single content or<br>
concentration of GHB, such as about 200 mg/ml of GHB, and the selection of a pH<br>
range, such as a pH of about 3.5 to about 8.2. A fourth example of ranges that may be<br>
selected for a specific embodiment would be selection of a content or concentration of<br>
GHB over a range, such as about 300 mg/ml to about 400 mg/ml, and the selection of a<br>
single pH value for the aqueous medium, such as a pH of about 3. Another example of a<br>
range selected for an embodiment may be the selection of a single content or<br>
concentration of GHB, such as 400 mg/ml GHB, and a single pH value of the aqueous<br>
medium, such as pH 7.7.<br>
Other examples of how a range of an embodiment of GHB content or<br>
concentration may be selected include a range of GHB content or concentration from<br>
about 200 mg/ml to about 460 mg/ml GHB, encompassing the ranges for GHB described<br>
herein, and a range of pH for the aqueous medium may be from about pH 4.3 to about pH<br>
7, encompassing ranges for GHB in an aqueous medium at room temperature described<br>
herein. Another example would be the selection of a range of GHB content or<br>
concentration from about 153 mg/ml to about 750 mg/ml, and a pH range of about 7 to<br>
about 9, encompassing ranges between the listed values of GHB content and pH<br>
described herein. An example may be the selection as a GHB concentration or content of<br>
about 170 mg/ml to about 640 mg/ml in an aqueous medium, at a pH range of about pH<br>
6.5 to about pH 7.7. Another example of how a range may be selected in an embodiment<br>
would be a content or concentration of about 185 mg/ml of GHB, which is a value<br>
between the listed values, to a content or concentration of about 750 mg/ml of GHB, at a<br>
pH range of about 7.87, which is a value between the listed pH values, to a pH of about<br>
8.91, which is another value between the listed values of pH. An additional example of<br>
ranges that may be selected for a specific embodiment would be a content or<br>
concentration of about 200 mg/ml of GHB at a pH of about 7 to about 8.2. Another<br>
example of ranges that may be selected for a specific embodiment would be a content or<br>
concentration of about 750 mg/ml to about 400 mg/ml at a pH of about 7. Another<br>
example of ranges that may be selected for a specific embodiment would be a content or<br>
concentration of about 300 mg/ml to about 750 mg/ml at a pH of about 8.5 to about 7.<br>
Another example of ranges that may be selected for a specific embodiment would be a<br>
content or concentration of about 400 mg/ml to about 600 mg/ml at a pH of about 9 to<br>
about 5.8. And so forth. Thus, all ranges of pH and GHB concentration or content that<br>
can be selected from the values herein and as would be understood by those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art, are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The chemical stability of GHB is affected by pH, with compositions of GHB in<br>
an aqueous medium with a pH below about 6 being less effective in maintaining the<br>
chemical stability of GHB. Compositions with a pH of greater than about 6.0 are<br>
preferred to produce chemically stable formulations of GHB. Thus, a preferred range to<br>
produce chemically stable GHB would be from about pH 6 to about pH 9. However, all<br>
concentrations or content of GHB in an aqueous medium, as described herein, and as<br>
would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, may be selected to produce<br>
compositions of the present invention.<br>
Additionally, the ranges described above are for a composition at room<br>
temperature, which is defined herein as from about about 20°C to about 25°C, namely,<br>
about 20 °C about 21°C, about 22°C, about 23°C, about 24°C, to about 25°C. Within the<br>
values and ranges of pH described above, the ranges of concentration or content of GHB<br>
may increase at temperatures greater than room temperature. Thus, the maximal content<br>
or concentration of GHB in an aqueous medium at a temperature of from about 26°C to<br>
about 100°C, namely about 26°C, about 27°C, about 28°C, about 29°C, about 30°C, about<br>
31°C, about 32°C, about 33°C, about 34°C, about 35°C, about 36°C, about 37°C, about<br>
38°C, about 39°C, about 40°C, about 41°C, about 42°C, about 43°C, about 44°C, about<br>

of atmospheric pressure may also increase or decrease the solubility of GHB within the<br>
ranges described, and embodiments of the invention with an increased or decreased<br>
content of GHB due to changes in pressure are also encompassed by the invention. Of<br>
course, it is understood that the present invention encompasses embodiments of GHB<br>

microbial growth, and thus act as a preservative. Such excipients include, but are not<br>
limited to, xylitol, mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine,<br>
cellulose, cellulose derivatives, magnesium carbonate and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may contain a<br>

pharmaceutical composition. Other components, such as flavoring agents, salts, and the<br>
like, may be added to the composition. The pH adjusting or buffering agent, aqueous<br>
medium, preservative, flavoring agents, salts, or other ingredient may be any described<br>
herein.<br>
In certain other embodiments, the method of preparing the pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprises admixing GHB, a pH adjusting or buffering agent, and an<br>

In certain embodiments, a second pharmaceutical may be administered with the<br>
composition of GHB. Such a second pharmaceutical may be e.g., a stimulant<br>
administered within the same 24 hour period as the first dose of GHB. The stimulant<br>
may be, e.g., but not limited to, methylphenidate or pemoline to counter the residual<br>
effects of GHB treatment during periods of wakefulness. In certain embodiments, the<br>
method of treating a sleep disorder may include the discontinuation of other second<br>
pharmaceuticals used to control a sleep disorder. Such second pharmaceuticals may<br>
include, but are not limited to, a tricyclic antidepressant.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating any<br>
appropriate therapeutic category of disorder, by administration of GHB compositions of<br>
the present invention as described above for the treatment of sleep disorders. When<br>
GHB is used in methods of treating any therapeutic category of disorder, the GHB<br>
composition of the present invention may be mixed with the aqueous medium, and<br>
optionally pH adjusting or buffering agent or other additives, by the patient or<br>
administrator soon before consumption. The patient may prepare the composition within<br>
a few minutes to hours before administration. Alternatively, one or more of the<br>
components may be premixed for ready use. The components of the GHB composition<br>
of the present invention, GHB, an aqueous medium, pH adjusting or buffering agent,<br>
excipients, preservatives, flavoring agents, and/or other components or additives may be<br>
stored in a container means suitable to aid preservation. Preferably, the container means<br>
is in the form of a set. A "set" as used herein certain embodiments is one or more<br>
components of the composition packaged in a container or other suitable storage means.<br>
The present invention also provides a set for the treatment of a condition<br>
responsive to GHB comprising, in suitable storage means, GHB and a pH adjusting or<br>
buffering agent. In certain embodiments, the GHB and the pH adjusting or buffering<br>
agent are separately packaged. In certain other embodiments the GHB and the pH-<br>
adjusting or buffering agent may be mixed. The set may contain an aqueous medium. In<br>
certain other embodiments, at least one component selected from the group including,<br>
but not limited to, GHB, the pH-adjusting or buffering agent and/or an aqueous medium<br>
is separately packaged. In certain other embodiments, at least two of the components<br>
selected from the group comprising GHB, a pH adjusting or buffering agent and an<br>
aqueous medium are mixed together. In some embodiments, the set further contains a<br>
preservative. Such a set may have one, two, or more components from the group<br>
comprising GHB, a pH-adjusting or buffering agent, an aqueous medium or a<br>
preservative packaged separately. Such a set may have two or more components mixed<br>
together. Thus, both liquid and dry formulations of GHB and other components may be<br>
packaged in a set for mixing before administration, or one or more components may be<br>
premixed and packaged together with other components, or all the components may be<br>
premixed and packaged in a set.<br>
It is understood that the compositions of the present invention, including those in<br>
a set, may be dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier solution as described<br>
below. Such a solution would be sterile or aseptic and may include water, co-solvent<br>
vehicle buffers, isotonic agents, pharmuceutical aids or other ingredients known to those<br>
of skill in the art that would cause no allergic or other harmful reaction when<br>
administered to an animal or human subject. Therefore, the present invention may also<br>
be described as a pharmaceutical composition of GHB with increased stability in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier solution.<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the<br>
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this<br>
invention belongs. Also as used herein, the term "a" "an" or "the" is understood to<br>
include the meaning "one or more". Although any methods and materials similar or<br>
equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present<br>
invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The following drawings form part of the present specification and are included to<br>
further demonstrate certain aspects of the present invention. The invention may be better<br>
understood by reference to one or more of these drawings in combination with the<br>
detailed description of specific embodiments presented herein.<br>
FIG. 1. The Range of Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate's Resistance to Microbial<br>
Growth and Chemical Stability in Aqueous Solution. The ordinate is the pH of solutions<br>
of GHB. The axis is the concentration (mg/ml) of GHB in aqueous solution. The region<br>
below the diagonal line [/] is the range of GHB solubility at room temperature. Greater<br>
solubility can be achieved, up to 1 g/ml, by heating the solution up to 100°C. Three<br>
solutions were adjusted with HCl and were susceptible to microbial growth (A). Two<br>
solutions were pH adjusted with malic acid and were resistant to microbial growth (•).<br>
Of these two solutions, the one at pH 6 contained xylitol as an excipient. Three solutions<br>
were pH adjusted with hydrochloric acid and were resistant to microbial growth (?).<br>
One solution was not pH adjusted and was susceptible to microbial growth (*).<br>
Description of Illustrative Embodiments<br>
I. Formulations of Gamma-Hydroxybutyrates<br>
A. Microbial Growth and Gamma-butvrolactone Formation<br>
The present invention arises from the discovery of chemically stable and<br>
microorganism resistant formulations of GHB in an aqueous medium, preferably a<br>
solution, and the efficacy of these formulations in the treatment of therapeutic categories<br>
of disorders, such as narcolepsy and other sleep disorders. Specifically, GHB is prepared<br>
at a concentration greater than about 150 mg/ml in an aqueous medium, up to the limits<br>
of GHB's solubility or retention in an aqueous medium, to produce the compositions of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The maximum solubility of GHB is affected by the pH of the aqueous medium.<br>
At about pH 4, the maximum amount of sodium-GHB that can be dissolved is about 450<br>
mg/ml. The value of pH that is conducive to GHB solubility increases, as is shown at<br>
Fig. 1, so that the minimal pH that will dissolve 750 mg/ml GHB was found to be about<br>
pH 6.8. This is shown in Table 1.<br>
The pH of the aqueous medium also affects the resistance of the composition to<br>
microbial growth at about 500 mg/ml GHB. GHB at this concentration in an aqueous<br>
medium that is between about pH 5 and pH 9 is resistant to microbial growth, with<br>
compositions at about pH 6 to about pH 7.5 being particularly resistant to microbial<br>
growth. However, at concentrations of GHB greater than about 750 mg/ml above about<br>
pH 7.5, the resistance to microbial growth is reduced. This is shown at Table 2.<br>
The data from Table 1 and Table 2 are graphically shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
concentration of GHB in the composition, when evaluated in relationship to the pH,<br>
affects the resistance of the GHB composition to microbial challenge. Compositions of<br>
GHB at or below 150 mg/ml are poorly resistant to microbial challenge from a pH range<br>
of about pH 3 to about pH 9. However, concentrations of GHB of greater than about 150<br>
mg/ml, up to about 1000 mg/ml of GHB, are believed to be suitably resistant to<br>
microbial contamination at these pH ranges.<br>
The chemical stability of GHB is affected by pH. Accordingly, the method for<br>
preparing GHB, as described herein, particularly as disclosed in the specific examples,<br>
varies with pH. GBL begins to form if the pH is about 6 or less. Compositions with a<br>
pH of greater than about 6.0 are preferred to produce chemically stable formulations of<br>
GHB. Thus, a preferred range to produce chemically stable GHB would be from about<br>
pH 6 to about pH 9. However, any pH or range of pH values where a clinically<br>
acceptable amount of GBL is produced is also contemplated as being preferred, and is<br>
encompassed by the present invention. The range of GBL could be regulatorily<br>
broadened with availability of sufficient toxicological data.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, a pH-adjusting agent may be added to<br>
the composition. The choice of a pH adjusting agent may affect the resistance to<br>
microbial challenge and/or the stability of GHB, as measured by the reduction in<br>
assayable GHB. Compositions of GHB, pH adjusted with malic acid are resistant to both<br>
microbial growth and chemical degradation of GHB, and are preferred. Other pH<br>
adjusting or buffering agents may be selected. Agents that adjust pH that are selected on<br>
this basis will undergo a taste testing study. However, any pH adjusting agent disclosed<br>
herein or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art is contemplated as being<br>
useful in the invention. Of course, any salt, flavoring agent, excipient, or other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable addition described herein or as would be known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art is contemplated as being useful in the invention.<br>
Any of the above formulations may be prepared and/or packaged as a powdered<br>
or dry form for mixing with an aqueous medium before oral administration, or they may<br>
be prepared in an aqueous medium and packaged. After mixing with an aqueous<br>
medium, preferrably to prepare a solution, these formulations are resistant to both<br>
microbial growth and chemical conversion of GHB to GBL, thereby increasing the<br>
shelf-life of therapeutic formulations of GHB in an aqueous medium. These<br>
formulations then provide an easily titratable liquid medium for measuring the dosage of<br>
GHB to be administered to a patient. Additional embodiments of the composition and<br>
methods of preparation are described below and in the examples.<br>
B. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
1. Pharmaceutically Acceptable Carriers<br>
Aqueous compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of<br>
GHB dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or an aqueous<br>
medium. The phrases "pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable" refer to<br>
molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other<br>
untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all<br>
solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and<br>
absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for<br>
pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Insofar as any conventional<br>
media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic<br>
compositions is not appropriate. Supplementary compatible active ingredients can be<br>
incorporated into the compositions. For human administration, preparations should meet<br>
sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by the Food and<br>
Drug Administration (FDA).<br>
The GHB may be lyophilized for more ready formulation into a desired vehicle<br>
where appropriate. The active compounds may be formulated for parenteral<br>
administration, e.g., formulated for injection via intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular,<br>
sub-cutaneous, intralesional, intraperitoneal or other parenteral routes. The preparation<br>
of an aqueous composition that contains a GHB agent as an active component or<br>
ingredient will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure.<br>
Typically, such compositions can be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or<br>
suspensions. Solid forms suitable for using to prepare solutions or suspensions upon the<br>
addition of a liquid prior to injection can also be prepared; and the preparations can also<br>
be emulsified.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions or dispersions; formulations including, e.g., aqueous propylene glycol; and<br>
sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or<br>
dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy<br>
syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage<br>
and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as<br>
bacteria and fungi.<br>
Solutions of the active compounds as free acid or pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salts can be prepared in water suitably mixed with hydroxypropylcellulose and/or a<br>
pharmacueutically acceptable surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol,<br>
liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof as well as in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparation may best contain a preservative to further<br>
prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
A GHB composition of the present invention can be formulated into a<br>
composition in a neutral or salt form. Such salts can be formed from any of the acids and<br>
bases described herein particularly depending on the particular GHB or GHB salt used,<br>
or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The carrier can also be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,<br>
water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene<br>
glycol, or the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can<br>
be maintained, for example, by the use of a substance, such as lecithin (e.g. a coating), by<br>
the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of<br>
surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by any<br>
of the preservatives desribed herein, or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art, including various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be<br>
preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged<br>
absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the<br>
compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in<br>
the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients<br>
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions<br>
are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile<br>
vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients<br>
from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile<br>
injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-<br>
drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional<br>
desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The preparation of<br>
more, or highly, concentrated solutions for direct injection is also contemplated, where<br>
the use of DMSO as solvent (although DMSO may not now be a permitted human drug)<br>
is envisioned to result in extremely rapid penetration, delivering high concentrations of<br>
the active agents to a small area.<br>
Upon formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with<br>
the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The<br>
formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms, such as the type of<br>
injectable solutions described above, but drug release capsules and the like can also be<br>
employed.<br>
For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution<br>
should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with<br>
sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this<br>
connection, sterile aqueous media which can be employed will be known to those of skill<br>
in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage could be dissolved<br>
in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of fluid or injected at the<br>
proposed site of infusion, (see for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" 15th<br>
Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily<br>
occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible<br>
for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual<br>
subject.<br>
The active GHB may be formulated within a therapeutic mixture to comprise<br>
about 100 to about 10,000 milligrams per dose. Multiple doses can also be administered.<br>
In addition to the compounds formulated for parenteral administration, such as<br>
intravenous or intramuscular injection, other pharmaceutically acceptable forms include,<br>
e.g., tablets or other solids; liposomal formulations; time release capsules; and any other<br>
form currently used, including cremes, which then may be admixed with an aqueous<br>
medium for oral administration.<br>
One may also use nasal solutions or sprays, aerosols or inhalants in the present<br>
invention. Nasal solutions are usually aqueous solutions designed to be administered to the<br>
nasal passages in drops or sprays. Nasal solutions are prepared so that they are similar in<br>
many respects to nasal secretions, so that normal ciliary action is maintained. Thus, the<br>
aqueous nasal solutions usually are isotonic and slightly buffered to maintain a pH of 5.5 to<br>
6.5, though other pH ranges disclosed herein the specific examples, such as pH 3 to about<br>
pH 9, or pH 6 to about 7.5, are contemplated. In addition, preservatives, similar to those<br>
used in ophthalmic preparations, and appropriate drug stabilizers, if required, may be<br>
included in the formulation. Various commercial nasal preparations are known and<br>
include, for example, antibiotics and antihistamines and are used for asthma prophylaxis.<br>
The perferred oral formulations may include such normally employed excipients,<br>
as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of xylitol, mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium<br>
stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, magnesium carbonate and the like. These<br>
compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules,<br>
sustained release formulations or powders to be admixed with an aqueous medium. In<br>
certain defined embodiments, oral pharmaceutical compositions will comprise an inert<br>
diluent or assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin<br>
capsule, or they may be compressed into tablets, or the GHB may be packaged separately<br>
from or in combination with the excipients, salts, flavorings or any other components<br>
described herein, to be admixed with an aqueous medium for oral or injectable<br>
formulations, or they may be incorporated directly with the food (i.e. a beverage) of the<br>
diet.<br>
For oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds may be incorporated<br>
with excipients and used in the form of tablets, buccal tablets or tabs, troches, capsules,<br>
elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like, to be admixed with an aqueous<br>
medium. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active<br>
compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be<br>
varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 75% of the weight of the unit,<br>
or preferably between 25-60%. The amount of active compounds in such therapeutically<br>
useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following: a<br>
binder, nutural as gum tragacanth, acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin or synthetic as polyvinyl<br>
acetate; excipients, such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent, such as corn<br>
starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate;<br>
and a sweetening agent, such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a natural<br>
or synthetic flavoring agent. When the dosage unit form is a capsule for admixing with a<br>
specific volume of an aqueous medium, it may contain, in addition to materials of the<br>
above type, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to<br>
otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or<br>
capsules may be coated with sugar, natural or synthetic polymers, or both. A syrup or<br>
elixir may contain the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent, a preservative, a<br>
dye and/or a flavoring.<br>
Additionally, any excipient, salt, acid, pH-mediating, adjusting or buffering<br>
compound or agent, flavoring, solution, solvent, dispersion, glycerol, glycol, oil,<br>
antibacterial and antifungal agents, antibiotics and antihistamines, binders, disintegrating<br>
agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, or any other additive or ingredient from those<br>
enumerated above or in the examples, or in any pharmaceutically acceptable composition<br>
or carrier described herein, or as would be known by one of skill in the art, is<br>
contemplated for use in aqueous mediums or solid forms of the GHB compositions of the<br>
invention. One or more of these compositions may be packaged with GHB or packaged<br>
separately from GHB prior to consumption. If packaged separately, useful compositions<br>
of GHB may be obtained by mixing GHB with the other components with an aqueous<br>
medium prior to consumption. Such components may be packaged in a set, described<br>
below.<br>
2. Sets<br>
Therapeutic sets of the present invention are sets comprising GHB. Such sets<br>
will generally contain, in suitable container, a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation<br>
of GHB. The set may have a single container, or it may have distinct container for each<br>
component, or distinct container for various combinations of components.<br>
When the components of the set are provided in one or more liquid formulations,<br>
the liquid formulation is an aqueous medium, with a sterile aqueous solution being<br>
particularly preferred. The GHB compositions may also be formulated into a syringeable<br>
composition. In which case, the container means may itself be a syringe, pipette, vial,<br>
ampule or other such like apparatus, from which the formulation may be applied to an<br>
infected area of the body, injected into an animal, or even applied to and mixed with the<br>
other components of the set.<br>
However, the components of the set may be provided as dried powder(s). When<br>
reagents or components are provided as a dry powder, the powder can be reconstituted by<br>
the addition of a suitable solvent. It is envisioned that the solvent may also be provided<br>
in another container means.<br>
The container means will generally include at least one vial, test tube, flask,<br>
bottle, pouch syringe or other container means, into which the GHB formulation or<br>
components thereof are placed, preferably, suitably allocated. The sets may also<br>
comprise a second container means for containing a sterile, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
buffer or other diluent.<br>
The sets of the present invention will also typically include a means for<br>
containing the vials in close confinement for commercial sale, such as, e.g., injection or<br>
blow-molded plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained.<br>
Irrespective of the number or type of containers, the sets of the invention may<br>
also comprise, or be packaged with, an instrument for assisting with the<br>
injection/administration or placement of the GHB composition within the body of an<br>
animal. Such an instrument may be a drinking cup, syringe, pipette, or any such<br>
medically approved delivery vehicle.<br>
II. Methods of Treatment with the GHB Compositions<br>
Because GHB has been shown to be effective in treating narcolepsy and sleep<br>
disorders (Lee, 1977; Mamelak, 1977; Hoes, 1980; Scharf, 1985; Scrima, 1990;<br>
Gallimberti, 1992; Series, 1992; Lammers, 1993), reducing alcohol craving and alcohol<br>
withdrawal symptoms, (Gallimberti et al., 1989; Gailimberti et al., 1992; Gessa et al.,<br>
1992), reducing opiate withdrawal symptoms (Gallimberti et al, 1994: Gallimberti et al.,<br>
1993), reducing pain (U.S. Patent No. 4,393,236), reducing intracranial pressure in<br>
patients (Strong, A. 1984), and increasing growth hormone levels in patients (Gerra et al.,<br>
1994; Oyama et al., 1970), the formulations of the present invention are also<br>
contemplated to be useful in the treatment of any of these disorders or conditions in<br>
patients. GHB has also been used alone as a narcotic in patients with a terminal<br>
carcinomatous state. GHB has been used with other analgesics, neuroleptics, or with a<br>
subliminal barbiturate dose for use as an anesthesia. GHB has been used in closed<br>
cranio-cerebral trauma and as a soporific (U.S. 5,380,937). The inventors contemplate<br>
the use of the GHB compositions of the present invention as a narcotic, hypnotic, or as a<br>
soporific. The inventors also contemplate the use of the GHB compositions of the<br>
present invention in combination with analgesics, neuroleptics or barbiturates for use as<br>
an anesthesia. The GHB compositions of the present invention may be prepared and<br>
administered by any of the means described herein, particularly those described in the<br>
section "Pharmaceutical Compositions" and the examples, or by any means as would be<br>
known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques<br>
disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor<br>
to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute<br>
preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the<br>
present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific<br>
embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preferred Embodiments<br>
XYREM™ CLINICAL TRIALS<br>
The inventors developed a liquid formulation composed of GHB, xylitol, and<br>
preservative in water (XYREM™). Subsequent instability of the preservative in this<br>
formulation and a desire to initiate clinical trials in a timely manner led to a change in the<br>
formulation to a foil pouch. One clinical trial utilized a twin-pouch dosage form, with<br>
one side (pouch 1) of the foil packet containing GHB and the other side (pouch 2)<br>
containing the flavoring agents (Xylitol, [NF]; Malic Acid, NF;<br>
Patients were instructed to open the twin-pouch with a scissors, empty the<br>
contents into a dosing cup, add 2 ounces of water, snap the lid on the dosing cup, shake<br>
to dissolve, and drink the entire contents of the cup. Clinical trials conducted by the<br>
inventors have been performed using the twin-pouch dosage form.<br>
However, the inventors have continued development of a liquid solution and have<br>
now overcome inherent problems with particular formulations and/or preservatives. The<br>
inventors have converted patients currently enrolled in a GHB open-label trial to a liquid<br>
solution composed of GHB, malic acid, and water - that is diluted with water<br>
immediately prior to oral administration.<br>
The need for a liquid solution dosage form is further evidenced by the range of<br>
doses being used in a subsequent GHB open-label trial. Three sizes of pouches were<br>
prepared for the GHB open-label trial: 1.5 grams, 3.0 grams, and 4.5 grams. The initial<br>
dose for all patients in the GHB open-label trial was 6 grams of GHB nightly in divided<br>
doses. Dosage adjustments were permitted in the first two weeks of the trial as indicated<br>
for intolerance or lack of efficacy. The investigator was permitted to decrease the dose<br>
of GHB to 3 grams or 4.5 grams, or increase the dose to 7.5 grams or 9 grams nightly.<br>
After two weeks, further dosage adjustments were made if clinically indicated.<br>
Thirty-five patients had their dose increased, and 16 patients had their dose<br>
decreased. Patients in the lowest dose group were disproportionately female and<br>
weighed 15 kg less than patients in the other two groups. Current dosing levels are noted<br>
below:<br>
To achieve these individualized doses, it has been necessary to provide a<br>
combination of different dose strengths. This complexity would be very difficult to<br>
achieve with a marketed product. In addition, a month's supply of twin-pouches is quite<br>
bulky. A liquid formulation allows for ease in dosing adjustment with one dosage form.<br>
In addition "child-resistant" packaging has been developed with the liquid formulation.<br>
A number of patients have also complained about the flavor with the twin-<br>
pouches. As follow-up the inventors sent questionnaires to participants in the inventors'<br>
clinical trial, and performed taste testing in normal volunteers. The questionnaire<br>
responses, taste testing results, and the clinical experience in narcolepsy patients of the<br>
study administrator have all confirmed that unflavored solutions were acceptable.<br>
The concentration and volume of the GHB solution that the patient administers<br>
will be the same irrespective of whether it is dissolved from the pouch or diluted from<br>
the liquid. This is illustrated in Chart 1 and Table 4:<br>
* Final concentration outside the range of the most stable formulation. This<br>
formulation strength may be only stable at short periods of time such as 48 hours. The<br>
twin pouch version could be solubilized at a a concentration within the preferred range of<br>
pH and GHB concentration for longer term storage.<br>
Apart from the elimination of the sweetener (xylitol) and flavoring, the two<br>
formulations result in identical solutions.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The concentration and volume of the GHB solution that the patient administers is<br>
the same irrespective of whether it is dissolved from the pouch or diluted from the liquid.<br>
Either method may be used to produce acceptably stable solutions of GHB.<br>

SELF PRESERVING FORMULATIONS OF<br>
GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE<br>
SUMMARY OF FORMULATION STUDIES - LIQUID XYREM™<br>
I. Maximum Solubility Range<br>
As seen in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the solubility of GHB varies with pH levels at<br>
room temerature (25°C). Additional amounts of GHB can be solubilized in a gel if heat<br>
is applied, in which case a 1000 mg/ml concentration can be achieved. The inventors<br>
contemplate that though the concentrations or contents of GHB shown in Fig. 1 and<br>
Table 1 are preferred for use, due to the ease of preparing and consuming unheated<br>
preparations, higher concentrations of GHB in aqueous medium may also be made, up to<br>
1000mg/ml.<br>
II. Microbial Testing<br>
The inventors used a three factor analysis involving pH, concentrations of GHB<br>
and the pH adjuster used. As seen in Fig. 1, and Table 2, unacceptably low resistance to<br>
microbial challenge was seen at 150 mg/ml GHB at pH 3, 5, 7, and 9.0, using HCl as the<br>
pH adjusting agent. 150 mg/ml GHB at pH 10.3 without a pH adjusting agent also<br>
proved unacceptably resistant to microbial challenge. Borderline acceptable microbial<br>
preservativeness was seen in a solution pH adjusted with HCl at 500 mg/ml GHB at pH<br>
9. At a concentration of 500 mg/ml at pH 6.0 or 7.5, adjusted with either malic acid or<br>
HCl, and 500 mg/ml at pH 9.0 adjusted with HCl, the formulation is very effective in a<br>
microbial challenge test. The inventors contemplate that a concentration of greater than<br>
about 150 mg/ml of GHB, up to the maximal solubility in aqueous solution of GHB, will<br>
be suitably resistant to microbial challenge from about pH 3 to pH 10.3. Preferably, the<br>
aqueous medium will contain a pH-adjusting or buffering agent.<br>
III. Gamma-butyrolactone Degradation Range<br>
GBL begins to form if the pH is about 6 or less with the formulation tested thus<br>
far.<br>
A. Liquid Formulation Development<br>
The objective of these experiments was to develop a commercial formulation for<br>
sodium gamma hydroxybutyric acid. The initial formulation for sodium gamma<br>
hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) was intended to be an aqueous liquid formulation containing<br>
150mg/mL GHB, preservatives and flavoring agents. To develop this formulation,<br>
studies were conducted to establish the: solubility of the drug in water and as a function<br>
of pH, type and concentrations of suitable preservatives, type and concentrations of<br>
flavor ingredients, and stability of the formulations.<br>
1. Solubility<br>
The feasibility of preparing formulations containing 150 mg/mL of GHB at pH 3,<br>
5 and 7 was established. Solutions containing 150 mg/mL GHB were prepared. The<br>
initial pH was greater than pH 7.5 and the final pH was adjusted to 3, 5 or 7 with<br>
hydrochloric acid. The solutions were observed for precipitation and assayed by HPLC<br>
for GHB content. The results showed that no precipitation was observed and the drug<br>
concentration was found to be 150 mg/mL by HPLC. This information was used as the<br>
basis for additional formulation development studies.<br>
2. Preservatives<br>
Preservative effectiveness studies were conducted to identify a suitable<br>
preservative for the GHB liquid formulation. The following formulations shown in<br>
Table 5 were prepared and tested using Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #6538),<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC #9027) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC #16404).<br>
The preservative used in each formulation is marked with an X. The results<br>
showed that formulations #3, 4, 6 and 9 reduced all three challenge microorganisms by<br>
&gt;99.99% in 48 h of contact time. Formulations #1,5 and 7 reduced all three challenge<br>
microorganism by &gt;99.99% in 7 days of contact time. Formulations #2, 8, 10, 11, 12 and<br>
13 did not reduce Aspergillus niger mold to &gt;99.99%, although some reduction occurred<br>
in 7 days of contact time. Controls #10, 11, 12 and 13 demonstrated activity against<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
3. Stability<br>
Based on the results of the preservative effectiveness testing, five formulations<br>
were selected for stability testing. Table 6 shows the composition of the formulations.<br>
The formulations were packaged in 125 mL, amber PET bottles with safety lined<br>
child-resistant caps and stored upright and inverted at 60°C, 40°C/75% relative humidity<br>
(RH) and 25°C/60% relative humidity. Samples were removed from the stability<br>
chambers after 1, 2 and 3 months and assayed by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) for GHB content. Appearance and pH were also monitored.<br>
Table 7 shows the results for the 3 month time point. Samples stored at 60°C<br>
changed color but samples at all other conditions remained unchanged in color.<br>
The pH of all formulations migrated upward over the three month stability period<br>
60C. The percent increase in pH from initial to 3 months, was greater for the<br>
formulations which were initially adjusted to lower values.<br>
For example, the migration of pH in formulations 1,3 and 4 (adjusted down to pH<br>
3) were 21-30 percent across all conditions in three months. The migration of pH in<br>
formulations 2 and 5 (adjusted down to pH5) were 4.2-12 percent across all conditions in<br>
3 months. Maintenance of pH becomes important for long term storage since<br>
preservatives are known to degrade in formulations having pH levels above<br>
approximately pH 6.<br>
Additionally, development of flavor systems to mask the negative taste of<br>
perservatives is difficult.<br>
4. Liquid Formulation Organoleptic Testing<br>
Based on the above stability data and preservative effectiveness testing, a pH 5<br>
formulation containing potassium sorbate was selected as the primary base formulation<br>
for flavor system development and organoleptic testing. A pH 3 formulation containing<br>
potassium sorbate was selected as the back-up formulation.<br>
B. Dry Powder Formulation Development<br>
Developing a flavor system for the primary and back-up liquid formulations<br>
proved to be difficult and a decision was made to develop a dry powder formulation for<br>
reconstitution with water before consumption. This approach removed the need for a<br>
preservative system, the requirement to adjust pH to levels below pH6, and allowed the<br>
development of a suitable flavor system.<br>
1. Dry Powder Formulation Organoleptic Testing<br>
To develop a flavor system for the powder formulation, several parameters were<br>
evaluated. The flavor attributes of a GHB solution was characterized by a professional<br>
sensory panel. A mimic base containing similar sensory properties as a GHB solution<br>
for flavor system was developed. Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) excipients for<br>
flavor system development were selected. Different excipients (flavorings, sweeteners,<br>
acidulants and flow agents) in the mimic base were screened. Three flavor systems for<br>
the focus group test were selected. A preferred flavor system was optimized based on<br>
comments obtained from the focus group testing. This final formulation with GHB was<br>
optimized.<br>
Based on the above activities, the following formulations in Table 8 were selected<br>
for stability studies:<br>
2. Dry Powder Formulation Stability<br>
A study was initiated to evaluate the stability of the above prototype formulation<br>
in two types of foil packages (high and moderate moisture resistant) as well as the<br>
stability of GHB alone in one type of foil package (high moisture resistant). Table 9<br>
shows the Lots that were placed on stability. The foil packages were a high moisture<br>
resistant pouch and a moderate moisture resistant pouch. The study protocol, Table 10,<br>
required the samples to be stored at 40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% relative humidity for six months,<br>
and 25±2°C/60±5% relative humidity for 12 months. Table 11 shows the tests,<br>
methods, number of packets/test and specifications for the study.<br>
After two months at 40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% relative humidity, the potency (% label<br>
claim) of Lots SPO 8018A and SPO 8018B was less than 94.0%, the lower limit of the<br>
specification, whereas Lot SPO 8018C showed no loss in potency. Lots 8018A and<br>
8018B showed approximately 96% potencies after 2 months at 25°C ± 2°C/65% ± 5%<br>
relative humidity. Lot SPO 8018C again showed no loss in potency at this lower storage<br>
condition.<br>
3. Appearance<br>
After 2 months at 40°C ± 2°C/75% ± 5% relative humidity, Lots SPO 8018A and<br>
SPO 8018B showed significant melting, whereas Lot 8018C showed no melting. Lots<br>
SPO 8018A and SPO 8018B also showed partial melting after 2 months at<br>
25°C ± 2°C/65% ± 5% relative humidity. Lot SPO 8018C again showed no evidence of<br>
melting at this lower storage condition.<br>
Based on the physical changes in state observed during the stability studies, it<br>
was apparent that a solid state interaction between GHB and the excipient blend had<br>
occurred. Since xylitol made up the majority of the excipient blend, it was assumed that<br>
xylitol was the primary source of the drug-excipient interaction. An alternative<br>
hypothesis was also proposed, based on the possibility that the package was mediating<br>
the interaction between GHB and xylitol. Three studies were initiated to test these<br>
hypotheses.<br>
4. Stability of GHB Solids in a Set Container-System<br>
In the first study, the samples that were stored at 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% relative<br>
humidity were transferred to glass vials and then stored at 40 ± 2°C/7 ± 5% relative<br>
humidity. In the second study, mixtures of GHB and xylitol were gently rubbed between<br>
sheets of different types of foil packaging. The mixtures were observed for changes in<br>
physical appearance. In the third study, different mixtures of GHB and xylitol were<br>
prepared. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) thermograms were then done to look<br>
for changes in the thermograms. The results of these studies are summarized below.<br>
Transfer to Glass: Samples of Lot 8018A and Lot 8018C that were previously<br>
stored at 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% relative humidity were transferred to amber screw cap vials<br>
and stored at 40 ± 2°C/75 ±5% relative humidity. Analyses similar to those shown in<br>
Table 6 were done. After 1 month, the potency of Lot 8018A was 94.6% whereas the<br>
potency of Lot 8018C (GHB only) was 100%. In addition, Lot 8018A also showed<br>
evidence of melting. The results supported the hypothesis that GHB and xylitol were<br>
interacting in the solid state and the interaction appeared to be independent of packaging.<br>
Foil Study: Mixtures of GHB and xylitol were placed between folded sheets of<br>
several different foil packaging materials. Slight adhesion of the mixed granules with the<br>
foil lining was observed for all of the foils examined. No direct evidence of melting was<br>
observed, however, even when excessive force was applied to the outer foil surfaces.<br>
This data suggests that the packaging material was not responsible for the solid state<br>
interaction observed during the stability studies.<br>
DSC thermographs were obtained for samples of GHB/xylitol containing<br>
GHB:xylitol mixtures of 33:66, 45:55 and 55 percent 45 respectively. The scans were<br>
conducted at a scan rate of 10°C/min. The thermograms showed that the sample<br>
containing GHB:xylitol 33:66 showed a broad endothermic transition starting at 35°C -<br>
40°C. Samples with higher ratios of GHB:xylitol also showed broad endothermic<br>
transitions that started at temperatures of 45°C - 50°C. The changes seen in the<br>
thermograms supported the hypothesis that a solid state interaction may be occurring<br>
between GHB and xylitol that resulted in low potencies for formulations containing<br>
mixtures of these two agents.<br>
As a result of the changes seen in the DSC thermograms for different mixtures of<br>
GHB:xylitol, a study was initiated to investigate the stability of a formulation containing<br>
GHB.xylitol excipient blend 55:45. A formulation containing GHB.xylitol excipient<br>
blend 33:66 was used as a control sample. The formulations were packaged in glass<br>
vials and stored at 50°C, 40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% relative humidity and 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5%<br>
relative humidity. The appearance and potency of the formulations were monitored<br>
through analyses of stability samples. The stability study also showed potency losses<br>
after 1 month at 40°C ± 2°C/75% ± 5% relative humidity with both the 50/50<br>
GHB:xylitol ratio as well as the original 33/66 ratio formulation. Partial evidence of<br>
melting was also observed in both formulations.<br>
Studies with mixtures of GHB:xylitol excipient blend indicated that the mixture<br>
was incompatible in the solid state. However, when prepared as an aqueous solution,<br>
these mixtures were chemically compatible. Using this information, a decision was<br>
made to package the GHB formulation in dual pouches; one pouch containing GHB<br>
alone and the other containing a mixture of xylitol and the other flavor ingredients. The<br>
formulation will contain equal amounts of GHB and the excipient blend. This product<br>
will be prepared, packaged, and may be checked for stability.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF GAMMA-HYPROXYBUTYRATE<br>
I. Study Objectives<br>
The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of GHB after oral<br>
administration of two consecutive single doses of GHB (3 g/dose; patients generally<br>
ingested the first dose of this medication prior to bedtime and the second dose from 2.5<br>
to 4.0 h later) to narcoleptic patients who are maintained on a chronic regimen of GHB.<br>
II. Study Design<br>
This pharmacokinetic study was conducted as an open-label, single-center<br>
investigation in 6 narcoleptic patients. The study design is summarized as follows:<br>
Narcoleptic patients, 18 years of age or older, who volunteered for this study<br>
were screened at least one day prior to the treatment phase. Each patient was determined<br>
to be in stable health and evaluated for the presence of narcolepsy, defined for the<br>
purposes of this example as one or more years of medical history of narcolepsy as<br>
evidenced by a recent nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and a valid score from a Multiple<br>
Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).<br>
Patients maintained on GHB were allowed to participate. These patients had<br>
been weaned from antidepressants, hypnotics, sedatives, antihistamines, clonidine, and<br>
anticonvulsants though a stable regimen of methylphenidate (immediate release or<br>
sustained release) was allowed. Each patient passed a pre-study physical examination<br>
(which included hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and vital signs measurements)<br>
prior to the commencement of the treatment phase.<br>
Before oral administration of the first GHB dose, an indwelling catheter was<br>
placed in an arm vein and a baseline blood sample was collected. Each patient then<br>
ingested a 3 g dose of GHB before bedtime. Another 3 g GHB dose was administered<br>
4 h after the first dose. Twenty-one sequential blood samples were collected over 12 h<br>
(starting at 10 min after the first dose and ending at 8 h after the second dose). Upon<br>
completion of the treatment phase, a follow-up physical examination which included the<br>
measurement of vital signs was performed on each patient within 48 h after the last blood<br>
sample. A detailed description of the trial methodology is presented in Section IV.<br>
III. Inclusion Criteria<br>
Patients were included in the study if they: had signed an informed consent prior<br>
to beginning protocol required procedures; had not participated in such a study at an<br>
earlier date; were willing and able to complete the entire study as described in the<br>
protocol; were 18 years of age or older at study entry; had not taken any investigational<br>
therapy other than GHB within the 30-day period prior to screening for this study; had an<br>
established diagnosis of narcolepsy for at least one year with documentation from a<br>
qualified laboratory by a nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and a Multiple Sleep Latency<br>
Test (MSLT) which demonstrated mean sleep latency to be less than 5 min and REM<br>
onset in at least 2 of 5 naps; had not been diagnosed with uncontrolled sleep apnea<br>
syndrome, defined as a sleep Apnea Index of 5 or an Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)<br>
greater than 10 per hour or any other cause of daytime sleepiness; and were free of any<br>
medication for their narcolepsy (including hypnotics, sedatives, antidepressants,<br>
antihistamines, clonidine, and anticonvulsants) other than GHB and methylphenidate (IR<br>
or SR). Patients admitted to this study if they were not experiencing unstable<br>
cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic,<br>
metabolic, neurological, pulmonary, and/or renal disease which would place them at risk<br>
during the study or compromise the protocol objective; did not have neurological or<br>
psychiatric disorders (including transient ischemic attacks, epilepsy, or multiple<br>
sclerosis) which, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude the patients' participation<br>
and completion of this study; did not have a current or recent (within one year) history of<br>
alcohol or drug abuse; did not have a serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL, abnormal<br>
liver function tests (SGOT or SGPT more than twice the upper limit of normal, or serum<br>
bilirubin more than 1.5 times normal). Female patients were entered into the study if<br>
they were either post-menopausal (i.e. no menstrual period for a minimum of 6 months),<br>
surgically sterilized or provided evidence of effective birth control. Females of<br>
childbearing potential must agree to continue to use an IUD, diaphragm, or take their oral<br>
contraceptives for the duration of the study. Female patients of childbearing potential<br>
must have a negative pregnancy test upon entry into the study.<br>
IV. Trial Methodology<br>
A time and events schedule is presented in Table 12.<br>
A. Screening Period/Washout<br>
Six narcoleptic patients who were chronically being treated with GHB were<br>
recruited to participate in this pharmacokinetic study. The screening period was at least<br>
one day prior to the treatment phase. During the screening period each patient completed<br>
the following procedures for the assessment of their physical condition: medical history<br>
evaluation; physical examination evaluation; clinical laboratory evaluation; inclusion<br>
criteria review. Each patient's GHB and methylphenidate regimen also were recorded on<br>
an appropriate case report form (CRF). The investigator also ensured that there was at<br>
least an 8-hour washout period for GHB prior to the treatment.<br>
B. Treatment Period / Blood Samples Collection<br>
All patients were hospitalized from approximately four hours prior to first GHB<br>
dosing (around 6 p.m.) until the end of the treatment period (around 10 a.m. the next<br>
morning). Patients ate their dinner at the clinical research unit soon after arrival and<br>
fasted until breakfast next morning. At least three hours elapsed between the completion<br>
of dinner and the administration of the first GHB dose. An indwelling catheter was<br>
placed in an arm vein of each patient for blood sampling at approximately 30 min and 1 h<br>
before the first GHB dose and a baseline blood sample (5 mL) was collected.<br>
The first GHB dose (3 g) was administered at around 10 p.m. Dosing of<br>
individual patients were staggered. The second GHB dose was administered at 4 h after<br>
the first GHB dose (i.e. immediately after the 4 h blood sample). The exact dosing times<br>
in each patient were recorded on appropriate CRF pages. Blood samples (5 mL each)<br>
were collected through the indwelling catheter into heparinized tubes at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,<br>
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4,8, 5, 5.5, 5, 7, 8, 10. and 12 h after the first GHB dose.<br>
Blood samples were processed according to the procedures described herein. Patients<br>
were monitored for adverse experiences throughout the study according to the specific<br>
procedures.<br>
C. Follow-up<br>
Follow-up occurred within 48 h after the last blood sample had been collected.<br>
An abbreviated physical examination which included vital signs measurement was<br>
performed. Adverse experiences and concomitant medication use, if any, were assessed.<br>
Any ongoing adverse experiences and clinically important findings in a patient were<br>
followed to the investigator's and/or sponsor's satisfaction before the patient was<br>
discharged from the study.<br>
D. Methods of Assessment<br>
1. Medical History<br>
The medical history was recorded during the screening period. The history<br>
included gender, age, race, height, prior reaction to drugs, use of alcohol and tobacco,<br>
history and treatment, if any, of cardiovascular pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic,<br>
renal, immunologic, neurological, or psychiatric diseases and confirmation of inclusion<br>
criteria.<br>
2. Physical Examination<br>
Physical Examination included body system review as well as measurement of<br>
body weight and vital signs and a neurological examination.<br>
3. Vital Signs<br>
Vital signs measurements included recording of blood pressure, heart rate,<br>
respiration, and body temperature.<br>
4. Clinical Laboratory<br>
All clinical laboratory tests were performed at a local laboratory. The laboratory<br>
tests and analysis were required of each patient included: hematology, including<br>
hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count and differential;<br>
fasting blood chemistries included blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, glucose,<br>
creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, SCOT<br>
(AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and total<br>
bilirubin; midstream catch urinalysis included specific gravity, pH, protein, occult blood.<br>
ketones and glucose by dipstick determination as well as a microscopic examination of<br>
urine sediment for RBC, WBC, epithelial cells or casts or crystals; and a urine pregnancy<br>
test, if applicable. Any laboratory parameter that was out of range and considered<br>
clinically significant excluded the patient from participation in this study. The<br>
investigator would provide an explanation of all observations that were significantly<br>
outside the reference range.<br>
5. Concomitant Medication<br>
The continued use of a fixed dose of methylphenidate immediate release or<br>
sustained release (IR or SR) is acceptable. The methylphenidate regimen was recorded<br>
on the appropriate case report form.<br>
6. Adverse Experiences<br>
An adverse experience are any undesirable event experienced by a patient or<br>
volunteer whether or not considered drug-related by the investigator. An undesirable<br>
event can be, but is not limited to, subjective symptoms experienced by a patient or.<br>
objective findings such as significant clinical laboratory abnormalities. Adverse<br>
experience is considered synonymous with the term "adverse event".<br>
The investigators report in detail all adverse experiences and symptoms that<br>
occurred during or following the course of trial drug administration for up to 2 days.<br>
Included in the description was the nature of the sign or symptom; the date of onset; date<br>
or resolution (duration); the severity; the relationship to trial treatment or other therapy;<br>
the action taken, if any; and the outcome.<br>
A serious adverse experience is defined as one that is fatal, life threatening,<br>
permanently disabling, or which results in or prolongs hospitalization. In addition,<br>
overdose, congenital anomaly and occurrences of malignancy are always considered to<br>
be serious adverse experiences. An unexpected adverse experience is one not previously<br>
reported.<br>
Any serious or unexpected adverse experience (including death) due to any cause<br>
which occurs during the course of this investigation, whether or not it is related to the<br>
investigational drug, was reported within 24 h by telephone or facsimile. Appropriate<br>
authorities were to be informed if the serious or unexpected adverse experience, in the<br>
opinion of inventors, was likely to affect the safety of other patients or volunteers or the<br>
conduct of the trial.<br>
7. Clinical Supplies-Study Medication<br>
Formulation: Unit 3 g GHB doses (Lot PKl) were obtained from Orphan<br>
Medical. Each unit dose comprised twin foil pouches: one pouch containing GHB and<br>
the other containing a flavor excipient blend. (Table 8 formulation)<br>
Labeling: The clinical supplies for individual patients were packaged in separate<br>
containers. Each container included two unit doses, i.e. two twin-pouches. Clinical<br>
supplies for eight patients (including those for two replacement patients) were delivered<br>
to the investigator. Foil twin-pouches were identified with a two-part label.<br>
Dose Administration: The investigator or designee prepared the oral solution for<br>
dosing within 30 min prior to the first oral administration to individual patients. The<br>
contents of one twin-pouch was emptied into a dosing cup to which two ounces of water<br>
were added. After replacing the lid of the dosing cup, it was gently shaken to dissolve<br>
the GHB and excipient in water. The GHB solution was ingested in its entirety.<br>
Likewise, the second GHB dosing solution was prepared in the same manner and was<br>
ingesting in its entirety at 4 h after the first GHB dose.<br>
Investigational Drug Accountability: At the conclusion of the study, all clinical<br>
supplies were accounted for on the drug accountability form and unused drug supplies<br>
were returned for proper disposition.<br>
8. Determination of Plasma GHB Concentrations<br>
Plasma samples were analyzed for GHB by the Department of Bioanalytical<br>
Chemistry (Covance (previously known as Hazelton Corning), Madison, WI.) A gas<br>
chromatographic method with mass selective detection (GC-MSD) was used in the<br>
analysis.<br>
9. Data Management and Analysis<br>
Data Base: An EXCEL data base (spreadsheet) was constructed from data<br>
recorded on Case Report Forms (CFR) and plasma GHB concentration data sets received<br>
from Covance (Coming Hazleton). Each entry in the EXCEL spreadsheet was checked<br>
against the CRFs and any data entry error found was corrected.<br>
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for<br>
individual sets of plasma GHB concentration vs. time data using the non-compartmental<br>
routine in WinNonlin Version 1.1. The peak GHB concentrations (Cmax) and the times of<br>
their respectively occurrences (tmax) were observed values. Terminal half-life (T1/2) was<br>
obtained by log-linear regression analysis of the terminal phase of concentration vs. time<br>
curves. The area under the curve (AUCinf) and the area under the first moment curve<br>
(AUMCinf) were calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule up to the last determined<br>
concentration and included extrapolated areas to time infinity. Apparent oral clearance<br>
(CL/F) was calculated as Dose/AUCinf. Volume of distribution (Vz/F) was determined<br>
by taking the ratio between CL/F and ?z (elimination rate constant). Mean residence<br>
time (MRT) was estimated from the ratio between AUMCinf and AUCinf.<br>
Safety Analyses: Results of physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory<br>
data were summarized in tabular form and presented by patient number. Adverse events<br>
also were tabulated in a similar fashion.<br>
10. Results<br>
Patient and Study Accountability: Six narcoleptic patients were enrolled and all<br>
six completed the study in its entirety.<br>
Protocol Compliance: There were no inclusion criteria violations. All patients<br>
admitted into the study met the study entrance requirements and completed the screening<br>
phase at least one day before the treatment phase.<br>
All six patients took non-study medications in addition to methylphenidate and<br>
GHB doses because none of their concomitant medications (Synthyroid, Premarin,<br>
Lovastatin, Flovastatin, furosemide, potassium, hydrochlorothiazide, lansoprazole, and<br>
verapamil) were on the exclusion list (which included hypnotics, sedatives,<br>
antidepressants, antihistamines, clonidine, and anticonvulsants). Adverse experience<br>
probes, vital sign measurements, and essentially all pharmacokinetic blood samples were<br>
performed at protocol specified times; the few deviations in blood sampling times should<br>
not have any impact on the outcome of the study since actual blood sampling times were<br>
used in the pharmacokinetic analysis.<br>
The diagnosis of narcolepsy for at least one year in each patient was verified by a<br>
nocturnal polysomnogram (NSG) and a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) conducted<br>
at a qualified laboratory. Five patients have been maintained on GHB nightly for over<br>
10 years and one patient has been receiving GHB nightly for two years. One patient<br>
(Subject 101) also had multiple sclerosis; however, the attending physician, judged that it<br>
would not interfere with the objective of this study. A few of the screening clinical<br>
laboratory results marginally fell outside the reference range but none was considered by<br>
the attending physician to be clinically significant.<br>
Exposure to Study Drug: All patients ingested the two GHB doses as scheduled<br>
(immediately prior to bedtime). The GHB doses per kg body weight ranged from 26.4 to<br>
52.4 mg/kg.<br>
Plasma GHB Concentration Profiles: It was noted that, in certain cases, (Patients<br>
#103, and #106), plasma GHB concentrations did not decline from the first Cmax to zero<br>
concentration at h 4. Upon achievement of the second Cmax, the semi-logarithmic plots of<br>
concentration versus time data in Patients #102, #103, and #105 exhibited a convex<br>
decline profile. Such a decline pattern suggested non-linear pharmacokinetics. The<br>
highest plasma GHB concentration observed in the study was 125.0 µg/mL which<br>
occurred in Subject 101 after the second 3 g GHB dose.<br>
Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimates: The mean (± SD) showed that maximum<br>
GHB concentrations (Cmax) were 62.8 ± 27.4 µg/mL and 91.2 ± 25.6 µg/mL for the first<br>
and second GHB doses, respectively. The corresponding mean observed times to<br>
maximum concentrations were 40 ± 6 and 36 ± 7 min after the first and second GHB<br>
doses, respectively. The mean AUCinf was 17732 ± 4603 µg/mL.h. The mean CL/F was<br>
4.2 ± 1 mL/min/kg and the mean Vr/F was 307 ± 96 mL/kg. The mean MRTinf was<br>
249 ± 56 min. The mean GHB T1/2, estimated by linear regression of log[C] vs. time data<br>
of the terminal phase of the second GHB dose was 53 ± 19 min.<br>
Adverse Experiences: No adverse experiences were reported in the study.<br>
Follow-up Safety Assessments: Inspection of screen and follow-up physical<br>
examination results per individual patient did not identify any changes attributable to<br>
GHB.<br>
11. Discussion<br>
To the inventors' knowledge, the level of GHB in human systemic circulation has<br>
not been reported in the literature. Hence, baseline (0 h) plasma samples were analyzed<br>
for GHB concentrations. The GC-MSD method used in the present study had a limit of<br>
quantification (LOQ) of 7.02 µg/mL and analysis of the baseline plasma samples showed<br>
the endogenous levels of GHB are below this sensitivity limit. This finding was<br>
confirmed by adding known amounts of GHB (5, 10, and 25 µg per mL of plasma) to<br>
blank human plasma samples and subjected these samples to GC-MSD analysis. This<br>
method of standard addition allowed an estimation of the endogenous GHB level in<br>
human plasma which was found to average about 2.02 Mg/mL, (i.e. approximately 2/7 of<br>
the Limit Of Quantitation (LOQ) for a validated assay. Hence, the endogenous GHB<br>
level was not subtracted from exogenous GHB concentrations prior to pharmacokinetic<br>
analysis.<br>
Values of mean tmtK (~ 40 min after dosing) and t1/2 (~35 min) suggest that the<br>
GHB solution administered to narcoleptic patients in this study was readily absorbed and<br>
rapidly eliminated. In 3 out of 6 patients the drug was essentially gone from the systemic<br>
circulation by h4 after the first GHB dose whereas in the remaining three patients<br>
residual GHB levels of ~ 15 µg/mL was still detected at h 4.<br>
The convex nature of the decline of plasma GHB concentrations in three patients<br>
after achievement of the second Cmax indicated that elimination of GHB from the<br>
systemic circulation in these three patients is capacity limited. Nevertheless, it should be<br>
noted that plasma GHB concentrations were no longer detectable by h 6 after the second<br>
GHB dose (10 h after the first GHB dose). The mean apparent oral clearance found in<br>
this study was 4.2 ± 1.0 mL/min/kg and appeared to be comparable to the apparent oral<br>
clearance of 5.3 ± 2.2 mL/min/kg reported in the literature for a group of alcohol<br>
dependent patients who were administered a dose of 50 mg/kg (Ferrara, 1992). While it<br>
appeared that the GHB dose (ranging from 26.4 to 52.4 mg/kg with a mean of<br>
36.5 mg/kg) in the present study was lower than the comparison GHB dose (50 mg/kg)<br>
administered to the alcohol dependent patients (Ferrara, 1992), it should be noted that<br>
each patient in the present study was administered two consecutive GHB doses at four-<br>
hour interval and residual GHB levels were detected in three out of six patients<br>
immediately prior to the second GHB dose. The GHB pharmacokinetic non-linearity in<br>
alcohol dependent patients easily can be observed from the apparent oral clearance which<br>
increased to 8.1 ±4.8 mL/min/kg when the GHB dose is reduced to 25 mg/kg dose<br>
(Ferrara, 1992). In the present study, the non-linearity was less obvious because each<br>
narcoleptic patient received two consecutive fixed 3 g doses regardless of body weight.<br>
The mean elimination half-life of GHB in the six narcoleptic patients was<br>
determined to be 53 ± 19 min, longer than that in alcohol dependent patients after a<br>
50 mg/kg GHB dose (Ferrara, 1992). The lengthening of GHB elimination half-life<br>
observed in this study partially was caused by the wider spacing in sampling time points.<br>
However, capacity limited elimination of this drug in some of the narcoleptic patients<br>
also could have contributed to this prolongation.<br>
GHB appears to have a shortcoming in that its elimination from the body is<br>
capacity limited in some patients when the drug is administered at a fixed regimen of 3 g<br>
twice nightly at four-hour interval. However, from a therapeutic perspective, GHB offers<br>
an advantage in the treatment of narcolepsy because by the time a patient wakes up in the<br>
morning (i.e. 8 to 10 h after the first GHB dose), all GHB, including that from the second<br>
dose, will have been eliminated from the systemic circulation. GHB was also well<br>
tolerated by narcoleptic patients in this study. No adverse experience was reported.<br>
12. Conclusions<br>
The capacity limited elimination kinetics was observed in three out of six patients<br>
who had been administered two consecutive 3 g oral doses of GHB, 4 h apart. From a<br>
pharmacokinetic perspective, dividing the nightly GHB dose into two portions and<br>
administering the two portions to narcoleptic patients at a 2.5- to 4-h interval was rational<br>
because the elimination half-life of GHB was short (
profiles of GHB in narcoleptic patients who had been receiving this agent nightly for<br>
years appeared to be comparable to those in alcohol dependent patients (Ferrara, 1992).<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
SODIUM OXYBATE FORMULATION STUDY<br>
I. Study Objectives<br>
This example described ways that sodium oxybate may be prepared and tested for<br>
stability to determine preferred formulations. Various formulations of sodium oxybate in<br>
water were prepared under different conditions of mixing and with addition of selected<br>
acidulents at multiple pH levels (Neo-Pharm Laboratories, Blainville, Quebec). Selected<br>
formulations were placed on real time and accelerated stability. Earlier studies have<br>
demonstrated that degradation products are formed in acidic conditions and that<br>
antimicrobial effectiveness is limited at high pH. Therefore several acidulents across a<br>
range of 6.0 - 9.0 were evaluated.<br>
II. Study Design-Part I<br>
The following experimental work is designed to be performed in two stages.<br>
Initial studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of conditions of formulation, pH<br>
and acidulent on the resultant levels of impurities, specified and unspecified, and potency<br>
of sodium oxybate. Sodium oxybate was prepared (MIDS Neo-Pharm Laboratories,<br>
Quebec Canada), under different conditions of mixing and with addition of selected<br>
acidulents at multiple pH levels. These formulations of sodium oxybate acidulent were<br>
then tested.<br>
A. Preliminary studies<br>
1. Formulations description<br>
All formulations were prepared at a concentration of 500mg/cc of sodium<br>
oxybate in water. Three acidulents (HCl, malic acid, and phosphoric acid), were<br>
selected and tested at pH 6.0, 7.5 and 9.0.<br>
2. Method of formulation<br>
Solutions, were prepared using the described methods:<br>
a. Rapid mix method<br>
Sodium oxybate was dissolved in water and concentrated acidulent was added<br>
immediately without temperature control. Temperature of solution was monitored and<br>
recorded prior to and during addition of acidulent. The time of equiliberation to room<br>
temperature was also recorded. After the solution reached ambient room temperature, it<br>
was filtered through a 10 µm filter.<br>
b. Cool mix method:<br>
Sodium oxybate was dissolved in water. Acidulent was diluted to 10% and<br>
slowly added . The solution was cooled by water with jacket or ice bath. Monitor and<br>
record the temperature of the solution was monitored and recorded during addition of<br>
acidulent. The time of equilibrium from room temperature was also recorded. The<br>
preferred maximum temperature should be maintained at less than 40°C. The solution<br>
was filtered through a 10 µm filter.<br>
c. Reverse order of addition:<br>
Acidulent was added to water and cooled to room temperature. The sodium<br>
oxybate was dissolved in the diluted acidulent solution. The temperature of solution was<br>
monitored and recorded during addition of sodium oxybate. The solution was filtered<br>
through a 10 µm filter.<br>
d. Sodium oxybate control<br>
Sodium oxybate was dissolved in water to a concentration of 500mg/cc with no<br>
added acidulent. The final pH was recorded and the solution was filtered through a 10<br>
µm (micron or micrometer) filter.<br>
3. Solution data:<br>
Data was recorded for each solution which included: 1) date of preparation 2)<br>
date of analysis, 3) amount of acidulent required to achieve target pH, 4) length of time<br>
for dissolution of sodium oxybate, 5) temperature profile of solution over time of<br>
solution preparation to be recorded at 15 minute intervals, 6) final pH of solution.<br>
4. Testing requirements:<br>
The following methods were used to test the prepared solutions: pH, HPLC (High<br>
Pressure Liquid Chromotography) for potency (sodium oxybate), and for impurities.<br>
Time 0 analysis was performed immediately (within 24 h). RRT = (relative retention<br>
time).<br>
B. Summary of Part I:<br>
1. Preliminary Evaluation of Sodium Oxybate Formulations<br>
Tables 13, 14 and 15 provide test results for the three methods of preparation of<br>
sodium oxybate formulations.<br>
Review of the data indicated that the optimum method for preparation of sodium<br>
oxybate with minimal impurity levels is Method B: Controlled mixing with diluted<br>
acidulent. Method 2b resulted in formulations with lowest levels of GBL.<br>
2. Conclusions.<br>
Additional evaluations were carried out on selected formulations: 1) sodium<br>
oxybate with HCl as acidulent, at pH 7.5, and 2) sodium oxybate with malic acid as<br>
acidulent, pH 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0.<br>
III. Study Design-Part II<br>
Microbial Challenge and Stability Tested to determine the most preferred<br>
embodiments, the number of formulations was limited to three based on the data<br>
prepared from the above experiments.<br>
A. Kinetic Stability Study with Selected Formulations<br>
Samples of formulations are stored in tightly closed containers. Storage<br>
Conditions were 25°C, 40°C, and 60°C. Time points in bracket; were tested at the<br>
inventor's discretion. The samples were tested according to the following schedule: at<br>
25°C storage temperature, the assay points will be 0, 14, 28, 45, 60 days and 120 days; at<br>
40°C storage temperature, the assay points will be 0, 7, 14, 28, 4:5, 60 days; at 60°C<br>
storage temperature, the assay points will be at 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, 45 days, and, 60 days.<br>
The testing requirements included pH, HPLC for sodium oxybate (duplicate<br>
injections of single sample preparation), and impurities, specified and unspecified.<br>
B. Preservative Effectiveness Testing of selected formulations<br>
Microbial challenge testing of formulations was preformed according to USP<br>
XXIII, , Eighth Supplement. Solutions are determined to "Pass or Fail" based upon<br>
the USP criteria for perservative effectivness which states: For Bacteria, "Not less than 1<br>
log reduction from the initial microbial count at 14 days and no increase from the 14<br>
days count at 28 days;" and for yeast and molds, "No increase from the initial calculated<br>
count at 14 and 28 days." Solutions which met these criteria were designated as "Pass"<br>
and those that did not meet these criteria were designated as "Fail".<br>
C. Summary Stability Results:<br>
1. Formulations prepared with Malic Acid as acidulents:<br>
a. Malic Acid, pH 6.0 formulation (25°), GBL and impurity<br>
A levels were very low on Day 0, however, by Day 45 GBL levels had reached 2.8%.<br>
Impurity A increased from 0.01 to 1.0%, and pH increased from 6.0 to 6.3 by day 45.<br>
This formulation stored at 40°C and 60°C showed GBL levels up to 5.4%, impurity A<br>
levels increased to 2.3%, and pH increased to 6.3 by Day 14.<br>
b. Malic Acid, pH 7.5 formulation (25°C), GBL levels were<br>
0.009% on Day 0, and increased to 0.17% by day 45. Impurity A increased from 0.01%<br>
to 0.1% and pH increased from 7.5 to 7.9. Malic acid, pH 7.5 GBL levels are reached<br>
(40°C) and 60°C a maximum of 0.22%. Impurity A levels reached 0.1% and pH<br>
increased to 8.0. Under accelerated conditions, all parameters reached an apparent<br>
maximum by Day 7 and did not increase significantly thereafter.<br>
c. Malic Acid, pH 9.0 formulation (25°C,) GBL levels<br>
measure 0.008% on Day 0, and increased slightly to 0.013% on Day 45. Impurity A did<br>
not increase nor did pH increase. Under accelerated conditions, GBL increased from,<br>
0.008% to a maximum of 0.018% by Day 14. Impurity A increased slightly from 0.10 to<br>
0.014% by Day 14.<br>
2. Formulations prepared with HCl as acidulents.<br>
HCl, pH 6.0 formulation (25°) GBL levels measured 2.8% by Day 30, and<br>
impurity A 0.004%, and pH 6.0. Accelerated storage conditions (40°C) GBL levels were<br>
measured at 6.6%, and impurity A measured 3.1% by Day 30.<br>
HCl, pH 7.5 formulation (25%) GBL levels measured 0 041% on Day 0, Impurity<br>
A measured 0.02%, and by Day 18 GBL measured to 0.12% and impurity A to 0.07%.<br>
Under accelerated conditions (40°C and 60°C), GBL increased to a maximum of 0.21%,<br>
impurity A increased from 0.02% to 0.1%, and pH increased from 7.5 to 8.0. As with<br>
Malic Acid at pH 7.5, the measured parameters reached maximum by Day 7 and did not<br>
increase significantly thereafter.<br>
HCl, pH 9.0 formulation (25°C) GBL levels reached 0.022% by Day 18.<br>
Impurity A stayed constant at 0.01% for 18 days. Under accelerated conditions (40°C)<br>
GBL levels were equivalent to 25°C storage (0.21 %). Impurity A showed no increase<br>
over 25°C conditions.<br>
3. Conclusions.<br>
"Formulations selected for microbial challenge testing were the following: HCl,<br>
pH 7.5, and malic acid, pH 7.5. The rationale for this decision was twofold. First, the<br>
formulations were selected based on minimal formation of GBL and impurity A.<br>
Second, the formulations were selected to maintain a pH in the neutral range.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
FURTHER EVALUATION OF SODIUM OXYBATE FORMULATIONS<br>
Purpose: To prepare, test and evaluate multiple formulations of Sodium<br>
Oxybate and two formulations using alternative salts of gamma-hydroxybutyrate.<br>
Scope: Various formulations of Sodium Oxybate in water were prepared with<br>
addition of selected acidulents at multiple pH levels. Solutions were prepared and tested<br>
at Neo-Pharm Laboratories, Blainville, Quebec. All formulations successfully prepared<br>
were placed on limited stability. Earlier studies have demonstrated that degradation<br>
products are formed in acidic conditions and that antimicrobial effectiveness is limited at<br>
high pH. Conditions of varying pH and concentrations of sodium oxybate previously not<br>
evaluated were prepared and tested.<br>
Procedures: Solutions were prepared as summarized and microbial challenge<br>
testing carried out as follows:<br>
I. Evaluation of Sodium Oxybate Formulations<br>
Purpose: To prepare, test and evaluate multiple formulations of Sodium<br>
Oxybate and two formulations using alternative salts of gamma-hydroxybutyrate.<br>
Scope: Various formulations of Sodium Oxybate in water were prepared with<br>
addition of selected acidulents at multiple pH levels. Selected formulations were studied<br>
for limited stability. Earlier studies demonstrated that degradation products are formed<br>
in acidic conditions and that antimicrobial effectiveness is limited at high pH.<br>
Conditions of varying pH and concentrations of sodium oxybate previously not evaluated<br>
were prepared and tested.<br>
Responsibility: It was the responsibility of Neo-Pharm Laboratories to prepare<br>
selected formulations and perform testing per this protocol. Orphan Medical, New<br>
Medicine Development and Quality Assurance were responsible for reviewing raw data<br>
at the defined decision point, defining which formulations will be included in stability<br>
testing. Orphan Medical was also responsible for reviewing final results (raw data) and<br>
the final report.<br>
Procedure: The following formulations were prepared by scientists at Neo-<br>
Pharm following the steps listed below and dispensed into containers (amber PET 240 ml<br>
bottle, OMI CS-460) and closures (Clic-Loc III, 24-400, OMI CS-470) to a volume of<br>
200 ml each bottle. The bottles were tested by 28-day microbial challenge and by<br>
limited stability testing at 25°C including, appearance, pH, potency, and impurity profile<br>
on day 1 (day of preparation) and day 28.<br>
A. Formulations Prepared and Evaluated Using Sodium Oxvbate:<br>
1. Preparation: Method for preparation of various formulations: As<br>
previously determined in PR98068, the method of choice for<br>
preparation of liquid formulations of sodium oxybate was the<br>
following:<br>
a. For a one liter quantity of product, add the sodium oxybate<br>
in 500ml of purified and stir until dissolved. Prepare a<br>
10% solution of the acid (Malic or Citric) and add slowly<br>
to the solution of sodium oxybate. The solution should be<br>
monitored for pH and temperature and both variables<br>
recorded at reasonable intervals (every 10 or 15 minutes).<br>
When the target pH is attained, the solution will be Q. S. to<br>
1 liter, and pH rechecked and recorded.<br>
b. The final solutions will be filtered through 10µm filters<br>
and 200 mL dispensed into 5 amber PET bottles with<br>
closures (provied by Orphan Medical, Inc.). Two bottles<br>
will be used for microbial challenge studies and the<br>
remaining three bottles will be placed on limited stability.<br>
2. Testing: Formulations were tested by two methods of evaluation:<br>
a. Limited stability evaluation:<br>
(1) Storage Conditions: 25°C<br>
(2) Pull Points: Day 0 (day of preparation), and day 28<br>
(3) Testing Requirements:<br>
Test Method<br>
Appearance Visual<br>
Potency HPLC Neopharm 764<br>
Impurities HPLC Neopharm 793DT<br>
pH USP<br>
b. Microbial challenge:<br>
(1) Storage Conditions: Microbial challenge studies of<br>
above formulations were set up with 5<br>
microorganisms and stored for 28 days at 20 - 25<br>
°C, per USP  Eighth Supplement.<br>
(2) Microorganisms: After a sufficient quantity of each<br>
formulation is prepared, aliquots were inoculated<br>
with 5 microorganisms at a concentration of at<br>
least 105 microorganisms/cc:<br>
(a) Escherichia coli. ATCC 8739<br>
(b) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ATCC 9027<br>
(c) Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 6538<br>
(d) Aspergillus niger, ATCC 18404<br>
(e) Candida albicans. ATCC 10231<br>
(3) Time Points: A determination of the viable cell<br>
concentration in each inoculated container was<br>
performed after 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.<br>
B. Formulations To Be Prepared From Alternative Salts of Gamma-<br>
Hydroxybutyrate: This work may be staged to take place at a later time<br>
than the work described above.<br>
1. Solubility determination: Little information is available about the<br>
solubility of this alternative salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate and a<br>
determination of solubility was done in advance of efforts to<br>
prepare formulations for evaluation by stability and microbial<br>
challenge. Maximum solubility is evaluated for pH unadjusted<br>
soluations and within the pH range desired for this formulation<br>
(pH 6.0 - 8.0). If solubility is limited, the formulation will be<br>
changed to accommodate the solubility limitations. The preferred<br>
acidulent for this work is Malic acid. If acid is not compatible<br>
with the salt, then an alternative acid can be selected.<br>
2. Preparation: Method for preparation of alternative salt<br>
formulations:<br>
a. The previously described method (Part A) is used for<br>
preparation of formulations of calcium gamma-<br>
hydroxybutyrate at the concentrations and specified pH<br>
determined by solubility experiments.<br>
b. The final solutions were filtered through 10µm filters and<br>
dispensed into 5 amber PET bottles with closures<br>
(provided by Orphan Medical, Inc.). Two bottles are used<br>
for microbial challenge studies and two bottles are placed<br>
on limited stability. The remaining bottles are retained for<br>
any additional studies at a future time.<br>
3. Testing: Formulations are tested as described above.<br>
C. Reporting of Results: The results will be reported for the Stability and<br>
Microbial Challenge results in standard format as defined by the described<br>
Orphan Medical Development. Copies of HPLC chromatograms and any<br>
raw data from these studies will be provided with results.<br>
D. Acceptance Criteria: Specific acceptance criteria for this study can be<br>
described analogous to those for sodium oxybate.<br>
Results: Summarized as follows in Tables 18. 19 and 20 for various studies.<br>
Short term stability testing was carried out as described in Appendix A and<br>
results are summarized in - Results of Limited Stability Testing - Xyrem oral solution -<br>
are show as follows:<br>
This report summarizes the results of the above described study and provides a<br>
summary of previous development work which evaluated conditions other than those<br>
evaluated in this study. The purposes of this information is to define the scope and<br>
limitations of the self-preserving properties of Xyrem® oral solution for completion of<br>
patent application.<br>
II. Summary of Results:<br>
A. Preparation of various formulations of Sodium Oxvbate and<br>
formulations using an alternative salt of GHB.<br>
1. Various formulations of sodium oxybate were prepared as directed<br>
in the above Protocol. Sodium oxybate, 500mg/cc with Malic Acid was not<br>
soluble at pH 5.0, and further evaluation of this solution was discontinued. All<br>
other solutions were successfully prepared as described.<br>
2. The preparation of an alternative salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate<br>
was described as the calcium salt, prepared at 500mg/cc (or maximum possible)<br>
with Malic Acid at pH 7.5.<br>
a. The calcium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate was prepared<br>
by Toronto Research and shipped to NeoPharm for determination of<br>
solubility and evaluation according to the Protocol. The absolute limit of<br>
solubility, without pH adjustment, was determined to be 700mg/cc. The<br>
pH of this solution was 8.4. Solutions of lower pH were more difficult to<br>
prepare at 500mg/cc using Malic acid as acidulant. When pH was<br>
adjusted to 6.0 with Malic acid, the solubility of the calcium oxybate was<br>
limited (longer stirring required to solubilize). The desired solution of<br>
500mg/cc, pH 7.5 was prepared with Malic acid as acidulant without<br>
difficulty. Appearance of the final solution was slightly yellow in color<br>
Copies of the laboratory record for preparation of these solutions is<br>
available.<br>
B. Microbial Challenge Testing of the various formulations parepared<br>
by MDS NeoPharm.<br>
The microbial challenge testing was carried as specified in the Protocol and the<br>
following table summarizes the results of microbial challenge testing of various<br>
formulations of sodium oxybate and the single calcium oxybate formulation prepared.<br>
C. Short term stability evaluation of various formulations of sodium<br>
oxvbate and a formulation of calcium oxvbate.<br>
Solutions were tested on day zero (preparation day) and day 28 according to the<br>
described Protocol. The results of the stability evaluation are summarized in Table 25<br>
below:<br>
