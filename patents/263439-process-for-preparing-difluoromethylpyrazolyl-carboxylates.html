				<td>Process for preparing difluoromethylpyrazolyl carboxylates<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing difluoromethyl-substituted<br>
pyrazol-4-ylcarboxylates.<br>
WO 92/12970 describes (3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)carboxamides and<br>
their use as fungicides. The preparation is carried out starting with a 2,2-<br>
difluoroacetoacetic ester which is reacted successively with triethyl orthoformate and<br>
with methylhydrazine, which gives the 3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylic<br>
ester which is then hydrolyzed to give the carboxylic acid. The latter is, after<br>
conversion into the acid chloride, reacted with a suitable amine to give the<br>
corresponding amide. However, providing the 4,4-difluorinated acetoacetic ester<br>
required as starting material is comparably expensive and difficult and constitutes an<br>
obstacle for this process.<br>
WO 2005/044804 describes alkyl esters of fluoromethyl-substituted heterocyclic<br>
carboxylic acids and their preparation by halogen exchange on corresponding<br>
chloromethyl-substituted heterocyclic carboxylic esters and their further conversion into<br>
anilides of the fluoromethyl-substituted heterocyclic carboxylic acids. However, the use<br>
of fluorinating agents is expensive, and specific requirements with a view to safety<br>
measures and the apparatus used have to be met.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide alternative processes for<br>
preparing (3-difluoromethylpyrazol-4-yl)carboxylates and derivatives thereof starting<br>
with products whose provision is less expensive than, for example, the provision of<br>
4,4-difluoroacetoacetic esters.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that this object is achieved by reacting 4,4,4-trihalogen-<br>
substituted acetoacetic ester derivatives of formula II, defined below, with chlorosilanes<br>
in the presence of magnesium or other metals of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 12th group of<br>
the Periodic Table of the Elements and subsequent reaction of the reaction product<br>
with a hydrazine or hydrazine derivative.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing difluoromethyl-<br>
substituted pyrazol-4-ylcarboxylates of the general formula I<br>
in which<br>
R1 is C1-C8-alkyl, C3-C8-cycloalkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy-C1-C4-alkyl, C3-C8-cycloalkoxy-C1-<br>
C4-alkyl, C2-C8-alkenyl or is benzyl which is optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3<br>
40	substituents Ry1 independently of one another selected from the group consisting<br>
of C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy and nitro; and<br>
R2 is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, benzyl or phenyl, where the two last-mentioned<br><br>
substituents may be unsubstituted or optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3<br>
substituents Ry2 independently of one another selected from the group consisting<br>
of halogen, CN, nitro, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy and<br>
C1-C4-haloalkoxy;<br>
wherein<br>
a) a compound of the general formula II<br><br>
in which X is fluorine, chlorine or bromine, R1 has one of the meanings given<br>
above and R4 is C1-C8-alkyl, C3-C8-cycloalkyl, C2-C8-alkenyl, benzyl or phenyl,<br>
is reacted with a silane compound of the general formula R3nSiCI(4-n)<br>
in which n is 1, 2 or 3 and the substituents R3 are independently of one another<br>
selected from the group consisting of C1-C8-alkyl and phenyl and<br>
with a metal selected from the metals of groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 12 of the Periodic<br>
Table of the Elements having a redox potential of less than -0.7 V, based on a<br>
normal hydrogen electrode (at 25°C and 101.325 kPa); and<br>
b) the reaction mixture from step a) is reacted with a compound of the general<br>
formula III<br><br>
in which R2 has one of the meanings given above.<br>
The process according to the invention is associated with a number of advantages. It<br>
provides the pyrazole compound of the formula II in high yield and, in the case of the<br>
reaction with substituted hydrazines III (R2 ≠ H), in high regioselectivity. Moreover,<br>
expensive starting materials, difluoromethylcarbonyl compounds, such as<br>
2,2-difluoroacetoacetic esters, can be dispensed with, and instead it is possible to use<br>
the much less expensive trifluoromethylcarbonyl compounds and halodifluoromethyl<br>
compounds, such as 2,2,2-trifluoroacetoacetic esters or 2-chloro-<br>
2,2-difluoroacetoacetic esters.<br>

[2.2.1]heptyl, bicyclo[3.1.1]heptyl, bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl and bicyclo[3.2.1]octyl. Examples<br>
of tricyclic radicals are adamantyl and homoadamantyl.<br>
The double bond in compound II and also in the formulae A and B defined below may<br>
have the E or the Z configuration (or the cis or trans configuration, based on the<br>
relative arrangement of the group OR4 and the trifluoroacetyl radical).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, R1 in the<br>
formulae I and II is C1-C4-alkyl or benzyl, in particular methyl, ethyl or isopropyl; R1 is<br>
especially ethyl.<br><br>
For the process according to the invention, it is furthermore advantageous if R4 in<br>
formula II is selected from the group consisting of C1-C4-alkyl and benzyl and in<br>
particular from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and benzyl; R4 is<br>
especially ethyl.<br>
In formula II, X is in particular fluorine or chlorine. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, X is fluorine.<br>
R2 is preferably hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl; R2 is especially methyl. Accordingly, the<br>
compound of the general formula III is preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
C1-C4-alkylhydrazine and hydrazine; the compound of the general formula ill is<br>
especially methylhydrazine or hydrazine hydrate.<br>
All reactions described herein are carried out in reaction vessels customary for such<br>
reactions, and the reaction can be carried out either continuously or discontinuously. In<br>
general, the reactions in question will be carried out at atmospheric pressure. In the<br>
case of low-boiling solvents, the reaction in question may also be carried out under<br>
superatmospheric pressure.<br>
Step a)<br>
To carry out step a) of the process according to the invention, the compound of the<br>
formula II is reacted with the silane compound and with a metal of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,<br>
4th or 12th group of the Periodic Table having a redox potential of less than -0.7 V,<br>
based on a normal hydrogen electrode (at 25"C and 101.325 kPa), preferably with a<br>
metal of the 1 st, 2nd or 3rd main group of the Periodic Table or zinc, or especially with<br>
magnesium.<br>
Without wishing to be tied down to any one theory, we believe that this primarily<br>
affords a silylated enol of the formula A which is possibly, depending on the chosen<br>
reaction conditions or during the work-up of the reaction or during the further reaction<br>
in step b), hydrolyzed to intermediate B.<br><br>
The compounds A can be detected in the reaction solution and, in some cases, they<br>
can be isolated. Accordingly, the present invention also provides the compounds A and<br>
their solutions. With respect to preferred meanings of R1, R3 and R4 in the<br>
compounds A, what is stated above and below applies analogously.<br>
In principle, the reaction can be carried out analogously to the reaction described in<br>
Organic Letters, 2001, 3(20), 3103-3105, which describes the preparation of 1-ethoxy-<br>
3-thmethylsilyloxy-4,4-difluorobutadiene. If X is chlorine or fluorine, the reaction can be<br>
carried out in particular analogously to the methods described in Tetrahedron Letters,<br>
1983, Vol. 24, No.5, 507-510.J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1988, 1149-1153, J. Org.<br><br>
Chem. 1995, 60, 5570-5578, J. Org. Chem. 2006, 71, No. 15, 5468-5473 and<br>
US 5,618,951.<br>
Examples of metals of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 12th group of the Periodic Table of<br>
the Elements having a redox potential of less than -0.7 V, for example 
based on a normal hydrogen electrode (at 25°C and 101.325 kPa), are alkali metals, in<br>
particular lithium, sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metals, in particular magnesium<br>
or calcium, furthermore aluminum, titanium, zirconium and zinc. Preferred metals are<br>
sodium, magnesium and zinc, and magnesium is particularly preferred, in particular<br>
when X is fluorine. Particular preference is likewise given to zinc, in particular when X<br>
is chlorine or bromine.<br>
It has been found to be advantageous to use, in step a), a silane compound R3nSiCI(4-n)<br>
in which n is 2 or 3. Particularly preferably, the substituents R3 in these silane<br>
compounds are independently of one another C1-C4-alkyl, in particular methyl, ethyl,<br>
isopropyl, tert-butyl. The compound is in particular a silane compound in which n is 3.<br>
Here, the 3 radicals R3 may be identical or different, and preference is given to those<br>
silane compounds in which 2 of the radicals R3 are methyl and the remaining radical R3<br>
is C1-C4-alkyl. In this case, the silane compound is preferably trimethylsilyl chloride,<br>
ethyldimethylsilyl chloride, dimethylpropylsilyl chloride, dimethylisopropylsilyl chloride,<br>
n-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, 2-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, (2-methylpropyl)dimethylsilyl<br>
chloride or tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and very particularly preferably trimethylsilyl<br>
chloride. Examples of preferred silane compounds in which n is 2 are<br>
dimethyldichlorosilane and diethyldichlorosilane. In a very particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the silane compound R3nSiCI(4-n) is trimethylsilyl chloride.<br>
The silane compound is preferably employed in at least equimolar amounts or in<br>
excess, based on the compound II, where the amount of silane compound generally<br>
does not exceed 5 mol, in particular 3.5 mol, per mole of the compound II. Preferably,<br>
from 1.1 to 3.5 mol, in particular about 1.2 to 2.5 mol, of the compounds of the silane<br>
compound are employed per mole of the compound II.<br>
In general, the silane compound is employed in an amount of at least 0.8 mol per mole<br>
of metal. Preferably, the silane compound is employed in at least equimolar amounts<br>
or in excess, based on the metal, a relatively large excess, for example of more than<br>
200 mol%, based on the amount of metal, generally not being required. Preferably,<br>
from 0.8 to 3 mol, in particular from 0.9 to 3 mol and especially from 1 to 2 mol of the<br>
silane compound are employed per mole of metal.<br>
Based on the compound II, the metal is generally employed in an at least equimolar<br>
amount, for example in an amount of from 1 to 5 mol, frequently from 1.1 to 4 mol and<br>
especially from 1.5 to 3 mol, per mole of the compound II.<br>
Step a) is preferably carried out in substantial absence of water, i.e. in a dry organic<br>
solvent. Here and below, dry means that the solvent has a water content of less than<br>
500 ppm and in particular not more than 100 ppm. Examples of suitable organic<br>
solvents are aprotic polar solvents, for example cyclic or acyclic ethers, such as diethyl<br>
ether, tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE), diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or<br>
dioxane, cyclic or acyclic amides, for example N-C1-C4-alkyllactams, such as<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, or N-di(C1-C4-alkyl)amides of aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acids,<br><br>
such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, or aprotic urea derivatives, i.e.<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetraalky!ureas or N,N'-dialkylated cyclic ureas, such as N,N,N',N'-tetra<br>
(C1-C4-alkyOalkylureas, 1,3-di(C1-C4-alkyl)hexahydropyrimidin-2-one or 1,3-di(d-d-<br>
alkyl)imidazolin-2-one, for example tetramethylurea, 1,3-dimethylhexahydropyrimidin-<br>
2-one (dimethylpropyleneurea) or 1,3-dimethylimidazolin-2-one (DMI), and also<br>
mixtures of the solvents mentioned above. Also suitable are mixtures of the<br>
abovementioned aprotic polar organic solvents with nonpolar aprotic solvents, for<br>
example with aromatic or (cyclo)aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylenes,<br>
hexane, cyclohexane and the like, where in these mixtures the aprotic polar solvent<br>
preferably accounts for at least 50% by volume, in particular at least 70% by volume,<br>
of the total amount of solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out in an aprotic polar<br>
solvent selected from the group consisting of cyclic or acyclic amides, in particular<br>
N-d-d-alkyllactams, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, N-di(C1-C4-alkyl)amides of<br>
aliphatic C1-C4-carboxylic acid, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, and<br>
aprotic urea derivatives, such as N,N,N',N'-tetra(C1-C4-alkyl)alkylureas, 1,3-di(d-d-<br>
alkyl)hexahydropyrimidin-2-one or 1,3-di(C1-C4-alkyl)imidazolin-2-one, for example<br>
tetramethylurea, 1,3-dimethylhexahydropyrimidin-2-one (dimethylpropyleneurea) or<br>
1,3-dimethylimidazolin-2-one (DMI), and mixtures of these solvents. Particularly<br>
preferred solvents are the aprotic urea compounds and especially DMI.<br>
The reaction in step a) is preferably carried out at temperatures of from -10 to +60°C.<br>
Preferably, it is assured that a reaction temperature of 50°C, in particular 30°C, is not<br>
exceeded.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se by bringing the reagents, i.e. the<br>
compound II, the silane compound and the metal, into contact with one another,<br>
preferably in a suitable solvent in a reaction vessel, where generally the metal and, if<br>
appropriate, the silane compound are initially charged in the reaction vessel. It is<br>
advantageous for at least part of the silane compound, for example at least 20%, in<br>
particular at least 50%, and the metal to be present in an organic solvent, preferably a<br>
dry organic solvent, suitable for the reaction, in the reaction vessel prior to the addition<br>
of the compound II.<br>
In a preferred procedure, the metal and the silane compound are initially charged in a<br>
preferably dry organic solvent suitable for the reaction. Here, the metal is typically<br>
employed in particulate form, for example in the form of turnings, powders or granules.<br>
The order in which the components are initially charged is of minor importance. If<br>
appropriate, the metal is activated. Subsequently, if appropriate with cooling to<br>
dissipate the heat of reaction, the compound of the formula II is added in pure form or<br>
as a solution, the addition rate preferably being chosen such that the temperatures<br>
stated above are, if possible, adhered to and in particular not exceeded. If a solution of<br>
the compound of the formula II is used, the concentration of compound II is typically in<br>
the range from 10 to 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the solution. The<br>
solvent used for the solution is typically the solvent used for the reaction.<br>
In another likewise preferred procedure, the metal is initially charged in an organic<br>
solvent, preferably a dry organic solvent, suitable for the reaction and, if appropriate, is<br>
activated, and initially the silane compound and then the compound II are then added<br>
successively to the reaction vessel, it being possible to add the silane compound and<br>
the compound I in pure form or as a solution in the solvent desired for the reaction.<br><br>
In a further, likewise preferred procedure, the metal is initially charged in an organic<br>
solvent, preferably a dry organic solvent, suitable for the reaction and, if appropriate, is<br>
activated, and, if appropriate, part of the silane compound, for example from 1 to 30%,<br>
is then added, and the silane compound or the residual amount of the silane<br>
compound and the compound II are then added together or via separate feeds to the<br>
reaction vessel, it being possible to add the silane compound and the compound II in<br>
pure form or as a solution in the solvent desired for the reaction.<br>
AIternatively, it is also possible to initially charge compound II and the metal in a<br>
solvent suitable for the reaction and to add the silane compound in pure form or as a<br>
solution in the solvent suitable for the reaction.<br>
Depending on the reactivity of the compounds II, the silane compound, the metal and<br>
the reaction temperature, the period of time over which the compound II or the silane<br>
compound is added is generally in the range from 5 to 240 minutes, frequently in the<br>
range from 10 to 120 minutes, preferably in the range from 20 to 60 minutes. If<br>
appropriate, this may be followed by a post-reaction phase of generally in the range of<br>
from 10 minutes to 360 minutes, frequently in the range of from 15 minutes to<br>
240 minutes and in particular in the range of from 20 minutes to 180 minutes. The total<br>
reaction time (addition time + any post-reaction phase) required for complete<br>
conversion is generally in the range from 20 minutes to 10 hours, often in the range<br>
from 30 minutes to 6 hours and preferably in the range from 1 to 5 hours. The<br>
conversion of the compound II is generally quantitative or almost quantitative (&gt; 95%<br>
25conversion).<br>
It has been found to be expedient to activate the metal initially charged in the reaction<br>
vessel prior to addition of the compound II or the silane compound, for example by<br>
treatment with ultrasound or by chemical means, for example by treatment with<br>
bromine, iodine, trichloromethane or dibromomethane.<br>
For the further reaction, the reaction mixture may be worked up and the reaction<br>
product from step a) may be isolated. The quantitative isolation of compounds of the<br>
formula A is generally carried out under weakly basic or anhydrous conditions to avoid<br>
premature hydrolysis. If the reaction mixture is worked up with addition of water, there<br>
is at least partial hydrolysis to compound B, and what is obtained is compound B, if<br>
appropriate as a mixture with compound A. A premature hydrolysis of compound A is<br>
preferably avoided.<br>
For the reaction in step b), it is not necessary to isolate the compounds formed. In<br>
contrast, it has been found to be favorable to dispense with isolating the reaction<br>
products. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, the further reaction in step b) is carried out without prior isolation of reaction<br>
product A. Prior to further conversion, excess silane compound is preferably removed<br>
partially or, in particular, substantially, i.e. at least to a residual amount of less than<br>
10 mol%, based on the compound II employed, or completely, for example by<br>
distillation. If appropriate, further volatile components of the reaction mixture, for<br>
example the solvent, are also removed partially or, in particular, completely.<br>
The compounds of the general formula II used in step a) are commercially available or<br><br>
can be prepared, for example, analogously to the reaction described for<br>
(2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro)acetoacetic ester in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,<br>
2000, Vol. 43, No. 21, from a tris(halo)acetoacetic ester VII and a suitable<br>
orthoformate VIII, in general a tri(C1-C4-alkyl) orthoformate. The reaction is shown in<br>
the scheme below:<br><br>
In this scheme, X, R1 and R4 are as defined above. A suitable orthoformate is in<br>
particular triethyl orthoformate (R4 = ethyl). In general, the reaction of VII with VIM is<br>
carried out such that the C1-C4-alkanol formed during the reaction is removed from the<br>
reaction equilibrium, for example in that it is distilled off or bound chemically, for<br>
example by carrying out the reaction in the presence of an anhydride of a carboxylic<br>
acid, for example a C2-C4-alkanecarboxylic acid, such as acetic anhydride.<br>
For the reaction, the compound VIII is generally employed in excess, based on the<br>
stoichiometry of the reaction. In particular, from 1.1 to 5 mol and especially from 1.2 to<br>
2 mol of orthoformate VIII are used per mole of compound VII.<br>
The reaction of VII with VIII is usually carried out at elevated temperature, frequently in<br>
the range from 80 to 180°C, in particular in the range from 100 to 150°C. If<br>
appropriate, an acid, for example an organic sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid, may be added as catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the reaction of VII with the<br>
orthoformate VIII is carried out in acetic anhydride.<br>
In general, compound II is purified prior to being used in the process according to the<br>
invention; in particular, unreacted starting materials VII and/or VIM will be removed.<br>
This can be carried out in a simple manner, for example by fractional distillation.<br>
Step b)<br>
The preparation of difluoromethyl-substituted pyrazol-4-ylcarboxylates of the general<br>
formula I in step b) of the process according to the invention is carried out by reacting<br>
the reaction product from step a), if appropriate after isolation or purification of the<br>
compounds obtained therein, or in particular by reacting the reaction solution obtained<br>
in step a), preferably after removal of excess silane compound, with a hydrazine<br>
compound of the formula IV.<br>
In principle, the reaction in step b) can be carried out analogously to the reaction,<br>
described in WO 92/12970, of 3-(difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)ethylcarboxylate<br>
with methylhydrazine.<br>
Preferably, hydrazine or a hydrazine derivative of the general formula III is employed in<br>
at least equimolar amounts or in excess, a relatively large excess of compound III, for<br>
example more than 20 mol%, based on 1 mol of the compound II employed in step a),<br>
generally not being required. Preferably, from 1.0 to 1.2 mol, in particular about 1.01 to<br>
1.1 mol, of the hydrazine compound III are employed per mole of compound II.<br><br>
The hydrazine compound of the formula III is preferably a C1-C4-alkylhydrazine or<br>
hydrazine or hydrazine hydrate; the compound of the general formula III is especially<br>
methylhydrazine or hydrazine hydrate.<br>
The reaction of the reaction product from step a) with the hydrazine compound III is<br>
generally carried out such that the reaction product from step a) is mixed, preferably by<br>
adding the reaction product, if appropriate in the form of a solution in an organic<br>
solvent, for example in the form of the reaction solution, if appropriate after removal of<br>
excess silane compound, to the hydrazine compound of the formula III. The hydrazine<br>
compound of the formula III is preferably initially charged as a solution in an organic<br>
solvent or solvent/water mixture. Alternatively, the hydrazine compound of the formula<br>
III, preferably as a solution in an organic solvent or solvent/water mixture, may also be<br>
added to the reaction product from step a) or a solution thereof in an organic solvent or<br>
solvent/water mixture.<br>
Organic solvents suitable for the reaction in step b) are, for example:<br>
- protic polar solvents, for example aliphatic alcohols having preferably 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-<br>
	butanol, isobutanol or tert-butanol,<br>
- aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, cumene,<br>
chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene or tert-butylbenzene,<br>
- aprotic polar solvents, for example cyclic or acyclic ethers, such as diethyl<br>
ether, tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE), tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane,<br>
	cyclic or acyclic amides, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone or tetramethylurea, or aliphatic nitriles, such as<br>
acetonitrile or propionitrile,<br>
- and also mixtures of the solvents mentioned above.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a protic polar solvent, in particular in a C1-C4-<br>
alkanol and particularly preferably in methanol, ethanol, or in acetonitrile, or in a<br>
mixture of a protic polar solvent with an aprotic polar solvent or in a mixture of these<br>
solvents with water.<br>
The reaction in step b) is preferably carried out in the presence of water. Here, even<br>
small amounts of water of 0.1% by volume, based on the total amount of solvent<br>
(organic solvent + water), are sufficient. In general, the amount of water will not exceed<br>
50% by volume, frequently 30% by volume, in particular 15% by volume, based on the<br>
total amount of organic solvent + water, and it is frequently in the range of from 0.1 to<br>
50% by volume, preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 30% by volume, in particular in<br>
the range of from 1 to 15% by volume, based on the total amount of organic solvent +<br>
water. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the reaction in step b) is<br>
carried out in a mixture of d-CM-alkanol and water and especially in a methanol/water<br>
mixture. With respect to the volume ratios of alkanol to water, what was said above<br>
applies.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures of from -80 to +100°C. In<br>
general, the upper temperature limit is the boiling point of the solvent in question,<br>
provided the reaction is carried out under atmospheric pressure. Preferably, a reaction<br><br>
temperature of 60°C and in particular 40°C will not be exceeded. For practical reasons,<br>
the reaction is frequently carried out at room temperature. In a special embodiment,<br>
initially, prior to the reaction, the temperature is set to from -60 to 0°C, in particular<br>
from -60 to -20°C, and during the reaction the reaction mixture is warmed to a<br>
temperature of from 0 to 60°C, in particular from 10 to 40°C.<br>
Depending on the reaction temperature, the reaction time required for complete<br>
conversion is typically in the range of from 1 to 48 hours and preferably in the range of<br>
from 4 to 24 hours.<br>
Work-up of the reaction mixture and isolation of the pyrazole compound of the general<br>
formula I are carried out in a customary manner, for example by removing the solvent,<br>
for example by distillation or by aqueous extractive work-up or by a combination of<br>
these measures. Further purification may be carried out, for example, by crystallization<br>
or by chromatography. However, frequently the product is already obtained in a purity<br>
which makes further purification steps redundant.<br>
Step b) of the process according to the invention affords the compounds of the general<br>
formula I in good to very good yields of generally at least 70%.<br>
The present invention furthermore provides a process for preparing a compound of the<br>
general formula IV<br><br>
in which R2 has one of the meanings given above. The process for preparing the<br>
compound IV comprises<br>
i)	providing a compound of the formula I by the process according to the<br>
invention as described and<br>
ii)	hydrolysis of the compound I.<br>
The hydrolysis can be carried out under acid catalysis or basic or otherwise. The<br>
compound I can be employed as such, i.e. after isolation. However, it is also possible<br>
to use the reaction mixture obtained in step b), if appropriate after removal of volatile<br>
components such as solvents, without further purification for the hydrolysis.<br>
For the basic hydrolysis of the compound I, the compound of the formula I is typically<br>
treated with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide<br>
or lithium hydroxide, preferably with an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution,<br>
especially an aqueous NaOH solution or an aqueous KOH solution, until the ester is<br>
completely hydrolyzed, preferably with heating.<br>
For the basic hydrolysis, the molar ratio of the compound of the formula I to the base is<br>
typically in the range from 0.8:1 to 1:10 and is in particular about equimolar (i.e. in the<br>
range from 0.9:1 to 1.2:1); however, a relatively large excess of base, for example up<br><br>
to 5 mol per mole of compound I, may also be advantageous.<br>
The basic hydrolysis is usually carried out in a diluent or solvent. Suitable diluents or<br>
solvents are, in addition to water, also organic solvents stable toward alkali, and also<br>
mixtures thereof with water. Examples of organic solvents stable to alkali are in<br>
particular the C1-C4-alkanols mentioned above., and also the acyclic and cyclic ethers<br>
mentioned above. Preferably, the hydrolysis is carried out in aqueous phase, i.e. in<br>
water or in a mixture of water with one of the organic solvents mentioned above, the<br>
content of organic solvent in the aqueous phase generally typically not exceeding 30%<br>
by volume, based on the total amount of water and organic solvent.<br>
The basic hydrolysis is preferably carried out at temperatures of from 20 to 100°C. In<br>
general, the upper temperature limit is the boiling point of the solvent used, provided<br>
the reaction is carried out under atmospheric pressure. Preferably, a reaction<br>
temperature of 100°C and in particular 90°C will not be exceeded. It has been found to<br>
be particularly advantageous to carry out the reaction at a temperature above the<br>
boiling point of the alcohol component of the ester. Starting with, for example, a<br>
compound of the general formula I in which R1 is ethyl, the hydrolysis is preferably<br>
carried out at a temperature of at least 80°C, for example in the range from 80 to 100°<br>
C. Here, the reaction time depends on the reaction temperature, on the concentration<br>
and on the stability of the respective ester bond. In general, the reaction conditions are<br>
chosen such that the reaction time is in the range from 1 to 12 h, in particular in the<br>
range from 2 to 8 h.<br>
The acid hydrolysis of the compound I can be carried out analogously to known acid<br>
ester hydrolyses, i.e. in the presence of catalytic or stoichiometric amounts of an acid<br>
and water (see, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd Ed., 334-<br>
338, McGraw-Hill, 1977 and the literature cited therein). Frequently, the reaction is<br>
carried out in a mixture of water and an aprotic organic solvent, for example an ether<br>
as mentioned above. Examples of acids are hydrohalic acids, sulfuric acid, organic<br>
sulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
and also acidic ion exchanger resins and the like.<br>
Suitable hydrolysis catalysts are furthermore alkali metal iodides, such as lithium<br>
iodide, trimethyliodosilane or mixtures of trimethylchlorosilane with alkali metal iodides,<br>
such as lithium iodide, sodium iodide or potassium iodide.<br>
The isolation of the acid IV is then carried out by customary separation processes,<br>
such as, for example, precipitation by adjusting the pH, or extraction.<br>
In an advantageous manner, the compounds of the general formula I according to the<br>
invention are suitable for synthesizing a large number of compounds which are of<br>
interest as active compounds, such as, for example, for preparing 3-<br>
difluoromethylpyrazole-4-carboxamides of the formula V defined below:<br><br><br>

In formula V, R6 is preferably selected from the group consisting of C1-C8alkyl, C1-C8-<br>
haloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy, phenyl and cyclopropyl, where phenyl and<br>
cyclopropyl may be substituted in the manner mentioned above. According to a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, R6 is phenyl which may optionally be substituted by<br>
1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 radicals Rax. Rax is in particular selected from the group consisting of<br>
halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-alkylthio, C1-C6-alkylsulfonyl, C1-C6-alkylsulfoxyl, C1-C6-<br>
haloalkylthio, C1-C6-haloalkylsulfonyl and d-d-haloalkylsulfoxyl. R5 is in particular<br>
halogen.<br>
The process comprises providing the pyrazolecarboxylate of the formula I by the<br>
process described herein and reacting it with an amino compound of the formula VI<br><br><br>
in which m, R5 and R6 have the meanings given above; or<br>
providing the pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid of the formula IV by the processes described<br>
herein, if appropriate converting the pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid IV into its carbonyl<br>
halide IVa<br><br>
in which R2 has the meaning mentioned above and Hal is halogen, in particular<br>
chlorine, and the subsequent reaction of the pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid of the formula<br>
IV or its carbonyl halide IVa with an amino compound of the formula VI.<br>
Suitable methods for preparing anilides by reacting carboxylic acids or carboxylic<br>
esters with aromatic amines are known to the person skilled in the art, for example<br>
from the prior art cited at the outset, and also from J. March, Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 2nd Ed., 382 f., McGraw-Hill, 1977 and Organikum, 21st Ed., Wiley-VCH,<br>
Weinheim 2001, pp. 481-484, and the literature cited therein, and these methods can<br>
be applied analogously to the preparation according to the invention of the compounds<br>
V.<br>
For example, pyrazolecarboxylates of the formula I, in particular those where<br>
R1 = methyl or ethyl, can be reacted directly with the aniline compound VI in the sense<br>
of an aminolysis of a carboxylic ester. Alternatively, the pyrazolecarboxylic acid of the<br>
formula IV can be reacted directly with the aniline compound VI in the sense of an<br>
aminolysis of a carboxylic acid.<br>
However, frequently the pyrazolecarboxylic acid of the formula IV is initially converted<br>
into its acid halide, for example its acid chloride, and the acid halide IVa is then reacted<br>
with the aniline compound VI.<br>
Depending on the chosen synthesis route, the coupling reaction of carboxylic acid IV<br>
or carboxylic acid derivative I or IVa and aniline derivative VI can, if appropriate, be<br>
carried out in the presence of catalysts, condensing agents, acid binders and/or with<br>
removal of water, for example by azeotropic distillation.<br>
ln general, the reaction of the carbonyl halide IVa with the aniline compound VI is<br>
carried out in an inert solvent. Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ether, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-<br>
40butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran, nitriles, such as acetonitrile<br>
and propionitrile, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and<br><br>
tert-butyl methyl ketone, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol,<br>
n-butanol and tert-butanol, and also methylene chloride, dimethyl sulfoxide and<br>
dimethylformamide, particularly preferably toluene, methylene chloride and<br>
tetrahydrofuran. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
The reaction of IVa with VI is usually carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable<br>
bases are, in general, inorganic compounds, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth<br>
metal hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide<br>
and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides, such as lithium<br>
oxide, sodium oxide, calcium oxide and magnesium oxide, alkali metal and alkaline<br>
earth metal hydrides, such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and<br>
calcium hydride, alkali metal amides, such as lithium amide, sodium amide and<br>
potassium amide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as lithium<br>
carbonate and calcium carbonate, and also alkali metal bicarbonates, such as sodium<br>
bicarbonate, moreover organic bases, for example tertiary amines, such as<br>
trimethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and N-methylpiperidine, pyridine,<br>
substituted pyridines, such as collidine, lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and also<br>
bicyclic amines. Particular preference is given to using triethylamine and pyridine.<br>
The bases are generally employed in equimolar amounts, based on the compound<br>
IVa. However, they can also be employed in an excess of from 5 mol% to 30 mol%,<br>
preferably from 5 mol% to 10 mol%, or- if tertiary amines are used - as solvents, if<br>
appropriate.<br>
The starting materials IVa and VI are generally reacted with one another in equimolar<br>
amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to use an excess of IVa of from<br>
1 mol% to 20 mol%, preferably from 1 mol% to 10 mol%, based on VI.<br>
This reaction of the pyrazolecarbonyl halides IVa with the aniline compounds VI is<br>
usually carried out at temperatures of from -20°C to 100°C, preferably from 0°C to 50°<br>
C.<br>
The reaction of the pyrazolecarboxylic acids IV with the aniline compounds VI is<br>
usually carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent. Suitable dehydrating agents<br>
are, for example, 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole, bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphoryl<br>
chloride, carbodiimides, such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N-(3-<br>

If the reaction of the pyrazolecarboxylic acids IV with the aniline compounds VI is<br>
carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, preference is given to using an<br>
organic base. Suitable organic bases are, for example, tertiary amines, such as<br>
trimethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and N-methylpiperidine, pyridine,<br>
substituted pyridines, such as collidine, lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and also<br>
bicyclic amines. Particular preference is given to using triethylamine and pyridine. The<br>
bases are generally employed in an excess of from 10 mol% to 200 mol%, preferably<br>
from 50 mol% to 150 mol%, based on the compound IV.<br>
The starting materials IV and VI are generally reacted with one another in<br>
approximately equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to use an<br>
excess of from 1 mol% to 20 mol%, preferably from 1 mol% to 10 mol%, of one of the<br>
compounds. The dehydrating agents are generally employed in an excess of from<br>
5 mol% to 100 mol%, preferably from 5 mol% to 60 mol%, based on the compound IV.<br>
The reaction of IV with VI is usually carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents are<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ether,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform and chlorobenzene, ethers,<br>

tetrahydrofuran, nitriles, such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, ketones, such as<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and tert-butyl methyl ketone, and also<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, particularly preferably methylene chloride,<br>
toluene and tetrahydrofuran. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents<br>
mentioned.<br>
Hereinbelow, the preparation of difluoromethyl-substituted pyrazol-4-ylcarboxylic<br>
esters and their further processing is described by way of examples.<br>
Preparation example 1: Preparation of ethyl 2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-<br>
oxobutyrate<br>
In a 500 ml four-necked flask with stirrer, 78.3 g (0.425 mol) of trifluoroacetoacetate<br>
ethyl-(4,4,4-trifluoro)-3-oxobutyrate, 103.3 g (0.638 mol) of triethyl orthoformate and<br>
130.0 g (1.275 mol) of acetic anhydride were mixed and heated at 120°C for 6 hours.<br>
Then, at atmospheric pressure, initially the low-boiling components were removed and<br>
the product was then distilled under reduced pressure over a column. This gave 91.8 g<br>
(yield 90%) of the title compound as a colorless liquid of a purity &gt; 98%.<br>
Preparation example 2: Preparation of isopropyl 2-isopropoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro-<br>
3-oxobutyrate<br>
The preparation was carried out analogously to preparation example 1 using isopropyl<br><br>
4,4,4-trifluoro-3-oxobutyrate and triisopropyl orthoformate.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of ethyl 3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate<br>
Magnesium turnings (4.9 g, 0.20 mol), trimethylsilyl chloride (TMS-CI: 21.8 g,<br>
0.20 mmol) and anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, 240 ml) were initially charged in<br>
a 500 ml three-necked flask fitted with magnetic stirrer and thermometer. The<br>
magnesium was activated by ultrasound, and ethyl 2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro-<br>
3-oxobutyrate (25.3 g, 0.10 mol) was then added in an ice bath over a period of<br>
30 min, during which the reaction temperature was kept in a range of from 0 to 10°C.<br>
After a further 60 min, excess trimethylsilyl chloride was removed under reduced<br>
pressure. In a second 500 ml three-necked flask, an aqueous methylhydrazine solution<br>
(37%, 20.8 g, 0.12 mol) and ethanol (320 ml) were initially charged at -50°C. Over a<br>
period of 60 min, the cooled reaction solution of the first reaction was added, under<br>
continued cooling. After a further 2 hours at -50°C, the reaction mixture was allowed to<br>
warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 10 hours. According to GC<br>
analysis, the reaction mixture contained ethyl 3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-<br>
carboxylate (isomer a) in a mixture with ethyl 2-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-3-<br>
carboxylate (isomer b) with an isomer ratio a : b of 82 : 18.<br>
The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
taken up in 100 ml of ethyl acetate and washed three times with saturated aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution, the pH of which had been adjusted to pH 2 by addition of<br>
cone, hydrochloric acid. Under reduced pressure, the organic phase was freed from<br>
the solvent. The solid residue was recrystallized from hexane. Ethyl 3-difluoromethyl-1-<br>
methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate was obtained as a colorless crystalline powder (15.3 g,<br>
70% yield, 95% purity, isomeric purity a : b = 94 : 6).<br>
1H-NMR (d6-DMSO, 400 MHz): δ = 1.27 (t, 3 H, J = 7.1 Hz), 3.92 (s, 3 H), 4.23 (q, 2 H,<br>
J = 7.1 Hz), 7.21 (t, 1 H, J=53 Hz), 8.41 ppm (s, 1 H).<br>
Examples 1a-1e: Attempts to prepare ethyl 3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-<br>
carboxylate in various solvents in the reaction of intermediate A with methylhydrazine<br>
Ethyl 2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-oxobutyrate, Mg and TMS-CI were reacted in<br>
DMF analogously to example 1, and excess TMS-CI was removed under reduced<br>
pressure. The mixture was then converted with aqueous methylhydrazine solution<br>
(37%) in various solvents into ethyl 3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate.<br>
Table 1 below shows the isomer mixtures obtained with different solvents and ratios ofthe reagents.<br><br><br>
Example 2: Preparation of 3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid<br>
The preparation was carried out analogously to example 1, but in contrast to<br>
example 1, instead of recrystallization from hexane, the solid residue obtained after<br>
aqueous extractive work-up and removal of the ethyl acetate was processed further as<br>
follows:<br>
16 g of a 50% by weight strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 100 ml of<br>
ethanol were added to the solid residue, and with stirring, the mixture was heated at<br>
reflux for 4 h. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous<br>
residue obtained was adjusted to pH 1 using 10% hydrochloric acid. This caused the<br>
dicarboxylic acid to precipitate as a solid which was isolated by filtration. This gave<br>
3-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid as a light-brown powder.<br>
151H-NMR (d6-DMSO, 400 MHz): δ = 3.92 (s, 3 H), 7.21 (t, 1 H, J=53 Hz), 8.34 ppm (s,<br>
1 H).<br>

etching with iodine and subsequent addition of anhydrous N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP,<br>
240 ml) and trimethylsilyl chloride (21.8 g, 0.20 mmol), ethyl 2-ethoxymethylene-4,4,4-<br>
trifluoro-3-oxobutyrate (25.3 g, 0.10 mol) was added at a temperature in the range<br>
from 30 to 40°C over a period of 30 min. After a further 120 min, excess trimethylsilyl<br>
chloride was removed under reduced pressure. In a second 500 ml three-necked flask,<br>
an aqueous methylhydrazine solution (37%, 20.8 g, 0.12 mol) and ethanol (320 ml)<br>
were initially charged at -50°C. Over a period of 60 min, the cooled reaction solution of<br>
the first reaction was added, under continued cooling. After a further 2 hours at -50°C,<br>
the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further<br>
10 hours. According to GC analysis, the reaction mixture contained ethyl 3-<br>
difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxylate (isomer a) in a mixture with ethyl 2-<br>
difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-3-carboxylate (isomer b) with an isomer ratio a : b of<br>
84 : 16. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The product obtained was a solution of ethyl 3-difluoromethyi-1-methylpyrazole-4-<br>
carboxylate in NMP which can be purified by extraction or crystallization analogously to<br>
example 1 or hydrolyzed to the acid by boiling with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution<br>

anhydrous 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI, 160 ml) were initially charged in a<br>
500 ml three-necked flask fitted with magnetic stirrer and thermometer. After activation<br>
of the magnesium with iodine, methyl 2-methoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-<br>
oxobutyrate (21.3 g, 0.10 mol) was added in an ice-bath over a period of 30 min, the<br>
reaction temperature being kept within a range of from 20 to 30°C. After a further<br>
60 min at room temperature, excess trimethylsilyl chloride was removed under reduced<br><br>
pressure. In a second 500 ml three-necked flask, an aqueous methylhydrazine solution<br>
(37%, 14.8 g, 0.12 mol) and methanol (320 ml) were initially charged at -50°C. Over a<br>
period of 60 min, the cooled reaction solution of the first reaction was added, with<br>
cooling being maintained. After a further 2 hours at -50°C, the reaction mixture was<br>
allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 10 hours. According to<br>

4-carboxylate (isomer a) as a mixture with methyl 2-difluoromethyl-1-methylpyrazole-<br>
3-carboxylate (isomer b) in an a : b isomer ratio of 90 : 10. The reaction mixture was<br>
then concentrated under reduced pressure. 120 g of 10% strength aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution were added to the residue, and the mixture was stirred at 100°C for<br>
4 h. After acidification of the aqueous solution with hydrochloric acid to pH 1 and<br>
repeated extraction with MTBE, an organic solution comprising 13.4 g of the title<br>
compound (yield isomer a: 71%) was obtained. The title compound was isolated by<br>
crystallization as a light-brown solid.<br>

Magnesium turnings (4.9 g, 0.20 mol), trimethylsilyl chloride (21.8 g, 0.20 mmol) and<br>
anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, 250 ml) were initially charged in a 500 ml three-<br>
necked flask fitted with magnetic stirrer and thermometer. After activation of the<br>
magnesium by ultrasound, isopropyl 2-isopropoxymethylene-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-<br>
oxobutyrate (26.8 g, 0.10 mol) was added in an ice-bath over a period of 30 min, the<br>
reaction temperature being kept in a range of from 0 to 10°C. After a further 60 min,<br>

chloride were added over a period of 3.5 h. The mixture was allowed to cool and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure, 100 ml of toluene were added to the residue<br>
and the mixture was again concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
distilled over a packed column at a pressure of 0.8 mbar and a head temperature of<br>
