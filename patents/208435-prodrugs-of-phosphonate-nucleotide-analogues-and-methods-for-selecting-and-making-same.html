Many methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogues are known. In general,<br>
such compounds have the structure A-OCH2P(0)(OR)2 where A is the residue of a<br>

Summary of the Invention Prodrugs of methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogues intended for antiviral or antitumor therapy, while known/ traditionally have been selected for their systemic effect. For example, such prodrugs have been selected for enhanced bioavailability, i.e., ability to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and<br>
10     converted rapidly to parent drug to ensure that the parent drug is available to all tissues. However, applicants now have found that it is possible to select prodrugs that become enriched at therapeutic sites, as illustrated by the studies described herein where the analogues are enriched at localized focal sites of HIV infection. The objective of this invention is, among other advantages, to produce less toxicity<br>
15     to bystander tissues and greater potency of the parental drug in tissues which are the targets of therapy with the parent methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogue.<br>
Accordingly, pursuant to these observations, a screening method is provided for identifying a methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogue prodrug conferring enhanced activity in a target tissue comprising:<br>
20     (a)      providing at least one of said prodrugs;<br>
(b)	selecting at least one therapeutic target tissue and at least one non-target<br>
tissue;<br>
(c)	administering the prodrug to the target tissue and to said at least one non-<br>
target tissue; and<br>
25     (d)      deterrnirtmg'the relative antiviral activity conferred by the prodrug in the tissues in step (c).<br>
In preferred embodiments, the target tissue are sites where HIV is actively replicated and/ or which serve as an HIV reservoir, and the non-target tissue is an intact animal. Unexpectedly, we found that selecting lymphoid tissue as the target 30     tissue for the practice of this method for HIV led to identification of prodrugs that enhance the delivery of active drug to such tissues.<br>
A preferred compound of this invention, which has been identified by this method has the structure (1),<br>

JPCT/US01/23104<br><br><br><br>

phosphorous atom and/or the amidate substituent are influential in the enrichment observed in the practice of this invention. Thus, in another embodiment of this<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention The methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogue parent drugs for use in this<br>
screening method are compounds having the structure A-OH2P(0)(OH)2 wherein<br>
 v<br><br>
A is the residue of a nucleoside analogue. These compounds are known per se and are not part of this invention. More particularly, the parent compounds comprise a heterocyclic base B and an aglycon E, in general having the structure<br>
O B—E—P—OH<br>
OH<br>
8<br><br>
! !<br>
5    wherein the group B is defined below and group E is defined above. Examples are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,659,825,4,808,716,4,724,233,5,142,051,5,130,427, 5,650,510,5,663,159,5,302,585,5,476,938,5,696,263,5,744,600,5,688,778,5,386,030, 5,733,896,5,352,786, and 5,798,340, and EP 821,690 and 654,037.<br>
The prodrugs for use in the screening method of this invention are<br>
  covalently modified analogues of the parent methoxyphosphonate nucleotide     analogues described in the preceding paragraph. In general, the phosphorus atom of the parent drug is the preferred site for prodrug modification, but other sites are found on the heterocyclic base B or the aglycon E. Many such prodrugs are already known. Primarily, they are esters or amidates of the phosphorus atom, but also<br>
15 include substitutions on the base and aglycon. None of these modifications per se is part of this invention and none are to be considered limiting on the scope of the invention herein.<br>
The phosphorus atom of the methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogues contains two valences for covalent modification such as amidation or esterification<br>
20     (unless one phosphoryl hydroxyl is esterified to an aglycon E hydroxyl substituent, whereupon only one phosphorus valence is free for substitution). The esters typically are aryloxy. The amidates ordinarily are naturally occurring monoamine acids having free carboxyl group(s) esterified with an alkyl or aryl group, usually phenyl, cycloalkyl, or t-, n- or s- alkyl groups. Suitable prodrugs for use in the<br>
25     screening method of this invention are disclosed for example in TU.S. Patent No. 5,798,340. However, any prodrug which is potentially believed to be capable of being converted in vivo within target tissue cells to the free methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogue parent drug, e.g., whether by hydrolysis, oxidation, or other covalent transformation resulting from exposure to biological tissues, is suitable for<br>
30     use in the method of this invention. Such prodrugs may not be known at this time but are identified in the future and thus become suitable candidates available for testing in the method of this invention. Since the prodrugs are simply candidates for screening in the methods their structures are not relevant to practicing or enabling the screening method, although of course their structures ultimately are<br>
35     dispositive of whether or not a prodrug will be shown to be selective in the assay.<br>
9<br><br>
5	' The pro-moieties bound to the parent drug may be the same or different<br>
However, each prodrug to be used in the screening assay will differ structurally from the other prodrugs to be tested. Distinct, i.e. structurally different, prodrugs generally are selected on the basis of either their stereochemistry or their covalent structure, or these features are varied in combination. Each prodrug tested,<br>
10     however, desirably is structurally and stereochemically substantially pure, else the . output of the screening assay will be less useful. It is of course within the scope of this invention to test only a single prodrug in an individual embodiment of the method of this invention, although typically then one would compare the results with prior studies with other prodrugs.<br>
15	We have found that the stereochemistry of the prodrugs is capable of<br>
influencing the enrichment in target tissues. Chiral sites are at the phosphorus atom and are also found in its substituents. For example, amino acid used in preparing amiddtes may be D or L forms, and the phosphonate esters or the amino acid esters can tohtain chiral centers* as well. Chiral sites also are found on the<br>
20     nucleoside analogue portion of the molecules, but these typically are already<br>
dictated by the stereochemistry of the parent drug and will not be varied as part of the screen. For example the R isomer of PMPA is preferred as it is more active than the corresponding S isomer. Typically these diasteromers or enantiomers will be chirally enriched if not pure at each site so that the results of the screen will be<br>
25     more meaningful. As noted, distinctiveness of stereoisomers is conferred by<br>
enriching or purifying the stereoisomer (typically this will be a diastereomer rather than an enantiomer in the case of most methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogues) free of other stereoisomers at the chiral center in question, so that each test compound is substantially homogeneous. By substantially homogeneous or<br>
30    chirally enriched, we mean that the desired stereoisomer constitutes greater than about 60% by weight of the compound, ordinarily greater than about 80% and preferably greater than about 95%.<br>

Novel Screening Method Once at least one candidate prodrug has been selected, the remaining steps of the screening method of this invention are used to identify a prodrug possessing the required selectivity for the target tissue. Most conveniently the prodrugs are<br>
10     labeled with a detectable group, e.g. radiolabeled, in order to facilitate detection latex in tissues or cells. However, a label is not required since other suitable assays for the prodrug or its metabolites (including the parent drug) can also be employed. These assays could include mass spectrometry, HPLC, bioassays or immunoassays for instance. The assay may detect the prodrug and any one or<br>
15     more of its metabolites, but preferably the assay is conducted to detect only the generation of the parent drug. This is based on the assumption (which may not be warranted in all cases) that the degree and rate of conversion of prodrug to antivirally active parent diphosphate is the same across all tissues tested. Otherwise, one can test for the diphosphate.<br>
20	The target tissue preferably will be lymphoid tissue when screening for<br>
prodrugs useful in the treatment of HIV infection. Lymphoid tissue will be loiown to the artisan and includes CD4 cells, lymphocytes, lymph nodes, macrophages and macrophage-like cells including monocytes such as peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and glial cells. Lymphoid tissue also includes non-lymphoid tissues<br>
25     that are enriched in lymphoid tissues or cells, e.g. lung, skin and spleen. Other targets for other antiviral drugs of course will be the primary sites of replication or latency for the particular virus concerned, e.g., liver for hepatitis and peripheral nerves for HSV. Similarly, target tissues for tumors will in fact be the tumors themselves. These tissues are all well-known to the artisan and would not require<br>
30     undue experimentation to select. When screening for antiviral compounds, target tissue can be infected by the virus.<br>
Non-target tissues or cells also are screened as part of the method herein. Any number or identity of such tissues or cells can be employed in this regard. In general, tissues for which the parent drug is expected to be toxic will be used as 35     non-target tissues. The selection of a non-target tissue is entirely dependent upon<br><br><br><br>
11<br><br>
WO02/U8241	PCTAJS01/23104<br>
5     the nature of the prodrug and the activity of the parent. For example, non-hepatic tissues would be selected for prodrugs against hepatitis, and untransformed cells of the same tissue as the tumor will suffice for the antitumor-selective prodrug screen.<br>
It should be noted that the method of this invention is distinct from studies typically undertaken to determine oral bioavailability of prodrugs.' In oral<br>
10    bioavailability studies, the objective is to identify a prodrug which passes into the systemic circulation substantially converted to parent drug. In the present invention, the objective is to find prodrugs that are not metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract or circulation. Thus, target tissues to be evaluated in the method of this invention generally do not include the small intestines or, if the<br>
15     intestines are included, then the tissues also include additional tissues other than the small intestines.<br>
The target and non-target tissues used in the screening method of this invention typically will be in an intact living animal. Prodrugs containing esters are more desirably tested in dogs, monkeys or other animals than rodents; mice<br>
20     and rat plasma contains high circulating levels of esterases that may produce a misleading result if the desired therapeutic subject is a human or higher mammal.<br>
It is not necessary to practice this method with intact animals. It also is within the scope of this invention to employ perfused organs, in vitro culture of organs (e.g. skin grafts) or cell lines maintained in various forms of cell culture, e.g.<br>
25     roller bottles or zero gravity suspension systems. For example, MT-2 cells can be used as a target tissue for selecting HIV prodrugs. Thus, the term "tissue" shall not be construed to require organized cellular structures, or the structures of tissues as they may be found in nature, although such would be preferred. Rather, the term "tissue" shall be construed to be synonymous with cells of a particular source,<br>
30     origin or differentiation stage.<br>
The target and non-target tissue may in fact be the same tissue, but the tissues will be in different biological status. For example, the method herein could be used to select for prodrugs that confer activity in virally-infected tissue (target tissue) but which remain substantially inactive in virally-uninfected cells<br>
35     (corresponding non-target tissue). The same strategy would be employed to select<br>
12<br><br>
WO 02/08241	PCTAJS01/23104<br>
5    prophylactic prodrugs, i.e., prodrugs metabolized to antivirally active forms incidental to viral infection but which remain substantially unmetabolized in uninfected cells. Similarly, prodrugs could be screened in transformed'cells and the untransformed counterpart tissue. This would be particularly useful in comparative testing to select prodrugs for the treatment of hematological 10     malignancies, e.g. leukemias.<br>
Without being limited by any particular theory of operation, tissue selective prodrugs are thought to be selectively taken up by target cells and/or selectively metabolized within the cell, as compared to other tissues or cells. The unique advantage of the methoxyphosphonate prodrugs herein is that their metabolism to 15     the dianion at physiological pH ensures that they will be unable to diffuse back out of the cell. They therefore remain effective for lengthy periods of time and are maintained at elevated intracellular concentrations, thereby exhibiting increased potency. The mechanisms for enhanced activity in the target tissue are believed to include enhanced uptake by the target cells, enhanced intracellular retention, or 20    both mechanisms working together. However, the manner in which selectivity or enhanced delivery occurs in the target tissue is not important. It also is not important that all of the metabolic conversion of the prodrug to the parent compound occurs within the target tissue. Only the final drug activity-conferring conversion need occur in the target tissue; metabolism in other tissues may provide 25     intermediates finally converted to antiviral forms in the target tissue.<br>
The degree of selectivity or enhanced delivery that is desired will vary with the parent compound and the manner in which it is measured (% dose distribution or parent drug concentration). In general, if the parent drug already possess a generous therapeutic window, a low degree of selectivity may be sufficient for the 30    desired prodrug. On the other hand, toxic compounds may require more extensive screening to identify selective prodrugs. The relative expense of the method of this invention can be reduced by screening only in the target tissue and tissues against which the parent compound is known to be relatively toxic, e.g. for PMEA, which is nephrotoxic at higher doses, the primary focus will be on kidney and lymphoid 35     tissues.<br>
13<br><br><br>
5	The step of determining the relative antiviral activity of a prodrug in the<br>
selected tissues ordinarily is accomplished by assaying target and non-target tissues for the relative presence or activity of a metabolite of the prodrug, which metabolite is known to have, or is converted to, a metabolite having antiviral or antitumor activity. Thus, typically one would determine the relative amount of the<br>
10    parent drug in the tissues over substantially the same time course in order to identify prodrugs that are preferentially metabolized in the target tissue to an antivirally or antitumor active metabolite or precursor thereof which in the target tissue ultimately produces the active metabolite. In the case of antiviral compounds, the active metabolite is the diphosphate of the phosphonate parent<br>
15     compounds. It is this metabolite that is incorporated into the viral nucleic acid, thereby truncating the elongating nucleic acid strand and halting viral replication. Metabolites of the prodrug can be anabolic metabolites, catabolic metabolites", or the product of anabolism and catabolism together. The manner in which the metabolite is produced is not important in the practice of the method of this<br>
20    invention.<br>
The method of this invention is not limited to assaying a metabolite which per se possesses antiviral or antitumor activity. Instead, one can assay inactive precursors of the active metabolites. Precursors of the ahtivrally active diphosphate metabolite include the monophosphate of the parent drug,<br>
25     monophosphates of other metabolites of the parent drug (e.g., an intermediate modification of a substituent on the heterocyclic base), the parent itself and metabolites generated by the cell in converting the prodrug to the parent prior to phosphorylation. The precursor structures may vary considerably as they are the result of cellular metabolism. However, this information is already known or could<br>
30    be readily determined by one skilled in the art<br>
If the prodrug being assayed does not exhibit antitumor or antiviral activity per se then adjustments to the raw assay results may be required. For example, if the intracellular processing of the inactive metabolite to an active metabolite occurs at different rates among the tissues being tested, the raw assay results with the<br>
35    inactive metabolite would need to be adjusted to take account of the differences<br><br>
14<br><br>
. 5     among the cell types because the relevant parameter is the generation of activity in the target tissue, not accumulation of inactive metabolites. However, determining the proper adjustments would be within the ordinary skill. Thus, when step (d) of the method herein calls for deterrnining the activity, activity can be either measured directly or extrapolated. It does not mean that the method herein is<br>
10    limited to only assaying intermediates that are active perse. For instance, the<br>
absence or decline of the prodrug in the test tissues also could be assayed. Step (d) only requires assessment of the activity conferred by the prodrug as it interacts with the tissue concerned/and this may be based on extrapolation or other indirect •   measurement.<br>
15	Step (d) of the method of this invention calls for determining the 'relative"<br>
activity of the prodrug. It will be understood that this does not require that each and every assay or series of assays necessarily must also contain runs with the selected non-target tissue. On the contrary, it is within the scope of this invention to employ historical controls of the non-target tissue or tissues, or algorithms<br>
20    representing results to be expected from such non-target tissues, in order to provide the benchmark non-target activity.<br>
The results obtained in step (d) are then used optimally to select or identify a prodrug which produces greater antiviral activity in the target tissue than in the non-target tissue. It is this prodrug that is selected for further development.<br>
25	It will be appreciated that some preassessment of prodrug candidates can be<br>
undertaken before the practice of the method of this invention. For example, the prodrug will need to be capable of passing largely unmetabolized through the gastrointestinal tract, it will need to be substantially stable in blood, and it should be able to permeate cells at least to some degree. In most cases it also will need to<br>
30     complete a first pass of the hepatic circulation without substantial metabohsm. Such prestudies are optional, and are well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The same reasoning as is described above for antiviral activity is applicable to antitumor prodrugs of methoxyphosphonate nucleotide analogues as well. These include, for example, prodrugs of PMEG, the guanyl analogue of PMEA. In<br><br>
15<br><br>
5     this case, cytotoxic phosphonates such as PMEG are worthwhile candidates to pursue as their cytotoxicity in fact confers their antitumor activity.<br>
A compound identified by this novel screening method then can be entered into a traditional preclinical or clinical program to confirm that the desired objectives have been met. Typically, a prodrug is considered to be selective if the<br>
10     activity or concentration of parent drug in the target tissue (% dose distribution) is greater than 2x, and preferably 5x, that of the parent compound in non-target tissue. Alternatively, a prodrug candidate can be compared against a benchmark prodrug, In this case, selectivity is relative rather than absolute. Selective prodrugs will be those resulting in greater than about lOx concentration or activity in the<br>
15     target tissue as compared with the prototype, although the degree of selectivity is a matter of discretion.<br>
Novel Method for Preparation of Starting Materials or Intermediates Also included herein is an improved method for manufacture of preferred 20    starting materials (parent drugs) of this invention, PMEA and (R)~PMPA.<br>
Typically, this method comprises reacting 9~(2-hydroxypropyl)adenine (HPA) or 9-<br>
(2-hydroxyethyl)adenine (HEA) with a magnesium alkoxide, thereafter adding the<br>
protected aglycon synthonp-toluene-sulfonyloxymethylphosphonate (tosylate) to<br>
the reaction mixture, and recovering PMPA or PMEA, respectively.<br>
25	Preferably, HPA is the enriched or isolated R enantiomer. If a chiral HPA<br>
mixture is used, R-PMPA can be isolated from the chiral PMPA mixture after the synthesis is completed.<br>
Typically the tosylate is protected by lower alkyl groups, but other suitable groups will be apparent to the artisan. It may be convenient to employ the tosylate 30    presubstituted with the prodrug phosphonate substituents which are capable of acting as protecting groups in the tosylation reaction, thereby allowing one to bypass the deprotection step and directly recover prodrug or an intermediate therefore.<br>
The alkyl group of the magnesium alkoxide is not critical and can be any Cx-<br>
3S    C6branched or normal alkyl, but is preferably t-butyl (for PMPA) or isopropyl (for<br>
16<br><br>
PMEA). The reaction conditions also are not critical, but preferably comprise heating the reaction mixture at about 70-75"C with stirring or other moderate agitation.<br>
If there is no interest in retaining the phosphonate substituents, the product is deprotected (usually with bromotrimethylsilane where the tosylate protecting group is alkyl), and the product then recovered by crystallization or other conventional method as will be apparent to the artisan.<br>

5     Monophenyl PMPA (II). A round-bottom flask with reflux condenser and<br>
nitrogen inlet was placed in a 70°C oil bath. The flask was charged with anhydrous PMPA (I) (19.2 g, 67 mmol), N,N-dimethy formamide (0.29 g, 3.3 mmol), and tetramethylene sulfone (40 mL). Thionyl chloride (14.2 g, 119 mmol) was added over 4 hours. Heating was increased to 100°C over the same time. A homogeneous<br>
10    solution resulted. Phenoxytrimethylsilane (11.7 g, 70 mmol) was added to the solution over 5 minutes. Heating in the 100°C oil bath continued for two hours more. The reaction was poured into rapidly stirring acetone (400 mL) with cooling at 0°C. Solids were isolated by filtration, dried under reduced pressure, and dissolved in methanol (75 mL). The solution pH was adjusted to 3.0 with<br>
15 potassium hydroxide solution (45% aq.) with cooling in ice/water. The resulting solids were isolated by filtration, rinsed with methanol, and dried under reduced pressure to 20.4 g II (Scheme 2) as a white powder.<br>
GS-7X71 OH). Monophenyl PMPA (II) (3 g, 8.3 mmol), tetramethylene sulfone (5 20    mL), and N,N-dimethyHormamide (1 drop) were combined in a round bottom flask in a 40°C oil bath. Thionyl chloride (1.96 g, 16.5 mmol) was added. After 20 minutes the clear solution was removed from heat, diluted with dichloromethane (10 ml), and added to a solution of (L)-alanine isopropyl ester (5g, 33 mmol) and diisopropylemylamine (5.33 g, 41 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) at -10°C. The 25     reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and washed three times with sodium dihydrogenphosphate solution (10% aq., 10 mL each wash). The organic solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to a oil. The oil was combined with fumaric acid (0.77g, 6.6 mmol) and acetonitrile (40 mL) and heated to reflux to give a homogeneous 30     solution. The solution was cooled in an ice bath and solids isolated by filtration. The solid GS-7171 fumarate salt was dried under reduced pressure to 3.7 g. The salt (3.16 g, 5.3 mmol) was suspended in dichloromethane (30 mL) and stirred with potassium carbonate solution (5 mL, 2.5 M in water) until the solid dissolved. The organic layer was isolated, then washed with water (5 mL), dried over anhydrous<br>

Example 3 A. Diastereomer Separation by Batch Elution Chromatography<br>

The diastereomers of GS-7171 (III) were resolved by batch elution chromatography using a commercially available Chiralpak AS, 20 urn, 21 x 250 mm semi-preparative HPLC column with a Chiralpak AS, 20 urn, 21 x 50 mm guard column. Chiralpak® AS is a proprietary packing material manufactured by Diacel<br>
15     and sold in North America by Chiral Technologies, Inc. (U. S. Patent Nos. 5,202,433, RE 35,919,5,434,298,5,434,299 and 5,498,752). Chiralpak AS is a chiral stationary phase (CSP) comprised of amylosetris[(S)- methylbenzyl carbamate] coated onto a silica gel support.<br>
The GS-7171 diastereomeric mixture was dissolved in mobile phase, and<br>
20    approximately 1 g aliquots of GS-7171 were pumped onto the chromatographic system. The undesired diastereomer, designated GS-7339, was the first major broad (approx. 15 min. duration) peak to elute from the column. When the GS-7339 peak had finished eluting, the mobile phase was immediately switched to 100% methyl alcohol, which caused the desired diastereomer, designated GS-7340 (IV),<br>
25    to elute as a sharp peak from the column with the methyl alcohol solvent front. The methyl alcohol was used to reduce the over-all cycle time. After the first couple of injections, both diastereomers were collected as a single large fractions containing one of the purified diastereomers (&gt;99.0% single diastereomer). The mobile phase solvents were removed in vacuo to yield the purified diastereomer as a friable foam.<br>
30	About 95% of the starting GS-7171 mass was recovered in the two<br>
diastereomer fractions. The GS-7340 fraction comprised about 50% of the total recovered mass.<br>

Alternative Procedure for Preparation of GS-7097<br>
GS-7097: Phenyl PMPA, Ethyl L-Alanyl Amidate. Phenyl PMPA (15.0 g, 41.3 mmol), L-alanine ethyl ester hydrochloride (12.6 g, 83 mmol) and triethylamine<br>
25     (11.5 mL, 83 mmol) were slurried together in 500 mL pyridine under dry N2. This<br>
suspension was combined with a solution of triphenylphosphine (37.9 g, 145 mmol), Aldrithiol2 (2,2*-dipyridyl disulfide) (31.8 g, 145 mmol), and 120 mL pyridine. The mixture was heated at an internal temperature of 57°C for 15 hours. The complete reaction was concentrated under vacuum to a yellow paste, 100 g. 30    The paste was purified by column chromatography over a 25 x 11 cm bed of 1.1 kg silica gel 60,230 to 400 mesh. The column was ehited with 8 liters of 2% methanol in dichloromethane followed by a linear gradient over a course of 26 liters eluent up to a final composition of 13% methanol. Clean product bearing fractions were<br>
concentrated to yield 12.4 g crude (5), 65% theory. This material was contaminated<br>

5     sulfate, and concentrating to yield 11.1 g pure GS-7097 as a white solid, 58% yield. The process also is employed to synthesize theiastereomeric mixture of GS-7003a and GS-7003b (the phenylalanyl amidate) and the mixture GS-7119 and GS-7335 (the glycol amidate). These diastereomers are separated using a batch elution procedure such as shown in Example 3A, 6 and 7. 10<br>
Example 9 In Vitro Studies of Prodrug Diastereomers<br>
The in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and cytotoxicity in MT-2 cells and stability in 15    human plasma and MT-2 cell extracts of GS-7340 (freebase) and tenofovir<br>
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), are shown in Table 1. GS-7340 shows a 10-fold increase in antiviral activity relative to TDF and a 200-fold increase in plasma stability. This greater plasma stability is expected to result in higher circulating levels of GS-7340 than TDF after oral administration. 20<br>
Table 1. In Vitro Activity and Stability<br><br>
25	In order to estimate the relative intracellular PMPA resulting from the<br>
intracellular metabolism of TDF as compared to that from GS-7340, both prodrugs and PMPA were radiolabeled and spiked into intact human whole blood at equimolar concentrations. After 1 hour, plasma, red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated- and analyzed by HPLC<br>
30     with radiometric detection. The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
37 <br>
WO 02/08241<br><br>
PCT/US01/23104<br><br>
After 1 hour, GS-7340 results in lOx and 30x the total intracellular concentration of PMPA, species in PBMCs as compared to TDF and PMPA, respectively. In plasma after 1 hour, 84% of the radioactivity is due to intact GS-7340, whereas no TDF is detected at 1 hour. Since no intact TDF is detected in plasma, the lOx difference at 1 hour between TDF and GS-7340 is the minimum difference expected in vivo. The HPLC chromatogram for all three compounds in PBMCs is shown in Figure 1.<br>

Met. X and Met Y (metabolites X and Y) are shown in Table 5. Lower case "p" designates phosphorylation. These results were obtained after 1 hour in human blood. With increasmgtime, the in vitro differences are expected to increase, since 84% of GS-7340 is still intact in plasma after one hour. Because intact GS-7340 is present in plasma after oral administration, the relative clinical efficacy should be related to the IC, values seen in vitro.<br>
In Table 3 below, IC^ values of tenofoviir, TDF, GS-7340, several nucleosides and the protease inhibitor nelfinivir are listed. As shown, nelfinavir and GS-7340 are 2-3 orders of magnitude more potent than all other nucleotides or nucleosides.<br><br>

immediatelyfor plasma by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Plasma samples were frozen and maintained at 70°C until analyzed.<br>
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) preparation. Whole blood (8 ml) 30     drawn at specified time points was mixed in equal proportion with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), layered onto 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque solution (Pharmacia Biotech,) and centrifuged at 400 x g for 40 min. PBMC layer was removed and<br><br><br><br><br>

5     washed once with PBS. Formed PMBC pellet was reconstituted in 0.5 ml of PBS, cells were resuspended, counted using hemocytometer and maintained at 70°C until analyzed. The number of' cells multiplied by the mean single-cell volume was used in calculation of intracellular concentrations. A reported value of 200 femtoliters/cell was used as the resting PBMC volume (B. L. Robins, R.V, Srinivas,<br>
10     C. Kim, N. Bischofberger, and A. Fridland, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42,612 (1998).<br>
Determination of PMPA and Prodrugs in plasma and PBMCs. The concentration of PMPA in dog plasma samples was determined by derivatizing PMPA with<br>
15     chloroacetaldehyde to yield a highlyfluorescent N1, N6-ethenoadenine derivative (L. Naesens, J. Balzarini, and E. De Clercq, Clin. Chem. 38,480 (1992). Briefly, plasma (100 ul) was mixed with200 ul acetonitrile to precipitate protein. Samples were then evaporated to dryness under reducedpressure at room temperature. Dried samples were reconstituted in 200 ul derivatization cocktail (0.34% chloroacetaldehyde in 100<br>
20    mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5), vortexed, and centrifuged. Supernatant was then<br>
transferred to a clean screw-cap tube and incubated at95°C for 40 rnin. Derivatized samples were then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 100 ul of water for HPLC analysis.<br>
25     Before intracellular PMPA could be determined by HPLC, the large amounts of<br>
adenine related ribonucleotides present in the PBMC extracts had to be removed by selective oxidation. We used a modified procedure of Tanaka et al (K. Tanaka, A. Yoshioka, S. Tanaka, and Y. Wataya, Anal. Biochem., 139,35 (1984). Briefly, PBMC samples were mixed 1:2 with methanol and evaporated to dryness under reduced<br>
30    pressure. The dried samples were derivatized as described in the plasma assay. The derivatized samples were mixed with 20 uL of 1M rhamnose and 30 uL of 0.1M sodium periodate and inaabated at 370Cfor5rriin. Following incubation, 40uLof 4M memylamine and 20 uL of 0.5M inosine were added. After incubation at 37°C for 30 rnin, samples were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and<br>
35    reconstituted in water for HPLC analysis.<br>
46<br><br>
5    No intact prodrug was detected in any PBMC samples. For plasma samples potentially containing intact prodrugs, experiments were performed to verify that no furmer conversion to PMPA occurred during derivatization. Prodrug standards were added to drug-freeplasma and derivatized as described. There were no detectablelevels of PMPA present in any of the plasma samples, and the projected<br>
10     %of conversion was less than 1%.<br>
The HPLC system was comprised of a P4000 solvent delivery system with AS3000 autoinjector and F2000 fluorescence detector (Thermo Separation, San Jose, CA). The column was an Inertsil ODS-2 column (4.6 x 150 mm). The mobile phases used<br>
15    were: A, 5% acetonitrile in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer with SmM tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBABr), pH 6.0; B, 60% acetonitrile in 25 mM potassium phosphatebuffer with 5 mM TBABr, pH 6.0. The flow rate was 2 ml/rnin and the column temperature was maintained at 35°C by a column oven. The gradient profile was 90% A/10% B for 10 min for PMPA and 65%A/35%B for 10 min for the<br>
20    prodrug. Detection was by fluorescence with excitation at 236 run and emission at 420 ran, and the injection volume was 10 uL Data was acquired and stored by a laboratory data acquisition system (PeakPro, Beckman, Allendale, NJ).<br>
Pharmacokinetic Calculations. PMPA and prodrug exposures were expressed as 25    areas under concentration curves in plasma or PBMC from zero to 24 hours (AUC). The AUC values were calculated using the trapezoidal rule.<br>
Plasma and PBMC Concentrations. The results of this study is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows the time course of GS 7340-2 metabolism summary of plasma 30     and PBMC exposures following oral administration of pure diastereoisomers of the PMPA prodrugs.<br>

The bar graph in Figure 2 shows the AUC (0-24h) for tenofovir in dog PBMCs and plasma after administration of PMPA s.c, TDF and amidate ester prodrugs. AU of the amidate prodrugs exhibited increases in PBMC exposure. For example, GS 7340 results in a ~21-fold increase in PBMC exposure as compared to PMPA s.c. and TDF; and a 6.25-fold and 1.29-fold decrease in plasma exposure, respectively.<br><br><br>

These data establish in vivo that GS 7340 can be delivered orally, xrunirnizes systemic exposure to PMPA and greatly enhances the iatracellular concentration of PMPA in the cells primarily responsible for HIV replication.<br>

Example 11 Biodistribution of GS-7340<br>
As part of the preclinical characterization of GS-7340, its biodistribution in dogs was determined. The tissue distribution of GS-7340 (isopropyl alaninyl monoamidate, phenyl monoester of tenofovir) was examined following oral administratioii to beagle dogs. Two male animals were dosed orally with WC=GS-7340 (8.85 mg-equiv. of PMPA/kg, 33.2 uCi/kg; the 8-carbon of adenine is labeled) in an aqueous solution (50 mM citric add, pH 2.2). Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained over the 24-hr period. Urine and feces were cage collected over 24 hr. At 24 h after the dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissues removed for analysis. Total radioactivity in tissues was determined fay oxidation and liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The biodistribution of PMPA after 24 hours after a single oral dose of radiolabeled GS 7340 is shown in Table 4 along with the data from a previous study with TDF (GS-4331). In the case of TDF, the prodrug concentration in the plasma is below the level of assay detection, and the main species observed in plasma is the parent drug. Levels of PMPA in the lymphatic tissues, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle are increased 10-fold after administration of GS-7340.<br>
50<br><br>
Accumulation in lymphatic tissues is consistent with the data observed from the PBMC analyses, since these tissues are composed primarily of lymphocytes. Likewise, accumulation in bone marrow is probably due to the high percentage of lymphocytes (70%) in this tissue.<br>
