				<td>ORGANIC COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to fiber-reactive dyestuffs, a process of mailing tlie same and to their use in dyeing or printing hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates.<br>
According to the invention there are provided fiber-reactive dyestuffs which are compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>
wherein    B is a divalent group,<br>
Ri and R2 are independently from each other H or an optionally substituted Cvealkyl-group,<br>
V	is CI or F,<br>
X signifies a -Ci^-alkyl group,<br>
Y	signifies a -CH=CH2 group or a -CH2CH2-Z group, wherein Z is a radical<br>
which can be eliminated by alkali,<br>
or a salt thereof and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
The alkyl groups can be linear or branched.<br>
Preferably B is an aliphatic, an aromatic or an araliphatic group. This group can be linear, branched or cyclic. The group can optionally be substituted by one or more substituents and/or interrupted by one or more heteroatoms chosen from the group O, S and N.<br>
Preferably the substituents are chosen from the group consisting of Ci^-alkyl, -OH, -SO3H,-COOH or-CN.<br><br>
For the case that B is an aliphatic group, the number of C-atoms goes from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 6.<br>
For the case that B is an aromatic group, the number of C-atoms goes from 4 to 20. Preferably the B comprises an optionally substituted benzene and/or an optionally substituted naphthalene group.<br>
Preferably X is a C^^ alkyl group, more preferably a -CH3 group.<br>
Preferably Z is a -OSO3H group.<br>
Preferably Ri is H or an unsubstituted Cve-alkyl group, more preferably H or an unsubstituted Ci.4-alkyl-group, most preferably a H or a -CzHs group.<br>
Preferably R2 is H or an unsubstituted Ci^-alkyl group, more preferably H or an unsubstituted C^-alkyl-group, most preferably a H.<br>
When a fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) is in its salt-form, the cation associated with the sulpho-groups is not critical and may be any of those non-chromophoric cations conventional in the field of fiber-reactive dyestuffs provided that the corresponding salt is substantially water soluble. Examples of such cations are alkali metal cations, for example potassium, lithium or sodium ions and ammonium cations, e.g. mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-methyl or mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-ethyl ammonium cations. The cations may be the same or different, i.e. the compounds may be in mixed salt-form.<br>
A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) displays good compatibility with other known dyestuffs. Accordingly, it may be mixed with other dyestuffs to fomn a composition, which can be used to dye or print suitable substrates. Said other dyestuffs must be compatible with a compound of formula (I), that is, they must have similar dyeing or printing properties, for example fastness properties.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides in another of its aspects a dyeing or printing composition comprising a fiber-reactive dyestuff of the formula (I).<br><br>
In another aspect of the invention there is provided a process of forming a fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (1) or a salt thereof comprising the step of reacting a diazotized compound of the formula (II)<br><br>

CONH2<br>

CH2CH2COOH<br>
wherein X has the meaning as defined above.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium at a temperature of from 0 to 25'C, more preferably 0 to ICC and at a pH of between 1 to 7, more preferably 1 to 6.<br>
A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) may be isolated in accordance with known methods, for example by salting out, filtering and drying optionally in vacuum and at slightly elevated temperature.<br>
Depending on the reaction and/or isolation conditions, a fiber-reactive dyestuff of the formula (I) may be obtained in free-acid or salt-form or mixed salt-form, containing for example one or more of the above-mentioned cations. A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) may be converted from salt-form or mixed salt-form to free-acid form or vice versa using conventional techniques.<br><br>

wherein all substituents have the meanings as defined above.<br>
The compounds (III) are derivable by well known syntheses from commonplace starting materials well known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
A fiber-reactive dyestuff of the formula (I) is useful as a fiber-reactive dyestuff for dyeing or printing hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates. Preferred substrates are leather and fibrous materials which comprise natural or synthetic polyamides and, particularly, natural or regenerated cellulose such as cotton, viscose and spun rayon. The most preferred substrates are textile materials comprising cotton.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a fiber-reactive dyestuff according to the formula (I) or a salt thereof as a fiber-reactive dyestuff for dyeing or printing hydroxy-group-containing or nitrogen-containing organic substrates.<br>
Dyeing or printing may be carried out in accordance with known methods conventional in the fiber-reactive dyestuff field.<br>
5'<br><br>
In a preferred dyeing process the exhaust-dyeing method is used at temperatures within the range of from 40 to lOO'C, more preferably 50 to 80°C. A fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) gives good exhaust and fixation yields. Moreover, any unfixed dyestuff is easily washed from the substrate.<br>
In a preferred printing process, the padding method is used, for example pad-steam, pad-thermofix, pad-dry, pad-batch, pad-jig and pad-roll. Alternatively, printing may be carried out using ink-jet methods.<br>
A dyeing or print obtained with said fiber-reactive dyestuff exhibits good wet and light fastness. They also exhibit good resistance to oxidizing agents such as chlorinated water, hypochlorites, peroxides and perborate-containing washing detergents. Furthermore, a dyeing or print obtained with said fiber-reactive dyestuff of formula (I) display high stability to acid hydrolysis, for example a dyeing when contacted with dilute acetic acid only causes a slight staining of an undyed accompanying fabric.<br>
Dyeings and prints obtained using mixtures of dyestuffs display good fastness properties which are comparable with those fastness properties obtained with a compound of formula (1) alone.<br>
There now follows a series of examples, which serve to illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
62 parts of 3-ethylamino-ben2ene(2'-sulfatoethylsulfone) are dissolved in 250 parts of water the pH is adjusted with 15% sodium carbonate solution at 4 and the resulting mixture is cooled down to 8 - 12°C. At this temperature a stirred suspension of 37 parts of 2,4,6-trichIorotriazine in 160 parts of ice/water is added during 5 minutes. The reaction mixture is stirred for some 200 minutes more. The pH is increased to 4.5 - 5 by addition of 15% sodium carbonate solution. Once the reaction is accomplished a solution made by dissolving 37 parts of 2,4-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid with 26 parts of sodium hydroxide (30%) in 200 parts of water is added to the reaction mixture. Then the pH is increased to 5.5 - 6 by addition of 15% sodium carbonate solution and the temperature is maintained at 15 - 20*C.<br>
L<br><br>
The reaction mixture is cooled down to 0 - S'C and is diazotized by addition of 90 parts of hydrochloric acid (30%) and 13.6 parts sodium nitrite.<br>
After the diazotation is finished and diazo mixture is added to the solution made by dissolving 47 parts of a compound according to the formula (IV)<br><br>

CH2CH2COOH<br>
with 50 parts of sodium hydroxide (30%) in 200 parts of water. The pH value is raised further to 1 to 6 by addition of 15% sodium carbonate solution and the obtained solution spray dried. About 250 parts of a yellow salt containing powder are obtained which dyes cellulose fibers in yellow shades. The dyestuff corresponds to the formula (V)<br>

and the resultant dyeings exhibited excellent light and wet fastness properties whereby the unfixed dyestuff can easily be washed out, even from deep dyeings, and were resistant to oxidative influences.<br>
