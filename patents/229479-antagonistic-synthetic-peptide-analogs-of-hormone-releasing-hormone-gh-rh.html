				<td>Field Of Invention<br>
"ANTAGONisTIC  SYNTHETIC  PEPTIDE ANALOGS OF GROTH HORMON<br>
  	RELEASING  HORMONE   (GH-RH)	<br>
This invention was made in part with Government support from the Medical Research<br>
Service of the Veterans Affairs Department The Government has certain rights in this application<br>
(VA No. 03-084, assigned July 25,2003).<br>
The present invention relates to novel synthetic peptides that inhibit the release of growth<br>
hormone from the pituitary in mammals as well as inhibit the promeraron Or human cancers<br>
through a direct effect on the cancer cells, and to therapeutic compositions containing these novel<br>
peptides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH) is a peptide belonging to the<br>
secretin/glucagon family of neuroendocrine and gastrointestinal hormones, a family mat also<br>
includes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP)<br>
and others. Human GH-RH (hGH-RH) peptide is comprised of 44 amino acid residues. The best<br>
known site of production of GH-RH is the hypothalamus, but it was found that various peripheral<br>
organs also synthesize it hGH-RH is also produced, sometimes in large quantities, by human<br>
malignant tissues (cancers) of diverse origin.<br>
GH-RH exerts various physiological and pathophysiological functions. Hypothalamic GH-<br>
RH is an endocrine releasing hormone that, acting through specific GH-RH receptors on the<br>
pituitary, regulates the secretion of pituitary growth hormone (GH). The physiological functions of<br>
GH-RH in extrapituitary tissues are less clear. However, there is increasing evidence for the role of<br>
GH-RH as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor in various cancers. Splice variant (SV) receptors<br>
for GH-RH. different from those expressed in the pituitary, have been described in a wide range of<br>
human cancers and in some normal peripheral organs. The actions of tumoral autocrine/paracrine<br>
GH-RH could be exerted on these receptors. In addition, receptors and other, as yet<br>
In view of the role of GH-RH as an endocrine regulator of GH release, novel therapeutic<br>
strategies, based on the use of agonistic and antagonistic analogs of GH-RH, have been devised<br>
for the treatment of various pathological conditions.<br>
GH is a polypeptide having 191 amino acids that stimulates the production of different<br>
growth factors, e.g. insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and consequently promotes growth of<br>
numerous tissues (skeleton, connective tissue, muscle and viscera) and stimulates various<br>
physiological activities (raising the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, and raising IIpolysis, but<br>
lowering urea secretion). Release of pituitary GH is under the control of releasing and inhibiting<br><br>
factors secreted by the hypothalamus, the primary releasing factors being GH-RH and ghrelin, and<br>
the main inhibiting factor being somatostatin.<br>
GH has been implicated in several diseases. One disease in which GH is involved is<br>
acromegaly, in which excessive levels of GH are present The abnormally enlarged facial and<br>
extremity bones, and the cardiovascular symptoms of this disease can be treated by administering<br>
a GH-RH antagonist Further diseases involving GH are diabetic retinopathy and diabetic<br>
nephropathy. The damage to the retina and kidneys respectively in these diseases, believed to be<br>
due to hypersecretion of GH, results in blindness or reduction in kidney function. This damage can<br>
be prevented or slowed by administration of an effective GH-RH antagonist<br>
In an effort to intervene in these disease and other conditions, some investigators have<br>
attempted to control GH and IGF-l levels by using analogs of somatostatin, an inhibitor of GH<br>
release.   However, somatostatin analogs, If administered alone, do not suppress GH or IGF-l<br>
levels to a desired degree. If administered in combination with a GH-RH antagonist, somatostatin<br>
analogs will suppress IGF-l levels much better.<br>
However, the main applications of GH-RH antagonists are in the field of cancer (reviewed<br>
in Serially AV and Varga JL, Trends Endocrinol Metab 10: 383-391, 1999; Serially AV et al,<br>
Frontiers Neuroendocrinol 22: 248-291, 2001; Schally AV and Comaru-Schally AM, in: Kufe DW,<br>
Pollock RE, Weichselbaum RR, Bast Jr. RC, Gansler TS, Holland JF, Frei III E, Eds. Cancer<br>
Medicine, 6th ed. Hamilton, Ontario: BC. Decker, Inc., 2003, p.911-926). GH-RH antagonists inhibit<br>
the proliferation of malignancies by indirect endocrine mechanisms based on the inhibition of<br>
pituitary GH release and resulting in the decrease of serum levels of GH and IGF-l, as well as by<br>
25 direct effects on the tumor tissue.<br>
GH-RH and its tumoral splice variant (SV) receptors are present in human cancers of the<br>
lung, prostate, breast, ovary, endometrium, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, and bone (see<br>
Halmos G et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci: USA97: 10555-10560,2000; Rekasi.Z et at, Proc Natt Acad<br>
S3 USA 97:10561-10566, 2000; Schally AV et al, Frontiers Neuroendocrinol 22: 248-291, 2001;<br>
Serially AV and Comaru-Schally AM, In: Kufe DW, Pollock RE, Weichselbaum RR, Bast Jr. RC,<br>
Gansler TS, Holland JF, Frei III E, Eds. Cancer Medicine, 6 ed. Hamilton, Ontario: BC. Decker,<br>
Inc., 2003, p.911-926). Tumoral GH-RH has been shown or it is suspected to act as an autocrine<br>
growth factor in these malignancies. Antagonistic analogs of GH-RH can inhibit the stimulatory<br>
35 activity of GH-RH and exert direct antiproliferative effects in vitro on cancer cells, and in vivo on<br>
tumors. Direct antiproliferative effects of GH-RH antagonists are exerted on tumoral receptors<br>
(binding sites). In addition to the specific tumoral SV receptors for GH-RH, receptors for VIP and<br>
other, as yet unidentified receptors of mis family, are targets of GH-RH antagonists.<br><br>
In addition to endocrine inhibitory effects on serum 6H and IGF-I, GH-RH antagonists<br>
have been found to reduce the autocrine and paracrine production of several tumor growth factors<br>
and/or downregulate their receptors. These growth factors include IGF-I, IGF-II, GH, vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Thus, a disruption of the<br>
autocrine/paracrine stimulatory loops based on these growth factors contributes to the efficacy of<br>
GH-RH antagonists as antitumor agents.<br>
IGF-I and lGF-II are autocrine/paracrine growth factors with potent mitogenic effects on<br>
various cancers. IGF-I is also an endocrine growth factor, and elevated levels of serum IGF-I are<br>
considered an epidemiological risk factor for the development of prostate cancer, lung cancer, and<br>
colorectal cancer. The involvement of IGF-I (somatomedin-C) in breast cancer, prostate cancer,<br>
colon cancer, bone tumors and other malignancies is well established. Nevertheless,<br>
autocnne/paracrine control of proliferation by IGF-II is also a major factor in many tumors. IGF-I<br>
and IGF-II exert their proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects through the common IGF-I receptor.<br>
The receptors for IGF-I are present in primary human breast cancers, prostate cancers, lung<br>
cancers, colon cancers, brain tumors, pancreatic cancers, and in renal cell carcinomas. In several<br>
experimental cancers, such as those of the bone, lung, prostate, kidney, breast, ovary, intestine,<br>
pancreas, and brain, treatment with GH-RH antagonists produces a reduction in IGF-l and/or IGF-<br>
II levels, concomitant to inhibition of tumor growth (reviewed in Schally AV and Varga JL, Trends<br>
Endocrinol Metab 10: 383-391, 1999; Schally AV et al, Frontiers Neuroendocrinol 22: 248-291,<br>
2001; Schally AV and Comaru-Schally AM, in: Kufe DW, Pollock RE, Weichselbaum RR, Bast Jr.<br>
RC, Ganster TS, Holland JF, Frei 111 E, Eds. Cancer Medicine, 6th ed. Hamilton, Ontario: BC.<br>
Decker, Inc., 2003, p.911-926). In some cases, the expression of IGF-I receptors was also<br>
decreased by GH-RH antagonists. Thus the disruption of endocrine and autocrine/paracrine<br>
stimulatory loops dependent on IGF-I and IGF-II contributes to the. antitumor effect of GH-RH<br>
antagonists.<br>
In MXT breast cancer model, treatment with GH-RH antagonists inhibited tumor growth,<br>
reduced the mRNA level for GH and the concentration of GH peptide in tumors, and inhibited the<br>
mRNA expression for GH receptors (Szepeshazi K et al, Endocrinology 142: 4371-4378, 2001).<br>
GH was shown to act as a growth factor for MXT murine mammary carcinoma cells, MCF-7 human<br>
breast cancer cells and other tumor cell lines. Thus the inhibitory activity of GH-RH antagonists on<br>
local and serum GH levels contributes to their antitumor effect<br>
GH-RH antagonists have been shown to inhibit the mRNA levels and protein<br>
concentrations of VEGF in human androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent prostate cancer<br>
models (Letsch M et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100: 1250-1255, 2003; Plonowski A et al,<br>
Prostate 52: 173-182, 2002) and this phenomenon contributes to their antitumor effect, since<br>
VEGF plays an Important stimulatory role in the neovascularization and growth of various tumors.<br>
40 Moreover, it was found that a GH-RH antagonist inhibited the VEGF secretion and proliferation of<br><br>
normal murine endothelial cells, apparently through a direct effect on these cells in vitro (Siejka A<br>
et al. Life Sci 72:2473-2479,2003).<br>
Scientists have investigated various modifications of GH-RH to elucidate the relationship<br>
5 of the structure of GH-RH to its activity on the pituitary receptors, in an effort to provide synthetic<br>
congeners with improved agonistic or antagonistic properties. Thus, it was early established that<br>
GH-RH fragment comprising residues 1 to 29, or GH-RH(1-29), is the minimum sequence<br>
necessary for biological activity on the pituitary. This fragment retains 50% or more of the potency<br>
of native GH-RH. Subsequently, many synthetic analogs of GH-RH, based on the structure of<br>
hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 peptide, were prepared. hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 has the following amino acid<br>
sequence:<br>
Tyr-Ala-Asp-Ala-lle5-Phe-Thr-Asn-Ser-Tye10-<br>
Leu-Gln-Asp25-lle-Met-Ser-Arg29-NH2<br><br>
A considerable number of patents and articles in the open literature disclose analogs of<br>
GH-RH which either act as agonists of GH-RH (I.e. act to stimulate the release of GH) or as<br>
antagonists of GH-RH (i.e. act to inhibit the release of GH) on the pituitary. Most of these peptides<br>
are derived from the GH-RH(1-29) peptide sequence, with specific structural modifications which<br>
account for their enhanced agonistic or antagonistic properties on the pituitary receptors. However,<br>
apart from a few exceptions, it is not known how these analogs would behave on cancer cells that<br>
express GH-RH receptors different from those found in the pituitary. Only a few published scientific<br>
studies tried to elucidate the structure-activity relationships and characterize the direct antagonistic<br>
(or agonistic) effects of GH-RH analogs on cancer cells and tumors (see Rekasi Z et al,<br>
Endocrinology 141: 2120-2128, 2000; Halmos G et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:10555-10560,<br>
2000; Rekasi Z et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97: 10561-10566, 2000; Kiaris H et al, Proc Natl<br>
Acad Sci USA 99: 196-200, 2002), and no issued patents have dealt with this issue so far.<br>
Consequently, very littte is known about the structural features in GH-RH analogs required for a<br>
direct<br>
The first described GH-RH antagonist [Ac-Tyr1,D-Arg2]hGH-RH(1-29)rNH2, which is<br>
generally termed as the "standard antagonist in the literature, was found to prevent the activation<br>
of rat anterior bituitary aaenviate cyclase by hGH-RH(1-29)NH2- The same peptide blocked the<br>
action or GH-RH on its receptors in the pituitary and hypothalamus, and inhibited the pulsatile<br>
grow hormone secretion.The standard antagonist was also evaluated clinically (Ocampo-Lim B<br>
et ai, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 81: 4396-4399, 1996; Jaffe CA et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 82:<br>
634-637, 1997). Large doses of this antagonist (400 ug/kg) eliminated nocturnal GH secretion in<br>
normal subjects and inhibited the response to GH-RH. The standard GH-RH antagonist also<br>
reduced GH levels in a patient with acromegaly. However, for clinical use, much more potent<br>
■ 40 antagonists of GH-RH aire required.<br><br>
The inventions mentioned below disclose GH-RH analogs with antagonistic or agonistic<br>
properties on the pituitary receptors for GH-RH. However it was not reported and not investigated<br>
whether these analogs could exert direct effects on tumor cells.<br><br>
US Patent 4,650,693 discloses GH-RH antagonistic analogs which contain certain N,N-<br>
dialkyl-omega-guanidino alpha-amino acyl residues in position 2 of the GH-RH(1-29) sequence.<br>
Published application WO 91/16923 reviews earlier attempts to alter the secondary<br>
structure of hGH-RH by modifying Its amino acid sequence. These earlier attempts include:<br>
replacing Tyr1. Ala2, Asp3 or Asn8 with their D-isomers; replacing Asn8 with L- or D-Ser, D-Arg.<br>
Asn, Thr, Gln or D-Lys; replacing Ser8 with Ala to enhance amphiphilicity of the region; and<br>
replacing Gly15 with Ala or Alb. When R2 in the analogs is D-Arg, and R8, R9, and R15 are<br>
substituted as indicated above, antagonistic activity is said to result These antagonistic peptides<br>
are said to be suitable for administration as pharmaceutical compositions to treat conditions<br>
associated with excessive levels of GH, e.g., acromegaly.<br>
The antagonistic activity of the hGH-RH analogue "[Sei9-psilCH2-NH]-Tyr10]hGH-RH(1-<br>
29)" of US Patent 5,064,555 was said to result from the pseudopeptide bond (i.e., a peptide bond<br>
20 reduced to a [CH2-NH] linkage) between the R9 and R10 residues. However, the antagonistic<br>
properties of [Ser9-psi[CH2-NH]-Tyr10]hGH-RH(1-29) were said to be inferior to the standard<br>
antagonist, [N-Ac-Tyr1, D-Arg2]hGH-RH(1-29)-NH2.<br>
US Patent 5,550,212, US Patent 5,942,489, and US Patent 6,057,422, assigned to the<br>
25 same assignee as the present application, disclose analogs of hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 said to have<br>
enhanced antagonistic properties and prolonged duration of action regarding the inhibition of GH-<br>
RH-evoked GH release. These properties are believed to result from replacement of various amino<br>
acids and acytation with aromatic or nonpolar acids at the N-terminus of GH-RH(1-29)NH2. The<br>
tumor inhibitory properties of antagonists featured in US Patent   5,942,489 and US Patent<br>
30 6,057,42J2 have been demonstrated by using mice mice bearing xenografts of experimental human<br>
cancer models. It is noted that in US Patent 5,550,212, and in US Patent 5,942,489, R9 is always<br>
Ser, while R11 and R20 can be either Arg, D-Arg, or Cit In the case of US Patent 6,057,422, R9 can<br>
be either Arg, Har, Lys, Om, D-Arg, D-Har, D-Lys, D-Om, Cit, Nle, Tyr(Me), Ser, Ala, or Alb, while<br>
R11 and R20 are always Arg.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is provided a novel series of synthetic analogs of hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 and hGH-<br>
RH(1-30)NH2. These analogs inhibit the release of growth hormone from the pituitary in mammals<br>
40 as well as inhibit the proliferation of human cancers through a direct effect on the cancer cells. The<br><br>
stronger inhibitory potencies of the new analogs, as compared to previously described ones,<br>
results from replacement of various amino acids.<br><br>
wherein R1 is a member of the group consisting of a) PhAc, Hca, Dat, IndAc, Ipa, 1-Nac,<br>
2-Nac, 1-Npr, 2-Npr, Ibu; CH3(CH2)CO, or HOOC(CH2)nCO, where n is an integer from 2 to 20,<br>
and b) any other straight chain, cyclic branch chain, saturated, unsaturated or poly unsaturated<br>
aliphatic carboxyl group of 6-14 carbon atoms and any carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic<br>
carboxyl group of 3-8 carbon atoms containing up to one atom each of the group 8, N, and O in<br>
the heterocyclic ring,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is noted that the amino acid residues from 30 through 44 of the native GH-RH molecule<br>
do not appear to be essential to activity; nor does their identity appear to be critical Therefore, it<br>
appears that the addition of some or all of these further amino acid residues to the C-terminus of<br>
the hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 and hGH-RH(1-30)NH2 analogs of the present invention will not affect the<br>
efficacy of these analogs as GH-RH antagonists. If some or all of these amino acids were added<br>
to the C-terminus of the hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 analogs, the added amino acid residues could be the<br>
same as residues 30 through 44 in the native hGH-RH sequence or reasonable equivalents.<br><br>
Synthetic Methods,<br>
The synthetic peptides are synthesized by a suitable method such as by exclusive solid<br>
phase techniques, by partial solid-phase techniques, by fragment condensation or by classical<br>
solution phase synthesis.<br>
When the analogs of this invention are synthesized by solid-phase method, the C-terminus<br>
residue (here, A29 or A30) is appropriately linked (anchored) to an inert solid support (resin) while<br>
bearing protecting groups for its alpha amino group (and, where appropriate, for its side chain<br>
functional group). After completion of this step, the alpha amino protecting group is removed from<br>
the anchored amino acid residue and the next amino acid residue, A28 or A28 respectively, is added<br>
having its alpha amino group (as well as any appropriate side chain functional group) suitably<br>
protected, and so forth. The N-terminus protecting groups are removed after each residue is<br>
added, but the side chain protecting groups are not yet removed. After all the desired amino acids<br>
have been linked in the proper sequence, the peptide is cleaved from the support and freed from<br>
all side chain protecting group(s) under conditions that are minimally destructive towards residues<br>
in the sequence. This is be followed by a careful purification and scrupulous characterization of<br>
the synthetic product, so as to ensure that the desired structure is indeed the one obtained.<br>
It is particularly preferred to protect the alpha amino function of the amino acids during the<br>
coupling step with an acid or base sensitive protecting group. Such protecting groups should have<br>
me properties of being stable in the conditions of peptide linkage formation, while being readily<br>
removable without destruction of the growing peptide chain and without racemization of any of the<br>
chirai centers contained therein. Suitable alpha amino protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc.<br>
Medical Applications.<br>
The hGH-RH antagonist peptides, or salts of these peptides, may be formulated in<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms containing effective amounts thereof and administered to humans or<br>
animals for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. The peptides may-be used to suppress GH levels<br>
i and to treat conditions associated with excessive levels of GH, e.g., diabetic retinopathy and<br>
nephropathy, and acromegaly. Also provided are methods for treating these diseases by<br>
administration of a composition of the invention to an individual needing such treatment The main<br>
uses of GH-RH antagonists are, however, in the field of cancer, for example human cancers of the<br>
lung, prostate, breast, ovary, endometrium, stomach, colon, pancreas, kidney, bone, and brain<br>
where the receptors for GH-RH, IGF-I/IGF-II, or GH are present, and that depend on stimulation by<br>
growth factors such asGH-RH, IGF-I. IGF-H, GH. or VEGF.<br><br>
A. Abbreviations<br>
The nomenclature used to define tine peptides is that specified by the IUPAC-IUB<br>
Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature wherein, in accordance with conventional<br>
representation, the amino group at the N-terminus appears to the left and the carboxyl group at the<br>
C-terminus appears to the right The term "natural amino add" as used herein means one o! the<br>
common, naturally occurring L-amino acids found in naturally occurring proteins: Gly, Ala, Val,<br>
Leu, lie, Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Cys, Met Phe, Tyr, Pro, Trp and His. When the<br>
natural amino acid residue has isomeric forms, it is the L-form of the amino acid that is represented<br>
herein unless otherwise expressly indicated.<br>
Non-coded -amino acids, or amino acid analogues, are also incorporated into the GH-RH<br>
antagonists. ("Non-coded" amino acids are those amino acids which are not among the<br>
approximately 20 natural amino acids found in naturally occurring proteins.) When these non-<br>
coded amino acids, or amino acid analogues, have isomeric forms, it is the L-form of the amino<br>
acid that is represented unless otherwise expressly indicated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
B. The GH-RH Analogs<br>
the hGH-RH analogs of the present invention were designed to increase the antagonistic<br>
effects at the pituitary level, and/or at the tumoral level. Some of these analogs, such as Peptide 4,<br>
Peptide 7. Peptide 21, Peptide 30, Peptide 31, Peptide 37, Peptide 41, Peptide 42, Peptide 62,<br>
Peptide 67, and Peptide 69 possess high endocrine antagonistic potencies, causing a very<br>
effective and long lasting inhibition of the GH release stimulated by hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 in vitro and<br>
in vivo, and exhibit high binding affinities to the pituitary GH-RH receptors. Some analogs, such as<br>
Peptide 4, Peptide 5, Peptide 7, Peptide 11, Peptide 22, Peptide 35, Peptide 36, Peptide 39,<br>
Peptide 41, Peptide 62, Peptide 67, Peptide 69, Peptide 70, Peptide 72, Peptide 76, Peptide 77,<br>
Peptide 79, Peptide 80, Peptide 86, Peptide 95, Peptide 96, and Peptide 97, show elevated tumor<br>
inhibitory potencies and display extremely high binding affinities to the tumoral receptors for GH-<br>
RH. The peptides of the present invention were also designed to improve their chemical and<br>
metabolic stabilities.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The peptides are synthesized by suitable methods such as by exclusive solid phase<br>
techniques, by partial solid-phase techniques, by fragment condensation or by classical solution<br>
phase synthesis. For example, the techniques of exclusive solid-phase synthesis are set forth in<br>
the textBoc k "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", J.M. Stewart and J.D. Young, Pierce Chem.<br>
Company, Rockford, Illinois, 1984 (2nd. ed.), and M. Bodanszky, "Principles of Peptide Synthesis",<br>
Springer Veriag, 1984. The hGH-RH antagonist peptides are preferably prepared using solid<br>
phase synthesis, such as that generally described by Merrifield, J.Am.Chem.Soc., 85 p. 2149<br>
(1963), although other equivalent chemical syntheses known in the art can also be used as<br>
previously mentioned.<br>
The synthesis is carried out with amino acids that are protected at their alpha amino group.<br>
Urethane type protecting groups (Boc or Fmoc) are preferably used for the protection of the alpha<br>
amino group.<br>
In solid phase synthesis, the N-alpha-protected amino acid moiety which forms the<br>
aminoacy) group of the final peptide at the C-terminus is attached to a polymeric resin support via<br>
a chemical link. After completion of the coupling reaction, the alpha amino protecting group is<br>
selectively removed to allow subsequent coupling reactions to take place at the amino-terminus,<br>
preferably with 50% TFA in DCM when the N-alpha-protecting group is Boc, or by 20% piperidine<br>
in DMF when the N-alpha-protecting group is Fmoc. The remaining amino acids with similarly Boc<br>
or Fmoc-protected alpha amino groups are coupled stepwise to the free amino group of the<br>
preceding amino acid on the resin to obtain the desired peptide sequence. Because the amino .<br>
acid residues are coupled to the alpha amino group of the C-terminus residue, growth of the<br>
synthetic hGH-RH analogue peptides beGlns at the C terminus and progresses toward the N-<br>
terminus. When the desired sequence has been obtained, the peptide is acylated at the N-<br>
terminus, and it is removed from the support polymer.<br>
Each protected amino acid is used in excess (2.5 or 3 equivalents) and the coupling<br>
reactions are usually carried out in DCM, DMF or mixtures thereof. The extent of completion of the<br>
coupling reaction is monitored at each stage by the ninhydrin reaction. In cases where incomplete<br>
coupling is determined, the coupling procedure is repeated, or a capping by acetylation of<br>
unreacted amino groups is carried out, before removal of the alpha amino protecting group prior to<br>
the coupling of the next amino acid.<br>
Typical synthesis cycles are shown in Table I and Table II<br><br><br><br><br>
After completion of the synthesis, the cleavage of the peptide from the resin can be<br>
effected using procedures well known in peptide chemistry.<br>
2.	Choice of the Support Polymer<br>
The hGH-RH antagonist peptides may be synthesized on a variety of support polymers,<br>
i.e. MBHA, Merrifield, PAM, Rink amide or Wang resins. The peptides can also be synthesized on<br>
aminomethyl, MBHA, or other resins that have been previously derivatzed with suitable linkers.<br>
Examples of such linkers are the base-labile 4-hydroxymethyl benzoic acid (HMBA) linker for the<br>
attachment of C-terminal carboxyl groups or the acid-labile para-sulfonyl-phenoxyacetyl (SPA)<br>
linker which permits the attachment of agmatine through its guanidino group.<br>
When peptides with an amidated C-terminus are synthesized by using Boc strategy, the<br>
preferred resin is MBHA. Attachment of the C-terminal amino acid to this resin can be<br>
accomplished by the standard DIC-mediated coupling method described in Table I.<br>
In order to prepare peptides with a C-terminal ethylamide (-NHEt) modification, the<br>
Merrifield resin or HMBA-MBHA resin can be used in conjunction with the Boc strategy. Loading of<br>
the C-terminal amino acid onto the Merrifield resin is done by coupling mediated by potassium<br>
fluoride (KF) or cesium salt at elevated temperature.<br>
For the synthesis of peptide having Agm at the C-terminus, it is preferred that the support<br>
resin. The guanidinocgroup of BocrAgm is Joined to the<br>
support polymer through a stable, but readily cleavable linker such as the para-sulfonyl-<br>
pnenoxyacetyl (SPA) moiety. The alpha-amino-Boc-protected Agm is reacted with the<br>
chlorosutfonyl phenoxyacetic acid Cl-SO2-C5-O-CH2-COOH to form Boc-Agm-SO2 -C6H4-O-CH2-<br>
COOK This compound is then coupled to the support polymer e.g. to MBHA resin using DiC or<br>
HBTU-HOBt-DlEA as activating reagent to yield Boc-Agm-SPA-MBHA.<br>
3.	Amino Acid Derivatives Used<br>
Bifunctional amino acids, i.a those not having side chain functional groups, are mostly<br>
used in the form of their N-alpha Boc- or Fmoc- derivatives for synthesis. Thus, Boc-Gly-OH or<br>
Fmoc-Gly-OH is typically used for incorporating the Gly residue. The naturally occurring<br><br>
bifunctional amino acids are Gly, Ala,- Vai, Leu, lle, Phe, and Pro, and some well-known non-coded<br>
bifunctional amino acids used in this invention are Abu, Alb, and Nle.<br>
Some of the amino acid residues of the peptides have side chain functional groups which<br>
are reactive with reagents used in coupling or deprotection. When such side chain groups are<br>
present, suitable protecting groups are joined to these functional groups to prevent undesirable<br>
chemical reactions occurring during the reactions used to form the peptides. The following general<br>
rules are followed in selecting a particular side chain protecting group: (a) the protecting group<br>
preferably retains its protecting properties and is not split off under coupling conditions, (b) the<br>
protecting group should be stable under conditions for removing the alpha amino protecting group<br>
at each step of the synthesis, (c) the side chain protecting group must be removable upon the<br>
completion of the synthesis of the desired amino acid sequence, under reaction conditions that will<br>
not undesirably alter the peptide chain.<br>
When Boc-amino acids are used in the synthesis, the reactive side chain functional groups<br>
can be protected as follows: Tos or nitro (NO2) for Arg and Har; cHx or Fm for Asp and Glu; Bom<br>
for His; 2CIZ or Fmoc for Lys and Om; Bzl for Ser and Thr; For for Trp; and 2BrZ forTyr. The side<br>
chains of Asn and Gln are unprotected. In the case of Fmoc synthesis, the reactive side chain<br>
functional groups can be protected by other appropriate protective groups as follows: 2,2,4,6,7-<br>
pentamethyl-dihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) or bis-Boc for Arg and Har, tert-butyl (tBu) for<br>
Asp and Glu; no protective group or trityl (Trt) protection for Asn and Gln; Trt for His; Boc or 4-<br>
methoxytrityl (Mmt) for Lys and Om; tBu or Trt for Ser and Thr; Boc for Trp; and tBu or 2-<br>
chlorotrityl (2Cmt) for Tyr.<br>
In addition to the widely known coded and non-coded amino acids mentioned above, some<br>
of the peptides of this application contain less common non-coded amino acids such as para-<br>
amidino-phenylalanine (Amp); para-guanidino-phenylalanine (Gup); cyclohexylalanine (Cha);<br>
1,2,3,4 -tetrahydronorhanman-3-carboxyclic acid (Tpi); (2-naphthyl)alanine (2-Nal); (3.3-<br>
diphenyl)alenine ;(Dip);' para-amine-phenylanine[ Phe(pNH2)]; para-nitro-phenylalanine<br>
[Phe(pNO2)]; (3-pyridyl)alanine (3-Pal); O-ethyl-tyrosine fTyr(Et)]; and para-benzoyl-phenylalanine<br>
(Bpa). These amino acid residues are incorporated into the peptides by coupling the suitable<br>
protected amino acid derivatives. A non-exclusive list of such protected amino acid derivatives that<br>
can be used is as follows: Bcc-Amp(Alloc)-OH, Boc-Amp-OH. Fmoc-Amp(Alloc)-OH. Fmoc-Amp-<br>
OH, Boc-Gup(Tos)-OH, Boc-Gup-OH, Fmoc-Gup(Boc)2-OH, Fmoc-Gup-OH, Boc-Cha-OH, Boc-<br>
Tpi-OH, Boc-2-Nal-OH, Boc-Dip-OH, Boc-Phe(pNH-Z)-OH, Boc-Phe(pNO2)-OH, Boc-3-Pal-OH,<br>
Boc-Tyr(Et)-OH, and Boc-Bpa-OH. The protected derivatives of noncoded amino acids mentioned<br>
above are commonly available from several commercial suppllers, including Bachem (King of<br>
Prussia, PA), Peptides International (Louisville, KY), Novabiochem (San Diego, CA), Advanced<br>
ChemTech (LouisvPle, KY), and RSP Amino Acid Analogues DBA (Worcester, MA).<br><br>
4.	Stepwise Coupling of Amino Acid Residues<br>
Utilizing the above mentioned support polymers and after loading of the C-terminal amino<br>
acid or Agm residue, the peptide itself may suitably be built up by solid phase synthesis in the<br>
conventional manner. Each protected amino acid is coupled in about a three-fold molar excess,<br>
with respect to resin-bound free amino residues, and the coupling may be carried out in a medium<br>
such as DMF—DCM (1:1) or in DMF or DCM alone. The selection of an appropriate coupling<br>
reagent is within the skill of the art. Particularly suitable as coupling reagents are N,N'-diisopropyl<br>
carbodiimide (QIC), or HBTU combined with HOBt in the presence of DIEA The success of the<br>
coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis is preferably monitored by the ninhydrin reaction.<br>
in cases where incomplete coupling occurs, either the coupling procedure is repeated, or the resin-<br>
bdund unreacted amino residues are acetylated using a capping reagent, before removal of the<br>
alpha amino protecting group. Suitable capping reagents are 1-acetylimidazole and Ac2O—<br>
pyridine.<br>
Final acylation of the N-terminus of the peptide with mondcarboxylic acids is done in the<br>
same way as the previous couplings, with the difference that the appropriate carboxylic acid is<br>
used instead of an amino acid. When dicarboxylic acids are attached to the N-terminus and it is<br>
desired that only one -COOH group reacts with the amino terminus of the peptide (that is,<br>
monoamides of these acids are prepared), the anhydrides of the respective dicarboxylic acids can<br>
be used for coupling. The cyclic anhydrides of many dicarboxylic acids are commercially available;<br>
in other cases the pre-formed anhydrides of these acids are prepared by treatment with D1C and<br>
used for coupling.<br>
5.	Cleavage of the Peptide from the Support Polymer and Removal of the Side-Chain Protecting<br>
Groups<br>
When the synthesis is complete, the peptide is cleaved from the support phase and its<br>
In cases where peptides with an amidated C-terminus (-CONH2) or with a C-terminal<br>
carboxyl group (-COOH) are prepared by Boc strategy on an MBHA, Merrifield, or PAM resin, the<br>
removal of the peptide from the resin is performed by treatment with a reagent such as liquid<br>
hydrogen fluoride (HF). This is also the case for peptides synthesized on the Boc-Agm-SPA-MBHA<br>
resin, in some instances, the liquid HF also cleaves all the remaining side chain protecting groups.<br>
However, if side chain protecting groups resistant to HF treatment are present on the peptide,<br>
additional cleavage steps should be performed in order to remove these protecting groups. Thus,<br>
Fm and Fmoc protecting groups are removed by treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF, while All<br>
and Alloc groups are removed by treatment with Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst and nucleophllic scavengers,<br>
prior to or after the HF treatment<br><br>
Suitably, the dried and protected peptide-resjn is treated with a mixture consisting of 1.0<br>
ml m-cresol and 10 ml anhydrous hydrogen fluoride per gram of peptide-resin for 60-120 min at<br>
0°C to cleave the peptide from the resin as well as to remove the HF-labite side chain protecting<br>
groups. After the removal of the hydrogen fluoride under a stream of nitrogen and vacuum, the<br>
free peptides are predpitated with ether, filtered, washed with ether and ethyl acetate, extracted<br>
with 50% acetic acid, and lyophilized.<br>
In cases where peptides with an ethylamide (-NHEt) Otermfrius are prepared by Sec<br>
strategy on the Merrifield or HMSA-MBHA resin, the protected peptides are first cleaved horn the<br>
resin by ethytemine (EtNH2) mediated aminolysls. Suitably, liquid EtNH2 is transferred into a<br>
cooled, heavy-walled glass ftask that contains the dried and protected peptide-resin. The quantity<br>
of liquid EtNH2 should be sufficient to cover the peptide-resin. The flask is stoppered, and shaken<br>
with the liquid EtNH2 for 3.5 hours at room temperature in order to allow for the reaction to take<br>
place. After this, the flask is cooled In a dry ice bath, opened, and the liquid EtNH2 is filtered off the<br>
solid residue that contains a mixture of resin and cleaved peptide, the peptide still having the<br>
protecting groups attached. The solid residue is dried and subjected to HF treatment as described<br>
above in order to remove the side chaln.protecting groups of the peptide.<br>
6, Purification<br>
The purification of the crude peptides can be effected using procedures well known in<br>
peptide chemistry.  For example, purification may be performed on a MacRabbit HPLC system<br>
(Rainin Instrument Co. inc., Wobum, MA) with a Knauer UV Photometer and a Kipp and Zonen<br>
8040 Recorder using a Vydac 218TP510 reversed-phase column (10 x250 mm, packed with C18<br>
silica gel, 300 A pore size, 5 μm particle size) (The Separations Group inc., Hesperia. CA). The<br>
column is eluted with a solvent system consisting of (A) 0.1% aqueous TFA and (B) 0,1% TFA in<br>
70% aqueous MeCN in a linear gradient mpde (e.g, 30-55% B in 120 mm).  The eluent is<br>
monitored at 220 nm, and fractions are examined by analytical HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard<br>
Model HP-1090 liquid chromatograoh and pooled to give maximum purity. Analytical HPIC is<br>
canied out on a Vydac 218TP52 reversed-phase column (2 x 260 mm, C18,300 A, 5 μm) using<br>
isocratic elution with a solvent system consisting of (A) and (B) defined above. The peaks are<br>
monitored at 220 and 280 nm.  The peptides are Judged to be substantially (&gt;96%) pure by<br>
analytical HPLC. Molecular masses are checked by etectrospray mass spectrometry, and the<br>
expected amino acid compositions are confirmed by amino add analysis.<br>
D. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Mode of ministration<br>
The peptides of the Invention may be administered in the form of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, nontoxic salts, such as add addition salts, illustrative of such add addition salts are<br><br>
hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, fumarate, gluconate, tannate, maleate, acetate,<br>
trifluoroacetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, alGlnate, pamoate, malate, ascorbate, tartarate, and<br>
the like. Particularly preferred antagonists are salts of low solubility, e.g., pamoate salts and the<br>
like. These exhibit long duration of activity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are suitably administered to subject humans or<br>
animals subcutaneously (s.c), intramuscularly (i.m.), or intravenously (i.v); intranasally or by<br>
pulmonary inhalation; by transdermal delivery; or in a depot form (e.g., microcapsules,<br>
microgranules, or cylindrical rod like implants) formulated from a biodegradable suitable polymer<br>
(such as D,L-lactide-coglycolide), the former two depot modes being preferred. Other equivalent<br>
modes of administration are also within the scope of this invention, i.e., continuous drip, cutaneous<br>
patches, depot injections, infusion pump and time release modes such as microcapsules and the<br>
like. Administration is in any physiologically acceptable injectable carrier, physiological saline being<br>
acceptable, though other carriers known to the art may also be used.<br>
The peptides are preferably administered parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or<br>
intravenously with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as isotonic saline. Alternatively, the<br>
peptides may be administered as an Intranasal spray with an appropriate carrier or by pulmonary<br>
inhalation. One suitable route of administration is a depot form formulated from a biodegradable<br>
suitable polymer, e.g., poly-D.L-lactide-coglycolide as microcapsules, microgranules or cylindrical<br>
implants containing dispersed antagonistic compounds.<br>
The amount of peptide needed depends on the type of pharmaceutical composition and on<br>
the mode of administration. In cases where human subjects receive solutions of GH-RH<br>
antagonists, administered by i.m. or s.c. injection, or in the form of intranasal spray or pulmonary<br>
inhalation, the typical doses are between 2-20 mg/day/patient, given once a day or divided into 2-4<br>
administrations/day. When the GH-RH antagonists are administered intravenously to human<br>
patients, typical doses are in the range of 8-80 μg/kg of body weight/day, divided into 1-4 bolus<br>
injecyionc/day or given as a continous infusion.When depot preparations of the GH-RH<br>
antagonists are used, e.g by i.m: injection of pamoate salts or other salts of low solubility, or by<br>
i.m. or s.c. administration of microcapsules, microgranules, or implants containing the antagonistic<br>
compounds dispersed in a biodegradable polymer, the typical doses, are between 1-10 mg<br>
antagonist/day/patient<br>
E. Therapeutic Uses of GH-RH Antagonists<br>
The most important therapeutic applications of GH-RH antagonists are expected to be in<br>
the field of oncology and endocrinology. Some of the GH-RH antagonists act predominantly at the<br>
pituitary level and have stronger endocrine effects, inhibiting the GH-RH-evoked GH release, and<br>
ultimately decreasing the serum levels of GH and IGF-I. Other GH-RH antagonists act<br><br>
predominantly at the tumor level, by blocking the tumoral receptors for GH-RH, reducing the<br>
production of various autocrine/paracrine tumor growth factors (such as IGF-I, IGF-II, 6H, VEGF,<br>
FGF) and/or downregulating their receptors, and thus exert stronger inhibitory effects on tumor<br>
growth. These antagonists can also be used as carrier systems linked to radionuclides for tumor<br>
localization or therapy, or conjugated to cbemotherapeutic agents or toxins. Such hybrid<br>
compounds can be actively targeted to cancer for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Yet other<br>
GH-RH antagonists act by multiple mechanisms of action, that is by endocrine mechanisms and by<br>
direct effects on tumors at the same time. Thus, the main therapeutic indications of various GH-RH<br>
antagonists differ based on their preferential mechanism of action.<br>
Analogs of GH-RH with antagonistic action on the pituitary can be used in situations where<br>
it is beneficial to suppress serum levels of GH and IGF-I. Thus they are indicated for the therapy of<br>
cadocrine disorders characterized by excessive production of GH and IGF-I, as well as for the<br>
treatment of cancers that express receptors for IGF-I, IGF-II, or GH, and the proliferation of which<br>
is stimulated by these growth factors.<br>
Somatostatin analogs and GH antagonists are also available for the treatment of<br>
endocrine conditions caused by GH and IGF-I. However, GH-RH antagonists offer unique<br>
therapeutical benefits unobtainable by the use of somatostatin analogs and GH antagonists. These<br>
 benefits are due to the multiple mechanisms of action of GH-RH antagonists, namely that they<br>
exert GH- and IGF-l-independent direct effects on tumors and other target sites, in addition to<br>
inhibiting the endocrine axis for GH and IGF-I. GH-RH antagonists may be given alone or together<br>
with somatostatin analogs, a combination which more completely suppresses GH and IGF-I levels.<br>
An undesired side-effect of GH antagonists, which can be avoided by the administration of GH-RH<br>
antagonists, is the elevation of serum GH levels through a feed-back mechanism.<br>
One disease caused by excess growth hormone is acromegaly, which is manifested in an<br>
abnormal enlargement of the bones of the. face and extremities. GH-RH antagonists could alleviate<br>
the, clinical manifestation of acromegaly, e,g. the enlargement of facial and extremity bones, the<br>
enlargement of heart,and other structural and functional abnormalities of the cardiovascular<br>
system. The GH-RH antagonists may also be used to treat diabetic retinopathy (the main cause of<br>
blindness in diabetics) and diabetic nephropathy, in which damage to the eye and kidney<br>
respectively is thought to be due to GH. Diabetic patients can also benefit from the increased<br>
insulin sensitivity produced by GH-RH antagonists, an effect linked to the ability of these<br>
J compounds to reduce the GH and IGF-I levels. In addition, since they inhibit GH release, GH-RH<br>
antagonists can be used to slow down the progression of muscular dystrophy.<br>
Drugs with anti-growth factor properties such as GH-RH antagonists can also be of benefit<br>
in controlling or slowing down the progression of some clinicopathologic processes in conditions<br>
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where<br><br>
the present medical therapies have relatively little to offer. In addition, no drug therapy has been<br>
shown to be effective in decreasing the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal<br>
coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and new approaches must be devised, including the use of GH-RH<br>
antagonists. Some gynecologic conditions, such as myoma, endometriosis, and polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome, can also be treated with GH-RH antagonists in combination with luteinizing hormone-<br>
releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists or antagonists. GH-RH antagonists are also available for<br>
treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hyperplastic and benign proliferative<br>
disorders of other normal organs in which the GH-RH receptors are present<br>
However, the main applications of GH-RH antagonists are in the field of cancer. GH-RH<br>
antagonists, especially those with strong direct effects at the tumor level, are indicated for the<br>
inhibition of growth of primary tumors and for the suppression of their metastatic spread. Since the<br>
antiproliferative effects of GH-RH antagonists are exerted by several mechanisms, these<br>
compounds are available for the treatment of a large variety of cancers, -such as those that depend<br>
on autocrine/paracrine and endocrine stimulation by GH-RH, IGF-I, IGF-II, GH, VEGF, and FGF.<br>
GH-RH antagonists are available for the treatment of tumors that express GH-RH<br>
receptors and use GH-RH as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor. Such malignancies include,<br>
but are not limited to, cancers of the lung, prostate, breast, ovary, endometrium, stomach,<br>
intestine, pancreas, kidney, bone, liver, as well as glioblastomas, pheochromocytomas,<br>
melanomas, and lymphomas. By blocking the tumoral receptors for 6H-RH, these antagonists<br>
prevent the stimulatory action of GH-RH, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth.<br>
One advantage of GH-RH antagonists over somatostatin analogs is based on the fact that<br>
GH-RH antagonists may be utilized for suppression of tumors which do not have somatostatin<br>
receptors but express the tumoral receptors for GH-RH, for example human osteogenic sarcomas.<br>
Malignancies that express the IGF-I receptors, and depend on IGF-) and/or IGF-II as<br>
growth factors,are available for therapy with GH-RH antagonists. These malignancies include,<br>
among others, lung cancers, prostatic, breast ovarian, endometrial, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic,<br>
renal, and hepatic cancers, sarcomas, and brain tumors. The ability of GH-RH antagonists to<br>
decrease serum IGF-l levels, inhibit the autocrine/paracrine production of IGF-I and/or IGF-II in the<br>
tumor tissue, and downregulate the expression level of IGF-I receptor, is beneficial for cancer<br>
therapy.<br>
Breast cancers and other types of cancer that depend on GH as a growth factor, can be<br>
treated with GH-RH antagonists. The ability of GH-RH antagonists to reduce serum GH levels,<br>
inhibit the autocrine production of GH, and downregulate GH receptor expression, beneficiate the<br>
treatment of certain breast cancers and other types of tumors as well.<br><br>
GH-RH antagonists are available as Inhibitors of angjogenesis, in view of their inhibitory<br>
activity on the synthesis of VEGF by tumor tissues and normal endothelial cells, and considering<br>
their antiproliferative effect on endothelial cells. Thus GH-RH antagonists could be beneficial for<br>
the treatment of those tumors that strongly depend on VEGF and neoangiogenesis.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is described in connection with the following examples which are set<br>
forth for the purposes of illustration only. In the examples, optically active protected amino acids in<br>
the L-configuration are used except where specifically noted.<br>
The following Examples set forth suitable methods of synthesizing the novel GH-RH<br>
antagonists by the solid-phase technique.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br><br>
The synthesis is conducted in a stepwise manner using manual solid phase peptide<br>
synthesis equipment Briefly, para-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (Bachem, King of<br>
Prussia, PA) (720 mg, 0.50 mmol) is neutralized with 5% DIEA in DCM and washed according to<br>
the protocol described in Table I. The solution of Boc-Har(NO2)-OH (500 mg, 1.5 mmol) in DMF-<br>
DCM (1:1) is shaken with the neutralized resin and DIC (235 μL, 1.5 mmol) in a manual solid<br>
phase peptide synthesis apparatus for 1 hour. After the completion of the coupling reaction is<br>
proved by negative ninhydrin test, the deprotection and neutralizatibn protocols described ip Table<br>
are performed in order to remove the Boc protecting group and prepare the peptide-resin for<br>
coupling of the next amino acid. The synthesis is continued and the peptide chain is built stepwise<br>
by coupling the following protected amino acids in the indicated order on the resin to obtain the<br><br>
These protected amino acid residues (also commonly available from Bachem) are.<br>
represented above according to a well accepted convention. The suitable protecting group for the<br><br>
side chain functional group of particular amino acids appears in parentheses. The OH groups in<br>
the above formulae indicate that the carboxyl terminus of each residue is free.<br>
The protected amino acids (1.5 mmol each) are coupled with DIC (235 μL, 1.5 mmol) with<br>
the exceptions of Boc-Asn-OH and Boc-Gln-OH which are coupled with their preformed HOBt<br>
esters. After removal of the N°-Boc protecting group from Tyr\ the peptide is acylated overnight<br>
with octanoic acid [CH3(CH2)6COOH] (475 μL, 3 mmol) using DIC (235 μL, 1.5 mmol) as a coupling<br>
agent<br>
In order to cleave the peptide from the resin and deprotect it, a portion of 130 mg of the<br>
dried peptide resin is stirred with 0.5 mL m-cresol and 5 mL hydrogen fluoride (HF) at 0 °C for 2<br>
hours. After evaporation of the HF under a stream of nitrogen and in vacuo, the residue is Washed<br>
with dry diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is dissolved in 50%<br>
acetic acid and separated from the resin by filtration. After dilution with water and lyophilization, 75<br>
mg crude product is obtained.<br>
The crude peptide is checked by analytical HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard Model HP-1090<br>
liquid chromatograph with a Supelco Discovery HS C18 reversed-phase column (2.1 mm x 5 cm,<br>
packed with C18 silica gel, 120 A pore size, 3 μm particle size) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and<br>
linear gradient elution (e.g., 40-70% B), with a solvent system consisting of (A) 0.1% aqueous TFA<br>
and (B) 0.1% TFA in 70% aqueous MeCN. For purification by semipreparative HPLC, 75 mg of<br>
crude peptide is dissolved in AcOH/H`2O, stirred, filtered and applied on a Beckman Ultraprep ODS<br>
column (21.2 mm x 15 cm, packed with C18 silica gel, 300 A pore size, 10 pm particle size). The<br>
column is eluted with a solvent system described above in a linear gradient mode (e.g., 40-60% B<br>
in 120 min); flow rate 10. mL/min. The eluent is monitored at 220 nm, and fractions are examined<br>
by analytical HPLC. Fractions with purity higher than 95% are pooled and lyophilized to give 7.7<br>
mg pure product The analytical HPLC is carried out on a Supelco C18 reversed-phase column<br>
described above using isocratic elution with a solvent system described above with a flow rate of<br>

The synthesis is conducted in a stepwise manner using manual solid phase peptide synthesis<br>
equipment Briefly, MBHA resin (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) (720 mg, 0.50 mmol) is neutralized<br>
with 5% DIEA in DCM and washed according to the protocol described in Table I. The solution of<br>
Boc-Har(NO2)-OH (500 mg, 1.5 mmol) in OMF-DCM (1:1) is shaken with the neutralized resin and<br><br>
OIC (235 μL, 1.5 mmol) in a manual solid phase peptide synthesis apparatus for 1 hour. After the<br>
completion of the coupling reaction is proved by negative ninhydrin test, the deprotection and<br>
neutralization protocols described in Table I are performed in order to remove the Boc protecting<br>
group and prepare the peptkte-resIn for coupling of the next amino acid. The synthesis is<br>
continued and the peptide chain is built stepwise by coupling the following protected amino acids in<br>
each) are coupled with DIC (235 uL, 1.5 MMOl) with the exceptions of Boc-Asn-OH and Bbc-Gln-<br>
OH which are coupled with their preformed HOBt esters.<br>
After removal of the Nα-Boc protecting group from Tyr1 the peptide is acylated with the<br>
pre-formed symmetrical anhydride of 1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic acid which is prepared as follows.<br>
For synthesis on the scale of 0.5 mrnol peptide, 388 mg (1.5 mrnol) 1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic<br>
acid [HOOC(CH2)12COOH] is dissolved in 5 to10 ml of DMF-DCM (1:1), 235 μL (1.5 mrnol) DIC is<br>
added to this solution, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. After<br>
this period of time, the mixture is transferred into the synthesis vessel containing the peptide-resin<br>
with a free amino terminus on Tyr1, and acylation is carried out overnight<br>
In order to cleave the peptide from the resin and deprotect it, a portion of 274 mg of the<br>
dried peptide resin is stirred with 0.5 mL m-cresol and 5 mL hydrogen fluoride (HF) at 0 °C for 2<br>
hours. • After evaporation of the HF under a stream of nitrogen and In vacuo, the residue is washed<br>
with dry diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is dissolved in 50 %<br>
acetic acid and separated from the resin by filtration. After dilution with water and lyophilization,<br>
160 mg crude product is obtained.<br>
The crude peptide is checked by analytical HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard Model HP-1090<br>
liquid chromatograph with a Supeico Discovery HS C18 reversed-phase column (2.1 mm x 5 cm,<br>
packed with C18 silica gel, 120 A pore size, 3 μm particle size) (Supelco, Belleforite, PA) and<br>
linear gradient elution (e.g., 50-80% B), with a solvent system consisting of (A) 0.1% aqueous TFA<br>
and (B) 0.1% TFA in 70% aqueous MeCN. For purification by semipreparative HPLC, 160 mg of<br>
crude peptide is dissolved in AcOH/H2O, stirred, filtered and applied on a Beckman Ultraprep ODS<br>
column (21.2 mm x 15 cm, packed with C18 silica gel, 300 A pore size, 10 μm particle size). The<br>
column is eluted with a solvent system described above in a linear gradient mode (e.g., 50-70% B<br>
in 120 min); flow rate 10 mL/min. The eluent is monitored at 220 nm, and fractions are examined<br>
by analytical HPLC. Fractions with purity higher than 95% are pooled and lyophilized to give 6.0<br>

described above using isocratic elution with a solvent system described above with a flow rate of<br>
0.2 mL/min. The peaks are monitored at 220 and 280 nm. The product is judged to be<br><br>

The synthesis is conducted in a stepwise manner using manual solid phase peptide<br>
synthesis equipment Briefly, para-methylbenzhydryiamine (MBHA) resin (Bachem, King of<br>
Prussia, PA) (720 mg, 0.50 mmol) is neutralized with 5% DIEA in DCM and washed according to<br>
the protocol described in Table I. The solution of Boc-Har(NO2)-OH (500 mg, 1.5 mmol) in DMF-<br>
DCM (1:1) is shaken with the neutralized resin and DIC (235 pL, 1.5 mmol) In a manual solid<br>
phase peptide synthesis apparatus for 1 hour. After the completion of the coupling reaction is<br>
proved by negative ninhydrin test, the deprotection and neutralization protocols described in Table<br>
are performed in order to remove the Boc protecting group and prepare the peptide-resin for<br>
coupling of the next amino acid. The synthesis is continued and the peptide chain is built stepwise<br>
by coupling the following protected amino acids in the indicated order on the resin to obtain the<br><br>
Tyr(2BrZ)-OH. The protected, noncoded amino acid Boc-Amp(Alloc)-OH is commercially available<br>
from RSP Amino Acid Analogues, Inc. (Worcester, MA). The protected amino acids (1.5 mmol<br>
each) are coupled with DIC (235 μL, 1.5 mmol), with the exceptions of Boc-Amp(Alloc)-OH, Boc-<br>
Asn-OH and Boc -Gln-OH which are coupled with 569 mg HBTU + 203 mg HOBt + 522 pL DIEA<br>
(1.5 :1.5: 3 mmol). After removal of the Nα-Boc protecting group from Tyr\ the peptide is acylated<br>
with phenylacetic acid (PhAc-OH) (272 mg, 2 mmol) using DIC (313 μL, 2 mmol). The finished<br>
peptidyl resin, with all the side-chain protecting groups still attached, is washed 3x with DCM, 3x<br>
with MeOH, and dried under high vacuum:<br>
The peptide-resin is then subjected to Pd(0)-catalyzed removal of the Alloc protecting<br>
group from the Amp9 residue of the peptide chain, by using the procedure described in the<br>
Ncnrtibfechaii (San Diego, CA) Catalog 2002/2003. A portion of 255 mg peptidyl resin, with an<br>
estimated peptide content of 0.033 mmol, is weighed into a test tube and the tube is sealed with a<br>
rubber septum. The test tube is flushed with a stream of argon (Ar) gas delivered from a needle<br>
inserted through the septum. 116 mg Pd(PPh3)4 (0.1 mmol, or 3 equiv. felative to the Alloc groups<br>
present on the peptidyl resin) is weighed into another dry test tube, 4-5 mL of CHCl3—AcOH—N-<br>
methyfrnorpholine (372:1 vol:vol:vol) is added, the catalyst is dissolved by bubbling a stream of Ar<br>
through the solution, and the tube is seated with a rubber septum. This solution is transferred using<br>
an Ar flushed gas-tight syringe to the tube containing the resin, and the resulting mixture is left to<br>
stand for 2 hours with an occasional gentle agitation. Next, the resin is transferred to a sintered<br>
glass funnel and washed consecutively with 0.5% DIEA in DMF (to neutralize the resin) and<br><br>
sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (0.5% w/w) in DMF (to remove the catalyst). After another wash<br>
with MeOH, the resin is dried again prior to HF cleavage of the peptide.<br>
Cleavage of the peptide from the MBHA resin with a concomitant removal of the remaining<br>
protecting groups is achieved by HF treatment, as described in Examples l-III. Subsequent work-<br>
up and HPLC purification, performed as described in Examples I-III, yields 11.6 mg of pure Peptide<br>
67v (&gt;95% purity by analytical HPLC). Molecular mass is checked by electrospray mass<br>
spectrometry, and the expected amino acid composition is confirmed by amino acid analysis.<br>
Peptide 30, Peptide 31, Peptide 64, Peptide 68, Peptide 73, Peptide 74, and Peptide 75<br>

The synthesis is conducted in a stepwise manner using manual solid phase peptide<br>
synthesis equipment Briefly, Merrifield resin (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) (3.0 g, with a<br>
substitution of 0.6 mmol/g) is pre-swollen in DCM, washed 3x times with DMF, then a solution of<br>
2390 mg Boc -Har(Tos)-OH (5.4 mmol, corresponding to 3x molar excess) in 20-30 mL DMF and<br>
314 mg solid KF (5.4 mmol, 3x molar excess) is added, in order to load the first amino acid onto<br>
the resin. The resin is shaken with the above mixture for 4 hours at 80 °C, and then the resin is<br>
filtered and washed as follows: 3x DMF, 3x DMF-water (1:1) (to remove the KF), 3x DMF, 3x DCM,<br>
and 3x MeOH. The resin is dried in vacuum for 24 hours to reach a constant weight The weight of<br>
the dry resin with the first amino acid loaded [Boc-Har(Tos)-Merrifield resin] exceeds 3.5 g,<br>
indicating that the yield of loading is better than 70%.<br>
I.5g of Boc-Har((Tos)-Merifield resin (approx 0.5 mmol) is pre-swollen in DCM, and after<br>
deprotection with 50%-TFA in DCM and neutralization with 5% DIEA in DCM, the peptide chain is<br>
built stepwise by coupling the following protected amino acids in the indicated order on the resin to<br><br>
since the nitro protected guanidino group is known to be attacked by bases such as ethylamine<br>
used in this synthesis, and partial decomposition of Har to Lys could occur with Boc-Har(NO2)-OH.<br>
The protected amino acids (1.5 mmol each) are coupled with DIC (235 μL, 1.5 mmol) with the<br><br>
exceptions of Boc-Asn-OH and Boc-Gln-OH which are coupled with their preformed HOBt esters.<br>
After removal of the Nα-Boc protecting group from Tyr1, the peptide is acylated with phenyiacetic<br>
acid (PhAc-OH) (272 mg, 2 mmol) using DIC (313 μL, 2 mmol), washed with DCM and MeOH, and<br>
dried.<br>
In order to cleave the protected peptide from the resin by ethylamine (EtNH2) mediated<br>
aminolysis and to obtain it with an ethylamide modification (-NHEt) at the C-terminus, a portion of<br>
250 mg dry peptide resin is added into a round-bottom flask made of heavy-wall glass, the flask is<br>
placed in a dry ice-metbanol cooling bath inside a well-ventillated fume hood, and liquid EtNH2<br>
(b.p.=l6.6 °C, from Aldrich, shipped in metallic cylinder) is transferred into the flask in an amount<br>
sufficient to cover the peptide resin. The flask is stoppered, warmed to room temperature (caution:<br>
pressure develops inside), and shaken for 3 hours and 30 min in order to allow for the reaction to<br>
take place. After this time, the flask is placed again in the cooling bath, opened, and the liquid<br>
EtNH2 is filtered off the solid residue that contains a mixture of resin and cleaved peptide, the<br>
peptide still having the protecting groups attached. After this procedure, the solid residue is<br>
subjected to vacuum overnight to remove any residual EtNH2 and the humidity adsorbed.<br>
The dry residue containing the cleaved, protected peptide is placed in the HF treatment<br>
apparatus and HF cleavage of the protecting groups is performed by treatment with 5 mL HF at 0<br>
°C for 2 hours, in the presence of 0.5 mL m-cresol as scavenger. After evaporation of the HF under<br>
a stream of nitrogen and in vacuo, the residue is washed with dry diethyl ether and ethyl acetate.<br>
The cleaved and deprotected peptide is dissolved in 50 % acetic acid and separated from the resin<br>
by filtration. After dilution with water and lyophilization, 90-110 mg of crude product is typically<br>
obtained.<br>
The peptide is purified by. semipreparative HPLC and the editing fractions are examined by<br>
analytical HPLC as described in Examples I-III- Fractions with purity higher than 95% are pooled<br>
and lyophilized to give 5 to 10 mg of pure Peptide 46. Molecular mass is checked by electrospray<br>

Subsequently, the peptidyl resin is subjected to Pd(0)-catalyzed removal of the Alloc<br>
protecting group from the Amp9 residue of the peptide chain, as. described in Example IV. The<br>
peptide resin is then washed with MeOH and dried, prior to HF cleavage of the peptide.<br>
Cleavage of the peptide from the MBHA resin with a concomitant removal of the remaining<br>
protecting groups is achieved by HF treatment, as described in Examples 1411. Subsequent work-<br>
up and HPLC purification are performed as described in Examples I-III. After HF treatment of 150<br>
mg dry peptidyl resin, 82 mg crude lyophilized peptide is obtained, the HPLC purification of which<br>
yields 2.5 mg pure Peptide 72 (&gt;95% purity by analytical HPLC). Molecular mass is checked by<br>
etectrospray mass spectrometry, and the expected amino acid composition is confirmed by amino<br>
acid analysis.<br>

EXAMPLE XII<br>
Biological Activity in Endocrine and Oncological Assays<br>
The peptides of the present invention were tested in assays in vitro and in vivo for their<br>
ability to inhibit the hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 induced GH release. Binding affinities of the compounds to<br>
the tumoral GH-RH receptors were also measured. The antitumor activities of the peptides and<br>
their inhibitory effects on serum IGF-I and on the tumoral IGF system were evaluated in various<br>
cancer models in vivo.<br>
Superfused Rat Pituitary System<br>
The analogs were tested in vitro in a test described earller (S. Vigh and A.V Schelly,<br>
Peptides 5:241-347,1984) with modification (Z. Rekasi and A.V. Schally, P.N.A.S. 902148-2149,<br>
1993).<br>
Briefly, the cells are preincubated with peptides for 9 minutes (3mL) at various<br>
concentrations. Immediately after the Incubation, 1 nM hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 is administered for 3<br>
minutes (1mL) [0 minute response]. To check the duration of the antagonistic effect of the<br>
analogue, 1 nM hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 is applled 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes later 5for 3 minutes [30,<br>
60, 90, 120 min responses]. Net integral values of the GH responses are evaluated. GH<br>
responses are compared to and expressed as percent of the oriGlnal GH response induced by 1<br><br>
nM GH-RH(1-29)NH2 The effect of the new antagonists are compared to that of [Ac-Tyr1, D-<br>
Arg2]hGH-RH(1-29)NH2, the "Standard antagonist".<br>
Radtoimmunoassays (RIA) forGH, IGF-I, and IGF-H<br>
Rat GH levels in aliquots of undiluted and diluted supervision samples were measured by<br>
double-antibody radioimmunoassay using materials supplled by the National Hormone and<br>
Pituitary Program, Baltimore, Maryland. The results of RIA were analyzed with a computer<br>
program developed in our institute (V. Csernus and A.V. Schally, in Neuroendocrine Research<br>
Methods, Harwood Academic (Greenstein, B.D. ed., London, pp. 71-109, 1991), hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
For the measurement of GH and IGF-I levels in the serum, as well as IGF-I and IGF-lI<br>
concentrations in the cytosol fraction of tumors, blood samples and tumor samples were collected<br>
and processed as described (Braczkowski R, Serially AV, Plonowski A, Varga JL, Groot K, Krupa<br>
M, Armatis P, Cancer 95: 1735-1745, 2002), hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, blood<br>
samples are centrifuged to separate the serum, tumors are homogenized and centrifuged to<br>
separate the cytosol fraction. Serum GH is then measured by the double-antibody RIA method.<br>
Before measurement by RIA, IGF-I and IGF-Il are extracted from serum and cytosol fractions using<br>
an acid-ethanol cryoprecipitation method that eliminates most of the IGF binding proteins, which<br>
can interfere with the RIA IGF-I concentration is measured by RIA using IGF-I as a standard and<br>
goat antHGF-I antibody (both from DSL inc., Webster, TX). IGF-II concentration is measured by<br>
RIA using human recombinant IGF-Il (Bachem) as a standard and anti-IGF-H monoclonal antibody<br>
(Amano international Enzyme, Troy, VA).<br>
In all RIA measurements, inter-assay variation was less than 15% and intra-assay<br>
variation was less than 10%.<br>
Tumoral GH-RH Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Ligand competition assays with 125]-labeled GH-RH antagonist JV-1-42 were used to<br>
determine the binding affinities of GH-RH analogs to the GH-RH receptor isoforms on membrane<br>
fractions of human PC-3 prostate, tumors. The methods used have been described in detail<br>
(Halmos G, Schelly AV, Varga JL, Ptonowski A, Rekasi Z, Czompoly T, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA<br>
97:10555-10560,2000; Halmos G, Serially AV, Czompoly T, Krupa M, Varga JL, Rekasi Z, J Clin<br>
Endocrinol Metab 87: 4707-4714, 2002), hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, radioiodinated<br>
derivatives of JV-1-42 are prepared by the chloramine-T method. PC-3 tumors, grown as<br>
xenografts in nude mice, are used to prepare crude membranes. PC-3 membrane homogenates<br>
are incubated with [125I]JV-1-42 and increasing concentrations (10-12 to 10-6 M) of nonradioactive<br>
antagonist peptides as competitors. The pellet is separated by centrifugation and counted for<br>
radioactivity in a gamma-counter. The final binding affinities are estimated by K, (dissociation<br>
constant of the inhibitor-receptor complex) and are determined by the Ligand PC and McPherson<br>
computer programs of Munson and Rodbard (P.J. Munson and O. Rodbard, Anal. Biochem. 107:<br>
220-239,1980). Relative affinities (RA.) compared to reference peptides such as JV-1-36 or JV-<br><br>
1-38, are calculated as the ratio of K, of the reference peptide to the K, of the tested GH-RH<br>
antagonist<br>
Results of Superfusion Assays<br>
The results of the in vitro antagonistic activities tested in superfused rat pituitary system<br>
are summarized in Table III. As it can be seen from these data, the substitutions present in the<br>
molecules cause a much increased and protracted inhibitory effect on the GH-RH-elicited GH<br>
release in vitro, as compared to the standard antagonist<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Tumor volumes were measured twice a week. The experiment was ended on day 29 by sacrificing<br>
the mice under Isoflurane anesthesia. Resulting tumors were cleaned, weighed, and snap-frozen<br>
until further analyses. Trunk blood was collected from the abdominal aorta and serum was<br>
separated for RIA measurement of IGF-I. Statistical analyses of the measurement results were<br>
done by two-tailed t-test, data are presented as the means ± S.E.<br>
Experiment 2:<br>
Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1, with the difference that Experiment 2 was started when<br>
PC-3 tumors had grown to approximately 30 mm3 in volume. At this time, the animals were divided<br>
into 8 experimental groups with 8 animals in each group, and received single daily injections for 28<br>
days as follows. 1. Control (vehicle solution); 2. JV-1-38 (10 μg/day s.c.); 3. Peptide 46 (5 μg/day;<br>
s.c.); 4. Peptide 77 (5 μg/day s.c.); 5. Peptide 76 (5 μg/day s.c.); 6. Peptide 70 (5 μg/day s.c.); 7.<br>

same as for Experiment 1;<br>
Experiments:<br>
Male nude mice were implanted s.c. with 3 mm3 pieces of PC-3 human hormone-independent<br>
prostate cancer tissue on both flanks. When tumors reached a volume of approximately 65 mm3,<br>
the mice were divided into 7 experimental groups with 8 to 9 animals in each group and received<br>
single daily injections for 28 days as follows: 1. Control (vehicle solution); 2. JV-1-38 (10 μg/day<br>
s.c.); 3. Peptide 35 (10 μg/day s.c.); 4. Peptide 36 (10 μg/day s.c.); 5. Peptide 37 (10 μg/day s.c.);<br>
6. Peptide 38 (10 μg/day s.c.); 7. Peptide 41 (10 μg/day s.c). Tumor volumes were measured<br>
twice a week. The experiment was ended on day 28 by sacrificing the mice under Isoflurane<br>
anesthesia. Resulting tumors were cleaned, weighed, and snap-frozen until further analyses.<br>

All expenmental details of Experiment 4 are the same as for Experiment 3, with the following<br>
difference. When tumors reached a volume of approximately 55 mm3, the mice were divided into 5<br>
experimental groups with 8 to 9 animals in each group and received single daily injections for 28<br>
days as follows: 1. Control (vehicle solution); 2. Peptide 80 (5 μg/day s.c.); 3. Peptide 86 (5 μg/day<br>
s.c.); 4. Peptide 95 (5 μg/day s.c.); 5. Peptide 96 (5 μg/day s.c.). Further details of Experiments<br>
are the same as for Experiment 3.<br>
Results<br>
Experiment 1:<br>
Among the GH-RH antagonists tested, Peptide 67 and Peptide 62 exerted a stronger inhibitory<br>
effect on the growth of PC-3 tumors than the reference peptide JV-1-38, subject to U.S. Patent<br>
6,057,422 (Table VI). The peptides of the present invention also more potently suppressed IGF-I<br>
levels in the serum and IGF-II levels in the tumors, as compared to JV-1-38 (Table VII).<br><br><br><br>
N.I., not investigated.<br>
Experiment 2:<br>
Peptide 46, Peptide 77, Peptide 76, Peptide 70, Peptide 79, and Peptide 80 of the present<br>
invention, used at a dose of 5 μg/day, decreased the tumor volumes and tumor weights! of PC-3<br>
cancers by 20-64%, and increased the tumor volume doubling times by up to 101% of the control<br>
value (Table VIII). The effects of Peptide 77, Peptide 70, Peptide 79, and Peptide 80 were<br>
statistically significant on one or more of these tumor parameters. In contrast, reference peptide<br>
JV-1-38, subject to U.S. Patent 6,057.422, did not decrease the tumor volume, and only caused a<br>
slight and non-significant inhibition of 10% in the weight of PC-3 tumors, when used at a double<br>
dose of 10 μg/day (Table VIII). In addition Peptide 70, Peptide 79, and Peptide 80 of the present<br>
invention significantly decreased serum IGF-I levels by 31%-42%. but peptide JV-1-38 had no<br>
effect (Table IX).<br><br><br><br>
Experiment 3:<br>
All peptides tested significantly inhibited the growth of PCS tumors at the dose of 10 μg/day.<br>
Peptide 35, Peptide 36, and Peptide 39 had more potent antitumor effect than reference peptide<br>
JV-1-38 (Table X).<br><br><br>
Experiment 4:<br>
All four peptides, administered at a dose of 5 μg/day, significantly inhibited the growth of PC-3<br>
tumors in nude mice. Peptide 96 had the strongest antitumor effect in this experiment (Table XI).<br>
Serum IGF-I levels were also inhibit in all group trated with antagonist, the effct of peptide<br>
86 and Peptide 96 being statiscally significant(table XII).<br><br><br><br>

Experiment 4; Effect of Treatment with GH-RH Antagonists on the Serum Levels of IGF-I in Nude<br>
Mice Bearing Xenografts of PC-3 Human Prostate Cancer<br><br>
Effect of GH-RH antagont on HT-29 human colon cancer xenografts in nude mice<br>
HT-29 human colon cancers were transplanted sc. into male nude mice. 19 days after<br>
transplantation, the mice were divided into two groups of 10 animals each, and the treatment was<br>
started. Mice in the treatment group received single daily injections of Peptide 67 sc. at a dose of<br>
10 μg/day for 62 days, while the control group was injected with the vehicle solvent Tumors were<br>
measured regularly, and tumor volume was calculated. The mice were-sacrificed at the end of<br>
experiment and tumor weights were measured.<br>
Results<br>
Treatment with Peptide 67 for 62 days caused a significant inhibition of 56.3% in the<br>
volumes and 53.9% in the weights of HT-29 tumors growing tn nude mice, as compared to the<br>
control group (Table XIII).<br><br><br>
Effect of GH-RH antagonists on DMS-153 human small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) xenografted<br>
info nude mice<br>
Male nude mice were implanted s.c. with 3 mm3 pieces of DMS-153 human SCLC tissue.<br>
When tumors reached a volume of approx. 100 mm3 the mice were divided into 3 experimental<br>
groups of 6-8 animals each and received the following treatment for 6 weeks group 1 (control),<br>
vehicle solution; group 2, Peptide 67 (10 μg/day s.c.); group 3, Peptide 31 (10 μg/day s.c). Tumor<br>
volumes were recorded twice a week. At the end of treatment mice were anesthetized with<br>
isoflurane, killed by decapitation, trunk blood was collected for measurement of serum IGF-I, and<br>
tumors were excised and weighed. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Data were evaluated by<br>
one way ANOVA and the Student-Newman-Keuls test<br>
Results<br>
Tumor weights were significantly decreased in animals that received treatment with either<br>
GH-RH antagonist, Peptide 67 or Peptide 31, as compared to controls (Table XIV). Tumor volumes<br>
were also significantly smaller in the group that received Peptide 67. In addition, both antagonists<br>
significantly reduced the serum levels of IGF-I as compared to those in the control animals (Table<br>
XIV). The expression of mRNA for IGF-II was likewise inhibited by both antagonists, the level of<br>
expression being 100±1.5% in the control group, 78.0*44.3% in the group treated with Peptide 67,<br>
and 42.7±18.5% in the group that received Peptide 31. The inhibitory effect of Peptide 31 on the<br>
IGF-II mRNA expression was statistically significant (p

Effect of GH-RH antagonists on H-69 human SCLC xenografted into nude mice<br>
	Male nude mice were implanted s.c. with 3 mm3 pieces of H-69 human SCLC tissue.<br>
When tumors reached a volume of approx. 80 mm3 the mice were divided into 4 experimental<br>
groups of 7-8 animals each and received the following treatment for 4 weeks: group 1 (control),<br>
vehicle solution; group 2, Peptide 67 (10 μg/day s.c.); group 3, Peptide 31 (10 μg/day s.c.); group<br>
4, Peptide 72 (10 μg/day s.c). Tumor volumes were recorded twice a week. At the end of<br>
treatment mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, killed by decapitation, and tumors were excised<br>
and weighed. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Data were evaluated by one way ANOVA and<br>
the Student-Newman-Keuls test<br>
Results<br>
Alt GH-RH antagonists, given as single dally injection at a dose of 10 μg/day, significantly<br>
inhibited the growth of H-69 tumors in nude mice. Among the compounds tested, Peptide 72 had<br>
the strongest antiproliferative effect (Table XV).<br><br><br><br>
