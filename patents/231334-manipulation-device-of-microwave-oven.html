[Invention Title]<br>
MAN IPULATI ON DEVICE OF MICROWAVE OVEN<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a manipulation device of a microwave oven, and more<br>
particularly, to a control panel of a microwave oven In which coupling structure of a dial knob and an<br>
output adjust ing gear is improved to increase durability.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A microwave oven is a cool ing appliance in which a magnetron converts electrical energy into<br>
microwave and appl ies the microwave to food or other objects to be heated. The microwave oven is<br>
usually placed on a piece of kitchen furniture to use it at the kitchen. Also, a microwave oven<br>
combined with a hood may be p I aced above a gas range to cook the food and exhaust smoke or fumes.<br>
Meanwhile, the users can set or adjust cooking time by rotating a dial knob extended from a<br>
front control panel of the microwave oven.<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a dial knob according to the related art.<br>
Refer r ing to Fig. 1, a dial knob 20 is mounted on a control panel 40 of a microwave oven.<br>
The dial knob 20 has a circular barrel shape and includes acoupl ing shaft 22 extending from<br>
an inner center with a predetermined length. The coupl ing shaft 22 is to be coupled with an output<br>
adjusting gear (not shown) that is instal led insideof the control panel 40.<br>
The coupling shaft 22 defines a coupling hole 24 at its leading end to receive a coupl ing<br>
member such as a screw. The coupl ing shaft 22 has a circular sect ion of which some port ion is cut off.<br><br>
The output adjusting Gear defines a shaft hole at a center portion to receive the coup I ing shaft 20.<br>
Therefore, when the coupl ing shaft 22 is inserted into the shaft hole, the output adjust ing gear can<br>
be rotated by rotating the dial knob 20.<br>
Further, a coupler gear (not shown) is interposed between the output adjusting gear and a<br>
control circuit gear (not shown) controlling the output power of the microwave oven.<br>
The Operation of the dial knob assembly will now be described briefly.<br>
When the user rotates the dial knob 20 to set cooking temperature or heating intensity<br>
(output power) of the microwave oven, the output adjust ing gear coupled with the coupl ing shaft 22 of<br>
the dial knob 20 is rotated proport ional ly to the rotat ion of the dial knob 20. The rotat ion of the<br>
output adjust ing gear causes the coupler gear to rotate.<br>
Dial knobs having the same or simi lar structures as ment ioned above are disclosed in Korean<br>
Patent Laid-Open Nos. 10-2003-0079583 and 10-2003-0085887, appl ied by the present appl icant of the<br>
present invent ion.<br>
However, thedial knobof the related art has some disadvantages.<br>
The shaft 22 of the dial knob 20 has a circular section of which some port ion is cut of f, and<br>
def ines the coupl ing hole 24 for coupl ing with the coupl ing member to prevent detachment of the dial<br>
knob 20 from the output adjust ing gear. Therefore, the sect ion of the shaft 22 around the coupl ing<br>
hole 24 is not uniform. This non-uniform sect ion may cause a crack at a narrower port ion when the<br>
coupl ing member is inserted.<br>
Further, rotat ing the dial knob 20 with an excessive force may cause a crack at the narrower<br>
sect ion of the coupl ing shaft 22. and once the crack is formed it maybe easi ly developed even when the<br>
dial knob 20 is gently rotated, thereby breaking the coupl ing shaft 22 and causing ma I funct ion of the<br>
dial knob 20.<br><br>
[Disclosure]<br>

[Best Mode]<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 2 is an exploded perspective view of a dial knob assembly according to the present<br>
invent ion.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a dial knob assembly includes: a dial knob 100 which a user can rotate; a<br>
control panel 300 on which display devices are installed; an output adjusting gear 200 to be<br>
installed inside of the control panel 300 and coupled with the dial knob 100; and a screw 330 for<br>
fastening the output adjust ing gear to the dial knob 100. The dial knob 100 is rotatably inserted in<br>
the control panel 300 (when assembled).<br>
The dial knob 100 defines a recessed opening on the back and includes a cyl indrical coupl ing<br>
shaft 110 protruded from a center of the recessed open ing with a predetermined length. The coupl ing<br>
shaft 110 defines a screw hole 120 having a predetermined depth, in which a coupl ing member such as<br>
the screw 300 is to be inserted.<br>
Further, the dial knob 100 includes at least one guide rib 130 (two are shown) formed on an<br>
outer surface of the coupling shaft 110 with a predetermined length and width, and includes a<br>
reinforcement rib 140 extended from a side of the guide rib 130 with a predetermined length. The<br>
guide rib 130 includes a coupl Ing tab 150 at its leading end with a predetermined length. The width ,<br>
of the coupl ing tab 150 issomewhat smal ler than that of the guide r ib 130.<br>
The rotational movement of the dial knob 100 is restricted by the guide rib 130 and a stop<br>
projection 310 (tne stopping is distinctly shown in Fig. 4). That Is, the dial knob 100 can be<br>
rotated until the guide rib 130 is abutted against the stop project ion 310. The reinforcement rib<br>
140 protects the guide rib 130 from an excessive force acted when the guide rib 130 Is abutted against<br><br>
the stop projection 310. The coupling tab 150 is to be inserted in a tab slot 211 of the output<br>
adjusting gear 200. The width and length of the coupling tab 150 is not limited to the illustrated<br>
shape. For example, the width and length of the coupl ing tab 150 may be the same values as the guide<br>
rib 130. Also, it is apparent that the size of the tab slot 211 of the output adjusting gear 200<br>
should be changed depend ing on thewidthof the coupl ing tab 150.<br>
The control panel 300 includes a knob hole 320 and the stop project ion 310. The dial knob<br>
100 is inserted into the knob hole 320, and the stop projection 310 is extended toward the center of<br>
the knob hole 320 to restrict the rotation of the dial knob 100. The stop project ion 310 is designed<br>
such that the guide rib 130 is abutted against the side of the stop project ion 310 when the dial knob<br>
100 is rotated a predetermined angle, thereby restricting the rotat ion of the dial knob 100.<br>
The output adjust ing gear 200 includes a shaft hole 210 and the tab slot 211. The shaft hole<br>
210 is def ined at a center port ion of the output adjust ing gear 200 to receive the coupl ing shaft 110<br>
of the dial knob 100. The tab slot 211 (two are shown) is defined in a radial direction of the shaft<br>
hole 210 with a width corresponding to the width of the coupl ing tab 150, such that the coupl ing tab<br>
150 can be inserted into the tab slot 211. Therefore, the coup I ing shaft 110 and the coupling tab 150<br>
can be exactly inserted into the shaft hole 210 and the tab slot 211 respectively, such that the<br>
output adjust ing gear 200 can be coupled with the dial knob 100.<br>
Further, the output adjusting gear 200 includes gear teeth 220 at its circumference to<br>
engage with a coupler gear (now shown) that is engaged with a control circuit gear. The output<br>
adjusting gear 200 also includes a guide surface 230 that is extended from the gear teeth 220. The<br>
guide surface 230 has a less width than that of the gear teeth 220 but a large outer diameter than that<br>
of the gear teeth 220. The guide surface 230 supports the coupler gear to prevent disengagement of<br>
the coupler gear from the output adjust ing gear 200.<br>
The coupling member (screw 330) is to be inserted in the screw hole 120 of the coupl ing shaft<br><br>
110 in order to secure thecoupling of the dial knob 100 and the output adjusting gear 200.<br>
The operation of the dial knob assembly wi 11 nowbedescr ibed.<br>
Operating input values such as heating time and heating intensity (output power) are set<br>
using the dial knob 100. That is, theoperation of the microwave oven is started by manipulating the<br>
dial knob 100.<br>
When a user rotates the dial knob 100 to set operating input values such as cooking time and<br>
output power, the rotational force acted on the dial knob 100 by the user is transmitted to the shaft<br>
hole 210 through the coupl ing shaft 110 and the coupl ing tab 150. The transmitted force rotates the<br>
output adjust ing gear 200. That is, rotation of the dial knob 100 causes the output adjust ing gear<br>
200 to rotate.<br>
Further, the rotation of the output adjust ing gear 200 causes the coupler gear torotate, and<br>
thecontrol circuit gear engagedwith thecoupler gear is also rotated. Intheend, the cooking time<br>
and output power (operating input values) can beset by the rotation of the control circuit gear.<br>
Fig. 3 is a rear view of a dial knob according to the present invention, and Fig. 4 is a<br>
phantom view of a dial knob assembly according to the present invention.<br>
Refer r ing to Figs. 3 and 4, the dial knob 100 has a circular barrel shape with a predetermined<br>
diameter and depth and is provided wi th the coupl ing shaft 110 extended from the inner center. The<br>
coupl ing shaft 110 includes the guide rib 130 (two are shown) formed in the radial direction with a<br>
predetermined radial width and axial length.<br>
The reinforcement rib 140 is projected from one side of the guide rib 130 to enhance the<br>
strength of the guide rib 130. The other side of the guide rib 130 where the reinforcement rib 140 is<br>
not formed is to be brought into contact with the stop projection 310. Therefore, though a user<br>
excessively rotates the dial knob 100, the excessive load on the guide rib 130 can be transmitted to<br>
the reinforcement rib 140, such that the guide rib 130 can be protected from breakage. Most weak<br><br>
region, border between the coupl ing shaft 110 and the guide rib 130, can be protected wel I owing to<br>
the reinforceraeitrib 140.<br>
Fig. 5 is a sectional viewof a dial knob assembly according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the dial knob 100 is mounted on the control panel 300, and the output<br>
adjust ing gear 200 is coup led with the dial knob 100 from an inside of the control panel 300.<br>
The control panel 300 includes an inwardly recessed surface and a circular receiving sleeve<br>
340. On the inwardly recessed surface, the dial knob 100 is mounted. The circular receiving<br>
sleeve 340 is protruded from the opposite surface of the inwardly recessed surface with a<br>
predetermined length to receive the output adjust ing gear 200. That is, the output adjusting gear<br>
200 is inserted in the receiving sleeve 340 and is rotated when the dial knob 100 is rotated. Since<br>
the output adjusting gear 200 is inserted into the receiving sleeve 340, the output adjusting gear<br>
200can be prevented from separat ing from the control panel 300.<br>
The teeth 220 are formed on a circumference of the output adjusting gear 200. The guide<br>
surface 230 is formed under the teeth 220 with a large diameter than that of the teeth 220. The<br>
output adjusting gear 200 includes a gear sleeve 240 protruded from a surface faced with the control<br>
panel 300.<br>
The outer diameter of the gear sleeve 240 is the same as the inner diameter of the receiving<br>
sleeve 340 of the control panel 300, such that the gear sleeve 240 can be tightly inserted into the<br>
receiving sleeve 240. When the dial knob 100 is rotated, the gear sleeve 240 is also rotated in the<br>
receiving sleeve 340.<br>
The coupl ing tab 150 is extended forwardly from the guide rib 130 with a predetermined height.<br>
The coupl ing tab 150 is inserted into the tab slot 211 of the output adjust ing gear 200. The screw<br>
330 is inserted into the screw hole 120 formed in the coupling shaft 110.<br>
The stop project ion 310 of the control panel 300 restr icts the rotat ion of the dial knob 100,<br><br>
such that the dial knob 100 is rotated within a restricted range. This restriction protects the<br>
coupling shaft from a crack.<br>
According to the construct ion of the dial knob, the coupl ing shaft 110 can have a circular<br>
section. Also, in case the screw hole 120 is defined in the coupl ing shaft 110, the coupl ing shaft<br>
110 can have a uniform section without a narrower portion. Therefore, stress concentration is not<br>
appeared when a force is acted on the coupl ing shaft 110, such that durabi I ityof the dial knob can be<br>
increased.<br>
Further, the relationship between the guide rib 130 and the stop project ion 310 restricts<br>
the rotat ion of the dial knob 100 within a predetermined range, such that operational rel iabi I i ty of<br>
thedial knob 100 can be increased.<br>
Furthermore, the guide rib 130 and the reinforcement rib 140 enhances the strength of the<br>
dial knob 100, such that the dial knob 100 can be protected from the excessive force without breakage,<br>
thereby increasing durability of the dial knob 100.<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
The dial <nob of the present invention is designed such that coupl ing shaft can have a></nob>
circular section, and in case the screw hole is defined in the coupl ing shaft the coupl ing shaft can<br>
have a uniform sect ion.<br>
Therefore, thedial knob of the present invent ion can be appl ied to var ious home appl iances<br>
such as microwave ovens and washing machines that require the dial knob to input operating set<br>
values.<br><br>
