CLUTCH PLATE WITH INTERNAL FLUID CHANNELS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a clutch assembly having a clutch plate<br>
with a plurality of internal fluid passages configured for conducting pressurized fluid<br>
directly to the friction interface for cooling of the interface and for reducing spin losses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	In an automotive transmission, clutch assemblies are commonly used to<br>
transmit rotational motion or torque between two rotating members, such as an engine<br>
crankshaft and a transmission driveshaft. Standard friction-type clutch assemblies, or<br>
friction clutches, include a series of alternating friction and reaction plates that together<br>
make up a clutch pack, with the clutch pack being disposed within an outer clutch drum.<br>
The friction plate typically has a layer of rough friction material which is bonded or<br>
otherwise attached to the primary contact surfaces of a metal core plate, while the<br>
reaction plate typically has a relatively smooth contact surface configured to oppose the<br>
friction plate when the friction clutch is engaged. The friction clutch is engaged or<br>
applied using a controllable hydraulic force supplied by a transmission pump. The force<br>
actuates an apply mechanism, such as a clutch-apply piston, to selectively compress the<br>
friction and reaction plates of the clutch pack. Once compressed, the alternating plates<br>
become interlocked due to the friction forces imparted by the apply force and the friction<br>
material, thereby allowing the rotating members to rotate in unison.<br>
[0003]	Friction clutches may be of the dry-plate or wet-plate variety, with wet-<br>
plate friction clutches providing enhanced thermal performance due to the cooling<br>
qualities of the pressurized lubricating fluid. In particular, the enhanced thermal<br>
performance is accomplished by passing or directing the pressurized fluid, such as<br>
transmission fluid or oil, through and around the mating clutch surfaces to dissipate heat<br>
generated by the friction forces in proximity to the friction interface between the surfaces.<br>
Lubricated surface cooling of friction clutch plates is often provided via a series of<br>
shallow radial channels or grooves along the contact surfaces of the friction plates, with<br><br>
GP-308124-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
the grooves being pressed into or formed on a separate bonded friction material layer, or<br>
defined by the gaps between discrete patches of friction material. However, as such<br>
patches and/or surface grooves reduce the total contact area between the mating clutch<br>
surfaces, surface temperature may increase along the remaining contact surfaces,<br>
resulting in less than optimum overall plate cooling. Also, spin losses may occur while<br>
the clutch assembly is disengaged as friction forces create drag between the plates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	Accordingly, an engageable clutch assembly is provided having a friction<br>
interface adapted for use with a pressurized fluid, the assembly comprising at least one<br>
clutch plate having at least one internal fluid passage and at least one reaction surface at<br>
least partially defining the friction interface, wherein the at least one fluid passages is<br>
configured to conduct the pressurized fluid directly to the friction interface for cooling of<br>
the friction interface when the clutch assembly is engaging, and for reducing spin losses<br>
through the clutch assembly when the clutch assembly is disengaged.<br>
[0005]	In one aspect of the invention, there are a plurality of internal fluid<br>
passages, with at least one of the fluid passages being plugged at one end to prevent flow<br>
of fluid in one direction as needed.<br>
[0006]	In another aspect of the invention, the fluid passages include at least one<br>
main or primary fluid passage and at least one secondary fluid passage intersecting at<br>
least one of the main or primary fluid passages in a perpendicular direction.<br>
[0007]	In another aspect of the invention, the thickness of the clutch plate and the<br>
diameter of at least one of the primary and secondary fluid passages are proportionately<br>
related by a ratio of approximately 2:1.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect of the invention, the clutch plate is a unitary<br>
friction/reaction plate with friction material on one side.<br>
[0009]	In another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for controlling<br>
fluid flow at the friction interface of a clutch plate assembly. The method includes<br>
providing fluid directly to the friction interface to cool the interface when the clutch plate<br><br>
GP-308124-PTT-DLT<br>
3<br>
assembly is engaging, and providing fluid to the friction interface when the clutch plate<br>
assembly is disengaged to thereby reduce spin losses through the clutch plate assembly.<br>
[0010]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 an<br>
exploded view of a clutch plate assembly 10 having a friction plate 14 and a reaction<br>
plate 18, and a friction interface 65 therebetween. For simplicity, only one friction plate<br>
14 is shown, however those skilled in the art will recognize that clutch plate assembly 10<br>
may consist of any number of alternately arranged friction plates 14 and reaction plates<br>
18, depending on the specific clutch application. Friction plate 14 has a core plate 36<br>
having a first and second main surface 28, 29, respectively, the core plate 36 preferably<br>
constructed of a suitable grade of stainless steel and having a plurality of inwardly-<br>
extending splines 24 configured to mate or interlock with alternating grooves of an<br>
adjoining clutch hub (not shown).<br>
[0020]	Preferably, first and second main surfaces 28, 29 each have a layer of<br>
friction material 20A, 20B, respectively, which is bonded or otherwise attached to<br>
surfaces 28, 29 of the core plate 36, although friction material such as 20A, 20B may also<br>
be bonded directly to a unitary friction/reaction plate (not shown). The friction material<br>
20A, 20B is preferably ring-shaped and sized to cover the primary surface 28, 29 of the<br>
core plate 36 to which the friction material is bonded, and further includes a plurality of<br>
surface fluid channels 16 that separate the friction material layer 20A, 20B into<br>
substantially equal patches or segments for directing pressurized fluid 15 between the<br>
outer diameter 38 and the inner diameter 13 of the core plate 36, or between the inner<br>
diameter 13 and the outer diameter 38, depending on the design of the clutch assembly<br>
10. While the friction material 20A, 20B as shown in Figure 1 have fluid channels 16 as<br>
shown, other styles or designs of friction material may also be used within the scope of<br>
the invention, including, for example, smooth or grooveless material, or a series of<br>
surface channels or grooves that are pressed partially through the thickness of the friction<br>
material 20A, 20B.<br>
[0021]	Friction plate 14 is configured to press against and synchronize with the<br>
speed of the mating reaction plate 18 when a controllable source of hydraulic pressure,<br>
preferably a positive displacement transmission pump 11, actuates or engages an apply<br><br>
GP-308124-PTT-DLT<br>
5<br>
mechanism such as clutch-apply piston (not shown) to selectively compress the<br>
alternating friction plates 14 and reaction plates 18 that make up the clutch assembly 10.<br>
As plates 14, 18 become interlocked due to the friction forces imparted by the layer of<br>
friction material 20B, the clutch plate assembly is thereby engaged, and the mating plates<br>
14, 18 are permitted to rotate in unison.<br>
[0022]	Reaction plate 18 is a preferably circular metallic ring of a suitable grade<br>
of stainless steel having an outer and inner diameter 22, 12, respectively, and includes a<br>
plurality of outwardly extending splines 32 configured to mate or interlock with a<br>
plurality of grooves positioned on the inside surface of a mating clutch drum (not shown).<br>
The reaction plate 18 has a first main surface 37 and a reverse or second main surface 39<br>
(see Figure 2A), with main surfaces 37, 39 being at least as wide as the width of friction<br>
material 20A, 20B to allow for maximum frictional contact area between mating plates<br>
such as plates 14 and 18. The reaction plate 18 also has outer and inner lateral or side<br>
surfaces 48, 58, respectively, each having a width/height sufficient to provide the reaction<br>
plate 18 with adequate bending and surface strength without adding excessive weight for<br>
a given clutch application, and with sufficient thickness to accommodate the drilling of<br>
fluid passages therein as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0023]	Reaction plate 18 is further provided with a plurality of primary fluid<br>
passages 42 extending radially inward through the reaction plate 18 from outer lateral<br>
surface 48 to inner lateral surface 58, preferably perpendicularly with respect to the<br>
lateral surfaces 48, 58 as shown in Figure 1 and substantially parallel to the main surfaces<br>
37, 39. Each of primary fluid passages 42 are in fluid communication with a source 11 of<br>
pressurized fluid 15 which is configured to deliver the fluid 15 through one of the outer<br>
or inner orifices 34, 50 of primary fluid passage 42, depending on the application.<br>
Orifices 34, 50, along with primary fluid channels 42, are preferably circular or<br>
cylindrical in shape so as to minimize the effects of fluid friction and are preferably<br>
positioned approximately midway up lateral surfaces 48, 58 and approximately halfway<br>
between main surfaces 37, 39 of reaction plate 18, and approximately midway between<br>
each of the outer splines 32, so as to minimize the amount of material that must be<br>
removed from the reaction plate 18 during forming or drilling of the primary fluid<br><br>
GP-308124-PTT-DLT<br>
6<br>
passages 42. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the location of the outer<br>
orifices 34 may be positioned in alternate locations along or around the outer lateral<br>
surface 48. For example, each of outer orifices 34 may be positioned on a respective<br>
spline face 33 of an outer spline 32 to thereby increase the area of potential fluid/metal<br>
contact for an enhanced fluid cooling effect.<br>
[0024]	Turning to Figure 2A, which is a side view of a portion of the clutch plate<br>
assembly 10, a reaction plate 18 is disposed between a pair of friction plates 14A, 14B,<br>
forming or defining a pair of boundary or friction interfaces 65 A, 65B between the<br>
friction plates 14A, 14B and the reaction plate 18, respectively. Outer orifice 34 admits a<br>
flow of pressurized fluid 15 from outer lateral surface 48 into the reaction plate 18, as<br>
previously explained herewithin. For delivery of fluid 15 directly to the friction interfaces<br>
65 A, 65B for the cooling of main surfaces 37, 39, the reaction plate 18 is further provided<br>
with a preferably circular or cylindrical secondary fluid passage 62 having a pair of<br>
circular or cylindrical first and second orifices 40 and 70, respectively, each in fluid<br>
communication with primary fluid passage 42 through the secondary fluid passage 62.<br>
[0025]	In the preferred embodiment, first and second orifices 40, 70 are each<br>
positioned on main surfaces 37, 39, respectively, at opposite ends of secondary fluid<br>
passage 62 and open to the friction interfaces 65A, 65B between reaction plate 18 and<br>
friction plates 14A, 14B, respectively. First orifice 40 is positioned on the main surface<br>
37 of reaction plate 18 directly above primary fluid passage 42 and approximately<br>
midway between the respective outer and inner diameters 22, 12 of the reaction plate 18,<br>
and second orifice 70 is positioned on the second primary surface 39 directly below<br>
primary fluid passage 42. While Figure 1 shows just one first and second orifice 40, 70,<br>
those skilled in the art will recognize that additional orifices substantially identical to first<br>
and second orificies 40, 70 may be added as needed depending on the size/width of the<br>
reaction plate and/or desired cooling/lubricating requirements of a given clutch plate<br>
assembly design.<br>
[0026]	During a transient high temperature, low relative velocity condition, i.e.<br>
the low speed conditions most likely to cause shudder or vibration due to slippage, the<br>
secondary fluid passage 62 takes advantage of the relatively low viscosity of the fluid 15<br><br>
GP-308124-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
under high temperature conditions to draw the fluid from primary fluid passage 42<br>
directly to the low local pressure region created in proximity to the first and second<br>
orifices 34, 70. Without requiring a reduction in contact surface area of the friction<br>
material 20A, 20B, shudder or vibration at low relative rotational speed is thereby<br>
reduced in part by delivering the fluid 15 directly to the friction interfaces 65A, 65B as<br>
needed. When the clutch assembly 10 is rotating in unison at relatively high rates of<br>
speed, the low pressure region formed in proximity to first and second orifices 40, 70,<br>
respectively, between the disparately rotating plates 14, 18 disappears, and the various<br>
plates of the clutch assembly 10 are pressed together, thereby substantially blocking the<br>
flow of fluid 15 through the orifices 40, 70. In this manner, loss of excess fluid 15 into<br>
the friction interfaces 65A, 65B helps to preserve fluid and prevent flooding of the<br>
friction interfaces 65A, 65B, thus minimi/ing the hydroplaning effect between friction<br>
plates 14A, 14B and reaction plate 18. Those skilled in the art will recognize that when<br>
clutch assembly 10 is disengaged, fluid 15 will continue to be fed at line pressure through<br>
the orifices 40, 70, which will provide a hydraulic force at the friction interfaces 65 A,<br>
65B sufficient to separate the various adjacent plates, such as friction plates 14 and<br>
reaction plate 18 and reducing or minimizing the spin losses or drag therebetween.<br>
[0027]	In a second embodiment shown in Figure 3A, a blind primary fluid<br>
passage 142 is shown extending or penetrating from the outer lateral surface 48 to a<br>
closed or blind end 72 of primary fluid passage 142 which is short of the inner diameter<br>
12 of reaction plate 18. As configured, fluid 15 may enter the outer orifice 34, pass<br>
through primary fluid passage 142, and exit first and second orifices 40, 70 as previously<br>
explained herewithin. However, due to the blind end 72 of primary fluid passage 142, the<br>
fluid 15 is blocked or prevented from passing all the way through to the inner diameter<br>
12. Fluid 15 is conserved in this manner while still being drawn by the local low pressure<br>
zone between plates 14A, 14B and 18 through secondary fluid passages 62 to reach the<br>
friction interface 65A, 65B (see Figure 2A). Alternately, as shown in Figure 3B, in<br>
situations or configurations in which flow of the fluid 15 initiates from the inner lateral<br>
surface 58 of internal diameter 12, an alternate primary fluid passage 242 may extend or<br>
penetrate from the inner diameter 12 to a closed or blind end 74 of primary fluid passage<br><br>
GP-308124-P'IT-DLT<br>
8<br>
242. The blind end 74 is short of the outer diameter 22 of reaction plate 18. Both blind<br>
ends 72 and 74 are preferably positioned approximately % of the distance between the<br>
inner diameter 12 and outer diameter 22 of reaction plate 18 to allow for some additional<br>
core cooling of reaction plate 18, although other distances are also within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0028]	In a third embodiment as shown in Figure 3C, primary fluid passage 42<br>
extends all the way through reaction plate 18 from inner diameter 12 to outer diameter<br>
22, and is capped or otherwise blocked, preferably by a plug 67 that is inserted into the<br>
inner orifice 50, thus blocking fluid 15 from flowing all the way through reaction plate<br>
18. This embodiment facilitates a drilling or boring process initiating from within the<br>
inner diameter 12 of the reaction plate 18, as may be required to produce the embodiment<br>
of Figure 3B, particularly in situations in which the reaction plate 18 is relatively small in<br>
diameter. Preferably, the plug 67 is constructed of suitable material such as stainless steel<br>
when the plus is to be inserted into inner orifice 50 and secured with epoxy or other<br>
adhesive material (not shown) with sufficient strength and materials properties to retain<br>
the plug 67 within the inner orifice 50 in the presence of fluid 15 for the operational<br>
lifetime of the reaction plate 18.<br>
[0029]	While a multi-plate design is preferred, a fourth embodiment includes<br>
unitary friction/reaction plates 110A, 110B as shown in Figure 4, which are stacked<br>
without a separate core plate 36 (see Figure 1). Friction material 26 is bonded or attached<br>
directly to one surface 137A, 137B of each unitary plate 110A, 110B, respectively, with<br>
each unitary plate 110A, 110B having respective alternating internally and externally<br>
projecting splines 124, 132. Unitary plate 110A has an internal orifice 150A and an<br>
external orifice 134A disposed at either end of at least one primary fluid passage 342,<br>
each of which is intersected by a secondary fluid passage 162 having a single orifice 170.<br>
Likewise, unitary plate 110B has an internal orifice 150B and an external orifice 134B<br>
disposed at either end of at least one primary fluid passage 342, with primary fluid<br>
passages 342 being substantially identical to passage 42 as previously described<br>
hereinabove (see Figure 1). In this fourth embodiment, as* shown in partial side view in<br>
Figure 4B, only one friction interface 65C will be formed relative to each pair of unitary<br><br>
GP-308124-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
plates 110A, 110B, and accordingly, only a single orifice 170 would be required opening<br>
thereto from each of primary fluid passages 342, although multiple secondary passages<br>
162 and orifices 170 may be added as needed to deliver more fluid 15 to the friction<br>
interface 65C as required. Orifices 134A and 150A, and primary fluid passage 342 may<br>
also be configured using blind or plugged holes as previously described herewithin as the<br>
application or clutch design requires.<br>
[0030]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>

passages includes at least one primary fluid passage and at least one secondary<br>
passage intersecting said at least one primary fluid passage, wherein said at least<br>
one primary fluid passage is configured to conduct said fluid through said reaction<br>
plate and into said secondary fluid passage, and wherein said secondary fluid<br>
passage is configured to conduct said fluid directly to said friction interface as<br>
needed.<br>
14.	The method of claim 13, wherein said at least one main fluid<br>
passage is configured to prevent flow in one direction.<br>
15.	The method of claim 13, wherein said at least one secondary fluid<br>
passage is substantially perpendicular to the at least one primary fluid passage it<br>
intersects.<br>
16.	The method of claim 13, wherein the thickness of said reaction<br>
plate and the diameter of at least one of the said at least one primary fluid passage<br>
and said at least one secondary fluid passage are proportionately related by a ratio<br>
of approximately 2:1.<br><br>
A clutch plate assembly is provided having a friction interface and internal<br>
fluid passages for delivering pressurized fluid to the friction interface to cool the<br>
interface, and to reduce spin losses through the clutch assembly. The fluid passages<br>
comprise a plurality of primary passages extending inward from a clutch plate inner or<br>
outer diameter, and a plurality of secondary fluid passages intersecting the primary fluid<br>
passages for conducting fluid to the friction interface. Fluid is directed to the friction<br>
interface during clutch engagement for cooling thereof when the clutch assembly is<br>
engaging, and separates the clutch plates to reduce spin losses when the clutch assembly<br>
is disengaged. A method is also provided for controlling fluid flow at the friction<br>
interface, including providing fluid directly to the interface for cooling when the clutch<br>
plate assembly is engaging, and for reducing spin losses when the clutch plate assembly<br>
is substantially disengaged.<br></td>
