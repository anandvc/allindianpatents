				<td>SECONDARY BATTERY PACK HAVING CONFIGURATION OF<br>
ALTERNATIVE ORIENTATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a secondary battery pack having an alternate<br>
orientation structure, and, more particularly, to a secondary battery pack including a<br>
plurality of cartridges, each of which has a plurality of unit cells mounted therein and<br>
which are stacked one on another such that electrode terminals of the neighboring<br>
cartridges are not located on the same plane when the cartridges are electrically<br>
connected to each other, thereby accomplishing easy and safe electrical connection<br>
between the cartridges.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, a secondary battery, which can be charged and discharged, has been<br>
widely used as an energy source for wireless mobile devices. Also, the secondary<br>
battery has attracted considerable attention as a power source for electric vehicles and<br>
hybrid electric vehicles, which have been developed to solve problems, such as air<br>
pollution, caused by existing gasoline and diesel vehicles using fossil fuel.<br>
Small-sized mobile devices use one or more unit cells, for example, three or<br>
four unit cells, for each device. To the contrary, medium- or large-sized devices, such as<br>
vehicles, use a battery pack comprising a plurality of unit cells electrically connected<br>
with each other as a high-output, large-capacity battery is required.<br>
Generally, a plurality of unit cells, which are connected in series or parallel<br>
with each other, are mounted in a cartridge, and a plurality of such cartridges are<br>
electrically connected with each other. In this way, a battery pack is manufactured.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating an exemplary structure of a cartridge<br>
having four unit cells mounted therein.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the cartridge 100 comprises a pair of frames 120 and 122,<br>
which are attached to each other. The unit cells 200 and 201 are located in cell partitions<br>
130 of the frames 120 and 122 while the frames 120 and 122 are separated from each<br>
other, and are then securely fixed at the cell partitions 130 of the frames 120 and 122<br>
after the frames 120 and 122 are attached to each other. The unit cell 200 has an<br>
electrode lead (not shown), which is electrically connected to that of a neighboring unit<br>
cell 201 viaabus 140 located at the upper part of the cartridge 100. As shown in FIG. 1,<br>
the unit cells 200 and 201 arc connected in series with each other, although the unit cells<br>
may be connected in parallel with each other. The unit cells are electrically connected to<br>
a cathode terminal 150 and an anode terminal 160, which protrude at opposite sides of<br>
the upper end of the cartridge 10, respectively.<br>
FIG. 2 is a typical view illustrating the electrical connection of cartridges in a<br>
conventional battery pack.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a plurality of unit cells (not shown) are mounted in each<br>
of the cartridges 101, 102, 103 ... 110 in the same fashion as shown in FIG. 1. The<br>
cartridge 101 is provided at opposite sides of the upper end thereof with a cathode<br>
terminal 151 and an anode terminal 161. To accomplish the electrical connection<br>
between the cartridges 101, 102, 103 ... 110, the first cartridge 101 is stacked on the<br>
second cartridge 102 while the first cartridge 101 and the second cartridge 102 face<br>
each other such that the cathode terminal 151 of the first cartridge 101 is adjacent to<br>
an anode terminal 162 of the second cartridge 102. The electrical connection between<br>
the cartridges 101, 102, 103 ... 110 is performed by bus bars 170. The bus bars 170<br>
are fixed to the respective terminals of the cartridges by welding. Also, the second<br>
cartridge 102 is stacked on the third cartridge 103 while the second cartridge 102 and<br>
the third cartridge 103 face each other such that a cathode terminal 152 of the second<br>
cartridge 102 is adjacent to an anode terminal 163 of the third cartridge 103. In the<br>
same manner, the other cartridges 104 ... 110 are stacked one on another in order<br>
while the cartridges 104 ... 110 face each other. The anode terminal 161 of the first<br>
cartridge 101 and a cathode terminal 150 of the last cartridge 110 are connected to a<br>
battery management system (BMS), which is not shown in the drawings. The<br>
cartridges 101, 102, 103 ... 110 are stacked one on another while the cartridges 101,<br>
102, 103 ... 110 face each other as described above, and therefore, a high-output<br>
battery pack 300 having a plurality of unit cells connected in series with each other is<br>
completed.<br>
However, the battery pack 300 with the above-described structure has the<br>
following problems because the connection length between the terminals 151 and 162<br>
of the two neighboring cartridges (for example, the cartridges 101 and 102) is very<br>
small, and the distance between a terminal connection part (first connection part) 401<br>
for connecting the terminals of the neighboring cartridges 101 and 102 and another<br>
terminal connection part (second connection part) 402 for connecting the terminals of<br>
the neighboring cartridges 103 and 104 is also very small.<br>
First, it is difficult to connect the terminals. The thickness of each cartridge is<br>
nearly equal to that of the unit cell. As a result, the connection length between the<br>
terminals of the neighboring cartridges is very small when the cartridges are stacked<br>
one on another. Consequently, a process of connecting the terminals, which are very<br>
close to each other, and a process of forming the terminal connection parts without<br>
affecting the neighboring terminal connection parts are time- consuming and require<br>
high precision, thereby significantly reducing the manufacturing efficiency of the<br>
battery pack.<br>
Secondly, when the terminals are connected with each other using electric<br>
wires, the structure of the battery pack is very complicated. Furthermore, the electric<br>
wires may be connected to each other, and therefore, interference between the electric<br>
wires occurs.<br>
Thirdly, the terminal connection parts are concentrated at one side of the<br>
battery pack. As a result, the second terminal connection part must be formed in the<br>
vicinity of the first terminal connection part. Consequently, a possibility of electric<br>
shock is very high.<br>
As described above, the conventional battery pack has several structural<br>
problems, and therefore, a battery pack having a new structure solving the problems is<br>
required.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to substantially obviate<br>
the above-mentioned problems of the conventional arts as well as the technical<br>
problems requested from the past,<br>
The inventors have performed various experiments and research, and have<br>
found that, when first and second cartridges are stacked one on another such that the<br>
orientation angle between electrode terminals of the first and second cartridges is 90<br>
degrees or more, electrode terminals of a third cartridge, which is adjacent to the<br>
second cartridge, are arranged in the same orientation as the electrode terminals of the<br>
first cartridge, the electrode terminals of the first and third cartridges, which are<br>
arranged in the same orientation, are electrically connected to each other, and the<br>
electrode terminals of the second cartridge are electrically connected to electrode<br>
terminals of fourth cartridge, which is arranged in the same orientation as the second<br>
cartridge and adjacent to the third cartridge, the connection length between the<br>
connected terminals and the distance between terminal connection parts are increased<br>
by the thickness of one cartridge, and the terminal connection parts are not<br>
concentrated at one side of the battery pack, and as a result, the battery pack is easily<br>
manufactured, the manufacturing efficiency is increased, and safety during the<br>
manufacture of the battery pack is significantly improved.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be<br>
accomplished by the provision of a battery pack including a plurality of cartridges,<br>
which are stacked one on another while the cartridges are electrically connected with<br>
each other, wherein the cartridges are stacked in an alternate orientation manner, in<br>
which electrode terminals of a second one of the cartridges adjacent to a first one of<br>
the cartridges are arranged at an angle of 90 degrees or more to electrode terminals of<br>
the first one of the cartridges, and electrode terminals of a third one of the cartridges<br>
adjacent to the second one of the cartridges are arranged in the same orientation as the<br>
electrode terminals of the first one of the cartridges, and wherein the electrode<br>
terminals of the first one of the cartridge are electrically connected to the electrode<br>
terminals of the third one of the cartridges, respectively, the electrode terminals of the<br>
second one of the cartridge are electrically connected to electrode tenninals of a fourth<br>
one of the cartridges, respectively, and electrode terminals of the last one of the<br>
cartridges are electrically connected to electrode terminals of the neighboring one of<br>
the cartridges, respectively.<br>
Preferably, the orientation angle between the electrode terminals of the<br>
neighboring cartridges is 180 degrees. In this case, the first cartridge and the second<br>
cartridge are stacked one on another such that the front part of the second cartridge is<br>
adjacent to the rear part of the first cartridge. Consequently, the alternate 180-degree<br>
orientation of the cartridges is easily accomplished.<br>
The number of the cartridges stacked in the battery pack is not particularly<br>
restricted. The number of the cartridges is set in response to desired battery output.<br>
For example, 4 to 20 cartridges may be stacked one on another to constitute a battery<br>
pack.<br>
Also, the structure of the cartridges is not restricted so long as a plurality of<br>
unit cells are mounted in each cartridge while the unit cells are electrically connected<br>
with each other. The number of the unit cells mounted in each cartridge is not<br>
particularly restricted. The unit cells mounted in each cartridge may be connected<br>
either in series, or the unit cells may be connected in parallel after the unit cells are<br>
connected in series. Preferably, the unit cells are connected either in series with each<br>
other,<br>
The unit cells mounted in each cartridge are cells that can be charged and<br>
discharged. Preferably, square-shaped cells or pouch-shaped cells, which accumulate<br>
electricity in high density, are used as the unit cells. More preferably, the pouchshaped<br>
cells are used as the unit cells.<br>
Each of the unit cells has a cathode, an anode, a separation film, and an<br>
electrolyte mounted in a sealed cell case. An electrode assembly including a minute<br>
porous separation film between thin film-shaped cathode and anode may be wound, or<br>
fullcells or bicells of cathode/separation film/anode structure may be sequentially<br>
stacked one on another. Active materials applied to the cathode and the anode are not<br>
particularly restricted. Preferably, the cathode active material consists of lithium<br>
manganese-based oxide having high safety, and the anode active material consists of<br>
carbon. The preferable unit cell is a lithium-ion cell or a lithium-ion polymer cell.<br>
The electric connection between the electrode terminals of the cartridges is<br>
made using conductive metal bars, electric wires, or a printed circuit board, which are<br>
fixed to the corresponding electrode terminals, for example, by welding, riveting, or<br>
screwing. The electrode terminals of the cartridges may be electrically connected in<br>
series, or the electrode terminals of the cartridges may be electrically connected in<br>
parallel after the electrode terminals of the cartridges are electrically connected in<br>
series. Preferably, the electrode terminals of the cartridges are electrically connected<br>
in series with each other.<br>
The last one (the nft cartridge) of the cartridges stacked in the alternate<br>
orientation manner is electrically connected to the neighboring cartridge (n-1*<br>
cartridge). In this way, the cartridges having different orientations arc electrically<br>
connected to each other, and therefore, a battery pack is completed.<br>
The battery pack according to the present invention is used as a high-output,<br>
large-capacity power source. Preferably, the battery pack is used as a power source for<br>
electric vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted, however, that<br>
the scope of the present invention is not limited by the illustrated embodiment.<br>
FIG. 3 is a typical view illustrating the electrical connection of cartridges in a<br>
battery pack according to an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 4 is a<br>
perspective view illustrating a battery pack constituted by stacking cartridges, one of<br>
which is shown in FIG. 1, in the structure shown in FIG. 3. To assist easy<br>
understanding, the cartridges shown in FIG. 4 are not electrically connected with each<br>
other.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the battery pack 300 includes ten cartridges,<br>
which are connected in series with each other in an alternate 180-degree orientation<br>
manner. Specifically, electrode terminals 151 and 161 of a first cartridge 101 and<br>
electrode terminals 152 and 162 of a second cartridge 102 are arranged in opposite<br>
orientations. On the other hand, electrode terminals 153 and 163 of a third cartridge<br>
103 and the electrode terminals 151 and 161 of the first cartridge 101 are arranged in<br>
the same orientation. Also, electrode terminals 154 and 164 of a fourth cartridge 103<br>
and the electrode terminals 152 and 162 of the second cartridge 102 are arranged in<br>
the same orientation. Such alternate orientations of the electrode terminals are the<br>
same for all the cartridges. Consequently, the electrode terminals of the odd-numbered<br>
cartridges 101, 103, 105, 107, and 109 and the electrode terminals of the evennumbered<br>
cartridges 102, 104, 106, 108, and 110 are arranged in the alternate 180-<br>
degree orientation manner.<br>
management system (BMS), which is not shown in the drawings. The cathode<br>
terminal 151 of the first cartridge 101 is connected to the anode terminal 163 of the<br>
third cartridge 103 via a bus har 170. The cathode terminal 153 of the third cartridge<br>
103 is connected to the anode terminal 165 of the fifth cartridge 105. Consequently,<br>
the connection length between the terminals (for example, terminals 151 and 163) is<br>
greater by the thickness of at least one cartridge than that as in shown in FIG. 2. Also,<br>
the distance between the first terminal connection part 401 and the second terminal<br>
connection part 402 is greater by the thickness of at least one cartridge than that as in<br>
shown in FIG. 2. As described above, the connection length between the electrode<br>
terminals and the distance between the terminal connection parts are increased, and<br>
therefore, the connection of the electrode terminals is easily performed, and<br>
interference between the connection members is minimized.<br>
While the first cartridge 101, the third cartridge 103, the fifth cartridge 105,<br>
the seventh cartridge 107, and the ninth cartridge 109 are electrically connected with<br>
each other, the cathode terminal 159 of the fifth cartridge 109 is connected to the<br>
anode terminal 160 of the tenth cartridge 110, which is arranged in the orientation<br>
opposite to the cathode terminal 159 of the fifth cartridge 109. This connection is<br>
performed using a modified bus bar 171, which is elongated. The shape of the bus bar<br>
171 is not restricted so long as the ninth cartridge 109 and the tenth cartridge 110 are<br>
electrically connected with each other by the bus bar 171.<br>
The electrical connection between the tenth cartridge 110, the eighth cartridge<br>
108, the sixth cartridge 106, the fourth cartridge 104, and the second cartridge 102 are<br>
accomplished in the same manner as the above description. Finally, the cathode<br>
terminal 152 of the second cartridge 102 is connected to the BMS (not shown).<br>
Consequently, the terminal connection parts of the cartridges are distributed<br>
at the opposite sides of the battery pack 300, and therefore, the battery pack can be<br>
easily manufactured while a possibility of electric shock is significantly decreased.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various<br>
modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the<br>
scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As apparent from the above description, the battery pack according to the<br>
present invention is constructed such that the electrode terminals of the neighboring<br>
cartridges are arranged in an alternate 90-degree or more orientation manner,<br>
preferably, in an alternate ISO-degree orientation manner. Consequently, the<br>
connection length between the electrically connected terminals and the distance<br>
between the terminal connection parts are increased by the thickness of at least one<br>
cartridge, and therefore, the connection between the cartridges is easily performed<br>
while interference between the connection members is prevented. Furthermore, the<br>
terminal connection parts are not concentrated at one side of the battery pack, and<br>
therefore, a possibility of electric shock is significantly decreased.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
