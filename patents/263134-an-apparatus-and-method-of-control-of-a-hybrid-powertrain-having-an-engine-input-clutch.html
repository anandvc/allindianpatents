HYBRID POWERTRAIN WITH AN ENGINE INPUT<br>
CLUTCH AND METHOD OF CONTROL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a hybrid powertrain having an input clutch<br>
between an engine and an input member of a transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Hybrid powertrains include an engine, one or more motors useful for<br>
propulsion and an energy storage device to power the motor or motors. One type of<br>
hybrid powertrain is a hybrid electric powertrain, which includes an electric<br>
motor/generator and a battery as the energy storage device. Another type of hybrid<br>
powertrain is a fluid hybrid powertrain, such as a hydraulic hybrid, using one or more<br>
fluid motors and a fluid accumulator as the energy storage device.<br>
[0003]	A specific type of hybrid electric powertrain uses an electrically<br>
variable transmission incorporating one or more differential gear sets. Power from<br>
the engine and/or from the motor/generators flows through different members of the<br>
differential gear set. A controller may control torque-transmitting mechanisms in<br>
various engagement schemes to offer a combination of operating modes, including<br>
electrically-variable and fixed ratio modes.<br>
[0004]	Vehicle accessories, such as a transmission pump, an air conditioning<br>
compressor and a power steering pump, are often driven by the engine crankshaft in a<br>
conventional vehicle. On a hybrid vehicle, because the engine is intentionally<br>
stopped under some driving conditions, an alternate way of powering such vehicle<br>
accessories is necessary. For example, these accessories are sometimes provided with<br>
individual electric motors or with a common electric motor to run several accessories.<br><br>
2<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	It would be ideal to provide for alternative operation of the vehicle<br>
accessories from the engine or from the one or more motors already provided in the<br>
hybrid powertrain, while also providing for propulsion of the vehicle without turning<br>
the engine and for starting the engine without a separate starter motor and battery.<br>
[0006]	A hybrid powertrain has an engine, at least one motor operable for<br>
propulsion, an energy storage device to supply power to this motor and a mechanical<br>
transmission with an input member operating connected to the motor and to a vehicle<br>
accessory. The powertrain also has an input clutch that is disengagable to allow the<br>
transmission input member to rotate independently of engine speed and to power<br>
vehicle accessories otherwise driven by engine torque, while still allowing the engine<br>
to be started using motor power provided via the transmission input member.<br>
[0007]	Specifically, one embodiment of a powertrain with the scope of the<br>
invention includes a hybrid electro-mechanical transmission with an input clutch<br>
biased to an engaged state by a biasing member such as a spring. An actuating<br>
mechanism is operatively connected to a controller and is actuatable to selectively<br>
overcome biasing force of the biasing member to disengage the input clutch, thereby<br>
disconnecting the engine from the transmission. A vehicle accessory is operatively<br>
connected to the input member and may be driven by rotation of the input member<br>
via torque provided by the motor/generator when the input clutch is disengaged. The<br>
actuating mechanism may be hydraulically operated and the vehicle accessory may be<br>
a pump that provides the hydraulic pressure for actuating the actuating mechanism.<br>
Alternatively, the actuating mechanism may be an electrical actuator, such as a<br>
solenoid. In either case, a hydraulic accumulator may be operatively connected<br>
between the pump and the actuating mechanism to store hydraulic pressure (i.e.,<br>
energy) and may be controllable to maintain hydraulic pressure to the input clutch,<br>
and to other torque-transmitting mechanisms and for general lubrication and cooling<br>
requirements of the transmission when the input member is not rotating and therefore<br>
the pump is not operating.<br><br>
3<br>
[0008]	A method of controlling a hybrid vehicle powertrain is provided that<br>
includes starting the engine via torque from one or more motor/generators with the<br>
input clutch biased in an engaged position. At some point after the engine is started,<br>
it is determined that the vehicle operating conditions are more efficiently met by the<br>
motor/generator(s) without the engine, and the method includes disengaging the input<br>
clutch to disconnect the engine from the input member (and thereby from the<br>
transmission) so that torque is provided to the output member and to any vehicle<br>
accessories operatively connected to the input member only by the<br>
motor/generator(s). A second clutch, also referred to herein as a motor-connecting<br>
clutch or a lock-up clutch, may be provided and is selectively engaged to combine the<br>
torque of both motor/generator(s) at the output member in an electric-only drive<br>
mode.<br>
[0009]	If it is later determined that engine power is required to meet the<br>
operating demands placed on the powertrain, the method provides two alternative<br>
ways to restart the engine. First, the engine may be restarted by using torque of the<br>
motor/generator(s) to slow the input member and then by slipping the input clutch to<br>
gradually restart the engine. (If a pump is driven by the input member, a hydraulic<br>
accumulator may also be used to assist with transmission hydraulic needs if slowing<br>
the input member affects the output of the pump.) Alternatively, the input member<br>
may be stopped (rather than just slowed) by torque from the motor/generator. While<br>
the input member is stopped, hydraulic pressure may be maintained within the<br>
powertrain (including hydraulic pressure necessary to maintain the input clutch in a<br>
disengaged state, assuming a hydraulically-actuated actuating mechanism is used) by<br>
using energy stored in the hydraulic accumulator. While the input member is<br>
stopped, the input clutch is engaged and torque is then provided by the<br>
motor/generator(s) to rotate the input member and restart the engine.<br>
[0010]	In another embodiment of the invention, a hybrid powertrain includes<br>
an engine, a transmission having an input member operatively connectable to the<br>
engine, an output member for delivering power from the transmission, a motor<br>
operatively connectable to the input member and to the output member and capable of<br>
supplying torque to the output member for vehicle propulsion. An energy storage<br><br>
4<br>
device provides power to or receives power from the motor. The motor may be a<br>
motor/generator and the energy storage device an electric battery. Alternatively, the<br>
motor may be a fluid motor and the energy storage device an accumulator. The<br>
powertrain further includes both a first input clutch, also referred to as the friction<br>
clutch, that acts by friction and is operated by an actuator and a second input clutch<br>
that may act in parallel with the first input clutch and that, in a particular state, can<br>
transmit torque in one direction only (e.g., a one-way clutch or a selectable one-way<br>
clutch). The friction clutch may be used to start the engine, and the one-way clutch<br>
may carry a majority of the engine torque from the engine while the engine is<br>
running. Furthermore, if the one-way clutch is a selectable one-way clutch that offers<br>
a selection of states including either a locked state in which it can transmit torque in<br>
either direction of rotation or an opposite state in which it can carry torque to the<br>
engine, then it can be used to start the engine when the input member is also starting<br>
from rest, and the friction clutch (i.e., the first input clutch) could then be engaged to<br>
carry torque to restart the engine only when the input member is rotating with the<br>
engine stationary (and propulsion being via the motor). It should be understood that<br>
for clarity, the discussion of one-way clutches herein refers to rotation of the engine<br>
and the input member always in a forward direction, but that those skilled in the art<br>
may construct the invention for operation that includes reversed rotation.<br>
[0011]	Alternatively, the one-way clutch (i.e., the second input clutch) may<br>
have only one state (i.e., be able only to carry torque from the engine). In that case, a<br>
third input clutch, such as centrifugal clutch, may be used to transmit torque from the<br>
input member to the engine when the input member is substantially stationary to start<br>
the engine, then automatically disengaging due to centrifugal force when the input<br>
member 112 rotates at higher speeds.<br>
[0012]	Typically, the torque for starting the engine cold is roughly half of<br>
the maximum torque that can be developed by the running engine and the torque for<br>
restarting the engine is roughly a quarter of the maximum engine torque. Therefore<br>
the combination of first and second input clutches (and, optionally the third input<br>
clutch) in parallel reduces the maximum load on the friction clutch and reduces the<br>
actuating force that must be used to operate the friction clutch. Reduced actuating<br><br>
5<br>
force is easier to supply and to control precisely for smoother engine starting than<br>
with a higher capacity friction clutch.<br>
[0013]	The first input clutch may be a friction clutch that is selectively<br>
engaged by an actuator or a friction clutch that is engaged by a spring or other biasing<br>
member (i.e., normally in an engaged position) and disengaged by an actuator. The<br>
actuator may be hydraulic or electrical. The method of operation and control<br>
described above may be applied to this embodiment if having a first input (friction)<br>
clutch and a second input clutch if the friction clutch is engaged by a spring and<br>
disengaged by a hydraulic actuator.<br>
[0014]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

a powertrain within the scope of the invention, including an electrically-variable<br>
transmission and an input clutch biased into an engaged position by a spring;<br>
[0016]	FIGURE 2 is a schematic illustration of another exemplary<br>
embodiment of a powertrain within the scope of the invention, including a hybrid<br>

input clutch; and<br>
[0017]	FIGURE 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a<br>
powertrain.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018]	One representative form of a powertrain embodying the concepts of<br>
the present invention is depicted in Figure 1, and is designated generally by the<br>
numeral 10. The powertrain 10 includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission 11. It should be appreciated that many other embodiments<br>
of electro-mechanical transmissions may be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
The hybrid transmission 11 has an input member 12 that may be in the nature of a<br><br>
6<br>
shaft and may be directly driven by an engine 14 that is also part of the powertrain 10.<br>
In the embodiment depicted, the engine 14 may be a fossil fuel engine, such as an<br>
internal combustion engine or a diesel engine.<br>
[0019]	The hybrid transmission 11 utilizes three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and<br>
28, referred to herein collectively as a gearing arrangement. The first planetary gear<br>
set 24 has an outer gear member 30 that may generally be designated as the ring gear,<br>
which circumscribes an inner gear member 32, generally designated as the sun gear.<br>
A plurality of planet gear members 34 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 36 such that<br>
each planet gear member 34 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 30 and<br>
the inner gear member 32. The input member 12 is operatively connectable to the<br>
outer gear member 30 of the planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 11.<br>
[0020] The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer gear member 38,<br>
generally designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 40,<br>
generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gear members 42 are<br>
rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each planet gear 42 meshingly engages<br>
both the outer gear member 38 and the inner gear member 40.<br>
[0021]	The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer gear member 46,<br>
generally designated as the ring gear, which circumscribes an inner gear member 48,<br>
generally designated as the sun gear. A plurality of planet gear members 50 are<br>
rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each planet gear 50 meshingly engages<br>
both the outer gear member 46 and the inner gear member 48.<br>
[0022]	. !While all three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are "simple" planetary<br>
gear sets in their own right, the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are<br>
compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary gear set 24 is<br>
conjoined, as through a hub member 54, to the outer gear member 38 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear member 32 of the first planetary gear<br>
set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of the second planetary gear set 26 are<br>
continuously connected to a first motor/generator 56.<br><br>
7<br>
[0023]	The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined, as through a shaft 60, to the<br>
carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44 of the first<br>
and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are conjoined. The shaft 60 is<br>
also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28, as<br>
through a torque-transmitting mechanism 62, also referred to herein as clutch C2.<br>
[0024]	The carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to<br>
the transmission output member 64. When the hybrid transmission 11 is used in a<br>
land vehicle, the output member 64 may be connected to the vehicular axles (not<br>
shown) that may, in turn, terminate in the drive members (also not shown). The drive<br>
members may be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on which they are<br>
employed, or they may be the drive gear of a track vehicle.<br>
[0025]	The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28, as through a<br>
sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The sleeve shaft 66 is also continuously<br>
connected to a second motor/generator 72. The outer gear member 46 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground, represented by the<br>
transmission housing 68, through a torque-transmitting mechanism 70, also referred<br>
to herein as clutch CI, which is a stationary clutch or brake.<br>
[0026]	Torque-transmitting mechanism 71, which is also referred to herein as<br>
an input clutch C5, is selectively engagable to transfer engine torque from an engine<br>
output shaft 18 to the input member 12 and the first planetary gear set 24;<br>
specifically, from the input member 12 to the ring gear member 30. A biasing<br>
member 69 biases clutch 71 in an engaged position. In this embodiment, the biasing<br>
member 69 is a spring; however, other types of biasing members, including members<br>
having a magnetically or pneumatically applied biasing force may be utilized. All the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as the two motor/generators 56 and 72 are<br>
coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. Both motor/generators 56<br>
and 72 are of an annular configuration which permits them to circumscribe the three<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are<br>
disposed radially inward of the motor/generators 56 and 72. This configuration<br><br>
8<br>
assures that the overall envelope-i.e., the circumferential dimension-of the<br>
transmission 11 is minimized.<br>
[0027]	A torque-transmitting mechanism 73, also referred to herein as C3,<br>
which is a stationary clutch or brake, selectively connects the sun gears 40 and 48<br>
with ground (i.e., with transmission housing 68). A torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
75, referred to herein as a second clutch, a lock-up clutch or a motor-connecting<br>
clutch, an identified as C4, is operative when engaged to lock planetary gear sets 24,<br>
26, motors 56, 72 and the input members 12 for common rotation as a group, by<br>
selectively connecting the sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 62, 70, 71, 73, 75 are all friction clutches.<br>
[0028]	Two members of differential gear sets 26 and 28 are operatively<br>
connectable to the output member 64 for rotation at two different speeds, each of the<br>
speeds being proportional to the speed of the output member 64. Specifically,<br>
engagement of clutch 70 operatively connects the sun gear members 40 and 48 to the<br>
output member 64. The speed of the sun gear members 40 and 48 is proportional to<br>
the speed of the output member as a function of the ratio of the number of teeth of the<br>
ring gear member 46 and the sun gear member 48 of the gear set 28. Engagement of<br>
clutch 62 connects shaft 60 with the output member 64, causing carrier members 36<br>
and 44 to rotate at the same speed as the output member 64.<br>
[0029]	As should be apparent from the foregoing description, and with<br>
particular reference to FIG. 1, the transmission 11 selectively receives power from the<br>
engine 14. As will now be explained, the hybrid transmission 11 also receives power<br>
from an electric storage device 74 through one or both of the motor/generators 56, 72.<br>
The electric storage device 74 may be one or more batteries but will be referred to<br>
herein as a battery. Other electric storage devices that have the ability to store electric<br>
power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries without<br>
altering the concepts of the present invention.<br>
[0030]	The electric storage device 74 communicates with a controller 76, also<br>
referred to as an electronic control unit by transfer conductors 78A and 78B. The<br>
controller 76 communicates with the first motor/generator 56 by transfer conductors<br>
78C and 78D, and the controller 76 similarly communicates with the second<br><br>
9<br>
motor/generator 72 by transfer conductors 78E and 78F. Additionally, the controller<br>
76 communicates with a valve body 79 via transfer conductor 78G to control<br>
selective engagement or disengagement of torque transmitting devices 62, 70, 71, 73<br>
and 75 via hydraulic fluid pressure, as is understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
Selective engagement of the torque-transmitting mechanisms 62, 70, 71, 73 and 75<br>
along with control of the speed and torque of the motor/generators 56, 72 determines<br>
the operating mode of the transmission 11.<br>
[0031]	Sensors, designated generally as 81, may be operatively connected<br>
with the torque transmitting devices 62, 70, 71, 73 and 75 to provide, via transfer<br>
conductors, designated generally as 78H, sensed characteristics to the controller 76,<br>
such as temperature, torque load and relative speed of clutch plates.<br>
[0032]	A drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input member 12 to the outer gear<br>
member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24 (when input clutch 71 is engaged), and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
motor/generators 56 and/or 72. The drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82<br>
which, in turn, meshingly engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a<br>
shaft 86. The other end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a vehicle accessory 88. In<br>
this embodiment, the vehicle accessory is a transmission fluid pump; it should be<br>
understood, however, that within the scope of the invention, the vehicle accessory 88<br>
may represent an air conditioning compressor, a power steering pump, or any other<br>
vehicle accessory that can be driven by rotation. The pump 88 receives fluid from a<br>
sump in the transmission 11 and supplies fluid to valves in the valve body 79 which<br>
are under the control of the controller 76. The details of the valve body 79 are not<br>
shown for purposes of simplicity and clarity in Figure 1, but those skilled in the art<br>
will readily understand such a configuration.<br>
[0033]	The operator of the vehicle has three, well-known, primary devices to<br>
control the transmission 11. One of the primary control devices is a well-known<br>
drive range selector (not shown) that directs the controller 76 to configure the<br>
transmission 11 for either the park, reverse, neutral, or forward drive range. The<br>
second and third primary control devices constitute an accelerator pedal (not shown)<br>
and a brake pedal (also not shown). The information obtained by the controller 76<br><br>
10<br>
from these three primary control sources will hereinafter be referred to as the<br>
"operator demand." The controller 16 also obtains information from both the first and<br>
second motor/generators 56 and 72, respectively, the engine 14 and the electric<br>
storage device 74. In response to an operator's action, the controller 76 determines<br>
what is required and then manipulates the selectively-operated components of the<br>
hybrid transmission 11 appropriately to respond to the operator demand. The<br>
selectively-operated components are the engine 14, the motor/generators 56, 72,<br>
valves in the valve body 79 and the torque-transmitting mechanisms 62, 70, 71, 73<br>
and 75,<br>
[0034]	To reiterate, the transmission 11 is a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical, vehicular transmission. In other words, the output member 64<br>
receives power through two distinct alternative operative arrangements of gear trains<br>
within the transmission 11. A first electrically-variable mode is established when<br>
clutch 71 is engaged and the clutch 70 is engaged in order to "ground" the outer gear<br>
member 46 of the third planetary gear set 28. A second electrically-variable mode is<br>
selected when clutch 71 remains engaged, the clutch 70 is released and the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism 62 is simultaneously engaged to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28.<br>
[0035]	As used herein, a "mode" is a particular operative mechanical<br>
arrangement, whether enabling a continuous range of speed ratios or only a fixed<br>
speed ratio, which is achieved in this embodiment by engagement of a particular<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism or torque-transmitting mechanisms 62, 70, 71, 73 and<br>
75. In each electrically-variable mode, the speed ratio through the transmission is<br>
controlled by the speed and torque of the motor/generators 56 and 72.<br>
[0036]	Assuming clutch 71 is engaged, a first electrically-variable mode is<br>
achieved by engagement of clutch 70. A second electrically-variable mode is<br>
achieved by engagement of clutch 62. When the additional clutch is applied (i.e.,<br>
when two clutching mechanisms are applied), a fixed input to output speed ratio is<br>
achieved. The rotations of the motor/generators 56, 72, will then be dependent on<br>
internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the<br>
input speed. The motor/generators 56 and 72 can still function as motors or<br><br>
11<br>
generators; however, they are completely independent of engine to output power<br>
flow, thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during acceleration in the first fixed<br>
ratio that the engine power and both units functioning as motors accepting power<br>
from the energy storage device 74 to be additive into propelling the vehicle through<br>
planetary gear set 28 to output 64.<br>
[0037]	The transmission can at any time be switched from operation in fixed<br>
ratio mode to an electrically-variable mode by turning the additional clutch off during<br>
a fixed ratio of operation. Determination of operation in fixed ratio mode or an<br>
electrically-variable mode is made by algorithms in the controller 76 controlling the<br>
transmission 11.<br>
[0038]	A first fixed ratio mode falls within the first electrically-variable mode<br>
of operation when CI, C4 and C5 (clutches 70, 71 and 75) are engaged, and a second<br>
fixed ratio range falls within the first electrically-variable mode of operation when<br>
CI, C2 and C5 (clutches 62, 70 and 71) are engaged. A third fixed ratio range is<br>
available during the second electrically-variable mode of operation when C2, C4 and<br>
C5 (clutches 62, 71 and 75) are engaged, and a fourth fixed ratio range is available<br>
during the second electrically-variable mode of operation when C2, C3 and C5<br>
(clutches 62, 71 and 73) are engaged.<br>
[0039]	In the electrically-variable modes and fixed ratio modes described<br>
above, C5 (clutch 71) is engaged and the engine 14 is connected for rotation with the<br>
input member 12. Under certain predetermined operating conditions of the<br>
powertrain 10, such as during highway cruising, it may be desirable to disconnect the<br>
engine 14 from the input member 12 and provide power using only one or both of the<br>
motor/generators (powered via the storage device 74) in an electric-only mode. In<br>
that case, an actuating mechanism may be actuated to overcome the bias of the<br>
biasing member 69 and disengage clutch 71. The actuating mechanism may be a<br>
hydraulically-applied piston 90 movable via hydraulic pressure selectively routed to<br>
the clutch 71 via valves in valve body 79 under the control of controller 76. The<br>
hydraulic pressure necessary to move the piston 90 may be delivered from the pump<br>
88, assuming the input member 12 is rotating to drive the pump 88. A hydraulic<br><br>
12<br>
accumulator 91 is in fluid communication with the pump 88 to store pressurized fluid<br>
so that hydraulic pressure is maintained in the powertrain 10 when the input member<br>
12 is not rotating and therefore not driving pump 88. When the input member 12 is<br>
not rotating and the controller 76 recognizes certain predetermined conditions and so<br>
determines that it is necessary to disengage the clutch 71, the controller 76 controls<br>
valves within the valve body 79 to direct fluid from the accumulator 91 to the piston<br>
90. The accumulator 91 is also in fluid communication with the other torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 62, 70, 73 and 75 (fluid connections not shown in Figure 1)<br>
so that they may be selectively engaged and disengaged via hydraulic pressure even<br>
when the input member 12 is not driving pump 88.<br>
[0040]	An electric actuator such as a solenoid 90A, shown in phantom, is an<br>
alternative actuating mechanism that may be provided in lieu of hydraulically-applied<br>
piston 90. The solenoid 90A is in signal communication with the controller 76 for<br>
receiving electrical actuating signals therefrom. Even if the solenoid 90A is used<br>
instead of hydraulic piston 90, the accumulator 91 may still be used to provide<br>
hydraulic pressure to the other torque-transmitting mechanisms 62, 70, 73 and 75,<br>
assuming they use hydraulically-actuated activating mechanisms, and for lubricating<br>
and cooling the transmission 11.<br>
[0041]	Referring to Figure 2, another embodiment of a powertrain 110 is<br>
depicted having an engine 114 and a hybrid transmission 111 with an input member<br>
112 and an output member 164. A vehicle accessory 188 is connected for common<br>
rotation with the input member 112 and may be operatively driven by the input<br>
member 112. A motor 156 is operatively connected to the input member and to the<br>
output member 164. The motor 156 is operable to provide torque to the output<br>
member 164 for propulsion of a vehicle having the powertrain 110. An optional<br>
gearing arrangement 124 is used to provide a gear ratio between the motor 156 and<br>
the output member 164, and may include any type of gears such as one or more<br>
planetary gear sets- or a countershaft gear arrangement as well as selectively engagable<br>
torque-transmitting devices to achieve various gear ratios. Although not shown, a<br>
gearing arrangement may also be included between the input member 112 and the<br>
motor 156 and/or between the input member 112 and the accessory 188.<br><br>
13<br>
Additionally, although only one motor 156 is shown, an additional motor may be<br>
included, and the gear arrangement 124 may be similar to that of the powertrain 10 of<br>
Figure 1.<br>
[0042]	The motor 156 is operatively connected to an energy storage device<br>
174 through a controller 176. The motor 156 may be an electric motor/generator, in<br>
which case the energy storage device 174 is an electric storage battery. In such an<br>
embodiment, operative connection between the controller 176 and the energy storage<br>
device 174 and between the controller 176 and the motor 156 would be through a<br>
power inverter (not shown).<br>
[0043]	Alternatively, the motor 156 may be a fluid motor (e.g., a pneumatic or<br>
hydraulic pump), in which case the energy storage device 174 is an accumulator<br>
(pneumatic or hydraulic, in correspondence with the fluid motor type). Regardless of<br>
whether the motor 156 is an electric motor/generator or a fluid motor, the controller<br>
176 causes it to store energy (electric, hydraulic or pneumatic) in the energy storage<br>
device under certain predetermined operating conditions and receive stored energy<br>
from the energy storage device under other predetermined operating conditions.<br>
[0044]	An engine output member 118 is selectively connectable to the input<br>
member 112 via engagement of one or both of a parallel input clutch combination that<br>
includes first input clutch 171 and second input clutch 177. The first input clutch 171<br>
is a friction clutch that is selectively engagable to connect the engine 114 with the<br>
input member 112. The first input clutch 171 may be biased into an engaged position<br>
via a biasing force or biasing member such as spring 169 and then selectively<br>
disengageable via an actuating mechanism 190. The actuating mechanism 190 may<br>
be an electrically actuated piston or solenoid, or an hydraulically actuated piston,<br>
under the control of the controller 176, as described above with respect to piston 90<br>
(and alternative piston<br>
90A) in Figure 1.<br>
[0045]	The second input clutch 177 is selectively engagable to transmit torque<br>
in only one direction of rotation, i.e., a one-way state. Optionally, the second input<br>
clutch 177 is also selectively controllable to be engaged either in an opposite state in<br>
which it is able to carry torque in the opposite direction of rotation only or in a locked<br><br>
14<br>
state in which it is able to carry torque in either direction (i.e., both directions) of<br>
rotation. Those skilled in the art will readily understand the functioning of selectable<br>
one-way clutches having an opposite or locked state.<br>
[0046]	Thus, a method of operating the transmission 111 includes selectively<br>
engaging the first input clutch 171 to start the engine 114 via power from the motor<br>
156. Once started, the second input clutch 177 is engaged (in the one-way state) to<br>
transmit torque from the engine 114 to the input member 171, thus decreasing the<br>
amount of torque carried by the first input clutch 171. A decreased amount of torque<br>
carried by first input clutch 171 allows a decrease in the actuating force necessary to<br>
engage the first input clutch 171 (assuming that a biasing mechanism 169 is not used<br>
to bias the first input clutch 171 into an engaged position).<br>
[0047]	The transmission 111 may be controlled by the controller 176 such that<br>
the first input clutch 171 is engaged to restart the engine 114 when the input member<br>
112 is rotating and the second input clutch (assuming it has an opposite or locked<br>
state) is used to start the engine when the input member 112 is not rotating (i.e., a cold<br>
start). For example, the first input clutch 171 is used to restart the engine 114 when<br>
the controller determines that the input member 112 is rotating and that predetermined<br>
conditions exist that Warrant use if the engine 114 for propulsion. The second input<br>
clutch 177 is selectively engaged in the locked state so that it may carry torque from<br>
the input member to the engine 114 when the controller 176 determines that the<br>
engine 114 should be started and that the input member 112 is not rotating (i.e., the<br>
controller 176 receives an operator command for a cold start of the engine 114 (that<br>
is, a start of the engine after some period in which the transmission is not being<br>
operated). Alternately, if the second input clutch does not have an opposite or locked<br>
state, it may be desirable to have a third input clutch 192 that is selectively engaged in<br>
the locked state when the input member 112 is not rotating automatically without<br>
action of the controller 176 by any of a number of mechanical arrangements using<br>
centrifugal force generated by rotation of the input member 112, as will be readily<br>
understood by those skilled in the art. For example, the third input clutch 192 shown<br>
in Figure 2 is a centrifugally unlocking clutch that is normally engaged to lock the<br>
input member 112 to the engine output member 118 when the input member 112 is<br><br>
15<br>
substantially stationary, allowing torque from the motor 156 to start the engine 114,<br>
but then disengages due to centrifugal force when the input member 112 rotates at a<br>
speed greater then some predetermined minimum speed at which the third input clutch<br>
192 is designed to automatically disengage. "Substantially stationary" means that the<br>
input members 112 is not rotating or is rotating at a very low speed less than the<br>
predetermined minimum speed at which the third input clutch 192 is designed to<br>
disengage by centrifugal force.<br>
[0048]	Referring to Figure 3, a method 200 of controlling a powertrain is illustrated<br>
and will be described herein with respect to the powertrain 10 of Figure 1. The method 200<br>
involves engagement and disengagement of the input clutch 71 under various operating<br>
conditions.<br>
[0049]	Under step 204, the engine 14 is started via torque provided by the<br>
motor/generator 56 with the input clutch 71 biased to an engaged state via biasing member<br>
69. Under operator demand for certain speed and/or acceleration conditions, it is more<br>
efficient to power the output member 64 using only torque from one or both motor/generators<br>
56, 72 and not from the engine 14 (i.e., an electric-only mode). Under those conditions, the<br>
method 200 moves to step 206, in which the controller 76 commands the actuating<br>
mechanism (whether the hydraulic actuator 90 or the solenoid 90A) to actuate, thereby<br>
disengaging clutch 71 to disconnect the engine 14 from the transmission 11.<br>
[0050]	At some point after the engine is disconnected, operator demand for other<br>
conditions, such as acceleration, may require torque from the engine 14 in addition to torque<br>
from one or both of the motor/generators 56, 72. Under such conditions, the method 200<br>
provides two alternative ways to restart the engine 14. The first set of steps that result in a<br>
restart of the engine are steps 208 and 210 (and optionally step 214). Under step 208, torque<br>
from the motor/generator 56 is applied to slow the rotational speed of the input member 12.<br>
When the input member 12 has been slowed to a predetermined speed, then under step 210,<br>
clutch 71 is slipped to restart the engine 14. As used herein, a "slipping" clutch is a clutch<br>
that is only partially engaged, so that it transfers torque at a controlled rate rather than more<br>
abruptly with an immediate, full engagement. By slipping clutch 71, the engine output shaft<br>
18 is gradually brought to the speed of the transmission input member 12.<br><br>
16<br>
[0051]	Because slowing of the input member 12 under step 208 slows rotation of the<br>
pump 88, it is necessary to provide hydraulic pressure to the powertrain 10 by alternative<br>
means. One alternative is provided in step 212, in which stored pressure in the hydraulic<br>
accumulator 91 is used to maintain hydraulic pressure within the powertrain 10 during steps<br>
208 and 210. In a powertrain embodiment in which the hydraulically-actuated actuator 90 is<br>
used, step 212 includes substep 214, maintaining hydraulic pressure to the input clutch 71 to<br>
maintain the disengaged state (or at least the partially disengaged state as determined by the<br>
amount of slip under step 210) overcoming the bias of the biasing member 69.<br>
[0052]	As an alternative to slowing the input member 12 and slipping the input clutch<br>
71 to restart the engine 14 under steps 208 and 210, the input member 12 may be completely<br>
stopped by applying torque from the motor/generator 56 under step 216. In that case, in the<br>
powertrain embodiment having the hydraulically-actuated actuator 90, the method 200<br>
includes step 212 and step 214, as described above. After the input member is stopped under<br>
step 216, the method 200 also includes engaging the input clutch 71 under step 218 and then,<br>
under step 220, starting rotation of the input member 12 via torque from the motor/generator<br>
56 to restart the engine 14 through the engaged clutch 71.<br>
[0053]	After the input clutch 12 is disengaged in step 206, it may be advantageous<br>
under some operating conditions to combine the torque of both motor/generators 56 and 72 to<br>
rotate the output member 64. Under step 222, the motor-connecting clutch 75 is engaged to<br>
lock the motor/generators 56, 72 for rotation at the same speed, as described above. If clutch<br>
70 is also engaged, torque is provided to the output member 64 using the speed reduction<br>
ratio provided by planetary gear set 28.<br>
[0054]	Thus, by providing the powertrain 10 with the input clutch 71 having a biasing<br>
member 69 and an actuating mechanism (piston 90 or solenoid 90A) to disengage the clutch<br>
71, a vehicle accessory 88 can still be driven by the motor/generator(s) 56 and 72 when the<br>
engine 14 is disconnected from the input member 12. A hydraulic accumulator 91 allows<br>
necessary hydraulic pressure to be provided when the pump 88 is not functioning due to a<br>
stopped or slowed input member 12. The motor-connecting clutch 75 allows for a combined<br>
torque from the motor/generators 56, 72 to power the output member 64 independent of<br>
engine speed when the clutch 71 is disengaged.<br><br>
17<br>
[0055]	Although the method 200 is described with respect to the powertrain 10 of<br>
Figure 1, it should be appreciated that the powertrain 110 of Figure 2 may be controlled to<br>
operate according to the method 200, if the first input clutch 171 is biased in an engaged<br>
position by spring 169 and if actuating mechanism 190 is a hydraulic actuator such that the<br>
first input clutch 171 is disengaged by hydraulic pressure.<br>

detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
