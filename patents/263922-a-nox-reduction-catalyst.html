				<td>Ce-Zr-R-0 CATALYSTS, ARTICLES COMPRISING THE Ce-Zr-R-0 CATALYSTS<br>
AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE Ce-Zr-R-0 CATALYSTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to catalysts, particularly selective<br>
catalytic reduction catalysts comprising cerium, zirconium, and manganese and/or<br>
tungsten, and methods of making and using the same.<br>
[0002] Up coming emission regulations are driving original equipment<br>
manufacturers (OEMs) to incorporate after treatment devices, e.g., exhaust emission<br>
control devices, into the exhaust systems in order to comply with these regulations.<br>
These exhaust emission control devices could include: catalytic converters (e.g., three-<br>
way catalyst, oxidation catalysts, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts, and the<br>
like), evaporative emissions devices, scrubbing devices (e.g., hydrocarbon (HC), sulfur,<br>
and the like), particulate filters/traps, adsorbers/absorbers, plasma reactors (e.g., non-<br>
thermal plasma reactors), and the like.<br>
[0003] A major challenge in meeting the future diesel emission<br>
requirements is treating the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) due to the inherently lean exhaust<br>
air-to-fuel ratio. One method of treating the NOx is the use of SCR catalysts that use<br>
ammonia as the reducing agent. Currently, ammonia is produced on-board a vehicle by<br>
injecting aqueous urea into the hot exhaust gas, upstream of the SCR catalyst. The urea<br>
decomposes to ammonia in the exhaust system and is used by the SCR catalyst to react<br>
with the NOx. The desirable reaction comprises ammonia NH3, nitrogen oxides (NOx),<br>
and oxygen (O2) being converted to nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) in the presence of<br>
the catalyst.<br>
[0004] Exhaust systems designed in an attempt to meet the emission<br>
regulations tend to be complex and highly temperature sensitive. As a result of the<br>
temperature sensitivity, many of the components of the system require specific<br>
locations in the exhaust system to inhibit deactivation of the component (i.e., of the<br>
catalyst in the component), and to attain and retain the catalyst operating temperature.<br>
[0005] What is continuously needed in the art are simplified systems<br>
and/or catalysts that have a wider operating range and therefore enable greater<br>
flexibility in the exhaust system design.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Disclosed herein are NOx reduction catalysts, particulate filters,<br>
exhaust treatment systems, and methods of treating a gas stream.<br>
[0007] In one embodiment, a NOx reduction catalyst comprises<br>
Cea-Zrb-Rc.-Ad-Me-Ox. "R" is W and/or Mn. If "R" is W, "A" is selected from the<br>
group consisting of Mo, Ta, Nb, and combinations comprising at least one of the<br>
foregoing "A", and if "R" is Mn, "A" is selected from the group consisting of W, Mo,<br>
Ta, Nb, and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing "A". "M" is a<br>
trivalent rare earth ion. a + b + c + d + e = 1. "a" is about 0.1 to about 0.6; "b" is about<br>
0.25 to about 0.7; "c" is about 0.02 to about 0.5; and if "R" is Mn, "d" is about 0.04 to<br>
about 0.2, and if "R" is W, "d" is less than or equal to about 0.2; while "e" is less than<br>
or equal to about 0.15. The NOx reduction catalyst is capable of reducing NOx.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a particulate filter comprises a shell and a<br>
filter element for removing particulate matter from a gas stream. The filter element is<br>
disposed within the shell and comprises a NOx reduction catalyst.<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, a method for treating a gas stream comprises<br>
introducing the gas stream to a NOx reduction catalyst, and reducing greater than or<br>
equal to about 50 vol% of the NOx in the gas stream, based upon a total volume of the<br>
NOx initially in the gas stream, wherein the gas stream has a temperature of about<br>
150°C to about 550°C.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, a method of treating a gas stream<br>
comprises: introducing exhaust gas to a particulate filter without treating the exhaust<br>
gas with an oxidation catalyst, passing the exhaust gas directly from the particulate<br>
filter through an optional SCR, and then directly venting the exhaust gas to the<br>
environment. If the SCR is present, the SCR and/or the particulate filter comprises a<br>
NOx reduction catalyst, and if the SCR is not present, the particulate filter comprises<br>
the NOx reduction catalyst.<br>
[0011] In one embodiment, a NOx treatment system comprises: a<br>
particulate filter disposed to be capable of receiving exhaust gas that has not been<br>
treated with an oxidation catalyst, and, optionally, a SCR catalyst disposed downstream<br>
and in direct fluid communication with the particulate filter for receiving the gas<br>
directly from the particulate filter, and a vent to the environment in direct fluid<br>
communication with the SCR, if present, or with the particulate filter if the SCR is not<br>
present. If the SCR is present, the SCR and/or the particulate filter comprises a NOx<br><br>
reduction catalyst, and if the SCR is not present, the particulate filter comprises the<br>
NOx reduction catalyst.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment, a method for making a NOx catalyst,<br>
comprises: dissolving cerium salt to form a first acidic solution, dissolving zirconium<br>
salt to form a second acidic solution, and dissolving a salt of "R", wherein, if "R" is<br>
Mn, "R" is dissolved to form a third acidic solution, and if "R" is W, "R" is dissolved<br>
to form a first basic solution. If "R" is Mn, a salt of "A" is dissolved to form a second<br>
basic solution, wherein "A" is selected from the group consisting of W, Mo, Ta, Nb,<br>
and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing A. The first acidic solution<br>
and second acidic solution, and, if present, the second basic solution, and if present, the<br>
third acidic solution, and if present, the first basic solution, are mixed to form a<br>
precipitate that is dried and calcined to form the catalyst.<br>
[0013] The above-described and other features will be appreciated and<br>
understood by those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, drawings,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] Unmodified manganese catalysts have a narrow window for<br>
ammonia SCR because at moderate temperatures (e.g., 300°C); these catalyst begin to<br>
oxidize NH3 unselectively to NOx. Titania was a logical element to try because is not<br>
volatile at high temperatures, but it doesn't work well with manganese. With respect to<br>
tungsten, it seemed unlikely to work since it tends to be volatile at high temperature.<br>
For example, V-W-Ti-O catalysts where W(VI) is supported on the surface of anatase<br>
titania suffers from the fact that WO3 can volatilize at temperatures of about 600°C. In<br>
addition, WO3 is volatile when supported on alumina. So, Mn-W-Al-O catalysts are<br>
not expected to be viable after high temperature aging.<br>
[0025] Although, to our knowledge, there are no reports of tungsten in<br>
oxide systems with a coordination number greater than 6, a tungsten fluorite structure<br>
was sought. In fluorite, if all atoms are at normal crystallographic positions, metal<br>
atoms are coordinated by 8 oxygen atoms, with the metal atom at the center of a cube<br>
of 8 oxygen atoms.<br>
[0026] Some embodiments of the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 compositions (e.g.,<br>
the Ce-Zr-Mn-W-0 catalyst, and the Ce-Zr-W-0 catalyst) seemed to solve one or more<br>
of the above problems. The temperature window expanded, and no evidence of<br>
tungsten volatility at 850°C and 950°C was found. As oppose to merely an intimate<br>
mixture of WO3 with another oxide, it is believed that our composition is a new<br>
compound. The fact that tungsten appears to go into the fluorite structure in the present<br>
compositions is unprecedented. Further, the simultaneous presence of Ce-Zr-Mn-A-0<br>
(wherein A is W, Nb, Ta, and/or Mo) in a fluorite is also unprecedented, as is the<br>
simultaneous presence of Ce-Zr-W-A-0 (wherein A, which is optional, is Nb, Ta,<br><br>
and/or Mo) in a fluorite. Not to be bound by theory, for tungsten, the fluorite structure<br>
is believed to be significant because, unlike alumina (either spinel γ-Al2O3 or corundum<br>
OC-Al2O3) or titania (either anatase or rutile) or silica (whether as a zeolite, or<br>
amorphous silica, or quartz) the fluorite structure accommodates tungsten atoms in<br>
lattice positions. In the other oxides, the tungsten is merely mixed with the oxide and<br>
not part of the lattice.<br>
[0027] The Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst, e.g., a mesoporous Ce-Zr-Mn-A-<br>
M-0 fluorite catalyst (optionally comprising both fluorite and M11WO4 phases), is a<br>
NOx reduction catalyst, that can attain NOx reduction light-off temperatures of about<br>
150°C, with NOx conversion at about 150°C to about 300°C, and thermal stability up<br>
to and exceeding about 850°C. As used herein, a material is "mesoporous" if greater<br>
than or equal to 50% of its pore volume is in pores having a size (as measured along a<br>
major axis) of 2 nanometers (nm) to 50 nm. This catalyst is particularly useful for NOx<br>
reduction and is capable of reducing the NOx without the need for a precious metal<br>
catalyst (e.g., without the need to convert some of the NO to NO2). Two common<br>
mechanisms for catalytic reduction of NOx, known as the "Standard Reaction" and the<br>
"Fast Reaction," are:<br>
4NO + 4NH3 + O2 → 4N2 + 6H2O	Standard Reaction<br>
2NO + 2NO2 + 4NH3 → 4N2 + 6H2O	Fast Reaction<br>
When the "Standard Reaction" attains better results, a catalyst for forming N02 is not<br>
needed; e.g., no precious metal (e.g., platinum) catalyst is needed with or upstream of<br>
the NOx catalyst. The catalyst can be employed as a downstream SCR device, e.g., and<br>
underfloor catalyst or disposed after a particulate filter, or can be combined with the<br>
particulate filter to reduce NOx and also eliminate soot.<br>
[0028] If the SCR device is downstream of the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst<br>
that functions as a particulate filter, the SCR catalyst may be any of various materials<br>
known to reduce NOx with ammonia, such as zeolites containing copper or iron, or<br>
vanadia (optionally with tungsta or molybdena) supported on anatase titania. In<br>
another embodiment the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst can be disposed in the SCR,<br>
downstream of a particulate filter.<br>
[0029] The catalyst formula is Cea-Zrb-Rc-Ad-Me-Ox. The subscripts a,<br>
b, c, d, e, and x, represent atomic fractions, subject to the proviso that (a + b + c + d + e<br>
= 1). In addition, the value of "a" can be about 0.1 to about 0.6, or, more specifically,<br><br>
about 0.25 to about 0.5, and even more specifically, about 0.3 to about 0.4. "b" can be<br>
about 0.25 to about 0.7, or, more specifically, about 0.3 to about 0.6, and even more<br>
specifically, about 0.35 to about 0.5. "c" can be about 0.02 to about 0.5, or, more<br>
specifically, about 0.1 to about 0.4, and even more specifically, about 0.2 to about 0.35,<br>
or, in some embodiments 0.05 to about 0.2. When "R" is Mn, "d" can be about 0.04 to<br>
about 0.2, or, more specifically, about 0.05 to about 0.15, and even more specifically,<br>
about 0.07 to about 0.12. When "R" is W, "d" can be less than or equal to about 0.2,<br>
or, more specifically, about 0.04 to about 0.2, yet more specifically, about 0.05 to about<br>
0.15, and even more specifically, about 0.07 to about 0.12. "e" can be less than or<br>
equal to about 0.15, or, more specifically, about 0.03 to about 0.1. The precise value<br>
for "x" (and therefore the precise value for 6)depends on the type of metal component,<br>
its charge, atomic fraction, and the requirement that the metal oxide have a neutral<br>
overall charge. Examples of the catalyst include, for example, Ceo.35-Zro.35-Mno.25-<br>
W0.05-O; Ce0.3o-Zro.3o-Mno.30-Wo.1-0; and Ceo.45-Zr0.45W0.i-O2+δ.<br>
[0030] "R" is Mn or W. If "R" is Mn, "A" comprises W, Mo, Ta, and<br>
Nb, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing. If R is W, A,<br>
which is optional, comprises Mo, Ta, and Nb, as well as combinations comprising at<br>
least one of the foregoing. "M", which is optional, comprises trivalent rare earth ion(s)<br>
(e.g., dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er), ytterbium (Yb), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er),<br>
thulium (Tm), lanthanum (La), yttrium (Y), lutetium (La), samarium (Sm), and<br>
gadolinium (Gd), as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing. In<br>
some embodiments, the catalyst is free of La and Y. As defined herein, "free" means<br>
that La and Y were not added to the catalyst, but may exist as an impurity in a reagent<br>
used to make the catalyst.<br>
[0031] The Cea-Zrb-Rc-Ad-Me-Ox catalyst can be formed in various<br>
fashions. For example, water soluble salts of cerium, zirconium, "M", and "R" (if "R"<br>
is Mn), can be prepared in a sufficiently acidic solution to dissolve the salts (e.g., a<br>
slightly acidic solutions, such as a pH of less than or equal to about 2.0, or, more<br>
specifically, a pH of about 0.5 to about 2.0). For W, however, (when "R" is W), a<br>
water soluble salt of the tungsten, preferably a sodium tungstate or ammonium<br>
tungstate is prepared, e.g., by dissolving the salt in water to give a solution with a pH of<br>
about 7.5 to about 10.0, or, more specifically, about 7.5 to about 9.0. A salt (e.g., a<br>
sodium and/or ammonium salt) of "A" can be dissolved into the basic solution (e.g.,<br>
having a pH of about 7.5 to about 10.0). For example, for the cerium, zirconium, "R"<br><br>
(when "R" is Mn), and "M", the salts can be nitrates, acetates, and/or chlorides<br>
(preferably nitrates and/or acetates), with nitric acid or acetic acid being suitable acids<br>
for acidifying this solution. For "A" and "R" (when "R" is W), the salt can be alkali or<br>
ammonium salts (preferably sodium salts), with sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, or tetraalkylammonium hydroxide optionally present for maintaining a<br>
suitably basic solution.<br>
[0032] The salts can separately be dissolved in the appropriate solutions<br>
and then combined. Alternatively, the acidic solutions can be formed as one solution<br>
and the basic solutions can be formed as one solution. In one example, cerium (III)<br>
nitrate hydrate can be dissolved in water without additional acid, e.g., to yield a<br>
solution with a pH of about 1.2 to about 1.4. Zirconyl nitrate hydrate can be dissolved<br>
in water with a bit of nitric acid, e.g., to yield a solution with a pH of about 0.7, while<br>
manganese nitrate can be dissolved without extra acid, e.g., to yield a solution with a<br>
pH of about 1.4. These solutions can, optionally, be initially combined for form a<br>
single acidic solution for combination with the basic solution(s), or each can be<br>
combined directly with the basic solution(s) in a single step. With respect to the basic<br>
solution, Na2WO4, for example, can be dissolved without extra base, e.g., to yield a<br>
solution with a pH of about 8.5, and/or [NH4]10W12O41 can be dissolved without extra<br>
base, e.g., to yield a solution with a pH of about 7.8 - 8.0. Sodium or ammonium<br>
molybdates, tantalates, or niobates can be similarly dissolved. As with the acidic<br>
solution(s), the basic solutions can be initially combined to form a single basic solution,<br>
or can be individually added directly to the acidic solution(s) to form the precipitate.<br>
[0033] These solutions can be mixed, e.g., by adding the basic<br>
solution(s) to the acidic solution(s), to form an initial precipitate. Optional heating,<br>
e.g., to about 50°C to about 90°C, of one or more of the solutions, prior to mixing, can<br>
be employed. Precipitation is completed by adding NaOH or KOH to raise the pH, e.g.,<br>
to about 8.8 to about 9.2. The solution is then optionally heated to a temperature of<br>
about 50°C to about 90°C, or, more specifically, about 60°C to about 80°C (e.g., about<br>
70°C), and stirred for less than or equal to about 6 hours or so (e.g., about 1 to about 6<br>
hours, or, more specifically, about 1.5 to about 2.5 hour (e.g., about 2 hours). The<br>
precipitate can then be washed to remove soluble salts, dried (e.g., actively and/or<br>
passively), and calcined. Calcination can be at a temperature of less than or equal to<br>
about 700°C, or, more specifically, about 600°C to about 700°C, or, yet more<br>
specifically, about 650°C to about 700°C.<br><br>
[0034] It is possible to make and use precursor solutions with<br>
concentrations of XO2 of 100 grams per liter (g/liter) or more (wherein "X" represents<br>
Ce, Zr, "R" (when "R" is Mn), and "M"). In this nomenclature of X02, the amount of<br>
CeO2, ZrO2, and MnO2 equivalent to the Ce(III) salt (e.g., Ce(III) nitrate), zirconyl salt<br>
(e.g., zirconyl nitrate), and Mn(II) salt (e.g., Mn(H) nitrate) is calculated and put into<br>
the precursor solution (e.g., nitrate solution). When "R" is W, an initial solution<br>
containing a tungsten concentration equivalent to up to 20 g/liter WO3 is prepared. For<br>
example, the concentration of tungsten, in its original basic solution prior to addition to<br>
the XO2 acidic solution(s), can be equivalent to about 15 g/liter to about 25 g/liter WO3<br>
(e.g., about 20 g/liter WO3), while the concentration of Ce, Zr, Mn, and "M" can each<br>
be about 50 g XO2/liter to about 100 g XO2/liter.<br>
[0035] Also, it is noted that while precursor nitrates were used in<br>
preparing the above samples, it is possible to use other water-soluble salts of cerium,<br>
zirconium, and manganese including, for example, acetate and/or chloride salts. If<br>
chloride salts are used, the precipitate will be washed to ensure essentially complete<br>
removal of sodium chloride.<br>
[0036] It is noted that not all materials provide desirable catalysts. As<br>
can be seen in Figure 8, a six-component Ce-Zr-La-Y-Mn-Fe catalyst (line 807), while<br>
possessing a thermally stable fluorite structure after treatment at 1,000°C, is less active<br>
for SCR than similar less complex compositions. Only low levels (about 2 mol%) of<br>
both Mn and Fe were present in that material. Higher concentrations of manganese are<br>
also shown in Figure 8. Increasing the Mn mol fraction from 2% to 30% resulted in<br>
gradual broadening, to lower temperatures, of the NOx reduction window (lines 801,<br>
803, 805, and 809).<br>
[0037] Similarly, employment of titanium dioxide (TiO2), e.g., the use<br>
of various amounts of TiO2 in the composition, did not improve the performance as is<br>
illustrated in Figure 9. Figure 9 actually illustrates that the titania is failing to decrease<br>
the parasitic oxidation at temperatures of greater than or equal to about 450°C. As can<br>
be seen, as the amount of titania in the catalyst increases, the NOx conversion of the<br>
catalyst decreases (line 901 (least amount of titania (2.5 mol%)) to line 907 (most<br>
amount of titania (20 mol%)).<br>
[0038] The catalyst structure can affect the performance, e.g., NOx<br>
and/or NH3 conversion. Both (NH4)10W12O41 and Na2(W04) have proven useful in the<br>
synthesis of the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst. It is noted that in some of the synthesized<br><br>
catalysts, the catalyst contains both fluorite and MnWO4 phases. Next, we can make a<br>
rough estimate of the ratio of fluorite to MnWO4 in Ceo.3Zro.3Mno.3Wo.1O2 that has been<br>
calcined at 700°C based on our X-ray diffraction results. We examine the 200 fluorite<br>
reflection and the 011 MnWO4 reflection. The most intense feature in the X-ray<br>
diffraction patterns occurs at about 30° 2-theta in our diffraction pattern; this diffraction<br>
intensity results from contributions of fluorite (100) and MnWO4 (l-bar 11). So, we<br>
base our analysis on reflections due solely to fluorite, namely the (200) reflection<br>
occurring at about 34° 2-theta) and (011) for MnWO4, occurring at about 26.3° 2-theta.<br>
We determine maximum intensity of these two reflections and weight them according<br>
to the relative intensity of these reflections, as reported on JCPDS cards 13-0434 (for<br>
MnWO4) and 43-1002 (for CeO2). JCPDS is an acronym for the Join Committee on<br>
Powder Diffraction Standards, now associated with the International Centre for<br>
Diffraction Data. The MnWCVfluorite ratio can, roughly, be described as:<br><br>
The MnWCVfluorite ratio can be less than or equal to about 0.25, or, more specifically,<br>
less than or equal to about 0.15.<br>
[0039] An exemplary synthesis method comprises dissolving an<br>
appropriate amount of Na2WO4 in an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution (e.g., NaOH<br>
and/or KOH solution). Separately, nitrates of cerium, zirconium, and manganese, (e.g.,<br>
Ce(NO3)3 hydrate, ZrO(NO3)2 hydrate, and Mn(NO3)2) can be dissolved in an aqueous<br>
acidic acid that optionally contains a bit of nitric acid to promote dissolution. These<br>
solutions are slowly combined and the Ce-Zr-Mn-W-0 material is precipitated. The<br>
precipitate is washed and calcined.<br>
[0040] When the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst is used in the SCR device,<br>
e.g., in an underfloor location, the SCR device comprises a porous support with the<br>
Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst located therein and/or thereon. Examples of porous support<br>
materials include cordierite, metallic supports, silicon carbide (SiC), alumina (e.g.,<br>
zirconium toughened alumina), and the like, as well as combinations comprising at<br>
least one of the foregoing materials. The porous support can be in the form of a<br><br>
monolith, sponge, foil, and so forth, and may also comprise a protective coating, e.g., of<br>
phosphate or metal phosphate.<br>
[0041] The Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst can, alternatively or in addition, be<br>
located in the particulate filter. The particulate filter can comprise any filter and design<br>
capable of removing particulate matter from the exhaust stream and preventing the<br>
emission of such particulate matter into the atmosphere. In addition, when the<br>
Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst is also disposed in the filter, the filter is capable of reducing<br>
NOx. For example, after calcination at 600°C, some of the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalysts<br>
are capable of NOx conversion down to less than 50 parts per million by volume (ppm)<br>
(i.e., 85% conversion) can be attained over a temperature of about 200°C to about<br>
415°C.<br>
[0042] As noted above, the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst can be used in a<br>
particulate filter. A particulate filter generally comprises a shell and a filter element<br>
with a retention material disposed therebetween. The filter element removes particulate<br>
matter from the exhaust stream. The filter element can comprise any material designed<br>
for use in the environment and which can remove particulate matter from a gaseous<br>
stream. Some possible materials include ceramics (e.g., extruded ceramics), metals<br>
(e.g., extruded, sintered metals), and silicon carbide; and so forth, as well as<br>
combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing materials, such as cordierite,<br>
aluminum oxide, aluminum phosphate, sintered steel (such as sintered stainless steel).<br>
For example, the filter element can comprise a gas permeable ceramic material having a<br>
honeycomb structure consisting of a plurality of channels, e.g., parallel channels. The<br>
channels can be divided into alternating inlet channels and outlet channels. The inlet<br>
channels are open at an inlet end of the filter element and closed at the opposite end of<br>
the filter element, while outlet channels are closed at the inlet end and open at the outlet<br>
end. The inlet and outlet channels are separated by porous longitudinal sidewalls that<br>
permit the exhaust gases to pass from the inlet channels to the outlet channels along<br>
their length.<br>
[0043] Optionally, a composition appropriate for soot oxidation can be<br>
disposed in one or more of the inlet channel(s), while the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-O catalyst can<br>
be disposed in one or more of the outlet channel(s). These materials may be wash<br>
coated, imbibed, impregnated, physisorbed, chemisorbed, precipitated, sprayed, or<br>
otherwise applied to the filter element. Depending upon the location of the<br>
Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst in the particulate filter, the composition for soot oxidation<br><br>
may also be chosen for its reactivity with other exhaust components. For example, a<br>
soot oxidation composition may be chosen that does not unselectively oxidize ammonia<br>
(or urea) without coreaction of NOx, within the temperature range of interest (e.g.,<br>
150°C to about 500°C or so).<br>
[0044] Soot oxidation catalysts are any material capable of oxidizing<br>
soot, with an ignition temperature below about 550°C, that does not have activity to<br>
oxidize NH3 at temperatures below about 600°C. Possible examples of such catalysts<br>
are those of the catalysts discussed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005-0282698 that<br>
lack ammonia oxidation activity. Many base metal catalyst compositions will provide<br>
this sort of activity. In general, soot oxidation catalysts containing platinum (Pt) and/or<br>
palladium (Pd) will not be suitable, however.<br>
[0045] If an oxidation catalyst is employed, as with the SCR device, the<br>
oxidation catalyst comprises a substrate, catalytic material, and shell, with a retention<br>
material disposed between the substrate and the shell. The catalyst material(s) for the<br>
oxidation catalyst can be a catalyst capable of oxidizing at least one of HC and CO to<br>
water and CO2, respectively, and preferably that does not oxidize NO to N02. The<br>
substrate can comprise materials employed in the particulate filter and/or the SCR<br>
device. Although the substrate can have any size or geometry, the size and geometry<br>
are preferably chosen to optimize surface area in the given exhaust emission control<br>
device. Typically, the substrate has a honeycomb geometry, with the combs through-<br>
channel having any multi-sided or rounded shape, with substantially square, triangular,<br>
pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, or octagonal, or similar geometries preferred due to<br>
ease of manufacturing and increased surface area.<br>
[0046] As mentioned above, seemingly due to the mechanism of<br>
operation of the present catalyst, the catalyst has improved NOx reduction and<br>
ammonia conversion when operated under the "Standard Reaction" conditions. As a<br>
result exhaust from a diesel engine can optionally be passed from the manifold directly<br>
through the particulate filter and from the particulate filter, directly through an optional<br>
SCR and then directly vented to the environment (i.e., without the use of additional or<br>
other exhaust treatment devices). In this embodiment, the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-O catalyst can<br>
be disposed in the particulate filter and/or in the SCR. Regardless of the catalysts<br>
location, ammonia (and/or urea) is also introduced to the catalyst, by introduction<br>
directly to the device comprising the catalyst, or introduction to the exhaust stream<br>
upstream thereof. Alternately, ammonia could be produced on-board through thermal<br><br>
desorption of ammonia from an ammoniacal salt, such as Mg(NH3)6Cl2, contained in a<br>
dedicated ammonia delivery system. Once the catalyst has attained a temperature of<br>
greater than or equal to about 150°C, it attains light-off, converting the NH3 and NOx<br>
to nitrogen and water.<br>
[0047] If the catalyst is located in the particulate filter, e.g., in the outlet<br>
channels of the filter, the exhaust stream flows into the inlet channels and passes<br>
through the walls of the channels, thereby filtering out soot and particulate matter from<br>
the stream. As the stream passes through the outlet channels, the NOx and ammonia<br>
are converted to nitrogen and water. After the stream exits the filter, it can optionally<br>
be treated to oxidize HC and CO in the stream prior to venting to the environment.<br>
[0048] When an oxidation catalyst is employed, it is preferable to<br>
employ an oxidation catalyst that does not convert the NO to NO2, but oxidizes the HC<br>
and CO. From the oxidation catalyst, the stream can pass through a particulate filter to<br>
remove the soot and/or other particulate matter. If the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst is not<br>
located in the filter, the NOx is reduced downstream in a SCR comprising the<br>
Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst.<br>
[0049] The following examples are provided merely to further illustrate<br>
the present Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst and not to limit the scope hereof.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Sample 1 is a Ceo.35Zro.35Mno.25Wo.05O2 catalyst.<br>
[0050] 168.3 milliliter (ml) solution of ammonium para-tungstate,<br>
(NH4)10W12O41 (concentration 12.5 grams (g) WO3 per liter (1)), was poured to a<br>
solution obtained by mixing of 220.5 ml Ce(NO3)3, 158 ml ZrO(NO3)2, and 79.5 ml<br>
Mn(NO3)2 with concentrations 50 g MO2/1. The pouring of ammonium para-tungstate<br>
was performed at room temperature (20-23 CC) at the rate of 10 milliliters per minute<br>
(ml/min) under intensive stirring. After ammonium para-tungstate was added to the<br>
mixed nitrate solution, the resultant suspension was heated to 70°C, and then, 2N KOH<br>
was added until attaining pH 9 ± 0.1. The suspension was stirred under these<br>
conditions for 2 hours. The suspension was filtered, and the precipitate was washed<br>
with distilled water until there was an absence of nitrates in the filtrate. Finally, the<br>
precipitate was washed with ethanol. The precipitate was dried, first in air and then in a<br><br>
drying furnace at 110°C to 120°C for 12 to 14 hours, and, after that, was calcined at<br>
600°C for 4 hours.<br>
Example 2: Sample 2 is a Ceo.3Zro.3Mno.3Wo.1O2 catalyst.<br>
[0051] 336.5 ml solution of ammonium para-tungstate, (NH4)10W12O41<br>
(concentration 12.5 g WO3/I), was poured to a solution obtained by mixing of 187 ml<br>
Ce(NO3)3, 134 ml ZrO(NO3)2 and 95 ml Mn(NO3)2 with concentrations 50 g MO2/1.<br>
The pouring of ammonium para-tungstate was performed at room temperature (20-<br>
23°C) at the rate of 10 ml/min under intensive stirring. After ammonium para-tungstate<br>
was added to the mixed nitrate solution, a suspension obtained was heated to 70°C, and<br>
then, 2N KOH was added until attaining pH 9 ± 0.1. The suspension was stirred under<br>
these conditions for 2 hours. The suspension was filtered, and the precipitate was<br>
washed with distilled water till the absence of nitrates in the filtrate. Finally, the<br>
precipitate was washed with ethanol. The precipitate was dried first in air and then in a<br>
drying furnace at 110°C to 120°C for 12 to 14 hours, and, after that, was calcined at<br>
600°C for 4 hours.<br>
[0052] When calcined at low temperatures (e.g., less than or equal to<br>
700°C), both materials (Samples I and 2) comprise a fluorite structure. Additionally,<br>
MnWO4 was detected in Sample 2 after calcination at 700°C, but not after calcination<br>
at 600°C, while MnWO4 is not detected after calcination at 600°C or 700°C in Sample<br>
1.<br>
[0053] Fresh and/or aged Samples 1 and 2, as well as reference catalysts<br>
(as is explained in each figure), were tested. The aging conditions were 16 hours (hr) at<br>
the aging temperature in an environment comprising 28 parts per million by volume<br>
(ppm) SO2, 4.5 volume percent (vol%) H2O,14 vol°/o O2, balance N2 and Ar. The<br>
evaluation conditions that were then employed to test the catalysts comprised: 350<br>
ppm NO, 350 ppm NH3, 4.5 vol% H2O, 14 vol% O2, balance He.<br>
[0054] Figure 1 graphically illustrates a comparison of NOx reduction<br>
for Sample 2 compared to a MnCe material. MnCe contains, formally, about 50 wt%<br>
MnO2 and 50% CeO2. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals two phases: CeO2 and<br>
Mn2O3. A contraction of the fluorite CeO2 lattice parameter indicates some doping of<br>
ceria with partial occupancy by manganese atoms at the cerium position. As is evident<br>
fiom the graphs, the MnCe catalyst (line 101) had a NOx reduction window of about<br><br>
150°C to about 275°C, and then actually oxidized the NH3 to NOx at temperatures of<br>
about 300°C and greater. Sample 2 (line 103) had a NOx reduction window of about<br>
150°C to about 475°C, with oxidation of NH3 to NOx not occurring until temperatures<br>
exceeding 500°C and even exceeding 525°C. Addition of W to the composition<br>
broadened the NOx reduction window to higher temperatures. NOx reduction windows<br>
of greater than or equal to about 350°C and even greater than or equal to about 400°C<br>
(e.g., about 200°C to about 600°C or so), can be attained with a Ce-Zr-W-A-M-O<br>
catalyst, where both "A" and "M" are optional, e.g., Ceo.45-Zro.45Wo.1-O2+δ that has been<br>
sintered at 600°C.<br>
[0055] Figure 2 compares NOx conversion for Sample 2 after aging at<br>
700°C (line 201), and Sample 2 after aging at 850°C (line 203), to fresh and 850°C<br>
aged VOx-WO3-TiO2 reference catalyst (lines 205 and 207, respectively). Inspection<br>
revealed that the reference catalyst completely deactivated for NOx reduction after<br>
aging at 850°C (line 207). The 700°C aged Sample 2 (line 201) had better performance<br>
than even the fresh reference catalyst (line 205) while the 850°C aged Sample 2 (line<br>
203) had only slightly worse performance than fresh reference catalyst (line 205).<br>
[0056] Figure 3 compares NH3 conversion for Sample 2 after aging at<br>
700°C (line 301), and Sample 2 after aging at 850°C (line 303), to fresh and 850°C<br>
aged VOX-WO3-T1O2 reference catalyst (lines 305 and 307, respectively). NH3<br>
conversion for aged Sample 2 is slightly better than NH3 conversion for the fresh<br>
reference catalyst. After aging, the reference catalyst deactivates very substantially for<br>
NH3 conversion (line 307). Fresh reference catalyst (line 305) attained nearly 100%<br>
NH3 conversion at temperatures of greater than 275°C, with light-off at about 240°C,<br>
while the aged reference catalyst (line 307) did not attained nearly 100% NH3<br>
conversion until temperatures of greater than 550°C, with light-off at about 525°C.<br>
Sample 2, even aged at 850°C (line 303), attained NH3 conversion at temperatures of<br>
greater than or equal to about 275°C with light-off at around 240°C. The Sample 2 that<br>
was only aged to 700°C (line 301) actually attained light-off at temperatures of less<br>
than or equal to about 200°C, with NH3 conversion at temperatures of greater than or<br>
equal to about 260°C.<br>
[0057] Figure 4 shows analogous trends involving Sample 1. This<br>
figure compares NOx conversion for Sample 1 after aging at 700°C (line 401), and<br>
Sample 1 after aging at 850°C (line 403), to fresh and 850°C aged VOx-WO3-TiO2<br>
reference catalyst (lines 405 and 407, respectively). Inspection revealed that the<br><br>
reference catalyst completely deactivated for NOx reduction after aging at 850°C (line<br>
407). The 700°C aged Sample 1 (line 401) had better performance than even the fresh<br>
reference catalyst (line 405) while the 850°C aged Sample 1 (line 403) had only<br>
slightly worse performance than fresh reference catalyst (line 405).<br>
[0058] Figure 5 compares NH3 conversion for Sample 1 after aging at<br>
700°C (line 501), and Sample 1 after aging at 850°C (line 503), to fresh and 850°C<br>
aged VOX-WO3-T1O2 reference catalyst (lines 505 and 507, respectively). NH3<br>
conversion for aged Sample 1 is slightly better than NH3 conversion for the fresh<br>
reference catalyst. After aging, the reference catalyst deactivates very substantially for<br>
NH3 conversion (line 507). Fresh reference catalyst (line 505) attained NH3<br>
conversion at temperatures of greater than 285°C, with light-off at about 250°C, while<br>
the aged reference catalyst (line 507) attained NH3 conversion at temperatures of<br>
greater than 570°C, with light-off at about 520°C. Sample 1, even aged at 850oC (line<br>
503), attained NH3 conversion at temperatures of greater than or equal to about 320°C<br>
with light-off substantially the same as the fresh reference catalyst at about 250°C. The<br>
Sample 1 that was only aged to 700°C (line 501) actually attained light-off at<br>
temperatures of less than or equal to about 200°C, with NH3 conversion at temperatures<br>
of greater than or equal to about 240°C.<br>
[0059] Figure 6 graphically illustrates further aging of Samples 1 and 2<br>
to determine the effect of higher temperature aging. It is shown that higher temperature<br>
aging does not result in deactivation, wherein the reference catalyst deactivated when<br>
aged at 850°C. Sample 1, when aged at 950°C (line 601), had a light-off at close to<br>
about 300°C and a peak NOx conversion percentage of 40% at about 400°C, while<br>
when aged at 850°C (line 605), had a light-off of about 240°C and a peak NOx<br>
conversion percentage of 80% at about 350°C. With respect to Sample 2, when aged at<br>
950°C (line 605), had a light-off at close to about 290°C and a peak NOx conversion<br>
percentage of 60% at about 380°C, while when aged at 850°C (line 607), had a light-off<br>
of about 225°C and a peak NOx conversion percentage of 80% at about 315°C. Even<br>
with high temperature aging (e.g., 950°C), e.g., at inlet temperatures below 500°C,<br>
Sample 1 retained some NOx conversion capability (greater than or equal to about<br>
40%), while Sample 2 retained substantial NOx conversion capability ((greater than or<br>
equal to about 60%). As can be seen in Figures 2 and 4, the reference catalyst, even<br>
when aged to just 850°C, retained no NOx conversion capability.<br><br>
[0060] Figure 7 shows that aging of Samples 1 and 2 at 950°C causes<br>
some loss of NH3 conversion performance; e.g., the fresh reference catalyst is better at<br>
NH3 conversion than the aged Samples 1 and 2. However, Samples 1 and 2, even aged<br>
at 950°C, exhibit substantially better NH3 conversion (e.g., at temperatures of less than<br>
500°C) than the reference catalyst aged at 850°C. (Also see Figures 3 and 5)<br>
[0061] In one embodiment, a NOx reduction catalyst consists essentially<br>
of Cea-Zrb-Rc-Ad-Me-Ox fluorite, wherein only elements that do not reduce NOx<br>
conversion can additionally be incorporated into the catalyst, "a" can be about 0.1 to<br>
about 0.6, or, more specifically, about 0.25 to about 0.5, and even more specifically,<br>
about 0.3 to about 0.4. "b" can be about 0.25 to about 0.7, or, more specifically, about<br>
0.3 to about 0.6, and even more specifically, about 0.35 to about 0.5. "c" can be about<br>
0.02 to about 0.5, or, more specifically, about 0.1 to about 0.4, and even more<br>
specifically, about 0.2 to about 0.35, or, in some embodiments 0.05 to about 0.2. When<br>
"R" is Mn, "d" can be about 0.04 to about 0.2, or, more specifically, about 0.05 to<br>
about 0.15, and even more specifically, about 0.07 to about 0.12. When "R" is W, "d"<br>
can be less than or equal to about 0.2, or, more specifically, about 0.04 to about 0.2, yet<br>
more specifically, about 0.05 to about 0.15, and even more specifically, about 0.07 to<br>
about 0.12. "e" can be less than or equal to about 0.15, or, more specifically, about<br>
0.03 to about 0.1. The NOx reduction catalyst is capable of reducing NOx (e.g.,<br>
promoting a chemical reaction between NOx and reduced nitrogen species (such as<br>
ammonia) to make, predominantly, nitrogen (N2)).<br>
[0062] The catalyst disclosed herein has low light-off temperatures of<br>
less than or equal to about 200°C, even less than or equal to about 175°C, e.g., about<br>
140°C to about 160°C. Catalyst also has a wider operating range of greater than or<br>
equal to about 200°C, or, more specifically, greater than or equal to about 300°C, and<br>
even greater than or equal to about 400°C.<br>
[0063] Additionally, the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst disclosed herein is<br>
unexpectedly highly thermally stable (e.g., stable at temperatures of greater than or<br>
equal to 700°C), and retains NOx reduction capabilities even after 16 hours of aging<br>
under hydrothermal conditions at a temperature of 850°C. Since this catalyst exhibits<br>
greater NOx reduction capabilities without the presence of NO2, an oxidation catalyst<br>
upstream of this NOx catalyst can be eliminated while high NOx conversion is attained.<br>
It is further noted that the present catalysts show good tolerance to sulfur (e.g., SO2 and<br>
SO3) and superior oxygen atom transport, e.g., compared to neat ceria. Hence, it is<br><br>
believed that the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalysts will function as effective soot oxidation<br>
catalysts as well as a NOx reduction catalyst. Therefore, a single material can be used<br>
to perform the two more difficult functions of diesel exhaust gas detoxification:<br>
removal of NOx and removal of carbonaceous particulate matter.<br>
[0064] For example, diesel emissions control systems that do not<br>
employ the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst disclosed herein, and that utilize SCR and<br>
particulate traps, will often have, as a first catalyst in the emissions control system, an<br>
oxidation catalyst. This catalyst (typically Pt based) serves two or three functions:<br>
oxidizing CO and HC coming from the engine, oxidizing NO to NO2 (e.g., for the<br>
FAST NOx reaction), and serving as a heat source to heat up the particulate trap to<br>
temperatures sufficient to cause its regeneration by oxidizing carbon stored in the trap.<br>
The heating is accomplished by injecting sufficient (relatively large, compared to<br>
normal engine operation) amounts of hydrocarbons upstream of the engine as a late<br>
pulse during the combustion cycle (so that the hydrocarbons emerge from the cylinder<br>
largely uncombusted) and/or in the exhaust pipe, upstream of the oxidation catalyst.<br>
The hydrocarbons, when oxidized over the oxidation catalyst, increase the temperature<br>
of the exhaust gas sufficient to heat the particulate trap to soot regeneration<br>
temperatures.<br>
[0065] Downstream of this oxidation catalyst is generally a particulate<br>
trap followed by an SCR catalyst (since the SCR catalyst generally fails at temperatures<br>
below particulate trap regeneration temperatures); e.g., zeolite-based SCR catalysts and<br>
vanadia-titania-based catalysts fail at a temperature below about 750°C. However,<br>
since the Ce-Zr-Mn-A-M-0 catalyst disclosed herein are more temperature tolerant,<br>
they are better able to withstand the middle position (between the oxidation catalyst and<br>
the particulate trap).<br>
[0066] Not to be bound by theory, the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-O catalysts (Ce-Zr-<br>
Mn-A-M-0 catalysts) appear to reduce NO more effectively than NO2, thereby<br>
allowing the use of Pd oxidation catalysts (at a substantial cost savings to the use of Pt<br>
catalysts) to heat exhaust to temperatures needed to regenerate a particulate trap. Pd<br>
catalysts are less effective than Pt catalysts at oxidizing NO to NO2 which appears<br>
desirable for the new catalysts disclosed herein. In other words, unlike iron zeolite<br>
catalysts and V-W-TiO2 catalysts used for mobile applications, the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0<br>
catalyst does not require the use of Pt oxidation catalysts to convert NO to NO2 because<br>
it is active for the "Standard Reaction". This substantially reduces cost.<br><br>
[0067] The Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalysts (e.g., Ce-Zr-Mn-A-M-0 catalysts)<br>
could be coated onto a particulate trap, allowing the combination of the SCR and<br>
particulate matter (PM) control with a single coated substrate, permitting helpful<br>
reductions in system complexity and cost. After the SCR and particulate trap catalysts,<br>
an additional oxidation catalyst can be used to oxidize CO slipping from the particulate<br>
trap during high temperature regeneration and to oxidize any ammonia that slips from<br>
the SCR catalyst.<br>
[0068] Not to be bound by theory, the present composition enables a<br>
process for reducing NOx, where the NOx is mostly NO (e.g., greater than or equal to<br>
about 60 vol% NO, based on the total vol% of the NOx), using ammonia such that at<br>
temperatures below about 300°C, the characteristics of NOx reduction improve as the<br>
NO/NO2 ratio increases. The NOx reduction characteristics of the catalyst at<br>
temperatures below 300°C are better when the NOx is about 95 vol% NO, 5 vol% NO2<br>
compared to when the NOx is 50 vol% NO, 50 vol% NO2. Hence, for many<br>
embodiments of the Ce-Zr-R-A-M-0 catalyst, the NOx reduction characteristics at<br>
temperatures below about 300°C are better when NOx is greater than or equal to about<br>
75 vol% NO.(e.g., less than or equal to 25 vol% NO2) than when NOx is less than or<br>
equal to 50 vol% NO (e.g., 50 vol% NO2), based on the total volume of the NOx. It is<br>
noted that NOx in normal engine is exhaust is typically greater than 75 vol% NO and<br>
usually greater than 90 vol% NO. As a result, the present catalyst benefits from the<br>
normal exhaust conditions, able to use the exhaust NOx as it, without converting the<br>
NO/NO2 ratio. The present catalyst can reduce greater than or equal to about 50% of<br>
NOx in a gas stream, or more specifically, greater than or equal to about 80 vol% of<br>
NOx in a gas stream, and, even more specifically, greater than or equal to about 90<br>
vol% of NOx in a gas stream (based upon a total volume of NOx in the gas stream), in<br>
at a temperature of about 150°C to about 550°C, or, more specifically, the temperature<br>
is about 150°C to about 400°C. Additionally, the present catalyst can have a NOx<br>
reduction temperature window of about greater than or equal to about 250°C, even<br>
greater than or equal to about 300°C, and even greater than or equal to about 350°C,<br>
where greater than or equal to about 50%, and even greater than or equal to about 70%<br>
NOx conversion can be attained.<br>

ranges of "up to about 25 wt%, or, more specifically, about 5 wt% to about 20 wt %", is<br>
inclusive of the endpoints and all intermediate values of the ranges of "about 5 wt% to<br><br>
about 25 wt%," etc). As used herein, "combination" is inclusive of blends, mixtures,<br>
