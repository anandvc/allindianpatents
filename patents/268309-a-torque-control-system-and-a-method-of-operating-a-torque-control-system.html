METHOD OF TORQUE INTEGRAL CONTROL LEARNING AND<br>
INITIALIZATION<br>
 This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/984,882, filed on November 2, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD The present disclosure relates to control of internal combustion<br>
engines and, more particularly, to learning and initializing a torque integral of<br>
torque-based control of internal combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
 Internal combustion engines combust an air and fuel mixture<br>
within cylinders to drive pistons, which produces drive torque. Air flow into the<br>
engine is regulated via a throttle. More specifically, the throttle adjusts throttle<br><br>
area, which increases or decreases air flow into the engine. As the throttle area<br>
increases, the air flow into the engine increases. A fuel control system adjusts<br>
the rate that fuel is injected to provide a desired air/fuel mixture to the cylinders.<br>
Increasing the air and fuel to the cylinders increases the torque output of the<br>
engine.<br>
 Engine control systems have been developed to control engine<br>
torque output to achieve a desired predicted torque. Traditional engine control<br>
systems, however, do not control the engine torque output as accurately as<br>
desired. Further, traditional engine control systems do not provide as rapid of a<br>
response to control signals as is desired or coordinate engine torque control<br>
among various devices that affect engine torque output.<br>
SUMMARY A torque control system comprises a torque correction factor<br>
module, a RPM-torque transition module, and a selection module. The torque<br>
correction factor module determines a first torque correction factor and a second<br>
torque correction factor. The RPM-torque transition module stores the first<br>
torque correction factor. The selection module selectively outputs one of the first<br>
torque correction factor and the second torque correction factor based on a<br>
control mode of the torque control system.<br>
 A method of operating a torque control system comprises<br>
determining a first torque correction factor and a second torque correction factor,<br>
storing the first torque correction factor, and selectively outputting one of the first<br><br>
torque correction factor and the second torque correction factor based on a<br>
control mode of the torque control system.<br>
 Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
 As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary implementation of an engine system 100 is presented. The engine<br>
system 100 includes an engine 102 that combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce<br>
drive torque for a vehicle based on a driver input module 104. Air is drawn into<br>
an intake manifold 110 through a throttle valve 112. An engine control module<br>
(ECM) 114 commands a throttle actuator module 116 to regulate opening of the<br>
throttle valve 112 to control the amount of air drawn into the intake manifold 110.<br>
 Air from the intake manifold 110 is drawn into cylinders of the<br>
engine 102. While the engine 102 may include multiple cylinders, for illustration<br>
purposes, a single representative cylinder 118 is shown. For example only, the<br><br>
engine 102 may include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and/or 12 cylinders. The ECM 114<br>
may instruct a cylinder actuator module 120 to selectively deactivate some of the<br>
cylinders to improve fuel economy.<br>
 Air from the intake manifold 110 is drawn into the cylinder 118<br>
through an intake valve 122. The ECM 114 controls the amount of fuel injected<br>
by a fuel injection system 124. The fuel injection system 124 may inject fuel into<br>
the intake manifold 110 at a central location or may inject fuel into the intake<br>
manifold 110 at multiple locations, such as near the intake valve of each of the<br>
cylinders. Alternatively, the fuel injection system 124 may inject fuel directly into<br>
the cylinders.<br>
 The injected fuel mixes with the air and creates the air/fuel<br>
mixture in the cylinder 118. A piston (not shown) within the cylinder 118<br>
compresses the air/fuel mixture. Based upon a signal from the ECM 114, a<br>
spark actuator module 126 energizes a spark plug 128 in the cylinder 118, which<br>
ignites the air/fuel mixture. The timing of the spark may be specified relative to<br>
the time when the piston is at its topmost position, referred to as top dead center<br>
(TDC), the point at which the air/fuel mixture is most compressed.<br>
 The combustion of the air/fuel mixture drives the piston down,<br>
thereby driving a rotating crankshaft (not shown). The piston then begins moving<br>
up again and expels the byproducts of combustion through an exhaust valve 130.<br>
The byproducts of combustion are exhausted from the vehicle via an exhaust<br>
system 134.<br><br>
 The intake valve 122 may be controlled by an intake camshaft<br>
140, while the exhaust valve 130 may be controlled by an exhaust camshaft 142.<br>
In various implementations, multiple intake camshafts may control multiple intake<br>
valves per cylinder and/or may control the intake valves of multiple banks of<br>
cylinders. Similarly, multiple exhaust camshafts may control multiple exhaust<br>
valves per cylinder and/or may control the exhaust valves of multiple banks of<br>
cylinders. The cylinder actuator module 120 may deactivate cylinders by halting<br>
provision of fuel and spark and/or disabling their exhaust and/or intake valves.<br>
 The time at which the intake valve 122 is opened may be varied<br>
with respect to piston TDC by an intake cam phaser 148. The time at which the<br>
exhaust valve 130 is opened may be varied with respect to piston TDC by an<br>
exhaust cam phaser 150. A phaser actuator module 158 controls the intake cam<br>
phaser 148 and the exhaust cam phaser 150 based on signals from the ECM<br>
114.<br>
 The engine system 100 may include a boost device that<br>
provides pressurized air to the intake manifold 110. For example, FIG. 1 depicts<br>
a turbocharger 160. The turbocharger 160 is powered by exhaust gases flowing<br>
through the exhaust system 134, and provides a compressed air charge to the<br>
intake manifold 110. The air used to produce the compressed air charge may be<br>
taken from the intake manifold 110.<br>
 A wastegate 164 may allow exhaust gas to bypass the<br>
turbocharger 160, thereby reducing the turbocharger's output (or boost). The<br>
ECM 114 controls the turbocharger 160 via a boost actuator module 162. The<br><br>
boost actuator module 162 may modulate the boost of the turbocharger 160 by<br>
controlling the position of the wastegate 164. The compressed air charge is<br>
provided to the intake manifold 110 by the turbocharger 160. An intercooler (not<br>
shown) may dissipate some of the compressed air charge's heat, which is<br>
determined when air is compressed and may also be increased by proximity to<br>
the exhaust system 134. Alternate engine systems may include a supercharger<br>
that provides compressed air to the intake manifold 110 and is driven by the<br>
crankshaft.<br>
 The engine system 100 may include an exhaust gas<br>
recirculation (EGR) valve 170, which selectively redirects exhaust gas back to<br>
the intake manifold 110. The engine system 100 may measure the speed of the<br>
crankshaft in revolutions per minute (RPM) using an RPM sensor 180. The<br>
temperature of the engine coolant may be measured using an engine coolant<br>
temperature (ECT) sensor 182. The ECT sensor 182 may be located within the<br>
engine 102 or at other locations where the coolant is circulated, such as a<br>
radiator (not shown).<br>
 The pressure within the intake manifold 110 may be measured<br>
using a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 184. In various<br>
implementations, engine vacuum may be measured, where engine vacuum is the<br>
difference between ambient air pressure and the pressure within the intake<br>
manifold 110. The mass of air flowing into the intake manifold 110 may be<br>
measured using a mass airflow (MAF) sensor 186.<br><br>
 The throttle actuator module 116 may monitor the position of the<br>
throttle valve 112 using one or more throttle position sensors (TPS) 190. The<br>
ambient temperature of air being drawn into the engine system 100 may be<br>
measured using an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor 192. The ECM 114 may<br>
use signals from the sensors to make control decisions for the engine system<br>
100.<br>
 The ECM 114 may communicate with a transmission control<br>
module 194 to coordinate shifting gears in a transmission (not shown). For<br>
example, the ECM 114 may reduce torque during a gear shift.<br>
 To abstractly refer to the various control mechanisms of the<br>
engine 102, each system that varies an engine parameter may be referred to as<br>
an actuator. For example, the throttle actuator module 116 can change the blade<br>
position, and therefore the opening area, of the throttle valve 112. The throttle<br>
actuator module 116 can therefore be referred to as an actuator, and the throttle<br>
opening area can be referred to as an actuator position.<br>
 Similarly, the spark actuator module 126 can be referred to as<br>
an actuator, while the corresponding actuator position is an amount of a spark<br>
advance. Other actuators include the boost actuator module 162, the EGR valve<br>
170, the phaser actuator module 158, the fuel injection system 124, and the<br>
cylinder actuator module 120. The term actuator position with respect to these<br>
actuators may correspond to boost pressure, EGR valve opening, intake and<br>
exhaust cam phaser angles, air/fuel ratio, and number of cylinders activated,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
 When an engine transitions from producing one torque to<br>
producing another torque, many actuator positions will change to produce the<br>
new torque most efficiently. For example, the spark advance, throttle position,<br>
exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) regulation, and cam phaser positions may<br>
change. Changing one of these actuator positions often creates engine<br>
conditions that would benefit from changes to other actuator positions, which<br>
might then result in changes to the original actuators. This feedback results in<br>
iteratively updating actuator positions until they are all positioned to produce a<br>
desired predicted torque most efficiently.<br>
 Large changes in torque often cause significant changes in<br>
engine actuators, which cyclically cause significant change in other engine<br>
actuators. This is especially true when using a boost device, such as a<br>
turbocharger or supercharger. For example, when the engine is commanded to<br>
significantly increase a torque output, the engine may request that the<br>
turbocharger increase boost.<br>
 In various implementations, when boost pressure is increased,<br>
detonation, or engine knock, is more likely. Therefore, as the turbocharger<br>
approaches this increased boost level, the spark advance may need to be<br>
decreased. Once the spark advance is decreased, the desired turbocharger<br>
boost may need to be increased to achieve the. desired predicted torque.<br>
 This circular dependency causes the engine to reach the<br>
desired predicted torque more slowly. This problem is exacerbated because of<br>
the already slow response of turbocharger boost, commonly referred to as turbo<br><br>
lag. FIG. 2 depicts an engine control system capable of accelerating the circular<br>
dependency of boost and spark advance.<br>
 FIG. 3 depicts a closed-loop torque control module that<br>
determines a torque correction factor at the new torque level and determines a<br>
commanded torque based on the torque correction factor. The closed-loop<br>
torque control module outputs the commanded torque to a predicted torque<br>
control module. The predicted torque control module estimates the airflow that<br>
will be present at the commanded torque and determines desired actuator<br>
positions based on the estimated airflow. The predicted torque control module<br>
then determines engine parameters based on the desired actuator positions and<br>
the desired predicted torque. For example, the engine parameters may include<br>
desired manifold absolute pressure (MAP), desired throttle area, and/or desired<br>
air per cylinder (APC).<br>
 In other words, the predicted torque control module can<br>
essentially perform the first iteration of actuator position updating in software.<br>
The actuator positions commanded should then be closer to the final actuator<br>
positions. FIG. 4 depicts exemplary steps performed by the closed-loop torque<br>
control module to determine when and how to perform this modeled iteration.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary implementation of the ECM 114 is presented. The ECM 114 includes<br>
a driver interpretation module 314. The driver interpretation module 314 receives<br>
driver inputs from the driver input module 104. For example, the driver inputs<br>
may include an accelerator pedal position. The driver interpretation module<br><br>
outputs a driver torque, which is the amount of torque requested by a driver via<br>
the driver inputs.<br>
 The ECM 114 includes an axle torque arbitration module 316.<br>
The axle torque arbitration module 316 arbitrates between driver inputs from the<br>
driver interpretation module 314 and other axle torque requests. Other axle<br>
torque requests may include torque reduction requested during a gear shift by<br>
the transmission control module 194, torque reduction requested during wheel<br>
slip by a traction control system, and torque requests to control speed from a<br>
cruise control system.<br>
 The axle torque arbitration module 316 outputs a predicted<br>
torque and a torque desired immediate torque. The predicted torque is the<br>
amount of torque that will be required in the future to meet the driver's torque<br>
and/or speed requests. The torque desired immediate torque is the torque<br>
required at the present moment to meet temporary torque requests, such as<br>
torque reductions when shifting gears or when traction control senses wheel<br>
slippage.<br>
The torque desired immediate torque may be achieved by<br>
engine actuators that respond quickly, while slower engine actuators are targeted<br>
to achieve the predicted torque. For example, a spark actuator may be able to<br>
quickly change the spark advance, while cam phaser or throttle actuators may be<br>
slower to respond. The axle torque arbitration module 316 outputs the predicted<br>
torque and the torque desired immediate torque to a propulsion torque arbitration<br>
module 318.<br><br>
 The propulsion torque arbitration module 318 arbitrates between<br>
the predicted torque, the torque desired immediate torque and propulsion torque<br>
requests. Propulsion torque requests may include torque reductions for engine<br>
over-speed protection and torque increases for stall prevention.<br>
 An actuation mode module 320 receives the predicted torque<br>
and the torque desired immediate torque from the propulsion torque arbitration<br>
module 318. Based upon a mode setting, the actuation mode module 320<br>
determines how the predicted torque and the torque desired immediate torque<br>
will be achieved. For example, in a first mode of operation, the actuation mode<br>
module 320 may output the predicted torque to a driver torque filter 322.<br>
 In the first mode of operation, the actuation mode module 320<br>
may instruct an immediate torque control module 324 to set the spark advance to<br>
a calibration value that achieves the maximum possible torque. The immediate<br>
torque control module 324 may control engine parameters that change relatively<br>
more quickly than engine parameters controlled by a predicted torque control<br>
module 326. For example, the immediate torque control module 324 may control<br>
spark advance, which may reach a commanded value by the time the next<br>
cylinder fires. In the first mode of operation, the torque desired immediate torque<br>
is ignored by the predicted torque control module 326 and by the immediate<br>
torque control module 324.<br>
 In a second mode of operation, the actuation mode module 320<br>
may output the predicted torque to the driver torque filter 322. However, the<br>
actuation mode module 320 may instruct the immediate torque control module<br><br>
324 to attempt to achieve the torque desired immediate torque, such as by<br>
retarding the spark.<br>
 In a third mode of operation, the actuation mode module 320<br>
may instruct the cylinder actuator module 120 to deactivate cylinders if necessary<br>
to achieve the torque desired immediate torque, in this mode of operation, the<br>
predicted torque is output to the driver torque filter 322 and the torque desired<br>
immediate torque is output to a first selection module 328. For example only, the<br>
first selection module 328 may be a multiplexer or a switch.<br>
 In a fourth mode of operation, the actuation mode module 320<br>
outputs a reduced torque to the driver torque filter 322. The predicted torque<br>
may be reduced only so far as is necessary to allow the immediate torque control<br>
module 324 to achieve the torque desired immediate torque using spark retard.<br>
 The driver torque filter 322 receives the predicted torque from<br>
the actuation mode module 320. The driver torque filter 322 may receive signals<br>
from the axle torque arbitration module 316 and/or the propulsion torque<br>
arbitration module 318 indicating whether the predicted torque is a result of driver<br>
input. If so, the driver torque filter 322 may filter out high frequency torque<br>
changes, such as those that may be caused by the driver's foot modulating the<br>
accelerator pedal while on rough road. The driver torque filter 322 outputs the<br>
predicted torque to a torque control module 330.<br>
The ECM 114 includes a mode determination module 332. For<br>
example only, the mode determination module 332 may receive a torque desired<br>
predicted torque from the torque control module 330. The mode determination<br><br>
module 332 may determine a control mode based on the torque desired<br>
predicted torque. When the torque desired predicted torque is less than a<br>
calibrated torque, the control mode may be an RPM control mode. When the<br>
torque desired predicted torque is greater than or equal to the calibrated torque,<br>
the control mode may be a torque control mode. The control mode MODEi may<br>
be determined by the following equation:<br><br>
 where Ttorque is the torque desired predicted torque and CALT is<br>
the calibrated torque.<br>
 The torque control module 330 receives the predicted torque<br>
from the driver torque filter 322, the control mode from the mode determination<br>
module 332, and an RPM desired predicted torque from an RPM control module<br>
334. The torque control module 330 determines (i.e., initializes) a delta torque<br>
based on the predicted torque and the RPM desired predicted torque when the<br>
control mode is transitioning from the RPM control mode to the torque control<br>
mode. The delta torque Tdeita may be determined by the following equation:<br>
 (2) T,Mw = TRPMLC ~ T:ero •<br>
 where TRPMLC is a last commanded RPM desired predicted<br>
torque, and Tzero is a torque value at a zero accelerator pedal position (i.e., when<br>
the driver's foot is off the accelerator pedal) that is determined based on the<br>
predicted torque. The torque control module 330 may decay each term of the<br>
equation defining the delta torque to zero when the control mode is the torque<br><br>
control mode. For example only, the delta torque may be decayed linearly,<br>
exponentially, and/or in pieces.<br>
 The torque control module 330 adds the delta torque to the<br>
predicted torque to determine the torque desired predicted torque. The torque<br>
desired predicted torque Ttorque may be determined by the following equation:<br>
 (3) Twrqm = Tpp + T:ero + Tdelm ,<br>
 where Tpp is a torque value at the accelerator pedal position that<br>
is determined based on the predicted torque.<br>
 Further discussion of the functionality of the torque control<br>
module 330 may be found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 7,021,282,<br>
issued on April 4, 2006 and entitled "Coordinated Engine Torque Control," the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The torque<br>
control module 330 outputs the torque desired predicted torque to a second<br>
selection module 336. For example only, the second selection module 336 may<br>
be a multiplexer or a switch.<br>
 The ECM 114 includes an RPM trajectory module 338. The<br>
RPM trajectory module 338 determines a desired RPM based on a standard<br>
block of RPM control described in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,405,587, issued on June 18, 2002 and entitled "System and Method of<br>
Controlling the Coastdown of a Vehicle," the disclosure of which is expressly<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example only, the desired<br>
RPM may include a desired idle RPM, a stabilized RPM, a target RPM, or a<br>
current RPM.<br><br>
 The RPM control module 334 receives the desired RPM from<br>
the RPM trajectory module 338, the control mode from the mode determination<br>
module 332, an RPM signal from the RPM sensor 180, a MAF signal from the<br>
MAF sensor 186, and the torque desired predicted torque from the torque control<br>
module 330. The RPM control module 334 determines a minimum torque<br>
required to maintain the desired RPM, for example, from a look-up table. The<br>
RPM control module 334 determines a reserve torque. The reserve torque is an<br>
additional amount of torque that is incorporated to compensate for unknown<br>
loads that can suddenly load the engine system 100.<br>
 The RPM control module 334 determines a run torque based on<br>
the MAF signal. The run torque Trun is determined based on the following<br>
relationship:<br>
 (4)Trm=f(APCacl,RPM,S,I,E),<br>
where APCact is an actual air per cylinder value that is<br>
determined based on the MAF signal, S is the spark advance, I is intake cam<br>
phaser positions, and E is exhaust cam phaser positions.<br>
 The RPM control module 334 compares the desired RPM to the<br>
RPM signal to determine an RPM correction factor. The RPM control module<br>
334 adds the RPM correction factor to the minimum and reserve torques to<br>
determine the RPM desired predicted torque. The RPM control module 334<br>
subtracts the reserve torque from the run torque and adds this value to the RPM<br>
correction factor to determine an RPM desired immediate torque.<br><br>
 In various implementations, the RPM control module 334 may<br>
simply determine the RPM correction factor equal to the difference between the<br>
desired RPM and the RPM signal. Alternatively, the RPM control module 334<br>
may use a proportional-integral (PI) control scheme to meet the desired RPM<br>
from the RPM trajectory module 338. The RPM correction factor may include an<br>
RPM proportional, or a proportional offset based on the difference between the<br>
desired RPM and the RPM signal. The RPM correction factor may also include<br>
an RPM integral, or an offset based on an integral of the difference between the<br>
desired RPM and the RPM signal. The RPM proportional Prpm may be<br>
determined by the following equation:<br>
 (5) PRPil = Kp * (MM,,,, - RPM),<br>
 where Kp is a pre-determined proportional constant. The RPM<br>
integral IRPM may be determined by the following equation:<br>
 {Q)IRni=K,*\{RPMd!S-RPM)dt,<br>
 where K| is a pre-determined integral constant.<br>
 Further discussion of PI control can be found in commonly<br>
assigned patent application 11/656929, filed 1/23/2007, and entitled "Engine<br>
Torque Control at High Pressure Ratio," the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety. Additional discussion regarding PI control of<br>
engine speed can be found in commonly assigned patent application 60/861492,<br>
filed 11/28/2006, and entitled "Torque Based Engine Speed Control," the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
 The RPM control module 334 determines (i.e., initializes) the<br>
RPM integral based on the minimum torque and the torque desired predicted<br>
torque when the control mode is transitioning from the torque control mode to the<br>
RPM control mode. The RPM integral IRPM may be determined by the following<br>
equation:<br>
 (7)IRm=TlorqiiaLC-Tnin,<br>
 where Tt0rqueLc is a last commanded torque desired predicted<br>
torque and Tmjn is the minimum torque.<br>
 The RPM desired predicted torque TRPM may be determined by<br>
the following equation:<br>
 (8) TRPM = Tn.n + Tres + Pmi + IRn,,<br>
 where Tres is the reserve torque. Further discussion of the<br>
functionality of the RPM control module 334 may be found in commonly assigned<br>
patent application 60/861492, filed 11/28/2006, and entitled "Torque Based<br>
Speed Control," the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety. The RPM control module 334 outputs the RPM desired predicted torque<br>
to the second selection module 336 and the RPM desired immediate torque to<br>
the first selection module 328.<br>
 The second selection module 336 receives the torque desired<br>
predicted torque from the torque control module 330 and the RPM desired<br>
predicted torque from the RPM control module 334. The mode determination<br>
module 332 controls the second selection module 336 to choose whether the<br>
torque desired predicted torque or the RPM desired predicted torque should be<br><br>
used to determine a desired predicted torque. The mode determination module<br>
332 therefore instructs the second selection module 336 to output the desired<br>
predicted torque from either the torque control module 330 or the RPM control<br>
module 334.<br>
 The mode determination module 332 may select the desired<br>
predicted torque based upon the control mode. The mode determination module<br>
332 may select the desired predicted torque to be based upon the torque desired<br>
predicted torque when the control mode is the torque control mode. The mode<br>
determination module 332 may select the desired predicted torque to be based<br>
upon the RPM desired predicted torque when the control mode is the RPM<br>
control mode. The second selection module 336 outputs the desired predicted<br>
torque to a closed-loop torque control module 340.<br>
 The closed-loop torque control module 340 receives the desired<br>
predicted torque from the second selection module 336, the control mode from<br>
the mode determination module 332, and an estimated torque from a torque<br>
estimation module 342. The estimated torque may be defined as the amount of<br>
torque that could immediately be produced by setting the spark advance to a<br>
calibrated value. This value may be calibrated to be the minimum spark advance<br>
that achieves the greatest torque for a given RPM and air per cylinder. The<br>
torque estimation module 342 may use the MA.F signal from the MAF sensor 186<br>
and the RPM signal from the RPM sensor 180 to determine the estimated torque.<br>
Further discussion of torque estimation can be found in commonly assigned U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,704,638, issued on March 9, 2004 and entitled "Torque Estimator<br><br>
for Engine RPM and Torque Control," the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
 The closed-loop torque control module 340 compares the<br>
desired predicted torque to the estimated torque to determine a torque correction<br>
factor. The closed-loop torque control module 340 adds the torque correction<br>
factor to the desired predicted torque to determine a commanded torque.<br>
 In various implementations, the closed-loop torque control<br>
module 340 may simply determine the torque correction factor equal to the<br>
difference between the desired predicted torque and the estimated torque.<br>
Alternatively, the closed-loop torque control module 340 may use a PI control<br>
scheme to meet the desired predicted torque from the second selection module<br>
336. The torque correction factor may include a torque proportional, or a<br>
proportional offset based on the difference between the desired predicted torque<br>
and the estimated torque. The torque correction factor may also include a torque<br>
integral, or an offset based on an integral of the difference between the desired<br>
predicted torque and the estimated torque. The torque correction factor TPi may<br>
be determined by the following equation:<br>
 (9) Tpl=Kp*{Tdcs-Tj+K,*j{Tdcs-Tjdt,<br>
 where KP is a pre-determined proportional constant and K| is a<br>
pre-determined integral constant.<br>
 The closed-loop torque control module 340 outputs the<br>
commanded torque to the predicted torque control module 326. The predicted<br>
torque control module 326 receives the commanded torque, the control mode<br><br>
from the mode determination module 332, the MAF signal from the MAF sensor<br>
186, the RPM signal from the RPM sensor 180, and the MAP signal from the<br>
MAP sensor 184. The predicted torque control module 326 converts the<br>
commanded torque to desired engine parameters, such as desired manifold<br>
absolute pressure (MAP), desired throttle area, and/or desired air per cylinder<br>
(APC). For example only, the predicted torque control module 326 may<br>
determine the desired throttle area, which is output to the throttle actuator<br>
module 116. The throttle actuator module 116 then regulates the throttle valve<br>
112 to produce the desired throttle area.<br>
 The first selection module 328 receives the torque desired<br>
immediate torque from the actuation mode module 320 and the RPM desired<br>
immediate torque from the RPM control module 334. The mode determination<br>
module 332 controls the first selection module 328 to choose whether the torque<br>
desired immediate torque or the RPM desired immediate torque should be used<br>
to determine a desired immediate torque. The mode determination module 332<br>
therefore instructs the first selection module 328 to output the desired immediate<br>
torque from either the propulsion torque arbitration module 318 or the RPM<br>
control module 334.<br>
 The mode determination module 332 may select the desired<br>
immediate torque based upon the control mode. The mode determination<br>
module 332 may select the desired immediate torque to be based upon the<br>
torque desired immediate torque when the control mode is the torque control<br>
mode. The mode determination module 332 may select the desired immediate<br><br>
torque to be based upon the RPM desired immediate torque when the control<br>
mode is the RPM control mode. The first selection module 328 outputs the<br>
desired immediate torque to the immediate torque control module 324.<br>
 The immediate torque control module 324 receives the desired<br>
immediate torque from the first selection module 328 and the estimated torque<br>
from the torque estimation module 342. The immediate torque control module<br>
324 may set the spark advance using the spark actuator module 126 to achieve<br>
the desired immediate torque. The immediate torque control module 324 can<br>
then select a smaller spark advance that reduces the estimated torque to the<br>
desired immediate torque.<br>
 Referring now to FIG. 3, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary implementation of the closed-loop torque control module 340 is<br>
presented. The closed-loop torque control module 340 includes a PI module<br>
442. The PI module 442 receives the desired predicted torque from the second<br>
selection module 336 and the estimated torque from the torque estimation<br>
module 342.<br>
 The PI module 442 compares the desired predicted torque to<br>
the estimated torque to determine a first torque correction factor and a second<br>
torque correction factor. The PI module 442 may use the PI control scheme, or<br>
other control schemes, to meet the desired. predicted torque. The first and<br>
second torque correction factors may each include at least one of a torque<br>
proportional and a torque integral.<br><br>
 A RPM-torque transition module 444 receives the first torque<br>
correction factor from the PI module 442. For example only, the RPM-torque<br>
transition module 444 may determine a previous torque correction factor based<br>
on the first torque correction factor and a previous torque integral. The previous<br>
torque integral may be a previously-stored (i.e., learned) torque integral of a<br>
previous first torque correction factor. To determine the previous torque<br>
correction factor, the RPM-torque transition module 444 may set the torque<br>
integral of the first torque correction factor to the previous torque integral. The<br>
RPM-torque transition module 444 may then store (i.e., learn) the torque integral<br>
of the first torque correction factor as the previous torque integral.<br>
 The closed-loop torque control module 340 includes a torque<br>
control time module 446. The torque control time module 446 receives the<br>
estimated torque from the torque estimation module 342 and the control mode<br>
from the mode determination module 332. The torque control time module 446<br>
increments a torque control time when the control mode is the torque control<br>
mode and when the estimated torque is greater than a calibrated torque. The<br>
torque control time At may be determined by the following equation:<br>
 (10)	Atk=toi_l+l,ifTal&gt;CALTt<br>
 where Test is the estimated torque, and CALT is the calibrated<br>
torque.<br>
 A torque-RPM transition module 448 receives the first torque<br>
correction factor jrom the PI module 442 and the torque control time from the<br>
torque control time module 446. The torque-RPM transition module 448<br><br>
determines a third torque correction factor based on the first torque correction<br>
factor when the torque control time is greater than a calibrated time. The torque-<br>
RPM transition module 448 sets the torque integral of the first torque correction<br>
factor to zero and determines the third torque correction factor based on the new<br>
first torque correction factor when the torque control time is less than the<br>
calibrated time. The torque integral of the third torque correction factor lT0 may<br>
be determined by the following equation:<br><br>
 where CALt is the calibrated time and ATdes is a change in the<br>
desired predicted torque.<br>
A selection module 450 receives the second torque correction<br>
factor from the PI module 442, the previous torque correction factor from the<br>
RPM-torque transition module 444, and the third torque correction factor from the<br>
torque-RPM transition module 448. The mode determination module 332<br>
controls the selection module 450 to choose whether the second torque<br>
correction factor, the previous torque correction factor, or the third torque<br>
correction factor should be used to determine a fourth torque correction factor.<br>
The mode determination module 332 therefore instructs the selection module<br>
450 to determine the fourth torque correction factor from the PI module 442, the<br>
RPM-torque transition module 444, or the torque-RPM transition module 448.<br>
The selection module 450 determines the fourth torque<br>
correction factor from the PI module 442 when the control mode is the torque<br><br>
control mode. The selection module 450 determines the fourth torque correction<br>
factor from the PI module 442 when the control mode is the RPM control mode.<br>
In other words, the torque integral of the fourth torque correction factor is learned<br>
from the PI module 442 when the control mode is the torque control mode or the<br>
RPM control mode.<br>
 The selection module 450 determines the fourth torque<br>
correction factor from the RPM-torque transition module 444 when the control<br>
mode is transitioning from the RPM control mode to the torque control mode. In<br>
other words, the torque integral of the fourth torque correction factor is initialized<br>
to the previous torque integral when the control mode is transitioning from the<br>
RPM control mode to the torque control mode. The selection module 450 determines the fourth torque correction factor from the torque-RPM transition<br>
module 448 when the control mode is transitioning from the torque control mode<br>
to the RPM control mode. In other words, the torque integral of the fourth torque<br>
correction factor is initialized to zero or to the torque integral of the second torque<br>
correction factor when the control mode is transitioning from the torque control<br>
mode to the RPM control mode.<br>
 A summation module 452 receives the fourth torque correction<br>
factor from the selection module 450 and the desired predicted torque from the<br>
second selection module 336. The summation module 452 adds the fourth<br>
torque correction factor and the desired predicted torque to determine the<br>
commanded torque. The summation module 452 outputs the commanded torque<br>
to the predicted torque control module 326.<br><br>
 Referring now to FIG. 4, a flowchart depicts exemplary steps<br>
performed by the closed-loop torque control module 340. Control begins in step<br>
602, where the control mode is stored as a previous control mode. Control<br>
continues in step 604, where the torque integral is stored as the previous torque<br>
integral.<br>
 Control continues in step 606, where the control mode is<br>
determined. Control continues in step 608, where control determines whether<br>
the control mode is the torque control mode or the RPM control mode, if the<br>
control mode is the torque control mode, control continues in step 610;<br>
otherwise, control continues in step 612.<br>
 In step 610, control determines whether the previous control<br>
mode is the torque control mode or the RPM control mode. If the previous<br>
control mode is the torque control mode, control continues in step 614;<br>
otherwise, control continues in step 616. In step 614, the estimated torque is<br>
determined. Control continues in step 618, where control determines whether<br>
the estimated torque is greater than the calibrated torque. If the estimated torque<br>
is greater than the calibrated torque, control continues in step 620; otherwise,<br>
control continues in step 622. In step 620, the torque control time is<br>
incremented. Control continues in step 622. In step 616, the torque integral is<br>
set to the previous torque integral. Control returns to step 602.<br>
In steP 612, control determines whether the previous control<br>
mode is the torque control mode or the RPM control mode. If the previous<br>
control mode is the torque control mode, control continues in step 624;<br><br>
otherwise, control continues in step 626. in step 624, control determines whether<br>
the torque control time is less than the calibrated time. If the torque control time<br>
is less than the calibrated time, control continues in step 628; otherwise, control<br>
continues in step 630. In step 628, the torque control time is set to zero. Control<br>
continues in step 632, where the torque integral is set to zero. Control returns to<br>
step 602. In step 630, the torque control time is set to zero. Control continues in<br>
step 626. In step 626, the estimated torque is determined. Control continues in<br>
step 622.<br>
 In step 622, the desired predicted torque is determined. Control<br>
continues in step 634, where the torque integral is determined based on the<br>
desired predicted torque and the estimated torque. Control returns to step 602.<br>
 Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
