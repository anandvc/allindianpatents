renewable biomass-derived. feedstocks and by simple chemical methods. Glyeerol<br>
is an inexpensive renewable compound that is readily available as a by-product of<br>
biodiesel production or via fermentation of carbohydrates. Levulinic (4-<br>
oxopentanoic) acid is another abundant feedstock that is prepared on an industrial<br>
scale by acidic degradation of hexoses and hexose-containing polysaccharides such<br>
as cellulose, starch, sucrose, and the like. Chemical products produced from these<br>
two materials could fill a need for inexpensive, renewable consumer and industrial<br>
products.<br>

The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the<br>
description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be<br>
apparent from the description and from the claims. .<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present disclosure provides a series of glycerol-deriyed compounds that<br>
are based on the formation of a ketal with the ketone group of levulinic acid.<br>
Glycerol-levulinate ketal compounds can be produced by reacting approximately<br>
one molar equivalent of glycerol with approximately one molar equivalent of<br><br>
levulinic acid in the presence of an acid catalyst, and under conditions allowing for<br>
removal of water, typically by distillation. The reaction is preferably carried out<br>
using between 0.7 to 1.3 molar equivalents of Ievulinic acid, although the reaction<br>
can be carried out with, lower or higher amounts of levulinic acid. However, when<br>
the amount of levulinic acid is too low, much of the glycerol remains unreacted.<br>
Alternatively,; if the amount of levulinic acid is too high, then di and tri-levulinate<br>
esters of glycerol are formed in large quantities, thereby reducing the yield, of the<br>
desired ketal adducts of giycerol and levuiinate.<br>
During the course of the reaction between one equivalent of giycerol and one<br>
equivalent of levutinale, two equivalents of water are formed. Water can<br>
conveniently be removed by distillation, or by an azeotropic distillation in the<br>
presence of a suitable inert solvent such as hexane, heptane, toluene, benzene, and<br>
the like. When about two equivalents of water have been removed from the reaction<br>
mixture, the reaction mixture contains predominantly a polymeric levulinate-<br>
glyceroJ kef al adduct comprising a repeat unit having formula (1):<br><br>
wherein the R1 is hydrogen or a earboxyl atom of a levuiinate fragment, and<br>
wherein R is hydroxyl, an oxygen atom of a giycerol, or an oxygen atom of an<br>
esterified glycerol fragment, and wherein p is an integer.<br>
The product is a polymer that is, in the absence of other compounds and<br>
impurities typically terminated at its ends by a levulinoyl group and by a giycerol<br>
ester fragment.<br>
The value of p depends on may factors and may significantly vary,<br>
depending on how much water has been removed, the reactant ratio, acid catalyst<br>
aad severity of the heating conditions used to remove water. The purity of the<br>
giycerol and levulimate are also factors. Relatively impure industrial grades of<br>
giycerol and levuiinate give adducte wherein p is in a range typically between 1 aad<br>
10. However, even with pure glycerol and icvulinate it is difficult to Obtain<br><br>
polymers with p values significantly in excess of 30. It has been found feat the<br>
direct polyeondensation reaction between glycerb) and levulinate becomes staggered<br>
due to formation of the polymers of formula (1'), wherein R1 is represented by a<br>
gamma-valerolactone derivative, as shown herein:<br><br>
If heated for sufficiently long time, the compound (1') will slowly rearrange<br>
to a levulinoyl-terminated polymer, thereby allowing for further polymer growth.<br>
However, In Industrial practice, it is not practical or necessary to rely on such long<br>
reaction times, and it is preferred (hat the polycondensation reaction be stopped<br>
when about 70 to 95% of the theoretical amount of water has been collected. The<br>
resulting polymers comprise glycerol fragments that are esterified at more than one<br>
hydroxyl group, and such fragments are recognized herein as points of polymer<br>
branching or points of repeat unit inversion, wherein the repeat unit is of formula<br>
Depending on the severity of the conditions of the reaction, some ether bond<br>
formation, resulting in diglyeeryl fragments, or some elimination of hydroxyl<br>
groups from glycerol, to form acrolein, is possible. It is also possible that some<br>
angeiicalactone formation from levulinate also occurs and this product may be<br>
isolated and re-used. Typically, the polymeric adduct of glycerol and levulinate<br>
prepared from industrial grade glycerol and levulinate is a very viscous, semi-<br>
transparent or transparent liquid with a pale yellowish-brownish to near colorless<br>
botsey-like appearance due to traces of unidentified byproducts. However, even in<br>
 the presence of these by-products, the final polymeric adduct comprising the repeat<br>
unit of formula (1) is found herein to be useful in the preparation of compounds and<br>
various intermediates.<br>
Similarly to the free ievutinic acid, levulinic esters of monohydric alkanols,<br>
beta- and gamma-angelicalactones, and 4,4-dialkoxypenanoate esters (which are<br>
esters of ketals of levulinic acid with monohydric alkanols) are also suitable to<br><br>
practice the synthesis of the glyeerol levulinate ketal compounds comprising the<br>
repeat unit of formula (1). Any of these levulinic derivatives can be used in the<br>
synthesis of the glycerol levnlinate ketal compounds in a substantially pure form, or<br>
in a mixture. The mixtures can comprise any of the above compounds with a<br>
quantity of free levulinic acid. When mixtures of the levulinic derivatives are used<br>
to make the glycerol levulinate ketal compounds, it is preferred that about one molar<br>
equivalent of these compounds is used per molar equivalent of glycerol.<br>
Similarly, in the synthesis of the glycerol levulinate ketal compounds, some<br>
or all of the glycerol can. be replaced with a glycerol ketaS or acetal of formula (2);<br><br>
wherein R4 and R5 arc each Independently selected from hydrogen; linear, branched,<br>
or cyclic aikyl; linear, branched, or cyclic alkenyl; ary!; or aralkyl. Preferably, R4<br>
and R5 are not both hydrogen.<br>
Mono, di and tri esters of glycerol with simple C1-C8 linear or branched<br>
alkanoic acids can also be used instead of glycerol, or in. a mixture with glycerol.<br>
Monolevulinate ester of glycerol is also a suitable starting material.<br>
Synthesis of the condensation polymeric glycerol levulinate ketai adduct<br>
comprising the repeat unit of formula (.1) of glycerol is carried out with glycerol and<br>
levuiinic acid, which are fully miscibie compounds. For industrial practice, glycero!<br>
and levuiinic aeid do not need to be anhydrous and'thus may contain varying<br>
amounts of water. However, it is preferred that these starting materials do not<br>
contain, excessive amounts of water, as this results in a less efficient use of<br>
equipment. Typically, glycerol and levuiinic acid with water contents of about 10%<br>
or less are preferred.<br>
Synthesis of the polymeric levulinate-glycerol ketal adduct comprising the<br>
repeat unit of formula (1) typically requires the presence of a suitable acid catalyst.<br>
Non-limiting examples of such catalysts include strong mineral acids, such as<br>
sulfuric, hydrochloric, hydrofluoroboric, hydrobrornic acids, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
camphorosulfonic acid, rnethanesulfonic acid, and like, Various resins that contain<br>
protonated sulfonic acid, groups are also useful as they can be easily recovered after<br><br>
completion of the reaction. Examples of acids also include Lewis acids. For<br>
example, boron trifluoride and various complexes of BF3, exemplified by BF3<br>
diethyl etherate. Silica, acidic-alumina, titaraia., zirconia, various acidic clays, and<br>
mixed aluminum or magnesium oxides can be used, Activated carbon derivatives<br>
comprising mineral acid, sulfonic acid, or Lewis acid derivatives can also be used.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art can practice many variations on the part of the<br>
catalyst composition and the amounts used in the preparation described herein,<br>
Amount and type of catalyst depends on the specific chemical composition of the<br>
epoxide and glycerol or glycerol derivative of formula (3), used in the reaction and<br>
can be readily established by one skilled in the art. It is preferred, however, that<br>
low-cosl catalysts that impart minimal or negligible corrosion effects on the<br>
equipment used in the synthesis, and have low volatility, toxicity, and<br>
environmental impacts, or can be easily neutralized to innocuous compounds,, are<br>
used, Sulferic acid is one such preferred catalyst. The reaction of condensation of<br>
glycerol and levulinic acid can be carried out without a catalyst, but, for industrial<br>
purposes, these reaction conditions are generally too slow to be practical, ia order "<br>
to yield industrial quantities of compounds comprising the repeat unit of formula<br>
(1), it is preferred that the condensation be accelerated by use of a catalyst and<br>
elevated temperature sufficient to remove water from the reaction mixture without<br>
undue time expenditure. The condensation reaction may optionally also be carried<br>
out under reduced pressure to facilitate removal, of water, and to minimize formation<br>
of discolored by-products.<br>
An adduct of glycerol and levulinate comprising ketal fragments of formula<br>
(I) can be further subjected to chemical reactions to yield derivatives of glycerol<br>
and levulinate.<br>
Trans-eterification with alcohols<br>
Products can be obtained when polymeric compounds comprising the repeat<br>
units of formula (I) are treated under trans-esterification conditions with a<br>
rnonohydric alcohol. Typically, such reactions are carried out with an alcohol in the<br>
presence of abase, such as alkali or alkali-earth hydroxides or alkoxides. The<br><br>
catalyst can be used in a soluble or insoluble form. Many trans-esterification base<br>
catalysts are known in the art, and the present disclosure is Hot limited to the use of<br>
a particular catalyst.<br>
Such trans-esterification reactions can result in the formation of a mixture of<br>
cis and trans- stereoisomers of a hydroxyestar compound having formula (3);<br><br>
wherein R3 is a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl or alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or<br>
alkyloxyalkyl.<br>
A typical procedure for making the hydroxyester of formula (3) involves use<br>
of an excess of alcohol which, after neutralization of the base catalyst, is removed<br>
by distillation, The Irans-esterification reaction with an alcohol typically also<br>
results in the formation of minor quantities of free glycerol that readily separates as<br>
an alcohol-immiscible liquid from the alcoholic solutions of hydroxyester (3), ester<br>
of levulinic acid, and the R3OH alcohol used in the trans-esterification. The latter<br>
compound can be readily separated from the hydroxyester of formula (3) by<br>
distillation, typically under reduced pressure, and, if desired, re-used in the synthesis<br>
of the glycerol-levulinate ketal polymeric adduct comprising the repeat unit of<br>
formula (1).<br>
It has been found that the cis- and trans- isomers of the compound of<br>
formula (3) can be readily separated from each other by distillation using ordinary<br>
distillation equipment known in the art, such as distillation columns with sufficient<br>
number of plates, falling film, distillation columns, and the like. Preferably,<br>
distillation to separate cis- and trans-isomers of the compound of formula (3) is<br>
earned out under reduced pressure and in the relative absence of a trans-<br>
esterification catalyst. The latter condition is beneficial as it minhnizes<br>
polymerization of the compound of formula (3), as well as formation of a free<br>
alcohol, R3OH, which can make maintenance of sufficient vacuum difficult.<br>
However, the distillation maybe carried out without complete removal of trans-<br>
esterification catalyst, and any -and istilled oligomers can be recovered and re-used<br><br>
for preparation of the compound of formula (3) by the base-catalyzed reaction<br>
disclosed above.<br>
It has also been found that alkaline trans-esterification reaction of ketal-ester<br>
co-polymers of glycerol and levalinate comprising the repeat units of formula (i)<br>
yield mixtures of reaction products that largely comprise the cis and trans-isommrs<br>
of the compounds of formula {1), which are 1,2-ketals of glycerol and a levulinate<br>
ester with alcohol R3OH, Only negligible traces of 1,3-glycerol ketals of esterified<br>
levulinate are found in such product mixtures,<br>
Trang-esterification with carboxylic esters<br>
In a related embodiment, the trans-esterification in the presence of base is<br>
carried out under conditions similar to that described above for an alcoholic trans-<br>
esterification, except that instead of an alcohol, an ester of a carboxylic acid and an<br>
alkanol Is used. In this case, stereoisomers of carboxylic esters of glycerol<br>
levulinate ketal of formula (4) are formed:<br><br>
wherein R3 is a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl or alkenyl, aryl, arallkyl, or<br>
alkyloxyalkyl, and R6 is hydrogen., or is a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl or<br>
aikenyl, aryl, arakyl, alkyloxyalkyl, or oxoalkyl.<br>
The synthesis of compound (4) using trans-esterification with the carboxylic<br>
ester is also typically accompanied by the formation of minor quantities-of<br>
levulinate ester, glycerol, glycerol mono, di and tri esters of the carboxylic acid-<br>
R6COOH, and of varying quantities of the compound of formula. (3). The quantity<br>
of the compound of formula (3) depends largely on the value of p specified in the<br>
structure of the repeat unit of formula (1) described above; polymeric ketal adducts<br>
having lower values of p tend to produce higher relative quantities of the compound<br>
of formula (3) in relation to the compound of formula (4). The reaction products<br>
from base-catalyzed trans-esterification with carboxylic esters are typically<br>
separated and purified by distillation.<br><br>
De-polymerzing trans -esterification of polymeric glycerol levulinate ketal adducts<br>
In. another embodiment, a polymer comprising a glyceroi levutinate ketal<br>
adduct comprising a unit of formula (la):<br><br><br><br>
wherein R9 is hydrogen or a carboxyl moiety; R10 is OR11, or N(Rl2)2; R11 and R12<br>
are independently hydrogen or a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl; and p is an<br>
integer. In some embodiments, OR11 can. be a fragment of a monohydric or a<br>
polyhydric alcohol. The compound comprising the unit of formula (1a) is subjected<br>
to a trans-esterification reaction, resulting in a depolymcrization that provides for<br>
the formation of a bicyclic lactone-ketal adduct of glyceroi and levutinate, named<br>
herein "segetolide" ("lactone of a crop field"), having formula (5):<br><br>
7-methyl-3,8,10-trioxabicyclo(5.2.1]decan-4-one.<br>
A further embodiment includes the provision of a cyclic dimex of segetolide<br>
(5). Such a cyclic dimer (named herein "bis-segetolide") is a cyclic bis-lactone<br>
(diolide) bis-ketal having formula 5{a):<br><br>
Typical lys such a depolymerizing trans-esterificatton reaction, is carried, out<br>
under substantially anhydrous reaction conditions, and in the presence of an acid or<br>
abase catalyst. Alternatively, one or more of many other catalysts known in the art<br>
to catalyze esterification or trans-esterification reactions, such as those known in the<br><br>
art of synthesis of various polyesters, may be used- Numerous examples of catalysts<br>
for synthesizing of compounds of formulae (5) and/or (5a) by depolymerization of<br>
polymers comprising repeat units of formula (la) caa be: found in the art of<br>
polyester synthesis. Description of such catalysts and methods of their use can be<br>
found,, for example, in United States Patents Nos. 4,133,800,4,205,157, 4,208,527,<br>
5,028,667, 5,095,098, S,2l0,l08, 5,208,297, 5,202,413, 5,292,859 5,342,969,<br>
5,565,545, and 6,-828,272.<br><br>
wherein R9 is hydrogen or a carboxyl moiety; R10 is OR11, or N(R11)2; R11 and R12<br>
are independently hydrogen, or a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl; and p Is an<br>
Under such conditions, the cyclic ketal lactones of formulae (5) and/or 5{a)<br>
are in equilibrium with one another, the polymeric compound, and various<br>
-oligomers comprising the unit of formula (1a). Under sufficient temperature,<br>
typically in the range of 160-300Â°C, and, preferably, wider reduced pressure, a<br>
vapor phase comprising ketal lactones of formulae (5) and (5a) is formed. The<br>
compounds of formulae (5) and (5a) are typically separated from the reaction<br>
mixture by distillation under reduce pressure, and separated from each other, if<br>
desired, by distillation. Further purification of the compounds of formulae (5) and<br>
(5a) can be achieved by repeated distillations, or by using a high efficiency<br>
distillation column. By adjusting the temperature and pressure of the distillation, it<br>
is possible to obtain the compound of formula (5) substantially free of the<br>
compound of formula (5a) without difficulty, as these two compounds.have a large<br>
difference in 'boiling temperatures. It is understood that if an. effective trans-<br>
esterification catalyst is present in the preparation of substantially pure compounds<br>
of formula (5) and/or 5(a), such compounds may equilibrate to form a. mixture of<br>
these to compounds, as well as varying quantities of polymers comprising the cis-<br>
isomers of the units of formula (1b):<br><br>
integer. In some embodiments, OR11 can be a fragment of a monohydric or a<br>
polyhydric alcohol<br>
When depolymerization is conducted in the presence of a catalyst, using a<br>
polymer comprising a mixture with approximately equal quantity of cis- and trans-<br>
units of formula (I), approximately half of the quantity of the polymeric adduct<br>
comprising the cis- and trans- isomeric units of formula (1) can be converted to the<br>
compound of formula (5), The remainder of the undistifled polymeric adduct<br>
consists predominantly, or exclusively, of the units of formula (1) having the trans-<br>
stereoohemistry (1 c):<br><br>
wherein R9 is hydrogen or a carboxyl moiety; R10 is OR11, or N(R13)2; R11. and R12<br>
are independently hydrogen or a linear, branched, or cyclic alky); and p is an<br>
integer. In some embodiments, OR11 can be a fragment of a monohydric or a<br>
polyhydric alcohol.<br>
During depotymerization of polymers comprising the unit of formula (la)<br>
conducted in the absence of an effective amount of an acid catalyst that allows the<br>
irans-ketal to re-equilibrate to a mixture of cis- and trans- ketals, the compounds of<br>
formulae (5) and (5 a) are formed only from the cis-isomers of units of formula (lb).<br>
In general, the quantity of the products of compound of formulae (5) and<br>
(5a) that can be produced is limited by the abundance of the cis-fragments of the<br>
formula (1 b) in the polymer used for depolyrnerlzation.<br>
When depolymerization of the polymer comprising units of formula (i) is<br>
conducted in the presence of an acid catalyst, both cis- and trans- isomers of the<br>
units are in quiltbrium, and thus both cis- and trans- units can be converted to the<br>
compound of formula (5) and/or 5(a), It is preferred, however, that when an acid<br>
catalyst is used to conduct the depolymerization reaction, the temperatures of the<br>
reaction not be allowed to exceed 120-130 Â°C to avoid excessive decomposition of<br>
glycerol to acrolein, and formation of glyceryl ethers.<br><br>
After the compounds of formula (5) and/or (5a) have been substantially<br>
removed by distillation, the resulting depolymerization product is a useful polymer<br>
typically comprising predominantly, or exclusively, the tram-fragments of formula<br>
(1c). Such can be further converted, for example, by using trans-esterification with<br>
an excess alcohol or an ester in the presence of base. Under such, conditions,<br>
compounds of formula (3) and (4) comprising predominantly, or exclusively, the<br>
trans-isomers of the compounds of formula (3a) and (4a), respectively, are thus<br>
prepared:<br><br><br><br>
Similarly, the bi cyclic lac-tone keta! compounds of formula (5) and/or 5(a)<br>
are readily converted by a base-catalyzed trans-esterification with an alcohol or an<br>
ester to the corresponding cis-isomers of the hydroxyester (3b) and diester (4b):<br><br>
The glyeerol ketal derivatives of levulinic esters of formula (3), (4), (5), and<br>
5(a), as well as the separated individual cis- and trans- stereoisomers (3a), (3b),<br>
(4a), and (4b), are excellent solvents for a variety of both hydrophobic compounds<br>
(e.g., fats, oils,, greases, waxes, varnishes) and many hydrophilic compounds.<br>
Compounds of formula (3), wherein R3 is a C1-C5 lower alkyl, are miscible with<br>
water in a broad range of concentrations. Therefore, these compounds are useful as<br>
part of various formulations in applications such as degreasing, paint thiners, paint<br>
removal or as part of formulated adhesives. Because of their relatively slow<br>
evaporation under ordinary environmental conditions (which can be controlled by<br>
selecting appropriate length of R6 and R3 groups), and because of a low agreeable or<br>
negligible odor, these compounds are also useful as eoalescent solvents in various<br><br>
latex paints and coatings where they can be supplied to the frmulation in addition<br>
to, or instead of, typical petroleum-derived solvents suck as 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-<br>
pentanediol monoisobutyrate or disobutyrste, ketones, and aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The compounds (3) and (4), as well as any individual or mixed<br>
stereoisoxners thereof, have also been found to be useful as plasticizers.with various<br>
polymers, such as poly(vinyl chlaride), poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), poly(3-<br>
hydroxybutyrate), poly(lactate), and polysaccharides.<br>
Poly(vinyl chloride) polymers, PVC, are fromopolymers or co-polymers of<br>
vinyl chloride. Many PVC compounds of various degree of polymerization, cross-<br>
linking and co-polymer composition are known in the art and are produced<br>
industrially.<br>
Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), PHA, are polyester homopolymers or co-<br>
polymers of 3-hydroxyalkanoic acids. Preferably, PHA is composed of linear 3-<br>
hydroxyaikanoic fragments having from 3 to 18 carbon atom atoms, Poly(3-<br>
hydroxybutyrate), PHB, is a homopolymer that is produced biologically, for<br>
example by various microorganisms. A pure PHB polymer is a brittle polymer<br>
having a narrow range of processing temperatures, and it decomposes readily at<br>
temperatures that are only 20-30 "C above its melting temperature.<br>
Poly(lactate), or poiy(lactide), PL A, is a known polyester homopolymer<br>
comprising repeat units of lactic acid of various stereochemistry.<br>
Polysaccharides are homopolymers and co-polymers, linear or branched,<br>
comprising hexose or pentose fragments connected via glycosyl linkages. The<br>
polysaccharides may optionally contain various additional groups such as acylamido<br>
groups, sulfate ester groups, carboxylic ester groups, alkyl and hydroxyalkyl ether<br>
groups and the like. Such additional groups may be present in polysaccharides<br>
derived from natural sources or can be artificially introduced (i.e., by aeyktion. of<br>
cellulose). Examples of polysaccharides include acylated derivatives of cellulose<br>
and starch, as well as native or acylated chitin and pectin,<br>
Plasticizers are chemical compounds added to a base composition<br>
comprising one or more of the above polymers with the purpose of lowering the<br>
glass transition temperature of the polymer composition, thereby making the<br><br>
composition more flexible and amenable to processing, e.g., by melt extrusion or<br>
molding. Plasticizers are typically used at various effective concentrations, and<br>
depending on the polymer used and desired properties of the compounded polymer<br>
formulations, plasticizers can be used at concentrations between 1 and 80% by<br>
weight of the unplasticized polymer. It is understood that, depending on the<br>
polymer and the plasticjzec used, plasticizers can also confer other changes in<br>
physical and mechanical properties of the compounded polymer, as well as changes<br>
in barrier properties of the compounded polymer in respect to its permeability for<br>
various gases, water, water vapor, or organic compounds. - It is also understood that<br>
one or more different plasticizers can be used In various blends with additional<br>
compounds for the preparation of an extradable or moidable polymer composition.<br>
Such additional compounds can include various inorganic and organic filler<br>
compounds, wood dust, reinforcing fibers, dyes, pigments, stabilizers, lubricants,<br>
anti-microbial additives, and the like,<br>
Plasticizers 'are typically mixed with a polymer by mixing at temperatures<br>
that are above or below the melting point of the polymer. Plasticizers can also be<br>
introduced with a help of an optional volatile solvent. Many variations of<br>
techniques for introducing plasticizer compounds to polymer compositions are<br>
known in the art,<br>
For use as plasticizers, compounds of formula (3) and {4) are preferably<br>
selected from compounds wherein R3 and R6 are C1-C23 linear or branched alkyls,<br>
and preferably C1-C12. Specific choices for R3 and R6 depend on the polymer<br>
selected for plasticization and on the intended properties and application.<br>
The glyccrol ketal levulinic adducts of formula (3), (4)s and (5a) are useful<br>
as plasticizer compounds for PVC, poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), poly(lactate), and<br>
various polysacchamte polymers. Compounds of formula (3), (4) and (Sa) are<br>
compatible with, these polymers across abroad range of concentrations.<br>
Compounds of formula (4) and (5a) are preferred for plasticization of PVC, as<br>
plasticizers with a substantial content of free hydroxyl group are generally not<br>
desired in compounded PVC resins due to stability problems of the PVC resin. By<br>
selecting various R3 and R6 moieties in the reactants used in the synthesis of these<br><br>
adducts, it is also possible to fine-tune the properties of the plasticizer not only In,<br>
respect to best plasticixation properties and best compatibility, but also in respect to<br>
the barrier properties of the resulting polymer, e.g., its permeability to moisture,<br>
gases, solvents, water leaching, and odor and state retention. Depending on the<br>
desired properties, compounds of formula (3), (4), and (5 a) can be used at various<br>
concentrations, typically, between. 5 and 80% by weight of the plasticized polymer<br>
composition. However, in practice it is sufficient to provide 5 to 25% by weight<br>
plasticizer to achieve significant lowering of the glass transition point and thus<br>
obtain useful polymeric compositions. The plasticizer compounds (3), (4), and (5a)<br>
can be used as individual compounds or as mixtures, including mixtures comprising<br>
other plasticizers known in the art such as aromatic and aliphatic diearboxylic<br>
esters, epoxidized triglycerides, and the like;<br>
Synthesis of polymeric glycerol levulinate ketal compounds from the monomers of<br>
The compound of formula (5) and the compounds of formulae (3) and (4),<br>
inclusive of compounds with defined cis- or trans- stereochemistry, such as (3a),<br>
(3b), (4a), (4b), can be further polymerized to provide for a variety of co-polymer<br>
compositions of glycerol and levulmate having at least one unit of formula (6):<br><br>
wherein q is an integer.<br>
The cyclic ketal-lactone compounds of formula (5) and (Sa) are particularly<br>
suitable for use in polymerization under ring opening living polymerization<br>
conditions. Such conditions are well known in the art and are known to yield high .<br>
molecular weight melt-processable polymers suitable for a variety of uses in the<br>
manufacturing of various plastics and. fibers.. For example, U.S. Patents Nos.<br>
5,028,667, 5,292,859, 5,095,098, and 5,210,108 contain descriptions of catalysts<br>
and methods of use suitable for carrying out living polymerization of various<br><br>
lactones and mixtures thereof. Similarly, J, Macromolecules (2001, 34, 864,1 -8648)<br>
contains a description of conditions and catalysts for polymerizing dioxanones.<br>
These conditions and catalysts have beeri found to be useful in the polymerization or<br>
co-polymerization of compounds of formula 5 and/or 5(a) to form perfectly<br>
alternating ketal-ester copolymers of glycerol and levulioate comprising the cis-unit<br>
of formula (lb). Such polymers are clear thermoplastic transparent polymers that<br>
can be obtained in a practically colorless form and can be melt-processed, extruded,<br>
'cast, and rolled to a variety of shapes.<br>
Synthesis of polymers comprising the unit of formula (6) are not limited to<br>
living polymerization. The hydroxyesters (3) and diesters (4) can also be converted<br>
to useful polymers comprising at least one unit of formula (6) by a<br>
polycondensation reaction in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The art of synthesis<br>
of various polyesters by polycondensation is old and many examples of suitable<br>
 catalysts are known.. It has been found that many known catalysts for the synthesis<br>
of polyesters can be used to make polymers comprising at least one unit of formula<br>
(6). Non-limiting examples of suitable catalysts include alkali and transitional metal<br>
aikoxides, germanium oxide, alkali metal alkoxides, sodium, and acids. Further<br>
examples include various alkoxldes of titanium and tin (H) octanoate. Other<br>
descriptions of catalysis and methods of their use can be found, for example, in<br>
United States Patents Nos. 4,133,800, 4,205,157, 4,208,527.5,028,667,5,095,098,<br>
5,210,108, 5,208,2.97, 5,202,413, 5,292,859 5,342,969, 5,565,545, 6,828,272, and<br>
references cited therein.<br>
The compounds of formulae (3) and (4), inclusive of compounds with<br>
defined cis- or tram- stereochemistry, such as (3a), (3b), (4a), and (4b), are typically<br>
polymerized in the presence of an effective quantity of a polycondensation catalyst,<br>
and under conditions allowing for the removal of an alcohol (R3OH) or an ester<br>
(R6COOR3) by distillation. For polymerization of these compounds, it is preferred<br>
(but not necessary) that the R3OH alcohol is a primary or secondary alcohol, and it<br>
is also preferred that the ester of formula R6COOR3 and/or the alcohol R3OH that<br>
form during polycondensation have boiling points sufficiently below-the boiling<br><br>
point of the monomers of formula (3), (4), and/or(5) so that they can be removed.<br>
with ease from the body of the forming polymer.<br>
The polymerization.; reactions can be carried out in the presence of an inert<br>
solvent, or in a neat form,. Preferred non-limiting examples of solvents are<br>
hydrocarbons, haJogenated hydrocarbons, and ethers..<br>
The properties of the resulting polymers differ, depending OH the degree of<br>
polymerization and the stereochemistry of the monomers used in their synthesis. .<br>
The ester-ketal polymers of glycerol and levulinate comprising the unit of<br>
formula (6) are useful as polymeric plasticizers with various polymers. For<br>
'example, these polymers are used for plasticizing PVC, polyesters such as PHA,<br>
PHB, and PLA, and polysaccharides such as acylated cellulose. For plasticization<br>
of these polymers,, the ester-ketal polymers of glycerol arc blended with<br>
unplasticized polymers typically at elevated temperatures, sufficient to melt or-soften<br>
the ingredient with the highest melting point, and preferably, under Inert, atmosphere<br>
(to minimize any decomposition of the polymer plasticized). Plasticization with<br>
these compounds can also be accomplished with the aid of a solvent that is typically<br>
removed after a homogeneous blend is obtained. Plasticized compositions may<br>
contain other additives such as stabilizers, inorganic and organic fillers, reinforcing<br>
 fibers, pigments, dyes, and the like, Plasticized compositions comprising the<br>
polymers having ester-ketal repeat units of formula (6) can be cast or molded or<br>
extruded into films, fibers, tubing, pipes, and other objects of various shapes that are<br>
typically used to produce various consumer and industrial products from, other<br>
known plastieized compositions of PVC, PHA, PHB, PLA, and polysaccharides.<br>
Reaction of glycerol levulinate ketal compounds with epoxides of normal alpha-<br>
olefins<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds of formula (3) are reacted with<br>
epoxid.es. Preferably, the compounds of formula (3) are esters and not free acids or<br>
salts. The epoxides are epoxides of normal alpha-olefins (NAO) or epoxidized<br>
unsaturated fatty acid esters.<br><br>
The first set of reaction products can be formed fey the reaction of<br>
compounds of formula (3) and NAO epoxides. The resulting products have a<br>
formula (7):<br><br>
wherein R3 is a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl or alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or<br>
alkyloxyalkyl, and one of R7 or R8 is hydrogen and the other Is a C6-C30 linear alkyl,<br>
Preferably, a C6-C14 linear alkyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (7) are prepared from the 1,2-epoxides of MAO<br>
having formula (8):.<br><br>
wherein R9 is a C6-C30 linear alkyl, and preferably, a C6-C30 linear alkyl<br>
The compounds of formula (8) are reacted with' the compounds of formula<br>
(3) in the presence of an acid catalyst, and optionally, an inert co-solvent<br>
Typically, catalysts for reacting epoxides with the compound of formula (3)<br>
include various acids that are known in the art. Such conditions are generally<br>
applicable to the reactions of the compound of formula (3) with Epoxidized<br>
unsaturated fatty acid esters.. Non-limiting examples of such catalysts include<br>
strong mineral acids, such as sulfuric, hydrochloric, hydrofluoroboric, hydrobromic<br>
acids, P-tolueiiesulfonic acid, camphorosulfonic acid,, metfaanesulfonic acid, and<br>
like, Various resins that contain psotonated sulfonic acid groups are also useful as<br>
.they can be easily recovered after completion of the reaction. Examples of acids<br>
also include Lewis acids.. For example, boron trifluoride and various complexes of<br>
BF3, exemplified by-BF3 diethyl etherate, are also useful. - Examples of other Lewis<br>
acids include anhydrous SnCl2, SnCl4, TiCl4, AlCl3, silica, acidic alumina, titania,<br>
zirconia, various acidic clays, mixed aluminum, or magnesium oxides, and the like.<br>
Activated carbon derivatives comprising mineral acid, sulfonic acid, or Lewis acid<br>
derivatives can also be used.<br><br>
The present disclosure is not limited to a specific catalyst or an amount of<br>
catalyst. One of ordinary skill in the art can practice many variations on the part of<br>
the catalyst composition and the amounts used in the preparation described herein.<br>
Elevated temperatures may be -used to accelerate the reaction with less reactive<br>
catalysts, however, the tempera toe of the reaction mixture is not critical for<br>
succeeding in making a quantity of the glyceryi ether product, as even with less<br>
active catalysts the reaction still proceeds to yield the desired compounds. Amount<br>
and type of catalyst depends on the specific chemical composition of the epoxide<br>
and of the compound of formula (3) used in the reaction, and can be readily<br>
established by one skilled in the art.'<br>
The reaction with epoxides can be carried out in the presence of an optional<br>
co-solvent that is inert under reaction conditions and is typically removed at the end<br>
of the reaction by distillation. Typically, it is desired to use a sufficient quantity of a<br>
co-solvent or a reactant, such as the compound of formula (3), to minimize cross-<br>
linking of the epoxides via ether bond formation. Non-limiting examples of suitable<br>
co-solvents include saturated hydrocarbons,-ethers, and polyethers. Typically, any<br>
excess solvent and un-reacted starting material are removed after completion of the<br>
reaction by distillation at normal or reduced pressure. It is also preferred to<br>
neutralize or otherwise remove the acid catalyst prior to distillation.<br>
Because the compounds of formula (3) are very good solvents for NAO<br>
epoxides, the reaction between epoxide and the glycerol derivative of formula (3}<br>
can also be conveniently conducted in the excess of the latter compound, typically at<br>
2 to 20 times molar excess. When insufficient excess of the compound (3) is used,<br>
oligomeric polyether adducts of epoxide and the compound of formula (3) are<br>
formed.<br>
The compounds of formula (7) are further converted by saponification to the<br>
alkali or alkali-earth metal salts of the carboxylic acid having formula (7a).<br><br><br>
Saponlfication is typically carried out in water or water-alcohol mixtures in<br>
the presence of a sufficient amount of alkali or alkali-earth metal hydroxide or<br>
carbonate, and after removal of any excess of the compound of formula (3) and/or<br>
co-solvent, e.g. by distillation under reduced pressure. The salts of the compound<br>
of formula (7a) can, be stored and used in an aqueous solution, or, after evaporation<br>
of water and any volatile co-solvents, in a substantially anhydrous neat form.<br>
Reaction of glycerol levulinate ketal compounds with epoxides of unsaturated fatty<br>
acid esters<br>
Another set of compounds is provided herein by using reaction of the<br>
compound of formula (3)-with epoxides of unsaturated fatty acid esters. Preferably,<br>
the compounds of formula (3) are esters and not free acids or salts. These epoxides<br>
are prepared in the manner substantially similar to the above-described methods for<br>
making compounds of formula (7) from the NAO epoxides of formula (8).<br>
Unsaturated fatty acids mean linear monocarboxylic acids having from 10 to<br>
24 carbon atoms and at least one double bond. The double bonds can be in any<br>
position, conjugated with each other or non-conjugated, but not in allenic<br>
arrangements, and any of the double bonds can be independently cis or trans.<br>
Preferably, unsaturated fatty acids have one to three double bonds. Fatty acids can<br>
also be composed of a mixture of various unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, for<br>
example, as in the triglycerides of various vegetable oils, fish oils, and palm oils.<br>
Esters of unsaturated fatty acids mean esters of the above-described fatty<br>
acids with monohydric or with polyhydric alcohols.<br>
Monohydric alcohols are linear or branched primary or secondary alkanols<br>
or alkoxyalkanols having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred examples of<br>
alkanols are methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, secondary butanol,<br>
isobutanot, isoarayl alcohol, 2-ethylhexanol. Preferred alkoxyalkanols are primary<br>
or secondary alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, wherein a linear, branched,<br>
or cyclic aikoxy group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms is located at a vicinal<br>
position to the hydroxyl group. Such alkoxyalkanols are typically derived by<br>
opening an atkyl oxirane with an. alkanol Another suitable example of an<br><br>
atkoxyalkanol is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol readily accessible via hydrogenatton of<br>
furfural. The most preferred are morsobydric alcohols due to their availability, cost<br>
and'Satisfactory stability of their esters.<br>
Polyhydric alcohols are linear or branched polyhydroxylated alkanes having<br>
from i to 6 hydroxyl groups. Typical examples are ethylene glycol, propylene 1,2-<br>
and 1,3-diots, butylerse glycol isomers, glycerol, 1,2,4-trihydroxybutane,<br>
pentaerythritol, xylitol, ribitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and gaiactitol Polyhydric<br>
alcohols can optionally contain, one or more ether bonds, and suitable examples of<br>
such polyhydrie alcohols are isosorbide, sorbitane isomers, and diglycerol.<br>
It is preferred that substantially all hydroxy! groups of the polyhydrie<br>
alcohol are esterified with an tmsaturated fatty acid group. It is understood that in<br>
the industrial practice it may not be practical to achieve a Ml esterification. It is<br>
also understood that in -the industrial practice, where mixed fatty acid compositions<br>
are used, not all of the fatty acid groups can be unsaturated arid some fully saturated<br>
fatty acid groups can be present. In fact, it is cost-advantageous to use mixtures of<br>
unsaturated and saturated fatty acid esters such as present in triglycerid.es of typical<br>
vegetable oils (e.g. soybean oil, linseed oil, canola oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil,<br>
corn oil, castor oil, their blends and the like); It is preferred, however, that the<br>
mixed fatty acid esters contain predominantly unsaturated fatty acid esters. It is also<br>
preferred that a fatty acid .tester with a high content of mono-unsaturated fatty acid<br>
ester is used, such as compositions found in high oleic canola oil. Esters of 10-<br>
undecylenic acid are also preferred. Another preferred starting material is a mixture<br>
of methyl esters of fatty acids derived by trans-esterification of vegetable oils (e.g.,<br>
of soybean oil, canola oil and other unsaturated triglycerides commonly used in the<br>
industrial production of various biodiesel fuels).<br>
Various unsaturated fatty acid esters can be optionally blended, mixed,<br>
partially hydrogenarated, or otherwise isomerized to change position or<br>
stereochemistry of the double bonds.<br>
Epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid ester means that at least one of the double<br>
bonds of the unsaturated fatty acid ester is oxidized to an epoxy group. Such<br>
oxidations are well known in the art and can be readily accomplished in an<br><br>
industrial scale, e.g., by using hydrogen peroxide and a carboxylic acid (e.g.,<br>
formate or acetate), or by the balohydrin method. It is preferred however, that<br>
epoxidation. of a majority or all of the double bonds present in the unsaturated fatty<br>
acid ester is accomplished. It is understood that in practice, epoxidized fatty acid<br>
esters may contain various quantities of by-products arising from, hydrolysis or<br>
rearrangement of epoxides and from cross-linking of the fatty acid chains. Use of<br>
epoxidized fatty acid esters containing small quantities of epoxidation by-products<br>
and epoxide decomposition by-products is fully within the scope of the present<br>
disclosure,<br>
Ethers derived from epoxid.es of mono-unsaturated fatty acid esters and<br>
compound of formula (3) have formula (9);<br><br>
wherein R3 is a linear, branched, or- cyclic alkyl or alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or<br>
alkyloxyalkyl, one of A or B is H and the other is an esterified carboxyl, and n and<br>
m are integers each having values from 0 to 20, and the value of the sum of m+n is<br>
in the range.from 3 to 21.<br>
When bis-epoxides or tris-epoxides of unsamrated fatty acid esters having<br>
epoxy groups positioned in a close proximity to each other are used, an intramolecular<br>
epoxidc opening reaction takes place, resulting in the formation of one or<br>
more ether bonds each connecting two carbon atoms of the continuous fatty acid<br>
carbon chain. Typically, such ether bonds result in the formation of a<br>
tetrahydrofuran (major) and tetrahydropyran (minor) rings. Thereby forming<br>
complex, mixtures of the stereoisomers of oxygenated derivatives of unsauurated<br>
fatty acid esters comprising pendant ether groups derived from the compound of<br>
formula (3).<br><br>
For example, representative isomers of the such surfactant products from a<br>
bis epoxide derived from adi-unsaturated fatty acid having two double bonds<br>
separated by a methylene group have formulae (10a) and (10b):<br><br>
Compounds of formula (10a) and (10b) axe typically formed as mixtures that<br>
also comprise other adducts such as di(glycery1 levulinate keta!) ether adducts<br>
resulting from opening of each of the epoxy groups with a different molecule of the<br>
compound of formula (3), resulting in oxygenated fatty acid derivatives comprising<br>
two hydroxyl groups and two pendant ether (glyceryl levulinate ketal) groups.<br>
Preferably, the ether adducts of epoxidized fatty acid esters arc formed by<br>
the reaction of the compound of formula (3), in the presence of a catalyst, followed<br>
by the removal of any excess compound of formula (3) and any co-solvent by<br>
distillation, under reduced pressure:<br>
Alternatively, the adducts of epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid esters and<br>
compound of formula (3) can be prepared by treating epoxidized triglycerides with<br>
the compound of formula (3) in the presence of a catalyst. In such alternative<br>
embodiment, triglyceride polyol compounds are formed, These compounds have<br>
free secondary' hydroxyl groups and (glyceryl levulinate ketal ester) ether pendant<br>
groups attached to the fatty acid chains. Optionally, ether bonds may also be<br>
present in such adducts and the ether bonds can connect two carbon atoms of one<br>
fatty add chain (thereby forming a tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydropyran ring) or two<br>
different fatty acid chains.<br>
Such adducts of glycerol, or of a ketal/acetal protected glycerol, with the<br>
epoxidized triglycerides are typically prepared from known, in the art epoxidized<br>
soybean, oil, linseed oil, and the like. These'adducts are found herein to be useful to<br><br>
produce compounds of formulae (9), (10a)Â» and (10b) The conversion of the<br>
triglyceride adducts to the compounds of formulae (9), (10a), and (10b) can be<br>
accomplished by a trans-esterification reaction with a moeohydric alkanol in the<br>
presence of a catalytic amount of base. The non-limiting examples of syllable bases<br>
are hydroxides of alkali or alkali-earth metals or alkoxides of alkali metals and<br>
alkanols.<br>
The carboxyl group in the ether adducts of compound (3) and the<br>
hydroxylated fatty acid esters can be further subjected to saponification to furnish a<br>
salt (typically, alkali, alkali-earth, ammonium, or arninc salt of the dicarboxylic<br>
compounds having formulae (11), 12(a), and 12(b):<br><br>
wherein one of E or D is hydrogen and the other is carboxyl. Alternatively, the salt<br>
compounds of formulae (11), 12(a), and 12(b) are obtained by direct saponification<br>
of the adduct of the compound of formula (3) with epoxidized trig!ycerides.<br>
The carboxyl group of the compounds of formula (7 a), (13), 12(a), and 12(b)<br>

or more of the catalysts and conditions described above for the preparation of<br>
homopolymers comprising fee repeating unit of formula (la). The resulting co-<br>
polymers cart be terminated with either hydroxyls or esterified earboxyls. Polymers<br>
can be linear, branched, star-shaped, or cross-linked, and can be random co-<br>
polymers, block copolymers, graft copolymera, or any combination thereof.<br>
Of particular interest and utility are the hydroxyl terminated polymers and<br>
co-polymers comprising the repeating units of formula (la). Such compounds have<br>
been found to be useful for making polyurethane polymers with widely varying .<br>
properties,<br>
Many polyurethane polymers and methods of their preparation are known in<br>
the art. Polyurethane polymers are compounds of exceptional industrial utility; they<br>
find numerous applications because the final properties of the resulting polymer can<br>
be influenced greatly through selection of active hydrogen monomers (typically,<br>
polyhydroxyl compounds) and isocyanates used, and by selecting the conditions<br>
used to prepare the finished polymer products.<br>
Many of the polymers comprising the repeating unit of formula (6) are<br>
useful for making polyurethane polymers,. For use in polyurethane synthesis, a<br>
polymer comprising the repeating unit of formula (6) can be prepared in a hydroxyl-<br>
terminated form, wherein two or more hydroxyl groups are present on average per<br>
representative polymer structure. This is typically accomplished by carrying out<br>
the polymerization reaction with at least one monomer selected front the<br>
stereoisorners of compounds of formula (3), (4), (5), and (5a) in the presence a<br>
sufficient amount of a co-polymer polyhydric alcohol having two or more hydroxyl<br>
groups, so that polymerization product has preferably an average molecular weight<br>
in excess of 500 Da, more preferably, in excess of 1000 Da, and has two or more<br><br>
hydroxyl groups. The resulting polymerization product comprising the unit of<br>
formula (6) can be a linear, branched, cross-linked, or star-shaped polymer. One or<br>
more of such polymerization product comprising the unit of formula (6) can then be<br>
used as polyol compounds in a reaction with one or more isocyanate compounds<br>
having two or more isocyanate groups. Many suitable isocyanate compounds are<br>
known in the art of polyurethane synthesis. Non-limiting examples of isocyanate<br>
compounds include diisocyanate compounds such as tolylene diisocyamte isomers,<br>
hexarrsethytene diisocyanate, pentameihylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate,<br>
4,4'-methyleebis(phenyl isocyanate), and the like. Further non-limiting examples<br>
of isocyanate compounds include poJyisocyanate compounds, and can be obtained<br>
by reacting one of the above diisocyanate compounds with a polyhydric alcohol or a<br>
polyhydric amine. Non-limiting examples of suitable polyisocyanatc compounds<br>
also include adducts of one or more diisocyanate compounds obtained by reacting<br>
one or more of the polyhydric products comprising the repeating unit of formula (6)<br>
under conditions sufficient to cause reaction between the hydroxyl group and an .<br>
isocyanate group.. It has been found that such polyisocyanate compounds can be<br>
obtained by mixing appropriate quantities of various aliphatic and/or aromatic<br>
diisocyanate-compounds with a polyhydric alcohol comprising the repeating units of<br>
formula (6), and causing reaction to occur by means of heating and/or with catalysts<br>
sufficient to accelerate the reaction. Non-limiting examples of typical catalysts<br>
suitable for making the polyisocyanate compounds include dibutyl tin dilaurate, 1,4-<br>
diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCOâ„¢, TED), and the like, The .reaction of making<br>
a polyisocyanate compound from a polyhydric alcohol comprising the units of .<br>
formula (6) can be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent, which may<br>
optionally be removed at the end of the reaction by distillation.<br>
One or more of the polyhydric alcohols comprising a repeating unit of<br>
formula (6) can then be reacted with one or more isocyanate compounds having two<br>
or more isocyanate groaps per representative molecule, thereby providing for a<br>
polyurethane polymer comprising one ore more units of formula (6) per<br>
representative polymer molecule.<br><br>
Such reactions occur readily under conditions typically known to those in<br>
the art of palyurethane synthesis, and include use of one ore more catalysts known<br>
in the art and/or elevated temperatures. Non-limiting representative examples of<br>
typical catalysts include dibutyi tin diiaurate and DABCO. Elevated temperatures<br>
expedite formation of the desired polyurethane polymer, and typically, temperatures<br>
between 30 and 160Â°C are sufficient to commence and accelerate the reaction. The<br>
reaction can be conducted at temperatures outside of the specified range, however,<br>
at lower temperatures, the reactions may be quite slow, while at higher<br>
temperatures, side reactions and partial polymer decomposition may occur, in<br>
general, preparation of polyurethane polymers comprising repeat units of formula<br>
(6) is an exothermic reaction and is successful without additional heating. Synthesis<br>
of polyurethane polymer comprising units of formula (6) is preferably carried out<br>
under substantially anhydrous conditions. If small quantities of water are present,<br>
the product is typically a foam polymer comprising both urethane and urea linkages.<br>
If a foam polymer is desired, the reaction is carried out using one more inert<br>
propellant compounds known in the art.<br>
Various polyurethane polymers comprising units of formula (6) can thus be<br>
prepared and used to manufacture a plethora of polyurethane goods that in a way<br>
substantially similar to polyurethane polymers known in the art. Pol yurethane<br>
polymers comprising the units of formula (6) can be solid or viscous liquids, rigid or<br>
flexible, and they can be prepared as thermoset or thermoplastic polymers.<br>
Depending on the specific polymer composition, they can be cast, extruded, or<br>
otherwise shaped in a variety of forms needed to manufacture finished polymer<br>
goods. The polyurethane polymers comprising units of formula (6) can contain<br>
various additives known in the art, such organic or inorganic fillers, pigments,<br>
stabilizers, anti-oxidants, and lubricants<br>
The polyurethane polymers disclosed herein are made with use of low-cost<br>
renewable monomers to provide the predominant part of the weight of the resulting<br>
polymers, thereby offering a cost advantage when compared to the known in the ait<br>
polyurethanes made predominantly or exclusively with use of non-renewable<br>
petroleum- or coal-derived monomers.<br><br>
The polyurethane polymers comprising units of formula (6) are also<br>
recyclable at the monomer level. If so desired, at the end of their useful life, the<br>
polyurethane polymers comprising the units of formula (6) can be treated by a trans-<br>
esterification reaction, to allow for the decomposition of the polymers and the<br>
formation of one or more monomers of formulae (3), (4), (5), and (5a), which can be<br>
recovered, purified and re-used.<br>

Example 75<br>
506.2 grams of a fully epoxidised soybean oil (Vicoflex 7170 brand,<br>
Arkema) were mixed with 1 L of anhydrous methanolic solution containing 2,1 g of<br>
sodium methoxide, and the resulting mixture was magnetically stirred at room<br>
temperature (18 Â°C) for 6 hours. The progression of trans-esterification over time<br>
was followed by gas chrowatography. After the trans-esterification reaction was<br>
found to he substantially complete, the reaction mixture was neutralized by the<br>
addition of 12.S grams of finely powdered anhydrous potassium dihydrogen ,<br>
phosphate, followed by an additional stirring overnight (12 hours). The resulting<br>
mixture was filtered and the methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure using<br>
a rotary evaporator with a water bath set to 40 Â°C. The resulting oil was dissolved<br>
in 1 L of hexanes, filtered, and the hexanes were removed under reduced pressure<br><br>
using a rotary evaporator. A clear transparent product with weak oily odor (485 g)<br>

effect a trans-esterification reaction. The solution was monitored, by GC-MS for<br>
appearance of methyl levulinate and methyl 4,4-methoxypentanoate. After the<br>
reaction was deemed complete (about 6 hours), both solutions were neutralized with<br>
100 mg of sodium bicarbonate, filtered, and stripped of methanol under reduced<br>
pressure, to give a mixture of 1 -glyceryl ether modified fatty acid esters (as oily<br>

The glyceryl ether adducts were then mixed with 0.2 g of titanium<br>
isopropylate and heated to 95-100 Â°C tinder 6 mm vacuum, with stirring, until the<br>
content had become viscous (about 3 tare), to give highly branched or crosslinked<br>
polyester-polyetber compounds having molecular weights of approximately 3,500<br>
Da.<br>
5 gram portions of each of the resulting cross-linked polymers were mixed<br>
with. 0.5 ml of methylethyiketone and 0.3 grams of tolylene diisocyamate, and 0.01 g<br>

and heated to 160-180 Â°C for 6 hours under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure, and<br>
thai under 1 ram vacuum, to remove any unreacted compound of formula (3). The<br><br>
resulting polymer (42g) was a water-insoluble polyhydroxylated graft polymer with<br>
a cellulose polymer backbone and pendant groups comprising repeating units of<br>
formula (6), the polymer was a transparent agar-like gel practically insoluble in<br>
water.<br>
Example 90 <br>
Reaction product mixtures comprising epoxide adducts prepared in<br>
Examples 56-67 and 76 were each stripped of the excess of hydroxyester compound<br>
of formula (3) by distillation under reduced pressure. 3.2-3.3 grams of each of the<br>
resulting products were saponified with 10 ml of 1M sodium hydroxide by vigorous<br>
stirring for 2 hrs at 85-90 Â°C. Excess base was neutralized by titration with aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid to pH 8-9, and the solutions were diluted with water to a final<br>
volume of 15 ml. The solutions of sodium salts of the saponified adducts of the<br>
compound of formula (3) with the various epoxides were then examined for their<br>
surfactant properties using a 1:1 hexane-water emulsion forming test, and by<br>
evaluating the stability of such emulsions in-the presence and in the absence of<br>
calcium or magnesium ions (final concentrations of 1% CaCl2 or 1% MgCl2 were<br>
used in the emulsion tests). In addition the saponified compounds were also tested<br>
in hexane-water emulsion tests at pH 3, and non-saponified compounds were also<br>
tested for their surfactant properties at pH 7. All emulsion tests were performed at<br>
room temperature.<br>
Salts of the compounds obtained by saponification of the epoxide adducts of<br>
Example 76 and of Examples 56-60 were found to be good surfactants capable of<br>
forming and supporting stable hexane-water emulsions, and their surfactant<br>
properties were not adversely affected by the presence of calcium or magnesium<br>
ions. At acidic pH, the properties of the compounds Example 76 and Examples 56-<br>
60 were also found satisfactory. Non-saponified compounds.of Examples 56-60<br>
were found to be "water-in-oil" type emulsifiers.<br><br>
Example 91<br>
Plasticized polymer compositions and various blends of the polymeric<br>
compounds comprising fragment of formula (6) were prepared by a melt mixing and<br>
extrusion method, using one of the following polymers:<br>
(a)	PVC, poly(vinylchloride) powder (average Mn ca. 55,000,<br>
average Mw 97,000, inherent viscosity 0.92, relative viscosity<br>
2.23, supplier Sigma-Aldrich Company, Cat. No. 34,677-2),<br>
(b)	PHB, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), (natural origin, Tm 72 oC,<br>
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Cat. No, 36,3S0-2),.<br>
(c)	AC, a cellulose acetate polymer with 39,8% acetyl content and<br>
Mn ca, 30,000 (Sigma-Aldrich Cat. No, 18,095-5),<br>
(d)	PLA (L-polylactide, inherent viscosity 0,90-1.20, Average Mw<br>
10,000-150,000, Tg 48.5 Â°C, Supplied by Sigma-Aldrich<br>
Company, Cat. No. 53, 117-0).<br>
Plasticized and blended compositions were prepared at a 5 g scale by prc-<br>
mixing cold ingredients. Each of the resulting mixtures were individually fed into a<br>
pre-cleaned, miniature twin-screw mixer-extruder chamber of a Daca<br>
Microcompounder (Daca Instruments) under nitrogen, with the mixing chamber<br>
heated to 5-10 Â°C above the melting temperature of the component with the highest<br>
melting point, and the motor speed was set to 100 rpm. The samples were mixed for<br>
about 5 minutes, and the resulting melt was then extruded out of the mixing<br>
chamber as a flexible rod (diameter 3 mm), which was immediately cooled to room<br>
temperature in ambient air.<br>
The plastlcizers and the polymer blends were tested at several concentrations<br>
including at least one compound of the present disclosure at 5,10,25, and 50% by<br>
weight of the resulting composition.<br>
Glass transition temperature data (by differential scanning calorimetry), and<br>
plasticizer exudation data were collected using plasticized specimens cut from the<br>
extruded rods that have shown a satisfactory compatibility and acceptably low<br>
levels of exudation of the polymer composition components.<br><br>
Polymer Wends comprising one of PHB, PLA, .and AC. were .found<br>
compatible in a broad concentration range with the polymeric compounds prepared<br>
in Examples 26-28,33, 50,? 51 / 65.-73, 89. "Such blends were significantly<br>
plasticized, as displayed by significantly lowered glass transition points in<br>
comparison with non-plasticized PHB, PLA, and AC The same compounds were<br>
also found to have limited compatibility with FVC (up to 10%), reducing the glass<br>
transition point of the plasticized PVC by about 15-30 Â°C.<br>
PHB, PLA, AC polymers were also successfully plasticized with compounds<br>
prepared in Examples 34-49, as well as with the compound of formula (5); (5a), and<br>
with the compound of formula (3) and (4), except cases wherein R3 was H.<br>
Among the compounds tested, the PVC polymer was most successfully<br>
plasticized with compounds prepared according to Examples 80{a), 81 (a), 57-61, 76<br>
(after removal of excess of compound 3 by distillation), compounds of formula 5a,<br>
and compounds of formula (3) and (4), wherein both R3 and R6 were C4-C8 linear or<br>
branched alkyls.<br>
Example 92<br>
2.1 grams of the polyurethane polymer comprising repeating unite of<br>
formula (6) obtained in Example 52 were stirred at room temperature in 15 ml of<br>
absolute ethanol containing 0.5*8% of sodium ethoxide until complete dissolution was<br>
observed (about 5 hours).. The resulting solution was neutralized by stirring for 1<br>
hour with powdered potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and the ethanol was distilled<br>
out under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in tert-butyl methyl, ether<br>
and filtered. The filtrate was analyzed by GC-MS and was found to contain 95%<br>
pure compound of formula (3) (R3=Et, cis/irans isomer mixture). The tert-butyl<br>
methyl ether was evaporated under reduced pressure, yielding about 1.52 g of the<br>
neat compound of formula (3)<br>
Example 93<br>
The reaction was carried out according to Example 92, except the<br>
polyurethane polymer was 23 grams of the polymer prepared in Example 54, and n-<br><br>
butanol with 0.3% of sodium n-butoxide was used. The resulting neat monomer<br>
(1.78 g) was a 97% pure compound of formula (3) (R3=n-Bw, cis/trans isomer<br>
mixture),<br>
