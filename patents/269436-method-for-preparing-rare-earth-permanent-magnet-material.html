				<td>DESCRIPTION METHOD FOR PREPARING RARE EARTH PERMANENT MAGNET MATERIAL<br>
[0001]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a method for preparing a high-performance rare earth permanent magnet material having a reduced amount of expensive Tb or Dy used.<br>
[0002]<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
By virtue of excellent magnetic properties, Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets find an ever increasing range of application. The recent challenge to the environmental problem has expanded the application range of these magnets from household electric appliances to industrial equipment, electric automobiles and wind power generators. It is required to further improve the performance of Nd-Fe-B magnets. [0003]<br>
Indexes for the performance of magnets include remanence (or residual magnetic flux density) and coercive force. An increase in the remanence of Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets can be achieved by increasing the volume factor of Nd2Fe14B compound and improving the crystal orientation. To this end, a number of modifications have been made on the process. For increasing coercive force, there are known different approaches including grain refinement, the use of alloy compositions with greater Nd contents, and the addition of effective elements. The currently most common approach is to use alloy compositions having Dy or Tb substituted for part of Nd. Substituting these elements for Nd in the Nd2Fe14B compound increases both the anisotropic magnetic field and the coercive force of the compound. The substitution with Dy or Tb, on the other hand, reduces the<br>
saturation magnetic polarization of the compound. Therefore, as long as the above approach is taken to increase coercive force, a loss of remanence is unavoidable. Since Tb and Dy are expensive metals, it is desired to minimize their addition amount. [0004]<br>
In Nd-Fe-B magnets, the coercive force is given by the magnitude of an external magnetic field created by nuclei of reverse magnetic domains at grain boundaries. Formation of nuclei of reverse magnetic domains is largely dictated by the structure of the grain boundary in such a manner that any disorder of grain structure in proximity to the boundary invites a disturbance of magnetic structure, helping formation of reverse magnetic domains. It is generally believed that a magnetic structure extending from the grain boundary to a depth of about 5 nm contributes to an increase of coercive force. It is difficult to acquire a morphology effective for increasing coercive force. [0005]<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
Problem to Be Solved by the Invention While the invention has been made in view of the above-discussed problems, its object is to provide a method for preparing a rare earth permanent magnet material in the form of R-Fe-B sintered magnet wherein R is two or more elements selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y, the magnet exhibiting high performance despite a minimized amount of Tb or Dy used.<br>
[0007]<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
The inventors discovered (in PCT/JP2005/5134) that when a R-Fe-B sintered magnet (wherein R is one or more elements selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y), typically a Nd-Fe-B sintered magnet, with a powder based on one or more of an oxide of R, a fluoride of R and an oxyfluoride of R being disposed on the magnet surface, is heated at a temperature below the sintering temperature, R contained in the powder is absorbed in the magnet body so that Dy or Tb is concentrated only in proximity to grain boundaries for enhancing the ahisotropic magnetic field only in proximity to the boundaries whereby the coercive force is increased while suppressing a decline of remanence. However, since Dy or Tb is fed from the magnet body surface, this method has a possibility that it becomes more difficult to<br>
attain the coercive force increasing effect as the magnet<br>
body becomes larger in size.<br>
[0008]<br>
Further continuing the research, the inventors have discovered that when the step of heating an R-Fe-B sintered magnet (wherein R is one or more elements selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y), typically a Nd-Fe-B sintered magnet, with a powder based on one or more of an oxide of R, a fluoride of R and an oxyfluoride of R being disposed on the magnet surface, at a temperature below the sintering temperature for thereby causing R in the powder to be absorbed in the magnet body is repeated at least two times, Dy or Tb is concentrated only in proximity to grain boundaries even in the case of relatively large-sized magnet bodies, for enhancing the anisotropic magnetic field only in proximity to the boundaries whereby the coercive force is increased while suppressing a decline of remanence.

[0010]<br>
BENEFITS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, a rare earth permanent magnet material can be prepared as an R-Fe-B sintered magnet with high performance and a minimized amount of Tb or Dy used.<br>
[0011]<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to a method for preparing an R-Fe-B sintered magnet exhibiting high performance and having a minimized amount of Tb or Dy used. [0012]<br>
The invention starts with an R-Fe-B sintered magnet body which is obtainable from a mother alloy by a standard procedure including crushing, fine pulverization, compaction and sintering.<br>
As used herein, both R and R1 are selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y. R is mainly used for the finished magnet body while R1 is mainly used for the starting material. [0013]<br>
The mother alloy contains R1, T, A and optionally M. R1 is at least one element selected from rare earth elements<br>
inclusive of Sc and Y. specifically from among So, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, and Lu, with Nd, Pr and Dy being preferably predominant. It is preferred that rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y account for 10 to 15 atom%, more preferably 12 to 15 atom% of the overall alloy. Desirably R1 contains at least 10 atom%, especially at least 50 atom% of Nd and/or Pr based on the entire R1. T is one or both elements selected from iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co). The content of Fe is preferably at least 50 atom%, especially at least 65 atom% of the overall alloy. A is one or both elements selected from boron (B) and carbon (C). It is preferred that A account for 2 to 15 atom%, more preferably 3 to 8 atom% of the overall alloy. M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Al, Cu, Zn, In, Si, P, S, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Ga, Ge, Zr, Nb, Mo, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, and W, and may be contained in an amount of 0 to 11 atom%, especially 0.1 to 5 atom%. The balance consists of incidental impurities such as nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O). [0014]<br>
The mother alloy is prepared by melting metal or alloy feeds in vacuum or an inert gas atmosphere, preferably argon atmosphere, and casting the melt into a flat mold or book mold or strip casting. A possible alternative is a so-called two-alloy process involving separately preparing an alloy approximate to the R2Fe14B compound composition constituting the primary phase of the relevant alloy and an R-rich alloy serving as a liquid phase aid at the sintering temperature, crushing, then weighing and mixing them. Notably, the alloy approximate to the primary phase composition is subjected to homogenizing treatment, if necessary, for the purpose of increasing the amount of the R2Fe14B compound phase, since<br>
a-Fe is likely to be left depending on the cooling rate during casting and the alloy composition. The homogenizing treatment is a heat treatment at 700 to 1.200° C for at least one hour in vacuum or in an Ar atmosphere. To the R-rich alloy serving as a liquid phase aid, the melt quenching and<br>
strip casting techniques are applicable as well as the<br>
above-described casting technique.<br>
[0015]<br>
The alloy is generally crushed to a size of 0.05 to 3 nun, especially 0.05 to 1.5 mm. The crushing step uses a Brown mill or hydriding pulverization, with the hydriding pulverization being preferred for those alloys as strip cast. The coarse powder is then finely divided to a size of 0.2 to<br>
30 µm, especially 0.5 to 20 µm, for example, by a jet mill<br>
using high-pressure nitrogen.<br>
[0016]<br>
The fine powder is compacted on a compression molding machine under a magnetic field and then placed in a sintering furnace where it is sintered in vacuum or in an inert gas atmosphere usually at a temperature of 900 to 1,250"C, preferably 1.000 to 1,100°C. The sintered magnet thus obtained contains 60 to 99% by volume, preferably 80 to 98% by volume of the tetragonal R2Fe14B compound as the primary phase, with the balance being 0.5 to 20% by volume of an R-rich phase, 0 to 10% by volume of a B-rich phase, and 0.1 to 10% by volume of at least one of R oxides, and carbides, nitrides and hydroxides resulting from incidental impurities, or a mixture or composite thereof. [0017]<br>
The sintered magnet body thus obtained has a composition represented by R1 aTbAcMd wherein R1 is at least one element selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y, T is iron (Fe) and/or cobalt (Co), A is boron (B) and/or carbon (C), M is at least one element selected from the group consisting of A1, Cu, Zn, In, Si, P, S, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Ga, Ge, Zr, Nb, Mo, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, and W, and a to d indicative of atom percent based on the alloy are in the range: 10 
The resulting sintered magnet body is then machined or worked into a predetermined shape. Although its dimensions<br>
may be selected as appropriate, the shape preferably includes a minimum portion having a dimension equal to or less than 15 mm, more preferably of 0.1 to 10 mm and also preferably includes a maximum portion having a dimension of 0.1 to 200 mm, especially 0.2 to 150 mm. Any appropriate shape may be selected. For example, the magnet body may be worked into a plate or cylindrical shape. [0019]<br>
Then a powder is disposed on the sintered magnet body, the powder comprising at least one compound selected from among an oxide of R2, a fluoride of R3, and an oxyfluoride of R4 wherein each of R2, R3, and R4 is at least one element selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y and<br>
having an average particle size equal to or less than 100 µm, after which the magnet body and the powder are heat treated at a temperature equal to or below the sintering temperature of the magnet body in vacuum or in an inert gas for 1 minute to 100 hours for absorption treatment for causing at least one of R2, R3, and R4 in the powder to be absorbed in the magnet body. This heat treatment should be repeated at least two times. [0020]<br>
It is noted that specific examples of R2, R3 and R4 are the same as exemplified for R1 while R1 may be identical with or different from R2, R3 and R4. When the heat treatment is repeated, R2, R3 and R4 may be identical or different among repeated treatments. [0021]<br>
In the powder comprising at least one compound selected from among an oxide of R2, a fluoride of R3, and an oxyfluoride of R4. it is desired for the objects of the invention that R2, R3 or R4 contain at least 10 atom%, more preferably at least 20 atom%, most preferably 40 to 100 atom% of Dy and/or Tb and that the total concentration of Nd and Pr in R2, R3 or R4 is lower than the concentration of Nd and Pr in R1.<br>
[0022]<br>
Also in the powder comprising at least one compound selected from among an oxide of R2, a fluoride of R3, and an oxyfluoride of R4. it is preferred for effective absorption of R that the powder contain at least 40% by weight of the R3 fluoride and/or the R4 oxyfluoride and the balance of one or more components selected from the R2 oxide and carbides, nitrides, oxides, hydroxides, and hydrides of Rs wherein R5 is at least one element selected from rare earth elements inclusive of Sc and Y. [0023]<br>
The oxide of R2, fluoride of R3, and oxyfluoride of R4 used herein are typically R22O3, R3F3, and R4OF, respectively, although they generally refer to oxides containing R2 and oxygen, fluorides containing R3 and fluorine, and oxyfluorides containing R4, oxygen and fluorine, additionally including R2On, R3Fn, and R4OmFn wherein m and n are arbitrary positive numbers, and modified forms in which part of R2 to R4 is substituted or stabilized with another metal element as long as they can achieve the benefits of the invention. [0024]<br>
The powder disposed on the magnet surface contains the oxide of R2, fluoride of R3, oxyfluoride of R4 or a mixture thereof, and may additionally contain at least one compound selected from among hydroxides, carbides, and nitrides of R2 to R4, or a mixture or composite thereof. Further, the powder may contain a fine powder of boron, boron nitride, silicon, carbon or the like, or an organic compound such as stearic acid in order to promote the dispersion or chemical/physical adsorption of the powder. In order for the invention to attain its effect efficiently, the powder may contain at least 40% by weight, preferably at least 60% by weight, even more preferably at least 80% by weight (based on the entire powder) of the oxide of R2, fluoride of R3, oxyfluoride of R4 or a mixture thereof, with even 100% by weight being acceptable.<br>
[0025]<br>
Through the treatment described above, at least one of R2, R3 and R4 is absorbed within the magnet body. For the reason that a more amount of R2, R3 or R4 is absorbed as the filling factor of the powder in the magnet surface-surrounding space is higher, the filling factor should preferably be at least 10% by volume, more preferably at least 40% by volume, calculated as an average value in the magnet surrounding space from the magnet surface to a distance equal to or less than 1 mm. The upper limit of filling factor is generally equal to or less than 95% by volume, and especially equal to or less than 90% by volume, though not particularly restrictive. [0026]<br>
One exemplary technique of disposing or applying the powder is by dispersing a powder comprising one or more compounds selected from an oxide of R2, a fluoride of R3, and an oxyfluoride of R4 in water or an organic solvent to form a slurry, immersing the magnet body in the slurry, and drying in hot air or in vacuum or drying in the ambient air. Alternatively, the powder can be applied by spray coating or the like. Any such technique is characterized by ease of application and mass treatment. Specifically the slurry may contain the powder in a concentration of 1 to 90% by weight, more specifically 5 to 70% by weight. [0027]<br>
The particle size of the powder affects the reactivity when the R2, R3 or R4 component in the powder is absorbed in the magnet. Smaller particles offer a larger contact area that participates in the reaction. In order for the invention to attain its effects, the powder disposed on the magnet should desirably have an average particle size equal<br>
to or less than 100 µm, preferably equal to or less than 10<br>
µm. No particular lower limit is imposed on the particle size although a particle size of at least 1 nm, especially at least 10 nm is preferred. It is noted that the average particle size is determined as a weight average diameter D50<br>
(particle diameter at 50% by weight cumulative, or median diameter) using, for example, a particle size distribution measuring instrument relying on laser diffractometry or the like. [0028]<br>
The amount of at least one element selected from R2, R3 and R* absorbed depends on the size of the magnet body as well as the above-described factors. Accordingly, even when the amount of the powder disposed on the magnet body surface is optimized, the absorbed amount per magnet body unit weight decreases with the increasing size of the magnet body. Repeating the heat treatment two or more times is effective in attaining further enhancement of coercive force. Since more rare earth component is taken into the magnet body by repeating the treatment plural times, the repeated treatment is effective particularly for large-sized magnet bodies. The number of repetitions is determined appropriate in accordance with the amount of powder disposed and the size of a magnet body and is preferably 2 to 10 times, and more preferably 2 to 5 times. Also, since the rare earth component absorbed is concentrated in proximity to grain boundaries, the rare earth in the oxide of R2, fluoride of R3 or oxyfluoride of R4 should preferably contain at least 10 atom%, more preferably at least 20 atom%, and even more preferably at least 40 atom% of Tb and/or Dy. [0029]<br>
After the powder comprising at least one selected from the oxide of R2, fluoride of R3, and oxyfluoride of R4 is disposed on the magnet body surface as described above, the magnet body and the powder are heat treated at a temperature equal to or below the sintering temperature (designated Ts in °C) in vacuum or in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as Ar or He. The temperature of heat treatment is equal to or below Ts'C of the magnet body, preferably equal to or below (Ts-10)oC, and more preferably equal to or below (Ts-20)°C. The lower limit of temperature is preferably at least 210oC, more preferably at least 360°C. The time of heat treatment.<br>
which varies with the heat treatment temperature, is preferably from 1 minute to 100 hours, more preferably from 5 minutes to 50 hours, and even more preferably from 10 minutes to 20 hours. [0030]<br>
After the absorption treatment is repeated as described above, the resulting sintered magnet body is preferably subjected to aging treatment. The aging treatment is desirably at a temperature which is below the absorption treatment temperature, preferably from 200°C to a temperature lower than the absorption treatment temperature by 10° C. The time of aging treatment is preferably from 1 minute to 10 hours, more preferably from 10 minutes to 8 hours. [0031]<br>
Prior to the repetitive absorption treatment, the sintered magnet body as worked into the predetermined shape may be washed with at least one of alkalis, acids and organic solvents or shot blasted for removing a surface affected layer. [0032]<br>

EXAMPLE<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples are given below for further illustrating some embodiments of the invention although the invention is not limited thereto. In Examples, the filling factor (or percent occupancy) of the magnet surface-surrounding space with powder like terbium fluoride is calculated from a dimensional change and weight gain of the magnet after powder treatment and the true density of powder material.<br>
[0037]<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Example 1<br>
An alloy in thin plate form was prepared by a strip casting technique, specifically by using Nd, Pr, Al, Fe and Cu metals having a purity of at least 99% by weight and ferroboron, high-frequency heating in an argon atmosphere for melting, and casting the alloy melt on a copper single roll. The resulting alloy consisted of 12.0 atom% Nd, 1.5 atom% Pr, 0.4 atom% Al, 0.2 atom% Cu, 6.0 atom% B, and the balance of Fe. The alloy was exposed to 0.11 MPa of hydrogen gas at room temperature for hydriding and then heated at 500o C for partial dehydriding while evacuating to vacuum. The hydriding pulverization was followed by cooling and sieving, obtaining a coarse powder under 50 mesh.<br>
[0038]<br>
On a jet mill using high-pressure nitrogen gas, the coarse powder was finely pulverized to a mass median particle diameter of 5.0 µm. The resulting fine powder was compacted in a nitrogen atmosphere under a pressure of about 1 ton/cm2 while being oriented in a magnetic field of 15 kOe. The green compact was then placed in a sintering furnace in an argon atmosphere where it was sintered at 1,060oC for 2 hours, obtaining a magnet block. Using a diamond cutter, the magnet block was machined on all the surfaces to dimensions of 50 mm x 20 mm x 8 mm (thick). It was successively washed with alkaline solution, deionized water, nitric acid, and deionized water, and dried. [0039]<br>
Subsequently, terbium fluoride was mixed with deionized water at a weight fraction of 50% to form a suspension, in which the magnet body was immersed for 1 minute with ultrasonic waves being applied. It is noted that the terbium fluoride powder had an average particle size of 1<br>
µm. The magnet body was pulled up and immediately dried with hot air. At this point, the terbium fluoride surrounded the magnet and occupied a space spaced from the magnet surface at<br>
an average distance of 5 µm at a filling factor of 45% by volume. The magnet body covered with terbium fluoride was subjected to absorption treatment in an argon atmosphere at 800°C for 12 hours. The magnet body was cooled, taken out, immersed in the suspension, and dried, after which it was subjected to absorption treatment under the same conditions. [0040]<br>
It was then subjected to aging treatment at 500"C for one hour, and quenched, obtaining a magnet body within the scope of the invention. This magnet body is designated Ml.<br>
For comparison purposes, magnet bodies were prepared by subjecting the magnet body to only heat treatment, and by effecting the absorption treatment only once. They are designated P1 and Ql (Comparative Examples 1-1 and 1-2).<br>
[0041]<br>
Magnetic properties of magnet bodies Ml, PI and Ql are shown in Table 1. It is evident that the magnet within the scope of the invention has a coercive force increase of 800 kAm-1 relative to the coercive force of magnet P1 not subjected to absorption treatment with terbium fluoride. The magnet Ql subjected to a single absorption treatment has a coercive force increase of 450 kAm-1 relative to magnet P1. It is demonstrated that the repetitive treatment is effective for enhancing coercive force.<br>
[0042]<br>

The resulting alloy consisted of 13.7 atom% Nd, 0.5 atom% Al, 5.9 atom% B, and the balance of Fe. The alloy was exposed to 0.11 MPa of hydrogen gas at room temperature for hydriding and then heated at 500"C for partial dehydriding while evacuating to vacuum. The hydriding pulverization was followed by cooling and sieving, obtaining a coarse powder under 50 mesh. [0043]<br>
Separately, an ingot was prepared by using Nd, Tb, Fe, Co, Al and Cu metals having a purity of at least 99% by weight and ferroboron, high-frequency heating in an argon atmosphere for melting, and casting the alloy melt into a flat mold. The ingot consisted of 20 atom% Nd, 10 atom% Tb, 24 atom% Fe, 6 atom% B, 1 atom% Al, 2 atom% Cu, and the balance of Co. The alloy was ground on a jaw crusher and a Brown mill in a nitrogen atmosphere and sieved, obtaining a coarse powder under 50 mesh.<br>
[0044]<br>
The two powders were mixed in a weight fraction of 90:10. On a jet mill using high-pressure nitrogen gas, the mixed powder was pulverized into a fine powder having a mass median particle diameter of 4.5 µm. The resulting mixed fine powder was compacted in a nitrogen atmosphere under a pressure of about 1 ton/cm2 while being oriented in a magnetic field of 15 kOe.

Using a diamond cutter, the magnet block was machined on all the surfaces to dimensions of 40 mm x 15 mm x 6 mm (thick). It was successively washed with alkaline solution, deionized water, nitric acid, and deionized water, and dried. [0045]<br>
Subsequently, dysprosium fluoride was mixed with deionized water at a weight fraction of 50% to form a suspension, in which the magnet body was immersed for 1 minute with ultrasonic waves being applied. It is noted that the dysprosium fluoride powder had an average particle size<br>
of 2 µm. The magnet body was pulled up and immediately dried with hot air. At this point, the dysprosium fluoride surrounded the magnet and occupied a space spaced from the<br>
magnet surface at an average distance of 7 µm at a filling factor of 50% by volume.

It was then subjected to aging treatment at 500° C for one hour, and quenched, obtaining a magnet body within the scope of the invention. This magnet body is designated M2.<br>
For comparison purposes, magnet bodies were prepared by subjecting the magnet body to only heat treatment, and by<br>
effecting the absorption treatment only once. They are designated P2 and Q2 (Comparative Examples 2-1 and 2-2). [0047]<br>
