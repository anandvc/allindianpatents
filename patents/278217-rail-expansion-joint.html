				<td>TITLE<br>
RAIL EXPANSION JOINT<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) for use in<br>
railway tracks. This invention particularly relates to rail expansion joint otherwise known<br>
as Switch Expansion Joint (SEJ) for use in railway tracks at the end of long welded rails<br>
fitted to the slippers. In this specification, the term Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) and Switch<br>
Expansion Joint (SEJ) are alternatively used for the proper understanding of the invention<br>
by the readers.<br>
REJ is used to take the expansion in a long welded rail and is placed at two ends<br>
thereof. REJ may be connected to long welded rails only on one side or both sides.<br>
Prior art<br>
In the prior art, the rails were joined by fish plates and this resulted in many<br>
disadvantages, some of which are considerable wear and tear, low expansion gap, less<br>
life, low economy and discomfort to the passengers due to jerk and jump of the<br>
locomotive on railway track. The rails are conventionally joined at both ends by either<br>
Flash Butt Welding or Thermit Welding.<br>
In the railway tracks, the middle portion of the long welded rail does not move but<br>
the ends move, i.e. the breathing length moves. This movement is taken up by SEJ.<br>
The expansion of SEJ or REJ depends on temperature variation during the day time<br>
and also through out the year depending upon the season. Even the seasonal variation of<br>
temperature may differ significantly from one place to another and the expansion of joint<br>
must cater for a specific location. India is conventionally divided into four zones having<br>
regard to temperature variation.<br>
Existing SEJ of Indian railways comprises of two rails, namely, a stock rail and a<br>
tongue rail; one sliding against the other. Both these rails are running rails and are of 90<br>
KG per mm UTS minimum. The existing SEJ designed was developed when both the<br>
rails were of 72 KG/mm UTS minimum.<br>
It is well known that the 90 KG/mm UTS minimum is prone to breakage because<br>
of less ductility. Further the design of this type of SEJ is such that the bending of rail is<br>
very sharp. Therefore, the chances or probability of breakages of REJ in track is imminent.<br>
This could result in serious and unwarranted accidents. Therefore, the Indian railways<br>
were looking for an alternative and improved design of SEJ for the safety of the<br>
passengers.<br>
It had been the endeavor of the researchers to design an improved and safe Switch<br>
Expansion Joint (SEJ) for the use of railways. Generally, two different types of SEJ<br>
designs are used in the Indian railways which were developed by concerns other than<br>
Indian railways.<br>
In one of these designs, a stock rail is bolted to a third supporting rail. This stock<br>
rail moves together with a third supporting rail while the tongue rail slides against the third<br>
supporting rail. In this case, there is no bending of any rail.<br>
The second type of known design has a long intermediate rail comprising two rails<br>
bolted together and which in turn is fastened to the slipper by an elastic rail clip. The two<br>
running rails slide at two ends of said long intermediate rail, and in this design also there is<br>
no bending of any rail. In the second type, there are two separate expansion joints<br>
positioned at the two ends of two long welded rails.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based on the use of Austenitic Manganese Steel Chair<br>
with explosion hardening on running surface and this is fixed to 3 or 6 sleepers depending<br>
upon the switch expansion as required. The expansion permitted for 3 sleeper designs will<br>
be 200 mm (maximum) and with 6 sleeper designs, it will be 600 mm.<br>
According to the invention, two running rails will slide on the CMS chair. These<br>
two running rails are not bent but are machined at the ends to provide a gap between them.<br>
The chair is so designed as to allow the wheel to pass through the said gap. The passage<br>
of the wheel at this point or juncture is very smooth as transition slopes are given for<br>
transfer of wheel contact from the rail to the chair. The cast manganese steel chair is so<br>
designed that the wheel may be lifted by 3 mm or more over the running rail. Therefore,<br>
there will not be any impact when the wheel passes from one rail to another. Further, the<br>
two rails are guided by inside steel brackets. This enables the gauge to be maintained<br>
accurately. One or two slippers just before entrance to the REJ will have a lower toe load<br>
to enable the movement of the rails.<br>
In all the existing systems, the bearing plates are individual to the sleepers.<br>
According to the present invention CMS chair is supported on a number of slippers<br>
thereby it transfers the load in a distributed manner. Further, the CMS chair is explosive<br>
depth-hardened on the wheel running surface and the tongue rails are head-hardened in the<br>
wear prone zone.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are listed herein below.<br>
1) The tongue rails are not bent.<br>
2) The tongue rails are head-hardened.<br>
3) Explosive depth-hardened CMC chair is used which gives a very long life.<br>
4) The wheels get lifted by 3 mm or more to avoid impact with rails.<br>
5) Very smooth transfer of wheel from rail to chair and reverse.<br>
6) Very long life of the tongue rail as the CMS chair is hardened and the CMS chair<br>
is positioned at least 3 mm over and above that of tongue rail, thereby the wear<br>
and impact on the tongue rails are controlled further.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved Rail Expansion Joint<br>
(REJ) for use in railway track located at the end of long welded rails, comprising a pair<br>
of identical rails without having any bent, a Cast Manganese Steel (CMS) chair, a mild<br>
steel (MS) bracket, said rails being rested on said CMS chair and said MS bracket<br>
being fastened so that said rails being positioned between said CMS chair head and<br>
MS bracket.<br>
In the above mentioned improved REJ rails, said rails are tongue rails having edges<br>
are so machined as to provide a gap between said tongue rails on the running edge.<br>
Further, said CMS chair is so designed to be located above said tongue rails,<br>
preferably at a height of minimum 3 mm to avoid impact with rails.<br>
In the improved Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) of the present invention, CMS chair is<br>
explosive depth hardened on the running surface and are fixed by a known method.<br>
In the improved Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) of the present invention, said CMS<br>
chair is so profiled that transfer of said wheel from said tongue to said CMS chair<br>
becomes smooth and said wheel can be subsequently raised.<br>
An improved Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) wherein said tongue is hardened by<br>
induction hardening in the wear prone zone.<br>
An improved Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) wherein said CMS chair is made of<br>
austenitic manganese steel. The said CMS chair is mounted on 3 or 6 sleepers as per<br>
the required design; said REJ brackets are fixed to CMS chair with bolts, which are so<br>
positioned that it enables maintenance conveniently.<br>
An improved Rail Expansion Joint (REJ) of the present invention, wherein said<br>
CMS chair is assembled to MS brackets with plate screw, rubber pad, bracket, tongue<br>
rail, nut, taper washer and bolt sleeper.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the drawings<br>
accompanying the provisional specification, wherein -<br>
Fig. 1 shows a known design of SEJ now not normally used.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another conventional design of SEJ with the stock rail being bent at<br>
an angle.<br>
Fig. 3 shows existing SEJ design of Indian Railways.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the new REJ of the present invention for rail section for three<br>
sleepers.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the new REJ of the present invention for six sleepers.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the sectional view of REJ of the drawing shown in Fig. 4 or Fig. 5.<br>
The conventional SEJ as illustrated in Fig. 1 shows a running rail (10), which is cut<br>
at an angle with higher expansion gap than the normal fish plated joint (20). In this<br>
case the outer fishplate (25) is raised to prevent any possibility of derailment.<br>
According to Fig. 2 of the drawings, conventional SEJ with a stock rail (30) is bent<br>
at an angle as shown and the tongue rail (35) is cut to suit the angle of the stock rail.<br>
Both the rails would be supported on bearing plates unlike the earlier design, which<br>
had fish plated joint.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates existing type SEJ design of Indian Railways. Here both the tongue<br>
rail (35) and stock rail (30) are bent at a predetermined point (37 &amp; 39) and machined.<br>
Further both the rails are supported on cast iron bearing plates.<br>
Figs.4 and 5 illustrate the new rail expansion joint, otherwise called REJ of the<br>
present invention for rail sections. The said rail joint essentially comprises the<br>
following items:<br>
(a) Left hand tongue rail (50);<br>
(b) Right hand tongue rail (52);<br>
(c) Brackets (55);<br>
(d) CMS chair (60);<br>
(e) Pre-cast concrete sleeper (65) of known standard design (may be RDSO design);<br>
(f) Rubber pads (70);<br>
(g) Plate screws (85);<br>
(h) Bolts and nuts (90, 92); and<br>
(i) Washers (95, 100)<br>
The left hand tongue rail and the right hand tongue rail are welded to long welded<br>
rails on both sides. Two adjacent sleepers on both sides of the CMS chair are to be<br>
with low toe load fastening. The tongue rail is head-hardened from the end to about<br>
two meters for six sleepers REJ and 1200 mm for three sleepers REJ. Both these<br>
tongue rails slide on the CMS chair. The CMS chair is mounted on three or six<br>
sleepers as per the pre-determined design and requirement. The CMS chair is<br>
explosive head-hardened on the top running surface and is raised over the tongue rail<br>
at the gap to enable smooth running and long life. The transfer of wheel from rail to<br>
CMS chair is smooth because of the gradient on the CMS chair running surface and it<br>
ensures that there is no impact and the wheel is at all times supported adequately by<br>
rail or CMS chair or both. The CMS chair is fixed to the PSC sleeper with plate,<br>
screws and spring washers, and a rubber pad is placed under the CMS chair.<br>
The MS brackets are fixed to the CMS chair with bolts. These MS brackets ensure<br>
that the sliding tongue rail can take place and the gauge is maintained at all times. The<br>
bolts are so positioned that it would enable maintenance at any time quickly.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the arrangement at section A-A and section B-B, as per Fig. 5. Fig. 6<br>
shows the assembly of CMS chair, plate screw, rubber pad, bracket, tongue rail, nut,<br>
taper washer, bolt and sleeper.<br>
According to the present invention it is possible to achieve the following -<br>
1. An improved REJ for use in railway track at the end of long welded rails fitted to<br>
the sleepers. The new REJ can be used for any rail section. The two rails are not<br>
