3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be formed.<br><br><br><br>
Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5- dicarboxylic acid derivatives like lacidipine, isradipine and more particularly for the synthesis of lercanidipine hydrochloride.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Dihydropyridine derivatives are well established for prophylaxis and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. The asymmetrical diesters of l,4-dihydropyridines-3,5-dicarboxylic acid of the general formula I wherein R1,R2,R3 are as defined in the table, were found to be effective as very short-acting, potent and vasoselective antihypertensive agents, useful for intravenous as well as oral administration. Diesters of l,4-dihydropyridines-3,5 dicarboxylic acid of the general formula I are known to be synthesised using Hantzsch synthesis as shown in Scheme-I<br>

Various processes for the synthesis of l,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid derivatives are disclosed in the prior art they are all associated with numerous disadvantages. As the technology evolves, need for an efficient and economical process arises. The present invention provides a simple and efficient process for the synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid derivatives like lacidipine, isradipine and more particularly for the synthesis of lercanidipine hydrochloride.<br>

Lercanidipine Hydrochloride (II) <br>
Lercanidipine Hydrochloride (l,l,N-trimethyl-N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2-aminoethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate) of the formula (II) which is a calcium-channel blocker used for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Lercanidipine slows the movement of calcium through cells, which has two results. It decreases the rate at which the heart beats and also has a widening effect on blood vessels. This combination causes blood pressure to be reduced. Lercanidipine causes fewer vasodilatory adverse effects than other calcium-channel blockers. It is also being promoted for the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in elderly patients.<br>
Lercanidipine was first disclosed in patent US4705797, it describes the synthesis as in Scheme-II wherein the aminoalcohol (1) is esterified with diketene to form the corresponding acetoacetate (2), which is further coupled with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde to give l,l,N-trimethyl-N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2-aminoethyl -a-acetyl 3-nitrocinnamate (3),which is further cyclised with methyl 3-aminocrotonate.<br><br><br><br>
Lercanidipine Hydrochloride<br><br>
Scheme-II<br><br>

The process disclosed in the patent has several disadvantages. It employs use of hazardous<br>
material like diketene. The process leads to several by-products in the final step, which<br>
requires cumbersome purification technique like column chromatography. The process<br>
results in Lercanidipine hydrochloride hemihydrate, which is hygroscopic in nature. The<br>
overall yield of the process is 23%. These disadvantages make the process not suitable for<br>
industrial scale up.<br>
Hence there is a need for an industrially suitable process that avoids the use of the hazardous<br>
reagent also eliminates the need for column purification.<br>

Scheme-Ill <br>
which comprises converting (4) to its acid chloride derivative and further reacting it with (1) in aprotic solvent leading to anhydrous lercanidipine hydrochloride which has low hygroscopicity. The disadvantage of this process is that it employs the use of a monocarboxylic acid (4) as a starting material which is not commercially available and the synthesis of this intermediate is difficult, it is prepared by hydrolysis of its diester which also lead to dicarboxylic acid derivative as an impurity and further purification is required to isolate the intermediate (4).<br>
Solution of these problems associated with prior art becomes the objects of the present invention. Hence, the present invention provides industrially viable and economically feasible process thereby eliminating the all the above-mentioned shortcomings. <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a simple and efficient process for the synthesis of lercanidipine hydrochloride is described in Scheme-A, wherein the compound of formula A<br>
5<br><br>
and compound of formula B are subjected to a simple Michael addition reaction leading to a 1,5 diketo compound of formula C, the reaction conditions employed are mild which results in lesser impurity formation and gives a product with high purity. The resulting diketo compound, which can optionally be isolated, undergoes a simple cyclisation reaction in presence of an ammonia source to give lercanidipine in good yield and high purity. Lercamidipine is isolated as hydrochloride salt by quenching the residue with chilled hydrochloric acid and precipitated from a ketonic solvent; preferably methyl isobutyl ketone.

Lercanidipine Hydrochloride (II) <br>
Lercanidipine Hydrochloride (l,l,N-trimethyl-N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2-aminoethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate) of the formula (II) which is a calcium-channel blocker used for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Lercanidipine slows the movement of calcium through cells, which has two results. It decreases the rate at which the heart beats and also has a widening effect on blood vessels. This combination causes blood pressure to be reduced. Lercanidipine causes fewer vasodilatory adverse effects than other calcium-channel blockers. It is also being promoted for the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in elderly patients.<br>
Lercanidipine was first disclosed in patent US4705797, it describes the synthesis as in Scheme-II wherein the aminoalcohol (1) is esterified with diketene to form the corresponding acetoacetate (2), which is further coupled with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde to give l,l,N-trimethyl-N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2-aminoethyl -a-acetyl 3-nitrocinnamate (3),which is further cyclised with methyl 3-aminocrotonate.<br><br><br><br>

material like diketene. The process leads to several by-products in the final step, which<br>
requires cumbersome purification technique like column chromatography. The process<br>
results in Lercanidipine hydrochloride hemihydrate, which is hygroscopic in nature. The<br>
overall yield of the process is 23%. These disadvantages make the process not suitable for<br>
