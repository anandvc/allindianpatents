				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COATING REMOVAL INSTALLATION AND METHOD OF OPERATING IT<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a coating removal unit and a method<br>
of operating it. Coating removal installations are used for<br>
freeing workpiece supports which are used in coating<br>
installations and are inevitably also coated there from<br>
their coating and for making them suitable for use again and<br>
also for removing the coating from worn or incorrectly<br>
coated workpieces and thus preparing them for recoating.<br>
The prior art<br>
Mechanical methods, especially sand blasting, are<br>
predominantly used today for removing the coating from<br>
workpiece supports. The workpiece supports have to be<br>
dismantled for this purpose. After the treatment, the sand<br>
has to be carefully removed, for example by blowing away.<br>
Nevertheless, frequently residues cannot be avoided, which<br>
may subsequently lead to malfunctions. Moreover, the<br>
workpiece supports are unevenly worn during the sand<br>
blasting and are subject to considerable wear, which<br>
shortens their life.<br>
For removing the coating from worn and incorrectly coated<br>
workpieces, electrochemical methods are also used, cf. for<br>
example, WO 99/54 528 Al. Coating removal installations<br>
according to the precharacterizing clause of Claim 1 are<br>
used for this purpose. Some of these installations have<br>
baskets or rotating drums which can be moved up and down for<br>
receiving the workpieces.<br><br>
In general, however, the workpieces have to be individually<br>
contacted. This is particularly complicated in the removal<br>
of layers of non-conductive material where the contacting is<br>
subject to further limitations and the workpieces have to be<br>
mounted individually on holders.<br>
The formation and positioning of the opposite electrode<br>
surface in known coating removal installations of the<br>
generic type are difficult and cannot always be optimally<br>
realised, since the current flow should be distributed as<br>
uniformly as possible over those surface regions of the<br>
workpieces from which the coating is to be removed, so that<br>
uniform coating removal is achieved and corrosion of the<br>
body bearing the coating is avoided.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the invention further to develop coating<br>
removal installations of the generic type so that the<br>
process of coating removal is substantially simplified and<br>
can be carried out with great reliability. This object is<br>
achieved by the features in the characterizing clause of<br>
Claim 1. In addition, methods for operating a coating<br>
removal installation according to the invention are<br>
described, by means of which coating removal and also, in<br>
addition to the coating removal, more complex processes<br>
comprising further steps can be carried out in a simple<br>
manner.<br>
Advantages of the invention are in particular that removing<br>
the coating from workpiece supports can be effected<br>
substantially more easily and more gently. Since mechanical<br>
processing can be substantially avoided, the life is<br>
substantially longer. After treatment is necessary at most<br><br>
to a small extent (washing, spraying, drying) and requires<br>
scarcely any manual work. In addition, however, removing<br>
the coating from worn and incorrectly coated workpieces is<br>
also substantially simplified and can be effected far more<br>
reliably. By turning the workpiece support, a more or less<br>
uniform current density - averaged over the processing time<br>
- can be achieved more easily. Particularly in the case of<br>
workpieces having a non-conductive coating, the handling is<br>
generally substantially simplified since the workpieces are<br>
contacted in exactly the same way during the coating removal<br>
as in the case of the coating.<br>
Particularly if incorrectly coated workpieces are to be<br>
removed of the coating and recoated, the handling effort can<br>
be substantially reduced if the workpieces are processed by<br>
means according to the invention. For coating removal, they<br>
remain in this case on the workpiece support on which they<br>
were originally coated. Removal and remounting are<br>
dispensed with since the workpiece support with the mounted<br>
and contacted workpieces is transferred from a coating<br>
installation to the coating removal installation according<br>
to the invention and inserted therein. In the case of<br>
recoating of the workpieces, the workpiece support with the<br>
workpieces is transferred in the same way after coating<br>
removal to a coating installation and inserted therein,<br>
whereupon the workpieces are recoated. Direct handling of<br>
the workpieces can be dispensed with.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Below, the invention is explained in more detail with<br>
reference to a figure which shows only an embodiment.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a vertical section through a coating removal<br>
installation according to the invention.<br>
Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
The coating removal installation according to the invention<br>
comprises a cuboid housing 1 which contains a tank 2 which<br>
consists of non-conductive material or is coated on the<br>
inside with a non-conduct ive ma terial so that the inner<br>
surface is non-conductive. It serves for holding a liquid<br>
electrolyte. An overflow 3 with a screen or a filter is<br>
arranged next to the tank 2. At the top, the housing 1 has<br>
an opening 4.<br>
A holder 5 comprises a baseplate 6 by means of which it is<br>
supported on the housing 1 and a coupling 7 which is<br>
rotatably mounted in the baseplate 6. Its axis of rotation<br>
runs vertically and approximately centrally through the tank<br>
2. A drive device 8 which is in the form of an electric<br>
motor has an operative connection to the coupling 7. The<br>
holder 5 likewise comprises a two-pole current supply device<br>
(not shown), one pole of which has an electrically<br>
conductive connection via a current transmission device 9 to<br>
the coupling 7. It may be in the form of a current source,<br>
a voltage source, pulsed current source or pulsed voltage<br>
source or in the form of an alternating current supply. The<br>
holder 5 is connected to the housing 1 so that it can be<br>
removed without great effort, for example simply lifted off.<br>
The current supply device may also be external so that the<br>
coating removal installation has only connections for<br>
connection to said current supply device, one connection of<br>
which is connected to the current transmission device 9.<br>
Moreover, a frame surrounding the axis of rotation is<br>
provided with a plurality of parallel rods 10 which are<br><br>
anchored to the baseplate 6 and on the ends of which a<br>
cross-strut 11 is held.<br>
The other pole of the current supply device or the other<br>
connection is connected to an opposite electrode 12 which,<br>
for example, is in the form of a grid electrode and is<br>
arranged in the interior of the tank 2. The opposite<br>
electrode 12 has an opposite electrode surface facing the<br>
axis of rotation, approximately equidistant from said axis<br>
everywhere and extending substantially over the entire<br>
height of the tank 2. Said opposite electrode surface may<br>
have, for example, the form of a concave cylinder lateral<br>
surface, the axis of which coincides with the axis of<br>
rotation and which extends over a smaller or larger sector<br>
of, for example, 90° to 180°. However, the opposite<br>
electrode may also be in the form of a rod electrode. A<br>
heating and cooling device 13 and an ultrasound generator 14<br>
and an inlet for the electrolyte and devices for moving said<br>
electrolyte, such as pumps or stirrers (not shown), are also<br>
arranged in the tank 2.<br>
During operation, the tank 2 is filled up to at least close<br>
to the upper edge with a liquid electrolyte. A workpiece<br>
support 15 which is in the form of a rotation-symmetric<br>
multilevel support with a central support shaft (in the<br>
following called support tree) in the example, in particular<br>
a central shaft 16 of said workpiece support which lies in<br>
the axis of rotation, is non-rotatably connected to the<br>
coupling 7, to which shaft discs 17 are fastened in<br>
succession at regular intervals, which discs carry<br>
workpieces 18 distributed in each case over their periphery.<br>
There are various possibilities for the formation of the<br>
connection between the coupling 7 and the shaft 16. Rapidly<br>
producible and detachable connections, such as plug<br><br>
connections or bayonet connections, are preferred. The tip<br>
of the shaft 16 is rotatably mounted on the cross-strut 11.<br>
The shaft 16 is connected to the first pole of the current<br>
supply device via the coupling 7 and the discs 17 too are<br>
connected via the shaft. The workpieces 18 are fastened to<br>
the discs 17 and contacted so that they too have an<br>
electrically conductive connection to the first pole of the<br>
current supply device. The workpiece support 15 as well as<br>
all other components of the coating removal installation<br>
which are arranged in the tank 2 must consist of a material<br>
which is not attacked by the electrolyte, usually of<br>
stainless steel or, where this is not possible, as in the<br>
case of some magnetic materials, must be encapsulated in<br>
stainless foil.<br>
The workpiece support may also be formed other than as<br>
described; in principle, it is possible to use any type of<br>
workpiece support which is rotatable about an axis of<br>
rotation and is used in coating installations, in particular<br>
vacuum coating installations, for example support trees with<br>
multiple rotation, it being possible for driver fingers or<br>
workpiece supports of another type having magnetic or plug<br>
plates to be mounted, for example, on the rods 10. The<br>
fastening of the workpieces can be effected in the manner<br>
customary in vacuum coating units, for example by plug or<br>
clamp connections or magnetically.<br>
The current supply device now produces an intermittent or<br>
permanent potential difference between the workpiece support<br>
15 acting as electrode and the workpieces 18 contacted via<br>
said workpiece support on the one hand and the opposite<br>
electrode 12 on the other hand. Where applicable, the<br>
electrode is usually connected as the anode and the opposite<br>
electrode is the cathode. At the same time, the coupling 7<br><br>
is rotated uniformly by the drive device 8, and with it the<br>
workpiece support 15, the rotational speed being adapted to<br>
the process. The workpieces 18 are moved closely past the<br>
opposite electrode surface, preferably at a minimum distance<br>
of between 2 cm and 20 cm, preferably between 3 cm and 8 cm.<br>
The coating removal is now effected as a rule by<br>
electrochemical dissolution of the coating of both the<br>
workpiece support 15 and the workpieces 18. Owing to the<br>
rotation of the workpiece support 15, the current density is<br>
fairly uniform on average as a function of time, i.e. the<br>
current is uniformly distributed over the surfaces from<br>
which the coating is to be removed and the coating removal<br>
is accordingly effected uniformly and in a gentle manner.<br>
This is also assisted by the fact that, in any case<br>
according to a preferred development, all parts of the<br>
opposite electrode surface are about the same distance away<br>
from the axis of rotation and hence from the shaft 16.<br>
It is also possible for the coating to consist of an<br>
adhesive layer deposited directly on the body and a<br>
functional layer deposited on said adhesive layer and for<br>
the coating removal to be effected by dissolution of the<br>
adhesive layer through pores of the functional layer, as<br>
described, for example in WO 99/64 646 Al and<br>
WO 05/073 433 Al. Especially in such cases, the coating<br>
removal process can be substantially accelerated and<br>
improved by the use of the ultrasound generator 14.<br>
Various modes of operation are possible with the coating<br>
removal installation according to the invention. Thus, it<br>
can be used, for example, for removing the coating from a<br>
workpiece support 15 alone, i.e. a workpiece support without<br>
workpieces. Alternatively it can be used for removing the<br>
coating from workpieces incorrectly coated beforehand in a<br><br>
coating installation, in particular a vacuum coating<br>
installation. In this case, for example, the holder 5<br>
together with the workpiece support 15 and workpieces 18 can<br>
be removed from the coating installation and inserted into<br>
the coating removal installation without it being necessary<br>
to carry out any other manipulations on these parts.<br>
The same procedure can be adopted in the case of recoating<br>
after coating removal is complete. In this case, the holder<br>
5 together with the workpiece support 15 and the workpieces<br>
18 can be removed from the housing 1 of the coating removal<br>
installation and transferred to a coating installation, in<br>
particular a vacuum coating installation, and inserted into<br>
the vacuum chamber thereof and, for example, coated by the<br>
CVD or PVD process. In a multi-chamber unit, it is also<br>
&gt; possible, between coating removal and recoating, to carry<br>
out other steps in suitable chambers, such as washing,<br>
spraying and drying, all without having to separate the<br>
workpiece support 15 from the holder 5 or even having to<br>
remove the workpieces 18. Of course, coating removal and<br>
recoating can also be carried out in this manner in<br>
succession after incorrect coating. A suitable transport<br>
device can be provided for moving the holder 5 between the<br>
chambers. In this way, even complex processes comprising a<br>
plurality of processing steps can be substantially<br>
i automated.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to move in each case the<br>
workpiece support 15 alone, equipped with workpieces 18, in<br>
the manner described, it being necessary to mount said<br>
workpiece support on the coupling 7 and corresponding<br>
couplings in the other chambers or to uncouple it from them.<br>
This is somewhat more complex but the requirements which the<br>
transport device has to meet may be lower.<br><br>
Many modifications of the coating removal installation<br>
described are also possible. Thus, a plurality of couplings<br>
for a plurality of workpiece supports can be provided in the<br>
tank. Instead of being arranged above the tank or in its<br>
upper region, the coupling can also be arranged on its<br>
bottom. The tank can be formed in such a way that other<br>
process steps, such as washing, spraying and drying, can<br>
also be carried out in it. For this purpose, pumps and a<br>
collecting volume for temporary removal of the electrolyte<br>
can be provided.<br>
Some examples for possible developments of coating removal<br>
installations according to the invention and methods in<br>
which they are used are given below:<br>
1. Holders for plungers of piston valves which became<br>
coated with a multi-layer coating up to 100 urn thick after<br>
repeated use in coating processes for depositing DLC and<br>
CrN/DLC coatings were loaded, on support trees, on a<br>
plurality of rotatable couplings mounted in the bottom of a<br>
tank. The individual support trees were each fastened to a<br>
coupling electrically conductive in the contact region, the<br>
drivers were positioned against the- satellites in a manner<br>
similar to that in PVD units and the tank was then filled<br>
with a potassium hydroxide-containing electrolyte to which<br>
phosphates and surfactants had been added and which had a pH<br>
of between 11 and 13. With constant revolution, the tree<br>
with double-rotating satellites was removed at room<br>
temperature and a constant + 12 V voltage in the course of 1<br>
h. The electrolyte attack took place in each case through<br>
the pores of the DLC layer to the CrN layer or the thin Cr<br>
layer deposited under the DLC as an adhesive layer.<br><br>
2.	From trees with double-rotating satellites for bucket<br>
tappets which became coated after repeated use with DLC and<br>
CrN/DLC layers the latter were removed similarly to<br>
example 1 with use of the same electrolyte at a constant<br>
200 A current at room temperature in the course of 1 h.<br>
Instead of being driven by driver springs, the double<br>
rotation was effected here by means of toothed wheels and<br>
toothed rings.<br>
3.	Incorrectly coated plungers of piston valves which were<br>
coated with a DLC layer, a WC/C layer deposited on a Cr<br>
adhesive layer or CrN/DLC double layer were loaded onto<br>
satellite discs and trees as for a PVD coating process.<br>
Depending on the size of the control pistons, discs having<br>
different divisions were used. The trees were fastened in<br>
succession in a one-tree device on a coupling mounted in the<br>
bottom of a tank and, after positioning of driver springs,<br>
were immersed in the alkaline electrolyte of example 1.<br>
With constant double satellite rotation and constant 250 A<br>
current, the coatings were removed from the trees at room<br>
temperature in the course of 10 min.<br>
4.	In the device used in example 3, from CrN+DLC-coated<br>
bolts and piston pins loaded onto satellite trees the<br>
coatings were removed in the same electrolyte as in<br>
example 1 at constant 15 V in 5 min.<br>
5.	HSS drills and cutters and other HSS tools which were<br>
coated with different chromium-containing coating systems,<br>
such as Balinit Alcrona (aluminium chromium nitride),<br>
Balinit Helica (aluminium chromium silicon nitride), Balinit<br>
C (Cr+WC/C), Balinit DLC (Cr+DLC) and Balinit D (CrN) were<br>
loaded together onto satellite discs and installed<br>
analogously to example 3 on trees in the tank. After<br><br>
immersion of the tools in the alkaline electrolyte of<br>
example 1, the coatings were removed at room temperature<br>
with constant double rotation at a current of 250 A in the<br>
course of 30 min.<br>
6.	A similar mixture of differently coated tools was<br>
installed as in example 5 and then the coatings removed in<br>
one percent sodium hydroxide solution at a constant 12 V<br>
voltage under otherwise identical conditions in 25 min.<br>
7.	Two HSS hobs coated with Balinit Alcrona were loaded on<br>
to a tree and the latter was immersed in the electrolyte of<br>
example 6. With constant single rotation, the coatings were<br>
removed from them at a constant 12 V voltage in the course<br>
of 20 min.<br><br>
8.	A disc with drills and cutters which were coated with<br>
Balinit Futura-Nano (TiAlN) and Balinit Alcrona (AlCrN) were<br>
loaded on to a tree and inserted upside down into a device<br>
according to Fig. 1 and immersed in the electrolyte of<br>
example 1. With constant single rotation, the surface was<br>
modified by formation of a thin layer of an aluminium oxide<br>
with an oxonitride-containing transition zone to the TiAlN<br>
layer at a constant 6 V voltage in the course of 3 min.<br>
9.	Carbide tools which were coated with different<br>
coatings, such as Balinit Futura (titanium aluminium<br>
nitride), Balinit Xceed (TiAlN having a high aluminium<br>
content), Balinit AlCrona (AlCrN) and Balinit Helica<br>
(aluminium chromium silicon nitride) were loaded together<br>
onto satellite discs and immersed analogously to example 8<br>
on trees in an electrolyte-comprising ammonium nitrate and<br>
acetic acid with a pH of between 1.5 and 3. With constant<br><br>
single rotation, the coatings were removed from the tools at<br>
a voltage of 15 V in the course of 5 min.<br>
10. Trees with coated bolts which, as a result of the<br>
process, were coated with a defective double layer<br>
consisting of CrN+WC/C were removed directly from the PVD<br>
coating unit and the coatings removed in a device<br>
analogously to example 3 and under the same conditions as in<br>
example 3. Thereafter, the trees with the bolts were spray-<br>
cleaned several times in the tank and dried' with warm air.<br>
The trees were then installed directly in the PVD coating<br>
installation for recoating.<br>
In addition to being used for coating removal, the unit<br>
according to the invention can also be used for other<br>
electrochemical processes, for example for modifying<br>
coatings as in example 8 or for polishing or oxidizing<br>
surfaces of workpieces, defined rounding of edges on cutting<br>
tools, etc. Such processes, too, are made uniform through<br>
the rotation of the workpiece support. In addition, they<br>
can be better coordinated with other steps of a complex<br>
process.<br>

and inserted into the coating removal installation.<br>
15.	Method according, to Claim 13 or 14, for removing a<br>
coating from workpieces (18) and recoating said<br>
workpieces, characterized in that, after the coating<br>
removal, the workpiece support (15), loaded with the<br>
workpieces (18), is removed from the coating removal<br>
installation and inserted into a coating installation<br>
and the workpieces (18) are then recoated therein.<br>
16. Method according to Claim 15, characterized in<br>
that the workpiece support (15), loaded with the<br>
workpieces (18), is subjected to at least one<br>
treatment, e.g. washed, sprayed, dried, between the<br><br>
coating removal and the transfer to the coating<br>
installation.<br><br>
Arranged in a removable holder<br>
(5) above a tank (2) filled with an electrolyte is<br>
a coupling (7), which can rotate about a vertical<br>
axis of rotation, for attaching a workpiece carrier<br>
(15) which may, for example, be loaded with<br>
workpieces that have become worn or are not<br>
properly coated. It is connected via the coupling<br>
(7) to a power supply device, at the opposite<br>
terminal of which a counter electrode (12) is<br>
connected. In the tank (2), a heating and cooling<br>
device (13) and an ultrasonic generator (14)<br>
are also arranged. By applying current and<br>
simultaneous rotation, the coating is removed<br>
from the workpiece carrier (15) and/or the<br>
workpieces (18). After improper coating, the<br>
workpieces (18) may be taken over together with<br>
the workpiece carrier (15) and possibly with the<br>
holder (5), directly from a coating installation<br>
and, after removal of the coating, they may be<br>
transferred directly to such an installation for<br>
recoating.</td>
