TITLE<br>
SORBATE/MALEATE COPOLYMER, PREPARATION AND USE AS AN ANTISCALANT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a copolymer for use such as for example an antiscalant in industries.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In industries such as chemical and biochemical industries, reactors and boilers are used to carryout the reaction. Specially, when chemicals like calcium, magnesium, phosphates, silicates and the like are used in a reaction, more often the salts of calcium, phosphates get deposited on the reactors or boilers. It is found to be difficult to remove the deposits from the reactors or boilers during cleaning processes.It is known in the art to use antiscalants to prevent the deposition of salts of calcium, phosphate and the like on the wall of the reactors. Different polymers are used to control different types of scale. Maleate-based polymers, along with phosphonates are used to control calcium carbonate scale. US Patent No. 4,711,725 discloses sulphonate-based polymers to control calcium phosphate, iron and other particulates.US4390670 entitled "Acrylate/maleate copolymers, their preparation and use as antiscalants" discloses substantially homogeneous acrylate/maleate copolymers of number average molecular weight of 500 to 5000 are prepared by copolymerizing 35 to 65 mole percent<br><br>
acrylic or methacrylic acid with 65 to 35 mole percent maleic anhydride at 80° to 150° C. in the presence of a polymerization initiator and a chain-transfer solvent such that both the monomers and the formed polymer remain in solution and the mole ratio of the acrylic or methacrylic acid monomer to the maleic anhydride monomer in the solvent is maintained below about 0.2 throughout the polymerization. The copolymers in hydrolyzed form are employed at  a level of from about 0.1 to 100 ppm for prevention of alkaline calcium and magnesium scale formation, such as during seawater evaporative desalination. However, this polymer is much suitable as an antiscalant for water treatment processes and other related processes only. Moreover, this polymer contains around 35 to 65 mole percent of acrylic acid and hence may not be suitable for use in food industries.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an antiscalant that can be widely used in all the industries and has good antiscalant properties.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a copolymer with better antiscalant properties suitable for various industries. It is also another object of the present invention to provide copolymers with antiscalant properties for food industries.<br>

Sorbate maleate copolymer according to present invention is prepared as below:<br>
To a round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and a mechanical stirrer were charged sorbic acid, maleic anhydride, methyl ethyl ketone, and benzoyl peroxide. The reaction mixture was agitated to ensure proper mixing of the raw materials. The flask was purged with dry nitrogen while the resulting solution was heated under agitation to reflux the system being maintained thereafter under a static nitrogen pressure. The polymerization solution was refluxed for 16 hours and methyl ethyl ketone was distilled out. The reaction mixture was cooled till room temperature when a solid mass separated. The solid mass was filtered out and washed with of methyl ethyl ketone and dried at 80. degree. C for 2 hours. The resulting copolymer was neutralized using sodium hydroxide to make an aqueous solution.<br>

Therefore, the copolymer is best suitable for aqueous systems in various industries which involve the use chemicals that form scales on reactors, boilers etc.Further, the sorbate-maleate copolymer is also suitable for food industries such as sugar industries as sorbic acid and maleic acid are of food grade. Even with the addition of a further monocarboxylic acid such as acrylic acid, the quantity of acrylic acid is only 0 to 40 mole percent and is still suitable for food industries. Further, sorbic acid is a by-product of sugar industry, and the polymer may be produced in the sugar industry at a very low cost of production.Further, the copolymer may also be used as a dispersant in paints and as a water reducing agent in cement and clay industries.<br>
The invention will be further clarified by use of the following example, which are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
To a 4-neck, 500 ml round flask equipped with a reflux condenser, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and a mechanical stirrer, 33.6g sorbic acid, 29.4g maleic anhydride, 147.Og methyl ethyl ketone, 0.063g benzoyl peroxide were added. The reaction mixture was agitated to ensure proper mixing of the raw materials. The flask was purged with dry nitrogen while the resulting solution was heated under agitation to reflux (about 85. degree. C), the system being maintained thereafter under a static nitrogen pressure. The polymerization solution was refluxed for 16 hours and 90.Og of methyl ethyl ketone was distilled out. The reaction mixture was cooled till room temperature (about 27.<br><br>
degree. C.) when a solid mass separated. The solid mass was filtered out and washed with 50.Og of methyl ethyl ketone and dried at 80. degree. C for 2 hours. The resulting copolymer was neutralized using 36.Og sodium hydroxide to make an aqueous solution.<br>
The sequestration value of the polymer was found by the following method<br>
Test method for determination of sequestration value.<br>
Sequestration.<br>
0.5 N Calcium acetate solution was prepared and standardized . Accurately 2.0 ±0.1 g of the sample was weighed in a weighing bottle and transferred it quantitatively into a 250 ml beaker with the help of DM water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.0 with dropwise addition of 1N NaOH. To this solution 10 ml of 2% Na2C03 solution was added and pH was adjusted to 11.0 using 1N NaOH. The volume of the solution was adjusted to 150 ml with DM water and titrated with 0.5N Calcium acetate solution. 1 ml of titrant was added at a time on continuous stirring till the precipitate dissolves. Smaller increments of titrant was added towards the end point. The pH of the solution was kept constant at 11.0 throughout the titration. Appearance of a permanent faint turbidity as viewed against a black background indicated the endpoint. The sequestration value , expressed as the milligrams of CaCO3 per gram of sample was calculated using the formula:Sequestration value = 50 X R X N / W Where, R = volume of Ca acetate solution consumed in ml<br><br>
N =normality of Ca acetate solution as determined by titration with EDTA, and W = weight of the sample in grams.<br>
Threshold inhibition of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate<br>
This test was performed by mixing solutions of sodium carbonate or sodium sulfate with enough calcium chloride to yield a supersaturated solution. The inhibition effectiveness was measured by calcium analysis of the inhibited, or treated, solution and the uninhibited, or untreated solution. More calcium was present in the inhibited solution because calcium precipitation was reduced.<br>
CALCIUM CARBONATE TEST<br>
In order of mixing to a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask, 490 ml distilled water (minus inhibitor solution volume), 5 ml 0.1 M sodium carbonate solution, 0.1% of inhibitor (sorbate maleate copolymer) solution (usually 0.5 to 2.5 ppm inhibitor on 500 ml volume), 5 ml 0.1 M calcium chloride solution were added. The flask was stoppered loosely and stored at 66. degree C. in an oven for 24 hours. After ageing 24 hours at 66. degree C, 50 ml of the clear supernatant liquid was pipetted into the flask, taking care not to get any of the floating calcium scale into the sample. Then 2ml of 1 N caustic, three drops of Murexide (Ammonium purpurate) indicator solution was added , and titrated with standard EDTA from pink to blue. Two blanks were prepared without inhibitor and one blank was titrated immediately and produced about 100 ppm CaCO3 before precipitation occurred. The other blank was stored  at 66 degree C for 24 hours and produced<br><br>
about 24 ppm CaC03. The inhibited samples produced an intermediate level of carbonate.<br>
The inhibition efficiency was calculated as described below:<br>
ppm CaC03 = (ml EDTA ,0.01 N) (1000) / sample weight = (ml EDTA , 0.01 N) (20)<br>
Inhibitor efficiency, % = ppm, inhibited - ppm, precipitated blank<br>
ppm, unprecipitated blank - ppm, precipitated blank<br>
All the samples were run in duplicate and titration agreed with 0.1 ml.<br>
CALCIUM SULFATE TEST.<br>
To a 500 ml Erienmeyer flask, 450 ml distilled water (minus inhibitor solution volume), 25 ml 1M sodium sulfate solution, 0.1% inhibitor sorbate maleate copolymer solution (usually 2 to 25 ppm inhibitor on 500 ml volume), 25 ml 1M calcium chloride solution were added and stoppered loosely and stored at 66. degree C in a oven for 24 hours. After ageing 24 hours at 66. degree C, 2 ml of the clear supernatant liquid was pipetted out into 50ml distilled water in a flask, taking care not to get any of the floating scale into the sample. To the solution, 2ml of 1 N caustic, three drops of Murexide (Ammonium purpurate) indicator solution was added and titrated with standard EDTA (0.01 N) solution from salmon to red.<br>
Two blanks were prepared without inhibitor and one blank was titrated immediately and produced about 6800 ppm calcium sulfate before precipitation occurs. The other blank was stored at 66. degree C for<br><br>
24 hours and produced about 2800 ppm calcium sulfate. The inhibited samples produced an intermediate level of sulfate.<br>
The inhibitor efficiency was then calculated as described below:<br>
ppm CaS04   = (ml EDTA , 0.01 N) (1360) / Sample weight   = (ml EDTA, 0.01 N) (680)<br>
Inhibitor efficiency, % = ppm, inhibited - ppm, precipitated blank<br>
ppm, unprecipitated blank - ppm, precipitated blank<br>
All the samples were run in duplicate and titration agreed with 0.1 ml.<br>
