CONTROLLED RELEASE ORAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This international application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
11/135,153, filed May 23, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD<br>
The present invention is generally directed to oral delivery systems including an encapsulated active ingredient. In particular, the invention relates to an oral delivery system in which at least one active component is encapsulated in a polymer matrix. In some embodiments, the polymer matrix may have a tensile strength within a desirable range and/or may include at least one hydrophobic polymer to provide controlled release of the active.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Unblemished white teeth have long been considered cosmetically desirable. Unfortunately, in the absence of thorough dental cleaning, teeth can become discolored or stained from color-causing substances present in food, beverages, tobacco, and the like, and internal sources such as blood, amalgam-based fillings, and antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline).<br>
Currently, there are a number of methods for removing stains in teeth. These methods are generally based on the use of abrasives, hydrolytic agents or oxidizing agents to break down the staining material. For example, mechanical methods of tooth cleaning are known whereby the stain is mechanically abraded through the use of abrasives or polishing agents normally employed in toothpaste preparations. Typical preparations containing abrasives are toothpastes, gels or powder dentifrices, which require close contact with the teeth. Typical abrasives include hydrated silica, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and alumina.<br>
Hydrolytic agents, such as proteolytic enzymes, can also be used to whiten teeth. These products are usually in the form of pastes or gels, and function to whiten teeth by removing the plaque and calculus that have entrapped the stain.<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
Oxidizing agents such as urea peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or calcium peroxide, represent the most common forms of whitening agents for tooth enamels. It is believed that peroxides whiten teeth by releasing hydroxyl radicals capable of breaking down the plaque/stain complex into a form that can be flushed away or removed by an abrasive.<br>
Other active stain-removing components include surface-active agents, such as anionic surfactants and chelators, which have been incorporated into stain-removing compositions because of their stain-removing properties. For example, anionic surfactants typically employed in dentifrice compositions include sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium N-lauryl sarcosinate. Furthermore, chelators, such as polyphosphates, are typically employed in dentifrice compositions as tartar control ingredients. For example, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and sodium tri-polyphosphate are typical ingredients found in such compositions.<br>
Stain-removing gum compositions are known. For example, gum compositions including sodium tripolyphosphate and xylitol are known. Also, gum compositions are known, which include hexametaphosphate and an abrasive silica material. Moreover, a dental gum is known, which includes sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, a silica abrasive and zinc acetate. A whitening gum composition is also known, which includes the abrasives sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, and is sold under the brand name V6®.<br>
Moreover, stain-removing gum compositions are known that include anionic surfactants such as fatty acid salts. For example, sodium stearate is a fatty acid salt employed in a gum product sold under the brand name Trident White® {see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,471,945, 6,479,071 and 6,696,044). Furthermore, copending, commonly-owned U.S. Patent Application No. 10/901,511 discloses stain-removing gum compositions containing a salt of ricinoleic acid.<br>
Current delivery systems for oral care/tooth whitening actives present problems. For example, the release of actives from tablets, films, mouthwashes, toothpastes and gels is quite rapid and occurs for a short period of time. Most of these products produce temporary, elevated levels of actives, followed by a rapid decrease to zero levels. Similarly, some tooth<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
whitening actives can be released at elevated levels from gum bases within a few minutes following mastication, followed by a rapid decrease to low levels.<br>
Encapsulating materials have been used previously to encapsulate sweeteners, acids, flavorings, soluble dietary fibers, biologically active agents, breath freshening agents, and the like. Such encapsulating materials have included, for example, cellulose and its derivatives, arabinogalactin, gum arabic, polyolefins, waxes, vinyl polymers, gelatin and zein. In general, encapsulating actives in edible compositions has been used to slow their degradation, to enhance the uniformity of their release, and to prolong their release in a controlled manner.<br>
The selection of a suitable encapsulating material (e.g., polyvinyl acetate, PVAc) has usually been focused on the molecular weight of the encapsulating material, with higher molecular weights generally associated with longer release times. However, this approach is limited in that a predictable modification of the release profile of an active is made only through the modification of the molecular weight of the encapsulating material.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it would be beneficial to provide oral delivery systems wherein a controlled amount of an oral care active is delivered to an oral cavity over a longer period of time, rather than delivering a high concentration of the active followed by no active. In particular, it would be advantageous to encapsulate at least one oral care active in a suitable polymer matrix to enhance the uniformity of its release, and to prolong its release in a controlled manner. In some embodiments, the release profile of the active may be modified by selection of a polymer matrix having a tensile strength within a desirable range and/or may be modified by including in the matrix a polymer having a water absorption within a desirable range.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to oral delivery systems in which an active component has been effectively encapsulated in a polymer matrix. The oral delivery systems are for use in edible compositions. The polymer matrix prolongs the release of the active in a controlled manner and/or enhances the uniformity of the release of the active. In so doing, the active remains available for its intended purpose in the oral cavity for a longer period of time<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
as compared to an edible composition wherein the active component is free. This will be discussed in greater detail below.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an oral delivery system including at least one active component; and a polymer matrix at least partially encapsulating the at least one active component. The polymer matrix may have a tensile strength of at least about 6,500 psi and/or may include at least one polymer having a water absorption of about 0.01% to about 50% by weight.<br>

The delivery system for use in the gum composition includes at least one active component; and a polymer matrix at least partially encapsulating the at least one active component. The polymer matrix may have a tensile strength of at least about 6,500 psi and/or may include at least one polymer having a water absorption of about 0.01% to about 50% by weight.<br>
Other aspects of the present invention relate to methods of preparing and using the inventive oral delivery compositions provided herein.<br>
In some embodiments, a method of preparing an oral delivery system includes at least partially encapsulating the least one active component in a polymer matrix, thereby forming an oral delivery system. The polymer matrix may have a tensile strength of at least about 6,500 psi and/or may include at least one polymer having a water absorption of about 0.0.1% to about 50% by weight.<br>

DETAILED WRITTEN DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides a delivery system for active components. The delivery system is for use in edible compositions, such as gum compositions. The delivery system includes an encapsulating material and at least one active component. The<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
encapsulating material at least partially forms a physical barrier around the at least one active. This physical barrier prolongs the release of the active in an oral cavity in a controlled manner and/or enhances the uniformity of the release of the active in an oral cavity. In so doing, the active remains available for its intended purpose in the oral cavity for a longer period of time as compared to an edible composition wherein the active component is free.<br>
As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which is synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its use in the preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
As used herein, the term "gum compositions" is intended to include any gum compositions, including "chewing gum" and "bubble gum."<br>
As used herein, the term "active component" refers to any encapsulated material included in the compositions of the present invention, wherein the active provides some desirable property upon release from encapsulation (for example, when the encapsulated material has been subjected to mastication). Examples of suitable actives include oral care actives, such as surfactants, anticalculus agents, hydrolytic agents (e.g., enzymes), bleaching or whitening agents, antibacterial agents, anticaries agents, dental remineralization agents, desensitizing agents, agents to counter breath odor or breath freshening agents, plaque acid buffering agents and sweeteners (e.g., high intensity sweeteners). Other examples of suitable actives include flavors, medicaments, vitamins, taste masking agents, etc.<br>
The term "oral delivery system" as used herein is meant to encompass the polymer matrix and at least one active component, which is at least partially encapsulated by the polymer matrix. The term is also meant to include other additives, which may be used to form the oral delivery system (e.g., a solvent, a plasticizer, a filler, etc.). It will be understood that oral compositions (e.g., edible compositions) of the present invention may include a plurality of delivery systems, if desired.<br>
By the term "at least partially encapsulating", it is meant that the polymer matrix at least partially forms a physical barrier around the at least one active component. Such a barrier may be formed, for example, when a polymer melt and at least one active are mixed<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
under high shear conditions using an extruder, or other high shear mixer. The barrier may also be formed as a polymer coating (e.g., spray coating), or a polymer film, which at least partially surrounds the at least one active, for example.<br>
The oral delivery systems of the present invention are for use in edible compositions. The compositions of the present invention may be in a form selected from, for example, dentifrices including mouthwashes, mouthrinses, toothpastes, tooth powders, tooth hardeners, antiplaque compositions, dental creams, dental flosses, liquids, gels, and the like; chewing gums, including center-filled gums, and the like; and confectionaries, including mints, lozenges, and the like. In some embodiments, the compositions of the present invention are in the form of chewing gums.<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to compositions with stain-removing properties for producing a whitening effect on dental surfaces that are treated with the same. Such compositions are especially suitable for removing stains, which adhere to, or are entrapped in materials on, the surface of teeth and for preventing build-up of the stain entrapping material and stains on dental surfaces. The compositions of the present invention are retained in the oral cavity for a sufficient time to contact the dental surfaces for purposes of providing beneficial dental effects.<br>
An ingredient in an edible composition will have a release profile when a consumer consumes the edible composition. In some embodiments, the ingredient may be released by mechanical action of the chewing, and/or by chemical action or reaction of the ingredient with another ingredient or saliva or other material in the consumer's mouth. The release profile for the ingredient is indicative of the availability of the ingredient in the consumer's mouth to interact with receptors (e.g., taste receptors), mucous membranes, teeth, etc. in the consumer's mouth. An edible composition may include the same or different release profiles for different ingredients. In some embodiments, the release profile for only a finite number (e.g., one or two) of ingredients may be of primary importance.<br>
The release profile of an ingredient in an edible composition can be influenced by many factors such as, for example, rate of chewing, intensity of chewing, the amount of the ingredient, form of the ingredient added to the edible composition (e.g., encapsulated in a delivery system, unencapsulated, pretreated), how the edible composition is mixed or<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
otherwise prepared, when or how the ingredient is added to other ingredients in the edible composition, the ratio of the amount of the ingredient to the amount of one or more other ingredients in the edible composition, the ratio of the amount of the ingredient to the amount of one or more other ingredients in a delivery system that is included in the edible composition, etc.<br>
In some embodiments, a release profile for an ingredient may be related to a specific time period. For example, release of an ingredient from a delivery system may increase during a first time period, reach a peak, and then decrease during a second time period. Thus, in some embodiments, a release profile for an ingredient may include one or more time periods, each of which has an associated release rate (which may or may not be known or measurable). The time periods may be the same length of time or may be different lengths of time. A first time period may have a fixed or varied release rate for the ingredient during the first time period and an average release rate for the ingredient over the first time period. Similarly, a second time period may have a fixed or varied release rate for the ingredient during the second time period and an average release rate for the ingredient over the second time period. In some embodiments, a release profile for an ingredient in an edible composition may include only one time period or be related to only a single point in time, both of which typically relate or are relative to when consumption of the edible composition has started. In other embodiments, a release profile may relate to two or more time periods and/or two or more points in time, all of which typically relate or are relative to when consumption of the edible product has started.<br>
In some embodiments, a release profile may be defined or characterized by one or more factors or characteristics, even if other or all aspects of the release profile are not determined, selected, or even known. Thus, in some embodiments, a release profile for an ingredient may include only one characteristic. For example, characteristics may include one or more of the following: release rate of an ingredient during a time period, a specific time period during which a minimum, average, or predominant amount of an ingredient is released during consumption of an edible composition that includes the ingredient (even if some of the ingredient is released before or after the specific time period and even if the release rate during the time period is not specified or varies), a specific time after which a minimum, average, or predominant amount of an ingredient is released during consumption of an edible<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
composition that includes the ingredient (even if some of the ingredient is released before the specific time and even if the release rates are or are not specified), etc.<br>
In some embodiments, managing a release profile for one or more ingredients may include changing or otherwise managing the starting and ending times for the time periods, changing or otherwise managing the lengths of the time periods, and/or changing or otherwise managing the release rates during the time periods. For example, managing a release profile may include changing or managing a release rate during a time period. An ingredient can be released more quickly or earlier during a first or second time period by increasing its release rate during these time periods. Likewise, the ingredient can be released more slowly or in a more delayed manner during the first or second time periods by decreasing its release rate during these time periods. As another example, managing a release profile may include shifting the start and end of the time periods in the release profile, but the length of the time periods may stay the same and the release rates of the ingredient(s) during the time periods may stay the same (e.g., the release of an ingredient may be managed to delay the release of the predominant amount of the ingredient by one minute, five minutes, ten minutes, thirty minutes, etc.). As a third example, managing a release profile may include shifting the start or end of one or more time periods and changing the release rate within the one or more time periods.<br>
In some embodiments, causing a delay in a release of an ingredient in an edible composition includes causing a delay in the release or availability of the predominant amount of the ingredient after consumption of the edible product begins and/or causing release or availability of a desire, predominant, or minimum amount of the ingredient at a certain time, after a certain time, or during a desired time period after consumption of the edible composition begins. In some embodiments, none of the ingredient will be released or become available before the certain time or before or after the desired time period. In other embodiments, some of the ingredient may be released or become available before the certain time and/or before or after the desired time period.<br>
In some embodiments, determining or selecting a desired release profile may include determining or selecting one or more factors or characteristics of the desired release profile, as previously described above. The factors or characteristics than serve to define or characterize the release profile, even if other or all aspects of the release profile are not<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
determined or selected. Thus, determining or selecting a release profile for an ingredient can includes situations where only one characteristic for the release of the ingredient is determined or selected. In some embodiments, a characteristic may be determined or measured by one or more techniques or methods such as, for example, chemical and/or mechanical testing and analysis, consumer testing, descriptive or expert taste or chew panel, other in vivo or in vitro testing, etc.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an oral care active may be employed in the compositions of the present invention. Such an active may be, but is not limited to, a tooth whitening active. For example, the encapsulated tooth whitening active may be one or more of the following: anticalculus agents, such as polyphosphate salts, surfactants, such as fatty acid salts, hydrolytic agents, such as proteolytic enzymes, and oxidizing agents, such as peroxides. Such agents facilitate die effective removal of dental stains. Other oral care actives include, for example, desensitizing agents, dental remineralization agents, antibacterial agents, anticaries agents, agents to counter breath odor or breath freshening agents and plaque acid buffering agents.<br>
As described above, the release of non-encapsulated oral care actives from tablets, films, mouthwashes, toothpastes and gels is quite rapid and occurs for a short period of time. Most of these products produce temporary, elevated levels of actives, followed by a rapid decrease to zero levels. Similarly, some tooth whitening actives can be released at elevated levels from gum bases within a few minutes following mastication, followed by a rapid decrease to low levels. The present invention is directed to overcoming this problem by encapsulating the active(s) in a suitable polymer matrix.<br>
For example, by encapsulating the active within a suitable polymer matrix, the present inventors have found that they can enhance the uniformity of an active's release, and prolong the active's release in a controlled manner. In some embodiments, the release profile of the active may be modified by selection of a polymer matrix having a tensile strength within a desirable range and/or may be modified by including in the matrix a polymer having a water absorption within a desirable range.<br>
In some embodiments, a polymer matrix useful in the present invention has a tensile strength of at least about 6,500 psi. In some embodiments, the polymer matrix has a tensile<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
strength of about 20,000 to about 50,000 psi. The tensile strength may be measured by ASTMD638.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymer matrix includes at least one polymer having a water absorption of about 0.01% to about 50% by weight. In some embodiments, the water absorption of the at least one polymer is measurable by ASTM D570-98. In some embodiments, the at least one polymer has a water absorption of about 0.1% to about 15% by weight.<br>
The at least one polymer of the polymer matrix provides a physical barrier around the at least one active component. In some embodiments, the polymer may be selected from at least one of the following: polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, polymethylmethacrylate, polyethylene terephthalate and combinations thereof. The polymer matrix may further include a solvent, a plasticizer, a filler or a combination of these.<br>
In some embodiments, the delivery system, when used in an oral composition, releases a controlled amount of the active component in an oral cavity over a longer period of time as compared to an oral composition wherein the active component is free. In one embodiment, this period of time is about 5 to about 60 minutes.<br>
The present inventors have found that, when employed in a chewing gum composition, an oral delivery system of the present invention was useful for controlling and sustaining the release of actives in the oral cavity.<br>
In some embodiments, at least about 50% of the active component remains in the oral composition after the time period of about 5 to about 60 minutes. For example, as shown in the Examples below, in vitro chew-out studies showed that chewing gum containing an inventive oral delivery system delayed the release of tooth whitening actives significantly during at least 30 minutes of chewing time as compared to a chewing gum containing free actives. This is significant because tooth whitening actives, if not released quickly, are not efficacious.<br>
As described above, the oral delivery systems of the present invention include at least one active component. In some embodiments the at least one active component is selected<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
from the following: anticalculus agents, abrasive agents, oral cleaning agents, bleaching or whitening agents, densensitizing agents, dental remineralization agents, surfactants, antibacterial agents, anticaries agents, agents to counter breath odor or breath freshening agents, plaque acid buffering agents, sweetening agents, cooling agents, warming agents, herbal agents, medicaments, vitamins, taste masking agents and combinations thereof.<br>
In one desired embodiment, the at least one active component is an anticalculus agent and a taste masking agent. Examples of anticalculus agents include polyphosphates and sodium bicarbonate. Such anticalculus agents may be bitter in taste. Therefore, in some desired embodiments, the anticalculus agent (or any other unpleasant tasting active) may be encapsulated along with at least one taste masking agent. In some embodiments, the taste masking agent is a sweetener, such as an intense sweetener.<br>
As described above, a suitable active for encapsulation may be a tooth whitening active. A tooth whitening active is preferably employed in the compositions of the present invention in a stain-removing effective amount. The stain-removing effective amount is an amount of the tooth whitening active that is sufficient to prevent, eliminate, or at least reduce, the presence of stains on dental surfaces in warm-blooded animals including humans, but low enough to avoid any undesirable side effects. This stain-removing effective amount of a tooth whitening active(s) may vary with the type and extent of the particular stain, the age and physical condition of the warm-blooded animal, including humans being treated, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, the specific tooth whitening active employed, and the particular carrier from which the tooth whitening active is applied.<br>
The concentration of a tooth whitening active(s) in a composition of the present invention depends on the type of composition (e.g., toothpaste, mouthwash and rinse, lozenge, chewing gum, confectionary, and the Like) used to apply the tooth whitening active(s) to the dental surfaces, due to the differences in the efficiency of the compositions contacting the teeth and due also to the effective amount of the composition generally used. The concentration may also depend on the levels of the stains present.<br>
Except as otherwise noted, the amount of the components incorporated into the compositions according to the present invention is designated as percentage by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>

WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
As described above, an oral composition of the present invention can be a gum composition, such as chewing gum composition. The chewing gum compositions of the present invention may be coated or uncoated, and be in the form of slabs, sticks, pellets, balls and the like. The composition of the different forms of the chewing gum compositions will be similar but may vary with regard to the ratio of the components. For example, coated gum compositions may contain a lower percentage of softeners. Pellets and balls may have a chewing gum core, which has been coated with either a sugar solution or a sugarless solution to create the hard shell. Slabs and sticks are usually formulated to be softer in texture than the chewing gum core.<br>
Center-filled gum is another common gum form. The gum portion has a similar composition and mode of manufacture to that described above. However, the center-fill is typically an aqueous liquid or gel, which is injected into the center of the gum during processing. A suitable encapsulated active(s) could optionally be incorporated into the center-fill during manufacture of the fill, incorporated directly into the chewing gum portion of the total gum composition, or both. The center-filled gum may also be optionally coated and may be prepared in various forms, such as in the form of a lollipop.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, a coated gum may be formed, wherein the encapsulated active(s) is in at least one of the core or the gum coating. For example, an encapsulated abrasive agent may be incorporated into the coating, and encapsulated surface actives (e.g., surfactant and/or anticalculus agent) may be incorporated into the gum base. By providing an encapsulated abrasive in the coating, the stain is first mechanically abraded by the abrasive in combination with chewing, which requires close contact with the teeth. Whereas the abrasive continues to have a chemical effect in removing the stain after it is released from the coating into the saliva, it may be advantageous to enhance the mechanical abrasion initially by providing it in the coating layer. Furthermore, the coating provides another effective vehicle for delivering an encapsulated surface-active.<br>
It is also well within the contemplation of the present invention that encapsulated active(s) can be incorporated into the gum base. The gum base provides another effective vehicle for delivering the active(s), such as abrasives and surface- active agents because it permits protracted contact of the active(s) with the teeth. For example, a tooth whitening<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
agent(s) can chemically remove the stain once released from the gum base and/or gum coating into saliva. The oral delivery systems of the present invention, when employed in tooth whitening gums or other oral care compositions, permit controlled and sustained release of the active(s) in the oral cavity. This improves the efficacy of the active.<br>
Chewing gum compositions of the present invention may include a gum base and most of the other typical chewing composition components, such as sweeteners, softeners, flavorants and the like. At least one encapsulated oral care active, such as a tooth whitening active, is employed in some embodiments of the gum compositions.<br>
Surfactants<br>
The oral compositions of the present invention may include encapsulated tooth whitening agent(s) as provided herein. For example, in some embodiments the at least one active component employed in the oral delivery system is a surfactant. Suitable surfactants may include anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants or mixtures thereof. Anionic surfactants useful herein include medium and long chain fatty acid esters and salts. In some embodiments, the anionic surfactant is a water-soluble salt of a fatty acid having from 14 to 25 carbon atoms. The salt may include a metal ion that can be a divalent metal ion or a monovalent metal ion. For example, the metal ion can be selected from sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable examples of fatty acid salts include salts of stearate and palmitrate. Other examples include hydroxy fatty acid salts, such as salts of ricinoleic acid, castor oil and ergot oil. In some embodiments, the fatty acid salt is sodium stearate or sodium ricinoleate.<br>
Ricinoleic acid accounts for about 90% of the triglyceride fatty acids of castor oil, and up to about 40% of the glyceride fatty acids of ergot oil. Other suitable hydroxy fatty acid salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following: lesquerolic acid, densipolic acid, auricolic acid and P-dimorphecolic acid. Combinations of hydroxy fatty acid salts may also be employed.<br>
The water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids may be derived from naturally occurring fatty acids having at least one hydroxyl functionality, such as ricinoleic acid. Furthermore, the surfactants employed in the present invention or the fatty acids from which<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
they are derived may be chemically or enzymatically modified so as to contain at least one hydroxyl functionality.<br>
The fatty acid salts may be derived from fatty acids found, for example, in animals, plants or bacteria. The polar -COOH group on short-chain fatty acids (e.g., 2-4 carbon atoms) and even medium-chain (e.g., 6 to 10 carbon atoms) is typically enough to make them soluble in water. However, as chain length increases (e.g., from 14 to 25 carbons), the fatty acid type becomes progressively less water soluble and tends to take on oily or fatty characteristics. The presence of a hydroxy group on long-chain fatty acids increases water solubility. Therefore, water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids having from 14 to 25 carbon atoms are useful in the compositions of the present invention. In particular, the water solubility of a hydroxy fatty acid salt allows it to solubilize an established stain into the saliva and loosens it so that it can be easily removed by chewing, brushing or saliva.<br>
In some embodiments, the inventive oral compositions can include other anionic or nonionic surfactants. For example, other suitable surfactants may include the following anionic or non-ionic surfactants: sulfated butyl oleate, sodium oleate, salts of fumaric acid, potassium glomate, organic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, stearyl monoglyceridyl citrate, succistearin, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, glycerol tristearate, lecithin, hydroxylated lecithin, sodium lauryl sulfate, acetylated monoglycerides, succinylated monoglycerides, monoglyceride citrate, ethoxylated mono- and diglycerides, sorbitan monostearate, calcium stearyl-2-lactylate, sodium stearyl lactylate, lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycerol, glycerol-lactoesters of C8-C24 fatty acids, polyglycerol esters of C8-C24 fatty acids, propylene glycol alginate, sucrose C8-C24 fatty acid esters, diacetyl tartaric and citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, triacetin, sarcosinate surfactants, isethionate surfactants, tautate surfactants, pluronics, polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, products derived from the condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction product of propylene oxide and ethylene diamine, ethylene oxide condensates of aliphatic alcohols, long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides, long chain dialkyl sulfoxides and mixtures thereof.<br>

the anticalculus agent is present in amounts of about 0.5 to about 3% by weight of the oral composition.<br>
Taste Masking Agents<br>
In some embodiments, the encapsulated active is a taste masking agent. It may be useful to include a taste masking agent in oral compositions, which include unpleasant tasting compounds, such as bitter and/or metal tasting compounds.

Bleaching or Whitening Agents<br>
The oral compositions of the present invention may include encapsulated bleaching or whitening agents. Suitable bleaching or whitening agents include peroxide compounds. Peroxides are believed to whiten teeth by releasing hydroxyl radicals capable of breaking down the plaque-stain complex into a form that can be flushed away or removed by abrasives. Useful peroxides should contain an 0-0 bond, which can break down to provide at least one active specie. Examples of preferred peroxide compounds are inorganic peroxides,<br>

Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum product. In general, the elastomer will be present in the gum base in an amount from about<br>

10% to about 60% by weight of the gum region, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by weight.<br>
When a wax is present in the gum base, it softens the polymeric elastomer mixture and improves the elasticity of the gum base. The waxes employed will have a melting point below about 60°C, and preferably between about 45°C. and about 55°C. The low melting wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in the gum base in an amount from about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to about 9.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>

The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these components, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof.

Plasticizers also include are the hydrogenated vegetable oils and include soybean oil and cottonseed oil which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers provide the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more specifically in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
Although softeners may be present to modify the texture of the gum composition, they may be present in reduced amounts as compared to typical gum compositions. For example, they may be present from about 0.5 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, or they may not be present in the composition, since a surfactant active can act as a softener.<br>
The gum base of this invention may also include effective amounts of bulking agents such as mineral adjuvants, which may serve as fillers and textural agents. Useful mineral adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate and the like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may be used in the gum base compositions in various amounts. Preferably the amount of filler, when used, will be present in an amount from about 15% to about 40%, and desirably from about 20% to about 30%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
A variety of traditional additives may be optionally included in the gum base in effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and the like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and mixtures thereof, may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives known to one having ordinary skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base.<br>
Some embodiments extend to methods of making the gum compositions. The manner in which the gum base components are mixed is not critical and is performed using standard techniques and apparatus known to those skilled in the art. In a typical method, an elastomer is admixed with an elastomer solvent and/or a plasticizer and/or an emulsifier and agitated for a period of from 1 to 30 minutes. The remaining components, such as the low melting point wax, are then admixed, either in bulk or incrementally, while the gum base mixture is blended again for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
The gum composition may include amounts of conventional additives selected from, but not limited to, the following: sweetening agents (sweeteners), plasticizers, softeners, emulsifiers, waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
adjuvants, flavoring agents (flavors, flavorings), coloring agents (colorants, colorings), antioxidants, acidulants, thickeners, medicaments, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some of these additives may serve more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum compositions, a sweetener, such as maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a bulking agent.<br>
The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing gum composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include emulsifiers, such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in combination with other softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan gum, gelatin, carob, tragacanth, locust bean, and carboxy methyl cellulose, acidulants such as malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof, and fillers, such as those discussed above under the category of mineral adjuvants.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum region may also contain a bulking agent. Suitable bulking agents may be water-soluble and include sweetening agents selected from, but not limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar alcohols, and mixtures thereof; randomly bonded glucose polymers such as those polymers distributed under the tradename POLYDEXTROSE by Pfizer, Inc., Groton, Conn.; isomalt (a racemic mixture of alpha-D-gIucopyranosyl-l,6-mannitol and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-sorbitol manufactured under the tradename PALATTNIT by Suddeutsche Zucker), maltodextrins; hydrogenated starch hydrolysates; hydrogenated hexoses; hydrogenated disaccharides; minerals, such as calcium carbonate, talc, titanium dioxide, dicalcium phosphate; celluloses; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar bulking agents include monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides such as xylose, ribulose, glucose (dextrose), mannose, galactose, fructose (levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, invert sugar, partially hydrolyzed starch and corn syrup solids, and mixtures thereof.<br>

28<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
Suitable hydrogenated starch hydrolysates include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 25,959, 3,356,811, 4,279,931 and various hydrogenated glucose syrups and/or powders which contain sorbitol, hydrogenated disaccharides, hydrogenated higher polysaccharides, or mixtures thereof. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled catalytic hydrogenation of corn syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are mixtures of monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different saccharides give different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, such as LYCASIN, a commercially available product manufactured by Roquette Freres of France, and HYSTAR, a commercially available product manufactured by Lonza, Inc., of Fairlawn, N.J., are also useful.<br>

Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Desirably, the sweetener is a high intensity sweetener such as aspartame, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K).<br>
In general, an effective amount of sweetener may be utilized to provide the level of sweetness desired, and this amount may vary with the sweetener selected. The amount of sweetener may be present in amounts from about 0.001% to about 3%, by weight of the gum composition, depending upon the sweetener or combination of sweeteners used. The exact range of amounts for each type of sweetener may be selected by those skilled in the art.<br>
The flavoring agents which may be used include those flavors known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavorings may be chosen from synthetic flavor oils and flavoring aromatics and/or oils, oleoresins and extracts derived from plants, leaves, flowers, fruits, and so forth, and combinations thereof.

In some embodiments, the flavoring agents may be used in many distinct physical forms well-known in the art to provide an initial burst of flavor and/or a prolonged sensation of flavor. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of flavoring agent employed herein may be a matter of preference subject to such factors as the type of final chewing gum composition, the individual flavor, the gum base employed, and the strength of flavor desired. Thus, the amount of flavoring may be varied in order to obtain the result desired in the final product and such variations are within the capabilities of those skilled in the art without the need for undue experimentation. In gum compositions, the flavoring agent is generally present in amounts from about 0.02% to about 5%, and more specifically from about 0.1% to about 2%, and even more specifically, from about 0.8% to about 1.8%, by weight of the chewing gum composition.<br>
Coloring agents may be used in amounts effective to produce the desired color. The coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about 6%, by weight of the gum composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated in amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the gum composition. The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic applications. These colorants are known as F.D.&amp; C. dyes and lakes. The materials acceptable for the foregoing uses are preferably water-soluble. Illustrative nonlimiting examples include the indigoid dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Blue No.2, which is the disodium salt of 5,5-indigotindisulfonic acid. Similarly, the dye known as F.D.&amp; C.

Some embodiments may include a method for preparing the gum compositions, including both chewing gum and bubble gum compositions. The chewing gum compositions may be prepared using standard techniques and equipment known to those skilled in the art. The apparatus useful in accordance with some embodiments comprises mixing and heating apparatus well known in the chewing gum manufacturing arts, and therefore the selection of the specific apparatus will be apparent to the artisan.<br>
In some embodiments, a method of preparing a tooth whitening gum composition includes at least partially encapsulating at least one active component of the composition in a polymer matrix. In some embodiments, the polymer matrix may have a tensile strength of at least about 6,500 psi and/or may include at least one polymer having a water absorption of about 0.01% to about 50%. The method also includes heating a gum base to soften the base and then mixing the softened gum base with the at least partially encapsulated active component so as to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture. The method further includes cooling the mixture and forming the cooled mixture into individual gum pieces. Further components may be mixed into the softened gum base. For example, one or more of the following may typically be added: bulking agent, filler, humectant, flavorant, colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer, preservative, warming agent, cooling agent, tooth whitening agent and sweetener.<br>
In some desired embodiment, the method of preparing a gum composition of the present invention can involve combining at least one encapsulated active with a gum base. The encapsulation procedure may, in one desired embodiment, involve extrusion.<br>
For example, as detailed in the examples below, an oral delivery system of the present invention may be prepared by first melting a suitable polymer, such as polyvinyl acetate (PVAC), in a high shear mixer. A hydrogenated oil may then be added to the molten polymer. The active ingredient may then be added to the resulting mixture and mixed under high shear. The resulting filled polymer melt is then cooled and ground to a suitable size (e.g., less than 590 microns). The encapsulated active matrix may be stored in an air tight container with low humidity until it is to be employed in a gum base.<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
In some other embodiments, the method of preparing a gum composition of the present invention can involve suspending tooth whitening active particles in a fluidized air stream; and spraying a coating onto the suspended active particles. In some embodiments, the coating may include at least one polymer having a water absorption of about 0.01% to about 50%. Moreover, in some embodiments, the polymer may have a tensile strength of at least about 6,500 psi in the oral delivery system. Suitable actives are the same as those described above. Moreover, suitable polymers are the same as those described above. One or more coating layers may be sprayed onto the suspended active particles. The coating composition sprayed on the particles may include any solvent. The encapsulated particles may be combined with a gum base, as described in the Examples Section.<br>
The encapsulated particles of some embodiments may be prepared by any suitable spray coating method as known in the art. One suitable process is the Wurster process. This process provides a method for encapsulating individual particulate materials. First the particles to be encapsulated are suspended in a fluidizing air stream which provides a generally cyclic flow in front of a spray nozzle. The spray nozzle sprays an atomized flow of the coating solution.<br>
The atomized barrier coating solution collides with the particles as they are carried away from the nozzle to provide a particle coating with the coating solution. The temperature of the fluidizing air stream, which also serves to suspend the particles to be coated, may be adjusted to evaporate the solvent shortly after the coating solution contacts the particles. This serves to solidify the coating on the particles, resulting in the desired encapsulated particle.<br>
This process may be repeated until the desired thickness of the coating is achieved. Alternatively, the process may be repeated with a different coating solution to provide different and distinct coating layers in the encapsulated particle composition.<br>
Following the coating process, the particles may then be formed to an appropriate size as desired, generally from an average particle size range of about 50 m to about 800 m. This may be accomplished by any suitable means such as chopping, pulverizing, milling or grinding the particles.<br>

WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
in some embodiments, gum pieces may be coated with an aqueous gum coating composition, which may be applied by any method known in the art. The gum coating composition may be present in an amount from about 25% to about 35% by weight of the total gum piece, more specifically about 30% by weight of the gum piece.<br>
The outer gum coating may be hard or crunchy. Typically, the outer gum coating may include sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, isomalt, and other crystallizable polyols; sucrose may also be used. Flavors may also be added to yield unique product characteristics. Moreover, the outer gum coating may include one or more of the encapsulated active agents provided herein.<br>
The gum coating, if present, may include several opaque layers, such that the chewing gum composition is not visible through the coating itself, which can optionally be covered with a further one or more transparent layers for aesthetic, textural and protective purposes. The outer gum coating may also contain small amounts of water and gum arabic. The gum coating can be further coated with wax. The gum coating may be applied in a conventional manner by successive applications of a coating solution, with drying in between each coat. As the coating dries it usually becomes opaque and is usually white, though other colorants may be added. A polyol coating can be further coated with wax. The gum coating can further include colored flakes or speckles.<br>
If the composition comprises a gum coating, it is possible that one or more oral care actives can be dispersed throughout the coating. This may be preferred if one or more oral care actives is incompatible in a single phase composition with another of the actives. Moreover, it is well within the contemplation of the present invention that providing one or more of the stain-removing agents in the gum coating can enhance the stain-removing efficacy of the total composition.<br>
The encapsulated active can be included in one or more of the chewing gum regions such as the gum coating, the gum base or both. Additionally, the encapsulated active can be added at different stages of the manufacture, alone or as a premix with other components. For example, in some embodiments, the method for preparing a gum composition includes heating a gum base to soften the base; and mixing the softened gum base with at least one of the following: elastomer, wax, emulsifier, bulking agent, filler, humectant, flavorant,<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer, preservative, warming agent, cooling agent, encapsulated active agent and sweetener to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture. The method also involves cooling the mixture; forming the cooled mixture into individual gum pieces; and coating the gum pieces with a gum coating solution including the encapsulated active. One or more other components may be included in the gum coating, such as including, but not limited to, the following: gum arabic, flavorant, colorant, sweetener, bulking agent, filler, anti-adherent compound, dispersing agent, moisture absorbing compound, warming agent, cooling agent and film-forming agent.<br>
The gum coating may be formulated to assist with increasing the thermal stability of the gum piece and preventing leaking of a liquid fill if the gum product is a center-filled gum. In some embodiments, the gum coating may include a gelatin composition. The gelatin composition may be added as a 40% by weight solution and may be present in the gum coating composition from about 5% to about 10% by weight of the gum coating composition, and more specifically about 7% to about 8%. The gel strength of the gelatin may be from about 130 bloom to about 250 bloom.<br>
Additives, such as physiological cooling agents, throat-soothing agents, spices, warming agents, tooth-whitening agents, breath-freshening agents, vitamins minerals, caffeine, drugs and other actives may be included in any or all portions of the chewing gum composition. Such components may be used in amounts sufficient to achieve their intended<br>
effects.<br>
With respect to cooling agents, a variety of well known cooling agents may be employed. For example, among the useful cooling agents are included menthol, xylitol, menthane, menthone, menthyl acetate, menthyl salicylate, N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl butanamide (WS-23), N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide (WS-3), menthyl succinate, 3,1-menthoxypropane 1,2-diol, among others. These and other suitable cooling agents are further described in the following U.S. patents, all of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference hereto: U.S. 4,230,688 and 4,032,661 to Rowsell et al.; 4,459,425 to Amano et al.; 4,136,163 to Watson et al.; and 5,266,592 to Grub et al. These cooling agents may be present in one or more of the outer gum coatings, the gum region surrounding the liquid fill, the liquid fill per se, or in any combination of those three gum areas. Cooling agents, when used in the outer coating composition for the gum, are generally present in amount of 0.01% to<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
about 1.0%. When used in the other portions of the gum, such as the gum region or the center fill, they may be present in amounts of about 0.001 to about 10% by weight of the total chewing gum piece.<br>
Warming components may be selected from a wide variety of compounds known to provide the sensory signal of warming to the user. These compounds offer the perceived sensation of warmth, particularly in the oral cavity, and often enhance the perception of flavors, sweeteners and other organoleptic components. Among the useful wanning compounds included are vanillyl alcohol n-butylether (TK-1000) supplied by Takasago Perfumary Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan, vanillyl alcohol n-propylether, vanillyl alcohol isopropylether, vanillyl alcohol isobutylether, vanillyl alcohol n-aminoether, vanillyl alcohol isoamyleather, vanillyl alcohol n-hexyleather, vanillyl alcohol methylether, vanillyl alcohol ethyleather, gingerol, shogaol, paradol, zingerone, capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, ethanol, isopropol alcohol, iso-amylalcohol, benzyl alcohol, glycerine, and combinations thereof.<br>

The resulting filled polymer melt is cooled and ground to a particle size of less than 590 microns. The encapsulation is stored in air tight containers with low humidity below 35°C.<br>
Example 4: Chewing Gum Composition Including STP/Polyvinylacetate Encapsulation (From Example 1)<br>

The % amount of STP remaining in the bolus was measured over a period of about 20 minutes. The results in Table 5 are presented graphically in Figure 1.<br>
TABLE 5<br><br>
Chewing Time	0Min.	5Min.	10Min.	15Min.	20Min.<br>

Encapsulated STP	100.0%	79.0%	44.0%	27.0%	14.0%<br>
Based on the results in Table 5 (and Figure 1), it can be seen that a delivery system of the present invention permits a controlled amount of the active (e.g., STP) to be released over a longer period of time, as compared to a gum composition where the active is free. In contrast, in the gum where the active is free, a high concentration of the active is initially delivered, followed by no active, which is undesirable. The delivery systems of the present invention enhance the uniformity of the active's release, and prolong its release in a controlled manner.<br>
Example 5: Evaluation of Stain Removal Efficacy of Chewing Gum Compositions Including Free Versus Encapsulated Active(s)<br>
Chewing gums containing free and encapsulated STP were evaluated for their stain removal efficacy. In particular, the chewing gum compositions were tested for their ability to remove stains on eight enamel pieces. The mean values are shown in Table 6 below. The experiment was conducted using a modification of the laboratory methods developed by Kleber, CJ et al; A mastication device designed for the evaluation of chewing gums, J Dent Res. 60 (11); 109-114, Nov 1981. The amount of stain on the teeth before and after treatment was measured quantitatively using a colorimeter. In preparation for treatment, the baseline L*a*b* stain scores of the tooth specimens were determined and used to stratify the teeth into balanced groups of 8 specimens each. A mechanical instrument with a flow system to simulate the human mastication was used to treat the tooth specimens with the test chewing gum. For testing, a specimen block with an enamel squares was placed in both the upper and lower tooth holders of the instrument.<br>
Artificial saliva (15 ml, pH 7.5) was placed in the reservoir. Approximately 1.5 grams of test chewing gum (i.e. 2 tablets) was placed between the repositioning paddles directly over the lower tooth specimen. Then the mastication motor was started and the two specimen<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/127053	PCT/US2006/000364<br>
blocks with the enamel squares were treated with the chewing gums for 10 minutes. This treatment procedure was repeated for 6 consecutive times (a total of 60 minutes of treatment. Fresh gums and artificial saliva were used for each 10-minute treatment period. Following the 6th treatment, the specimens were rinsed, allowed to dry for 30 minutes, and color readings made.<br>
Stain Measurement<br>
The color of the extrinsic stain on the bovine teeth was measured by taking diffuse reflectance absorbance readings with a Minolta spectrophotometer8. Absorbance measurement over the entire visible color spectrum were obtained using the QELAB color scale. This scale quantifies color according to a 3 parameters, L* (lightness-darkness scale), a* (red-green chroma), and b* (yellow-blue chroma). In order to obtain reproducible readings, the stained enamel specimens were allowed to air-dry at room temperature for 30 minutes before measurements were made. Measurements were conducted by aligning the center of the 4-mm square segment of stained enamel directly over the 3-mm-diameter targeting aperture of the Minolta spectrophotometer. An average of 3 absorbance readings using the L*a*b* scale were taken for each specimen.<br>
Stain Calculations<br>
The overall change in the color of the stained teeth was calculated using the CIELAB equation E = [(L*)2 + (a*)2 + (b*)2]1/2. The individual components of the L*a*b* scale represent the specific changes in the whiteness (L*), red-green color (a*), and yellow-blue color (b*). The AE value summarizes the overall change for each color factor (AL*, Aa*, and Ab*) and represents the ability of the test chewing gum to remove stain and whiten teeth. The data were calculated and defined as follows: Stain Removed = AE score after treatment (Table 6 below).<br>

As shown in Table 6, a chewing gum composition including encapsulated STP (from Example 1), changed the color of the stained teeth by a greater amount than the same gum composition including free STP. Moreover, a chewing gum composition including encapsulated sodium stearate and STP (from Example 2) changed the color of the stained teeth by a greater amount than the same gum composition including free sodium stearate and STP.<br>
Example 6: Encapsulation of Enzymes<br>
The delivery systems of Example 6 are directed to encapsulation of glucose oxidase, either alone (Table 7) or in combination with other actives (Table 8). The delivery system components are shown below in Tables 7 and 8.<br>
In the delivery systems of the present example, glucose oxidase is first encapsulated in gum Arabic. This is done in an effort to provide the heat-labile enzyme with a protective coating prior to its encapsulation in polyvinyl acetate. For example, the glucose oxidase may be spray coated onto suspended enzyme particles in a fluidized air stream. A gum arabic coating may then be sprayed onto the suspended enzyme particles. Thereafter, the coated enzyme particles may be encapsulated in polyvinyl acetate, alone or in combination with other actives. In the delivery systems of the present example, glucose is an enzyme activator. The reaction of glucose with glucose oxidase results in the production of a peroxide. Sucralose, where present, serves as a taste masking agent.<br>
