				<td>CRYOGENIC COOLING SYSTEM FOR ROTOR HAVING A HIGH<br>
TEMPERATURE SUPER-CONDUCTING FIELD WINDING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a cryogenic cooling system for synchronous<br>
machine having a rotor with a high temperature superconducting (HTS) coil. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an evaporative cooling system to provide<br>
cryogenic fluid to the rotor and to re-cool used cooling fluid returned from the rotor.<br>
High temperature super-conducting generators require highly reliable, low cost<br>
cryorefrigeration equipment in order to be viable as commercial products. To achieve<br>
high reliability with existing cryorefrigeration equipment involves redundant<br>
cryorefrigerator components. The inadequate reliability of these components and the<br>
requirement that HTS rotors have an uninterrupted supply of cooling fluid<br>
necessitates that redundant components be included in cryorefrigeration systems for<br>
HTS rotors.<br>
However, the cost of cryorefrigeration systems is substantially increased due to the<br>
need for redundant cryorefrigerator components. Moreover, existing cryorefrigeration<br>
systems require frequent maintenance due to their inadequate reliability and system<br>
redundancies. Accordingly, the operating cost of these systems is relatively high.<br>
The purchase and operating costs of existing cryorefrigeration systems significantly<br>
adds to the cost of machines having HTS rotors. These high costs have contributed to<br>
the heretofore commercial impracticalities of incorporating HTS rotors into<br>
commercially marketable synchronous machines. Accordingly, there is a substantial<br>
and previously unmet need for cryorefrigeration systems that are less expensive,<br>
inexpensive to operate and provide a reliable supply of cryogenic cooling fluid to a<br>
HTS rotor.<br><br>
Synchronous electrical machines having field coil windings include, but are not<br>
limited to, rotary generators, rotary motors, and linear motors. These machines<br>
generally comprise a stator and rotor that are electromagnetically coupled. The rotor<br>
may include a multi-pole rotor core and coil windings mounted on the rotor core. The<br>
rotor cores may include a magnetically-permeable solid material, such as an iron<br>
forging.<br>
Conventional copper windings are commonly used in the rotors of synchronous<br>
electrical machines. However, the electrical resistance of copper windings (although<br>
low by conventional measures) is sufficient to contribute to substantial heating of the<br>
rotor and to diminish the power efficiency of the machine. Recently, super-<br>
conducting (SC) coil windings have been developed for rotors. SC windings have<br>
effectively no resistance and are highly advantageous rotor coil windings.<br>
Iron-core rotors saturate at air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla. Known<br>
super-conductive rotors employ air-core designs, with no iron in the rotor, to achieve<br>
air-gap magnetic fields of 3 Tesla or higher, which increase the power density of the<br>
electrical machine and result in significant reduction in weight and size. Air-core<br>
super-conductive rotors, however require large amounts of super-conducting wire,<br>
which adds to the number of coils required, the complexity of the coil supports, and<br>
the cost.<br>
Super-conductive rotors have their super-conducting coils cooled by liquid helium,<br>
with the used helium being returned as room-temperature gaseous helium. Using<br>
liquid helium for cryogenic cooling requires continuous reliquefaction of the returned,<br>
room- temperature gaseous helium, and such reliquefaction poses significant<br>
reliability problems and requires significant auxiliary power. Accordingly, there is a<br>
need for a cryogenic cooling system that reliquefies the hot, used cooling fluid<br>
returned from the rotor. The reliquefied cooling fluid should then be available for<br>
reuse as a HTS rotor cooling fluid.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
A highly reliable cryogenic cooling system has been developed for a HTS rotor for a<br>
synchronous machine. The cooling system provides a steady supply of cooling fluid<br>
to an HTS rotor. Moreover, the cooling system is economical in its construction and<br>
operation. The reliability and economy of the cooling system facilitates the<br>
development of a commercially viable synchronous machine with a HTS rotor.<br>
The cryogenic cooling system is a gravity fed close-loop evaporative cooling system<br>
for high temperature super-conducting (HTS) rotor. The system comprises an<br>
elevated cryogen storage tank, vacuum jacketed transfer lines that supply liquid<br>
cryogen to the rotor and return vapor to the storage tank, and a cryorefrigerator in the<br>
vapor space of the storage tank that recondenses the vapor. The cryorefrigerator may<br>
be a single stage Gifford-McMahon cryocooler or pulse tube with separate or integral<br>
compressor. The cryogenic fluid may be neon, hydrogen or other such cooling fluid.<br>
In a first embodiment, the invention is a cooling fluid system for providing cryogenic<br>
cooling fluid to a high temperature super-conducting rotor comprising: a cryogen<br>
storage tank storing a liquid cryogenic cooling fluid; an inlet transfer line connecting<br>
the storage tank to the rotor and forming a passage for liquid cooling fluid to pass<br>
from the tank to the rotor, wherein the storage tank is elevated above the rotor and the<br>
liquid cooling fluid is gravity fed to the rotor.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a cooling fluid system coupled to a high<br>
temperature super-conducting rotor for a synchronous machine and a source of<br>
cryogenic cooling fluid comprising: a cryogenic storage tank and a supply of<br>
cryogenic cooling fluid stored in the tank, wherein the tank is elevated above the<br>
rotor; an inlet line providing a fluid passage for the cooling fluid between the tank an<br>
the rotor; a return line providing a fluid passage for the cooling fluid between the<br>
rotor and tank, and a cryorefrigerator cooling the fluid in the storage tank.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention is a method for cooling a super-conducting<br>
field winding coil in a rotor of a synchronous machine using an elevated cryogen<br>
storage device comprising the steps of: storing cryogenic cooling fluid in the tank,<br>
wherein the tank is elevated above the rotor; allowing the cooling fluid to flow under<br><br>
the force of gravity from the tank to the rotor; cooling the field winding coil with the<br>
cooling fluid, and returning the cooling fluid to the tank.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying drawings in conjunction with the text of this specification describe<br>
an embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a schematic side view of schematic super-conductive (SC) rotor shown<br>
within a stator.<br>
FIGURE 2 is a schematic perspective view of a race-track SC coil having cooling gas<br>
passages.<br>
FIGURE 3 is a schematic diagram of a cryogenic cooling system to supply cooling<br>
fluid to a SC rotor.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an exemplary synchronous generator machine 10 having a stator 12<br>
and a rotor 14. The rotor includes field winding coils 34 that fit inside the cylindrical<br>
rotor vacuum cavity 16 of the stator. The rotor 14 fits inside the rotor vacuum cavity<br>
16 of the stator. As the rotor turns within the stator, a magnetic field 18 (shown by<br>
dotted lines) generated by the rotor and rotor coils moves through the stator and<br>
creates an electrical current in the windings of the stator coils 19. This current is<br>
output by the generator as electrical power.<br>
The rotor 14 has a generally longitudinally-extending axis 20 and a generally solid<br>
rotor core 22. The solid core 22 has high magnetic permeability, and is usually made<br>
of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron. In a low power density super-conducting<br>
machine, the iron core of the rotor is used to reduce the magnetomotive force (MMF),<br>
and, thus, minimize the coil winding usage. For example, the iron of the rotor can be<br>
magnetically saturated at an air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
The rotor 14 supports a generally longitudinally-extending, race-track shaped high<br>
temperature super-conducting (HTS) coil winding. HTS coil winding may be<br><br>
alternatively a saddle-shape coil or have some other coil winding shape that is suitable<br>
for a particular HTS rotor design. The cooling system disclosed here may be adapted<br>
for coil winding and rotor configurations other than a race-track coil mounted on a<br>
solid core rotor.<br>
The rotor includes end shafts 24, 30 that bracket the core 22 and are supported by<br>
bearings 25. The collector end shaft 24 has a cryogen transfer coupling 26 to a source<br>
of cryogenic cooling fluid used to cool the SC coil windings in the rotor. The cryogen<br>
transfer coupling 26 includes a stationary segment coupled to a source of cryogen<br>
cooling fluid and a rotating segment which provides cooling fluid to the HTS coil.<br>
The collector end shaft may also include collector rings 78 to connect the rotor coil 34<br>
to an external electrical device or power supply. The drive end shaft 30 may be a<br>
power turbine coupling 32.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an exemplary HTS race-track field coil winding 34. The SC field<br>
winding 34 of the rotor includes a high temperature super-conducting coil 36. Each<br>
HTS coil includes a high temperature super-conductor, such as a BSCCO<br>
(BixSrxCaxCuxOx) conductor wires laminated in a solid epoxy impregnated winding<br>
composite. For example, a series of BSCCO 2223 wires may be laminated, bonded<br>
together and wound into a solid epoxy impregnated coil.<br>
HTS wire is brittle and easy to be damaged. The HTS coil is typically layer wound<br>
with HTS tape, then epoxy impregnated. The HTS tape is wrapped in a precision coil<br>
form to attain close dimensional tolerances. The tape is wound around in a helix to<br>
form the race-track SC coil 36.<br>
The dimensions of the race-track coil are dependent on the dimensions of the rotor<br>
core. Generally, each race-track coil encircles the magnetic poles of the rotor core,<br>
and is parallel to the rotor axis. The HTS coil windings are continuous around the<br>
race-track. The coils form a resistance free current path around the rotor core and<br>
between the magnetic poles of the core.<br>
Fluid passages 38 for cryogenic cooling fluid are included in the coil winding 34.<br>
These passages may extend around an outside edge of the SC coil 36. The<br><br>
passageways provide cryogenic cooling fluid to the coils and remove heat from those<br>
coils. The cooling fluid maintains the low temperatures, e.g., 27°K, in the SC coil<br>
winding needed to promote super-conducting conditions, including the absence of<br>
electrical resistance in the coil. The cooling passages have input and output ports 39<br>
at one end of the rotor core. These ports 39 connect to cooling passages 38 on the SC<br>
coil to the cryogen transfer coupling 26.<br>
FIGURE 3 is a schematic of a cryorefrigeration system 50 for a HTS generator 10. A<br>
storage cryogenic tank 52 or dewar stores liquid cryogen. The tank is positioned at an<br>
elevated height 54 relative to the HTS generator. The height of the tank above the<br>
rotor is proportional to the required pressure of cooling fluid entering the rotor, and<br>
inversely proportional to the density of the cooling fluid. Due to the height of the<br>
tank, gravity forces cooling fluid from the cooling tank into the rotor coupling 26 and<br>
into the SC coils 34. Gravity does not fail, does not require maintenance, and is free.<br>
Accordingly, the gravity-fed cooling system is highly reliable and economical.<br>
The cooling system is a closed-loop system. Cooling fluid from the tank 52 flows<br>
through an inlet transfer 56 that connects the tank to the rotor coupling 26. The<br>
cooling fluid passes through vacuum jacketed cooling passages in the end shaft 24<br>
and through the cooling passages 38 around the SC coils 36. The cooling fluid<br>
maintains the coil at cryogenic temperatures by evaporative cooling and ensures that<br>
the coils operate in super-conducting conditions. Used cooling fluid, typically in the<br>
form of cold gas, exits the cooling passage 38 from the coil, flows through the<br>
vacuum jacketed passages in the end shaft and through the cooling coupling 26. A<br>
return transfer line 58 carries the return cooling fluid from the rotor to the storage tank<br>
52. The inlet and transfer lines are vacuum jacketed and thus heavily insulated. The<br>
vacuum insulation of the transfer lines minimizes heat transfer losses in the cooling<br>
fluid as it flows from the tank to the rotor, and from the rotor to the tank.<br>
The cooling fluid is usually inert, such as neon or hydrogen. Temperatures that are<br>
suitable for HTS super-conductors are generally below 30° and preferably around<br>
27°K. Cryogenic fluids most suitable to cool the SC coils in the HTS rotor are<br>
hydrogen which may cool a coil to 20°K, and neon which may cool the SC coil at<br><br>
27°K. Liquid neon exits the cryorefrigerator tank 52 at a temperature around 27°K,<br>
for example. Liquid cryogen is generally used in the storage tank 52 to supply the<br>
HTS rotor with liquid cooling fluid. The vacuum jacketed inlet transfer line ensures<br>
that the liquid cooling fluid from the storage tank enters the rotor at substantially the<br>
same temperature as the fluid left the tank.<br>
The cooling liquid evaporates as it flows around the SC coils. The evaporation of the<br>
cooling fluid cools the SC coils and ensures that the coils operate in super-conducting<br>
conditions. The evaporated cooling fluid flows as a cold gas from the HTS rotor,<br>
through the return line 58 to the cooling tank 52. The return line is sized to pass the<br>
cold cooling gas from the rotor into an upper vapor region 60 of the tank 52. The<br>
vapor area of the tank is vertically above a liquid region 62 of the tank. The vapor<br>
region and liquid region of the tank may be a single continuous volume in the tank, or<br>
they may be separate compartments in fluid communication with each other.<br>
Reliquefication of the gaseous cooling fluid in the storage tank is performed by a<br>
cold-head recondenser 64. The recondenser extracts heat from the gaseous cooling<br>
fluid in the tank so that the fluid condenses into its liquid form and flows down into<br>
the liquid area of the tank. The recondenser need not operate continuously as the tank<br>
has a supply of liquid cooling fluid for the HTS rotor. The liquid cooling fluid in the<br>
tank provides an uninterruptible supply of cooling fluid for the HTS rotor. Thus, the<br>
recondenser may be serviced while the HTS generator continues uninterrupted<br>
operation. The recondenser may temporarily fail without necessitating that the HTS<br>
rotor be shut down while the recondenser is repaired. When the HTS rotor is shut<br>
down for normal service the tank can be serviced via a service stack 66.<br>
The cryorefrigerator 64 may comprise one or more Gifford-McMahon or pulse-tube<br>
cold-head units, as required to meet the refrigeration capacity of the HTS rotor. The<br>
cryorefrigerator may be a recondenser that condenses vapor to liquid. Redundant<br>
cryorefrigeator units should not be generally necessary. Excess capacity for the<br>
cryorefrigerator is not needed because the cryogen storage tank has sufficient storage<br>
capacity of liquid cooling fluid to allow the condensing refrigeration units 64 to be<br>
shut down for maintenance or replacement without affecting the operation of the<br><br>
rotor. The storage volume of the tank is sized to provide sufficient liquid to the rotor<br>
over the period of time that the recondenser is shut down, one day for example, in<br>
which case the typical storage capacity for a HTS rotor cooled with neon would be<br>
about 100 liters. During periods when the cryorefrigerator is shut down, the cooling<br>
system operates in an open-loop such that the cooling fluid vapor returned from the<br>
rotor is discharged to the outside atmosphere via a service stack vent 66. Lost<br>
cryogen liquid is replenished by refilling the storage tank after the cryorefrigerator is<br>
back in operation.<br>
In operation, liquid cryogen is gravity fed from the liquid area 62 of the storage tank<br>
52 through the vacuum jacketed transfer input line 56 to the transfer coupling 26 of<br>
the super-conducting rotor. The cooling liquid circulates through the heat exchanger<br>
tubing 38 in contact with the outside of the HTS coil, and thereby cools the coil 36 by<br>
boiling heat transfer. The gaseous cooling vapor returns from the rotor transfer<br>
coupling 26 through the vacuum jacketed return transfer line 58 to the top (vapor<br>
region 60) of the storage tank. The driving force that circulates the cooling fluid<br>
through the closed-loop system is the pressure difference that results from the heavy<br>
liquid inlet column height 54 compared to the light gaseous return column height 54.<br>
The cryorefrigerator cold head 64 operates in the vapor space 60 of the storage tank to<br>
re-condense the vapor. By recondensing the cooling fluid, the fluid returns to the<br>
liquid region of the tank and is available for reuse to cool the HTS rotor. The system<br>
is a closed-loop system that reuses the cooling fluid and avoids leakage of the fluid.<br>
However, the system may operate as an open-loop system if the cryorefrigerator is not<br>
operating. Moreover, the proposed rotor cooling system can be used effectively to<br>
cool down the rotor in open-loop mode of operation by pressurizing the storage tank<br>
vapor space to force more liquid through the rotor as required for rapid cool-down.<br>
The cooling system 50 is economical and reliable. The system relies on gravity and a<br>
tank of cooling liquid to provide an uninterrupted supply of cooling fluid, in an<br>
inexpensive manner. The system further minimizes potential failure by ensuring that<br>
service intensive systems, such as the cryorefrigeration is not needed for continuous<br>
operation.<br><br>

considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
