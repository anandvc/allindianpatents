				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for controlling at least the local activity of a portion of an invivo smooth muscle. The application has been divided out of Indian Patent application NO. 1346CAL97.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many body tissues, activity of individual cells, especially contraction, is initiated by changes in trans-membrane potentials. These types of tissue are also called excitable tissue, since when they are excited by an electrical signal, they react by activation. Some examples of excitable tissue include: cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and neural tissue. In many cases, the activity of large numbers of such excitable tissue cells is synchronized by propagating electrical activation signals. An activation signal is an electrical signal which, when it reaches an excitable cell, causes it to depolarize and perform its activity. In addition,, the depolarization creates a new propagating activation signal which then continues to propagate towanis the next un-activated cell. In most excitable tissue, the cell is refectory after a depolarization, such that the activation signal cannot immediately travel backwards.<br>
The gastrointestiaal (GI) tract is an example of a major physiological system in which many activities are coordinated by propagating electrical activation signals. The GI tract comprise a stomach, a small intestine and a large intestine. In a typical digestive process, food is chewed in the mouth and enters the stomach for digestion. The food is periodically passed to the antrum for grinding down and then passed back to the stomach. After a period of time, the pyloric sphincter opens and the food is passed to the small intestine. In the small intestine the food is churned and passed forward by a rhythmic motion of the intestines, until it reaches the large intestine. A one way sphincter allows movement only from the small intestine to the large intestine. Once in the large intestine, the food is further churned and compacted by motions of the large intestines. These motions also advance the digested food, now feces, to a pair of outlet sphincters, which mark the end of the GI tract.<br>
The GI tract is mostly composed of smooth muscle, which, when depolarized, contracts. Ail of the above described movements of the GI tract are synchronized by propagating activation signals. As can be appreciated, in many cases, these electrical signals are not properly activated and/or responded to, resulting in disease. In one example, an talcer causes inflammation of GI tissue. The inflamed tissue may generate spurious activation signals, which can cause the stomach to contract in a chaotic manner. The inflamed tissue may<br>
1<br><br>
also affect the activation profile of the stomach by not conducting activation signals or by having a different conduction velocity than healthy tissue.<br>
Pacing the Gl tract is well known in the art, for example as shown in US patents 5,292,344 and 5,540,730, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The 730 patent describes both increasing and decreashag the excitability of the Gl tract by stimulating different portions of the vagus nerve. The '344 Patent describes a pacemaker which -directly stimulates portions of the Gl tract. Electrical stimulation of the Gl tract is als6 known to be used for stiinulating the Gl tract of patients suffering from post operative damping syndrome, as evidenced by SU 1039506, the disclosure of which is incoiporated herein by reference.<br>
The uterus also comprises smooth muscle, which contracts in response to electrical activation signals. "Uterine Electromyography: A Critical Review" by D. Devedeux, et al.. Am. J. Obstet Gynecol 1993; 169:1636-53, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes the different types of uterine muscle and electrical signals generated by such, muscles. An important finding which is described therein is that electrical activity in the uterus appears to be uncorrelated prior to labor, but when labor is established, the contractions and the electrical activity associated to them become highly synchronized.<br>
In current medical practice, labor can be delayed by administering certain drugs. However, the operation of these drugs is somewhat uncertain. In addition, labor can be induced using other drugs, such as Oxytocin. Unfortunately, the dosage of Oxytocin which is required cannot be known in advance and overdoses of the drug can result in. over-contraction which can mechanically damage the fetus and/or the mother.<br>
SU 709078, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes stimulating the uterus after labor using an extemally applied electrical current, to increase the contractions and aid in the expulsion of the afterbirth and reduce bleeding by rapidly shrinking<br>
the uterus.<br>
The use of locally applied electrical fields for reducing pain is well- known in. the art.<br>
"Electrical Field Stimulation - Meditated Relaxation of a Rabbit Middle Cerebral Artery",<br>
D.A. Van Ripper and J. A. Sevan, Circulatory Research 1992; 70:1104-1112, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference, describes causing the relaxation of an artery by<br>
applying an electric field. US Patent 4,537,195, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference, describes treatment of pain using TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve<br>
stimulation), for treatment of headaches. It is hypothesized ia this patent that the electrical<br>
2<br><br>
stimuiation prevents the constriction of arteries by stimulation of the muscle in the walls of the arteries, thereby preventing the dilation of capillaries, which dilation is a cause of headaches.<br>
SU 1147408, the disclostire of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a method of changing the distribution of blood flow in and about the liver, by applying electrical fields to arteries, varying the frequency of the field in synchrony with the cardiac rhythm.<br>
US Patent 5,447,526, the disclosure of which is mcorporated herein by reference, describes a transcutaneous electrical smooth muscle controller for inhibiting or decreasing the contraction of smooth muscle, especially uterine muscle. The controller, which is applied to the outside of the abdomen may also sense muscle contractions and effect inhibitory or stimulatory pulses unto the uterus as a whole, depending on the medical application, in response to sensed contractions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly , the present invention provides an apparatus for controlling at least the local activity of a portion of an invivo smooth muscle, comprising:<br>
-a plurality of electrodes, adapted to be in contact with a portion of smooth muscle<br>
to be controlled; and - a controller which electrifies said electrodes with a non excitatory electrical field<br>
of a magnitude and at a timing at which it is unable to generate a propagating<br>
action potential in the smooth muscle, which electrical field modifies the reaction<br>
of the smooth muscle to an activation signal.<br>
Such control is especially employed, in particular preferred embodiments of the invention, in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the uterus, the bladder, endocrine glands, the gall bladder and blood vessels.<br>
3<br><br>
The inventors have found that the force of contraction of a smooth muscle can be both increased and decreased by a judicial application of a non-excitatoiy electric field. A non-excitatory electric field is an electric field which does not induce a propagating action potential in the smooth muscle. Such a non-excitatory electric field does, however, modify the reaction of the smooth muscle to an excitatory field. The inventors have also found that it is possible to desensitize smooth muscle to an activation signal, thereby the desensitized smooth muscle does not respond to an activation signal and also does not propagate the activation signal. Shortly after the field is removed, its effects are undone. It should be appreciated that many smooth muscles are characterized by multiple layers of fibers, the fibers in each layer iaving a preferred orientation. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, individual layers  are selectively controiled by applying the electric field to be substantially parallel to the fiber orientation (in which case the field is highly effective). When a lesser degree of interaction between the muscle layer and the field is desired, the field is preferably applied perpendicular to the muscle fibers.<br>
It is an object of some embodiments of the present invention to provide a method of more precisely controlling the GI tract than is possible using drugs and/or single or multi-site<br>
3A<br><br>
pacing. In a   preferred embodiment of the present invention, the force of contraction of a portion of the GI tract is increased, such as to compensated for weakened contraction and/or to advance an otherwise stuck bolus. Alternatively or additionally, the force of contraction may be reduced, such as to treat a patient with overly sensitive intestines. Alternatively or additionally, a section of the intestines may be desensitized or blocked from electrical activation signals in order to promote the healing of a lesion in the section. Reducing or blocking contraction is also useful in treating acute diarrhea and to stop leakage from a stoma, when such leakage is undesired. Additionally or alternatively, the activation profile of the GI tract, which normally includes a forward moving wave and a returning wave, is changed, for example, by blocking the returning wave (the reflux), so as to increase the motility of the intestines. Blocking the returning wave may be peifonned by desensitizing one or more segments of the intestines after the forward wave has passed, so that the returning wave will be stopped at the desensitized segment. Alternatively, the entire length of the intestines is desensitized for the duration of the returning wave. After the returning wave is stopped, the desensitizing field is preferably stopped so as to allow the forward wave to properly propagate. The forward and returning waves can be detected either by their mechanical activity or, more preferably, by their electrical activity.<br>
In a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention, the tension of the lower end of the colon is reduced so as to improve local blood supply and aid in the healing of hemorrhoids and anal fissures. It has recentiy been suggested that much of the pain associated with hemorrhoids is caused by ischemia of the tissue, which in turn, is caused by abnormally increased tension of the lower colon. Such tension has been hereunto been treated using topically applied drugs, such as nitroglycerin.<br>
An endoscope, in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, locally controls the activity of the intestines so as to cause the smooth muscle to advance and/or retreat the endoscope. Alternatively or additionally, local electrical, desensitization is used as a replacement and/or in addition to relaxation of the bowels using drugs.<br>
Although some of the embodiments of the present invention have been described with respect to an endoscope or a colonoscope, these embodiments of the invention should be understood to apply to invasive probes in general and to endoscopes," colonoscopes, hysteroscopes and rectoscopes, in particular.<br>
4<br><br>
It is an object of another preferred embodiment of the present invention to provide a<br>
method of more precisely controlling labor, including, delaying and/or advancing the onset of<br>
labor, increasing or decreasing the length of labor and/or stopping labor from proceeding after<br>
it has started or when it is still in the pre-labor stages. Stopping labor is especially important<br>
for treating cases of pre-term onset of labor. Such control is exerted, in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, by reducing the contractility of the uterine muscles,-<br>
increasing their contractility or by desensitizing them so that synchronized contractions cannot<br>
occur. It is hypothesized that labor is a self-feeding process, where increased forces of<br>
contraction generate even stronger forces of contraction in the next contraction cycle. By<br>
damping the contraction force, such a feedback loop can be broken. In addition, when the<br>
uterus is desensitized, contractions cannot occur and labor is at least temporarily stopped,<br>
without significant danger to the fetus, as might be expected from drugs. Labor interrupted in<br>
this way can be rapidly restarted, without the problems associated which drug-terraioated<br>
labor. In a preferred enibodiment of the invention, spurious electrical activation signals arising<br>
from anomalous portions of the uterus, such as fibroid containing portions, which activation<br>
signals may cause premature labor, are reduced by local desensitizing and/or blocking of the<br>
uterine tissue.<br>
It accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, menstruationally<br>
meditated contractions of the uterus (cramps) are treated by detecting such cramps and<br>
applying a desensitizing electrical field to the uterus to damp such cramps. Alternatively, such<br>
a desensitiziug electric field may be applied during the time when such cramps may be<br>
expected to occur.<br>
An object of another preferred embodiment of the present invention is to control the<br>
contractility of the bladder. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the bladder is<br>
desensitized such that it does not spontaneously contract when such contraction is undesirable.<br>
Preferably, an apparatus for controlling the bladder m accordance with a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, includes a feedback mechanism, which stops its activity when the bladder<br>
becomes over full. In an additional or alternative embodiment of the invention, the force of<br>
contraction of the bladder is increased during urination. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the force of contraction of the bladder is increased ia patients having bladder<br>
hypertrophy, so that the bladder will gradually shrink. Such treatment is preferably combiaed<br>
with drug treatment and/or an implantation of a stent, which treatments may be used to reduce<br>
blockage of the urethra,<br>
5<br><br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, the output rate of endocrine  or neuro-endocrine  glands is  controlled,  preferably  reduced,  by "applying  a desensitizing electric field. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a desensitizing electric field is applied to the beta islet cells of the pancreas, so as to reduce insulin generation in patients suffering from hyper-insulinemia levels. Preferably, such control is applied without measuring the electrical activity of the beta islet cells. Alternatively of additionally, such control is applied while monitoring the blood glucose level. The desensitizing field is preferably a locally applied DC field, whose polarity is switched at a very low frequency, such as once an hour, so as to avoid polarization of the electrodes and/or damage to the tissue.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to treating vascular spasm, angina pectoris and/or abnormal blood pressure, by electrically controlling large blood vessels in the body. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, large veins, such as the abdominal veins are relaxed by applying a local inhibitory electric field to them. Altemativeiy or additionally, large arteries, such as the aorta, are relaxed by applying a local inhibitory electric field to them. Alternatively or additionally, excitatory fields are applied to the arteries and/or veins so as to constrict them. As can be appreciated, changing the volume of the arteries and veins can directly affect a patient's blood pressure and/or cardiovascular performance. In addition, relaxing the veins reduces the preload to the heart, which can stop an episode of ischemia,e.g., angina pectoris. Further, relaxing the aorta is useful in cases of vascular spasm, which, in many cases, is the cause of angina pectoris.<br>
The relaxing electrical field is preferably applied to the blood vessels in spasm, which, in some cases, may be coronary blood vessels. Electrically induced relaxation of blood vessels may be used instead of or in addition to pharmaceuticals. Further, forced relaxation of arteries and veins is useful for treating an acute ischemic event. Typically, the ischemic event causes increased heart rate which further strains ischemic cardiac tissue. By reducing the preload and/or the afterload of the heart, the cardiac demand is reduced, which reduces the oxygen demand of the ischemic tissues and/or allows better perfusion of the ischemic tissues. Additionally or alternatively, the diastole may be extended to aid the perfiision of the cardiac muscle. Extending the diastole may be achieved, for example, by desensitizing at least a portion of the heart, using techniques, such as described in PCT IL97/00012, "Electrical Muscle Controller", filed on January 8, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a gastrointestinal (GI) tract 22 of a patient 20. In<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, local control of the force of<br>
contraction and/or the sensitivity of portions of the GI tract to excitation is achieved by<br>
applying local, non-excitatory electric fields directly to the portion to be controlled. Although<br>
such non-excitatory electric fields do not create a propagating action potential in the controlled<br>
portion, the fields does modify the response of the portion to an artificial or naturally occurring<br>
activation signal, when-it arrives. In particular, the inventors have found that it is possible to<br>
increase or to decrease the force of contraction of a portion of GI tract In addition, it is<br>
possible to desensitize a muscle segment so that it has a reduced reaction or so it does not react<br>
at all to normal amplitudes of activation signals. This desensitization, while reversible, may be<br>
made to last a certain period of time after the removal of the controlling electric field.<br>
Two particular waveforms of non-excitatory electric fields have been foimd to be<br>
beneficial. A first type is a substantially constant field (whose polarity may be occasionally<br>
switched to reduce ionic polarization effects). This field may be applied without any<br>
synchronization to the controlled muscle. However, the inventors have found it useful to stop<br>
the inhibiting field shortly before the activation signal is to arrive at the controlled muscle, so<br>
as to reduce the amplitude of activation signal required to excite the controlled muscle. A<br>
second type of non-excitatory field is a pulse which is applied in synchrony with the arrival of<br>
an activation signal. The pulse is appHed either before, during the arrival of the signal or at a<br>
delay, after its arrival (a long enough delay after activation is equivalent to applying the pulse<br>
before activation). The inventors believe that a non-excitatory electric field applied after the<br>
activation signal tends to increase the force of contraction of the controlled muscle, by<br>
iocreasiag a plateau duration of the muscle contraction. It is hypothesized that a non-excitatory<br>
field applied at a greater delay after the arrival of the activation signal extends the refiractory<br>
period (possibly by hyperpolarizing the muscle cells so that the activation signal does not<br>
cause a depolarization). As a result, at least some of the muscle cells do not respond to the<br>
activation signal and the force of contraction of the muscle is reduced. Thus, the stronger the<br>
non-excitatory signal, the more cells will be hyperpolarized and the lower will be the force of<br>
contraction. In an extreme case, none of the muscle cells will respond to the activation signal<br>
20<br><br>
and the propagation thereof will be inhibited. It is also possible that the non-excitatory field directly reduces affects the force of contraction achieved by a single muscle fiber.<br>
It should be noted that various embodiments of the present invention, as described herein, can be used in conjunction with drug therapies, with a synergistic interaction and/or to allow a reduced dose of drug to produce a desired effect and/or to allow increased dosages of drugs to be used, while limiting their adverse side effects using electrical control. In addition, such electrical control may be practiced together with electrical pacing of the GI tract, including multi-site pacing. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, substantially any activation profile of the GI tract may be achieved by selectively pacing portions of the GI tract and creating desensitized regions between the paced portions, so that an activation signal does not propagate from one paced portion to the next. In addition, such electrical control may also be practiced in combination with electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve.<br>
The term "electric field" has been used to described the non-excitatory field used to control a muscle. The terms "field" and "current pulse" are used interchangeably herein, since, in the body, both are generated when a voltage potential is created between two electrodes. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the field is applied by maintaining a constant current between at least two electrodes. Altematively, a voltage potential may be controlled instead of controlling the current.<br>
Muscle tissue generally adapts to frequent and/or intense activation by increasing its mass. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pacing location is chosen to increase the strength of the muscle at the location. Preferably, the area around the location is desensitized so that the activation signal does not propagate to the rest of the GI tract. Alternatively or additionally, local muscle mass is increased by modifying the force of contraction at the location. Generally, a maximum force of contraction is desired, since it will generally cause the greatest increase in muscle mass.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic drawing of GI tract 22, unfolded for illustrative purposes, for illustrating various preferred embodiments of the present invention. GI tract 22 includes a stomach 24, a duodenum 26, a small intestine 27 and a large intestine 29.<br>
In accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the invention, a portion of the GI tract- is desensitized- and/or electrically isolated fi-om activation signals. Isolation fi'om electrical signals may be achieved by desensitizing tissue which surrounds the portion.<br>
21<br><br>
Ulcers cause inflammation of the GI tract tissue, which inflamed tissue may generate spurious activation signals. Altematively, the inflamed tissue may exhibit a very low threshold of excitability. Both these abnonnalities may cause arrhythmias in stomach 24. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an ulcer 28 is prevented from generating abnormal electrical activity in stomach 24 by desensitizing the tissue surrounding the ulcer. Depending on the exact configuration, ulcer 28 itself may be desensitized. Altematively or additionally, a non-excitatory field will be applied to regions suirounding ulcer 28 to fence it in by non-action potential propagating tissue.<br>
The term fencing, as used herein ,refers to electrically isolating one segment of muscle from other segments, by inhibiting electrical activity in the tissue surrounding the one segment. Thus, an activation signal can neither enter nor leave the one segment Altematively to completely enclosing a segment, fences can be used to channel an activation signal along a desired path by creating fences on either side of the desired path. It should be noted that in channeling, it my be sufficient to significantly reduce the conduction velocity in the tissue where the fence is applied, since this will also modify the propagation vector of the activation front.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tissue desensitization is accomplished by a controller 32, comprising an electrode 30, in contact with the tissue surrounding ulcer 28. Although in this embodiment, controller 32 is shown to be external to stomach 24 and either inside or outside the body, in an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention, controller 32 is implanted inside the stomach, preferably placed by the aid of an endoscope and/or an electrical activity mapping probe, and preferably fixed to the wall of stomach 24, such as by using clips.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, the pacemaker portion of stomach 24, which is usually in the upper portion of stomach 24, is electrically isolated from other portions of the stomach. In Fig. 2 this is accomplished by applying a fence 25 in a band around stomach 24. Altematively or additionally, the rest of stomach 24 may be desensitized. Altematively or additionally, the pacemaker region itself may be desensitized to reduce its excitation rate. Desensitizing stomach 24 is useful for treating nausea, pregnancy related nausea, reflex vomitiag and other stomach conditions characterized by imdesirable activation of the stomach.<br>
A particular example of a condition is in the treatment of obesity, treatable by stomach<br>
desensitization, where delaying emptying of stomach 24 leads to a "full" feeling and reduces<br>
22<br><br>
the consumption of food by the patient. Desensitization of the stomach is preferably applied<br>
together with pacing of the stomach to achieve the desired activation. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, intestines 27 are also controlled in a like manner, especially by blocking electrical<br>
activation signals from stomach 24 from arriving at intestine 27, such as by applying a fence at<br>
duodenum 26 and/or at the antrum. In such examples, controller 32 is preferably controllable<br>
from outside the body, such as by using magnetic reed switches or using RF telemetry. Thus,<br>
controller 32 may activated and deactivated when the patient needs it. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, controller 32 includes sensors which sense various states of GI tract 22,<br>
including, the location of food in a portion thereof and local electrical activity. In such an<br>
embodiment, controller 32 can modify the activation profile of GI tract 22, responsive to the<br>
existence and position of food matter therein.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, a portion of GI tract<br>
22 is desensitized and/or fenced in to allow it to heal. Fig. 2 shows a sutured region 38, and a<br>
controller 40 which applies a pair of fences 42 and 44, so that region 38 will be electrically<br>
isolated and so that local muscle activity will not damage the suture. Region 38 might also<br>
comprise an area from which an ulcer has been recently removed. In a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, such a controller is incorporated in an anastomosis button, which is used to<br>
connect two segments of the intestine. Preferably, such an anastomosis button senses electrical<br>
activity at one side thereof and applied an excitatory signal at an opposite side thereof to assure<br>
a natural contraction of the intestines. Alternatively to completely inhibiting electrical activity<br>
at region 38 it may be desirable to intermittently allow local electrical and/or mechanical<br>
activity. Alternatively or additionally, the local force of contraction may be substantially<br>
reduced so as to reduce local stretching of the sutures. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, electrodes are implanted at the treated region during a laproscopic procedure (or an<br>
open-abdomen procedure). An inhibitory electrical field  is  applied until  it is  deemed<br>
unnecessary by medical opinion.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the electrodes are connected to an external<br>
muscle controller. Once the field is not necessary, the electrodes may be retracted, for<br>
example, using pull-out electrodes, as known in the art, for example, by twisting the electrodes<br>
or by releasing a suture which attaches the electrode to the muscle.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, emptying of a stoma is inhibited by<br>
desensitizing the last few inches of the stoma, until such time as emptying thereof is desired. A<br>
controller for a stoma preferably iacludes electrodes implanted along the last few inches of the<br>
23<br><br>
stoma for applying inhibitory or excitatory pulses. A stoma controller preferably also includes<br>
an external control button which allows the patient to choose between inhibiting the stoma, to<br>
stop exiting of solid wastes and stopping the inhibiting and/or stimulating the stoma, to allow<br>
travel of solid wastes along the stoma.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an electrical controller is used in lieu of a<br>
pharmaceutical to relax the bowels. One example which such a used is desirable is in spastic<br>
constipation, where a vicious cycle of tension-pain-constipation can be broken by relaxing the<br>
tension in the large intestines. A relaxing electrical field may be applied tanscutaneously, by<br>
implanted electrodes or may be applied using an inserted probe.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, pains caused by ischemia of the<br>
intestines are reduced by reducing the contractility of the muscle at the diseased area, thereby<br>
reducing oxygen consumption and/or allowing better perfusion. Preferably, such a controller<br>
includes a pressure sensor and the controller is adjusted to reduce the force of contraction after<br>
a preset local force of contraction is reached.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, acute diarrhea is treated by relaxing<br>
small intestine 27 and/or large intestine 29, so that they do not expel liquids. Such treatment<br>
may be advantageously applied using a probe with electrodes mounted thereon. The electrodes<br>
are preferably spring electrodes which extend (radially) from the probe to assure good contact<br>
with the intestinal wall. This treatment is also useful for patients have a chronic irritated<br>
bowel, such as patients using strong medication and AIDS patients. In patients with a chronic<br>
problem, electrodes are preferably implanted on the outside of portions of the Gl tract.<br>
Another aspect pf the present invention relates to increasing the contractility of at least<br>
a portion of GI tract 22, typically, to compensate for a medical conditions where the<br>
contractility of at least a portion of GI tract 22 is reduced to below normal levels. Such<br>
conditions are typical in older patients. Subnormal contraction forces are also foxmd in patients<br>
in whom a portion of the bowel is denervated, in particular, in patients having Aclazia<br>
(acquired or chronic) and in other disorders such as diffuse systemic sclerosis, diabetic<br>
enteropathy and primary visceral myopathies. In such conditions, the non-excitatory electric<br>
field is preferably applied usiag wire electrodes which are either attached to the inside of GI<br>
tract 22, implanted in the muscle of GI tract 22 itself and/or using electrodes which are<br>
implanted on the outside surface of GI tract 22. Preferably, such electrodes are implanted by<br>
advancing a surgical probe along the outside of GI tract 22 and attaching electrodes at<br>
locations along the outside of the tract. Alternatively, a plurality of encapsulated controllers<br>
24<br><br>
may be implanted at a plurality of points along Gl tract 22. Each encapsulated controller<br>
includes a power source, electrodes and a controller which can be activated by external<br>
command to apply a non-excitatory field. Alternatively, each such encapsulated controller<br>
comprises an induction coil which converts RF radiation, which is transmitted to the coil from<br>
an external source, to a non-excitatory electric field.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to simultaneously applying several<br>
different types of control so as to achieve more precise control of the activation profile of GI<br>
tract 22. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the motility of small intestine 27<br>
and/or large intestine 29 is increased by inhibiting a returning wave. In a normally activated<br>
intestine, there is a forward wave which advances fobd matter in the intestine and also a<br>
returning wave, which causes the food to retreat along the intestine and assists in churning the<br>
food. In this preferred embodiment of the invention, the forward wave is not inhibited and the<br>
returning wave is Inhibited so as to allow greater motility. Preferably, the returning wave is<br>
inhibited at its origin, the end of the intestine, by applying a fence at the location. Fig. 2 shows<br>
a controller 46 which applied a fence 48 at the end of small intestine 27. Preferably, controller<br>
46 uses a sensor 52 and/or a sensor 50 to detect the forward wave and/or the returning wave,<br>
either by their electrical activity or by their mechanical action. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, fence 48 is synchronized to the forward wave and applied only enough time to<br>
block the returning wave. Controller 46 is preferably inserted using an endoscope, preferably,<br>
from inside the small intestine.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, electrical control is<br>
used to advance a stuck bolus 56. To advance bolus 56, electrical control is applied to an area<br>
60, forward of bolus 56, to relax it. An area 58, behind and around bolus 56 is preferably<br>
controlled to increase its contractility. A controller 54 may be permanently implanted at<br>
location 58, if, due to damage to nerve and/or muscle, boluses are expected to be stuck at this<br>
location. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a significant portion of GI tract 22 is<br>
wired. A plurality of sensors are placed along the portion to detect a bolus hi the portion.<br>
Thereafter, the above described method for advancing the bolus is applied at the detected<br>
location. The plurality of sensors may be impedance sensors, which preferably use the same<br>
electrodes as the field applying electrodes.<br>
Fig. 3 is a partial cut-through schematic illustration of a laid-open portion 72 of GI<br>
tract 22, showing the orientation of smooth muscle fibers of the GI.tract. GI tract 22 is<br>
typically composed of three muscle layers, a thin, electrically conducting layer (not shown), a<br>
25<br><br>
inner layer 72 of fibers aligned generally along the length of GI tract 22 and an outer layer 74<br>
of fibers aligned generally perpendicular to the fibers in layer 72. Layer 72 controls local<br>
changes in length of GI tract 22, while layer 74 controls local changes in diameter of GI tract<br>
22.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a non-excitatory electrical field is<br>
selectively applied either to layer 72 or to layer 74, to either increase or decrease the local<br>
force of contraction. This selectivity may be achieved by aligning the direction of the electric<br>
field either in parallel to fibers in layer 72 or in parallel to fibers in layer 74. It should be noted<br>
that this type of selectivity is not possible when using an excitatory electric field, since such a<br>
field excites both layers 72 and 74.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a net electrode 76, having a plurality of<br>
individual electrodes 78, is used to affect this selectivity. If the net is placed so that its main<br>
axes are parallel to the fiber directions, an electrical field, having a direction parallel to one of<br>
the layers may be generated by choosing selected ones of electrodes 78. Ones of electrodes 78<br>
can also be selected to apply a field which is diagonal to fibers in both layers. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, electrodes 78 are alternatively electrified, so that electric fields iti both directions<br>
are alternatively applied. In particular, an inhibitory field may be applied in one direction<br>
while a contractility increasing field may be applied in the perpendicular direction. As can be<br>
appreciated, electrodes 78 may also be used to supply a pacing signal. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, electrodes 78 are also used to sense local electrical activity so as<br>
to better time the non-excitatory field.<br>
Another type of electrode which is preferred for use in controlling smooth muscle, is an<br>
elongated electrode which is useful for applying an inhibiting electrical field, to create a fence.<br>
The propagation of an activation signal is most advantageously controlled (increased or<br>
decreased) by applying an electric field which is parallel to the fibers in the innermost layer of<br>
muscle, since that muscle layer conducts the activation signal. The propagation of the<br>
activation signal may be increased by applying a contractility enhancing electric field to the<br>
inner layer. Another method of selectively applying an electric field to only one layer is to<br>
insert the electrodes into the muscle, between the layers, so that substantially only one layer is<br>
inside the field.<br>
Various apparatus for and methodologies for applying a non-excitatory electric field to<br>
cardiac muscle are described in six PCT applications, filed by applicant New Technologies<br>
(SA-YSY) Ltd.  et al., in the Israel receiving office: PCT application PCT/IL97/00012,<br>
26<br><br>
"Electrical Muscle Controller", filed January 8, 1997, and five PCT applications filed on My<br>
9,  1997: PCT/IL97/00231, "Apparatus and Methods for Controlling the Contractility of<br>
Muscles",   PCT/IL97/00232, "Drug-Device Combination for Controlling the Contractility of<br>
Muscles", PCT/IL97/00233, "Fencing of Cardiac Muscle", PCT/IL97/00235 "Cardiac Output<br>
Controller" and PCT/IL97/00236, "Cardiac Output Enhanced Pacemaker", the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. In particular, these PCT applications describe<br>
various waveforms which may be used for applying non-excitatory electric fields, including,<br>
DC fields, AC fields, unipolar and bipolar fields and combinations of such fields. Further,<br>
PCT/IL97/00012 also describes the possibility of using light radiation and RF radiation to<br>
affect calcium transfer in cardiac muscle cells and thereby affect their force of contraction.<br>
These apparatus may be adapted, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention to supply non-excitatory electric fields to smooth muscles.<br>
When adapting the apparatus described herein to a particular physiology, it is expected<br>
that the amplitudes, delays and frequencies of the non-excitatory may need to be adapted. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the apparatus is programmable by RF radiation. Thus,<br>
- it can be implanted and different sets of pulse parameters may be tested to determine an<br>
optimal set. Additionally, the parameters may need to be adjusted after a time, due to<br>
adaptation of the controlled muscle, changes in impedance of the electrodes or to change the<br>
fimction of the controller.<br>
As will be appreciated, some patients will require only a short course of treatment,<br>
while other patients will reqtaire a longer course, in some cases, a permanent treatment will be<br>
required. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, apparatus, as described herein is adapted<br>
to be implanted in the body, Altematively, such apparatus is adapted to be inserted in the body,<br>
for a .shorter period of time, such as under a month. This adaptation may provide for using<br>
different materials for the electrodes and for a different tradeoff between battery life and<br>
degree of control. Altematively, such apparatus is adapted to be external to the body, either<br>
carried by the patient or free-standing. Preferably, at least the electrodes are implanted in the<br>
body or inserted in a body lumen.<br>
It should also be noted that the activity of smooth muscles is also modified by their<br>
tension. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a controller for smooth muscle includes<br>
sensors which measure the tension in the" muscle and modifies the applied field responsive to<br>
the measured tension. Preferably, the tension is measured on the outside of the lumen of the<br>
smooth muscle. Altematively or additionally, the tension is measured inside the lumen formed<br>
27<br><br>
by the smooth muscle. Altematively or additionally, the tension is measured inside the smooth muscle.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the orientation and polarity of the electric field relative to the muscle fibers are also varied to determine an optimal orientation and/or polarity which effect the desired control on the muscle. It should be noted that the two perpendicular muscle layers have different characteristics, such as resting tension, and, probably, a different response to the non-excitatory field. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, various orientations of the electric field to the muscle fibers, such as 0°, 5°, 10°, 30° and 45°, are tested without moving the electrodes. This is preferably achieved using a net-type electrode, where each junction of the net may be individually electrified. Thus substantially any effective field direction and polarity may be tested without moving the electrodes. Such a net electrode can also be used as a sensor net to more precisely determine the propagation direction of an activation front, as this propagation direction will generally be perpendicular to iso-chronal lines which mark equal activation times. In addition, changes in the activation profile, such as the effect of the controlling fields and/or arrhythmias can be detected firom changes in the electrical signals sensed at the plurality of junctions of the net. lii addition, mechanical activity may be localized by impedance measurement between individual ones of the jimctions, either neighboring junctions, in which case characteristics of the muscle are measured or junctions which are on opposite sides of the smooth muscle, ha which case occupancy of the Gl tract may be determined.<br>
It should be noted that the fi-equency of contraction of smooth muscle is usually much lower than cardiac muscle, enabling the use of simpler electronics and slower-responding power sources, for controlling smooth muscle. Furtheimore, the propagation time along smooth muscle is usually much slower than for cardiac muscle. As a result, several seconds may pass between the activation time at one location and the activation time at a second location. Thus, to ensure a proper delay between local activation and local application of a non-excitatory field, local determination of activation time is especially preferred for smooth muscle control. Such local determination is preferably performed by local sensing, however, in other preferred embodiment of the invention, the local activation time is calculated using an estimated propagation velocity.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates'a method of advancing a colonoscope 90 using local control of a portion 92 of GI tract 22. As minimally invasive procedures gain acceptance, periodic<br>
28<br><br>
examination of the large intestine, using a colonoscope and of the small intestine, using an<br>
endoscope are becoming more common. In colon examination, the colonoscope is inserted into<br>
the anus and advanced along the colon. Periodically, the advance is stopped and the colon,<br>
surrounding  the tip of the colonoscope, is inflated using air, so as to aid the advance of the<br>
colonoscope and to aid the examination of the colon wall. Drugs which relax the colon are<br>
usually administered to the patient prior to the examination.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a colonoscope 90 has a<br>
plurality of electrodes 94 at least at its tip. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, these<br>
electrodes are used to apply a relaxing electric field to the colon and thus, reduce the air<br>
pressure required to inflate it. In addition, such relaxing reduces the force required to advance<br>
the colonoscope, thereby reducing the danger of perforation. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the electrodes are extendible from the tip of colonoscope 90 so that they can engage<br>
colon portion 92 even when it is inflated. Preferably, the electrodes can be temporarily hooked<br>
onto colon portion 92.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, electrodes 94 are<br>
electrified to as to cause colon portion 92 itself to advance or to aid in the advance, of<br>
colonoscope 90. This advance may be achieved in one of two ways, either by blocking the<br>
forward wave and allowing the returning wave to advance colonoscope 90 or by selectively<br>
exciting muscles fibers in layers 72 and 74 (Fig. 3) so as to advance the colonoscope. One<br>
regimen of selective excitation includes: controlling layer 74 to more firmly grasp colonoscope<br>
90 at its tip and exciting layer 72 to advance colonoscope 92. The order of excitation and the<br>
point from which the colon is excited, will, to a great measure,  determine the direction of<br>
transport of colonoscope '92. Preferably, additional electrodes along colonoscope 90 (not<br>
shown) are used either to perform the same advancing action or to relax layer 74 along the<br>
length of colonoscope 92, to aid its advance. Selective excitation of a particular orientation of<br>
muscle fibers may be achieved by first inhibiting the other orientation of muscle fibers and<br>
then applying an excitatory stimulus. Retracting the colonoscope may be assisted by pacing<br>
colon potion 92 at the tip of colonoscope 90, so as to use the natural rhythm of colon portion<br>
92 to retract colonoscope 90.<br>
As can be appreciated, what has been described for a colonoscope applies equally to an<br>
endoscope,   especially  for retracting  it.  In  a preferred  embodiment  of the  invention,<br>
colonoscope 90 includes electrodes which apply a fencing field which blocks any local<br>
excitations from propagating to the rest of GI tract 22.<br>
29<br><br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, an endoscope<br>
which is used for entry into the bile duct, includes electrodes at its tip to apply a relaxing<br>
electric field, so as to enlarge the sphincter from the bile duct into the intestines. Preferably,<br>
such enlargement, when applied by a device which does not obstruct the bile duct, is used in<br>
conjunction with treatments for destroying gall bladder stones, to aid the exit of broken<br>
fragments of stone into the intestines. Alternatively, such a device is used to excite and/or <br>
increase the contractility of the bile duct to aid in the transport of such stones and/or to aid in<br>
its normal functioning. A non-obstructing device may be implanted externally to the gall<br>
bladder duct, such as inside small intestine 27 and only the leads for the electrodes need be in<br>
the duct. Alternatively, also the leads are implanted external to the duct.<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic illustration of a capsule 102 for treatment of a hemorrhoid 100 in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It has recently been<br>
determined that a major cause of hemorrhoids and a major factor in the non-healing of<br>
hemorrhoids and anal fissures is increased tension in the lower colon. The increased tension<br>
reduces the flow of blood, delaying healing and, at the same time, causing pain. It should be<br>
noted that tension in the lower part of the colon blocks blood from the rectal area, i.e., at some<br>
distance thereof. Topically applied Nitroglycerin (both at the hemorrhoids and inside the<br>
colon) has been suggested for reducing the tension in the lower colon. However, this drug has<br>
several side effects, such as dizziness. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, capsule 102 is inserted into the lower colon, where it applies relaxing electric fields,<br>
which either completely inhibit local contraction or at least, reduce it Capsule 102 preferably<br>
includes a plurality of electrodes 104, a power supply 106 for electriiying the electrodes and,<br>
preferably, an attachment 110 for easy removal of capsule 102. Preferably, capsule 102 senses,<br>
using a pressure transducer (not shown) abnormal pressures ia the colon and applies a relaxing<br>
electrical field only at those times or after such abnormal pressure has continued for a<br>
significant period of time. Alternatively or additionally, a tension sensor and/or an electrical<br>
activity sensor are used to sense the local activity of the colon.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, suitable for female patients, capsule 102 is<br>
adapted to be inserted into a vagina and apply an electric field which affects the lower colon.<br>
Preferably, electrodes 104 are arranged so that the field is applied asymmetrically and mostiy<br>
in the direction of the colon, since it is generally undesirable to effect a relaxing field on the<br>
muscles of the bladder or on the rectal sphincter. Thus, electrodes 104 are preferably arranged<br>
only on one side of capsule 102. Capsule 102 preferably includes a marking so that the patient<br>
30<br><br>
will insert it in the proper orientation. Alternatively to using a capsule, a controller 108 may be implanted outside the colon.<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram of a uterus 120, illustrating applying local inhibitory electric fields to small portions of thereof Undesirable electrical activity in the uterus may induce premature labor in women. It is hypothesized that such undesirable electrical activity may, in many cases be cause by small regions of tissue, for example, near fibroids or myomas, where the stretching of the uterus may be maximal, or at inflamed locations. Unlike the heart, it may not be desirable to ablate portions of the uterus, as this may reduce the fertility and/or may irreversibly damage the uterus. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, electrical excitation firom a fibroid 122 is blocked from propagating by fencing the fibroid or by desensitizing fibroid 122 and tissue surrounding it. Fig. 6 shows a controller 124 which administers such non-excitatory electrical fields using a plurality of electrodes 126. Preferably controller 124 is external to uterus 120, but it is preferably implanted inside, the body. However, in other embodiments of the invention, only electrodes 126 of controller 124 are inserted in the body, for example, using a laproscopic procedxn-e. Electrodes which need to be inserted into the back of the uterus may be inserted through the intestines.<br>
Areas of the uterus which might cause such premature electrical activity may include,' inflamed tissue, scar tissue, fibroids and malformed portions of the uterus. These types of tissue may be detected either by visual inspection (using a hysteroscope) or, preferably, using an electrical mapping probe, as known in the art of electrophysiology. Such mapping may also be performed during pregnancy, in which case the electrodes may be implanted from inside the uterus, during, or shortly after the mapping procedure. The controller will then preferably be external to the body, or possibly, in the vagina.<br>
It has been suggested that there is a small region of the uterus, shown in Fig. 6 as a region 128, which generates a pacing signal for the entire uterus, at least during labor. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, labor is delayed by selectively inhibiting this area or by fencing it in, using non-excitatory electrical fields.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to providing a more exact control over the process of labor than is possible using drugs. Several situations, where the response time of drugs is not sufficient, the side effects too great or proper dosage is difficult to establish, include: <br>
(a) stopping premature labor;<br>
31<br><br>
(b)	stopping a labor where a cesarean section is indicated;<br>
(c)	situations where fine control of the force of contraction of the uterus is required;<br>
(d)	assisting a labor which is not advancing properly; and<br>
(e)	stopping labor from ever starting, where it is contra-indicated.<br>
(f)	dictating a preferred contraction profile during labor.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a implantable multi-site stimulator/inhibitor 130, attached to uterus<br>
120, in accordance with a referred embodiment of the invention. Controller 130 includes a<br>
plurality of electrodes 132, preferably arranged to cover substantially all of uterus 120. These<br>
electrodes may be attached to the outside of uterus 120, for example duiring a laproscopic<br>
procedure. Alternatively electrodes 132 are attached to the inside of uterus 120, such as by an<br>
hysteroscopic procedure. Alternatively, these electrodes may be external to the body, such as<br>
on the skin, and possible, inserted in the intestines adjacent the uterus. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, electrodes 132 are implanted prior to the pregnancy, such as<br>
during a previous cesarean section and/or using a laproscopic procedure. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, electrodes to control smooth muscle are implanted in the blood vessels which<br>
adjacent the smooth muscle, such as the vessels which supply the smooth muscle. Preferably,<br>
the electrification of individual ones of electrodes 132 is timed to local electrical activity.<br>
Electrodes 132 can also be used to provide a stimulating signal, which will both induce and<br>
sustain labor.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, multi-site pacing, is<br>
used to dictate a preferred activation (contraction) to the uterus. Preferably, multi-site pacing is<br>
complemented by local control of force of contraction (usually increase). Alternatively or<br>
additionally, fences are applied to the uterus, to channels the activation signals in a desired<br>
manner. It should be noted that fencing may be applied by itself, in combination with a single<br>
pacing location of in combination with multiple activation locations, in various preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, labor is advanced and/or<br>
assisted by increasing the force of contraction. The increase in the force of contraction causes a<br>
positive feedback effect which further increases the force of contraction. An increase in the<br>
force of contraction is also useful for assisting artificial abortions. In other situations, the force<br>
of contraction may need to be reduced or labor may have to be stopped completely, such as in<br>
cases of fetal distress or where there is danger of a rupture of the uterus, in which cases a<br>
cesarean section is to be performed. In cases of malformed or heavily scarred uteruses and in<br>
32<br><br>
patients having a previous history of premature labor, controller 130 is preferably used to stop<br>
labor from ever occurring. Preferably, electrodes 132 are electrified to produce an inhibiting<br>
electrical field. Preferably, they are,electrified only when controller 130 detects local electrical<br>
activity. Alternatively or additionally electrodes 132 are electrified responsive to the frequency<br>
of contraction of uterus 120.<br>
"In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the invention, a birth canal 134<br>
and/or a cervix of uterus 120 is relaxed using a locally applied electric field, to aid in exiting of<br>
a baby therethrough. Alternatively, the force of contraction of the birth canal is increased prior<br>
to labor, to avoid a miscarriage. Alternatively or additionally, the muscles of the birth canal are<br>
also stimulated using excitatory signals to cause their contraction and avoid a miscarriage.<br>
It should be appreciated that uterus 120 undergoes very significant changes in size over<br>
the course of a pregnancy. Thus, the leads of electrodes 132 are preferably made very flexible<br>
and elastic. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the leads are formed of a<br>
coiled wire, so that if the lead is stretched, the coil tightens, rather than break the wire.<br>
Preferably, the coil is wound about a flexible core. Preferably, the leads of electrodes 132<br>
include weakened points, such that if strain of above a predetermined value is applied to the<br>
lead it will break at one of the preselected points, rather than damage tissue structures adjacent<br>
the lead.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each of electrodes 132 comprises an<br>
encapsulated power supply and controller 130 coordinates the individual electrodes using<br>
wireless cormnunication. Thus, electrodes 132 do not need to be interconnected by wires.<br>
Alternatively, electrodes 132 are coordinate their electrification using techniques well known<br>
in the art of distributed computing and without a central  controller.  Alternatively to<br>
synchronizing their activity, each of electrodes 132 operates responsive to local activity.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a balloon-type insert 140 for uterus 120, for controlling cramps. Insert<br>
140 comprises a plurality of electrodes 142, disposed on the outside of the device, which<br>
electrodes are electrified by a power source 144. Insert 140 is preferably inflatable to assure<br>
better contact with the inner wall of uterus 120. In a preferred mode of operation, various ones<br>
of electrodes 142 function as electrical activity sensors. Once such electrical activity is sensed,<br>
an inhibiting field is applied at those locations to prevent the future occurrence of electrical<br>
activation and/or to prevent its propagation. Alternatively, such a device continuously applies<br>
an inhibitory electrical field. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the inhibitory<br>
electrical field is applied between electrodes 142 and an external electrode which is placed on<br>
33<br><br>
the abdomen and/or on the back. Although point electrodes are shown in the figure, it should be appreciated that other forms of electrodes, such as elongated electrodes may also be used. Preferably, the device is removed from the body when cramps are not expected.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a controller 150 which modifies the output of a gland, such as a pancreas       152. In some glands, such as pancreas 152, execration of hormones into a blood vessel 154 is meditated by electrical excitation of the hormone producing cells (beta islet cells in the pancreas). The electrical excitation, as in many smooth muscles, is initiated by chemical signals. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the hormone execrating cells are desensitized so that they do not respond to these chemical signals, or, if some of the cells do respond, these cells cannot generate a propagating activation signal, since the surrounding cells are electrically deactivated. Thus, the amount of execrated hormone is reduced. This method is especially useful in diseases, such as tumors, where a gland over produces its hormone.<br>
Controller 150 preferably includes an electrode 158 and, preferably, a second electrode 156 so as to create an electric field which inhibits or reduces the electrical activity of the hormone producing cells. The casing of controller 150 may be used as the second electrode, in this and in other of the above described preferred embodiments. As can be appreciated, the levels of hormone in the blood and the electrical activity of the hormone producing cells is rather difficult to detect using current technology. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, a substantially constant inhibitory electrical field is applied. Preferably, the polarity of the field is changed periodically, so as to prevent ionic-meditated damage and the ionization of electrodes, 156 and 158. Alternatively, controller 150 may measure local electrical activity, hormone levels or it may measure a bodily indicator, such as glucose level, which is correlated with the hormone level and apply a voltage to electrodes 156 and 158, as indicated.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to controlling blood pressure and/or other circxalatory parameters such as the load on a heart. Preferably, the control is exerted in conjunction with the use of a cardiac controller, such as described in the above referenced PCT applications. Fig. 10 illustrates a blood pressure and/or heart load controller 160, attached to major blood vessels, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. A heart 162 receives blood from an abdominal vena cava 168 and pumps it to anaorta 164 and from there to an abdominal aorta 166. In the event of a spasm in aorta 164, it greatly constricts, increasing the afterload on the heart. In many cases this types of spasm will cause dizziness. In patients<br>
34<br><br>
having constricted coronary arteries, the increased cardiac demand may also cause a painful episode of angina pectoris.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the afterload of heart 162 is momentarily reduced by relaxing large arteries. Alternatively or additionally, the preload of heart 162 is momentarily reduced by relaxing large veins. Reducing either the preload and/or the afterload, reduces the work demanded from heart 162 and will, in many cases, stop the pain of angina pectoris. Alternatively or additionaOy, the walls of the large blood vessels are relaxed in order to lower the blood pressure, during an acute episode of high blood pressure. Alternatively, the blood vessels may be constricted, such as during an acute episode of low blood pressure. Reducing the load on heart 162 is especially beneficial if practiced while extending the diastole of the left ventricle of heart 162, such as by extending the refractory periods of muscle cells therein, for example, as described in the above mentioned PCX applications.<br>
The choice of the particular blood vessel to relax depends, inter alia, on the type of load which is desirable to reduce, on whether the hypertension is ptilmonary or systemic and, in case of a spasm, if the vessel having a spasm has implanted electrodes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vessel in spasm is detected using by measuring changes in the impedance between the electrodes surrounding the blood vessel. Alternatively, rather than determining which vessel is in spasm, all wired blood vessels are relaxed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, controller 160 includes a pair of electrodes 170 and 172 for controlling abdominal vena cava 168. Alternatively or additionally, controller 160  includes  a pair  of electrodes   174  and  176 for  controlling the  abdominal  aorta. Alternatively or additionally, controller 160 includes a pair of electrode 178 and 180 for controlling the aorta, preferably, at or about the aortic arch- In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the electrodes are net-type electrodes, since the muscle fibers in blood vessels are mostly oriented perpendicular to the direction of flow of blood and a field perpendicular to the blood flow direction is desirable. Alternatively, the electrodes are elongated electrodes, arranged parallel to the blood flow, to apply a field perpendicular to the blood flow, between pairs of electrodes. Preferably, controller 160 is externally controllable, so that a patient can activate it when he feels pain and/or dizziness. Alternatively or additionally, controller 160 includes a blood pressure sensor (not shown), for automated closed loop blood pressure<br>
control. Alternatively or additionally, controller 160 includes an ECG sensor or a blood flow<br>
35<br><br>
sensor, so that the application of the fields to the vascular system may be synchronized to the cardiac rhythm. Preferably, controller 160 includes a fail-safe cutoff which prevents the patient from reducing or increasing the blood pressure beyond acceptable limits.<br>
Figs. 11-16 describe experiments which show that the force of contraction of a smooth muscle can be increased or decreased by application of non-excitatory electric fields directly to the muscle.<br>
Male, New Zealand White rabbits (l-2Kg body weight) were dissected and various portions of their Gl tract were removed and used for the following experiments. The animals were anesthetized using pentobarbitone (Ceva, France), 60 mg/Kg body weight, by IV. The abdominal wall was opened to expose the abdominal viscera. Required portions of the GI tract were removed and placed in a cold (4 °C) oxygenated (95/5 O2/CO2) Krebs-Heseleit solution, containing (in mM): KCl 4.5, NaCl 118, NaHCO3 24, MgS04 1.19. KH2PO4 LIS, Glucose 11 and CaCl2 2.52). The removed portions were then further dissected in a dissection chamber (Hugo Sachs Electronik (HSE), Gernmny) to produce a single strip of GI muscle which was then placed in an organ bath, llie organ bath is a type 813 (I-18E) by HSE and it includes a temperature controller type 319 and a force transducer type F30 with a 660 type amplifier. The elapsed time for the removal procedure is about 3-5 minutes.<br>
Fig. 11 is a schematic illustration of an experimental setup used to detennine the effects of a non-excitatory field on smooth muscle cells. A GI muscle portion 200 is fixed in an organ bath chamber, one end is fixed to the chamber using a plastic clip, while the other end is hooked to a pressure transducer 202. The length of the GI muscle is adjusted to allow maximal isometric force. The organ bath is temperature controlled and the GI muscle is continuously perfused (7-12 ml/min) with the above described oxygenated solution, maintained at about 36.10C. The muscle was allowed to remain in the organ bath for a 30 minutes equilibrium period prior to experimentation.<br>
The organ bath includes two Ag-AgCI electrodes 206 which were used to apply a pacing pulse, where required by the experimental protocol. These electrodes were chlorodized before each experiment. The pacing stimuli was provided by a constant current source. The pacing waveform was a square wave pulse, A non-excitatory electric field was applied using carbon electrodes 208 (shaped from carbon rods provided by Goodfellow, UK) which were placed about 2-3 millimeters apart The electrodes were electrified by a constant current source 210. The two constant current sources were home made current sources whose current level<br>
36<br><br>
was modified by computer control. The output of these current sources was continuously monitored to verify that a constant current was produced. The entire experiment was controlled by a computer 212 and the data was acquired using dedicated data acquisition circuits, such as a PCI-MIO-16XE50 or an AT-MIO-16E-2 (National Instmment, USA). The organ bath was     placed on an anti-vibratloB table (TMC, USA). Both the pacing current and the non-excitatory current were constant current pulses. The amplitude of the pacing is different between the following experiments, in the main pat, to counteract polarization of the electrodes. The delay of the non-excitatory field (NT current) is from the start of the pacing signal.<br>
Figs. 12-17 show experimental results using a section of GI tract from the Jejunum. The fields were applied and the transducer measured force were approximately along the direction of the Gl tract. As described above, variations in the orientation can change the effect of the non-excitatory pulse. The polarity of the field was sometimes selected to cause a force increasing effect and sometimes to produce a force decreasing effect.<br>
Fig. 12 is a graph of experimental results showing an increase in the force of contraction of a smooth muscle, as a result of the application of a non-excitatory electric field in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The non-excitatory field is shown as a full bar marked "NT."<br>
In this experiment, the pacing was 0.15 Hz, 30ms duration and 3mA current The non-excitatory field was a 200 ms current pulse at lOmA applied at a delay  of 50ms after the pacing. As seen in Fig. 12, an increase of about 300% in the force of contraction was achieved. Figs. 13-16 are graph of experimental results showing a significant decrease in the force of contraction of a smooth muscle, as a result of the application of a non-excitatory electric field in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
In Fig. 13, a 70% reduction in force of contraction was achieved. The pacing was the same as in Fig. 12, while the non-excitatory pulse was applied for lOOms, at a lOOms delay after the pacing and at 10mA. It should be noted that the effect of the non-excitatory field lasted for a while after the removal thereof. In addition, the non-excitatory field also reduced the base tone of the muscle, i.e., it relaxed it.<br>
In Fig. 14, a substantial reduction in force of contraction was achieved. The pacing was faster than in Figs. 12 and 13: 0.25 Hz, 30ms duration and lOnaA amplitude. The non-excitatory pulse was applied for 50ms, at a 50ms delay after the pacing and at a 10mA amplitude. In this experiment too, a reduction in muscle tone is observed.<br>
37<br><br>
In Fig. 15, a substantial reduction in force of contractios was achieved. The pacing<br>
was different from that of Fig. 14: 0.25 Hz, 30ms duration and 3mA amplitude. The non-<br>
excitatory pulse was applied for 60ms, at a 200ms delay after the pacing and at 10mA. In this<br>
experiment too, a reduction ia muscle tone is observed,<br>
	In Fig. 16, a substantial  reduction in force of contraction was achieved. The pacing<br>
was similar to that of Figs. 12 and 13: 0.15 Hz, 30ms duration and 3mA amplitude. The non-excitatory pulse was applied for lOOms, at a 50ms delay aiter the pacing and at lOmA. In this experiment too, a reduction in muscle tone is observed.<br>
In Fig. 17, a substantial reduction in force of cdntraction was achieved using a substantially constant non-excitatory field. The pacing was 0.25 Hz, 2ms duration and 5mA amplitude. The non-excitatory pulse was applied for 3990ms, at a 5ms delay after the pacing and at an amplitude of 15mA, A nearly complete blockage of contraction is observed of In this experiment too, a reduction in muscle tone is observed.<br>
Fig. 18 is a graph of experimental results showing an increase in the force of contraction of a smooth muscle of a urine bladder, as a result of the application of a non-excitatory electric field, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The bladder segment was prepared as described above. It was paced at 0.2 Hz, 30ms duration and 6mA amplitude. The non-excitatory field was a 60ms duration pulse applied at a 30ms delay after pacing and having an amplitude of lOmA. It should be noted that the resting tension of the bladder segment also iacreased as a result of applying the non-excitatory field.<br>
Fig. 19 is a graph of experimental results showing an increase in the force of contraction of a smooth, muscle of a rabbit uterus, as a result of the application of a non-excitatory electric field, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The uterus segment was prepared as described above. The muscle segment was not artificially paced, it was self paced. The non-excitatory field was a pulse of 20ms duration, lOmA amplitude and applied at 0-2 Hz. It should be noted that not only was the force of contraction significantly reduced, after about 30 seconds of application of the non-excitatory field, the contraction of the tissue was apparently completely inhibited. The effects of the field also lasted for a short time after the removal thereof<br>
