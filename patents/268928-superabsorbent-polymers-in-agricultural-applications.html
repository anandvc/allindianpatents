				<td>SUPERABSORBENT POLYMERS IN AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a superabsorbent polymer product and to<br>
methods of making and applying the superabsorbent polymer product.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are materials that imbibe or absorb at<br>
least 10 times their own weight in aqueous fluid and that retain the imbibed or<br>
absorbed aqueous fluid under moderate pressure. The imbibed or absorbed<br>
aqueous fluid is taken into the molecular structure of the SAP rather then being<br>
contained in pores from which the fluid could be eliminated by squeezing. Some<br>
SAPs can absorb up to 1,000 times their weight in aqueous fluid.<br>
[0003] One method of producing a SAP for use in agricultural applications<br>
involves graft polymerizing acrylonitrile onto a starch in the presence of an initiator,<br>
such as a eerie (+4) salt, to form a starch graft copolymer, and saponifying the nitrile<br>
groups with an alkali metal to form a saponificate having alkali carboxylate and<br>
carboxamide groups.<br>
[0004] Saponification, however, may require expensive machinery and generates<br>
ammonia, which can be corrosive, costly to remove, and expensive to dispose of.<br>
Also, potassium hydroxide (KOH) added during saponification makes the saponified<br>
starch graft copolymer mixture basic. Acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,<br>
sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid, is added to the mixture in order to neutralize the pH<br>
of the starch graft copolymer mixture. If the amount of acid that must be added is<br>
significant, the absorbency of the SAP is reduced. The resulting waste solutions<br>
may also be expensive to dispose of because they include potassium and<br>
ammonium salts and other extraneous salts. Furthermore, acrylonitrile may be<br>
hazardous and expensive to dispose of.<br>
Brief Summary<br>
[0005] The present disclosure presents superabsorbent polymer (SAP) products<br>
for use in agricultural applications, methods of producing SAP products and methods<br>
of use.<br>
[0006] Certain methods of producing SAP products disclosed do not require the<br>
use of acrylonitrile as a monomer and does not require the step of saponification.<br>
According to one embodiment, the method involves (1) graft polymerizing a<br>
monomer, other than acrylonitrile, onto a starch in the presence of an initiator to form<br>
a starch graft copolymer; (2) cross-linking the starch graft copolymer, for example, by<br>
adding a cross-linking agent, such as methylene bis-acrylamide; and (3) isolating the<br>
starch graft copolymer. The disclosed method may also include adjusting the pH of<br>
the cross-linked starch graft copolymer. Moreover, the method may further include<br>
drying the starch graft copolymer, to yield particles that are superabsorbent. The<br>
isolation of particles of superabsorbent polymer product may occur by various<br>
methods, including, but not limited to, granularization, extrusion, and pelletization.<br>
[0007] Certain methods of increasing crop production using a SAP produced by<br>
the above-described method are disclosed. One method involves applying the SAP<br>
directly to the soil. A second method involves coating a root or seed with the SAP.<br>
A third method involves forming a slurry of SAP and water (or another liquid) and<br>
applying the resulting slurry to a plant, root, seed, seedling, or directly to soil into<br>
which one of a plant, root, seed, or seedling will be planted.<br>
[0008] Certain SAP products for use in agricultural applications are also<br>
disclosed. The SAP product may include a polysaccharide, such as starch or<br>
cellulose, which has a monomer graft polymerized thereto. The monomer may be,<br>
for example, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. The monomer may also be acrylamide<br>
or methacrylamide. A sulfonic acid, such as 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic<br>
acid (AMPS) and vinyl sulfonic acid may also suffice. Moreover, acrylates, such as<br>
ethyl acrylate and potassium acrylate may also be used. Derivatives and mixtures of<br>
the above-listed monomers may also be desirable.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0012] Those skilled in the art will recognize that the methods and compositions<br>
disclosed herein may be practiced without one or more of the specific details<br>
described, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In some cases, wellknown<br>
materials, components or method steps are not shown or described in detail.<br>
Furthermore, the described method steps, compositions, etc., may be combined in<br>
any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. It will also be readily understood<br>
that the methods and compositions of the embodiments as generally described<br>
herein could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations.<br>
[0013] The order of the steps or actions of the methods described in connection<br>
with the embodiments disclosed may be changed as would be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art. Thus, any order in the detailed description is for illustrative<br>
purposes only and is not meant to imply a required order.<br>
[0014] One embodiment of a method of making a superabsorbent polymer (SAP)<br>
for use in large-scale agricultural applications comprises (1) graft polymerizing a<br>
monomer onto a starch in the presence of an initiator to form a starch graft<br>
copolymer; (2) cross-linking the starch graft copolymer, for example, by adding a<br>
cross-linking agent, such as methylene bis-acrylamide to cross-link the starch graft<br>
copolymer; (3) adjusting the pH of the cross-linked starch graft copolymer, such as<br>
neutralization; (4) isolating the cross-linked starch graft copolymer; and (5) drying the<br>
cross-linked starch graft copolymer.<br>
[0015] Exemplary monomers for use in the above-described method include<br>
acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Exemplary monomers may also include acrylamide<br>
or methacrylamide. Sulfonic acids, such as 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic<br>
acid (AMPS) and vinyl sulfonic acid may also be used. Moreover, acrylates, such as<br>
ethyl acrylate and potassium acrylate may also be used. Derivatives and mixtures of<br>
the above-listed monomers may also be desirable.<br>
[0016] For example, in some applications it may be desirable to use acrylic acid<br>
as the monomer. In other applications it may be desirable to use a mixture of acrylic<br>
acid and acrylamide to be graft polymerized onto a starch. In other alternative<br>
applications, it may be desirable to use 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic acid.<br>
10017j in applications using acrylic acid, the addition of acrylamide thereto helps<br>
induce graft polymerization and adds to absorbency of the SAP. By way of example,<br>
the ratio by weight of acrylic acid to acrylamide may be about 2:1. Alternatively, the<br>
ratio of acrylic acid to acrylamide may also range up to a ratio of 9:1 and beyond.<br>
Because acrylamide is considered a neurotoxin, it may be desirable to reduce the<br>
relative amount of acrylamide to acrylic acid, while using enough to help induce graft<br>
polymerization of acrylic acid.<br>
[0018] In alternative applications, acrylic acid may graft polymerize onto a starch<br>
or other polysaccharide without the assistance of acrylamide. For example, acrylic<br>
acid may polymerize when placed under heat and/or pressure. Polymerization<br>
without the addition of acrylamide may be accomplished, for example, in a heated<br>
screw extruder, such as a single screw or a double screw.<br>
[0019] The starches used in the above-described method include starches, flours,<br>
and meals. More specifically, exemplary starches include native starches (e.g., corn<br>
starch (Pure Food Powder, manufactured by A.E. Staley), waxy maize starch (Waxy<br>
7350, manufactured by A.E. Staley), wheat starch (Midsol 50, manufactured by<br>
Midwest Grain Products), potato starch (Avebe, manufactured by A.E. Staley)),<br>
dextrin starches (e.g., Stadex 9, manufactured by A.E. Staley), dextran starches<br>
(e.g., Grade 2P, manufactured by Pharmachem Corp.), corn meal, peeled yucca<br>
root, unpeeled yucca root, oat flour, banana flour, and tapioca flour. The starch may<br>
be gelatinized to provide optimal absorbency. An exemplary starch is gelatinized<br>
cornstarch. Furthermore, according to one embodiment, the weight ratio of the<br>
starch to the monomer is in the range of between about 1:1 and about 1:6.<br>
[0020] In alternative embodiments, other polysaccharides, such as cellulose, may<br>
be used instead of starch. Accordingly, the monomers heretofore described may be<br>
graft polymerized onto cellulose for purposes of agricultural applications.<br>
[0021] The monomer may be graft polymerized onto a starch in the presence of<br>
an initiator. Exemplary initiators for use in the above-described method include:<br>
cerium (+4) salts, such as eerie ammonium nitrate; ammonium persulfate; sodium<br>
persulfate; potassium persulfate; ferrous peroxide; ferrous ammonium sulfatehydrogen<br>
peroxide; L-ascorbic acid; and potassium permanganate-ascorbic acid.<br>
Other suitable initiators known to those skilled in the art may be used, such as<br>
alternative persulfates and peroxides, as well as vanadium, manganese, etc. The<br>
amount of initiator used may vary based on the chosen initiator, the selected<br>
monomer, and the chosen starch. Some initiators, e.g., persulfates, may require the<br>
presence of heat. The initiator may be added in a single or multiple steps, and<br>
multiple initiators may be used.<br>
[0022] A cross-linking agent may be added to the mixture to form a cross-linked<br>
starch graft copolymer. It may be desirable for the starch graft copolymer to be<br>
cross-linked if it dissolves in aqueous fluids previous to being cross-linked. Crosslinking<br>
is one method to permit the starch graft copolymer to absorb aqueous fluids<br>
without dissolving. However, the amount of cross-linking agent added is typically<br>
indirectly proportional to the absorbency of the resulting SAP product. Exemplary<br>
cross-linking agents include: glycerides; diepoxides; diglycidyls; cyclohexadiamide;<br>
methylene bis-acrylamide; bis-hydroxyalkylamides, such as bis-hydroxypropyl<br>
adipamide; formaldehydes, such as urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde<br>
resins; isocyanates including di- or tri-isocyanates; epoxy resins, typically in the<br>
presence of a base catalyst; and derivatives and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0023] Alternative methods of cross-linking may also be employed. For example,<br>
a solid SAP product may be cross-linked through irradiation, such as exposure to<br>
gamma or x-ray electromagnetic radiation, or to an electron beam and the like.<br>
Irradiation facilitates cross-linking of the starch graft copolymer by creating free<br>
radicals in the copolymer chain. In some applications, after irradiation an annealing<br>
or melting process may be used in re-forming the cross-linked copolymer chains.<br>
Furthermore, it may be desirable to perform the irradiation process in an atmosphere<br>
relatively free of oxygen.<br>
[0024] Although the addition of cross-linking agents may be desirable in the<br>
production of SAPs, self-cross-linking copolymers may also be used. In a self-crosslinking<br>
copolymer, either a single self-reactive functional group or multiple selfreactive<br>
functional groups or multiple co-reactive functional groups are incorporated<br>
into the mixture. One exemplary co-reactive functional group is a copolymer of<br>
acrylic acid and glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
[0025] Once a cross-linked starch graft copolymer is formed, the pH of the crosslinked<br>
starch graft copolymer may be adjusted to a desired value for the particular<br>
agricultural application. For example, the cross-linked starch graft copolymer may<br>
be neutralized to convert the carboxyl groups to potassium salts. Alternative pH<br>
values may be desirable depending upon the type of soil and the type of crop the<br>
resulting SAPs will be applied to. The resulting pH for most agricultural applications<br>
typically will range from about 6.0 to about 8.0. The desired pH may be greater or<br>
less than this range depending on the requirements for the particular agricultural<br>
application.<br>
[0026] Alternatively, in some embodiments, pH adjustment of the starch graft<br>
copolymer may occur prior to cross-linking. In contrast to some alternative methods<br>
which require saponification, the step of pH adjustment/neutralization may be<br>
significantly faster, easier, and less expensive compared to saponification.<br>
Furthermore, adjusting the pH does not necessarily produce corrosive and<br>
dangerous reaction by-products such as ammonia. Exemplary solvents that may be<br>
used to effect pH adjustment include potassium hydroxide, potassium methoxide, or<br>
a mixture thereof, any of which may optionally be diluted in methanol or other<br>
solvents.<br>
[0027] In alternative embodiments, pH adjustment may not be necessary. For<br>
instance, if potassium acrylate were used as the monomer in lieu of acrylic acid, the<br>
resulting product may already be within an acceptable pH range.<br>
[0028] In one embodiment, the resulting pH adjusted, cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer may then be isolated. One exemplary method of isolation involves simply<br>
drying the cross-linked starch graft copolymer, such as, for example, on a heated<br>
drum or via air-drying. The dried SAP product may then be pelletized according to<br>
pelletization methods known to those having skill in the art.<br>
[0029] Compared to some alternative methods of producing SAPs which require<br>
the step of saponification, the method described herein provides a pH-adjusted,<br>
cross-linked starch graft copolymer reaction mass having very little extraneous salt.<br>
Consequently, isolation can be effected through the step of drying the SAP product<br>
in an alcohol-free environment. In contrast, methods that require saponification<br>
result in starch graft copolymers having a significant amount of extraneous salt and<br>
ammonia and thus must be treated with methanol. The use of methanol may add<br>
significantly to the cost of producing the SAP product because methanol disposal<br>
can be expensive.<br>
 [0030] In another embodiment, the step of isolating the starch graft copolymer<br>
involves extruding the cross-linked starch graft copolymer such as through a heated<br>
screw to form granules of SAP product. To minimize re-agglomeration of the<br>
granules, the granules may be coated with a dusting agent that decreases their<br>
propensity to stick together. Exemplary dusting agents include cellulose, clay,<br>
starch, flour, and other natural or synthetic polymers that prevent the granules from<br>
sticking together. Alternatively, the granules may be lightly sprayed with methanol to<br>
prevent them from sticking together, and/or the extrusion can be performed under<br>
high pressure.<br>
[0031] Yet another exemplary method of isolating the starch graft copolymer<br>
involves precipitating the pH-adjusted, cross-linked starch graft copolymer using<br>
water-miscible solvents such as alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, and<br>
isopropanol. Immersing the cross-linked starch graft copolymer in alcohol may<br>
cause the alkali starch graft copolymer to precipitate into particles that are later<br>
screened to the desired size after drying. The alcohol removes the water and<br>
extraneous salts from the cross-linked starch graft copolymer.<br>
[0032] Another exemplary implementation of this method of precipitation involves<br>
blending sufficient methanol into the pH-adjusted, cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer to achieve a smooth dispersion. The smooth dispersion may then be<br>
pumped into a precipitation tank, which may include a stirring system that can<br>
vigorously mix the methanol while pumping in the smooth cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer dispersion. Once mixed, the resulting methanol and cross-linked starch<br>
graft copolymer particles may be collected by decanting or washing with methanol or<br>
centrifuged and collected, then dried to a moisture level of between about 1 percent<br>
and about 20 percent.<br>
[0033] A third implementation of the isolation step through precipitation with<br>
methanol involves wetting the surface of the cross-linked starch graft copolymer with<br>
a small amount of methanol and then chopping the cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer into larger "chunks" that will not re-adhere to one another. Once the<br>
surface of the cross-linked starch graft copolymer has been wetted with methanol,<br>
the resulting material is slippery to the touch and is no longer sticky. This effect may<br>
be achieved by using a compositional ratio of between about one part and about two<br>
parts of methanol per one part of solid.<br>
[0034] Once the methanol has been added, the cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer may be pumped through an in-line chopper to form chunks having a<br>
diameter of less than one inch or, alternatively, hand-chopped with scissors. The<br>
resulting mixture is then fed into a tank or Waring blender that has between about<br>
1.5 gallons and about 2.0 gallons of additional methanol per pound of cross-linked<br>
starch graft copolymer. In some embodiments, the cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer may be subject to a pulverizer, such as an in-line mixer or disintegrator<br>
which breaks the mass into smaller pieces as desired for the particular application.<br>
The methanol in the larger tank may be agitated with a Cowles dissolver or other<br>
mixer capable of achieving high speeds.<br>
[0035] A fourth implementation of the isolation step through precipitation with<br>
methanol involves pre-forming the particle size before the methanol precipitation<br>
step. The use of dies to form strands or rods having different shapes and diameters<br>
can greatly improve the particle size formation process. This fourth implementation<br>
offers enhanced control of the final particle size. The cross-linked starch graft<br>
copolymer (neutralized or unneutralized) may be forced through a die plate having<br>
holes of varying diameter (e.g., about 1/16 inch to more than 1/4 inch) and varying<br>
shape (e.g., round, star, ribbon, etc.).<br>
[0036] Methods of forcing the cross-linked starch graft copolymer through the die<br>
plate include using a hand-operated plunger, screw-feeding, auguring, pumping, and<br>
any other commonly known method. The resulting strands or rods may be placed<br>
into the precipitation tank without any further addition of methanol as a premixing<br>
agent. The strands or rods may be treated to prevent them from sticking together<br>
by, for example, wetting or spraying the strands or rods with methanol or dusting<br>
them with a dusting agent, such as, for example, cellulose, clay, starch, flour, or<br>
other natural or synthetic polymers. The resulting strands or rods may be<br>
precipitated with agitated methanol, removed from the tank, and dried.<br>
[0037] Another step in the method of preparing a SAP includes forming the<br>
isolated, cross-linked starch graft copolymer into the desired size of particles and<br>
drying. The SAP product may have a particle size of less than about 200 mesh. The<br>
desirable particle size may depend on the specific agricultural application intended.<br>
In one embodiment for agricultural applications that deposit the starch graft<br>
copolymer directly into the soil, the particle size may be less than 50 mesh, more<br>
particularly between about 5 mesh and 50 mesh, or between about 5 mesh and <br>
mesh, or between about 8 mesh and about 25 mesh. This particle size is typically<br>
compatible with commercially available granular applicators in the industry. To<br>
broadcast or meter the absorbent particles through most existing application<br>
equipment, an about 8 mesh to about 25 mesh SAP product having a density of<br>
between about 30 pounds and about 35 pounds per cubic foot may be used.<br>
[0038] Other agricultural applications, such as seed coating and root dipping, may<br>
use a finer particle size. For seed coating, the desired particle size may be between<br>
about 75 mesh and about 300 mesh, such as about 200 mesh. For root dipping, the<br>
desired particle size may be between about 30 mesh and about 100 mesh, such as<br>
about 50 mesh.<br>
[0039J Alternatively, the cross-linked cross-linked starch graft copolymer product<br>
may be mixed with a solvent, such as water, to form a slurry. The resulting slurry<br>
may be applied to an agricultural medium such as a plant, root, seed, seedling, or<br>
directly to soil into which one of a plant, root, seed, or seedling will be planted.<br>
[0040] One exemplary method by which the desired size of particles may be<br>
formed involves converting the cross-linked starch graft copolymer into rod-shaped<br>
forms and drying the forms to the desired particle size. Die selection typically<br>
dictates the size and shape of the rod-shaped forms. The diameter of the rods is<br>
controlled by drilling holes in the end plate, such as 1/16-inch to 1/4-inch in diameter.<br>
For example, the die would be a plate that has been drilled or formed to contain<br>
holes of the selected size and shape.<br>
[0041] Following extrusion from the die, the rod-shaped forms may be lightly<br>
coated with a dusting agent that decreases their propensity to stick together and<br>
reduces their tackiness. Exemplary dusting agents include cellulose, clay, starch,<br>
flour, and other natural or synthetic polymers that prevent the rods from sticking<br>
together. Alternatively, the rods may be lightly sprayed with methanol, and/or they<br>
may be extruded from the die under pressure. The coated particles are then dried.<br>
Exemplary drying methods include air-drying or oven-drying. Following drying, the<br>
particles may be screened to the appropriate size.<br>
[0042] In another exemplary method by which the desired size particles may be<br>
formed, the cross-linked starch graft copolymer may be ground to a fine powder and<br>
then formed into pellets of the desired size. Pelletizing is common in the polymer<br>
industry and is Known to tnose or SKIII in the art. As described above, the resulting<br>
pellets may be lightly coated with a dusting agent that decreases their propensity to<br>
stick together and reduces their tackiness.<br>
[0043] The SAP product made by the methods described herein may also be<br>
colored using any coloring method known to one of skill in the art, including, but not<br>
limited to, adding fertilizers and/or charcoal. Also, a fertilizer or micronutrient may be<br>
added to the SAP product. The fertilizer or micronutrient may be added once the<br>
granular SAP product is formed or at any stage during processing.<br>
[0044] The agricultural application of SAPs made by the above-described<br>
methods may result in earlier seed germination and/or blooming, decreased irrigation<br>
requirements, increased propagation, increased crop growth, increased crop<br>
production, and decreased soil crusting. Thus SAPs made by the methods disclosed<br>
herein are desirable for forming and using a SAP in large-scale agricultural<br>
applications.<br>
[0045] The following Examples 1-3 demonstrate exemplary procedures used to<br>
form a SAP product using the method(s) described herein:<br>
EXAMPLE 1.<br>
[0046] Deionized water (2,000 ml) was added to cornstarch (200 g; Cargill Gel<br>
Instant 12030, manufactured by Cargill Food and Pharma Specialties, Inc. of Cedar<br>
Rapids, Iowa) in a 3-liter resin kettle. The combination was mixed until a uniform<br>
mixture was formed. Acrylic acid (200 g; 99% purity; City Chemical, LLC of West<br>
Haven, Connecticut) was added to the cooled mixture and the resulting mixture was<br>
stirred for approximately five minutes. Next, acrylamide (100 g; 99% purity; City<br>
Chemical, LLC of West Haven, Connecticut) was added to the mixture, and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred tor approximately five minutes. Then methylene bisacrylamide<br>
(0.5 g dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water; Molecular Grade; 99%<br>
purity; manufactured by Promega Corporation of Madison, Wisconsin) was added to<br>
the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred for approximately five minutes.<br>
Lastly, ammonium persulfate (0.5 g dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water; Molecular<br>
Grade; 99% purity; manufactured by Cascade Columbia Distribution Co. of<br>
Sherwood, Oregon) was added to the mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
while being heated to approximately 170°F. The mixture was held at that<br>
temperature and stirred for approximately 15 minutes. The resulting white, viscous<br>
mass had a pH of 3.7, and a nitrogen test of a small sample of the viscous mass<br>
showed a nitrogen content of 3.58%.<br>
[0047] Because the resulting viscous mass was acidic, the mixture was<br>
neutralized by titration with 45% potassium hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature.<br>
Titration continued until a pH of 7.0 was reached, which required addition of between<br>
about 160 g and 170 g of 45% KOH.<br>
[0048] The cross-linked SAP product was then isolated by adding the neutral pH<br>
reaction mass to several gallons of methanol. The resulting cross-linked SAP<br>
product was dried in a tumble dryer such that a white, granular SAP product having a<br>
density of 6.6 grams per cubic inch, and a moisture content of 9.1% was formed. A<br>
nitrogen test of the SAP product showed a nitrogen content of approximately 3.19%.<br>
The SAP product exhibited the ability to imbibe or absorb between about 400 and<br>
about 500 times its weight in aqueous fluid and to retain the imbibed or absorbed<br>
aqueous fluid under moderate pressure.<br>
EXAMPLE 2.<br>
[0049] Deionized water {2,000 ml) was added to cornstarch (200 g; Corn<br>
Products #3005, Industrial Starch (pearl starch), manufactured by CPC International,<br>
Inc. of Westchester, Illinois) in a 3-liter resin kettle. The combination was mixed until<br>
a uniform mixture was formed. The mixture was then heated to between about<br>
185°F and about 190T using a heating jacket. The mixture was maintained at this<br>
temperature for approximately 30 minutes, at which time the heating jacket was<br>
turned off and the mixture was allowed to cool to 150°F.<br>
[0050] Acrylic acid (200 g; 99% purity; City Chemical, LLC of West Haven,<br>
Connecticut) was added to the cooled mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
for approximately five minutes. Next, acrylamide (100 g; 99% purity; City Chemical,<br>
LLC of West Haven, Connecticut) was added to the mixture, and the resulting<br>
mixture was stirred for approximately five minutes. Then methylene bis-acrylamide<br>

heated to approximately 170°F. The mixture was held at that temperature and<br>
stirred for approximately 15 minutes. The resulting white, viscous mass had a pH of<br>
3.7, and a nitrogen test of a small sample of the viscous mass showed a nitrogen<br>
content of 3.58%.<br>
[0051] Because the resulting viscous mass was acidic, the mixture was<br>
neutralized by titration with 45% potassium hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature.<br>
I itration continued until a pM or /.u was reached, which required addition of between<br>
about 160 g and 170 g of 45% KOH.<br>
[0052] The cross-linked SAP product was then isolated by adding the neutral pH<br>
reaction mass to several gallons of methanol. The resulting cross-linked SAP<br>

absorbed aqueous fluid under moderate pressure.<br>
EXAMPLE 3.<br>
[0053] Deionized water (2,000 ml) was added to pregelatinized yellow corn flour<br>
(200 g; #01965-00, manufactured by Cargill Dry Corn Ingredients, Inc. of Paris,<br>
Illinois) in a 3-liter resin kettle. The combination was mixed until a uniform mixture<br>
was formed. Acrylic acid (200 g; 99% purity; City Chemical, LLC of West Haven,<br>

content of 3.58%.<br>
[0054] Because the resulting viscous mass was acidic, the mixture was<br>
neutralized by titration with 45% potassium hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature.<br>
Titration continued until a pH of 7.0 was reached, which required addition of between<br>
about 160 g and 170 g of 45% KOH.<br>
[0055] The cross-linked SAP product was then isolated by adding the neutral pH<br>

[0056] The following Examples 4 and 5 are hypothetical examples that<br>
demonstrate exemplary procedures that may be used to form a SAP product using<br>
the method(s) described herein. While Examples 4 and 5 are hypothetical in nature<br>
they are based upon actual experimental designs that have been tested and/or<br>
contemplated.<br>
Example 4.<br>
[0057] Deionized water (2,000 ml) is added to cornstarch (200 g) in a 3-liter resin<br>
kettle. The combination is mixed until a uniform mixture is formed. Acrylic acid (200<br>
g; 99% purity) is added to the cooled mixture and the resulting mixture is stirred for<br>
approximately five minutes. Next, acrylamide (100 g; 99% purity) is added to the<br>
mixture, and the resulting mixture is stirred for approximately five minutes. Then<br>
methylene bis-acrylamide (0.5 g dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water; Molecular<br>
Grade; 99% purity) is added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture is stirred for<br>
approximately five minutes. Lastly, ammonium persulfate (0.5 g dissolved in 50 ml<br>
of deionized water; Molecular Grade; 99% purity) is added to the mixture and the<br>
resulting mixture is stirred while being heated to approximately 170°F. The mixture<br>
is held at that temperature and stirred for approximately 15 minutes.<br>
[0058] The resulting mass is neutralized by titration with 45% potassium<br>
hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature. Titration continues until a pH of 7.0 is<br>
reached. The cross-linked SAP product is then dried in a tumble dryer.<br>
Example 5.<br>
[0059] Deionized water (2,000 ml) is added to cornstarch (200 g) in a 3-liter resin<br>
kettle. The combination is mixed until a uniform mixture is formed. Acrylic acid (200<br>
g; 99% purity) is added to the cooled mixture and the resulting mixture is stirred for<br>
approximately five minutes. Next, acrylamide (100 g; 99% purity) is added to the<br>
mixture, and the resulting mixture is stirred for approximately five minutes. Then<br>
methylene bis-acrylamide (0.5 g dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water; Molecular<br>
Grade; 99% purity) is added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture is stirred for<br>
approximately five minutes. Lastly, ammonium persulfate (0.5 g dissolved in 50 ml<br>
of deionized water; Molecular Grade; 99% purity) is added to the mixture and the<br>
resulting mixture is stirred while being heated to approximately 170°F. The mixture<br>
is held at that temperature and stirred for approximately 15 minutes.<br>
[0060] The resulting mass is neutralized by titration with 45% potassium<br>
hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature. Titration continues until a pH of 7.0 is<br>
reached. The neutralized cross-linked starch graft copolymer is then screw-fed<br>
through a die plate having holes of varying diameter (between 1/16 inch to 1/4 inch).<br>
The resulting strands are dusted with cellulose as a dusting agent, to prevent the<br>
strands from sticking together. The resulting strands are then dried in a tumble<br>
dryer.<br>
Experimental Comparison.<br>
[0061] The effectiveness of the SAP product formed using the method described<br>
in Example 1 was tested and analyzed in comparison to various alternative SAP<br>
products having varying particle sizes and in comparison to control subjects.<br>
[0062] The general procedure for the testing was as follows. Eight one-gallon<br>
plastic pots having drainage holes were obtained. Six of the pots (Samples B-E, G,<br>
and H) were filled with a thoroughly combined mixture of 10 g of the selected SAP<br>
product and approximately 0.5 gallon of sand; two of the pots (Samples A and F)<br>
were control pots, which were filled with plain, untreated sand. The assignment of<br>
pots (A through H) occurred randomly. Sand, rather than dirt, was chosen as the<br>
growing medium because sand provides no nutrients for growing plants. Samples BE,<br>
G, and H were formed as follows:<br>
[0063] Sample B included an alternative SAP product having a particle size of<br>
about 10 to about 20 mesh and made using acrylonitrile as the monomer and yellow<br>
corn flour as the starch;<br>
[0064] Sample C included the SAP product formed by the method described in<br>
Example 1 and having a particle size of about 8 to about 16 mesh;<br>
 [0065] Sample D included another alternative SAP product having a particle size<br>
of about 8 mesh and made using acrylonitrile as the monomer and cornstarch as the<br>
starch;<br>
[0066] Sample E included yet another alternative SAP product having a particle<br>
size of about 10 to about 20 mesh and using acrylonitrile as the monomer and a<br>
50/50 mixture of yellow corn flour and cornstarch as the starch;<br>
[0067] Sample G included still another alternative SAP product having a particle<br>
size of greater than about 8 mesh and made using acrylonitrile as the monomer and<br>
cornstarch as the starch; and<br>
[0068] Sample H included the SAP product formed by the method described in<br>
Example 1 and having a particle size of between about 20 and about 40 mesh.<br>
[0069] One six-inch-high geranium plant was planted in each of the filled pots,<br>
such that the final sand level in each pot was approximately one-inch below the rim<br>
of the pot. Approximately two liters of water were added to each pot; 24 hours later,<br>
another approximately two liters of water were added to each pot.<br>
[0070] The pots were then placed in a plastic pool that was positioned under a<br>
fluorescent light source, such that the light source was approximately 14 inches<br>
above the tops of the geranium plants. The plastic pool was slightly rotated on a<br>
daily basis to ensure that each geranium plant received the same amount of light.<br>
Once per week, the plants were rearranged in the pool, to further ensure that each<br>
geranium plant received the same amount of light. The geranium plants received no<br>
additional water and were allowed to grow for 65 days. At the end of 65 days, the<br>
geranium plants were harvested and the following information was gathered:<br>
c  Height of the plant is measured from the top of the sand to the top of the highest<br>
point of the plant.<br>
Width of the plant is measured from the widest points on either side of the plant.<br>
Mass includes the entire plant (roots, stem, and leaves).<br>
 [0071] Figure 1 is a graph representing the comparison of sample height, where<br>
the x-axis is each sample and the y-axis is the height in inches. The height of each<br>
plant is measured from the top of the sand to the top of the highest point of the plant.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph representing the comparison of sample width, where the x-axis is<br>
the sample identity and the y-axis is the width of the sample in inches. The width of<br>
each plant is measured from the widest points on either side of the plant. Figure 3 is<br>
a graph representing the comparison of sample mass, where the x-axis is the<br>
sample identity and the y-axis is the mass of each sample in grams. The mass<br>
includes the mass of the entire plant (roots, stem, and leaves).<br>
[0072] Figures 1 through 3 show that Sample E , which included an alternative<br>
SAP product having a particle size of about 10 to about 20 mesh and using<br>
acrylonitrile as the monomer and a 50/50 mixture of yellow corn flour and cornstarch<br>
as the starch, had the greatest overall mass (67.6 g). However, Samples C and H,<br>
which both included the SAP product formed by the method described in Example 1,<br>
tied for the second greatest overall mass. Interestingly, there was no noticeable<br>
difference in overall mass based on the varying particle sizes used for Samples C<br>
and H. Most importantly, both Samples C and H showed significant growth as<br>
compared to the control samples (A and F).<br>
