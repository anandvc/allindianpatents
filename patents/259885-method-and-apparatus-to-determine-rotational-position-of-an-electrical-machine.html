METHOD AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE ROTATIONAL<br>
POSITION OF AN ELECTRICAL MACHINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control of an electrical machine,<br>
and more specifically to a control system for an electric machine to determine<br>
rotational position to optimize energy usage to supply motive torque in a<br>
vehicle propulsion system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Control systems for electrical motors typically include a feedback<br>
device such as a position sensor to provide data to measure position and<br>
rotational velocity of the motor. On a three-phase multipole synchronous<br>
electrical motor, precise and accurate measurement of position of a rotor<br>
relative to each of the poles of a stator is important to achieve efficient<br>
transmission of electrical energy. Rotor position is typically measured using<br>
the position sensor to determine position of the resolver. Position of the<br>
resolver relative to the machine rotor is subject to error due to factors<br>
including manufacturing variations and tolerances. Electrical motor<br>
manufacturers have attempted to correct errors in resolver position<br>
measurement using adjustments and post-assembly calibrations.<br>
Manufacturers have also attempted to correct sensor-related errors by<br>
introducing sensorless techniques for determining rotor position by monitoring<br>
and analyzing electromagnetic characteristics of the motor.<br>
[0003] Vehicle propulsion systems comprising hybrid powertrains are<br>
known for managing the input and output torques of various torque-generative<br>
devices, most commonly internal combustion engines and electric machines.<br>
One hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
torque from a torque-generative source, e.g. an internal combustion engine,<br>
and an output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to a<br><br>
vehicle driveline. Motive torque is transmitted to the transmission from first<br>
and second electrical machines operatively connected to an energy storage<br>
device for interchanging electrical power therebetween. A controller is<br>
provided for regulating the electrical power interchange between the energy<br>
storage device and the electrical machines.<br>
[0004] The electrical machines preferably comprise known permanent<br>
magnet synchronous motor/generator machines, each constructed of a multi-<br>
pole electrical stator and a rotor device. Such machines are preferable for<br>
powertrain and vehicle applications because they exhibit high torque-to-inertia<br>
ratios, high efficiency, and high power density. In such machines, the<br>
controller requires accurate and precise information regarding position of the<br>
rotor device relative to the stator in order to optimize electrical energy<br>
efficiency, thus leading to improved fuel economy.<br>
[0005] Prior art systems utilize such techniques as tight machine tolerances<br>
and assembly methods, coupled with multiple position sensing devices to<br>
ensure accurate measurement of rotor position relative to the stator.<br>
[0006] When using PM synchronous machines, absolute position (within one<br>
pole pair pitch) is required. Also, the accuracy of this position measurement is<br>
critical, as it will affect the performance of the motor control, most noticeably<br>
in torque production and linearity. Using a resolver can provide precise<br>
position measurement. However, the accuracy of the measurement is directly<br>
affected by the initial alignment of the resolver during installation. The<br>
installation of the resolver and mechanical alignment can be difficult to<br>
control in production.<br>
[0007] It is therefore desirable to use a self-aligning start-up algorithm in the<br>
motor control.<br>
[0008] There is a need to provide an improved method and system to<br>
precisely and accurately determine position of a rotor device in a stator for an<br>
electrical machine, especially one for application on a fuel/electric hybrid<br>
powertrain for a vehicle.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a control system<br>
for an electric machine which precisely and accurately determines position of<br>
a rotor device relative to a stator for the electrical machine, especially one<br>
comprising a synchronous multipole electrical machine, including one for<br>
application on a fuel/electric hybrid powertrain for a vehicle.<br>
[0010] In accordance with the present invention, a sensorless motor control<br>
system is used to estimate rotor position during powertrain start-up. The<br>
estimated angle is compared to the measured resolver angle. A correcting<br>
offset is added to the resolver signal. After start-up, the control system uses<br>
the corrected resolver signal for position feedback and control. In this manner,<br>
the installation alignment requirements for the resolver are greatly reduced.<br>
[0011] Thus, in accordance with the invention, a control system and a<br>
method for controlling an electric machine comprising a multi-phase multipole<br>
motor having a stator, a rotor, and a rotor position sensing mechanism is<br>
provided. The control system comprises an inverter operable to transmit<br>
electrical energy between the stator of the electrical machine and an electrical<br>
storage device, and a controller. The controller includes executable algorithms<br>
and predetermined calibrations which derive a rotor position based upon a<br>
sensorless position sensing technique, and determine an offset parameter<br>
between the derived rotor position and a sensed rotor position. The inverter is<br>
controlled based upon the sensed rotor position and the offset parameter. The<br>
offset parameter is stored in a non-volatile memory device of the control<br>
system for future reference.<br>
[0012] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0020] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409 entitled TWO-MODE,<br>
COMPOUND-SPLIT, HYBRID ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION HAVING<br>
FOUR FIXED RATIOS, which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission<br>
embodying the concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is<br>
designated generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input<br>
shaft 12 preferably directly driven by an engine 14. A transient torque damper<br>
20 is incorporated between the output shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the input<br><br>
member 12 of the transmission 10. The transient torque damper 20 preferably<br>
comprises a torque transfer device 77 having characteristics of a damping<br>
mechanism and a spring. The transient torque damper 20 permits selective<br>
engagement of the engine 14 with the transmission 10. The torque transfer<br>
device 77 is not utilized to change, or control, the mode in which the<br>
transmission 10 operates. The torque transfer device 77 preferably comprises<br>
a hydraulically operated friction clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br>
[0021] The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a torque output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br>
over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by which the engine 14 is<br>
connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the input member 12<br>
is connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
[0022] Referring specifically now to Fig. 1, the transmission 10 utilizes three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. The first planetary gear set 24 has an outer<br>
ring gear member 30 which circumscribes an inner, or sun gear member 32. A<br>
plurality of planetary gear members 34 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 36<br>
such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly engages both the outer<br>
gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
[0023] The second planetary gear set 26 has an outer ring gear member 38,<br>
which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 40. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 42 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each<br>
planetary gear 42 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the<br>
inner gear member 40.<br>
[0024] The third planetary gear set 28 has an outer ring gear member 46,<br>
which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 48. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 50 are rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each<br>
planetary gear 50 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the<br>
inner gear member 48.<br><br>
[0025] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined through a hub plate gear 54 to the outer gear member<br>
38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear member 32 of<br>
the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 26 are continuously connected to a first electrical machine<br>
comprising a motor/generator 56, referred to as Motor A or "MA".<br>
[0026] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through a torque transfer device 62 which, as will<br>
be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in the selection of<br>
the operational modes of the transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64.<br>
[0027] In the embodiment described herein, wherein the transmission 10 is<br>
used in a land vehicle, the output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
driveline comprising a gear box 90 or other torque transfer device which<br>
provides a torque output to one or more vehicular axles 92 or half-shafts (not<br>
shown). The axles 92, in turn, terminate in drive members 96. The drive<br>
members 96 can be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on which they are<br>
employed, or they may be a drive gear of a track vehicle. The drive members<br>
96 may have some form of wheel brake 94 associated therewith. The drive<br>
members each have a speed parameter, NWHL, comprising rotational speed of<br>
each wheel 96 which is typically measurable with a wheel speed sensor.<br>
[0028] The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28,<br><br>
through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member<br>
46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground,<br>
represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer device<br>
70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also continuously connected to a<br>
second electrical machine comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MB.<br>
[0029] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as the two electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft<br>
60. Electrical machines 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which<br>
permits them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such<br>
that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
electrical machines 56 and 72. This configuration assures that the overall<br>
envelope, i.e., the circumferential dimension, of the transmission 10 is<br>
minimized.<br>
[0030] A torque transfer device 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40 with<br>
ground, i.e., with transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device 75 is<br>
operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively connecting<br>
the sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62, 70, 73, 75<br>
are all friction clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch CI 70,<br>
clutch C2 62, clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is preferably<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump<br>
when a corresponding clutch control solenoid is actuated. Hydraulic actuation<br>
of each of the clutches is accomplished using a known hydraulic fluid circuit<br>
having a plurality of clutch-control solenoids, which is not described in detail<br>
herein.<br>
[0031] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the electrical machines 56 and<br>
72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in<br><br>
an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically<br>
comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and electrochemical<br>
energy storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and<br>
dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering<br>
the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based<br>
upon factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related to<br>
typical road grade and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines or<br>
transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system<br>
described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. The TPIM 19 communicates with<br>
the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19<br>
similarly communicates with the second electrical machine 72 by transfer<br>
conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable to or from the ESD 74 in<br>
accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19<br>
includes the pair of power inverters and respective motor controllers<br>
configured to receive motor control commands and control inverter states<br>
therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
[0032] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from the<br>
DC lines and provides AC current to the respective electrical machine, i.e. MA<br>
and MB, over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the<br>
respective inverter receives AC current from the electrical machine over<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31 and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net<br>
DC current provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or<br>
discharge operating mode of the electrical energy storage device 74.<br>
Preferably, MA 56 and MB 72 are three-phase AC machines and the inverters<br>
comprise complementary three-phase power electronics.<br><br>
[0033] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed controller architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MA and MB 56, 72. The distributed<br>
controller architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned controllers. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the<br>
transmission 10. Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an<br>
accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed<br>
cruise control. Each of the aforementioned controllers communicates with<br>
other controllers, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control parameters<br>
and commands between the various controllers. The specific communication<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific. By way of example, one<br>
communications protocol is the Society of Automotive Engineers standard<br>
J1939. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging<br>
and multi-controller interfacing between the aforementioned controllers, and<br>
other controllers providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction<br>
control, and vehicle stability.<br><br>
[0034] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an engine torque command, clutch torque commands,<br>
TCLN for the various clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10; and<br>
motor torque commands, TAand TB, for MA and MB, respectively.<br>
[0035] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command, TE_CMD, from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque, Tb input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that are sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed (N1) to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that are controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0036] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques, TCL N_EST, for each of the clutches C1, C2, C3, and,<br>
C4 and rotational speed, N0, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the<br>
HCP for control purposes.<br><br>
[0037] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, VBAT, and available battery<br>
power, PBAT_MiNand PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0038] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes a pair<br>
of power inverters and motor controllers configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate torque<br>
commands for MA 56 and MB 72, TA and TB, based upon input from the HCP<br>
5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system operating<br>
parameters. The motor torque commands for MA and MB, i.e. TA and TB, are<br>
implemented by the control system, including the TPIM 19, to control MA and<br>
MB. Individual motor speed signals, NA and NB for MA and MB respectively,<br>
are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or conventional<br>
rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and communicates motor speeds,<br>
NA and NB, to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged.<br>
[0039] Each of the aforementioned controllers is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each controller has a set of control<br>
algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in<br>
ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer.<br><br>
Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0040] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the controllers<br>
are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in<br>
response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0041] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP controller 5 and one or more of the other controllers<br>
determine required transmission output torque, T0 at shaft 64. Selectively<br>
operated components of the transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and<br>
manipulated to respond to the operator demand. For example, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has selected<br>
a forward drive range and manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake<br>
pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output torque for the transmission, T0, which<br>
affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission required to<br>
arrive at the desired torque output. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the<br>
transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in<br>
order to meet the operator demand.<br><br>
[0042] The two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission,<br>
includes output member 64 which receives output power through two distinct<br>
gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several transmission<br>
operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, and Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0043] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 are engaged or actuated<br>
for each of the operating modes. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, MA and MB may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated<br>
in order to "ground" the outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. A second mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device<br>
70 is released and the torque transfer device 62 is simultaneously actuated to<br>
connect the shaft 60 to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other<br>
factors outside the scope of the invention affect when MA and MB 56, 72<br>
operate as motors and generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0044] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds, N0, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes<br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel the vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and<br><br>
meet various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the<br>
control system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0045] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable mode.<br>
Certain ranges of operation are described below in which fixed ratios are<br>
achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional clutch may be<br>
clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0046] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e. N,/N0, is achieved. The rotations of machines<br>
MA and MB 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as<br>
defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, N,, determined or<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MA and MB function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine-to-output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br>
power from the engine and power from MA and MB, through planetary gear<br>
set 28 by accepting power from the energy storage device 74.<br>
[0047] The transmission operating mode can be switched between Fixed<br>
Ratio operation and continuously variable Mode operation by activating or<br>
deactivating one the additional clutches during Mode I or Mode II operation.<br>
Determination of operation in fixed ratio or mode control is by algorithms<br>
executed by the control system, and is outside the scope of this invention. The<br>
modes of operation may overlap the ratio of operation, and selection depends<br>
again on the driver's input and response of the vehicle to that input. RANGE 1<br>
falls primarily within mode I operation when clutches CI 70 and C4 75 are<br>
engaged. RANGE 2 falls within mode I and mode II when clutches C2 62 and<br><br>
C1 70 are engaged. A third fixed ratio range is available primarily during<br>
mode II when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are engaged, and a fourth fixed ratio<br>
range is available during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C3 73 are engaged.<br>
It is notable that ranges of operation for Mode I and Mode II typically overlap<br>
significantly.<br>
[0048] Referring again to Fig 1, and with reference now to Fig. 8, the<br>
electric machines MA and MB 56, 72 are known three-phase AC electrical<br>
machines and the inverters comprise known complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics. MA and MB are coaxially oriented about the axially<br>
disposed shaft 60. MA and MB are both of an annular configuration<br>
permitting them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28<br>
such that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly<br>
of MA and MB. Each machine includes a stator, a rotor, and a resolver<br>
assembly 80, shown also with reference to Fig. 8. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to outer transmission housing 68, and includes a stator<br>
core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom. The rotor for MA<br>
56 is supported on a hub plate gear 54 that is operably attached to output shaft<br>
60 via carrier 36. The rotor for MB 72 is attached to sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
Each motor resolver assembly 80 is appropriately positioned and assembled on<br>
one of MA and MB, such that a notch 88 is oriented at magnetic, or true north.<br>
Each resolver assembly 80 of this embodiment comprises a known variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator 82, operably connected to the<br>
stator for each machine, and a resolver rotor 84, operably connected to the<br>
rotor for each machine described above. Each resolver 80 comprises a sensing<br>
device operable to sense rotational position of the resolver stator relative to the<br>
resolver rotor, and identify the rotational position relative to notch 88. Each<br>
resolver stator 82 comprises a series of inductive coils assembled thereon<br>
which receive an electrical excitation signal from the TPIM 19, and a pair of<br>
sensing, or pickup, coils which provide an electrical signal output to the TPIM<br>
19. Each resolver rotor 84 comprises a rotating device having a plurality of<br><br>
lobes 86, or eccentricities, located on the outer circumference. In the<br>
exemplary system shown in Fig. 8 there are three lobes shown, but the system<br>
is operative using various quantities of lobes 86. In operation, the resolver<br>
rotor 84 rotates with the motor rotor. The pickup coils are excited by the<br>
excitation signal and return a signal to the TPIM at the same frequency as the<br>
excitation frequency and having a voltage level that is dependent upon the<br>
proximity of the of the lobed resolver rotor 84 to the resolver stator 82. The<br>
resolver 80 operates by sensing relative position and motion of the resolver<br>
rotor rotating within the resolver stator. The control system is able to interpret<br>
the signal returned through the resolver stator to determine rotor position, as is<br>
described herein. The variable reluctance device for the resolver 80 is one of<br>
several known technologies useable to determine position.<br>
[0049] The invention, described with reference to the embodiment described<br>
above, comprises utilizing elements of the distributed control system to<br>
operate MA and MB, to provide motive torque and regenerative torque for the<br>
vehicle powertrain system. The overall control system operates the TPIM 19<br>
to transmit electrical energy between the stator of each electrical machine and<br>
the ESD 74. The TPIM operates to measure a position of the resolver rotor<br>
and hence the machine rotor, using the resolver stator device, measured<br>
relative to notch 88 of the rotor 84, including known signal processing<br>
methods. The TPIM acts to derive a position of the machine rotor using a<br>
sensorless position sensing technique, described hereinbelow. The derived<br>
position of the machine rotor is a true position of the machine rotor. The<br>
TPIM determines an offset parameter, comprising an angular difference<br>
between the derived position of the machine rotor and the measured position<br>
of the resolver rotor. The TPIM operates to control electrical energy input to<br>
each of the coils of the stator for the three-phase multipole motor, using the<br>
offset parameter. The offset parameter is preferably stored in a non-volatile<br>
memory device within the TPIM or other element of the control system, for<br>
use in future operation. An alternative control system preferably includes an<br><br>
on-board algorithm that provides statistical analysis of a plurality of offset<br>
parameters calculated over subsequent starting events, using such known<br>
techniques as exponentially weighted moving averages. A parametric value<br>
for the offset is preferably determined once during each operation of the<br>
engine or vehicle. The control system preferably operates to derive the rotor<br>
position during initial machine operation, i.e. at engine startup or immediately<br>
thereafter. The control system is preferably operable to determine the offset<br>
parameter when the machine is operating in a motive torque-generative mode<br>
and when operating in an electrical energy-generative mode.<br>
[0050] One exemplary method for sensorless position sensing comprises<br>
injecting a high frequency signal into the stator of the electrical machine at<br>
low operating speed, during initial machine operation; and, detecting a<br>
position of the rotor based upon the injected high frequency signal. This<br>
includes determining a north/south polarity of the resolver rotor prior to, or<br>
simultaneously with determining its position, in systems wherein this is<br>
necessary. The technique is described as below.<br>
[0051] Referring now to Figs. 3, 4, and 5, a diagrammatic drawing of an<br>
embodiment of the exemplary sensorless position sensing scheme 110, for<br>
execution as a coded algorithm in the distributed control system described<br>
hereinabove, is now described. The position sensing scheme 110 is illustrated<br>
as a sequence of block diagrams that represent software executed in the<br>
distributed control system, to control one of electrical machines MA and MB<br>
56, 72. Alternate embodiments of electric machines which may employ the<br>
control system described herein include motor technologies such as,<br>
synchronous reluctance motors, and interior permanent magnet motors. In<br>
operation, the HCP 5 generates input torque command T1 , previously<br>
described. The torque command T1 is processed by a torque linearization<br>
model 114 to generate a corresponding stator current Is required to develop the<br>
desired electromagnetic torque in the machine. The stator current generated<br>
at block 114 is then passed to an optimum torque per amp block 116. Block<br><br>
116 processes the commanded stator current and decomposes it into the<br>
respective D and Q axis components of current command (Idset and Iqse) to<br>
provide the maximum torque for the given stator current amplitude.<br>
[0052] The current command Idsei is added to a field weakening component<br>
Idse_fw generated at summing junction 118 to generate the final D axis current<br>
command Idse- The field weakening component Idse_fw is generated by a field<br>
weakening block 120 using the measured DC link voltage VdC, commanded<br>
output voltages Vqss and VdSS, and rotor angular velocity cor. Summing<br>
junction 122 subtracts the feedback current Iqse_ft from the Q axis current<br>
command Iqse to obtain the error of the Q axis current regulator. Summing<br>
junction 124 subtracts the feedback current from Idse_ft from the D axis current<br>
command Idse to obtain the error of the D axis current regulator. The errors<br>
generated by the summing junctions 122 and 124 are used by a synchronous<br>
current regulator block 126 to control the synchronous frame voltage<br>
commands Vdse and Vqse.<br>
[0053] Block 128 uses the estimated rotor angular position 9r to convert the<br>
synchronous frame voltage commands Vdse and Vqse to the stationary frame<br>
voltage commands VdSSi and Vqssi. The high frequency voltage signals Vdssi_nj<br>
and Vqss_inj are added to the stationary reference frame voltage commands by<br>
the summing junctions 130 and 132, resulting in the final voltage commands<br>
Vdss and Vqss. The voltage source inverter 134 processes the final voltage<br>
commands VdSS and Vqss to generate the actual phase voltages applied the<br>
motor 56. The phase currents are measured and processed by a three-phase to<br>
two-phase transformation block 136. The outputs of the block 136 are<br>
stationary frame currents Idss and Iqss. A stationary to rotating frame<br>
transformation block 140 uses the stationary frame currents IdSS and Iqss and the<br>
estimated rotor angular position 9r to generate synchronous reference frame<br>
feedback currents Idseft and Iqse ft-<br>
[0054] The present invention includes sensorless control of the rotor speed<br>
and position that includes: a low speed rotor angular position estimation<br><br>
method/observer at block 142; an initial rotor polarity detection method at<br>
block 143, when needed; a high speed rotor angular position estimation<br>
method/observer at block 144; and a transition algorithm at block 146 to<br>
seamlessly merge the low and high speed estimation methods, when the high<br>
speed rotor angular position estimation method is utilized.<br>
[0055] Block 142 of Fig. 3 represents the low speed estimation method of<br>
the present invention. Fig. 4 shows a detailed block diagram implementation<br>
of block 142 to estimate rotor electrical position during low-speed operations<br>
as described above. The low speed estimation method is used to estimate rotor<br>
electrical position during zero and low-speed operations (preferably 
rated machine speed but any machine speed is considered within the scope of<br>
the low speed estimation method of the present invention). The estimation of<br>
the rotor electrical position is performed by injecting a high frequency voltage<br>
signal on an estimated D axis of the machine. The fluctuating high frequency<br>
signal in a synchronously rotating reference frame with the fundamental stator<br>
frequency is used to detect an asymmetry of the spatial impedance in an AC<br>
machine. An asymmetry of the spatial impedance is caused by salient<br>
construction of the rotor of the machine or induced magnetic saturation in the<br>
machine.<br>
[0056] When the high frequency voltage signal is injected on the estimated<br>
D axis, the orthogonal component of the current measured at the estimated<br>
reference frame can be used as an error signal as shown by Eq. 1.<br><br><br>
and also the impedance difference of the reactive component is much larger<br>
than that of the resistive component then Eq. 2 can be<br>
simplified as shown in Eq. 3 in quasi-steady-state.<br>
[0059]   sin <br>
[2]<br>
[0060] <br>
[0061] Multiplying the orthogonal signal with respect to the injected signal<br>
results in the DC quantity of the error signal for the tracking controller. After<br>
low-pass filtering the DC quantity can be obtained as shown in Eq. 4:<br>
[0062] <br>
[0063] Referring to Fig. 4, block 150 converts the stationary frame currents<br>
Iqss and Idss to the estimated synchronous reference frame current Iqsm. Block<br>
152 comprises a second order band pass filter to allow only the injection high<br>
frequency signal (preferably in the range 500 to 1000Hz) to be processed at<br>
multiplying junction 154. Junction 154 multiplies the output of the BPF of<br>
block 152 by the term to extract the DC component of the error<br>
signal. Block 156 comprises a second order low pass filter to remove high<br>
frequency harmonics from the signal and output the term Iqm . Iqm is an error<br>
signal defined in Eq. 4.<br><br>
[0064] Block 158 is a third order position observer that processes the error<br>
term Iqm. Iqm is processed by proportional control block 160, integral control<br>
block 162, and feed-forward control block 164 to generate outputs. The<br>
integral and proportional outputs of blocks 160 and 162 are summed at<br>
summing junction 166 and processed by block 168 to generate and estimate<br>
speed corjow The output of the feed-forward gain block 164 is processed by a<br>
limiter block 170 and then fed-forward to summing junction 172 to be added<br>
to the speed output of block 168. Block 174 processes to generate the<br>
term which is the estimated angular position of the rotor at low speed.<br>
[0065] Fig. 5 is a detailed block diagram implementation of the block 143<br>
used to detect initial rotor magnet polarity, for north/south polarity<br>
determination. The stationary to rotating reference frame block 180 converts<br>
the stationary frame currents IdSS and Iqss to the synchronous reference frame<br>
currents IdSe and Iqse using 9r. Only the D axis current Idse is used in the initial<br>
rotor polarity detection method. Idse is passed through a band-pass filter 182<br>
which filters out all but the second harmonic of the injection frequency of the<br>
Idse current. The output of the band-pass filter 182 is Idse bP- The signal Idse_bp<br>
is demodulated by multiplying it with the term sin(2cojnjt - §) using the<br>
multiplier block 184. The resultant signal Iai contains a DC component and a<br>
high frequency component. The low-pass filter block 186 filters out the high<br>
frequency component of Idi, leaving only the DC portion Id. The signal Id<br>
contains the information on the polarity of the rotor magnet with respect to the<br>
estimated machine D axis. Condition block 188 determines the polarity of the<br>
estimated position using the sign of the signal Id. This condition is evaluated<br>
once during the start-up sequence. If the sign of Id is negative, 180 degrees is<br>
added to the estimated rotor position.<br>
[0066] Referring now to Fig. 6, an algorithm, executed in the control system<br>
to control the exemplary powertrain shown with reference to Fig. 1 and 2, is<br>
described which implements the exemplary method for sensorless position<br>
sensing described hereinabove with reference to Figs. 3, 4, and 5. The method<br><br>
comprises injecting a high frequency signal into the stator at low operating<br>
speed during initial machine operation to detect position of the rotor based<br>
upon the injected high frequency signal. The algorithm includes measuring<br>
the resolver position using the resolver sensor (SI). When the rotational speed<br>
is greater than a calibrated maximum (nmax), (S2) a previously stored offset<br>
value is used by the control system, or alternatively, the algorithm waits until<br>
the speed drops below the calibrated maximum (nmax) (S3'). When the<br>
rotational speed is less than the calibrated maximum (nmax) switching is<br>
enabled (S3), the high frequency ('HF') signal is injected, and estimation of<br>
the rotor electrical position is performed (S4). The system converges on a<br>
value (S5), and the offset is computed (S6). The offset is validated, and<br>
filtered (S7), and the high frequency injection and estimation is disabled for<br>
the remainder of the operating cycle (S8). The powertrain system operates<br>
(S9) using the resolver sensor position and the learned offset. At shutdown,<br>
the data is stored in a non-volatile memory storage device of the control<br>
system, such as one of the electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM) devices of one of the controllers.<br>
[0067] Referring now to Fig. 7, data for the exemplary system is shown.<br>
The plotted data comprises a plot of magnitude of resolver error, in electrical<br>
degrees. Line A is a representation of the actual resolver error, in this instance<br>
comprising a worst-case error created during system assembly, having a<br>
magnitude of ten degrees electrical rotation. The data points shown as C in<br>
the plot comprise raw algorithm learn values for resolver position, corrected<br>
using the invention described herein. In all instances, the magnitude of error<br>
of the corrected resolver position is less than two degrees electrical rotation.<br>
Line B comprises a filtered, or statistically analyzed resolver learn value,<br>
which has an initial offset of ten degrees electrical rotation, which converges<br>
to less than two degrees after forty observations, and converges to near zero<br>
after eighty observations, thus demonstrating the capability of the method<br>
described herein to learn and correct for resolver error.<br><br>
[0068] The invention has been described with specific reference to the<br>
preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
