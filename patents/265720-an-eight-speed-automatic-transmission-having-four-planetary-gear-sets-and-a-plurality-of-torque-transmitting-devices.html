CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/909,614 filed on April 2, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed automatic<br>
transmission having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque<br>
transmitting devices and more particularly to an eight speed automatic<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
[0005] While current automatic transmissions achieve their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved transmission configurations which<br>
exhibit improved performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency,<br>
responsiveness and smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced<br>
size and weight, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an<br>
improved, cost-effective, compact multiple speed automatic transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] An automatic transmission is provided having an input member,<br>
an output member, four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and<br>
a plurality of torque transmitting devices. Each of the planetary gear sets<br>
includes first, second and third members. The torque transmitting devices may<br>
be either clutches or a brake.<br>
[0007] An embodiment of the transmission includes two simple<br>
planetary gear sets and two compound planetary gear sets, four clutches and<br>
one brake.<br>
[0008] Another embodiment of the transmission includes four simple<br>
planetary gear sets, four clutches and one brake.<br>
[0009] Another embodiment of the transmission includes three simple<br>
planetary gear sets and one compound planetary gear set, four clutches and one<br>
brake.<br>
[0010] It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
automatic transmission having four planetary gear sets.<br>
2<br><br>
[0011] It is a further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
automatic transmission having at least eight forward speeds and at least one<br>
reverse.<br>
[0012] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
automatic transmission having four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling<br>
members and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
[0013] It is still a further object of the present invention that each carrier<br>
member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a double-pinion<br>
carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br>
[0014] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
automatic transmission having four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling<br>
members and a plurality of clutches and a brake.<br>
[0015] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
automatic transmission having two compound planetary gear sets and two simple<br>
planetary gear sets.<br>
[0016] Further objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become apparent by reference to the following description and appended<br>
drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to the same component, element<br>
or feature.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0028] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets. These permanent mechanical<br>
connections relate the transmission embodiments. A first component or element<br>
of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or<br>
element of a second planetary gear set. A second component or element of the<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or<br>
element of the second planetary gear set. The second component or element of<br>
the second planetary gear set is also permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or element of a third planetary gear set. A third component or<br>
element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a ground,<br>
stationary element, or a transmission housing.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever<br>
diagram is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device<br>
such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary<br>
5<br><br>
gear set wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear<br>
are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate<br>
ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between<br>
the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal<br>
lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented<br>
as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0030] The automatic transmission 10 includes an input shaft or<br>
member 12, a first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a<br>
second node 14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third<br>
planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B<br>
and a third node 18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 20A, a second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or<br>
member 22.<br>
[0031] The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
coupled to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18. The third node<br>
6<br><br>
14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to ground or the transmission<br>
housing 50. The first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to<br>
first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18. The second node 16B of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to second node 18B of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. The third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20 is<br>
coupled to the input shaft or member 12. The output shaft or member 22 is<br>
coupled to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18.<br>
[0032] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the second node 16B of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the third node 16C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 to the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the third node 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the first node 20A of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20 to the first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14. A brake 34<br>
selectively connects the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to<br>
the ground or transmission housing 50.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
7<br><br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0034] For example, planetary gear set 14 includes a ring gear member<br>
14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B and a sun gear member 14C. Ring gear<br>
member 14A is connected for common rotation with a first interconnecting shaft<br>
or member 42. The planet gear carrier member 14B rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 14D (only one shown) and is connected for common rotation with a<br>
second interconnecting shaft or member 44. The sun gear member 14C is<br>
connected to the ground or transmission housing 50 through a third shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 46. Planet gears 14D are each configured to intermesh<br>
with sun gear member 14C and ring gear member 14A.<br>
[0035] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0036] Planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16C, a<br>
planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 16D and<br>
a ring gear member 16A. Sun gear member 16C is connected for common<br>
rotation with a fourth interconnecting shaft or member 48. Planet carrier member<br>
16B is connected for common rotation with a fifth interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 52. Ring gear member 16A is connected for common rotation with a<br>
sixth interconnecting shaft or member 54. Planet gears 16D are each configured<br>
to intermesh with both sun gear member 16C and ring gear member 16A.<br>
8<br><br>
[0037] Planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18C, a ring<br>
gear member 18A and a planet carrier member 18B that rotatably supports a first<br>
set of planet gears 18D and a second set of planet gears 18E. Sun gear<br>
member 18C is connected for common rotation with output shaft or member 22.<br>
Ring gear member 18A is connected for common rotation with second<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 44 and sixth interconnecting shaft or member<br>
54. Planet carrier member 18B is connected for common rotation with fifth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 52. First set of planet gears 18D are configured<br>
to intermesh with both sun gear member 18C and second set of planet gears<br>
18E. Second set of planet gears 18E are configured to intermesh with both ring<br>
gear member 18A and first set of planet gears 18D.<br>
[0038] Planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20C, a ring<br>
gear member 20A and a planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a first<br>
set of planet gears 20D and a second set of planet gears 20E. Sun gear<br>
member 20C is connected for common rotation with the input shaft or member<br>
12. Ring gear member 20A is connected for common rotation with a seventh<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 60. Planet carrier member 20B is connected for<br>
common rotation with an eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62 and a ninth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 58. First set of planet gears 20D are configured<br>
to intermesh with both sun gear member 20C and second set of planet gears<br>
20E. Second set of planet gears 20E are configured to intermesh with both ring<br>
gear member 20A and first set of planet gears 20D.<br>
9<br><br>
[0039] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect input shaft or member 12 to<br>
fifth interconnecting shaft or member 52. Second clutch 28 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect seventh interconnecting shaft or member 60 to fourth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 48. Third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect eighth interconnecting shaft or member 62 to fourth interconnecting shaft<br>
or member 48. Fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable to connect seventh<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 60 to first interconnecting shaft or member 42.<br>
Brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect ninth interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 58 to transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation of shaft or member 58<br>
relative to housing 50.<br>
[0040] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at<br>
least eight forward speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or<br>
torque ratio. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by<br>
engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first<br>
clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32 and brake 34), as<br>
will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various<br>
combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are activated or engaged to<br>
10<br><br>
achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear<br>
states are also presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical<br>
values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges<br>
to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the automatic<br>
transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the<br>
embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other<br>
gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and<br>
gear configuration selected.<br>
[0041] To establish reverse gear, first clutch 26, fourth clutch 32 and<br>
brake 34, and are engaged or activated. First clutch 26 connects input shaft or<br>
member 12 to fifth interconnecting shaft or member 52. Fourth clutch 32<br>
connects seventh interconnecting shaft or member 60 to first interconnecting<br>
shaft or member 42. Brake 34 connects ninth interconnecting shaft or member<br>
58 to transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation of shaft or member 58 relative to<br>
housing 50. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different<br>
combinations of clutch engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0042] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e.,<br>
changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake<br>
engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>

[0043] Referring now to FIG. 4, another embodiment of an automatic<br>
transmission is illustrated and indicated by reference number 100. Automatic<br>
transmission 100 includes an input shaft or member 112, a first planetary gear<br>
set 114 having three nodes: a first node 114A, a second node 114B and a third<br>

118C, a fourth planetary gear set 120 having three nodes: a first node 120A, a<br>
second node 120B and a third node 120C and an output shaft or member 122.<br>
[0044] The second node 114B of the first planetary gear set 114 is<br>
coupled to the first node 116A of the second planetary gear set 116. The third<br>
node 114C of the first planetary gear set 114 is coupled to ground or the<br>
transmission housing 150. The first node 116A of the second planetary gear set<br>
116 is coupled to the second node 118B of the third planetary gear set 118. The<br>
second node 116B of the second planetary gear set 116 is coupled to the third<br>
node 118C of the third planetary gear set 118. The second node 120B of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120 is coupled to the input shaft or member 112. The<br>
output shaft or member 122 is coupled to the second node 116B of the second<br>
planetary gear set 116.<br>
[0045] A first clutch 126 selectively connects the third node 116C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 116 to the second node 120B of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 120 and the input shaft 112. A second clutch 128 selectively connects<br>
the third node 116C of the second planetary gear set 116 to the third node 120C<br>
12<br><br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 120. A third clutch 130 selectively connects the<br>
first node 118A of the third planetary gear set 118 to the third node 120C of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120. A fourth clutch 132 selectively connects the first<br>
node 120A of the fourth planetary gear set 120 to the first node 114A of the first<br>
planetary gear set 114. A brake 134 selectively connects the first node 120A of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 120 to the ground or transmission housing 150.<br>
[0046] Referring now to FIG. 5, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 100 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 5, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 4 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0047] For example, planetary gear set 114 includes sun gear member<br>
114A, planet gear carrier member 114B and ring gear member 114C. Sun gear<br>
member 114A is connected for common rotation with a first interconnecting shaft<br>
or member 142. The planet gear carrier member 114B rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 114D (only one shown) and is connected for common rotation with a<br>
second interconnecting shaft or member 144. Planet gears 114D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with sun gear member 114A and ring gear member<br>
114C. Ring gear member 114C is connected to the ground or transmission<br>
housing 150 through a third interconnecting shaft or member 146.<br>
13<br><br>
[0048] The input shaft or member 112 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 122 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>

[0053] Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the operation of the<br>

134), as will be explained below. FIG. 6 is a truth table presenting the various<br>
combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are activated or engaged to<br>
achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear<br>
states are also presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical<br>
values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges<br>
to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the automatic<br>
transmission 100. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the<br>
embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 6. Of course, other<br>
gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and<br>
gear configuration selected.<br>
[0054] To establish reverse gear, third clutch 130, fourth clutch 132<br>

to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the automatic<br>

embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 9. Of course, other<br>
