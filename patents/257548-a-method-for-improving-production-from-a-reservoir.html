APPARATUS, METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPROVED RESERVOIR SIMULATION USING AN ALGEBRAIC CASCADING CLASS LINEAR SOLVER<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This claims priority from US Provisional Patent Application 60/690,319 filed June 14, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to apparatuses, methods and systems for use in reservoir simulation. In particular, the invention provides methods, apparatuses and systems for more effectively and efficiently simulating fluid flow in reservoirs using an algebraic cascading class linear solver.<br>
Beclouds<br>
Reservoir simulation often requires the numerical solution of the equations that describe the physics governing the complex behaviors of multi-component, multiphase fluid flow in natural porous media in the reservoir and other types of fluid flow elsewhere in the production system. The governing equations typically used to describe the fluid flow are based on the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium and the principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, as described in Asia &amp; Setter, 1977- The complexity of the physics that govern reservoir fluid flow leads to systems of coupled nonlinear partial diffeential equations that are not amiable to conventional analytical methods. As a result, numerical solution techniques are necessary.<br>
A variety of mathematical models, formulations, discrimination methods, and solution strategies have been developed and are associated with a grid imposed upon an area of interest in a reservoir. Detailed discussions of the problems of reservoir simulation and the equations dealing with such problems can be found, for example, in a POT pub shed patent application to Exxon Mobil, International Publication No. WO 01/40937, incorporated herein by reference and in U.S. Patent No. 6,662,146 Bl, incorporated herein by reference. If a grid imposed upon an area of interest in a reservoir is used, the grid may be structured or unstructured. Such grids are comprised of cells, each cell having one or more unknown properties, but with all<br><br>
the cells in the grid having pressure as an unknown. Other unknowing properties include, but are not limited to, fluid properties such as water saturation or temperature, for example, or to "rock properties," such as permeability or porosity to name a few. A cell treated as if it has only a single unknown (typically pressure) is called herein a "single variable cell," while a cell with more than one unknown is called herein a "multi-variable cell."<br>
A matrix can be constructed to represent the girded region of interest based on the different types of cells.<br>
I The following equation is used to solve for the unknown variables, called x:<br><br>
where x is a block vector of the variables representing unknown properties of the cells and b is a block vector of known quantities. Block vector x and block vector b are the same length. Approaches to solving this problem include: Domain Multisector Decomposition (Cleve Ashcraft), Wire basket Domain Decomposition (Barry Smith), Hierarchical interface decomposition (Henson &amp; Sad), and GMRES (Sad &amp; Shultz). But the problem specifically addressed by the current invention includes solving linear systems associated with large-scale heterogeneous problems for both structured and unstructured grids. The solution must be robust, computationally efficient with excellent convergence rate. The focus is on developing a scalable (i.e., efficient for very large problems) multi-level algebraic approach that relies completely on information contained in the linear system of equations that must be solved. Moreover, it is also essential that the solution be well suited for parallel computation. These requirements pose a great challenge, especially for strongly heterogeneous unstructured-grid problems, and existing methods, including Licomplete Upper-Lower (ILU) factorization and nested factorization, fall well short of meeting all of ties essential requirements.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
I In view of the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide methods, apparatuses and systems for more effectively and efficiently assimilating fluid flow in reservoirs while eliminating or minimizing the impact of the problems and limitations described.<br><br>
Wile some of the description herein is focused upon dealing with linear system of equations governing the pressure in general-purpose reservoir simulation problems, the present invention is also applicable to AIM (adaptive implicit method) and filly implicit linear systems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and other embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that those of skill in the art will readily see other embodiments and changes may be made without departing fiow the scope of the invention.<br>
FIG, la illustrates a representation of a reservoir 10, with a section 12, which is depicted in an exploded (two dimensional) view in FiG. lb. Reservoirs 10 (below he water table) typically contain fluid 20, such as oil, gas, water or a mixture of two Dr three of those substances filling the pore spaces between the porous media 22  such as, for example, sandstone or limestone) that makes up the rock of the ■reservoir.<br><br>
FIG. 2 depicts a flowchart of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. After starting 100, the first step is to grid 110 a region of interest into cells, each cell having a node in its center. Represent 120 a graph of the cell nodes by a sparse matrix:<br><br>
where n is the total number of cells. FiG. 2 is further discussed herein.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a three-dimensional view of a region of interest 25 in a reservoir (not separately depicted in FiG. 3), finely gridded in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The grid 30 divides the region of interest 25 into cells 35, each cell 35 having a node 40 (only one depicted in FlG. 3) at its center. Although a structured grid is depicted in FiG. 3, the gridding of this invention may be structured or unstructured. Given a grid, the equations that describe the physics are decretive on this grid (there are many different discretization schemes that one can employ). The result can be represented as a graph (i.e., nodes and edges). This "graph" is a complete, yet quite general, representation that is valid regardless of the nature of underlying grid (e.g., structured or unstructured) or the method of discrediting the equations on that grid.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a two-dimensional view of a region of interest 25 in a reservoir (not separately depicted in FiG. 4), finely gridded in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. As with Fig. 3, the grid 30 divides the region of interest 25 into cells 35. The fine grid 30 in Pig. 4 is 49 by 49. The center of each cell 35 in FiG. 4 is a node 40 but the nodes are not separately depicted in FiG, 4.<br>
Each node 40 is a mathematical center of a cell. One may connect nodes of the cells in a nodal graph.<br>
I FIG. 5 depicts a preferred embodiment of the present invention with a simpUfied, two-dimensional view of a region of interest 25 in a reservoir, the region of interest 25 having been gridded into cells, such as cell 45, each cell 45 having a node at its center. Nodal graphs 50, 55 (which have the graph lines passing through the nodes of the cells) are imposed upon the grid in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The grid in FIG. 5 includes an eight by eight, coarse nodal graph 50, superimposed on a 49 by 49 fine nodal graph 55.  This results in eighty-<br><br>
one domains 60, having overlap 65 on the Hines of the eight by eight nodal graph. FIG. 5 also depicts intersections 63, edges 65 and vertices, such as vertex 70, of the nodal graphs. Three dimensional examples would also include faces, not depicted in Flag’s.<br>
The overlaps 65 depicted in FiG. 5, which separate domains from each other, are also called multisectors.   Adding a domain to its multisectors, yields overlapped<br>
domains, D..<br>
Referring back to FiG, 2, impose 130 an initial decomposition of the graph into a pre-specified number of overlapped domains, such that each cell exists in at least one overlapped domain. In FiG. 5, the pre-specified number of domains would be the eighty-one (81) overlapped domains 60. The next step in FiG. 2 is to number 140 the cells and the overlapped domains. Every cell has a key, which is a set of the domain numbers to which the cell belongs. Each cell has a class; the class of each cell is the number of elements (domain numbers) in its key. For example, individual cells having nodes (such nodes represented by dots in FiG. 5) at (mere) intersections 63 of the nodal graph, such as cell 45, are each only in one domain, with a class of one. Cells having their nodes (such nodes represented as circles in FiG. 5) on the edges 65 are in two overlapping domains with a class of two, while cells at graph nodes (such graph nodes represented as triangles in FlG. 5) at the vertices 70 are in four overlapping domains, with a class of four.<br>
I Referring again to FiG, 2, the next step is to group 150 the cells into connectors, each connector having a class, with each connector being the set of cells that share the same key. The class of each coimectbr is the number of clematis in the key of the connector.  A connector of class n will thus separate cormectors of class n-1 or<br>
lower.<br>
I FIG, 6 depicts a simpUfied two-dimensional view of a group of connectors 200,210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each connector being the set of cells having the same key. In FiG. 6, connector 200 is the set of cells having key [1] (that is, connector 200 includes cells that are only in overlapped domain one), cormector 210 is the set of cells having key [2] (that is connector 210 includes cells that are only in overlapped domain one, cormector 220 is the set of cells having key [3], connector 230 is the set<br><br>
of cells having key [4], connector 240 (cells that are heavily vertically striped) is the set of cells having key [1,2] (that is, connector 240 includes cells that are in both overlapped domain one and overlapped domain two), connector 250 (cells that are heavily horizontally striped) is the set of cells having key [2,3], connector 260 (cells that are vertically striped) is the set of cells having key [3,4], connector 270 (cells that are horizontally striped) is the set of cells having key [4,1], and connector 280 is the set having a single cell (that is dotted) at a vertex which has key [1,2,3,4]. Connectors 200, 210, 220 and 230 are in class one and individual cells that make up these connectors are not depicted. Connectors 240, 250, 260 and 270 are in class 2 and separate connectors of class 1, which are neighbors of connectors 240, 250, 260 and 270. Connector 280 is in class 4 and separates connectors of classes 1 and 2. Connector 280 is a connector of the maximum class, which in the example of FiG. 6, is the class of four.<br>
The relationship among cells can be represented mathematically. Let D. r = 1 <br>
denote a collection of sets. Each set contains the cell (or node) numbers corresponding to a domain or region of the grid (or nodal graph). These domains may be overlapped or non-overlapped by various well known methods previously mentioned and the union of all m regions is the entire grid (or nodal graph). For each cell   denote the set of all domains which contain cell i. K. is<br>
called the key of cell i. Let V denote a set and let |^^| denote the number of elements<br>
in set V, The class c,. of cell i denotes the number of domains which contain cell i:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
A locally maximum class conductor is defined as a connector whose class is greater than the class of each of its neighboring connectors. Referring again to FiG. 2, the next step in the ACC decomposition is to reset 165 the class /r^. of all locally<br>
maximum class connectors Bj, to q, which is (he maximum class of any connector.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, referring again to FiG. 2, all maximum class connectors are forced 168 to contain only one cell. This is done by selecting one cell from each locally maximum class connector, deleting each one from its containing connector and forming a new connector of class q+1 from each selected ceil. Then reset q to the value q+1.<br>
The result of steps 160 and 165 on the subset of connectors depicted in FiG. 6 is depicted in FiG. 12. In FiG. 12, connectors 240, 250, 260 and 270 each have only one neighboring higher order connector (which is connector 280 for each of these), so each of connectors 240, 250, 260 and 270 have each been merged with connector 280 to form one large connector. (This is represented in FiG. 12 by all the cells in connectors 240, 250, 260 and 270 having the same dotted pattern.) Connectors 200, 210, 220 and 230 (the cells of which are not separately depicted) have more than one hiker order neighboring connector, so connectors 200, 210, 220 and 230 are left unchanged.<br>
For the step of 168, the cell originally forming connector 280 (see FiG, 6) could be selected, a new connector with the original connector 280 cell alone would then be<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The ACC algebraic coarse grid matrix RAP is sparse and much smaller (perhaps by<br>
one or more orders of magnitude) titian A and thus the coarse grid linear solution may be performed in highly efficient fashion using either direct solution or iterative solutions using methods such as preconditioned GMRES or ORTHOMIN, or other inexact local solves such as block ILU(K), Nested Factorization, Line Gauss-Seidel. See Y. Said and M. H. Schultz.: "GMRES: a generalized minimal residual algorithm for solving nonsymmetrical linear systems", SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 7, PP 856-869, 1986; Winsome, "P.K.W: "Rothmans, an Iterative Method for Solving Sparse Sets of Simultaneous Linear Equations", SPE 5729 presented at the Fourth Symposium of Numerical Simulation of Reservoir Performance of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of AIME held in Los Angeles, Calf, Feb. 19-20,1976, all incorporated by reference.<br>
The overall convergence rate of the preconditioning of the instant invention is typically greatly superior to commonly used methods such as ILU, Also the method is applicable to matrices arising from structured or unstructured grids including one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-dimensional grids. In addition the method is applicable to matrices  itch one or more unknowns per cell (node).<br><br>
