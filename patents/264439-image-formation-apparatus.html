DESCRIPTION<br>
IMAGE FORMATION APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an image formation<br>
apparatus such as a copier, printer, facsimile machine,<br>
multi-function device, and more particularly to an image formation<br>
apparatus provided with a function of removing an image from a<br>
recording material where the image is formed after image<br>
information on the recording material is used.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the spread of printers, analog copying machines,<br>
digital copying machines, printers, and the like employing<br>
electrophotography, ink-jet recording methods, and thermal<br>
transfer recording methods, a large amount of paper has been<br>
consumed. Paper generally used as recording materials is made<br>
from pulp gained from wood as recyclable resources. In a process<br>
for manufacturing paper, a lot of energy is consumed so as to<br>
extract cellulose fiber from wood in a pulping process and to dry<br>
paper in a papermaking step.<br>
Although destructive lumbering for manufacturing<br>
paper has been reduced because of growing awareness of<br>
environmental issues, all paper is not made from wood logged from<br><br>
2<br>
managed forests, so that it is an important social issue to prevent<br>
further deterioration of the global environment by protecting<br>
forests through control on paper consumption.<br>
Further, because paper contains inorganic components<br>
which are noncombustible and imputrescible, when paper is disposed<br>
of, waste requiring landfilling is generated at a certain rate.<br>
However, it has become difficult to find waste landfill sites,<br>
so that the control on paper consumption is an important social<br>
issue also in this point of view.<br>
In order to deal with these problems, in conventional<br>
methods, when paper on which information is recorded is no longer<br>
necessary, such paper is collected and dissolved into pulp at paper<br>
factories for recycling. Although these methods require no wood<br>
resources any further, substantially the same energy is consumed<br>
for transportation for collection, re-pulping, and<br>
re-papermaking as in a case where paper is manufactured from fresh<br>
pulp. Moreover, paper made from recycled pulp has quality<br>
problems such as reduced rigidity and whiteness, bleeding upon<br>
printing, and the like, so that a mix rate of recycled pulp in<br>
high-quality paper conventionally used as paper for recording<br>
information must be limited to about 30%. Further, upon<br>
collecting and recycling paper as recording materials on which<br>
information is recorded, paper on which information is recorded<br>
is circulated outside companies and outside homes which are<br>
uncontrolled areas, so that this poses problems in terms of<br><br>
3<br>
confidentiality maintenance and privacy protection.<br>
In recent years, management of information such as<br>
personal information has been strictly required, and it is desired<br>
that recording materials having information be not distributed<br>
outside each of information control areas including rooms, floors,<br>
divisions, buildings, offices, and the like.<br>
As a method for resolving the above-mentioned<br>
problems, there have been proposed a method and a device for<br>
removing an image on a recording material that has been used so<br>
as to reuse the recording material. For example, as a method for<br>
removing a formed image on a recording material by transferring<br>
the image to an image peeling member, Patent Document 1 discloses<br>
a method and a device in which paper on which an image is formed<br>
by electrophotography is impregnated with liquid containing water,<br>
the paper and the image peeling member are brought into pressure<br>
contact in a heated status while adhesion between the paper to<br>
be used as a recording material and an image forming substance<br>
is reduced, and the image forming substance having<br>
thermoplasticity is separated and removed from the paper.<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses a recording material<br>
having a mold release agent on a surface having a sheet-like shape,<br>
in which a mark is attached so as to discriminate from regular<br>
paper. Patent Document 3 discloses a device in which an endless<br>
belt having heat-melting resin on a surface thereof is used and<br>
an image formed on a recording material processed using release<br><br>
4<br>
agent is separated and removed by thermal transfer. Patent<br>
Documents 4 and 5 disclose a method and a device in which an image<br>
on a recording material is removed by abrading and polishing the<br>
image using a grinding stone, a rubber roller, and the like so<br>
as to reuse the recording material on which the image is formed<br>
by electrophotography.<br>
Other than the above-mentioned methods, there have<br>
been proposed various types of methods for removing or eliminating<br>
color of images. However, in any of these methods, applicable<br>
image forming substances, recording materials, image formation<br>
processes are limited when images are desired to be completely<br>
removed. Thus, when a recording material on which an image is<br>
formed by various types of image formation apparatuses is mixed<br>
in an image removal device, or various types of recording materials<br>
are mixed in the image removal device, depending on combinations<br>
other than specific combinations, levels of removal and color<br>
elimination of images are reduced, so that image information<br>
remaining after an image removal process may be readable or a<br>
number of times allowed for repeatedly using the recording<br>
materials may be reduced.<br>
Patent Documents 5, 6, and 7 disclose examples of<br>
using the image formation apparatus and the image removal device<br>
integrally or in combination. In these Patent Documents, images<br>
are recorded on recording materials immediately after the image<br>
forming substances are removed by the image removal device from<br><br>
5<br>
the recording materials.<br>
As disclosed in these Patent Documents, by using the<br>
image formation apparatus and the image removal device integrally<br>
or in a connected manner, the necessity of setting again the<br>
recording materials in the image formation apparatus is eliminated.<br>
However, it is not possible to prevent mixing of recording<br>
materials other than those having an image formed by a specific<br>
image formation apparatus.<br>
In Patent Document 8, the applicant proposed an image<br>
formation and removal system in which only a specific recording<br>
material on which an image is formed in a specific image formation<br>
process by a specific image formation apparatus is subjected to<br>
an image removal process, so that image forming substances on the<br>
recording material are securely removed and it is possible to<br>
prevent generation of jam and the like resulting from failure of<br>
separation of the recording material and an image peeling member<br>
which may be occurred in a process for removing the image forming<br>
substances.<br>
However, even when the image formation apparatus and<br>
the image removal device are integrated, few proposal to<br>
sufficiently utilize characteristics of the integrated image<br>
formation apparatus and the image removal device has been made.<br>

information is formed through an interrupt control using the<br>
manual paper feed unit employed for image formation.<br>
According to the present invention, a reusable medium<br><br>
16<br>
includes a recording material to which at least one agent having<br>
repellency to image forming substance is provided so as to reduce<br>
fixation on an image forming substance. Thus, it is possible to<br>
form an image on the reusable medium when image information formed<br>
on the recording material is used only for a short period of time<br>
and to form an image on general recording material in other cases.<br>
And, it is possible to provide a system including an image<br>
formation function and an image removal function with a simple<br>
structure at low cost and reduced environmental load along with<br>
effects mentioned above.<br>
According to the present invention, the image<br>
formation apparatus includes: the first paper feed cassette<br>
storing the reusable medium; and the second paper feed cassette<br>
storing the general recording material. Thus, it is possible to<br>
form an image on the reusable medium when image information formed<br>
on the recording material is used only for a short period of time<br>
and to form an image on general recording material in other cases.<br>
And, it is possible to provide a system including an image<br>
formation function and an image removal function with a simple<br>
structure at low cost and reduced environmental load along with<br>
effects mentioned above.<br>
According to the present invention, the image<br>
formation apparatus includes: the selection unit allowing a user<br>
to select a first image formation mode for forming an image on<br>
the reusable medium and a second image formation mode for forming<br><br>
17<br>
an image on the general recording material; and the control unit<br>
performing control so as to form an image on the reusable medium<br>
when the first image formation mode is selected and to form an<br>
image on the general recording material when the second image<br>
formation mode is selected using the selection unit. Thus, when<br>
the user is assumed in advance to use image information formed<br>
on the recording material only for a short period of time, it is<br>
possible to form an image on the reusable medium securely capable<br>
of being subjected to the image removal process so as to reduce<br>
environmental load and to provide a system including the image<br>
formation function and the image removal function with a simple<br>
structure at low cost and reduced environmental load along with<br>
the effects mentioned above.<br>
According to the present invention, the reusable<br>
medium has discrimination information for recognizing<br>
reusability of the reusable medium, the first conveying path for<br>
supplying the recording material to the image formation unit and<br>
the second conveying path for supplying the recording material<br>
to the image removal device partially share a common path for<br>
conveying the recording material, and the recognition unit judging<br>
the discrimination information of the reusable medium is disposed<br>
on the common path for conveying the recording material. Thus,<br>
it is not necessary to dispose a recognition unit dedicated only<br>
to the image removal device. Further, the path for conveying the<br>
recording material is shared with the image formation apparatus<br><br>
18<br>
and the image removal device, so that it is possible to provide<br>
an image formation and removal system with a simple structure at<br>
low cost and reduced environmental load.<br>
According to the present invention, in the image<br>
formation apparatus, an image is formed in the image formation<br>
unit when a recording material appropriate for an image formation<br>
mode is detected before recording materials inappropriate for the<br>
image formation mode selected using the selection unit are<br>
successively detected for a predetermined number of times, and<br>
an image formation operation by the image formation unit is stopped<br>
when inappropriate recording materials are successively detected<br>
for the predetermined number of times, and ejection is performed<br>
without performing the image formation operation when<br>
inappropriate recording materials are successively detected for<br>
less than the predetermined number of times. Thus, even when the<br>
user erroneously mixes general paper in the first paper feed<br>
cassette where only those reusable media must be stored or when<br>
the user erroneously mixes a reusable medium in the second paper<br>
feed cassette where only general paper must be stored by contrast,<br>
it is possible to form an image on an intended recording material<br>
and complete an image formation operation. When inappropriate<br>
recording materials are detected successively for a set number<br>
of times, an image formation operation is stopped, so that it is<br>
possible to avoid unnecessary conveying of a recording material<br>
when the user erroneously sets a large amount of recording<br><br>
19<br>
materials in the paper feed cassette. Further, an image to be<br>
removed is securely formed on the reusable medium, so that it is<br>
possible to reduce an amount of paper consumption and<br>
environmental load and to securely form image information on<br>
general paper so as to distribute such information required to<br>
be formed on general paper to customers, outside companies, or<br>
outside divisions.<br>
According to the present invention, the image<br>
formation apparatus includes a warning unit outputting warning<br>
information for notifying that an inappropriate recording<br>
material is set when inappropriate recording materials are<br>
successively detected by the recognition unit for a predetermined<br>
number of times. Thus, it is possible to notify the user that<br>
the inappropriate recording material is set and prompt the user<br>
to set an appropriate recording material.<br>
According to the present invention, the<br>
discrimination information in the reusable medium includes<br>
discrimination information recorded in an IC chip disposed on the<br>
reusable medium in an integrated manner. Thus, it is possible<br>
to store various types of information concerning the reusable<br>
medium and provide various types of detection forms, thereby<br>
readily managing reusable media.<br>
According to the present invention, even when an image<br>
removal process operation is being performed successively by the<br>
image removal device, if an image formation instruction is input,<br><br>
20<br>
the image removal process operation is suspended and an image<br>
formation operation is preferentially performed, and then after<br>
the image formation operation is ended, the image removal process<br>
operation is resumed. Thus, the image formation operation and<br>
the image removal operation are not performed at the same time.<br>
Further, excessive power consumption is avoided and complexity<br>
and difficulty of control are eliminated. Moreover, the image<br>
formation operation requiring high speed is promptly performed,<br>
so that reduction of operational efficiency by the user is<br>
minimized even when the image removal operation is performed.<br>
According to the present invention, even when an image<br>
removal process operation is being performed on a recording<br>
material by the image removal device, the recording material being<br>
conveyed from a paper feed cassette disposed on the image formation<br>
apparatus or the image removal device, if an image removal process<br>
instruction is input for a recording material supplied from the<br>
manual paper feed unit, the image removal process operation on<br>
the recording material conveyed from the paper feed cassette is<br>
suspended and an image removal process operation on the recording<br>
material conveyed from the manual paper feed unit is<br>
preferentially performed, and then after the image removal process<br>
operation is ended, the image removal process operation on the<br>
recording material conveyed from the paper feed cassette is<br>
successively resumed. In accordance with this, the user sets the<br>
recording material on which highly-confidential information is<br><br>
21<br>
recorded in the manual paper feed unit and the image removal<br>
process is immediately started. As a result, the image is removed<br>
in the presence of the user and it is possible to confirm whether<br>
reading of such information becomes impossible. Thus, it is<br>
possible to use the image removal device connected to the image<br>
formation apparatus as having the same function as a shredder and<br>
reuse the reusable medium from which the image is removed.<br>
According to the present invention, an interrupt<br>
control is performed such that even when an image formation<br>
operation is being performed successively or an image removal<br>
process operation is being performed successively on a recording<br>
material by the image removal device, the recording material being<br>
conveyed from a paper feed cassette disposed on the image formation<br>
apparatus or the image removal device, if an image removal process<br>
instruction is input for a recording material supplied from the<br>
manual paper feed unit, the image formation operation or the image<br>
removal process operation on the recording material conveyed from<br>
the paper feed cassette is temporarily suspended and an image<br>
removal process operation on the recording material conveyed from<br>
the manual paper feed unit is preferentially performed, and then<br>
after the image removal process operation is ended, the suspended<br>
image formation operation or the image removal process operation<br>
on the recording material conveyed from the paper feed cassette<br>
is resumed. In accordance with this, the user sets the recording<br>
material in which highly-confidential information is recorded in<br><br>
22<br>
the manual paper feed unit and the image removal process is<br>
immediately started. As a result, the image is removed in the<br>
presence of the user and it is possible to confirm whether reading<br>
of such information becomes impossible. Thus, it is possible to<br>
use the image removal device connected to the image formation<br>
apparatus as having the same function as a shredder and reuse the<br>
reusable medium from which the image is removed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described in detail based<br>
on the embodiments illustrated in the drawings. An image<br>
formation apparatus referenced at 1 in FIG. 1 shows an example<br>
of a color image formation apparatus for forming an image by<br>
electrophotography and a method for forming an image and elements<br>
of the apparatus are well-known as a tandem type color<br>
electrophotographic device. This image formation apparatus is<br>
assumed to have functions of a digital multi-function device. In<br>
order to add a copying function, a scanner unit used as an image<br>
reading device not shown in the drawings is added other than a<br>
structure shown in FIG. 1. When the image formation apparatus<br>
is used as a facsimile machine, a communication interface and a<br>
memory unit storing information (not shown in the drawings) are<br>
added. When the image formation apparatus is used as a printer,<br>
a data input unit and a memory unit storing information are added<br>
in the same manner.<br>
In FIG. 1, a portion surrounded by a housing A used<br>
as an apparatus body shows an image formation apparatus 1 including<br>
an image formation unit IB and a portion surrounded by a housing<br>
B shows an image removal device 2 installed on and detached from<br>
the housing A of the image formation apparatus 1.<br>
The image formation unit IB is configured to form an<br><br>
25<br>
image by electrophotography in which toner images of yellow (Y) ,<br>
magenta (M) , cyan (C) , and black (K) are formed on photoconductors<br>
as separate image carriers, respectively, the toner images formed<br>
on each photoconductor are transferred to an intermediate transfer<br>
body and the images transferred to the intermediate transfer body<br>
are transferred to a recording material conveyed from a paper feed<br>
unit, and the toner images formed on the recorded medium are heated<br>
and pressurized for fixation by a fixation unit 140.<br>
A drum unit used as stations for forming images of<br>
each of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K) is<br>
constructed using elements of a conventionally used<br>
electrophotographic device. In other words, the drum unit<br>
includes: drum-like or belt-like photoconductors 101Y, 101M, 101C,<br>
and 101K in which metal and the like having a photoconductor layer<br>
is used as a substrate; charging units 102Y, 102M, 102C, and 102K<br>
including a charging roller, a wire charger, and the like, the<br>
charging units 102Y, 102M, 102C, and 102K uniformly charging the<br>
photoconductors 101Y, 101M, 101C, and 101K; a light irradiation<br>
unit (not shown in the drawings) exposing each of uniformly charged<br>
photoconductors in accordance with an image to be formed such as<br>
laser, LED, light emitter-liquid crystal light valve; developers<br>
103Y, 103M, 103C, and 103K internally having a magnetic roller<br>
and a toner conveying roller, the developers 103Y, 103M, 103C,<br>
and 103K creating visual images of electrostatic latent images<br>
using powder toner formed on each photoconductor through the light<br><br>
26<br>
irradiation; corona wire chargers 105Y, 105M, 105C, and 105K<br>
controlling charge of toner powder images formed on each<br>
photoconductor; electric field applying units 106Y, 106M, 106C,<br>
and 106K including a roller or a corona wire for transferring toner<br>
powder images formed on each photoconductor to an intermediate<br>
transfer belt 117 as an intermediate transfer body; cleaning units<br>
107Y, 107M, 107C, and 107K removing powder toner remaining on each<br>
photoconductor after transfer, and the like.<br>
In addition to these constituent elements, it is<br>
possible to add a suitable and conventionally used element as<br>
appropriate. For example, in order to remove electric charge on<br>
each photoconductor after images are transferred, it is possible<br>
to dispose an electricity removal unit such as an<br>
alternating-current charger, a light irradiator, and the like.<br>
Also, it is possible to construct a control system in which a<br>
voltage detection unit detecting voltage charged on each<br>
photoconductor and a voltage control unit controlling voltage<br>
applied to the charger are disposed such that surface potential<br>
charged on each photoconductor is maintained at a constant level<br>
even in a case of deterioration resulting from an environmental<br>
change or repetition of use. When removal of toner on each<br>
photoconductor is unnecessary after images are transferred, it<br>
is possible to eliminate the cleaning units 107Y, 107M, 107C, and<br>
107K. Further, when charging the toner powder images formed on<br>
each photoconductor is unnecessary, it is possible to eliminate<br><br>
27<br>
the corona wire chargers 105Y, 105M, 105C, and 105K.<br>
The intermediate transfer belt 117 is an endless belt<br>
mainly made of resin having a volume resistivity of about 10B to<br>
1012 Qcm. The intermediate transfer belt 117 is disposed so as<br>
to have inscribed circles of rollers 111, 112, 113, and 114 and<br>
is provided with suitable tension from a tension application<br>
mechanism not shown in the drawings. In order to remove toner<br>
remaining on the intermediate transfer belt 117, a belt cleaning<br>
unit such as a brush, roller, or the like removing powder toner<br>
on a belt surface may be disposed on the periphery of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 117 . Further, depending on necessity,<br>
an electricity removal unit or a charge unit may be disposed so<br>
as to remove or uniform electric charge remaining on the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 117 after powder toner is transferred<br>
to a recording material.<br>
A recording material 171 (a to d) or a recording<br>
material 172 where a final image is formed is stored in plural<br>
paper feed cassettes 161a, 161b, 161c, and 161d disposed on a paper<br>
feed unit 161 positioned below the image formation unit IB or<br>
stored in a manual paper feed tray 162 constituting a manual paper<br>
feed unit disposed on a lateral face of the housing A as shown<br>
in FIG. 2. In accordance with conditions and the like selected<br>
by the user, one of the paper feed cassettes or the manual paper<br>
feed tray 162 is selected and the recording material 171 (a to<br>
d) or the recording material 172 is sent to a first conveying path<br><br>
28<br>
50 via paper feed runners 160a, 160b, 160c, and 160d disposed in<br>
the vicinity of each paper feed cassette or a paper feed runner<br>
160e disposed in the vicinity of the manual paper feed tray 162,<br>
the first conveying path 50 supplying the recording material to<br>
the image formation unit IB. The recording material 171 (a to<br>
d) or the recording material 172 that has been fed is conveyed<br>
to the image formation unit IB via pairs of paper feed rollers<br>
166a, 166b, 166c, 166d, 170a, 170b, 170c, 170d, 170e, and 170f<br>
disposed on the first conveying path 50.<br>
The toner powder images formed on the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 117 are transferred to the recording material 171<br>
(a to d) or the recording material 172 in an image transfer unit<br>
where an electric field application unit 180 such as a voltage<br>
application roller, a corona wire charger, and the like is<br>
disposed.<br>
The toner powder images transferred on the recording<br>
material 171 (a to d) or the recording material 172 are softened<br>
and fixed by the fixation unit 140 including a heating member 141<br>
such as a thermal belt or a heating roller internally having a<br>
heating unit 143 such as a halogen lamp and a pressure roller 142<br>
having a silicone rubber layer on a surface thereof. A recording<br>
material 173 on which the toner images are fixed are ejected to<br>
a paper ejection tray 163 disposed on a top portion of the housing<br>
A via a pair of rollers 170g for conveying a recording material<br>
and a pair of paper ejection rollers 167.<br><br>
29<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, above the paper feed cassette 161a,<br>
there are disposed a collection tray 164 for collecting non-image<br>
recording material 171 (a to d), a collection conveying path 54<br>
for connecting the first conveying path 50 to the collection tray<br>
164, a pair of collection rollers 168 disposed on the collection<br>
conveying path 54, and a guide unit 220 guiding the recording<br>
material in the first conveying path 50 to the collection conveying<br>
path 54. The guide unit 220 is disposed on a branching portion<br>
502 between the first conveying path 50 and the collection<br>
conveying path 54 as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The guide unit 220 includes a guide flap 222 disposed<br>
on a rotation shaft 221 and a driving unit 223 switching a position<br>
of the guide flap 222 by rotating the rotation shaft 221. The<br>
guide flap 222 is configured to be positioned at a conveying<br>
position for conveying the recording material from the first<br>
conveying path 50 to the image formation unit IB, the conveying<br>
position being indicated by a solid line, and at a collection<br>
position for guiding the recording material to the collection<br>
conveying path 54, the collection position being indicated by a<br>
two-dot chain line shown in FIG. 3. These positions are switched<br>
as appropriate by driving the driving unit 223. As shown in FIG.<br>
7, the driving unit 223 is connected to a control unit 80 included<br>
in the image formation apparatus 1 and is driven based on a driving<br>
signal from the control unit 80. The control unit 80 is<br>
constructed using a conventionally used computer including a ROM,<br><br>
30<br>
RAM, CPU, timer, and the like. The control unit 80 controls<br>
driving of the driving unit 223 such that the guide flap 222 is<br>
positioned at the collection position when the recording material<br>
is not a reusable media and positioned at the conveying position<br>
when the recording material is a reusable medium.<br>
Image formation is possible using special toner whose<br>
color is eliminated from light and heat and toner containing wax<br>
components, fluorine resin, silicone resin, surface-active agent,<br>
and the like. However, preferably, toner generally employed for<br>
electrophotography is used so as to form an image in the same image<br>
formation apparatus when an image having preferable fixation is<br>
required for distribution outside the information control areas<br>
such as other divisions or companies, drawing up a contract, and<br>
the like. In other words, in the image formation apparatus 1 and<br>
the image removal device 2, conventionally used toner for<br>
electrophotography may be used as an example of image forming<br>
substances. More specifically, image forming substances<br>
containing the following components may be used.<br>
Examples of conventionally used coloring material<br>
used for image forming substances include:<br>
black pigment such as carbon black, iron oxide, and<br>
the like;<br>
yellow pigment such as C.I. Pigment Yellow 12, C.I.<br>
Pigment Yellow 13, C.I. Pigment Yellow 14, C.I. Pigment Yellow<br>
15, C.I. Pigment Yellow 17, C.I. Pigment Yellow 93, C.I. Pigment<br><br>
31<br>
Yellow 94, C.I. Pigment Yellow 138, C.I. Pigment Yellow 155, C.I.<br>
Pigment Yellow 156, C.I. Pigment Yellow 180, C.I. Pigment Yellow<br>
185, and the like;<br>
magenta pigment such as C.I. Pigment Red 2, C.I.<br>
Pigment Red 3, C.I. Pigment Red 5, C.I. Pigment Red 16, C.I. Pigment<br>
Red 48:1, C.I. Pigment Red 53:1, C.I. Pigment Red 57:1, C.I.<br>
Pigment Red 122, C.I. Pigment Red 123, C.I. Pigment Red 139, C.I.<br>
Pigment Red 144, C.I. Pigment Red 166, C.I. Pigment Red 177, C.I.<br>
Pigment Red 178, C.I. Pigment Red 222, and the like; and<br>
cyan pigment such as C.I. Pigment Blue 15, C.I.<br>
Pigment Blue 15:2, C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3, C.I. Pigment Blue 16,<br>
C.I. Pigment Blue 60, and the like. When powder toner is used<br>
as image forming substances, these coloring materials are used<br>
from 0.5% to 20% by weight, preferably, from 1% to 10% by weight.<br>
When a thermal transfer method is used for the image<br>
removal device 2, preferably, image forming substances having<br>
thermoplasticity is used. Examples of resin components providing<br>
image forming substances with thermoplasticity include<br>
conventionally used toner materials for electrophotography.<br>
In other words, examples of resin components include<br>
polyester resin, styrenes such as polystyrene,<br>
poly-chlorostyrene, polyvinyl toluene, and polymers of<br>
substitution products thereof; styrene copolymers such as<br>
styrene-chlorostyrene copolymer, styrene-propylene copolymer,<br>
styrene-vinyltoluene copolymer, styrene-vinylnaphthalene<br><br>
32<br>
copolymer, styrene-methyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-ethyl<br>
acrylate copolymer, styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer,<br>
styrene-octyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-methyl methacrylate<br>
copolymer, styrene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, styrene-butyl<br>
methacrylate copolymer, styrene-a-methyl chloroacrylate<br>
copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-vinyl<br>
methyl ketone copolymer, styrene-butadiene copolymer,<br>
styrene-isoprene copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile-indene<br>
copolymer, styrene-maleic acid copolymer, styrene-maleic acid<br>
ester copolymer; polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polyester, epoxy resin, epoxy polyol resin,<br>
polyurethane, polyamide, polyvinyl butyral, polyacrylic resin,<br>
rosin, modified rosin, terpene resin, aliphatic or alicyclic<br>
hydrocarbon resin, aromatic petroleum resin, and the like. When<br>
powder toner is used as image forming substances, these coloring<br>
materials are used from 60 to 99.5 % by weight of an entire toner,<br>
preferably, from 80 to 97 % by weight.<br>
When the toner powder images are fixed on the<br>
recording material by a heat fixing unit and the images are removed<br>
through a thermal transfer method in which the toner on the<br>
recording material is transferred to an image peeling member, it<br>
is important that a glass transition point (Tg), fusing<br>
temperature, and viscoelastic property of components of<br>
thermoplastic resin are within a suitable range. When the glass<br><br>
33<br>
transition point ranges from 40 to 100 °C, or preferably from 50<br>
to 70 °C, it is possible to fix at a relatively low temperature,<br>
remove the image forming substances from the recording material,<br>
and obtain preferable preservation stability for the toner.<br>
When measurement frequency is 20 Hz, storage elastic<br>
modulus of the components of thermoplastic resin is 10000 dyne/cm2<br>
preferably at not less than 80 °C, more preferably from 90 to 160<br>
°C.<br>
Conventional materials are used for toner as<br>
appropriate including charge control agent, release agent,<br>
external additive, and the like. Examples of the charge control<br>
agent include nigrosine dye, triphenylmethane dye, molybdic acid<br>
chelate pigment, rhodamine dye, alkoxylamine, quarternary<br>
ammonium salt, fluorine-containing activating agent, metal salt<br>
of salicylic acid, and metal salt of salicylic acid derivative,<br>
and the like.<br>
Components of the release agent are added to as to<br>
prevent adhesion of toner to a fixing roller or a fixing belt<br>
(prevention of hot offset) upon fixing when the heat fixing unit<br>
is used. Examples of waxes to be used as release agent having<br>
a melting point of 60 to 110 °C include carnauba wax, montan wax,<br>
bees wax, paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, and the like.<br>
The external additive is added so as to assist<br>
flowability, development, charge of powder toner and is usually<br>
added so as to cover a surface of particles made of coloring<br><br>
34<br>
material and resin. Examples of inorganic particles to be used<br>
as external additive include silica, alumina, titanium oxide,<br>
barium titanate, magnesium titanate, calcium titanate, strontium<br>
titanate, zinc oxide, tin oxide, silica sand, clay, mica,<br>
wollastonite, diatom earth, chromium oxide, eerie oxide, ferric<br>
oxide, antimony trioxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide,<br>
barium sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, silicon<br>
carbide, silicon nitride, and the like. Preferably, a primary<br>
particle size of these inorganic particles ranges from 2 nm to<br>
5 nm, more preferably from 5 nm to 500 nm. Preferably, an amount<br>
of inorganic particles used in toner ranges from 0.01 to 5 % by<br>
weight of an entire amount of image forming substances, more<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 2.0 % by weight.<br>
Conventional manufacturing methods including mixing<br>
and milling, dispersion polymerization, suspension<br>
polymerization, and the like may be uses as a method for<br>
manufacturing powder of image forming substance from the<br>
above-mentioned materials.<br>
The image formation apparatus 1 according to the<br>
present embodiment is constructed such that the image removal<br>
device 2 is detachably installed as an optional unit on the housing<br>
A. However, the image formation apparatus 1 and the image removal<br>
device 2 may be integrally combined and connected in advance so<br>
as to be constructed as an image formation apparatus.<br>
The image removal device 2 added and connected to the<br><br>
35<br>
housing A as an optional unit employs a thermal transfer method<br>
as an image removal method in which toner on a recording material<br>
is transferred to an image peeling member. In FIGS. 1 and 2, the<br>
recording material from which an image is to be removed after use<br>
of image information formed as an image is stored in the fourth<br>
paper feed cassette 161d in the paper feed unit 161 or set in the<br>
manual paper feed tray 162, for example, and is supplied to the<br>
image formation unit IB.<br>
In the housing A, there are disposed a installation<br>
unit 200 detachably enabling installation of the image removal<br>
device 2 on the housing A and a switch unit 210 switching supply<br>
of the recording material 171 or the recording material 172 to<br>
the image removal device 2 or the image formation apparatus 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the installation unit 200 includes<br>
plural pins 201 and 202 formed on a side plate 1A of the housing<br>
A positioned on a first conveying path 50 side, perforations 203<br>
and 204 formed on a side plate 2A positioned on a side of the<br>
following second and third conveying paths 51 and 52 of the image<br>
removal device 2, the perforations 203 and 204 capable of being<br>
detachably engaged with each pin, and screws not shown in the<br>
drawings. In the present embodiment, the image removal device<br>
2 is positioned when the pins 201 and 202 are inserted into the<br>
perforations 203 and 204, respectively, and is mechanically<br>
installed on the image formation apparatus 1 as shown in FIGS.<br>
1 to 2 using the screws not shown in the drawings. In this case,<br><br>
36<br>
using a connector not shown in the drawings, the control unit 80<br>
disposed on the image formation apparatus 1 and a power supply<br>
not shown in the drawings are connected to the image removal device<br>
2.<br>
In the installation unit 200, instead of the pins 201<br>
and 202 disposed on the side plate 1A of the image formation<br>
apparatus 1, plural opening portions extending in the vertical<br>
or lateral direction may be formed and a hook portion capable of<br>
being detachably engaged with each opening portion may be formed<br>
on the image removal device 2 side. The image removal device 2<br>
may be installed on the housing A by inserting each hook portion<br>
into the opening portion and sliding the hook portion downward<br>
or sliding the hook portion in the lateral direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the switch unit 210 is disposed<br>
on the branching portion 502 between the first conveying path 50<br>
and the second conveying path 51. The guide unit 210 includes<br>
a flap 212 disposed on a rotation shaft 211 and a driving unit<br>
213 switching a position of the flap 212 by rotating the rotation<br>
shaft 211. The guide flap 212 is configured to be positioned at<br>
a first position for conveying the recording material from the<br>
first conveying path 50 to the image formation unit IB, the first<br>
position being indicated by a solid line, and at a second position<br>
for guiding the recording material to the second conveying path<br>
51, the collection position being indicated by a two-dot chain<br>
line shown in FIG. 4. These positions are switched as appropriate<br><br>
37<br>
by driving the driving unit 213. As shown in FIG. 7, the driving<br>
unit 213 is connected to the control unit 80 and is driven based<br>
on a driving signal from the control unit 80. The control unit<br>
80 controls driving of the driving unit 213 such that the flap<br>
212 is positioned at the second position when an image on the<br>
recording material is removed and positioned at the first position<br>
upon image formation.<br>
In other words, in the first conveying path 50, a<br>
recording material conveying path 501 common to the second<br>
conveying path 51 is constructed from the paper feed unit 161 and<br>
the manual paper feed tray 162 to the branching portion 502 between<br>
the first conveying path 50 and the second conveying path 51. The<br>
recording material fed from the paper feed unit 161 and the manual<br>
paper feed tray 162 is conveyed through the recording material<br>
conveying path 501 to the branching portion 502 and destination<br>
is switched by the switch unit 210.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the image removal device<br>
2 includes a block 192 constructed using aluminum internally<br>
having a halogen lamp 193 as a heat source, a pressure roller 191<br>
having an elastic member such as silicon rubber,<br>
fluorine-containing rubber, polyurethane rubber, and the like on<br>
a surface thereof, the pressure roller 191 being made of stainless<br>
steel, aluminum, iron, and the like and forming a nip portion N<br>
when in contact with the block 192, an image peeling member 194<br>
having an endless belt-like shape for transferring toner formed<br><br>
38<br>
on a recording material, a rotating cleaning blade 196 having a<br>
spiral shape, a container 198 for storing separated toner, the<br>
second conveying path 51 for supplying the recording material to<br>
the nip portion N, the third conveying path 52 for returning the<br>
recording material passed through the nip portion N to the first<br>
conveying path 50, pairs of conveying rollers 185a, 185b, 185c,<br>
and 185d disposed on the second and third conveying paths 51 and<br>
52 as conveying units, a pair of paper ejection rollers 169 and<br>
a paper ejection path 55 for ejecting the recording material<br>
(reusable medium) from the third conveying path 52 to a medium<br>
ejection tray 165, and a guide unit 60 guiding the recording<br>
material (reusable medium) to the first conveying path 50 or the<br>
paper ejection path 55.<br>
The image peeling member 194 is made of metal such<br>
as nickel, stainless steel, and the like or polymer compound such<br>
as polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide, aramid, polyethylene<br>
naphthalate, polyetheretherketone, and the like. The image<br>
peeling member 194 is installed so as to have inscribed elements<br>
of the block 192, a cleaning backup roller 197, and a tension roller<br>
195. The nip portion N is formed between the pressure roller 191<br>
and the block 192 where pressure is added from a pressure unit<br>
such as a spring not shown in the drawings, water pressure, air<br>
pressure, and the like.<br>
In the vicinity of the block 192, there is disposed<br>
a temperature detection unit not shown in the drawings, the<br><br>
39<br>
temperature detection unit being selected from a thermistor,<br>
thermocouple, platinum resistance, infrared sensor, and the like.<br>
A signal from the temperature detection unit is input to the<br>
control unit 80. Lighting of the halogen lamp 193 in the block<br>
192 is controlled by the control unit 80 using the input signal,<br>
so that surface temperature of the block 192 is controlled to be<br>
constant within a range from 80 to 150 °C, for example.<br>
The medium ejection tray 165 is disposed on a top<br>
portion of the housing B and is detachably installed on the image<br>
formation apparatus 1 in an integral manner with the image removal<br>
device 2. A reusable medium from which an image is basically<br>
removed is ejected to the medium ejection tray 165.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the guide unit 60 is disposed on<br>
a branching portion between the third conveying path 52 and the<br>
paper ejection path 55. The guide unit 60 includes a flap 62<br>
disposed on a rotation shaft 61 and a driving unit 63 switching<br>
a position of the flap 62 by rotating the rotation shaft 61. The<br>
flap 62 is configured to be positioned at a reuse position for<br>
guiding a recording material 174 (reusable medium) from which an<br>
image is removed to the paper ejection path 55, the reuse position<br>
being indicated by a solid line, and at a paper ejection position<br>
for guiding the reusable medium in an inappropriate status to the<br>
first conveying path 50, the paper ejection position being<br>
indicated by a two-dot chain line shown in FIG. 6. These positions<br>
are switched as appropriate by driving the driving unit 63. As<br><br>
40<br>
shown in FIG. 7, the driving unit 63 is connected to the control<br>
unit 80 and is driven through the driving signal from the control<br>
unit 80. The control unit 80 controls driving of the driving unit<br>
63 such that the flap 62 is positioned at the reuse position in<br>
a case of the reusable medium from which an image is removed and<br>
positioned at the paper ejection position in a case of the reusable<br>
medium in the inappropriate status. The reusable medium in the<br>
inappropriate status refers to a reusable medium from which an<br>
image is not completely removed.<br>
The recording material 171d or the recording material<br>
172 to be used as a reusable medium from which an image is removed<br>
is conveyed in the recording material conveying path 501 by the<br>
pairs of paper feed rollers 166d, 166c, 166b, 166a, and 170a,<br>
guided to the second conveying path 51 by the switch unit 210,<br>
and guided to the nip portion N formed using the pressure roller<br>
191 and the block 192 by the pair of conveying rollers 185a and<br>
185b. The recording material 171d or the recording material 172<br>
is heated and pressurized while passing through the nip portion<br>
N and toner on the recording material is pressurized in a softened<br>
status, so that the toner is adhered to the image peeling member<br>
194.<br>
An edge portion disposed downstream relative to the<br>
block 192 has a curvature of about 1 to 5 mm radius. Since the<br>
image peeling member 194 is conveyed in accordance with the<br>
curvature, the recording material and the image peeling member<br><br>
41<br>
194 are separated due to rigidity of the recording material. In<br>
this case, by using a reusable medium as a recording material in<br>
which adhesion to toner is adjusted to be reduced in comparison<br>
with adhesion to the image peeling member 194, the toner on the<br>
recording material is transferred to the image peeling member and<br>
an image formed on the recording material is removed.<br>
The toner transferred to the image peeling member 194<br>
from the recording material is scraped off by the rotating<br>
spiral-shaped cleaning blade 196 and is collected in the container<br>
198 disposed below the cleaning blade 196. The recording material<br>
17 4 from which an image is removed is guided to the paper ejection<br>
path 55 by the guide unit 60 shown in FIG. 6 after passing through<br>
the pairs of conveying rollers 185c and 185d, and then stocked<br>
in the medium ejection tray 165 by the pair of paper ejection<br>
rollers 169.<br>
FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B are a perspective view and a front<br>
view showing a schematic structure of a cleaning unit removing<br>
toner from the image peeling member 194. The cleaning unit is<br>
constructed using the roller-shaped cleaning blade 196 having a<br>
spiral-shaped edge on a circumferential portion and being driven<br>
for rotation and the cleaning backup roller 197. Predetermined<br>
pressure loading is applied between the cleaning blade 196 and<br>
the cleaning backup roller 197 by a biasing unit selected from<br>
a spring, water pressure unit, air pressure unit, and the like<br>
not shown in the drawings. An elastic body is formed on a surface<br><br>
42<br>
portion 199 of the cleaning backup roller 197 using rubber of<br>
relatively low hardness having a JIS-A hardness of about 20, sponge,<br>
and the like. The cleaning backup roller 197 and the cleaning<br>
blade 196 form a nip (width W) . The cleaning blade 196 is rotated<br>
in an opposite direction relative to a conveying direction of the<br>
image peeling member 194.<br>
The reusable medium used in the present invention is<br>
a recording material including compounds for reducing fixing power<br>
to the image forming substances at least in the vicinity of a<br>
surface thereof or compositions for removing a portion of a surface<br>
layer along with the image forming substances when physical energy<br>
such as light, heat, and the like is applied or water washing is<br>
performed by a washing unit, for example. A substrate thereof<br>
may be any of paper having cellulose fiber as a main body, synthetic<br>
paper made of plastic film having a foam structure and the like,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) , and film<br>
made of thermoplastic resin such as acetate film. However, paper<br>
is most preferably used as a substrate in view of the facts that<br>
a manufacturing cost is moderate, electric charge does not remain<br>
for a long time when the recording material is charged in the image<br>
formation apparatus, electric shock is not provided to the user,<br>
and the paper is capable of being dissolved into cellulose fiber<br>
and recycled when a repetition of reuse becomes difficult.<br>
When paper is used as a substrate, the substrate may<br>
be made from any of wood such as chemical pulp and mechanical pulp,<br><br>
43<br>
nonwood cellulose fiber such as bagasse and kenaf, recycled pulp<br>
of waste paper gained from used paper after deinking, pulp gained<br>
from dissolved waste sheet, and the like.<br>
Examples of the compounds for reducing fixing power<br>
to the image forming substances include fluorine compound, silicon<br>
compound, surface-active agent containing a straight-chain or<br>
branched higher alkyl group or alkenyl group, wax, and polymer<br>
compound. More specifically, examples of the compounds for<br>
reducing fixing power to the image forming substances include<br>

acid ester, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, and<br>

polyethylene glycol fatty acid ester, fatty monoglyceride,<br><br>
44<br>

nonionic surface-active agent such as aliphatic alkanolamide,<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid amide, polyoxyethylene alkylamine,<br>
and alkylamine oxide, cationic surface-active agent such as<br>
alkylamine salt and alkyl quaternary ammonium salt, fatty acids<br>
such as stearic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, and behenic acid,<br>

N-stearyl stearic acid amide, N,N'-ethylene-bis oleic amide,<br>
N,N'-ethylene-bis lauric acid amide, N,N'-methylene-bis stearic<br>
acid amide, and N,N'-ethylene-bis behenic acid amide, alcohols<br>
such as lauryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alchohol, ceryl<br>
alcohol, myristyl alcohol, melissyl alcohol, myricyl alcohol,<br>

zoomaric alcohol, amines such as oleylamine, dodecyl amine,<br>
dioctadecylamine, and tetradecylamine, ketones such as laurone<br>
and stearone, phosphate compounds such as lauryl phosphate and<br>
stearyl phosphate, phosphate esters such as stearyl phosphate<br>
ester, lauryl phosphate ester, and behenyl phosphate ester,<br>
natural waxes such as candelilla wax, carnauba wax, rice bran wax,<br>
bees wax, lanolin, spermaceti wax, sumac wax, and montan wax,<br>
silicon resin, fluorine resin, and polymer containing a<br>
straight-chain or branched alkyl group with a carbon number of<br><br>
45<br>
6 or more or an alkenyl group with a carbon number of 6 or more<br>
as a side chain. Specific examples of such compounds include<br>
acrylic ester polymer and methacrylate ester polymer containing<br>
a straight-chain or branched alkyl group with a carbon number of<br>
6 or more or an alkenyl group with a carbon number of 6 or more.<br>
More specific examples include polymers and<br>
copolymers containing monomers of acrylic ester and methacrylate<br>
ester such as stearyl (straight-chain C18) acrylic ester, stearyl<br>
(straight-chain C18) methacrylate ester, cetyl (straight-chain<br>

(straight-chain C14) methacrylate ester, lauryl (straight-chain<br>
C12) acrylic ester, and lauryl (straight-chain C12) methacrylate<br>
ester.<br>
A required level of reduction of fixing power to the<br>
image forming substances changes depending on materials<br>
constituting the image forming substances, especially, in<br>
accordance with factors such as resin component, surface<br>
smoothness of the substrate, adhesion of the image peeling member<br>
relative to the image forming substances in the image removal<br>
device, and the like. So as to adjust fixing power to toner, to<br>
fix the above-mentioned compounds in the vicinity of a surface<br>
of the recording material, and the like, it is possible to mix<br>
polymer which does not reduce the fixing power to the image forming<br>
substances, more specifically, compounds such as polyvinyl<br><br>
46<br>
alcohol, starch, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid,<br>
polyacrylic ester, polymethacrylic acid ester, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer, and the like with the<br>
above-mentioned compounds reducing the fixing power to the image<br>
forming substances and to provide the mixture to the reusable<br>
medium. Further, it is possible to mix white pigment such as<br>
calcium carbonate, kaoline, clay, talc, titanium oxide, zinc oxide,<br>
and the like with the compounds reducing the fixing power to the<br>
image forming substances and to provide the mixture to the reusable<br>
medium.<br>
The reusable medium used in the present invention is<br>
provided with information for indicating a reusable medium in<br>
order to discriminate the reusable medium from a general recording<br>
material incapable of removing an image. Preferably, the<br>
information for indicating as a reusable medium is not erased upon<br>
forming image information thereon or removing an image therefrom.<br>
Moreover, the information preferably allows the image formation<br>
apparatus 1 and the image removal device 2 to readily recognize<br>
the information as a reusable medium and the user to readily<br>
recognize the information by visual observation. It is possible<br>
to record such discrimination information on the reusable medium<br>
as a barcode, for example, using UV curable ink, dye ink, and the<br>
like through a printing method, ink-jet recording method, and the<br>
like. Further, it is also preferable to dispose a cutout or a<br>
hole on the reusable medium as a method for providing<br><br>
47<br>
discrimination information. In order to enable the image<br>
formation apparatus 1 or the image removal device 2 to recognize<br>
the reusable medium, discrimination information may be printed<br>
using ink absorbing light having a wavelength unrecognizable for<br>
human eyes such as ultraviolet rays or infrared rays, ink emitting<br>
fluorescence, and magnetic ink, and an IC chip responding to<br>
electromagnetic waves may be disposed in which the discrimination<br>
information is stored.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the image formation apparatus 1<br>
includes a selection unit 90 for allowing the user to arbitrarily<br>
select modes using a key 91 for selecting a first image formation<br>
mode in which an image is formed on the reusable medium on the<br>
assumption that the image information formed for recording is used<br>
for a short period of time and the reusable medium is subjected<br>
to a process for removing the image forming substances after the<br>
use and a key 92 for selecting a second image formation mode in<br>
which an image is formed on paper as a general recording material.<br>
The selection unit 90 is connected to the control unit 80. As<br>
shown in FIG. 9, the control unit 80 is configured to control<br>
operation of the image formation apparatus 1 such that when the<br>
key 91 is operated (step Dl) so as to select the first image<br>
formation mode, an image is formed on the reusable medium (step<br>
D2) and when the key 92 is operated (step D3) so as to select the<br>
second image formation mode, an image is formed on a general<br>
recording material (step D4).<br><br>
48<br>
In the present embodiment, although the keys 91 and<br>
92 are employed as the selection unit 90, for example, selection<br>
may be performed using a selection unit such as a dial, stick,<br>
or the like. Moreover, when the image formation apparatus 1 is<br>
connected to an external information processing terminal via a<br>
network, namely, when the image formation apparatus 1 is connected<br>
to a computer capable of accessing the network, for example, the<br>
selection unit 90 may be a user interface on- a display connected<br>
to the computer. The image formation apparatus 1 includes a<br>
warning unit 230 outputting warning information so as to notify<br>
that an appropriate recording material is not set. As shown in<br>
FIG. 7, the warning unit 230 is disposed on an operation panel<br>
231 and is connected to the control unit 80.<br>
In the present embodiment, at least one of the paper<br>
feed cassettes 161a to 161d constituting a portion of the paper<br>
feed unit 161 is configured to be set as a paper feed cassette<br>
for storing a reusable medium. Preferably, a paper type<br>
indication unit such as a dial, lever, or the like capable of<br>
changing a position thereof in accordance with paper type is<br>
disposed on the paper feed cassette so as to allow the user to<br>
recognize that the reusable medium is stored.<br>
For example, in FIGS. 1 and 2, the paper feed cassette<br>
161d is used as a first paper feed cassette for reusable media<br>
and the paper feed cassettes 161a, 161b, and 161c are used as second<br>
paper feed cassettes for general recording materials.<br><br>
49<br>
A sensor 181 used as a recognition unit is disposed<br>
on the recording material conveying path 501, the sensor 181<br>
detecting the discrimination information provided to the reusable<br>
medium. A specific recognition unit depends on the<br>
discrimination information provided to the reusable medium. For<br>
example, when a cutout or a hole is disposed, a simple recognition<br>
unit detecting the cutout or the hole may be used merely combining<br>
a light-emitting element such as an LED and a light-receiving<br>
element such as a photoelectric cell. However, when reading an<br>
image pattern such as a bar code, two-dimensional bar code, and<br>
the like and a special pattern indicating a reusable medium, it<br>
is necessary to use a recognition unit capable of reading an image<br>
pattern such as a line sensor prepared by disposing a CCD element<br>
on a line.<br>
In the first image formation mode for forming an image<br>
on the reusable medium, preferably, the image formation apparatus<br>
1 provides discrimination information to a portion of the reusable<br>
medium so as to clearly indicate that the image is formed by an<br>
image formation apparatus capable of removing the image. The<br>
discrimination information is formed using the same image forming<br>
substances as the image forming substances for recording other<br>
information on the reusable medium so as to be removed by the image<br>
removal device 2. When the first image formation mode is selected,<br>
by providing the reusable medium with discrimination information<br>
indicating that the image is formed by a specific image formation<br><br>
50<br>
apparatus, it is possible to discriminate a reusable medium on<br>
which an image is formed by an image formation apparatus incapable<br>
of removing the image between a reusable medium from which an image<br>
can be removed.<br>
In other words, when simply detecting the presence<br>
or absence of the discrimination information provided to the<br>
reusable medium in advance, it is impossible to recognize a mixed<br>
reusable medium on which an image is formed by an image formation<br>
apparatus other than a specific image formation apparatus and the<br>
image forming substances are not removed therefrom because of<br>
mismatching of physical properties of the image forming substances<br>
and conditions of image formation. Accordingly, it is not<br>
possible to prevent trouble when the image is not completely<br>
removed in the image removal device 2, the image peeling member<br>
194 and the reusable medium are not separated and jam is generated,<br>
or the image peeling member becomes unusable. However, by<br>
discriminating images and determining which image formation<br>
apparatuses have formed such images, it is possible to exclude<br>
those reusable media having images that have not been formed by<br>
the specific image formation apparatus 1 and prevent failure of<br>
elimination of images.<br>
Preferably, the sensor 181 detects not only the<br>
discrimination information provided to the reusable medium in<br>
advance but also the presence or absence of the above-mentioned<br>
discrimination information provided when an image is formed in<br><br>
51<br>
the first image formation mode of the image formation apparatus<br>
1. The discrimination information provided when the image is<br>
formed in the first image formation mode of the image formation<br>
apparatus 1 may be a pattern unreadable for the user such as a<br>
bar code or a character pattern such as "reusable paper".<br>
Moreover, the discrimination information may be selected from<br>
several types of patterns prepared by the user in advance or the<br>
discrimination information may be a pattern arbitrarily created<br>
by the user and stored through reading.<br>
In FIGS. 1 and 2, the sensor 181 functions as a unit<br>
detecting the discrimination information indicating the reusable<br>
medium formed on the reusable medium upon image formation. When<br>
the image removal device 2 is installed, upon image removal, the<br>
sensor 181 also functions as a unit detecting the presence or<br>
absence of the discrimination information provided when an image<br>
is formed on the reusable medium in the first image formation mode.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, by disposing the sensor 181 on the<br>
recording material conveying path 501, only a single set of sensors<br>
effectively functions upon image formation and image removal and<br>
provides great effects in that the apparatus is simplified, the<br>
number of components is reduced, and a cost and environmental load<br>
are reduced.<br>
In the present embodiment, the reusable medium is<br>
stored only in the specific paper feed cassette 161d shown in FIGS.<br>
1 and 2. When the user selects the first image formation mode,<br><br>
52<br>
a recording material on which an image is to be formed is controlled<br>
to be supplied from the paper feed cassette 161d. Thus, there<br>
is little possibility that the image is formed on a recording<br>
material which is not a reusable medium in the first image<br>
formation mode. However, the user may erroneously mix a general<br>
recording material with reusable media in the paper feed cassette<br>
161d. In view of this, the sensor 181 detects the presence or<br>
absence of the discrimination information on the recording<br>
material conveyed upon each image formation instruction.<br>
In other words, in the control unit 80, as shown FIG.<br>
10, when the key 91 is operated in step El so as to select the<br>
first image formation mode, a recording material is fed from the<br>
paper feed cassette 161d, and the sensor 181 detects the<br>
discrimination information indicating a reusable medium in step<br>
E2, the driving unit 223 shown in FIG. 3 is driven and the guide<br>
flap 222 is positioned at the conveying position in step E3, the<br>
recording material is conveyed to the image formation unit IB,<br>
the toner powder images formed in the image formation operation<br>
are transferred in step E4, and the images are fixed using the<br>
fixation unit 140, thereby completing an image formation job.<br>
On the other hand, if the discrimination information<br>
indicating a reusable medium is not detected on the recording<br>
material on which an image is to be formed by the sensor 181 in<br>
step E2, a signal of the sensor 181 is input to the control unit<br>
80. Thereafter, an instruction for changing the conveying<br><br>
53<br>
direction of the recording material is output from the control<br>
unit 80, the driving unit 223 shown in FIG. 3 is driven, and the<br>
guide flap 222 is positioned at the collection position in step<br>
E5. Thus, the image is not formed on the recording material and<br>
the recording material is ejected to the collection tray 164<br>
through the pair of collection rollers 168 in step E6.<br>
Another embodiment of control by the control unit 80<br>
is described in the following.<br>
As shown in a flowchart of FIG. 11, when the key 91<br>
is operated in step Fl so as to select the first image formation<br>
mode and an image formation instruction for forming an image is<br>
issued thereafter, whether a recording material to be supplied<br>
is a reusable medium is judged in step F2. If the recording<br>
material is a reusable medium, in step F3, the driving unit 223<br>
is driven, the guide flap 222 is positioned at the conveying<br>
position, and the recording material is conveyed to the image<br>
formation unit IB. In step F4, the toner powder images formed<br>
in the image formation operation are transferred and the images<br>
are fixed using the fixation unit 140, thereby completing the image<br>
formation job.<br>
On the other hand, in step F2, if the discrimination<br>
information indicating a reusable medium is not detected, the<br>
process proceeds to step F5 so as to add +1 to a counter not shown<br>
in the drawings and the process proceeds to step F6 so as to judge<br>
whether a count value reaches a predetermined times, namely,<br><br>
54<br>
whether a predetermined number of sheets set in advance are<br>
successively counted. When the count value reaches the<br>
predetermined times since non-reusable media are successively-<br>
counted, namely, when the discrimination information indicating<br>
a reusable medium is not detected for ten sheets successively,<br>
the process proceeds to step F7 so as to stop the image formation<br>
process and the process proceeds to step F8.<br>
In step F8, the fact that image formation cannot be<br>
performed in the first image formation mode since reusable media<br>
are not supplied is notified to the user by operating the warning<br>
unit 230. In other words, the fact that inappropriate recording<br>
media are set is notified to the user.<br>
The warning unit 230 may be a display disposed on the<br>
operation panel 231 or a user interface on a display connected<br>
to a computer issuing a printing instruction when the image<br>
formation apparatus is connected to the computer. Further, a form<br>
of warning may be voice, sound, lighting/flickering of a lamp and<br>
the like.<br>
By controlling the image formation apparatus in this<br>
manner, even when the user erroneously mixes a general recording<br>
material in the paper feed cassette 161d where only those reusable<br>
media must be stored, if image information is used only for a short<br>
period of time, it is possible to securely record such information<br>
on the reusable medium and end the image formation operation<br>
without stopping the operation. Thus, it is possible to eliminate<br><br>
55<br>
waste of recording materials and reduce environmental load.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to reduce a possibility that a general<br>
recording material on which an image is formed is mixed in the<br>
image removal device, prevent trouble such as generation of jam<br>
in the image removal device 2, and eliminate a loss of time<br>
resulting from stopping of the image formation operation.<br>
The same operation is performed in a case where an<br>
image is formed in the second image formation mode. If the<br>
discrimination information indicating a reusable medium is<br>
detected by the sensor 181 on a recording material on which an<br>
image is to be formed, the driving unit 223 is driven and the guide<br>
flap 222 is positioned at the collection position, so that the<br>
image is not formed on the reusable medium and the reusable medium<br>
is ejected to the collection tray 164 via the pair of collection<br>
rollers 168. Then, the next recording material is supplied from<br>
the paper feed cassette in which a selected type of paper is set.<br>
If the discrimination information indicating a reusable medium<br>
is not detected by the sensor 181, the driving unit 223 is driven<br>
and the guide flap 222 is positioned at the conveying position,<br>
so that a general recording material is conveyed to the image<br>
formation unit, the toner powder images formed in the image<br>
formation operation is transferred, and the transferred images<br>
are fixed in the fixation unit 140, thereby completing the image<br>
formation job.<br>
The same process as in the first image formation mode<br><br>
56<br>
is performed if the discrimination information on the reusable<br>
medium is successively detected even when the second image<br>
formation mode is selected and an image formation instruction is<br>
issued. By controlling the image formation apparatus in this<br>
manner, even when the user erroneously mixes a reusable medium<br>
in the paper feed cassette where only those general recording<br>
materials must be stored, an image is not formed on the reusable<br>
medium and it is possible to securely record such information on<br>
the general recording material and end the image formation<br>
operation.<br>
Thus, it is possible to prevent a stop of the image<br>
formation operation and eliminate a loss of time generated from<br>
printing only a specific page again. Further, it is possible to<br>
prevent mixing of the reusable medium and formal documents such<br>
as documents, contracts, and the like submitted to customers,<br>
government and public offices, outside companies, and outside<br>
divisions.<br>
Another embodiment of control by the control unit 8 0<br>
is described in the following.<br>
When the image removal device 2 is installed on the<br>
image formation apparatus 1, the reusable medium used as a<br>
recording material from which a formed image is to be removed is<br>
usually stored in the paper feed cassette 161d as mentioned above,<br>
for example, and conveyed to the image removal device 2. When<br>
an image removal process is performed, the sensor 181 detects not<br><br>
57<br>
only whether the recording material being conveyed has information<br>
for indicating a reusable medium but also the presence or absence<br>
of the discrimination information provided when the image is<br>
formed in the first image formation mode of the image formation<br>
apparatus 1.<br>
If one of both set of information is not detected,<br>
the control unit 80 of the image formation apparatus judges that<br>
the image forming substances cannot be removed from the conveyed<br>
recording material and the control unit 80 is capable of<br>
positioning the guide flap 222 using the driving unit 223 such<br>
that the recording material is ejected to the collection tray 164.<br>
In other words, on the collection tray 164, a recording material<br>
inappropriate upon image formation is ejected and a recording<br>
material inappropriate upon image removal is ejected. The<br>
ejection of such inappropriate paper is caused by erroneous<br>
operation of the user and the like. Usually, a large number of<br>
recording materials are not ejected to the collection tray 164.<br>
Upon image formation and image removal, preferably,<br>
the collection tray 164 to which the inappropriate recording<br>
materials are ejected is shared as mentioned above, so that it<br>
is possible to reduce the number of components, environmental load,<br>
and a cost.<br>
Another embodiment of control by the control unit 80<br>
is described in the following.<br>
When the image removal device 2 is installed on the<br><br>
58<br>
image formation apparatus 1, it is possible to perform the image<br>
formation operation and the image removal operation at the same<br>
time. However, as shown in FIG. 1, when the recording material<br>
conveying path 501 in which portions of the second conveying path<br>
51 and the first conveying path 50 are shared is disposed, problems<br>
are generated in that control becomes difficult upon operation<br>
at the same time and electric consumption becomes excessively<br>
large, for example. Thus, the control unit 80 preferably controls<br>
such that the image formation operation and the image removal<br>
operation are not performed at the same time.<br>
In general, the image formation operation requires<br>
high speed and a ratio of actual period of time for the image<br>
formation operation to working hours at the offices is small. By<br>
contrast, normal image removal operation in which the reusable<br>
medium is conveyed from the paper feed cassette 161d does not<br>
require urgency in many cases. Accordingly, while a normal<br>
successive image removal process is being performed in which the<br>
reusable medium is conveyed from the paper feed cassette 161d as<br>
in step Gl shown in FIG. 12, if the user presses a print button<br>
232 disposed on the operation panel 231 shown in FIG. 7 or an<br>
instruction for the image formation operation is input (step G2)<br>
by issuing a printing instruction from a driver of the user<br>
interface of the computer connected to the image formation<br>
apparatus via the network, for example, after the image removal<br>
process on the reusable medium ejected from the paper feed unit<br><br>
59<br>
161 is ended in step G3, the image formation process is<br>
preferentially performed immediately in step G4. Then, when an<br>
entire image formation operation is ended in step G5, it is<br>
possible to perform an interrupt control in step 6 such that the<br>
image removal process in operation is resumed. By contrast, even<br>
when the successive image removal process is being performed, if<br>
the instruction for the image formation operation is not input<br>
in step G2, the process proceeds to step G7 and the image removal<br>
process operation is continued.<br>
By performing control in this manner, the user is<br>
capable of performing the image formation process and the process<br>
for removing an image from the reusable medium without reducing<br>
operational efficiency. Moreover, it is possible to prevent the<br>
electric consumption from becoming excessively large resulting<br>
from performing the image formation process and the image removal<br>
process at the same time. Further, it is possible to simplify<br>
control operation and the control unit 80.<br>
Another embodiment of control by the control unit 80<br>
is described in the following.<br>
The process for removing an image from the reusable<br>
medium is controlled to be automatically continued while the<br>
reusable medium is present in the dedicated paper feed cassette<br>
161d. The process for removing an image from the reusable medium<br>
is performed not only on the reusable medium fed from the paper<br>
feed cassette 161d but also on the reusable medium fed from the<br><br>
60<br>
manual paper feed tray 162. The process for removing an image<br>
from the reusable medium fed from the manual paper feed tray 162<br>
is performed only through an image removal process start button<br>
233 disposed on the operation panel 231 shown in FIG. 7. The image<br>
removal process on the reusable medium fed from the manual paper<br>
feed tray 162 is given priority over any image formation process<br>
operation and the image removal process on the reusable medium<br>
fed from the paper feed cassette 161d.<br>
In step HI shown in FIG. 13, while a normal successive<br>
image removal process is being performed in which the reusable<br>
medium is conveyed from the paper feed cassette 161d, if the image<br>
removal process start button 233 is turned on in step H2, for<br>
example, after the process on a single sheet of the reusable medium<br>
ejected from the paper feed unit 161 is ended in step H3, the<br>
process operation for removing an image is immediately performed<br>
on the reusable medium fed from the manual paper feed tray 162<br>
in step H4. This operation is given priority until the reusable<br>
medium from the manual paper feed tray 162 runs out. When the<br>
image removal process is ended in H5, an interrupt control is<br>
performed in step H6 such that the image removal process or the<br>
image formation process in operation is resumed.<br>
In this manner, by performing control such that the<br>
process for removing an image from the reusable medium fed from<br>
the manual paper feed tray 162 is given priority over any operation,<br>
the user is capable of removing image information on the reusable<br><br>
61<br>
medium in which especially highly-confidential information is<br>
recorded without allowing many persons to see the image<br>
information and is capable of confirming whether the information<br>
is securely removed. In other words, it is possible to use the<br>
image removal device 2 connected to the image formation apparatus<br>
so as to protect confidentiality in the same manner as a shredder<br>
and reuse the reusable medium.<br>
Another embodiment of control by the control unit 8 0<br>
is described in the following.<br>
In the image removal device 2 shown in FIG. 1, a sensor<br>
182 is disposed on the third conveying path 52. The sensor 182<br>
is a detection unit detecting whether there is a remaining image<br>
on the reusable medium used as a recording material from which<br>
an image is removed. The sensor 182 is disposed based on the fact<br>
that an image may remain on the reusable medium after the image<br>
removal process when writing is performed using writing materials<br>
incapable of removal by the image removal process or when a number<br>
of reuse of the reusable medium becomes large and an image is<br>
incompletely removed.<br>
It is possible to construct the sensor 182 using a<br>
line image sensor including a CCD. As shown in FIG. 14, for example,<br>
in step Jl, the presence or absence of a remaining image on the<br>
reusable medium after the image removal process is judged based<br>
on an output from the sensor 182. If the remaining image is judged<br>
to be present, the driving unit 63 is driven and the flap 62 is<br><br>
62<br>
moved to the paper ejection position in step J2, so that the<br>
reusable medium having the remaining image is returned to the first<br>
conveying path 50 and the reusable medium is ejected to the paper<br>
ejection tray 163 as a non-reusable medium via a pair of conveying<br>
rollers 185e, the fixing roller 141, the pair of conveying rollers<br>
170g, and the pair of paper ejection rollers 167 in step J3, without<br>
ejecting the reusable medium to the medium ejection tray 165. On<br>
the other hand, if the remaining image is judged to be absent in<br>
step Jl, the driving unit 63 is driven and the flap 62 is moved<br>
to the reuse position in step J4 and the reusable medium is ejected<br>
to the medium ejection tray 165 as a reusable media in step J5.<br>
As mentioned above, the image formation process and<br>
the image removal process are not performed at the same time, so<br>
that the reusable medium having the remaining image after the image<br>
removal process is not inserted between recording materials on<br>
which an image is formed at a single image formation instruction.<br>
When a multi-stage paper ejection device such as a<br>
conventional sorter is installed on the image formation apparatus<br>
1, the reusable medium having the remaining image after the image<br>
removal process may be controlled to be ejected to other bin<br>
separate from the recording material on which an image is formed<br>
based on the image formation instruction. Or, as shown in FIG.<br>
15, a rack 240 may be disposed in a movement direction of the medium<br>
ejection tray 165 and a driving motor 242 may be disposed on the<br>
housing B of the image removal device 2, the driving motor 242<br><br>
63<br>
rotating a pinion gear 241 meshing with the rack 240 by a certain<br>
angle. Then, the reusable medium having the remaining image after<br>
the image removal process is ejected to the medium ejection tray<br>
165 in the same manner as the reusable medium having no remaining<br>
image. When ejecting the reusable medium having the remaining<br>
image, by driving the driving motor 242 and shifting the medium<br>
ejection tray 165 in a direction orthogonal relative to a paper<br>
conveying direction, the reusable medium may be controlled to be<br>
stocked such that the reusable medium 174 from which an image is<br>
completely removed and a reusable medium 174A having the remaining<br>
image are readily separated.<br>
The above-mentioned description is based on the<br>
assumption that the image removal device 2 is installed on the<br>
image formation apparatus 1. However, the user may not require<br>
the reuse of the recording material using the reusable medium.<br>
Further, although plural image formation apparatuses 1 are<br>
required, the image removal device 2 may not necessarily be<br>
connected to each of the image formation apparatuses 1. Moreover,<br>
the installed image removal device 2 may become no longer necessary<br>
and the user may wish to detach the image removal device 2. In<br>
a case where the image removal device 2 is not installed, by having<br>
a common structure for the image formation apparatus 1 and allowing<br>
the image removal device 2 to be detachably installed, it is<br>
possible to install and detach the image removal device 2 as<br>
appropriate and add the image removal function so as to meet user<br><br>
64<br>
demands and to simplify the structure of the image removal device<br>
2 and reduce environmental load and a cost.<br>
In particular, as in the present invention, it is<br>
possible to simplify the structure of the image removal device<br>
2 installed on the image formation apparatus 1 by sharing the paper<br>
feed unit of the recording material such as the paper feed cassette,<br>
the manual paper feed unit, the conveying path, and the sensor<br>
181 used as a recognition unit for the discrimination information<br>
between the image formation apparatus 1 and the image removal<br>
device 2, and disposing the control unit 80 controlling an entire<br>
portion on the image formation apparatus 1 when the image removal<br>
device 2 is installed on the image formation apparatus 1.<br>
Further, the image formation apparatus 1 and the image<br>
removal device 2 are not operated at the same time, so that it<br>
is possible to share a driving system, a direct-current power<br>
supply, and the like of the image formation apparatus 1 and the<br>
image removal device 2 between the image formation apparatus and<br>
the image removal device and to use such elements through switching<br>
with a clutch or a switch. However, those users wishing to have<br>
the image formation apparatus 1 and the image removal device 2<br>
from the beginning may be provided with an image formation<br>
apparatus in which the image formation function and the image<br>
removal function are stored in a single housing A.<br>
In other words, as shown in FIG. 16, the image<br>
formation apparatus may include the image formation unit to which<br><br>
65<br>
the recording material is supplied at least from the manual paper<br>
feed tray 162, the image removal device 2 disposed on the housing<br>
A and removing an image recorded on the recording material, and<br>
the switch unit 210 switching whether the recording material fed<br>
from the manual paper feed tray 162 is supplied to the image removal<br>
device or the image formation unit.<br>
In the above-mentioned image formation unit, a<br>
technique for forming an image by the most common<br>
electrophotography is employed as an image formation method in<br>
which an electrostatic latent image is formed on each of<br>
photoconductors, development is performed using dry toner, and<br>
toner powder images are transferred to the recording material.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to this and<br>
electrophotography such as an electrostatic recording method,<br>
toner jet recording method, ion flow printing, and the like may<br>
be used where photoconductors are not used.<br>
Further, the image formation method is not<br>
necessarily limited to electrophotography but includes a magnetic<br>
recording process in which thermoplastic image forming substances<br>
are used for image formation and a thermal transfer method. When<br>
an image is formed by an ink-jet method using thermofusible solid<br>
ink, it is possible to remove the image forming substances by<br>
thermally transferring the substances to the image peeling member<br>
and apply the present invention to an image formation apparatus<br>
using these image formation methods.<br><br>
66<br>
Moreover, as clearly understood from the principle<br>
of the present invention, it is possible to apply the present<br>
invention to methods for removing an image from the recording<br>
material even when the image is not thermally transferred to the<br>
image peeling member. For example, such image removal methods<br>
may include a method for washing out an image using water, organic<br>
solvent, and the like, a method for removing the image by scraping,<br>
and a method for eliminating colors of coloring materials using<br>
heat, light irradiation, and the like.<br>
In the embodiments, the reusable medium is described<br>
as a recording material to which an agent having repellency to<br>
image forming substance is provided so as to reduce adhesion to<br>
the image forming substances. However, recording materials in<br>
which a substance swelling with water and the like is provided<br>
and adhesion to the image forming substances is reduced when a<br>
separation solution such as water is provided may be used as the<br>
reusable medium. Also, it is possible to use recording materials<br>
in which resin having resistance of abrasion such as UV-curable<br>
resin is coated and image forming substances can be scraped off<br>
from a surface as the reusable medium and to use recording<br>
materials in which compounds for eliminating color of image<br>
forming substances through a chemical reaction with the image<br>
forming substances are provided as the reusable medium. When<br>
these recording materials are used, an image removal device<br>
capable of performing image removal for each reusable medium may<br><br>
67<br>
be used.<br>
Although the manual paper feed tray 162 installed on<br>
the image formation apparatus 1 is configured to be shared, a paper<br>
feed cassette dedicated to reusable medium may be disposed on the<br>
manual paper feed tray 162 on the image removal device 2.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically disclosed embodiment, and variations and<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese priority<br>
application No. 2006-206659 filed July 28, 2006, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
