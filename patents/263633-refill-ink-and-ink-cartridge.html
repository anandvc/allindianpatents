REFILL INK AND INK CARTRIDGE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a refill ink for ink-jet<br>
recording, which is excellent in storage stability and jet stability<br>
even when mixed with a residual ink that remains in an ink<br>
cartridge, and an ink cartridge refilled with the refill ink.<br>
Background Art<br>
Ink-jet printers have been rapidly becoming commonplace<br>
in recent years for their capability of recording onto plain paper<br>
and realizing easy color printing, compactness, inexpensiveness,<br>
and low running costs, etc. Along with such a rapid distribution<br>
of ink-jet printers, there is a rapid increase in the number of ink<br>
cartridges used. Since most of the ink cartridges are single-use<br>
ink cartridges, they present a serious problem that they cast a<br>
grave impact on the environment as wastes. Accordingly,<br>
makers have been searching for an efficient ink recovery method,<br>
but have enjoyed little success in terms of ink recovery rate.<br>
Thus, the current situation is that little progress is made in<br>
recycling collected cartridges.<br>
Amongst such ink cartridges, those that have ink<br>
absorbers inside for forming negative pressure have a problem<br><br>
that since ink is poorly absorbed into the ink absorbers when<br>
refilled, uniform negative pressure cannot be obtained or ink<br>
spills out of the ink inlet. Also, there is a little ink remaining in<br>
the used ink cartridge, and when the remaining ink is not to be<br>
reused, it is necessary to provide an additional step of washing<br>
out the remaining ink.<br>
Hitherto, there have been various proposals concerning<br>
refilling of an ink cartridge having an ink absorber inside.<br>
For example, in Patent Literature 1, there is proposed a<br>
refilling method which focuses upon an ink remaining in an ink<br>
absorber inside an ink cartridge that is condensed by evaporation<br>
of a solvent. This proposal supposes refilling with an ink having<br>
the same composition.<br>
In Patent Literature 2, as a method for recycling an ink<br>
tank, a process of washing an internal portion thereof is<br>
presented, and also a process of efficiently reusing a cartridge by<br>
judging whether or not the negative pressure retaining force of an<br>
ink absorber on the inside can be recycled is proposed. However,<br>
this proposal is not very advisable in view of the fact that a<br>
residual ink is not reused and a larger number of washing steps is<br>
required.<br>
In Patent Literature 3, there is proposed a method of<br>
refilling an ink cartridge without causing ink to spill out of a<br>
filling opening, by curbing the occurrence of bubbles from an ink<br><br>
absorber inside the cartridge," however, this, too, merely solves a<br>
problem typical of a cartridge provided with an ink absorber.<br>
In Patent Literature 4, there is proposed a refilling<br>
method which prevents a residual ink in a cartridge from being<br>
useless. In this proposal, a time-consuming step is required<br>
that involves measurements of the remaining amount of ink,<br>
constituents of a residual ink and the like by absorption<br>
spectroscopy and chromatography.<br>
In Patent Literature 5, changes in quality or color are<br>
prevented by keeping in a certain range the difference in physical<br>
properties between a residual ink and a refill ink; however, the<br>
range of the difference is narrow, and so this disclosure is lacking<br>
in versatility.<br>
As opposed to the proposals concerning dye-based inks,<br>
Patent Literatures 6, 7 and 8 can, for example, be mentioned as<br>
proposals which make it possible to replace dye inks with<br>
pigment inks. These proposals focus upon the pH or viscosity of<br>
both of dye-based and pigment inks, but the ranges of pH and<br>
viscosity are limited and so these proposals are lacking in<br>
versatility as well.<br>
As described above, many refill inks are directed to dye<br>
inks, but refilling using pigment inks that are becoming popular<br>
these days has not yet been studied thoroughly, and in reality no<br>
effective measures have been taken as to how to reuse cartridges<br><br>
which have been used.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a refill ink<br>
which is excellent in storage stability and jet stability even when<br>
mixed with a residual ink remaining in an ink cartridge, and an<br>
ink cartridge which makes it possible to decrease the number of<br>
ink cartridges discarded in huge numbers and reduce an<br>
environmental load by being refilled with the refill ink.<br>
As a result of carrying out a series of earnest examinations<br>
in order to solve the problems, the present inventors found the<br>
following: regarding a refill ink which is reused in an ink-jet<br>
recording apparatus as a used ink cartridge is refilled with the<br>
refill ink, the refill ink can be excellent in storage stability and<br>
jet stability and used as a refill ink even when mixed with a<br><br>
residual ink that remains in the used ink cartridge, provided that<br>
the number of coarse particles in the mixed ink does not increase<br>
much.<br>
The present invention is based upon the knowledge of the<br>
present inventors, and means for solving the problems are as<br>
follows.<br>
≤1&gt; 1. A refill ink with which a used ink cartridge is to be<br>
refilled, including- a colorant,<br>
a wetting agent, and<br>
a surfactant,<br>
wherein in a mixed ink formed by mixing a residual ink<br>
remaining in the used ink cartridge and the refill ink at a volume<br>
ratio (residual ink * refill ink) of 1-1, the number A of coarse<br>
particles of 0.5µm or greater in diameter measured immediately<br>
after the mixing and the number B of coarse particles of 0.5μm or<br>
greater in diameter measured after the mixed ink has been left to<br>
stand at 25°C and at RH of 50% for 24 hours satisfy the<br>
relationship B/A≤2.<br>
As to the refill ink according to ≤1&gt;, it is hoped that an ink<br>
having properties made as similar as possible to those of the<br>
residual ink remaining in the cartridge to be refilled will be used<br>
so as to match a recording system and to secure image quality,<br>
storage stability and jet stability. However, in order to produce<br>
refill inks that can correspond with recording systems of a wide<br><br>
variety of printers commonly used today, it is necessary to<br>
analyze constituents of residual inks and so forth, which is rather<br>
difficult.<br>
What is most important about a refill ink is that it<br>
prevents clogging in a printer. To achieve this it is important to<br>
prevent the number of coarse particles from increasing at the<br>
time when the refill ink is mixed with a residual ink, and this can<br>
be achieved by preparing the mixed ink such that the number of<br>
coarse particles of 0.5μm or greater in diameter measured after<br>
the mixed ink has been left to stand at 25°C and at RH of 50% for<br>
24 hours is not over twice as large as the number of coarse<br>
particles measured immediately after the mixing.<br>
≤2&gt; The refill ink according to ≤1&gt;, wherein the viscosity<br>
(C) of the mixed ink at 25°C before stored and the viscosity (D) of<br>
the mixed ink at 25°C after stored at 25°C and at RH of 50% for<br>
one week satisfy the relationship D/C≤2.<br>
As to the refill ink according to ≤2&gt;, since the jet amount<br>
and jet velocity of the mixed ink vary according to the viscosity<br>
thereof, it is thought probable that the larger the difference in<br>
property between the refill ink and the residual ink becomes, the<br>
lower image quality becomes. Accordingly, it is desirable that<br>
the properties of the refill ink be also made as similar as possible<br>
to those of the residual ink; however, provided that the mixed ink<br>
is not thickened when left to stand for one week after the mixing,<br><br>
there is a low risk of causing clogging, and so the refill ink can be used as a refill<br>
ink without causing changes in its properties.<br>
≤3&gt; The refill ink according to any one of claims ≤1&gt; and ≤2&gt;,<br>
wherein the volume average particle diameter (E) of the mixed ink before stored<br>
and the volume average particle diameter (F) of the mixed ink after stored at 25°C<br>
and at RH of 50% for one week satisfy the relationship F/E≤1.5.<br>
As to the refill ink according to ≤3&gt;, since the jet amount and jet<br>
velocity of the mixed ink vary according to the volume average particle diameter<br>
thereof, it is thought probable that the larger the difference in property between<br>
the refill ink and the residual ink becomes, the lower image quality becomes.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable that the properties of the refill ink be also made as<br>
similar as possible to those of the residual ink; however, provided that the average<br>
particle diameter of the mixed ink is not increased when the mixed ink is left to<br>
stand for one week after the mixing, there is a low risk of causing clogging, and so<br>
the refill ink can be used as a refill ink without its properties being altered.<br>
≤4&gt; The refill ink according to any one of ≤1&gt; to ≤3&gt;, wherein the<br>
content X of divalent metal ions in the refill ink and the content Y of divalent<br>
metal ions in the residual ink satisfy the relationship 1≤X/Y^5.<br>
As to the refill ink according to ≤4&gt;, there are various mechanisms by<br>
which pigment ink particles aggregate, but they are difficult to identify; one<br>
possible cause for this is the amount of multivalent metal ions. As the degree of<br><br><br>
purification of ink increases, so too does its reliability, but costs thereby increase.<br>
In the present invention, jet reliability is secured by adjusting the amount of<br>
multivalent metal ions contained in the refill ink in such a manner as to become<br>
greater than one time and not over five times the amount of multivalent metal ions<br>
contained in the residual ink; in particular, it is important to adjust the amount of<br>
divalent metal ions contained in the refill ink.<br>
≤5&gt; An ink cartridge including: a container; and the refill ink<br>
according to any one of ≤1&gt; to ≤4&gt;, with which the container is refilled.<br>
The ink cartridge according to ≤5&gt; makes it possible to prevent ink<br>
cartridges from being discarded in huge numbers and reduce an environmental<br>
load by being refilled with the refill ink of the present invention.<br>
≤6&gt; The ink cartridge according to ≤5&gt;, wherein the ink cartridge<br>
includes no ink absorber therein.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>

FIG. 2 shows the ink cartridge of FIG. 1 with the inclusion<br>
of a case.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Refill Ink)<br>
A refill ink of the present invention is a refill ink with<br>
which a used ink cartridge is to be refilled, containing at least a<br>
colorant, a wetting agent and a surfactant, also containing a<br>
penetrant, and further containing additional constituents<br>
according to necessity.<br>
According to the present invention, in a mixed ink formed<br>
by mixing a residual ink remaining in the used ink cartridge and<br>
the refill ink at a volume ratio (residual ink - refill ink) of 1:1, the<br>
number A of coarse particles of 0.5μm or greater in diameter<br>
measured immediately after the mixing and the number B of<br>
coarse particles of 0.5um or greater in diameter measured after<br>
the mixed ink has been allowed to stand at 25°C and at RH of 50%<br>
for 24 hours satisfy the relationship B/A≤2, preferably B/A≤1.5,<br>
more preferably 0.5≤B/A≤1.2. When B/A exceeds 2, a filter<br>
becomes liable to clogging, and thus the jet stability of the mixed<br>
ink may be impaired.<br>
As used herein the phase "immediately after the mixing"<br>
means within 30 minutes after the residual ink and the refill ink<br>
have been mixed.<br><br>
It is desirable that there be a small number of coarse<br>
particles in the refill ink, more desirably the number of coarse<br>
particles is in the range of 30,000 to 500,000.<br>
Here, the number of coarse particles of 0.5μm or greater in<br>
diameter can be measured using ACCUSIZER 780 (manufactured<br>
by Particle Sizing Systems, Inc.), for example.<br>
Also, in a mixed ink formed by mixing a residual ink<br>
remaining in a used ink cartridge and a refill ink at a volume<br>
ratio (residual ink : refill ink) of 1-1, the viscosity (C) of the<br>
mixed ink at 25°C before stored and the viscosity (D) of the mixed<br>
ink at 25°C after stored at 25°C and at RH of 50% for one week<br>
preferably satisfy the relationship D/C≤2, more preferably<br>
D/C≤1.5, even more preferably 0.8≤D/C≤1.2. When D/C exceeds<br>
2, the viscosity becomes so high that the jet force of a head<br>
becomes insufficient, for this reason, jet stability may be<br>
impaired or droplets jetted may decrease in amount, and thus<br>
there may be a decrease in image density.<br>
As used herein the phrase "before stored" means within 30<br>
minutes after the residual ink and the refill ink have been mixed.<br>
The viscosity (C) of the refill ink at 25°C preferably stands<br>
at the viscosity of a residual (exclusively made) ink ± 2mPa-s,<br>
more preferably the viscosity of the residual (exclusively made)<br>
ink ± ImPa-s.<br>
Here, the viscosity can be measured using RL-500<br><br>
manufactured by Toki Sangyo Co., Ltd, for example.<br>
Also, in a mixed ink formed by mixing a residual ink<br>
remaining in a used ink cartridge and a refill ink at a volume<br>
ratio (residual ink : refill ink) of 1-1, the volume average particle<br>
diameter (E) of the mixed ink at 25°C before stored and the<br>
volume average particle diameter (E) of the mixed ink at 25°C<br>
after stored at 25°C and at RH of 50% for one week preferably<br>
satisfy the relationship F/E≤1.5, more preferably F/E≤1.3, even<br>
more preferably 0.9≤F/E≤1.2. When F/E exceeds 1.5, there may<br>
be a decrease in jet stability.<br>
As used herein the phrase "before stored" means within 30<br>
minutes after the residual ink and the refill ink have been mixed.<br>
It is desirable that the volume average particle diameter of<br>
the refill ink be 10nm to 200nm, more desirably 30nm to 150nm.<br>
Here, the volume average particle diameter can be<br>
measured using MICROTRAC UPA150 manufactured by Nikkiso<br>
Co., Ltd., for example.<br>
The content X of divalent metal ions in the refill ink and<br>
the content Y of divalent metal ions in a residual ink preferably<br>
satisfy the relationship 1≤X/Y≤5, more preferably 1≤X/Y≤3, even<br>
more preferably 1≤X/Y≤2. When X/Y exceeds 5, the colorant<br>
flocculates, and thus jet failure may be caused.<br>
The content of divalent metal ions in the refill ink<br>
preferably amounts to 1ppm to 50ppm. Additionally, examples<br><br>
of the divalent metal ions include Ca2+, Mg2+ and Ba2+.<br>
Here, the content of divalent metal ions in the ink can be<br>
measured by ion chromatography or the like, for example.<br>
The refill ink of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose as<br>
long as it is furnished with the aforesaid characteristics; however,<br>
as described above, the refill ink contains at least a colorant, a<br>
wetting agent and a surfactant, also contains a penetrant, and<br>
further contains additional constituents according to necessity.<br>

177, 178, 179, 184, 185, 190, 193, 202, 209 and 219.<br>
Pigments for cyan are not particularly limited and can be<br>
suitably selected according to the purpose; examples thereof<br>
include C. I. Pigment Blues 1, 2, 3, 15 (Copper Phthalocyanine<br>
Blue R), 15:1, 15:2, 15:3 (Phthalocyanine Blue G), 15:4, 15:6<br>
(Phthalocyanine Blue E), 15:34, 16, 17:1, 22, 56, 60 and 63; and C.<br>
1. vat blues 4 and 60.<br>
Pigments for neutral colors are not particularly limited<br>
and can be suitably selected according to the purpose; examples<br>
of pigments for red, green and blue include C. I. Pigment Reds<br>
177, 194 and 224; C. I. Pigment Orange 43; C. I. Pigment Violets 3,<br>
19, 23 and 37," and C. I. Pigment Greens 7 and 36.<br>
Also, suitable examples of the pigments include a pigment<br>
whose surface is modified such that at least one kind of<br><br>
hydrophilic group is bonded to the surface of the pigment directly<br>
or via another atom group (sometimes referred to as<br>
"self-dispersing pigment"). In this case, a method of chemically<br>
bonding a certain functional group (a functional group such as a<br>
sulfone group or carboxyl group) to the surface of pigment, or a<br>
method of subjecting the surface to wet oxidation with the use of<br>
at least either a hypohalous acid or a salt thereof is employed, for<br>
example. In particular, the form in which a carboxyl group is<br>
bonded to the surface of a pigment dispersed in water is<br>
particularly favorable. Since the surface of the pigment is<br>
modified such that a carboxyl group is bonded thereto, not only<br>
does dispersion stability improve, but also high printing quality<br>
can be obtained and the water resistance of a recording medium<br>
after printing improves further.<br>
Superior in redispersibility after dried, an ink containing<br>
the self-dispersing pigment does not cause clogging even when<br>
printing has stopped being conducted for a long time and a water<br>
content of the ink in the vicinity of a nozzle of an ink-jet head has<br>
evaporated, and thus the ink easily enables favorable printing<br>
with a simple cleaning operation. Such a self-dispersing<br>
pigment creates a particularly great synergy effect and makes it<br>
possible to obtain high-quality images that are even more reliable,<br>
when combined with the after-mentioned surfactants and<br>
penetrants.<br><br>
Besides pigments of the above-mentioned form, it is also<br>
possible to use a polymer emulsion in which a color material that<br>
is insoluble or sparingly soluble in water is contained in polymer<br>
particles. As used herein the phrase "a polymer emulsion in<br>
which a color material is contained" means a polymer emulsion in<br>
which a color material is encapsulated in polymer particles<br>
and/or a polymer emulsion in which a color material is adsorbed<br>
onto the surface of polymer particles. In this case, it is not that<br>
the whole color material needs to be encapsulated or adsorbed,<br>
but that the color material may be dispersed in the emulsion to<br>
such an extent that the effects of the present invention are not<br>
impaired. The color material is not particularly limited and can<br>
be suitably selected according to the purpose as long as it is<br>
insoluble or sparingly soluble in water and able to be contained in<br>
the polymer; examples thereof include dyes such as oil-soluble<br>
dyes and dispersive dyes, and the pigments mentioned as the<br>
specific examples. Amongst these, use of the pigments is<br>
preferable in terms of the light resistance of recorded materials<br>
to be obtained.<br>
Examples of the polymer which forms the polymer<br>
emulsion include vinyl polymers, polyester polymers and<br>
polyurethane polymers! amongst these, vinyl polymers and<br>
polyester polymers are particularly preferable.<br>
Further, a pigment dispersed into an aqueous medium by<br><br>
means of a dispersant can be additionally used. A known<br>
dispersant used to prepare a conventionally known pigment<br>
dispersion solution can be applied to the dispersant; examples<br>
thereof include polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, acrylic<br>
acid-acrylonitrile copolymer, vinyl acetate-acrylic acid ester<br>
copolymer, acrylic acid-acrylic acid alkyl ester copolymer,<br>
styrene-acrylic acid copolymer, styrene-methacrylic acid<br>
copolymer, styrene-acrylic acid-acrylic acid alkyl ester copolymer,<br>
styrene-methacrylic acid-acrylic acid alkyl ester copolymer,<br>
styrene-a-methylstyrene-acrylic acid copolymer,<br>
styrene-a-methylstyrene-acrylic acid copolymeracrylic acid alkyl<br>
ester copolymer, styrene-maleic acid copolymer,<br>
vinylnaphthalene-maleic acid copolymer, vinyl acetate-ethylene<br>
copolymer, vinyl acetate-fatty acid vinylethylene copolymer, vinyl<br>
acetate-maleic acid ester copolymer, vinyl acetate-crotonic acid<br>
copolymer and vinyl acetate-acrylic acid copolymer.<br>
It is desirable that the mass-average molecular mass of the<br>
dispersant be 3,000 to 50,000, more desirably 5,000 to 30,000,<br>
even more desirably 7,000 to 15,000.<br>
The dispersant is suitably added to such an extent that a<br>
pigment is stably dispersed and other effects of the present<br>
invention are not lost, and it is desirable that the additive<br>
amount thereof be 1:0.06 to 1:3 in mass ratio (pigment :<br>
dispersant), more desirably 1:0.125 to 1:3.<br><br>
It is desirable that a carboxyl group be bonded to the<br>
dispersant. When a carboxyl group is bonded to a dispersant,<br>
not only does dispersion stability improve, but also high printing<br>
quality can be obtained and the water resistance of a recording<br>
medium after printing improves further. Moreover, the effect of<br>
preventing offsetting of the printed letters/characters can be<br>
obtained. In particular, when a pigment dispersed by means of a<br>
dispersant to which a carboxyl group is bonded is used together<br>
with a penetrant, a sufficient drying rate can be obtained and<br>
such an effect can be obtained that offsetting is reduced, even in<br>
the case where a recording medium which is relatively large in<br>
size such as plain paper is printed. It is inferred that this is due<br>
to the fact that since the dissociation constant of carboxylic acids<br>
is smaller than that of other acid radicals, the solubility of the<br>
dispersant itself lowers as the pH value of the ink lowers and the<br>
carboxylic acids interact with multivalent metal ions such as a<br>
calcium ion that are present in the vicinity of the recording<br>
medium surface, after the pigment has been attached to the<br>
recording medium, and thus the dispersant itself and the pigment<br>
flocculate.<br>
Besides the pigments, the following dyes can be employed<br>
as the colorant.<br>
The water-soluble dyes are dyes classified into acid dyes,<br>
direct dyes, basic dyes, reactive dyes and edible dyes according to<br><br>
the color index, preferably ones which are superior in water<br>
resistance and light resistance.<br>
Examples of the acid dyes and the edible dyes include C. I.<br>

Food Reds 7, 9 and 14; and C. I. Food Blacks 1 and 2.<br>
Examples of the direct dyes include C. I. Direct Yellows 1,<br>

Blacks 19, 22, 32, 38, 51, 56, 71, 74, 75, 77, 154, 168 and 171.<br>
Examples of the basic dyes include C. I. Basic Yellows 1, 2,<br>
11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 36, 40, 41, 45, 49, 51,<br>
53, 63, 64, 65, 67, 70, 73, 77, 87 and 91; C. I. Basic Reds 2, 12, 13,<br>

68, 69, 70, 73, 78, 82, 102, 104, 109 and 112; C. I. Basic Blues 1, 3,<br>
5, 7, 9, 21, 22, 26, 35, 41, 45, 47, 54, 62, 65, 66, 67, 69, 75, 77, 78,<br>
89, 92, 93, 105, 117, 120, 122, 124, 129, 137, 141, 147 and 155;<br>
and C. I. Basic Blacks 2 and 8.<br>
Examples of the reactive dyes include C. I. Reactive Blacks<br>
3, 4, 7, 11, 12 and 17; C. I. Reactive Yellows 1, 5, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21,<br><br>
22, 25, 40, 47, 51, 55, 65 and 67; C. I. Reactive Reds 1, 14, 17, 25,<br>
26, 32, 37, 44, 46, 55, 60, 66, 74, 79, 96 and 97; and C. I. Reactive<br>
Blues 1, 2, 7, 14, 15, 23, 32, 35, 38, 41, 63, 80 and 95.<br>
It is desirable that the average particle diameter of a<br>
pigment used in the ink be in the range of 10nm to 200nm. As<br>
used herein the term "average particle diameter" denotes a value<br>
of average particle diameter measured at a cumulative<br>
percentage of 50% in the volume-based particle size distribution.<br>
To measure a value of average particle diameter at a cumulative<br>
percentage of 50% in the volume-based particle size distribution,<br>
it is possible to use, for example, a method referred to as<br>
"dynamic light scattering method (Doppler scattered light<br>
analysis)" in which a particle undergoing Brownian motion in an<br>
ink is irradiated with laser light, and the particle diameter is<br>
calculated from the variation of the frequency (light frequency) of<br>
the light (backscattered light) returning from the particle.<br>
When the average particle diameter is smaller than 10nm,<br>
dispersion stability in the ink is impaired, and the image density<br>
at the time of printing becomes inferior as a result. In addition,<br>
there will be another problem in which microparticulation of the<br>
pigment to that level is costly. Conversely, when the average<br>
particle diameter is greater than 200nm, the fixation properties<br>
of images become inferior, flocculation is liable to arise during a<br>
long period of storage, and thus clogging is liable to arise.<br><br>
The content of the colorant in the ink is not particularly<br>
limited and can be suitably selected according to the purpose,"<br>
however, it is preferably 0.5% by mass to 15% by mass, more<br>
preferably 5% by mass to 12% by mass.<br>
- Wetting Agent -<br>
The wetting agent is not particularly limited and can be<br>
suitably selected according to the purpose? examples thereof<br>
include multivalent alcohols, multivalent alcohol alkyl ethers,<br>
multivalent alcohol aryl ethers, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
compounds, amides, amines, sulfur-containing compounds,<br>
propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate. These may be used<br>
alone or in combination. Amongst these, multivalent alcohol<br>
alkyl ethers and multivalent alcohol aryl ethers are particularly<br>
preferable. Inclusion of such wetting agents makes it possible to<br>
prevent a water content of an ink from evaporating, more<br>
favorably prevent curb deposition of a colorant at an ink-jet<br>
orifice and jet failure caused by a rise in viscosity, and thus<br>
provide a pigment ink which is high in jet reliability.<br>
Examples of the multivalent alcohols include ethylene<br>
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polypropylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
1,4-butanediol, 3-methyl-l,3-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol,<br>
1,6-hexanediol, glycerol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, l,2,4butanetriol,<br>
l,2,3butanetriol and petriol.<br><br>
Examples of the multivalent alcohol alkyl ethers include<br>
ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monoethyl ether.<br>
Examples of the multivalent alcohol aryl ethers include<br>
ethylene glycol monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl<br>
ether.<br>
Examples of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
compounds include N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
N-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone,<br>
1,3-dimethylimidazolidinone and e-caprolactam.<br>
Examples of the amides include formamide,<br>
N-methylformamide and N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Examples of the amines include monoethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine<br>
and triethylamine.<br>
Examples of the sulfur-containing compounds include<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane and thiodiethanol.<br>
Amongst these, glycerin, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,<br>
triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol,<br>
tripropylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol,<br>
l,4butanediol, 3methyl-1,3-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol,<br>
l,5pentanediol, tetraethylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol,<br><br>
2methyl-2,4-pentanediol, polyethylene glycol, 1,2,4-butanetriol,<br>
1,2,6-hexanetriol, thiodiglycol, 2pyrrolidone,<br>
Nmethyl-2-pyrrolidone and Nhydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone are<br>
preferable, with glycerin, 3-methyl-l,3-butanediol and<br>
2-pyrrolidone being particularly preferable, in that it is possible<br>
to obtain superior effects on solubility and prevention of jet<br>
characteristic failure caused by evaporation of a water content.<br>
It is desirable that the content of the wetting agent in the<br>
ink be 5% by mass to 30% by mass, more desirably 10% by mass to<br>
30% by mass. When the content is less than 5% by mass, the<br>
effects given by adding the wetting agent are insufficient; when<br>
the content is greater than 30% by mass, the viscosity of the<br>
aqueous ink becomes high, thus possibly affecting jet stability.<br>
- Surfactant -<br>
The surfactant is not particularly limited and can be<br>
suitably selected according to the purpose", examples thereof<br>
include anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, ampholytic<br>
surfactants, fluorine-based surfactants and silicone "based<br>
surfactants. Addition of such surfactants makes it possible to<br>
obtain high-quality images with enhanced penetrativeness to<br>
paper and rapid drying properties, in which the bleeding of<br>
letters/characters and boundaries is further reduced.<br>
Examples of the anionic surfactants include<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl ether acetate, dodecylbenzene sulfonate,<br><br>
laurate and salts of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate.<br>
Examples of the nonionic surfactants include acetylene<br>
glycol-based surfactants, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene alkyl ester<br>
and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester.<br>
Examples of the acetylene glycol-based surfactants include<br>
2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol,<br>
3,6-dimethyl-4octine-3,6-diol and 3,5-dimethyl-l-hexyne-3ol.<br>
Examples of the acetylene glycol-based surfactants as<br>
commercially-supplied products include SURFYNOLs 104, 82,<br>
465, 485 and TG produced by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.<br>
(USA).<br>
Examples of the ampholytic surfactants include<br>
laurylamino propionate, lauryldimethylbetaine,<br>
stearyldimethylbetaine and lauryldihydroxyethylbetaine.<br>
Specific examples thereof include lauryl dimethyl amine oxide,<br>
myristyl dimethyl amine oxide, stearyl dimethyl amine oxide,<br>
dihydroxy ethyl lauryl amine oxide, polyoxyethylene coconut oil<br>
alkyldimethyl amine oxide, dimethylalkyl (coconut) betaine and<br>
dimethyllaurylbetaine.<br>
Amongst the surfactants, nonionic surfactants and anionic<br>
surfactants are preferable, and polyoxyethylene alkyl<br>
ether-based surfactants and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether<br>
acetate-based surfactants are particularly preferable. These<br><br>
may be used alone or in combinaiton. When a single surfactant<br>
is sparingly soluble in a recording solution, it can be made<br>
soluble by being mixed with other surfactant(s) to exist stably.<br>
Additionally, it is desirable that inorganic salts produced as<br>
byproducts when surfactants are synthesized be purified by an<br>
ion-exchange resin and removed.<br>
Suitable examples of commercially-supplied surfactants<br>
include the BT series obtainable from Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd.,<br>
the SOFTANOL series obtainable from Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd.,<br>
DISPANOL obtainable from NOF Corporation, the NIKKOL ETC<br>
series and the NIKKOL AKYPO series obtainable from Nikko<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd. and the BEAULIGHT series obtainable from<br>
Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.<br>
In order to improve image quality further, it is desirable to<br>
use fluorinebased surfactants or silicone-based surfactants with<br>
great penetrativeness, with fluorine-based surfactants being<br>
particularly desirable.<br>
The silicone-based surfactants are not particularly limited<br>
and can be suitably selected according to the purpose, preferably<br>
ones that do not decompose even at high pH values; examples<br>
thereof include side-chain-modified polydimethylsiloxane,<br>
bothterminalmodified polydimethylsiloxane,<br>
either-terminal-modified polydimethylsiloxane and<br>
side-chain-both-terminal-modified polydimethylsiloxane.<br><br>
Amongst these, ones having polyoxyethylene groups or<br>
polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene groups as modification groups<br>
are particularly preferable in that they exhibit favorable<br>
characteristics as aqueous surfactants.<br>
As such surfactants, suitably synthesized surfactants or<br>
commercially-supplied surfactants may be used. The<br>
commercially-supplied surfactants can be easily obtained from<br>
BYK Additives &amp; Instruments, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. and<br>
Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd., for example.<br>
Examples of the fluorine-based surfactants include<br>
perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid compounds, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic<br>
compounds, perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid ester compounds,<br>
perfluoroalkyl ethylene oxide adducts, and polyoxyalkylene ether<br>
polymer compounds having perfluoroalkylether groups as side<br>
chains. Amongst these, polyoxyalkylene ether polymer<br>
compounds having perfluoroalkylether groups as side chains are<br>
particularly preferable because they are low in foaming property<br>
and also in the bioaccumulation potential of fluorine compounds<br>
that is deemed to be a problem these days and are therefore safe.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid compounds<br>
include perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids and perfluoroalkyl<br>
sulfonates.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic compounds<br>
include perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and perfluoroalkyl<br><br>
carboxylates.<br>
Examples of the perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid ester<br>
compounds include perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid esters and<br>
salts of perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid esters.<br>
Examples of the polyoxyalkylene ether polymer compounds<br>
having perfluoroalkylether groups as side chains include<br>
polyoxyalkylene ether polymers having perfluoroalkylether<br>
groups as side chains, sulfuric acid ester salts of polyoxyalkylene<br>
ether polymers having perfluoroalkylether groups as side chains,<br>
and salts of polyoxyalkylene ether polymers having<br>
perfluoroalkylether groups as side chains.<br>
Examples of counterions for salts in these fluorine-based<br>
surfactants include Li, Na, K, NH4, NH3CH2CH2OH,<br>
NH2(CH2CH20H)2 and NH(CH2CH2OH)3.<br>
As the fluorine-based surfactants, suitably synthesized<br>
surfactants or commercially-supplied surfactants may be used.<br>
Examples of the commercially-supplied surfactants<br>
include SURFLONs Sill, S112, S113, S121, S-131, S-132,<br>
S-141 and S-145 (all of which are produced by Asahi Glass Co.,<br>
Ltd.), FLUORADs FC-93, FC-95, F098, FC129, FC135,<br>
FC-170C, FC-430 and F0431 (all of which are produced by<br>
Sumitomo 3M Limited), MEGAFACs F-470, F-1405 and F-474 (all<br>
of which are produced by Dainippon Ink And Chemicals,<br>
Incorporated), ZONYLs TBS, FSP, FSA, FSN100, FSN, FSO100,<br><br>
FSO, FS-300 and UR (all of which are produced by E. I. du Pont<br>
de Nemours and Company), FT-110, FT-250, FT-251, FT-400S,<br>
FT-150 and FT-400SW (all of which are produced by Neos<br>
Company Limited), and PF-151N (produced by OMNOVA<br>
Solutions Inc.). Amongst these, ZONYLs FS-300, FSN, FSN-100<br>
and FSO (all of which are produced by E. I. du Pont de Nemours<br>
and Company) are particularly preferable in that they are<br>
excellent in reliability and coloring improvement.<br>
It is desirable that the content of the surfactant in the ink<br>
be 0.01% by mass to 5.0% by mass, more desirably 0.5% by mass<br>
to 3% by mass. When the content is less than 0.01% by mass, the<br>
addition of the surfactant is not effective; when the content is<br>
greater than 5.0% by mass, penetrativeness to a recording<br>
medium becomes greater than necessary, and so there may be a<br>
decrease in image density or offsetting may arise.<br>
- Penetrant -<br>
For the penetrant, a polyol compound, a glycol ether<br>
compound or the like is used; in particular, at least either a polyol<br>
compound or glycol ether compound having eight or more carbon<br>
atoms is suitable.<br>
When the polyol compound has fewer than eight carbon<br>
atoms, a recording medium may be stained at the time of<br>
double-side printing because of insufficient penetrativeness, and<br>
an image may be poorly filled with image elements or dots<br><br>
because ink does not sufficiently spread over the recording<br>
medium, so that there may be a decrease in letter/character<br>
quality and image density.<br>
Suitable examples of the polyol compound having eight or<br>
more carbon atoms include 2ethyll,3-hexanediol and<br>
2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol.<br>
The glycol ether compound is not particularly limited and<br>
can be suitably selected according to the purpose. Examples<br>
thereof include multivalent alcohol alkyl ethers such as ethylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monoethyl ether"&gt; and<br>
multivalent alcohol aryl ethers such as ethylene glycol<br>
monophenyl ether and ethylene glycol monobenzyl ether.<br>
The additive amount of the penetrant to the ink is not<br>
particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the<br>
purpose; however, it is preferably 0.1% by mass to 20% by mass,<br>
more preferably 0.5% by mass to 10% by mass.<br>
- Antifoaming Agent -<br>
An antifoaming agent may be added to the ink of the<br>
present invention. Siliconebased antifoaming agents, many of<br>
which are particularly superior in foam-breaking effect, are<br>
classified into oil type, compound type, self-emulsification type,<br><br>
emulsion type and the like; when use thereof in an aqueous<br>
system is considered, use of the selfemulsification type or the<br>
emulsion type is preferable in that reliability is secured. Also,<br>
modified silicone-based antifoaming agents such as<br>
amino-modified antifoaming agents, carbinol-modified<br>
antifoaming agents, methacryl-modified antifoaming agents,<br>
polyether-modified antifoaming agents, alkyl-modified<br>
antifoaming agents, higher fatty acid ester modified antifoaming<br>
agents and alkylene oxide modified antifoaming agents may be<br>
used.<br>
The additive amount of the antifoaming agent is not<br>
particularly limited and can be suitably selected according to the<br>
purpose; however, it is preferably 0.001% by mass to 3% by mass,<br>
more preferably 0.05% by mass to 0.5% by mass.<br>
Examples of available commercially-supplied antifoaming<br>
agents include silicone antifoaming agents (such as KS-508,<br>
KS-531, KM-72 and KM-85) produced by ShinEtsu Chemical Co.,<br>
Ltd., silicone antifoaming agents (such as Q2-3183A and SH5510)<br>
produced by Dow Corning Toray Co.,Ltd., silicone antifoaming<br>
agents (such as SAG30) produced by Nippon Unicar Company<br>
Limited, and antifoaming agents (such as the ADEKANATE<br>
series) produced by Adeka Corporation.<br>
— Additional Constituents —<br>
The additional constituents are not particularly limited<br><br>
and can be suitably selected according to necessity." examples<br>
thereof include a pH adjuster, a preservative/antimold agent, an<br>
anticorrosive, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, an oxygen<br>
absorber and a light stabilizer.<br>
Examples of the preservative/antimold agent include<br>
l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, sodium dehydroacetate, sodium<br>
sorbate, 2-pyridinethiol-l-sodium oxide, sodium benzoate and<br>
sodium pentachlorophenol.<br>
The pH adjuster is not particularly limited as long as it<br>
can adjust the pH of the prepared ink to 7 or greater without<br>
adversely affecting it, and any compound can be employed<br>
according to the purpose. Examples of the pH adjuster include<br>
amines such as diethanolamine and triethanolamineJ hydroxides<br>
of alkali metal elements such as lithium hydroxide, sodium<br>
hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; ammonium hydroxide,<br>
quaternary ammonium hydroxide and quaternary phosphonium<br>
hydroxide; and carbonates of alkali metals such as lithium<br>
carbonate, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.<br>
Examples of the anticorrosive include acid sulfite, sodium<br>
thiosulfate, ammonium thiodiglycolate, diisopropylammonium<br>
nitrite, pentaerythritol tetranitrate and dicyclohexylammonium<br>
nitrite.<br>
Examples of the antioxidant include phenol antioxidants<br>
(including hindered phenol antioxidants), amine antioxidants,<br><br>
sulfur antioxidants and phosphorus antioxidants.<br>
The refill ink of the present invention used in an ink-jet<br>
recording process is produced by dispersing or dissolving at least<br>
a colorant, a wetting agent and a surfactant, with additional<br>
constituents included according to necessity, in an aqueous<br>
solvent, and further, mixing the ingredients by means of<br>
agitation according to necessity. The dispersion can, for<br>
example, be conducted by means of a sand mill, a homogenizer, a<br>
ball mill, a paint shaker, an ultrasonic disperser, etc., and the<br>
agitation/mixing can be conducted by means of a typical agitator<br>
with an agitating blade, a magnetic stirrer, a high-speed<br>
disperser, etc.<br>
The coloring of the ink is not particularly limited and can<br>
be suitably selected according to the purpose; for example, the<br>
ink is colored yellow, magenta, cyan or black. When recording is<br>
conducted using an ink set in which two or more of the colors are<br>
used together, it is possible to form a multicolor image, and when<br>
recording is conducted using an ink set in which all the colors are<br>
used together, it is possible to form a full-color image.<br>
(Ink Cartridge)<br>
The ink cartridge of the present invention includes a<br>
container, and the refill ink of the present invention with which<br>
the container is refilled, and further includes additional members<br>
and the like suitably selected according to necessity. It is<br><br>
possible to prevent massive disposal of ink cartridges and thus to<br>
reduce an environmental load by refilling the ink cartridge with<br>
the refill ink of the present invention.<br>
The ink cartridge does not have an ink absorber therein.<br>
This makes it easier to refill the ink cartridge with the refill ink.<br>
The container is not particularly limited, and the shape,<br>
structure, size, material and the like thereof can be suitably<br>
selected according to the purpose; suitable examples thereof<br>
include a container having at least an ink bag or the like formed<br>
of an aluminum laminated film, resinous film, etc.<br>
Next, the ink cartridge will be explained with reference to<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2. Here, FIG. 1 is a figure showing one example of<br>
an ink cartridge of the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a figure<br>
showing the ink cartridge 10 of FIG. 1 with the inclusion of a case<br>
(external cover).<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the ink cartridge 10 fills up as the<br>
refill ink flows from an ink inlet 42 into an ink bag 41, and the<br>
ink inlet 42 is closed by fusion after air is discharged. When the<br>
ink cartridge 10 is used, an ink outlet 43 formed of a rubber<br>
member is penetrated by a needle of an apparatus main body, and<br>
the ink cartridge 10 is thus installed in the apparatus.<br>
The ink bag 41 is formed of an air-impermeable packing<br>
member such as an aluminum laminated film. As shown in FIG.<br>
2, this ink bag 41 is normally housed in a cartridge case 44 made<br><br>
of plastic, and used in such a manner as to be detachably<br>
mounted on a variety of ink-jet recording apparatuses.<br>

25°C and at RH of 50% and also at 50°C and at RH of 30% and<br>
measured for their viscosities and average particle diameters<br>
before and after the storage. The viscosity of each mixed ink<br>
was measured at 25°C using RL-500 produced by Toki Sangyo Co.,<br><br>
Ltd. The volume average particle diameter of each mixed ink<br>
was measured using a MICROTRAC UPA150 produced by Nikkiso<br>
Co., Ltd., using a mixed ink solution diluted to a pigment<br>
concentration of 0.01% by mass. The results are shown in Tables<br>
3 and 4.<br><br><br><br><evaluation evaluation of jet stability><br>
An continuous printing evaluation was carried out on<br>
mixed inks each formed by combining any of the residual inks Nos.<br>
1 to 4 and any of the refill inks Nos. 1 to 8 as shown in Table at a<br>
volume ratio of 1:1.<br>
Using a GELJET printer (IPSiO G717 produced by Ricoh<br>
Company, Ltd.) as an evaluation device, continuous printing was<br>
conducted for a chart provided with solid images of respective<br><br>
colors by discharging corresponding color inks in equal amounts<br>
per printing, followed by determination of the number of print<br>
sheets in which no image blur was generated. The numbers of<br>
sheets that succeeded in continuous printing with no image blur<br>
are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
According to the results in Tables 2 to 5, the inks of<br>
Examples 1 to 6, whose B/A values in Evaluation 1 were 2 or less,<br>
proved favorable in terms of both storage stability in Evaluation<br>
2 and jet stability in Evaluation 3.<br>
Meanwhile, the inks of Comparative Examples 1 and 2,<br>
whose B/A values in Evaluation 1 were greater than 2, proved<br><br>
unfavorable in terms of both storage stability in Evaluation 2 and<br>
jet stability in Evaluation 3.<br>
