(New) Description<br>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for the<br>
safe monitoring and evaluation of operating states of at le-<br>
ast one traffic control system, especially at least one con-<br>
trol device of an electronic railway control centre for rail-<br>
borne traffic, and the use of the same.<br>
Such methods and arrangements are generally known with the<br>
safe operation and remote control of such a traffic control<br>
system requiring a safe operator station. According to prior<br>
art, a distinction is made essentially between switching me-<br>
thods, read-back methods and single-channel read-back meth-<br>
ods. The switching method is based on switching between two<br>
graphic systems by means of a switch followed by a comparison<br>
of two message graphics. The switching and comparison takes<br>
place cyclically with specific timing. The safety of the<br>
switching method depends almost exclusively on operating per-<br>
sonnel. The read-back method is based on comparison of two<br>
message graphics by means of a graphic system, with the two<br>
message graphics being retrieved, or "read back" to the data<br>
processing device for comparison between them, after they are<br>
displayed on a screen or similar. A read-back of this kind<br>
leads to a certain time delay. A marked disadvantage with<br>
such a read-back is the associated danger of loss of data<br>
and/or information on the path from the screen or similar<br>
back to the data processing device, with the safety require-<br>
ments thus being influenced. Finally, the single-channel<br>
read-back method is based on reactive safety by a single-<br>
channel electronic structure.  In other respects, the same<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
disadvantages as with the read-back method can be observed<br>
with a single-channel read-back method. The read-back method<br>
or the single-channel read-back method requires extremely<br>
powerful hardware and software as well as a very great<br>
storage capacities, not least because of the comparison, from<br>
the memories of the two message images as a whole. However,<br>
the processing times are frequently unsatisfactorily too<br>
long. The latter methods also have the disadvantage that, be-<br>
cause of the very large storage capacities required, the mes-<br>
sage graphics to be compared with each other are in general<br>
not completely compared, but instead are only compared by<br>
segments, which in turn can impair safety. Finally, the lat-<br>
ter methods also require a "secure computer" which further-<br>
more very disadvantageously increases the construction and<br>
costs of arrangements for performing these methods.<br>
WO 2004/110845 A1 describes a method for the safe monitoring<br>
and evaluation of operating states of at least one traffic<br>
control system, especially of at least one control device of<br>
an electronic railway control centre for rail-borne traffic.<br>
By this method data and/or information on an operating state<br>
are obtained by means of the at least one control device.<br>
This method bases on the principle of a so-called "safe<br>
operator station". Data and/or information referring to dif-<br>
ferent operating states of a railway control center are de-<br>
tected by different sensors and supplied to a "safe operator<br>
station" known per se. The "safe operator station" preferably<br>
comprises three computers, which process the data and/or in-<br>
formation delivered by the sensors independently from each<br>
other and transmit them to an operating interface via inter-<br>
connection of an interface in form of two outputs. Both the<br>
outputs, however, are only transmitted to the operating in-<br>
terface in case, if two of the three computers have a corre-<br>
sponding output value. Both the outputs then are subjected an<br>
additional method of monitoring and evaluation by the or in<br>
the operating interface, respectively.<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
From EP 0 856 792 A2 is known a method for a safe display on<br>
a screen, basing on the so-called read-back method. Two<br>
message graphics are compared by a graphic system. Upon<br>
having displayed on the screen both message graphics are<br>
brought back or read back to the data processing device, to<br>
compare them with each other.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a method<br>
and an arrangement for the safe monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states of at least one traffic control system, by<br>
means of which the above disadvantages can be prevented,<br>
which is of particularly simple design, fast in operation and<br>
at the same time reliable, with outstanding immunity and sys-<br>
tem stability, and furthermore very cost effective, and also<br>
to provide for its use.<br>
The object is achieved with respect to a technical method in<br>
a surprisingly simple manner by the features of Claim 1.<br>
According to this, by the embodiment of the method according<br>
to the invention for the safe monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states of at least one traffic control system, es-<br>
pecially at least one control device of an electronic railway<br>
control centre for rail-borne traffic, com-<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
b)	simultaneous transmission of the obtained or detected<br>
data and/or information on the operating state from the<br>
at least one control device through two independent<br>
channels  to  two  separate  data  processing  devices<br>
communicating with each other;<br>
c)	receiving and processing, by the two data processing<br>
devices,  of  the  obtained  or  detected  data  and/or<br>
information on the operating state of the at least one<br>
control device;<br>
d)	visualizing of the received and processed data and/or<br>
information on the operating  state  on a  screen or<br>
similar by at least one of the two data processing<br>
devices;<br>
e)	pixel-accurate generation of a video signal according to<br>
the DVI (Digital Visual Interface) standard (referred to<br>
in  the  following  as  "DVI  video  signal")  from the<br>
received and processed data and/or information on the<br>
operating state, in each case by means of the two data<br>
processing devices,  and transmitting of the two DVI<br>
video signals from the two data processing devices to a<br>
video signal comparison device;<br>
f)	comparing with each other and evaluating the two DVI<br>
video signals by means of the video signal comparison<br>
device; and<br>
g)	generating or suppressing of a pulse or signal in<br>
response to the evaluation of the comparison between the<br>
two DVI video signals, as well as forwarding of said<br>
signal or pulse from the video signal comparison device<br>
to the two data processing devices for further operation<br>
and/or control of the at least one control device, or<br>
for blocking the further operation and/or control of the<br>
at least one control device;<br>
a method which is of a particularly simple design and can<br>
also be directly addressed and therefore operates quickly for<br>
the secure monitoring and evaluation of operating states of<br>
at least one traffic control system is achieved overall. In<br>
this context,  it is a quite special advantage that,  in<br><br>
addition to the essential aspect of a high operating safety<br>
and reliability, the method according to the invention<br>
compares and evaluates always exclusively the bit streams of<br>
two video signals according to the DVI (Digital Visual<br>
Interface) standard. The comparison of data and/or<br>
information in accordance with steps e) and f) takes place by<br>
means of the bit stream of the two video signals according to<br>
the DVI (Digital Visual Interface) standard and, in fact,<br>
online and parallel to the visualization of the obtained and<br>
processed data and/or information on the operating state on<br>
the screen or similar in accordance with step d) . The DVI<br>
standard, which is largely based on the Video Electronics<br>
Standards Association and was implemented in practice by the<br>
DDWG (Digital Display Working Group), is in this case not<br>
used for visualizing the obtained and processed data<br>
and/information on the operating state on the screen or<br>
similar, but is instead used for the actual comparison with<br>
each other and evaluation of the two DVI video signals.<br>
Simultaneity of the release of image data for online data<br>
comparison can be achieved by the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, the requirements for an extremely powerful<br>
hardware and software - as in the previous prior art - can be<br>
substantially reduced without adversely affecting the<br>
operating safety and reliability. Also, with the method<br>
according to the invention, a "secure computer", such as with<br>
previously known methods, is not necessary. The method<br>
according to the invention can in fact even be achieved using<br>
three conventional, commercially available data processing<br>
devices or computers, for example with standardized personal<br>
computers, of which, if possible, two should be by the same<br>
manufacturer and to the same specification and with the same<br>
equipment (hardware and software versions). Because of this,<br>
these two data processing devices or computers can be two<br>
"non-secure computers" or "non-safe computers", respectively,<br>
or "non-reliable computers", respectively. The video signal<br><br>
comparison can be realized by means of a data processing<br>
device or computer which is arranged between the two data<br>
processing devices or computers of approximately similar<br>
design and differs from the two data processing devices or<br>
computers of approximately similar design, with respect to<br>
manufacturer, specification and equipment.<br>
On the other hand, the operating safety and reliability of<br>
the method according to the invention can be further<br>
substantially increased if previous high-performance hardware<br>
and software as well as quite large storage capacities are<br>
used unchanged.<br>
Compared with methods known from prior art, the method<br>
according to the invention is further distinguished in that<br>
comparison of the two DVI video signals in their entirety is<br>
possible in a simple and fast manner. With the method<br>
according to the invention, the operating safety and<br>
reliability can be still further improved compared with<br>
conventional methods, which are based merely on a comparison<br>
of reduced data and/or information amounts.<br>
Not least, this also results at the same time in a remarkably<br>
cost-effective method for the safe monitoring and evaluation<br>
of operating states of at least one traffic control system,<br>
because its immunity and system stability remains high<br>
without impairment even in the event of any adaptation of the<br>
hardware and software or possible reduction in the storage<br>
capacities.<br>
Further quite advantageous details of the method according to<br>
the invention for the safe monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states of at least one traffic control system are<br>
described in Claims 2 to 26.<br>
Furthermore, with regard to a technical device, this object<br>
is achieved in a surprisingly simple manner by the features<br><br>
of Claim 27.<br>
By means of the inventive embodiment of the inventive<br>
arrangement for the safe monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states of at least one traffic control system,<br>
especially of at least one control device of an electronic<br>
railway control centre for rail-borne traffic, comprising two<br>
separate data processing devices communicating with each<br>
other connected to each other, each of which having a device<br>
for receiving and processing obtained data and/or information<br>
on an operating state of the at least one control device, a<br>
device for visualizing the obtained and processed data and/or<br>
information on the operating state on a screen or similar and<br>
a device for the pixel-accurate generation of a visual signal<br>
in accordance with the DVI (Digital Visual Interface)<br>
standard from the obtained and processed data and/or<br>
information on the operating state, and a video signal<br>
comparison device for comparing and evaluating the two DVI<br>
video signals with respect to each other as well as for the<br>
generation or suppression of a pulse or signal in response to<br>
the evaluation of the comparison between the two DVI video<br>
signals and also forwarding of same from the video signal<br>
comparison device to the two data processing devices for<br>
further operation and/or control of the at least one control<br>
device, or for blocking the further operation and/or control<br>
of the at least one control device, an overall arrangement is<br>
achieved which is of particularly simple design and<br>
furthermore can be directly addressed and therefore operates<br>
quickly. At the same time, a high operating reliability is<br>
guaranteed with the arrangement according to the invention<br>
because only the bit streams of two DVI video signals are<br>
compared with each other and evaluated. Of quite particular<br>
importance for all of this is that comparison of the two DVI<br>
video signals is based on their digital protocol, which does<br>
not differ during the identical image processing of the two<br>
parallel-operating data processing devices. By the way, the<br>
requirements of an extremely high-performance hardware and<br><br>
software - as required in the previous prior art - can be<br>
substantially reduced, without impairment of the operating<br>
safety and reliability. On the contrary, the operating safety<br>
and reliability of the arrangement according to the invention<br>
can be still substantially increased if previous high-<br>
performance hardware and software as well as substantially<br>
large storage capacities are used unchanged. Not least, as a<br>
result of this, a very cost-effective arrangement for the<br>
safe monitoring and evaluation of operating states of at<br>
least one traffic control system can be obtained at the same<br>
time, because its immunity and system stability is maintained<br>
without restriction even in the event of any adaptation of<br>
the hardware or software or possible reduction in the storage<br>
capacities. In other respects, the aforementioned advantages<br>
of the method according to the invention can be obtained in a<br>
similar manner by the inventive arrangement.<br>
Quite particular advantageous design details of the inventive<br>
arrangement for the safe monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states of at least one traffic control system are<br>
described in Claims 28 to 48.<br>
Finally, the scope of the invention according to Claim 4 9<br>
enables a method or an arrangement according to the invention<br>
to be used for the remote operation and/or remote control of<br>
at least one electronic railway control centre for rail-borne<br>
traffic, especially for rail and railway traffic, especially<br>
for railways, rubber-tyred metro systems, monorail systems or<br>
overhead systems, more especially, for example, on regional<br>
lines, by means of a safe operator station at a central<br>
location.<br>

In the following description of various embodiments of the<br>
arrangement 10 according to the invention, similar components<br>
that correspond to each other are each provided with<br>
identical reference numbers.<br>
The inventive method and/or the arrangement 10 according to<br>
the invention is/are provided for the safe monitoring and<br>
evaluation of operating states of at least one traffic<br>
control system 12, 12', 12", 12"', especially of at least<br>
one control device 14, 14', 14' , 14'', for example in the<br>
form of a railway control centre computer, of an electronic<br>
railway control centre 16, 16', 16', 16'' for rail-borne<br>
traffic, especially for rail and railway traffic, especially<br>
railways, rubber-tyred metro systems, monorail systems or<br>
overhead systems.<br>
In a very advantageous manner, the inventive method and the<br>
arrangement 10 according to the invention serve for the<br>
remote operation and/or remote control of at least one<br>
electronic railway control centre 16, 16', 16', 16'' for<br>
rail-borne traffic, with regional lines being particularly<br>
preferred, by means of a safe operator station 18 for the<br>
operating or control personnel, for example a traffic<br>
superintendent, at a central location or in the control<br>
centre. In this case, the term "remote operation" means<br>
control over a shorter range and/or locally. The term "remote<br>
control",, on the other hand, means control over a longer<br>
range and/or from a different location.<br>
The embodiment of the inventive arrangement 10 shown in Fig.<br>
1 is designed for the safe monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states of the traffic control system 12 or of the<br>
control device 14 of the electronic railway control centre<br>
16. The arrangement 10 and the traffic control system 12 or<br>
the control device 14 of the electronic railway control<br><br>
centre 16 communicate with each other, as explained in more<br>
detail in the following, by means of two independent channels<br>
20, 20'. Communication is carried out via an Ethernet in each<br>
case for each independent channel. Closed networks<br>
corresponding to EN50159-1 are preferably used for this<br>
purpose. Because such networks allow the implementing of<br>
several communication partners, it is possible without<br>
difficulty to expand the arrangement 10 according to the<br>
invention for the secure monitoring and evaluation of<br>
operating states from just one traffic control system 12, as<br>
shown in Fig. 1, to a plurality thereof.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of an embodiment of the inventive<br>
arrangement 10, which serves for the safe monitoring and<br>
evaluation of operating states of a total of four traffic<br>
control systems 12, 12', 12', 12'', i.e., accordingly of<br>
four control devices 14, 14', 14', 14 '' of the electronic<br>
railway control centres 16, 16', 16', 16''.<br>
According to Figs. 1 and 2, the operator station 18, for<br>
example, consists of a mouse 22, a keyboard 24, a<br>
mouse/keyboard converter 25, at least one to preferably four<br>
screens 26, 26', 26', 26'', monitors or similar data<br>
viewing devices, such as, for example, CRT (Cathode Ray<br>
Tube), TFT (Thin Film Transistor) screens or also a beamer,<br>
etc., for process visualization, and a printer 28.<br>
Data and/or information that varies according to its safety<br>
relevance is displayed, for monitoring and evaluation, on the<br>
screens 26, 26', 26', 26''. For the display of safety-<br>
relevant contents, the screen 26 is designed as an CRT<br>
(Cathode Ray Tube) screen. The screen 26 is thus able to meet<br>
technical signaling requirements. In contrast, the screens<br>
26', 26', 26'' can be designed as TFT (Thin Film<br>
Transistor) screens for the display of content which has<br>
little or no safety relevance. Any disadvantageous effects of<br>
specific storage device defects, such as can occur with TFT<br><br>
screens, are precluded by the use of the screen 26 for the<br>
display of safety-relevant contents.<br>
For example, in the case of remote operation and/or remote<br>
control of the at least one electronic railway control centre<br>
16, 16', 16', 16'' for rail-borne traffic, a line image can<br>
be schematically displayed on the screen 26, also called a<br>
magnifier, likewise line images can be schematically<br>
displayed on the screens 26', 26', also called area<br>
overviews, and operator actions, fault messages, etc. can be<br>
schematically displayed on the screen 26'', also called a<br>
communication display.<br>
Without explaining in more detail, a further mouse 22', a<br>
further keyboard 24' and one or more further screen(s) 26''<br>
can be provided as a fallback level.<br>
As can furthermore be seen in Fig. 2, the implementing of an<br>
optional local operator station 18' is also conceivable, for<br>
example in the form of a personal computer or notebook. The<br>
operator station 18', shown as an example in Fig. 2, is<br>
assigned to the control device 14' of the railway control<br>
centre 16'. The operator station 18' is activated in place<br>
of the central operator station 18 only if required, i.e.,<br>
for example, in the event of failure of the communication<br>
link with the control device 14, 14', 14' , 14'' or a<br>
serious fault at the central operator station 18. A collision<br>
between the two operator stations 18, 18' is safely avoided<br>
in that, as a fundamental principle, only one of the two<br>
operator stations 18, 18' can be connected at any one time.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a detailed representation of an embodiment of<br>
such an arrangement 10 according to the invention for the<br>
safe monitoring and evaluation of operating states of at<br>
least one traffic control system 12, 12', 12', 12''.<br>
The arrangement 10 according to the invention comprises two<br><br>
separate, i.e., separated from each other, data processing<br>
devices 30, 30' that operate independently and parallel with<br>
each other. The two data processing devices 30, 30' are<br>
(essentially) of identical design. Furthermore, the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30' have the same system components<br>
that are largely of the same configuration. However, certain<br>
differences in the configuration of the system components are<br>
- if desirable or advantageous - completely possible and<br>
permissible. Although the two data processing devices 30, 30'<br>
operate largely asynchronously, they are operated virtually<br>
synchronously in that the instructions of the operating<br>
personnel, input by the mouse 22 and keyboard 24, are<br>
doubled, interference-free, beforehand. One of the essential<br>
objects of the two data processing devices 30, 30' is to<br>
generate (message) images on the screens 26, 26', 26', 26''<br>
and, as shown in Fig. 5, to process, in the reverse<br>
direction, the instructions of the operating personnel, input<br>
by the mouse 22 and keyboard 24, for the control devices 14,<br>
14', 14 ' , 14''.<br>
According to Fig. 3, four screens 26, 26', 26', 26'' are<br>
therefore equally assigned to each of the two data processing<br>
devices 30, 30'. The screens 26, 26', 26", 26'' of the data<br>
processing device 30 are in this case in operation. The<br>
control of the screens 26, 26', 26', 26'' of the data<br>
processing device 30' is in contrast provided as a fallback<br>
level and is not brought into operation until a fault or<br>
failure of one or more control (s) of the screens 26, 26',<br>
26', 26'' of the data processing device 30 occur (s).<br>
The data processing devices 30, 30' each have a device 32,<br>
32' for receiving and processing obtained data and/or<br>
information on an operating state of the at least one control<br>
device 14, 14', 14', 14'' . The data and/or information is<br>
to be visualized by the data processing device 30 or 30',<br>
i.e., in the case of the embodiment of the data processing<br>
device 30 shown in Fig.  3,  on the respective connected,<br><br>
associated screens 26, 26', 26', 26'', 26'', especially<br>
on screen 26.<br>
Furthermore, the data processing devices 30, 30' each have a<br>
device 33, 33' for visualizing or displaying data and/or<br>
information on the operating state of the at least one<br>
control device 14, 14', 14', 14'', which has been<br>
previously obtained and processed by the device 32, 32', on<br>
the screen 26, 26', 26', 26'', 26'' or similar. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment of the arrangement. 10 according to the<br>
invention shown in Figs. 1 to 3 and 5, the devices 33, 33'<br>
are each designed as a VGA (Video Graphics Array) graphics<br>
card. The devices 33, 33' are each connected to a storage<br>
device 34, 34' in which the previously obtained and processed<br>
data and/or information for visualization is stored, and to<br>
the screen(s) 26, 26', 26', 26'', 26'' via corresponding<br>
interfaces and lines 35, 35'.<br>
Furthermore, the data processing devices 30, 30' are each<br>
provided with a device 36, 36' for the pixel-accurate<br>
generation of a DVI video signal. The devices 36, 36' for the<br>
pixel-accurate generation of the DVI video signal are in this<br>
case each designed as a DVI graphics card, which is also<br>
connected to the storage device 34, 34'.<br>
The storage device 34, 34' can, for example, be an image<br>
storage device of an (analogue or digital) graphics card or<br>
an external image storage device (not illustrated). Without<br>
being shown in detail, the storage device 34, 34' can<br>
accordingly also of course be a component of the device 33,<br>
33' for the visualization or display of data and/or<br>
information and/or of the device 36, 36' for the pixel-<br>
accurate generation of a DVI video signal itself.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement 10 according to the invention<br>
comprises a video signal comparison device 38 for comparing<br>
with each other and evaluating the two DVI video signals. The<br><br>
video signal comparison device 38 is embodied as a separate<br>
personal computer.<br>
The video comparison device 38 is connected to the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30'. In this case, the video<br>
comparison device 38 and the device 36, 36' for the pixel-<br>
accurate generation of the DVI video signal or the DVI<br>
graphics card are preferably connected, directly in each<br>
case, via suitable interfaces and lines 40, 40'.<br>
The video signal comparison device 38 is additionally<br>
provided for generating or suppressing a pulse or signal in<br>
response to the evaluation of the comparison between the two<br>
DVI video signals. The video signal comparison device 38 then<br>
forwards this pulse or signal, if not already suppressed, to<br>
the two data processing devices 30, 30', in order to continue<br>
to operate and/or control the at least one control device 14,<br>
14', 14' , 14'' or in order to block the further operation<br>
and/or control of the at least one control device 14, 14',<br>
14' , 14''. The positive result of the comparison of a<br>
matching DVI video signal can cumulatively or alternatively<br>
be displayed at the same time on the screen 26 and/or on one<br>
of the further screens 26', 26', 26'", 26''.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 3, the two data processing devices 30,<br>
30' communicate with each other and/or furthermore also with<br>
the video comparison device 38 via an Ethernet 42, especially<br>
an Ethernet/LAN (Local Area Network) connection.<br>
The device 32, 32' for receiving and processing the obtained<br>
data and/or information on the operating state of the at<br>
least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' preferably<br>
comprises an input buffer (not shown in detail). An appended<br>
time stamp verifies the updatedness of the respective<br>
sequence number.<br>
The device 32, 32' which, amongst other things, is provided<br><br>
for the verification of the sequence number of the protocols<br>
of the data and/or information on one hand comprises a device<br>
44, 44' for checking the logical progression of the sequence<br>
number in a first test step (A).<br>
On the other hand, the device 32, 32' comprises a device 4 6,<br>
46' for comparing the sequence number, and therefore the<br>
matching of the data and/or information between the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30', in a first test step (B).<br>
Without being shown in detail, the device 32, 32' for<br>
receiving and processing the obtained data and/or information<br>
on the operating state of the at least one control device 14,<br>
14', 14' , 14'' is furthermore assigned a device which<br>
monitors said device in a specified cycle.<br>
In order to enable parallel operation of the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30', the two data processing devices<br>
30, 30' are therefore cyclically synchronized, functionally<br>
and logically, via the Ethernet 42. By means of the<br>
synchronization is achieved that instructions are transmitted<br>
synchronously on two channels from and to the control devices<br>
14, 14', 14', 14'' and the two DVT video signals are<br>
synchronously generated in the opposite direction. A<br>
comparison of the protocols with a minimum propagation time<br>
difference is thus ensured.<br>
The mouse/keyboard converter 25 mentioned in the introduction<br>
is provided to enable the interference-free doubling of<br>
instructions of the operating personnel input by mouse 22,<br>
22' and keyboard 24, 24' for processing for the two-channel<br>
system. With respect to the signal doubling, it should be<br>
noted that two data processing devices 30, 30' or computer<br>
systems running asynchronously can be operated virtually<br>
synchronously via one operator interface.<br>
(USB (Universal Serial Bus)) signals from the mouse 22, 22'<br><br>
and keyboard 24, 24' are forwarded to the mouse/keyboard<br>
converter 25. The mouse/keyboard converter 25 makes the (USB)<br>
signals available at two (USB) interfaces for the data<br>
processing devices 30, 30'. The doubling of the operator<br>
inputs achieves a decoupling of the different computer<br>
operating cycles at the same time. But this also means that<br>
the mouse/keyboard converter 25 has its own processor which<br>
receives and processes the (USB) signals.<br>
A further task of the mouse/keyboard converter 25 is the<br>
conversion of the relative inputs of the (USB) mouse 22, 22'<br>
into absolute values for the mouse position. In this way, the<br>
data processing devices 30, 30' are supplied with identical<br>
absolute values for the respective mouse position, so that<br>
the video signal comparison device 38 cannot respond due to<br>
different positions of the mouse 22, 22'.<br>
In order, at the start of the arrangement 10 or during a run-<br>
up of the data processing devices 30, 30', not to stop at the<br>
operating system request of a disconnected mouse 22, 22'<br>
and/or keyboard 24, 24', the outputs of the mouse/keyboard<br>
converter 25 are connected in such a way that, if a<br>
mouse/keyboard converter 25 is not active, they reflect the<br>
galvanic values of a mouse 22, 22' and keyboard 24, 24'. If<br>
the mouse/keyboard converter 25 is active, the equivalent<br>
values are replaced by the true values.<br>
With the embodiment of the inventive arrangement 10 shown in<br>
Fig. 3, the two data processing devices 30, 30' are<br>
furthermore each provided with a process database 48, 48' or<br>
similar. The process database 48, 48' is used to accept or to<br>
pick up and store processed data and/or information on the<br>
operating state of the at least one control device 14, 14',<br>
14', 14'' on one hand and to accept or to pick up and store<br>
data and/or information on a topology of the traffic control<br>
system 12, 12', 12', 12'' or a part thereof on the other<br>
hand. For example, the topology of railway stations along a<br><br>
rail-borne  traffic route  such as especially a  track or<br>
railway line, for example a regional line, with line images<br>
showing .symbols for points,  signals and all other track<br>
system elements can be stored. The process database 48, 48'<br>
is connected to the storage device 34, 34' in order to enable<br>
a continuous verification between the data and/or information<br>
in the process database 48, 48' and in the storage device 34,<br>
34'. The data and/or information of the process database 48,<br>
48' is held in video signal formats and can thus be directly<br>
used to generate the video signal. This also enables a fast<br>
switching between the screens 26, 26', 26' ', 26'' and thus<br>
between the operating states of various control devices 14,<br>
14', 14', 14'', without a time lag.<br>
The video signal comparison device 38, which, as shown in<br>
Fig. 3, serves to perform a second test step, is in this<br>
embodiment of the inventive arrangement 10 provided with a<br>
device 50 for synchronizing the two data processing devices<br>
30, 30' with each other. Here, the device 50 has an element<br>
for specifying the timing of the screen refresh frequency<br>
(not illustrated) and an element for cyclically requesting<br>
the two data processing devices 30, 30' to visualize the<br>
current data and/or information (also not illustrated).<br>
Despite the preceding synchronization of the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30' with each other, an asynchronicity<br>
of the two DVI video signals is, as before, to be assumed. In<br>
addition, the video signal comparison device 38 therefore has<br>
a device 52 for synchronizing the two DVI video signals<br>
themselves, whose function and operation is schematically<br>
explained in Fig. 4.<br>
The device 52 for synchronizing the two DVI video signals<br>
comprises a buffer (not shown in detail), especially a<br>
circular buffer. The buffer or circular buffer, respectively,<br>
in this case has a storage capacity sufficient for at least<br>
one DVI video signal, and preferably for three DVI video<br><br>
signals.<br>
Furthermore, the device 52 for synchronization of the two DVI<br>
video signals is provided with a device for marking the two<br>
DVI video signals at a corresponding point within the<br>
respective DVI video signal (also not illustrated). This<br>
device comprises an element for generating two triggers to be<br>
applied to the two DVI video signals.<br>
As will be described in more detail, with reference to Fig.<br>
4, in conjunction with the description of the inventive<br>
method, the device 52 for synchronizing the two DVI video<br>
signals also has an element for shifting the two DVI video<br>
signals to and against each other and an element for bringing<br>
the identifiers of the two DVI video signals into coincidence<br>
with each other at a corresponding point (not shown in<br>
detail).<br>
In addition to a device for comparing with each other and<br>
evaluating the two DVI video signals (also not shown in<br>
detail), the video signal comparison device 38 also has a<br>
device 54 for generating or suppressing a pulse or signal in<br>
response to the evaluation of the comparison between the two<br>
DVI video signals.<br>
An update reporting device (not illustrated) is assigned to<br>
the two data processing devices 30, 30', in order to notify<br>
the operating personnel of a blockage of the data and/or<br>
information regarding the operating state of the at least one<br>
control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' and/or a barring of the<br>
further operation and/or control of the at least one control<br>
device 14, 14', 14', 14''. The blocking or barring can be<br>
notified to the operating personnel, for example, by means of<br>
images or corresponding (acoustic and/or visual) warning<br>
signs on one of the further two screens 26', 26'.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a device 56 for redundant switching is<br><br>
assigned to the two data processing devices 30, 30', with the<br>
device 56 being connected to the two data processing devices<br>
30, 30' and controllable by means of which at least one<br>
screen 26, 26', 26', 26'' can be addressed in each case.<br>
Although the two data processing devices 30, 30' generate<br>
corresponding parallel images, which can be visualized on the<br>
screens 26, 26', 26', 26'', the display on the screens 26,<br>
26', 26', 26'' is supplied from only one of the two data<br>
processing devices 30 or 30'. By means of the device 56 for<br>
redundant switching, which in this embodiment, for example,<br>
operates on a mechanical basis, switching to the particular<br>
passive screens 26, 26', 26', 26'' comprising of the<br>
printer 28 is possible.<br>
With a multi-area structure, i.e., if several control devices<br>
14, 14', 14', 14'' are connected together, as shown<br>
schematically in Figs. 2 and 6, an Ethernet switching device<br>
58, 58' is preferably connected between them in a star point<br>
configuration in order to avoid a collision between data<br>
and/or information that originates from at least one further<br>
control device 14, 14', 14' , 14'' and is transmitted<br>
simultaneously. The star point is formed in each case by the<br>
Ethernet circuit device 58, 58' arranged between each of the<br>
control devices 14, 14', 14', 14'' on one hand and the<br>
operator station 18 on the other hand in the two independent<br>
channels 20, 20', thus providing an own port. Collision-free<br>
operation of point-to-point connections is thus ensured.<br>
Precluding a collision between data and/or information<br>
enables a full duplex operation to be achieved during the<br>
transmission of useful data.<br>
With control devices 14, 14', 14 ' , 14'' which are<br>
geographically farer apart, for example, more than 15 km, at<br>
least one repeater device 60, 60' or a so-called repeater,<br>
respectively, is connected between the two independent<br>
channels 20, 20'. Such repeater devices 60, 60' are shown,<br>
for instance, in Fig. 7. The acquired data and/or information<br><br>
on the operating state can thus be repeated and forwarded.<br>
If the geographical distance is greater, an additional<br>
processing of the data and/or information is advantageous,<br>
perhaps even necessary. Whereas a repeater device 60, 60'<br>
merely undertakes a hardware-type amplification of the<br>
respective signals and therefore amplifies the dispersions of<br>
the signals, a demodulation followed by modulation takes<br>
place during the processing of the signals. All dispersions<br>
of the amplified signals can thus be eliminated. Such<br>
processing of the signals subject to dispersion is carried<br>
out by means of a processing device of a secure computer.<br>
The method according to the invention is explained in detail<br>
using the inventive arrangement 10 shown in Figs. 1 to 7, as<br>
follows:<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, data and/or information of an<br>
operatincj state of the at least one traffic control system<br>
12, 12', 12', 12'' or of the at least one control device<br>
14, 14', 14', 14'' of an electronic railway control centre<br>
16, 16', 16', 16'' for rail-borne traffic is first acquired<br>
by the control device 14, 14', 14', 14''.<br>
The acquired data and/or information on the operating state<br>
is then transmitted simultaneously from the control device<br>
14, 14', 14', 14'' via the two independent channels 20, 20'<br>
by means of optical fibre conductors, especially monomode<br>
glass fibres, if necessary via the at least one repeater<br>
device 60, 60' or the at least one so-called repeater,<br>
respectively, and/or via the at least one processing device<br>
to the two data processing devices 30, 30' communicating with<br>
each other. Communication between the control device 14, 14',<br>
14', 14'' and the two data processing devices 30, 30' takes<br>
place in each case via an Ethernet 20, 20'.<br>
The acquired data and/or information on the operating state<br><br>
of the at least one control device 14, 14', 14' , 14'' is<br>
obtained and processed by the two data processing devices 30,<br>
30' for its visualization on a screen 26, 26', 26', 26'' or<br>
similar monitor. This takes place by means of the device 32,<br>
32' for receiving and processing data and/or information.<br>
To process the obtained data and/or information on the<br>
operating state of the at least one control device 14, 14',<br>
14', 14'' by the two data processing devices 30, 30', a<br>
verification of a sequence number of the protocols of the<br>
data and/or information is carried out. The device 32, 32',<br>
which, for example, can be formed as an input buffer, is<br>
provided for this purpose. The function of the device 32, 32'<br>
or of the input buffer is, among other things, to smooth the<br>
asynchronicity of the data and/or information so that only<br>
matching data and/or information on the operating state or<br>
state data is accepted in the process database 48, 48'. For<br>
this purpose, the data and/or information is stored in the<br>
device 32, 32'.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, during the verification of the<br>
sequence number of the protocols of the data and/or<br>
information, their logical progression is checked in a first<br>
test step (A) by the device 44, 44'. In a second test step<br>
(B) , the sequence number between the two data processing<br>
devices 30, 30' is then checked by the device 46, 46', which<br>
is arranged downstream of the device 44, 44'.<br>
If on one hand the logical progression of the sequence number<br>
is shown to be logical by the device 44, 44' and on the other<br>
hand matching of the sequence number between the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30' is determined by the device 4 6,<br>
46', the matching data and/or information on the operating<br>
state of the at least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14''<br>
is marked with a release mark and returned to the respective<br>
adjacent data processing device 30 or 30'. The data and/or<br>
information marked with the release mark is then shifted into<br><br>
the process database 48, 48' by the device 32, 32' or the<br>
input buffer.<br>
Simultaneously, data and/or information on a topology of the<br>
traffic control system 12, 12', 12', 12'', or part thereof,<br>
is stored together in the process database 48, 48'.<br>
From the data and/or information on the operating state of<br>
the at least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' stored<br>
in the process database 48, 48' and the data and/or<br>
information on the topology of the traffic control system 12,<br>
12', 12', 12'', or part thereof, video signals or a<br>
(message) image to be visualized is/are then generated and<br>
forwarded to the storage device 34, 34', for example, to the<br>
image storage device of a graphics card or also to an<br>
external image storage device (not illustrated). The device<br>
33,	33' for visualizing or displaying data and/or information<br>
in turn accesses the storage device 34,  34'  in order to<br>
forward the video signals or the (message)  image via the<br>
relevant interfaces and lines 35, 35' to the screen 26, 26',<br>
26', 26'' for their display.<br>
Parallel to this, the respective DVI video signal is<br>
generated by the two data processing devices 30, 30' from the<br>
data and/or information on the operating state of the at<br>
least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' which has been<br>
suitably processed and then entered in the process database<br>
48, 48' and from the data and/or information which reflects<br>
the topology of the traffic control system 12, 12', 12',<br>
12'', or part thereof, and is entered in the process<br>
database 48, 48'. The two DVI video signals are generated by<br>
the device 36, 36', which, for example, is designed as a DVI<br>
graphics card. The device 36, 36' accesses the storage device<br>
34,	34' equally for this purpose.<br>
In other words, the visualization and display of the data<br>
and/or information on the screen 26, 26', 26', 26'' takes<br><br>
place at the same time but separately, online and parallel to<br>
the comparison of the data and/or information, on the basis<br>
of the two DVI video signals provided or generated by the two<br>
data processing devices 30, 30'. Separate from each other in<br>
this respect merely means that it is absolutely possible to<br>
display the data and/or information on the screen 26, 26',<br>
26' , 26'' by means of video signals in accordance with a<br>
standard which differs from the DVI standard, for example,<br>
according to the VGA standard.<br>
To the contrary, the data and/or information on the operating<br>
state of the at least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14''<br>
is blocked, provided it has been determined by the device 44,<br>
44' that the logical progression of the sequence number is<br>
missing and/or if the device 46, 46' has detected that there<br>
is no matching of the sequence number between the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30'.<br>
Before such a blocking, the data and/or information on the<br>
operating state of the at least one control device 14, 14',<br>
14', 14'' is, as a precaution, subject to another<br>
verification. In doing so, the data and/or information that<br>
remains in the device 32, 32' for receiving and processing<br>
the data and/or information or in the input buffer is<br>
provided with timestamps and checked obsolescence. After 500<br>
ms, the data and/or information on the operating state is<br>
transmitted at least one more time from the at least one<br>
control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' to the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30'.<br>
In the case of a renewed verification leading to the same<br>
result and blocking of the data and/or information on the<br>
operating state of the at least one control device 14, 14',<br>
14', 14'' taking place, the blocking is notified at the<br>
same time via an update reporting device. The blocking may be<br>
displayed to the operating personnel by means of images or<br>
corresponding (acoustic and/or visual) warning signs on one<br><br>
of the further two screens 26', 26'.<br>
The verification of the sequence number of the protocols of<br>
the data and/or information is preferably carried out in a<br>
specified cycle. A monitoring device or watchdog is provided<br>
for this purpose. For example, the verification can take<br>
place in a poling cycle of 50 ms. The data and/or information<br>
on the operating state is then requested by the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30', in a 50 ms cycle, from the at<br>
least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' and transmitted<br>
to said control device.<br>
The pixel-accurate generated DVI video signal of each of the<br>
two data processing devices 30, 30' is then applied via the<br>
lines 40, 40' of the two data processing devices 30, 30' to<br>
the corresponding interface of the video signal comparison<br>
device 38. The two DVI video signals are compared with each<br>
other and evaluated, as follows, by the video signal<br>
comparison device 38.<br>
For the comparison of the two DVI video signals by the video<br>
signal comparison device 38, the two data processing devices<br>
30, 30' are first synchronized with each other by the device<br>
50 of the video signal comparison device 38. In doing so, the<br>
timing of the screen refresh frequency is predetermined and<br>
the two data processing devices 30, 30' are cyclically<br>
requested to visualize the current data and/or information.<br>
Both processes take place through the video signal comparison<br>
device 38 itself.<br>
According to Fig. 4, a synchronization of the two DVI video<br>
signals, which is performed by the device 52 of the video<br>
signal comparison device 38, is furthermore carried out to<br>
compare the two DVI video signals with each other. The two<br>
DVI video signals are entered in a buffer, especially a ring<br>
buffer, of the video signal comparison device 38, for this<br>
purpose.<br><br>
By means of the device 52, the two DVI video signals are then<br>
provided with an identifier or identification, respectively,<br>
at a corresponding point within the respective DVI video<br>
signal. Each DVI video signal, which describes one pixel of<br>
an image, consists of a 2-bit control code, 6-bit check code<br>
and 24-bit colour code. For their identification, the two DVI<br>
video signals are provided with two triggers at a point<br>
corresponding to each other. The two triggers are applied<br>
specifically to the clock signals of the two control codes of<br>
the two DVI video signals to mark the start or end of an<br>
image.<br>
Following this, the two DVI video signals are shifted in a<br>
first direction, for example, to the right, towards each<br>
other or against each other, until the identifiers of the two<br>
DVI video signals coincide at a point corresponding to each<br>
other.<br>
If agreement between the two DVI video signals compared with<br>
each other is found during the comparison or check, a pulse<br>
or signal, for example, for release is generated by the video<br>
signal comparison device 38 and is sent to the two data<br>
processing devices 30, 30'. A pulse or signal of this kind<br>
therefore represents a virtual confirmation. The display on<br>
the screen 26 of the data and/or information provided by<br>
means of the device 33, 33' is retained. A continuing<br>
unhindered operation and/or control of the at least one<br>
control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' by the operating<br>
personnel is therefore possible.<br>
If, however, a deviation is found between the two DVI video<br>
signals compared with each other, the two DVI video signals<br>
are shifted in a second direction, opposite to the first<br>
direction, for example, to the left, towards or against each<br>
other, until again the identifiers of the two DVI video<br>
signals coincide at a point corresponding to each other.<br><br>
If also in this case a deviation is found between the two DVI<br>
video signals compared with each other, a pulse or a signal<br>
for blocking the further operation and/or control of the at<br>
least one control device is set by the video signal<br>
comparison device 38.<br>
As an alternative to this, it is equally conceivable that the<br>
video signal comparison device 38 does not set a pulse or<br>
signal for blocking, but instead merely suppresses the pulse<br>
or signal that has been sent to enable, and thus confirm, the<br>
existing display of the data and/or information on the screen<br>
26.<br>
Such a blocking of the further operation and/or control of<br>
the at least one control device 14, 14', 14', 14'' can<br>
ultimately be notified to the operating personnel by means of<br>
an update reporting device. The blocking can be presented to<br>
the operating personnel, for example, by means of images or<br>
corresponding (acoustic and/or visual) warning signs on one<br>
of the further two screens 26', 26'.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the presented<br>
embodiment of the arrangement 10. For instance, it is<br>
conceivable that the storage device 34, 34', which in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown is configured as an image storage<br>
device of a graphics card or can also be embodied by an<br>
external storage device or image storage device (not<br>
illustrated), be replaced by the process database 48, 48'.<br>
The process database 48, 48' would in this respect take over<br>
the function of the storage device 34, 34', which at the same<br>
time would bring about a further simplification of the<br>
construction of the arrangement 10. Furthermore, it is<br>
possible, without complications, to configure the devices 33,<br>
33' in any other graphics format - i.e., analogue or digital.<br>
In this respect, a DVI graphics card or also an HDTV (High<br>
Definition Television) graphics card could equally be used,<br><br>
for example, instead of the VGA graphics card, such as is<br>
shown in the example of an embodiment of the arrangement 10<br>
in Figs. 1 to 3 and 5. Particularly where a DVI graphics card<br>
is used as device 33, 33' for visualizing the data and/or<br>
information, the overall construction of the arrangement 10<br>
could be further simplified. With such a constructive<br>
arrangement, it would be possible to do away with a separate<br>
device 36, 36' for pixel-accurate generating of a DVI video<br>
 signal. Its function would in any case also be taken over by<br>
the device 33, 33'.<br><br>
