WO 2007/078607<br><br>
PCT/US2006/046944<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5<br>
Olefin oligomers and relatively long chain olefins can be used in the production of fuel and lubricant components or blendstocks. One problem with the use of olefin oligomers in either of the above uses is that the olefinic double bond can be undesirable. Oiefinic double bonds cause problems in both fuels 10     and in lubricants. Olefin oligomers can further oligomerize forming 'gum deposits in the fuel. Olefins in fuel are also.associated with air quality problems. Olefins can also oxidize which can be a particular problem in lubricants.- One way of minimizing the problem is to hydrogenate some or all of the double bonds to form saturated hydrocarbons. A method of doing this is 15     described in US published Application US 2001/0001804 which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Hydrogenation can be an effective way to minimize the concentration of olefins in the lubricant or fuel however it requires the presence of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst both of which can be expensive. Also excessive hydrogenation can lead to hydrocracking.  Hydrocracking can 20     increase as one attempts to hydrogenate the olefins to Increasingly lower<br>
concentrations. Hydrocracking is generally undesirable as it produces a lower . molecular weight material where the goal in oligomerization is to produce a ■   higher molecular weight material. Directionally it would generally be preferred to increase, not decrease the average molecular weight of the' material. Thus 25      using the hydrogenation method it is desired to hydrogenate the olefins as deeply as possible while minimizing any hydrocracking or hydrodealkylation. This is inherently difficult and tends to be a compromise;<br>
Hydrocracking of a slightly branched, hydrocarbon material can also lead to less branching. Cracking tend" to be favored at the tertiary and secondary 30     centers. For example a branched hydrocarbon can crack at a secondary center forming two more linear molecules which is also directionally undesirable.<br>

WO 2007/07860-/<br><br>
potentially, Ionic Liquid catalyst systems can be used for the oligomerization of olefins such as normal alpha olefins to make olefin oligomers- A Patent that describes the use of an ionic liquid catalyst to make<br>
5     Its entirety- A published application that discloses a process for oiigomerization of alpha olefins in ionic liquids is EP 791,643.<br>
tonic Liquid catalyst systems have also been used for isoparaffins — olefins alkylation reactions. Patents that disclose a process for the alkylation of isoparaffins by olefins are US 5,750,455 and US 6,028,024.<br>
10	It would be desirable to have a process for making a lubricant or<br>
distillate fuel starting materials with low degree of unsaturation (low concentration of doubte bonds) and thus reducing the need for exhaustive hydrogenation while preferably maintaining or more preferably increasing the average molecular weight and branching of the material. The present invention<br>
15     provides a new process with just such desired features.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
the present invention provides a process for making a fuel or lubricant<br>
component by the oiigomerization of olefins to make olefin oligomers of. desired<br>
20      chain length range followed by alkylation of the olefin oligomer with an.,<br>
isoparaffin t° "cap" at least a portion of the double bonds of the olefin.<br>
oligomers	..<br>
A particular embodiment of the present invention provides a process for making<br>
a fuel, or lubricant component, comprising:<br>
25	passing a feed stream comprising one or more olefins to an ionic liquid<br>
oiigomerization zone, at oiigomerization conditions; recovering an oiigomerized olefinic intermediate from said tonic liquid oiigomerization zone;<br>
passing the oligpmerized olefinic intermediate and an isoparaffin to a<br>
30	ionic liquid alkylation zone comprising an acidic chloroaluminate ionic<br>
liquid, at alkylation conditions; and<br>
recovering an effluent from the ionic liquid alkylation zone 'comprising an alkylated oligomeric product.<br>

PCT/US2006/046944<br><br>
Oligornerization of two or more olefin molecules results in the formation<br>
of an olefin oligomer that generally comprises a long branched chain molecule<br>
with one remaining double bond. The present invention provides a novel way<br>
to reduce the concentration of double bonds and at the same time enhance the<br>
5     quality of the desired fuel or lubricant. This invention also reduces the amount<br>
of hydrafinishing that Is needed to achieve a desired product with low olefin<br>
concentration. The olefin concentration can be determined by Bromine Index<br>
or Bromine Number. Bromine Number can be determined by test ASTM D<br>
1159. Bromine Index can be determined by ASTM D 2710. Test methods D<br>
10     1159 and ASTM D 2710 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Bromine index is effectively the number of milligrams of Bromine (Br2) that<br>
react with 100 grams of sample under the conditions of the test. Bromine<br>
Number is effectively the number of grams of bromine that will react with 100<br>
grams of specimen under the conditions of the test.<br>
IS	In a preferred embodiment of the present invention HCl or a component<br>
that directly or indirectly works as a proton source is added to the reaction<br>
mixture. Although not wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the<br>
presence of a Bronsted acid such as HCl greatly enhances the activity and<br>
acidity of the Ionic liquid catalyst system.<br>
20	Among other factors, the present invention involves a surprising new<br>
way of making a lubricant base oil or fuel blendstock that has reduced levels of olefins without hydrogenation or with minimal hydrafinishing. The present invention also increases the value of the resultant olefin oligomers by increasing the molecular weight of the oligomer and increasing the branching 25     by incorporation of tsoparaffin groups into the oligomers skeletons. These properties can both add significant value to the product particularly when starting with a highly linear hydrocarbon such as the preferred feeds to the present invention (i.e. Fischer-Tropsch derived hydrocarbons). The present invention is based on the use of an acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquid catalyst 30     to alkylate an oligomerized olefin with an isoparaffin under relatively mild<br>
conditions. Surprisingly, the alkytation optionally can occur under effectively the same conditions as oligomerization. This surprising finding that alkyfatton and oligomerization reactions can occur using effectively the same ionic liquid<br>

catalyst system and optionally under similar or even the same conditions can ■    be used to make a highly Integrated, synergistic process resulting in an alkylated oligomer product having desirable properties.<br>
A preferred catalyst system of the present invention is an acidic 5     chlonoaluminate ionic liquid system. More preferably the acidic chloroaluminate Ionic liquid system is used In the presence of a Bronsted acid. Preferably the Bronsted acid is a halohalide and most preferably is HC1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 10<br>
The present invention provides a novel process for the production of fuel or lubricant components by the acid catalyzed oligomerization of olefins and alkylation of the resulting oligomers with isoparaffins in an ionic liquid medium to form a product having greatly reduced olefin content and improved quality. 15     Amazingly, we found that ofigomerization of an olefin and alkylation of an olefin and/or Its oligomers with an isoparaffin can be performed together in a single reaction zone or alternatively in two separate zones.  The alkylated or partially alkylated oligomer stream that results has very desirable properties for use as a fuel or lubricant blendstock. In particular the present invention provides a   ' 20     process for making a distillate fuel, lubricant, distillate fuel component, lubricant component, or solvent having improved properties such as increased branched, higher molecular weight, and lower Bromine Number.<br>
An advantage of the 2 step process (otigomerization followed by alkylation in a separate zone) over a one step alkylation/oligomerization process is that the 25     two separate reaction zones can be tailored and optimized independently to achieve the desired end products. Thus the conditions for oligomerization zones can be different than the alkylation zone conditions. Also the ionic liquid catalyst can be different in the different zones. For instance it may be preferable to make the alkylation zone more acidic than the oligomerization 30     zone this may involve the use of an entirely different ionic liquid catalyst in the two zones or can be achieved by addition of a Brdnsted acid to the alkylation zone.<br>

lonic Liquids<br>
lonic liquids are a category of compounds which are made up entirely of Eons and are generally liquids-at or below process temperatures. Often salts which are composed entirely of ions are solids with high melting points, for example, above 450 degrees C. These solids are commonly known as "molten salts" when heated to above their melting points. Sodium chloride, for example, is a common "molten salt*, with a melting point of 800 degree C. Ionic liquids differ from "molten salts', in that they have low melting points, for example, from -100 degrees C to 200 degree C. lonic liquids tend to be liquids over a very.wide temperature range, with some having a liquid range of up to 300 degrees C or higher, lonic liquids are generally non-volatile, with effectively no vapor pressure. Many are alr and water stable, and can be good solvents for a wide variety of inorganic, organic, and polymeric materials.<br>
The properties of ionic liquids can be tailored by varying the cation and anion pairing  lonic liquids and some of their commercial applications are described, for example, in J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol, 68:351-356 (1997); J. Phys. Condensed Matter, 5:(supp 34B):B99-B106 (1993); Chemical and Engineering News, Mar. 30,1998, 32-37; J. Mater. Chem., *:2627-2636 (1998); and Chem. Rev., '99:2071-2084 (1999), the contents of which are hereby incorporated fay reference.<br>

PCT/US2006/046944<br><br>
Many ionic liquids are amine-based. Among the most common ionic liquids are those formed by reacting a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (cyclic amines), preferably nitrogen-containing aromatic rings (aromatic amines), with an alkylating agent {for example, an alkyl halide) to form a quaternary 5     ammonium salt, followed by ion exchange or other suitable reactions to introduce the appropriate counter anionic species to form ionic liquids. Examples of suitable heteroaromatic rings include pyridine and its derivatives, imidazole and its derivatives, and pyrrole and Its derivatives. These rings can be alkylated with varying alkylating agents to incorporate a broad range of alkyl 10 .  groups on the nitrogen including straight, branched or cyclic C1-2o alkyl group, but preferably C1-12 alkyl groups since alkyl groups larger than C1-C12 may product undesirable solid products rather than the intended ionic liquids. Pyridinium and imidazolium-based ionic liquids are perhaps the most commonly used ionic liquids. Other amine-based ionic liquids including cyclic 15     and non-cyclic quaternary ammonium salts are frequently used. Phosphonium and sulphonium-based ionic liquids have also been used.<br>
Counter anions which have been used include chloroaluminate, bromoaluminate, gallium chloride, tetrafluoroborate, tetrachloroborate,<br>
20     hexafluorophosphate, nitrate, trifluoromethane sulfonate, methyl sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, hexafiuoroantimonate, hexafluoroarsenate, tetrachloroaluminate, tetrabromoaluminate, perchlorate, hydroxide anion, copper dichlqride anion, Iron trichloride anion, antimony hexafluoride, copper dichloride anion, zinc trichloride anion, as well as various lanthanum,<br>
25     potassium, lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and other metal ions. The ionic liquids used in the present.invention are preferably acidic haloaluminates and preferably chloroaluminates.'<br>
The form of the cation in the ionic liquid in the present invention can be selected . 30     from the group consisting of pyridiniums, and imidazoliums. Cations that have been found to be particularly useful in the process of the present invention include pyridinium-based cations. •<br>

WO 2007/078607<br><br>
PCTYUS200G/046944<br><br>
Preferred ionic liquids that can be used in the process of the present invention include acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquids. Preferred ionic liquids used in the present invention are acidic pyridinium chloroaluminates. More preferred lonic liquids useful in the process of the present invention are alkyV-pyridinium 5     chloroalumi nates. Still more preferred ionic liquids useful in the process of the present invention are alkyl-pyridinium chloroaluminates having a single linear alkyl group of 2 to 6 carbon atoms tn length. One particular ionic liquid that has proven effective is 1-butyl-pyridinlum chloroaluminate. In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention 1-butyl-pyridnium 10     chloroaluminate is used in the presence of a BrOnsted acid. Not to be limited by theory, the BrOnsted acid acts as a promoter or co-catalyst.   Examples of BrOnsted acids are Sulfuric; HCI, HBr, HF, Phosphoric, HI, etc. Other protic acids or species that directly or indirectly aid in supplying protons to the catalyst system may also be used as Bronsted acids or in place of Bronsted acids. 15<br>
The Feeds<br>
In the process of the present invention one of the Important feedstocks comprises a reactive olefinic hydrocarbon. The reactive olefinic group provides the reactive site for the oligomerization reaction as well as the alkylation reaction. 20     The olefinic hydrocarbon can be a fairly pure olefinic hydrocarbon cut or can be a mixture of hydrocarbons having different chain lengths thus a wide boiling range. .   The olefinic hydrocarbon can be terminal olefin (an alpha olefin) or can be internal olefin (internal double bond). The olefinic hydrocarbon chain can be   ■ either straight chain or branched or a mixture of both. The feedstocks useable in 25     the present invention can include unreactive diluents such, as norma! paraffins. In one embodiment of the present invention the olefinic feed comprises a mixture of mostly linear olefins from C2 to about C30- The olefins are mostly but not entirety alpha olefins.<br>
in another embodiment of the present invention the olefinic feed can comprise 30   - at least 50 % of a single alpha olefin species.<br>
(n another embodiment of the present invention the olefinic feed can be comprised of an NAO cut from a high purity Normal Alpha Olefin (NAO) process made by ethylene oligomerization.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/078607<br><br>
PCT/US2006/046944<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention some or all of the olefinic feed to the process of the present invention comprises thermally cracked hydrocarbons, preferably cracked wax, more preferably cracked wax from a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. A process for making olefins by cracking FT products is disclosed 5     in US Patent 6,497,812 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the process of the present invention- another important feedstock is an isoparaffin. The simplest isoparaffin is isobutane. Isopentanes, isohexanes,   ■ Isoheptanes, and other higher isoparaffins are also useable in the process of the present invention. Economics and availability are the main drivers of the 10     isoparaffins selection. Lighter isoparaffins tend to be less expensive and more available due to their low gasoline blend value (due to their relatively high vapor pressure). Mixtures of light isoparaffins can also be used in the present .  invention. Mixtures such as C4-C5 isoparaffins can be used and may be advantaged because of reduced separation costs. The isoparaffins feed stream 15     may also contain diluents such as normal paraffins. This can be a cost savings by reducing the cost of separating isoparaffins from close boiling paraffins. -Normal paraffins will tend to be unreactive diluents in the process of the present invention..<br>
In an optional embodiment of the present Invention the resultant alkylated<br>
20     oligomer made in the present invention can be hydrogenated to further decrease<br>
the concentration of olefins and thus the Bromine Number. After hydrogenation"<br>
the lubricant component or base oil has a Bromine Number of less than 0.8,<br>
preferably less than 0.5, more preferably less than 0.3, still more preferably less<br>
than 0.2. "'.*""<br>
25	In order to achieve a high degree of capping (alkylation) of the product an<br>
excess of isoparaffin Is used. The mole ratio of paraffin to olefin is generally at least 1.1:1, preferably at least 5:1, more preferably at least 8:1, still more preferably at least 10:1. Other techniques can be used to achieve the desired high apparent paraffin to olefin mole ratio; such as use of a multistage process' 30     with interstage addition of reactants. Such techniques known in the art can be used to achieve very high apparent mole ratios of isoparaffin to olefin. This can help to avoid oligomerization of the olefin and achieve a high degree of capping<br>

EXAMPLES Example 1: Preparation of Fresh 1-Butvl-pvridinium Chloroaluminate Ionic Liquid"<br>
1-butyl-pyridinium chloroaluminate is a room temperature ionic liquid prepared 30 .  by mbdng neat 1-butyl-pyridinium chloride (a solid) with neat solid aluminum trichloride in an inert atmosphere. The syntheses of 1-butyl-pyridinium chloride and the corresponding 1-butyl-pyridinium chloroaluminate are described below. In a 2-L Teflon-lined autoclave, 400 gm (5.05 mol.) anhydrous pyridine (99.9%<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2007/078607<br><br>
PCTYUS2006/046944<br><br>
pure purchased from Aldrich) were mixed with 650 gm (7 mol.) 1-chlorobutane (99.5% pure purchased from Aldrich). The neat mixture was sealed and let to stir at 125°C under autogenic pressure over night. After cooling off the autoclave and venting It, the reaction mix was diluted and dissolved in 5     chloroform and transferred to a three liter round bottom flaskl Concentration of the reaction mixture at reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (in a hot water bath) to remove excess chloride, un-reacted pyridine and the chloroform solvent gave a tan solid product. Purification of the product was done by dissolving the obtained solids in hot acetone and precipitating the pure product 10     through cooling and addition of diethyl ether. Filtering and drying under vacuum and heat on a rotary evaporator gave 750 gm (88% yields) of the desired product as an off-white shinny soild. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR were ideal for the desired 1-buty!-pyridinium chloride and no presence of impurities was observed by NMR analysis. 15<br>
1-Butyl-pyridtnium chloroaluminate was prepared by slowly mixing dried 1-butyi-pyridinium chloride and anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCIa) according to the following procedure. The 1-butyI-pyridinium chloride (prepared as described above) was dried under vacuum at 80°C for 48 hours to get rid of 20     residua] water (1-butyi-pyridiniuni chloride is hydroscopic and readily absorbs water from exposure to air). Five hundred grams (2.91 mol.) of the dried 1-butyE-pyridinlum chloride were transferred to a 2-Liter beaker In a nitrogen. atmosphere in a glove box. Then, 777.4 gm (5.83 mol.) of anhydrous powdered A1Cl3 (99.99% from Aldrich) were added in small portions (while 25     stirring) to. control the temperature of the highly exothermic reaction. Once all the AICI3 was added, the resulting amber-looking liquid was left to gently stir overnight in the glove box. The liquid was then filtered to remove any un-dissolved AlCl3. The resulting acidic 1-butyl-pyridinium chloroaluminate was used as the catalyst for the Examples in the Present Application. 30<br>

'olefinic oligomers whether it is simultaneous oligomerization/alkytation or oligomerization followed by alkylation, dearly leads to high quality lubricants or fuel blendstocks.<br>
5 Oiigomerization of olefins followed by alkylation of the oligomeric intermediates with an isoparaffin is an alternative to making high quality lubricants or fuels. Olefin oligomers exhibit good .physical lubricating properties. Also introducing branching in the oligomers by alkylation. with the appropriate isoparaffins enhances the chemical properties, of the final products by reducing the 10 olefinidty of the oligomers and, hence, producing chemically and thermally more stable products.<br>

20 cc autodave fitted to an overhead stirrer, 101 gm of 1-decene and 4.6 gm of isobutane were added and the autoclave was sealed. Then 0.4 gm of HCI was introduced and the stirring started. The reaction was heated.to 50 °C. The reaction was exothermic and the temperature quickly jumped to 88 °C. The temperature En few minutes went back down to 44 °C and was brought up to 50<br>
25 °C and the reaction was vigorously stirred at about 1200 rpm for an hour at the autogenic pressure (-atmospheric pressure in this case). Then, the stirring was stopped and the reaction was cooled to'room temperature. The contents were allowed to settle and the organic layer (immiscible in the Ionic liquid) was decanted off and washed with 0.1 N KOH aqueous solution. The colorless oil 30 was analyzed with simulated distillation and bromine analysis. The Bromine Number- was 2.6. The Bromine Number is much less than that usually observed for the 1-decene.oligomerization in the absence of Isobutane.

The data above suggests that the chemistry can be done by either alkylating the oligomers in situ (where isoparaffins are introduced into the oligomerization reactor) or in a two step process comprised of oligomerization of an olefin 15 followed by alkyiation of the oligomeric intermediates. White both processes yield products that are similar or close in properties, the two step'process may allow more room' for product tailoring by simply tailoring and tuning each reaction independently from the other.<br>

. The data shown in Table 4 dearly indicate that the amount of isobutane added to the reaction does influence the boiling range of the produced oils. As shown<br>
5 in the in Table 4, there are more in - the lower boiling cuts at higher concentration of isobutane in the reaction. This indicates that more alkyiation is taking part in the reaction when more isobutane Is present. When more isobutane is present, 1-decene alkyiation with. lC4 to make C14 and decene dimer   alkyiation   to   make   C24   will   be   more   prevalent   than   at   lower<br>
10     concentrations   of   isobutane.      Therefore,   the   degree   of  branching   and oligomerization   can   be   tailored   by   the   choice   of   olefins,   iso'paraffins, olefinisoparaffin ratios, contact time and the reaction conditions.-The alkylated oligomers will no longer take part in further oligomerization due to "capping" off their olefinlc sites, and the final oligomeric chain will be shorter.<br>
15     perhaps than the normal oligomeric products but with more branching.<br>
While the oligomerization pathway is the dominant mechanism, it is very clear . that alkyiation of 1-decene and tts oligomers with isobutane does take part in •    the chemistry.<br>
