				<td>METHOD FOR DETERMINING CONSTRAINTS ON INPUT TORQUE IN A HYBRID TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,225 filed on 11/03/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure pertains to control systems for hybrid transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
 <br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A hybrid transmission includes torque machines and an energy<br>
storage device connected thereto. Thee hybrid transmission is operative to<br>
transfer power between an input member and an output member and the torque<br>
machines. A method for controlling the hybrid transmission includes<br>
monitoring operating parameters of the hybrid transmission, monitoring an<br>
operator demand for power, determining an output torque range to the output<br>
member based upon states of the operating parameters of the hybrid<br>
transmission, constraining the output torque range to the output member based<br>
upon the operator demand for power, and determining input torque constraints<br>
to the input member based upon the constrained output torque range to the<br>
output member.<br>

disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain. The exemplary hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine<br>
14 and torque machines comprising first and second electric machines ('MG-<br>
A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72 in one embodiment. The engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to<br>
herein as T1, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as N1, NA,<br>
and NB, respectively.<br>
 <br>
[0012] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed N1 and the input torque T1 to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0013] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter<br>
'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75<br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches<br>
C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary<br>
devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of<br>
the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably hydraulically<br>
applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42.<br>
 <br>
[0014] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for<br>
each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0015] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NA and NB, respectively.<br>
 <br>
[0016] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed NO and an output<br>
torque TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed<br>
control module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle<br>
speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction<br>
control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0017] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively)<br>
are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
 <br>
response to the motor torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged.<br>
[0018] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0019] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of<br>
 <br>
the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0020] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
 <br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including<br>
e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, reactive clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1<br>
70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TA and<br>
TB for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is<br>
operatively connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various<br>
functions including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown)<br>
and generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not<br>
shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained<br>
within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque T1 provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
 <br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br>
engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission<br>
input speed N1. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include the reactive<br>
clutch torques for the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and rotational<br>
output speed NO of the output member 64. Other actuators and sensors may be<br>
used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 for<br>
control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches (not<br>
shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not shown) and<br>
shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 to selectively<br>
actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to achieve<br>
various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
 <br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0025] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0026] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM<br>
21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising<br>
a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses. The control algorithms are<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
 <br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs<br>
from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the hybrid powertrain.<br>
Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an<br>
event.<br>
[0027] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>
 <br>
[0028] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
 <br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('MI_Eng_Off'). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off'). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., N1/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('G1') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0029] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the<br>
 <br>
torque generative devices comprising the engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output<br>
member 64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from<br>
the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP<br>
5 determines the operator torque request, a commanded output torque from the<br>
transmission 10 to the driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14, clutch<br>
torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0030] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors<br>
including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range<br>
state is determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state<br>
may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a<br>
command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
 <br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required in response to the desired output torque at output member 64 to meet<br>
the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description<br>
above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore,<br>
the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to<br>
transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member<br>
64.<br>
[0031] Fig. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing signal flow in a hybrid powertrain system having multiple torque<br>
generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned control<br>
modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The control<br>
system architecture is applicable to alternative hybrid powertrain systems<br>
having multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and multiple electric machines. Alternatively, the<br>
hybrid powertrain system can utilize non-electric torque machines and energy<br>
storage systems, e.g., hydraulic-mechanical hybrid transmissions using<br>
hydraulically powered torque machines (not shown).<br>
[0032] In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request.<br>
 <br>
The operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112<br>
comprise individually determinable operator torque request inputs including<br>
an immediate accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request<br>
Accel Immed'), a predicted accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque<br>
Request Accel Prdtd'), an immediate brake output torque request ('Output<br>
Torque Request Brake Immed'), a predicted brake output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd') and an axle torque response type<br>
('Axle Torque Response Type'). As used herein, the term 'accelerator' refers<br>
to an operator request for forward propulsion preferably resulting in increasing<br>
vehicle speed over the present vehicle speed, when the operator selected<br>
position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the<br>
vehicle in the forward direction. The terms 'deceleration' and 'brake' refer to<br>
an operator request preferably resulting in decreasing vehicle speed from the<br>
present vehicle speed. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request, the immediate brake output torque<br>
request, the predicted brake output torque request, and the axle torque<br>
response type are individual inputs to the control system. Additionally,<br>
operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine<br>
the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No').<br>
[0033] The immediate accelerator output torque request comprises an<br>
immediate torque request determined based upon the operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The control system controls the output torque from the<br>
hybrid powertrain system in response to the immediate accelerator output<br>
torque request to cause positive acceleration of the vehicle. The immediate<br>
brake output torque request comprises an immediate braking request<br>
 <br>
determined based upon the operator input to the brake pedal 112. The control<br>
system controls the output torque from the hybrid powertrain system in<br>
response to the immediate brake output torque request to cause deceleration,<br>
or negative acceleration, of the vehicle. Vehicle deceleration effected by<br>
control of the output torque from the hybrid powertrain system is combined<br>
with vehicle deceleration effected by a vehicle braking system (not shown) to<br>
decelerate the vehicle to achieve the immediate braking request.<br>
[0034J The immediate accelerator output torque request is determined<br>
based upon a presently occurring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113,<br>
and comprises a request to generate an immediate output torque at the output<br>
member 64 preferably to accelerate the vehicle. The immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request is unshaped, but can be shaped by events that affect<br>
vehicle operation outside the powertrain control. Such events include vehicle<br>
level interruptions in the powertrain control for antilock braking, traction<br>
control and vehicle stability control, which can be used to unshape or rate-<br>
limit the immediate accelerator output torque request.<br>
[0035] The predicted accelerator output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 and comprises an<br>
optimum or preferred output torque at the output member 64. The predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request is preferably equal to the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request during normal operating conditions, e.g.,<br>
when any one of antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability is not<br>
being commanded. When any one of antilock braking, traction control or<br>
vehicle stability is being commanded the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request remains the preferred output torque with the immediate accelerator<br>
 <br>
output torque request being decreased in response to output torque commands<br>
related to the antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability control,<br>
[0036] The immediate brake output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and the control signal to control<br>
the friction brakes to generate friction braking torque.<br>
[0037] The predicted brake output torque request comprises an optimum<br>
or preferred brake output torque at the output member 64 in response to an<br>
operator input to the brake pedal 112 subject to a maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 allowable regardless of the operator<br>
input to the brake pedal 112. In one embodiment the maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 is limited to -0.2g. The predicted<br>
brake output torque request can be phased out to zero when vehicle speed<br>
approaches zero regardless of the operator input to the brake pedal 112. As<br>
desired by a user, there can be operating conditions under which the predicted<br>
brake output torque request is set to zero, e.g., when the operator setting to the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 is set to a reverse gear, and when a transfer case<br>
(not shown) is set to a four-wheel drive low range. The operating conditions<br>
whereat the predicted brake output torque request is set to zero are those in<br>
which blended braking is not preferred due to vehicle operating factors.<br>
[0038] The axle torque response type comprises an input state for shaping<br>
and rate-limiting the output torque response through the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The input state for the axle torque response type<br>
can be an active state, preferably comprising one of a pleasability limited state<br>
a maximum range state, and an inactive state. When the commanded axle<br>
torque response type is the active state, the output torque command is the<br>
 <br>
immediate output torque. Preferably the torque response for this response type<br>
is as fast as possible.<br>
[0039] Blended brake torque includes a combination of the friction<br>
braking torque generated at the wheels 93 and the output torque generated at<br>
the output member 64 which reacts with the driveline 90 to decelerate the<br>
vehicle in response to the operator input to the brake pedal 112. The BrCM 22<br>
commands the friction brakes on the wheels 93 to apply braking force and<br>
generates a command for the transmission 10 to create a negative output<br>
torque which reacts with the driveline 90 in response to the immediate braking<br>
request. Preferably the applied braking force and the negative output torque<br>
can decelerate and stop the vehicle so long as they are sufficient to overcome<br>
vehicle kinetic power at wheel(s) 93. The negative output torque reacts with<br>
the driveline 90, thus transferring torque to the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 and the engine 14. The negative output torque reacted<br>
through the electro-mechanical transmission 10 can be transferred to the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 to generate electric power for storage<br>
in the ESD 74.<br>
[0040] A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310<br>
determines a preferred input speed ('NiDes') and a preferred engine state and<br>
transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the<br>
output speed and the operator torque request and based upon other operating<br>
parameters of the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and<br>
response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The predicted accelerator output torque request<br>
and the predicted brake output torque request are input to the strategic<br>
 <br>
optimization control scheme 310. The strategic optimization control scheme<br>
310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and<br>
each 25 ms loop cycle. The desired operating range state for the transmission<br>
10 and the desired input speed from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 are<br>
inputs to the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320.<br>
[0041] The shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320<br>
commands changes in the transmission operation ('Transmission Commands')<br>
including changing the operating range state based upon the inputs and<br>
operation of the powertrain system. This includes commanding execution of a<br>
change in the transmission operating range state if the preferred operating<br>
range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding<br>
changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73.<br>
and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range<br>
state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('NiProf) can<br>
be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input<br>
speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted<br>
input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle.<br>
[0042] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine 14, including a<br>
preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request comprising<br>
the immediate accelerator output torque request, the predicted accelerator<br>
output torque request, the immediate brake output torque request, the predicted<br>
brake output torque request, the axle torque response type, and the present<br>
 <br>
operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also include<br>
engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a cylinder<br>
deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are<br>
deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and<br>
a fuel cutoff state. An engine command comprising the preferred input torque<br>
of the engine 14 and a present input torque ('Ti') reacting between the engine<br>
14 and the input member 12 are preferably determined in the ECM 23. Clutch<br>
torques ('Tel') for each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches are<br>
estimated, preferably in the TCM 17.<br>
[0043] An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('To_cmd'). This includes determining<br>
motor torque commands ('TA', 'TB') to transfer a net commanded output<br>
torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that meets the operator<br>
torque request, by controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
in this embodiment. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
immediate brake output torque request, the present input torque from the<br>
engine 14 and the estimated applied clutch torque(s), the present operating<br>
range state of the transmission 10, the input speed, the input speed profile, and<br>
the axle torque response type are inputs. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 executes to determine the motor torque commands<br>
during each iteration of one of the loop cycles. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly<br>
 <br>
executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the<br>
preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0044] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to<br>
the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque<br>
at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the operator input<br>
to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position of the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer<br>
the output torque to the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to<br>
generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse<br>
direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when<br>
the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands<br>
operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the<br>
vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient<br>
to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade,<br>
aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0045] Fig. 4 details the tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and<br>
Operation') 330 for controlling operation of the engine 14, described with<br>
reference to the hybrid powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2 and the control<br>
system architecture of Fig. 3. The tactical control scheme 330 includes a<br>
tactical optimization control path 350 and a system constraints control path<br>
360 which are preferably executed concurrently. The outputs of the tactical<br>
optimization control path 350 are input to an engine state control scheme 370.<br>
The outputs of the engine state control scheme 370 and the system constraints<br>
control path 360 are input to an engine response type determination scheme<br>
 <br>
('Engine Response Type Determination') 380 for controlling the engine state,<br>
the immediate engine torque request and the predicted engine torque request.<br>
[0046] The operating point of the engine 14 as described in terms of the<br>
input torque and input speed that can be achieved by controlling mass of<br>
intake air to the engine 14 when the engine 14 comprises a spark-ignition<br>
engine by controlling position of an engine throttle (not shown) utilizing an<br>
electronic throttle control device (not shown). This includes opening the<br>
throttle to increase the engine input speed and torque output and closing the<br>
throttle to decrease the engine input speed and torque. The engine operating<br>
point can be achieved by adjusting ignition timing, generally by retarding<br>
spark timing from a mean-best-torque spark timing to decrease engine torque.<br>
[0047] When the engine 14 comprises a compression-ignition engine, the<br>
operating point of the engine 14 can be achieved by controlling the mass of<br>
injected fuel, and adjusted by retarding injection timing from a mean-best-<br>
torque injection timing to decrease engine torque.<br>
[0048] The engine operating point can be achieved by changing the engine<br>
state between the engine-off state and the engine-on state. The engine<br>
operating point can be achieved by controlling the engine state between the<br>
all-cylinder state and the cylinder deactivation State, wherein a portion of the<br>
engine cylinders are unfueled and the engine valves are deactivated. The<br>
engine state can include the fuel cutoff state wherein the engine is rotating and<br>
unfueled to effect engine braking.<br>
[0049] The tactical optimization control path 350 acts on substantially<br>
steady state inputs to select a preferred engine state and determine a preferred<br>
input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10. The inputs originate in<br>
 <br>
the shift execution and engine operating state control scheme 320. The<br>
tactical optimization control path 350 includes an optimization scheme<br>
('Tactical Optimization') 354 to determine preferred input torques for<br>
operating the engine 14 in the all-cylinder state ('Optimum Input Torque<br>
Full'), in the cylinder deactivation state ('Optimum Input Torque Deac'), the<br>
all-cylinder state with fuel cutoff ('Input Torque Full FCO'), in the cylinder<br>
deactivation state with fuel cutoff ('Input Torque Deac FCO'), and a preferred<br>
engine state ('Optimal Engine State'). Inputs to the optimization scheme 354<br>
include a lead operating range state of the transmission 10 ('Lead Hybrid<br>
Range State') a predicted lead input acceleration profile ('Lead Input<br>
Acceleration Profile Predicted '), a predicted range of clutch reactive torques<br>
('Predicted Clutch Reactive Torque Min/Max') for each presently applied<br>
clutch, predicted battery power limits ('Predicted Battery Power Limits') and<br>
predicted output torque requests for acceleration ('Output Torque Request<br>
Accel Prdtd') and braking ('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd'). The<br>
predicted output torque requests for acceleration and braking are combined<br>
and shaped with the axle torque response type through a predicted output<br>
torque shaping filter 352 to yield a predicted net output torque request ('To<br>
Net Prdtd') and a predicted accelerator output torque request ('To Accel<br>
Prdtd'), which are inputs to the optimization scheme 354. The lead operating<br>
range state of the transmission 10 comprises a time-shifted lead of the<br>
operating range state of the transmission 10 to accommodate a response time<br>
lag between a commanded change in the operating range state and a measured<br>
change in the operating range state. The predicted lead input acceleration<br>
profile comprises a time-shifted lead of the predicted input acceleration profile<br>
 <br>
of the input member 12 to accommodate a response time lag between a<br>
commanded change in the predicted input acceleration profile and a measured<br>
change in the predicted input acceleration profile. The optimization scheme<br>
354 determines costs for operating the engine 14 in the engine states, which<br>
comprise operating the engine fueled and in the all-cylinder state ('PCOST FULL<br>
FUEL'), operating the engine unfueled and in the all-cylinder state ('PCOST FULL<br>
FCO'), operating the engine fueled and in cylinder deactivation state ('PCOST<br>
DEAC FUEL'), and operating the engine unfueled and in the cylinder deactivation<br>
state ('PCOST DEAC FCO'). The aforementioned costs for operating the engine 14<br>
are input to a stabilization analysis scheme ('Stabilization and Arbitration')<br>
356 along with the actual engine state ('Actual Engine State') and an<br>
allowable or permissible engine state ('Engine State Allowed') to select one of<br>
the engine states as the preferred engine state ('Optimal Engine State').<br>
[0050] The preferred input torques for operating the engine 14 in the all-<br>
cylinder state and in the cylinder deactivation state with and without fuel<br>
cutoff are input to an engine torque conversion calculator 355 and converted to<br>
preferred engine torques in the all-cylinder state and in the cylinder<br>
deactivation state ('Engine Torque Full') and ('Engine Torque Deac') and<br>
with fuel cutoff in the all-cylinder state and in the cylinder deactivation state<br>
('Engine Torque Full FCO') and ('Engine Torque Deac FCO') respectively,<br>
by taking into account parasitic and other loads introduced between the engine<br>
14 and the transmission 10. The preferred engine torques for operation in the<br>
all-cylinder state and in the cylinder deactivation state and the preferred<br>
engine state comprise inputs to the engine state control scheme 370.<br>
 <br>
[0051] The costs for operating the engine 14 include operating costs which<br>
are generally determined based upon factors that include vehicle driveability,<br>
fuel economy, emissions, and battery usage. Costs are assigned and<br>
associated with fuel and electrical power consumption and are associated with<br>
a specific operating points of the hybrid powertrain. Lower operating costs<br>
are generally associated with lower fuel consumption at high conversion<br>
efficiencies, lower battery power usage, and lower emissions for each engine<br>
speed/load operating point, and take into account the present operating state of<br>
the engine 14.<br>
[0052] The preferred engine state and the preferred engine torques in the<br>
all-cylinder state and in the cylinder deactivation state are input to the engine<br>
state control scheme 370, which includes an engine state machine ('Engine<br>
State Machine') 372. The engine state machine 372 determines a target<br>
engine torque ('Target Engine Torque') and a target engine state ('State')<br>
based upon the preferred engine torques and the preferred engine state. The<br>
target engine torque and the target engine state are input to a transition filter<br>
374 which monitors any commanded transition in the engine state and filters<br>
the target engine torque to provide a filtered target engine torque ('Filtered<br>
Target Engine Torque'). The engine state machine 372 outputs a command<br>
that indicates selection of one of the cylinder deactivation state and the all-<br>
cylinder state ('DEAC Selected') and indicates selection of one of the engine-<br>
on state and the deceleration fuel cutoff state ('FCO Selected'). The selection<br>
of one of the cylinder deactivation state and the all-cylinder state and the<br>
selection of one of the engine-on state and the deceleration fuel cutoff state,<br>
 <br>
the filtered target engine torque, and the minimum and maximum engine<br>
torques are input to the engine response type determination scheme 380.<br>
[0053] The system constraints control path 360 determines constraints on<br>
the input torque, comprising minimum and maximum input torques ('Input<br>
Torque Hybrid Minimum' and 'Input Torque Hybrid Maximum') that can be<br>
reacted by the transmission 10. The minimum and maximum input torques are<br>
determined based upon constraints to the transmission 10 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72, including clutch torques and battery<br>
power limits, which affect the capacity of the transmission 10 to react input<br>
torque during the current loop cycle. Inputs to the system constraints control<br>
path 360 include the immediate output torque request as measured by the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 ('Output Torque Request Accel lmmed') and the<br>
immediate output torque request as measured by the brake pedal 112 ('Output<br>
Torque Request Brake Immed') which are combined and shaped with the axle<br>
torque response type through an immediate output torque shaping filter 362 to<br>
yield a net immediate output torque ('To Net Immed') and an immediate<br>
accelerator output torque ('To Accel Immed'). The net immediate output<br>
torque preferably comprises an arithmetic sum of the immediate output torque<br>
requests as measured by the accelerator pedal 113 and the immediate output<br>
torque request as measured by the brake pedal 112. The net immediate output<br>
torque and the immediate accelerator output torque are input to a constraints<br>
scheme ('Output and Input Torque Constraints'). Other inputs to the<br>
constraints scheme 364 include the present operating range state of the<br>
transmission 10, an immediate lead input acceleration profile ('Lead Input<br>
Acceleration Profile Immed'), a lead immediate clutch reactive torque range<br>
 <br>
('Lead Immediate Clutch Reactive Torque Min/Max') for each presently<br>
applied clutch, and the available battery power ('Battery Power Limits')<br>
comprising the range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX. The immediate lead input<br>
acceleration profile comprises a time-shifted lead of the immediate input<br>
acceleration profile of the input member 12 to accommodate a response time<br>
lag between a commanded change in the immediate input acceleration profile<br>
and a measured change in the immediate input acceleration profile. The lead<br>
immediate clutch reactive torque range comprises a time-shifted lead of the<br>
immediate clutch reactive torque range of the clutches to accommodate a<br>
response time lag between a commanded change in the immediate clutch<br>
torque range and a measured change in the immediate clutch reactive torque<br>
range. The constraints scheme 364 determines an output torque range for the<br>
transmission 10, and then determines the minimum and maximum allowable<br>
input torques ('Input Torque Hybrid Minimum' and 'Input Torque Hybrid<br>
Maximum' respectively) that can be reacted by the transmission 10 based<br>
upon the aforementioned inputs. The minimum and maximum allowable input<br>
torques can change during ongoing operation, due to changes in the<br>
aforementioned inputs, including increasing energy recovery through electric<br>
power regeneration through the transmission 14 and first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0054] The minimum and maximum allowable input torques are input to<br>
the engine torque conversion calculator 355 and converted to minimum and<br>
maximum engine torques ('Engine Torque Hybrid Minimum' and 'Engine<br>
Torque Hybrid Maximum' respectively), by taking into account parasitic and<br>
other loads introduced between the engine 14 and the transmission 10.<br>
 <br>
The filtered target engine torque, the output of the engine state machine 372<br>
and the engine minimum and maximum engine torques are input to the engine<br>
response type determination scheme 380, which inputs the engine commands<br>
to the ECM 23 for controlling the engine state, the immediate engine torque<br>
request and the predicted engine torque request. The engine commands<br>
include an immediate engine torque request ('Engine Torque Request lmmed')<br>
and a predicted engine torque request ('Engine Torque Request Prdtd') that<br>
can be determined based upon the filtered target engine torque. Other<br>
commands control the engine state to one of the engine fueled state and the<br>
deceleration fuel cutoff state ('FCO Request') and to one of the cylinder<br>
deactivation state and the all-cylinder state ('DEAC Request'). Another<br>
output comprises an engine response type ('Engine Response Type'). When<br>
the filtered target engine torque is within the range between the minimum and<br>
maximum engine torques, the engine response type is inactive. When the<br>
filtered target engine torque is outside the constraints of the minimum and<br>
maximum engine torques ('Engine Torque Hybrid Minimum') and ('Engine<br>
Torque Hybrid Maximum') the engine response type is active, indicating a<br>
need for an immediate change in the engine torque, e.g., through engine spark<br>
control and retard to change the engine torque and the input torque to fall<br>
within the constraints of the minimum and maximum engine torques.<br>
[0055] Fig. 5 shows schematic details of the constraints scheme ('Output<br>
and Input Torque Constraints') 364 of the system constraints control path 360<br>
of the tactical control scheme 330, the operation of which is shown graphically<br>
in Fig. 6. The constraints scheme 364 determines constraints on the input<br>
torque comprising the minimum and maximum input torques ('Input Torque<br>
 <br>
Hybrid Minimum' and 'Input Torque Hybrid Maximum') to the input member<br>
12 from the engine 14. The minimum and maximum input torques are<br>
determined based upon constraints to the transmission 10 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72, including the reactive clutch torques and<br>
battery power limits which affect the capacity of the transmission 10 to react<br>
the input torque. Inputs to the system constraints control path 360 include the<br>
immediate output torque request as measured by the accelerator pedal 113<br>
('Output Torque Request Accel lmmed') and the immediate output torque<br>
request as measured by the brake pedal 112 ('Output Torque Request Brake<br>
Immed') which are combined and shaped with the axle torque response type<br>
through an immediate output torque shaping filter 362 to yield the net<br>
immediate output torque ('To Net Immed') and the immediate accelerator<br>
output torque ('To Accel Immed'). Other inputs to the constraints scheme 364<br>
include a lead operating range state of the transmission 10 ('Lead Hybrid<br>
Range State'), a lead immediate input acceleration profile ('Lead Input<br>
Acceleration Profile Immed'), a lead immediate clutch reactive torque range<br>
('Lead Immediate Clutch Reactive Torque Min/Max') for applied clutches C1<br>
70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and the available battery power ('Battery Power<br>
Limits') comprising the range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX. The lead immediate<br>
input acceleration profile comprises the immediate input acceleration profile<br>
of the input member 12 that is time-shifted to accommodate a response time<br>
lag between a commanded change in the immediate input acceleration profile<br>
and a measured change in the immediate input acceleration profile. The lead<br>
immediate clutch reactive torque range comprises the immediate clutch<br>
reactive torque range of the clutches that is time-shifted to accommodate a<br>
 <br>
response time lag between a commanded change in the immediate clutch<br>
torque range and a measured change in the immediate clutch reactive torque<br>
range. The lead operating range state of the transmission 10 comprises a time-<br>
shifted operating range state of the transmission to accommodate a response<br>
time lag between a commanded change in the operating range state and<br>
measured operating range state. The parameters designated as 'lead' are used<br>
to accommodate concurrent transfer of torque through the powertrain<br>
converging at the common output member 64 using devices having varying<br>
response times. Specifically, the engine 14 can have a response time of an<br>
order of magnitude of 300 - 600 ms, and each of the torque transfer clutches<br>
C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 can have response times of an order of<br>
magnitude of 150-300 ms, and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 can have response time of an order of magnitude of 10 ms.<br>
[0056] An output torque constraint algorithm 510 determines minimum<br>
and maximum raw output torque constraints ('Output Torque Minimum Raw'<br>
and 'Output Torque Maximum Raw') based upon the lead operating range<br>
state of the transmission 10, the immediate lead input acceleration profile, the<br>
lead immediate clutch reactive torque range for each presently applied clutch,<br>
and the available battery power, and other parameters including motor torque<br>
limits.<br>
[0057] The minimum and maximum raw output torques are circumscribed<br>
by the operator torque request, specifically the net immediate output torque<br>
and the immediate accelerator output torque. An output torque range<br>
algorithm ('Output Torque Range') 520 is executed to determine an output<br>
torque range comprising a minimum output torque and a maximum output<br>
 <br>
torque based upon the minimum and maximum raw output torques further<br>
limited by the immediate and net acceleration torque requests. An input<br>
torque constraints algorithm ('Input Torque Constraints') 530 is executed to<br>
determine minimum and maximum raw input torques ('Input Torque<br>
Minimum Raw' and 'Input Torque Maximum Raw') which can be shaped<br>
using a shaping algorithm ('Input Torque Constraint Shaping') 540 to<br>
determine minimum and maximum input torques ('Input Torque Hybrid<br>
Minimum' and 'Input Torque Hybrid Maximum').<br>
[0058] The output torque constraints algorithm 510 determines the output<br>
torque range comprising the raw minimum and maximum output torques. The<br>
engine 14 and transmission 10 are controlled to generate the output torque at<br>
the output member 64 constrained by power, torque and speed limits of the<br>
engine 14. the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, the electrical<br>
storage device 74 and the applied clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, or C4 75<br>
depending on the operating range state. The operating constraints on the<br>
engine 14 and transmission 10 can be translated to a set of system constraint<br>
equations executed as one or more algorithms in one of the control modules,<br>
e.g., the HCP 5.<br>
[0059] The transmission 10 operates in one of the operating range states<br>
through selective application of the torque-transfer clutches in one<br>
embodiment. Torque constraints for each of the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 and speed constraints for each of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are determined.<br>
Battery power constraints for the ESD 74 are determined, and are applied to<br>
further limit operation of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
 <br>
The preferred operating region for the powertrain is determined using the<br>
system constraint equations that are based upon the battery power constraints,<br>
the motor torque constraints, the speed constraints, and clutch reactive torque<br>
constraints. The preferred operating region comprises a range of permissible<br>
operating torques or speeds for the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. By deriving and simultaneously solving dynamics<br>
equations of the transmission 10, the torque constraint comprising maximum<br>
and minimum output torque in this embodiment can be determined. The<br>
output torque can be formulated in a parametric torque equation as follows,<br>
using Eq. 1:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Misc_TMI, Misc_TM2, and Misc_TM3 are constants which contribute<br>
to TMI, TM2, TM3 by non TA, TB, TMI, TM2 and TM3 parameters<br>
such as time-rate changes in speed of the input member 12, time-<br>
rate changes in speed of the output member 64, and slip speed(s)<br>
of the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75<br>
depending on the applications, and<br>
TA and TB are the motor torques from the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0060] Eqs. 1, 2, 3 are formulated to effect searches, with TMI, TM2, and TM3<br>
comprising three independently controllable parameters selected depend upon<br>
the solution being sought. In searching minimum and maximum raw output<br>
torques in block 510, the parametric equations TMI, TM2, TM3 are formulated<br>
based upon combinations of the output torque To, the input torque T1, clutch<br>
torques Tc1, Tc2, Tc3, and Tc4 for the reactive torque transferred across the<br>
torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10<br>
respectively, and input shaft acceleration Nidot, output shaft acceleration<br>
Nodot, and clutch slip speed Ncdot. The miscellaneous terms, which are<br>
constants at any instant, are as follows.<br>
Misc Tml : amount contributed to TMI by other variables except TA, TB,<br>
TMI, TM2 and TM3.<br>
Misc Tm2: amount contributed to TM2 by other variables except TA, TB,<br>
TMI,TM2 and TM3, and<br>
Misc Tm3: amount contributed to TM3 by other variables except TA, TB,<br>
TMI, TM2 and TM3.<br>
34<br>
 <br>
[0061] The output torque range, comprising the minimum and maximum<br>
output torques, is determined based upon the commanded output torque, as<br>
follows. The parametric torque equation TMI described in Eq. 1 can be<br>
searched to determine a range comprising a maximum and a minimum output<br>
torque subject to the parametric torque equations TM2 and TM3 which comprise<br>
torque constraints determined based upon the motor torques, the battery<br>
torques, and the other constraints described with reference to Eqs. 2 and 3.<br>
[0062] When the lead operating range state of the transmission 10 is in Mode<br>
1, the parametric torque equations of Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 are rewritten as follows:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0064] When the lead operating range state of the transmission 10 is in Gl,<br>
the parametric torque equations of Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 are rewritten as follows.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0069] The engine 14 and transmission 10 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 have speed constraints, torque constraints, and battery<br>
power constraints due to mechanical and system limitations. The speed<br>
constraints can include engine speed constraints of N1 = 0 (engine off state).<br>
 <br>
and N1 ranging from 600 rpm (idle) to 6000 rpm for the engine 14. The speed<br>
constraints for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for this<br>
embodiment can range as follows:<br>
-10,500 rpm ≤ NA ≤ +10,500 rpm, and<br>
-10,500 rpm ≤ NB ≤ +10,500 rpm<br>
The speed constraints can vary based upon specific operating points.<br>
[0070] The torque constraints include motor torque constraints for the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 including TA_MIN ≤TA ≤TA_MAX and<br>
TB_MIN ≤TB ≤TB_ MAX. The motor torque constraints TA_MAX and TA_MIN<br>
comprise torque limits for the first electric machine 56 when working as a<br>
torque motor and an electric generator at positive rotational speeds,<br>
respectively. The motor torque constraints TB_MAX and TB_MIN comprise<br>
torque limits for the second electric machine 72 when working as a torque<br>
motor and an electric generator at positive rotational speeds, respectively. The<br>
maximum and minimum motor torques TA_MAX, TA_MIN, TB_MAX, and TB_MIN<br>
are preferably obtained from data sets stored in tabular format within one of<br>
the memory devices of one of the control modules. Such data sets can be<br>
empirically derived from conventional dynamometer testing of the combined<br>
motor and power electronics, e.g., the TPIM 19, at various temperature and<br>
voltage conditions. Battery power constraints comprise the available battery<br>
power within the range of PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX, wherein PBAT_MIN is<br>
maximum allowable battery charging power and PBAT_MAX is the maximum<br>
allowable battery discharging power. The operation of the system described<br>
 <br>
hereinbelow is determined at known engine input speeds and torques, and thus<br>
the derivation of the equations is based upon torque transfer within the<br>
transmission 14.<br>
[0071] An operating range, comprising a torque output range is determinable<br>
based upon the battery power constraints of the ESD 74. Calculation of<br>
battery power usage, PBAT is as follows:<br>
PBAT = PA,ELEC + PB,ELEC + PDC_LOAD	[4]<br>
wherein PA.ELEC comprises electrical power from the first electric machine 56,<br>
PB,ELEC comprises electrical power from the second electric machine<br>
72, and<br>
PDC_LOAD comprises known DC load, including accessory loads.<br>
Substituting equations for PA,ELEC and PB,ELEC, yields the following equation:<br>
PBAT = (PA.MECH + PA,LOSS) + (PB,MECH + PB.LOSS) + PDC_LOAD	[5]<br>
wherein PA,MECH comprises mechanical power from the first electric machine<br>
56,<br>
PA,LOSS comprises power losses from the first electric machine 56,<br>
PB,MECH comprises mechanical power from the second electric<br>
machine 72, and<br>
PB,LOSS comprises power losses from the second electric machine 72.<br>
[0072] Eq. 5 can be restated as Eq. 6, below, wherein speeds, NA and NB, and<br>
torques, TA and TB, are substituted for powers PA and PB. This includes an<br>
 <br>
assumption that motor and inverter losses can be mathematically modeled as a<br>
quadratic equation based upon torque, as follows:<br>
 <br>
wherein NA, NB comprise motor speeds for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72,<br>
TA, TB comprise the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, and<br>
al, a2, a3, bl, b2, b3 each comprise quadratic coefficients which are<br>
a function of respective motor speeds, NA, NB.<br>
[0073] This can be restated as follows:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
[0080] Eq. 12 specifies the transformation of motor torque, TA to Tx and the<br>
transformation of motor torque TB to Ty. Thus, a new coordinate system<br>
referred to as Tx/Ty space is defined, and Eq. 13 comprises battery power PBAT<br>
transformed into Tx/Ty space. Therefore, the available battery power between<br>
maximum and minimum battery powers PBAT_MAX and PBAT_MIN can be<br>
 <br>
calculated and graphed as radii ('RMAX' and 'RMIN') with a center at locus (0,<br>
0) in the TX/TY space, and designated by the letter K, wherein:<br>
RMIN = SQRT(PBAT_MIN - C)<br>
RMAX = SQRT(PBAT_MAX - C)<br>
[0081] The minimum and maximum battery powers, PBAT_MIN and PBAT MAX,<br>
are preferably correlated to various conditions, e.g. state of charge,<br>
temperature, voltage and usage (amp-hour/hour). The parameter C, above, is<br>
defined as the absolute minimum possible battery power at given motor<br>
speeds, NA, NB, ignoring motor torque limits. Physically, when TA=0 and<br>
TB=0 the mechanical output power from the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 is zero. Physically Tx= 0 and Ty= 0 corresponds to a maximum<br>
charging power condition for the ESD 74. The positive sign ('+') is defined as<br>
discharging power from the ESD 74, and the negative sign ('-') is defined as<br>
charging power into the ESD 74. RMAX defines a maximum battery power<br>
typically a discharging power, and RMIN defines a minimum battery power,<br>
typically a charging power.<br>
[0082] The forgoing transformations to the TX/TY space, designated by a<br>
second coordinate system K, are shown in Fig. 6, with representations of the<br>
battery power constraints as concentric circles having radii of RMIN and RMax<br>
and linear representations of the motor torque constraints ('TA_MIN\ 'TA MAX',<br>
'TB_MIN', and 'TB_MAX') circumscribing an allowable operating region.<br>
Analytically, the transformed vector [Tx/Ty] determined in Eq. 12 is solved<br>
simultaneously with the vector defined in Eq. 13 to identify a range of<br>
 <br>
allowable torques in the Tx/Ty space which are made up of motor torques TA<br>
and TB constrained by the minimum and maximum battery powers PBAT_MIN to<br>
PBAT_MAX. The range of allowable motor torques in the Tx/Ty space is shown<br>
with reference to Fig. 6.<br>
[0083] A constant torque line can be defined in the Tx/Ty space, comprising<br>
the limit torque TMI, described in Eq. 1, above. As previously stated, the<br>
parametric torque equation TMI comprises the output torque TO in this<br>
embodiment and Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 are restated in the Tx/Ty space as follows.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0087] Eqs. 21, 22, and 23, representing the parametric torque equations TMI,<br>
TM2, and TM3 transformed to Tx/Ty space, are simultaneously solved to<br>
determine minimum and maximum values for TM1 constrained by TM2 and<br>
TM3.<br>
[0088] Fig. 6 graphically shows the battery power constraints ('Rmin' and<br>
'Rmax'), and the motor torque constraints for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 comprising maximum and minimum motor torques for the<br>
 <br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 ('TA_MAX', 'TA_MIN', 'TB_MAX',<br>
'TB_MIN'), plotted in Tx/Ty space. The parametric torque equations derived<br>
using the speed constraints, motor torque constraints, and battery power<br>
constraints can be simultaneously solved to determine the maximum and<br>
minimum raw output torques in Tx/Ty space, comprising TM1_XY Max and<br>
TMI_ XY Min. Subsequently the maximum and minimum limits on the output<br>
torque in the Tx/TY space can be retransformed out of the Tx/Ty space to the<br>
maximum and minimum raw output torques which are output to the output<br>
torque range determination algorithm ('Output Torque Range') 520, and<br>
plotted ('Output Torque Maximum Raw' and 'Output Torque Minimum<br>
Raw').<br>
[0089] The maximum and minimum raw output torques are constrained by<br>
the net immediate output torque and the immediate accelerator output torque<br>
to limit operation of the powertrain system based upon the operator torque<br>
request. Exemplary data illustrating the concept of constraining the maximum<br>
and minimum raw output torques is shown, resulting in a constrained<br>
minimum output torque ('Output Torque Minimum Range') and a constrained<br>
maximum output torque ('Output Torque Maximum Range') that can be<br>
determined taking into account the net immediate output torque and the<br>
immediate accelerator output torque (not shown).<br>
[0090] The input torque range is determined in the input torque constraints<br>
algorithm 530 based upon the minimum and maximum output torques as<br>
constrained by the minimum and maximum motor torques for the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. The input torque range can be<br>
determined using parametric Eqs. 1, 2, and 3, reconfigured to solve for input<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0092] Eqs. 1, 2, and 3 can be solved as described hereinabove, with TM2 =<br>
TO, and TO is defined as ranging from the constrained minimum output torque<br>
('Output Torque Minimum Range') to the constrained maximum output torque<br>
('Output Torque Maximum Range'). The input torque range is plotted in Fig.<br>
6 as the maximum and minimum input torques after any shaping, e.g., filtering<br>
that can occur in the input torque shaping algorithm ('Input Torque Constraint<br>
 <br>
Shaping') 540 to determine minimum and maximum hybrid input torques<br>
('Input Torque Hybrid Minimum' and 'Input Torque Hybrid Maximum'). A<br>
preferred maximum input torque can be determined, comprising the maximum<br>
input torque that meets the constrained maximum output torque and meets the<br>
motor torque constraints for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
and meets the available battery power for the ESD 74, shown as point H. A<br>
preferred minimum input torque can be determined, comprising the minimum<br>
input torque that meets the constrained minimum output torque and meets the<br>
motor torque constraints for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
and meets the available battery power for the ESD 74, shown as point J.<br>
[0093] The preferred minimum and maximum input torques define<br>
maximum and minimum limits on the input torque in the Tx/Ty space. The<br>
preferred minimum and maximum input torques can be retransformed out of<br>
the Tx/Ty space to the minimum and maximum hybrid input torques ('Input<br>
Torque Hybrid Minimum' and 'Input Torque Hybrid Maximum'), which are<br>
output to the engine torque conversion calculator 355 and converted to<br>
minimum and maximum engine torques ('Engine Torque Hybrid Minimum'<br>
and 'Engine Torque Hybrid Maximum' respectively), by taking into account<br>
parasitic and other loads introduced between the engine 14 and the<br>
transmission 10. The minimum and maximum engine torques are input to the<br>
engine response type determination scheme 380 to constrain operation of the<br>
engine 14, including determining whether the engine response type is active or<br>
inactive.<br>

modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
 <br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
