				<td>[technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to methods and devices for enabling the access to a cellular<br>
telecommunications network via a further access network.<br>
[related art]<br>
In recent years the percentage of household having a broadband connection at home was<br>
increasing. Today 11% of the households in Germany are equipped with a broadband<br>
connection (mainly ADSL). In Sweden the percentage is already 22% (50% ADSL, 50 %<br>
other technologies). It is expected that these percentages will increase significantly over the<br>
next years. Many of these users will install private WLAN(Wireless Local Area Network-<br>
access points to connect their PCs (Personal Computers), PDA (Personal Digital Assistants),<br>
mobile phones etc. to their fixed broadband connection.<br>
Furthermore, it is expected that the number of public WLAN-hot spots in Europe will increase<br>
from approx. 18.000 (2003) to 36.000 (2009).<br>
Parallel, to the increased number of broadband connections the users are starting to use IP<br>
(Internet Protocol) telephony over their WLAN-broadband connection via PCs and PDAs. In<br>
the next years mobile phone vendors will launch so-called GSM/WLAN dual mode phones<br>
(e.g. Nokia 2005).<br>
For these users of the GSM/WLAN dual mode phones it will be quite easy to originate calls<br>
via the SIP-client over the WLAN-radio interface towards other SIP-clients connected to the<br>
same network or even to the internet.<br>
However, and unsolved matter is the reception of incoming calls at the dual mode devices.<br>
Today several architectures are proposed how to integrate cellular networks with WLAN-<br>
access points. The main focus is the integration of the WLAN-access point towards the packet<br>
switching network.<br>
For example Mobile @home proposes an architecture where the WLAN-access point is<br>
connected via a broadband connection to the BSC. The disadvantage of this solution is that<br>
2<br><br>
the same operator has to supply the cellular mobile network and the broadband connection.<br>
Furthermore, Mobile @home proposes a solution based on the ADSL (Asymmetric Digital<br>
Subscriber Line) technology.<br>
US 2003/026245 Al discloses a communication system including an interworking mobile<br>
switching centre for call termination. However, the document does not relate to an<br>
architecture involving different access networks.<br>
US 2003/134636 Al discloses methods and apparatus for a mobile station to sense and select<br>
a wireless local area network or a wide area mobile wireless network. However, the document<br>
does not disclose the handling of incoming calls.<br>
It is a shortcoming of the state of the art that solutions designed for speech connections lack<br>
flexibility.<br>
Therefore it is object of the invention to provide methods and devices for enabling the access<br>
for speech connections to a cellular telecommunications network via a further access network<br>
with an improved flexibility.<br>
[summary]<br>
This will be solved advantageously by the methods of claims 1 and 11, the control node of<br>
claim 12 and the user equipment of claim 19. Further advantageous embodiments can be<br>
derived from the dependent claims.<br>
One advantage of the invented method, control node and user equipment is that it requires<br>
modifications in the control node and the user equipment. Thus the invention can be<br>
implemented without major modifications of the existing networks.<br>
The invention introduces a method for handling an incoming call to a user equipment by a<br>
control node of a cellular telecommunication network. Said method comprises the steps of<br>
receiving an indication of an incoming call to the user equipment in the control node,<br>
determining that the called user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to<br>
a session initiation protocol, initiating the linking in on a route towards the device operating<br>
3<br><br>
according to a session initiation protocol, of a device that transforms messages sent according<br>
to a call control signalling protocol used in the cellular telecommunications network into<br>
messages according to the session initiation protocol and vice versa, and initiating the linking<br>
in on a route towards the device operating according to a session initiation protocol, of a<br>
device that transforms user plane transmitted according to a protocol used in the cellular<br>
telecommunications network into user plane transmitted according to an internet protocol and<br>
vice versa.<br>
This enables the use of a further access network for transmitting payload at a terminating call.<br>
In most cases the further access network is cheaper for the transmission of data that the scarce<br>
radio resources of the 2G or 3G radio network.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises the steps of receiving in the control<br>
node an indication that the user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to<br>
a session initiation protocol, determining an address of the device operating according to a<br>
session initiation protocol, and sending an indication that the user equipment can be reached<br>
via a device operating according to a session initiation protocol to a storage connected to the<br>
control node.<br>
The method can further comprise the additional step of sending a message comprising an<br>
indication that the user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to a<br>
session initiation protocol is sent to a database for storing subscriber data.<br>
The indication that the user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to a<br>
session initiation protocol can be received in a location area update message sent by the user<br>
equipment.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the step of determining comprises the steps of<br>
interrogating a database for storing subscriber data for routing information for reaching the<br>
called user equipment, receiving a response from said database and determining from<br>
analysing the response that the user equipment can be reached via a device operating<br>
according to a session initiation protocol.<br>
4<br><br>
The database can be an AAA server, a home location register or a home subscriber server.<br>
The control node can be a mobile services switching centre., and the device that transforms<br>
messages sent according to a call control signalling protocol used in the cellular<br>
telecommunications network into messages according to the session initiation protocol and<br>
vice versa transforms messages can be a media gateway control function.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the device that transforms user plane transmitted<br>
according to a protocol used in the cellular telecommunications network into user plane<br>
transmitted according to an internet protocol is a media gateway or is located in a media<br>
gateway.<br>
The device operating according to a session initiation protocol can be for example a service<br>
initiation protocol proximity server or an interrogating call session control function.<br>
The invention further introduces a method for operating a user equipment that comprises a<br>
first transmission unit for communicating with a cellular telecommunications access network<br>
and a second transmission unit for communicating with a further access network. The method<br>
comprises the steps of attaching to the cellular telecommunications network, determining that<br>
the user equipment is currently located in an area that is covered by the further access<br>
network, sending a session initiation protocol message for registering the user equipment at a<br>
server of the further access network, receiving a session initiation protocol message<br>
confirming that the user equipment has been registered, sending a message comprising an<br>
indication that the user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to the<br>
session initiation protocol to a control node of the cellular telecommunications network via<br>
the cellular telecommunications access network.<br>
A control node for a cellular telecommunication network according to the invention<br>
comprises in input unit, an output unit, a control unit, wherein the control unit is adapted to<br>
determine that a user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to a session<br>
initiation protocol. The control unit is further adapted to initiate the linking in on a route<br>
towards the device operating according to a session initiation protocol, of a device that<br>
transforms messages sent according to a call control signalling protocol used in the cellular<br>
telecommunications network into messages according to the session initiation protocol and<br>
5<br><br>
vice versa, and to initiate the linking in on a route towards the device operating according to a<br>
session initiation protocol, of a device that transforms user plane transmitted according to a<br>
protocol used in the cellular telecommunications network into user plane transmitted<br>
according to an internet protocol and vice versa.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the control node is connected to a storage for storing<br>
subscriber data, and the input unit is adapted to receive an indication that a user equipment<br>
can be reached via a device operating according to a session initiation protocol and to signal it<br>
to the control unit, and that the control unit is adapted to initiate the sending of an indication<br>
that the user equipment can be reached via a device operating according to a session initiation<br>
protocol to the storage for storing subscriber data and to determine an address for sending data<br>
towards the user equipment.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the indication sent to the storage for string subscriber data<br>
comprises an address of the device operating according to a session initiation protocol.<br>
The control node can be implemented by means of a mobile services switching centre or a<br>
mobile services switching centre server.<br>
The storage can be a visitor location register.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the control node is adapted to initiate the sending of a<br>
message to a database for storing subscriber data, wherein the message comprises an<br>

[detailed description]<br>
In the following the invention will be further described by means of examples and by means<br>
of figures.<br>
7<br><br>
It should be noted that the WLAN access is just an exemplary embodiment and could be<br>
replaced by any other access technology as for example Bluetooth, optical connection or fixed<br>
line connection. In particular access technology with lower costs on transmission resources<br>
like bandwidth than the GSM or WCDMA technology can be used advantageously for the<br>
further access.<br>
It should be further noted that for an implementation of the invented methods, the access point<br>
adapted to communicate over a radio, fixed or optical connection to user equipment, may be<br>
connected by any means to a domain operating according to a session initiation protocol and<br>
transmitting data according to an internet protocol.<br>
Figure 1 depicts an architecture for enabling a user equipment to access a telecommunications<br>
network via a further access network, comprising an home location register 101, a gateway<br>
mobile services switching centre, a combined mobile services switching centre/media<br>
gateway control function 103 which are connected to each other. In another embodiment of<br>
the invention the mobile services switching centre and the media gateway control function are<br>
not combined but just interconnected. The combined mobile services switching centre/media<br>
gateway control function 103 is further connected to an internet domain 104 comprising a first<br>
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) proxy (proximity server) 105 and a second SIP proxy 106<br>
that is connected to telephone 107 adapted to send signals according to SIP. The internet<br>
domain is connected via an ISP (Internet Service Provider) 108 and a DSLAM (Digital<br>
Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) 109 to a local exchange 110 which is connected to a<br>
public switched telephony network 111.<br>
The local exchange is further connected via a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) modem 112 to a<br>
WLAN-access Point 113.<br>
A user equipment 116 is connected via a WLAN radio connection 114 to the WLAN Access<br>
Point and via a GSM or WCDMA radio connection 115 to the mobile services switching<br>
centre/media gateway control function.<br>
According to the invention, the user equipment 116 can use the WLAN radio connection 114<br>
to register in the first SIP proxyl05. The details of the registration will be explained in figure<br>
8<br><br>
la. Figure la depicts a registration of the mode user equipment 116 with the first SIP proxy<br>
105. This is state of the art. To that end the user equipment 106 sends a SIP register message<br>
towards the SIP proxy 105 via the WLAN radio connection 114. After successful registration<br>
the SIP proxy returns a 200 OK message to the user equipment. After receiving this<br>
confirmation that the registration has been successful the user equipment sends an indication<br>
that it can be reached via the SIP proxy to the mobile services switching centre via the GSM<br>
or WCDMA connection 115 by sending a location update message. The mobile services<br>
switching centre stores the indication in a visitor location register. It returns an accepted<br>
message to indicate the reception of the location update.<br>
The sending of the indication can be implemented in several ways. It can be sent for example<br>
in a USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) message or any other signalling<br>
means between user equipment and mobile services switching centre. In the preferred<br>
embodiment it is included in a location update message.<br>
Independent from the means used for transporting the information from user equipment to<br>
mobile services switching centre, the information can be sent as a simple indication, for<br>
example a flag, indicating that an alternative access technology is available. In that case one<br>
can always use the same predefined device for routing calls from the mobile services<br>
switching centre/media gateway control function to the user equipment. Such device can be<br>
for example an interrogating call session control function as defined in the 3GPP<br>
recommendation 29.163 version 6.2.0 of March 2004. If not always the same device is used a<br>
device must be identified.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the SIP proxy is identified by an identification of<br>
the user equipment. To that end, an identification of the user equipment, e.g. the MSISDN or<br>
the IMSI, is stored in a table or a database in association with an identification of the SIP<br>
proxy, conveniently this can be the address of the SIP proxy. In a further embodiment of the<br>
invention, the user equipment identification can be related to an operator and the operator<br>
identification can be stored in relation to the SIP proxy identification.<br>
Alternatively, a device can be identified for example by determining location information of<br>
the user equipment like a location area or geographical coordinates and using a mapping table<br>
9<br><br>
that maps said location information to an address. A further way to address the user<br>
equipment is the use of an ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping) database as defined in IETF<br>
(Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC 3761. The ENUM database maps the telephone<br>
number, for example the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) of the user<br>
equipment, to an IP address. A further way is the transmission of a location area identifier in<br>
the location update message. The location area identifier carries an identification of the SIP<br>
proxy or of an access point, for example an ESSID (Extended Services Set IDentification), a<br>
domain name or a WLAN location area identification.<br>
Figure 2 depicts signal flow for an incoming call according to the invention. The architecture<br>
of figure 1 is used for receiving an incoming call at the user equipment 116 via the further<br>
access network, the WLAN access point 113.<br>
In a first step 201 a call request message, here an IAM (Initial address Message) is received at<br>
a control node, the gateway mobile services switching centre 102. The gateway mobile<br>
services switching centre analyses the received data and requests routing info from a database<br>
for storing subscriber data by sending a send routing info message 202 to the home location<br>
register 101. The home location register analyses the request and sends a request for an<br>
address of the called user equipment to a control node by sending a provide roaming number<br>
message 203 to the mobile services switching centre 103. The mobile services switching<br>
centre responds with a provide roaming number message 204 comprising a roaming number<br>
of the called user equipment. The home location register provides routing information 205 to<br>
the gateway mobile services switching centre which uses this information to forward the call<br>
request message 206 to the mobile services switching centre.<br>
The call control node mobile services switching centre receives the indication of an incoming<br>
call the IAM 206 and determines from that the call is directed to a user equipment that can be<br>
reached via a device operating according to a SIP protocol. It determines that the call can be<br>
routed via the SIP proxy 105 and links in the media gateway control function for transforming<br>
the ISUP signalling into SIP signalling. Not depicted is the linking of the media gateway for<br>
transforming payload transmitted according to a transfer mode used in the cellular core<br>
network to payload transmitted according to an IP.<br>
10<br><br>
In a next step 207 the control node mobile services switching centre 103 forwards the<br>
signalling via the media gateway control function as SIP signalling to the device operating<br>
according to a SIP, the SIP proxy 105. The SIP proxy 105 analyses the received information<br>
from the mobile services switching centre. By using the information received when<br>
registering the user equipment it initiates that the call is routed to the user equipment in a next<br>
step 209. The user equipment terminates the call in a step 210, via the further access network,<br>
implemented as the WLAN radio connection from the WLAN access point.<br>
Figure 3 depicts an alternative architecture for enabling a user equipment to access a<br>
telecommunications network via a further access network. The architecture comprises a<br>
control node implemented as a gateway mobile services switching centre 301. The gateway<br>
mobile services switching centre is collocated with a device that transforms messages sent<br>
according to a call control signalling protocol used in the cellular telecommunications<br>
network into messages according to the session initiation protocol and vice versa, in the<br>
example a media gateway control function. This collocation is optional, for the invention it is<br>
sufficient if they are connected to each other. The gateway mobile services switching<br>
centre/media gateway control function is connected to database for storing subscriber data,<br>
implemented as a home location register 303. The gateway mobile services switching<br>
centre/media gateway control function 301 is further connected to a control node 302 which is<br>
a mobile services switching centre. The home location register and mobile services switching<br>
centre are also connected to each other. The mobile services switching centre 302 is further<br>
connected to an internet domain 104 in particular to a device operating according to a session<br>
initiation protocol, implemented as a SIP proxy 105 known from figure 1. Apart from the<br>
home location register 303, the mobile services switching centre 302 and the gateway mobile<br>
services switching centre/media gateway control function 301, the architecture is similar to<br>
the architecture of figure 1. Also similar are the actions of the user equipment 116 that<br>
registers itself with a server of the further access network, that is with the SIP server 105 and<br>
sends an indication that it can be reached via a device operating according to a SIP, that is<br>
again SIP server 105, to the control node 302 of the cellular telecommunications network.<br>
However, the mobile services switching centre will perform one additional step compared to<br>
the architecture of figure 1, it sends an indication that the user equipment can be reached via a<br>
device operating according to a SIP to the home location register 303. The home location<br>
register stores said indication related to the user equipment or related to the subscriber or user<br>
11<br><br>
of the user equipment. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the indication comprises<br>
an address of the device operating according to a SIP.<br>
Figure 4 depicts an alternative signal flow for an incoming call according to the invention, in<br>
the architecture of figure 3. In a first step 401 the gateway mobile services switching<br>
centre/media gateway control function 301 receives an indication of an incoming call to the<br>
user equipment by means of an IAM. It analyses the IAM and requests routing information of<br>
the home location register 303 by sending a send routing info message in a step 402. The<br>
home location register analyses the message and checks the appropriate subscriber data. Said<br>
data comprise an indication that the user equipment can be reached via device operating<br>
according to a SIP. The home location register returns an address of the device or information<br>
that enables the determination of the device in a send routing info message in a step 403.<br>
The gateway mobile services switching centre determines that the called user equipment can<br>
be reached via a device operating according to a session initiation protocol. It initiates the<br>
linking in on a route towards the device operating according to a session initiation protocol,<br>
i.e. the SIP server, of a device that transforms messages sent according to a call control<br>
signalling protocol used in the cellular telecommunications network into messages according<br>
to the session initiation protocol and vice versa, i.e. the gateway mobile services switching<br>
centre.<br>
The gateway mobile services switching centre further initiates the linking in on a route<br>
towards the device operating according to a session initiation protocol, of a device that<br>
transforms user plane transmitted according to a protocol used in the cellular<br>
telecommunications network into user plane transmitted according to an internet protocol and<br>
vice versa, which is a media gateway or a device connected to or comprised in a media<br>
gateway.<br>
After initiating the linking in at least on the signalling path, the gateway mobile services<br>
switching centre forwards the call request to the SIP proxy in a step 404. the further steps are<br>
the same as described by means of figure 2, i.e. the SIP proxy 105 analyses the received<br>
information from the mobile services switching centre. By using the information received<br>
when registering the user equipment it initiates that the call is routed to the user equipment in<br>
a next step 405.<br>
12<br><br>
Figure 5 depicts a control node CN5 according to the invention, comprising an input unit IU5,<br>
an output unit OU5, and a control unit CU5.<br>
The control node can be operating for example as a mobile services switching centre or a<br>
gateway mobile services switching centre.<br>
Figure 6 depicts a user equipment UE6 according to the invention, comprising a first<br>
transmission unit TU61 for communicating with a first access network of a<br>
telecommunications network, a second transmission unit TU62 for communicating with a<br>
further access network, and a control unit CU6. The user equipment first attaches to a first<br>
cellular telecommunications access network like a so-called 2G or 3G network via the first<br>
transmission unit TU61.When the user equipment enters a coverage area for the second<br>
