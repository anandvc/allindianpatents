				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RADIO COMMUNICATION BASE STATION APPARATUS, RADIO<br>
COMMUNICATION MOBILE STATION APPARATUS AND RADIO<br>
COMMUNICATION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a radio<br>
communication base station apparatus, radio<br>
communication mobile station apparatus and radio<br>
communication method.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the field of mobile communications,<br>
technological studies on multimedia broadcast/multicast<br>
service (hereinafter referred to as "MBMS") are underway<br>
recently. Communications carried out in MBMS are not<br>
point to point (P-to-P) communications, but point to multi<br>
(P-to-M) communications. That is, in an MBMS, one radio<br>
communication base station apparatus (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "base station") sends the same information<br>
to a plurality of radio communication mobile station<br>
apparatuses (hereinafter referred to as "mobile<br>
stations") simultaneously.<br>
The MBMS has a broadcast mode and multicast mode.<br>
While the broadcast mode is a mode in which information<br>
is sent to all mobile stations as with current radio<br>
broadcasting, the multicast mode is a mode in which<br>
information is sent to only specific mobile stations<br>
affiliating a news group or other services.<br>
Advantages in carrying out the MBMS include the<br>
following: That is, when each mobile station receives<br>
information sent from a base station through a streaming<br>
service, etc., using one channel, if the number of mobile<br>
stations requesting the information increases, the load<br>
on the radio channel increases. However, when the MBMS<br>
is used, even if the number of mobile stations increases,<br>
all those mobile stations receive the information using<br>
the same channel, and therefore it is possible to increase<br>
the number of mobile stations capable of receiving the<br>
information without increasing the load on the radio<br>
channel. Currently, distribution of traffic<br>
information, music distribution, news distribution at<br>
a station, distribution of live coverage of a sport event,<br>
etc. , are considered as services available using the MBMS<br>
and providing these services at a transmission rate of<br>
approximately 8 to 256 kbps is under study.<br>
Here, when an attempt is made to provide high<br>
reception quality in an MBMS for a mobile station located<br>
on a cell boundary, this results in excessive reception<br>
quality for mobile stations located close to a base station,<br>
producing waste . In this case, transmit power of a signal<br>
to be sent to the mobile station located on the cell<br>
boundary grows extremely and causes a reduction of the<br>
subscriber capacity of the entire system as a consequence.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a radio communication base station apparatus, radio<br>
communication mobile station apparatus and radio<br>
communication method capable of performing appropriate<br>
reception quality control over each mobile station in<br>
an MBMS.<br>
In order to solve the above described problems and<br>
attain the above described object, the present invention<br>
is characterized in that a plurality of code strings which<br>
is coded by being divided into a plurality of layers is<br>
modulated in such a way that error rates differ<br>
hierarchically among the plurality of code strings.<br>
With this feature, even in the case such as an MBMS<br>
where the same information is sent to a plurality of mobile<br>
stations, transmission rates and reception quality are<br>
divided hierarchically according to their distances from<br>
the base station, and therefore it is possible to provide<br>
services at a high transmission rate and of high quality<br>
for mobile stations located near the base station on one<br>
hand, and provide services at a low transmission rate<br>
and of low quality with a minimum transmission rate and<br>
minimum quality guaranteed for mobile stations located<br>
on the cell boundary on the other.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings,<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail below.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Among modulation schemes, there is a multi-value<br>
modulation scheme capable of transmitting a plurality<br>
of bits with one symbol. The multi-value modulation<br>
scheme includes a QPSK (Quardrature Phase Shift Keying)<br>
which transmits 2 bits with one symbol, 16QAM (Quadrature<br>
Amplitude Modulation) which transmits 4 bits with one<br>
symbol and 64QAM which transmits 6 bits with one symbol,<br>
etc. For example, with the 16QAM, it is possible to<br>
transmit 4-bit information with one symbol by arranging<br>
16 symbol points at different positions on the IQ plane.<br>
It is a signal space diagram that shows this symbol point<br>
arrangement. Taking a 16QAM as an example of a<br>
multi-value modulation scheme, a 16QAM signal space<br>
diagram will be explained. FIG.1 is a signal section<br>
diagram showing a 16QAM symbol point arrangement.<br>
As shown in FIG.l, the 16QAM performs amplitude<br>
modulation with four values on each of the I-axis and<br>
Q-axis and thereby arranges 16 symbol points at different<br>
positions on the IQ plane. Using multi-values in this<br>
way allows 4-bit information to be transmitted with one<br>
symbol . When multi-values are used in this way, in order<br>
to improve a bit error rate characteristic, symbol points<br>
are arranged in such a way that one symbol differs from<br>
another neighboring symbol by only one bit as shown in<br>
FIG.l. This is called "gray coding."<br><br>
In the case of the 16QAM, the error rate of each<br>
bit within one symbol varies depending on the bit position.<br>
That is, in the case of the 16QAM, the third bit and fourth<br>
bit have a higher error rate than the first bit and the<br>
second bit. This will be explained below. As shown in<br>
FIG.l, a case where decision thresholds are set to + 2,<br>
0 and -2 for both the I channel and Q channel will be<br>
explained.<br>
FIG.2A to FIG.2D illustrate a 16QAM decision method.<br>
Black bullets in FIG.2A to FIG.2D are the respective symbol<br>
points shown in FIG.l and the assignment of bits in each<br>
symbol is also the same as that shown in FIG.l. In this<br>
case, bits of each symbol are decided as follows.<br>
That is, in FIG.l, when attention is focused on the<br>
most significant bit (first bit) bl, the plus area on<br>
the I-axis (right-hand area with respect to the Q-axis)<br>
11 is "0" and the minus area on the I-axis (left-hand<br>
area with respect to the Q-axis) 12 is "1" . Therefore,<br>
as shown in FIG.2A, on the receiver side, when a received<br>
symbol is located in the plus area 11 of the I-axis, bl<br>
is decided to be "0" and when the received symbol is located<br>
in the minus area 12 of the I-axis, bl is decided to be<br>
"1" . That is, by only deciding in which of the two areas<br>
the received symbol exists, it is possible to decide<br>
whether bl is "0" or "1". In other words, with regard<br>
to bl, it is possible to decide whether bl is "0" or "1"<br>
by deciding whether the value on the I-axis is positive<br>
or negative.<br>
Then, in FIG.l, when attention is focused on the<br>
second highest bit (second bit) b2, the plus area on the<br>
Q-axis (upper area with respect to the I-axis) 13 is "0"<br>
and the minus area on the Q-axis (lower area with respect<br>
to the I-axis) 14 is "l" . Therefore, as shown in FIG.2B,<br>
on the receiver side, when the received symbol is located<br>
in the plus area 13 of the Q-axis, b2 is decided to be<br>
"0" and when the received symbol is located in the minus<br>
area 14 of the Q-axis, b2 is decided to be "1" . That is,<br>
by only deciding in which of the two areas the received<br>
symbol exists, it is possible to decide whether b2 is<br>
"0" or "1" . In other words, with regard to b2, it is<br>
possible to decide whether b2 is "0" or "1" by deciding<br>
whether the value on the Q-axis is positive or negative.<br>
Then, in FIG.l, when attention is focused on the<br>
third highest bit (third bit) b3, an area 15 which is<br>
equal to or greater than 0 and smaller than +2 and an<br>
area 16 which is equal to or greater than -2 and smaller<br>
than 0 on the I-axis are "0" and an area 17 which is equal<br>
to or greater than +2 and an area 18 which is smaller<br>
than -2 on the I-axis are "l" . Therefore, on the receiver<br>
side, as shown in FIG.2C, when the received symbol is<br>
located in the area 15 which is equal to or greater than<br>
0 and smaller than +2 on the I-axis or the area 16 which<br>
is equal to or greater than -2 and smaller than 0, b3<br>
is decided to be "0" and when the received symbol is located<br>
in the area 17 which is equal to or greater than +2 on<br>
the I-axis or the area 18 which is smaller than -2, b3<br>
is decided to be "1" . That is, it is necessary to decide<br>
in which of the four areas the received symbol is located<br>
to decide whether b3 is 0 or 1.<br>
Then, in FIG.l, when attention is focused on the<br>
least significant bit (fourth bit) b4, an area 19 which<br>
is equal to or greater than 0 and smaller than +2 on the<br>
Q-axis and an area 20 which is equal to or greater than<br>
-2 and smaller than 0 are "0" and an area 21 which is<br>
equal to or greater than +2 on the Q-axis and an area<br>
22 which is smaller than -2 are "l". Therefore, on the<br>
receiver side, as shown in FIG. 2D, when the received symbol<br>
is located in the area 19 which is equal to or greater<br>
than 0 and smaller than +2 on the Q-axis or the area 20<br>
which is equal to or greater than -2 and smaller than<br>
0, b4 is decided to be "0" and when the received symbol<br>
is located in the area 21 which is equal to or greater<br>
than +2 on the Q-axis or the area 22 which is smaller<br>
than -2, b4 is decided to be "1" . That is, it is necessary<br>
to decide in which of the four areas the received symbol<br>
is located to decide whether b4 is "0" or "1".<br>
Thus, while it is only necessary to decide in which<br>
of the two areas the received symbol is located for b1<br>
and b2, it is necessary to decide in which of the four<br>
areas the received symbol is located for b3 and b4.<br>
Furthermore, the respective decision areas 11 to 14 are<br>
wider than the respective decision areas 15 to 22.<br>
Therefore, the probability that bl and b2 may be decided<br>
erroneously is smaller than the probability that b3 and<br><br>
b4 may be decided erroneously.<br>
What is described above is not limited to 16QAM.<br>
That is, the same applies to any multi-value modulation<br>
scheme in which one symbol includes a plurality of bits<br>
and the error rate varies from one bit to another and<br>
higher bits have smaller error rates. However, in the<br>
case of 16QAM, etc., error rates become the same for a<br>
plurality of bits. For example, with 16QAM, the first<br>
bit b1 and the second bit b2 have the same error rate<br>
and the third bit b3 and the fourth bit b4 have the same<br>
error rate.<br>
Thus, taking advantage of the fact that the error<br>
rate of each bit varies depending on the position of the<br>
bit within a multi-value modulated symbol, this<br>
embodiment modulates a plurality of code strings coded<br>
by being divided into a plurality of layers in such a<br>
way that their error rates vary hierarchically among the<br>
plurality of code strings. That is, of the plurality of<br>
code strings, code strings whose error rate is preferred<br>
to be reduced are modulated by being assigned to higher<br>
bits of the plurality of bits making up the symbol. This<br>
will be achieved with the following configuration.<br>
FIG.3 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a base station according to Embodiment 1 of the present<br>
invention. The base station shown in FIG.3 is used in<br>
a system carrying out an MBMS and sends a symbol with<br>
the same content to a plurality of mobile stations. This<br>
base station is constructed of a layered coding section<br>
101, a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) code addition section<br>
102, a CRC code addition section 103, a layered modulation<br>
section 104, a radio section 105 and an antenna 106.<br>
The layered coding section 101 obtains a first layer<br>
code string and a second layer code string through dividing<br>
data input into two layers and encoding those. The first<br>
layer code string is a minimum necessary code string for<br>
a mobile station to obtain decoded data through decoding.<br>
Therefore, the first layer may also be called a "base<br>
layer." Furthermore, the second layer code string is a<br>
code string additional to the first layer code string<br>
and is a code string necessary to obtain high quality<br>
decoded data through decoding at the mobile station.<br>
Therefore, the second layer may also be called an<br>
"enhanced layer." The mobile station which is the<br>
receiver side performs decoding using both the first layer<br>
code string and the second layer code string or using<br>
only the first layer code string. That is, it is possible<br>
to obtain decoded data of higher reception quality when<br>
decoding is performed using both the first layer code<br>
string and the second layer code string than when decoding<br>
is performed using only the first layer code string.<br>
Here, as an example, suppose both the first layer<br>
code string and the second layer code string are code<br>
strings having a transmission rate of 32 kbps.<br>
Furthermore, suppose 32 kbps is the minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed in an MBMS . In this way, when the<br>
mobile station performs decoding using both the first<br>
layer code string and the second layer code string, it<br>
is possible to obtain decoded data having a high<br>
transmission rate of 64 kbps, while when decoding is<br>
performed using only the first layer code string, it is<br>
possible to obtain decoded data having the minimum<br>
transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps. This is<br>
because the decoding using only the first layer code string<br>
uses fewer codes than the decoding using both the first<br>
layer code string and the second layer code string.<br>
In FIG.3, the first layer code string is input to<br>
the CRC code addition section 102 where a CRC code for<br>
an error check is added thereto at every predetermined<br>
block. Furthermore, the second layer code string is input<br>
to the CRC code addition section 103 where a CRC code<br>
for an error check is added thereto at every predetermined<br>
block. The first layer code string and the second layer<br>
code string with CRC codes added are input to the layered<br>
modulation section 104.<br>
The layered modulation section 104 modulates the<br>
first layer code string and the second layer code string<br>
into symbols by using a multi-value modulation scheme.<br>
In this case, as described above, by taking advantage<br>
of the fact that the error rate of eachbit varies depending<br>
on the position of the bit in the symbol subjected to<br>
multi-value modulation, modulation is performed in such<br>
a way that the error rates differ hierarchically between<br>
the first layer code string and the second layer code<br>
string. Here, suppose 16QAM is used as the multi-value<br>
modulation scheme. That is, since the first layer code<br>
string is a minimum necessary code string to obtain decoded<br>
data through decoding at the mobile station, in other<br>
words, a code string of greater importance than the second<br>
layer code string, a smaller error rate than the second<br>
layer code string is preferred to be. On the contrary,<br>
since the second layer code string is a code string<br>
necessary to obtain decoded data of high quality by<br>
decoding at the mobile station, in other words, it is<br>
an additional code string which is not always necessary<br>
to obtain decoded data, even if it has a larger error<br>
rate than the first layer code string and is thereby lost,<br>
it is still possible to obtain decoded data of minimum<br>
quality. Therefore, the layered modulation section 104<br>
performs modulation by assigning the respective bits of<br>
the first layer code string to the higher 2 bits b1 and<br>
b2 in FIG. 1 and assigning the respective bits of the second<br>
layer code string to the lower 2 bits b3 and b4 in FIG.l.<br>
Thus, the error rate of the first layer code string is<br>
smaller than the error rate of the second layer code string.<br>
That is, modulation is performed in such a way that the<br>
error rates differ hierarchically between the first layer<br>
code string and the second layer code string.<br>
The modulated symbol is subjected to radio<br>
processing such as up-conversion at the radio section<br>
105 and then transmitted to a plurality of mobile stations<br>
simultaneously through the antenna 106 . That is, an MBMS<br>
is performed from the base station to a plurality of mobile<br>
stations. Since one symbol includes both the first layer<br>
code string and the second layer code string, the transmit<br>
power of the first layer code string is equal to the<br>
transmit power of the second layer code string.<br>
FIG.4 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 1 of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The mobile station shown in FIG.4 is constructed<br>
of an antenna 201, a radio section 202, a demodulation<br>
section 203, a separation sect ion 204 , an error inspection<br>
section 205, an error inspection section 206 and a layered<br>
decoding section 207.<br>
The radio section 202 applies radio processing such<br>
as down-conversion to a symbol received through the<br>
antenna 201 and inputs the received symbol to the<br>
demodulation section 203.<br>
The demodulation section 203 demodulates the<br>
received symbol using a 16QAM demodulation scheme. The<br>
demodulated symbol is input to the separation section<br>
204 .<br>
Since each symbol demodulated by the demodulation<br>
section 203 consists of 4 bits, the separation section<br>
204 separates the 4 bits into higher two bits b1 and b2<br>
and lower two bits b3 and b4 . Since the first layer code<br>
string is assigned to the higher two bits and a second<br>
layer code string is assigned to the lower two bits, the<br>
4 bits are separated into the first layer code string<br>
and the second layer code string through this separation.<br>
The first layer code string is input to the error inspection<br>
section 205 and the second layer code string is input<br>
to the error inspection section 206.<br>
The error inspection section 205 carries out a CRC<br>
at every predetermined block to check whether the first<br>
layer code string contains some error or not. If there<br>
is some error, the code string included in the block is<br>
discarded. On the other hand, if there is no error, the<br>
code string included in the block is input to the layered<br>
decoding section 207.<br>
The error inspection section 206 carries out a CRC<br>
at every predetermined block to check whether the second<br>
layer code string contains some error or not. If there<br>
is some error, the code string included in the block is<br>
discarded. On the other hand, if there is no error, the<br>
code string included in the block is input to the layered<br>
decoding section 207 .<br>
When there are no errors in both the first layer<br>
code string and the second layer code string, both the<br>
first layer code string and the second layer code string<br>
are input to the layered decoding section 207, and<br>
therefore the layered decoding section 207 performs<br>
decoding using both the first layer code string and the<br>
second layer code string. Thus, in this case, decoded<br>
data of 64 kbps is obtained. Furthermore, when there is<br>
no error in the first layer code string but there is some<br>
error in the second layer code string, only the first<br>
layer code string is input, and therefore decoding is<br>
performed using only the first layer code string. In this<br>
case, decoded data of 32 kbps is obtained.<br>
Since the bit positions in the symbol of the first<br>
layer code string and the second layer code string are<br>
as shown above, no case where there is some error in the<br>
first layer code string and there is no error in the second<br>
layer code string normally occurs. Even if such a case<br>
occurs, since the second layer code string is an additional<br>
code string for the first layer code string, decoded data<br>
cannot be obtained by the second layer code string alone.<br>
Furthermore, when both the first layer code string and<br>
the second layer code string have errors, of course no<br>
decoded data is obtained.<br>
Here, as shown in FIG. 5, suppose an MBMS is carried<br>
out when the mobile station #1 (MS#1) is located near<br>
the base station (BS) and the mobile station #2 (MS#2)<br>
is located on the cell boundary. As described above, the<br>
base station sends the first layer code string and the<br>
second layer code string having different error rates<br>
to the mobile station #1 and mobile station #2 with the<br>
same transmit power at the same time. Since the second<br>
layer code string has a poorer error rate characteristic<br>
than the first layer code string, even if the mobile station<br>
#1 and mobile station #2 receive the same symbol, the<br>
mobile station #1 which has a shorter distance from the<br>
base station is likely to receive both the first layer<br>
code string and the second layer code string without errors,<br>
whereas the mobile station #2 which has a greater distance<br>
from the base station is likely to receive the first layer<br>
code string without errors but second layer code string<br>
with errors. Therefore, while the mobile station #1 can<br>
receive data of 64 kbps, the mobile station #2 can receive<br>
data of 32 kbps which is a minimum guaranteed transmission<br>
data in the MBMS. Furthermore, the reception quality at<br>
the mobile station #1 is higher than the reception quality<br>
at the mobile station #2.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, a plurality o f code strings<br>
coded by being divided into a plurality of layers is<br>
modulated in such a way that the error rates differ<br>
hierarchically among the plurality of code strings, and<br>
therefore even when a symbol of the same content is sent<br>
to a plurality of mobile stations as with an MBMS, it<br>
is possible to differentiate the transmission rate and<br>
reception quality hierarchically according to the<br>
distance from the base station . Therefore, itispossible<br>
to provide services at a high transmission rate and of<br>
high quality to a mobile station located near the base<br>
station on one hand, and provide services at a low<br>
transmission rate and of low quality to a mobile station<br>
located on the cell boundary with a minimum transmission<br>
rate and minimum quality guaranteed on the other. That<br>
is, in an MBMS, this embodiment can provide services with<br>
transmission rates and reception quality divided<br>
hierarchically.<br>
In this embodiment, the base station carries out<br>
layered coding which encodes data divided into two layers.<br>
However, this layered coding may also be performed by<br>
a radio channel control station apparatus which is<br>
connected to the base station or a contents server which<br>
is connected to the radio channel control station<br>
apparatus. In this case, the first layer code string and<br>
the second layer code string are output in parallel from<br>
the radio channel control station apparatus or the<br>
contents server.<br>
Furthermore, this embodiment carries out layered<br>
coding in two layers, but layered coding is not limited<br>
to two layers and all that is required is that there is<br>
at least a plurality of layers. For example, when coding<br>
is carried out in three layers, it is possible to use<br>
64QAM as the modulation scheme and modulate a plurality<br>
of code strings coded by being divided into three layers<br>
in such a way that the error rates differ hierarchically<br>
among the plurality of code strings as with the case<br>
described above.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Excessively high transmit power of a symbol sent<br>
from a base station may cause interference with other<br>
cells or prevent resources from being assigned to other<br>
channels. On the contrary, excessively small transmit<br>
power may prevent symbols from reaching a mobile station<br>
located on a cell boundary. This makes it impossible to<br>
provide a minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed of<br>
32 kbps to the mobile station located on the cell boundary.<br>
Therefore, this embodiment performs appropriate transmit<br>
power control in an MBMS as follows.<br>
FIG.6 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 2 of thepresent<br>
invention. Furthermore, FIG . 7 is a block diagram showing<br>
a configuration of a base station according to Embodiment<br>
2 of the present invention. However, explanations of the<br>
same parts as those of the configuration in the foregoing<br>
embodiment will be omitted.<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.6, a CIR measuring<br>
section 2 08 measures a CIR (Carrier to Interference Ratio)<br>
as reception quality of a received symbol and inputs the<br>
value to a notification signal generation section 209.<br>
The notification signal generation section 209 generates<br>
a signal for notifying the measured CIR and inputs the<br>
signal to a radio section 202. There, the notification<br>
signal is subjected to radio processing such as<br>
up-conversion at the radio section 202 and transmitted<br>
to a base station through an antenna 201.<br>
Since the base station sends the same symbol to a<br>
plurality of mobile stations, the base station shown in<br>
FIG.7 receives notification signals from a plurality of<br>
mobile stations. In FIG.7, a notification signal<br>
received through an antenna 106 is subjected to radio<br>
processing such as down-conversion at a radio section<br>
105 and then input to a ranking section 107.<br>
The ranking section 107 ranks CIRs notified from<br>
a plurality of mobile stations and selects a minimum CIR.<br>
The selected minimum CIR is input to a transmit power<br>
decision section 108. The transmit power decision<br>
section 108 decides transmit power of the symbol based<br>
on a difference between the minimum CIR and the CIR<br>
corresponding to the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed (here 32 kbps) out of a plurality of<br>
transmission rates (here 64 kbps and 32 kbps) provided<br>
for the mobile station. A specific example thereof will<br>
be shown below.<br>
For example, suppose the base station receives<br>
notification signals from three mobile stations and<br>
obtains a result of CIR ranking as shown in FIG.8. In<br>
this case, the ranking section 107 selects 3 dB as the<br>
minimum CIR. In FIG.8, CIR lowers in order of mobile<br>
station #1, mobile station #2 and mobile station #3, and<br>
therefore the distance of each mobile station from the<br>
base station is estimated to increase in this order. The<br>
mobile station #3 in particular is estimated to be located<br>
on the cell boundary with a high probability.<br>
Now, suppose the CIR to obtain a minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps is 2 dB. Then, 3dB as<br>
the minimum CIR selected by the ranking section 107 exceeds<br>
the CIR necessary to obtain the transmission rate of 32<br>
kbps by 1 dB. Thus, in this case, the transmit power<br>
decision section 108 decides to reduce the transmit power<br>
of the symbol by 1 dB and instructs it to a transmit power<br>
control section 109. Following the instruction from the<br>
transmit power decision section 108, the transmit power<br>
control section 109 decreases the transmit power of the<br>
demodulated symbol from the current level by 1 dB.<br>
On the other hand, when the minimum CIR selected<br>
by the ranking section 107 is for example, 1 dB, the minimum<br>
CIR falls short of the CIR necessary to obtain the<br>
transmission rate of 32 kbps by 1 dB . Thus, in this case,<br>
the transmit power decision section 108 decides to<br>
increase the transmit power of the symbol by 1 dB and<br>
instructs it to the transmit power control section 109.<br>
Following the instruction from the transmit power<br>
decision section 108, the transmit power control section<br>
109 increases the transmit power of the demodulated symbol<br>
from the current level by 1 dB.<br>
By performing such transmit power control, at the<br>
mobile station #3 which is estimated to be farthest from<br>
the base station, the CIR of the received symbol becomes<br>
1 dB and decoded data is obtained at the minimum<br>
transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps.<br>
Furthermore , using the minimum CIRout of the CIRs measured<br>
by a plurality of mobile stations as a reference, the<br>
base station controls transmit power in such a way that<br>
the mobile station #3 which has notified the minimum CIR<br>
has an optimum CIR to obtain the minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed, and therefore even if the transmit<br>
power has been reduced, the mobile station #1 and mobile<br>
station #2 which are estimated to be located closer to<br>
the base station than the mobile station #3 can always<br>
obtain transmission rates equal to or greater than the<br>
minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed.<br>
As shown above, this embodiment performs transmit<br>
power control in such a way that the minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed can be maintained at a mobile station<br>
having the lowest reception CIR, and therefore it is<br>
possible to provide transmission rates equal to or greater<br>
than the minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed to<br>
all mobile stations in an MBMS and realize appropriate<br>
transmit power control with excessive transmit power<br>
reduced.<br>
In this embodiment, a CIR is used as reception<br>
quality, but the reception quality is not limited to the<br>
CIR and reception power or an SIR (Signal to Interference<br>
Ratio) can also be used. This will also apply to the<br>
following embodiments likewise.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
In this embodiment, a mobile station notifies a base<br>
station of a difference between a CIR of a received symbol<br>
and a CIR to obtain a minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed out of a plurality of transmission rates<br>
provided for the mobile station.<br>
FIG.9 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 3 of the present<br>
invention. However, detailed explanations of the same<br>
parts as those in the foregoing embodiment will be omitted .<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.9, a CIR measuring<br>
section 208 measures a CIR as reception quality of a<br>
received symbol and inputs the value to a gap calculation<br>
section 210. The gap calculation section 210 calculates<br>
a difference between the CIR measured by the CIR measuring<br>
section 208 and a CIR to obtain a minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps and inputs the value<br>
of the CIR difference to a notification signal generation<br>
section 209. The notification signal generation section<br>
20 9 generates a signal to notify the difference calculated<br>
by the gap calculation section 210 and inputs it to a<br>
radio section 202. The notification signal is subjected<br>
to radio processing such as up-conversion by the radio<br>
section 202 and sent to a base station through an antenna<br>
201.<br>
The configuration of the base station according to<br>
this embodiment is the same as the configuration shown<br>
in FIG.7 above. However, the operations of a ranking<br>
section 107 and transmit power decision section 108 are<br>
different from those in the above described embodiment.<br>
The base station according to this embodiment will be<br>
explained below.<br>
Since the base station sends the same symbol to a<br>
plurality of mobile stations, the base station shown in<br>
FIG.7 receives notification signals from a plurality of<br>
mobile stations. In FIG.7, a notification signal<br>
received through an antenna 106 is subjected to radio<br>
processing such as down-conversion at a radio section<br>
105 and then input to a ranking section 107.<br>
The ranking section 107 ranks CIR differences<br>
notified from a plurality of mobile stations and selects<br>
a value whose absolute value is largest out of differences<br>
having minus values (that is, when a CIR of a received<br>
symbol is lower than a CIR to obtain a minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps). When there are no<br>
differences having minus values, the ranking section 107<br>
selects a value whose absolute value is largest out of<br>
differences having plus values (that is, when a CIR of<br>
a received symbol is higher than a CIR to obtain a minimum<br>
transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps). The<br>
selected value is input to a transmit power decision<br>
section 108. The transmit power decision section 108<br>
decides transmit power of the symbol based on the value<br>
of the difference input from the ranking section 107.<br>
A specific example thereof will be shown below.<br>
For example, suppose the base station receives<br>
notification signals from three mobile stations and<br>
obtains a result of ranking of CIR difference as shown<br>
in FIG.10. Thatis, this is a case where the mobile station<br>
#1 obtains a transmission rate equal to or higher than<br>
the minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps,<br>
whereas the mobile station #2 and mobile station #3 cannot<br>
obtain the minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed<br>
of 32 kbps. In FIG.10, the ranking section 107 selects<br>
-3 dB and inputs it to the transmit power decision section<br>
108. At the mobile station #3 having a CIR difference<br>
of -3 dB, the CIR of the received symbol falls short of<br>
the CIR to obtain a transmission rate of 32 kbps by 3<br>
dB . Therefore, in this case, the transmit power decision<br>
section 108 decides to increase the transmit power of<br>
the symbol by 3 dB and instructs the transmit power control<br>
section 109 to do so. Following the instruction from the<br>
transmit power decision section 108, the transmit power<br>
control section 109 increases the transmit power of the<br>
modulated symbol from the current level by 3 dB.<br>
On the other hand, suppose the base station receives<br>
notification signals from three mobile stations and the<br>
result of ranking of CIR differences is as shown in FIG. 11 .<br>
That is, this is a case where all the mobile stations<br>
can obtain transmission rates equal to or greater than<br>
the minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps .<br>
In the case of FIG.11, the ranking section 107 selects<br>
+ 2 dB and inputs it to the transmit power decision section<br>
108. At the mobile station #3 having a CIR difference<br>
of +2 dB, the CIR of the received symbol exceeds the CIR<br>
to obtain the transmission rate of 32 kbps by 2 dB . Thus,<br>
in this case, the transmit power decision section 108<br>
decides to decrease the transmit power of the symbol by<br>
2 dB and instructs the transmit power control section<br>
109 to do so. Following the instruction from the transmit<br>
power decision section 108, the transmit power control<br>
section 109 decreases the transmit power of the modulated<br>
symbol from the current level by 2 dB.<br>
Through such transmit power control, the CIR of the<br>
received symbols at all the mobile stations become equal<br>
to or greater than the CIR to obtain the minimum<br>
transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps . When all<br>
the mobile stations obtain transmission rates equal to<br>
or greater than the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed of 32 kbps and decrease transmit power, the<br>
base station decreases the transmit power by an amount<br>
corresponding to the least value out of the CIR differences<br>
(all plus values) notified from the plurality of mobile<br>
stations, and therefore all the mobile stations can obtain<br>
the minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps<br>
in this case, too.<br>
Thus, as with Embodiment 2 , this embodiment per forms<br>
transmit power control so that the minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed can be maintained at the mobile<br>
station having the lowest reception CIR, and can thereby<br>
provide transmission rates equal to or greater than the<br>
minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed at all the<br>
mobile stations in an MBMS and also perform appropriate<br>
transmit power control with excessive transmit power<br>
reduced.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
The base station according to Embodiment 2 performs<br>
transmit power control using a CIR to obtain a minimum<br>
transmiss ion rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps as a reference.<br>
That is, when the CIR notified from a mobile station exceeds<br>
a CIR to obtain a transmission rate of 32 kbps, the base<br>
station reduces transmit power, and on the contrary when<br>
the CIR notified from the mobile station falls short of<br>
the CIR to obtain the transmission rate of 32 kbps (that<br>
is, when the mobile station cannot obtain decoded data),<br>
the base station increases transmit power. Thus, the<br>
former requires notification from the mobile station<br>
carrying out decoding at the transmission rate of 32 kbps<br>
and the latter requires notification from the mobile<br>
station that cannot obtain decoded data. In other words,<br>
there is no need for notification from the mobile station<br>
carrying out decoding at a higher transmission rate (here<br>
64 kbps) than the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed of 32 kbps and transmission of a communication<br>
signal from such a mobile station results in useless<br>
transmission.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, only the mobile station<br>
carrying out decoding at a transmission rate equal to<br>
or lower than a minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed<br>
out of a plurality of transmission rates provided for<br>
mobile stations notifies the reception CIR to the base<br>
station.<br>
FIG.12 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 4 of thepresent<br>
invention. However, detailed explanations of the same<br>
parts as those in the configuration in the foregoing<br>
embodiment will be omitted. The configuration of a base<br>
station which receives the notification signal sent from<br>
the mobile station according to this embodiment is the<br>
same as that of Embodiment 2, and therefore the<br>
explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.12, an error<br>
inspection section 205 inputs an error detection result<br>
of a first layer code string to a transmission rate decision<br>
section 211. On the other hand, an error inspection<br>
section 206 inputs an error inspection result of a second<br>
layer code string to the transmission rate decision<br>
section 211. The transmission rate decision section 211<br>
decides the transmission rate of the decoded data based<br>
on the error inspection result. When the transmission<br>
rate is equal to or lower than a minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed (here 32 kbps) out of a plurality<br>
of transmission rates (here 64 kbps and 32 kbps) provided<br>
for the mobile station, the transmission rate decision<br>
section 211 instructs a notification signal generation<br>
section 209 to send a notification signal (signal to notify<br>
a CIR measured by a CIR measuring section 208). The<br>
notification signal generation section 209 sends the<br>
notification signal to the base station only when a<br>
transmission instruction is received from the<br>
transmission rate decision section 211.<br>
Then, a method of deciding a transmission rate will<br>
be explained. As shown above, when there is no error in<br>
both the first layer code string and the second layer<br>
code string, a layered decoding section 207 performs<br>
decoding using both the first layer code string and the<br>
second layer code string. Thus, in this case, decoded<br>
data of 64 kbps is obtained. Therefore, when there is<br>
no error in both the first layer code string and the second<br>
layer code string, the transmission rate decision section<br>
211 does not instruct the notification signal generation<br>
section 209 to send any notification signal.<br>
Furthermore, when the first layer code string has<br>
no error and the second layer code string has some error,<br>
the layered decoding section 207 performs decoding using<br>
only the first layer code string. Thus, in this case,<br>
decoded data of 32 kbps is obtained. Therefore, when the<br>
first layer code string has no errors and the second layer<br>
code string has some error, the transmission rate decision<br>
section 211 instructs the notification signal generation<br>
section 209 to send a notification signal.<br>
Furthermore, when the first layer code string has<br>
some error and the second layer code string has no error,<br>
the layered decoding section 207 cannot obtain decoded<br>
data through the second layer code string alone. That<br>
is, the transmission rate becomes 0 kbps. Thus, when the<br>
first layer code string has some error and the second<br>
layer code string has no error, the transmission rate<br>
decision section 211 instructs the notification signal<br>
generation section 209 to send a notification signal.<br>
Furthermore, when both the first layer code string<br>
and the second layer code string have errors, the layered<br>
decoding section 207 cannot obtain decoded data through<br>
the second layer code string alone. That is, the<br>
transmission rate becomes 0 kbps. Therefore, when both<br>
the first layer code string and the second layer code<br>
string have errors, the transmission rate decision<br>
section 211 instructs the notification signal generation<br>
section 209 to send a notification signal.<br>
By carrying out transmission control over a<br>
notification signal, the base station according to<br>
Embodiment 2 performs transmit power control based on<br>
the CIR notified from a mobile station carrying out<br>
decoding at or below a minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed.<br>
Thus, this embodiment prevents transmission of<br>
useless notification signals from the mobile station,<br>
and can thereby increase the available channel capacity<br>
on the uplink (channel from the mobile station to the<br>
base station). Furthermore, compared to Embodiment 2,<br>
the number of CIRs to be ranked is decreased, and therefore<br>
the base station can reduce the amount of processing and<br>
time required for ranking processing and improve<br>
trackability of transmit power control as a consequence.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
For the same reason as that explained in Embodiment<br>
4 , Embodiment 3 needs no notification from a mobile station<br>
carrying out decoding at a transmission rate higher than<br>
a minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps,<br>
transmission of a communication signal from such a mobile<br>
station becomes useless transmission.<br>
Therefore, in this embodiment, only a mobile station<br>
carrying out decoding at a transmission rate equal to<br>
or lower than a minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed<br>
out of a plurality of transmission rates provided for<br>
the mobile station notifies a base station of a difference<br>
between a reception CIR and reception quality to obtain<br>
the minimum transmission rate to be guaranteed.<br>
FIG.13 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 5of thepresent<br>
invention. However, detailed explanations of the same<br>
parts as those in the configuration of the above described<br>
embodiment will be omitted. The configuration of the base<br>
station which receives a notification signal sent from<br>
the mobile station according to this embodiment is the<br>
same as that of Embodiment 3, and therefore explanations<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.13, an error<br>
inspection section 205 inputs an error inspection result<br>
of a first layer code string to a transmission rate decision<br>
section 211. On the other hand, an error inspection<br>
section 206 inputs an error inspection result of a second<br>
layer code string to the transmission rate decision<br>
section 211. The transmission rate decision section 211<br>
decides a transmission rate of the decoded data based<br>
on these error inspection results . When the transmission<br>
rate is equal to or lower than a minimum transmission<br>
rate to be guaranteed (here 32 kbps) out of a plurality<br>
of transmission rates (here 64 kbps and 32 kbps) provided<br>
for the mobile station, the transmission rate decision<br>
section 211 instructs a notification signal generation<br>
section 209 to send a notification signal ( signal to notify<br>
a difference calculated by a gap calculation section 210) .<br>
The notification signal generation section 209 sends a<br>
notification signal to the base station only when a<br>
transmission instruction is received from the<br>
transmission rate decision section 211. The method of<br>
deciding a transmission rate is the same as that in<br>
Embodiment 4, and therefore explanations thereof will<br>
be omitted.<br>
When transmission control over the notification<br>
signal is performed in this way, the base station according<br>
to Embodiment 3 performs transmit power control based<br>
on the CIR difference notified from the mobile station<br>
carrying out decoding at a transmission rate equal to<br>
or lower than the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed.<br>
Thus, this embodiment prevents transmission of<br>
useless notification signals from the mobile station,<br>
and can thereby increase the available channel capacity<br>
on the uplink. Furthermore, compared to Embodiment 3,<br>
the number of CIRs to be ranked decreases at the base<br>
station, and therefore it is possible to reduce the amount<br>
of processing and time required for ranking processing.<br>
As a result, it is possible to improve trackability of<br>
transmit power control.<br>
(Embodiment 6)<br>
In this embodiment, a base station performs transmit<br>
power control according to instructions of<br>
increase/decrease from a mobile station.<br>
FIG.14 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 6of thepresent<br>
invention. Furthermore, FIG.15 is a block diagram<br>
showing a configuration of a base station according to<br>
Embodiment 6 of the present invention. However, detailed<br>
explanations of the same parts as those in the<br>
configuration of the above described embodiment will be<br>
omitted.<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.14, a CIR<br>
measuring section 208 measures a CIR as reception quality<br>
of a received symbol and inputs the value to a TPC<br>
generation section 212. Furthermore, when the<br>
transmission rate is equal to or lower than a minimum<br>
transmission rate to be guaranteed (here 32 kbps) out<br>
of a plurality of transmission rates (here 64 kbps and<br>
32 kbps) provided for the mobile station, the transmission<br>
rate decision section 211 instructs the TPC generation<br>
section 212 to generate and transmit a TPC (Transmission<br>
Power Control) signal. The method of deciding a<br>
transmission rate is the same as that in Embodiment 4.<br>
The TPC generation section 212 generates a TPC signal<br>
and sends it to the base station only when an instruction<br>
is received from the transmission rate decision section<br>
211. The TPC signal is generated as follows.<br>
That is, when the CIR measured by the CIR measuring<br>
section 208 falls short of the CIR to obtain the minimum<br>
transmission rate to be guaranteed of 32 kbps, the TPC<br>
generation section 212 generates a TPC signal for<br>
instructing an increase of transmit power and sends it<br>
to the base station. On the other hand, when the CIR<br>
measured by the CIR measuring section 208 exceeds the<br>
CIR to obtain the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed of 32 kbps, the TPC generation section 212<br>
generates a TPC signal for instructing a decrease of<br>
transmit power and sends it to the base station. However,<br>
a TPC signal is generated and sent only when an instruction<br>
is received from the transmission rate decision section<br>
211. That is, only when the transmission rate is equal<br>
to or lower than the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed (here 32 kbps) out of a plurality of<br>
transmission rates (here 64 kbps and 32 kbps) provided<br>
for the mobile station. This is for the same reason as<br>
that described in Embodiment 4.<br>
Since the base station sends the same symbol to a<br>
plurality of mobile stations, the base station shown in<br>
FIG.15 receives TPC signals from a plurality of mobile<br>
stations. In FIG.15, a TPC signal received through an<br>
antenna 106 is subjected to radio processing such as<br>
down-conversion at a radio section 105 and input to a<br>
TPC decision section 110.<br>
The TPC decision section 110 decides the content of<br>
an instruction indicated by the TPC signal, that is,<br>
decides whether the instruction is for an increase of<br>
transmit power or a decrease of transmit power. Then,<br>
when at least one of a plurality of instructions is an<br>
instruction for an increase of transmit power, the TPC<br>
decision section 110 instructs a transmit power control<br>
section 108 to increase transmit power. On the other hand,<br>
when all of the plurality of instructions are instructions<br>
for decreasing transmit power, the TPC decision section<br>
110 instructs the transmit power control section 108 to<br>
decrease transmit power. The transmit power control<br>
section 109 increases or decreases the transmit power<br>
of a symbol according to instructions from the TPC decision<br>
section 110 by specified quantity.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, only a mobile<br>
station carrying out decoding at a transmission rate equal<br>
to or lower than the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed out of a plurality of transmission rates<br>
provided for the mobile station instructs the base station<br>
to increase or decrease transmit power, and therefore<br>
it is possible to provide transmission rates equal to<br>
or higher than the minimum transmission rate to be<br>
guaranteed to all mobile stations in an MBMS and perform<br>
appropriate transmit power control with excessive<br>
transmit power reduced. Furthermore, this embodiment<br>
prevents transmission of useless TPC signals from mobile<br>
stations, and can thereby increase a channel capacity<br>
available on the uplink.<br>
(Embodiment 7)<br>
In this embodiment, a mobile station notifies a base<br>
station of a difference between a CIR of a received symbol<br>
and a CIR to obtain a transmission rate requested by the<br>
own station out of a plurality of transmission rates<br>
provided for the mobile station.<br>
FIG.16 is block diagram showing a configuration of<br>
a mobile station according to Embodiment 7 of the present<br>
invention. However, detailed explanations of the same<br>
parts as those in the configuration of the above described<br>
embodiment will be omitted.<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.16, a CIR<br>
measuring section 208 measures a CIR as reception quality<br>
of a received symbol and inputs the value to a gap<br>
calculation section 210. A transmission rate requesting<br>
section 213 inputs the value of a transmission rate<br>
requested by the own station to the gap calculation section<br>
210. The transmission rate requested by the own station<br>
may be set by a mobile station user or set according to<br>
the content of decoded data and the setting method is<br>
not particularly limited. For example, when the decoded<br>
data is fast-moving image data, a high transmission rate<br>
is required and a relatively high transmission rate among<br>
a plurality of transmission rates provided for the mobile<br>
station is set. The gap calculation section 210<br>
calculates a difference between the CIR measured by the<br>
CIR measuring section 208 and the CIR to obtain the<br>
transmission rate requested by the own station and inputs<br>
the value of the CIR difference to a notification signal<br>
generation section 209. The notification signal<br>
generation section 209 generates a signal to notify the<br>
difference calculated by the gap calculation section 210<br>
and inputs it to a radio section 202. The notification<br>
signal is subjected to radio processing such as<br>
up-conversion at the radio section 202 and sent to the<br>
base station through an antenna 201.<br>
The configuration of the base station according to<br>
this embodiment is the same as the configuration shown<br>
in FIG.7 above. However, the operation of the ranking<br>
section 107 differs from that of the above described<br>
embodiment. The base station according to this<br>
embodiment will be explained below.<br>
Since the base station sends the same symbol to a<br>
plurality of mobile stations, the base station shown in<br>
FIG.7 receives notification signals from a plurality of<br>
mobile stations. In FIG.7, a notification signal<br>
received through an antenna 106 is subjected to radio<br>
processing such as down-conversion at a radio section<br>
105 and then input to a ranking section 107.<br>
The ranking section 107 ranks CIR differences<br>
notified from a plurality of mobile stations and selects<br>
a value whose absolute value is largest out of differences<br>
having minus values (that is, when the CIR of a received<br>
symbol is lower than the CIR to obtain the transmission<br>
rate requested by the mobile station) . When there is no<br>
difference having a minus value, the ranking section 107<br>
selects a value whose absolute value is least out of<br>
differences having plus values (that is, when the CIR<br>
of a received symbol is higher than the CIR to obtain<br>
the transmission rate requested by the mobile station).<br>
The selected value is input to a transmit power decision<br>
section 108. The transmit power decision section 108<br>
decides the transmit power of the symbol based on the<br>
value of the difference input from the ranking section<br>
107. A specific example thereof will be shown below.<br>
For example, suppose the base station receives<br>
notification signals from three mobile stations and<br>
obtains a result of ranking of CIR difference as shown<br>
in FIG.10. That is, a case where a mobile station #1 can<br>
obtain a transmission rate equal to or higher than the<br>
transmission rate requested by the own station and mobile<br>
station #2 and mobile station #3 cannot obtain the<br>
transmission rates requestedby the own stations. In the<br>
case of FIG.10 above, the ranking section 107 selects<br>
-3 dB and inputs it to the transmit power decision section<br>
108. At the mobile station #3 having a CIR difference<br>
of -3 dB, the CIR of a received symbol falls short of<br>
the CIR to obtain the transmission rate requested by the<br>
own station by 3 dB. Thus, in this case, the transmit<br>
power decision section 108 decides to increase the<br>
transmit power of the symbol by 3 dB and instructs a<br>
transmit power control section 109 to do so . The transmit<br>
power control section 109 increases the transmit power<br>
of the modulated symbol by 3 dB from the current transmit<br>
power according to the instruction from the transmit power<br>
decision section 108.<br>
On the other hand, suppose the base station receives<br>
notification signals from three mobile stations and<br>
obtains a result of ranking of CIR differences as shown<br>
in FIG.11 above. That is, it is a case where all mobile<br>
stations obtain transmission rates equal to or higher<br>
than the transmission rates requested by the own stations .<br>
In the case of FIG.11 above, the ranking section 107 selects<br>
+2 dB and inputs it to the transmit power decision section<br>
108. At the mobile station #3 having a CIR difference<br>
of +2 dB, the CIR of the received symbol exceeds the CIR<br>
to obtain the transmission rate requested by the own<br>
station by 2 dB. Thus, in this case, the transmit power<br>
decision section 108 decides to decrease the transmit<br>
power of the symbol by 2 dB and instructs the transmit<br>
power control section 109 to do so. The transmit power<br>
control section 109 decreases the transmit power of the<br>
modulated symbol from the current transmit power by 2<br>
dB according to the instruction from the transmit power<br>
decision section 108.<br>
By carrying out such transmit power control, the<br>
CIRs of the received symbol at all mobile stations become<br>
equal to or higher than the CIRs to obtain the transmission<br>
rates requested by the own stations. When transmission<br>
rates equal to or higher than the transmission rates<br>
requested by all the mobile stations are obtained and<br>
transmit power is decreased, the base station decreases<br>
transmit power by an amount corresponding to the least<br>
value of CIR differences (all plus values) notified from<br>
the plurality of mobile stations, and therefore even in<br>
this case, it is possible to obtain transmission rates<br>
equal to or higher than the transmission rates requested<br>
by the own stations of all the mobile stations.<br>
Thus, this embodiment performs transmit power<br>
control so that transmission rates requested by mobile<br>
stations can be maintained, and can thereby provide<br>
transmission rates equal to or higher than transmission<br>
rates requested by the mobile stations to all the mobile<br>
stations and perform appropriate transmit power control<br>
with excessive transmit power reduced in an MBMS .<br>
(Embodiment 8)<br>
In this embodiment, a mobile station instructs a<br>
base station to increase/decrease transmit power based<br>
on a result of a comparison between a CIR of a received<br>
symbol and a CIR to obtain a transmission rate requested<br>
by the own station out of a plurality of transmission<br>
rates provided for the mobile station.<br>
FIG.17 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a mobile station according to Embodiment 8 of thepresent<br>
invention. However, detailed explanations of the same<br>
parts as those in the foregoing embodiment will be omitted.<br>
The configuration of a base station which receives a TPC<br>
signal sent from the mobile station according to this<br>
embodiment is the same as that of Embodiment 6, and<br>
therefore explanations thereof will be omitted.<br>
In the mobile station shown in FIG.17, a CIR<br>
measuring section 208 measures a CIR as reception quality<br>
of a received symbol and inputs the value to a TPC<br>
generation section 212. A transmission rate requesting<br>
section 213 inputs the value of a transmission rate<br>
requested by the own station to the TPC generation section<br>
212. The TPC generation section 212 generates a TPC<br>
signal and sends it to the base station. A TPC signal<br>
is generated as follows.<br>
That is, when the CIR measured by the CIR measuring<br>
section 208 is lower than the CIR to obtain the transmission<br>
rate requested by the own station, the TPC generation<br>
section 212 generates a TPC signal for instructing an<br>
increase of transmit power and sends it to the base station.<br>
On the other hand, when the CIR measured by the CIR<br>
measuring section 208 is equal to or higher than the CIR<br>
to obtain the transmission rate requested by the own<br>
station, the TPC generation section 212 generates a TPC<br>
signal for instructing a decrease of transmit power and<br>
sends it to the base station.<br>
Thus, according to this embodiment, the mobile<br>
station instructs an increase or decrease of transmit<br>
power based on a result of a comparison between a CIR<br>
of a received symbol and a CIR to obtain a transmission<br>
rate requested by the own station, and therefore it is<br>
possible to provide transmission rates equal to or higher<br>
than transmission rates requested by the mobile station<br>
to all the mobile stations in an MBMS and perform<br>
appropriate transmit power control with excessive<br>
transmit power reduced.<br>
As described above, the present invention can<br>
perform appropriate control on reception quality and<br>
transmit power for each mobile station in an MBMS.<br>
