THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"TAIL LAMP STRUCTURE FOR MOTORCYCLE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
signifying the presence of the motorcycle to a vehicle running behind the motorcycle, and a brake lamp that lights up for signifying, at the time of braking operation of the motorcycle, the on-state of braking to a vehicle behind the motorcycle are made to light up by using a common bulb provided in one lamp cover. [0003]<br>
Tail lamp structures for motorcycles of another type have been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 8-40329.  The tail lamp structures for motorcycles of this type are configured such that a tail lamp and a brake lamp are made to light up by using different bulbs, wherein the brake lamp is disposed on an upper portion of the tail lamp structure and the tail lamp is disposed under the brake lamp. [0004]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above two kinds of tail lamp structures, each of the tail lamp and the brake lamp is made to light up by using the bulb, and therefore, the size of the tail lamp structure becomes large.  This gives a limit to a design of a tail lamp and its neighborhood located at a rear end portion of a rear cowl.  Concretely, the enlargement of a tail lamp structure disposed inside a<br><br>
rear end portion of a rear cowl makes it difficult to realize a thin, light design of a tail lamp and its neighborhood located at the rear end portion of the rear cowl.  In particular, the above-described tail lamp structure of the type, in which the tail lamp and the brake lamp are made to light up by using different bulbs, tends to give a fairly large limitation to above design of the tail lamp and its neighborhood. [0005]<br>
To realize a tail lamp structure including a tail lamp and a brake lamp separately provided, wherein the thickness of each of the lamps in the vertical direction is made thin for miniaturizing the entire tail lamp structure, the present applicant has contrived to make each of a tail lamp and a brake lamp light up by using an array of a plurality of LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes).  The use of such LEDs is effective to make each of the tail lamp and the brake lamp thin and consequently compact, and to realize a thin, light design of a tail lamp and its neighborhood located at a rear end portion of a rear cowl. [0006]<br>
To further improve the above thin, light design of the tail lamp and its neighborhood, which lamp is made to<br><br>
light up by using the LEDs, the present applicant has contrived to form the rear end portion of the rear cowl into a shape whose lateral width becomes narrow as nearing to an upper end of the rear cowl.  In this case, however, if the brake lamp is disposed on an upper portion of the tail lamp structure and the tail lamp is disposed under the brake lamp in accordance with the same manner as the above-described related art manner, there may occur a new problem that a lighting area of the brake lamp disposed on the upper side becomes deficient. [0007]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a tail lamp structure for a motorcycle, which is capable of sufficiently ensuring a lighting area of a brake lamp even if the tail lamp structure is disposed inside a rear end portion of a rear cowl, which portion has a shape whose lateral width becomes narrow as nearing to an upper end of the rear cowl. [0008]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the object, according to the present invention, there is provided a tail lamp structure for a motorcycle, which is disposed inside a rear end portion of a rear cowl (for example, a rear cowl 13 to be<br><br>
described in an embodiment), the rear end portion having a shape whose lateral width becomes narrow as nearing to an upper end of the rear cowl, characterized in that a tail lamp (for example, a tail lamp portion 47 to be described in the embodiment)' is disposed on an upper portion of the tail lamp structure, and a brake lamp (for example, a brake lamp portion 48 to be described in the embodiment) is disposed under the tail lamp.<br>
[0009]<br>
With this configuration, since the tail lamp is disposed on an upper portion of the tail lamp structure and the brake lamp is disposed under the tail lamp, even if the tail lamp structure is disposed inside the rear end portion of the rear cowl, which portion has a shape whose lateral width becomes narrow as nearing to an upper end of the rear cowl, it is possible to ensure a sufficient lighting area of the brake lamp.<br>
[0010]<br>
