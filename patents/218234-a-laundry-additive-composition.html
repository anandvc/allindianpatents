				<td>This    is   the    divisional    Application    out    of   Indian    Patent    Application    No. IN/PC 172001/00254/DEL dated 29th March, 2001.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, in either liquid or granular form, for use in laundry applications, wherein the compositions comprise certain cyclic amine based polymer, oligomer or copolymer materials in combination with hydrophobically modified carboxy methyl cellulose. This combination imparts appearance and integrity benefits to fabncs and textiles laundered in washing solutions formed from such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, of course, well known that alternating cycles of using and laundenng fabncs and textiles, such as articles of worn clothing and apparel, will inevitably adversely affect the appearance and integrity of the fabnc and textile items so used and laundered. Fabrics and textiles simply wear out over time and with use. Laundering of fabncs and textiles is necessary to remove soils and stains which accumulate therein and thereon during ordinary use. However, the laundenng operation itself, over many cycles, can accentuate and contnbute to the deterioration of the integrity and the appearance of such fabncs and textiles.<br>
Detenoration of fabric integrity and appearance can manifest itself in several ways. Short fibers are dislodged from woven and knit fabric/textile structures by the mechanical action of laundenng. These dislodged fibers may form lint, fuzz or "pills" which are visible on the surface of fabncs and diminish the appearance of newness of the fabric. Further, repeated laundenng of fabncs and textiles, especially with bleach-containing laundry products, can remove dye from fabrics and textiles and impart a faded, worn out appearance as a result of diminished color intensity, and a, many ares as a result of changes in hues or shades of color.<br>
Given the foregoing, there is clearly an ongoing need to identify materials which could be added to laundry detergent products that would associate themselves with the fibers of the fabncs and tf.'xti'.es laundered using such detergent products and thereby reduce or minimize the tendency of the laundered fabric/textiles to deteriorate in appearance. Any such detergent product additive material should, of course, be able to benefit fabnc appearance and integrity without unduly interfering with the ability of the laundry detergent to perform its fabnc cleaning<br><br>
tiuncuon. The present invention is directed to the use of a mixture of certain cyclic amine basec polymer, oligomer or copolymer matenals and hydrophobically modified carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) in laundry applications that perform in this desired manner.<br>

Granular compositions, for example, are generally made by combining base granule ingredients, e.g., surfactants, builders, water, etc., as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual moisnire (5-12%). The remaining dry ingredients, e.g., granules of the essential mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers, can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules in a rotary mixing drum. The liquid ingredients, e.g., solutions of the essential mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers, enzymes, binders and perfumes, can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g'l. to such case the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisue concentrations.   Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in<br>
"compact i.orm", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Addition of the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers to liquid detergent or other aqueous compositions of this invention may be accomplished by simply mixing into the liquid solutions the desired mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomer's or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers.<br>

Contacting of fabrics with washinc solution will generally occur under conditions of agitation although the compositions of the present invention may also be used to form aqueous unagttated soaking solutions for fabric cleaning and treatment.<br>
Agitation is preferably provided in a washing machine for good cleaning. Washing is preferably followed by drying the wet fabnc in a conventional clothes dryer. An effective amount of a high density liquid or granular detergent composition in the aqueous wash solution m the washing machine is preferably from about 500 to about 7000 pprn, more preferably from about 1000 to about 3000 pprn.<br>

example of such as procedure is given below. This same procedure can be utilized with the other<br>
substituent  materials  described  herein  by  replacing   the   hexylchlonde  with  the  substituent<br>
matenal, or materials, of interest, for example, cetylchloride.  The amount of materil that should<br>
be added to the CMC making process to achieve the desired degree of substitution will be easily<br>
calculated by those skilled in the art in light of the following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Syinthesis of Hexylelher off CMC<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of a hydrophobically modified carboxymethyl cellulose and is representative of preparation of all of the cellulose ether derivatives of this cnyention.<br>
Cellulose (20 g), sodium hydroxide (10 g), water (30 g), and cthanol (150 g) are charged into a 500 ml glass reactor. The resulting alkali cellulose is stirred 45 minutes at 25°C. Then monochloroacetic acid (15 g) and hexylchonde (1 g) are added and the temperature raised over nine to 95°C and held at 95°C for 150 minutes. The reaction is cooled to 70°C, and then cooled to 25°C. Neutralization is accomplished by the addition of a sufficient amount of nitric acid/acetic acid to achieve a slurry pH of between 8 and 9. The slurry is filtered to obtain a hexylether of CMC.<br>
