Spheroidal cast alloy and method for producing cast parts from said spheroidal cast alloy<br>
The invention relates to a spheroidal cast alloy for cast iron products with great mechanical strength, high wear resistance and at the same time a high degree of ductility, comprising as non-iron constituents 2.5 to 3.8% by weight C, 2.4 to 3.4% by weight Si, 0.02 to 0.08% by weight P, 0.02 to 0.06% by weight Mg, 0.01 to 0.05% by weight Cr, 0.002 to 0.02% by weight Al, 0.0005 to 0.015% by weight S, 0.0002 to 0.002% by weight B and the conventional impurities.<br>
In motor vehicle construction, cast iron alloys are used for producing cast parts that must have high wear resistance, for example brake disks, which during the braking operation have to convert the kinetic energy of the vehicle into thermal energy. The brake disks can in this case reach temperatures of up to about 850째C. During the braking operation, not only the brake linings but also the brake disks are worn. Brake disks have irregular wear and often have to be replaced while still under warranty, involving high costs for the automobile manufacturer. In order that the wear on the surface of the brake disk takes place as evenly as possible, high demands are made of the crystalline structure and the homogeneity of the structure. The homogeneity can be improved by a suitable casting process.<br>
GB 832 666 discloses a cast iron alloy comprising as non-iron constituents 1.0 to 2.5% by weight C, 1.5 to 3.2% by weight Si, less than 1.15% by weight Mn, less than 0.5% by weight S and 0.001 to 0.05% by weight B. After casting, the graphite component takes on the compact form. Because the alloy does not contain any Mg there is no spheroidal graphite or vermicular graphite present, but rather a graphite formation that<br><br>
WO 2006/056334	PCT/EP2005/012160<br>
- 2 -<br>
resembles temper carbon nodes of malleable cast iron predominates. The alloy contains 5 to 10% carbides in a predominantly pearlitic matrix, which has the consequence that the elongation at rupture becomes relatively low. In order to limit the formation of lamellar graphite, and consequently improve the modulus of elasticity, tellurium and bismuth are admixed as alloying elements. Higher elongation at rupture values are achieved by a subsequent heat treatment.<br>
US 2004/0112479-A1 discloses a further cast iron alloy, which preferably contains 3.7% by weight C, 2.5% by weight Si, 1.85% by weight Ni, 0.85% by weight Cu and 0.05% by weight Mo. This material is distinguished by an elongation of 20 to 16% with a tensile strength of 500 to 900 MPa and by a Brinell hardness of 180 to 290 HB. These properties are achieved after a time-consuming heat treatment, which comprises the following successive steps: 10 to 360 minutes of austenitizing at temperatures between 750 and 790째C, rapid cooling in a salt bath at a temperature between 300 and 400째C, 1 to 3 hours of austempering at temperatures between 3 00 and 400째C and cooling to room temperature. After this treatment, the material has a structure with an austenitic and ferritic microstructure. The material is distinguished by easier machinability than a cast iron that has been subjected to a conventional type of austempering.<br>
On the basis of this prior art, the object of the invention is to provide a cast iron alloy which is produced from elements that are as inexpensive as possible, the cast parts having the highest or greatest possible heat resistance and strength, in particular wear resistance, and at the same time a very high degree of ductility, without an additional heat treatmen3t.<br><br>
WO 2006/056334	PCT/EP2005/012160<br>
- 3 -<br>
This object is achieved by a spheroidal cast alloy for cast iron products with great mechanical strength, high wear resistance and at the same time a high degree of ductility, comprising as non-iron constituents 2.5 to 3.8% by weight C, 2.4 to 3.4% by weight Si, 0.02 to 0.08% by weight P, 0.02 to 0.06% by weight Mg, 0.01 to 0.05% by weight Cr, 0.002 to 0.02% by weight Al, 0.0005 to 0.015% by weight S, 0.0002 to 0.002% by weight B and the conventional impurities, the alloy containing 3.0 to 3.7% by weight C, 2.6 to 3.4% by weight Si, 0.02 to 0.05% by weight P, 0.025 to 0.045% by weight Mg, 0.01 to 0.03% by weight Cr, 0.003 to 0.017% by weight Al, 0.0005 to 0.012% by weight S and 0.0004 to 0.002% by weight B.<br>
Preferred developments of the invention are provided by the dependent claims.<br>
It is of advantage that the alloy has the best possible strength-strain behavior. This is achieved by the spheroidal cast alloy containing 0.1 to 1.5% by weight Cu, preferably 0.5 to 0.8% by weight Cu. This is also achieved by the alloy containing 0.1 to 1.0% by weight Mn, preferably 0.15 to 0.2% by weight Mn.<br>
It is also of advantage that the alloy has the best possible wear behavior. This is achieved by the alloy containing 0.1 to 1.5% by weight Cu, preferably 0.5 to 0.8% by weight Cu and 0.1 to 1.0% by weight Mn, preferably 0.15 to 0.2% by weight Mn. This is also achieved by the alloy containing 0.1 to 1.5% by weight Mn, preferably 0.5 to 1.0% by weight Mn, and 0.05 to 1.0% by weight Cu, preferably 0.05 to 0.2% by weight Cu.<br>
The essential idea of the invention is to provide a cast iron alloy which has a Brinell hardness of over 22 0 and which is worn as evenly as possible when used<br><br>

as a brake disk. The graphite in the cast iron alloy may be of a spheroidal or vermicular, but not lamellar form. Although brake disks with lamellar graphite are inexpensive, they have lower resistance to temperature changes. As a result, so-called fire cracks can already occur after a short time in use, rapidly growing and leading to irregularities of the surface. An irregular surface in turn leads to irregular thermal loading, irregular wear and so-called brake juddering.<br>
Further applications of the spheroidal cast alloy according to the invention are axle and chassis parts for trucks and for passenger cars, such as for example wishbones, wheel carriers and pivot bearings, which are exposed to high mechanical and dynamic loads and in the case of a collision of the motor vehicle must plastically deform and must not rupture.<br>
Example 1<br>
A brake disk was produced from the spheroidal cast alloy according to the invention. The chemical composition was 3.34% by weight C, 2.92% by weight Si, 0.62% by weight Cu, 0.17% by weight Mn, 0.038% by weight Mg, 0.025% by weight P, 0.021% by weight Cr, 0.01% by weight Al, 0.001% by weight S and 0.0008% by weight B, the remainder Fe and the conventional impurities. The brake disk was investigated for the number of spherulites, graphite content, graphite form and graphite size, pearlite content and Brinell hardness. Specimens from the brake disk were subjected to a tensile test in order to establish the strength-strain behavior. The number of spherulites is 384 +/-76 spherulites per mm2. The graphite content is 9.7 +/- 0.7%. The graphite form in accordance with DIN EN ISO 945 is 97.9% of the form VI. The size distribution in accordance with DIN EN ISO 945 is 45% of size 8, 42% of size 7 and 13% of size 6. The pearlite content is<br><br>
WO 2006/056334	PCT/EP2005/012160<br>
- 5 -<br>
84 +/- 1%. The Brinell hardness is 248 +/- 3 HB. In the tensile test, the following values were established: yield strength Rp0.2 = 474 MPa, tensile strength Rm = 778 MPa, elongation at rupture A5 = 11.4% and modulus of elasticity E = 165 to 170 kN/mm2.<br>
In comparison with the known materials for brake disks, it was possible to establish a much better oxidation behavior (see Figure 1) and a greatly reduced tendency to fire cracking (see Figures 2 and 3) . The oxidation behavior, and consequently also the wear behavior, is greatly improved by the addition of a mixture of copper and/or manganese to the spheroidal cast alloy.<br>
In Figure 1, the weight increase in grams per square meter and per day caused by oxidation at 700째C in air is represented. The material according to the invention shows a weight increase of about 9 g/m2.d, in comparison with a cast iron material for conventional brake disks with a weight increase of about 21 g/m2.d.<br>
The tests to test for fire cracking were carried out as follows: a sample with the dimensions 40 x 20 x 7 mm is subjected to at least 100 cycles comprising 7 seconds of heating up to 700째C and 6 seconds of quenching in water. Subsequently, transverse sections are produced and examined under a microscope and photographed.<br>
Figure 2 shows a microphoto of a commercially available brake disk with a fire crack 0.4 mm deep. Figure 3 shows a further microphoto of the brake disk according to the invention, to the same magnification, with a fire crack 0.14 mm deep.<br>
Example 2<br>
A wishbone for passenger cars was produced from the spheroidal cast alloy according to the invention. The<br><br>
WO 2006/056334	PCT/EP2005/012160<br>
- 6 -<br>
chemical composition was 3.5% by weight C, 2.85% by weight Si, 0.63% by weight Cu, 0.18% by weight Mn, 0.038% by weight Mg, 0.026% by weight P, 0.029% by weight Cr, 0.004% by weight Al, 0.001% by weight S and 0.0007% by weight B, the remainder Fe and the conventional impurities. In the tensile test, the following values were established: yield strength Rp0.2 = 465 MPa, tensile strength Rm = 757 MPa, elongation at rupture A5 = 11.1% and modulus of elasticity E = 165 to 170 kN/mm2. The Brinell hardness is 258 +/- 3 HB.<br>
Example 3<br>
A wheel carrier for passenger cars was produced from the spheroidal cast alloy according to the invention. The chemical composition was 3.43% by weight C, 3.38% by weight Si, 0.71% by weight Cu, 0.2% by weight Mn, 0.037% by weight Mg, 0.047% by weight P, 0.043% by weight Cr, 0.012% by weight Al, 0.004% by weight S and 0.0008% by weight B, the remainder Fe and the conventional impurities. In the tensile test, the following values were established: yield strength Rp0.2 = 558 MPa, tensile strength Rm = 862 MPa and elongation at rupture A5 = 6.1%. The Brinell hardness is 288 HB. The number of spherulites in the microstructure was determined as 455 spherulites per mm2.<br>
Figure 4 shows the elongation at rupture A5 as a function of the tensile strength Rm. The solid line indicates the minimum values in accordance with the standard EN 1563 for cast iron with spheroidal graphite of types produced in the cast state. The measurements of the material according to the invention are entered in accordance with Examples 1 to 3 presented above.<br>
Figure 5 shows the elongation at rupture A5 as a function of the yield strength Rp0.2. The solid line indicates the minimum values in accordance with the<br><br>
WO 2006/056334	PCT/EP2005/012160<br>
- 7 -<br>
standard EN 1563 for cast iron with spheroidal graphite of types produced in the cast state. The measurements of the material according to the invention are entered in accordance with Examples 1 to 3 presented above.<br>
The material properties of the spheroidal cast iron according to the invention are consequently far above the European standard EN 1563 for cast iron with spheroidal graphite and even reach the values of ADI (= Austempered Ductile Iron) , a cast iron material standardized in Europe under EN 1564 which is produced by a very complex heat treatment in relatively great wall thicknesses that can only be obtained by alloying the expensive elements nickel and/or molybdenum, and is consequently correspondingly expensive.<br>
Figure 6 shows the strength ranges against the elongation at rupture of the materials aluminum cast alloys, cast iron with spheroidal graphite, ADI and the material according to the invention with Examples 1 to 3 entered.<br>
The uniformity of the structure is also achieved by a novel casting process. The casting mold is divided horizontally instead of vertically, the brake disks being arranged horizontally and the filling of the casting mold being carried out from the middle toward the edge of the brake disk. This has the consequence that the casting mold is filled rotationally symmetrically and that the brake disk is uniformly cooled from the inside to the outside after casting. As a result, a uniform, homogeneous structure is created over the entire circumference of the brake disk. A subsequent heat treatment, which is time-consuming and incurs costs, is no longer required.<br><br>
