				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING A MAXIMUM SIGNAL LEVEL OUTPUT TO HEADPHONES COUPLED TO A WIRELESS DEVICE<br>
<br>
FIELD OF THE APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application relates to the field of wireless<br>
devices, and more specifically, to a method and system for<br>
controlling a maximum signal level output to headphones<br>
coupled to a wireless device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Current wireless mobile communication devices include<br>
microprocessors, memory, soundcarcls, speakers, headphones, and<br>
run one or more software applications in addition to providing<br>
for voice communications. Examples of software applications<br>
used in these wireless devices include micro-browsers, address<br>
books, email clients, instant messaging ("IM") clients, and<br>
wavetable instruments. Additionally, wireless devices have<br>
access to a plurality of services via the Internet. A wireless<br>
device may, for example, be used to browse web sites on the<br>
Internet, to transmit and receive graphics, and to execute<br>
streaming audio and/or video applications. Such wireless<br>
devices may operate on a cellular network, on a wireless local<br>
area network ("WLAN"), or on both of these types of networks.<br>
[0003] One problem with current wireless devices pertains to the<br>
adjustment of maximum output sound pressure levels for<br>
headphones coupled to such devices. Headphones are typically<br>
used to listen to voice calls, radio programs, audio programs<br>
(e.g., music), etc., stored on or accessed by the wireless<br>
device. In particular, the maximum output sound pressure level<br>
for headphones for wireless devices and handheld products is<br>
legally constrained in several jurisdictions in order to<br>
protect users from hearing loss. For example, European<br>
Standard EN 50332-1:2000, dated March 2000 and entitled "Sound<br>
 <br>
System Equipment : Headphones And Earphones Associated With<br>
Portable Audio Equipment - Maximum Sound Pressure Level<br>
Measurement Methodology And Limit Considerations -- Part i:<br>
General Method For 'One Package Equipment'", and which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, restricts maximum sound<br>
pressure level at the headphones (i.e., for headphones<br>
provided with the portable audio equipment and from the same<br>
manufacturer) to 100 dB. In addition, European Standard EN<br>
50332-2:2003, dated October 2003 and entitled "Sound System<br>
Equipment: Headphones And Earphones Associated With Portable<br>
Audio Equipment - Maximum Sound Pressure Level Measurement<br>
Methodology And Limit Considerations - Part 2: Matching Of<br>
Sets With Headphones If Either Or Both Are Offered<br>
Separately", and which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
restricts maximum sound pressure level at the headphones<br>
(i.e., for headphones provided separately from the portable<br>
audio equipment by a different manufacturer) to 94 dB.<br>
Measurement of maximum sound pressure levels according to<br>
these standards is specified with respect to headphones having<br>
an impedance of 3 2 Ohms. One problem relating to such<br>
standards is that in order to set the output signal level<br>
(e.g., in mV RMS) appropriately at the output jack of the<br>
wireless device in order to meet the maximum sound pressure<br>
level specified, the impedance of the headphones must be<br>
known. This is especially problematic if the headphones are<br>
not provided by the manufacturer as a package with the<br>
wireless device.<br>
[0004] A need therefore exists for an improved method and system<br>
for controlling a maximum signal level output to headphones<br>
coupled to a wireless device. Accordingly, a solution that<br>
addresses, at least in part, the above and other shortcomings<br>
is desired.<br>
 <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013] In the following description, details are set forth to<br>
provide an understanding of the application. In some<br>
instances, certain software, circuits, structures and<br>
techniques have not been described or shown in detail in order<br>
not to obscure the application. Embodiments of the present<br>
application may be implemented in any computer programming<br>
 <br>
language provided that the operating system of the wireless<br>
device or data processing system provides the facilities that<br>
may support the requirements of the application. Any<br>
limitations presented would be a result of a particular type<br>
of operating system or computer programming language and would<br>
not be a limitation of the present application. Embodiments of<br>
the preset application may also be implemented in hardware or<br>
in a combination of hardware and software.<br>
[0014] According to one embodiment of the application, there is<br>
provided a method for controlling a maximum signal level<br>
output to headphones of a wireless device. The method<br>
includes; determining an impedance of the headphones;<br>
determining a carrier specific maximum signal level for<br>
headphones having the impedance; and, adjusting an audio<br>
amplifier of the wireless device coupled to the headphones to<br>
restrict the maximum signal level output to the headphones to<br>
the carrier specific maximum signal level.<br>
[0015] FIG. 1 is a front view illustrating a wireless device 100<br>
coupled to headphones 105 fa.k.a . , headphone set, headphone,<br>
headset, earphone, earphones, etc.) and adapted for<br>
implementing an embodiment of the application. The wireless<br>
device 100 includes a casing 150, a display screen 122, a<br>
graphical user interface ("GUI") 180 displayed on the display<br>
screen 122, a keyboard (or keypad) 132, a trackball (or<br>
thumbwheel) 110, various select buttons 120, various<br>
inputs/outputs (e.g., power connector jack, data interface<br>
ports, etc.) 160, and a headphones jack 106. Internally, the<br>
wireless device 100 includes one or more circuit boards (not<br>
shown) , a CPU 138, memory 124, 12 6, 200, a battery 156, an<br>
antenna (not shown), etc., which are operatively coupled to<br>
the various inputs/outputs 160, the keyboard 132, the display<br>
 <br>
0<br>
screen 122, the headphones jack 10 6, etc., as will be<br>
described below.<br>
[0016] The headphones 105 are coupled to the wireless device 100<br>
by a headphones cable or lead 107 which is inserted into the<br>
headphones jack 106. The headphones 105 include a speaker<br>
assembly which is inserted into or placed over a user's ear.<br>
According to one embodiment, the headphones 105 include two<br>
speaker assemblies, one for each of the user's ears. Each<br>
speaker assembly includes a speaker having an impedance<br>
(referred to as the impedance of the headphones in the<br>
following). The headphones 105, headphones jack 106, and<br>
headphones cable 107 may be configured for stereo and/or mono<br>
operation. When the headphones cable 107 is inserted into the<br>
headphones jack 106, audio output signals may be switched from<br>
the internal speaker 134 (see FIG. 2) to the headphones 105.<br>
Control of audio signal level (e.g., in mV RMS) output to the<br>
headphones 105 is performed by a headphones subsystem 400 as<br>
described below. According to one embodiment, the headphones<br>
jack 106 is a 3.5 mm headset jack adapted to support both a<br>
stereo headphones output and a mono microphone input.<br>
[0017] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the wireless<br>
device 100 of FIG. 1 and a wireless network 220 adapted for<br>
implementing an embodiment of the application. The wireless<br>
network 220 may include antenna, base stations, access points,<br>
transceivers, supporting radio equipment, etc., as known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art, for supporting wireless<br>
communications between the wireless device 100 and other<br>
devices (not shown).<br>
[0018] The wireless device 100 may be a two-way communication<br>
device having at least voice and advanced data communication<br>
capabilities, including the capability to communicate with<br>
other devices. Depending on the functionality provided by the<br>
 <br>
6<br>
device 100, it may be referred to as a data messaging device,<br>
a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging<br>
capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, a data<br>
communication device (with or without telephony capabilities),<br>
a Wi-Fi device, a WLAN device, a dual-mode (i.e., Wi-Fi and<br>
cellular) device, or a portable audio device.<br>
[0019] The wireless device 100 has a communication subsystem<br>
111, which includes a RF receiver, a RF transmitter, and<br>
associated components. As will be apparent to those skiIIed in<br>
the field of communications, the particular design of the<br>
communication subsystem 111 depends on the communication<br>
network 220 in which the device 100 is intended to operate.<br>
[0020] The device 100 may be capable of cellular network access<br>
and hence the device 100 may have a subscriber identity module<br>
(or "SIM" card) 162 for inserting into a SIM interface ("IF")<br>
164 in order to operate on the cellular network (e.g., a<br>
global system for mobile communication ("GSM") network).<br>
[0021] The device 100 may be a battery-powered device and so it-<br>
may also include a battery IF 154 for receiving one or more<br>
rechargeable batteries 15 6. The battery (or batteries) 156<br>
provides electrical power to most if not all electrical<br>
circuitry in the device 100, and the battery IF 154 provides<br>
for a mechanical and electrical connection for it.<br>
[0022] The wireless device 10 0 includes a microprocessor 138,<br>
also called a processor, which controls overall operation of<br>
the device 100. The microprocessor 138 interacts with device<br>
subsystems such as the display 122, a flash memory 124 or<br>
other persistent store, a random access memory ("RAM") 12 6,<br>
auxiliary input/output ("I/O") subsystems 128, a serial port<br>
(e.g., a universal serial bus ("USB") port) 131, the keyboard<br>
132, the trackball or thumbwheel 110, the headphones 105, an<br>
internal speaker 134, a microphone 136, a1 short-range<br>
communications subsystem 141, and other device subsystems 142.<br>
 <br>
7<br>
The microprocessor 138, in addition to performing operating<br>
system functions, preferably enables execution of software<br>
applications on the device 100.<br>
[0023] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a memory 200 of<br>
the wireless device 100 of FIGS. 1 and 2. The microprocessor<br>
138 is coupled to the memory 200, The memory 20 0 has various<br>
hardware and software components for storing information<br>
(e.g., instructions, data, database tables, test parameters,<br>
etc.} for enabling operation of the device 100 and may include<br>
flash memory 12 4, RAM 12 6, ROM (not shown), disk drives (not<br>
shown), etc. In general, the memory 200 may include a variety<br>
of storage devices typically arranged in a hierarchy of<br>
storage as understood to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0024] Operating system ("0/S") software modules 202 used by the<br>
microprocessor 138 may be stored in a persistent store such as<br>
the flash memory 124, which may alternatively be a read-only<br>
memory ("ROM") or similar storage element (not shown). Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system,<br>
specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be<br>
temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as RAM 126.<br>
[0025] To provide a user-friendly environment to control the<br>
operation of the device 100, operating system ("O/S") software<br>
modules 202 resident on the device 100 provide a basic set of<br>
operations for supporting various applications typically<br>
operable through the GUI 180 and supporting GUI software<br>
modules 204. For example, the O/S 202 provides basic<br>
input/output system features to obtain input from the<br>
auxiliary I/O 128, the keyboard 132, the trackball or<br>
thumbwheel 110, and the like, and for facilitating output to<br>
the user through the display 122, the speaker 134, the<br>
headphones 105, etc. According to one embodiment, the wireless<br>
device 100 is provided with hardware and/or software modules<br>
 <br>
8<br>
206 for facilitating and implementing the method of the<br>
application as will be described below.<br>
[0026] A user may interact with the wireless device 100 and its<br>
various software modules 202, 204, 206, using the GUI 180.<br>
GUIs are supported by common operating systems and provide a<br>
display format which enables a user to choose commands,<br>
execute application programs, manage computer files, and<br>
perform other functions by selecting pictorial representations<br>
known as icons, or items from a menu through use of an 1nput<br>
or pointing device such as a trackball or thumbwheel 110 and<br>
keyboard 132, The GUI 180 may include a cursor 190, various<br>
selectable objects and icons 191, and various windows 192.<br>
[0027] Thus, the wireless device 100 includes computer<br>
executable programmed instructions for directing the device<br>
100 to implement the embodiments of the present application.<br>
The programmed instructions may be embodied in one or more<br>
hardware or software modules 206 which may be resident in the<br>
memory 200 of the wireless device 100. Alternatively, the<br>
programmed instructions may be embodied on a computer readable<br>
medium (such as a CD disk or floppy disk) which may be used<br>
for transporting the programmed instructions to the memory of<br>
the wireless device 100. Alternatively, the programmed<br>
instructions may be embedded in a computer-readable signal or<br>
signal-bearing medium that may be uploaded to a network 220 by<br>
a vendor or supplier of the programmed instructions, and this<br>
signal or signal-bearing medium may be downloaded through an<br>
interface 111, 131, 141 to the wireless device 100 from the<br>
network 220 by end users or potential buyers.<br>
[0028] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a headphones<br>
subsystem 400 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
application. Components of the headphones subsystem 400 are<br>
generally contained in the wireless device 100 and are used to<br>
 <br>
9<br>
determine the impedance of the headphones 105 in order to<br>
adjust the maximum signal level (e.g., in mV RMS) output to<br>
the headphones 105 (and hence the maximum sound pressure level<br>
output by the headphones 105).<br>
[0029] According to one embodiment, the headphones system 400<br>
includes a signal generator 410, a digital to analog converter<br>
("DAC") 440, and an audio amplifier 430 for generating an<br>
inaudible high freguency signal (e.g., 25 kHz). The signal<br>
generator 410, DAC 440, and audio amplifier 430 are controlled<br>
by the microprocessor 138. The audio amplifier 430 is coupled<br>
to the headphones 105 through a series resistor R. The series<br>
resistor R may have a low value (e.g., 5 Ohms). A voltage V<br>
produced across the resistor R when the high freguency signal<br>
is applied to the resistor R and headphones 105 is indicative<br>
of the impedance Z of the headphones 105. The signal may be<br>
applied to the resistor R and headphones 105 whenever the<br>
headphones 105 are connected to the headphones jack 106 via<br>
the headphones cable 107. The voltage V is amplified by a<br>
microphone pre-amplifier 450 which is coupled to an analog to<br>
digital converter ("ADC") 420 . The ADC 420 monitors the<br>
voltage V and provides a digital signal indicative of the<br>
voltage V and hence the impedance Z of the headphones 105 to<br>
the microprocessor 138. The ADC 420 may also be used by the<br>
microphone 136 of the wireless device 100 in order to reduce<br>
component count. The microprocessor 138 receives the digital<br>
signal from the ADC 420 and determines the impedance Z of the<br>
headphones 105 from it (e.g., by voltage divider principles,<br>
etc.). The microprocessor 138 may do this by accessing a table<br>
that stores voltage values (or digital signal values) and<br>
corresponding headphones impedance values.<br>
[0030] Having determined the impedance Z for the headphones 105,<br>
the microprocessor 138 controls the audio amplifier 430 to<br>
restrict the maximum signal level (e.g., in mV RMS) output to<br>
 <br>
1.0<br>
the headphones 105. In this way, the sound pressure level<br>
output by the headphones 105 may be restricted to a maximum<br>
sound pressure level for the determined impedance Z. The<br>
microprocessor 138 may do this by accessing a table (e.g.,<br>
included in or associated with modules 206) that stores<br>
headphones impedance values, corresponding maximum signal<br>
level values for the audio amplifier 430, and/or corresponding<br>
maximum sound pressure values for the headphones 105. For<br>
example, for a headphones impedance value of approximately 32<br>
Ohms, the table 406 may indicate that the maximum sound<br>
pressure level for the headphones 105 is 100 dB.<br>
[0031] According to one embodiment, if a headphone impedance<br>
value corresponding to the determined headphone impedance Z is<br>
not listed in the table 406, no maximum signal level for the<br>
audio amplifier 430 and no maximum sound pressure level for<br>
the headphones 105 is prescribed and hence the maximum signal<br>
level of the audio amplifier 430 and the maximum sound<br>
pressure level for the headphones 105 are not restricted for<br>
that value of determined headphones impedance Z.<br>
[0032] Now, the maximum signal level (e.g., in mV RMS) and/or<br>
the maximum sound pressure .level (e.g., in dB) for a given<br>
headphones impedance may be set by government regulation which<br>
may change depending on the carrier or the 1ocation in which<br>
the wireless device 100 is operating or is sold. As is known<br>
to those skilled in the art, the wireless device 100 has means<br>
for determining its carrier and/or location and hence the<br>
government regulations that may apply to set maximum signal<br>
levels and/or maximum sound pressure levels. Thus, according<br>
to one embodiment, the microprocessor 138 receives a signal<br>
indicative of the carrier and/or location of the wireless<br>
device 100 and determines whether a maximum signal level value<br>
and/or a maximum sound pressure level value has been<br>
prescribed  for  the  carrier  and/or  location  and  for  the<br>
 <br>
11<br>
determined headphones impedance Z. The microprocessor 138 may<br>
do this by accessing a table 406 that stores wireless device<br>
location, corresponding headphones impedance values,<br>
corresponding carrier (or location) specific maximum signal<br>
level values (if any) for the audio amplifier 430, and/or<br>
corresponding carrier (or location) specific maximum sound<br>
pressure level values (if any) for the headphones 105. For<br>
example, the table may indicate that if the wireless device<br>
100 is associated with a carrier based in Great Britain and if<br>
the headphones impedance is 32 Ohms (i.e., + /-■ 20%), then the<br>
maximum sound pressure level should be restricted to 100 dB<br>
(i.e., if the headphones 105 and wireless device 100 are sold<br>
as a package). As another example, the table 40 6 may indicate<br>
that if the wireless device 100 is associated with a carrier<br>
based in Great Britain and if the headphones impedance is 32<br>
Ohms (i.e., -+-/- 20%), then the maximum sound pressure level<br>
should be restricted to 94 dB (i.e., if the headphones 105 and<br>
wireless device 100 are not sold as a package).<br>
[0033] Similarly the maximum signal level (e.g., in mV RMS)<br>
and/or the maximum sound pressure level (e.g., in dB) may be<br>
set by government regulation which may change depending on the-<br>
carrier or the location in which the wireless device 100 is<br>
operating or is sold (i.e., irrespective of the impendence of<br>
the headphones 105) . Again, as is known to those skilled in<br>
the art, the wireless device 100 has means for determining its<br>
carrier and/or location and hence the government regulations<br>
that may apply to set maximum signal levels and/or maximum<br>
sound pressure levels. Thus, according to one embodiment, the<br>
microprocessor 138 receives a signal indicative of the carrier<br>
and/or location of the wireless device 100 and determines<br>
whether a maximum signal level value and/or a maximum sound<br>
pressure level value has been prescribed for the carrier<br>
and/or  location.  The microprocessor  138  may do  this by<br>
 <br>
12<br>
accessing a table 406 that stores wireless device carrier (or<br>
location), corresponding headphones impedance values,<br>
corresponding carrier specific maximum signal level values (if<br>
any) for the audio amplifier 430, and/or corresponding carrier<br>
specific maximum sound pressure level values (if any) for the<br>
headphones 105. For example, the table 406 may indicate that<br>
if the wire1ess device 100 is associated with a carrier based<br>
in Great: Britain, then the maximum sound pressure level should<br>
be restricted to 100 dts (i.e., if: the headphones 105 and<br>
wireless device 100 are sold as a package). As another<br>
example, the table 40 6 may indicate that if the wireless<br>
device 100 is associated with a carrier based in Great<br>
Britain, then the maximum sound pressure level should be<br>
restricted to 94 dB (i.e., if the headphones 105 and wireless<br>
device 100 are not sold as a package).<br>
[0034] According to one embodiment, updates to the table 406<br>
storing carrier (or wireless device location), corresponding<br>
headphones impedance values, corresponding carrier specific<br>
maximum signal level values (if any) for the audio amplifier<br>
430, and corresponding carrier specific maximum sound pressure<br>
level values (if any) for the headphones 105 may be<br>
periodically downloaded to the wireless device 100 (e.g., over<br>
the network 220) .<br>
[0035] According to one embodiment, the carrier associated with<br>
the wireless device 100 may be determined from messages<br>
delivered to the wireless device 100 over the network 220.<br>
According to another embodiment, the carrier may be determined<br>
from information stored in the wireless device's SIM card 162.<br>
[0036] According to one embodiment, the location of the wireless<br>
device 10 0 may be determined from messages delivered to the<br>
wireless device 100 over the network 220. According to another<br>
embodiment, the location of the wireless device 100 may be<br>
determined by a global positioning system ("GPS") receiver<br>
 <br>
13<br>
(not shown) optionally provided for the device 100. According<br>
to another embodiment, the location of the wireless device 100<br>
may be determined from the location of antennae towers<br>
associated with the network 220 on which the wireless device<br>
100 operates .<br>
[0037] FIG.  5 is a block diagram illustrating an alternate<br>
headphones subsystem 400 in accordance with an embodiment of<br>
the  application.  In FIG.  5,  a  signal  source  510  (e.g.,<br>
microprocessor 138) generates a signal (e.g., an audio signal,<br>
an inaudible audio signal, etc.) that is applied to a digital<br>
to analog converter ("DAC") 540. The output of the DAC 540 is<br>
conditioned 530  (e.g.,  amplified 430,  etc.)  to allow for<br>
impendence measurement 52 0 (e.g., via a resistor R, etc.) of<br>
the headphones 105 connected to the headphones jack 506.<br>
[0038] The  application  may  provide  several  advantages.  For<br>
example, the method of the present application allows wireless<br>
devices 100 to restrict maximum signal levels and maximum<br>
sound  pressure  levels  to  prescribed  legal  limits  when<br>
necessary.<br>
[0039] Aspects of the above described method may be illustrated<br>
w i t h  t h e  aid  of  a  f 1 o w chart,  FIG.  6  is  a  f .1 o w  c h a r t<br>
illustrating operations 60 0 of modules 206 within the memory<br>
200 of a wireless device 210 for controlling maximum signal<br>
level output to headphones 105 of the wireless device 100, in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the application.<br>
[0040] At step 601, the operations 600 start.<br>
[0041] At step 602, an impedance Z of the headphones 105 is<br>
determined.<br>
[0042] At step 603, a carrier specific maximum signal level for<br>
headphones having the impedance Z is determined.<br>
[0043] At step 604,  an audio amplifier 430 of the wireless<br>
device 100 coupled to the headphones 105 is adjusted to<br>
 <br>
14<br>
restrict the maximum signal level output to the headphones 105<br>
to the carrier specific maximum signal level,<br>
[0044] At step 605, the operations 600 end.<br>
[0045] The above described method is generally performed by the<br>
'wireless device 100. However, according to one embodiment, the<br>
method can be performed by, or in combination with, a data<br>
processing system (not shown) such a personal computer ("PC")<br>
or server, a stereo system, a television system, etc.<br>
