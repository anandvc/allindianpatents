“SPIROPIPERIDINE COMPOUNDS AS ORL-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS”<br>
ELI LILLY AND COMPANY, a corporation of the state of Indiana, United States of America., having a principal place of business at Lilly Corporate Center City of Indianapolis, State of Indiana, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
SPIROPIPERIDINE COMPOUNDS AS ORL-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
Orphanin FQ (OFQ)/Nociceptin is a 17 amino acid peptide that has high affinity for the ORL1 G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The ORL1 receptor is a Class A GPCR that is expressed primarily in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system as well as in the gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscle, and immune system. While related structurally to opioid peptides/receptors the OFQ/Nociceptin system exhibits no significant cross reactivity to classical opioid peptides/receptors and exhibits anti-opioid activity in vivo (for example ORQ/Nociccptin has been reported to exhibit anti¬nociceptive properties).<br>
Nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOC/OFQ) antagonists, specifically antagonists of the ORL-l receptor have demonstrated anti-depressant activity and anorectic activity in numerous studies with animal models for depression and feeding behavior. As such, ORL-1 antagonists are deemed to be useful in the treatment of depression and/or the treatment of overweight, obesity, and/or weight maintenance post treatment for overweight or obesity.<br>
WO 2003/095427 describes certain spiropiperidinyl compounds as ORL-1 antagonists for use as analgesics.<br>
Yoshizumi, Takashi et al. (2008), Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship study of a novel class of ORL-1 receptor antagonists based on N-biarylmethyl spiropiperidine, Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters vol. 18, pg. 3778-3782, describes certain jV-biarylmethyl-spiropiperidine compounds as selective ORL-1 antagonists.<br>
The present invention provides a family of 4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran] compounds with high antagonist potency for the ORL-1 receptor and high in vivo ORL-l receptor occupancy in the CNS. Additionally, certain of the compounds have a favorable cardiotoxicology profile as determined by selectivity over the hERG channel activity, as well as high selectivity over other physiologically important receptors (e.g. mu, kappa and delta opioids, serotonin, and dopamine receptors). Further, certain of the compounds of the present invention have favorable biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. solubility, oral exposure, and<br>
 <br>
CNS permeability). Certain of the compounds of the present invention exhibit reduced oxidative metabolism resulting in favorable oral bioavailability. Certain compounds have also demonstrated through animal models that the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of migraine.<br>

General Chemistry<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following synthetic schemes by methods well known and appreciated in the art. Suitable reaction conditions for the steps of these schemes arc well known in the art and appropriate substitutions of solvents and co-reagents arc within the skill of the art. Likewise, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that synthetic intermediates may be isolated and/or purified by various well known techniques as needed or desired, and that frequently, it will be possible to use various intermediates directly in subsequent synthetic steps with little or no purification. Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in some eircumstanees, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical. The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties, as is well appreciated by the skilled chemist. All substitucnts, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined, and all reagents are well known and appreciated in the art.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
 <br>
 <br>
By using reductive amination reaction conditions, compound 111 is reacted with an appropriately substituted pyrazole carbaldchydc and a reducing reagent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature to provide compound II. Under an appropriate coupling condition, compound II is coupled with compound IV, wherein Hal is chloro, bromo, or iodo, with a suitable catalyst such as copper iodide, an appropriate base such as potassium carbonate, in a solvent such as toluene at elevated temperature to give compound I', wherein R4 is R4or a precursor of R4. When Hal on compound IV is F or CI, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is an alternative method to make compound I'. More specifically, compound II can react with compound IV in an appropriate solvent such as dimethylformamide with a suitable base such as potassium carbonate at elevated temperature to provide compound I'. Compound III can also react with an appropriately substituted aldehyde compound V under reductive amination conditions as above to give the desired compound I'. When R4 is a precursor to R4, it is then converted to R4 by known methods.<br>

Compounds Ilia, Illb, and IIIc can be made as illustrated in Scheme 2. Compounds XIV and XV are reacted in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethanc in the presence of a suitable acid such as trifluroacetic acid. The resultant trifluoroacetate is basified with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to give compound X11I as a free base. Compound XIII in a suitable solvent such as methyl /-butyl ether is treated with a solution of sulfuryl chloride in acetic acid at ambient temperature to give compound VIII as a hydrochloride salt. Compound VITI is then protected with a nitrogen protecting group under conditions well known to the skilled artisan to give compound VII. (For example, sec: Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Chapters 2 and 7, John Wiley and Sons Inc., (1999)). Typically, the protecting group is a Boc (teri-Butyloxycarbonyl) group. Compound VII is reacted with iV-bromosuccinimidc in an appropriate solvent such as chlorobenzene with irradiation of a light source to give a bromide compound, which is then treated with a base solution such as aqueous sodium bicarbonate to afford a hydroxyl compound. With or without isolation, the hydroxyl compound can be further oxidized under suitable oxidation conditions such as in potassium bromide, tetramethylpiperidine-A^-oxide, and aqueous sodium hypochloridc solution to provide the desired ketone compound VI. Compound VI is then reacted with<br>
 <br>
(bis(2-methylethyl)amino)sulfur trifluoride in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at elevated temperature, the product obtained is de-protected to provide compound Ilia.<br>
Compound of formula XIII is protected to give compound XII with a similar method to that used to make compound VII. Compound XII in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at lowered temperature is treated with a suitable base such as lithium tetramethylpiperidine, followed by addition of AT-fluorobcnzenesulfonimide to afford a fluoride compound, which is de-protected with aqueous HC1 and basified with aqueous NaOH solution to provide compound Illb.<br>
By the same method used for making compound VI above, compound IX can be obtained from compound XII through three-step synthesis, such as bromination, hydroxylation, and oxidation. Each intermediate can be isolated as pure compound for further reaction or reacted without isolation as described in the synthesis of compound VI. Compound IX is then treated with a suitable halogen-metal exchange reagent such as butyl lithium in proper solvent such as tetrahydrofuran under lowered temperature, followed by a fluorinating reagent such as AT-fluoro-benzenesulfonimide to afford the desired fluorinated product, which is then de-protected appropriately to give the desired compound IIIc.<br>

Compounds of formula V can be made as illustrated in Scheme 3. Compound XVI is reacted with compound XVIT to afford compound of formula XV under SNAr or coupling conditions described above for the conversion of compound II to compound V. When Z is an ester group, it can be reduced to an alcohol first with a proper reducing reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride in appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The alcohol is then oxidized to aldehyde with a proper oxidation reagent such as manganese (IV) oxide in a solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
When R4' is the precursor of R4, the transformation of R4 to R4 will include but not limited to reactions such as reductive amination to provide a desired new amine; reduction of an ester, ketone, or aldehyde to an alcohol, which can be further converted to an alkoxy compound or a carbamate; reduction of a nitrile to an amide or an amine; the transformation of an ester to a heterocycle such as oxadiazol under proper condition. (For more examples, sgg: Richard C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations. Second Edition, Chapters 2 and 7, John Wiley and Sons Inc., (1999)).<br>
The following Preparations and Examples are illustrative of methods useful for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention. The names for many of the compounds illustrated in the preparations and examples are provided from structures drawn with 'Symyx Draw 3.1' or 'Autonom 2000 Name'.<br>
Preparation 1:4'.5'-Dihvdrospiro[piperidine-4.7'-thienor2.3-clpyranl<br>
H<br>
3-Thiopheneethanol (123.03 mL, 1.11 mol) is added to a solution oiN-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone (185 g, 928.48 mmol) in dichloromethane (1300 mL) and stirred at room temperature. Then trifluoroacetic acid (280.82 mL, 3.71 moles) is added dropwise (5 min) while cooling with an ice/water bath (internal temperature = 14°C-30°C, caution: CO2 evolution). The reaction mixture is gradually warmed to ambient temperature and stirred at that temperature for 20 hr. The solvent is evaporated to provide<br>
 <br>
a beige crystalline solid upon cooling in vacuo. The solid is slurried in methyl t-butyl ether (200 mL), filtered, washed with methyl t-butyl ether (2 x 1000 mL) and dried under vacuum to afford 4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-l-ium trifluoroacetate as a white solid in 95% yield. MS = (m/z): 210 (M+l).  10 M sodium hydroxide (220.36 mL, 2.20 mol) is added to a stirred suspension of 4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-l-ium trifluoroacetate (285 g, 881.44 mmol) in dichloromethane (1 L) with cooling (ice/water bath) and the resulting mixture is stirred till a biphasic mixture is obtained. The phases are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2x200 mL). Combined organics are concentrated under vacuum to obtain a thick oil which is triturated with water to obtain a light yellow precipitate. The precipitate is filtered, washed with water (300 mL) and hexane (200 mL) and dried under vacuum at 35°C for 20 hr. to yield the title compound as a light yellow solid in 86% yield. MS (m/z): 210 (M+l).<br>
Preparation 2: tert-Butyl spiro[4,5-dihydrothieno[2,3-c]pyran-7,4'-piperidine]-1-carboxylate<br>
X<br>
Spiro[4,5-dihydrothieno[2,3-c]pyran-7,4'-piperidine] (60 g, 286.6 mmol) in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (600 mL) is stirred at 22CC for 10 min. Then, fm-butoxycarbonyl ten-butyl carbonate (65.6 g, 301 mmol) in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (300 mL) is added dropwise. After 12 hr., an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (250 mL) is added and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is washed twice with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2 x 50 mL) and the organic layers are combined and washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound in 99% yield. MS (m/z): 310 (M+l).<br>

To a screw-cap test tube containing a mixture of 3-methyl-l-(3-(tctrahydrofuran-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-lH-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde (192 mg, 0.75 mmol), 2'-chloro-4',4'-difluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyrane (209 mg, 0.75 mmol) and acetic acid (43 uL, 0.75 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (2.6 mL) is added sodium<br>
10     triacetoxyborohydride (238 mg, 1.1 mmol). The reaction tube is scaled and stirred at<br>
room temperature for 18 hr. with the aid of a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is diluted with methanol and purified using a 10 g SCX cartridge and the solvent evaporated in vacuo. The resulting residue is further purified by normal phase Isco chromatography eluting with hexane:acetone (gradient from 5 to 30% in acetone) to give 113 mg of the title<br>

Enantiomeric resolution is carried out under SCF (supercritical fluid chromatography) conditions using Chiralpak AD-H® (Chiral Technologies, Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) as stationary phase and carbon dioxide/methanol/dimcthyl ethyl amine (0.2%) as mobile phase. The first eluent is the desired enantiomer.<br>

The mixture is stirred 10 min at room temperature. Then, sodium triacetoxyborohydride (268.3 mg) is added, and the reaction is stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture is diluted with dichloromethane and quenched slowly with sodium bicarbonate (saturated solution). The organic phase is then extracted with more dichloromethane, decanted, dried over magnesium sulfate and solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by reverse phase HPLC to give 67.9 mg of 2-chloro-4,4-difluoro-l'-[[l-(3-fluoro-2-pyridyl)-3-(isopropoxymethyl)pyrazol-4-yl]methyl]spiro[5H-thieno[2,3-c]pyrdn-7,4'-piperidine].

X-Ray Powder Diffraction<br>
 <br>
The XRD pattern of the crystalline solid is obtained on a Bruker D4 Endeavor X-ray powder diffractometer, equipped with a CuKa source X = 1.54060 A) and a Vantcc detector, operating at 35 kV and 50 mA. The sample is scanned between 4 and 40° in 20, with a step size of 0.0087° in 20 and a scan rate of 0.5 seconds/step, and with 0.6 mm divergence, 5.28 fixed anti-scatter, and 9.5 mm detector slits. The dry powder is packed on a quartz sample holder and a smooth surface is obtained using a glass slide. The crystal form diffraction patterns are collected at ambient temperature and relative humidity. The background was removed prior to peak picking. It is well known in the crystallography art that, for any given crystal form, the relative intensities of the diffraction peaks may vary due to preferred orientation resulting from factors such as crystal morphology and habit. Where the effects of preferred orientation are present, peak intensities are altered, but the characteristic peak positions of the polymorph are unchanged. See, e.g. , The United States Pharmacopeia #23, National Formulary #18, pages 1843-1844, 1995. Furthermore, it is also well known in the crystallography art that for any given crystal form the angular peak positions may vary slightly. For example, peak positions can shift due to a variation in the temperature or humidity at which a sample is analyzed, sample displacement, or the presence or absence of an internal standard. In the present case, a peak position variability of ± 0.1° in 20 will take into account these potential variations without hindering the unequivocal identification of the indicated crystal form. Confirmation of a crystal form may be made based on any unique combination of distinguishing peaks (in units of ° 20), typically the more prominent peaks.<br>

Specifically it is found that nociceptin receptor antagonists are effective in rodent models of depression both alone and in combination with tricyclic or selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SSR1) antidepressants, in rodent models of inhibiting hyperphagia, of inhibiting weight regain following previous weight loss, and in models for migraine. Moreover, studies conducted in noeiceptin reeeptor knockout miee have demonstrated that the aetion of nociceptin antagonists in the forced swim test (measure of antidepressant activity) and in fasting-induced feeding (anti-obesity activity) is genotype dependent, supporting a specific mechanism of nociceptin antagonist action in these animal models. As the<br>
 <br>
previously described disorders represent common co-morbid clinical conditions a nociceptin receptor antagonist may be particularly effective in these specific patient populations, such as patients with major depressive disorder, binge-eating disorder, overweight, obesity, and obesity with co-morbid clinical mood disorders.<br>
To further demonstrate the characteristics of the present compounds, representative compounds are run in the following in vitro and in vivo assays: In Vitro Receptor Binding<br>
Radioligand binding assays arc commonly used to determine the affinity (K,) or potency of a compound to bind to a particular receptor or target protein. A filtration-based [3H]-OFQ/nociceptin receptor binding assay is developed based on previous assay formats (Ardati A, Henningsen RA, Higelin J, Reinscheid RK, Civelli O, Monsma FJ Jr. Mol Pharmacol. 1997 May;51(5):816-24.) with minor modifications. [3H]-OFQ/nociccptin binding assays are carried out in deep-well 96-well plates. [ H]OFQ (final assay concentration 0.2 nM) competition studies are carried out with 5-10 jig of membrane protein (isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) expressing cloned human ORL1 receptors) in a final assay volume of 0.5 mL of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Samples are incubated for 60 min. at room temperature, which is found to be optimal for competition assays. The assays are terminated by filtration through glass fiber filters (Wallac filtermat A) [prctreated with 0.3% polyetlrylenimine (Sigma) for 1 hr] on a Tometc cell harvester, and the filters are washed three times with 5 mL of ice-cold 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4.   Filtcrmats are then dried and imbedded with Meltilex scintillant A and the radioactivity counted in a Wallac Microbeta scintillation counter. Specific binding is determined by displacement with 100 nM unlabeled nociceptin. Curves are plotted as the percent of specific binding and TC50 values arc determined using a sigmoidal dose response curve with variable slope. K; values are calculated from the ICso by the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng, Y.C., and Prusoff, W.H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108 (1973)) where K: =IC50 x (1+D x K/1)"'.<br>
Similarly, K, for the mu, kappa and delta opioids, serotonin, dopamine, adrenergic, mucarinic, and histamine receptors, as well as binding to the norepinephrine transporter, sodium channel, chloride channel, and calcium channel may be determined<br>
 <br>
using membranes expressing the desired receptor/transporter/channels and appropriate corresponding radioligand competitor molecules.<br>
Exemplified compounds are tested essentially as described above and are found to have high affinity for the ORL-1 receptor. Kj 's for the ORL-1 receptor for the exemplified compounds are found to be less than 2 nM, while the K, for other receptors/transporters/channels tested are found to be significantly greater. The compounds of Examples 62, 23, and 53 are tested essentially as described above and are found to have affinities as shown in Table 3 below.<br>

In Vitro Functional Blockade of Agonist-Mediated G-protcin Activation -GTPy-r35S1 Binding.<br>
Agonist-mediated stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors results in the activation of membrane associated GapVprotein heterotrimcr complexes, and represents the first step in the transduction of extracellular signals to modification of intracellular pathways. The first step in activation of receptor-mediated activation of Ga(3y-proteins heterotrimer is the exchange of Ga subunit bound guanosine diphoshpate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The binding of GTP to the Ga subunit causes dissociation of the heterotrimer subunits, G0 and Gy, resulting in the modulation of several<br>
 <br>
intracellular signaling cascades. Measurement of receptor-mediated G-protein activation can be measured using the non-hydrolyzable radiolabeled analog of GTP, GTP-y-[35S]. Utilizing this methodology, antagonist affinity (Kb) is measured in membranes expressing cloned human ORLl/nociceptin receptors using a GTP-y-[35S] binding assay according to previously described protocols with minor modifications (DcLapp et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999 May;289(2):946-55; Ozaki et al., Eur J Pharmacol. 2000 Aug 18;402(l-2):45-53). Assays arc conducted in a 200-ul volume with the following buffer composition: 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, I mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 3 uM GDP, 0.5 nM [35S]GTPyS. ORL1 receptor membrane suspension is added at a concentration of 20 ng protein per well and receptor stimulation is achieved using 300 nM nociccptin/OFQ. Wheat germ agglutinin coated SPA beads (Amersham, Arlington Hts., IL) arc added at 1 mg per well to detect membrane-bound [35S]GTPyS. Plates arc sealed and incubated for 2 hr. at room temperature. Plates are then placed at 4 °C overnight to allow the SPA beads to settle and then counted in a Wallac Microbeta. Specific [35S]GTPyS binding is determined as the difference in CPM observed in the absence and presence of 10 ^M unlabeled GTPyS. Data are plotted as the percent of specific [35S]GTPyS bound. Curves arc plotted as the percent of specific binding and ICso values arc determined using a sigmoidal dose response curve with variable slope. Antagonist affinity (Kb) is estimated according to DeLapp et al., 1999 using a modification of the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (1973) where Kb= IC50 x(l+D x<br>
EC50"1)"1-<br>
Excmplified compounds are tested essentially as described above and are found to be potent antagonists of the ORL-1 receptor. Kb's for the ORL-1 receptor for exemplified compounds are found to be less than 6 nM. The compounds of Examples 1, 23, and 53 are tested essentially as described above and are found to have Kb 's for the ORL-1 receptor of 0.20, 1.52, and 0.62 nM, respectively.<br>
In Vivo Receptor Occupancy<br>
Receptor occupancy (RO) using LC/MS/MS has been established as a way to measure central target engagement of putative ORL-1 antagonist in vivo. Nociccptin/ORLl receptor occupancy (RO) is measured in the hypothalamus, a structure<br>
 <br>
which contains a high density of nociceptin/ORL 1 binding sites that are inside the blood brain barrier, using a novel proprietary nociceptin/ORL 1 antagonist RO tracer, 2-[(2-fluorophenyl)methyl]-3-(2-fluorospiro[4,5-dihydrothieno[2,3-c]pyran-7,4'-piperidine]-r-yl)-/V,/V-dimethyl-propanamide, (RO Tracer). These measurements are made without the need for a radiolabeled tracer as previously published for other receptors with modifications (Chernet E, Martin LJ, Li D, Need AB, Barth VN, Rash KS, Phebus LA. Use of LC/MS to assess brain tracer distribution in preclinical, in vivo receptor occupancy studies: dopamine D2, serotonin 2A and NK-1 receptors as examples. Life Sci. 78(4):340-6, 2005.).<br>
A positive correlation has been established between central nociceptin/ORL I RO and efficacy in the modulation of the feeding behavior and forced swim test in rodents. Central nociceptin/ORL 1 RO is measured at 6 or 24 hours following oral administration of the test compound to rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) are treated orally with a test compound, or vehicle (20% Captisol, 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.0). At 6 or 24 hours following administration of test compound/vehicle, all animals are administered an intravenous, 3 ug/kg dose of RO Tracer. It is at the time of RO Tracer administration that RO is considered to be measured. Forty minutes after RO Tracer administration, rats arc sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the hypothalamus is removed. The level of RO Tracer is measured in each tissue sample.<br>
The centrally active literature reference standard (-)-c/s-l-methyl-7-[[4-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)piperidin-l-yl]methyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-benzocycloheptcn-5-ol (SB612111, see Magdalena and Heisler, supra), a potent nociceptin/ORL 1 receptor selective antagonist, is used as a positive control to establish the RO Tracer level associated with 100% nociceptin/ORLl RO. SB612111 is administered intravenously at a dose of 30 mg/kg 1 hr. prior to RO Tracer (a dose that results in approximately 100% RO of hypothalamic nociceptin/ORL 1 receptors).<br>
Hypothalamic samples are homogenized in 4 volumes (w/v) of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 16 min. Supcrnatants are collected and diluted to a final volume of 0.3 mL with sterile water. Measurement of the RO Tracer is carried out using an Agilent model 1200 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Palo<br>
 <br>
Alto, CA) and an API 4000 mass spectrometer. The chromatographic separation uses a 2.1 X 50 mm CI8 column (Agilent part number 971700-907) and a mobile phase consisting of 38% acetonitrile in water with an overall 0.1% formic acid content. Detection of RO Tracer is accomplished by monitoring the precursor to product ion transition with a mass to charge ratio (m/z) of 435 to 239, with levels quantified by comparison to standards prepared in brain tissue homogenates. Zero percent RO is calculated as the level of RO Tracer in the hypothalamus of vchicle-pretreated animals, which represents the sum of nonspecific and specific binding (all receptors available to the tracer). The lower level of RO Tracer in animals pretreatcd with the very high intravenous dose of SB612111, the positive control group, represents the nonspecific binding and is assigned the value of 100% occupancy (no receptors available to the tracer). The level of RO Tracer found in hypothalamus from the test compound treated group is linearly interpolated between these two points to calculate RO for the test compound.<br>
Exemplified compounds are tested essentially as described above and are found to have high receptor occupancy at the ORL-1 receptor. Receptor occupancies for exemplified compounds are found to be between about 40 and about 130 % for 3 mg/kg dose after 6 hr., or between about 20 and about 96% RO for 3 mg/kg dose after 24 hr. The receptor occupancies for the compounds of Examples 62, 23 and 53 are assayed essentially as described above for 3 mg/kg dose after 6 hr. and are found to have 104, 80 and 83% RO, respectively. As such, it is expected that the compounds of the present invention have favorable bioavailability and penetration into the CNS to the targeted ORL-1 receptors.<br>
hERG channel activity<br>
Blockade of K1-channel conductance in the heart is associated with cardiotoxicity in the form of QT-wavc prolongation. The affinity (Ki) of the exemplified nociccptin receptor antagonists for the human ERG (hERG) K+ channel is determined in HEK293 cells expressing cloned hERG using the hERG channel antagonist radioligand [3H]astcmizole (2 nM final assay concentration) according to well known procedures (sec for example FinlaysonK, et al. (Eur J Phajtnacol. 412(3):203-12, 2001) [3H]Astemizole<br>
 <br>
binding assays are performed at the contract research company Cerep (Paris France) according to standard procedures.<br>
Examples 62, 23, and 53 are assayed essentially as described above and are found to have low activity, with Kj's of 6.08, 1.21, and 8.6 uM respectively. Comparison of the in vivo plasma concentration necessary to produce 80 percent RO (ECso RO) of nociceptin/ORL 1 receptors in the CNS for the compound of example 62 is approximately 41 nM. As such, there is a large separation between the concentrations needed to produce physiologically relevant in vivo receptor occupancy of nociceptin/ORL 1 receptors and the concentrations needed for hERG K+-channel activity. Therefore, physiologically relevant doses of the compounds of the invention are not expected to substantially interact with hERG sites in vivo, and thus are expected to have no substantial effect on QT prolongation.<br>
Forced-Swim Test in Mice (mFST)<br>
mFST is an established in vivo assay for antidepressant activity (Li et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 319(l):254-9, 2006.). Mice treated with known clinically effective antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or tricyclic antidepressants) exhibit the behavior of reduced time spent immobile after being placed in a water tank, a behavior associated with despair. The mFST was used to evaluate potential antidepressant-like activity of novel nociceptin/ORLl antagonists according to previously published methods (Li et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 319(l):254-9, 2006.). Briefly, male NIH-Swiss mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) weighing between 25-30 g are used. Group housed animals are removed from the vivarium to the testing area in their own cages and allowed to adapt to the new environment for at least 1 hour before testing. Alternatively, male 129S6 wild type and nociceptin/ORLl receptor knockout mice were used to confirm dependence of the response to compound was nociceptin/ORLl receptor dependent. All compounds arc prepared in 20% Captisol, 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.0 on the day of use. Mice are placed in a cylinder (diameter: 10 cm; height: 25 cm) filled with 6 cm of water (22-25°C) for 6 min. The duration of immobility during the last 4 min. of the 6 min. period of the test was scored. A mouse is<br>
 <br>
recorded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above water.<br>
Representative compounds are tested essentially as described above and are found to significantly reduce immobilization times in wild type mice. The compounds of Examples 62, 23, and 53, are assayed essentially as described above and are found to have ED«,'s of 24.9, 9.5, and 12.9 mg/Kg respectively, with maximum effects of 45%, 58%, and 54% reductions in immobilization time, respectively. Therefore compounds of the present invention arc expected to have antidepressant activity in vivo.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other known antidepressants to produced enhanced efficacy. The compound of Example 62 is tested essentially as described above in combination with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine and is found to significantly further reduce immobilization time over cither fluoxetine or the compound of Example 62 alone. Sec Table 4 below.<br>

* Statistically significant reduction over vehicle, Ex 62 alone, and fluoxetine alone.<br>
Yet further, these effects of reduced immobilization times are not observed when ORL-1 knockout mice, a strain of mice engineered to lack the ORL-1 receptor, are used, showing that the effect is indeed mediated by the ORL-1 receptor. The compound of<br>
 <br>
Example 62 is tested essentially as described above using wild type mice in one arm of the study and ORL-1 knockout mice in a second arm of the study, and is found to significantly reduce the immobilization time in the wild type mice, but showed no effect in the knockout mice. A norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, imiprimine, is run as a positive control and is found to reduce immobilization times in both the wild type and knockout mice to an equivalent degree, showing that the behavioral effect mediated by the norepinepherine reuptake mechanism is intact in the knockout mouse strain.<br>
Blockade of Fasting-Induced Hvperphagia in mice.<br>
Blockade of fasting-induced hyperphagia in rodents is an accepted model for hyperphagic eating disorders. (Hollopeter G, Erickson JC, Seeley RJ, Marsh DJ, Palmiter RD. Response of neuropeptide Y-deficient mice to feeding effectors. Regul Pept. 1998 Sep 25;75-76:383-9.) All experiments are performed on naive twelve-week old male wild type and ORL knockout mice maintained on a 129S6 inbred background. Mice are individually housed a minimum of 3 days prior to the onset of testing to eliminate any effects of stress due to the change from group to individual housing. Three mice/genotype are randomly assigned to each treatment group on the test day. Pre-fast body weight measurements are taken, and food is then removed from cages overnight. Mice are fasted for approximately 15 hr. The next morning, the mice are given one of three doses of drug or vehicle via oral gavage 30 min. prior to gaining access to food. Drugs are dissolved in 20% Captisol dissolved in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.0. Measurements of body weight are taken immediately prior to drug treatment or 24 hr. after access to food is restored. Tt is worth noting that all mice independent of genotype lose ~5-10% body weight following overnight fast. Measurements of food intake are recorded 1 hr following access to food, as indicated, by weight of food remaining at 1 hr. It should be noted that food intake measured is during the light phase, a time during which mice are typically at rest and not normally eating. Following initial testing, mice are rested for 1 week with access to unlimited chow. Following the week rest, mice are retested according to the latin-square design shown in Table 5.<br>

Representative compounds are tested essentially as described above and are found to significantly reduce fasting-induced hyperphagia in mice. Examples 62, 23, and 53, are assayed essentially as described above and are found to substantially block fasting-induced hyperphagia. The effect was not observed in ORL-1 knockout mouse strain, demonstrating that the effect is mediated through the ORL-1 receptor. The 5-HT2C agonist, mCPP is used as a positive control and is found to significantly reduce fasting induced hyperphagia equally in both wild type mice and the ORL-1 knockout mouse strain. As such, it is expected that the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of overweight and/or obesity and/or for weight maintenance, as for example the treatment of binge eating.<br>
Rat Dural Plasma Protein Extravasation (PPE) Model - Oral Dosing Protocol<br>
All test compounds are prepared in a vehicle solution containing 20% Captisol in 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.0). The positive control compound, sumatriptan, is dissolved in saline. Male Sprague-Dawley rats from Harlan Laboratories (250 to 350 g), that have been fasted overnight, are dosed with test compound, sumatriptan or vehicle by oral gavage (2 mL/kg). Fifty min. post-dose the rats are anesthetized with Nembutal (60 mg/kg, ip) and placed in a stereotaxic frame with the incisor bar set at -2.5 mm. Following a mid-line sagittal scalp incision, 2 pairs of bilateral holes were drilled through the skull (3.2 mm posteriorly, 1.8 and 3.8 mm laterally, all coordinates referenced to bregma). Pairs of stainless steel stimulating electrodes (Rhodes Medical Systems Inc), insulated except at the tips, are lowered through the holes in both hemispheres to a depth of 9.2 mm below the dura.<br>
A solution of fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) (FITC-BSA) (20 mg/kg, iv), is injected into the femoral vein 2 minutes<br>
 <br>
prior to electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion to function as the marker for protein extravasation. Sixty minutes following dosing with test compound or vehicle, the left trigeminal ganglion is electrically stimulated for 5 minutes at a current intensity of 1.0 mA (5 Hz, 5 minutes duration).<br>
Five minutes following stimulation, the rats are killed by exsanguination with 40 mL of saline which also rinses residual F1TC/BSA out of the blood vessels. The top of the skull is removed to collect the dural membranes. The membrane samples are removed from both hemispheres, rinsed with water, and spread flat on microscope slides. The slides are dried for 15 minutes on a slide warmer and cover-slipped with a 70% glycerol/water solution.<br>
A fluorescence microscope equipped with a grating monochromator and a spectrophotometer is used to quantify the amount of FITC-BSA dye in each dural sample. The microscope is equipped with a motorized stage interfaced with a personal computer. This facilitates the computer-controlled movement of the stage, with fluorescence measurements at 25 points (500 ^m steps) on each dural sample. The extravasation induced by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion is an ipsilatcral effect (that is occurs only on the side of the dura in which the trigeminal ganglion is stimulated). This allowes the other (unstimulated) half of the dura to be used as a control. The extravasation ratio (that is the ratio of the amount of extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side compared to the unstimulated side) is calculated. Animals dosed with vehicle alone or an ineffective dose of the test compound have an extravasation ratio of approximately 2, while totally effective treatments result in a ratio of approximately 1.<br>
Results are expressed as mean values with standard errors of the mean (± SEM). All statistical evaluations are conducting utilizing ANOVA followed by comparison to the control group by Dunnett's Method. Statistical significance is assumed when p
The compound of Example 62 is tested essentially as described above and is found to effectively block extravasation in a dose dependent manner. (See Table 5 below.) As a result, it is expected that the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of migraine.<br>

Stability toward reactive metabolite formation<br>
Literature precedent suggests a correlation between reactive metabolite formation and clinical toxicities known as idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs), although a direct causal effect has not been established. Assuming that reactive metabolites may play a role in clinical IDRs, minimizing the potential for oxidative bioactivation has been proposed as a means of improving the overall safety profile of compounds containing structural features associated with such reactivity, (see Baillie, Thomas A., Approaches to the Assessment of Stable and Chemically Reactive Drug Metabolites in Early Clinical Trials, Chemical Research in Toxicology, vol 22(2) 2009.) To this end, representative compounds of the present invention and related compounds are screened using a rat hepatic microsomal trapping assay, using glutathione as an endogenous nucleophile, to understand the potential for oxidative bioactivation of the thienyl moiety. Of the compounds tested, those wherein R2a and R2b are hydrogen are found to show evidence of glutathione conjugate formation suggestive of oxidation on the thienyl moiety. Of the compounds tested, those wherein R2a and R2b are fluoro are found to not show glutathione conjugate formation. (See Table 3, below.) The lack of glutathione conjugate formation for the gem-difluoro containing molecules suggests that the gem-difluoro substituent reduces the inherent chemical propensity for bioactiviation as tested in the assay.

While it is possible to administer compounds employed in the methods of this invention directly without any formulation, the compounds are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient and at least one pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient. These compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and pulmonary. Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, ed., 21st ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., 2005).<br>
The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 0.1 to about 500 mg, more usually about 1.0 to about 200 mg, as for example between about 5 and 50 mg of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with at least one suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg, more usually from about 0.05 to 5.0 mg/kg, and as for example between 0.1 and<br>
 <br>
1.0 mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br>
