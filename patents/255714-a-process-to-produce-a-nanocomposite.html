				<td>The present invention relates to a process to produce a nanocomposite.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to low-permeability nanocomposites useful for air barriers, processes to produce the same, and their use in articles of manufacture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       Nanocomposites are polymer systems containing inorganic particles<br>
with at least one dimension in the nanometer range. Some examples of these are<br>
disclosed   in   US   6,060,549,   6,103,817,   6,034,164,   5,973,053,   5,936,023,<br>
5,883,173, 5,807,629, 5,665,183, 5,576,373, and 5,576,372.   Common types of<br>
inorganic particles used in nanocomposites are phyllosilicates, an inorganic<br>
substance from the general class of so called "nano-clays" or "clays".   Ideally,<br>
intercalation should take place in the nanocomposite, wherein the polymer inserts<br>
into the space or gallery between the clay surfaces.  Ultimately, it is desirable to<br>
have exfoliation, wherein the polymer is fully dispersed with the individual<br>
nanometer-size clay platelets.   Due to the general enhancement in air barrier<br>
qualities of various polymer blends when clays are present, there is a desire to<br>
have a nanocomposite with low air permeability;  especially a dynamically<br>
vulcanized elastomer nanocomposite such as used in the manufacture of tires.<br>
[0003]       The preparation of nanocomposites uses a number of methods to<br>
generate exfoliated clays. One of the most common methods relies upon the use<br>
of organically modified  montmorillonite  clays.     Organoclays  are  typically<br>
produced through solution based ion-exchange reactions that replace sodium ions<br>
that exist on the surface of sodium montmorillonite with organic molecules such<br>
as alkyl or aryl ammonium compounds and typically known in the industry as<br>
swelling or exfoliating agents. See, e.g., US 5,807,629, WO 02/100935, and WO<br>
02/100936.   Other background references  include US  5,576,373,  5,665,183,<br>
5,807,629, 5,936,023, 6,121,361, WO 94/22680, WO 01/85831, and WO 04/058874. One of the deficiencies of this method is the limited thermal stability of the amines. A second is the lack of chemical bonding with the matrix, often leading to poor mechanical properties and increased hysteresis. A third is the negative impact of the released amines and degradation products have on the transport properties.<br>
[0004] One method to improve the organoclay performance is to use functionalized polymers to treat the clay. This approach has been limited to materials that are soluble in water or to materials that can be incorporated into the polymerization reaction. This approach has been used to prepare nylon nanocomposites, using for example, oligomeric and monomeric caprolactam as the modifier. Polyolefin nanocomposites, such as polypropylene nanocomposites, have utilized maleic anhydride grafted polypropylenes to achieve some success in the formation of nanocomposites.<br>
[0005] For example, it is known to utilize exfoliated-clay filled nylon as a high impact plastic matrix, such as disclosed in US 6,060,549 to Li et al. In particular, Li et al. disclose a blend of a thermoplastic resin such as nylon and a copolymer of a CA to C-j isoolefin and a para-methylstyrene and a para-(halomethylstyrene), the blend also including nylon containing exfoliated-clays that are used as a high impact material. Further, Japanese Unexamined Application P2000-160024 to Yuichi et al. discloses a thermoplastic elastomer composition which can be used as an air barrier. The nanocomposite in Yuichi et al. includes is a blend similar to that disclosed in Li et al.<br>
[0006] Elastomeric nanocomposite innerliners and innertubes have also been formed using a complexing agent and a rubber, where the agent is a reactive rubber having positively charged groups and a layered silicate uniformly dispersed therein. See, for example, Kresge et al. US 5,665,183 and 5,576,373. This approach to improving air barriers has limited usefulness due to the need for preformed positively charged reactive rubber components.<br>
[0007] Nanocomposites have also been formed using non-ionic, brominated copolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene, and blends of these<br>
copolymers with other polymers. See, for example, Elspass et al., US 5,807,629, and US 6,034,164. It has been found that the efficiency of clay exfoliation, as determined by the relative permeability reduction, is not as high as that achieved in routes involving ionic interaction.<br>
[0008] As described above, these nanocomposites are made by mixing of elastomers and organoclays either at melt state or in solution; and, due to the hydrophobic nature of the polymer, the organoclays are typically modified to provide better interaction between the clays and the polymers. The modification process typically involves exchange of Na+ cations in the inorganic clay with organic modifiers such as tetra alkyl ammonium salts. The process is expensive and most modified clays are not exfoliated in polymers or in organic solvent. [0009] Another reference of interest includes WO 98/03562. [0010] There is a need for a method to produce a polymer / clay nanocomposite with improved exfoliation of the clay. There is also need for a less costly method to produce polymer / clay nanocomposites using inorganic clay without modification.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The present invention prepares a clay-polymer nanocomposite via an organic aqueous emulsion wherein the polymer is provided in the organic phase, and the clay is provided in the aqueous phase.

Alternately, the isobutylene polymer can include an interpolymer of a C4 - C7 isoolefin (preferably isobutylene) and isoprene. The isobutylene polymer can include functional groups selected from halides, ethers, amines, amides, esters, acids, hydroxyls, and the like.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023] This invention describes a method of making polymer / clay nanocomposites using inorganic clay without modification. Clay is exfoliated when in aqueous solution. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by contacting an aqueous clay solution with an organic solution of polymers or functionalized polymers in micro-emulsions, the interaction between the exfoliated clay and polymers provides a driving force to keep the clay exfoliated when incorporated into a polymer matrix. An emulsifier or surfactant can also be used to enhance the dispersion and formation of the micro-emulsions. The process of the present invention enhances the exfoliation of clays and results in nanocomposites with further improved barrier properties. The resulting nanocomposites can be used as a master batch in blends with other polymers or elastomers. Definitions<br>

[0042] The halogenated elastomers in one embodiment of the invention are random elastomeric copolymers of a €4 to Cy isoolefin, such as isobutylene and a para-alkylstyrene comonomer, preferably para-methylstyrene containing at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer and also include functionalized interpolymers wherein at least some of the alkyl substituents groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen or some other functional group, hi another embodiment of the invention, the interpolymer is a random elastomeric copolymer of ethylene or a C3 to €5 a-olefin and a para-alkylstyrene comonomer, preferably para-methylstyrene containing at least 80%,<br>
more preferably at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer and also include functionalized interpolymers wherein at least some of the alkyl substituents groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen or some other functional group. Preferred materials may be characterized as interpolymers containing the following monomer units randomly spaced along the polymer chain: (Fig Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R10 and Rn are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, preferably Ci to €7 alkyl and primary or secondary alkyl halides and X is a functional group such as halogen. Preferably R10 and Rn are hydrogen. Up to 60 mole percent of the para-substituted styrene present in the interpolymer structure may be the functionalized structure (5) above in one embodiment, and in another embodiment from 0.1 to 5 mole percent. In yet another embodiment, the amount of functionalized structure (5) is from 0.4 to 1 mole percent.<br>
[0043] The functional group X may be halogen or a combination of a halogen and some other functional group which may be incorporated by nucleophilic substitution of benzylic halogen with other groups such as carboxylic acids; carboxy salts; carboxy esters, amides and imides; hydroxy; alkoxide; phenoxide; thiolate; thioether; xanthate; cyanide; nitrile; amino and mixtures thereof. These functionalized isoolefin copolymers, their method of preparation, methods of functionalization, and cure are more particularly disclosed in US 5,162,445, and in particular, the functionalized amines as described below.<br>
[0044] Most useful of such functionalized materials are elastomeric random interpolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene containing from 0.5 to 20<br>
mole percent para-methylstyrene, wherein up to 60 mole percent of the methyl substituent groups present on the benzyl ring contain a bromine or chlorine atom, preferably a bromine atom (para(bromomethylstyrene)), as well as a combination of para(bromomethylstyrene) and other functional groups such as ester and ether. These halogenated elastomers are commercially available as EXXPRO™ Elastomers (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston TX), and abbreviated as "BIMS".<br>
[0045] In a preferred embodiment, the functionality is selected such that it can react or form polar bonds with functional groups present in the matrix polymer, for example, acid, amino or hydroxyl functional groups, when the polymer components are mixed at high temperatures.<br>
[0046] These functionalized interpolymers have a substantially homogeneous compositional distribution such that at least 95% by weight of the polymer has a para-alkylstyrene content within 10% of the average para-alkylstyrene content of the polymer, as measured by the procedure described in US 5,162,445. Desirable interpolymers are also characterized by a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than 5, more preferably less than 2.5, a preferred viscosity average molecular weight in the range of from 200,000 up to 2,000,000 and a preferred number average molecular weight in the range of from 25,000 to 750,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography. [0047] The BIMS polymers may be prepared by a slurry polymerization of the monomer mixture using a Lewis acid catalyst, followed by halogenation, preferably bromination, in solution in the presence of halogen and a radical initiator such as heat and/or light and/or a chemical initiator and, optionally, followed by electrophilic substitution of bromine with a different functional moiety.<br>
[0048] Preferred BIMS polymers are brominated polymers that generally contain from 0.1 to 5 mole percent of bromomethylstyrene groups relative to the total amount of monomer derived units in the polymer. In another embodiment, the amount of bromomethyl groups is from 0.2 to 3.0 mole percent, and from 0.3 to 2.8 mole percent in yet another embodiment, and from 0.4 to 2.5 mole percent<br>
in yet another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 2.0 in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may be any combination of any upper limit with any lower limit. Expressed another way, preferred copolymers contain from 0.2 to 10 weight percent of bromine, based on the weight of the polymer, from 0.4 to 6 weight percent bromine in another embodiment, and from 0.6 to 5.6 weight percent in another embodiment, are substantially free of ring halogen or halogen in the polymer backbone chain. In one embodiment of the invention, the interpolymer is a copolymer of €4 to C? isoolefin derived units (or isomonoolefin), para-methylstyrene derived units and para-(halomethylstyrene) derived units, wherein the para-(halomethylstyrene) units are present in the interpolymer from 0.4 to 3.0 mole percent based on the total number of para-methylstyrene, and wherein the para-methylstyrene derived units are present from 3 weight percent to 15 weight percent based on the total weight of the polymer in one embodiment, and from 4 weight percent to 10 weight percent in another embodiment. In another embodiment, the para-(halomethylstyrene) is para-(bromomethylstyrene). [0049] The halogenated elastomer useful in the present invention may also include a halogenated butyl rubber component. As used herein, "halogenated butyl rubber" refers to both butyl rubber and so-called "star-branched" butyl rubber, described below. In one embodiment of the invention, the halogenated rubber component is a halogenated copolymer of a €4 to C? isoolefin and a multiolefin. In another embodiment, the halogenated rubber component is a blend of a polydiene or block copolymer, and a copolymer of a C4 to Cj isoolefin and a conjugated, or a "star-branched" butyl polymer. The halogenated butyl polymer useful in the present invention can thus be described as a halogenated elastomer comprising €4 to C? isoolefin derived units, multiolefin derived units, and halogenated multiolefin derived units, and includes both "halogenated butyl rubber" and so called "halogenated star-branched" butyl rubber. [0050] In one embodiment, the halogenated butyl rubber is brominated butyl rubber, and in another embodiment is chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers is described in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990),<br>
and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995). Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers are described by Edward Kresge and H.C. Wang in 8 KiRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993).<br>
[0051]	The  halogenated  rubber  component  of the  present  invention<br>
includes, but is not limited to, brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber, star-branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched brominated butyl (polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; isobutylene-bromomethylstyrene copolymers such as isobutylene/meta-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/para-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/chloromethylstyrene, halogenated isobutylene cyclopentadiene, and isobutylene/para-chloromethylstyrene, and the like halomethylated aromatic interpolymers as in US 4,074,035 and US 4,395,506; isoprene and halogenated isobutylene copolymers, polychloroprene, and the like, and mixtures of any of the above. Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber component are also described in US 4,703,091 and 4,632,963. [0052] More particularly, in one embodiment of the brominated rubber component of the invention, a halogenated butyl rubber is used. The halogenated butyl rubber is produced from the halogenation of butyl rubber. Preferably, the olefin polymerization feeds employed in producing the halogenated butyl rubber of the invention are those olefinic compounds conventionally used in the preparation of butyl-type rubber polymers. The butyl polymers are prepared by reacting a comonomer mixture, the mixture having at least (1) a C* to C? isoolefin monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, or conjugated diene, monomer component. The isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 weight percent by weight of the total comonomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 weight percent in another embodiment. The conjugated diene component in one embodiment is present in the comonomer mixture from 30 to 0.5 weight percent in one embodiment, and from 15 to 0.5 weight percent in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, from 8 to 0.5 weight percent of the comonomer mixture is conjugated diene.<br>
 [0053] The isoolefin is a €4 to Ce compound such as isobutylene, isobutene 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefm is a C4 to CM conjugated diene such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, cyclopentadiene, hexadiene and piperylene. One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer of the invention is obtained by reacting 92 to 99.5 weight percent of isobutylene with 0.5 to 8 weight percent isoprene, or reacting 95 to 99.5 weight percent isobutylene with from 0.5 to 5.0 weight percent isoprene in yet another embodiment. [0054] Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl rubber product described above. Halogenation can be carried out by any means, and the invention is not herein limited by the halogenation process. Methods of halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in US 2,631,984, 3,099,644, 4,554,326, 4,681,921, 4,650,831, 4,384,072, 4,513,116 and 5,681,901. In one embodiment, the halogen is in the so called n and IE structures as discussed in, for example, RUBBER TECHNOLOGY at 298-299 (1995). In one embodiment, the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 40 to 60°C using bromine (Br2) or chlorine (Cla) as the halogenation agent. The halogenated butyl rubber has a Mooney Viscosity of from 20 to 70 (ML 1+8 at 125°C) in one embodiment, and from 25 to 55 in another embodiment. The halogen content is from 0.1 to 10 weight percent based in on the weight of the halogenated butyl rubber in one embodiment, and from 0.5 to 5 weight percent in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the halogen weight percent of the halogenated butyl rubber is from 1 to 2.2 weight percent.<br>
[0055] In another embodiment, the halogenated butyl or star-branched butyl rubber may be halogenated such that the halogenation is primarily allylic in nature. This is typically achieved by such means as free radical bromination or free radical chlorination, or by such methods as secondary treatment of electrophilically halogenated rubbers, such as by heating the rubber, to form the allylic halogenated butyl and star-branched butyl rubber. Common methods of forming the allylic halogenated polymer are disclosed by Gardner et al. in US 4,632,963; US 4,649,178; US 4,703,091. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
halogenated butyl rubber is such that the halogenated multiolefm units are primary allylic halogenated units, and wherein the primary allylic configuration is present to at least 20 mole percent (relative to the total amount of halogenated multiolefm) in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole percent in another embodiment. This arrangement can be described as follows (6), wherein X is a halogen, desirably chlorine or bromine, and q is at least 20 mole percent based on the total moles of halogen in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole percent in another embodiment, and from 25 mole percent to 90 mole percent in yet another embodiment:<br>

These rubbers include, but are not limited to, natural rubbers, polyisoprene rubber, poly(styrene-co-butadiene) rubber (SBR), polybutadiene rubber (BR), poly(isoprene-co-butadiene) rubber (IBR), styrene-isoprene-butadiene rubber (SIBR), ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM), ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM), polysulfide, nitrile rubber, propylene oxide polymers, star-branched butyl rubber and halogenated star-branched butyl rubber, brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber, star-branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched brominated butyl (polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) and halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene), such as, for example, terpolymers of isobutylene derived units, p-methylstyrene derived units, and p-bromomethylstyrene derived units, and mixtures thereof.<br>
 [0070] A desirable embodiment of the secondary rubber component present is natural rubber. Natural rubbers are described in detail by Subramaniam in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 179-208 (Maurice Morton, Chapman &amp; Hall 1995). Desirable embodiments of the natural rubbers of the present invention are selected from Malaysian rubber such as SMR CV, SMR 5, SMR 10, SMR 20, and SMR 50 and mixtures thereof, wherein the natural rubbers have a Mooney viscosity at 100°C (ML 1+4) of from 30 to 120, more preferably from 40 to 65. The Mooney viscosity test referred to herein is in accordance with ASTM D-1646. [0071] Polybutadiene (BR) rubber is another desirable secondary rubber useful in the composition of the invention. The Mooney viscosity of the polybutadiene rubber as measured at 100°C (ML 1+4) may range from 35 to 70, from 40 to about 65 in another embodiment, and from 45 to 60 in yet another embodiment. Some commercial examples of these synthetic rubbers useful in the present invention are NATSYN™ (Goodyear Chemical Company), and BUDENE™ 1207 or BR 1207 (Goodyear Chemical Company). A desirable rubber is high cis-polybutadiene (cis-BR). By "high cis-polybutadiene", it is meant that 1,4-cis polybutadiene is used, wherein the amount of cis component is at least 95%. An example of a high cis-polybutadiene commercial product useful herein is BUDENE™ 1207. [0072] Rubbers of ethylene and propylene derived units such as EPM and EPDM are also suitable as secondary rubbers. Examples of suitable comonomers in making EPDM are ethylidene norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, as well as others. These rubbers are described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 260-283 (1995). Suitable ethylene-propylene rubbers are commercially available under the VISTALON™ tradename (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston TX). [0073] In another embodiment, the secondary rubber is a halogenated rubber as part of the terpolymer composition. The halogenated butyl rubber is brominated butyl rubber, and in another embodiment is chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers is described in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T.

Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber component are also described in US 4,703,091 and US 4,632,963.<br>
[0075] In one embodiment of the invention, a so called semi-crystalline copolymer ("SCC") is present as the secondary "rubber" component. Useful Semi-crystalline copolymers are described in WOOO/69966. Generally, the SCC is a copolymer of ethylene or propylene derived units and a-olefin derived units, the a-olefin having from 4 to 16 carbon atoms in one embodiment, and in another embodiment the SCC is a copolymer of ethylene derived units and a-olefin derived units, the a-olefin having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, wherein the SCC has some degree of crystallinity.

Fillers, Additives, and Curatives<br>
[0077] The composition of the invention may also include one or more filler components such as calcium carbonate, clay, mica, silica and silicates, talc, titanium dioxide, and carbon black. As used herein, fillers do not include inorganic particles forming part of the nanocomposite matrix, e.g. clay particles having a dimension in the nanometer range, but larger clay particles can be used as a filler in the nanocomposites, if desired. In one embodiment, the filler is carbon black or modified carbon black. A preferred filler is semi-reinforcing grade carbon black present at a level of from 10 to 150 phr of the blend, more preferably from 30 to 120 phr. Useful grades of carbon black as described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 59-85 (1995) range from N110 to N990.

bis maleimide), Zisnet (2, 4, 6- trimercapto- 5 triazine), ZDEDC (zinc diethyl<br>
dithiocarbamate)  and other dithiocarbamates,  Tetrone A (dipenta-methylene<br>
thiuram hexasulfide), Vultac-5  (alkylated phenol disulfide),  SP1045  (phenol<br>
formaldehyde resin), SP1056 (brominated alkyl phenol formaldehyde resin),<br>
DPPD.   (diphenyl phenylene diamine), salicyclic acid (o-hydroxy benzoic acid),<br>
wood rosin  (abietic acid),  and TMTDS  (tetramethyl thiuram disulfide)  in<br>
combination with sulfur.   The composition may also be cured using ultraviolet<br>

[0079]       The compositions of the invention may also contain other conventional<br>
additives  such  as  dyes,  pigments,   antioxidants,  heat  and  light  stabilizers,<br>
plasticizers, oils and other ingredients as known in the art.<br>
[0080]       Blending of the fillers, additives, and/or curative components may be<br>
carried out by combining the desired components and the nanocomposite of the<br>
present invention in any suitable mixing device such as a Banbury™ mixer,<br>
Brabender™ mixer or preferably a mixer/extruder and mixing at temperatures in<br>
the range of 120°C up to 300°C under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the<br>
components to become uniformly dispersed within the polymer to form the<br>
nanocomposite.<br>
[0081]       The composition of this invention may be extruded, compression<br>
molded, blow molded or injection molded into various shaped articles including<br>
fibers, films, industrial parts such as automotive parts, appliance housings,<br>
consumer products, packaging and the like. The resulting articles can exhibit both<br>
high impact strength and low vapor permeability.  In particular, the composition<br>
described herein is useful for air barriers such as bladders, and automotive<br>
(including  truck,  commercial  and/or passenger)  or  aircraft  innerliners  and<br>
innertubes.<br>
Clays<br>
[0082]       The nanocomposites of the present invention can include swellable<br>
inorganic clay.    Swellable layered inorganic clay materials suitable for the<br>
purposes of this invention include natural or synthetic phyllosilicates, particularly<br>
smectic clays such as montmorillonite, nontronite, beidellite, volkonskoite, laponite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadite, kenyaite, stevensite and the like, as well as vermiculite, halloysite, aluminate oxides, hydrotalcite and the like. These layered clays generally comprise particles containing a plurality of silicate platelets having a thickness of 5 to 20A, preferably 8-12A tightly bound together at interlayer spacings of 4A or less, and contain exchangeable cations such as Na+, Ca+2, K+ or Mg+2 present at the interlayer surfaces.<br>
[0083] The layered clay can be exfoliated by suspending the clay in a water solution. Preferably, the concentration of clay in water is sufficiently low to minimize the interaction between clay particles and to fully exfoliate the clay. In one embodiment, the aqueous slurry of clay can have a clay concentration of between 0.1 and 5.0 weight percent; between 0.1 and 3.0 weight percent in other embodiments.<br>
[0084] The amount of clay or exfoliated clay incorporated in the nanocomposites in accordance with this invention is sufficient to develop an improvement in the mechanical properties or barrier properties of the nanocomposite, for example, tensile strength or oxygen permeability. Amounts of clay in the nanocomposite generally range from 0.5 to 10 weight percent in one embodiment, and from 1 to 5 weight percent in another embodiment, based on the polymer content of the nanocomposite. Expressed in parts per hundred rubber, the clay or exfoliated clay may be present from 1 to 30 phr in one embodiment, from 2 to 20 phr in another embodiment, and from 3 to 10 phr in another embodiment. Nanocomposite Processing<br>
[0085] The nanocomposites of the present invention can be produced by emulsion processes. In one embodiment, the process can comprise mixing an aqueous slurry of inorganic clay with a polymer solution (cement). The mixing should be sufficiently vigorous to form emulsions or micro-emulsions. In some embodiments, the emulsions can be formed as an aqueous solution or suspension in an organic solution. Standard methods and equipment for both lab and large-scale production, including batch and continuous processes may be used to produce the polymeric nanocomposites of the invention.<br>
 [0086] In certain embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising contacting Solution A comprising water and at least one layered clay with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one elastomer; and removing the solvent and water from the contact product of Solution A and Solution B to recover a nanocomposite.<br>
[0087] In some embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising contacting Solution A comprising water and at least one layered clay with Solution B comprising a solvent and at least one elastomer, wherein the contacting is performed in the presence of an emulsifier or surfactant. [0088] The emulsions of the present invention are formed by conventional emulsion technology, that is, subjecting a mixture of the hydrocarbon, water and surfactant, when used, to sufficient shearing, as in a commercial blender or its equivalent for a period of time sufficient for forming the emulsion, e.g., generally at least a few seconds. For general emulsion information, see generally, "Colloidal Systems and Interfaces", S. Ross and I. D. Morrison, J. W. Wiley, NY, 1988. The emulsion can be allowed to remain in emulsion form, with or without continuous or intermittent mixing or agitation, with or without heating or other temperature control, for a period sufficient to enhance exfoliation of the clay, from 0.1 to 100 hours or more in one embodiment, from 1 to 50 hours in another embodiment, and from 2 to 20 hours in another embodiment.<br>
[0089] hi certain embodiments, the emulsion is formed by subjecting the mixture to agitation using a high-shear mixer.<br>
[0090] When used, the surfactant concentration is sufficient to allow the formation of a relatively stable emulsion. Preferably, the amount of surfactant employed is at least 0.001 weight percent of the total emulsion, more preferably about 0.001 to about 3 weight percent, and most preferably 0.01 to less than 2 weight percent.<br>
[0091] Cationic surfactants useful in preparing the emulsions of this invention include tertiary amines, diamines, polyamines, amine salts, as well as quaternary ammonium compounds. Non-ionic surfactants useful in preparing the emulsions of this invention include alkyl ethoxylates, linear alcohol ethoxylates, alkyl<br>
glucosides, amide ethoxylates, amine ethoxylates (coco-, tallow-, and oleyl- amine ethoxylates for example), phenol ethoxylates, and nonyl phenol ethoxylates. [0092] In other embodiments, a nanocomposite is produced by a process comprising mixing an aqueous slurry of inorganic clay with a polymer solution wherein the polymer comprises amine-functionalized monomer unit described by the following:<br>
(Fig Removed)<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1.0 and R11 are the same or different and are one of hydrogen, a Ci to €7 alkyl, and primary or secondary alkyl halides; and wherein R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, Ci to €20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls, substituted Ci to €20 alkyls, alkenes or aryls, Ci to Cao aliphatic alcohols or ethers, Ci to Cao carboxylic acids, nitriles, ethoxylated amines, acrylates, esters and ammonium ions. The functional groups and optional components are as described above in the indicated amounts.<br>
[0093] In one embodiment, the elastomer and functionalized amine are combined in a first step, followed by emulsification with an aqueous slurry comprising at least one clay.<br>
[0094] In certain embodiments, at least one of R2, R3 and R4 can be a Ci to Cao aliphatic alcohol or ether. In these embodiments, the amine functionalized polymer can act as a self-emulsifier, negating or minimizing the need for additional surfactant or emulsifier to form a stable emulsion. The amine-functionalized polymer can enhance the extraction of the clay from the aqueous phase and promote exfoliation of the clay. In certain embodiments, the functional group can be N-methyldiethanolamine, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, triethanolamine, or combinations thereof. By contacting an aqueous clay slurry<br>
with organic solution of functionalized polymers in micro-emulsions, the interaction between the exfoliated clay and polymers, especially functionalized ionic polymers, provides a driving force to keep the clay exfoliated in the polymer matrix (as illustrated in Figure 1), enhancing the exfoliation of the clays and resulting in nanocomposites with improved barrier properties. [0095] The nanocomposite formed in the emulsion process can be recovered by processes such as, for example, by precipitating the polymer from solution, recovering the precipitated polymer / clay nanocomposite from the solvent, antisolvent, and water, and drying the recovered nanocomposite. Alternatively, the organic solvent can be vaporized with steam and the resulting polymer slurry passed through a series of extruders to dry the nanocomposite. Other processes to recover the nanocomposite can also be used; the scope of the present invention is not limited to any particular recovery processes.<br>

Integrated Halogenation of Butyl Rubbers and Nanocomposite Processing [0106] In forming the nanocomposite by the process above, the ionic functionality in the polymer exhibits strong ionic interactions, and thus the amount of functionality that may be introduced is limited. A high degree of functionality could lead to gel formation and to unprocessable polymer. The process as illustrated in Figure 2 and described herein can maximize intercalation and exfoliation of the clay in a polymer product. A solution 10 of rubber in hexane or other solvent is contacted with halogen 12 under vigorous mixing in a halogenation reactor 14, producing reactor effluent stream 16. The halogenated rubber solution 16 is then neutralized with aqueous caustic 18 in vessel 20. The halogenation of butyl rubbers is described in detail in US 4,074,035, 5,071,913, 5,286,804, 5,182,333 and 6,228,978, and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY, 298 - 300 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995).<br>
[0107] The neutralized halogenated rubber stream 22 can be divided into two portions 24, 26. Halogenated rubber portion 24 is reacted with functionalizing agent 28 in vessel 30. The rubber can be functionalized with an amine, for example, as described above. Because a high degree of functionality in the finished product is not desirable, stream 24 can be from 1 to 30% of stream 22; alternatively, stream 24 can be from 5 to 20% of stream 22; alternatively from 8 to 15% of stream 22.<br>
 [0108] The functionalized rubber effluent 32 from vessel 30 can be emulsified with aqueous inorganic clay slurry 34 in pump or vessel 36, as described above, forming the nanocomposite of the present invention which can be recovered from vessel 36 in stream 38. The nanocomposite stream 38 can then be combined with halogenated rubber portion 26.<br>
[0109] The combined stream 40 can be processed to separate the nanocomposite mixture from the solvents and water. As one example, the hexane in stream 40 can be vaporized with steam, and the hexane can be recovered and recycled. The rubber in water slurry can then be finished in a series of extruders and the dried rubber baled.<br>

Permeability Testing<br>
[0113] For each of the following examples, the nanocomposites formed were analyzed for permeability properties using the following method. In certain embodiments, 36 grams of the clay-rubber mixture were loaded into a Brabender® mixer at a temperature of 130 - 145°C and mixed with 20 grams of carbon black (N660) for 7 minutes. The mixture was further mixed with a curatives package of 0.33 g stearic acid, 0.33 g of ZnO (Kadox 911 obtained from CP Hall, Chicago, IL), and 0.33 g MBTS at 40°C and 40 rpm for 3 minutes. The resulting rubber compounds were milled, compression molded and cured at 170°C. All specimens were compression molded with slow cooling to provide defect-free pads. A compression and curing press was used for rubber samples. Typical thickness of a compression molded pad was around 15 mil (38.1 microns). Using an Arbor press, 2-in. (5 cm) diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for permeability testing. These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 60°C overnight prior to the measurement. The oxygen permeation measurements were done using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40°C under the principle of R. A. Pasternak et al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-2<br>
467 (1970). Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with vacuum grease. Ten psig (0.07 MPa(g)) nitrogen was kept on one side of the disk, whereas the other side was 10 psig (0.07 MPa(g)) oxygen. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, the increase in oxygen concentration was monitored over time. The time required for oxygen to permeate through the disk, or for oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, was recorded and used to determine the oxygen permeability. Permeability was measured as oxygen transmission rate on a Mocon WX-TRAN 2/61 at 40°C. Where multiple samples were prepared using the same procedure, permeation rate results are given for each sample.<br>
