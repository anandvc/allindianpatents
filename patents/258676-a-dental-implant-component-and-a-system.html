Application No. 60/678,095, filed May 5, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby<br>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to dental implants and, more particularly,<br>
methods and devices for installing a dental implant.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Restoration of an edentulous area of the mouth serves multiple functions, including<br>
improved aesthetics, improved mastication, maintenance of crestal bone, and providing for<br>
an occlusal stop for a reproducible bite. Restoration can be accomplished using a standard<br>
bridge, a removable appliance (a partial or full denture), or a dental implant.<br>
Dental implantation is a procedure for replacing a missing tooth using a dental<br>
implant. The placement of the implant is usually accomplished in four stages. In a first<br>
stage, a dentist reviews radiographs and dental models to determine the proper placement<br>
and axial alignment of the implant. In a second stage, a dental surgeon accesses the bone<br>
through the mucosal tissue. With the use of a prefabricated stint, the surgeon drills or bores<br>
out the maxillary or mandibular bone. The implant is then either pressed or screwed into<br>
the bone. A healing cap is typically then placed over the implant and the surrounding<br>
mucosal tissues are sutured over the healing cap. This provides for a biologically closed<br>
system to allow osteointegration of bone with the implant. Complete osteointegration<br>
typically takes anywhere froan four to ten months.<br>
Stage three, involves a second surgical procedure during which the dental surgeon<br>
makes an incision in the mucosal tissue to expose the osteointegrated implant. The healing<br>
cap is removed and a temporary abutment, having a height at least equal to the thickness of<br>
the gingival tissue or a final prosthetic abutment, is coupled to the implant. Once the<br><br>
abutment is secured an immediate mold or impression may be taken. In a modified<br>
procedure, the impression may be taken within one to two weeks after stage three. The<br>
impression is used to record the axial position and orientation of the implant, which is then<br>
reproduced in a stone or plaster analogue of the patient's mouth. The main objective of the<br>
impression is to properly transfer the size and shape of adjacent teeth in relation to the<br>
permanently placed implant and the precise configuration and orientation of the abutment<br>
to the dental technician. The plaster analogue provides the laboratory technician with a<br>
precise model of the patient's mouth, including the orientation of the implant fixture<br>
relative to the surrounding teeth. Based on this model, the technician constructs a final<br>
restoration. Stage four, in the restorative process, involves replacing the temporary healing<br>
abutment with the final restoration.<br>
As noted above, during stage three, a mold or impression is taken of the patient's<br>
mouth to accurately record the position and orientation of the implant site and to provide<br>
the information needed to fabricate the restorative replacement and/or intermediate<br>
prosthetic components. There are several conventional methods for talcing this impression.<br>
One method involves a conventional transfer coping. Transfer copings have an<br>
impression portion adapted to form a unique or indexed impression in the impression<br>
material and a base portion having mating indexing means adapted to mate with the<br>
exposed indexing means of the implant or prosthetic abutment. In use, the transfer coping<br>
is temporarily secured to the exposed proximal end of the implant fixture such that the<br>
mating indexing means of the impression coping and implant are interlocldngly mated to<br>
one another. Typically, a threaded screw or bolt is used to temporarily secure the transfer<br>
coping to the implant fixture.<br>
Once the impression coping is secured to the implant fixture, an impression of the<br>
transfer coping relative to the surrounding teeth is taken. Typically, this involves a "U"<br>
shaped tray filled with an impression material that is placed in the patient's mouth over the<br>
implant site. The patient bites down on the tray, squeezing the impression material into the<br>
implant site and around the transfer coping. Within a few minutes, the impression material<br>
cures or hardens to a flexible, resilient consistency. The impression tray is then removed<br>
from the patient's mouth to reveal an impression of the implant site and the transfer coping.<br>
The restorative dentist then removes the transfer coping from the patient's mouth and<br><br>
transfers the transfer coping back into the impression material, being careful to preserve the<br>
proper orientation of the indexing means.<br>
Another method typically involves a conventional pick-up coping. Pick-up copings<br>
are similar to the transfer copings described above; except that a piclc-up coping typically<br>
includes an embedment portion adapted to be non-removably embedded within the<br>
impression material. Typically, the embedded portion comprises a protuberant "lip" or<br>
similar embedment projection at a coronal portion of tho coping. This allows for<br>
"grabbing" or traction of the impression material as the tray is being removed from the<br>
patient's mouth. The piclc-up copings are "picked up" and remain in the impression<br>
material when the tray is removed from the patient's mouth.<br>
Yet another method for talcing an impression involves an impression or transfer cap.<br>
Impression or transfer caps are placed over or on the built-up part of the abutment or the<br>
implant and remain in the impression material when the tray is removed. There are several<br>
different types of transfer caps. One type of transfer cap has a tapered inner surface, which<br>
is adapted in form and size to the built-up part or abutment of the implant. This cap has an<br>
inner surface, which has indentations or slots, which correspond to indentation or slots<br>
present on the abutment. The cap is attached to the abutment with resilient flaps or<br>
tongues. An example of such a cap is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,123 to Meiers et al.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A disadvantage of the type of cap described in Meiers et al. is that the cap attaches<br>
to the abutment of the implant via the flaps, which extend over the shoulders of a conical<br>
area of the abutment. Because the shoulders of the abutment are next to the gum line, it is<br>
difficult to position the flaps over the shoulders. Moreover-, the location of the shoulders<br>
next to the gum line may result in the incomplete seating of the transfer cap on the<br>
shoulders, causing the transfer cap to disengage from the abutment before the impression is<br>
taken. Additionally, because the patient's gum line may be sensitive due to the insertion of<br>
the implant, contact between the transfer cap and the gum line can produce discomfort or<br>
pain in the patient. Therefore, there is a need for an improved transfer cap.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a dental implant component<br>
includes a distal end that includes a top surface and a proximal end that defines an opening.<br>
An inner surface of the component defines an internal cavity. At least one resiliently<br>
deflectable prong is disposed in the internal cavity. The prong is configured to releasingly<br><br>
engage a groove formed in a boro of a prosthetic abutment. The component further<br>
comprising elongated protrusions positioned within the inner surface configured to engage<br>
grooves formed on an outer surface of the abutment,<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a dental implant system,<br>
comprises a dental implant, an abutment and a mating component. The abutment<br>
comprises an upper region and an inner bore having an engagement feature positioned<br>
therein. The mating component has proximal end that defines an opening and an inner<br>
surface that defines an internal cavity for receiving the upper region of the abutment. A<br>
complementary engagement feature is disposed in the internal cavity and is configure to<br>
releaseably engage the engagement feature within the inner bore.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a method of coupling a<br>
dental component to an abutment of a dental implant system. A dental component having<br>
an internal cavity is positioned over an upper portion of an abutment. And the dental<br>
component is pressed onto the abutment until an engagement feature within the internal<br>
cavity of the abutment engages a complementary engagement feature within a bore of the<br>
abutment.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The embodiments described herein relate to methods and devices that relate to<br>
protecting and/or taking an impression of an abutment, which is coupled or formed with a<br>
dental implant. FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a dental implant 10,<br>
which will be used to illustrate certain features and aspects of the present invention. The<br>
dental implant 10 is described in detail in co-pending U.S. Application No. 09/670,708,<br>
filed September 27, 2000, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 1A, the implant 10 includes a body portion 12 and a collar 16.<br>
The body portion 12 is preferably tapered and includes threads 18 that mate to a preformed<br>
threaded hole or osteotomy formed in the patient's jawbone (not shown). However, it<br>
should be appreciated that the body portion 12 can also be configured so as to be self-<br>
tapping. It should also be appreciated that although the illustrated body portion 12 is<br>
tapered or conical, the body portion 12 can be substantially cylindrical. Moreover, in a<br>
modified embodiment, the body portion 12 can be unthreaded, as shown in FIG. ID, if the<br>
surgeon prefers to use an unthreaded implant 10. The implant 10 is preferably made of a<br>
dental grade titanium alloy, although other suitable materials can also be used.<br>
The collar 16 of the illustrated implant 10 is substantially cylindrical and has a top<br>
surface 24 that is substantially flat. The collar 16 is defined in part by a vertical side wall<br>
26 that in one embodiment is approximately 2 millimeters in axial length. In modified<br>
embodiments, the collar 16 may have a conical or tapered side wall and/or atop surface that<br>
24 is saddle-shaped or sloped.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 1C, the implant 10 also includes an internal socket 28. The<br>
internal socket 28 preferably includes a threaded chamber 30, a post receiving chamber 32,<br>
and an anti-rotation chamber 34.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 1B and 1C, the anti-rotation chamber 34 has a central<br>
portion having a substantially cylindrical shape. The anti-rotation chamber 34 further<br>
includes one or more radially extending rotational engagement portions each comprising a<br>
channel or lobe 36 extending from the top surface. 24 to the bottom of the indexing chamber<br>
34. In the illustrated implant, three engagement portions 36 are provided, each having a<br>
substantially half circular shape. As best seen in FIG. 1B, the engagement portions 36 are<br>
situated and evenly spaced around the perimeter of the anti-rotation chamber 34. Each<br><br>
engagement portion 36 may be spaced 120 degrees apart from each other. The anti-rotation<br>
chamber 34 is designed to mate with a corresponding anti-rotation region formed on<br>
various mating components, such as, for example, a final abutment. The anti-rotation<br>
chamber 34 primarily serves to prevent relative rotation between the mating component and<br>
the implant 10.<br>
It should he appreciated that in some embodiments the implant 10 does not include<br>
the anti-rotation chamber 34. However, the implant 10 preferably includes the anti-rotation<br>
chamber 34 because it helps to prevent the relative rotation between the mating components<br>
(e.g., a final abutment) and the implant 10. It should also be appreciated that the anti-<br>
rotation chamber 36 can be formed into a wide variety of other suitable shapes that may be<br>
used with efficacy, giving due consideration to the goals of providing anti-rotation of<br>
mating components, For example, the anti-rotation chamber 36 could comprise a<br>
hexagonal recess or protrusion that is situated on the top surface 24 of the implant 10.<br>
Nevertheless, the illustrated embodiment is preferred because it provides optimal clinical<br>
efficacy, ease of use and also minimizes stress concentrations within the anti-rotation<br>
chamber 34.<br>
The post-receiving chamber 32 lies between the anti-rotation chamber 34 and the<br>
threaded chamber 30. The post-receiving chamber 32 may have a diameter that is less than<br>
the diameter of the anti-rotation chamber 36. The post-receiving receiving chamber 32 may<br>
include a chamfered region 37, which is adjacent the threaded region 30. As will he<br>
explained below, the post-receiving chamber 32 is sized and dimensioned to receive a post<br>
that is attached to a mating dental component. The post and the post-receiving chamber 32<br>
provide lateral support, which prevents the mating component from tipping off the implant.<br>
However, it should be appreciated that in some embodiments the implant 10 can be formed<br>
without the post-receiving chamber 32.<br>
The threaded chamber 30 lies below the post-receiving chamber 32. The threaded<br>
chamber 30 is threaded and has a diameter that may be less than the post-receiving chamber<br>
32,<br>
FIGS. 2A-2F illustrate an embodiment of an abutment 38 having certain features<br>
and advantages according to an embodiment of present invention. The illustrated abutment<br>
38 is sized and dimensioned to mate with the implant 10 described above. As with the<br>
dental implant 10, the abutment 38 is preferably made of a dental grade titanium alloy,<br><br>
although other suitable materials can be used. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
implant 10 and abutment 38 are formed as a unitary structure, as further discussed below.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 2A, the outer surface of final abutment 38 preferably includes<br>
an upper region 40, a flared region 42, an anti-rotation region 44, and a post 46. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the upper region 40 is substantially smooth and tapered. The upper<br>
region 40 also has a top surface 48 that is substantially flat. Towards the bottom of the<br>
upper region (i.e., the portion nearest the flared region 42) is a flared portion 45 that flares<br>
outward towards a shoulder or ridge 47. The flared region 42 extends from the shoulder 47<br>
and connects the upper region 40 to a bottom surface 50, which preferably is substantially<br>
flat. A margin 49 (see FIG. 2B) defines an interface between the shoulder 47 and the flared<br>
portion 45.<br>
The upper region 40 also preferably includes a plurality of grooves 51. These<br>
grooves 51 help orient and prevent the rotation of mating component (not shown), such as,<br>
for example, a final restoration, which typically has an inner surface that matches or<br>
engages the shape of the upper region 40 of the abutment 38. Of course, those skilled in the<br>
art will readily appreciate that the upper region 40 and the grooves 51 can be formed into a<br>
variety of other shapes that can also provide an anti-rotational interface between the mating<br>
component and the abutment 38.<br>
It should be appreciated that although the illustrated cross-sections of the upper<br>
region 40 and flared region 42 are round in modified arrangements the cross-sections can be<br>
non-round. For example, the cross-section of the upper region and flared region can have a<br>
non-round cross-section that resembles the cross-section of a natural tooth. In addition, the<br>
shoulder 47 need not be horizontal as it is shown in the illustrated embodiment. For<br>
example, in modified embodiments, the shoulder can be sloped, saddle shaped etc.<br>
To permanently secure a Final restoration, cement can be applied to the upper region<br>
40 of the abutment 38. Alternatively, the final restoration can be coupled to the abutment<br>
38 by a screw (not shown). In such an arrangement, a screw hole (not shown) can be<br>
provided on the side of the abutment 38.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2B, the abutment 38 advantageously includes an inner bore 52<br>
that extends through the center of the abutment 38. The inner bore 52" is preferably defined<br>
by a first and second region 54, 56. The diameter of the first region 54 is preferably slightly<br>
larger than the diameter of the second region 56. Accordingly, a seat 58 is formed between<br><br>
the first and second regions 54," 56. The seat 58 supports a coupling screw 62 (see FIG-<br>
3 A), which will be described in detail below. Optionally, the second region 56 can include<br>
internal capture threads (not shown).<br>
With continued reference to FIG. 2E, the abutment 38 includes an engagement<br>
feature 3, which is configured to engage complementary engagement figure of another<br>
component. As will be explained in more detail below, the engagement feature 3 and<br>
complementary engagement feature can be configured to provide an interference fit, a<br>
friction fit, or a snap-fit between the two components. In the preferred embodiment, a snap<br>
fit is formed between the two components. As shown in FIG. 2F, the engagement feature<br>
comprises a circumferentially extending groove 53 formed on the surface of the first region<br>
54 of the inner bore 52. Preferably, the groove 53 has a trapezoidal cross-section, with one<br>
surface 53a of the groove 53 extending at a different angle relative to a base 53b of the<br>
groove 53 than a second surface 53c. In modified embodiments, the groove 54 can be<br>
circular, smooth, rectangular, etc. In still other embodiments, the engagement feature 3 can<br>
be configured in a different manner to mate with the engagement feature of the1 other<br>
component. For example, the engagement feature may comprise an annular protrusion or<br>
series of protrusions, prongs and the like that engage corresponding recesses and/or prongs<br>
on the other component.<br>
With reference back to FIG. 2A, the diameter of the bottom surface 50 is preferably<br>
approximately equal to the diameter of the top surface 24 of the implant 10. Extending<br>
from the bottom surface 50 is the anti-rotation region 44, which is sized and dimensioned to<br>
fit within the anti-rotation chamber 36 of the implant. Accordingly, as best seen in FIGS.<br>
2B and 2D, the anti-rotation region 44 is substantially cylindrical and includes three<br>
protrusions 60. The protrusions 60 preferably extend along the entire length of the anti-<br>
rotation region 44 and have a half circular shape. The protrusions 60 are arranged around<br>
the perimeter of the indexing region 44 approximately 120 degrees apart relative to the<br>
center axis of the final abutment 38.<br>
As with the anti-rotation chamber 36 of the implant 10, it should be appreciated that<br>
the abutment 38 can be configured without the anti-rotation region 44. However, it is<br>
preferred that the abutment 38 include the anti-rotation 44 because it helps to prevent<br>
relative rotation between the implant 10 and the final abutment 38. It should also he<br>
appreciated that the anti-rotation region 44 can be formed into a wide variety of other<br><br>
suitable shapes that may be used with efficacy to prevent rotation of the implant 10 and the<br>
final abutment 38.<br>
Below the indexing region 44 is the post 46. The post 46 is substantially cylindrical<br>
and is sized and dimensioned to fit within the post-receiving chamber 32 of the implant 10.<br>
As mentioned above, the post 36 provides lateral support to the abutment 38 when it is<br>
placed upon the implant 10. However, it should be appreciated in a modified embodiment<br>
the abutment 38 can be configured without the post 46.<br>
Turning now to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the coupling screw 62 is sized and dimensioned<br>
to extend through the inner bore 52 of the final abutment 38 and to couple the final<br>
abutment 38 to the implant 10. As with the final abutment 38, the coupling screw 62 is<br>
preferably made of a dental grade titanium alloy. However, other suitable materials can be<br>
used.<br>
The coupling screw 62 has an externally threaded lower region 64. The threaded<br>
lower region 64 is sized and dimensioned to engage the threads of the threaded chamber 30<br>
of the implant 10 (see FIG. 1C). The threaded lower region 64 can also engage; capture<br>
threads that can be formed on the second region 56 of the final abutment 38. In such an<br>
arrangement, the coupling screw 62 engages the capture threads so that the coupling screw<br>
62 does not become disassociated as the final abutment 38 is transferred and fitted to the<br>
patient's mouth.<br>
The illustrated coupling screw 62 also advantageously includes a hexagonal recess<br>
70 located within a head 72 of the screw 62. The hexagonal recess 70 allows for the<br>
insertion of a hexagonally shaped tool such as a conventional Allen ® wrench, which can<br>
be used to apply rotational force to the coupling screw 62. The head 72 also<br>
advantageously includes outer threads 74, which are formed on the outer surface 1.5 of the<br>
head 72. The purpose and function of the outer threads 74 will he described below.<br>
Alternatively, the threads 74 can be formed internally within the recess 70.<br>
In modified embodiments, the final abutment can be coupled to the.dental implant<br>
in other maimers. For example, the final abutment can include configured a threaded post<br>
that is adapted to be received within the threaded chamber 30 of the implant 10. One<br>
advantage of such an arrangement is that the final abutment can be attached to the implant<br>
without a coupling screw.<br><br>
FIGS. 4A-4F illustrate one embodiment of a healing cap 76, which can be used to<br>
cover the abutment 38 after, for example, stage two surgery. The healing cap 76 may be<br>
made of a synthetic polymer, such as, for example, polyester or Nylon. However, it should<br>
be appreciated that other suitable materials can also be used. The healing cap 76 is<br>
preferably white or close to natural tooth color so that it has a natural appearance when it is<br>
placed in the patient's mouth.<br>
The healing cap 76 includes an inner surface 77 which defines an internal cavity 78.<br>
The inner surface 77 defines a bottom opening 82, The inner surface 77 is sized and<br>
dimensioned such that the healing cap fits over the upper region 40 of the abutment 38.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 4A, the inner surface 77 preferably includes a stop for<br>
limiting advance of the healing cap 76 onto the abutment 38, such as, a base surface 84 that<br>
is sized and dimensioned to rest against the flanged portion 45 of the final abutment 38,<br>
See also FIG. 4C.<br>
Although not illustrated, the healing cap 76 may include a tissue retraction flange<br>
that is sized and dimensioned such that when the healing cap 76 is placed upon the<br>
abutment 38 it extends beyond at least the upper limit of the shoulder 47 of the: final<br>
abutment 38.<br>
As best seen in FIGS. 4A, 4D, and 4F, the healing cap 76 preferably has a<br>
complementary engagement feature 5 formed within the inner surface 77 and configured to<br>
engage the engagement features 3 of the abutment 38 depicted in FIG. 2E. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the complementary engagement feature 5 comprises a plurality of prongs 7,<br>
which include protrusions 9 configured to engage the recess 53 preferably in a snap-fit. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, the prongs 7 deflect inwardly as the prongs are advanced into the<br>
inner bore 52 and then expand and the protrusions 9 enter the recess 53. Of course, those of<br>
skill in the art will recognize other configurations for providing a snap fit between the two<br>
components. For example, the cap 76 may include a recess positioned on a post configured<br>
to engage a protrusion formed on the bore 52. In addition, as mentioned above, the features<br>
3, 5 can be configured for friction and/or interference fits. Preferably, the features 3, 5 are<br>
positioned on the abutment 37 and cap. 76 such that they are generally protected from<br>
materials within the mouth, In this manner, the features 3,5 are not damaged as they are<br>
inserted within the patient. In the illustrated embodiment, the features 3, 5 are protected by<br><br>
providing an engagement within the bore 52 and/or in a generally upper portion of the cap<br>
76 and abutment 38, distanced from the shoulder 47,<br>
As with the final abutment 38, it should be appreciated that although the illustrated<br>
cross-sections of the healing cap. 76 are round in modified arrangements the cross-sections<br>
can be non-round. For example, the cross-sections can have a non-round cross-section that<br>
resembles the cross-section of a natural tooth.<br>
In use, the surgeon typically first places the implant 10 into the patient's jawbone<br>
during stage two surgery. A healing cap is placed over the implant. The patient returns<br>
home for a first healing period, which is typically four to ten months, In stage three, the<br>
surgeon makes an incision to expose the implant 10 and removes the healing cap. The<br>
surgeon then couples the final abutment 38 to the implant 10 with the coupling screw 62.<br>
The surgeon then places the hearing cap 76 over the final abutment 38 and engages .the<br>
features 3, 5, on the abutment and healing cap respectively, to couple the healing cap 76 to<br>
the abutment 38. In the illustrated embodiment, the surgeon presses the healing cap 76 onto<br>
the abutment 38 until the features 3, 5 engage in a snap fit. Accordingly, the healing cap 76<br>
is held securely against the final abutment 38. The healing cap 76 helps to control the<br>
healing and growth of the patient's gum tissue around the implant site. The healing cap 76<br>
also improves the appearance of the patient's mouth and provides the patient with a<br>
temporary chewing surface. If desired, the healing cap 76 can also be used to support a<br>
temporary restoration and/or may itself be shaped in the form of a temporary restoration.<br>
The patient then returns home for a second healing period. The patient then returns<br>
to the surgeon. The surgeon can pry the healing cap 76 from the abutment 38. At this<br>
point, the surgeon takes the impression of the patient's mouth to record the position,<br>
orientation and shape of the abutment within the mouth. In a modified arrangement, the<br>
abutment 38 can be attached during a traditional stage two surgery. In such an<br>
arrangement, an impression of the final abutment 38 can also be made during stage two<br>
before the healing cap 76 is attached to the abutment 38. In still a modified arrangement, a<br>
temporary abutment preferably having a height at least equal to the thickness of the gingival<br>
tissue can be used during the first and/or second healing periods.<br>
In a modified embodiment, the dental implant and abutment can be combined into a<br>
single integral or permanently coupled component 200, which is shown in FIGS. 5A-5E. In <br>
this embodiment, the abutment 38' and implant 10' can be configured substantially as<br><br>
described above. According, the illustrated embodiment, the implant 10' has an inner bore<br>
52 comprising an upper region 54 and a lower region 56, which is preferably unthreaded.<br>
The upper region 54 preferably includes an engagement feature 3, which is a<br>
circumferentially extending groove 53 as described above. Additionally, the upper region<br>
54' has one or more anti-rotational features (e.g., longitudinally extending slots 55), which<br>
can be engaged by a tool (e.g., a wrench) for driving the implant 200 into the patient. The<br>
slots 55 extend between the groove 53 and the threaded lower region 56.<br>
The healing cap 76 can be coupled to the implant 200 as described above.<br>
FIGS. 6A-F illustrate one embodiment of an impression cap 120 having certain<br>
features and advantages according to the present invention. As will be explained below, the<br>
impression cap 120 can be used to take an impression of an abutment, such as the one<br>
described above. In this manner, the shape of the position and/or orientation of the<br>
abutment and the implant can be recorded. This information can then be used to construct a<br>
final restoration as is known in the art.<br>
The illustrated impression cap 120 comprises a body 122 with a proximal end 124<br>
and a distal end 126. The body 122 is preferably made of resilient moldable plastic and/or<br>
polymer, such as, for example, polycarbonate. The body 122 defines an inner surface 128,<br>
which forms an inner cavity 130. The inner cavity 130 is configured such that the<br>
impression cap 120 can fit over the upper region 40 of the abutment 38. As best seen in<br>
FIG. 6C, the inner surface 128 comprises a side wall 134 and roof 136.<br>
The impression cap 120 is preferably configured to engage the abutment 38.<br>
Specifically, the impression cap includes a complementary engagement feature 132, which<br>
can be configured as describe above for engaging the engagement feature 3 of the implant<br>
10,200. In the illustrated embodiment, the impression cap 120 engages the implant 10, 200<br>
in a snap fit that is achieved by providing the cap 120 with a plurality of resiliently<br>
deflectable prongs 150 with protrusions 152 configured to engage the recess 53 of an<br>
abutment, as depicted in FIGS. 2E-F, in a snap fit. Of course, as mentioned above, those of<br>
skill in the art will recognize other configurations for providing a snap fit between the two<br>
components. For example, the cap 120 may include a recess positioned on a post<br>
configured to engage a protrusion formed on the bore 52. In addition, as mentioned above,<br>
the features 3, 132 can be configured for friction and/or interference fits. Preferably, the<br>
features 3, 132 are positioned on the abutment 37 and cap 120 such that they are generally<br><br>
protected from materials within the mouth and in particular the impression material which<br>
is eventually placed around the cap 120. In this manner, the features 3, 150 are not<br>
damaged or inhibited.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6A-C and 6F, the impression cap 120 preferably includes<br>
one or more embedment features 160. As will be explained in more detail below, the<br>
embedment features 160 facilitate the gripping and retention of the impression cap 120<br>
within an impression tray. The one or more embedment features preferably define at least<br>
one interference surface 162, which faces lies generally transverse to a longitudinal axis<br>
164 of the impression cap. In the illustrated embodiment, the embedment feature 160<br>
comprises one or more flanges 166, which are positioned the distal end 126 of the main<br>
body 122. In certain embodiments, the flange(s) 166 may include a plurality of through<br>
holes 168 (see also FIG. 6B), which extends through the four corners of the flange 166.<br>
A plurality of elongated protrusions 180 are formed on the side wall and sized to<br>
engage the grooves 51 of the abutment 38,' when the impression cap 120 is positioned<br>
thereon. The protrusions 180 and grooves 51 thus mate to substantially prevent the rotation<br>
of the impression cap 120 relative to the abutment 38.<br>
The impression cap 120 has angled surfaces 182 at the proximal end 124 that is<br>
configured to abut against the flared portion 45 of the implant 10 when the impression cap<br>
120 is positioned thereon.<br>
It should be appreciated that, although the illustrated embodiments of the implant,<br>
abutment, healing cap, and impression cap have round cross-sections, in modified<br>
arrangements the cross-sections of one or more of these components can be can be non-<br>
round.<br>
In use, the impression cap 120 can be used to take an impression of the final<br>
abutment 38 and/or record the orientation of the implant 10. Such impression can be taken<br>
during stage two or stage three as deemed effective by the dental practitioner. The surgeon<br>
snaps the impression cap 120 onto the abutment 38. An impression is then preferably taken<br>
of the whole arch or quadrant if the patient's mouth. This typically involves using a U-<br>
shaped impression tray (not shown) that is filled with an impression material. The tray is<br>
inserted into the mouth over the impression cap 120. As such, the impression cap 120<br>
becomes embedded in the impression material. The interference surface 162 of the cap 120<br><br>
facilitates mechanically interloclcing between the impression material and the impression<br>
cap 120. Such interloclcing is further enhanced by the holes 168.<br>
Once the impression material is set, the tray 190 is removed from the mouth. The<br>
impression cap 120 remains embedded in the impression material 192 and is thus<br>
uncoupled from the abutment 38 as the tray 190 is removed. The tray is then sent to a<br>
dental laboratory and is used by a dental technician to fabricate a final restoration (i.e., a<br>
dental prosthesis). An analogue (described below) of the abutment can be placed within the<br>
impression cap, with the same axial orientation as the abutment 38 and the implant 10 in<br>
the patient's mouth. The impression tray is then filled or covered with dental stone or any<br>
modeling material. After the modeling material has set the model is separated from the<br>
impression. The model is an accurate reproduction of the implant site and allows the dental<br>
technician to fabricate the final restoration for the patient in the proper position in axial and<br>
rotational alignment.<br>
In one embodiment, the abutment, healing cap and/or transfer cap are sold and<br>
packaged together as a kit.<br>
Figures 7A-7D illustrate an exemplary analogue 400 of the abutment 38 or dental<br>
implant 200 described above described above with reference to FIGS. 2A-2F and FIGS.<br>
5A-5E The analogue 400 includes an upper region 402 that has substantially the same<br>
shape and size as the upper region 40 of the abutment 38. Accordingly, the upper region<br>
402 of the illustrated analogue 400 also includes a groove or recess 51. The analogue 400<br>
also includes a lower region 404, "which is configured to be retained within, by way of<br>
example, a stone plaster model of the patient's mouth as is known in the art.<br>
The analogue 400 also includes an inner bore 406 with an engagement feature 3,<br>
which can be configured as described above to engage complementary engagement figure<br>
of another component. In particular, as mentioned above, the analog can be inserted into<br>
the impression cap 120 so as to take the same axial orientation as the abutment 38 and the<br>
implant 10 in the patient's mouth. The impression tray is then filled or covered with dental<br>
stone or any modeling material. The lower region 404 of the analogue 400 is embedded<br>
into the modeling material. After the modeling material has set the model is separated from<br>
the impression. The model is an accurate reproduction of the implant site and allows the<br>
dental technician to fabricate the final restoration for the patient in the proper position in<br>
axial and rotational alignment.<br><br>
Figures 8A-D illustrate a coping 500 that can be used to fabricate the final<br>
restoration. The illustrated coping 500 is configured to mate with the exemplary abutment<br>
38 (or implant 300) and analogue 400 described above. Of course, those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that the illustrated coping can be modified to mate with abutments and<br>
analogues of different shapes and sizes.<br>
The coping 500 comprises a main body 502. The main body 502 includes an inner<br>
surface 506 that defines an internal cavity 504. The inner surface 506 is configured such<br>
that the coping 500 can fit over the upper region 402 of the analogue 400 and the final<br>
abutment 38 described above. Accordingly, the coping 500 includes at least one anti-<br>
rotation member 510, which is configured to mate with the recess 51 of the analogue and<br>
recess of the abutment so as to prevent rotation of the coping 500 with respect to the<br>
analogue 400 and/or the abutment 38.<br>
The inner surface can include includes one or more feet or standoffs (not shown).<br>
See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,672,871, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
The inner surface 506 also preferably includes a flanged portion 512. The flanged<br>
portion 512 is configured to rest upon a lower portion or shoulder of the analogue 400 and<br>
the abutment 38. Preferably, the flanged portion is sized and configured such that the<br>
coping is centered on the analogue.<br>
In one embodiment, the coping 500 is used with investment casting techniques to<br>
create a metal coping with an inner surface substantially similar to the inner surface 506 of<br>
the coping 500. In this method, the coping 500 is preferably made of plastic or another<br>
material suitable for investment casting. The technician applies, byway of example, wax to<br>
the outer surface 514 of the coping 500 to form a model of a metal coping. The technician<br>
removes the wax and the coping 500 from the analogue 400 and encases the combination in<br>
an investment material. The investment material is then heated to remove the wax and<br>
coping 500. The technician fills the investment material with a metal, such as, for example,<br>
gold or another suitable material. Once the metal solidifies, the investment material is<br>
broken to release the metal coping. To form the final restoration, a porcelain cover or other<br>
suitable tooth-like'material is attached to the metal coping using well known techniques.<br>
The metal coping provides structural strength and rigidity to the final restoration. The final<br><br>
restoration can be coupled to the abutment 38 or implant 300 using cement, bolts or other<br>
well-known techniques.<br>
In a modified embodiment, the coping 500 is made of material suitable for forming<br>
part of a final restoration, such as, for example, gold or a ceramic material Preferably, the<br>
material is a ceramic fusing metal material to which, by way of example, porcelain can be<br>
directly fused. The coping 500 has substantially the same shape and size as the plastic<br>
coping described above. Because the coping 500 is made of a fairly nigged material, the<br>
coping can form part of the final restoration. That is, a cover made of porcelain or other<br>
suitable material can be directly attached to the coping 500, thereby forming the final<br>
restoration.<br>
hi one embodiment, the abutment, healing cap, coping, analogue and/or transfer cap<br>
are sold and packaged together as a ldt.<br>
