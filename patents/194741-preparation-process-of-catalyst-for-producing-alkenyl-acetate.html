TITLE:  PREPARATION   PROCESS  OF  CATALYST   FOR   PRODUClNG ALKENYL ACETATES <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a preparation process of a catalyst comprising noble metals as main component and other metals as catalysis promoter in combination with an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound, supported on the outer surface of a carrier, and also relates to use of a catalyst prepared according to the process of the present invention, for producing alkenyl acetates through reaction of olefins, acetic acid and oxygen in vapor phase.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The industrial production of alkenyl acetates through reaction of olefins, oxygen and acetic acid in vapor phase has been performed in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst, which comprises noble metals, metals as catalysis promoter in combination with an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound supported on the outer surface of a carrier. This preparation process has been known for a long time and the key point of this process, the evenly distribution of metal components on the surface of a supporting catalyst to provide high yield, also has been widely discussed and studied, mostly based on changing the kind or relative composition of the metal components. However, no matter how the metal composition or its structure has changed, the basic structure of all catalysts for producing alkenyl acetates is<br>
1<br><br>
Ref. 21089-8<br>
essentially a spherical shape catalyst prepared by impregnating on a carrier with the palladium metal, a metal for promotina catalvsis. and an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound, wherein the metal for promoting catalysis is preferably gold and copper, and wherein the alkali or alkaline earth metal compound is preferably a potassium compound (USP 3939199, EP 0361484 and USP 466881 9). Earlier, the catalyst employed to produce vinyl acetate was prepared by impregnating palladium, gold and the like noble metals on the whole carrier (USP 3725680, 3743607); the catalyst employed to produce allyl acetate was prepared by impregnating palladium, copper and the like noble metals on the whole carrier (USP 391 7676). That is, the active noble metals were supported on the interiors and outer surface of a carrier. However, while the catalyst was prepared in this way, it was found in actual reaction that the reactants were scarcely able to efficiently diffuse into inner regions of the carrier, so that the interior active palladium and gold or copper metats were not able to be sufficiently utilized. In order to improve this drawback, in the preparation process of the catalyst for producing alkenyl acetates, usually, instead of impregnating palladium metal and a metal for promoting catalysis on the whole carrier, but to evenly impregnate on the surface of a carrier. That is, to impregnate palladium metal and the metal for promoting catalysis evenly on the surface layer of a carrier to form a spherical shape supported catalyst (USP 4087622). The preparation method was that the carrier was impregnated with the active metallic materials first, then these metal salts were precipitated by immersing in a solution containing an alkali or alkaline earth metal salts (USP 4048096, USP 3775342).<br>
2<br><br>
Ref. 21089-8<br>
Further, it was known that when preparing the catalyst with palladium and other metals as catalyst promoter in combination with an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound, a special carrier was used. This carrier was washed with acids before the impregnation and treated with bases after the impregnation (EP-A-0519435).<br>
Since palladium and the metal for promoting catalysis were non-homogeneous during the impregnation, which would result in the non-homogenous distribution on the surface of a carrier, therefore, many researches have been made on this problem (USP 4087622, USP 3822308 and British Patent 1521652). As a result, in the preparation of the catalyst for producing alkenyl acetates, the catalyst was essentially prepared by impregnating palladium and a metal for promoting catalysis, in combination with an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound on the surface of a spherical shape carrier. The preparation process generally was comprised of the following steps: (1) a carrier was impregnated with an aqueous solution of soluble palladium ions and metal ions for promoting catalysis; (2) the impregnated carrier was immersed in an alkali solution, so that the soluble palladium ions and metal ions for promoting catalysis were precipitated on the surface layer of the carrier and formed into insoluble oxidative state palladium and metal for promoting catalysis; (3) the treated carrier was washed with water to remove soluble ions produced during the precipitation; (4) the oxidative state palladium and metal for promoting catalysis supported on the treated carrier were then reduced to the metallic state; (5) the reduced carrier in (4) was impregnated with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
3<br><br>
Ref. 21089-8<br>
compound; and (6) the impregnated carrier in (5) was dried. Among these steps, conventionally, the reducing step (4) was performed by a reducing process using liquid reducing agents in liquid phase. However, since non-homogenous nature of palladium and the metal as catalysis promoter on the surface of the carrier, the catalyst prepared by this method is usually unsatisfactory.<br>
In order to resolve the above problem, in the preparation process of the catalyst for producing alkenyl acetates according to the present invention, the conventional reducing process utilizing liquid reducing agents in liquid phase is changed into a reducing process utilizing gaseous reducing agents in gaseous phase. As a result, the catalyst comprising palladium and a metal as catalysis promoter in combination with an alkali and alkaline earth metal compound supported on a carrier prepared by using this present invention has a high metal surface area and exhibits high catalytic activity, thus the catalytic efficiency and life of this heterogeneous catalyst are improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a preparation process of a catalyst which comprises a noble metal and a metal as catalysis promoter in combination with an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound, supported on the outer surface of a carrier. The preparation process comprises impregnating the carrier with a solution containing an oxidative state noble metal as the main catalyst and an oxidative state metal as catalysis promoter, reducing the oxidative state metals into the metallic state in gaseous phase with<br>

Ref. 21089-8<br>
a gaseous reducing agent under certain temperature, pressure and gas concentration, then impregnating the reduced carrier with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound. The metal components-supporting catalyst prepared by the process according to the present invention has a high surface area and exhibits high catalytic activity, which leads to increase the catalytic efficiency and life of this heterogeneous catalyst. The catalyst prepared in the present invention is suitable for producing alkenyl acetates through reaction of olefins, acetic acid and oxygen in vapor phase.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a preparation process of a catalyst which comprises a noble metal as main component and other metals as catalysis promoter in combination with an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound, all of which are supported on the outer surface of a carrier. The examples of the suitable carrier are alumina, silica gel, silica, active carbon, silicon carbide, diatomaceous earth, pumice and the like, while among them silica is preferable. The example of the noble metal is palladium; the examples of the metal as catalysis promoter are gold, copper, molybdenum, cadmium and magnesium, while among them gold and copper are preferable. The examples of the alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds are the hydroxides, acetates, nitrates and bicarbonates of potassium, sodium, cesium, magnesium, barium and the like, while among them potassium salts are preferable, and potassium acetate is even more preferable.<br>
The distinctive feature of the process according to the present<br>
5<br><br>
Ref. 21089-8<br>
invention is, in preparing the catalyst for producing alkenyl acetates, the conventional reducing process utilizing liquid reducing agents in liquid phase is changed into a reducing process utilizing gaseous reducing agents in gaseous phase to carry out the reduction of the oxidative state metals. After treatment with an alkali solution to transform the oxidative state noble metal and metal for promoting catalysis (which are supported on the carrier after the impregnation) into hydroxide state, these are reduced with suitable gaseous reducing agents in specific reductive conditions and transformed into the metallic state.<br>
The term "oxidative state" used herein according to the present invention means a metal in cationic state, for example, oxidative state palladium means Pd2+<br>
In the preparation process according to the present invention, after the metal components are supported on the surface layer of a carrier by means of conventionally well-known method, the heretofore un-reduced catalyst is placed in a reactor, and a gaseous reducing agent is used under suitable reducing conditions in gaseous phase to reduce the oxidative state metals into metallic state metals. While the examples of gaseous reducing agents used in the present invention are hydrogen and ethylene, hydrogen is preferable. In the reducing process, it is preferable to dilute the gaseous reducing agent with inert gas (such as nitrogen gas). The volume percentage of the reducing agent after dilution is in the range of 0.05 to 75%, and preferably, 5 to 30%. The amount of the reducing'agent used depends on the amounts of the noble metal and the metal for promoting catalysis, the equivalents used  thereof  usually  should  be  at  least   1   to   1.5  times  of  the<br>
6<br><br>
Ref. 21089-8<br>
equivalents required to reduce the catalyst; if necessary, more reducing agents can be used. The reducing temperature is usually between 100 to 300 °C, and preferably, between 1 50 to 250 °C.    The reducing pressure is usually between 0 to 5 kg/cm2 (gauge<br>
pressure), and preferably, between 1.5 to 3.5 kg/cm2 (gauge pressure).<br>
After the reducing process, the reduced catalyst is washed with deionized water until the chloride ions are completely removed and then dried. After drying, it is impregnated with an aqueous solution containing an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound. Finally, the catalyst is dried at a temperature between 80 to 150 °C  until the water content is between 0 to 6% by<br>
weight, and preferably, 1 to 3% by weight.<br>
The metal components-supporting catalyst prepared in the present invention is suitable for producing alkenyl acetates through reaction of olefins, acetic acid and oxygen in vapor phase. Said olefinic compounds include ethylene, propylene, isobutylene and the like. For example, the catalyst prepared in the present invention can be used in the presence of ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen in vapor phase to produce vinyl acetate. The catalyst employed in this producing process comprises palladium, gold and an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound (a potassium compound is preferred). Also, the catalyst prepared in the present invention may be used in the presence of propylene, acetic acid and oxygen in vapor phase to produce allyl acetate. The catalyst employed in this producing process comprises palladium, copper (barium and lead can further be added), and an   alkali   or   alkaline   earth   metal   compound    (a   potassium<br>
7<br><br>
Ref.21089-<br>
compound is preferred).<br>
A certain amount of the above prepared catalyst for producing atkenyl acetates is placed in a reacting tube with an inner diameter of 20mm and a length of 2.0 m. Under a specific pressure at the inlet of the reacting tube, the reacting gases are introduced into the tube at a reacting temperature set according to the activity of the catalyst. These reacting gases comprises 30 to 45 volume % of olefin, 30 to 50 volume % of nitrogen gas, 5 to 1 5 volume % of acetic acid and 3 to 7 volume % of oxygen. The yield of alkenyl acetate is determined by analyzing the composition at the exit of the tube in a definite time.<br>
Generally, the selection of a catalyst in the industry is based on the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity can be calculated basically according to the following formula:<br>
The activity of a catalyst:<br>
weight of alkenyl acetates produced(g) STY(space time yield) =<br>
volume(l) of catalyst x sampling time(hr) The selectivity of a catalyst:<br>
moles of vinyl acetate produced C2 selectivity =<br>
moles of vinyl acetate produced + 1/2 moles of CO2 produced<br>
moles of allyl acetate produced C3 selectivity =.<br>
moles of ally I acetate produced + 1/3 moles of CO2 produced<br>
As  the surface  area  of metals  in  the  catalyst  prepared<br>
8<br><br>
Ref. 21089<br>
according to the present invention is higher compared to those of the catalyst prepared by the reducing process using liquid reducing agents, so is the efficiency of the catalyst in the present invention higher. It is confirmed from the evaluation of the catalytic activity that when the catalyst is used to produce alkenyl acetates, the catalyst prepared in the present invention not only provides higher activity of the whole reaction of olefins, acetic acid and oxygen, but also prolongs its own life. That is, compared to the conventional catalyst, the catalyst of the present invention is able to yield more alkenyl acetates per unit volume of catalyst in the reactor and per unit time when the conditions of the synthetic reaction (such as pressure, temperature, oxygen concentration) remain constant. Moreover, if the productive yield remains constant, not only the reacting temperature can be decreased, but also the selectivity of the reaction can be higher, which leads to less production of carbon dioxide and less product loss during removal of carbon dioxide, thus the unit raw material consumption will be lower.<br>
The present invention will be further described with reference to the following Examples and Comparative Examples, but the scope of the present invention is by no means limited.<br>
