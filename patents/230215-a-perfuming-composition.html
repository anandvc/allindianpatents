				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns the use as perfuming ingredient of a decaline derivative of formula<br><br>
wherein R1 is a lower alkyl, the R2 to R5 are hydrogen atoms or lower alkyls and at least<br>
one dotted line is a double bond.<br>
The present invention concerns also the compositions or articles associated with<br>
said compound.<br>
Prior art<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are generally known from the prior art, where they<br>
are described, in general, in the context of chemical synthesis.<br>
However, the prior art documents disclosing said compounds do not report or<br>
suggest any organoleptic properties of the compounds of formula (I), or any use of said<br>
compound in the field of perfumery.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now discovered that a compound of formula<br><br><br>
wherein the dotted lines represent a single or double bond and at least one of said dotted<br>
lines represents a double bond;<br>
in represents simultaneously 0, in which case the oxygen atom is bounded to the cyclanic<br>
carbon atom by a double bond, or 1, in which case the oxygen atom is bounded to the<br>
cyclanic carbon atom by a single bond,<br>
R represents a hydrogen atom or a HCO or MeCO group;<br>
R1 represents a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl or alkenyl group;<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group;<br>
R3 represents, taken alone, a hydrogen atom or, taken together with R2, a bridging CH2<br>
group;<br>
R4 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group; and<br>
R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched C1-C3 alkyl group;<br>
is a useful perfuming ingredient, which is characterized by an odor of the woody type with<br>
 optionally citrus notes.<br>
The compound of formula (I) possesses several asymmetric carbon atoms.<br>
Therefore, the compound of formula (I) can be in the form of any one of its stereoisomers.<br>
Furthermore it is also understood that the invention's compound can be in the form of a<br>
mixture of any one of said stereoisomers.<br>
Preferably, substituents R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 have in total, i.e. all together, 3, 4 or<br>
5 carbon atoms.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula (I)<br>
wherein the dotted lines, R3 and n are defined as above;<br>
R represents a hydrogen atom or a MeCO group;<br>
R1 represents a methyl, ethyl or propyl group;<br>
each R2, R4 and R5 represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and<br><br>
the substituents R1, R2 R3 R4 and R5 have in total, i.e. all together, 3 or 4 carbon atoms;<br>
are particularly suitable of a large number of applications in fine or functional perfumery.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein the dotted lines represent a single or double bond,<br>
R7 and R8 represent, each, a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;<br>
R9 are both hydrogen atoms or are both methyl groups; and<br>
the substituents R7, R8 and R9 have in total, i.e. all together, 2 or 3 carbon atoms;<br>
or the compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a MeCO group;<br>
R10 and R" represent, each, a hydrogen atom or a methyl group;<br>
one R12 is a hydrogen atom and the other is a methyl group; and<br>
the substituents R10, R" and R12 have in total, i.e. all together, 2 or 3 carbon atoms;<br>
are very appreciated by the perfumers for their woody-vetiver/cedar or woody-grapefruit<br>
note. The compounds of formula (II) or (III), at the exception of 4,6,8,8a-tetramethyl-<br>
3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-naphthalenone and 4,6,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l<br><br>
(2H)-naphthalenone and their isomers, are also new and are a further object of the present<br>
invention. The known compounds of formula (II) or (III) have been reported by C.Angell<br>
et all in J.Org.Chem. 1986, 51, 5177, wherein they were prepared for a NMR study of<br>
geminal di-methyl analogues.<br>
Amongst the compounds responding to the formulae cited above, one may cite in<br>
particular, and as non-limiting example, 4,6,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenone. This compound has a scent characterized by a woody-cedar and ambery-<br>
leather note as well as a jute, patchouli and agarwood connotation. In fact 4,6,8a-<br>
trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone has an odor which reminds of<br>
VertofixÂ® (methyl cedryl ketone; origin: IFF, USA) but having a greater substantivity and<br>
volume than the odor of the latter.<br>
The fragrance and performance of 4,8,8a-trimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-<br>
naphthalenyl acetate are very similar to those of the above-cited 4,6,8a-trimethyl-<br>
3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone, but distinguish themselves by the presence<br>
5 of an additional note of the ozone type.<br>
Another example of invention's compound is perhydro-4-ethyl-8-methyl-l-<br>
naphthalenone that has an odor of the woody-vetiver type, with a strong connotation of<br>
the vetiveryl acetate, vetiverone type in which the woody, earthy and rooty notes are<br>
married in a very natural and elegant manner. It is very rare for a product to possess such a<br>
natural vetiver note.<br>
Furthermore, as ketone one may also cite perhydro-8-methyl-4-propyl-l-<br>
naphthalenone which has a woody-vctyver note similar to that of perhydro-4-ethyl-8-<br>
methyl-1-naphthalenone but possesses also a well distinct grapefruit, rhubarbe note.<br>
The scent of 4-ethyl-6,8-dimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenol has<br>
&gt;a quite distinct odor compared to the above-mentioned compounds. The odor of said<br>
naphthalenol is characterized by a woody-pin note and a clean, elegant, fresh and<br>
powerful citrus note, of the grapefruit type, which reminds of the odor of Nootkatone, a<br>
natural ingredient of pink-grapefruit peel scent. Furthermore, 4-ethyl-6,8-dimethyl-<br>
l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenol possesses a fragrance having an astonishing<br>
substantivity, which is rare for this type of note.<br>
Contrary to the above-mentioned alcohol, the tri-cyclic alcohol<br>
2,6-dimethyltricyclo[6.2.1.0(2,7)]undec-9-en-3-ol possesses a woody odor which is<br>
typically of the patchouli and rooty type.<br><br>
Finally, one may also cite the perhydro-4-ethyl-6,8a-dimethyl-l-naphthalenone<br>
and its olefinic analogue 4-ethyl-6,8a-dimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenone. Both compounds have a scent similar to that of perhydro-4-ethyl-8-<br>
methyl-1-naphthalenone, but are a bit less strong and have also a grapefruit note, which is<br>
stronger for the perhydro-4-ethyl-6,8a-dimethyl-l-naphthalenone.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns also the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) as perfuming ingredient. In other words it concerns a method to confer,<br>
enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a<br>
perfumed article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an<br>
(effective amount of at least a compound of formula (I). By "use of a compound of<br>
formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the use of any composition containing the<br>
compound (I) and which can be advantageously employed in the perfumery industry as<br>
active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which are in fact perfuming compositions that can be<br>
advantageously employed as perfuming ingredients, are also an object of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from<br>
a perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties<br>
of perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting examples solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials, for example, may<br><br>
comprise wall-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides,<br>
natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids: Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
iBand 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming preparation or<br>
composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
(considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the organoleptic effect desired. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
5 can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carrier, than those previously specified, can be also ethanol,<br>
water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known<br><br>
under the trademark IsoparÂ®(origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether<br>
esters such as those known under the trademark DowanolÂ® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
jof imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I)<br>
land at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as<br>
well as a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least<br>
one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the<br>
perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various<br>
compounds of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Its is also understood here that any mixture resulting directly from a chemical<br>
synthesis, e.g. without an adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention<br>
would be involved as a starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a<br>
perfuming composition according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I) as defined above; and<br>
ii) a consumer product base,<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br><br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer products include solid or liquid detergents and<br>
fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes,<br>
colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or<br>
gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
((there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
 aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect<br>
the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given<br>
base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.01 % to 25 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 1% to 10% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles.<br>
The use and article comprising an invention's compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of the 4,6,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone, 4-ethyl-<br>
06,8-dimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenol, perhydro-4-ethyl-8-methyl-l-<br>
naphthalenone and perhydro-8-methyl-4-propyl-l-naphthalenone are a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention. Three of said compounds are also new and are also an<br>
Object of the present invention.<br><br>
The invention's compounds can be prepared by a process involving a Lewis acidic<br>
catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction between a diene of formula (IV) and a dienophyle of<br>
formula (V),<br><br>
wherein the symbols have the meaning indicated above, and then optionally a reduction of<br>
the carbonyl or of the carbon-carbon double bond. Specific examples are given further<br>
below.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (Â°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for 1H and 13C, the chemical<br>
displacements Î´ are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling<br>
 constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>

1)	l,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-cyclopenta-g-2-benzopyrane; origin:<br>
International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, USA<br>
2)	4/3-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-3-cyclohexene-l-carbaldehyde; origin: International<br>
Flavors &amp; Fragrances, USA<br>
The addition of 800 parts by weight of 4,6,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenone to the above-described eau de toilette imparted to the fragrance of the latter<br>
a remarkably natural and strong connotation of the woody, cedar, VertofixÂ®, cedryl<br>
acetate, which was very warm and had a lot of volume.<br>
iWhen instead of the above mentioned compound was added the same amount of 4,8,8a-<br>
trimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenyl acetate the effect obtained was quite<br>
similar although slightly less round.<br>
The effect obtained by the addition of 800 parts by weight of perhydro-4-ethyl-8-methyl-<br>
1-naphthalenone to the above-described eau de toilette was quite different from the one<br>
described for the two compounds mentioned above. The new fragrance thus obtained had<br>
now a scent much more in the direction of vetiver, a bit watery and very pleasant and<br>
Noble.<br>
Also the effect obtained by the addition of 800 parts by weight of 4-ethyl-6,8-dimethyl-<br>
l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenol to the above-described fine perfumery<br><br>
composition was very different from the one described for the other compounds<br>
mentioned above. The scent became almost of the grapefruit type with a woody bottom<br>
note. The grapefruit note was devoid of the classical grapefruit-sulfury note and was<br>
reminiscent of nootkatone.<br><br><br><br>
* in dipropyleneglycol<br>
1)	l,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-l,l,2,3,3-pentamethyl-4-indenone; origin: International Flavors<br>
&amp; Fragrances, USA<br>

10)2-tert-butyl-l-cyclohexyl acetate; origin: International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, USA<br><br>
The addition of 1300 parts by weight of 4,6,8a-trimethyl-3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-<br>
naphthalenone or 4,8,8a-trimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenyl acetate to<br>
the above-described functional composition imparted a very elegant, as well as<br>
particularly persistent, woody-cedar note. The note imparted by 4,6,8a-trimethyl-<br>
3,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydro-l(2H)-naphthalenone was more elegant and warm than the one<br>
imparted by 4,8,8a-trimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-naphthalenyl acetate.<br>
Furthermore, the effect imparted by the two invention's compounds was judged by the<br>
expert perfumers as being more elegant and performing, in application, than the one<br>
which was obtained by the addition of the same amount of VertofixÂ® to the above-<br>
mentioned functional composition.<br>
The addition of the same amount of perhydro-4-ethyl-8-methyl-l-naphthalenone to the<br>
above-described functional composition imparted a very nice vetiver tonality to the new<br>
composition, while the addition of 4-ethyl-6,8-dimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-<br>
naphthalenol imparted a fresh and natural citrus connotation, of the pink grapefruit type.<br>
The freshness imparted by 4-ethyl-6,8-dimethyl-l,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-l-<br>
naphthalenol was also present on the dry linen, resulting thus in an exceptional<br>
performance for a compound having such fragrance notes.<br><br><br><br><br>
