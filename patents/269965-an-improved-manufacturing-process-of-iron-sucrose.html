Title:	AN   IMPROVED   MANUFACTURING   PROCESS   OF<br>
IRON SUCROSE<br>
Applicant:   Claris Lifesciences Limited,<br>
Claris Corporate Headquarters, Nr.Parimal Crossing, Ellisbridge,<br>
Ahmedabad - 380 006, Gujarat, India.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
 1)        TITLE OF INVENTION :<br>
AN IMPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF IRON SUCROSE<br>
2)	FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an improved manufacturing process of iron sucrose.<br>
3)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A. Intravenous Iron Therapy<br>
[0003] Iron therapy is necessary to replenish total body iron stores in patients with iron deficiency anemia. Therapeutically active iron-containing compositions comprise iron in a form capable of increasing the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. Intravenous (IV) is particularly employed for patients, who cannot tolerate oral iron therapy, are unable to adequately absorb dietary iron, or who suffer hematopoietic failure.<br>
[0004] B. Potential Side Effects of IV Iron Therapy<br>
[0005] One iron formulation, iron dextran, has been associated with significant adverse effects. Such effects are reported in approximately 26% of patients receiving iron dextran. See, Gupta et al., Kidney Int., 1999 May; 55(5): 1891-8. In this article they had given a data for iron dextrin while we are producing iron sucrose.<br>
[0006] Iron sucrose complex is one of the dextran free product. Product safety reports for iron sucrose demonstrate a low incidence of adverse effects. One study of 77 patients receiving a total of 757 doses, reported only 4 patients experiencing adverse events related to the administration of iron sucrose. The events reported were diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and a transient minty taste. Ten patients in this study had a documented history of sensitivity reactions to iron dextran that were consistent with anaphylaxis and none experienced a hypersensitivity reaction with iron sucrose. See, Charytan et al., Am J Kidney Dis. 2001 February; 37(2): 300-7.<br>
[0007] C. Purity of Iron Sucrose Complexes<br>
[0008] Iron sucrose complex generally contains contaminants including excipients, free sucrose and by-products of the synthesis of the complex,<br><br>
which are readily detected by techniques such as H.P.L.C. The compendial method of analysis for Iron sucrose complex in sucrose is reported in United States Pharmacopoeia. The other tests like iron cotent, sucrose content, chloride content, arsenic content, turbidity test, molecular weight test etc. was also carried out to check the purity of iron sucrose complexes.<br>
[0009] A composition of iron sucrose complex comprising a narrower molecular weight distribution may yield a safer and more efficacious therapy. There exists a need for an iron sucrose complex preparative method that results in a product with low coast, narrower molecular weight and distribution as compared to existing compositions.<br>

5)        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0060] The present invention provides a process for the preparation of iron sucrose complexes. The iron sucrose complexes can be used to formulate a therapeutic iron sucrose composition containing lower levels of contaminants.<br><br>
[0061] A. Ferric Chloride<br>
The ferric chloride can be used as different names like flores martis, iron chloride, Iron (III) choloride, Iron (III) chloride solution, iron sesquichloride, Iron trichloride.<br>
[0062] A. Ferric Hydroxide<br>
[0063] The term "ferric hydroxide" as employed herein, includes the various forms of ferric hydroxide, including, for example, hydrated ferric oxide, ferric oxy hydroxide, polymeric ferric hydroxide, ferric hydroxide gel, partially neutralized ferric salts and partially neutralized polymeric ferric salts.<br>
[0064] B. Preparation of Ferric Hydroxide<br>
[0065] The ferric hydroxide utilized as the starting material in the process of the present invention may be prepared by reacting a ferric salt with at least about one molar equivalent of a base, based on the amount of the ferric salt. A mixture of ferric salts, and/or a mixture of bases, may be employed. Suitable ferric salts include ferric salts wherein the anion is an anion of an acid such as, for example, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, acetate, citrate and other acid anions. Preferred ferric salts include, for example ferric chloride and ferric nitrate.<br>
[0066] Suitable bases for reaction with the ferric salt include, for example, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal bicarbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, water-soluble amines and mixtures thereof. Preferred bases include sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, tris-hydroxymethyl-aminoethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0067] The ferric hydroxide may be prepared by (a) providing a reaction mixture comprising a ferric salt dissolved in an aqueous medium; (b) adding to the reaction mixture a base with ferric salt in presence of water for injection; (c) allowing the reaction mixture to equilibrate for a time interval greater than about 15 minutes (d) collecting the ferric hydroxide from the reaction mixture.<br>
[0068] The base may be the same, or may be different bases. The base may be added to the reaction mixture in solution or suspension in an aqueous solvent. Alternately the bases may be added neat, i.e., a base such as sodium carbonate may be added as a dry solid.<br>
[0068] The base may be added to the reaction mixture batchwise, i.e., all at once, or continuously or semi-continuously over a time interval at a<br><br>
constant or variable addition rate. A slow continuous addition may be performed as a titration wherein the pH of the mixture is continuously monitored, preferably using a pH meter. The addition of the base may be stopped when a selected pH, preferably about 8.0 + 0.1 came.<br>
[0069] After the addition of the first base to the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture is allowed to equilibrate, with or without stirring. The temperature is preferably maintained in the range from about 30 degree to about 35 degree C. The pH of the reaction mixture is typically observed to drop to a pH in the range from about to about 8.0 + 0.1 during the time interval when the reaction mixture is allowed to equilibrate.<br>
[0070] Following complete addition of the base, the reaction mixture, comprising a suspension of ferric hydroxide, is allowed to equilibrate for a time interval from about 15 minutes. The ferric hydroxide precipitate is observed to settle during the equilibration period.<br>
[0071] The ferric hydroxide precipitate may be collected from the reaction mixture by any suitable method, including, for example, filtration, centrifugation, or decanting. Filtration is preferred. Suitable filtration methods include vacuum filtration, e.g., for example through a Buchner funnel. The resulting filter cake comprising ferric hydroxide is washed with water for injection.<br>
[0072] To prepare iron sucrose, a suspension or slurry of ferric hydroxide, as prepared above, is reacted with sucrose in a reaction mixture comprising sodium ions. The sucrose is preferably provided as a solution of sucrose in an aqueous solvent. The sodium ions are preferably provided by addition of a sodium base, preferably aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mixture of the ferric hydroxide and sucrose may become basic upon the addition of the sodium base. The sodium base may be added to the aqueous medium, and the ferric hydroxide may subsequently be added. Alternately, the sodium base may be added to the mixture of the ferric hydroxide and sucrose in the aqueous medium.<br>
[0073] The reaction mixture is optionally heated to a temperature in the range from about 30degree to about 35 degree C, prior to the step of isolating iron sucrose complex from the reaction mixture.<br>
[0074] The reaction of ferric hydroxide and sucrose may be optionally monitored to determine the weight average molecular weight and purity of the iron sucrose product. Removing an aliquot of the reaction mixture and conducting a molecular weight analysis on the aliquot was done for monitoring.<br><br>
[0075] When the reaction of ferric hydroxide and sucrose is complete (as determined by observation of the clarity of the reaction mixture) the iron sucrose complex is isolated from the reaction mixture. Isolation may be achieved by adding one or more water-miscible organic solvents to the reaction mixture to precipitate the iron sucrose complex. Suitable methods for collecting the product include, for example, filtration, centrifugation and decanting. The product is preferably collected by filtration. The selection of suitable filtration media, e.g., for example, a sintered glass funnel or Buchner funnel, is within the capability of one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0076] Alternately, the iron sucrose complex is isolated from the reaction mixture by concentrating the reaction mixture to form a residue comprising the iron sucrose complex. Concentration of the reaction mixture may be carried out by centrifugation method.<br>
[0077] The centrifugation was last for about 30 hours, preferably it was 25 hours.<br>
[0078] The wet cake of product of iron and sucrose again react with again sucrose and sodium hydroxide. The reaction was carried out at 100 degree C to 103 degree C. the pH was 10.50 to 11.50. The time for reacting the compounds was 4 hours.<br>
[0079] The resulting complex was isolated with the organic solvents and the water for injection.<br>
[0080] The organic solvents group which may ranging from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethyl formamide, dimethylacetamide, and N-methylpyrrolidinone.<br>
[0081] According to the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition in solid dosage form comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an iron sucrose complex having a molecular weight in the range from about 20,000 to about 400,000 Daltons. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be formulated for oral administration and may be in the form of a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, granule or other suitable solid dosage form with suitable excipients and additives.<br>
[0082] The pharmaceutical composition according the invention comprises an iron sucrose complex that contains from about 1 to about 33.33% ferric iron by weight.<br><br>
