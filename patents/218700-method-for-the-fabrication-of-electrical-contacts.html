				<td>METHOD FOR THE FABRICATION OF ELECTRICAL CONTACTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of electrical contacts and more<br>
specifically to methods for the fabrication of electrical contacts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Existing electrical contact designs include interposers constructed from<br>
elastomeric material and interposers constructed from balls of wire. Both of these<br>
solutions have limitations inherent in their design. Current elastomeric materials are<br>
unable to sustain adequate contact spring force over time and temperature and have a<br>
small range of working heights. Interposers constructed from balls of wire are fragile,<br>
prone to unravel, often require costly inspection, and provide a limited amount of contact<br>
travel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method for the fabrication of electrical contacts using metal forming,<br>
masking, etching, and soldering techniques is presented. The method produces a plurality<br>
of specialized electrical contacts, capable of use in an interposer, or other device,<br>
including non-permanent or permanent electrical connections providing contact wipe, soft<br>
spring rates, durability, and significant amounts of travel.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from<br>
the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings,<br>
illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a printed circuit board (PCB)<br>
comprising a quantity of through-plated vias 106, according to the present invention. In<br>
an example embodiment of the present invention a printed circuit board substrate 100 is<br>
plated with copper on both sides of the substrate and the copper is etched leaving areas of<br>
copper 104, surrounding each of the holes 102, on opposite sides of the substrate from<br>
each other. While the areas of copper 104 in this embodiment are somewhat elliptical in<br>
shape, other shapes of the areas of copper 104 will work equally well within the scope of<br>
the present invention. For example, in some embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
area of copper 104 may be circular, square, rectangular, or other, more complex, shapes.<br>
While copper is a preferred metal, other example embodiments of the present invention<br>
may use other materials for the plating. The substrate 100 may comprise a wide variety<br>
of materials, with fiberglass as a common choice of material. Holes 102 are then drilled<br>
through the center of each area of copper 104. The barrel of the holes are then through-<br>
plated to connect the corresponding areas of copper 104 on opposite sides of the substrate<br>
100 thereby forming an array of through-plated vias 106. This drilled and plated PCB<br>
may be created by any standard PCB manufacturing system, and will be as the substrate<br>
for a plurality of specialized electrical contacts referred herein to as micro-spider<br>
contacts. A PCB with these micro-spider contacts may be used as an interposer in an<br>
electronic system.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a metal sheet comprising a<br>
quantity of domes according to the present invention. A metal sheet 200 is processed<br>
such that it comprises a plurality of small domes. 2.02. The metal sheet 200 may be copper<br>
or other conductive metals as needed for any particular implementation of the present<br>
invention. The size of the domes 202 may also be varied as needed for any particular<br>
implementation of the present invention. In an example embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the domes 202 in the metal sheet 200 have a one-to-one correspondence with<br>
the through-plated holes 102 on the PCB substrate 100, however other embodiments of<br>
the present invention need not maintain this one-to-one correspondence.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of the metal sheet of Figure 2 after masking and i<br>
etching of the sheet 200 to create a quantity of micro-spiders, each on their own footing<br>
304, according to the present invention. After the metal sheet 200 has been masked and<br>
etched, micro-spiders 300, footings 304, and connectors 302 between individual footings<br>
304 remain forming an etched metal sheet 310. Note that while Figure 3 shows a regular<br>
array of micro-spiders 300, there is no need for the plurality of micro-spiders 300 to form<br>
a regular array, instead they may be formed only in locations where needed and longer<br>
connectors 302 used to connect the plurality of micro-spiders 300.<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view of an embodiment of the structure created by<br>
soldering the metal sheet of Figure 3 to the printed circuit board of Figure 1 according to<br>
the present invention. The etched metal sheet 310 is soldered to the PCB structure of <br><br>
Figure 1, thereby forming an array of plated-through vias 106 covered by a corresponding<br>
array of micro-spiders 300. The solder may be silk-screened onto the array of through-<br>
plated vias 106 to cover just the exposed metal areas 104 where it is desired that the<br>
micro-spiders 300 make electrical contact. At this point in the process the individual<br>
micro-spiders 300 are physically and electrically connected to the individual areas of<br>
metal plating 104 surrounding their corresponding via hole 102 in the PCB substrate 100.<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of the structure of Figure 4 after the connections<br>
between the individual micro-spiders have been etched away according to the present<br>
invention. At this point in the process, all of the micro-spiders 300 have been separated<br>
from each other physically and electrically by etching away all of the connectors 302<br>
between the individual micro-spiders 300. Note that in some implementations of the<br>
present invention, it may be desired to have a plurality of micro-spiders 300 physically<br>
and electrically connected to each other at the completion of the interposer. In that case,<br>
the masking and etching of the PCB substrate 100 and the thin metal sheet 200 may be<br>
designed to leave larger areas of metal 104 surrounding the PCB vias 102 such that a<br>
plurality of vias are electrically connected, and corresponding areas of the thin metal<br>
sheet 200 may be left un-etched for later soldering to the array of through-plated vias 106.<br>
Such an alternate embodiment of the present invention may be useful for power supply<br>
connections that commonly require a large amount of current-carrying capability.<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective view of the structure of Figure 5 after the micro-spiders<br>
have been plated according to the present invention. In an example embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the micro-spiders 300 may be plated with nickel and gold, improving<br>
their durability and conductivity, and thereby forming an array of plated rnicro-spiders<br>
600. j<br>
Figure 7 is a flowchart of a method for the creation of micro-spiders 300<br>
according to the present invention. In a step 702, a PCB substrate 100 is plated, etched,<br>
and drilled to produce a plurality of through-plated vias 106 in the substrate 100. In a<br>
step 704, a quantity of domes are created in a first metal sheet 200. In an example <br>
embodiment of the present invention, the first metal sheet 200 may be copper. In a step<br>
706, a first mask layer is created over the first metal sheet 200. In a step 708, the first <br>
metal sheet 200 is completely etched away in areas not protected by the mask, producing<br>
a quantity of micro-spiders 300, footings 304, and connectors 302. In a step 710, after the<br>
mask layer is cleaned off, the first metal sheet 200 comprising a quantity of micro-spiders<br>
300 is soldered to the plurality of through-plated vias 106 in the substrate 100. In a step<br>
712, a second mask layer is created over the first metal sheet 200. In a step 714, all of the <br>
areas of the first metal sheet 200 that are not protected by the second mask layer are<br>
completely removed by etching. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
connectors 302 are left unprotected by the second mask layer and removed in the etching<br>
step. In a step 716, the quantity of micro-spiders 300 is metal plated.<br>
Some methods of applying and patterning, the first mask layer may have <br>
difficulties is creating an adequate mask layer over an irregular surface such as that<br>
resulting from step 704 (creating a quantity of domes in a metal sheet). Further, some<br>
photolithography systems may have difficulties in patterning a mask layer over an<br>
irregular surface, particularly with the sides of the domes. When using masking systems<br>
that are unable to create an adequate mask layer over an irregular surface, it may be<br>
necessary to perform the steps of the present invention in a different order than that<br>
shown in Figure 7. For these reasons, in some example embodiments of the present<br>
invention, it may be beneficial to perform the step 706 of creating a first mask layer over<br>
the first metal sheet before the step 704 of creating a quantity of domes in the first metal<br>
sheet.<br>
Figure 8 is a flowchart of a method for the creation of an interposer comprising<br>
micro-spiders according to the present invention. The method for the creation of an<br>
interposer including micro-spiders shown in this example embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes the steps of the method shown in Figure 7, with the addition of steps to<br>
preferably create an additional quantity of micro-spiders on the opposite side of the<br>
printed circuit board substrate. As explained in connection with Figure 7, in a step 716,<br>
the quantity of micro-spiders 300 is metal plated. In a step 802, a quantity of domes is<br>
created in a second metal sheet 200. This step 802 may occur concurrently with step 702,<br>
if desired. In a step 804, a third mask layer is created over the second metal sheet 200. <br>
This step 804 may occur concurrently with step 706, if desired. In a step 806, the second<br>
metal sheet 200 is completely etched away in areas not protected by the third mask,<br>
producing a quantity of micro-spiders 300. This step 806 may occur concurrently with<br>
step 708, if desired. In a step 808, after the third mask layer is cleaned off, the second<br>
metal sheet 200 including a quantity of micro-spiders 300 is soldered to the plurality of<br>
through-plated vias 106. This step 808 may occur concurrently with step 710, if desired.<br>
In a step 810, a fourth mask layer is created over the second metal sheet 200. This step<br>
810 may occur concurrently with step 712, if desired. In a step 812, all of the areas of the<br>
second metal sheet 200 that are not protected by the fourth mask layer are completely<br>
removed by etching. This step 812, may occur concurrently with step 714, if desired. In<br>
a step 814, the second quantity of micro-spiders 300 is metal plated. This step 814, may<br>
occur concurrently with step 716, if desired. Once again, in some embodiments of the<br>
present invention, it may be desirable to create the mask layers over the thin metal sheets <br>
before forming the domes in the thin metal sheets. This example embodiment (Figure 8)<br>
of the present invention may be used to create a dual micro-spider interposer for use<br>
between a printed circuit board and a circuit module, such as an application-specific <br>
integrated circuit (ASIC) package, or a multi-chip module. The dual micro-spider<br>
interposer is easy to remove from the printed circuit board without costly rework of the<br>
board. This allows for quick and easy changes of the circuit module, including changes<br>
in the field, if needed.<br>
Figure 9 is a flowchart of a method for the creation of an interposer comprising<br>
micro-spiders and ball grid array (BGA) balls according to the present invention. The<br>
method for the creation of an interposer including micro-spiders and BGA balls shown in<br>
this example embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of the method shown<br>
in Figure 7, with the addition of steps to preferably create a quantity of BGA balls on the <br>
opposite side of the printed circuit board substrate. As explained in connection with<br>
Figure 7, in a step 716, the quantity of micro-spiders 300 is metal plated. In a step 902,<br>
ball grid array (BGA) balls are attached to the side of the substrate opposite from the<br>
micro-spiders. Once again, in some embodiments of the present invention, it may be<br>
desirable to create the mask layers over the thin metal sheets before forming the domes in<br>
the thin metal sheets. By creating an interposer comprising micro-spiders on one side and<br>
BGA balls on the other, thinner gold may be used on a printed circuit board that the BGA <br><br>
side of the interposer attaches to. This enables the use of standard BGA attachment<br>
processes to attach the interposer to the printed circuit board. While this implementation<br>
of the present invention (Figure 9) enables less expensive plating on the printed circuit<br>
board, the removeability of the dual micro-spider interposer (Figure 8) allows for easier<br>
re-work than the micro-spider BGA interposer.<br>
Figure 10 is a flowchart of a method for the creation of micro-spiders in<br>
accordance with the present invention. In an example embodiment of the present<br>
invention similar to the method of Figure 7, a metal sheet is etched into a micro-spider<br>
configuration before the micro-spiders are domed. This method allows for masking and<br>
etching of the metal sheet before dome formation, eliminating the difficulties of masking<br>
and etching a domed surface. In a step 702, a PCB substrate 100 is plated, etched, and<br>
drilled to produce a plurality of through-plated vias. 106. In a step 706, a first mask layer <br>
is created over a first metal sheet 200. In a step 708, the first metal sheet 200 is <br>
completely etched away in areas not protected by the mask, producing a quantity of<br>
micro-spiders 300, footings 304, and connectors 302. In a step 1000, a substantially<br>
incompressible material is deposited between the legs of the micro-spiders etched into the<br>
metal sheet. The substantially incompressible material is used to keep the legs of the<br>
micro spider from improperly bending during the step 704 of forming domes. It may<br>
comprise a material such as plaster of paris, and one example embodiment of the present<br>
invention uses a silk-screening process for applying the material. Next, in a step 704, a<br>
quantity of domes are created in the first metal sheet 200. In a step 1002, the<br>
substantially incompressible material is removed from between the legs of the micro-<br>
spiders. Depending on the material used, the substantially incompressible material may<br>
be removed by dissolution or other equivalent processes. In a step 710, after the mask<br>
layer is cleaned off, the first metal sheet 200 including a quantity of micro-spiders 300 is<br>
soldered to the plurality of through-plated vias 106. In a step 712, a second mask layer is<br>
created over the first metal sheet 200. In a step 714, all of the areas of the first metal<br>
sheet 200 that are not protected by the second mask layer are completely removed by<br>
etching. In. a step 716, the quantity of micro-spiders 300 is metal plated.<br>
Figure 11 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a three-legged micro-spider<br>
according to the present invention. A three-legged micro-spider 1100 is shown connected<br>
to the area of metal 104 surrounding a through-plated hole 102 in a substrate 100.<br>
Figure 12 is a perspective view of a plurality of an embodiment of three-legged<br>
micro-spiders 1100 on a substrate 100 in accordance with the present invention. While<br>
this figure shows a regular array of micro-spiders 1100, other embodiments of the present<br>
invention may use an irregular array of micro-spiders 1100 as desired by the intended use<br>
of the plurality of micro-sgiders 1100. Further, micro-spiders may be constructed with<br>
any number of legs (greater than one) as desired by an intended use, within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In a specific example embodiment of the present invention, micro-spiders 300 are<br>
preferably constructed on a first side of the substrate 100 and ball grid array balls 1000<br>
are preferably constructed on a second side of the substrate 100, creating an interposer for<br>
use in non-permanently attaching electronic devices such as a multi-chip module (MCM)<br>
to a circuit board. Figure 13 is a cross-sectional view of such an embodiment. The<br>
example embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 13 illustrates a plurality of<br>
micro-spiders 300 constructed on a first side of a substrate and ball grid array (BGA)<br>
balls 1300 constructed on a second side of a substrate 100, connected together by<br>
through-plated holes 102 surrounded by areas of metal 104 contacting the micro-spiders<br>
300. This example embodiment of the present invention may be employed as an<br>
interposer for use in non-permanently attaching electronic devices such as a MCM to a<br>
circuit board, while the interposer is attached to the circuit board by the BGA balls 1300.<br>
The example embodiment of the present invention may be fabricated using the process<br>
described in connection with Figure 9.<br>
The resulting micro-spiders are described further in a U.S. patent application,<br>
Serial No.____________, "Electrical Contact", filed concurrently with the present<br>
application, and incorporated herein by reference. Another method for the fabrication of<br>
micro-spiders is described further in a U.S. patent application, Serial No.<br>
