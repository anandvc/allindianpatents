				<td>AROMATIC COMPOUNDS WITH HIV ASPARTYL PROTEASE<br>
INHIBITING ACTIVITIES AND COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention concerns a novel class of aromatic derivatives possessing aspartyl protease<br>
inhibitory properties. It describes the synthetic methodology used to make these derivatives<br>
from readily available L-lysine analogues and their biological applications. In addition, this<br>
invention relates to different pharmaceutical composition!; comprising these compounds. The<br>
compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention IIave been shown to inhibit<br>
the activity of HIV aspartyl protease, an enzyme essential for virus maturation and<br>
infectivity. The inhibitory property may be advantageously used to provide compounds with<br>
antiviral properties against HIV viruses, including the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS tlirough infection of specialized cells<br>
of the immune system carrylng CD4 receptors. The HIV retrovirus reproduces in these cells,<br>
especially the so-called T-helper cells, and kills them in Ihe process. While the body IIas the<br>
ability to re-generate T-helper cells to some extent, after years of continuous cell destruction<br>
by HIV and fighting back by the immune system, the virus eventually emerges as the battle's<br>
winner. The progressive destruction of T-helper cells leads to weakening of the immune<br>
system which in turn, opens the door to opportunistic pathogens. When this IIappens, HIV-<br>
infected people start to show clinical symptoms. If left unchecked, HIV infection leads to<br>
death in a matter of years.<br>
In order to reproduce in infected cells, HIV needs three major enzymes that are carried inside<br>
the viral particle. These three enzymes, reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase, thus<br>
represent ideal targets for antiviral therapy. Of these, reverse transcriptase IIas been the first<br>
enzyme targeted by the pharmaceutical industry. Inhibitors of the viral protease IIave been<br>
developed more recently and their use as drugs for AIDS treatment began only in 1996.<br><br>
Although the development of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors IIas improved<br>
significantly the survival time and quality of life of HIV-infected patients, their use leads to<br>
unwanted side effects, such as anemia, neurotoxicity, bone marrow suppression and<br>
lipodystrophy. Most of the currently available anti-protease drugs are large molecules with<br>
limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. New compounds devoid of these drawbacks<br>
are urgently needed to treat HIV infections. In addition, HIV IIas the ability to develop<br>
resistance to the currently available drugs, so new compounds with original structure are<br>
desirable to fight these resistant viral strains.<br>
In an international patent application no PCT/CA02/00190 (Stranix et al.) published under<br>
No. WO 02/064551, HIV protease inhibitors based on amino acid derivaties are disclosed.<br>
This patent application includes, more particularly, N-amino acid substituted L-lysine<br>
derivatives (and analogs) possessing aspartyl protease inhibitory properties. However, it<br>
would be advantageous to be able to provide alternate compounds with such properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel class of compounds, including their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives. These compounds IIave an affinity for aspartyl proteases, in<br>
particular, HIV-1 aspartyl protease. They also presents potent antiviral activity when tested<br>
on HIV-1 viral strain (NL4.3 as the wild type virus) as well as several mutant strains.<br>
Therefore, these compounds are useful as inhibitors of such proteases. These compounds can<br>
be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents for the<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of viral infection.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may inhibit HIV viral replication in human cells (e.g.,<br>
CD4+ T-cells), by inhibiting (reducing, impairing) the ability of HIV aspartyl protease to<br>
catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds present, in viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins.<br>
These novel compounds may serve to reduce the production of infectious virions from<br>
acutely and chronically infected cells, and may inhibit (at least partially) the initial or further<br>
infection of host cells. Accordingly, these compounds may be useful as therapeutic and<br>
prophylactic agents to treat or prevent infection by HIV-1 and HIV-2, which may result in<br>
asymptomatic infection, AIDS-related complex (ARC), acquired immunodeficiency<br><br>
syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related dementia, or similar diseases of the immune system, and<br>
related viruses such as HTLV-I and HTLV-II, and simian immunodeficiency virus.<br>
It is the main objective of this invention to provide an improved class of molecules that are<br>
aspartyl protease inhibitors, and particularly, HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors.<br>

The compounds of this invention are easily prepared using conventional techniques from<br>
readily available starting materials. Two different approaches were used to prepare the new<br>
aspartyl protease inhibitors. The first approach starts from an L-ornithine derivative which is<br>
transformed into the key intermediate (lS)-4-amino-N-(4-arnino-l-hydroxymethyl-butyl)-N-<br>
isobutyl-benzenesulfonamide (VII, example 1, step F) which is further reacted with various<br>
acid to yleld the end products VIII. The second approach starts from L-α-amino-,-<br>
caprolactam which leads to key intermediates (such as, (lS)-4-amino-N-(5-amino-l-<br>
hydroxymethyl-pentyl)-N-isobutyl-benzenesulfonamide (XII, X = NH2, Y = H, example 28,<br>
step D)) which are further transformed into various end products (XIII) upon coupling with a<br>
suitable acid synthon. The detailed description of these approaches are presented in schemes<br>
1 to 4 discussed below.<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation of a key L-ornithine intermediate VII needed for the<br>
synthesis of HIV protease inhibitors according to the first approach (see example 1 in the<br>
experimental portion of this document).<br>
Note:<br>
a) R represents the "residue" of the acid molecule which is linked to the free primary amino<br>
group present on intermediate VII.<br><br>
The synthesis of intermediate VII uses N ε-Z-ornithine (I) as the starting material. The ester<br>
II was obtained upon treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride in methanol. Then, sulfonation<br>
with 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (or other substituted-benzenesulfonyl chloride) in the<br>
presence of thethylamine in dichloromethane gave compound III in excellent ylelds for the<br>
two first steps. Alkylation of the sulfonyl amine was performed with iso-butanol in the<br>
presence of triphenylphosphine and thethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) to give compound IV<br>
in excellent yleld. The nitro function was reduced with sodium borohydride in the presence of<br>
nickel (II) acetate in ethanol. The intermediate V was obtained in 97% yleld. Subsequent<br>
reduction of the ester function with lithium borohydride in ethanol gave the alcohol VI<br>
quantitatively. Removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl group (Z group) by hydrogen gas in<br>
presence of 10% Pd/C ylelded the free N,-amino derivative VII quantitatively (T.W. Greene<br>
and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
Inc. 2000). Acylation with an appropriate acid in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(HOBt) and l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodii.mide hydrochloride (EDAC) led to<br>
the desired end products VIII generally in good to excellent yleld (5O-95%).<br>

Scheme 2 illustrates a generic example for the preparation of HIV protease inhibitors made<br>
with the second approach starting from L-α-amino-,-caprolactam to give compounds of the<br>
general formula XIII.<br>
Note:<br>
a)	For scheme 2, X and Y, same or different, represents H, a straight alkyl group of 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of 3 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, F, C1, Br, I, -CF3, -OCF3, -CN, -NO2, -NR4R5, -NHCOR4, -OR4, -SR4, -<br>
COOR4, -COR4, -CH2OH, and wherein X and Y may be bound together as a methylenedioxy<br>
group of formula -OCH2O-, or as an ethylenedioxy group of formula -OCH2CH2O-, (R4 and<br>
R5 are as defined above)<br>
b)	R represents the "residue" of the acid molecule which is linked to the free primary amino<br>
group present on intermediate XII.<br>
As shown in scheme 2, the N,N-disubstituted L-lysinol derivative XII was obtained from<br>
L-α-amino-,-caprolactam in a four-step reaction sequence. Initially, L-α-amino-,-caprolactam<br>
was transformed into (2S)-3-isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IX) by reductive alkylation of the<br>
amine with an appropriate aldehyde (i.e. isobutyraldehycle), NaBH(OAc)3 and acetic acid in<br>
dichloroetIIane. Then, sulfonation with an arylsulfonyl chloride (or a substituted-arylsulfonyl<br>
chloride) in the presence of thethylamine in dichloromethane gave compound X in excellent<br>
ylelds. The derivative XI was obtained quantitatively upon treatment of X with di-tert-butyl<br>
pyrocarbonate and DMAP in acetonitrile. The reductive ring opening with sodium<br>
borohydride in ethanol and acid deprotection of the Boc protective group lead to key<br>
intermediates XII in good yleld. Finally, coupling of the free amino group present on<br>
intermediate XII with a variety of acid in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)<br>
and l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) led to the<br>
desired end HIV protease inhibitors XIII.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
Scheme 3 illustrates a generic example for the transformation of (2S)-2-amino-3-(2-bromo-<br>
phenyl)-propionic acid (XIV) into an unsubstituted or a substituted biphenyl derivative of<br>
general formula XVI.<br>
Note:<br>
a)	For scheme 3, R represents the "residue" of the acid molecule which is linked to the free<br>
primary amino group present on compound XIV.<br>
b)	X' represents a straight alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group of 3 to<br>
6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, F, C1, Br, I, -CF3, -NO2, -NR4R5, -<br>
NHCOR4, -OR4, -SR4, -COOR4, -COR4 and -CH2OH, (R4 and R5 are as defined above)<br><br>
As shown in scheme 3, the unsubstituted (or substituted) biphenyl derivative of general<br>
formula XVI was obtained from commercially available (2S)-2-arnino-3-(2-bromo-phenyl)-<br>
propionic acid (XIV, L-2-bromo-Phe (Peptech Corp.)) in a tiso-step reaction sequence. First,<br>
the amine is acylated with an appropriate synthon under standard reaction conditions to give<br>
the intermediate XV in excellent yleld. The latter was transformed into the biphenyl<br>
derivative XVI upon treatment with phenylboronic acid (or a substituted phenylboronic acid)<br>
in the presence of Pd/C Degussa type E 101 under basic reaction condition. The biphenyl<br>
derivative are obtained in excellent yleld with this methodology. The biphenyl derivatives<br>
hence obtained are linked to the key intermediates VII or XII as described on schemes 1 and<br>
2.<br><br>
XVI<br>
Scheme 4 presents the transformation of a 2-naphthyl derivative XVII into a variety of N-<br>
substituted molecules of general formula XIX. This reaction sequence could be used to<br>
produce any other similar compounds made of unsubstituted (or substituted) diphenylmethyl,<br>
1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, biphenyl and 9-anthryl described in this invention.<br>
Note:<br>
a) For scheme 4, R represents the "residue" of the molecule (an acid, acid chloride, an<br>
aldehyde or a succinimidylcarbonate ester) which is linked to the free primary amino group<br>
present on compound XVIII.<br><br>
Initially, the Boc protective group is cleaved under standard acidic reaction conditions with<br>
hydrochloric acid in ethanol to give 2-amino-N-{5-[(4-amino-benzenesulfonyl)-isobutyl-<br>
amino]-6-hydroxy-hexyl}-3-naphthalen-2-yl-propionamide (XVIII) in 94% yleld (see<br>
example 49, in the experimental section). The free amino group on molecule XVIII was<br>
transformed into a variety of HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors of formula XIX using either<br>
general procedures C or D, for the linkage of an acid chloride, general procedures A, B or E,<br>
for the linkage of a carboxylic acid, general procedure F, for the linkage of an aldehyde or<br>
general procedure G, for the linkage of an activated carbonate thester.<br>
Scheme 4<br><br>
As it can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the above synthetic schemes are not intended<br>
 to be a comprehensive list of all means by which the compounds described and claimed in<br>
this application may be synthesized. Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities<br>
to enIIance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and<br>
include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological \ system (e.g.,<br>
blood, lympIIatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase<br>
solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.<br><br>
As discussed above, the novel compounds of the present invention are excellent ligands for<br>
aspartyl proteases, particularly HIV-1 protease. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of<br>
targeting and inhibiting late stage events in the replication, i.e. the processing of the viral<br>
polyproteins by HIV encoded protease. Compounds according to this invention<br>
advantageously inhibit the ability of the HIV-1 virus to infect immortalized human T cells<br>
over a period of days, as determined by an assay measuring the amount of extracellular p24<br>
antigen - a specific marker of viral replication (see, Meek et al., Nature, 343, pp. 9O-92<br>
(1990)).<br>
In addition to their use in the prophylaxis or treatment of HIV or HTLV infection, the<br>
compounds according to this invention may also be used as inhibitory or interruptive agents<br>
for other viruses which depend on aspartyl proteases, similar to HIV or HTLV aspartyl<br>
proteases, for obligatory events in their life cycle. Such compounds inhibit the proteolytic<br>
processing of viral polyprotein precursors by inhibiting aspartyl protease. Because aspartyl<br>
protease is essential for the production of mature virions, inhibition of that processing<br>
effectively blocks the spread of virus by inhibiting the production and reproduction of<br>
infectious virions, particularly from acutely and chronically infected cells. The compounds of<br>
this invention advantageously inhibit aspartyl proteases, thus blocking the ability of aspartyl<br>
proteases to catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the<br>
treatment or prevention of HIV, HTLV, and other viral infections, which depend on aspartyl<br>
proteases for obligatory events in their life cycle. Such methods of treatment, their dosage<br>
levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available<br>
methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a virally infected patient in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of the<br>
viral infection.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in vaccines and methods for<br>
protecting individuals against viral infection over an extended period of time. The<br>
compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds<br>
of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of protease<br><br>
inhibitors in vaccines. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and<br>
administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended<br>
period of time against viral infections, such as HIV infection. As such, the novel protease<br>
inhibitors of this invention can be administered as agents for treating or preventing viral<br>
infections, including HIV infection, in a mammal.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered to a healthy or HIV-infected patient<br>
either as a single agent or in combination with other antiviral agents which interfere with the<br>
replication cycle of HIV. By administering the compounds of this invention with other<br>
antiviral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of<br>
these compounds is potentiated. For instance, the co-administered antiviral agent can be one<br>
which targets early events in the viral life cycle, such as attachment to the cell receptor and<br>
cell entry, reverse transcription and viral DNA integration into cellular DNA. Antiviral agents<br>
targeting such early life cycle events include among others polysulfated polysaccIIarides, sT4<br>
(soluble CD4) and other compounds which block binding of virus to CD4 receptors on CD4<br>
bearing T-lymphocytes and other CD4(+) cells, or inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with<br>
the cytoplasmic membrane, and didanosine (ddl), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T),<br>
zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) which inhibit reverse transcription. Other anti-<br>
retroviral and antiviral drugs may also be co-administsred with the compounds of this<br>
invention to provide therapeutic treatment for substantially reducing or eliminating viral<br>
infectivity and the symptoms associated therewith. Examples of other antiviral agents include<br>
ganciclovir, dideoxycytidine, trisodium phosphonoformate, eflornithine, ribavirin, acyclovir,<br>
alpha interferon and trimenotrexate. Additionally, other types of drugs may be used to<br>
potentiate the effect of the compounds of this invention, such as viral uncoating inhibitors,<br>
inhibitors of Tat or Rev trans-activating proteins, antisense molecules or inhibitors of the<br>
viral integrase. These compounds may also be co-administered with .other inhibitors of HIV<br>
aspartyl protease.<br>
Combination therapies according to this invention exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV<br>
replication because each component agent of the combination acts on a different site of HIV<br>
replication. The use of such combinations also advantageously reduces the dosage of a given<br>
conventional anti-retroviral agent that would be required for a desired therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These<br><br>
combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral<br>
agent therapies while not interfering with the anti-retroviral activity of those agents. These<br>
combinations reduce the potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing<br>
any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the<br>
conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity. Preferred combination<br>
therapies include the administration of a compound of tins invention with AZT, 3TC, ddl,<br>
ddC, d4T or other reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other HIV<br>
protease inhibitors such as Ro 31-8959 (Saquinavir; RocIIc), L-735,524 (Indinavir; Merck),<br>
AG-1343 (Nelfinavir; Agouron), A-84538 (Ritonavir; Abbott), ABT-378/r (Lopinavir;<br>
Abbott), and VX-478 (Amprenavir; Glaxo) to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis<br>
against various viral mutants or members of other HIV quasi species.<br>
We prefer administering the compounds of this invention as single agents or in combination<br>
with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or other IIIV aspartyl protease inhibitors. We<br>
believe that the co-administration of the compounds of this invention with retroviral reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors or HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors may exert a substantial synergistic<br>
effect, thereby preventing, substantially reducing, or completely eliminating viral infectivity<br>
and its associated symptoms.<br>
The compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with<br>
immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF,<br>
methionine enkepIIalin, interferon alpha thethyldithiocarbamate sodium, tumor necrosis<br>
factor, naltrexone and rEPO) antibiotics (e.g., pentamidine isethionate) or vaccines to prevent<br>
or combat infection and disease associated with HIV infection, such as AIDS and ARC.<br>
When the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other<br>
agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively,<br>
pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention may be comprised<br>
of a combination of an aspartyl protease inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic agent.<br><br>
Although this invention focuses on the use of the compounds disclosed herein for preventing<br>
and treating HIV infection, the compounds of this invention can also be used as inhibitory<br>
agents for other viruses that depend on similar aspartyl proteases for obligatory events in their<br>
life cycle. These viruses include, but are not limited to, retroviruses causing AIDS-like<br>
diseases such as simian immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2, HTLV-I and HTLV-II. In<br>
addition, the compounds of this invention may also be used to inhibit other aspartyl proteases<br>
and, in particular, other human aspartyl proteases including renin and aspartyl proteases that<br>
process endothelin precursors.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally<br>
by inIIalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted<br>
reservoir. We prefer oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes<br>
subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial,<br>
intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for<br>
example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be<br>
formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable<br><br>
preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the<br>
acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are amino acid, water, Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland<br>
fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as<br>
oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are<br>
natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their<br>
polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-cIIain<br>
alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as Ph. Helv. or a similar alcohol.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited 1:0, capsules, tablets, and aqueous<br>
suspension and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used<br>
include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also<br>
typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and<br>
dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingrethent is<br>
combined with emulsifylng and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or<br>
flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a<br>
compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room<br>
temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to<br>
release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter,<br>
beeswax, and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially<br>
useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical<br>
application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be<br>
formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved<br>
in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifylng wax and water. Alternatively,<br><br>
the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing<br>
the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not<br>
limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax cetearyl<br>
alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository<br>
formulation or in a suitable neat formulation. Topically-ixansdermal patches are also included<br>
in this invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inIIalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline employlng benzyl<br>
alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enIIance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.<br>
Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 25 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably<br>
between about 0.5 and about 25 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingrethent<br>
compound are useful in the prevention and treatment of viral infection, including HIV<br>
infection. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered<br>
from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such<br>
administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy, The amount of active ingrethent that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary<br>
depending upon the patient treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical<br>
preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably,<br>
such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.<br>
Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition<br>
or combination of this invention may be administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage<br>
or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a<br>
level at which the improved condition is retained. When the symptoms IIave been alleviated<br>
to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent<br>
treatment on a long-term basis, upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.<br>
As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses tIIan those recited above may be<br>
required. Specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a<br><br>
variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health status, sex, thet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug<br>
combination, the severity and course of the infection, the patient's disposition to the infection<br>
and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
The compounds of this invention are also useful as commercial reagents which effectively<br>
bind to aspartyl proteases, particularly HIV aspartyl protease. As commercial reagents, the<br>
compounds of this invention, and their derivatives, may be used to block proteolysis of a<br>
target peptide by an aspartyl protease, or may be derivatized to bind to a stable resin as a<br>
tethered substrate for affinity chromatography applications. These and other uses which<br>
cIIaracterize commercial aspartyl protease inhibitors will be evident to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>

Step F.	Preparation of (15)-4-amino-N-(4-amino-l-hydroxymethyl-butyl)-N-isobutyl-<br>
benzenesulfonamide (VII)<br><br>
To 2.21 g of the carbamate (VI) (4.8 mmol) in 25 mL of methanol were added 230 mg of<br>
palladium on carbon 10%. The flask was closed by use of a septum through witch a needle<br>
was connected to a balloon filled with hydrogen. The septum was also pierced using a 26<br>
gauge needle serving as an exIIaust in order to generate a stream of gas over the solution. The<br>
suspension was stirred for 2 hours using 3 fills of balloons before disappearance of starting<br>
material from TLC. The mixture was filtered on a pad of celite, washed with methanol and<br>
the filtrate evaporated and dried under vacuum. This gave quantitatively (1.57 g) the free<br>
amine as a brownish foam.<br>
This is the amine used as starting material for a series of test compounds (VIII) (see general<br>
procedure A).<br>

NaBH(OAc)3 in DCM (0.5 L). AcOH (70 mL) was added to the solution. The slightly turbid<br>
mixture was stirred at 20 °C for 4 h. A 500 mL solution of 2M NaOH was added slowly to<br>
the turbid mixture and the pH adjust to 11 using a concentrated NaOH solution, and then the<br>
mixture stirred for a further 20 min. After extraction, the DCM layer was dried with MgS04,<br>
filtered and evaporated. The oil thus obtained crystallizes slowly on standing (27.8 g , 85%)<br>
and was used without further purification in the next step.<br>

Enzymatic assay for determining the inhibition constant (Ki) of synthetic compounds<br>
targeting the HIV protease<br>
This is a fluorometric assay based on the cleavage by protease of a substrate carrying a donor<br>
group (EDANS) and an acceptor group (DABCYL) on each side of the cleavage site.<br>
interacting together through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as described by<br>
Matayoshi et al. (Science 247:954-954,1990).<br>
After calculation of Vo and Vi, the inhibition constant (Ki) of the compound is determined<br>
using the equation of Henderson:<br><br><br>
where Vo = the enzyme's initial velocity<br>
Vi = the enzyme velocity in the presence of the inhibitory compound,<br>
[ I ] = inhibitor concentration, [ S ] = substrate concentration,<br>
Km = Michaelis-Menten constant and Kiapp = apparent Ki<br>
Graphs are traced and the Ki determined using GraphPad Prism software v. 3.0.<br>
Anti-viral and cytotoxicity assays in vitro<br>
■	To evaluate the EC50 of our compounds, various drug concentrations are incubated with<br>
the infected cell for six days and then the metabolic activity of the cells is monitored by<br>
the MTT assay. (See A. J. Japour et al, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 37,<br>
1095-1101, 1993 and R. Pauwels et al. Journal of Virological Methods, 20, 309-321,<br>

■	We use the laboratory viral strain NL4.3 as wild type virus and the cell line used is MT-4<br>
which is a T-cell line highly sensitive to HIV-1. We also use some WT clinical strains. To<br>
address the resistance issue we assay the inhibitors with NL4.3 mutants which are<br>
designed to be resistant to specific commercially available inhibitors<br>
■	The same MTT assay is used to evaluate the CCIC50 (cell culture IC50) of our compounds<br>
except that the virus is omitted.<br>
