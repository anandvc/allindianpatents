The present invention relates to orientation and delivering of articles such as capsules, and the like for band sealing machines, capsule filling machines, capsules sorting machines, capsule inspection machines and the other pharmaceutical machineries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Capsules are usually made in two sections, a body and a cap which is used for containing pharmaceutical or nutraceutical product in solid form or in a liquid form. However, when liquid products such as pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and the like are to be filled, it is known in the art to seal for the purpose of avoiding leak of the contents and ensuring tamper proof product. Conventionally employed methods for sealing the body and cap of the capsules wherein each capsule body is formed with either one of a radially outwardly extending circumferential projection and recess so that, when the capsule cap is mounted on the capsule body to provide the complete capsule, the circumferential projection can be received in the circumferential recess; the application of gelatin or any other solution to the overlapping joint of each closed capsule to permit the open end of each capsule cap to stick to the capsule body upon drying; and the application of gelatin or any other solution to form a binder layer at the overlapping joint of each closed capsule. For applying such a band seal or for other purposes such as for example packaging, printing etc, the closed capsules are required to be oriented at a predetermined posture and are successively supplied for applying band seal or for packaging etc.<br><br><br>
US4266477 describes an apparatus and process for transporting and orienting materials that have dissimilar ends, like capsules, to and in a predetermined orientation and position. The apparatus includes two rotatable drums a feeding drum and a transferring drum in tangential  arrangement. Each drum includes a plurality of peripherally spaced pockets sized and shaped to receive and carry individual capsules. Each drum is provided with an air jet which orients certain preselected capsules from a radial to a longitudinal position with a selected end trailing, and the capsules are then delivered to a conveyor for further processing, like printing, such as spin-printing.<br>
However, in the existing apparatus and methods the capsules are to'be oriented first and then delivered which is time consuming.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The drum assembly according to the present invention as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 comprises an drum (20) having longitudinal slots (21) for receiving articles such as capsules (11); an inner guide member (22) having a tapered<br><br>
groove (23) that is tapering towards one end for orienting the capsule (11); an outer guide member (24) having slanting portions (25) for holding the capsules (11) in horizontal position. The longitudinal slots (21) on the drum and the tapering groove (23) on the inner guide member (22) are aligned in such a manner that the tapering groove (23) and the slanting portions (25) on the outer guide member tilts the capsule (11) received on the slot of the drum in a vertical position to a horizontal position as shown in Figure 4. Referring to Figure 7, the tapering groove (23) on the inner guide member (22) has a head portion (30) and a tail portion (32). The head portion is narrower with uniform depth. The tail portion (32) is broader connected to the head portion (30) and having a slant depth gradually decreasing to zero. The tapering groove (23) is positioned perpendicular to the slots on the groove. The inner guide member (22) and the outer guide member are stationary that is they are fixed to a shaft. The drum (20) is a rotating drum that is driven by a motor and a shaft. The drum (20) rotates in a direction opposite to the direction the conveyor. Preferably, the drum (20) rotates about a rotational axis (not shown) in anticlockwise direction.<br>
The capsules (11) are received in vertical position on the slots (21) provided on the drum (20) due to the diameter and alignment of the slots (21) and grooves (23) on the inner guide member (22) with respect to the diameter of the body (11 A) and cap (11B) of the capsule (11). When the capsules (11) are fed to the drum assembly randomly, the capsules (11) are received in a vertical position as mentioned aboye either with the body (11 A) of the capsule<br><br>
(11) down or with the body (11 A) of the capsule (11) up. When the capsules (11) are received with the body (11 A) of the capsule (11) down, the body (11 A) of the capsule (11) passes through the slots of drum as the diameter of the slot is bigger than the body diameter of the capsules (11) and reaches the tapering groove (23) of the inner guide member (22). Therefore, when the drum is rotated, the tapering groove (23) on the inner guide member (22) tilts the body (11A) of the capsule (11) towards the slot (21) and the capsules (11) turn horizontally in the slot (21) of the drum (20) as shown in Figure 4. Such oriented capsules (11) are further held on a horizontal position by the guide member (24).<br>
When the capsules (11) are received on the slots with the body (11 A) of the capsule (11) up and the cap (11B) of the capsule (11) down as shown in Figure 4, the diameter of the slots being smaller than the diameter of the cap (11B) of the capsule (11), the capsule (11) remains in upward position and may not reach the tapering groove (23) of the inner guide member (22). Therefore, when the drum is rotated, the outer guide member (24) tilts the capsule (11) to an axial direction thereby orienting the capsule (11) and simultaneously delivering the same in a position parallel to the rotational axis of the rotary drum on the conveyor.<br>
Thus, on rotating the drum, the received capsules (11) are oriented and delivered in a single step i.e. simultaneously to the conveyor (17) or for any other purpose such as for example packaging, printing etc.<br><br><br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system (1) for orienting and delivering articles as shown in Figure 6 comprising a hopper<br>
(10)	for holding articles; a reciprocating magazine (12) for transferring the articles from said hopper to a drum assembly (14); the drum assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention for orienting and delivering the articles to conveyor as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, or 4; said assembly (14) being located between the reciprocating magazine (12) and the conveyor (17); said conveyor (17) being having pockets for receiving articles and located under the drum assembly (14); wherein the articles are simultaneously oriented in a direction parallel to the rotational axis of the drum and delivered to the conveyor (17) in a position parallel to the rotational axis of rotary drum.   The reciprocating magazine (12) is fitted with capsule<br>
(11)	guiding springs (16) having channels (18) for collecting and transferring the capsules (11) at a time into an each row of a drum assembly (14) as shown in Figure 5.<br>
The system (1) having the drum assembly (14) as shown in Figures 1,2, or 3 according to present invention comprises an drum (20) having slots (21) for receiving articles such as capsules (11); an inner guide member (22) having a groove (23) that is tapering towards one end for orienting the capsule (11); an outer guide member (24) having slanting portions (25) for orienting and holding the capsules (11) in horizontal position parallel to the axis of the rotary drum. The tapering groove (23) on the inner guide member (22) and the slanting portions (25) on the outer guide member (24) are aligned in such<br><br><br>
a manner that tilts the capsule (11) received on the slot in a vertical position to a horizontal position parallel to the axis of the rotary drum withinn the slot of the drum as shown in Figure 4.<br>
The drum (20) is a rotating drum being driven by a motor and a shaft. The inner guide member (22) and the outer guide member (24) are stationary and are fixed to the shaft (not shown in figure) by using bearings and brackets and clamping to the shaft or by known methods to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The reciprocating magazine (12) transfers the capsules (11) from the hopper (10) to the drum assembly (14) in a manner known to a person skilled in the art. The capsules (11) are transferred randomly either in a horizontal position or on a vertical position. However, the slots (21) on the drum (20) of the drum assembly (14) are aligned in such a manner to receive the capsules (11) in vertical position due to the difference in the diameter of the slots (21), groove<br>
(23)	on the inner guide member (22) and the diameter of the capsule (11). The capsules (11) are received with body (11 A) of the capsule (11) down or up. The capsules (11) are oriented by the tapering groove (23) on the inner guide member (22) and the slanting portion (25) on the outer guide member<br>
(24)	delivering the received capsule (11) on a horizontal position by rotating the drum (20) as described in the specification.<br>
