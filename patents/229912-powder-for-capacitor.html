DESCRIPTION<br>
Powder for Capacitor, Sintered Body thereof and Capacitor Using the Sintered Body<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is based on the provisions of 35 U.S.C. Article 111(a) with claiming the benefit of filing dates of U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/267,411 filed on February 9, 2001, under the provisions of 35 U-S.C. 111(b), pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Article 119(e) (1).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an earth-acid metal (mainly, niobium or tantalum) powder from which a capacitor having a large capacitance per unit mass and good leakage current characteristics can be produced. More specifically, the present invention relates to a niobium powder, a tantalum powder and a niobium-tantalum alloy powder, each containing a specific amount of zirconium, and also relates to a sintered body using the powder and a capacitor using the sintered body.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
Capacitors for use in electronic instruments such as potable telephone and personal computer are demanded to have a small size and a large capacitance. Among these capacitors, a tantalum capacitor is preferred because of its large capacitance for the size and good performance. In the tantalum capacitor, a sintered body of tantalum powder is generally used for the anode moiety. In order to increase the capacitance of these tantalum capacitors, it is necessary to increase the mass of the sintered body or to use a sintered body increased in the surface area by pulverizing the tantalum powder.<br>
The method of increasing the mass of the sintered body necessarily involves enlargement of the capacitor shape and cannot satisfy the requirement for downsizing. On the other hand, in the method of pulverizing tantalum powder to increase the specific surface area, the pore size of the tantalum sintered body decreases or closed pores increase at the stage of sintering and therefore, impregnation of the cathode agent in the later process becomes difficult. In order to solve these problems, a method of decreasing closed pores at the stage of sintering and a method of manufacturing a capacitor using a material having a dielectric constant larger than that of tantalum are being studied. The material having a larger dielectric constant includes niobium.<br><br>
JP-A-55-157226 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses a method for producing a sintered element for capacitors, where an agglomerated powder of niobium fine powder particles (primary powder) having a particle size of 2.0 μm or less is molded under pressure, a sintered body of the molded article is cut into fine pieces, a lead part is joined therewith and then these are again sintered. However, this patent publication does not disclose in detail the properties of the capacitor manufactured using the sintered element.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,084,965 discloses a capacitor using a niobium powder of 5.1 μm obtained by hydrogenating and pulverizing a niobium ingot. However, the niobium sintered body has a large leakage current value (hereinafter simply referred to as "LC value") and the practicability thereof is low.<br>
JP-A-10-242004 (U.S. patent 6115235) discloses a technique of improving the LC value, for example, by partially nitriding a niobium powder. However, in the case of manufacturing a high-capacitance capacitor from a niobium sintered body using a niobium powder having a fine particle size, a capacitor having a peculiarly large LC value is produced in some cases.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is<br><br>
to provide a powder for capacitors, which can provide a capacitor having a large capacitance per unit mass and a small leakage current value. The object of the present invention includes providing a sintered body using the powder and a capacitor using the sintered body.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTNION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a niobium powder, a tantalum powder and a niobium-tantalum alloy powder for capacitors, each comprising zirconium. These powder materials exhibit similar performance and accordingly, the present invention is described below using a niobium powder as an example-<br>
The capacitance of a capacitor is generally represented by the following formula:<br>
C=ex{S/d) (C:  capacitance,  E:  dielectric constant,  S:  specific surface area, and d: distance between electrodes).<br>
Here, d=kxV (k: constant, V: forming voltage), therefore, C=ex(S/(k X v)) and then CxV=(E/k)xS-Accordingly, the capacitance of a capacitor can be elevated by increasing the specific surface area (S).<br>
The first means for increasing the specific surface area of a sintered body for use in capacitors is to reduce the particle size of the powder used in the capacitor- In the present invention, the average primary particle size of the zirconium-containing niobium powder used for manufacturing a sintered body is less than 5 μm.<br><br>
so that the specific surface area of the powder particle can be increased to the practical level.<br>
The particle size and the specific surface area of the zirconium-containing niobium powder manufactured as one example by the present inventor (according to a pulverization method) are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
The average particle size (D50) shown in Table 1 indicates a particle size value when the cumulative % by mass measured using a particle size distribution measuring apparatus ("Microtrack", trade name) is 50% by mass. The specific surface area is a value measured by the BET method.<br>
As is apparent from Table 1, the specific surface area of the zirconium-containing niobium powder can be increased by reducing the average particle size thereof, however, if the average particle size of the zirconium-containing niobium powder is less than 0.2μm, the pore size becomes small and closed pores increase when a sintered body is produced, as a result, impregnation of a cathode agent in the later step becomes difficult and the<br><br>
obtained capacitor cannot have a large capacitance and cannot be suited for the practical use. On the other hand, if the average particle size is 5 μm or more, a large capacitance cannot be obtained because of decrease in the specific surface area. Accordingly, in the present invention, the average particle size of the zirconium-containing niobium powder is preferably from 0.2 to less than 5 μm,.<br>
The second means for increasing the specific surface area of a sintered body for use in capacitors is to manufacture a sintered body by using powder particles having a small average particle size while inhibiting the production of closed pores at the sintering so as not to reduce the surface area. In general, the specific surface area can be maintained by lowering the sintering temperature, however, if the sintering temperature is lowered, the strength of the sintered body decreases to readily cause breakage.<br>
In the present invention, a specific amount of zirconium is contained in the niobium powder, tantalum powder or niobium-tantalum alloy powder for use in the manufacture of a sintered body, so that a sintered body having a large specific surface area can be produced at a sintering temperature sufficiently high to obtain a necessary strength.<br><br>
The specific surface area of a zirconium-containing niobium sintered body manufactured as one example by the present inventors and the specific surface area of a niobium sintered body not containing zirconium are shown in Table 2 below.<br><br>
As is apparent from Table 2, even when the sintering is perfoirmed at a temperature sufficiently high to obtain a practical strength, a specific surface area as large as about 1.5 times the specific surface area of niobium powder not containing zirconium can be maintained by containing zirconium.<br>
Furthermore, even when a high-capacitance sintered body is manufactured using the zirconium-containing niobium powder reduced in the average particle size, a peculiar increase is not seen in the LC value. The reasons therefor are not clearly known but presumed as follows.<br>
Niobium has a high bonding strength to an oxygen<br><br>
element and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film is liable to diffuse toward the internal niobium metal side- However, in the sintered body of the present invention, the internal zirconium undertakes an interaction, such as bonding, with niobium and therefore, oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film is not easily bonded to the niobium metal inside the sintered body and is inhibited from diffusing toward the metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film can be maintained and even in the case of a capacitor having a fine particle size and a high capacitance, an effect of lowering the LC and reducing the dispersion thereof can be attained.<br>
In the present invention, the zirconium content in the niobium powder used for producing a sintered body is important. The zirconium content is preferably from 0.01 to 15 atom % and in view of the balance between the capacitance and the leakage current value of a capacitor manufactured, more preferably from 0.05 to 3 atom %.<br>
If the zirconium content is too small, the above-described oxygen in the electrolytic oxide film cannot be inhibited from diffusing toward the internal niobium metal side, as a result, the stability of the electrolytic oxide film cannot be maintained and the effect of lowering the LC cannot be obtained.  On the<br><br>
other hand, if the zirconium content is excessively large, the niobium content in the zirconium-containing niobium powder decreases and the capacitance lowers.<br>
In the present invention, the zirconium-containing niobium powder for use in the manufacture of a sintered body preferably has an average particle size of 0.2 to 5<br>
The zirconium-containing niobium powder having an average particle size within the above-described range can be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing and then dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium-zirconium alloy ingot, pellet or powder. The average particle size of the zirconium-containing niobium powder can be adjusted to a desired range by appropriately changing the amount of the niobium-zirconium alloy hydrogenated, the pulverization time, the grinding machine or the like.<br>
It is also possible to mix the thus-obtained zirconium-containing niobium powder with another niobium powder not containing zirconium and having an average particle size of 0.2 μm to less than 5 μm, so as to adjust the zirconium content.<br>
This another niobium powder can be obtained, for example, by a method of pulverizing and then dehydrogenating a hydride of niobium ingot, pellet or powder,  a method  of pulverizing a sodium reduction<br><br>
product of potassium fluoroniobate, or a method of reducing niobium oxide using an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, tantalum, niobium, aluminum, hydrogen, carbon or the like.<br>
The  zirconium-containing  niobium  powder  of  the present invention may be a mixture of a zirconium-free niobium  powder  and  a  metal  zirconium  or  zirconium compound in the powder form.  Examples of the zirconium compound which can be used include zirconium carbide, zirconium   oxide   (including   stabilized   zirconia), zirconium alkoxide, zirconium boride, zirconium nitride, zirconium sulfide, zirconium silicide, zirconium hydride, zirconium  hydroxide,   zirconium  sulfate,   zirconium silicate,   zirconium   halide,   zirconium   oxyhalide, zirconium oxyacetate and zirconium oxynitrate.   These compounds can be used individually or in combination of two or more thereof•<br>
The zirconium-containing niobium powder of the present invention can also be obtained by a method of reducing a mixture of niobium oxide and zirconium oxide using an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, tantalum, niobium, aluminum, hydrogen, carbon or the like.<br>
In the zirconium-containing niobium powder of the present invention, a part of the zirconium-containing niobium powder may be bonded with at least one of<br><br>
nitrogen, carbon, boron and sulfur so as to more improve the leakage current value. The zirconium-containing niobium powder may contain any of zirconium-containing niobium nitride, zirconium-containing niobium carbide, zirconium-containing niobium boride and zirconium-containing niobium sulfide, which are nitrogen, carbon, boron or sulfur-bonded products, respectively. These bonded products may be contained individually or in combination of two, three or four thereof.<br>
The bonded amount (the total content of nitrogen, carbon, boron and sulfur) varies depending on the shape of the zirconium-containing niobium powder, however, in the case of a powder having an average particle size of approximately from 0.2 to 5μm, the total content is from 50 to 200,000 ppm, preferably from 200 to 20,000 ppm. If the total content is less than 50 ppm, the LC characteristics are not improved, whereas if it exceeds 200,000 ppm, the capacitance characteristics are worsened and not suitable as a capacitor.<br>
The nitridation of the zirconium-containing niobium powder can be performed by liquid nitridation, ion nitridation, gas nitridation or a combination thereof. Among these, gas nitridation is preferred because the apparatus therefor is simple and the operation is easy.<br>
The gas nitridation can be performed by allowing the<br><br>
above-described zirconium-containing niobium powder to stand in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. With a nitridation atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of several hours, a zirconium-containing niobium powder having an objective nitrided amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing this treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The carbonization of the zirconium-containing niobium powder may be any one of gas carbonization, solid-phase carbonization and liquid carbonization. The zirconium-containing niobium powder may be carbonized, for example, by allowing it to stand together with a carbon material or a carbon source such as an organic material having carbon (e.g. , methane) , at 2,000oC or less under reduced pressure for several minutes to tens of hours.<br>
The boronization of the zirconium-containing niobium powder may be either gas boronization or solid-phase boronization. The zirconium-containing niobium powder may be boronized, for example, by allowing it to stand together with boron pellets or a boron source such as boron halide (e.g., trifluoroboron), at 2,000°C or less under reduced pressure for several minutes to tens of hours.<br>
The  sulfudization  of  the  zirconium-containing<br><br>
niobium powder may be any one of gas sulfudization, ion sulfudization and solid-phase sulfudization. For example, the gas sulfudization in a sulfur gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the zirconium-containing niobium powder to stand in a sulfur atmosphere. With a sulfudization atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of less than tens of hours, a zirconium-containing niobium powder having an objective sulfudized amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing the treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The zirconium-containing niobium powder for capacitors, which is used in the manufacture of a sintered body, may be obtained by granulating the zirconium-containing niobium primary powder into an appropriate shape and further, after the above-described granulation, may be mixed with an appropriate amount of a non-granulated zirconium-containing niobium powder or niobium powder.<br>
Examples of the granulation method include a method where a non-granulated zirconium-containing niobium powder is allowed to stand in a high vacuum, heated to an appropriate temperature and then cracked, and a method where a non-granulated zirconium-containing niobium powder is mixed with an appropriate binder such as<br><br>
camphor, polyacrylic acid, polymethyl acrylic acid ester or polyvinyl alcohol, and a solvent such as acetone, alcohols, acetic acid esters or water, and then cracked.<br>
By using the granulated zirconium-containing niobium powder, the press-molding property at the production of a sintered body is improved.<br>
The average particle size of the granulated powder is preferably from 20 to 500 μm. If the average particle size of the granulated powder is less than 20 μm, blocking partially takes place and bad fluidity into a metal mold results, whereas if it exceeds 500μm, the molded article after the press-molding is readily broken at the corner parts. Furthermore, when the average particle size of the granulated powder is from 60 to 250 μm, a cathode agent can be easily impregnated into the sintered body at the manufacture of a capacitor after sintering the press-molded article.<br>
The zirconium-containing niobium sintered body for capacitors of the present invention is produced by molding and sintering the above-described zirconium-containing niobium powder or granulated zirconium-containing niobium powder. The production method for the sintered body is not particularly limited, however, the sintered body may be obtained, for example, by press-molding the zirconium-containing niobium powder into a<br><br>
predetermined shape and then heating it at 500 to 2,000°C, preferably from 900 to 1,500°C, more preferably from 900 to 1,300°C, for several minutes to several hours under a pressure of 10-5 to 102 Pa.<br>
The manufacture of a capacitor device is described below.<br>
The capacitor of the present invention is fabricated from the above-described sintered body as one part electrode, a dielectric material formed on the surface of the sintered body, and another part electrode provided on the dielectric material.<br>
For example, a lead wire comprising a valve-acting metal such as niobium or tantalum and having an appropriate shape and an appropriate length is prepared and this lead wire is integrally molded at the sintering and press-molding of the niobium powder while inserting a part of the lead wire into the inside of the molded article, so that the lead wire can be designed to work out to a leading line of the sintered body.<br>
The dielectric material used for the capacitor is a dielectric material composed of, for example, a tantalum oxide, a niobium oxide, a polymer substance or a ceramic compound, preferably a dielectric material mainly composed of a niobium oxide obtained by chemically forming the zirconium-containing niobium sintered body in<br><br>
an electrolytic solution. For chemically forming the zirconium-containing niobium electrode in an electrolytic solution, an aqueous protonic acid solution is generally used, such as aqueous 0.1% phosphoric acid solution, aqueous sulfuric acid solution, aqueous 1% acetic acid solution and aqueous adipic acid solution, In the case of chemically forming the zirconium-containing niobium electrode in an electrolytic solution to obtain a niobium oxide dielectric material, the capacitor of the present invention is an electrolytic capacitor and the zirconium-containing niobium electrode serves as anode.<br>
In the capacitor of the present invention, the another part electrode is not particularly limited and for example, at least one material (compound) selected from electrolytic solutions, organic semiconductors and inorganic semiconductors known in the art of aluminum electrolytic capacitor may be used.<br>
Specific examples of the electrolytic solution include a dimethylformamide-ethylene glycol mixed solution having dissolved therein 5% by mass of an isobutyltripropylammonium borotetrafluoride electrolyte, and a propylene carbonate-ethylene glycol mixed solution having dissolved therein 7% by mass of tetraethylammonium borotetrafluoride.<br>
Specific  examples  of  the  organic  semiconductor<br><br>
include an organic semiconductor comprising a benzopyrroline tetramer and chloranile, an organic semiconductor mainly comprising tetrathiotetracene, an organic semiconductor mainly comprising tetracyanoquinodimethane, and an organic semiconductor mainly comprising an electrically conducting polymer obtained by doping a dopant into a polymer comprising two or more repeating units represented by formula (1) or (2):<br><br>
(wherein R1 to R4, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, X represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a nitrogen atom, R5 is present only when X is a nitrogen atom and represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and each of the<br><br>
pairs R1 and R2, and R3 and R4 may combine with each other to form a ring). For the dopant, any known dopant can be used without limit.<br>
Examples of the polymer containing two or more repeating units represented by formula (1) or (2) include polyaniline, polyoxyphenylene, polyphenylene sulfide, polythiophene, polyfuran, polypyrrole, polymethylpyrrole, and substitution derivatives and copolymers thereof. Among these, preferred are polypyrrole, polythiophene and substitution derivatives thereof (e.g., poly(3,4-ethylene dioxothiophene)).<br>
The term "mainly comprising an electrically conducting polymer" as used in the present specification means that even an electrically conducting polymer containing components derived from impurities in the starting material monomer of the organic semiconductor can be contained, that is, "an electrically conducting polymer is contained as a substantially effective component".<br>
Examples of the dopant which can be used include sulfoquinone-base dopants, anthracene monosulfonic acid-base dopants and other various kind of anionic dopants. Also, an electron acceptor dopant such as NO* or NO2' salt may be used.<br>
Specific examples of the inorganic semiconductor<br><br>
include an inorganic semiconductor mainly comprising lead dioxide or manganese dioxide, and an inorganic semiconductor comprising triiron tetraoxide.<br>
These semiconductors may be used individually or in combination of two or more thereof.<br>
When the organic or inorganic semiconductor used has an electrical conductivity of 10-2 to 103 S-cm-1, the fabricated capacitor can have a smaller impedance value and can be more increased in the capacitance at a high frequency.<br>
In the case where the another part electrode is solid, an electrically conducting layer may be provided thereon so as to attain good electrical contact with an exterior leader line (for example, lead frame).<br>
The electrically conducting layer can be formed, for example, by the solidification of electrically conducting paste, the plating, the metallization or the formation of heat-resistant electrically conducting resin film. Preferred examples of the electrically conducting paste include silver paste, copper paste, aluminum paste, carbon paste and nickel paste, and these may be used individually or in combination of two or more thereof. In the case of using two or more kinds of pastes, these pastes may be mixed or may be superposed one on another as separate layers.  The electrically conducting paste<br><br>
applied is then solidified by allowing it to stand in an air or under heating. Examples of the plating include nickel plating, copper plating, silver plating and aluminum plating. Examples of the metal to be vapor-deposited include aluminum, nickel, copper and silver.<br>
More specifically, for example, carbon paste and silver paste are stacked in this order on the another part electrode and these are molded with a material such as epoxy resin, thereby fabricating a capacitor. This capacitor may have a niobium or tantalum lead which is sintered and molded integrally with the zirconium-containing niobium sintered body or welded afterward.<br>
The thus-fabricated capacitor of the present invention is jacketed using, for example, resin mold, resin case, metallic jacket case, dipping of resin or letminate film, and then used as a capacitor product for various uses.<br>
In the case where the another part electrode is liquid, the capacitor fabricated from the above-described two electrodes and the dielectric material is housed, for example, in a can electrically connected to the another part electrode to form a capacitor. In this case, the electrode side of the zirconium-containing niobium sintered body is guided outside through a niobium or tantalum lead described above and at the same time.<br><br>
insulated from the can using an insulating rubber or the like.<br>

Example 1 : Sintered Body of Zirconium-Containing Niobium Powder:<br>
Using 92 g of a niobium ingot and 1 g of a zirconium powder, a zirconium-containing niobium ingot having a zirconium content of 1 mol% was produced by arc melting.<br><br>
In an SUS 304-made reactor, 50 g of the obtained ingot was  placed and hydrogen was  continuously introduced thereinto at 400°C for 10 hours.   After cooling, the hydrogenated zirconium-containing niobium lump was placed in an SUS 304-made pot containing SUS-made balls and pulverized for 10 hours.  Thereafter, this hydride was formed into a 20 vol% slurry with water, charged together with zirconia balls into an SUS 304-made wet grinding machine, and wet pulverized for 7 hours.  The resulting slurry  was  centrifuged  and  decanted  to  obtain  a pulverized product.  The pulverized product was dried in a vacuum under the conditions of 133 Pa (1 Torr) and SO^^C.     Subsequently,   the  hydrogenated   zirconium-containing niobium powder was dehydrogenated by heating at 400°C under 1.33x10"^ Pa (IxlO"* Torr) for 1 hour.  The produced  zirconium-containing  niobium  powder  had  an average particle size of 1.0 \xm  and the zirconium content thereof was measured by the atomic absorption analysis and found to be 1 mol%- The thus-obtained zirconium-containing niobium powder was granulated in a vacuum of 4x10-3 Pa  (3x10-5 Torr)  at  1,000oC.   Thereafter,  the granulated lump was cracked to obtain a granulated powder having an average particle size of 120 μm.<br>

manufacture a molded article having a size of approximately 0. 3x0.18x0.45 cm (about 0-1 g) . This molded article was allowed to stand in a vacuum of 4x10-3 Pa (3x10-5 Torr) at 1,200°C for 30 minutes and thereby, a sintered body was obtained. The tensile strength of the niobium wire of this sintered body was measured and found to be 3 kg/cm2 {2. 9x105 Pa), revealing that the sintered body had a sufficiently high strength. Subsequently, the sintered body obtained was electrochemically formed in an aqueous 0.1% phosphoric acid solution at a temperature of 80oC for 200 minutes by applying a voltage of 20 V to form a dielectric layer on the surface. Thereafter, the capacitance in 30% sulfuric acid and the leakage current (hereinafter simply referred to as "LC") in an aqueous 20% phosphoric acid solution were measured.
