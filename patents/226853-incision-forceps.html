3.	PREAMEiLE TO THE<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to surgical instrument meant for cutting, holding and<br>
grasping the tissues, blood vessels and tubules in many surgical procedures like<br>
vasography, delivery of drugs to seminal vesicle and other cases of Incision and<br>
Drainage(I&amp;D).<br>
Background:<br>
In tropical countries like India where there is a cycle of weather changes round the year and during the peak of a particular season the weather conditions like temperature and humidity reach to its extreme levels. For example during the summer and monsoon seasons the conditions are extremely hot and humid.<br>
In such conditions formation of "minor abscess" is one of the most common ailments affecting a very large number of population, more particularly poorly inhabited population.<br>
For these minor abscesses, surgical procedure called "Incision and Drainage" is adopted. Besides this there are many other surgical procedures like vasography, delivery of drugs to seminal vesicle, and puncture of epidermis etc. where a minor surgery is performed.<br>
To perform such surgical operations different surgical instruments are required. Some of the most common instruments being the forceps like haemostatic forceps, dissecting forceps and surgical blades. Whereas the use of surgical blade being limited to make a minor cut. The surgical blade used is the common surgical blade made of stainless steel or carbon steel, which is used, fitted in a handle to hold it. The blade is used only once and is disposed off. For each surgery a new blade is required making it a costly affair in a country like India where majority of population still survives below poverty line and availability of new blades for each patient in government hospitals and dispensaries located in far distant villages is still a dream. Whereas other surgical instruments like forceps and scissors are sterilized and reused.<br>
Vasography is indicated in men with at least one palpable vas deferens azoospermia, and a testis biopsy indicating normal spermatogenesis, or in men<br><br>
with low-volume ejaculates with poorly motile sperm in whom ejaculatory duct obstruction is possible. To perform vasography the vas is approached through a vertical 3 - 4-cm incision in the upper scrotum, the testis is delivered, and the vas is separated from adjacent spermatic cord structures at the junction of the straight and convoluted portions. Care is taken to isolate the vas cleanly, preserving the vasal vessels.<br>
Similarly to find out any obstruction in the ejaculatory duct seminal vesicle sperm aspiration and seminal Vesiculography is performed.<br>
The commonly used forceps is a standard haemostatic forceps comprising a scissor-like construction that includes a locking mechanism for the two arms at the handle end. The grasping tips, at the end of the arms opposite the handles, have mating saw tooth extensions, which meet in the line perpendicular to the lengthwise extension of the instrument and are used to clamp the tissue. Because of the large area defined by the tips of the standard forceps, additional tissue is also often grasped and elevated along with the vas deferns. The long end structure defined by standard forceps also frequently permits the vas deferns to escape out of surgeon's grips.<br>
Several attempts have been made to overcome the problem associated with the<br>
use of standard forceps and surgical blades in procedures requiring minor<br>
surgeries.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5725539, issued to Ulrich Matem on March 10, 1998, discloses a<br>
surgical instrument used to clamp a vessel, hollow organ or the like. The<br>
instrument has essentially a lock assembly with a thread holder and a shaft-like<br>
lock assembly holder that can be coupled to the lock assembly and has actuating<br>
members for opening and closing the lock assembly thread holder. The<br>
instrument has two clamping jaws meant for grasping and holding.<br>
U.S. Patent No.5618305, issued to Fritz Logane on April 08,1997, discloses a<br>
forceps for grasping and manipulating tubular vessels of tissue such as vas<br>
difference and vagus nerve, which comprises a needle-nose style-grasping end<br>
with a clamping loop at the extreme tip. Fritz's forceps hole has a beveled rear<br>
edge that aids in grasping a rotating tissue held in the loop.<br>
Like wise U.S. Patent No. 5282812, issued to Luis Surarez on February 01, 1994,<br>
provides a surgical clamp for the temporary occlusion of a blood vessel during a<br>
surgical procedure and forceps-like instrument.<br>
Similarly U.S. Patent No. 4185634, issued to Bruce M. Freedman on January 29,<br>
1980, discloses a surgical blade for incisions and other surgical operations to be<br>
performed in a narrow space or area such as minor surgery. Bruce's instrument<br>
comprises a stem portion, which may be received by a handle for holding the<br>
instrument, and a blade portion connected from the stem portion and<br>
terminating in a tip. The surgical blade is preferably for surgery requiring an<br>
incision in the skin.<br>
Also in the prior art, U.S. Patent No. 5908432 issued to Huai C. Pan on Jun 01,<br>
1999, provides a scalpel with a retractable blade comprising a handle having a<br><br>
proximal section grasped by the surgeon and a distal section, and a blade holder slidable in a channel defined in the distal section of the handle. All the prior arts as recited above disclose forceps meant for grasping, clamping or holding and the surgical blades meant for making incision during the surgical operations. Both of these instruments are required by the surgeon for surgical interventions but there is no prior art available which can be used as a single device instead of two instruments as recited above, during minor surgeries.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
As it has been already proposed the invention relates to a surgical instrument for performing minor operations like Incision &amp; Drainage, vasography, seminal vesicle sperm aspiration and seminal vesiculography.<br>
The primary object of this invention is providing a surgical instrument, which can be used as a single instrument eliminating the use of two instruments like haemostatic forceps and surgical blades.<br>
Another object of this invention is providing an instrument completely eliminating the use of surgical blades.<br>
Further object of this invention is providing a cost effective way of surgery and eliminating the problem of non-availability of the surgical blades, by sterilizing and reusing the instrument.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the present invention, object is achieved by a scissor-like incision forceps which comprises: a pair of elongated arms<br>
a pivot joint connecting the arms; each arm on one side of the pivot joint comprising a handle and a locking device to lock the arms in closed position; each arm on the other side of the pivot joint comprising a grasping section; each said grasping section terminating in a sharp needle-nose like pointed tip; the said tip defining a curved structure terminating in a curved pointed tip. The curved needle-nose like pointed tip providing means for making incision like a surgical blade and the grasping section comprising means for grasping and holding the skin or vessels.<br>
Thus the present invention provides numerous advantages over the prior art and has been described in the following description with reference but not limited to preferred embodiments.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING :<br>
FIG 1 is a top plan dorsal view of the present invention in a closed position. FIG 2 is a top plan dorsal view of the present invention in an open position. FIG 3 is the plan ventral view of the present invention in an open position FIG 4 is a side view of a partial profile of the forceps featuring the curved pointed tip of the present invention in a closed position.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
The present invention is a surgical instrument for making incision, grasping and holding the skin or blood vessels during minor surgeries. Referring to figs 1-4, a forceps 1 includes arms 2,3 each having handle sections 8,9 at a first end 12. The handle sections 8,9 have saw-tooth extensions 6,7 projecting inwards from the handle sections 8,9. The saw-tooth extensions 6,7 engage one another when the forceps 1 is in a closed position as shown in FIG 1. The arms 2,3 also having pivoting sections 4,5 next to the handle sections 2,3. Along these pivoting sections 4,5, the arms 2,3 cross one another and are connected at their crossing by a crossover stud 13 as shown in FIG 1-3. The arms 2,3 additionally have grasping sections 10,11 at a second end 14. The grasping sections 10,11 terminating in a pair of needle-nose like sharp pointed tips 15,16.The tips 15,16 are curved structures making the curvature towards one side known as ventral side of the invention as shown in Figs 2, 3.The needle-nose like pointed tip most preferably makes an angle a which varies in the range from 35 degree to 42 degrees from the horizontal plane. Further this angle a may vary from 0 to 90 degree.<br>
As may be seen from FIG 4 particularly; the juxtaposition of such grasping sections 10,11, upon placement of the forceps 1 in a closed orientation form substantially curved pointed tip 15.<br>
In profile, the grasping sections 10 and 11 are identical and have smooth lateral surfaces; like wise the curved pointed tips 15 and 16 are identical to each other. Both of these sections 10,11 and 15,16, when taken together in a closed position, form a tightly gripped, sharp, pointed and slightly curved tipped end 14 of the invention as shown in FIG 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
