Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to methods of treating cancer with a<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The invention also relates to methods of measuring the amounts and concentrations of the inhibitor and its metabolites after administration of the inhibitor to a subject.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003]	Capillaries reach into almost all tissues of the human body and<br>
supply tissues with oxygen and nutrients as well as removing waste products. Under typical conditions, the endothelial cells lining the capillaries do not divide, and capillaries, therefore, do not normally increase in number or size in a human adult. Under certain normal conditions, however, such as when a tissue is damaged, or during certain parts of the menstrual cycle, the capillaries begin to proliferate rapidly. This process of forming new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels is known as angiogenesis or neovascularization. See Folkman, J. Scientific American 275,150-154 (1996). Angiogenesis during wound healing is an example of<br><br>
pathophysiological neovascularization during adult life. During wound healing, the additional capillaries provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients, promote granulation tissue, and aid in waste removal. After termination of the healing process, the capillaries normally regress. Lymboussaki, A. "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors and their Receptors in Embryos, Adults, and in Tumors" Academic Dissertation, University of Helsinki, Molecular/Cancer Biology Laboratory and Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute, (1999).<br>
[0004]	Angiogenesis also plays an important role in the growth of<br>
cancer cells. It is known that once a nest of cancer cells reaches a certain size, roughly 1 to 2 mm in diameter, the cancer cells must develop a blood supply in order for the tumor to grow larger as diffusion will not be sufficient to supply the cancer cells with enough oxygen and nutrients.<br>
[0005]	Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane<br>
polypeptides that regulate developmentafcell growth and differentiation, remodeling and regeneration of adult tissues. Mustonen, T. et al., J. Cell Biology 129, 895-898 (1995); van der Geer, P. et al. Ann Rev. Cell Biol. 10, 251-337 (1994). Polypeptide ligands known as growth factors or cytokines, are known to activate RTKs. Signaling RTKs involves ligand binding and a shift in conformation in the external domain of the receptor resulting in its dimerization. Lymboussaki, A. "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors and their Receptors in Embryos, Adults, and in Tumors" Academic Dissertation, University of Helsinki, Molecular/Cancer Biology Laboratory and Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute, (1999); Ullrich, A. etal., Cell 61,203-212 (1990). Binding of the ligand to the RTK results in receptor trans-phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues and subsequent activation of the catalytic domains for the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates. Id.<br>
[0006]	Two subfamilies of RTKs are specific to the vascular<br>
endothelium. These include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) subfamily and the Tie receptor subfamily. Class III RTKs include VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. Shibuya, M. et al., Oncogene 5, 519-525 (1990);<br>
2<br><br>
Terman, B. et al., Oncogene 6,1677-1683 (1991); Aprelikova, O. etal., Cancer Res. 52, 746-748 (1992).<br>
[0007]	Members of the VEGF subfamily have been described as being<br>
able to induce vascular permeability and endothelial cell proliferation and further identified as a major inducer of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Ferrara, N. et al., Endocrinol. Rev. 18,4-25 (1997). VEGF is known to specifically bind to RTKs including VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. DeVries, C. et al., Science 255, 989-991 (1992); Quinn, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90, 7533-7537 (1993). VEGF stimulates the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and induces angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Connolly, D. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20017-20024 (1989); Connolly, D. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 84,1470-1478 (1989); Ferrara, N. et al., Endocrino. Rew. 18,4-25 (1997); Leung, D. et al., Science 246,1306-1309 (1989); Plouet, J. et al., EMBO J 8, 3801-3806 (1989).<br>
[0008]	Because angiogenesis is known to be critical to the growth of<br>
cancer and to be controlled by VEGF and VEGF-RTK, substantial efforts have been undertaken to develop therapeutics that are antagonists of VEGF-RTK to thereby inhibit or retard angiogenesis, and, hopefully, interfere or stop tumor proliferation.<br>
[0009]	Platelet derived growth factor receptor kinase (PDGFRK) is<br>
another type of RTK. PDGF expression has been shown in a number of different solid tumors, from glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these various tumor types, the biological role of PDGF signaling can vary from autocrine stimulation of cancer cell growth to more subtle paracrine interactions involving adjacent stroma and angiogenesis. Therefore, inhibiting the PDGFR kinase activity with small molecules may interfere with tumor growth and angiogenesis.<br>
[0010]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one is a small molecule inhibitor of VEGF-RTK, PDGF-<br>
3<br><br>
RTK and other receptor tyrosine kinases such as fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF-RTK). This compound has been described in a patent and several patent applications, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference and for all purposes: U.S. Patent No. 6,605,617, U.S.S.N. 10/644,055, U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/405,729, 60/428,210, and 60/484,048. Specific methods for administering this compound are needed as are methods for determining the metabolic profile of this potent anticancer agent.<br>

While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the present methods of treating cancer are effective against solid tumors because the compound of formula I acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor. More specifically, the compound of formula I and its active metabolites are believed<br>
18<br><br>
to selectively inhibit certain receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor angiogenesis and in leukemias.<br>
[0048]	In some embodiments, the present methods of treating cancer<br>
further include administering the compound of formula I as part of a treatment cycle. A treatment cycle includes an administration phase during which the compound is given to the subject on a regular basis and a holiday, during which the compound is not administered.

Suspension formulations may include alcohols, such as, but not limited to, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, glycerol and propylene glycol. Ethers, such as but not limited to, poly(ethyleneglycol), petroleum hydrocarbons such as mineral oil and petrolatum; and water may also be used in suspension formulations.<br>
[0072]	For intranasal administration (e.g., to deliver compounds to the<br>
brain), or administration by inhalation (e.g., to deliver compounds through the lungs), the pharmaceutical formulations may be a solution, a spray, a dry powder, or aerosol containing any appropriate solvents and optionally other<br>
31<br><br>
compounds such as, but not limited to, stabilizers, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these. Examples of intranasal formulations and methods of administration can be found in WO 01/41782, WO 00/33813, WO 91/97947, U.S. Patent No. 6,180,603, and U.S. Patent No. 5,624,898. A propellant for an aerosol formulation may include compressed air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a hydrocarbon based low boiling solvent. The compound or compounds of the instant invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from a nebulizer or the like.<br>
[0073]	Injectable dosage forms generally include aqueous suspensions<br>
or oil suspensions which may be prepared using a suitable dispersant or wetting agent and a suspending agent. Injectable forms may be in solution phase or in the form of a suspension, which is prepared with a solvent or diluent. Acceptable solvents or vehicles include sterilized water, Ringer's solution, or an isotonic aqueous saline solution. Alternatively, sterile oils may be employed as solvents or suspending agents. Preferably, the oil or fatty acid is non-volatile, including natural or synthetic oils, fatty acids, mono-, di- or tri-glycerides.<br>
[0074]	For injection, the pharmaceutical formulation may be a powder<br>
suitable for reconstitution with an appropriate solution as described above. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, freeze dried, rotary dried or spray dried powders, amorphous powders, granules, precipitates, or particulates. For injection, the formulations may optionally contain stabilizers, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these. The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection such as by bolus injection or continuous infusion. A unit dosage form for injection may be in ampoules or in multi-dose containers.<br>
[0075]	Thus, in the present methods of treating cancer described<br>
herein, the compound may be administered by injection as a short bolus, slow infusion, or long-term infusion. The injection may be administered once,<br>
32<br><br>
twice, three times, or four times daily. A short boius is generally administered over a period of about 1 to 30 minutes; a slow infusion is generally administered over a period of about 30 minutes to 6 hours; and a long-term infusion is generally administered for a period from over 6. hours up to about seven days.<br>
[0076]	For rectal administration, the pharmaceutical formulations may<br>
be in the form of a suppository, an ointment, an enema, a tablet or a cream for release of compound in the intestines, sigmoid flexure and/or rectum. Rectal suppositories are prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the instant invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or tautomers of the compound, with acceptable vehicles, for example, cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol, which is present in a solid phase at normal storing temperatures, and present in a liquid phase at those temperatures suitable to release a drug inside the body, such as in the rectum. Oils may also be employed in the preparation of formulations of the soft gelatin type and suppositories. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycerols may be employed in the preparation of suspension formulations which may also contain suspending agents such as pectins, carbomers, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose, as well as buffers and preservatives.<br>
[0077]	Besides those representative dosage forms described above,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers are generally known to those skilled in the art and are thus included in the instant invention. Such excipients and carriers are described, for example, in "Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences" Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey (1991), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0078]	The formulations of the invention may be designed for to be<br>
short-acting, fast-releasing, long-acting, and sustained-releasing as described below. Thus, the pharmaceutical formulations may also be formulated for controlled release or for slow release.<br>
33<br><br>
[0079]	The instant compositions may also comprise, for example,<br>
micelles or liposomes, or some other encapsulated form, or may be administered in an extended release form to provide a prolonged storage and/or delivery effect. Therefore, the pharmaceutical formulations may be compressed into pellets or cylinders and implanted intramuscularly or subcutaneously as depot injections or as implants such as stents. Such implants may employ known inert materials such as silicones and biodegradable polymers.<br>
[0080]	A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the<br>
compound that results in amelioration of symptoms. Specific dosages may be adjusted depending on conditions of disease, the age, body weight, general health conditions, sex, diet of the subject, dose intervals, administration routes, excretion rate, and combinations of drugs. Any of the above dosage forms containing effective amounts are well within the bounds of routine experimentation and therefore, well within the scope of the instant invention. A therapeutically effective dose may vary depending upon the route of administration and dosage form. The preferred compound or compounds of the instant invention is a formulation that exhibits a high therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects which can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50- The LD50 is the dose lethal to 50% of the population and the ED5o is the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. The LD50 and ED50 are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental animals.<br>
[0081]	The present invention also provides methods of enhancing<br>
anticancer activity in a human or non-human animal. The method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound, or composition, of the instant invention to said mammal or non-human animal. Effective amounts of the compounds of the instant invention include those amounts that inhibit RTK, which are detectable, for example, by an assay herein described, or any other assay known by those skilled in the art that detect signal transduction, in<br>
34<br><br>
a biochemical pathway, through activation of G-protein coupled receptors, for example, by measuring an elevated cAMP level as compared to a control model. Effective amounts may also include those amounts which alleviate symptoms of a RTK disorder treatable by inhibiting RTK..<br>
[0082]	An RTK disorder, or RTK-mediated disease, which may be<br>
treated by those methods provided, include any biological disorder or disease in which an RTK is implicated, or which inhibition of and RTK potentiates a biochemical pathway that is defective in the disorder or disease state. Examples of such diseases are cancers such as prostate, colorectal, breast, multiple myeloma, pancreatic, small cell carcinoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelo-proliferative disease.<br>

Example 1<br>
[0086]	The antiproliferative activities of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one (compound 1) were tested against a large number of cancer cell lines and primary non-malignant cell lines. Methods were as follows: Cells were plated in 96-well plates; after three to five hours gelling time for adherent cell lines delusions of the compounds were added, three days later viable cells were determined by adding MTS solution (Promega). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured and ECso values calculated using non linear regression. For the HMVEC assay, compounds were incubated with the cells for three days in the presence of five ng/mL recombinant VEGF. For the SCF/c-KIT assay the TF-1 and H526 cells were incubated for three days in the presence of 40 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL recombinant SCF, respectively. Proliferation was assayed by adding MTS solution and measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. ECsos were calculated by non-linear regression. Results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0087]	In a subset of the cancer cell lines and the endothelial cells,<br>
proliferation was inhibited with EC50 
[0088]	The majority of cell lines showed an antiproliferative response<br>
when incubated with compound 1 with EC50S between 1 and 10 uM including r    two primary cell lines HMEC (human normal mammary epithelial cells) and<br>
37<br><br>
PrEC (normal human prostate epithelial cells). Consistent with in vitro results, the growth of both the KM12L4a and MV4;11 xenografts in mice were potently inhibited by compound 1 in vivo.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
all cell lines tested were of human origin unless otherwise noted.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0089]	Two metabolites of compound 1 were identified and partially<br>
characterized in pooled rat plasma from a 2 week toxicology study. Day 1 and day 14 dosed animal plasmas were analyzed by UV and LC/MS from once a day 30 or 80 mg/kg, PO, dose groups. The two identified metabolites were the piperazine N-oxide compound of formula II (compound 2) and the N-<br>
38<br><br>
demethylated compound of formula III (compound 3) (see Example 6 for synthesis and characterization of these compounds). Estimated levels of the metabolites (based on UV absorbance and in comparison to known levels of compound 1 quantified in the same samples from previous analyses) are given in Table 2. The N-desmethyl metabolite was found to be in substantially lower abundance than compound 1 in all samples of post dosed pooled plasmas. The N-oxide metabolite was observed to be present in lower abundance than compound 1 except at 24 hours on day 14 in the 80 mg/kg dose group and 1-2 hours on day 1 in the 30 mg/kg dose group (Table 2). The metabolic profile does not change with dose or duration of dose. Generally the metabolite levels increase in tandem with compound 1 levels with dose escalation.<br>
[0090]	With both dose groups, the duration of dose, Day 1 vs 14, does<br>
not appear to result in an increase in plasma levels of metabolites alone (Table 2) or as compared to compound 1 levels. Compound 1 levels decrease with duration of dose and this is reflected by a decrease in metabolite levels as well. This suggests that time dependent reduction in exposure of compound 1 is not reflected in increased metabolism. The day 14,24 hr samples contained compound 1 and metabolites at lower levels than the 24 hour samples on day 1 indicating that there is no accumulation of metabolites or compound 1 with a once a day dosage regimen of 30 or 80 mg/kg. The N-oxide metabolite is present in higher abundance than the N-desmethyl metabolite at all assayed time points in the 80 mg/kg dose group and in all but the 24 hr time points after day 1 in the 30 mg/kg dose group. The N-desmethyl metabolite levels appear to fall more slowly than that of compound 1 suggesting a longer T1/2 and indicating that the plasma levels of this metabolite are likely determined by its rate of elimination and not its rate of formation as is, in contrast, likely for the N-oxide.<br>

Example 3 In vitro kinase assays for receptor tyrosine kinases<br>
[0091]	The kinase activity of a number of protein tyrosine kinases was<br>
measured by providing ATP and an appropriate peptide or protein containing a tyrosine amino acid residue for phosphorylation, and assaying for the transfer of phosphate moiety to the tyrosine residue. Recombinant proteins corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of the FLT-1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, VEGFR3, Tie-2, PDGFRa, PDGFRp, and FGFR1 receptors were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a Baculovirus expression system (InVitrogen) and may be purified via Glu antibody interaction (for Glu-epitope tagged constructs) or by Metal Ion Chromatography (for His6 (SEQ ID NO: 1) tagged constructs). For each assay, test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO and then mixed with an appropriate kinase reaction buffer plus ATP. Kinase<br>
40<br><br>
protein and an appropriate biotinylated peptide substrate were added to give a final volume of 50-100 ?L, reactions were incubated for 1-3 hours at room temperature and then stopped by addition of 25-50 p.L of 45 mM EDTA, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5. The stopped reaction mixture (75 ?L) was transferred to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated for 1 hour. Phosphorylated peptide product was measured with the DELFIA time-resolved fluorescence system (Wallac or PE Biosciences), using a Europium labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PT66 with the modification that the DELFIA assay buffer was supplemented with 1 mM MgCI2 for the antibody dilution. Time resolved fluorescence was read on a Wallac 1232 DELFIA fluorometer or a PE Victor II multiple signal reader. The concentration of each compound for 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated employing non-linear regression using XL Fit data analysis software.<br>
[0092]	FLT-1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, FGFR3, Tie-2, and FGFR1 kinases<br>
were assayed in 50 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCI2,10 mM MnCI2l 1 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/mL BSA, 2 yM ATP, and 0.20-0.50 ?M corresponding biotinylated peptide substrate. FLT-1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, Tie-2, and FGFR1 kinases were added at 0.1 ?g/mL, 0.05 ?g/mL, or 0.1 ?g/mL respectively. For the PDGFR kinase assay, 120 ?g/mL enzyme with the same buffer conditions as above was used except for changing ATP and peptide substrate concentrations to 1.4 ?M ATP, and 0.25 ?M biotin-GGLFDDPSYVNVQNL-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 2) peptide substrate. Each of the above compounds displayed an IC50 value of less than 10 ?M with respect to FLT-1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, andFGFR1.<br>
[0093]	Recombinant and active tyrosine kinases Fyn, and Lck are<br>
available commercially and were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. For each assay, test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO and then mixed with an appropriate kinase reaction buffer plus 10 nM 33P gamma-labeled ATP. The kinase protein and the appropriate biotinylated peptide substrate were added to give a final volume of 150 ?L. Reactions were incubated for 3-<br>
41<br><br>
4 hours at room temperature and then stopped by transferring to a streptavidin-coated white microtiter plate (Thermo Labsystems) containing 100 ?l of stop reaction buffer of 100 mM EDTA and 50 ?M unlabeled ATP. After 1 hour incubation, the streptavidin plates were washed with PBS and 200 ?L Microscint 20 scintillation fluid was added per well. The plates were sealed and counted using TopCount. The concentration of each compound for 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated employing non-linear regression using XL Fit data analysis software.<br>
[0094]	The kinase reaction buffer for Fyn, Lck, and c-ABL contained 50<br>
mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5,15 mM MgCI2, 30 mM MnCI2, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM beta-glycerol phosphate, 0.01% BSA/PBS, 0.5 ?M of the appropriate peptide substrate (biotinylated Src peptide substrate: biotin-GGGGKVEKIGEGTYGWYK-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 3) for Fyn and Lck), 1 ?M unlabeled ATP, and 1 nM kinase.<br>
[0095]	The kinase activity of c-Kit and FLT-3 were measured by<br>
providing ATP and a peptide or protein containing a tyrosine amino acid residue for phosphorylation, and assaying for the transfer of phosphate moiety to the tyrosine residue. Recombinant proteins corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of the c-Kit and FLT-3 receptors were purchased (Proquinase). For testing, an exemplary compound, for example 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methy!piperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1 H)-one, was diluted in DMSO and then mixed with the kinase reaction buffer described below plus ATP. The kinase protein (c-Kit or FLT-3) and the biotinylated peptide substrate (biotin-GGLFDDPSYVNVQNL-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 2)) were added to give a final volume of 100 uL. These reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature and then stopped by addition of 50 uL of 45 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. The stopped reaction mixture (75 uL) was transferred to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated for 1 hour. Phosphorylated peptide product was measured with the DELPHIA time-resolved fluorescence system (Wallac or<br>
42<br><br>
PE Biosciences), using a Europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PT66, with the modification that the DELFIA assay buffer was supplemented with 1 mM MgCI2 for the antibody dilution. Time resolved fluorescence values were determined on a Wallac 1232 DELFIA fluorometer or a PE Victor II multiple signal reader. The concentration of each compound for 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated employing non-linear regression using XL Fit data analysis software.<br>
[0096]	FLT-3 and c-Kit kinases were assayed in 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5,<br>
1 mM NaF, 2 mM MgCI2,10 mM MnCI2 and 1mg/mL BSA, 8 uM ATP and 1 uM of corresponding biotinylated peptide substrate (biotin-GGLFDDPSYVNVQNL-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 2)). The concentration of FLT-3 and c-Kit kinases were assayed at 2 nM.<br>
ICsos were measured for the metabolites of compound 1 and are shown in Table 3 along with IC50S of compound 1 for comparison.<br>

Example 4<br>
[0097]	This single agent study evaluated daily oral dosing of compound<br>
1 in the KM12L4a human colon tumor model.<br>
43<br><br>
[0098]	Female Nu/Nu mice, aged 7-8 weeks (Charles River), were<br>
implanted with 2x106 KM12L4a cells subcutaneously in the right flank. Treatment began 7 days later when average tumor volume was 125 mm3. This was designated as study day 1. Compound 1 was formulated as a solution in 10 mM H3PO4 and administered by oral gavage.<br>
[0099]	Seven treatment groups were included in the study,<br>
(n=10/group): vehicle (water) p.o., q.d.; and six groups of compound 1 doses: 3,10, 30,100, 200, 300 mg/kg p.o., q.d.<br>
[0100]	Plasma samples were drawn from satellite animals in each dose<br>
group on various days to characterize the pharmacokinetics of compound 1 in tumor-bearing mice (N=2/timepoint/dose group). Tissue and tumor concentrations of compound 1 were determined in samples collected from animals in the 100 and 200 mg/kg dose group at 8 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 22 (N=2/timepoint/dose group).<br>
[0101]	Plasma compound 1 concentrations were determined by a non-<br>
validated LC/MS/MS assay with a calibration range of 1 to 8000 ng/mL and a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL (Charles River Laboratories, Worcester, MA. Tissue and tumor compound 1 concentrations were also determined using a non-validated LC/MS/MS assay with a calibration range of 20 to 43740 ng/g and a LLOQ of 20 ng/g.<br>
[0102]	Composite pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC) were<br>
obtained using standard noncompartmental analysis from mean plasma compound concentration-time data in each dose group on each sampling day (WinNonlin Professional, version 4). The reported AUC values were determined using 3 concentration-time data points. Predose concentration values were reported as those observed immediately prior to dosing.<br>
[0103]	Significant dose-dependent inhibition in tumor growth was<br>
observed at all doses by 4-7 days of treatment (see Table 4). The calculated ED5o was 17 mg/kg. Tumor regressions of &gt; 50% of initial size were observed<br>
44<br><br>
in the majority of mice dosed with compound 1 at 200 and 300 mg/kg, however these doses were not tolerated for the entire study duration. By days 12-16, mice treated with 300 mg/kg lost 20-30% body weight and were euthanized. In those treated with 200 mg/kg, 1 of 10 was euthanized on day 14 with 22% wt loss, and the remaining mice were euthanized days 21-24 with &gt; 25% weight loss. Mice were dosed for 37 days with 100 mg/kg and remained at 98% of initial weight; tumors remained stable at this dose (Figure 1). The vehicle group was taken down on day 9, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated. (Table 4).<br>
Table 4.       Dose resoonse activitv of Comoound 1<br><br>
[0104]	On the second day of dosing (Day 2), plasma concentrations of<br>
compound 1 increased proportionally with dose (Table 5) in all dosing groups. Following multiple dosing for at least 2 weeks, plasma concentrations were comparable to those on Day 2, suggesting no accumulation upon once daily dosing in mice (Table 5). Similarly, predose plasma concentration of compound 1 collected on Days 3, 8, and 15 were similar within each dose group, suggesting that steady state was reached after Day 2. Therefore,<br>
45<br><br>
these data suggest that compound 1 follows dose-and time-independent pharmacokinetics in tumor-bearing mice.<br>
[0105]	Tumor growth inhibition of 35-60% was observed at doses of 10<br>
and 30 mg/kg, respectively. The corresponding plasma exposure of compound 1, as assessed by Cmax and AUC values, ranged from 163-742 ng/mL and 1420-5540 ng*hr/mL, respectively (Figure 2). The corresponding plasma predose concentration values ranged from 2-135 ng/mL.<br>

* Predose concentrations<br>
[0106]	Tissue concentrations of compound 1 on Day 22 were higher<br>
than those in plasma in the 100 and 200 mg/kg dose groups at each of the two sampling times (8 and 24 hours postdose) (Table 6). Brain or heart concentrations of compound 1 were 13- to 34-fold higher than those in plasma; whereas liver, lung, and kidney concentrations were 40- to 126-fold higher than those in plasma at 8 or 24 hours postdose in these two dose groups. In general, the ratio of tissue-to-pfasma concentrations at 8 hours<br>
47<br><br>
was comparable to that at 24 hours. Furthermore, tissue concentrations at 24 hours were consistently lower compared to those at 8 hours. Taken together, these results suggest that tissue concentrations of compound 1 appeared to decline in parallel with those in plasma. Therefore, compound 1 appears to be widely distributed into tissues (including brain) relative to plasma but does not accumulate in tissues following multiple oral dosing.<br>
Table 6.       Mean Tissue, Tumor and Plasma Concentrations on Day 22 Following Once-Daily Oral Administration of 100 or 200 mg/kg/day compound 1 to KM12L4a Tumor-Bearing Mice<br><br>
[0107J	Tumor compound 1 concentrations on Day 22 were 37- to 354-<br>
fold higher than those in plasma in the 100 and 200 mg/kg dose groups at each of the two sampling times (8 and 24 hours postdose). However, tumor concentrations at 24 hours were only 17 to 65% lower than those at 8 hours postdose in these two dose groups suggesting a somewhat slower elimination rate from tumors compared to that from other normal tissues (such as, brain, heart, liver, lung, and kidneys). Therefore, compound 1 appears to be extensively distributed to tumors relative to plasma but may exhibit preferential retention in tumor relative to plasma or normal tissues.<br>
[0108]	In summary, the efficacy and tolerability of compound 1 was<br>
dose related, with significant inhibitions after 4 to 7 days of treatment. Tumor regressions were observed at 300 and 200 mg/kg; these doses were tolerated daily for approximately 14 and 21 days, respectively. Weight loss was the<br>
48<br><br>
clinical sign associated with toxicity. Doses of 100 mg/kg were tolerated for 37 days with no adverse clinical signs, with tumor growth inhibition of 80% compared to control. 30 mg/kg inhibited growth by 60%. Compound 1 demonstrated dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics in tumor-bearing mice. Plasma compound 1 Cmax, AUC, and Cmln values associated with 35-60% tumor growth inhibition ranged from 163-742 ng/mL, 1420-5540 ng*hr/mL, and 2-135 ng/mL, respectively. Compound 1 was distributed widely to tissues, however did not appear to accumulate in tissues following multiple oral dosing. There was a trend towards preferential retention of compound 1 in tumors relative to other tissues following oral dosing.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0109]         This single agent study evaluated intermittent oral dosing of compound 1 in the PC3 human prostate tumor model.<br>
[0110]	Male SCID mice, aged 9-10 weeks, were implanted with 5<br>
million PC3 human prostate cells subcutaneously in the flank. Treatment began when tumors reached 150 mm3. This was designated as study day 1. Compound 1 was formulated as an aqueous solution and administered by oral gavage.<br>
[0111]	Five treatment groups were included in the study, (n =<br>
10/group): Vehicle (water) p.o., q.d.; and four groups of compound 1 doses of 100 mg/kg q.d., q.2.d., q.3.d., q.4.d.<br>
[0112]         As shown in Table 7 significant and similar tumor inhibition results were observed in all treatment groups. The study was suspended for the daily dosing group on day 11. The study was terminated on study day 25 for the remaining groups and mean tumor volume was measured and compared to vehicle. As a clinical indication of toxicity percentage weight loss was measured for each group.<br>

Example 6<br>
[0113]	To confirm the structures of the identified metabolites of<br>
compound 1, the metabolites were independently synthesized.<br>
[0114]	Compound 2, the N-oxide metabolite of compound 1, was<br>
50<br>
synthesized as shown in the scheme below. Compound 1 was heated in a mixture of ethanol, dimethylacetamide and hydrogen peroxide. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 2 was isolated by filtration and washed with ethanol. If necessary, the product could be further purified by column chromatography.<br><br><br>
Compound 3, the N-desmethyl metabolite of compound 1, was synthesized as shown in the scheme below. 5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline was treated with piperazine to yield 4 which was subsequently protected with a butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group to yield 5. Reduction of th&amp;nitro group followed by condensation with 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropionic acid ethyl ester gave 6. Condensation of 6 with 6-fluoroanthranilonitrile using potassium hexamethyldisilazide as the base yielded 7. Crude 7 was treated with aqueous HCI to yield the desired metabolite as a yellow/brown solid after purification.<br>

a temperature probe, a N2 gas inlet, and a mechanical stirrer. The reaction<br>
52<br><br>
vessel was purged with N2 for at least 15 minutes and then charged with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-one (484 g, 1.23 mol). A solution of D,L-Lactic acid (243.3 g, 1.72 mol of monomer-see the following paragraph), water (33 mL), and ethanol (1211 mL) was prepared and then charged to the reaction flask. Stirring was initiated at a medium rate, and the reaction was heated to an internal temperature of 68-72°C. The internal temperature of the reaction was maintained at 68-72°C for 15-45 minutes and then heating was discontinued. The resulting mixture was filtered through a 10-20 micron frit collecting the filtrate in a 12 L flask. The 12 L flask was equipped with an internal temperature probe, a reflux condenser, an additional funnel, a gas inlet an outlet, and an overhead stirrer. The filtrate was then stirred at a medium rate and heated to reflux (internal temperature of about 78°C). While maintaining a gentle reflux, ethanol (3,596 mL) was charged to the flask over a period of about 20 minutes. The reaction flask was then cooled to an internal temperature ranging from about 64-70°C within 15-25 minutes and this temperature was maintained for a period of about 30 minutes. The reactor was inspected for crystals. If no crystal were present, then crystals of the lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (484 mg, 0.1 mole %) were added to the flask, and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for 30 minutes before again inspecting the flask for crystals. Once crystals were present, stirring was reduced to a low rate and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for an additional 90 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to about 0°C over a period of about 2 hours, and the resulting mixture was filtered through a 25-50 micron fritted filter. The reactor was washed with ethanol (484 mL) and stirred until the internal temperature was about 0°C. The cold ethanol was used to wash the filter cake, and this procedure was repeated 2 more times. The collected solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a vacuum oven yielding 510.7 g (85.7%) of the crystalline yellow lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1 H-quinolin-2-one.<br>
53<br><br>
A rubber dam or inert conditions were typically used during the filtration process. While the dry solid did not appear to be very hygroscopic, the wet filter cake tends to pick up water and become sticky. Precautions were taken to avoid prolonged exposure of the wet filter cake to the atmosphere.<br>
[0116]	Commercial lactic acid generally contains about 8-12% w/w<br>
water, and contains dimers and trimers in addition to the monomeric lactic acid. The mole ratio of lactic acid dimer to monomer is generally about 1.0:4.7. Commercial grade lactic acid may be used in the process described in the preceding paragraph as the monolactate salt preferentially precipitates from the reaction mixture. Lactic acid monomer is purified according to the following procedure.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0117]	This study evaluated the antiangiogenic potential of compound 1<br>
in the FGF supplemented Matrigel model.<br>
[0118]	Female BDF1 mice, aged 11-12 weeks (Charles River,<br>
Wilmington, MA), were subcutaneously implanted with 0.5 ml_ Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) supplemented with 2^g FGF-2. The FGF-2 supplemented blood vessel formation (neovascularization or angiogenesis) was quantified by measuring hemoglobin levels in the Matrigel plugs following their removal from the animals.<br>
[0119]	Oral administration of test article began one day prior to Matrigel<br>
implantation and continued once daily for eight doses. Compound 1 was formulated as a solution in 10 mM H3PO4. Twelve treatment groups were included: vehicle (10 mM H3PO4) p.o., q.d.x 8 days (2 control groups; mice implanted with unsupplemented Matrigel (baseline hemoglobin level) or FGF-supplemented Matrigel (positive control); compound 1 dosed at 3,10, 30,100, 200, 300 mg/kg p.o., q.d. x 8 days. There were 8 mice per group, except for mice dosed at 200 and 300 mg/kg, which were 4 per group.<br>
54<br><br>
[0120]	Percent inhibition of hemoglobin levels in compound-treated<br>
mice compared to mice treated with vehicle indicates the antiangiogenic potency of the compound. Results are expressed as total hemoglobin (mg/dL) per Matrigel plug. The ED50 is defined as the dose that effectively inhibits angiogenesis by approximately 50%. Hemoglobin concentrations were determined in homogenized Matrigel plugs removed from mice and flash frozen, using absorbance spectroscopy with Drabkin's reagent (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis MO).<br>
[0121]	To evaluate plasma exposures of compound 1, blood was<br>
collected 2 and 24 hours after 8 consecutive doses (Day 8). In the 200 and 300 mg/kg dose groups, blood was collected only at the 2 hour timepoint. Plasma concentrations of 1 were determined by a non-validated LC/MS/MS assay with a calibration range of 1 to 8000 ng/mL and a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL (Charles River Laboratories, Worcester, MA).<br>
[0122]	On Day 8, hemoglobin levels in Matrigel plugs and plasma<br>
concentrations of compound 1 were measured. Animals were observed and body weights were measured throughout the study.<br>
[0123]	Compound 1 resulted in significant inhibition of hemoglobin<br>
concentration in Matrigel plugs at each dose evaluated compared to plugs from vehicle treated animals (Table 8). The calculated ED50 was 2.6 mg/kg. The 3 and 10 mg/kg doses resulted in 54% and 57% inhibition, respectively, whereas the 30,100,200 and 300 mg/kg doses reduced hemoglobin to the level of unsupplemented Matrigel, resulting in 70-92% inhibition vs. FGF-supplemented controls. The plasma concentrations of compound 1 at 2 hours post dose on day 8, showed a dose proportional increase with concentrations ranging from 44 ng/mL at 3 mg/kg to 3920 ng/mL at 300 mg/kg (Table 9). All doses were well tolerated and no weight loss was observed.<br>

#samples collected 2 hours and 24 hours after dosing<br>
[0124]	Plasma concentrations of 1 (2 hr postdose) increased<br>
proportionally with dose. A dose and plasma concentration dependent reduction in hemoglobin content of Matrigel plugs was observed. Plasma<br>
56<br><br>
concentrations (2 hr postdose, Day 8) of 44 ng/mL appear to be associated with antiangiogentc activity in this model<br>
(0126]	In summary, the hemoglobin inhibition of compound 1 was dose-<br>
dependent , with significant inhibition after 8 days of treatment. Statistically significant hemoglobin inhibition was observed with all doses of compound 1. All doses were well tolerated with no weight loss or adverse clinical signs observed. Compound 1 plasma concentrations (2 hr postdose) of 44 ng/mL were associated with antiangiogenic activity in this model.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0126]	The metabolite profile of compound 1 in monkey plasma from a<br>
5 mg/kg BID multiple oral dose study was determined in dose day 1 and 14 samples. One metabolite was identified and characterized by LC/UV and LD/MS/MS resulting from demethyiation (compound 3). Parent (P) compound 1 produced an M+H+ ion at m/z = 393,3 with a chromatographic retention time of 18.3 minutes. The demethyiated metabolite (P-CH3) was identified with an m/z = 379.3 (M+H+) and a chromatographic retention time of 18.1 min. The mass difference of 14 daltons between the metabofite and compound 1 is consistent with a demethyiated compound 1. The mass and chromatographic retention of the metabolite was identical to Independently synthesized compound 3. The metabolite corresponding to the piperazine N-oxide of compound 1 (N-oxtde compound 2) was not detected in plasma at this dose level. The components producing a UV signal at 17.7 and 18.5 minutes in the absorbance chromatogram at 356 nm were determined to be matrix components and not metabolites based on the UV spectral comparisons to compound 1 and due to their presence in blank plasma (time 0 dose day 1).<br>
[0127]         The estimated levels of the demethyiated metabolite are given in Table 1. The estimated levels of metabolites (in compound 1 equivalents) are based on UV absorbance peak height ratios of metabolite to that of compound 1 obtained in this analysis and extrapolated by factoring the absorbance ratio to the known levels of compound 1 determined In the same samples in a<br>
57<br><br>
previous quantitative analytical study. It was found that parent compound was in greater abundance than the metabolite at all pooled time points. The levels of compound 1 were found to be substantially lower in the day 14 samples in parallel with the N-desmethyl metabolite which was essentially undetectable. No other metabolites including conjugated Phase II type metabolites (glucuronide or sulphate) were detected in these plasma samples on day 1 or 14 of dose administration.<br>

Example 10<br>
[0128]	Studies with plasma and tumors collected from mice following<br>
treatment with compound 1 were performed to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic endpoints. Analysis of target modulation in KM12L4a tumors after compound 1 treatment indicated that phosphorylation of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, PDGFRp, and FGFR1 were inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. For example, HMVEC cells showed inhibition of VEGF mediated VEGFR2 phosphorylation with an IC50 of about 0.1 uM. In addition, treatment of endothelial cells with compound 1 inhibited MAPK and Akt phosphorylation mediated by VEGF.<br>
[0129]	Furthermore, a time- and dose- dependent inhibition of ERK<br>
(MAPK) activation, a downstream target of receptor tyrosine kinases, was observed with IC50s ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 uM in KM12L4A cells. (KM12L4A cells express PDGFRp and VEGFR1/2 on their surfaces.) KM12L4A cells were incubated 3 h with compound 1 in serum-free DMEM. After the harvest, lysates were separated by SDS-Page and probed with the phosphor-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 antibodies. For detection, ECL reagents (Amersham) were used. The inhibitory effects of compound 1 on receptor phosphorylation and ERK activation were maintained for 24 hours after treatment. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MV4-11 cells was inhibited by 1 at IC50S of 0.01 to 0.1 pM in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
[0130]	Significant activity was observed in vivo in the HCT116 human<br>
colon tumor model. In HCT116 tumors, compound 1 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK (MAPK) in a dose- and time-dependent manner and significant changes in histology analyses of the tumors was observed.<br>
[0131]	These PK/PD evaluations in preclinical models indicate that<br>
compound 1 showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of both the target receptors and the downstream signaling molecule, ERK (MAPK). These studies will aid in the identification of potential biomarkers to support the monitoring of biological activity of compound 1 in clinical trials.<br>

Example 11<br>
[0132]	The distribution of radioactivity in tissues after administration of<br>
a single oral (PO) dose (5 mg/kg) of 14C-labeled compound 1 (at 4-position of quinolinone ring) to male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats was determined by whole-body autoradiography (WBA). Blood and carcasses for WBA were collected at specified time points through 24 hours postdose. Carcasses were frozen in a hexane/dry ice bath, drained, blotted dry, and placed on dry ice or stored at approximately -70°C for at least 2 hours. The frozen carcasses were embedded in chilled carboxymethylcellulose, frozen into blocks along with embedded autoradiographic standards, and stored at -20°C until analysis. Appropriate sections of 40 urn thickness were collected on adhesive tape at 5 levels of interest in the sagital plane. All major tissues, organs and biological fluids were represented. Phosphorimaging screens were exposed to the sections and scanned and a standard curve created for interpolating tissue concentrations of 14C-1. Plasma was analyzed for concentration of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Illustrative results are presented in Table 11.<br>
[0133]	Following oral administration of 14C-1, radioactivity derived from<br>
14C-1 was widely distributed throughout all tissues by 1 hour postdose, and had reached Cmax in most tissues by 4 hours postdose. Overall distribution of radioactivity in the tissues of males and females was similar. 14C-1-derived radioactivity was cleared more slowly from tissues than from plasma. In males and females, the highest tissue concentrations of 14C-1, excluding the gastrointestinal tract through 24 hours were detected in the harderian gland, adrenal gland, renal medulla, intra-orbital lacrimal gland, and exorbital lacrimal gland. 14C-1-derived radioacitivity crossed the blood/brain barrier after oral dose administration.<br>
