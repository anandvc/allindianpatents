CATALYST PREPARATION METHODS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present disclosure relates to hydrogenolysis processes and<br>
hydrogenolysis catalyst preparation methods.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
By-product compounds have been identified during the production<br>
of fuel from organic material such as the production of biodiesel from<br>
plant material. Many of these by-products are of low commercial value<br>
but with modification can be of high commercial value. One such<br>
compound is glycerol, which is a by-product from the biodiesel<br>
manufacturing process. Hydrogenolysis of glycerol to yield relatively<br>
more commercially valuable compounds such as propylene glycol can be<br>
performed. The conversion of multihydric alcohol compounds such as<br>
glycerol to polyols such as propylene glycol can be beneficial for at least<br>
the reason that substantial waste by-products of biodiesel manufacturing<br>
process can be eliminated. The present disclosure provides methods for<br>
increasing the efficiency of these types of hydrogenolysis processes and<br>
in particular embodiments, discloses hydrogenolysis catalyst preparation<br>
methods.<br>

include Re and one or both of Co and Pd. The catalyst can be exposed<br>
to a reducing agent in the absence of polyhydric alcohol compound while<br>
maintaining a temperature of the catalyst above 290oC. The process can<br>
also include contacting the catalyst with the polyhydric alcohol<br>
compound.<br>
Hydrogenolysis processes can also include providing a passivated<br>
catalyst to within a reactor and exposing the catalyst to a reducing<br>
atmosphere while maintaining the catalyst at a temperature less than<br>
210°C. The process may continue by contacting the catalyst with the<br>
polyhydric alcohol compound.<br>
Hydrogenolysis catalyst preparation methods are provided that can<br>
include exposing the catalyst to a first reducing atmosphere while<br>
maintaining the catalyst at a first temperature to reduce at least a portion<br>

portion of the catalyst in the presence of a second reducing atmosphere<br>
while maintaining the portion of the catalyst at a second temperature<br>
less than the first temperature.<br>
Preparation methods can also include providing a hydrogenolysis<br>
catalyst and maintaining the catalyst at a temperature of at least about<br>
280°C in the presence of a continuous supply of inert atmosphere.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
Hydrogenolysis processes and hydrogenolysis catalyst preparation<br>
methods are described with reference to Figs. 1-11. Referring first to<br>
Fig. 1, a chemical production process system 10 is shown that includes<br>
a reservoir 12 housing catalyst 14. Reservoir 12 is in fluid<br>
communication with conduit 16 and conduit 20.<br>
According to example embodiments, reservoir 12 can be<br>
configured with additional conduits (not shown), for example to provide a<br>
reactant mixture thereto. According to example implementations,<br>
reservoir 12 can be a chamber that is configured to house catalyst as<br>
well as have the temperature and pressure of the interior of the chamber<br>
be maintained throughout a range of temperatures and pressures.<br>
Reservoir 12 can also be configured as a reactor and as such, the<br>
reactor can be any reactor suitable for use under desired conditions of<br>
temperature, pressure, solvent, and/or contact time. Examples of<br>
suitable chambers include but are not limited to: trickle bed, bubble<br>
column reactors, and continuous stirred tanks, for example. Reservoir<br>
12 can be used in-line in chemical processes and can be effectively<br>
coupled with various additional components of chemical production<br>
processes such as cation exchange columns, distillation columns, etc.,<br>
and can be used in various embodiments of the present disclosure. The<br>
flow of materials such as reactants and/or reducing atmospheres through<br>
reservoir 12 can be manipulated with flow controllers and/or pressure<br>
differentiation apparatuses, for example.<br>
Catalyst 14 can be multi-metallic catalysts such as bi or tri metallic<br>
catalysts. According to example embodiments, catalyst 14 can comprise<br>
one or both of Ni and Re. Via conduit 16, catalyst 14 can be exposed to<br>
a reducing agent. Example reducing agents include H2. Catalyst 14 can<br>
be exposed to this reducing agent in the absence of polyhydric alcohol<br>
reactants such as polyhydric alcohol compounds. According to example<br>
implementations, the catalyst can be exposed to this reducing agent<br>
while maintaining a temperature of the catalyst within reservoir 12 below<br>
about 350°C. Where the catalyst comprises Ni and/or Re, the<br>
temperature of the catalyst can be maintained below 290°C during the<br>
exposing. According to example implementations, the catalyst can<br>
comprise at least about 5% (wt./wt.) Ni.<br>
The remainder of the catalyst can be provided in a solid form on a<br>
support material that is selected to resist degradation under intended<br>
reaction conditions, for example. Such support materials are known in<br>
the art and may include high surface area oxide supports. Carbon,<br>
zirconium and titanium (especially in the rutile form) may be preferred<br>
because of their stability in hydrothermal conditions (aqueous solutions<br>
at above 100°C and one atmosphere pressure). Supports can also be<br>
formed of mixed or layered materials. For example, in some<br>
embodiments, the support can be carbon with a surface layer of zirconia<br>
or zirconium mixed with catalyst metals. Of this support material,<br>
according to example implementations, 0.7% (wt./wt.) Re may be a part<br>
thereof. According to example implementations, the catalyst can include<br>
from between about 0.7% (wt./wt.) to about 2.5% (wt./wt.) Re.<br>
According to example embodiments, catalyst preparation can<br>
include exposing catalyst 14 to a reducing atmosphere while maintaining<br>
the catalyst at a temperature of from between 265°C and 320°C. The<br>
catalyst may then be passivated via exposure to the atmosphere, such<br>
exposure taking place, for example, during transfer of catalyst from<br>
reduction apparatus to reactor apparatus. Catalyst 14 can then be<br>
depassivated in the presence of a reducing agent while maintaining the<br>
catalyst at a temperature of less than 320°C. According to example<br>
implementatons, where the catalyst comprises one or both of Ni and Re,<br>
during the exposing of the catalyst to a reducing atmosphere, the<br>
catalyst can be maintained at a temperature of from about 290°C to<br>
about 320°C. The depassivating of the catalyst can include elevating the<br>
catalyst temperature from a first temperature to a temperature of less<br>
than 320°C. According to example implementations the catalyst can be<br>
depassivated by exposing the catalyst to a reducing atmosphere while<br>
maintaining the catalyst at a temperature below that which the catalyst<br>
was originally reduced at. Elevation can take place at a rate less than<br>
about 2°C per minute and/or at a rate of less than about 1.5oC per<br>
minute. The reducing atmosphere or agent provided during this<br>
elevating can include one or both of H2 and/or N2. According to example<br>
implementations, the reducing agent can be at least about 5% (v/v) H2,<br>
or from about 15 % to about 50 % H2, or from about 15% to about 50%<br>
H2.<br>
According to other embodiments, the catalyst can comprise Re and<br>
one or both of Co and Pd. As an example, this catalyst can be reduced<br>
by exposing the catalyst to a reducing atmosphere while maintaining a<br>
temperature of the catalyst above 290°C or between about 290°C and<br>
about 350°C or between about 290°C and about 320°C. The<br>
temperature of the catalyst can be maintained for less than about 12<br>
hours or at least 3 hours or from about 3 hours to about 12 hours.<br>
In this catalyst system, the depassivating can include elevating the<br>
catalyst temperature from a first temperature to a temperature of less<br>
than 210°C. The elevating of this catalyst temperature can include<br>
increasing the temperature at a rate of less than 1.5°C per minute to a<br>
temperature less than 210°C. In accordance with one implementation,<br>
the catalyst can be reduced at a temperature of at least about 290°C and<br>
depassivated at a temperature of less than about 210°C.<br>
According to example implementations, the exposing of the<br>
catalyst to a reducing agent can include elevating the temperature from<br>
a first temperature, such as ambient temperature, to at least about<br>
210°C at a rate of less than about 1.5°C per minute. According to other<br>
implementations, the exposing can include elevating the temperature of<br>
the catalyst from a first temperature of at least about 290°C at a rate of<br>
less than about 1.5°C per minute. The catalyst can be maintained at<br>
temperatures from about 265°C to about 290°C for hours at a time.<br>
According to other example implementations, a catalyst can<br>
comprise one or more of Co, Pd, and Re. Within reservoir 12, this<br>
catalyst can be maintained from between about 260°C and about 350°C<br>
while exposing the catalyst to the reducing agent. The temperature of<br>
the catalyst can be also be maintained between about 290°C and about<br>
350°C. The reducing agent can include both N and H, and the reducing<br>
agent can comprise at least about 4% (v/v) H2.<br>
Catalyst 14 can be a previously activated catalyst that has<br>
subsequently become passivated, and this passivated catalyst can be<br>
provided to within reservoir 12 acting as a reactor, for example.<br>
According to example implementations, the catalyst can be exposed to a<br>
reducing agent while maintaining the catalyst at a temperature of less<br>
than about 290°C.<br>
In accordance with another example embodiment, hydrogenolysis<br>
catalyst can be provided and the catalyst can be maintained at a<br>
temperature of at least about 280°C in the presence of a continuous<br>
supply of inert atmosphere such as N2. The catalyst can comprise Re<br>
and one or more of Ni, Co, and Pd. The temperature can maintained for<br>
at least about 3 hrs at, for example, 350°C. The inert atmosphere may<br>
be continuously supplied at a rate of about 50 ml/hr.<br>
Catalyst of the present processes and preparation can be made by<br>
incipient wetness impregnation techniques. A porous support may be<br>
purchased or prepared by known methods. A catalytic metal precursor<br>
can be prepared or obtained. The precursor may be prepared, for<br>
example, by dissolving a metal compound in water or acid or purchasing<br>
a precursor in solution. The precursor may be in the form of a cation or<br>
an anion. A typical precursor for nickel may be nickel nitrate dissolved in<br>
water. A typical precursor for ruthenium may be ruthenium chloride. A<br>
typical precursor for rhenium may be perrhenic acid. Each of the<br>
precursor materials may be in liquid or solid form; these particles may<br>
also contain other components such as halides, cations, anions etc. In<br>
some preferred embodiments, organic solvents are avoided and the<br>
precursor impregnation solution is prepared only in water. Conditions for<br>
preparing precursor solution will depend on the type of metal and<br>
available ligands. In the case of a particulate support, such as activated<br>
carbon powders, the support and precursor composition can be mixed in<br>
a suspension. The porous support is preferably not coated by a vapor-<br>
deposited layer, more preferably the method of making the catalyst may<br>
not have a vapor deposition step. A catalyst metal can be deposited<br>
subsequent to, or simultaneous with, the deposition of a metal oxide.<br>
Catalyst metal components can be impregnated into the support in a<br>
single-step, or by multi-step impregnation processes. In an example<br>
method, the precursor for the catalyst component can be prepared in a<br>
single solution that is equivalent in volume to the measured amount of<br>
solvent that the porous support will uptake to fill all of the pore volume.<br>
This solution can be added to the dry support such that it is absorbed by<br>
the support and fills the available pore volume. The support can then be<br>
vacuum dried in order to remove the solvent and leave the catalytic<br>
metal precursor to coat the surface of the support. Subsequent<br>
reduction can reduce the catalytic material to its metallic state or another<br>
oxidation state and may disassociate the metal from its anion or cation<br>
used to make the metal soluble. In most cases, the catalyst can be<br>
reduced prior to use. After subsequent reduction, the catalyst can be<br>
exposed to oxygen to be passivated. This passivation is quite common<br>
in the art as catalyst is moved between chambers and is exposed to<br>
oxygen to thereby passivate the catalyst.<br>
Upon activation and/or depassivation, the catalyst can then be<br>
exposed to a polyhydric alcohol compound in the presence of a reducing<br>
agent to form a polyol. As an example, the polyhydric alcohol compound<br>
can have n hydroxyl groups and the polyol can have n-1 hydroxyl<br>
groups. The polyhydric alcohol compound can include n hydroxyl groups,<br>
with n being ranging from 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups. The polyhydric alcohol<br>
compound can be an oxygen containing organic compound such as a C-<br>
3 triol. Example polyhydric alchohol compounds include but are not<br>
limited to glycerol. Additional example polyhydric alcohol compounds<br>
utilized can be sorbitol.<br>
According to example embodiments, reservoir 12 can be<br>
configured as a reactor and conduit 16 can be configured to provide a<br>
polyhydric alcohol compound to catalyst 14 within reservoir 12. The<br>
polyhydric alcohol compound can be provided to this catalyst in order to<br>
hydrogenolyze the polyhydric alcohol compound to form a polyol having<br>
one less hydroxyl group. As an example, glycerol can be the polyhydric<br>
alcohol compound provided to reservoir 12 having catalyst 14 therein<br>
and this polyhydric alcohol compound can contact the catalyst and form<br>
propylene glycol, for example. Preparing catalysts as described herein<br>
can provide increased efficiency with respect to this hydrogenolysis<br>
reaction.<br>
This polyhydric alcohol compound can be an aqueous solution<br>
containing as much as 90% water, for example. According to other<br>
example implementations, the reactant stream 16 can contain as much<br>
as 55% water and/or about 45% polyhydric alcohol compound. This<br>
reactant stream may not contain a basic compound according to example<br>
implementations.<br>
The pH of reactant stream 16 can be less than 7.0, for example.<br>
Reactant stream 16 can constitute the majority of the liquid phase within<br>
reactor 12. Reactant stream 16 can also include a reducing agent, for<br>
example, H2. Reactant stream 16 can be in fluid communication with<br>
reactor 12, and thereby reactant mixture 16 can be exposed to catalyst<br>
14 within reactor 12. According to example implementations, a mole<br>
percent of the reducing agent to the polyhydric compound within reactant<br>
stream 16 can be at least about 35% polyhydric compound.<br>
Example 1: Ni/Re Catalyst Preparation.<br>
Two catalysts samples can be prepared using 5%Ni 0.7%Re<br>
impregnated on Norit ROX 0.8 carbon extrudate. The samples can be<br>
reduced at the following temperatures: 265°C (catalyst M), 290CC<br>
(catalyst D), 320°C (catalyst E) under a flow of H2 and passivated. Each<br>
catalyst can be tested individually by loading into a down-flow trickle bed<br>
reactor. Catalysts D and E can be activated by raising the temperature of<br>
the reactor 2°C/min to 320°C while flowing a 4% (v/v) H2 in N2 mixture at<br>
250 sccm and upon reaching temperature increasing the H2<br>
concentration to 100% and holding 2 h. The reactor temperature can be<br>
lowered to 190°C, the gas flow rate can be increased to 450 sccm and<br>
the pressure raised to 1200 psig. Glycerol feed (~40 wt% glycerol, 2.1<br>
wt% NaOH) can be fed to the reactor at a rate of 1.7 LHSV (40 mL/min).<br>
The performance of the two catalysts is shown in Fig. 2. The<br>
sample reduced at the lower temperature demonstrated higher activity,<br>
as shown by glycerol conversion, than the sample reduced at the higher<br>
temperature.<br>
Example 2. Ni/Re Catalyst under batch conditions.<br>
Two catalysts samples can be prepared using 5%Ni 0.7%Re<br>
impregnated on Norit ROX 0.8 carbon extrudate. The samples can be<br>
reduced at the following temperatures: 265°C (catalyst M) and 290°C<br>
(catalyst G), under a flow of H2 and passivated. Each catalyst can be<br>
tested individually by loading into a down-flow trickle bed reactor.<br>
Catalysts G and M can be activated by raising the temperature of the<br>
reactor 1.5°C/min to a desired temperature while flowing H2 at 250 sccm<br>
and holding 2 h. The reactor temperature can be lowered to 190°C, the<br>
gas flow rate can be increased to 450 sccm and the pressure raised to<br>
1200 psig. Glycerol feed (~40 wt% glycerol, 2.1 wt% NaOH) can be fed<br>
to the reactor at a rate of 1.7 LHSV (40 mL/min). Two depassivation<br>
temperatures can be tested for G, 290 and 210°C. Catalyst M can be<br>
depassivated at 210°C. Results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.<br>
Example 3. Co/Pd/Re Catalyst.<br>
Three catalysts samples can be prepared at a metal loading of<br>
2.5%Co, 0.4% Pd and 2.4% Re on Norit ROX 0.8 extrudate. The<br>
catalysts can be reduced at the following temperatures: 260°C (catalyst<br>
J), 290°C (catalyst K) and 320°C (catalyst L) for 3 h and passivated.<br>
Each catalyst can be tested individually by loading into a down-flow<br>
trickle bed reactor. The catalysts can be activated by raising the<br>
temperature of the reactor 1.5°C/min to 210°C while flowing H2 at 250<br>
sccm and holding 2 h. The reactor temperature can be lowered to<br>
190°C, the gas flow rate can be increased to 450 sccm and the pressure<br>
raised to 1200 psig. Glycerol feed (-40 wt% glycerol, 2.1 wt% NaOH)<br>
can be fed to the reactor at a rate of 1.7 LHSV (40 mL/min). Data from<br>
the three runs is shown in Table 3 below and depicted graphically in Fig.<br>
3.<br>
In accordance with the processes described herein two catalysts<br>
can be prepared; catalysts H (2.20% Co, 0.47% Pd, 2.39% Re on<br>
ROX) and I (2.83% Co, 0.45% Pd, 2.36% Re on ROX) as represented<br>
5 in Table 4 below. Table 4 and Fig. 4 demonstrate the data acquired<br>
utilizing these catalysts prepared according to indicated methods.<br>
5 Regarding Table 5 below, twelve hydrogenolysis catalysts<br>
(2.5%Co, 2.4%Re, 0.45%Pd on Norit ROX 0.8) can be reduced and<br>
subsequent to catalyst preparation can be performed in a trickle bed<br>
reactor experiments in accordance with the parameters detailed<br>
below.<br>
Each catalyst can first be reduced and then passivated. As part<br>
of the example, a dried 30 cc sample of catalyst containing 2.5%Co,<br>
0.45% Pd and 2.4% Re on Norit ROX 0.8 extrudate can be loaded into<br>
a down-flow trickle bed reactor. A 250 sccm gas flow of H2 can be<br>
initiated and the catalyst depassivated by raising the temperature of<br>
the reactor 1.5 °C/min to 210 °C, for example. The temperature can<br>
be maintained for 12 h and then cooled over 1 h to 190 °C. The gas<br>
flow rate can then be increased to 450 sccm and the pressure<br>
increased to 1200 psig.<br>
Glycerol feedstock (~40 wt% glycerol, 1.0 wt% NaOH) can be<br>
fed to the reactor at a rate of 1.2 LHSV (35 mL/h). In some of the<br>
cases, water can be added during the depassivation to simulate water<br>
roll-up. Typically 50 ml/h and 35 ml/h samples can be taken.<br>
The concentration of the reduction gas at 5, 15, and 50 mol %<br>
hydrogen in inert such as N2 can be varied. In each case an aliquot of<br>
catalyst can be reduced 320°C for 3 hours. Comparing the performance<br>
from the series of tests in Figure 5, the baseline concentration of 15 mol<br>
% sccms to yield the highest activity for the conditions tested. The<br>
results of runs F122 and F126 can indicate that using a 5 mol % or 50<br>
mol % hydrogen concentration during reduction can impact catalyst<br>
activity. At the liquid hourly space velocity of 50 ml/hr the performance<br>
difference between the baseline 15% and the 50% hydrogen reduction<br>
can be nearly 12 percentage points. While 15 mol% hydrogen appears<br>
to yield the most active catalyst during reduction, it would not preclude<br>
the use of a hydrogen gradient during reduction to further speed the<br>
process. Effects of Hydrogen Concentration during Reduction on<br>
Performance are depicted graphically in Fig. 5.<br>
The temperature profiles are shown in Figure 6. The 5mol%<br>
hydrogen reduction appears to lag behind when the reaction is<br>
performed at 35 ml/hr glycerol feed, while the 50mol% hydrogen<br>
reduction tests appear slightly ahead of the 15mol% run, but nearly<br>
equivalent. At a 50 ml/hr feed rate, the bed profile for the 15mol%<br>
appears to peak higher for longer than the 50mol% test, which appears<br>
similar to the 5mol% test. Reduction Hydrogen Concentration Effect on<br>
Reaction Bed Temperature Profile is shown graphically in Fig. 6.<br>
Temperature and duration of the catalyst preparation hold time can<br>
be varied on catalysts that all were reduced under 15 mol% hydrogen in<br>
inert. Each of these tests can be performed at baseline conditions at 35<br>
ml/hr glycerol feedstock, while some can also performed at 50 ml/hr.<br>
Results from the test can be shown in Figure 7. Again the primary<br>
differences between catalyst performances were expressed in the<br>
conversion of glycerol only. Selectivity to propylene glycol appeared<br>
mostly insensitive to the various reduction condition tests. Effects of<br>
Reduction Temperature and Duration on Performance are shown<br>
graphically in Fig. 7.<br>
Bed temperature profiles for these tests are shown in Figure 8.<br>
These appear to trend well against the glycerol conversion data and<br>
analysis. The variations in the apparent location of the exotherm are<br>
due to differences in the location of the catalyst bed in the reactor, rather<br>
than changes in activity. Effects of Reduction Temperature and Duration<br>
on Bed Temperature Profile are shown graphically in Fig. 8.<br>
Preparations can also be prepared at 320°C, for 3h, with 15 mol%<br>
hydrogen for the preparation of the 2.5% Co, 0.45% Pd and 2.4% Re<br>
catalyst. Effect of Nitrogen Calcination on Performance is shown<br>
graphically in Fig. 9. Effect of Water Roll-Up (simulated) During<br>
Reduction on Performance is shown graphically in Fig. 10.<br>
A catalyst can be subjected to a 121°C (250oF) simulated exotherm<br>
during the passivation process. The passivation exotherm can be the<br>
only difference between the baseline catalyst preparation and handling.<br>
Effect of Passivation Exotherm (simulated) on Performance is shown<br>
graphically in Fig. 11.<br>
