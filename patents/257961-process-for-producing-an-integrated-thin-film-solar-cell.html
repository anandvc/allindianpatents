'INTEGRATED THIN FILM SOLAR GELL AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING" THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated thin-film solar cell, in which constitutional thin films are divided into respective thin-film solar unit cells and their thin-film solar unit cells are connected in series by patterning steps in order to obtain a prescribed voltage, and to a process for producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the production of a solar cell module, it is necessary that a prescribed number of solar cells, as basic units, are connected in series to obtain a prescribed voltage, and in the case of a crystalline silicon solar cell, a stringing step is required for connecting alternately the front surfaces and the back surfaces of the solar cells with copper ribbons with solder. In a thin-film solar cell, such as a CIS type one, on the other hand, such a production process is employed that plural solar cells are divided by patterning on a substrate and are connected in series to form an integrated structure.<br>
As a p--type light absorbing layer of a CIS thin-film solar cell, a Cu- 111-VI2 chal copyrite semiconductor, such as copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide ICIGS), copper indium gallium diselenide sulfide (CIGS3), CIGS having a thin film layer of CIGSS as a surface layer, and the like have been known, and an integrated thin-film solar cell having thep-type light absorbing layer and a pn-hetero junction is divided into plural unit cells in a strip shape to form grooves or gaps of several tens to several hundreds micrometers as an interconnecting part. In the production step for connecting the unit cells in series, a patterning step is employed (as described, for example, in Non-patent Document. 1 and Patent Document 1) .<br>
Non-patent Document 1 : C. Fredric, et al., The 23th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (1993) , pp. 437 to 440<br>
Patent Document 1:  JP-A-2002-319686<br>
The production process of the integrated thin-film solar cell comprises, for example, three patterning steps PI, P2 and P3 . In the patterning P1, ametal back electrode layer of molybdenum or the like is formed on an insulating substrate by a sputtering method, and then the metal back electrode layer is divided into a strip shape by using<br>
an infrared (l,064nm) beam, such as neodymium YAG laser . A p-type light absorbing layer formed of a Cu-III-VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductor is formed thereon by a s imul taneous vapor de posit ion method or a selenide method, and then a buffer layer formed of a transparent compound semiconductor thin film having a high resistance is formed by chemically growing from a solution to form a semiconductor thin film having an accumulated structure. In the patterning P2, the semiconductor thin film, i.e., the buffer layer and the p-type light absorbing layer, is divided into a strip shape by mechanically removing a part thereof by a mechanical scribing method.  In the patterning P2, the film is divided into the same number as the number of the unit cells divided in the patterning P1 with a positional offset.  The patterning P3 is attained in such a manner that a transparent electroconductive film (window layer) formed of a metal oxide semiconductor thin film is formed on the buffer layer, and then the transparent electroconductive film (window layer), the buffer layer and the p-type light absorbing layer are partially removed mechanically by a mechanical scribing method with an offset with respect to the position in the patterning P2, so as to divide them into a strip shape. As a result, solar cells each having an accumulated structure having the metal back electrode layer having<br>
accumulated thereon in this order the p-type light absorbing layer, the buffer layer and the transparent electroconductive film (window layer) are divided into cell units, and the transparent electroconductive film (window layer) of the solar cell is connected in series to the metal back electrode layer of the adjacent solar cell .<br>
In the patterning step of dividing a part of a thin film by a mechanical scribing method employed in the conventional production process of an integrated thin-film solar cell, a metallic blade, a cutter knife, a metal stylus or needle, or the like is used as a measure for dividing the thin film.  For example, in the case where a metal stylus capable of dividing precisely is used, it is necessary in the patterning step that the thin films of from the buffer layer to the light absorbing layer, or from the transparent electroconductive film (window layer) to the light absorbing layer are respectively divided, and such a problem arises thereon that the metal stylus penetrates through the metal back electrode layer as an underlayer of the light absorbing layer to expose the glass surface of the substrate.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The basic structure of the integrated thin film solar cell of the invention is, as shown in Fig. 2, an<br>
integrated thin-film solar cell 1 having an accumulated layer structure containing a substrate 2 and constitutional thin films containing a metal back electrode layer 3 on the substrate 2, an multi-element compound semiconductor thin film 5 having a p-type conductivity and being provided as a light absorbing layer on the metal back electrode layer 3, a metal oxide semiconductor thin film 7 having an opposite type conductivity against the multi-element compound semiconductor thin film 5, having a wider bandgap, being transparent, having electroconductivity, and being provided as a window layer on the multi-element compound semiconductor thin film 5, and a buffer layer 6 containing a mixed crystal compound semiconductor thin film having a high resistance at an interface between the light absorbing layer 5 and the window layer 7.  An ultrathin film layer 4 is formed secondarily at a boundary between the metal back electrode layer 3 and the light absorbing layer 5 upon forming the light absorbing layer 5 on the metal back electrode layer 2.  In the invention, the ultrathin film layer 4 is utilized as a solid lubricant in a patterning step for dividing into the thin-film solar unit cells and connecting a plurality of the thin film solar unit cells.  In the case where the metal back electrode layer is molybdenum, the ultrathin film layer<br>
4 is molybdenum selenide or molybdenum sulfide. In the case of the ultrathin film layer 4 is molybdenum selenide, the thickness thereof is from 100 to 200 nm (from 0.1 to 0.2 um) as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The light absorbing layer 5 is formed of a Cu-III-VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductor, such as copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gall ium dise lenide (GIGS), copper indium gallium diselenide sulfide (CIGSS), GIGS having a thin film layer of CIGSS as a surface layer, and the like .<br>
The process for producing an integrated thin-film solar cell having an accumulated structure of the invention will be described.<br>
In the process for producing an integrated thin- fi 1m solar cell of the invention, as shown in Fig. 1, in a series of a production process of a thin- film solar cell having an accumulated structure containing plural thin film solar cells in a prescribed number connected in series on a substrate, three patterning steps (pattern forming steps) P1, P2 and P3 for dividing the thin-film solar cells and connecting them are incorporated, whereby the production process of a solar cell having a high conversion efficiency can be attained.<br>
In the patterning P1 as a first pattern forming step, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) , a metal back electrode layer<br>
3 formed of a metal, such as molybdenum, is formed on an insulating substrate 2 formed of glass or the like by a sputtering method, and then the metal back electrode layer is divided into a strip shape by using a laser beam. In the case where the metal back electrode layer is formed of a metal, such as Mo, the laser method is suitable for the patterning P1.<br>
In the patterning P2 as a second pattern forming step, as shown in Fig. l(b), after a p-type 1 ight absorbing layer 5 formed of a Cu-III-VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductor is formed on the metal back electrode layer 3 having been subjected to the patterning P1 by a simultaneous vapor deposition method or a selenide method (i.e., before forming a buffer layer), or after the p-type light absorbing layer 5 is formed, and a buffer layer 6 formed of a transparent compound semiconductor thin film having a high resistance is formed to provide a semiconductor thin film having an accumulated structure (i.e., after forming a buffer layer) , the p-type light absorbing layer 5, or the buffer layer 6 and the p-type light absorbing layer 5 are divided into a strip shape by mechanically removing a part thereof by a mechanical scribing method. In the patterning P2, as shown in Fig. 3, the film is patterned into the same number as the number of the unit<br>
cells divided in the patterning P1 with a positional offset.<br>
As compared to the case (A) where the pattering P2 is conducted after forming the light absorbing layer 5 (i.e., before forming the buffer layer) and the case (B) where it is conducted after forming the light absorbing layer 5 and the buffer layer 6 {i.e., after forming the buffer layer), there is no difference in conversion efficiency of the thin-film solar cell between the case where it is conducted before forming the buffer layer and the case where it is conducted after forming the buffer layer as shown in Fig. 5, and therefore, the patterning P2 may be conducted either before forming the buffer layer or after forming the buf fer 1 ayer . As a result, the degree of freedom in the patterning P2 is increased to enable formation of a window layer without a drying step after forming the buffer layer, whereby reduction in cost and simplification of operation can be attained.<br>
The patterning P3 is attained in such a manner that, as shown in Fig. l(c), a transparent electroconductive film formed of a metal oxide semiconductor thin film provided as a window layer 6 is formed on the buffer layer 6, and then the window layer 6, the buffer layer 6 and the p-type light absorbing layer 5 are partially removed mechanically by a mechanical scribing method using a metal<br>
stylus or the like with an offset with respect to the position in the patterning P1 or the patterning P2, so as to divide them into a strip shape. As a result, solar cells each having an accumulated structure having the metal back electrode layer 3 having accumulated thereon in this order the p-type light absorbing layer 5, the buffer layer 6 and the window layer 7 are divided into cell units, and the window layer 7 of the solar cell is connected in series to the metal back electrode layer<br>
3	of the adjacent solar cell.<br>
Upon reacting a chalcogen element (such as selenium and sulfur) with the metal back electrode layer 3 in the formation process of the light absorbing layer 5 formed of a multi-element semiconductor thin film, an ultrathin film layer 4 having a function of a solid lubricant is secondarily formed on the surface of the metal back electrode layer 3.  In the case where the metal back electrode layer is molybdenum, the ultrathin film layer<br>
4	is molybdenum selenide or molybdenum sulfide.  In the<br>
invention, the ultrathin film layer 4 formed secondarily<br>
is positively used as a solid lubricant in the patterning<br>
P2 and P3 using a mechanical scribing method with a metal<br>
stylus to remove the layers up to the light absorbing<br>
layer 5 by mechanically scribing them by sliding the tip<br>
end of the metal stylus, whereby such a problem can be<br>
prevented from occurring that the metal stylus penetrates through the metal back electrode layer 3 to expose the glass surface as the substrate.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Upon forming a pattern P2, the first groove formed in the patterning P1 is sought, and with the position thereof as a reference, the formation starting position of the first groove of the pattering P2 is determined by an offset operation. Upon forming a pattern P3, the first groove formed in the patterning PI or the patterning P2 is sought, andwith the position thereof as a reference, the formation starting position of the first groove of the pattering P3 is determined with a suitable offset.<br>
Upon forming the pattern P2, the first groove formed in the patterning PI is sought by using a CCD camera, and the reference line, which is the first groove formed in the patterning P1, and a groove formed in the patterning step of the patterning P2 are displayed on a monitor screen, and the linearity in the patterning P2 is evaluated by comparing the reference line and the groove .  Upon forming the pattern P3, the first groove formed in the patterning P1 or the patterning P2 is sought by using a CCD camera, and the reference line, which is the first groove formed in the patterning PI or the patterning P2, and a groove<br>
formed in the patterning step of the patterning P3 are displayed on a monitor screen, and the linearity in the patterning P3 is evaluated by comparing the reference line and the groove. Furthermore, a scale is displayed on the monitor screen1 and the linearity and the pattern width of the patterning P2 and the patterning P3 are measured based on the scale for evaluating them.<br>
The application is based on the Japanese Patent Application filed on December 25, 2003 (Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-428811), contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

a third patterning step of patterning (forming a pattern) by removing a part of the light absorbing layer, the buffer layer and the window layer in a thin line form with a prescribed offset with respect to the pattern formed in the first patterning step or the second patterning step as a reference position,<br>
wherein the second patterning step and the third patterning step are conducted by a mechanical scribing method of removing a part of a target accumulated thin film layer by mechanically scribing with a metal stylus having a pointed tip end, in which the tip end of the metal stylus is slid to remove the layers up to the light absorbing layer by mechanically scribing, using an ultrathin film layer formed secondarily on a surface of the metal back electrode layer upon forming the light absorbing layer as a solid lubricant, and<br>
wherein the first patterning step, the second patterning step and the third patterning step are conducted in this order, so as to remove mechanically the constitutional thin film layers of the target thin-film solar cell and to form grooves or gaps for dividing the thin-film solar cell into unit cells in a strip shape, whereby an integrated thin-film solar cell having a structure containing a prescribed number of the divided unit cells being connected in series is obtained.<br>
(Amended) The process for producing an<br>
integrated thin-film solar cell according to claim 3,<br>
wherein the metal back electrode layer is molybdenum,<br>
and the first patterning step is conducted by a laser<br>
method.<br>
(Amended) The process for producing an<br>
integrated thin-film solar cell according to claim 3,<br>
wherein the metal back electrode layer is molybdenum,<br>
and the ultrathin film layer formed secondarily on the<br>
surface of the metal back electrode layer is molybdenum<br>
selenide or molybdenum sulfide.<br>
6.	The process for producing an integrated<br>
thin-film solar cell according to claim 3, wherein thegrooves or gaps formed in the second patterning step and the third patterning step have a width of from 30 to 50 Urn and a length of 1 m or more, have good linearity, and are formed plurally with close positional relationship.<br>
