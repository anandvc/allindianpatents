wherein TBS represents t-butyldimethylsilyl; and Ph represents phenyl.<br>
[0003]	For example, J. Med. Chem., 30, 871 (1987) describes<br>
the synthesis of 2-aryl-1β-methyl carbapenem from the compound of formula (I) (see scheme 1 below). This document reports that the resultant compound has higher antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Escherichia coll and the like than imlpenem (IPM) and has higher stability against renal DHP-1 than IPM.<br>
[0004]	Scheme 1:<br><br>

wherein TBS and Ph are as defined above; PγSSPγ represents 2,2'-dipyridyldisulfide; Ar represents aryl; TBAF represents tetrabutylammonium fluoride; and Ac represents acetyl. The triangular symbol means that heating (for example, 80 to 150°C) is carried out.<br>
[0005]	J. Antibiotics, 41, 780 (1988) describes the synthesis<br>
of 2-ureido-ß-methyl carbapenem from the compound of formula (I) (see scheme 2 below). This document reports that the resultant compound has higher antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and the like than IPM and has higher stability against renal DHP-1 than IPM.<br>

wherein TBS, Ph, and PySSPy are as defined above; DMAP represents 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine; IDA represents lithium diisopropylamide; R represents a hydrogen atom, optionally substituted alkyl, phenyl or the like; Me represents methyl; and Alloc represents allyloxycarbonyl. The triangular symbol means that heating (for example, 80 to 150°C) is carried out.<br>
[0007]	WO 96/28455 by the present inventors describes the<br>
synthesis of 2-imidazo[5,l-b]thiazoliummethyl-lp-methyl carbapenem from the compound of formula (I) (see scheme 3 below). This document reports that the resultant compound has higher antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, pneumococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the like than IPM and has higher stability against renal DHP-1 than IPM.<br>

[0011]	The structures and synthetic processes for compounds<br>

the art.	However, as described, for example, in J. Med.<br>
Chem., 30, 871 (1987) (particularly page 876, right column), regarding compounds of formula (I) (corresponding to compound 16 in the above document), any crystal form was not produced although "light brown thick oils" were obtained. In the production of contemplated carbapenem antimicrobial compounds on a commercial scale, the compound of formula (I) in the thick oil form was not easy to handle. Further, when the oil compound is purified for improving the yield of the final target compound, for example, treatment with a column using a large amount of<br>
silica gel is necessary, leading to increased cost.<br>
Thus, compounds of formula (I) not in a crystal form have hitherto been known. So far as the present inventors know, however, crystal forms of compounds of formula (I) have not been known up to now, and even an attempt to produce such crystal form has not been made.<br>
[SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0012]	The    present    inventors    have    now    succeeded    in<br>
obtaining a crystal form of the compound of formula (I) the presence of which has not been known. Specifically, the present inventors have found that a crystal of the compound of formula (I) or its salt or solvate can be produced by carrying out a specific crystallization procedure using a specific solvent. The present invention has been made based on such finding.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a crystal form of a compound of formula (I) which is a synthetic intermediate of a 2-substituted-ß-methyl carbapenem compound useful as antimicrobial agents.<br>
[0013]	The crystal  according  to the present invention  is a<br>
crystal of the compound of formula (I), its salt, or their solvate:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein TBS represents t-butyldimethylsilyl; and Ph represents phenyl.<br>
[0014]	The process for producing a crystal of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or its salt or solvate according to the present invention comprises dissolving the compound of formula (I) in a solvent selected from the group consisting of water,<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, diethyl ether, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, and a mixture of any one of said solvents with a solvent for crystallization, and precipitating a crystal from the solution.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, there is<br>
provided use of the crystal as a synthetic intermediate for<br>
the	production	of	2-substituted-ß-methyl<br>
carbapenem-based antimicrobial agent compounds.<br>
[0015]	The   use   of   the   crystal   according   to   the   present<br>
invention as a synthetic intermediate can realize the production of carbapenem compounds having high microbial activity in a simpler manner and can improve the yield of the carbapenem compounds. Further, according to the present invention, since the compound of formula (I) can be provided as a crystal form, in the production of the compound of formula (I) on a commercial scale, the synthesis, isolation, and purification of the compound of formula (I) can be facilitated and simplified. Further, the handleability of the crystal form per se is excellent. Furthermore, according to the present invention, the yield and purity of the intermediate after the production of the compound of formula (1) in the process of producing a carbapenem compound can be improved. That is, the crystal according to the present invention is favorable as a synthetic intermediate for the production of a 2-substituted-lp-methyl carbapenem compound from the viewpoints of stability and purity.<br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION] [0016] Crystal according to invention<br>
As described above, the crystal according to the present invention is a crystal of the compound of formula (I), its salt or their solvate. The crystal according to the present invention is useful as a synthetic intermediate for the production of 2-substituted-ß-methyl carbapenem<br>
compounds.<br>
In the present invention, the crystal refers to a solid having an internal structure comprising three-dimensionally, regularly and repeatedly ordered constituent atoms or molecules and is distinguished from an amorphous solid or a noncrystalline form free from such regularly ordered internal structure. In general, even in the case of an identical compound, crystals (crystal polymorphs) having a plurality of different internal structures and physicochemical properties are formed under some crystallization conditions. In the present invention, the crystal may be any of these crystal polymorphs or may be a mixture of two or more crystal polymorphs.<br>
[0017]	A crystal of a compound of formula (I), a crystal of a<br>
salt of a compound of formula (I), and a crystal of a solvate of a compound of formula (I) are of course embraced in the crystal according to the present invention. In addition, a crystal of a solvate of a salt of a compound of formula (I) is also embraced in the crystal according to the present invention.<br>
[0018]	In the present invention, the salt of the compound of<br>
formula (I) is not particularly limited so far as it can be<br>
derived using conventional organic acids or inorganic acids.<br>
Since, however, the final product produced using the<br>
compound of formula (I) as a synthetic intermediate may be<br>
used as an antimicrobial agent, this salt is preferably a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt.	The term<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein refers to a salt that is suitable for use in pharmaceutical preparation applications and is basically nontoxic to organisms. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids, that is, inorganic acid salts and organic acid salts. Examples of preferred acids include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, hydrobromic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, phosphoric acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid,<br>
succinic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, di-p-toluoyltartaric acid, sulfanilic    acid,    tartaric    acid,    acetic    acid,    citric    acid, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, benzoic acid, malonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, and benzenesulfonic acid.<br>
[0019]	When  the  compound   of formula   (I)   is  placed   in  a<br>
solution or suspended state using a certain solvent, in some cases, the compound, together with the molecules of the solvent, forms a crystal. Likewise, when the compound of formula (I) is placed in a system in which a certain solvent is brought to a vapor form, in some cases, the compound, together with the molecules of the solvent, forms a crystal. In the present invention, this material formed by crystallization of the compound of formula (I) and the solvent in a three-dimensional order will be called a solvate. Solvents usable for solvate formation include water, alcohols, ethers, and esters. Therefore, in the present invention, the expression "solvate of the compound of formula (I) or its salt" is used in referring to embrace hydrates.<br>
Specific examples of solvents usable for solvate formation include water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, diethyl ether, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, and butyl acetate.<br>
[0020]	In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the crystal according to the present invention is a crystal of a compound of formula (I) or its solvate. More preferably, the crystal is a crystal of a hydrate, an alcoholate, or a solvate with an ester solvent. More preferably, the crystal is a solvate of the compound of formula (I) with an alkyl acetate solvent. The alkyl acetate refers to an ester of a C1-6 (preferably C1-4) alcohol with acetic acid and may also be expressed as C1-6 alkyl acetate or C1-6 alkyl ester of acetic acid.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the crystal according to the present invention is a crystal of a solvate of a compound of formula (I) with ethyl acetate, a crystal of a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) with a butyl acetate, or a crystal of a solvate of a compound of formula (I) with ethyl acetate or butyl acetate and hexane.<br>
[0021]	In   the   present   invention,   that   the   compound   of<br>
formula (I), its salt, or their solvate is in a crystal form can be confirmed by utilizing observation under a polarization microscope, a powder X-ray crystal analysis, or a single crystal X-ray diffraction measurement. The type of the crystal may also be identified by comparison of the characteristics of the crystal with data based on each index which have been previously measured. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the crystal according to the present invention can be identified to be a crystal by utilizing the above measuring means.<br>
[0022]	Crystal I<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a crystal of a compound of formula (I) with an ethyl acetate solvate. The crystal of a compound of formula (I) with an ethyl acetate solvate (hereinafter often referred to as "crystal I") can be produced, for example, by a method described in Example 2 which will be described later. The crystal of the ethyl acetate solvate exhibits a powder X-ray diffraction pattern described in Example 2 which will be described later. This crystal can be characterized by diffraction angles of diffraction peaks observed in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
[0023]	Accordingly,   in   one   preferred   embodiment   of   the<br>

this crystal exhibits a powder X-ray diffraction pattern having diffraction peaks at at least diffraction angles (26) shown in Table I-b below: Table I-b Diffraction angle (2θ) [°]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0025]	In   the    present   invention,    some   errors   may    be<br>
observed in diffraction angle (29) values due to various error sources. Error sources attributable to sample powder include particle size, water content, density, and crystallinity of sample powder, and error sources attributable to measurement environments include temperature, humidity, atmosphere, and measuring persons. Further error sources attributable to the measuring apparatus include, for example, the output of X-ray lamps, counters, various slit widths and scanning speeds. In the present specification, when the crystal is defined by diffraction angles 20, the diffraction angle 26 value is not limited to the value indicated on the basis that a peak exists, and a range based on this, and the range in which errors are possibly observed may be included as the diffraction angle 20 value in the crystal of the present invention. This range in which errors are observed can easily be predicted by a person having ordinary skill in the<br>
Manuscript Amended Sheets:   art from measuring conditions and the like. This is true of crystal II and crystal III which will be described later.<br>
[0026]	In   the   present   invention,   the   expression   "having<br>
diffraction peaks" at specific diffraction angles (26) in a powder X-ray diffraction pattern refers to, for example, a case satisfying the following conditions. Specifically, at specific diffraction angles, a value obtained by subtracting background (sum of noncrystalline scattering and noncoherent scattering) from absolute intensity is designated as "signal intensity." 1/2 of oscillation of noise at a specific diffraction angle is designated as "noise level." When the ratio between "signal intensity" and "noise level" is not less than 2, this state may be regarded as "having diffraction peaks."<br>

combination with the compound of formula (I) is properly selected, for example, a vapor diffusion method utilizing vapor equilibrium of the solvent, or a method utilizing concentration of a solution upon evaporation of the solvent, or saturation solubility. Crystals of the salt of the compound of formula (I), its solvate, and the solvent of the salt can be produced in the same manner as described above.<br>
[0039]	According to the present invention, there is provided a<br>

the process for producing a crystal of the compound of formula (I) or its salt or solvate comprises subjecting the above solution and a separately provided solvent for crystallization to the procedure of a vapor diffusion method to precipitate crystals. In this case, the procedure of the vapor diffusion method comprises placing the above solution<br>
and the separately provided solvent separately from each other within a hermetically sealable vessel in a volume ratio of 1 : 1 to 1: 20, preferably 1 : 2 to 1 : 10 and allowing them to stand. Further, the crystal obtained after standing may be if necessary subjected to filtration and drying.<br>

[0049]	The   present  invention   is  further  illustrated   by  the<br>
following Examples that are not intended as a limitation of the scope of the invention.<br>
[0050] Example 1: Synthesis of compound of formula (I)<br>
(3S,4S)-3-[(lR)-l-(t-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)ethyl]-4-[( lR)-l-carboxyethyl]-2-azetidinone used was a commercially available one (for example, available from Kanefuchi Chemical Co, Ltd., NIPPON SODA CO., LTD., or Takasago International Corp.).<br>
t-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (49.74 g, 0.33 mol) and<br>
imidazole (22.47 g, 0.33 mol) were continuously added to a<br>
solution	of<br>
(3S,4S)-3-[(lR)-l-(t-butyldimethylsilyloxy)ethyl]-4-[(lR)-l-carboxyethyl]-2-azetidinone (90.4 g, 0.30 mol) in 450 mL of dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture was then stirred in an argon atmosphere at 50°C for 4 hr. Next, the solution thus obtained was removed by evaporation under the reduced pressure at a bath temperature of 30°C. The residue was dissolved in 1.5 L of petroleum ether and was washed with 0.4 L of water, followed by extraction with 0.4 L of petroleum ether from the aqueous phase. The organic phases were combined. The organic phase was washed with 0.33 L of cold 1 N hydrochloric acid, cold 5% sodium<br>
bicarbonate water (0.5 L x 2), and 0.4 L of saturated brine in<br>
a successive manner and was dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate. Thereafter, the organic layer was<br>
filtered, and the solvent was removed by evaporation under<br>
the reduced pressure to give a solid of a t-butyldimethylsilyl<br>
(TBS) ester compound (117.6 g, yield 94.3%).<br>
[0051]	Allyl glyoxylate monohydrate (42.9 g, 0.325 mol) was<br>
added to a solution of 102.9 g (0.25 mol) of the TBS ester compound dissolved in 1.25 L of dry toluene. While removing water being produced with a Dean-Stark device, the mixture was heated under reflux for 10 hr. Thereafter, the solvent was removed by evaporation under the reduced pressure. The thick material thus obtained was dissolved in 0.8 L of dry tetrahydrofuran. The solution was cooled to -40°C. Thereafter, 2,6-lutidine (48.2 g, 0.45 mol) and thionyl chloride (53.5 g, 0.45 mol) were continuously added dropwise at an internal temperature of -25°C or below. Thereafter, the mixture was stirred at -20°C for 1.5 hr, and the insolubles were then removed by filtration. The solvent was removed from the filtrate by evaporation under the reduced pressure. Thereafter, 1 L of dry ethyl acetate was added to the residue, and the insolubles were removed by filtration. The solvent was removed from the filtrate by evaporation under the reduced pressure. The brown oil thus obtained was dissolved in 0.35 L of DMF, triphenylphosphine (118 g, 0.45 mol) was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solvent was removed by evaporation under the reduced pressure, 1.5 L of ethyl acetate was then dissolved in the residue, and the solution was washed with 0.25 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) (1 L x 2) and 1 L of saturated brine in that order. Next, the solution thus obtained was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and was filtered. The solvent was removed from the filtrate by evaporation under the reduced pressure to give a brown oil. The brown oil was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (1.5 kg of<br>
Silica Gel 60 (spherical)), manufactured by KANTO CHEMICAL CO., INC., chloroform : ethyl acetate = 5 : 1) to give a compound of formula (I) (99.3 g, yield 71.7%) as a light yellow thick material (noncrystalline material).<br>

A part of the light yellow thick material obtained above was further purified by column chromatography on silica gel (Wako Gel C-300, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., n-hexane : ethyl acetate = 1:1), and the solvent was removed by evaporation. The crude product thus obtained was dissolved in a minor amount of ethyl acetate, and n-hexane was added to the solution to give a crude crystal of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Ethyl acetate (2.9 L) was added to 1.367 kg of the crude crystal of the compound of formula (I), and the mixture was heated to 40°C with stirring for dissolution. Thereafter, 3.9 L of n-hexane was gradually added to the solution. When crystals began to precipitate, the system was dipped in an iced water bath, and ripening was carried out with slow stirring overnight. The crystals were collected through a glass filter and were washed with 1 L of n-hexane, and this washing was repeated three times. Next, the crystals were vacuum dried at a shelf temperature of 30°C overnight to give 1.232 kg of colorless crystals of the compound of formula (I).<br>

was added to a solution of this crude product dissolved in 3.3<br>
L of dry methylene chloride.	Next, 12 g of<br>
4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine and 461 g of triethylamine were added to this solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hr.
