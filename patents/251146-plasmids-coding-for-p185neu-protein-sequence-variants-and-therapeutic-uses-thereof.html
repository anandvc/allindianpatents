PLASMIPS    CODING    FOR    pl85'CB    PROTEIN    SEQUENCE<br>
VARIANTS AND THERAPEUTIC USES THEREOF<br>
The present invention refers to plasmid vectors containing DNA<br>
sequences coding for truncated and chimeric forms of pl85neu protein, and use<br>
thereof in DNA vaccination against Her-2/neu (ErbB-2)-positive tumors that<br>
express pl85neu protein. Plasmids according to the invention are capable of<br>
eliciting a protective immune response which is based on antibody and/or T<br>
lymphocyte induction against pl85neu protein-expressing tumors. The<br>
invention further refers to pharmaceutical compositions containing such<br>
plasmids and use thereof in preventive or therapeutic treatment of pl85ncu-<br>
positive tumors.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Neoplastic cells often differ from normal cells in that they express<br>
several proteins abnormally. Due to this anomalous expression, some proteins<br>
can act as Tumor Associate Antigens (TAA). This is because the host immune<br>
system can recognize these abnormalities and elicit an immune response that<br>
might protect the host from tumor onset and development. To be a target of<br>
antitumoral immunotherapy, a TAA must:<br>
•	have a pathogenetic role in a certain stage of neoplastic growth;<br>
•	be detectable by immune system even when the tumor gives rise to<br>
clonal variants which no more express major histocompatibility<br>
complex (HLA) glicoprotcins;<br>
•	be recognized by both antibodies and T lymphocytes.<br>
Several TAA have been discovered in human carcinomas in recent years.<br>
Among them, p185neu, the protein product of Her-2/neu (ErbB2) oncogenc, is a<br>
particularly suited target for immunothera+py (Lollini and Forni, 2003, Trends<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
2<br>
Immunol. 24: 62). p185neu is a membrane receptor of class I receptor tyrosin<br>
kinase family, which also encompasses the epidermal growth factor receptor<br>
(EGF-R or ErbB-1) and other related receptors (ErbB-3, ErbB-4) which play a<br>
key role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Hynes and Stern, 1994, BBA<br>
1198: 165).<br>
pl85neu receptor protein can be subdivided into three domains: the<br>
extracellular domain (EC domain), the transmembrane domain (TM domain), and<br>
the intracytoplasmic domain (IC domain). Recently, the EC domain<br>
crystallographic structure of human and rat P185neu protein has been published.<br>
This domain has been described to be composed of four subdomains (I/Ll,<br>
II/CR1, III/L2, and IV/CR2) for approximately 630 amino acids in all. It has been<br>
further shown that p 185neu protein has a rigid conformation, which allows it to<br>
interact with other ErbB receptors, dimerize, and induce transduction of<br>
proliferation signal even if this protein binds no ligands directly (Cho et al.,<br>
2003, Nature 421: 756).<br>
Her-2/neu (ErbB2) oncogene is involved in normal processes of<br>
embryonic organogenesis and epithelial growth, while in adults it is expressed<br>
only at faint levels (Press et al., 1990, Oncogene 5: 953). In humans,<br>
overexpression of this oncogene is mainly caused by gene amplification.<br>
Her-2/neu (ErbB2) oncogene is overexpressed in about 30% of mammary<br>
carcinomas, and such an overexpression is related to a more rapid tumor<br>
progression (Slamon et al., 1989, Science 244: 707). Among the different<br>
strategies which have been proposed, DNA vaccination seems to be an effective<br>
method to elicit an immune response to Her-2/neu-positive tumors. Even<br>
though pl85neu protein is a "self antigen, i.e. a protein which is normally<br>
present in the body, patients with pl85neu-positive mammary carcinomas often<br>
exhibit an immune response, both cellular and humoral (Signoretti et al., 2000,<br>
J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 23: 1918; Disis et al., 1994, Cancer Res. 54: 16; Peoples et<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
3<br>
al, 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 432). One of the objectives of<br>
antitumoral immunotherapies directed towards plSSneu" protein is to increase the<br>
response intensity in patients with a pre-existing immune response, or to<br>
generate an immune response in patients in whom this response is undetectable.<br>
The fact that pl85neu protein is a "self antigen entails that the vaccine must be<br>
able to overcome an immunotolerant state.<br>
The inventors of the instant patent application were the first using and<br>
validating the efficacy of DNA vaccination in eliciting an immune protection<br>
both  to  spontaneous mammary carcinomas  and transplantable Her-2/neu-<br>
positive tumors. These studies have proven that prevention and treatment of<br>
preneoplastic lesions is an accessible goal. In particular, in experiments aimed<br>
at preventing the development of spontaneous mammary tumors that arise in<br>
transgenic mice due to rat Her-2/neu oncogene (FVB/neuT mice and BALB-<br>
neuT mice), it has been shown that the plasmid coding for rat p185neu protein<br>
EC and TM domains is capable of eliciting a more effective protection<br>
compared to the plasmid coding for full-length pl85neu protein or plasmid<br>
coding for its EC domain only (secreted antigen) (Amici et al., 2000, Gene<br>
Ther. 7: 703; Rovero et al., 2000, J. Immunol. 165: 5133). Similar data have<br>
been reported by Chen et al., (1998, Cancer Res. 58: 1965). Furthermore, it has<br>
been shown that efficacy of vaccination with DNA plasmids is strongly<br>
increased if it is followed by a very short electric pulse when plasmids are<br>
inoculated intramuscularly (Quaglino et al., 2004, Cancer Res. 64: 2858). Other<br>
authors have shown that plasmids coding for full-length pl85neu protein, if<br>
necessary mutated such that it does not possess tyrosine kinase activity, are<br>
efficacious  in preventing the onset of tumors following the transplant of<br>
pl85ncu-positive cancer cells (Wei-Zen et al., 1999, Int. J. Cancer 81: 748). The<br>
same plasmids have proven as much effective even when, deprived of the leader<br>
signal responsible for protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, they<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCI7IB2005/003052<br>
4<br>
bring about the cytoplasmic localization of pl85neu antigen. When plasmids<br>
coding for pl85neu protein which localizes in membrane thanks to the presence<br>
of a leader signal are used, protections depends upon an immune response<br>
which relies on antibodies. On the contrary, a T lymphocyte-mediated immune<br>
response is observed if vaccine does not contain a leader signal, and hence<br>
pl85neu protein localizes in the cytoplasm of transfected cells rather than on<br>
their plasma membrane (Pilon et al., 2001, J. Immunol. 167: 3201). In addition,<br>
a combined vaccination obtained by using both plasmids with a leader signal<br>
and those in which this leader signal has been deleted, is more effective in<br>
protecting against tumor growth (Piechocki et al., 2001, J. Immunol. 167:<br>
3367). This demonstrates that there is a synergistic effect between humoral and<br>
cellular responses in the prevention of p ^""-positive carcinomas (Reilly et<br>
al., 2001, Cancer Res. 61: 880).<br>
Vaccination with the plasmid coding for EC and TM domains (EC-TM<br>
plasmid) has proven efficacious not only in preventing the development of<br>
spontaneous pl85neu-positive carcinomas, but also in treating tumor masses of 2<br>
mm in diameter by involving a range of effector immune system mechanisms<br>
(T helper and T killer cells, antibodies, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer<br>
cells, Fc receptors, IFN-gamma, and performs), which coordinatcly contribute to<br>
tumor rejection (Curcio et al., 2003, J. Clin. Invest. 111: 1161).<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Several plasmids coding for the full-length TM domain and decreasing<br>
portions of EC domain of rat pl85neu protein have been construclcd. The<br>
truncated plasmids, obtained by deleting the NH2-terminal 240 base pairs (bp),<br>
or multiples of this length, were used in experiments aimed at preventing<br>
growth of transplantable rat pl85ncu protein-overexpressing tumor cells (TUBO<br>
cells). Furthermore, a series of plasmids coding for chimeric pl85ncu protein<br>
forms were created by adding NH2-terminal portions of human ErbB2 cDNA to<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
5<br>
sequences coding for the truncated forms of rat protein to reconstitute the whole<br>
protein sequence.<br>
Protection achieved following vaccination with plasmid coding for the<br>
full-length EC and TM domains is mainly due to antibody production, while<br>
protection attained by using plasm ids coding for the truncated forms of rat<br>
pl85neu protein is not associated with a significant antibody production in<br>
many cases.<br>
On the basis of the results of the in vivo experiments, plasmids capable<br>
of inducing a strong immune response, both antibody and T<br>
lymphocyte-mediated, were selected.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention refers to plasmids containing a coding<br>
sequence for a pl85neu protein fragment, which sequence is selected from the<br>
group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1-5; or a sequence coding for a chimeric<br>
pl85neu protein, which sequence is selected from the group consisting of SEQ<br>
ID NO:6-12 (reference sequences for genes coding for human and rat pl85ncu<br>
proteins are deposited in Gene Bank with accession NO. MI 1730 and X03362,<br>
respectively).<br>
DNA sequences coding for the truncated and chimeric forms of pl85ncu<br>
protein according to the invention can be inserted into any plasmid vectors<br>
suitable for use in mammals, particularly in humans. Besides the above coding<br>
sequences, plasmids can include functional elements to control transcription, in<br>
particular promoters, preferably the CMV promoter, located upstream of the<br>
coding sequence, transcription initiation and stop sequences; a selection marker,<br>
preferably the ampicilline or kanamycine resistance genes; CpG motifs; a<br>
polyadenilation site; and in case enhancers or transcription activators. The<br>
elements for controlling transcription must be suitable for use of vectors in<br>
mammals, particularly in humans.<br>
In another aspect, the invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
6<br>
containing a DNA plasmid defined as above, together with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable vehicles and excipients. Alternatively, the compositions can<br>
contain admixtures of two or more different plasraids coding for both the<br>
truncated and chimeric forms of pl85neu protein. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions in a suitable form for parenteral administration, preferably in the<br>
form of an injectable solution, are preferably used for DNA vaccination.<br>
Principles and methods for DNA vaccination are known to those skilled in the<br>
art, and are described, e.g., in Liu, 2003; J. Int. Med. 253: 402.<br>
Utilization of plasmids coding for the pl85neu truncated and chimeric<br>
forms to preventively and therapeutically vaccinate against pl85neu-positive (Her-<br>
2/neu-, ErbB-2-positive) tumors has a variety of advantages which ameliorate its<br>
efficacy. For plasmids coding for the truncated forms, these advantages are:<br>
1)	The possibility to obtain a vaccine coding only for definite TAA<br>
portions against which it is desired to develop an immune response;<br>
this vaccine has a les chance to elicit autoimmune phenomena.<br>
2)	The exclusive induction of some selected forms of immune response,<br>
i.e. an antibody-mediated form or a T lymphocyte-mediated form.<br>
3)	The possibility to produce vaccines which combine multiple epitopes<br>
having a defined imraunogenicity by binding cDNA fragments each<br>
other  which  code  for different  truncated  forms,  not  necessarily<br>
sequentially.<br>
The use of chimeric plasmids generated by a combination of truncated<br>
forms of pl85neu from a different animal species allows to:<br>
a)	Vaccinate with plasmids coding for protein determinants of the same<br>
species to be immunized, e.g. humans, which is able to elicit a specific<br>
high-affinity response;<br>
b)	Combine plasmids coding for antigenic determinants of the same<br>
species to be immunized with cDNA sequences coding for antigenic<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2O05/003O52<br>
7<br>
determinants from other species, the antigenic determinants showing a<br>
substantial similarity but differing in that those from other species<br>
elicit a more intense immune response, thus overcoming the tolerance<br>
state. These allogeneic determinants, which are recognized as partially<br>
exogenous, act as helper determinants facilitating the induction of a<br>
more intense response and cytokine release;<br>
c)	Combine plasmids coding for antigenic determinants of the same<br>
species with cDNA sequences which, by coding determinants of<br>
another species, in some individuals can give rise to heteroclytic<br>
determinants which bind with higher affinity to HLA molecules and<br>
induce more intense immune responses having a higher affinity;<br>
d)	Have a vaccine which combines advantages from a) with those from<br>
b) and c).<br>
Properly formulated DNA plasmids according to the invention are used in<br>
preventive or therapeutic treatment of humans or animals which show a high risk<br>
of developing pl85neu positive carcinomas, or patients carrying pl85neu-positive<br>
primary rumors, their relapses or metastases. Prevention can be primary, when<br>
the tumor is not evident yet; secondary, when the tumor is in its initial stages as a<br>
preneoplastic lesion; or tertiary, if a tumor relapse or metastatic process is<br>
observed.<br>
Tumors treatable with plasmids or compositions of the invention are<br>
primarily those of epithelial origin, particularly pulmonary, ovarian, and<br>
mammary adenocarcinomas; squamous head and neck carcinomas, and more<br>
generally pl85ncu protein-expressing tumors.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Construction of plasmids coding for truncated forms of rat pl85neu<br>
protein<br>
The plasmid backbone pCMV3.1 (obtained in our laboratory starting<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
8<br>
from pcDNA3.1 from Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) was used to produce the DNA<br>
plasmids coding for the full-length TM domain and decreasing portions of EC<br>
domain of rat  pl85neu protein. pCMV3.1 contains the rat Her-2/neu 5' UTR<br>
nucleotide sequence (which is transcribed but not translated) and leader<br>
sequence (neuL). The secretion signal DNA fragment of rat pl85neu protein<br>
was obtained by enzymatic amplification of DNA using the pCMV-EC-TM<br>
vector  (Amici  et al,  2000,  Gene  Ther.,  7:  703;  Rovero  et al.,  2000,<br>
J. Immunol., 165: 5133) as a template, T7 primer as a sense oligonucleotide<br>
(oligonucleotide #1), and an oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide #2) having a<br>
terminal EcoRI site as an antisensc oligonucleotide. Following purification<br>
and digestion with Hindlll and EcoRI restriction enzymes, the amplified<br>
fragment was cloned into pCMV3.1 plasmid which had been digested with the<br>
same enzymes, thus obtaining pCMV3.1-neuL. Subsequently, seven different<br>
sequences coding for the deleted fragments of EC domain and full-length TM<br>
domain of rat pl85neu protein have been inserted in frame into pCMV3.1-neuL<br>
vector digested with EcoRI and Xbal restriction enzymes. The new plasmids<br>
so obtained were designated pCMV3.1-neuL-rECl-TM (-70 amino acids)<br>
(Fig. 1), pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC2-TM (-150 amino acids) (Fig. 2), pCMV3.1-<br>
neuL-rEC3-TM (-230 amino acids) (Fig. 3), pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC4-TM (-310<br>
amino acids) (Fig. 4), pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC5-TM (-390 amino acids) (Fig. 5),<br>
pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC6-TM (-470 amino acids) (Fig. 6), and pCMV3.1-neuL-<br>
rEC7-TM (-550 amino acids) (Fig. 7). The fragment coded for by the first of<br>
these plasmids is 70 amino acids shorter, including the secretion signal amino<br>
acid sequence. All other fragments are progressively shorter by 80 amino<br>
acids.<br>
These fragments have been produced by enzymatic amplification of<br>
DNA using seven different sense oligonucleotides all having a terminal £coRI<br>
restriction site (oligonucleotides #3-#9), and an antisense oligonucleotide<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
9<br>
(oligonucleotide #10) capable of recognizing a site called "pcDNA3.1/BGH<br>
Reverse Priming Site" (830-850 nt) at the 3' end of pCMV3.1 multiple<br>
cloning site. As a DNA template for PCR, pCMV-EC-TM vector (Amici A. et<br>
al. 2000, Gene Ther. 7: 703; Rovero et al., 2000, J. Immunol. 165: 5133) was<br>
used. Following enzymatic digestion with EcoRI and Xbal restriction<br>
enzymes, amplification products were cloned into pCMV3.1-neuL plasmid.<br>
Vaccination   with   pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC4-TM   plasmid   as   well   as<br>
vaccination with pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC-TM plasmid which codes for the full-<br>
length EC and TM domains protects 100% of BALB/c mice from developing<br>
tumors induced by inoculation of TUBO cells. On the other hand, vaccination<br>
with pCMV3.1-neuL-rECl-TM, pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC2-TM, and pCMV3.1-<br>
neuL-rEC3-TM plasmids which code for the first three truncated forms of<br>
pl85neu protein protects 70-80% of BALB/c mice. pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC5-TM<br>
plasmid which codes for the fifth truncated form protects 50% of BALB/c<br>
mice,    while    pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC6-TM    and    pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC7-TM<br>
plasmids which code for the sixth and seventh truncated forms induce no<br>
protection. The results obtained demonstrate that cellular response activated<br>
by the pl85neu protein truncated forms whose localization is cytoplasmic, is<br>
sufficient in antitumoral prevention. However, concomitant activation of<br>
cellular and humoral responses allows obtaining a more effective therapy<br>
(Rielly et al., 2001, Cancer Res. 61: 880). To attain antibody production,<br>
vaccination must be carried out with plasmid coding for the full-length EC and<br>
TM domains of pl85neu protein. Vaccination with pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC4-TM<br>
plasmid which codes for the fourth truncated pl85neu form lacking amino acids<br>
1-310 is still able to confer a full protection, but antibody response is 10-fold<br>
lower compared to that of pCMV3.1-neuL-rEC-TM plasmid (Table 1).<br><br>

Construction of chimeric human-rat plasmids capable of coding for<br>
seven different fusion forms of pl85neu protein (HuRTl-7)<br>
The majority of epitopes presented by HLA are located on the first<br>
subdomain (I/Ll) of pl85neu protein. Therefore, chimeric plasmids coding for<br>
sequences of human ErbB2 protein which are increasingly longer starting from<br>
NH2-end (the outermost portion of EC domain) have been constructed to<br>
induce a specific immune response against these epitopes. These new<br>
plasmids, designated HuRT (Human Rat Transmembrane), were created by<br>
adding the lacking portions of human ErbB2 cDNA to sequences which code<br>
for the truncated forms of rat pl85neu protein.<br>
The first five truncated plasmids coding for full-length TM domain and<br>
decreasing fragments of EC domain of rat pl85neu protein were digested with<br>
Hindlll and EcoRl restriction enzymes. The five different human cDNA<br>
fragments obtained by PCR and digested at their ends were cloned within these<br>
five truncated plasmids, so that reading frame was maintained. The cDNA<br>
fragments coding for portions of human pl85neu protein to be inserted,<br>
including the 5' UTR region and secretion signal to pass through endoplasmic<br>
reticulum, were produced by amplification using pcDNA3.1erbB2 plasmid as a<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
11<br>
template. Six oligonucleotides were used as primers. The sense oligonucleotide<br>
is the same for all six primers and corresponds to T7 primer (oligonucleotide<br>
#1), while the five antisense oligonucleotides were designed so that they<br>
recognized human ErbB2 oncogene cDNA in increasingly advanced positions<br>
of the sequence and had an EcoRl restriction site at their 3' ends<br>
(oligonucleotides #11-#15). Following purification and digestion with Hindlll<br>
and EcoKl restriction enzymes, the amplified fragments were inserted into<br>
corresponding plasmids (pCMV3.1-rECl-TM, pCMV3.1-rEC2-TM, pCMV3.1-<br>
rEC3-TM, pCMV3.1-rEC4-TM, pCMV3.1-rEC5-TM), which had been<br>
previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. In this way five new<br>
plasmids have been obtained (pCMV3.1-HuRTl-5) which code for chimeric<br>
proteins of 689 amino acids in length, 2 amino acids of which (Glu-Phe) belong<br>
to the EcoRl restriction site used to join human and rat DNAs. The proteins<br>
coded for by these chimeric plasmids differ from each other by increasing<br>
portions of human pl85Deu protein and decreasing portions of rat pl85ncu<br>
protein.<br>
To obtain the chimeric plasmids coding for the sixth and seventh<br>
truncated forms of rat pl85neu protein, two new plasmids were constructed in<br>
which cloning sites other than EcoKl could be used, as an EcoRl restriction<br>
site is present in the position 1450 in human ErbB2 gene sequence. pCMV3.1<br>
was modified by using a synthetic sequence made up of a sense<br>
oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide #16) and an antisense oligonucleotide<br>
(oligonucleotide #17), so that one of the two restriction sites for Pmel enzyme<br>
was deleted and the restriction sites for Hindlll and Nhel restriction enzymes,<br>
located on its multiple cloning site, were inverted. The new plasmid backbone<br>
so obtained was designated pCMV3.1H/N. Fragments for the sixth and<br>
seventh truncated forms of rat pl85neu protein were produced by amplification<br>
using pCMV-EC-TM plasmid (Amici et al.y 2000, Gene Ther., 7: 703; Rovero<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/1B2005/003052<br>
12<br>
et al.t 2000, J. Immunol.y 165: 5133) as a template and two different sense<br>
oligonucleotides with a Nhel restriction site at their ends (oligonucleotides<br>
#18 and #19), and antisense oligonucleotide #10.<br>
Following enzymatic digestion with restriction enzymes Nhel and Pmel,<br>
the amplification products were cloned into pCMV3.1H/N plasmid, thus<br>
obtaining the new pCMV3.1H/N-rEC6-TM and pCMV3.1H/N-rEC7-TM<br>
plasm ids. The cDNA fragments coding for portions of human pl85neu protein<br>
to be inserted to generate the chimeric pCMV3.1H/N-HuRT6 and<br>
pCMV3.1H/N-HuRT7 plasmids were obtained by amplification using<br>
pcDNA3.1erbB2 plasmid as a template, T7 primer as a sense oligonucleotide<br>
(oligonucleotide #1), and two primers designed so that they recognized human<br>
cDNA at suitable positions and had a Nhel restriction site at their ends<br>
(oligonucleotides #20 and #21), as antisense oligonucleotides.<br>
Following purification and digestion with Hindlll and Nhel restriction<br>
enzymes, the amplified fragments were inserted into corresponding plasmids<br>
(pCMV3.1H/N-rEC6-TM; pCMV3.1H/N-rEC7-TM), which had previously<br>
digested with the same restriction enzymes. In this way the two new chimeric<br>
pCMV3.1H/N-HuRT6 and pCMV3.1H/N-HuRT7 plasmids were obtained,<br>
which code for proteins of 689 amino acids in length, 2 amino acids of which<br>
(Val-Ser) belong to the Nhel restriction site used to join human and rat DNAs.<br>
These manipulations led to the following plasmids:<br>
•	pCMV3.1-HuRTl plasmid (Fig. 8), which codes for 70 amino acids<br>
of EC domain of human pl85neu protein, 2 amino acids belonging to<br>
EcoRI site and 618 amino acids of rat pl85neu protein<br>
•	pCMV3.1-HuRT2 plasmid (Fig. 9), which codes for 150 amino<br>
acids of human pl85ncu protein EC domain and 538 amino acids of<br>
rat pl85neu protein<br>
•	pCMV3.1-HuRT3 plasmid (Fig. 10), which codes for 230 amino acids<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
13<br>
of EC domain of human pl85neu protein and 458 amino acids of rat<br>
pl85neu protein<br>
•	pCMV3.1-HuRT4 plasmid (Fig. 11), which codes for 310 amino<br>
acids of EC domain of human pl85neu protein and 378 amino acids<br>
of rat pl85neu protein<br>
•	pCMV3.1-HuRT5 plasmid (Fig. 12), which codes for 390 amino<br>
acids of EC domain of human pl85neu protein and 298 amino acids<br>
ofrat pl85neu protein<br>
•	pCMV3.1 H/N-HuRT6 plasmid (Fig. 13), which codes for 470 amino<br>
acids of EC domain of human pl85neu protein and 218 amino acids<br>
of rat pl85neu protein<br>
•	pCMV3.1 H/N-HuRT7 plasmid (Fig. 14), which codes for 550 amino<br>
acids of EC domain of human pl85neu protein and 138 amino acids<br>
of rat pl85ncu protein.<br>
The indirect evidence of a membrane expression of the chimeric<br>
human-rat proteins coded for by these plasmids has been obtained by<br>
immunizing mice with the seven new plasmids (pCMV3.1-HuRTl-5 and<br>
pCMV3.1H/N-HuRT6-7). The sera from all vaccinated mice have specific<br>
antibodies against the chimeric human and rat pl85ncu protein. Furthermore,<br>
animals vaccinated with plasmids coding for the seven different chimeric<br>
proteins are protected from a lethal inoculation of TUBO cells and/or human<br>
pl85neu protein-overexpressing tumor cells (D2F2-E2 cells).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Construction of pCMV3.1-HuRT5 Plasmid<br>
pCMV3.1-rEC5-TM plasmid, which codes for the fifth truncated form<br>
of rat pl85neu protein, was digested with HindlU and £coRI restriction<br>
enzymes (BioLabs, Beverly, MA) to delete the 5' UTR region and neuL<br>
sequence.<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
14<br>
The 4794 bp DNA band corresponding to pCMV3.1-rEC5-TM plasmid<br>
lacking the 5' UTR region and neuL sequence was separated by agarose gel<br>
electrophoresis and eluted using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Italy).<br>
The cDNA for the 5' UTR region, leader sequence, and sequence coding for<br>
the missing part of human ErbB2 gene was obtained by PCR.<br>
pcDNA3.1ErbB2 plasmid was used as a template, T7 primer (oligonucleotide<br>
#1) was used as a sense oligonucleotide, and a primer with an EcoRl<br>
restriction site at its 5' end (oligonucleotide #15) was used as an antisense<br>
oligonucleotide. To perform the PCR reaction, reagents and a proofreading<br>
Taq polymerasc of Finnzymes (CELBIO, Milan, Italy) were employed.<br>
Following the PCR reaction, the amplified DNA was purified and precipitated<br>
by standard methods, resuspended in 50ul H2O, and digested with HindlU and<br>
£coRI restriction enzymes. The cDNA fragment coding for the relevant<br>
portion of human ErbB2 and the linearized pCMV3.1-rEC5-TM plasmid were<br>
cloned by ligation reaction using T4 DNA ligase (BioLabs, Beverly, MA).<br>
The ligation product was then used to transform DH5ct strain E. coli<br>
bacteria which had been made competent by the calcium chloride technique.<br>
The clones so obtained were analyzed by alcaline lysis to detect the<br>
clones containing the chimeric pCMV3.1-HuRT5 plasmid.<br>
pCMV3.1-HuRT5 was then analyzed by the Sanger sequencing method<br>
using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer automated sequencer (Applied<br>
Biosystem) to verify that insertion of human sequence portion coding for<br>
ErbB2 gene into plasmid coding for the fifth truncated form of rat p!85ncu<br>
protein had taken place correctly and without altering the reading frame.<br>

Example 2: in Vivo Testing<br>
Animals<br>
BALB/c strain female mice about 7-week old were used for all<br>
experiments. Animals came from Charles River Laboratories (Calco, Milan,<br>
Italy), where they had been bred aseptically and according to the rules<br>
established by European Community.<br>
Intramuscular Administration Followed by in Vivo Electroporation<br>
To avoid pain and undesired contractions of tibial muscles, each mouse<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCT/IB2005/003052<br>
16<br>
was anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 300pl Avertin, a solution<br>
consisting of 0.58 g tribromoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 310 \x[ Tert-Amyl<br>
alcohol (Aldrich) in 39.5 ml deionized H2O. Tibial muscles of anaesthetized<br>
mice were shaved, and 20 uJ of a solution containing 25 ug DNA were<br>
inoculated in each muscle. The DNA-containing solution was prepared just<br>
before use according to Dr. F. Pericle's instructions (Valentis, Inc., The<br>
Woodlands, Texas, USA). This solution contained plasmid DNA at a<br>
concentration of 1.25 mg/ml, poly-L-glutamate sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich,<br>
S.r.l., Milan, Italy) at a concentration of 6 mg/ml, sodium chloride at a<br>
concentration of 150 mM (Fluka, BioChemika, Buchs, Switzerland), and<br>
endotoxin-free distillated water (Nuclearc Free Water, Promega Corporation)<br>
to a final volume of lml. After about 5 minutes of inoculation, two electrical<br>
pulses, 375 V/cm2 in intensity and 25 msec in duration each, generated by an<br>
Electro Square Porator electroporator (T820, BTX, San Diego, CA, USA)<br>
were applied to both tibial muscles of mice using two steel electrodes located<br>
3 mm apart in a quadrangular arrangement laterally in the leg. Gene<br>
immunization by electroporation was performed twice in each animal 21 and 7<br>
days before inoculating tumor cells.<br>
Inoculation of Tumor Cells<br>
Left sides of mice were inoculated with 0.2 ml of a suspension<br>
containing 2 x 105 TUBO cells.<br>
In vivo Tumor Growth Evaluation<br>
Tumor growth was evaluated by palpation weekly, and tumor size was<br>
measured along two perpendicular diameters with a gauge. Neoplastic masses<br>
of a size larger than 1 millimeter were considered as tumors. Tumor growth<br>
was monitored for 100 days from tumor inoculation or until tumor size<br>
exceeded 10 millimeters in diameter, time at which animals were sacrificed.<br>
The results obtained demonstrate that chimeric pCMV3.1-HuRT5 plasmid is<br><br>
WO 2006/040660	PCMB2005/003052<br>
17<br>
able to protect 100% of vaccinated BALB/c mice from a lethal inoculation of<br>
TUBO cells (Table 2).<br>

Evaluation of Anti-pl85neu Antibody Presence in Sera of Vaccinated<br>
Animals<br>
The day preceding the inoculation of tumor cells, blood was drawn from<br>
animals vaccinated with chimeric pCMV3.1-HuRT5 plasmid.  Sera were<br>
analyzed to assess the presence of rat anti-pl85neu antibodies. Sera were<br>
incubated for 45 minutes at 4°C with cells overexpressing rat pl85neu. After<br>
washing  with   a  solution  called  the  washing  buffer,  which  consists   of<br>
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA,<br>
Sigma, Milan, Italy) and 0.1% sodium azide (NaN3, Sigma, Milan, Italy),<br>
samples   were   incubated   for  20   minutes   at   4°C   with   an   anti-mouse<br>
immunoglobulin FITC-conjugated antibody, washed with washing buffer, and<br>
analyzed by a FACScan cytofluorimeter (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry<br>
Systems, Mountain View, California, USA). Simultaneously, the same cells<br>
were incubated with decreasing concentrations of monoclonal anti-c-ErbB2/c-<br>
neu antibody (Ab4, Oncogene), so that a relationship between the fluorescence<br>
intensities obtained through cytofluorimeter analysis and concentration of<br>
anti-pl85neu antibodies in animal sera could be derived. The data obtained<br>
show that all vaccinated animals exhibit high levels of anti-rat pl85neu<br>
antibodies, and therefore chimeric pCMV3.1-HuRT5 plasmid is effective in<br>
inducing rejection of transplantable pl85neu-positive tumors and in eliciting a<br>
specific antibody response.<br><br>
