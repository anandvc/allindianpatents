FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the field of medicine, particularly in the field of<br>
monoclonal antibodies against human IL-17. The invention relates to neutralizing anti-<br>
IL-17 monoclonal antibodies that bind with high affinity to an IL-17 non-linear or<br>
conformational antigenic epitope comprising amino acids DGNVDYH. The antibodies of<br>
the invention may be chimeric, humanized or human antibodies, immunoconjugates of<br>
the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof and are useful as a medicament for<br>
the treatment of autoimmune, inflammatory, cell proliferative and developmental<br>
disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The IL-17 family of cytokines presently includes EL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-<br>
17D, EL-17E and IL-17F. All IL-17 family members have four highly conserved cysteine<br>
residues that are involved in the formation of intrachain disulfide linkages and have two<br>
or more cysteine residues that may be involved in interchain disulfide linkages. Members<br>
of the IL-17 family have no sequence similarity to any other known cytokines. However,<br>
a viral homologue of IL-17A was found in open reading frame 13 of herpesvirus saimiri<br>
(Yao, Z. et al., Immunity, 3:811,1995) and has 72% amino acid residue identity to human<br>
IL-17 A. Multiple functions have been reported for the IL-17 family members that mainly<br>
involve regulation of the immune response.<br>
Interleukin 17 (IL-17, also referred to as IL-17 A) is a 20-30 kD homodimeric<br>
glycoprotein produced predominantly by activated CD4+ T cells and functions as a<br>
proinflammatory cytokine. When a particular IL-17 family member is referred to simply<br>
as "IL-17," it is understood that the family member referred to is DL-17A. IL-17 is<br>
secreted by activated T cells at sites of inflammation not in the systemic circulation. IL-<br>
17 binds to a type I transmembrane receptor termed IL-17R which is a large ubiquitously<br>
expressed protein that demonstrates no significant sequence similarity to other known<br>
cytokine receptors. IL-17 has multiple biologic properties including upregulating<br>
adhesion molecules and inducing the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and<br>
chemokines from various cell types including synoviocytes, chondroctes, fibroblasts,<br><br>
endothelial cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages. Also, IL-17 induces<br>
recruitment of neutrophils to an inflammatory site through induction of chemokine<br>
release, stimulates production of prostaglandins and metalloproteinases, and inhibits<br>
proteoglycan synthesis. Furthermore, IL-17 plays an important role in the maturation of<br>
hematopoietic progenitor cells. It has been demonstrated that IL-17 has signaling roles in<br>
different organs and tissues including lung, articular cartilage, bone, brain, hematopoietic<br>
cells, kidney, skin and intestine. For a review of IL-17 bioactivity see, e.g., Kolls and<br>
Linden, Immunity 21:467-476,2004, or Fossiez, et al. Int. Rev. Immunol. 16:541,1998.<br>
Increased levels of IL-17 (i.e., EL-17A) have been associated with several<br>
conditions, diseases or disorders including airway inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis<br>
("RA"), osteoarthritis, bone erosion, intraperitoneal abscesses and adhesions,<br>
inflammatory bowel disorder ("IBD"), allograft rejection, psoriasis, certain types of<br>
cancer, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis ("MS") (for a review see<br>
Witkowski, et al, Cell. Mot Life Sci. 61:567-579,2004). Both EL-17 and IL-17R are up-<br>
regulated in the synovial tissue of RA patients. Blocking an IL-17 bioactivity by binding<br>
an IL-17 specific antibody or soluble receptor to IL-17 reduces inflammation and bone<br>
erosion in various animal arthritis models. (See, e.g., Lubberts et al, Arthritis &amp;<br>
Rheumatism, 50:650-659,2004). Furthermore, IL-17 has IL-ip independent effects on<br>
collagen matrix breakdown and inflammation and joint damage, while IL-17 has synergy<br>
with TNF-a to amplify inflammation.<br>
Thus, given its localized distribution at the site of inflammation, IL-17 appears to<br>
be a novel target for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases<br>
with a potentially greater safety profile than drugs that target the systemic circulation of<br>
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a. Current FDA approved byproducts<br>
(ENBREL*, REMICADE* and HUMIRA* antibodies) that bind to and neutralize TNF-a<br>
have demonstrated efficacy in reducing signs and symptoms of RA and in slowing<br>
progression of the disease in a subset of RA patients. However, not all RA patients<br>
respond equally to inhibition of a TNF-a bioactivity with these byproducts.<br>
Additionally, IL-17 mRNA is increased in multiple sclerosis lesions and in mononuclear<br>
cells in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients, particularly during clinical<br>
exacerbation. Accordingly, there is a need for compositions that antagonize or neutralize<br>
the activity of IL-17 in order to treat disorders, diseases or conditions wherein the<br><br>
presence of IL-17 bioactivity causes or contributes to an undesirable pathological effect<br>
or wherein a decrease in IL-17 bioactivity contributes to a desirable therapeutic effect,<br>
including inflammatory disorders, cell proliferative and developmental disorders and<br>
autoimmune disorders such as RA and MS and IBD.<br>
There is a need for a neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibody that specifically binds IL-17<br>
of human origin as well as IL-17 of a non-human mammal thereby allowing the antibody<br>
to be used in preclinical and clinical in vivo studies. Furthermore, there is a need for an<br>
IL-17-specific antibody which binds EL-17 with a high affinity and/or has a slow off rate<br>
thereby allowing the effective therapeutic dose to be minimized resulting in less frequent<br>
dosing with such an antibody than with an antibody that binds IL-17 with a lesser affinity<br>
(i.e., a higher KD) and/or has a faster off rate. A high affinity IL-17-specific antibody is<br>
also desirable in that it may allow the antibody to be administered to a patient<br>
subcutaneously rather than intravenously. There is also a need for an IL-17-specific<br>
antibody with a low ICJO value in an IL-17 bioactivity assay in order to generate a<br>
therapeutic anti-IL-17 antibody with a minimum effective therapeutic dose. It is also<br>
desirable to provide an antibody specific to IL-17 where an immune response to the<br>
antibody evoked by a patient receiving the antibody is reduced to a minimum. The<br>
present invention satisfies these needs and provides related advantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention presents chimeric, humanized or fully human anti-IL-17<br>
monoclonal antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, able to neutralize or<br>
antagonize at least one IL-17 activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Preferably, such antibodies<br>
of the invention are further characterized as having an IC50 less than about 600 or S60 pM<br>
in e.g., an in vitro IL-8 reporter assay or GROa reporter assay (see, e.g., Example 6)<br>
and/or preferably having a strong binding affinity with IL-17 of less than 4 pM. The<br>
antibodies of the invention are further characterized in that they specifically bind human<br>
and cynomolgus monkey IL-17 (SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 10 respectively) but do not bind<br>
murine or rat IL-17 (SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8 respectively). The antigenic epitope to which<br>
monoclonal antibodies of the invention bind is a non-linear epitope of human (and<br>
monkey) IL-17 and comprises residues DGNVDYH (SEQ ID NO: 276) of IL-17. An<br>
antibody of the invention makes contact with the peptide DGNVDYH when it is in the<br>
context of the full-length IL-17.<br>
Definitions<br>
"Interleukin 17" also referred to as "IL-17" or "IL-17A" is a 20-30 kD<br>
glycosylated homodimeric protein. The human IL-17 gene codes for a 155 amino acid<br>
protein that has a 19 amino acid signal sequence and a 136 amino acid mature segment.<br>
Human IL-17 shows amino acid sequence identity of 62.5% and 58% to the mouse and<br>
rat amino acid IL-17 sequences, respectively as shown in Figure 2. Human IL-17 shows<br>
amino acid sequence identity of 97.4% to the cynomolgus monkey IL-17.<br>
A full-length antibody as it exists naturally is an immunoglobulin molecule<br>
comprised of four peptide chains, two heavy (H) chains (about 50-70 kDa when full<br>
length) and two light (L) chains (about 25 kDa when full length) interconnected by<br>
disulfide bonds. The amino terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of<br>
about 100-110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The<br>
carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for<br>
effector function.<br>
Light chains are classified as kappa or lambda and characterized by a particular<br>
constant region. Each light chain is comprised of an N-terminal light chain variable<br>
region (herein "LCVR") and a light chain constant region comprised of one domain, CL.<br><br>
Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the<br>
antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively and several of these may<br>
be further divided into subclasses (isotypes) e.g., IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAi and IgA2.<br>
Each heavy chain type is characterized by a particular constant region. Each heavy chain<br>
is comprised of an N-terminal heavy chain variable region (herein "HCVR") and a heavy<br>
chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains<br>
(CHI, CH2, and CH3) for IgG, IgD, and IgA; and 4 domains (CHI, CH2, CH3, and CH4)<br>
for IgM and IgE.<br>
The HCVR and LCVR regions can be further subdivided into regions of<br>
hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions ("CDRs"), interspersed<br>
with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions ("FR"). Each HCVR<br>
and LCVR is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to<br>
carboxy-terminus in the following order FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.<br>
For full-length antibodies of the invention the light chains preferably comprise,<br>
downstream of FR4, a polypeptide with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 277. For<br>
full-length antibodies of the invention the heavy chains preferably comprise, downstream<br>
of FR4, a polypeptide with the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 278. Herein the 3 CDRs<br>
of the heavy chain are referred to as "CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3" and the 3 CDRs of<br>
the light chain are referred to as "CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3." The CDRs contain<br>
most of the residues which form specific interactions with the antigen. The numbering<br>
and positioning of CDR amino acid residues within the HCVR and LCVR regions is in<br>
accordance with the well-known Kabat numbering convention.<br>
The term "antibody," in reference to an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody of the<br>
invention (or simply "antibody of the invention"), as used herein, refers to a monoclonal<br>
antibody. A "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to a rodent, preferably murine<br>
antibody, a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody or a fully human antibody, unless<br>
otherwise indicated herein. Monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be produced<br>
using e.g., hybridoma techniques well known in the art, as well as recombinant<br>
technologies, phage display technologies, synthetic or recombinant technologies or<br>
combinations of such technologies readily known in the art The term "monoclonal<br>
antibody" as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma<br>
technology. "Monoclonal antibody" refers to an antibody that is derived from a single<br><br>
copy or clone, including e.g., eukaiyotic, prokaryotic, orphage clone, and not the method<br>
by which it is produced. A "monoclonal antibody" can be an intact antibody (comprising<br>
a complete or full-length Fc region), a substantially intact antibody, or a portion or<br>
fragment of an antibody comprising an antigen-binding portion, e;g., a Fab fragment,<br>
Fab' fragment or F(ab'&gt;2 fragment of a murine antibody or of a chimeric, humanized or<br>
human antibody. The "Fab" fragment contains a variable and constant domain of the light<br>
chain and a variable domain and the first constant domain (CHI) of the heavy chain.<br>
"F(abV antibody fragments comprise a pair of Fab fragments which are generally<br>
covalently linked near their carboxy termini by hinge cysteines between them. Other<br>
chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known in the art.<br>
The variable region of each light-heavy chain pair forms an antigen-binding site<br>
of the antibody. Thus, an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in<br>
bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two antigen-binging sites of the antibody are the<br>
same. As used herein, the "antigen-binding portion" or "antigen-binding region" or<br>
"antigen-binding domain" refers interchangeably to that portion of an antibody molecule<br>
which contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the<br>
antibody its specificity and affinity for the antigen. This antibody portion includes the<br>
"framework" amino acid residues necessary to maintain the proper conformation of the<br>
antigen-binding residues. Preferably, the CDRs of the antigen-binding region of the<br>
antibodies of the invention are entirely or substantially of murine origin, optionally with<br>
certain amino acid residues altered, e.g., substituted with a different amino acid residue,<br>
(see e.g., Tables 2 and 3) to optimize a particular property of the antibody, e.g., KD, KB,<br>
ICso. Preferably the framework regions of antibodies of the invention are of human origin<br>
or substantially of human origin (at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%<br>
of human origin. Preferred framework regions of antibodies of the invention have the<br>
following sequences: SEQ ID NOs: 262 (HCVR FR1X 263 (HCVR FR2), 264 (HCVR<br>
FR3), 265 (HCVR FR4), 266 (LCVR FR1), 267 (LCVR FR2), 268 (LCVR FR3), 269<br>
(LCVR FR4) and follow Kabat numbering. In other embodiments, the antigen-binding<br>
region of an IL-17 antibody of the invention can be derived from other non-human<br>
species including, but not limited to, rabbit, rat or hamster. Alternatively, the antigen-<br>
binding region can be derived from human sequence.<br><br>
Furthermore, a "monoclonal antibody" as used herein can be a single chain Fv<br>
fragment that may be produced by joining the DNA encoding a LCVR and the DNA<br>
encoding a HCVR with a linker sequence. (See, Pluckthun, The Pharmacology of<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New<br>
York, pp 269-315,1994). It is understood that regardless of whether fragments are<br>
specified, the term "antibody" as used herein includes such fragments as well as single<br>
chain forms. As long as the protein retains the ability to specifically or preferentially<br>
bind its intended target {i.e., epitope or antigen), it is included within the term "antibody."<br>
Antibodies may or may not be glycosylated and still fall within the bounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
A population of "monoclonal antibodies," refers to a homogeneous or<br>
substantially homogeneous antibody population (i.e., at least about 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%,<br>
93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, more preferably at least about 97% or 98% or most preferably at<br>
least 99% of the antibodies in the population would compete in an ELISA assay for the<br>
same antigen or epitope or more preferably the antibodies are identical in amino acid<br>
sequence. Antibodies may or may not be glycosylated and still fall within the bounds of<br>
the invention. Monoclonal antibodies may be homogeneous if they have identical amino<br>
acid sequence although they may differ in a post-translational modification, e.g.,<br>
glycosylation pattern.<br>
A 'Variant" antibody, refers herein to a molecule which differs in amino acid<br>
sequence from a "parent" antibody amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion<br>
and/or substitution of one or more amino acid residue(s) of the parent antibody sequence.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the variant antibody comprises at least one amino acid (e.g.,<br>
from one to about ten, and preferably 2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8) addition, deletion and/or<br>
substitution in the CDR regions of the parent antibody. Identity or homology with<br>
respect to the variant antibody sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid<br>
residues in the variant antibody sequence that are identical with the parent antibody<br>
residues after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the<br>
maximum percent sequence identity. The variant antibody retains the ability to bind the<br>
antigen, or preferably, the epitope, to which the parent antibody binds and preferably has<br>
at least one property or bioactivity that is superior to that of the parent antibody. For<br>
example, the variant antibody preferably has stronger binding affinity, slower off-rate,<br><br>
lower IC50 or enhanced ability to inhibit an antigen bioactivity than does the parent<br>
antibody. A variant antibody of particular interest herein is one which displays at least<br>
about 2-fold, preferably at least about S-fold, 10-fold or 20-fold enhancement in a<br>
property or bioactivity when compared to the parent antibody.<br>
The "parent" antibody herein is one which is encoded by an amino acid sequence<br>
used for the preparation of a variant antibody. The parent antibody may have framework<br>
sequence of murine origin, but preferably the framework sequence is entirely or<br>
substantially of human origin. The parent antibody may be a murine, chimeric,<br>
humanized or human antibody.<br>
The term "specifically binds" as used herein refers to the situation in which one<br>
member of a specific binding pair does not significantly bind to molecules other than its<br>
specific binding partner(s). The term is also applicable where e.g., an antigen-binding<br>
domain of an antibody of the invention is specific for a particular epitope that is carried<br>
by a number of antigens, in which case the specific antibody carrying the antigen-binding<br>
domain will be able to bind to the various antigens carrying the epitope. Accordingly a<br>
monoclonal antibody of the invention specifically binds human IL-17 (i.e., IL-17A) while<br>
it does not specifically bind human nL-17B,IL-17C,IL-17D,IL-17E,IL-17F. Further, a<br>
monoclonal antibody of the invention specifically binds human IL-17 and cynomolgus<br>
monkey IL-17 but does not specifically bind rat IL-17 or murine IL-17. Further a<br>
monoclonal antibody of the invention specifically binds a non-linear or conformational<br>
human IL-17 epitope comprising amino acids DGNDYH but does not bind a human IL-<br>
17 epitope which does not comprise amino acids DGNDYH.<br>
The term "preferentially binds" as used herein, refers to the situation in which an<br>
antibody binds a specific antigen at least about 20% greater, preferably at least about<br>
50%, 2-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold or 100-fold greater than it binds a different antigen as<br>
measured by a technique available in the art, e.g., competition ELISA or Ko measurement<br>
with a BIACORE or KINEXA assay. An antibody may preferentially bind one epitope<br>
within an antigen over a different epitope within the same antigen. Accordingly an<br>
antibody of the invention preferentially binds human IL-17 over rabbit IL-17.<br>
The term "epitope" refers to that portion of a molecule capable of being<br>
recognized by and bound by an antibody at one or more of the antibody's antigen-binding<br>
regions. Epitopes often consist of a chemically active surface grouping of molecules such<br><br>
as amino acids or sugar side chains and have specific three-dimensional structural<br>
characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. By "inhibiting epitope" and/or<br>
"neutralizing epitope" is intended an epitope, which when in the context of the intact<br>
antigenic molecule and when bound by an antibody specific to the epitope, results in loss<br>
or diminution of a biological activity of the molecule in vivo or in vitro or in an organism<br>
containing the molecule.<br>
The term "epitope," as used herein, further refers to a portion of a polypeptide<br>
having antigenic and/or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably a mammal, e.g., a<br>
mouse or a human. The term "antigenic epitope," as used herein, is defined as a portion<br>
of a polypeptide to which an antibody can specifically bind as determined by any method<br>
well known in the art, for example, by conventional immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes<br>
need not necessarily be immunogenic, buy may be immunogenic. An "immunogenic<br>
epitope," as used herein, is defined as a portion of a polypeptide that elicits an antibody<br>
response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art A "nonlinear<br>
epitope" or "conformational epitope" comprises noncontiguous polypeptides (or amino<br>
acids) within the antigenic protein to which an antibody specific to the epitope binds.<br>
The phrases "biological property" or "biological characteristic," or the terms<br>
"activity" or "bioactivity," in reference to an antibody of the present invention, are used<br>
interchangeably herein and include, but are not limited to, epitope/antigen affinity and<br>
specificity, ability to neutralize or antagonize an activity of EL-17 in vivo or in vitro, ICso,<br>
in vivo stability of the antibody and the immunogenic properties of the antibody. Other<br>
identifiable biological properties or characteristics of an antibody recognized in the art<br>
include, for example, cross-reactivity, (ie., with non-human homologs of the targeted<br>
peptidc, or with other proteins or tissues, generally), and ability to preserve high<br>
expression levels of protein in mammalian cells. The aforementioned properties or<br>
characteristics can be observed, measured or assessed using art-recognized techniques<br>
t<br>
including, but not limited to, ELISA, competitive ELISA, BIACORE or KINEXA surface<br>
plasmon resonance analysis, in vitro or in vivo neutralization assays without limit,<br>
receptor binding, cytokine or growth factor production and/or secretion, signal<br>
transduction and immunohistochemistry with tissue sections from different sources<br>
including human, primate, or any other source.<br><br>
The term "inhibit" or "neutralize" as used herein with respect to an activity of an<br>
antibody of the invention means the ability to substantially antagonize, prohibit, prevent,<br>
restrain, slow, disrupt, eliminate, stop, or reverse e.g., progression or severity of that<br>
which is being inhibited including, but not limited to, a biological activity (e.g., an IL-17<br>
activity) or property, a disease or a condition. The inhibition or neutralization of an IL-<br>
17 activity resulting from binding of an antibody of the invention with IL-17 is preferably<br>
at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or higher.<br>
The term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid or protein (e.g., an<br>
antibody) refers to a nucleic acid molecule or protein that is identified and separated from<br>
at least one contaminant with which it is ordinarily associated in its natural source.<br>
Preferably, an "isolated antibody" is an antibody that is substantially free of other<br>
antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the invention comprise an isolated antibody that specifically binds IL-17 and is<br>
substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than IL-17).<br>
The terms "Kabat numbering" and "Kabat labeling" are used interchangeably<br>
herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering<br>
amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariable) than other amino acid<br>
residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody (Kabat, et al., Ann.<br>
NYAcad. Sci. 190:382-93 (1971); Kabat, et al, Sequences of Proteins o/Immunologicat<br>
Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NEK Publication<br>
No. 91-3242 (1991)).<br>
A polynucleotide is "operably linked" to another polynucleotide when it is placed<br>
into a functional relationship with the other polynucleotide. For example, a promoter or<br>
enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the<br>
sequence. A peptide is "operably linked" to another peptide when the polynucleotides<br>
encoding them are operably linked, preferably they are in the same open reading frame.<br>
The terms "individual," "subject," and "patient," used interchangeably herein,<br>
refer to a mammal, including, but not limited to, murines, simians, humans, mammalian<br>
farm animals, mammalian sport animals, and mammalian pets; preferably the term refers<br>
to humans. In a certain embodiment, the subject, preferably a mammal, preferably a<br>
human, is further characterized with a disease or disorder or condition that would benefit<br>
from a decreased bioactivity of DL-17.<br><br>
The term "vector" includes a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting<br>
another nucleic acid to which it has been linked including, but not limited to, plasmids<br>
and viral vectors. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into<br>
which they are introduced while other vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host<br>
cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby, are replicated along with the host<br>
genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to<br>
which they are operably linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant<br>
expression vectors" (or simply "expression vectors") and exemplary vectors are well<br>
known in the art.<br>
As used herein, the expressions "cell," "host cell," "cell line," and "cell culture"<br>
are used interchangeably and include an individual cell or cell culture that is a recipient of<br>
any isolated polynucleotide of the invention or any recombinant vectors) comprising a<br>
sequence encoding a HCVR, LCVR or monoclonal antibody of the invention. Host cells<br>
include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely<br>
identical (in morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to<br>
natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or change. A host cell includes cells<br>
transformed, transduced or infected with a recombinant vector or a polynucleotide<br>
expressing a monoclonal antibody of the invention or a light chain or heavy chain thereof.<br>
A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the invention, either stably<br>
incorporated into the host chromosome or not, may also be referred to as a "recombinant<br>
host cell". Preferred host cells for use in the invention are CHO cells (e.g., ATCC CRL-<br>
9096), NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, COS cells (ATCC e.g., CRL-1650, CRL-1651) and HeLa<br>
(ATCC CCL-2). Additional host cells for use in the invention include plant cells, yeast<br>
cells, other mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells.<br>
Antibody Characterization<br>
The present invention relates to isolated, monoclonal antibodies that specifically<br>
bind human EL-17 (i.e., IL-17A) with high affinity. The antibodies of the invention are<br>
preferably chimeric, humanized or human antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof.<br>
Furthermore, antibodies of the invention neutralize or antagonize at least one EL-17<br>
biological activity in vivo and/or in vitro. Specific binding of an anti-IL-17 monoclonal<br>
antibody of the invention, (including antigen-binding portions thereof) to DL-17 allows<br><br>
said antibody to be used as a therapeutic for IL-17-associated diseases and disorders, i.e.,<br>
conditions, diseases or disorders which benefit from inhibition of an JL-17 biological<br>
activity.<br>
The antigenic IL-17 epitope to which the antibodies of the invention bind is a non-<br>
linear epitope that comprises amino acids ADGNVDYHMN (SEQ ID NO: 266), more<br>
preferably amino acids DGNVDYH (SEQ ID NO: 267) of human IL-17. Antibodies<br>
which bind said epitope, specifically and preferentially bind human IL-17 and<br>
cynomolgus monkey IL-17 as compared to their binding murine IL-17 or rat EL-17. The<br>
monoclonal antibodies of the invention bind human IL-17 at least 5, 10, 20, 30,40, 50,<br>
60, 70, 80, 90, or 100-fold greater (e.g., greater affinity or greater specificity) than with<br>
which it binds murine IL-17 or rat DL-17; more preferably at least 150, 200, 250, 300,<br>
350, 400,450, 500, 550 or 600-fold greater than with which it binds murine IL-17 or rat<br>
IL-17 even more preferably it does not bind murine IL-17 or rat EL-17 at levels greater<br>
than background levels as determined e.g., by ELISA assay, competition ELISA assay or<br>
KD values in a BIACORE or KINEXA assay.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides an anti-IL-17 monoclonal<br>
antibody that possesses a strong binding affinity for human EL-17, i.e., binds human IL-<br>
17, or a portion thereof comprising DGNVDYH (SEQ ID NO: 267) [i.e., antibody<br>
contacts the DGNVDYH polypeptide], with a binding affinity (Ko) for human IL-17 of<br>
less than about 7 pM, 6.5 pM or 6 pM, preferably less than about 5.5 pM, 5 pM or 4.5 pM<br>
and most preferably less than about 4 pM. Alternatively, the antibodies of the invention<br>
are characterized by a KD for human IL-17 of no greater than about 7 pM, 6.5 pM or 6<br>
pM, preferably no greater than about 5.5 pM, 5 pM or 4.5 pM and most preferably no<br>
greater than about 4 pM. Antibody affinities may be determined as described in the<br>
examples hereinbelow or other methods available in the art Preferably the anti-IL-17<br>
antibodies of the invention which possess a strong binding affinity as described above<br>
also bind a non-linear human IL-17 epitope (hat comprises amino acids<br>
ADGNVDYHMN (SEQ ID NO: 266), more preferably amino acids DGNVDYH (SEQ<br>
ID NO: 267), wherein the antibody makes contact with the polypeptide DGNVDYH.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention have an off rate (koff) for<br>
human IL-17 of less than 5 x 10s, 4 x 105, 3 x 105 or 2 x 10'5 s-1. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibodies of the invention characterized by possessing a strong binding<br><br>
affinity for human IL-17 as described above (KD less than about 7 pM or 6 pM,<br>
preferably less than about 5 pM or 4.5 pM and most preferably less than about 4 pM) also<br>
have an off rate (lea) for human IL-17 of less than 5 x 10"5,4 x 1O'$, 3 x 10'5 or 2 x 10'5 s'<br>
1 and even more preferably also bind a non-linear human IL-17 epitope that comprises<br>
amino acids ADGNVDYHMN (SEQ ID NO: 266), more preferably amino acids<br>
DGNVDYH (SEQ ID NO: 267) of human IL-17.<br>
In another embodiment, the antibodies of the invention have an ICso of less than<br>
lnM, 900 pM, 800 pM, 700 pM, 650 pM, 600 pM, 560 pM, 550 pM or 500 pM in e.g., an<br>
in vitro IL-8 reporter assay or less than about 560 pM in a GROa reporter assay (see<br>
Example 6). In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are characterized<br>
by possessing a strong binding affinity for human IL-17 as described above (KD less than<br>
about 7 pM or 6 pM, preferably less than about 5 pM or 4.5 pM and most preferably less<br>
than about 4 pM) and also have an ICS0 of less than lnM, 900 pM, 800 pM, 700 pM, 650<br>
pM, 600 pM, 560 pM, 550 pM or 500 pM in e.g., an in vitro IL-8 reporter assay or less<br>
than about 560 pM in a GROa reporter assay and even more preferably also have an off<br>
rate (lea) for human IL-17 of less than 5 x 10"5,4 x 10'5,3 x 10s or 2 x 10"s s'1 and even<br>
more preferably also bind a non-linear human IL-17 epitope that comprises amino acids<br>
DGNVDYH (SEQ ID NO: 267) of human IL-17 wherein the antibody contacts the<br>
DGNVDYH polypeptide.<br>
The most preferred embodiment of the invention is an anti-IL-17 antibody<br>
comprising a light chain amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 279 and a heavy<br>
chain amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 280. Preferably this antibody<br>
comprises two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains. Preferably the light<br>
chain with amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 279 is encoded by a nucleic<br>
acid comprising the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 281 (including signal sequence) or<br>
SEQ ID NO: 283 (without the signal sequence). Preferably the heavy chain with amino<br>
acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 280 is encoded by a nucleic acid comprising the<br>
sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 282 (including the signal sequence) or SEQ ID NO: 284<br>
(without the signal sequence).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies ("mAbs") may be made using the hybridoma method<br>
widely known in the art (see e.g., Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495, 1975) or may be made<br>
by recombinant DNA methods (e.g., as in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). Generally, a<br><br>
hybridoma can be produced by fusing a suitable immortal cell line (e.g., a myeloma cell<br>
line such as SP2/0) with antibody producing cells of the immunized animal. The<br>
antibody producing cell, preferably those of the spleen or lymph nodes, are obtained from<br>
animals immunized with the antigen of interest. The fused cells (hybridomas) can be<br>
isolated using selective culture conditions, and cloned by limiting dilution. Culture<br>
medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal<br>
antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of mAbs<br>
produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro<br>
binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay or ELISA. Cells which produce antibodies<br>
with the desired binding properties can be selected by a suitable assay. Methods for such<br>
isolation and screening are well known in the art.<br>
Other suitable methods of producing or isolating antibodies of the invention,<br>
including human or artificial antibodies, can be used, including, for example, methods<br>
which select a recombinant antibody (e.g., single chain Fv or Fab) from a library, or<br>
which rely upon immunization of transgenic animals (e.g., mice) capable of producing a<br>
repertoire of human antibodies (see e.g., Jakobovits etal, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
90:2551-2555,1993; Jakobovits etal, Nature, 362:255-258, 1993; U.S. Patent Numbers<br>
5,545,806 and 5,545,807).<br>
Single chain antibodies, and chimeric, humanized or primatized (CDR-grafted)<br>
antibodies, as well as chimeric or CDR-grafted single chain antibodies, and the like,<br>
comprising portions derived from different species, are also encompassed by the present<br>
invention and the term "antibody". The various portions of these antibodies can be joined<br>
together chemically by conventional techniques, synthetically, or can be prepared as a<br>
contiguous protein using genetic engineering techniques. For example, nucleic acids<br>
encoding a chimeric or humanized chain can be expressed to produce a contiguous<br>
protein. See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; European Patent No. 125,023 Bl; U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,816,397; European Patent No. 120,694 Bl; WO 86/01533; European Patent<br>
No. 194,276 Bl; U.S. Patent No. 5,225,539; European Patent No. 239,400 Bl and U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,585,089 and 5,698,762.<br>
In addition, functional fragments of antibodies (i.e., antigen-binding fragments),<br>
including fragments of chimeric, humanized, primatized or single chain antibodies, can<br>
also be produced and fall within the scope of the invention. Preferred functional<br><br>
fragments retain an antigen-binding function of a corresponding full-length antibody.<br>
Particularly preferred functional fragments retain the ability to inhibit one or more<br>
functions or bioactivities characteristic of a mammalian mature EL-17, preferably human<br>
IL-17, such as a binding activity, a signaling activity, and/or stimulation or inhibition of a<br>
cellular response. For example, in one embodiment, a functional fragment can inhibit the<br>
interaction of mature IL-17 with its receptor and/or can inhibit one or more receptor-<br>
mediated functions.<br>
Antibody portions capable of binding to human IL-17 include, but are not limited<br>
to, Fv, Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments and are encompassed by the invention. Such<br>
fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage or by recombinant techniques. For<br>
instance, papain or pepsin cleavage of an intact antibody can generate Fab or F(ab')2<br>
fragments, respectively. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-<br>
binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site. The<br>
Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant<br>
domain (CHI) of the heavy chain. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab)2 fragment that has<br>
two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.<br>
"Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-<br>
recognition and -binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one<br>
light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration<br>
that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on<br>
the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding<br>
specificity to the antibody. To overcome the tendency of non-covalently linked HCVR<br>
and LCVR domains in the Fv to dissociate when co-expressed in a host cell, a single<br>
chain Fv fragment (scFv) can be constructed in which a flexible and adequately long<br>
polypeptide links either the C-terminus of the HCVR to the N-terminus of the LCVR or<br>
the C-terminus of the LCVR to the N-terminus of the HCVR, A commonly used linker is<br>
a 15-residue (Gly4Ser)3 peptide. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in The<br>
Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-<br>
Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). Antibodies can also be produced in a variety of<br>
truncated forms using antibody genes in which one or more stop codons has been<br>
introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a<br><br>
F(ab*)2 heavy chain portion can be designed to include DNA sequences encoding the CH1<br>
domain and hinge region of the heavy chain.<br>
Selection of antibody fragments from libraries using enrichment technologies such<br>
as phage-display (Matthews DJ and Wells JA. Science. 260:1113-7,1993), ribosome<br>
display (Hanes, et al., Proa Natl. Acad. Sci., (USA) 95:14130-5,1998), bacterial display<br>
(Samuelson P., et al., Journal of Biotechnology. 96:129-54,2002) or yeast display (Kieke<br>
M.C., et al., Protein Engineering, 10:1303-10,1997) have proven to be successful<br>
alternatives to classical hybridoma technology (Review: Little M. et a]., Immunology<br>
Today, 21:364-70,2000).<br>
Variant Antibodies<br>
A murine monoclonal antibody or a human antibody (produced e.g., in a<br>
transgenic mouse) raised against IL-17 may be a parent antibody. A parent antibody may<br>
be further altered to create a chimeric or humanized form of the antibody or other variant<br>
form of the antibody using methods available in the art, e.g., PCR mutagenesis. Such<br>
chimeric, humanized, or otherwise variant antibodies, may serve as parent antibodies for<br>
further variation or mutagenesis. Parent antibodies of the invention may be mutagenized,<br>
e.g., within the CDR domain(s) (see, e.g., Tables 2 and 3) to create variant antibodies that<br>
may be screened for presence of a property of interest, e.g., binding affinity (lower KD),<br>
IC50, specificity, preferential binding, etc. Preferably the property of interest in the<br>
variant antibody is an improvement over that property in the parent antibody. An amino<br>
acid substitution variant antibody is preferred and has at least 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10<br>
amino acid residues) of the parent antibody molecule removed and a different residue<br>
inserted in its place. The site of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis is one or<br>
more CDR regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative amino acid<br>
substitutions are preferred; although, for more substantial changes, non-conservative<br>
amino acid changes may be introduced and the resulting antibodies screened for the<br>
property of interest.<br>
A convenient way for generating substitution variants of a parent antibody is<br>
affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, a polynucleotide molecule encoding a<br>
parent antibody is mutated within one or more CDR regions to generate all possible<br>
amino acid substitutions at each amino acid residue at which a substitution is desired.<br><br>
The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from<br>
filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within<br>
each particle. The phage-displayed variant antibodies are then screened for their<br>
biological activity (e.g., binding affinity, specificity, IC50)- In order to identify candidate<br>
CDR region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagens can be performed to<br>
identify CDR region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of<br>
the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and IL-17.<br>
Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according<br>
to the techniques elaborated herein or known in the art Alternatively, or in addition,<br>
random mutagenesis or point mutagenesis may be performed, on one or more<br>
polynucleotide molecules encoding at least one CDR. The mutagenesis may be<br>
performed, at one or more positions, either while the CDR is operably linked to the<br>
framework region within the variable region or while the CDR is independent of other<br>
variable region sequence and then the altered CDR returned to the variable region using<br>
recombinant DNA technology. Once such variant antibodies are generated the panel of<br>
variants is subjected to screening for a property or activity of interest and antibodies with<br>
superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further<br>
development.<br>
Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of an<br>
anti-IL-17 antibody of the invention may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve<br>
the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely,<br>
cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where<br>
the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).<br>
Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original<br>
glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more<br>
carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation<br>
sites that are not present in the parent antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically<br>
either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety<br>
to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine<br>
and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the<br>
recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the<br><br>
asparagines side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a<br>
polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the<br>
attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a<br>
hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-<br>
hydroxylysine may also be used.<br>
Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by<br>
altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described<br>
tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made<br>
by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the<br>
sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).<br>

The composition comprising a CDR of the invention will generally be an antibody<br>

In a humanized antibody for therapeutic use in humans, the framework sequence<br>

In one embodiment, an anti-IL-17 antibody of the invention, wherein all or a<br>

Antibody Expression<br>
The present invention is also directed to cell lines that express an anti-IL-17<br>
monoclonal antibody of the invention or portion thereof. Creation and isolation of cell<br>
lines producing a monoclonal antibody of the invention can be accomplished using<br>
standard techniques known in the art Preferred cell lines include COS, CHO, SP2/0,<br>
NSO and yeast (available from public repositories such as ATCC, American Type Culture<br>
Collection, Manassas, VA).<br>
A wide variety of host expression systems can be used to express an antibody of<br>
the present invention including prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems (such as<br>
yeast, baculovirus, plant, mammalian and other animal cells, transgenic animals, and<br>
hybridoma cells), as well as phage display expression systems. An example of a suitable<br>
bacterial expression vector is pUC119 and a suitable eukaryotic expression vector is a<br>
modified pcDNA3.1 vector with a weakened dhfr selection system. Other antibody<br>
expression systems are also known in the art and are contemplated herein.<br>
An antibody of the invention can be prepared by recombinant expression of<br>
immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes in a host cell. To express an antibody<br>
recombinantly, a host cell is transformed, transduced, infected or the like with one or<br>
more recombinant expression vectors carrying DNA fragments encoding the<br>
immunoglobulin light and/or heavy chains of the antibody such that the light and/or<br><br>
heavy chains are expressed in the host cell. The heavy chain and the light chain may be<br>
expressed independently from different promoters to which they are operably linked in<br>
one vector or, alternatively, the heavy chain and the light chain may be expressed<br>
independently from different promoters to which they are operably linked in two vectors<br>
- one expressing the heavy chain and one expressing the light chain. Optionally the<br>
heavy chain and light chain may be expressed in different host cells. Preferably, the<br>
recombinant antibodies are secreted into the medium in which the host cells are cultured,<br>
from which the antibodies can be recovered or purified. Standard recombinant DNA<br>
methodologies are used to obtain antibody heavy and light chain genes, incorporate these<br>
genes into recombinant expression vectors, and introduce the vectors into host cells.<br>
Such standard recombinant DNA technologies are described, for example, in Sambrook,<br>
Fritsch, and Maniatis (Eds.), Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989; Ausubel, et al (Eds.) Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology, Greene Publishing Associates, 1989.<br>
An isolated DNA encoding a HCVR region can be converted to a full-length<br>
heavy chain gene by operably linking the HCVR-encoding DNA to another DNA<br>
molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions (CH1, CH2, and CH3). The sequences<br>
of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art. See, e.g., Kabat, et al.,<br>
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of<br>
Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242 (1991). DNA fragments<br>
encompassing these regions can be obtained e.g., by standard PCR amplification. The<br>
heavy chain constant region can be of any type, (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD), class<br>
(e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG-0 or subclass constant region and any allotypic variant<br>
thereof as described in Kabat (supra). Alternatively, the antigen binding portion can be a<br>
Fab fragment, Fab' fragment, F(ab')2 fragment, Fd, or a single chain Fv fragment (scFv).<br>
For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the HCVR-encoding DNA may be operably linked<br>
to another DNA molecule encoding only a heavy chain CH1 constant region.<br>
An isolated DNA encoding a LCVR region may be converted to a full-length light<br>
chain gene (as well as to a Fab light chain gene) by operably linking the LCVR-encoding<br>
DNA to another DNA molecule encoding a light chain constant region, CL. The<br>
sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art See, e.g.,<br>
Kabat, supra. DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard<br><br>
PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant<br>
region.<br>
To create an scFv gene, the HCVR- and LCVR-encoding DNA fragments are<br>
operably linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino<br>
acid sequence (Gly4-Ser)3, such that the HCVR and LCVR sequences can be expressed as<br>
a contiguous single-chain protein, with the LCVR and HCVR regions joined by the<br>
flexible linker. See, e.g.. Bird, et ah, Science 242:423-6,1988; Huston, et al, Proc Nail.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83,1988; McCafferty, etal., Nature 348:552-4,1990.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a vector, preferably (but not limited<br>
to) a plasmid, a recombinant expression vector, a yeast expression vector, or a retroviral<br>
expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding an anti-IL-17 monoclonal<br>
antibody of the invention. Alternatively, a vector of the invention comprises a<br>
polynucleotide encoding an LCVR and/or a polynucleotide encoding an HCVR of the<br>
invention. When both an LCVR and an HCVR encoding sequence are present in the<br>
same vector, they may be transcribed independently, each from a separate promoter to<br>
which it is operably linked. If the sequences encoding the LCVR and HCVR are present<br>
in the same vector and transcribed from one promoter to which they are both operably<br>
linked, the LCVR may be 5' to the HCVR or the LCVR may be 3' to the HCVR,<br>
furthermore, the LCVR and HCVR coding region in the vector may be separated by a<br>
linker sequence of any size or content, preferably such linker, when present, is a<br>
polynucleotide encoding an internal ribosome entry site.<br>
To express an antibody of the invention, a DNA encoding a partial or full-length<br>
light and/or heavy chain, obtained as described above, are inserted into an expression<br>
vector such that the gene is operably linked to transcriptional and translational control<br>
sequences. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be<br>
compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the<br>
antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vectors or, more typically, both<br>
genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into<br>
the expression vector by standard methods. Additionally, the recombinant expression<br>
vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the anti-IL-17 monoclonal<br>
antibody light and/or heavy chain from a host cell. The anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody<br>
light and/or heavy chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is<br><br>
operably linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal<br>
peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or aheterologous signal peptide.<br>
In addition to the antibody heavy and/or light chain gene(s), a recombinant<br>
expression vector of the invention carries regulatory sequences that control the expression<br>
of the antibody chain gene(s) in a host cell. The term "regulatory sequence" is intended<br>
to include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (eg.,<br>
polyadenylation signals), as needed, that control the transcription or translation of the<br>
antibody chain gene(s). The design of the expression vector, including the selection of<br>
regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be<br>
transformed, the level of expression of protein desired. Preferred regulatory sequences<br>
for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of<br>
protein expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from<br>
cytomegalovirus (CMV), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, (e.g., the adenovirus<br>
major late promoter (AdMLP)) and polyoma virus.<br>
In addition to the antibody heavy and/or light chain genes and regulatory<br>
sequences, the recombinant expression vectors of the invention may carry additional<br>
sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g.,<br>
origins of replication) and one or more selectable marker genes. The selectable marker<br>
gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced. For<br>
example, typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418,<br>
hygromycin, or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced.<br>
Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene (for use<br>
in dhfr-minus host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification), the neo gene (for<br>
G418 selection), and glutamine synthetase (GS) in a GS-negative cell line (such as NSO)<br>
for selection/amplification.<br>
For expression of the light and/or heavy chains, the expression vectors) encoding<br>
the heavy and/or light chains is introduced into a host cell by standard techniques e.g.,<br>
electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection,<br>
transduction, infection and the like. Although it is theoretically possible to express the<br>
antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, eukaryotic cells<br>
are preferred, and most preferably mammalian host cells, because such cells are more<br>
likely to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody.<br><br>
Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the<br>
invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) [including dhfr minus CHO cells,<br>
described in Urlaub and Chasin, Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-20,1980, used with<br>
a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp, J. Mol. Biol.<br>
159:601-21,1982] NSO myeloma cells, COS cells, and SP2/O cells. When recombinant<br>
expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells,<br>
the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to<br>
allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the<br>
antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown under appropriate<br>
conditions known in the art. Antibodies can be recovered from the host cell and/or the<br>
culture medium using standard purification methods.<br>
Host cells can also be used to produce portions, or fragments, of intact antibodies,<br>
eg., Fab fragments or scFv molecules by techniques that are conventional. It will be<br>
understood by a skilled artisan that variations on the above procedure are within the scope<br>
of the present invention. For example, it may be desirable to transfect a host cell with<br>
DNA encoding either the light chain or the heavy chain of an antibody of this invention.<br>
Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some or all the DNA<br>
encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding to<br>
IL-17. The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are also<br>
encompassed by the antibodies of the invention.<br>
The invention provides a host cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule of the<br>
present invention. Preferably a host cell of the invention comprises one or more vectors<br>
or constructs comprising a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention. The host cell<br>
of the invention is a cell into which a vector of the invention has been introduced, said<br>
vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a LCVR of an antibody of the invention<br>
and/or a polynucleotide encoding a HCVR of the invention. The invention also provides<br>
a host cell into which two vectors of the invention have been introduced; one comprising<br>
a polynucleotide encoding a LCVR of an antibody of the invention and one comprising a<br>
polynucleotide encoding a HCVR present in an antibody of the invention and each<br>
operably linked to a promoter sequence. The host cell types include mammalian,<br>
bacterial, plant and yeast cells. Preferably the host cell is a CHO cell, a COS cell, a<br>
SP2/0 cell, a NSO cell, a yeast cell or a derivative or progeny of any preferred cell type.<br><br>
In a preferred system for recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention,<br>
a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the<br>
antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr-minus CHO cells by e.g., calcium phosphate-<br>
mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and<br>
light chain genes are each operably linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements<br>
(e.g., derived from SV40, CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV<br>
enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter<br>
regulatory element) to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant<br>
expression vector also carries a dhfr gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that<br>
have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The<br>
selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy<br>
and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard<br>
molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector,<br>
transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the<br>
antibody from the culture medium. Antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, of<br>
the invention can be expressed in an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human<br>
immunoglobulin genes (see, e.g., Taylor, et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 20:6287-95, 1992).<br>
Once expressed, the intact antibodies, their dimers, individual light and heavy<br>
chains, or other immunoglobulin forms of the present invention can be purified according<br>
to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion<br>
exchange, affinity, reverse phase, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, gel<br>
electrophoresis and the like. Substantially pure immunoglobulins of at least about 90%,<br>
92%, 94% or 96% homogeneity are preferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity most<br>
preferred, for pharmaceutical uses. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired,<br>
the peptides may then be used therapeutically or prophylactically, as directed herein.<br>
Chimeric antibody<br>
As used herein, the term "chimeric antibody" includes monovalent, divalent or<br>
polyvalent immunoglobulins. A monovalent chimeric antibody is a dimer formed by a<br>
chimeric heavy chain associated through disulfide bridges with a chimeric light chain. A<br>
divalent chimeric antibody is a tetramer formed by two heavy chain-light chain dimers<br>
associated through at least one disulfide bridge.<br><br>
A chimeric heavy chain of an antibody comprises an antigen-binding region<br>
derived from the heavy chain of a non-human antibody specific for IL-17, which is<br>
operably linked to at least a portion of a human, or substantially human (or species<br>
different from that from which the antigen-binding region was derived), heavy chain<br>
constant region such as CH1 or CH2, or preferably to a full-length heavy chain constant<br>
region. A chimeric light chain of an antibody for use in humans comprises an antigen-<br>
binding region derived entirely or substantially from the light chain of a non-human<br>
antibody specific for IL-17, operably linked to at least a portion of a human, or<br>
substantially human (or species different from that from which the antigen-binding region<br>
was derived), light chain constant region (CL), or preferably to a full-length light chain<br>
constant region. Antibodies, fragments or derivatives having chimeric heavy chains and<br>
light chains of the same or different variable region binding specificity, can also be<br>
prepared by appropriate association of the individual polypeptide chains, according to<br>
known method steps.<br>
With this approach, hosts expressing chimeric heavy chains are separately<br>
cultured from hosts expressing chimeric light chains, and the immunoglobulin chains are<br>
separately recovered and then associated. Alternatively, the hosts can be co-cultured and<br>
the chains allowed to associate spontaneously in the culture medium, followed by<br>
recovery of the assembled immunoglobulin or fragment. Methods for producing chimeric<br>
antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,284,471; 5,807,715;<br>
4,816,567; and 4,816,397).<br>
Humanized antibodies<br>
Preferably an antibody of the invention to be used for therapeutic purposes, would<br>
have the sequence of the framework and constant region (to the extent it exists in the<br>
antibody) derived from the mammal in which it would be used as a therapeutic so as to<br>
decrease the possibility mat the mammal would illicit an immune response against the<br>
therapeutic antibody. Humanized antibodies are of particular interest since they are<br>
considered to be valuable for therapeutic application and avoid the human anti-mouse<br>
antibody response frequently observed with rodent antibodies. Additionally, in<br>
humanized antibodies the effector portion of the antibody is of human origin so it may<br>
interact better with the other parts of the human immune system (e.g., destroy the target<br><br>
cells more efficiently by complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent<br>
cellular cytotoxicity). Also, injected humanized antibodies may have a half-life more<br>
like that of naturally occurring human antibodies than do e.g., murine antibodies, thereby<br>
allowing smaller and less frequent doses to be given. The term "humanized antibody" as<br>
used herein refers to an antibody comprising portions of antibodies of different origin,<br>
wherein at least one portion is of human origin. For example, the humanized antibody<br>
can comprise portions derived from an antibody of nonhuman origin with the requisite<br>
specificity, such as a mouse, and from an antibody of human origin, joined together<br>
chemically by conventional techniques (e.g., synthetic) or prepared as a contiguous<br>
polypeptide using genetic engineering techniques.<br>
Preferably, a "humanized antibody" has CDRs that originate (or substantially<br>
originate) from a non-human antibody (preferably a mouse monoclonal antibody) while<br>
framework and constant region, to the extent it is present, (or a significant or substantial<br>
portion thereof, i.e., at least about 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%) are<br>
encoded by nucleic acid sequence information that occurs in the human germline<br>
immunoglobulin region (see, e.g., the International ImMunoGeneTics Database) or in<br>
recombined or mutated forms thereof whether or not said antibodies are produced in<br>
human cell.<br>
The CDRs of a humanized antibody may be altered or optimized from the CDRs<br>
of a non-human parent antibody from which they originated to generate desired<br>
properties, e.g., specificity, affinity and/or preferential binding. Altered or optimized<br>
CDRs may have amino acid substitutions, additions and/or deletions when compared to a<br>
parent CDRs, preferably about 1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7, 8,9 or 10 total within the six CDR<br>
domains. For example, the amino acid positions of CDRs that are underlined and in bold<br>
print in Tables 2 and 3 are positions which have been altered from the CDRs as shown in<br>
Fab 1 of Tables 2 and 3. Alternatively murine antibody 2321 may be a parent antibody<br>
for comparison of CDRs of an antibody of the invention.<br>
Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies include an intact<br>
antibody, a substantially intact antibody, a portion of an antibody comprising an antigen-<br>
binding site, or a portion of an antibody comprising a Fab fragment, Fab' fragment,<br>
F(ab')2, or a single chain Fv fragment Humanized antibodies preferably contain minimal<br>
sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies may also<br><br>
comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported<br>
CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise<br>
substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or<br>
substantially all of the amino acids in the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-<br>
human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the amino acids in the FR regions<br>
are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody<br>
optimally also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc),<br>
typically that of a human immunoglobulin. [Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525,1986;<br>
Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-329,1988; and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol, 2:593-<br>
596, 1992.]<br>
Humanized antibodies may be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis using methods of<br>
routine use in the art (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in<br>
vivo somatic mutagenesis) and, thus, the framework region amino acid sequences of the<br>
HCVR and LCVR regions of the humanized recombinant antibodies are sequences that,<br>
while derived from those related to human germline HCVR and LCVR sequences, may<br>
not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. It is<br>
contemplated that such amino acid sequences of the HCVR and LCVR framework<br>
regions of the humanized recombinant antibodies are at least 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%, 96%,<br>
98% or most preferably at least 99% identical to a human germline sequence. Preferably,<br>
those framework residues of the parent antibody (e.g., murine antibody or generally the<br>
antibody from which the humanized antibody is derived) which maintain or affect<br>
combining-site structures will be retained. These residues may be identified e.g., by X-<br>
ray crystallography of the parent antibody or Fab fragment, thereby identifying the three-<br>
dimensional structure of the antigen-binding site. One strategy to humanize antibodies is<br>
to choose a human germline sequence with the greatest homology to the framework of the<br>
parent antibody as the framework to receive the donor CDRs. This germline approach is<br>
based on the same rationale as the best-fit strategy, but only germline sequences are<br>
searched in the databases.<br>
The humanized antibody of the present invention may comprise or be derived<br>
from a human germline light chain framework. In particular embodiments, the light chain<br>
germline sequence is selected from human VK sequences including, but not limited to,<br>
Al, A10, All, A14, A17, A18, A19, A2, A20, A23, A26, A27, A3, A30, A5, A7, B2, B3,<br><br>

L6, L8, L9, 01, O11, 012,014,018,02,04, and 08. In certain embodiments, this light<br>
chain human germline framework is selected from V1-11, V1-13, V1-16, V1-17, V1-18,<br>
V1-19, V1-2, V1-20, V1-22, VI-3, V1-4, V1-5, V1-7, V1-9, V2-1, V2-11, V2-13, V2-14,<br>

V4-6, V5-1, V5-2, V5-4, and V5-6.<br>
In other embodiments, the humanized antibody of the present invention may<br>
comprise or be derived from a human germline heavy chain framework. In particular<br>
embodiments, this heavy chain human germline framework is selected from VH1-18,<br>
VH1-2, VH1-24, VH1-3, VH1-45, VH1-46, VH1-58, VH1-69, VH1-8, VH2-26, VH2-5,<br>

VH3-7, VH3-72, VH3-73, VH3-74, VH3-9, VH4-28, VH4-31, VH4-34, VH4-39, VH4-4,<br>
VH4-59, VH4-61, VH5-51, VH6-1, and VH7-81. See PCT WO 2005/005604 for a<br>
description of the different germline sequences.<br>
In particular embodiments, the light chain variable region and/or heavy chain<br>
variable region comprises a framework region or at least a portion of a framework region<br>
(e.g., containing 2 or 3 subregions, such as FR2 and FR3). In certain embodiments, at<br>
least FRL1, FRL2, FRL3, or FRL4 is fully human. In other embodiments, at least FRH1,<br>
FRH2, FRH3, or FRH4 is fully human. In some embodiments, at least FRL1, FRL2,<br>
FRL3, or FRL4 is a germline sequence (e.g., human germline) or comprises human<br>
consensus sequences for the particular framework. In other embodiments, at least FRH1,<br>
FRH2, FRH3, or FRH4 is a germline sequence (e.g., human germline) or comprises<br>
human consensus sequences for the particular framework. In preferred embodiments, all<br>
of the framework region is human framework region.<br>
In general, humanized antibodies may be produced by obtaining nucleic acid<br>
sequences encoding the HCVR and LCVR of an antibody, e.g., a murine antibody or<br>
antibody made by a hybridoma, which binds a IL-17 epitope of the invention, identifying<br>
the CDRs in said HCVR and LCVR (nonhuman), and grafting such CDR-encoding<br>
nucleic acid sequences onto selected human framework-encoding nucleic acid sequences.<br>
Optionally, a CDR region may be optimized by mutagenizing randomnly or at particular<br>
locations in order to substitute one or more amino acids in the CDR with a different<br><br>
amino acid prior to grafting the CDR region into the framework region. Alternatively, a<br>
CDR region may be optimized subsequent to insertion into the human framework region<br>
using methods available to one of skill in the art Preferably, the human framework amino<br>
acid sequences are selected such that the resulting antibody is likely to be suitable for in<br>
vivo administration in humans. This can be determined, e.g.. based on previous usage of<br>
antibodies containing such human framework sequence. Preferably, the human<br>
framework sequence will not itself be significantly immunogenic.<br>
Alternatively, the amino acid sequences of the frameworks for the antibody to be<br>
humanized may be compared to those of known human framework sequences the human<br>
framework sequences to be used for CDR-grafting and selected based on their comprising<br>
sequences highly similar to those of the parent antibody, e.g., a tnurine antibody which<br>
binds IL-17 (e.g., an antibody comprising a HCVR with SEQ ID NO: 270 and further<br>
comprising a LCVR with SEQ ID NO: 271). Numerous human framework sequences<br>
have been isolated and their sequences reported in the art. This enhances the likelihood<br>
that the resultant CDR-grafted humanized antibody, which contains CDRs of the parent<br>
(e.g., murine) or optimized CDRs of the parent antibody grafted onto selected human<br>
frameworks (and possibly also the human constant region) will substantially retain the<br>
antigen binding structure and thus retain the binding affinity of the parent antibody. To<br>
retain a significant degree of antigen binding affinity, the selected human framework<br>
regions will preferably be those that are expected to be suitable for in vivo administration,<br>
i.e., not immunogenic.<br>
In either method, the DNA sequence encoding the HCVR and LCVR regions of<br>
the preferably murine anti-IL-17 antibody are obtained. Methods for cloning nucleic acid<br>
sequences encoding immunoglobulins are known in the art. Such methods may, for<br>
example, involve the amplification of the immunoglobulin-encoding sequences to be<br>
cloned using appropriate primers by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers suitable<br>
for amplifying immunoglobulin nucleic acid sequences, and specifically murine HCVR<br>
and LCVR sequences have been reported in the literature. After such immunoglobulin-<br>
encoding sequences have been cloned, they will be sequences by methods well known in -<br>
the art<br>
After the CDR-encoding sequences are grafted onto the selected human<br>
framework encoding sequences, the resultant DNA sequences encoding the "humanized"<br><br>
variable heavy and variable light sequences are then expressed to produce a humanized<br>
Fv or humanized antibody that binds IL-17. The humanized HCVR and LCVR may be<br>
expressed as part of a whole anti-IL-17 antibody molecule, ie., as a fusion protein with<br>
human constant domain sequences whose encoding DNA sequences have been obtained<br>
from a commercially available library or which have been obtained using, e.g., one of the<br>
above described methods for obtaining DNA sequences, or are in the art However, the<br>
HCVR and LCVR sequences can also be expressed in the absence of constant sequences<br>
to produce a humanized anti-IL-17 Fv. Nevertheless, fusion of human constant<br>
sequences onto the variable region is potentially desirable because the resultant<br>
humanized anti-IL- 17antibody may possess human effector functions.<br>
Methods for synthesizing DNA encoding a protein of known sequence are well<br>
known in the art. Using such methods, DNA sequences which encode the subject<br>
humanized HCVR and LCVR sequences (with or without constant regions) are<br>
synthesized, and then expressed in a vector system suitable for expression of recombinant<br>
antibodies. This may be effected in any vector system which provides for the subject<br>
humanized HCVR and LCVR sequences to be expressed as a fusion protein with human<br>
constant domain sequences and to associate to produce functional (antigen binding)<br>
antibodies or antibody fragments.<br>
Human constant domain sequences are known in the art, and have been reported<br>
in the literature. Preferred human constant light chain sequences include the kappa and<br>
lambda constant light chain sequences. Preferred human constant heavy chain sequences<br>
include human IgG1, human IgG2, human IgG3, human IgC4 (see, e.g., Seq ID NOs: 257-<br>
260 respectively) and mutated versions thereof which provide for altered effector<br>
function, e.g., enhanced in vivo half-life, reduced Fc receptor binding, altered<br>
deamidation profile and the like.<br>
If present, human framework regions are preferably derived from a human<br>
antibody variable region having sequence similarity to the analogous or equivalent region<br>
of the antigen binding region donor (i.e., the parent antibody). Other sources of<br>
framework regions for portions of human origin of a humanized antibody include human<br>
variable consensus sequences (see e.g., Kettleborough, C.A. et el. Protein Engineering<br>
4:773-783 (1991); Carter et al.. WO 94/04679. For example, the sequence of the<br>
antibody or variable region used to obtain the nonhuman portion can be compared to<br><br>
human sequences as described in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological<br>
Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH, U.S. Government Printing Office (1991). In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, the framework regions of a humanized antibody chain are derived<br>
from a human variable region having at least about 60% overall sequence identity,<br>
preferably at least about 70%, 80%, or 90% overall sequence identity and more<br>
preferably at least about 85% overall sequence identity, with the variable region of the<br>
nonhuman donor. A human portion can also be derived from a human antibody having at<br>
least about 65% sequence identity, and preferably at least about 70% sequence identity,<br>
within the particular portion (e.g., FR) being used, when compared to the equivalent<br>
portion (e.g., FR) of the nonhuman donor.<br>

that may be used are e.g., Queen et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 88:2869, 1991; U.S.<br>

ABMOD and ENCAD as described in Levitt, M., J. Mol. Biol. 168:595-620,1983;<br>
humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-<br>
workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525, 1986; Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327,<br>
1988; Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536,1988).<br>
Human Antibodies<br>
As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. Human<br>
antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage<br>
display libraries (Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol, 227:381, 1991; Marks et al., J.<br>
Mol Biol., 222:581,1991). The techniques of Cole et al. and Boemer et al. are also<br>
available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985) and Boemer et al., /.<br>
Immunol, 147:86-95,1991). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing<br>
human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous<br>
immunoglobulin genes have been partially or complete inactivated. Upon immunization,<br>
e.g., with an antigen comprising an irnmunogenic ephope of the invention, a full<br>
repertoire of human antibody production is obtained, which closely resembles that seen in<br>
humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly and antibody repertoire.<br>

Human immunoglobulin genes introduced into the mouse, thus creating transgenic<br>
mice capable of responding to antigens with antibodies having human sequences are also<br>
described in Bruggemann et al. (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 86:6709-6713, 1989). There<br>
are several strategies that exist for the generation of mammals that produce human<br>
antibodies. In particular, there is the "minilocus" approach in which an exogenous Ig<br>
locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (e.g., individual genes) from the Ig<br>
locus (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. NOs. 5,545,807,5,545,806,5,625,825,5,625,126,5,633,425,<br>
5,661,016,5,770,429,5,789,650, and 5,814,318,5,612,205, 5,721,367, 5,789,215), YAC<br>
introduction of large and substantially germline fragments of the Ig loci (See Mendez et<br>
al. Nature Genetics 15:146-156,1997; Green and Jakobovits J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495,<br>
1998), and introduction of entire or substantially entire loci through the use of microcell<br>
fusion (see European Patent Application No. EP 0 843 961 A1).<br>
Any transgenic mouse capable of responding to immunization with antibodies<br>
having human sequences may be used to produce an anti-IL-17 antibody of the invention<br>
when using methods available to one skilled in the art, e.g., when such mouse is<br>
immunized with a polypeptide comprising an immunogenic epitope of the invention.<br>
Uses<br>
Antibodies of the present invention are useful in therapeutic, prophylactic,<br>
diagnostic and research applications as described herein. An antibody of the invention<br>
may be used to diagnose a disorder or disease associated with the expression of human<br>
IL-17. In a similar manner, the antibody of the invention can be used in an assay to<br>
monitor IL-17 levels in a subject being tested for an IL-17-associated condition.<br>
Research applications include methods that utilize the antibody of the invention and a<br>
label to detect IL-17 in a sample, e.g., in a human body fluid or in a cell or tissue extract.<br>
Antibodies of the invention may by used with or without modification, and are labeled by<br><br>
covalent or non-covalent attachment of a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can<br>
be any one that is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal.<br>
For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope such as, e.g., 3H 14C, 32P, 35S,<br>
or l23I, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate,<br>
rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase,<br>
or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for separately conjugating the<br>
antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described<br>
by Hunter, et al., Nature 144:945,1962; David, et al., Biochemistry 13:1014,1974; Pain,<br>
et al., J. Immunol Meth. 40:219,1981; and Nygren, J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 30:<br>
407, 1982.<br>
A variety of conventional protocols for measuring IL-17, including e.g., ELISAs,<br>
RIAs, and FACS, are known in the art and provide a basis for diagnosing altered or<br>
abnormal levels of IL-17 expression. Normal or standard expression values are<br>
established using any art known technique, eg., by combining a sample comprising a IL-<br>
17 polypeptide with, e.g., antibodies under conditions suitable to form a antigen:antibody<br>
complex. The antibody is directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to<br>
facilitate detection of the bound or unbound antibody. Suitable detectable substances<br>
include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials<br>
and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase,<br>
alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable<br>
prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of<br>
suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein<br>
isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or<br>
phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; and examples of a<br>
radioactive material include l2SL l31I,35S, or 3H. (See, eg., Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies:<br>
A Manual of Techniques, CRC Press, Inc. (1987)).The amount of a standard complex<br>
formed is quantitated by various methods, such as, e.g., photometric means. Amounts of<br>
IL-17 polypeptide expressed in samples are then compared with the standard values.<br>
As a matter of convenience, the antibody of the present invention can be provided<br>
in a kit, a packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions<br>
for performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody is labeled with an enzyme, the<br>
kit will include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g., a substrate<br><br>
precursor which provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore). In addition, other<br>
additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a blocking buffer or lysis<br>
buffer) and the like. The relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely<br>
to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents which substantially optimize the<br>
sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be provided as dry powders,<br>
usually lyophilized, including excipients which on dissolution will provide a reagent<br>
solution having the appropriate concentration.<br>
Therapeutic Uses for the Antibody<br>
IL-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated T cells at sites of<br>
inflammation, not in the systemic circulation; it is not readily detectable in the serum or<br>
tissues of a healthy person. IL-17 upregulates adhesion molecules, induces production of<br>
multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from various cell types including<br>
synoviocytes, chondroctes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, thereby inducing<br>
recruitment of neutrophils to an inflammatory site, stimulates the production of<br>
prostaglandins and metalloproteinases, and inhibits proteogrycan synthesis. Furthermore,<br>
IL-17 plays an important role in the maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. IL-17<br>
has signaling roles in different organs and tissues including lung, articular cartilage, bone,<br>
brain, hematopoietic cells, kidney, skin and intestine. IL-17 shares 15-27% amino acid<br>
homology with IL-17 B, C and E and 44-50% amino acid homology with IL-17 D and F.<br>
IL-17 binds to the IL-17 receptor with low affinity (about 1 nM), while other IL-17<br>
family members do not bind to the IL-17 receptor.<br>
Increased levels of IL-17 (i.e., IL-17 A) have been associated with several<br>
conditions including airway inflammation, RA, osteoarthritis, bone erosion,<br>
intraperitoneal abscesses and adhesions, IBD, allograft rejection, psoriasis, certain types<br>
of cancer, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis and MS. Both IL-17 and IL-17R are up-<br>
regulated in the synovial tissue of RA patients. IL-17 exerts its role in pathogenesis of<br>
RA through IL-l-p and TNF-a dependent and independent pathways. IL-17 stimulates<br>
secretion of other cytokines and chemokines, e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and Gro-α.<br>
IL-17 directly contributes to disease progression in RA. Injection of IL-17 into the<br>
mouse knee promotes joint destruction independently of IL-1β activity (Ann. Rheum.<br>
Dis. 59:529-32,2000). Anti-IL-1β antibody has no effect on IL-17 induced inflammation<br><br>
and joint damage (J. Immunol. 167:1004-1013,2001). In an SCW-induced murine<br>
arthritis model, IL-17 induced inflammatory cell infiltration and proteoglycan depletion<br>
in wild-type and IL-1β knock out and TNF-α knock out mice. 11-17 knock out mice are<br>
phenotypically normal in the absence of antigenic challenge, but have markedly reduced<br>
arthritis following type II collagen immunization (J. Immunol. 171:6173-6177,2003).<br>
Multiple sclerosis ("MS") is an autoimmune disease characterized by central<br>
nervous system ("CNS") inflammation with damage to the myelin sheath surrounding<br>
axons. A hallmark of MS is that T cells infiltrate into the CNS. MS affects more than<br>
350,000 persons in the U.S. and 2.5 million worldwide. There are many forms and the<br>
most common is relapsing/remitting disease ("RRMS) followed by a secondary<br>
progressive stage. Current therapeutics consist of Interferon-P (AVONEX,<br>
BETASERON and REBIF) that reduces the relapse/exacerbation rate by 31%-34%, but<br>
may produce flu-like symptoms and/or synthesis of neutralizing antibodies (e.g., about<br>
15% of patients receiving AVONEX produce neutralizing antibodies in 18 months.<br>
TYSABRI, approved by the FDA for RRMS was subsequently removed from the market<br>
due to CNS immunosuppression concerns. There is still an unmet medical need in the<br>
treatment of MS. IL-17 mRNA is increased in MS lesions and in mononuclear cells<br>
(MNC) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients. Higher numbers of IL-17<br>
mRNA-expressing blood MNC are detected during MS clinical exacerbation compared to<br>
remission (Multiple Sclerosis, 5:101-104,1999). Furthermore, experimental autoimmune<br>
encephalomyelitis ("EAE"), a preclinical animal model for MS is significantly suppressed<br>
in IL-17 knockout mice.<br>
Therefore, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-IL-17 monoclonal<br>
antibody of the invention may be useful for the treatment or prevention of conditions<br>
wherein the presence of IL-17 causes or contributes to undesirable pathological effects or<br>
decrease of IL-17 activity has a therapeutic benefit in mammals, preferably humans,<br>
including, but not limited to, airway inflammation, asthma, RA, osteoarthritis, bone<br>
erosion, intraperitoneal abscesses and adhesions, IBD, allograft rejection, psoriasis,<br>
certain types of cancer, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis and MS, as well as other<br>
inflammatory disorders, conditions, diseases or states including without limit:<br>
erythematosus, response to allergen exposure, Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis,<br>
bronchial asthma, and allograft rejection (e.g., renal), systemic lupus erythematosis and<br><br>
lupus nephritis. The use of an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody of the present invention<br>
for treating or preventing of at least one of the aforementioned disorders in which IL-17<br>
activity is detrimental or which benefits for decreased levels of bioactive IL-17 is<br>
contemplated herein. Additionally, the use of an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody of the<br>
present invention for use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of at least<br>
one of the aforementioned disorders is contemplated.<br>
As used herein, the terms "treatment", "treating", and the like, refer to obtaining a<br>
desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect The effect may be prophylactic in terms<br>
of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be<br>
therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse affect<br>
attributable to the disease. Treatment", as used herein, includes administration of a<br>
compound of the present invention for treatment of a disease or condition in a mammal,<br>
particularly in a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a<br>
subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having<br>
it; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; and (c) relieving the disease,<br>
i.e., causing regression of the disease or disorder or alleviating symptoms or<br>
complications thereof. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired<br>
response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may<br>
be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be<br>
proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic<br>
situation.<br>
Pharmaceutical Composition<br>
An antibody of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions suitable for administration to a subject (see, e.g., Example 14). The<br>
compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, and/or excipient, in single or multiple doses.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for administration are designed to be appropriate for<br>
the selected mode of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier,<br>
and/or excipients such as dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives,<br>
solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents, stabilizing agents and the like are used as<br>
appropriate (See, e.g., Example 14 herein). Said compositions are designed in<br><br>
accordance with conventional techniques as in e.g.. Remington. The Science and Practice<br>
of Pharmacy, 19th Edition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 1995 which<br>
provides a compendium of formulation techniques as are generally known to<br>
practitioners.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody of<br>
the present invention can be administered to a subject at risk for or exhibiting pathologies<br>
as described herein using standard administration techniques including oral, intravenous,<br>
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal,<br>
sublingual, or suppository administration.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention preferably is a "therapeutically<br>
effective amount" or a "prophylactically effective amount" of an antibody of the<br>
invention. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages<br>
and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the antibody may vary according to factors such as the<br>
disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or<br>
antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective<br>
amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effect of the antibody, are<br>
outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically effective<br>
amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to<br>
achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in<br>
subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount<br>
will be less than the therapeutically effective amount<br>
A therapeutically-effective or prophylactically-effective amount is at least the<br>
minimal dose, but less than atoxic dose, of an active agent which is necessary to impart<br>
therapeutic benefit to a subject. Stated another way, a therapeutically-effective amount of<br>
an antibody of the invention is an amount which in mammals, preferably humans,<br>
decreases an IL-17 bioactivity, e.g., binding to IL17R, wherein the presence of IL-17<br>
causes or contributes to undesirable pathological effects or decrease in IL-17 levels<br>
results in a beneficial therapeutic effect in a mammal, preferably a human.<br>
The route of administration of an antibody of the present invention may be oral,<br>
parenteral, by inhalation, or topical. Preferably, the antibodies of the invention can be<br>
incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration.<br><br>
The term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,<br>
rectal, vaginal, or intraperitoneal administration. Peripheral systemic delivery by<br>
intravenous or intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection is preferred. Suitable vehicles<br>
for such injections are straightforward in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition typically must be sterile and stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage in the container provided, including e.g., a sealed<br>
vial or syringe. Therefore, pharmaceutical compositions may be sterile filtered after<br>
making the formulation, or otherwise made microbiologically acceptable. A typical<br>
composition for intravenous infusion could have a volume as much as 250-1000 ml of<br>
fluid, such as sterile Ringer's solution, physiological saline, dextrose solution and Hank's<br>
solution and a therapeutically effective dose, (e.g., 1 to 100 mg/ml, or more) of antibody<br>
concentration. Dose may vary depending on the type and severity of the disease. As is<br>
well known in the medical arts, dosages for any one subject depends upon many factors,<br>
including the patient's size, body surface area, age, the particular compound to be<br>
administered, sex, time and route of administration, general health, and other drugs being<br>
administered concurrently. A typical dose can be, for example, in the range of 0.001 to<br>
1000 μg; however, doses below or above this exemplary range are envisioned, especially<br>
considering the aforementioned factors. The dairy parenteral dosage regimen can be<br>
about 0.1 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.3 μg/kg<br>
to about 10 mg/kg and more preferably from about 1 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, even more<br>
preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Progress may be monitored<br>
by periodic assessment For repeated administrations over several days or longer,<br>
depending on the condition, the treatment is repeated until a desired suppression of<br>
disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful and are not<br>
excluded herefrom. The desired dosage can be delivered by a single bolus administration,<br>
by multiple bolus administrations, or by continuous infusion administration of antibody,<br>
depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the practitioner wishes to<br>
achieve.<br>
These suggested amounts of antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic<br>
discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result<br>
obtained. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being<br>
treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual<br><br>
patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type<br>
of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other<br>
factors known to medical practitioners.<br>
Therapeutic agents of the invention may be frozen or lyophilized for storage and<br>
reconstituted in a suitable sterile carrier prior to use. Lyophilization and reconstitutton<br>
can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss. Dosages may have to be adjusted to<br>
compensate. Generally, pH between 6 and 8 is preferred.<br>
Article of Manufacture.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture containing<br>
materials useful for the treatment or prevention of the disorders or conditions described<br>
above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label. Suitable<br>
containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers<br>
may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a<br>
composition of an antibody of the invention which is effective for preventing or treating<br>
the disorder or condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container<br>
may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic<br>
injection needle). The active agent in the composition is an anti-IL-17 antibody of the<br>
invention. The label on, or associated with, the container indicates that the composition<br>
is used for treating the condition of choice. The article of manufacture may further<br>
comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as<br>
phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further<br>
include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other<br>
buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.<br>
The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 1 ELISA I: Antibody Binding to IL-17 of Various Species<br>
An exemplary ELISA assay for measuring binding of antibodies to IL-17 uses<br>
sealed Costar 3366 microtiter plates that are coated overnight at 4°C with 50 μl of 1.0<br>
μg/ml human IL-17 per well (R&amp;D Systems, #317-IL/CF) in carbonate coating buffer (50<br>
mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.0). Alternatively, mouse, rat, rabbit or cynomolgus monkey<br>
IL-17 are used. Human IL-22 (R&amp;D Systems) is used as a control antigen. Rabbit and<br>
cynomolgus monkey IL-17 are not commercially available and therefore require cloning<br>
and expression, or artificial synthesis, according to methods known in the art making use<br>
of the amino acid sequences for IL-17 of the various species provided in Figure 2 (Seq ED<br>
NOs: 9 and 10). Exemplary nucleotide sequences encoding IL-17 of the various species<br>
are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 250-254.<br>
The plate is subsequently blocked by adding 100 ul blocking buffer (Pierce<br>
#37515). The plate is incubated for 1 hour at 37°C then washed three times in wash<br>
buffer (PBS pH 7.4 and 0.05% Tween). Then, 50 μl of either sample antibody or control<br>
antibody (diluted to various concentrations in PBS pH 7.4, e.g., 2,0.4,0.08,0.016,<br>
0.0032 and 0 μg/ml) is added to each well and the plate is further incubated for 1 hour at<br>
37°C. The plate is then washed three times with wash buffer before adding 50 μl per well<br>
of anti-human kappa-alkaline phosphatase conjugated diluted to 1:1000 in PBS pH 7.4.<br>
The test samples are incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Then p-nitrophenyl phosphate<br>
disodium salt (PNPP, Pierce #37620) is freshly made by dissolving in diethanolamine<br>
substrate buffer according to manufacturer's instruction and 50 μl is added to each well.<br>
Color development is allowed to proceed for about 10 minutes at room temperature then<br>
color signal is measured at an absorbance of 405 nm using any appropriate ELISA plate<br>
reader. The degree of binding is proportional to color signal production.<br>
Antibodies of the invention bind human IL-17 in an ELISA assay as described<br>
herein, but do not bind rat or mouse IL-17. It is anticipated, given the Biacore data of<br>
Example 4 demonstrating that antibodies of the invention bind human and monkey IL-17,<br>
that the antibodies of the invention would also demonstrate binding to monkey IL-17 in<br>
an ELISA assay as described herein.<br>
Example 2 ELISA II: Antibody Binding to Proteins of IL-17 Family<br><br>
An ELISA is used to measure whether antibodies of the invention selectively<br>
and/or preferentially bind particular human IL-17 members (e.g., IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-<br>
17C, IL-17D, IL-17E or DL-17F) or human IL-22 (negative control).<br>
In an exemplary assay, ELISA plate wells (Nunc Immuno Maxisorp) are coated<br>
with 100 μl (0-5 μg/ml in IX coating buffer (BioFx)) of IL-17 family member proteins<br>
(R&amp;D Systems) sealed and incubated overnight at 4°C. The solution in the well is<br>
removed by flicking and blocking buffer (200 |xl 1.5% BSA in PBS) is added. The plates<br>
are incubated on a rotating shaker for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then 100 μl of an<br>
antibody to be tested is added per well at varying concentrations (e.g., 2,0.4,0.08,0.016,<br>
0.0032 and 0 μg/ml). The plates are again incubated overnight (4°C) followed by<br>
warming on a rotating shaker (60 min room temp). Each plate-well is then washed five<br>
times with buffer (IX Ish buffer, BioFX). After washing, an appropriate commercially<br>
available HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 in PBS with 1.5% BSA) is added<br>
(100 μl/well). Plates are re-incubated on a rotating shaker (60 min. room temp.) followed<br>
by buffer washing (5X) as described above. The colorimetric signal is developed by<br>
adding TMB (100 μl/well) until saturation (approx 3-5 min.) then further development is<br>
ended by adding stop solution (100 μl/well, BioFX). The color signal is measured at 450<br>
nm absorbance using any appropriate ELISA plate reader. The degree of binding is<br>
proportional to color signal production. Antibodies of the invention (e.g., Fabs 103, 104,<br>
118, 121, 126 and 131 as described in Table 1) specifically bind human IL-17 (i.e., IL-<br>
17 A), but, under similar conditions, do not bind at greater than background levels to<br>
human IL-17B, human DL-17C, human IL-17D, human IL-17E, human IL-17F, murine<br>
 IL-17 or human IL-22.<br>
Example 3 Isolation and activation of cells for cloning IL-17<br>
A. Rat splenocytes<br>
Using sterile forceps and scissors, remove spleen of a rat sacrificed by COj inhalation<br>
and put the spleen into a tube containing 5 ml RPMI1640 media + 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum and penicillin/streptomycin (media solution). Pour contents of the tube into a 10<br>
cm Petri dish and remove fat from spleen. Homogenize the spleen gentry using a pair of<br>
fully frosted, pre-autoclaved microscopy slides. Wash cells off slides using media<br>
solution, pipette a few times and filter cells through cell strainer (Fisher Scientific).<br><br>
Wash cells once with media solution, count cells and resuspend them to a final<br>
concentration of 2 x 107 cells/ml in 80 ml. Add cell solution to a T150 flask, add<br>
Concanavalin A to a final concentration of 3 ng/ml and incubate at 37°C for about 15<br>
hours. Harvest the cells, wash with PBS, freeze the cell pellet on dry ice and proceed<br>
immediately to standard RNA isolation procedures.<br>
B. Cynomolgus monkey and rabbit peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)<br>
Load about 7 ml whole blood from cynomolgus monkey or 10 ml whole blood from<br>
New Zealand white rabbit into a BD Vacutainer™ CPT™ System for separation of<br>
mononuclear cells from whole blood. Centrifuge the CPT cell preparation tube for 20<br>
min at 1500 x gravity in a horizontal swinging bucket rotor. Collect lymphocytes and<br>
monocytes at the interface, wash twice with media solution, count and resuspend in media<br>
solution at a final concentration of 106 cells/mL Add Concanavalin A to a final<br>
concentration of 3 ug/ml and incubate at 37°C for about 15 hours. Harvest the cells,<br>
wash with PBS, freeze the cell pellet on dry ice and proceed immediately to standard<br>
RNA isolation procedures.<br>
Example 4 Measuring Binding Kinetic Constants<br>
A BIACORE® 2000 instrument is used to measure antigen-antibody binding<br>
kinetics and affinity. The instrument utilizes the optical properties of surface plasmon<br>
resonance to detect alteration in protein concentration of interacting molecules within a<br>
dextran biosensor matrix. Except as noted, all reagents and materials are purchased from<br>
BIACORE® AB. All measurements are performed at 25°C. Samples are resuspended in<br>
HBS-EP buffer to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml (150 mM sodium chloride, 3 mM<br>
EDTA, 0.005% (w/v) surfactant P-20, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Protein A is<br>
immobilized on flow cells 1 to 4 of a CM4 sensor chip at a level of 500 response units<br>
using an amine coupling kit<br>
Binding is evaluated using multiple analytical cycles. Each cycle is performed at<br>
a flow rate of 50 μl/minute and consists of the following steps: injection of about 20 μl of<br>
an antibody composition at 2 ug/ml aiming at a capture of 100-200 response units,<br>
injection of 250 μl of human IL-17, Cynomalgus monkey IL-17, New Zealand white<br>
rabbit IL-17, rat IL-17 or mouse IL-17 (starting at 10 nM and using two-fold serial<br>
dilutions for each cycle) followed by 20 minutes for dissociation, and regeneration using<br><br>
30 μl of 10 mM glycine hydrochloride, pH 1.5. Association and dissociation rates for<br>
each cycle are evaluated using a "1:1 with mass transfer" binding model in the<br>
BIAevaluation software.<br>
Full-length mAbs 103,104, 118, 121, 126 and 131 (see Table 1) having an IgG4<br>
Fc region exhibit high affinity binding to human IL-17 and to monkey IL-17 with a KD<br>
less than 5 pM, a Koff slower than 2 x 10-5s-1 and a K™ of at least 5 x 106 M-1s-1. The KD<br>
and koirare improved (i.e., lower KD, slower koff) in these variant mAbs over Fab 2321<br>
mAb (parent Fab of e.g., Fab 103 and 104) comprising a murine variable region [Seq ID<br>
Nos: 261 (VH of 2321), 262 (VL of 2321)], a human IgG4 heavy chain constant region<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 260) and a kappa light chain constant regions (SEQ ID NO: 272).<br>
Antibodies of the invention exhibit binding no greater than background levels to mouse<br>
IL-17 or rat IL-17; no binding is detected up to 200 nM mouse IL-17 and no binding is<br>
detected up to 1 μM rat IL-17. When the full-length mAbs 103, 104, 121 and 126 are<br>
tested, under the same conditions described above, for binding to cynomolgus monkey<br>
IL-17 and rabbit IL-17; binding to rabbit IL-17 is weak and biphasic while binding to<br>
monkey IL-17 is similar to binding to humaa Specific values for certain mabs (values<br>
are reported as mean ± standard error of mean) of the invention when tested in this assay<br>
are listed in Table 4 below. It is contemplated that Fc regions other than that of IgG4<br>
would not significantly affect KD and koff<br><br><br><br>
Example 5 IL-17 Receptor/Anti-IL-17 Antibody Binding Competition Studies<br>
This example demonstrates that the antibodies of the invention compete for<br>
binding to IL-17 with the IL-17 receptor.<br>
BIACORE binding studies are performed using the IL-17 receptor Fc-fusion<br>
protein (R&amp;D #177-IR). To demonstrate that the IL-17 receptor Fc-fusion protein binds<br>
human IL-17, a BIACORE assay is performed in BIACORE binding buffer (HBS-EP) +<br>
1 mg/ml BSA at 25°C on a BIACORE 2000 instrument. A CM4 chip is used with<br>
approximately 600 response units of Protein A immobilized on flow cells 1,2 and 3 of<br>
the chip. Approximately 100 response units of IL-17 receptor Fc-fusion protein is<br>
captured on flow cell 2 of the chip. Human IL-17 is then exposed to flow cells 1 and 2 in<br>
concentrations ranging from 600 nM to 9.4 nM. After each 250 ul injection of human IL-<br>
17, the complex is allowed to dissociate for about 12 minutes by running buffer across the<br>
chip. At the end of the dissociation, a 20 μl injection of 100 mM glycine pH 1.5 is used<br>
to regenerate the chip before the next cycle of binding begins. Flow cell 1 is used as a<br>
reference flow cell. The data is fit using the "Bivalent analyte" model in the<br>
BIAevaluation Version 3.2 software. The results indicate that this interaction has an on-<br>
rate of 1.06 x 105 M-1s-1 a fast off-rate of 20.3 s-1 and a slow off-rate of 1.63 x 10-4 s-1.<br>
Therefore, mis interaction has a KD or binding affinity of 1.5 nM and 0.19 mM which is<br>
much weaker than the binding affinities of the antibodies of the invention to human IL-<br>
17.<br>
Binding for the competition experiment is also measured in HBS-EP +1 mg/ml<br>
BSA at 25°C on a BIACORE 2000 instrument with a CM4 chip. Approximately 1000<br>
response units of an antibody of the invention is immobilized on flow cells 2,3 and 4 of<br>
the chip; flow cell 1 is left blank. Using a flow rate of 50 μl/ml, 25 μl of 500 nM human<br>
IL-17 is injected over all four flow cells, forming the antibody:antigen complex on the<br>
surface of the chip. After the injection is complete and the complex formed, 250 μl of<br><br>
500 nM human IL-17 receptor Fc fusion protein is injected over all four flow cells. At<br>
the end of this injection a 25 μl injection 100 mM glycine pH 1.5 is used to regenerate the<br>
chip. The same binding experiment is then repeated using a 250 ΜL injection of buffer<br>
rather than IL-17 receptor Fc fusion protein.<br>
The binding profiles for both the receptor injection over the antibody:antigen<br>
complex and for the buffer control injection over the antibody :antigen complex are<br>
identical. This indicates that there are no binding sites available for the dimeric IL-17 to<br>
bind to its receptor once it is bound to an antibody of the invention. This result also<br>
Indicates that the receptor is not able to "pull" IL-17 away from any of the antibodies<br>
once the complex is formed. These antibodies can inhibit human IL-17 from binding to<br>
its receptor, therefore neutralizing biological activity of human IL-17.<br>
Example 6A In vitro IL-8 Reporter Assay<br>
To test the ability of an antibody of the invention to neutralize or antagonize an<br>
IL-17 bioactivity, one can utilize the IL-8 reporter assay described herein. This approach<br>
can also be used to determine the potency of Fabs or mAbs of the invention in a cell-<br>
based assay. The human HS27 cell line (ATCC #CRL-1634) secretes IL-8 in response to<br>
IL-17. The IL-17-induced IL-8 secretion is inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-17<br>
antibodies (See, e.g., J. Imm. 155:5483-5486,1995 or Cytokine 9:794-800,1997).<br>
Accordingly, IL-17-induced IL-8 secretion should proceed unconstrained if sufficient IL-<br>
17 is added to HS27 cells in the absence of neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibody.<br>
HS27 cells are maintained in assay medium: DMEM high glucose medium<br>
lacking phenol red (Invitrogen #31053-028) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-<br>
glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin G (100 U/500 ml) and streptomycin (100<br>
μg/500 ml). Cells are grown in T150 flasks until they are about 80-90% confluent the<br>
day of the assay. Human IL-17 (R&amp;D Systems, #317-IL-050) is reconstituted in sterile<br>
PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ stored frozen, freshly thawed for use and diluted to 200<br>
ng/ml in assay medium. A 50 ul aliquot of the diluted IL-17 is added to each well of a<br>
96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate (Falcon #35-3072) with the outer wells left empty.<br>
Duplicate wells are used for a media-only control (100 μl/well) and IL-17-only control<br>
(100 μl/well). Testing is carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Sterile full-length mAb<br>
proteins are diluted to a maximum concentration of 24 μg/ml in assay media. Serial<br><br>
dilutions (typically 1:5) are made in a separate assay plate and 50 μl of the Fab samples at<br>
the various dilutions are added to the wells containing IL-17 then incubated at 37°C for 1<br>
hour. Assay medium alone is used as a negative control.<br>
HS27 cells (typically about 20,000 cells in 100 μl assay medium) are added to<br>
each well of the plate containing Fab + IL-17 (or controls) and incubated for about 48<br>
hours at 37°C. The media supernatants are then collected after centrifugation of the 96<br>
well plates for 5 minutes at 500 times gravity and diluted 1:15 or 1:10 in assay media.<br>
The level of IL-17 neutralization is measured by determination of IL-8 amounts in<br>
supernatant using a commercial ELISA kit according to manufacturer's instruction except<br>
assay medium is substituted for standard diluent and substrate volume is 100 μl/well<br>
(R&amp;D Systems, ELISA D-8000C or R&amp;D DuoSet ELISA #DY208hIL-8). ELISA<br>
measurements (450 nm) are taken on a microplate reader. Calibration curves are obtained<br>
using a 4-parameter logistic fit with IL-8 values (pg/ml) determined from the calibration<br>
curves using standard statistical techniques. IC50 values are obtained using standard<br>
statistical techniques.<br>
Full-length mabs 103,104,121 and 126 of the invention (with IgG4 Fc region),<br>
when tested in the assay described (2-4 replications), have an average IC50 (based on an<br>
estimated molecular weight of 150 kD for each mAb) of between 450 and 500 pM with<br>
the range of all measured values between 365 and 618 pM.<br>
Example 6B In vitro GROa Reporter Assay<br>
To test the ability of an antibody of the invention to neutralize or antagonize an<br>
IL-17 bioactivity, one can utilize the following cell-based assay. IL-17 can stimulate<br>
epithelial cells and other cells to secrete GROa. The ability of an antibody of the<br>
invention to neutralize IL-17 - induced GROa secretion from the human colorectal<br>
adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line HT-29 is tested in mis assay.<br>
To test whether human IL-17 dose-dependently induced GROa secretion from<br>
HT-29 cells, recombinant IL-17 (R&amp;D Systems #317-IL-050/CF; reconstituted in sterile<br>
Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (D-PBS)) is diluted (to 4.5 μg/ml; 3X the<br>
highest test concentration) in assay/culture medium (McCoy's 5A (Invitrogen); 10% FBS<br>
(Invitrogen); penicillin G (100 U/500 ml); and streptomycin (100 ug/500 mL IL-17 is<br>
further diluted serially (1:5) in assay medium. Various concentrations of IL-17 (0.096<br><br>
ng/ml - 1,500 ng/ml; 3.0 pM - 46,875 pM) are dispensed (50 μl each) into inner wells of<br>
a tissue-culture treated 96-well plate. Assay medium (50 μl) is dispensed into 3 wells for<br>
a "medium alone" treatment. Testing is carried out in triplicate (3 wells per treatment).<br>
The plate containing IL-17 in assay medium is incubated for approx. 60-90 minutes at<br>
37°C, 5% CO2, before the addition of HT-29 cells.<br>
For evaluation of an antibody of the invention, e.g., mAb 126 with an IgG4 Fc<br>
region, a concentration of IL-17 that gave approximately 70% of maximal GROa<br>
secretion from HT-29 cells is used (60 ng/ml). Recombinant human IL-17 (R&amp;D<br>
Systems) is diluted (to 240 ng/ml; 4X working concentration) in assay/culture medium.<br>
Diluted DL-17 is dispensed (50 μl) into 60 separate inner wells of tissue-culture treated<br>
96-well plates (Becton Dickinson Falcon #35-3072). Assay medium (50 μl) is dispensed<br>
into 3 wells for a "medium alone" treatment.<br>
A dose range of an antibody of the invention to be tested is typically from 2.56 -<br>
40,000 pM. In a separate dilution plate, the antibody of the invention and control<br>
antibody (sterile, in 1X PBS, pH 7.4) are diluted to 160,000 pM in assay medium. The<br>
antibody of the invention and control antibody are further diluted serially (1:5) in assay<br>
medium. Each test concentration of the antibody of the invention to be tested is then<br>
added (50 μl) to wells containing IL-17. Testing is typically carried out in triplicate.<br>
Assay medium alone (50 μl) is used for "medium alone" and "IL-17 alone" controls.<br>
Plates containing IL-17 and antibody of the invention mixtures are incubated for 60-90<br>
minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2, before the addition of HT-29 cells.<br>
HT-29 cells (human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, ATCC #HTB-38),<br>
are maintained in culture/assay medium in tissue culture-treated flasks using standard<br>
techniques. HT-29 cells are grown in tissue culture flasks until they were 50-80%<br>
confluent on the day of the assay. On the day of the assay, the cells are rinsed with HBSS<br>
(Cambrex #CC-5024) and detached from the culture flasks with trypsin + EDTA. The<br>
trypsin is inactivated with complete assay medium. HT-29 cells are then centrifuged at<br>
SOOXg for 5 min. at RT. The cell pellet is then re-suspended in assay medium and 20,000<br>
HT-29 cells (in 100 μl) are added to each treatment well of the 96-well plates. An equal<br>
volume of D-PBS is added to each of the unused edge wells (without cells) to reduce<br><br>
edge effects resulting from evaporation. The 96-well plates were placed in a tissue culture<br>
incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for approximately 48 hours.<br>
At the end of the assay, the plates are centrifuged (SOOXg for 5 min. at RT), and<br>
the cell culture media is transferred to polypropylene 96-well plates. GROa levels are<br>
measured with a GROa sandwich ELISA (R+D Systems DuoSet #DY275), as per the<br>
manufacturer's instructions, except for: using assay medium as the standard diluent, using<br>
IX ELISA wash buffer from BioFX Labs, using a sample and standard volume of SO μl<br>
per well, using a substrate from BioFX Labs (HRP substrate, #TMBW-1000-01), and<br>
using a stop solution from BioFX Labs (#LSTP-1000-01) (100 μl per well). At the end of<br>
the ELISA reactions, plates are read at 450 nm on a microplate reader. Calibration curves<br>
for GROa are obtained by performing a 4-parameter logistic fit GROa values<br>
(concentration in pg/ml) for the samples are obtained from the calibration curves. The<br>
human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line HT-29 secreted GROa when<br>
stimulated with IL-17, in a dose-dependent manner (Table 5). Control human IgG4 did<br>
not cause a decrease in IL-17 - induced GROa secretion. These results (Table 6)<br>
demonstrate that mAb 126 is able to completely neutralize human IL-17 - induced GROa<br>
secretion from HT-29 cells in vitro using the conditions described. The IC50 value for<br>
mAb 126 in this assay is approximately 560 pM.<br><br><br><br>
Human IL-17 is able to bind and stimulate the mouse IL-17 receptor, leading to an<br>
elevation and subsequent secretion of mouse KC (CXCL1) chemokine. Time and dose<br>
ranging experiments are undertaken to identify the optimal dose of human IL-17 and the<br>
optimal time for induction of mouse KC. These experiments indicate that a 150 μg/kg<br>
dose of human IL-17 and a time of 2 hours post IL-17 administration gives maximal<br>
levels of KC in mouse serum. Full-length antibodies of the present invention (e.g., Fab<br>
126 or Fab 121 with HCVR operably linked to human IgG4 Fc, SEQ ID NO:260 [or SEQ<br>
ID NO: 278] and the LCVR operably linked to a human kappa constant region, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 263 [or SEQ ID NO: 277]) are administered intravenously to mice at 1,10,100 and<br>
1000 μg/kg) one hour prior to a subcutaneous injection of human IL-17. At two hours<br>
after human IL-17 administration, the mice are sacrificed and KC levels are determined<br>
by ELISA using a commercially available kit according to manufacturer's instruction<br>
(KC Quantikine, R&amp;D). Isotype matched antibodies are used as negative controls. The<br>
antibodies block the ability of human IL-17 to stimulate the mouse IL-17 receptor,<br>
leading to inhibition of an elevation of mouse KC, in a dose dependent manner. Mabl26<br>
(a full length antibody comprising Fab 126), at a dose of 20 ug/mouse under the<br>
conditions described, decreases the mean KC level by approximately four-fold compared<br>
to a control antibody which had no effect. Mab 121, at a dose of 20 ug/mouse under the<br>
conditions described, decreases the mean KC level by approximately three-fold compared<br>
to a control antibody.<br>
Example 8 Epitope Mapping<br>
Two of the anti-IL-17 antibodies (Fab 126 and Fab 104) are used to determine that<br>
the humanization and optimization of the parent murine Fab (2321, SEQ IDNOs: 261<br><br>
and 262) do not alter the epitope-binding ability of the Fabs resulting from humanization<br>
and optimization of the parent The humanized, optimized Fabs bind to the same epitope<br>
as does the parent murine Fab as determined by a standard competition ELISA or by H-D<br>
exchange and mass spec analysis for epitope mapping (See, e.g., Hoofnagle, A., et al.,<br>
Methods Mol. Biol. 250:283-298,2004; Hoomagle, A., et al., Ann. Rev. Btophys. Biomol.<br>
Struct., 32:1-25,2003; Baerga-Ortiz, A., et aL, Protein Sci. 11:1300-8,2002) therefore,<br>
Fabs 1-132 of the invention derived from the same parent Fab, would be expected to bind<br>
the same epitope.<br>
Using the H-D exchange and mass spec assay (H/DXMS) to map the epitope, it is<br>
determined that amino acids between 80 and 89 [ADGNVDYHMN (SEQ ID NO: 266)]<br>
of human IL-17 (SEQ ID NO: 1) are comprised within the discontinuous epitope to which<br>
the antibodies of the invention bind. DGNVDYH (SEQ ID NO: 267) is an essential<br>
sequence comprised within the discontinuous epitope to which antibodies of the invention<br>
bind based on comparison of sequence variation of IL-17 among different species and<br>
binding capability. Changing the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 267 within the<br>
context of entire IL-17 sequence, results in no detectable binding to the altered IL-17 by<br>
an antibody of the invention. Antibodies of the invention do not bind to rat or mouse IL-<br>
17 at levels greater than control antibody.<br>
H/DXMS assay is used to identify regions of IL-17 to which antibodies of the<br>
invention bind. The rate of amide hydrogen exchange rate is dependent on the structure<br>
and solvent accessibility of the amid hydrogen. Free IL-17 or IL-17: antibody complex in<br>
water is mixed with deuterated water (D2O) to allow exchange of amide protons by<br>
deuterium. Those backbone amide groups that participate in protein binding are<br>
protected from exchange and remain protonated. These regions are then identified by<br>
peptic proteolysis, coupled with LC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.<br>
Human IL-17 containing a C-terminal His and Flag tag (IL-17-Flis) is expressed and<br>
purified from GS-CHO cells using an IMAC column. Two 10 fig aliquots (7.7 μl) of IL-<br>
17-Flis solution is transferred into 2 Microcon, and 100 ug of either mAb 104 or mAb<br>
126 (molar ratio of IL-17/Mab -1/2) is added into Microcoa Twenty μg of IL-17-Flis<br>
solution is transferred into another Microcon and no antibody added. Then lx PBS buffer<br>
is added into each Microcon to the final volume of -180 μl and centrifuged at 14,000g for<br>
14 min. Then 150 ml of lx PBS buffer is added into each Microcon and centrifuged at<br><br>
14,000g for 14 rain. These steps are necessary to ensure the free antigen and the<br>
antigenrantibody complex are in identical buffer conditions.<br>
The protein portion is collected and the final volume is adjusted to SO ul (complex)<br>
or 80 ul (IL-17-Flis only) with lxPBS. Six microliters of IL-17-Flis or complex of IL-<br>
17-Flis and mAb complex are transferred into a micro plastic vial, and 14 ul of 100%<br>
D2O is added into it, resulting in 70% D2O in the sample. The solution is incubated at<br>
ambient temperature for 10 min. The exchange is immediately quenched, digested by<br>
adding 20 ul of 1% formic acid solution and 2 ul of 2 mg/ml pepsin solution, and<br>
incubated at ambient temperature for 30 sec or at 0°C for 10 min. The digest is<br>
immediately injected onto a column manually. Waters 2795 HPLC and Micromass LTC<br>
Premier are used for all assays. HPLC stream from HPLC pump is connected to a metal<br>
tube (about 1 ml), to manual injector, to a Zorbax C18 column (2.1x50mm) running<br>
under these settings (Column Temperature:0°C; Mobile Phase C: 0.15% formic acid in<br>
H2O, D: 0.12% Formic acid in ACN; Run Time:23 min). The column is equilibrated<br>
with 98% A (0.15% formic acid aqueous solution) and 2% B (0.12% formic acid in<br>
acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A gradient elution is performed from 2% to<br>
10% B over 0.5 min, then to 40% B over 14.5 min, then to 90% B over 1 min with 2 min<br>
hold, and then returned to 2%B in 1 min.). The sample from HPLC is analyzed by mass<br>
spectrometer operated with these settings (Ion Mode: Positive; Mass Scan Range: 300-<br>
2000; Sample Cone Voltage: 80; Desolvation Gas Flow (L/Hr):700; Desolvation Temp:<br>
300°C). The metal tube, injector loop and column are submerged in ice water throughout<br>
the assay. Mass spectrum of each peptic peptide of IL-17 is obtained after H/D exchange<br>
with or without an anti-IL-17 mAb tested. For small peptides, the average mass of each<br>
peptide is calculated based on its isotopic ions and intensities. For larger peptides, the<br>
average masses are obtained from deconvoluted mass spectra after internal calibration.<br>
When antibody forms a complex with IL-17, the binding region (epitope) of IL-17<br>
is protected from solvent This leads to slower amide hydrogen exchange rates when<br>
compared to those of IL-17 alone. By comparing the mass of peptides from the free and<br>
from the complex after deuterium exchange, the peptides protected by complex formation<br>
should be different from the corresponding peptide in free IL-17. Table 7 below lists<br>
mass differences that are obtained by H/DXMS for peptic peptides of IL-17. These peptic<br>
peptides cover the whole sequence of IL-17-Flis. As the data in the table demonstrate,<br><br>
the mass difference of IL-17-Flis peptide between the complex and itself is similar for<br>
both antibodies tested, i.e. they bind the same epitope. A major mass difference is found<br>
for the peptic peptide 24-87+117-133 (i.e., amino acids 24 to 87 and 117 to 133 of IL-17)<br>
(these two peptides are connected through disulfide bond) and 66-87+117-134,<br>
suggesting residues within these regions are involved in binding. Since those peptic<br>
peptides are quite large, other enzymatic digests are necessary to narrow down specific<br>
amino acid residues involved in binding. In addition to this data, the antibodies of the<br>
invention do not bind to other member of IL-17 family (IL-17 B,C,D,E, and F) and they<br>
also do not bind to mouse or rat IL-17. These data together with sequence comparison<br>
and examination of IL-17 homology structural model suggest that residues 80-89 are<br>
comprised within a non-linear epitope of IL-17 to which the antibodies of the invention<br>
bind.<br><br>
Example 9 IL-17 Expression in Cancer Tissues<br>
Various human non-cancerous and cancerous cell lysates are tested for the<br>
presence of IL-17 protein. Tissues (approximately 50-100 mg piece) are snap-frozen on<br>
dry ice, thawed on ice and lysed in 350 μl TPER buffer (Pierce #78510) including<br>
protease inhibitors (Pierce #78410) and phosphatase inhibitors in tubes containing<br>
ceramic lysing beads (Qbiogene #6913-050; 1.4 mm ceramic beads in 2.0 ml tubes). The<br>
tubes are placed on ice for 5-10 min then centrifuged at 13,000 x gravity for 10 min at<br><br>
4°C and the material transferred to new tubes to remove debris. Recentrifuge as<br>
described and transfer to new tube. Protein concentration is determined using a standard<br>
BSA method. The samples are analyzed for IL-17 using a commercial IL-17 ELISA kit<br>
according to manufacturer's instructions (R&amp;D #DY317 using wash buffer, substrate<br>
solution and stop solution from BioFX Labs). IL-17 levels are normalized to total protein<br>
concentration. IL-17 levels are increased between two- and three-fold in cancerous colon<br>
tissue (60 samples tested) as compared to normal colon tissue (63 samples tested). IL-17<br>
levels are increased on average three- to four-fold in cancerous kidney tissue (21 samples<br>
tested) as compared to normal kidney tissue (21 samples tested). IL-17 levels in<br>
cancerous prostate tissue (44 samples tested) are increased as compared to the normal<br>
prostate tissue (7 samples tested). The IL-17 levels were not elevated in other types of<br>
tumor tissue tested including breast, neck, lung, larynx, thyroid, tongue, ovary and brain.<br>
Example 10 IL-17 Activation of Microglial Cells<br>
IL-17 induces a tnurine brain microglia cell line (BV-2) to secrete IFNand IL-<br>
12p70. The BV-2 murine microglial cell line [obtained from Scios, with permission from<br>
Elisabeta Blasi (Microbiology University of Perugia, Italy) who originally isolated them<br>
(E. Blasi et al., J. Immunology 1990,27:229-237)] are cultured on poly-D-lysine coated<br>
tissue culture flasks, to no greater than 60% confluence in high-glucose DMEM<br>
(Invitrogen #31053-028) with 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen/GEBCO #25030-081), 10%<br>
FBS (heat inactivated; Invitrogen/GIBCO #10082-147), 1 mM sodium pyruvate<br>
(Invitrogen/GIBCO #11360-070), 100 μg/ml Nonnocin (InvivoGen) at 37°C, 5% CO*<br>
On day 0 of the assay, BV-2 cells are rinsed (Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and<br>
Mg2+; Invitrogen), detached (0.25% trypsin + EDTA) followed by trypsin inactivation<br>
then centrifuged (500Xg 5 min. at RT). The resulting cell pellet is re-suspended to a cell<br>
density of~7,000 cells/100 μl culture medium. 100 ul of cell suspension is dispensed into<br>
60 separate inner wells of poly-D-lysine coated tissue-culture treated 96-well plates.<br>
Plates are incubated as described, for approx. 48 hrs before treatment with IL-17.<br>
On day 2 of the assay, recombinant mouse IL-17 (mIL-17) (carrier-free; R&amp;D<br>
Systems); reconstituted in sterile Dulbecco's PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ is diluted in a<br>
polypropylene plate to 1.5 μg/ml (the highest test concentration) in culture medium.<br>
Mouse IL-17 is further serially diluted in the polypropylene plate. A positive control is<br><br>
LPS diluted in culture medium to 1 μg/ml (the highest test concentration). Assay medium<br>
is used as a negative control. Medium is gently aspirated from the cells, before adding<br>
treatments (150 jilAvell). Testing is carried out in triplicate (3 wells per treatment).<br>
Separate replicate plates are incubated for either 24 hr. or 48 hr. at 37°C, 5% CO2.<br>
On days 3 and day 4 of the assay, plates are centrifuged (500Xg for 5 min. RT),<br>
then cell culture media is transferred to polypropylene 96-well plates, which are sealed<br>
and frozen (-80°C). Media samples are thawed and assayed for cytokine and chemokine<br>
levels with a murine 22-plex multiplex kit (Linco), as per the manufacturer's instructions<br>
(except: a black-walled polycarbonate filter plate (Millipore) replaces the filter plate<br>
included in the kit). Fluorescence is read on a Luminex® instrument (50 beads per bead<br>
set, low RP1 gain setting). Data is shown in Table 8 below.<br>
Standard curves are obtained using a four- or five-parameter logistic fit. IFNγ and<br>
IL-12p70 values (pg/ml) are determined from the standard curves using standard<br>
statistical techniques.<br><br><br>
IBD is a chroNIc inflammatory disease which includes Crohn's Disease and<br>
Ulcerative Colitis. IL-17 protein levels are significantly elevated in the sera and in colon<br>
tissues from both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. However, IL-17 is not<br>
detectable in the sera from normal individuals, or patients with infectious colitis or<br>
ischaemic colitis The DSS (Dextran Sodium Sulfate) model is one of the oldest and most<br>
representative pre-clinical model for irritable bowel disease (IBD). In the DSS model<br>
(see, e.g., FASEB Journal 2004; 18:1550-1552) both acute and chronic inflammatory<br>
lesions are induced. Mice have a high degree of uniformity of the legions with losing<br>
body weight and colon length. It is reproducible in respect of time course and severity<br>
among individual mice. For disease induction, mice receive 5% DSS 30-40 Kd) in<br>
drinking water for 7 days. Disease Activity Index (DAI) including hemoccult positive or<br>
rectal bleeding, loose stool and loss of body weight (5-8%) is observed at about day 8.<br>
Body weights of mice are monitored every day for 2 weeks. Mice are sacrificed from<br>
about day 12 to about day 15. DL-17 protein is significantly increased in DSS-treated<br>
colon versus narve colon. Treatment with IL-17 antibody may reduce the disease activity<br>
index.<br>
Example 12 EAE Model for Multiple Sclerosis<br>
EAE is a CD4+ T cell-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous<br>
system (CNS) that serves as a model for MS in humans. The pathogenic mechanisms of<br>
EAE development include antigen-specific T cell activation and Th1 differentiation<br>
followed by T cell and macrophage infiltration into the CNS. IL-17 contributes to the<br>
pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Microarray analysis of MS lesions of human<br>
patients have demonstrated an increase of IL-17 (Lock, et al. Nat Med. 8:500-508,2002).<br>
IL-17 mRNA-expressing mononuclear cells (MNC) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid are<br>
significantly elevated in number in MS patients and higher numbers of IL-17 mRNA-<br>
expressing blood MNC were detected during MS clinical exacerbation compared to<br>
remission (Matusevicius, et al. Multiple Sclerosis. 5:1-1-104,1999). EAE is<br>
significantly suppressed in IL-17 knockout mice (Nakae et al., J. Immun. 171:6173-<br>
6177).<br>
The example described here demonstrates that IL-17 protein is increased in the<br>
spinal cord of EAE mice and treatment with an anti-murine IL-17 antibody reduces the<br><br>
EAE score in the active EAE model. For disease induction, 8-9 week old female<br>
C57BL/6 mice are subcutaneously immunized on day 0 with either (i) 200 μl of 5 mg/ml<br>
pertussis toxin (PT) and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) or (ii) PT, CFA and 300<br>
μg/200 μl of MOG35-55 (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein emulsified in CFA<br>
containing 5 mg/ml of heat inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis). On day 2, mice are<br>
treated again with PT. Mice are scored throughout the study for levels of paralysis.<br>
Disease is expected in the group receiving MOG. A rat anti-murine IL-17 monoclonal<br>
IgG1 antibody or isotype control antibody is administered to mice on days 1,7 and 15<br>
(BD Biosciences for rat anti-murine IL-17 antibody). Mice receiving MOG are sacrificed<br>
when clinical score reaches between 1-3 (on a scale of 0-4); this is between days 14-31<br>
for study 1 in Table 9 below and between days 14-16 for study 2 in Table 10 below.<br>
Clinical signs of disease develop about day 10. Individual animals are subjectively<br>
scored by at least 2 scorers independently and blinded to the identity of treatment groups<br>
according to clinical CNS disease severity. Grade 0 is normal; Grade 1 is completely<br>
limp tail; Grade 2 is unilateral partial hind limb weakness; Grade 3 is complete hind limb<br>
paralysis; and Grade 4 is moribund, (see J. Exp. Med. 194: 873-881,2001). A control<br>
mouse is sacrificed on the same day as a MOG-treated mouse. Spinal cords are isolated<br>
at the time of sacrifice and flash frozen to be used for IL-17 protein analysis by ELISA.<br>
IL-17 antibody treatment group has significantly lower disease scores as compared to<br>
isotype control group.<br>
Ly sates of each whole spinal cord are made in 1 ml (study 1 in Table 9 below) or<br>
0.4 ml (study 2 in Table 7 below) TPER protein extraction reagent (Pierce #78510) with<br>
complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science #11697498). in 2 ml tubes<br>
containing ceramic beads (lysing matrix D, QBiogene #6913050), and FastPrep<br>
instrument (BiolOl) for 30 seconds at a scale of 5.5. After lysis, samples are centrifuged<br>
(5 min. at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge) to remove debris. Supematants are transferred to<br>
new microfuge tubes. Total protein concentration in each lysate is determined with a<br>
BCA protein assay kit (Pierce #23225), vising the microplate protocol of the<br>
manufacturer. Lysates are frozen and stored at -80°C.<br>
After thawing lysates on ice, and clarifying by centrifugation, mouse IL-17 levels<br>
are measured in undiluted samples by ELISA (R&amp;D Quantikine #M1700) as per<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Standard curves are obtained using a four-parameter logistic<br><br>
fit. IL-17 values are detennined from the standard curves using standard statistical<br>
techniques. IL-17 levels are normalized to protein concentration in each sample and<br>
expressed as pg IL-17/ml total protein in each lysate in Tables 9 and 10 below. As<br>
demonstrated by the data in the tables, increased levels of IL-17 were detected in EAE<br>
mice.<br><br>
Example 13 Collagen-induced arthritis model<br>
Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used rodent model for rheumatoid<br>
arthritis ("RA") and has histopathological features in common with human RA.<br>
Experimental arthritis, induced in DBA/1 mice by immunization and boosting with<br>
emulsions of type n collagen, is a polyarthritic disease characterized by inflammation of<br>
the small joints and progressive erosion of cartilage and bone (Trentham, D, et al, J. Exp.<br>
Med. 146:857-858,1977). Recently, Lubberts, et al, (Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism, 50:650-<br>
659,2004; incorporated herein) demonstrated that poryclonal rabbit anti-murine IL-17<br>
antibody, administered either at the onset or at a later stage of murine CIA, ameliorated<br>
clinical signs of arthritis.<br>
In the CIA model, mice given a single injection of rat anti-murine IL-17 IgG2a<br>
mAb intraperitoneally (8mg/kg R&amp;D, MAB421 clone 50104.11) show significantly lower<br>
clinical scores than mice injected with 16 mg/kg control IgG2a. The acute phase<br><br>
reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), is an accepted index of disease activity in RA patients.<br>
Similar to CRP, murine serum amyloid protein (SAP) serves as an indicator of disease in<br>
the murine CIA model (Bliven, M., et al, Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism, 29:1131-1138,1986).<br>
In animals treated with 8 mg/kg of anti-murine IL-17, SAP levels were significantly<br>
lower than in those treated with control antibody. Moreover, the decrease in clinical<br>
scores and SAP values are comparable to an anti-mouse IL-1β group (8 mg/kg) used as a<br>
positive control. Finally, significant reduction in synovial inflammation at 8mg/kg<br>
antibody and bone resorption at 16 mg/kg antibody is present compared to that of mice<br>
treated with control antibody. A dose response study may be conducted in the CIA model<br>
with anti-murine IL-17 antibody (e.g., at 0.1, 1 and 8 mg/kg). The clinical scores for rat<br>
anti-murine IL-17 display a trend for dose responsiveness. A similar assay may be<br>
performed in cynomolgus monkeys as a model for RA using an antibody of the invention.<br>
Example 14 Anti-IL-17 mAb Purification<br>
A vector expressing a mAb of the invention is stably incorporated into an<br>
appropriate host cell, (e.g., CHO DG44 (dhfr-) cells (Chasin) or NSO cells) using<br>
standard procedures and purified using Protein A affinity column. Briefly, clarified<br>
conditioned media is applied to a 5 ml HiTrap rProtein A Sepharose FF column<br>
(Amersham Biosciences) that has been equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4). The column is<br>
washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 110 cm/hr to wash<br>
out nonspecific binding components. The bound antibody is eluted using a linear pH<br>
gradient (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 to 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 2.5).<br>
The main protein peak in the elution is collected and its pH adjusted to neutrality with 1<br>
M Tris buffer (pH 8.5). The protein pool is concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml using 10K<br>
Vivaspin membrane (Vivasciences) and sterile filtered (0.45 μm) before storage at 4°C.<br>
For large preparations of a mAb of the invention, the cell free concentrate is<br>
purified over three sequential chromatography columns (Protein A, Anion Exchange, and<br>
Hydrophobic Interaction chromatography). The purity of the mAb after these<br>
chromatography steps is greater than 99% as assessed by analytical size exclusion<br>
chromatography. The mAb is exchanged into a buffer as listed below depending upon the<br>
concentration of the antibody. Chemical stability results indicate a preferred pH between<br>
6.0 and 7.0 (inclusive); although for 20 mg/ml preparations, the pH may be between 5.5<br><br>
and 7.0 (inclusive, e.g., 5.5., 5.6,5.7., 5.8,5.9,6.0,6.1,6.2, 6.3,6.4,6.5, 6.6,6.7, 6.8,6.,<br>
or 7.0). For lyophilized product, a sodium chloride level of 90-30 mM (90,85, 80,75,<br>
70, 65, 60,55, 50,45,40,35 or 30 mM or any value between 30 and 90 mM) is<br>
preferred, while for a liquid formulation (e.g., to be administered subcutaneously) a<br>
sodium chloride level of 100 - 150 mM (100,110,120,130,140, or 150 mM or any value<br>
between 100 and 150 mM) is preferred. The product is then concentrated to a final<br>
concentration of about 10,20 or 25 nag/ml (alternatively higher, 30,40, 50,60, 70, 80,90,<br>
100, 110, 120,130, 140,150 mg/ml or higher) and sterile filtered. The filtered product<br>
may be immediately frozen at -70°C or may be lyophilized. A minimal weight ratio of<br>
1:2 for antibody to lyoprotectant, (e.g., sucrose or trehalose) is needed for stable<br>
lyophilized formulation but is not required for a liquid formulation. Additionally, 0.02%<br>
surfactant (w/v), i.e., polysorbate-80, is added for both solution formulations and<br>
solutions to be lyophilized. The lyophilized material is resuspended in sterile Water for<br>
Injection or sterile 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration.<br><br>
Serum pharmacokinetics of antibodies of the invention (e.g., mAb 126 and 121<br>
[IgG4 Fc region with Fab 126 or 121 respectively]) are determined after intravenous or<br>
subcutaneous administration in male cynomolgus monkeys. Concentrations of the<br>
antibodies in the serum are determined using a standard antigen-capture ELJSA assay in<br>
which plates are coated with human IL-17 and bound serum antibody is detected using an<br>
anti-IgG4 secondary antibody. Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg, mAb<br>
126 is eliminated with a mean half-life of 6.5 days and mAb 121 is eliminated with a<br>
mean half-life of about 11 days. Following subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg,<br><br>
mAb 126 has a mean elimination half-life of 10.3 days and mAb 121 has a mean<br>
elimination half-life of 13 days.<br>
Example 16 Tumor Xenograft Model<br>
To establish tumor xenograft models with which to test the antitumor activity of<br>
anti-IL-17 antibodies of the invention, 5 million HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells are<br>
mixed with Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the left flank of 56-week-old<br>
female athymic (nu/nu) mice ( Charles River laboratories, Wilmington. MA). Mice are<br>
treated by subcutaneous injection every 7 days with control antibodies (e.g., human IgG4<br>
and mouse IgG1), 4 mg/kg anti-human-IL-17, 8 mg/kg anti-mouse IL-17, or combination<br>
of 4 mg/kg anti-human-IL-17 and 8 mg/kg anti-mouse-IL-17 for 4 weeks. The first<br>
antibody administration starts one day prior to implanting the cells. Tumors are measured<br>
twice each week with a caliper and body weight is monitored twice a week. Plasma is<br>
collected from each mouse at day 34 and KC levels are measured using a KC ELISA kit<br>
according to manufacturer's instructions (R&amp;D System). In comparison with control<br>
IgG-injected mice, mice treated with the combination of anti-human IL-17 antibody and<br>
anti-mouse-IL-17 antibody have significantly reduced tumor volume. Furthermore, mice<br>
treated with both anti-human IL17 antibody and anti-mouse IL17 antibody have<br>
dramatically decreased plasma KC. The mice treated with either 4 mg/kg anti-human<br>
IL17 antibody or 8 mg/kg anti-mouse IL 1 7 antibody revealed no significant reduction in<br>
tumor volumes and plasma KC levels. Data are shown in Tables 12 and 13 herein.<br>
To measure IL17 level in the tumors, the tumors from mouse xenograft models are<br>
prepared largely as described in Example 9. For protein measurement, tumor lysates are<br>
diluted 1:10 in TPER + IX Halt in a polypropylene 96-well dilution plate. Protein<br>
concentration is determined by using the microplate protocol of the Coomassie Plus<br>
Protein Assay (Pierce #23236). BSA standard is diluted in TPER + Halt IL-17 protein<br>
levels are determined using human and mouse IL-17 ELISA kits from R&amp;D System as<br>
per manufacturer's instructions (human IL-17 DuoSet ELISA, R+D Systems, Cat<br>
#DY317; mouse IL-17 ELISA, R+D System, Cat # 421). Both human sad mouse IL-17<br>
were increased in tumors from HCT116 and HT29 colon tumor xenograft models as<br>
compared to H460 lung tumor xenograft model.<br><br><br><br>
