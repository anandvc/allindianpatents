				<td>Improved N4 Chelator Conjugates.<br>
Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to improved conjugates of tetra-amine chelators with biological targeting molecules, suitable for forming metal complexes with the radiometal 99mTc. The radiometal complexes are useful as 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals. Kits and precursors are also provided.<br>
Background to the Invention.<br>
US 5489425 (Dow Chemical) discloses a range of open-chain and macrocyclic functionalised tetra-amine chelators useful for the complexation of metals, in particular radioactive and non-radioactive rhodium complexes, especially 105Rh or lmRh radiometal complexes. Specific tetramines disclosed include:<br><br>
HN<br>
[!inker]-NH2<br><br>
NH2<br>
[Linker]	Compound<br>
-CH2[&gt;-phenylene]-	BA-2,3,2-tet<br>
-|&gt;phenylene]-	AN-2,3,2-tet<br>
-(CH2)3-	PA-2,3,2-tet<br>
The bifunctional chelators are described as useful for conjugation with monoclonal antibodies, or fragments thereof, for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. US 5489425 discloses (Examples 21, 22a and 23) that the antibody-radiometal complex chelator conjugate is prepared by first forming the 105Rli metal complex, then reaction with the antibody followed by purification. US 5489425 is silent on antibody-chelator conjugates which are uncomplexed, ie. without a coordinated radiometal. US 5489425 does not teach how to differentiate the pendant amine from the four amines of the<br><br>
chelator in such antibody conjugation reactions. US 5489425 states that the bifunctional chelators "would also be useful in complexing technetium and rhenium", but does not disclose how this would be achieved or any actual technetium complexes.<br>
US 5650134 discloses somatostatin peptide-chelator conjugate of a range of chelators. Example 1 describes the conjugation to a 6-0?-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazaundecane to an octreotide peptide.<br>
EP 1181936 Al discloses bombesin (ie. tetradecapeptide) conjugates of tetra-amine<br>
chelators, prepared using the bifunctional chelators BBN-1 and BBN-2, and the yymTc complexes thereof:<br><br>
O<br>
CO,H<br>
Boc<br>
Boc<br>
Boc<br><br>
NH   NH<br>
Boc  Boc<br>
BBN-2 where Boc = fert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group.<br>
The 99mTc complexes are said to exhibit rapid clearance from the murine body via the kidneys and urinary system. EP 1181936 Al does not, however, provide any disclosure or reference to the synthesis of BBN-1 or BBN-2, only to the step where they are conjugated to the N-terminus of bombesin. The conjugation of BBN-2 to bombesin and 99mTc labelling to give a potential tumour imaging radiopharmaceutical has also been described by Nock et al [BurJ.Nucl.Med,, 30(2), 247-258 (2003)]. The 99mTc complex is said to impart improved hydrophilicity compared to prior art bombesin-chelate conjugates, and hence be expected to favour excretion via the kidneys and urinary system.<br>
The conjugation of BBN-1 to octreotide and 99mTc labelling to give a potential tumour imaging radiopharmaceutical has been described by Maina et al for human patients [Eur.J.Nucl.Med., 30(9), 1211-1219 (2003)]. Neither of the above BBN-1 or BBN-2 publications provide any synthesis of BBN-1 or BBN-2.<br>
The Present Invention.<br>
The present invention provides tetra-amine chelator conjugates with biological targeting moieties, linked via a linker group and technetium complexes thereof as radiopharmaceuticals. The linker group is such that the chelator is mono-functionalised at the bridgehead position and provides both flexibility and a lack or aryl groups, to minimise lipophilicity and steric bulk. Suitably protected versions of the chelators are provided, which permit conjugation with a wide range of targeting molecules without interfering reactions with the amine nitrogens of the tetra-amine chelator. Syntheses of the functionalised chelators are described, together with bifunctional chelate precursors.<br>
Radiopharmaceutical compositions comprising the technetium metal complexes of the invention are described, together with non-radioactive kits for the preparation of such radiopharmaceuticals.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
In a first embodiment, the present invention provides a cationic 99mTc technetium<br>
complex of Formula (I):<br><br>
X is -MR-, -C02-, -CO-, -NR(C=S)-, -NR(OO)-, -CONR-<br>
or a Q group;<br>
each Y is independently a D- or L- ammo acid, -CH2-, -CH2OCH2- or -OCH2CH2O- or an X group; Z is a synthetic biological targeting moiety; n is an integer of value 1 to 8; m is an integer of value 0 to 30;<br>
R is H, CM alkyl, C^ alkoxyalkyl, CM hydroxyalkyl, or CM fluoroalkyl; Qis is a counterion;<br>
with the proviso that the X1-(Y)m chain of atoms lacks bonds in which one heteroatom is directly bonded to another.<br>
The technetium radioisotope may be a y-emitter, such as 99mTc or a positron emitter suitable for PET imaging such as 94mTc. Preferably the technetium radioisotope is 99niTc or 94mTc, most preferably it is 99raTc.<br>
X is preferably -CONR-, -NR(C=O)- or a Q group. X is most preferably -CONR- or -NR(C=O)-, with -CONH- and -NH(C=0)- being especially preferred.<br>
The liiiker group -(CH2)n-X-(Y)m- of Formula I is chosen such that the X]-(Y)m chain of atoms lacks bonds in which one heteroatom is directly bonded to another, where the term "heteroatom" means a non-carbon atom such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. This means that the chain lacks bonds such as O-O, N-N or O-N.<br>
It is envisaged that the role of the linker group ~(CH2)n-X-(Y)m- of Formula I is to distance the technetium complex from the active binding site of the biological targeting moiety (Z) in vivo. This helps ensure that the relatively bulky technetium complex does not sterically inhibit binding to active sites in vivo. The alkylene group<br>
),,- has the advantage that there are no significant nyorogen oonomg HUM actions with the conjugated biological targeting moiety (Z), so that the linker does not wrap round onto Z. Preferred alkylene groups have n = 1 to 6, most preferably 2 to 4, with 2 being especially preferred.<br>
The linker groups of the present invention lack aryl rings. This helps minimise the lipophilicity of the technetium complex plus linker group which is attached to the biological targeting moiety (Z) of the conjugate. The steric bulk and molecular weight of the linker group (and hence technetium. complex) is also tninirnised, whilst flexibility of the linkage is maintained.<br>
The nature of the linker group can also be used to modify the biodistribution of the imaging agent. Thus, eg. the introduction of ether groups in -(Y)m- will help to minimise plasma protein binding. When. -(Y)m- comprises a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) building block or a pep tide chain of 1 to 10 amino acid residues, the linker group may function to modify the pharmacokinetics and blood clearance rates of the imaging agent in vivo. Such "biomodifier" linker groups may accelerate the clearance of the technetium imaging agent from background tissue, such as muscle or liver, and/or from the blood, thus giving a better diagnostic image due to less background interference. A biomodifier linker group may also be used to favour a particular route of excretion, eg. via the kidneys as opposed to via the liver. Alternatively, they may prolong the blood residence time, allowing more agent to accumulate at the target site in vivo,<br>
When -(Y)m- comprises a peptide chain of amino acid residues, the amino acid residues are preferably chosen from glycine, lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid or serine. The number of amino acids in the peptide chain is preferably 1 to 10, most preferably 1 to 3.<br>
When -(Y)m- comprises a PEG moiety, it preferably comprises a group of formula (-OCfLCH^O-Xv where w is an integer of value 3 to 25. The integer w is preferably 6 to 22. An especially preferred PEG-containing -(Y)m- group is a unit derived from polymerisation of the monodisperse PEG-like structure, 17-amino-5-oxo-6-aza-3, 9, 12, 15-tetraoxaheptadecanoic acid of (Formula Remove) <br><br><br><br>
wherein p is an integer from 1 to 10.<br>
By the term 'fluoroallcyl' is meant an allcyl group with at least one fluorine substituent, ie. the term encompasses groups from monofluoroalkyl (eg. -CEy?) to perfluoroalkyl (eg. CF3).<br>
The -(Y)m- group preferably comprises a diglycolic acid moiety, a maleimide moiety, a glutaric acid, succinic acid, a polyethyleneglycol based unit or a PEG-like unit of Formula IV.<br>
By the term "synthetic" is meant the conventional meaning of the term ie. man-made as opposed to being isolated from natural sources eg. from the mammalian body. Such compounds have the advantage that their manufacture and impurity profile can be fully controlled. Monoclonal antibodies and fragments thereof are therefore outside the scope of the present claims.<br>
By the term "biological targeting moiety" is meant: 3-100 mer peptides or peptide analogues which may be linear peptides or cyclic peptides or combinations thereof; or enzyme substrates, antagonists or inhibitors; synthetic receptor-binding compounds; oligonucleotides, or oligo-DNA or oligo-RNA fragments.<br>
By the term "cyclic peptide" is meant a sequence of 5 to 15 ammo acids in which the two terminal amino acids are bonded together by a covalent bond which may be a peptide or disulphide bond or a synthetic non-peptide bond such as a thioether, phosphodiester, disiloxane or urethane bond. By the term "amino acid" is meant an L- or D-amino acid, amino acid analogue or amino acid mimetic which may be optically pure, i.e. a single enantiomer and hence chiral, or a mixture of enantiomers. Preferably the amino acids of the present invention are optically pure. By the term "amino acid mimetic" is meant synthetic analogues of naturally occurring amino acids<br><br>
which are isosteres, i.e. have been designed to mimic the steric and electronic structure of the natural compound. Such isosteres are well known to those skilled in the art and include but are not limited to depsipeptides, retro-inverso peptides, thioamides, cycloalkanes or 1,5-disubstituted tetrazoles [see M. Goodman, Biopolymers, 24, 137, (1985)].<br>
Suitable peptides for use in the present invention include:<br>
-	somatostatin, octreotide and analogues,<br>
-	peptides which bind to the ST receptor, where ST refers to the heat-stable<br>
toxin produced by E.coli and other micro-organisms;<br>
-	laminin fragments eg. YIGSR, PDSGR, IKVAV, LRE and<br>
KCQAGTFALRGDPQG,<br>
-	N-formyl peptides for targeting sites of leucocyte accumulation,<br>
-	Platelet factor 4 (PF4) and fragments thereof,<br>
-	ROD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-containing peptides, which may eg. target<br>
angiogenesis [R.Pasqualini etal., Nat Biotechnol. 1997 Jun;15(6):542-6];<br>
[E. Ruoslahti, Kidney Int. 1997 May;51(5):1413-7].<br>
-	peptide fragments of ot,2-antiplasmin, fibronectin or beta-casein, fibrinogen<br>
or thrombospondin. The ammo acid sequences of (X2-antiplasmin,<br>
fibronectin, beta-casein, fibrinogen and thrombospondin can be found in<br>
the following references: a2-antiplasmin precursor [M.Tone et al.,<br>
J.Biochem, 102, 1033, (1987)]; beta-casein [L.Hansson et al, Gene, 139,<br>
193, (1994)]; fibronectin [A.Gutman et al, FEES Lett., 207, 145, (1996)];<br>
thrombospondin-1 precursor [V.Dixit et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL, USA,<br>
83, 5449, (1986)]; R.F.Doolittle, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 53, 195, (1984);<br>
-	peptides which are substrates or inhibitors of angiotensin, such as:<br>
angiotensin II Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe (E. C. Jorgensen et al, J.<br>
Med. Chem., 1979, Vol 22, 9, 1038-1044)<br>
[Sar, He] Angiotensin II: Sar-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Ile (R.K. Turker et al., Science, 1972, 177, 1203).<br>
-	Angiotensin I:       Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu.<br><br>
Preferably the peptides of the present invention comprise antiplasmin or angiotensin H<br>
peptides. Antiplasmin peptides comprise an arnino acid sequence taken from the N-<br>
terminus of:<br>
(i)       oti-antiplasniin,<br>
i.e. NH2-Asn-Ghi-Glu-Gln-Val-Ser-Pro-Leu-Tlir-Leu-Thr-Leu-Leu-Lys-OH<br>
or variants of this in which one or more amino acids have been exchanged, added or<br>
removed such as:<br>
NH2-Asn-Gln-Glu-Gln-Val-Ser-Pro-Leu-Thr-Leu-Thr-Leu-Leu-Lys-Gly-OH,<br>
NH2-Asn-Ghi-Glu-Ala-Val-Ser-Pro-Leu-Thr-Leu-Thr-Leu-Leu-Lys-Gly-OH,<br>
NH2-Asn-Gln-Glu-Ghi-Val-Gly-OH; or<br>
(ii) casein<br>
ie. Ac-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gly-Gm-Ser-Lys-Val-Ile-Gly.<br>
Synthetic peptides of the present invention maybe obtained by conventional solid phase synthesis, as described in P. Lloyd-Williams, F. Albericio and E. Girald; Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins, CRC Press, 1997.<br>
Suitable enzyme substrates, antagonists or inhibitors include glucose and glucose analogues such as fluorodeoxyglucose; fatty acids, or elastase, Angiotensin II or metalloproteinase inhibitors. A preferred non-peptide Angiotensin II antagonist is Losartan.<br>
Suitable synthetic receptor-binding compounds include estradiol, estrogen, progestin, progesterone and other steroid hormones; ligands for the dopamine D-l or D-2 receptor, or dopamine transporter such as tropanes; and ligands for the serotonin receptor.<br>
The biological targeting moiety (Z) is preferably of molecular weight of less than 5000, most preferably less than 4000, ideally less than 3000. This has the advantage that the improved biological characteristics of the tetra-amine technetium complexes of the invention can have an influence on the overall biodistribution, particularly the clearance, of the technetium complex of the conjugate of Formula I. When n is 3, and X comprises a nitrogen atom directly bonded to the (CEb),, group, then Z is chosen to<br><br>
be both synthetic and having a molecular weight of less than 4000. Preferred biological targeting moieties are 3-20 mer peptides or enzyme substrates, enzyme antagonists or enzyme inhibitors.<br>
The counterion (A^) represents an anion which is present in a molar equivalent amount, thus balancing the positive charge on the Tc(V) dioxo technetium complex of Formula I. The anion (A) is suitably singly- or multiply-charged, as long as a charge-balancing amount is present. The anion is suitably derived from an inorganic or organic acid. Examples of suitable anions include: halide ions such as chloride or bromide, sulphate, nitrate, citrate, acetate, phosphate and borate. Preferred anions are chloride.<br>
The technetium complexes of Formula I have the advantage that they are stable after complex formation, and comprise an avid cheland which binds technetium preferentially to the biological targeting moiety. The technetium complex is consequently unlikely to undergo transchelation reactions with biological macromolecules or competing ligands in vivo. The technetium complexes are small and compact which is useful hi having minimal steric impact on the conjugated biological targeting moiety (Z). The permanent cationic change and the Tc(V) dioxo core means that the complexes are also hydrophilic, and hence unlikely to be distributed intracellularly into other compartments, with consequently more rapid clearance from background organs and tissues in vivo, eg. from the bloodstream.<br>
The technetium complexes of Formula I may be prepared by reaction of a suitable source of technetium with a chelator conjugate of Formula II, as described in the second embodiment below.<br>
In a second embodiment, the present invention provides a chelator conjugate of Formula II:<br>
where: X, Y, Z, n and m are as defined above;<br>
Q1 to Q6 are independently Q groups, where Q is H or an amine protecting group.<br>
le chelator conjugates are useful in the preparation of the technetium complexes of irmula I of the first embodiment.<br>
„/ the term "protecting group" is meant a group which inhibits or suppresses undesirable chemical reactions, but which is designed to be sufficiently reactive that it maybe cleaved from the functional group in question under mild enough conditions that do not modify the rest of the molecule. After deprotection the desired product is obtained. Amine protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art and are suitably chosen from: Boc (where Boc is terf-butyloxycarbonyl), Fmoc (where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl), trifluoroacetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, Dde [i.e. l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl] orNpys (i.e. 3-nitro-2-pyridine sulfenyl). In some instances, the nature of the protecting group may be such that both the Q!/Q2 or Q5/Q6 groups, ie. there is no NH bond on the associated amine nitrogen atom. The use of further protecting groups are described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', Theorodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991). Preferred amine protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc, most preferably Boc. When Boc is used, Q1 and Q6 are both H, and Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5 are each tert-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
In Formula II, the amine protecting groups are employed primarily to protect the amine functional groups of the tetra-amine chelator during the synthetic chemistry prior to complexation with the technetium. When the biological targeting group (Z) is susceptible to reaction with primary and/or secondary amines, however, these protecting groups may also be useful to prevent undesirable chemical reactions between the chelator amines and Z before complexation with technetium.<br>
Preferred conjugates of Formula n have at least one of the amine nitrogens unprotected (ie. one of Q3 or Q4 is H, or both Q!/Q2 or Q5/Q6 are H). One or more free amine groups means that the conjugate is more readily soluble hi aqueous media, which is the preferred solvent for the preparation of the technetium complex of Formula I. A free amine group also means that complexation with technetium is more rapid, since complexation is not dependant on prior removal of a protecting group, which would also prevent metal complexation. When the conjugated biological targeting group (Z) is not susceptible to further reaction with amines, it is convenient to use the conjugate of Formula II in the fully deprotected form (ie. each of Q1 to Q6 is H), and this is an especially preferred chelator conjugate of Formula II. The fully deprotected form is preferred for the complexation reaction to give the technetium complex of Formula I.<br>
The technetium complexes of Formula I of the present invention may be prepared by reaction of a solution of the radiometal in the appropriate oxidation state with the chelator conjugate of Formula II at the appropriate pH. The solution may optionally contain a ligand which complexes weakly to the technetium (such as gluconate or citrate) i.e. the technetium complex is prepared by ligand exchange or transchelation. Such conditions are often useful to suppress undesirable side reactions such as hydrolysis of the technetium ion, but are less important with the chelators of the present invention, since they complex rapidly with technetium. When the radioisotope is 99mTc, the usual starting material is sodium pertechnetate from a 99Mo generator. Technetium is present in 99mTc-pertechnetate in the Tc(VII) oxidation state, which is relatively unreactive. The preparation of technetium complexes of lower oxidation state Tc(I) to Tc(V) therefore usually requires the addition of a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable reducing agent such as sodium dithionite, sodium<br>
bisulphite, ascorbic acid, formamidine sulphinic acid, starmous ion, Fe(ET) or Cu(I), to facilitate complexation. The pharmaceutically acceptable reducing agent is preferably a starmous salt, most preferably stannous chloride, staunous fluoride or starmous tartrate.<br>
The chelator conjugates of Formula II may be prepared by conjugation of the biological targeting molecule (Z) with a bifunctional chelator of Formula III, as is described in the fifth embodiment below.<br>
hi a third embodiment, the present invention provides a radiopharmaceutical which comprises the technetium complex of the first embodiment, wherein A is a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion, together with a biocompatible carrier in a form suitable for human administration.<br>
By the phrase "in a form suitable for human administration" is meant a composition which is sterile, pyrogen-free, lacks compounds which produce toxic or adverse effects, and is formulated at a biocompatible pH (approximately pH 4.0 to 10.5). Such compositions lack particulates which could risk causing emboli in vivo, and are formulated so that precipitation does not occur on contact with biological fluids (eg. blood). Such compositions also contain only biologically compatible excipients, and are preferably isotonic.<br>
The "biocompatible carrier" is a fluid, especially a liquid, in which the radiopharmaceutical is suspended or preferably dissolved, such that the composition is physiologically tolerable, ie. can be administered to the mammalian body without toxicity or undue discomfort. The biocompatible carrier is suitably an injectable carrier liquid such as sterile, pyrogen-free water for injection; an aqueous solution such as saline (which may advantageously be balanced so that the final product for injection is either isotonic or not hypotonic); an aqueous solution of one or more tonicity-adjusting substances (eg. salts of plasma cations with biocompatible counterions), sugars (e.g. glucose or sucrose), sugar alcohols (eg. sorbitol or mannitol), glycols (eg. glycerol), or other non-ionic polyol materials (eg. polyethyleneglycols, propylene glycols and the like).<br>
By the term "pharmaceutically acceptable counterion" is meant an anion (i.e. a negative ion) which does not produce toxic or adverse effects when administered to the mammalian body in vivo, and is compatible chemically and/or toxicologically with the other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition. Chemical compatibility for the technetium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention means that the anion does not compete effectively with the tetra-amine chelator for the technetium. Suitable such anions include, but are not limited to: halides (e.g., chloride, iodide, and bromide); Q-2 alkylsulfonates (e.g., mesylate or ethylsulfonate); arylsulfonates (e.g. phenylsulfonate or tosylate); Q-2 alkylphosphonates; di(Ci_2)alkylphosphates (e.g., dimethylphosphate, diethylphosphate, or diglycerol phosphate); arylphosphonates; arylphosphates; alkylaxylphosphonates; alkylarylphosphates; Ci-2 alkylcarboxylates (e.g. acetates, propionates, glutamates or glycerates); arylcarboxylates (eg. benzoates), and the like. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable counterions are: chloride, fluoride, acetate, tartrate, hydroxide and phosphate.<br>
Such radiopharmaceuticals are suitably supplied in either a container which is provided with a seal which is suitable for single or multiple puncturing with a hypodermic needle (e.g. a crimped-on septum seal closure) whilst maintaining sterile integrity. Such containers may contain single or multiple patient doses. Preferred multiple dose containers comprise a single bulk vial (e.g. of 10 to 30 cm3 volume) which contains multiple patient doses, whereby single patient doses can thus be withdrawn into clinical grade syringes at various time intervals during the viable lifetime of the preparation to suit the clinical situation. Pre-filled syringes are designed to contain a single human dose, and are therefore preferably a disposable or other syringe suitable for clinical use. The pre-filled syringe may optionally be provided with a syringe shield to protect the operator from radioactive dose. Suitable such radiopharmaceutical syringe shields are known in the art and preferably comprise either lead or tungsten.<br>
Preferred radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprise the technetium radioisotopes 99mTc or 94mTc, most preferably 99mTc. When the technetium isotope is 99mTc, a radioactivity content suitable for a diagnostic imaging radiopharmaceutical is in the range 180 to 1500 MBq of 99mTc, depending on the site to be imaged in vivo, the uptake and the target to background ratio.<br>
The technetium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention maybe prepared by various methods:<br>
(i)       aseptic manufacture techniques in which the technetium complex<br>
formation described above for the second embodiment is carried out in a<br>
clean room environment; (ii)      terminal sterilisation, in which the technetium complex formation is<br>
carried out without using aseptic manufacture and then sterilised at the last<br>
step (eg. by gamma irradiation or autoclaving); (iii)     kit methodology in which a sterile, lyophilized non-radioactive kit<br>
formulation comprising the chelator conjugate of Formula n and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable reductant is reacted with plus other optional<br>
excipients is reacted with an aliquot of sterile 99mTc-pertechnetate from a<br>
99mTc generator.<br>
Method (iii) is preferred, and kits for use in this method are described in the fourth ambodinient (below).<br>
[n a fourth embodiment, the present invention provides a non-radioactive kit for the preparation of the radiopharmaceutical composition described above, which comprises the conjugate of Formula (II), together with a biocompatible reductant. Such kits are designed to give sterile radiopharmaceutical products suitable for human administration., e.g. via direct injection into the bloodstream. The ligand conjugates, and preferred aspects thereof, are described in the second embodiment above.<br>
For 99mTc, the kit is preferably lyophilised and is designed to be reconstituted with sterile 99mTc-pertechnetate (TcCV) from a 99mTc radioisotope generator to give a solution suitable for human administration without further manipulation. Suitable kits comprise a container (eg. a septum-sealed vial) containing the chelator conjugate in either free base or acid salt form, together with a biocompatible reductant such as sodium dithionite, sodium bisulphite, ascorbic acid, formamidine sulphinic acid, stannous ion, Fe(II) or Cu(I). The biocompatible reductant is preferably a stannous salt such as stannous chloride or stannous tartrate. Alternatively, the kit may optionally contain a non-radioactive metal complex which, upon addition of the technetium, undergoes transmetallation (i.e. metal exchange) giving the desired product.<br><br>
The non-radioactive kits may optionally further comprise additional components such as a transchelator, radioprotectant, antimicrobial preservative, pH-adjusting agent or filler. The "transchelator" is a compound which reacts rapidly to form a weak complex with technetium, then is displaced by the chelator. This minimises the risk of formation of reduced hydrolysed technetium (RHT) due to rapid reduction of pertechnetate competing with technetium complexation. Suitable such transchelators are salts of a weak organic acid, ie. an organic acid having a pKa in the range 3 to 7, with a biocornpatible cation. By the term "biocompatible cation" is meant a positively charged counterfoil which forms a salt with an ionised, negatively charged anionic group, where said positively charged counterion is also non-toxic and hence suitable for administration to the mammalian body, especially the human body. Examples of suitable biocompatible cations include: the alkali metals sodium or potassium; the alkaline earth metals calcium and magnesium; and the ammonium ion. Preferred biocompatible cations are sodium and potassium, most preferably sodium. Suitable such weak organic acids are acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, gluconic acid, glucoheptonic acid, benzoic acid, phenols or phosphonic acids. Hence, suitable salts are acetates, citrates, tartrates, gluconates, glucoheptonates, benzoates, phenolates or phosphonates. Preferred such salts are tartrates, gluconates, glucoheptonates, benzoates, or phosphonates, most preferably phosphonates, most especially diphosphonates. A preferred such transchelator is a salt of MDP, ie. methylenediphosphonic acid, with a biocompatible cation.<br>
By the term "radioprotectant" is meant a compound which inhibits degradation reactions, such as redox processes, by trapping highly-reactive free radicals, such as oxygen-containing free radicals arising from the radiolysis of water. The radioprotectants of the present invention are suitably chosen from: ascorbic acid, /wra-aminobenzoic acid (ie. 4-aminobenzoic acid), gentisic acid (ie. 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) and salts thereof with a biocompatible cation as described above.<br>
By the term "antimicrobial preservative" is meant an agent which inhibits the growth of potentially harmful micro-organisms such as bacteria, yeasts or moulds. The antimicrobial preservative may also exhibit some bactericidal properties, depending on the dose. The main role of the antimicrobial preservative(s) of the present<br>
invention is to inhibit the growth of any such micro-organism in the radiopharmaceutical composition post-reconstitution, ie. in the radioactive diagnostic product itself. The antimicrobial preservative may, however, also optionally be used to inhibit the growth of potentially harmful micro-organisms in one or more components of the non-radioactive kit of the present invention prior to reconstitution. Suitable antimicrobial preservative(s) include: the parabens, ie. methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl paraben or mixtures thereof; benzyl alcohol; phenol; cresol; cetrimide and thiomersal. Preferred antimicrobial preservative(s) are the parabens.<br>
The term "pH-adjusting agent" means a compound or mixture of compounds useful to ensure that the pH of the reconstituted kit is within acceptable limits (approximately pH 4.0 to 10.5) for human or mammalian administration. Suitable such pH-adjusting agents include pharmaceutically acceptable buffers, such as tricine, phosphate or TRIS [ie. ^rzXhydroxymethyl)aminomethane], and pharmaceutically acceptable bases such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or mixtures thereof. When the conjugate is employed in acid salt form, the pH adjusting agent may optionally be provided in a separate vial or container, so that the user of the kit can adjust the pH as part of a multi-step procedure.<br>
By the term "filler" is meant a pharmaceutically acceptable bulking agent which may facilitate material handling during production and lyophilisation. Suitable such fillers include inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, and water soluble sugars or sugar alcohols such as sucrose, maltose, mannitol or trehalose.<br>
In a fifth embodiment, the present invention provides a compound of Formula IE:<br>
E is a functional group suitable for conjugation to the biological targeting moiety (Z) of the first embodiment; with the provisos that: (i)       when n = 3, then at least one of Q1 to Q6 is an amine protecting<br>
group; (ii)      whenn = 3 or 5,E is not OH.<br>
The compound of Formula HI is a "bifunctional chelator", ie. a chelating agent with one or more functional groups (E) attached. The functional group E is suitable for conjugation to the biological targeting moiety (Z). Suitable such functional groups (E) include: amine, thiocyanate, maleimide and active esters. E preferably does not comprise an unactivated hydroxyl (-OH) group. By the term "active ester" is meant an ester derivative of the carboxylic acid which is designed to be a better leaving group, and hence permit more facile reaction with nucleophiles present on the biological targeting moiety such as amines. Examples of suitable active esters are: N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), pentafluorophenol, pentafluorothiophenol, para-nitrophenol, hydroxybenzotriazole and PyBOP (ie. benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate). Preferred active esters are N-hydroxysuccinimide or pentafluorophenol esters.<br>
E is preferably primary amine (-NH2), -CO2M, -NCS, -NCO, maleimide or acrylamide, where M is H, a cation, a protecting group or an active ester. E is most preferably -NH2, -CO2M or maleimide, ideally-NH2 or -CO2M.<br>
The compound of Formula El is reacted with suitable counterpart functional groups on the biological targeting molecule (Z) to form the desired conjugate of Formula II. Such suitable functional groups on the biological targeting molecule include:<br>
carboxyls (for amide bond formation with an amine-functionalised bifunctional<br>
chelator);<br>
amines (for amide bond formation with an carboxyl- or active ester-functionalised<br>
bifunctional chelator);<br>
halogens, mesylates and tosylates (for N-alkylation of an amine-functionalised<br>
bifunctional chelator) and<br>
thiols (for reaction with a maleimide-functionalised bifunctional chelator).<br>
When E is a group (eg. an active ester) which is designed to react with an amine group of the biological targeting molecule (Z), clearly there is a potential for undesirable side reactions with the amines of the chelator. For such E groups, Q1 to Q6 in Formula III are preferably chosen to be nitrogen protecting groups such that each of the four amine nitrogen atoms of the tetra-amine chelator are protected. When E is an amine group, it is clearly important that reaction with the biological targeting molecule (Z) occurs only at the E amine, and not at the amine nitrogen atoms of the tetra-amine chelator. In that situation also therefore, Q1 to Q6 in Formula in are preferably nitrogen protecting groups. Nitrogen protecting groups, and preferred examples thereof, are described in the second embodiment (above).<br>
The compounds of Formula III may be prepared as described in Schemes 1 and 2. Scheme 1 provides a flexible synthetic route to carboxy-functionalised, N-protected tetra-amine chelators, which can be adapted to a variety of values of n in Formula III. The synthesis of the Boc-protected tetra-amine analogue with a -(CH2)5OH bridgehead substituent has been described by Turpin et al [J.Lab.Comp.Radiopharm., 45, 379-393 (2002)]. Scheme 2 provides a flexible synthetic route to amine-functionalised, N-protected tetra-amine chelators, which can be adapted to a variety of<br>
values of n. The conjugation of biological targeting peptides can be carried in an analogous manner to those described by Nock et al [Eur J.Nucl.Med., 30(2), 247-258 (2003)], and Maina et al [EurJ.Nucl.Med., 30(9), 1211-1219 (2003)].<br>

After complete addition, the mixture was heated gently under reflux at 110 °C for 5 days. During this period some white solid remained. After cooling the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure to leave a white solid to which methanol (50 ml) was added dropwise giving a colourless solution. This solution was heated under reflux for 3 hours, cooled, cone. HC1 (5 ml) added and heating continued under reflux at 70 -75 °C for 48 hours. The solvent was removed to leave a viscous green residue which was co-evaporated with methanol (100 ml x 3) to leave a pale green solid. This solid was redissolved in dry methanol and anhydrous potassium carbonate (4.0 g, 30 mmol) added followed by di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (7.0 g, 32 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours. The inorganic solid was removed by filtration through Celite and solvent evaporated from the filtrate to leave a viscous residue.  This residue was mixed with water (50 ml) and extracted with CEfoQb (50 ml x 3). The organic fractions were combined, dried (MgSQs), filtered and the solvent evaporated to leave a pale yellow residue.<br>
Note: At this point it is convenient to monitor the reaction by 13C NMR. The residue was subjected to chromatography on silica gel using ClkCk/MeOH (95 : 5) as eluent. The title compound eluted with an if =0.41 and was isolated as a colourless viscous oil (Yield 2.5 g, 52%).<br>

Example 8; """Tc Radiolabelling of Compounds 3 to 7.<br>
A lyophilised kit ("Chelakit A plus") containing the following ingredients prepared:<br><br>
was<br><br><br>
25-50 /ig of the compound to be labelled (dissolved in 25-50 jttL solvent) was added to CHELAKIT-A plus, followed by generator eluate (99rnTcO4~ in saline, 1.0 mL). The solution was mixed and left at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.<br>
Compounds 3 and 6 label technetium at room temperature at a pH of 9 to give the corresponding cationic 99mTc complexes in high yield (RCP &gt; 90%). The tetraamine complexes were purified by HPLC (mobile phase: 0.1% TFA in water, 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile; XTERRA RPig 3.5/xm 4.6 x 150mm column) and are stable in 50mM phosphate buffer at 37°C for 2 hours (RCP &gt;95% by HPLC after 2 hours).<br>
Example 9: Measurement ofLipophilicitv (Log?) of the 99mTc Complexes.<br>
The octanol-water partition coefficients (LogP) of the 99mTc complexes of Example 8<br>
were determined as follows:<br>
10 pL of the HPLC-purified 99mTc complex from Example 8 was mixed with 1-<br>
octanol (2ml) and 50mM phosphate buffer (pH=7.4, 2.0 ml) in a centrifuge tube. The<br>
tube was vortexed at room temperature for 1 min and then was centrifuged at high<br>
speed for 60 min. 0.1 ml samples of both phases were pipetted into other test tubes<br>
with adequate care to avoid cross contamination between the phases, and were<br>
counted in a Wallac Wizzard gamma-counter. The measurement was repeated three<br>
times.<br>
The partition coefficient, P, was calculated as follows:<br>
P = (cpm in octanol - cpm background) / (cpm in water - cpm background).<br>
Usually the final partition coefficient value was expressed as log P.<br>
The results are given hi Table 1:<br>
