				<td>A METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A LUTEIN-FATTY ACID ESTER<br>
CONCENTRATE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the<br>
production of a lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate, more<br>
particularly a method of obtaining a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity by purifying marigold oleoresin.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Lutein-fatty acid esters are a yellow-orange pigment<br>
contained in fruits such as oranges, peaches, papayas, prunes<br>
and mangos. Lutein-fatty acid esters are also present in many<br>
flowers and vegetables, particularly in petals of marigold<br>
flowers remarkably. Dried and ground marigold flowers have<br>
been used as animal feeds for a long time, and oleoresin which<br>
is obtained by extraction of marigold flowers with a solvent<br>
has also been widely used as food color in recent years in<br>
addition to the above-mentioned application.<br>
The recent scientific researches have reported that<br>
lutein is associated with risk reduction for age-related<br>
macular degeneration (AMD) caused by oxidative damage to<br>
macular area of retina (Journal of the American Medical<br>
Association, 272, 1413-1420, 1994: Investigative<br>
Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, 38, 1802-1811, 1997, etc.), and<br>
that lutein is effective for prevention of arteriosclerosis.<br>
prevention of cataract or suppression of carcinogenesis and etc.<br>
(British Medical Journal, 305, 335-339, 1992: The American<br>
Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 70, 517-524, 1992: American<br>
Journal of Epidemiology, 149, 801-809, 1999, etc). As such the<br>
use of lutein as a health food and a dietary supplement is also<br>
expected.<br>
Marigold oleoresin is obtained when dried and ground<br>
marigold flowers are extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent such<br>
as hexane and petroleum ether or with a chlorinated hydrocarbon<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane, and the solvent is removed from<br>
the extract. But the content of lutein-fatty acid ester as an<br>
ester contained in oleoresins produced by the largest producers<br>
of marigold extracts is low, usually 14 to 20 % (cf. U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,191,293) , and is about 30 to 35 % even in a superior grade<br>
type which is partly sold for food.<br>
Thus , there has been a demand for a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity in order to obtain more vivid color<br>
tones when it is used as a food color and in order to improve<br>
the functional efficiency when it is used as a dietary<br>
supplement.<br>
As to a method of obtaining a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity, "Purification of Lutein-Fatty Acid<br>
Esters From Plant Materials" (U.S. Patent No. 4,048,203) and<br>
"Trans-xanthophyll Ester Concentrates of Enhanced Purity and<br>
Methods of Making Same" (U.S. Patent No. 6,191,293) have been<br>
disclosed.<br>
The former describes a method which comprises<br>
precipitating lutein-fatty acid esters from oleoresin which is<br>
dissolved in hot alkanol containing not more than four carbon<br>
atoms by cooling the solution, removing alkanol wherefrom by<br>
filtration and drying the lutein-fatty acid ester under vacuum.<br>
However, the purity of the lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate<br>
obtained by this method is 51%, which cannot be considered a<br>
high purity.<br>
The latter describes a method of obtaining a purified<br>
trans-xanthophyll ester by contacting coronals (or flowers) of<br>
marigold flowers with a hydrocarbon solvent, removing wherefrom<br>
plant residue after sufficient extraction, evaporating the<br>
extract to obtain oleoresin, admixing the resulting oleoresin<br>
with an alcohol at ambient temperature and removing the alcohol<br>
containing impurity and cis-xanthophyll ester from the mixture.<br>
By this method, however, the purity of lutein-fatty acid<br>
ester in the resulting oleoresin varies widely depending on the<br>
quality of the raw material, i.e. coronals (or flowers) of<br>
marigold flowers, and therefore, the purity of lutein-fatty<br>
acid ester in a concentrate obtained by purifying the said<br>
oleoresin also varies widely. For this reason, control of the<br>
raw material is necessary to obtain a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity by this method, and as such it is<br>
difficult to stably obtain a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity when most of the commercially<br>
available oleoresins are used as a starting material.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
production method by which a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity can be stably obtained even when<br>
oleoresin containing lutein-fatty acid esters of low purity is<br>
used as a starting material, without being affected by variation<br>
of the quality, particularly the content of lutein-fatty acid<br>
esters, of marigold oleoresin.<br>
The present inventors have found that, as a result of<br>
diligent studies to solve the above-mentioned problems, a<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate of high purity is stably<br>
obtained by dissolving oleoresins in a ketone solvent such as<br>
acetone, cooling the solution, and removing wherefrom an<br>
insoluble component in a ketone solvent such as phospholipid<br>
to uniform the quality of oleoresins, dissolving a ketone<br>
solvent-soluble portion obtained as above in butanol, cooling<br>
the solution, removing a butanol-soluble impurity after adding<br>
or without adding one or more members selected from the group<br>
consisting of water, methanol and ethanol to the solution, and<br>
washing the resulting butanol-insoluble with ethanol. The<br>
present inventors have accomplished the present invention after<br>
further studies based on the finding.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Marigold oleoresin used in the present invention is a<br>
solid or a viscous liquid having yellow-orange/yellowish-brown<br>
color, which is obtained by drying flowers of marigold which<br>
is a member of the Compositae family (Tagetes erecta WILLD.),<br>
grinding the dried product, optionally converting into pellet,<br>
extracting with an organic solvent, usually hexane, and<br>
removing the solvent from the extract. Its main component is<br>
lutein (one of xanthophylls) dipalmitate.<br>
According to the method of the present invention,<br>
marigold oleoresin (also called oleoresin for short) is<br>
dissolved in a ketone solvent. A ketone solvent used here<br>
includes a ketone solvent containing 3 to 9 carbon atoms such<br>
as acetone, methylethylketone and diethylketone, among which<br>
acetone is preferable. The amount of acetone is about 0.5 to<br>
10 parts by weight, preferably about 2 to 3 parts by weight,<br>
relative to 1 part by weight of marigold oleoresin which is the<br>
raw material.<br>
A mixture of oleoresin and acetone is stirred for about<br>
0.5 to 1 hour at about 40 to 55 °C, preferably at about 45 to<br>
50 °C while keeping moderate refluxing. Next the mixture is<br>
slowly cooled to about 10 to 30 °C, preferably about 15 to 25<br>
°C over a period of usually about 2 to 4 hours. The cooled<br>
mixture is filtered through filter paper or filter fabric with<br>
filter aid, if necessary, such as diatomite. The filtrate is<br>
evaporated under reduced pressure and acetone is removed<br>
wherefrom to obtain a solid or a viscous liquid consisting of<br>
acetone-soluble portion in oleoresin.<br>
According to the method of the present invention,<br>
acetone-soluble portion in oleoresin is dissolved in butanol.<br>
Examples of butanol used here are n-butanol, i-butanol.<br>
sec-butanol and tert-butanol. among which n-butanol is<br>
preferable. The amount of butanol is about 1 to 5 parts by<br>
weight, preferably about 2 to 3 parts by weight relative to 1<br>
part by weight of the said soluble portion.<br>
The mixed solution of the said soluble portion and butanol<br>
is stirred for about 0. 5 to 1 hour at about 40 to 80 °C, preferably<br>
at about 45 to 55 °C. Next the mixture is slowly cooled to about<br>
0 to 20 °C, preferably about 3 to 10 °C over a period of usually<br>
about 2 to 5 hours. The cooled mixture is filtered through<br>
filter paper or filter fabric to recover a butanol-insoluble<br>
solid, and the filtrate containing a butanol-soluble impurity<br>
is discarded.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, one or<br>
more solvents selected from the group consisting of water,<br>
methanol, ethanol and a mixture thereof is added, preferably<br>
while stirring, to the above cooled mixture. By adding these<br>
solvent(s), an insoluble solid is precipitated rapidly, by<br>
which operating efficiency can be improved. The amount of water<br>
to be added here is about 0.01 to 1 part by weight, preferably<br>
about 0.05 to 0.5 part by weight relative to 1 part by weight<br>
of the butanol used; the amount of methanol is about 0.01 to<br>
5 parts by weight, preferably about 0.1 to 1 part by weight<br>
relative to 1 part by weight of the butanol used; and the amount<br>
of ethanol is about 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, preferably about<br>
0.5 to 5 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the<br>
butanol used. Although the temperature of solvent(s) to be<br>
added here may be ambient temperature, the same temperature as<br>
the cooled mixture, if possible, is preferable. The mixture<br>
consisting of mixed solvents is filtered through filter paper<br>
or filter fabric to recover a solid which is insoluble in the<br>
mixed solvent, and the filtrate containing a impurity which is<br>
soluble in the mixed solvent is discarded.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, the<br>
butanol-insoluble or the mixed solvent-insoluble wherein<br>
butanol is a main component is washed with ethanol. The amount<br>
of ethanol is about 5 to 80 parts by weight, preferably about<br>
10 to 40 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the<br>
said insoluble. By washing with ethanol, butanol or the mixed<br>
solvent consisting mainly of butanol which is adhered to the<br>
surface of the said insoluble is eliminated, and consequently<br>
the removal of solvent in finishing process becomes easier.<br>
A mixture of the said insoluble and ethanol is stirred<br>
for about 0.5 to 2 hour(s), preferably about 1 to 1.5 hour at<br>
ambient temperature. Next the mixture is filtered through<br>
filter paper or filter fabric to recover a lutein-fatty acid<br>
ester concentrate, and the filtrate containing an<br>
ethanol-soluble impurity is discarded.<br>
Finally, the residual solvent is removed from the<br>
purified lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate by evaporation<br>
using, for example, a vacuum shelf dryer at a temperature of,<br>
for instance, lower than 50 °C preferably in the atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen gas.<br>
The purity of lutein-fatty acid ester contained in the<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate which is obtained by the<br>
method according to the present invention is about not less than<br>
70%, and that with about more than 80% purity is frequently<br>
obtained. As a result of this, the utilization range as a food<br>
color is broadened due to the vivid color tone, and it becomes<br>
possible to blend a lutein fatty-acid ester concentrate having<br>
high concentration into a dietary supplement by<br>
micro-encapsulation.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
The following examples specifically illustrate the<br>
present invention.<br>
A METHOD OF MESURING THE CONTENT OF LUTEIN-FATTY ACID ESTER<br>
About 0.lg of test sample was accurately measured and<br>
dissolved in hexane to make a 100ml solution. It was diluted<br>
with hexane so that the resultant solution had absorbance<br>
ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, and then the maximum absorbance of the<br>
diluted solution around 445nm was measured by a<br>
spectrophotometer. The content of lutein-fatty acid ester was<br>
calculated by the following formula.<br>
Content(%)=<br>
((Absorbance ÷ Weight of Sample)x Dilution Ratio)÷ 1,394 × 100<br>
Note: 1,394 is absorbance coefficient at 445nm<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
107g of marigold oleoresin containing 26wt% of<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester was mixed with 214ml of acetone and<br>
dissolved at 50°C under heating. Next the solution was slowly<br>
cooled to 20°C over a period of about 3 hours and the resulting<br>
insoluble was eliminated by filtration, and then the filtrate<br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a concentrate<br>
of the acetone-soluble portion. 300g of n-butanol was added<br>
to this concentrate(l00g) , and then the solution was dissolved<br>
at 45°C under heating and slowly cooled to 4°C over a period<br>
of about 4.5 hours.<br>
After further keeping it at 4°C for 16 hours, the resulting<br>
insoluble was filtered through filter paper. The solid which<br>
remained was mixed with 800ml of ethanol, and the mixture was<br>
stirred, dispersed, washed at ambient temperature, and then<br>
filtered again through filter paper. The resulting solid was<br>
dried under vacuum to remove residual solvent, whereby 8.3g of<br>
a concentrate containing 89wt% of lutein-fatty acid ester was<br>
obtained.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
107g of marigold oleoresin as used in Example 1 was mixed<br>

and the resulting insoluble was eliminated by filtration, and<br>
then the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to<br>
obtain a concentrate of acetone-soluble portion.<br>
Next, according to the method mentioned in Example 1 of<br>
USP 6,191,298, this concentrate( l00g) was stirred for 3 hours<br>
with 200g of isopropanol at ambient temperature to obtain a<br>
suspension. The suspension was filtered through filter paper<br>
and the solid left on the filter paper was dried under vacuum<br>
at ambient temperature to eliminate residual solvent, whereby<br>
34.6g of a solid containing 44wt% of lutein-fatty acid ester<br>

temperature to obtain a paste-like suspension. The suspension<br>
was filtered through filter paper and the solid left on the<br>
filter paper was dried under vacuum at ambient temperature to<br>
eliminate residual solvent, whereby 35.6g of a concentrate<br>
containing 37wt% of lutein-fatty acid ester was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
106g of marigold oleoresin containing 22wt% of<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester was mixed with 212ml of acetone and<br>
dissolved at 50°C under heating. Next the solution was slowly<br>
cooled to 20°C over a period of about 3 hours and the resulting<br>
insoluble was eliminated by filtration, and then the filtrate<br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a concentrate<br>
of acetone-soluble portion. 400g of n-butanol was added to this<br>
concentrate (l00g), dissolved at 45°C under heating, and slowly<br>
cooled to 4°C over a period of about 4.5 hours.<br>
26.3g of water was added thereto and the resulting<br>
insoluble was filtered through filter paper. The solid<br>
obtained as above was mixed with 800ml of ethanol for washing<br>
by stirring and dispersion at ambient temperature, and then<br>
filtered again through filter paper. The resulting solid was<br>
dried under vacuum to remove residual solvent, whereby 15.9g<br>
of a concentrate containing 82wt% of lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
was obtained.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 (No acetone treatment)<br>
300g of n-butanol was added to l00g of marigold oleoresin<br>
as used in Example 2, dissolved at 45°C under heating, and slowly<br>
cooled to 4°C over about 4.5 hours. 32.6g of water was added<br>
thereto and the resulting insoluble was filtered through filter<br>
paper. The solid obtained as above was mixed with 800ml of<br>
ethanol for washing by stirring and dispersion at ambient<br>
temperature, and then filtered again through filter paper. The<br>

the resulting insoluble was eliminated by filtration, and then<br>
the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain<br>
a concentrate of acetone-soluble portion. This concentrate<br>
(l00g) was mixed with 2,010 ml of ethanol for washing by stirring<br>
and dispersion at ambient temperature, and filtered again<br>
through filter paper. The resulting solid was dried under<br>
vacuum to remove the residual solvent, whereby 35.2g of a<br>

lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate of high purity, and as a<br>
result of this, the utilization range as a food color is<br>
broadened due to the vivid color tone of a lutein-fatty acid<br>
ester concentrate, and it becomes possible to blend a<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate having high concentration<br>
into a dietary supplement by micro-encapsulation.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A method for the production of a iutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate having purity of not less than 70 wt.% from<br>
marigold oleoresin, which comprises ;<br>
(a) a step of dissolving marigold oleoresin in a ketone solvent,<br>
cooling the solution and removing wherefrom a ketone<br>
solvent-insoluble impurity,<br>
(b) a step of dissolving a ketone solvent-soluble portion,<br>
obtained by removing a ketone solvent from the ketone<br>
solvent solution, in butanol, cooling the solution and<br>
eliminating a butanol-oluble impurity, and<br>
(c) a step of washing a butanol-insoluble, which is obtained<br>
after the above cooling process, with ethanol to eliminate an<br>
ethanol-soluble impurity, followed by removing a residual<br>
solvent to obtain a Iutein-fatty acid ester concentrate of high<br>
purity.<br>
2. A method for the production of a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity from marigold oleoresin, which<br>
comprises:<br>
(a) a step of dissolving marigold oieoresin in a ketone solvent,<br>
cooling the solution and removing wherefrom a ketone<br>
solvent-insoluble impurity,<br>
(b) a step of dissolving a ketone solvent-soluble portion, which<br>
is obtained by removing a ketone solvent from the ketone<br>
solvent solution, in butanol, cooling the solution, and adding<br>
thereto one or more solvents selected from the group<br>
consisting of water, methanol, ethanol and a mixture thereof,<br>
and then eliminating a butanol-solubte impurity, and<br>
(c) a step of washing a butanol-insoluble, which is obtained<br>
upon addition of the said solvent(s) after cooling, with<br>
ethanol to eliminate an ethanol-soluble impurity, followed by<br>
removing a residual solvent to obtain a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity.<br>
3. A method for the production of a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity, which comprises dissolving<br>
marigold oieoresin a ketone solvent, cooling the solution and<br>
removing wherefrom a ketone solvent-insoluble impurity.<br>
4. The method for the production of a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity as claimed in any one of claims 1 to<br>
3, wherein the ketone solvent is acetone.<br>
5. A method for the production of a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity, which comprises washing a<br>
butanol-insoluble, which is precipitated from a butanol<br>
solution containing lutein-fatty acid ester obtained by<br>
processing marigold oleoresin, with ethanol.<br>
6. The method for the production of a lutein-fatty acid ester<br>
concentrate of high purity as claimed in any one of claims 1<br>
to 5, wherein butanol is n-butanol.<br>
7. A composition comprising lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate<br>
containing not less than 70 wt.% of lutein-fatty acid ester.<br>
8. A health food or a dietary supplement comprising lutein-fatty<br>
acid ester concentrate containing not less than 70 wt.% of<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester.<br>
9. A method of making a health food or a dietary supplement<br>
which comprises incorporating a composition containing<br>
lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate containing not less than 70<br>
wt.% of lutein-fatty acid ester into a health food or a dietary<br>
supplement.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the<br>
production of a lutein-fatty acid ester concentrate of high<br>
purity by dissolving marigold oleoresin in a ketone solvent such<br>
as acetone, cooling the solution, and removing wherefrom a<br>
ketone solvent-insoluble component to uniform the quality of<br>
oleoresin, followed by dissolving the acetone-soluble portion<br>
obtained as above in butanol, cooling the solution, removing<br>
a butanol-soluble impurity after adding or without adding one<br>
or more members selected from the group consisting of water,<br>
methanol, ethanol and a mixture thereof, and washing the<br>
resulting butanol-insoluble with ethanol.</td>
