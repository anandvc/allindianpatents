Improved method for preparing ginkgo extracts having a low<br>
content of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine and/or biflavones<br>
The present invention relates to an improved multi-step method for preparing an<br>
extract from ginkgo biloba having a reduced content of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine<br>
and/or biflavones, wherein the depletion is effected by filtration over an adsorber<br>
resin and/or an ion exchanger and the substances to be removed are retained on<br>
the resin. The invention further relates to an extract from ginkgo biloba having a<br>
reduced content of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine and/or biflavones which is obtainable<br>
by the method according to the present invention, as well as to its use.<br>
Since decades, extracts from the leaves of ginkgo biloba are used as a medica-<br>
ment. They are currently used for the treatment of different kinds of dementia and<br>
symptoms thereof as well as cerebral and peripheral blood circulation disorders.<br>
Ingredients, the efficacy is associated with, are terpene lactones (ginkgolides A, B,<br>
C and bilobalide) as well as glycosides of flavones (quercetin, kaempferol and<br>
isorhamnetin). The leaves of ginkgo biloba also contain components which do not<br>
contribute to the desired efficacy, but which may be responsible for risks and side<br>
effects. In addition to unpolar plant ingredients such as ginkgolic acids, those<br>
components are 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine and biflavones. In a ginkgo extract, which<br>
is efficacious and at the same time as safe as possible and as low in side effects<br>
as possible, these compounds should thus not be present to the largest possible<br>
extent.<br>
4'-O-methyl pyridoxine may cause symptoms of poisoning such as convulsive sei-<br>
zures and unconsciousness. Thus, this compound is also referred to as ginkgo-<br>
toxin. The biflavones contained in ginkgo exhibit an immunotoxic potential and<br>
may elicit contact allergies. These biflavones contained in ginkgo are predomi-<br>
nantly the compounds amentoflavone, bilobetin, ginkgetin, isoginkgetin and<br>
sciadopitysin.<br>

Isoginkgetin:	R1 = H1, R2 = R3 = OCH3<br>

Methods for depleting 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine and simultaneously biflavones as<br>
well as the extracts obtained are already described in EP 1 037 646 B1. Therein,<br>
4'-O-methyl pyridoxine is retained using an acidic cation exchanger and the bifla-<br>
vones are adsorbed on activated carbon. Preferably these depletion steps are car-<br>
ried out after step f) of the method according to EP 1 037 646 B1 (page 3), i.e.,<br>
after "treating the solution with a lead compound or an insoluble polyamide". The<br>
method of EP 1 037 646 B1 is based on the method originally described in<br>
DE 39 40 091 C2.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>
-3-<br>
In EP 1 037 646 B1 the depletion of the biflavones and 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine is<br>
carried out at a stage of the method (step f)), wherein relatively high contents of<br>
lead salts and ammonium salts are present such that an increased amount of ion<br>
exchanger has to be employed.<br>
Furthermore, the depletions of biflavones and 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine are de-<br>
scribed and claimed in combination only. However, depending on the limits to be<br>
possibly established in the future and in view of the requirement of as low a modi-<br>
fication of the extract composition as possible, it may be desirable to remove the<br>
biflavones or 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine only.<br>
Furthermore, the contents of less than 50 ppm of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine and less<br>
than 100 ppm of biflavones which are aspired in EP 1 037 646 B1, are still com-<br>
paratively high. Since EP 1 037 646 B1 does not describe a comparative example,<br>
also the actual degree of depletion achieved in Examples 2 and 3 cannot be seen<br>
from this reference.<br>
Thus, it is the object underlying the present invention to provide a method for pre-<br>
paring ginkgo extracts having a low content of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine and/or a low<br>
content of bioflavones which does not have the disadvantages indicated above<br>
and, in particular,<br>
•	wherein well recyclable and/or very inexpensive adsorbents are employed,<br>
•	which leads to contents of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine of less than 20 ppm, pref-<br>
erably less than 10 ppm and particularly preferred less than 2 ppm and/or<br>
contents of biflavones of less than 20 ppm, preferably less than 10 ppm and<br>
particularly preferred less than 5 ppm and<br>
•	which leads to extracts having preferred contents of flavonoides of 20 to 30%<br>
by weight (particularly preferred 22.0 to 27.0%), of terpene lactones of 4.5 to<br>
8.5% by weight (particularly preferred 5.0 to 7.0%, preferably 2.8 to 3.4%<br>
ginkgolides A, B and C and 2.6 to 3.2% bilobalid) and of ginkgolic acids (5<br>
ppm at the most), wherein said contents of flavonoids of 22.0 to 27.0%, of<br>
terpene lactones of 5.0 to 7.0% (2.8 to 3.4% thereof ginkgolides A, B and C<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>
-4-<br>
and 2.6 to 3.2% thereof bilobalid) and of ginkgolic acids (5 ppm at the most)<br>
fulfil the requirements of the German Pharmacopoeia 2003 ("Deutsches<br>
Arzneibuch"; DAB).<br>
According to the DAB the flavonoids are determined in the form of quercetin,<br>
kaempferol and isorhamnetin after acidic hydrolysis and calculated as flavonoid<br>
glycosides.<br>
This object could be solved by separating the biflavones using adsorber resins<br>
and/or separating 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine via acidic ion exchangers.<br>
In order to produce the extracts according to the present invention, preferably the<br>
following method is carried out, wherein steps a) to i) as well as m) are essentially<br>
described already in DE 39 40 091 C2, the total disclosure content of which, in<br>
particular with respect to the details of the method, shall be incorporated into the<br>
present application by reference:<br>
a)	extracting the leaves of ginkgo biloba (drug) at a temperature of 20-100°C, pref-<br>
erably 40-60°C, using water-containing acetone having a content of 20-90% by<br>
weight, a water-containing alkanol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms (methanol, ethanol,<br>
n-propanol and isopropanol) and a content of 20-90% by weight or anhydrous<br>
methanol, wherein the ratio drug : solvent amounts to 1:4 to 1:20, preferably 1:5 to<br>
1:10,<br>
b)	separating the organic solvent by evaporating the solvent to a content of 10%<br>
by weight at the most (preferably 5% by weight at the most), wherein water may<br>
be added during the final distillation steps,<br>
c)	diluting the remaining aqueous solution with water to a solids content of 5 to<br>
25% by weight (preferably 15 to 20% by weight), cooling the solution to a tem-<br>
perature below 25°C (preferably about 10 to 12°C) and allowing the remaining<br>
aqueous solution to stand until a precipitation is formed,<br>
d)	treating the remaining aqueous solution with ammonium sulfate (preferably to a<br>
content of up to 40% by weight, particularly preferred 25 to 35% by weight) and<br>
subsequently extracting the solution at least once using methyl ethyl ketone or a<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>
-5-<br>
mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and acetone (preferably in a ratio of 9:1 to 4:6, in<br>
particular 6:4),<br>
e)	concentrating the extract obtained (preferably to a solids content of 50 to 70%<br>
by weight) and diluting the extract with a mixture of ethanol and water to obtain a<br>
solution containing 50% by weight water and 50% by weight ethanol and having a<br>
solids content of 10% by weight,<br>
f)	treating the solution with a lead compound (preferably with lead acetate, lead<br>
hydroxide acetate, lead nitrate or an aqueous suspension of lead hydroxide) until<br>
a change in colour from brown to umber occurs, or an insoluble polyamide (pref-<br>
erably polyamide 6, polyamide 6,6 or crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone (polyvi-<br>
done)),<br>
g)	extracting the filtered solution using an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic solvent having<br>
a boiling point of 60 to 100°C,<br>
h) concentrating the remaining aqueous-alcoholic solution, subsequently treating<br>
the solution with ammonium sulfate and extracting the solution with methyl ethyl<br>
ketone and ethanol, (the solution is preferably concentrated under reduced pres-<br>
sure to an ethanol content of about 5% at the most, added with ammonium sulfate<br>
to a content of 20% by weight and extracted with the solvent in a ratio of 8:2 to<br>
5:5, preferably 6:4),<br>
i) concentrating the organic phase obtained to a solids content of 50 to 70% by<br>
weight,<br>
k) dissolving the concentrate in an aqueous alkanol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms<br>
and optionally filtering the product,<br>

stances to be removed are retained on the resin and<br>
m) drying the concentrate (preferably at a maximum temperature of 60 to 80°C)<br>
under reduced pressure to obtain a dry extract having a water content of less than<br>
5%.<br>
It is the advantage of the method according to the present invention that the de-<br>
pletion step is carried out at the end of the method. Thus, a smaller amount of the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>
-6-<br>
ion exchanger has to be employed and particularly low contents of 4'-O-methyl<br>
pyridoxine and/or biflavones are obtained.<br>
Preferred adsorber resins in step I) are resins based on optionally substituted sty-<br>
renes/divinylbenzenes such as Diaion HP-20, HP-21 or Sepabeads SP-207 and<br>
SP-850. Preferred ion exchangers are strongly acidic ion exchangers such as<br>
Merck I or Amberlite IR-120. The filtration optionally includes the usual rinsing us-<br>
ing further solvent. The aqueous alkanol in step k) is aqueous methanol, ethanol,<br>
n-propanol or isopropanol having a content of 20-90% by weight, respectively,<br>
preferably aqueous ethanol, a concentration of 40 to 60% by weight being particu-<br>
larly preferred.<br>

Examples<br>
Preparation of the extract solution used in Examples 1 and 2 as well as in<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2<br>
Dried leaves of ginkgo biloba (drug) were extracted at a temperature of about<br>
50°C using seven times their weight (w/w) (i.e. drug-solvent ratio is 1:7) made up<br>
of acetone/water 60/40 (w/w) (step a)).<br>
The organic solvent was largely separated from the extract (step b)) and the re-<br>
maining concentrated aqueous solution was diluted with water to a solids content<br>
of about 10% by weight. The solution was cooled to a temperature of about 12°C<br>
under agitation and the resulting precipitate was removed (step c)).<br>
About 30% by weight ammonium sulfate was added to the remaining aqueous<br>
solution and the solution formed was extracted using a mixture of methyl ethyl ke-<br>
tone and acetone in a ratio of 6:4 (step d)).<br>
The extract obtained was largely concentrated and the concentrate thus obtained<br>
was diluted with water and ethanol such that a solution containing 50% by weight<br>
water and 50% by weight ethanol at a solids content of about 10% by weight was<br>
obtained (step e)). The solution was filtered and the filtrate was added with an<br>
aqueous solution of lead hydroxide acetate (step f)).<br>
After a further filtration, the remaining aqueous alcoholic solution was extracted<br>
with heptane (step g)).<br>
Subsequently, the remaining aqueous alcoholic solution was concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure to an ethanol content of about 5% and ammonium sulfate was<br>
added such that a content of about 20% by weight based on the water content<br>
was achieved.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>

The solution obtained was extracted using a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and<br>
ethanol in a ratio of 6:4 (step h)).<br>
The resulting organic phase was largely concentrated (solids content of about<br>
55% by weight) (step i)). Then the product was diluted with ethanol and water<br>
such that a solution having an ethanol content of about 75% and a solids content<br>
of about 15% was obtained (step k)).<br>
Example 1: Ginkgo extract having a reduced content of 4'-O-methyl pyridox-<br>
ine<br>
1249 g of the extract solution obtained according to the preparation method de-<br>
scribed above was adjusted with water to an ethanol content of about 40% (w/w)<br>
and applied to 50 ml (corresponding to 0.28 ml/g of the dry extract) Amberiite IR-<br>
120 (strongly acidic ion exchanger) (column: about 2 x 16.5 cm; flow: about 8<br>
ml/min) (step I)), followed by rinsing with 200 ml of 50% ethanol (w/w). The result-<br>
ing solution was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and dried in vacuum at 50°C<br>
(stepm)): 179.4 g.<br>
As can be seen from the following table, a content of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine of<br>

The organic solvent was largely separated from the extract and the remaining<br>
concentrated aqueous solution was diluted with water to a solids content of about<br>
10% by weight, cooled to a temperature of about 12°C under agitation and the<br>
resulting precipitate was removed.<br>
About 30% by weight ammonium sulfate was added to the remaining aqueous<br>
solution and the solution formed was extracted using a mixture of methyl ethyl ke-<br>
tone and acetone in a ratio of 6:4.<br>
The extract obtained was largely concentrated and the concentrate thus obtained<br>
was diluted with water and ethanol such that a solution containing 50% by weight<br>
water and 50% by weight ethanol at a solids content of about 10% by weight was<br>
obtained. The solution was filtered, the filtrate was added with an aqueous solu-<br>
tion of lead hydroxide acetate and filtered again (step f)).<br>
150 ml of the solution thus obtained (portion of dry extract: 7.1%; ethanol content:<br>
about 50%) were stirred with 2.5 g (corresponding to 0.17 g/g of the final product)<br>
active carbon for 30 minutes at room temperature. The filtrate was applied to a<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>
-12-<br>
column with 4.2 ml (corresponding to 0.28 ml/g of the final product) strongly acidic<br>
cation exchanger (Merck I). The ion exchanger column was washed with 4 x 5 ml<br>
EtOH (50%).<br>
The combined eluates were extracted by shaking using 3 x 70 ml n-hexane. The<br>
ethanol/water phase was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and diluted with<br>
water to 100 g. The extract solution thus obtained was extracted with 1 x 40 ml,<br>
2 x 30 ml and 1 x 20 ml of a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone:ethanol in a ratio of<br>
3:2, wherein 15 g ammonium sulfate was added to achieve phase separation.<br>
The organic phase was stirred for 1 h at room temperature after adding 25 g am-<br>
monium sulfate. The undissolved ammonium sulfate as well as the aqueous<br>
phase formed were separated. The extract solution was concentrated on a rotary<br>
evaporator at 50°C and dried in vacuum at 60°C: 14.8 g.<br>
As can be seen from the following table, a 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine content of<br>
52 ppm and a biflavone content of 31.3 ppm and, thus, significantly higher con-<br>
tents and inferior depletion results are achieved compared to Example 2b) accord-<br>
ing to the present invention.<br>
The determination of the contents of flavonoids, terpene lactones and ginkgolic<br>
acids listed in Table 1 was carried in accordance with the DAB.<br>
The quantitative determination of 4'-O-methyl pyridoxine was performed by means<br>
of HPLC and fluorescence detection after enrichment via Sep Pak Plus C18 car-<br>
tridges, followed by enrichment via Bond Elut LRC-SCX cartridges, wherein a<br>
Phenomenex Prodigy 5 μ ODS-3 HPLC column and a gradient of trifluoroacetic<br>
acid (pH 2): methanol = 9:1 (v/v) → methanol, were employed.<br>
The determination of the contents of the biflavones listed in Table 1 was per-<br>
formed by means of HPLC and UV detection at 340 nm via a Waters Nova Pak<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/117169	PCT/EP2006/004029<br>
- 13-<br>
C18 column using a gradient of water: acetonitrile of 9:1 (v/v) + 0.3% by volume<br>
phosphoric acid (85%) → acetonitrile + 0.3% by volume phosphoric acid.<br>
In each case, calibration was performed using reference substances having a<br>
high, defined purity grade.<br>
