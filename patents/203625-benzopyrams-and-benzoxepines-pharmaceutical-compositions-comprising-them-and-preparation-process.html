				<td>BENZOPYRANS AND BENZOXEPINES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS" COMPRISING THEM AND PREPARATION PROCESS<br>
The present invention relates to benzopyrans and benzcxepines which can be used in the treatment of dyslipidaemias. atherosclerosis and diabetes, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them and to processes allowing the preparation of these compounds.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of these compounds in Che preparation of medicaments intended for the treatment of dyslipidaemias, atherosclerosis and diabetes.<br>
Cardiovascular disease remains. in most countries, one of the aain diseases and the main cause of mortality. Approximately a third of men develop a major cardiovascular disease before the ace of 50. women exhibiting a lower risk [ratio of 1 to 10) . This disease becomes more prevalent with age (after the age of 55, women become just as vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases as men) . Vascular diseases, such as coronary disease. strokes. restenosis and peripheral vascular disease, remain the main cause of mortality and handicap across the world.<br>
While diet and lifestyle can accelerate the development of cardiovascular diseases, a genetic predisposition leading to dysiipidaemias is a significant factor in strokes and deaths.<br>
The development of atherosclerosis seems to be related mainly to dyslipidaemia. which means abaoraial levels of lipoproteins in the blood plasma. This dysfunction is particularly evident in coronary disease, diabetes and obesity.<br>
The concept intended to explain the development of atherosclerosis was mainly focused on the metabolism of cholesterol and on the metabolism of triglycerides.<br>
However,  since the studies by Randle et al. (Lancet.  1963,  785-7391 ,  a novel  concept has beer. proposed: a glucose-fatty acid cycle or Randle cycle, which describes  the  regulation  of  the  equilibrium between  the  metabolism  of  lipids.  in  terms  of criglycerides and cholesterol,  and the oxidation of glucose. According to this concept the Inventors have<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
developed a novel prograinine . having the aim of finding new compounds which act simultaneously on the metabolism of lipids and the metabolism of glucose.<br>
Fibrates are well-known therapeutic agents with a mechanism of action via the "Peroxisome Proliferatos Activated Receptors". These receptors are the main regulators of the metabolism of lipids in the liver (PPAR  isoform). In the last . ten years, thiazolidinediones have been described as powerful hypogiycaemic agents in animals and man. It has been reported that thiazolidinediones are powerful selective activators of anocher isoform of PPARs: the various PPAR  (Lehmann et al. , J. Biol, Chem. 1995, 270, 12953-12956) .<br>
The Inventors have discovered a new class of compounds which are powerful activators of the PPAR  and PPAR  isoforms. Due to this activity, these compounds exhibit a significant hypolipidaemic and hypogiycaemic effect.<br>

The compounds of formula (1} can be prepared by using one of the following Processes A or 3, which prodesses form another subject-matter of the invention.<br>
Process A makes possible the 'preparation of the compounds of formula (I) in which n represents 1.<br>
This process comprises the stages composed of: (al) preparing an ylide<br>
o either by reaction of a base with a phosphonate of formula:<br><br><br>
in which R'.is as defined in Claim I [sic];<br>
T1 and T2 independently represent  (C1-C5) alkyl; and<br>
Y	represents (C1-C3) alkoxy,<br>
or by reaction of a base with a phosphonitun salt of formula [IIb):<br><br>
in which R' is as defined in Claim l [sic]; T2, T4 and T5 independently represenc (C1-C5}alxyl or (C1-C5)aryl optionally substituted by (C1-C5) alkyl;<br>
Y	represents (C1-C5) alkoxy; and,<br>
hal represents a halogen atom;<br>
(51) reacting the ylide obcained in Stage (al) with an aldehyde of formula:<br><br>
in which<br>
R, p, X and A are as defined in Claim 1 [sic];, one and one alone of R' and R2  represents -CHO and the other takes one of the meanings given in Claim 1 [sic] for R1 and R2, with the exception of the Z chain, so as to obtain a compound of formula (I) in which n represents 1 and y represents (C1-C5) alkoxy;<br>
(cl) if appropriate, converting the ester obtained in Stage (b1) above in acidic or basic medium into the corresponding carboxylic acid of formula (I) in which Y represents OH;<br>
(dl) if appropriate, reacting the carboxylic acid functional group of the compound of formula (I) resulting from Stage (cl) with an amine of formula HNRcRd in which Rc and Rd are as defined in Claim 1<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
[sic], optionally after activation of the carboxyl functional group, so as to prepare the corresponding compound of formula (I) in which Y represents -NRcRd.<br>
The reaction employed in Stage (bl) is either a Wittig reaction or a Horner-Emmons or Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.<br>
It results in the preparation of a reactive ylide.<br>
When the ylide is prepared from a phosphonium salt (compound IIb) , the reaction employed is a Wittig reaction.<br>
When the ylide is prepared from a phosphonate (compound IIa) , the reaction employed is a Hcrner-Emmons or Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.<br>
In Stage al [sic] , the ylide is prepared by reaction of a base either with a compound Ila [sic] or with a compound IIb [sic]. The base used must be sufficiently strong to detach the proton at the position a to the phosphorus.<br>
The base is generally chosen from an alkali metal hydride, an alkali metal carbonate, an alkali metal amide, a (C1-C10) alkyllithium and an alkali metal alkoxide.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of example [sic] , of sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, n-butyllithium, potassium tert-butoxide,  a [sic]  lithium amide or a [sic] sodium amide.<br>
In the context of the invention, sodium hydride and potassium tert-butoxide are preferred as base.<br>
The reaction of the base with the compound {IIa) or (IIb) is carried out in solution, preferably in an aprotic solvent ' and more particularly in a solvent capable of dissolving the phosphonate (IIa) or the phosphonium salt (IIb) respectively.<br>
Appropriate solvents are aprotic solvents, such as, for example and non-limitingly, aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene and toluene), ethers (such as diethyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran) and their mixtures.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
The choice of che solvent: depends in particular on che type of ylide (compounds IIa or IIb).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, stage <b2 of reaction the aldehyde with ylide is carried out by addition to crude mixture resulting from stage that say without isolation intermediate ylide.></b2>
Thus, it is desirable for the solvent of Stage (al) also to be capable of dissolving the aldehyde (III). However, another embodiment of che invention comprises the addition of a solution of the aldehyde (III) in a solvent to the crude reaction mixture resulting from Stage (al) . Under these conditions, it is not necessary to select, in Stage (al) , a solvent capable of dissolving the compound (III).<br>
The temperature at which Stage (al) is carried out depends on the acidity of the compound (IIa) or (IIb) respectively, that is to say on the ease with which the proton at the position a to the phosphorus can be detached. It goes without saying that the type of base used directly influences the choice of the reaction temperature. Thus, the stronger the base, the lower the reaction temperature. When the base used is n-butyllithium, a temperature of between -80°C and -40°C, preferably between -80°C and -70°C, is generally desirable. In this case, the solvent is chosen so as to make possible such severe reaction conditions: ethers are very particularly well suited.<br>
When the base is an alkali metal alkoxide, a temperature of between 10 and 100°C is generally suitable. If, furthermore, this base is reacted with a phosphcnate (IIa) , a temperature of between 15 and 70°C is generally sufficient.<br>
When the base used is an alkali metal hydride, the temperature is generally between -10°C and 50°C. If, furthermore, this base is reacted with a phosphonate (IIa) ,  a  temperature  of  between  -5°C  and  30°C  is generally sufficient.<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
A stoichiometric amount of the base is needed in Stage (al) to detach the proton at the position a to the phosphorus in the compound (IIa) or (IIb) respectively. Nevertheless, it is possible to use a very slight excess of base, so that the reaction for the formation of the ylide is complete. Thus, the molar ratio of the base to the compound (IIa) or (IIb) respectively is maintained between 1 and 1.2, preferably between 1 and 1.1, better still between 1 and 1.05.<br>
The concentration of  the  compound  (IIa)  or (IIb)  respectively in the  reaction mixture  is not critical according to the invention. The concentration generally varies between  0.01 mol/1  and  10 mol/l, preferably between 0.1 and 1 mol/1.<br>
In Stage (bi), the aldehyde (III) is reacted with the ylide resulting from Stage (al) .<br>
The aldehyde (III) is advantageously added to the crude reaction mixture resulting from Stage (al)<br>
The aldehyde (III) can be added as is to the reaction mixture or else in solution in a solvent, preferably an aprotic solvent.<br>
Mention may be made, as preferred solvents, of solvents of aromatic hydrocarbon, ether, N-dimethylformamide [sic],  dimethyl sulphoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone or P[N(CK3}2]2 type and their mixtures which were cited above.<br>
Whatever the operating procedure, it is preferable for the concentration of aldehyde (III) in the reaction mixture to vary between 6 x 10"3 and 0.5 mol/1. preferably between 0.01 and 0.7 mol/1.<br>
The temperature at which the ylide reacts with the aldehyde (III) depends on the respective reactivity of the two reactants.<br>
It should be noted that the ylide prepared from the phosphonate (IIa) is more reactive than the ylide prepared from the compound (IIb). Thus, Process A, involving the implementation of a reaction of Horner-<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
Emmons type with the use of the phosphonate (IIa)  is particularly advantageous.<br>
Generally, a temperature cf between -10°C and 50°C is appropriate for the reaction of the ylide with the aldehyde {III), a temperature of between -S°C and 30°C being more particularly well suited.<br>
It may be necessary to bring the crude reaction mixture resulting from Stage (al) to this temperature before carrying out Stage (bl) , in so far as the temperature conditions involved in Stages (al) and (bl) differ.<br>
More generally, a person skilled in the art may draw inspiration from the operating conditions described in the literature for the Wittig and Horner-Emmons reactions for the purpose of preparing the compound of formula (I) in which a is 1 and V represents (C1-C5)alkoxy obtained on conclusion of Stages (al) and (bl).<br>
Stage (cl) makes possible the hydrolysis of the ester of formula (I) resulting from Stage {bl} This stage is advantageously carried out in basic medium. The bases generally used for the saponificacion of esters can be used for the implementation of Stage (cl). These bases are preferably inorganic bases of the alkali metal hydroxide type (NaOH, KOH) or of the alkali metal carbonate type (K2CO3, Na2CO3) .<br>
The hydrolysis of the estar functional group is generally carried out in a solvent, such as a protic solvent. (C1-C5)alkanol [sic], water and their mixtures are particularly well suited.<br>
The hydrolysis is advantageously carried out at a temperature of 0 to 100°C, for example 20 to 30°C, in a mixture of methanol and water, by reaction with sodium hydroxide.<br>
The amount of base needed is usually between 1 to 5 equivalents with respect to the ester of formula (I), preferably between 1 and 2 equivalents.<br>
Although this does not correspond to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the hydrolysis<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
of Che ester functional group can be carried out in acidic medium.<br>
In order to determine the ideal conditions for hydrolysis of the ester functional group, a person skilled in the art should refer, for example, zo Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene T.W. and Wuts P.G.M., published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991, and to Protecting Groups, Kocienski P.J., 1994, Georg Thieme Verlag.<br>
Stage (dl) is carried out for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) in which Y represents -NRcRd.<br>
It comprises a conventional reaction of the carboxylic acid obtained in Stage (cl) with an amine of formula NHRCRD. It is more particularly advantageous to react an activated form of the carboxylic acid of formula (I} with the amine NHRcRd. Such an activated form is, for example, a carboxylic acid anhydride, an acid chloride or a mixed anhydride. The amidatior. of the carboxyl functional group will be carried out in a way known per se by a person skilled in the art.<br>

The hypoiipidaemic and hypcglycaemic activity of the compounds of the invention was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo by employing the following tests: 1) Demonstration of the in vitro activity. The hypoiipidaemic and hypoglycaemic effect of the  compounds  of  the  invention, result  from  their ability to activate the PPARa and PPARy isoforms.<br>
Analysis of the activation of PPARCC and PPARY is based on the transfection of a DNA allowing the expression of a reporter gene (the gene of luc if erase} -under the control of the $PARs, either endogenous in the case of PPARy or exogenous in the case of PPARct. The reporter plasmid J3TkLuc comprises three copies of the response element for PPARs of the human apo A-II gene (Staels, B et al.  £1995) , J. Clin. Invest. , 95, 705-712) which are cloned upstream of the promoter of the thymidine kinase gene of the herpes simplex virus in the plasmid pGL3 . This reporter gene was obtained by subc*loning,  in the plasmid pGL3, the plasmid J3TKCAT described above  (Fajas,  L et al.  (1997) ,  J.  Biol Chem.,  272,  18779-13789).  The cells used are green monkey CV1 cells transformed by the SV40 virus, which express PPAKY (Forman, 3. et al. (1995), Cell, 83, 303-812J , and human SK-Hepl cells, which do not express PPARs -  These cells were inoculated at the rate of<br><br>
- 34 -<br>
20,000 cells per well (96-well planes) and transacted with 150 ng of reporter DNA completed with a mixture of lipids. In the case of the SK-HepI cells, an expression vector for PPARCt, described by Sher, T. et al. (1993) Biochemistry, 32, 5598-5604, is cotransfected. After 5 hours, the cells are washed twice and incubated for 3 6 hours in the presence of the test compound in a fresh culture medium comprising 10% foetal calf serum. At the end of incubation, the cells are lysed and the lucif erase activity is "measured,, This activity is expressed relative to the control value.<br>
By way of example, the compound of Example 16b described below {(2E, 4E)-5-(3,3-dimethyi-7-meuhoxy-2 , 3-cihydrobenzoxepin-5-yl) -3-methylpenta-2 , 4-dienoic acid) increases, under these conditions, the luciferase signal by 300% in the CV1 cells and by 250% in the SK-Hepi cells. In the presence of a pGL3 reporter vector devoid of a PPAR response element, the compound of Example 16b is inactive in both cell types.<br>
2) Demonstration of the in vivo activity The antidiabetic and hypolipidaemic activity of the compounds of formula I [sic] was determined by the oral route in db/db mice.<br>
Two-month-old db/db mice are treated per os for 15 days with the compound of Example 16 {100 mg/kg/day). Each study group comprises seven animals. After treating for three days (D3) and fifteen days {D15), retro-orbital samples are taken after light anaesthesia and fasting for 4 hours.<br>

The organic phase is washed with a 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and then with water. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulphate, ~he organic phase is concentrated under reduced pressure. An oil is obtained, which oil slowly crystallizes. It is recrystallized from 25 ml of isopropyl ether. 2.0 g of the title compound are thus obtained in the form of a solid, the melting point of which is between 68 and 70°C (yield = 35%).<br>

Preparation 4<br>
4-Phenyl-3-formyl-2H-l-benzopyran<br>
71 ml (0.773 tnol) of phosphorus oxychlcride are added dropwise to 300 ml of dimethylfcrmamide maintained at 0°C. The reaction mixture is left stirring for 20 minutes at a temperature of between 0 and 5°C. A solution of 16.1 g (77.3 mmoi) of 4-phenyi-2K-l-benzopyran in. 22.5 ml of dimethylformamide is then added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is allowed to return to room temperature and is then brought to 60°C for 7 hours. The reaction mixture is then poured into a mixture of ice and water which is neutralized with NaOH. The organic phase is extracted with ethyl acetate and than the organic phase is washed 3 times with water. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulphate, the organic phase is concentrated under reduced pressure: A pasty solid is thus obtained, which solid, after silica column chromatography using a 1/1 methylene chloride/cyclohexane mixture as eluant, results in 15.3 g of the title compound in the form of a yellow solid, the melting point of which is 82-83°C (yield = 83%).<br>
