VERTICAL AXIS TURBINE APPARATUS<br>
This invention relates to vertical axis turbine apparatus particularly, though not exclusively, for power generation.<br>
It has been known for centuries that energy may be derived from the wind. Windmills were a familiar feature of the medieval landscape in many countries and, even today, are in use around the world in various capacities. One particular use of wind driven turbines is to generate electricity.<br>
With the rise in concern about the depletion of fossil fuels, and possible adverse environmental effects caused by their use, interest has revived in the possibility of electricity generation via wind turbines, particularly for such generation on a large scale.<br>
So-called "wind farms" have been built in many countries with a view to harvesting wind energy in this way. They generally consist of an array of towers, each of which carries at its upper end a swivellable head, allowing alignment with the wind direction, on which is mounted a number of turbine blades ail joined to a singls rotating hub, like propeller blades, but being driven by the wind rather than by a motor to produce fopA'ard thrust as would be a propeller. Tnere is a substantia] amount of published literature relating<br><br>
to such horizontal axis wind turbine apparatus.<br>
Although commercial power generation using such apparatus has commenced, there is concern about the unsightiiness thev cause to some observers when sited in rural landscapes. Erecting wind turbines off-shore reduces the unsightliness and removes objections to the sheer size and numbers of the apparatus.  Increasing the size of off-shore wind turbines reduces the cost of electrical connection to shore by reducing the number of wind turbines necessary to provide a given amount of power.<br>
A limit to the size of the horizontal axis wind turbine apparatus is encountered in the fatigue damage (as in "metal fatigue") suffered by the repeated reversal of bending of the blades caused by their weight as the blades rotate; the fatigue damage caused by the weight of a blade increases proportionately with the size of the blade, assuming no other alterations in design are made. As the size of a blade gets greater the designer is forced to employ different matenals that have superior fatigue resistance but which are usually more expensive and reduce the cost-effectiveness of the apparatus.<br>
Wind turbine apparatus in which the blades rotate about a vertical axis do not experience bending reversal caused by weight but they do experience fatigue damage caused by wind pressure loading.  However, wind pressure fatigue does not increase with the size of the so-called vertical axis wind turbine apparatus and so does not impose a limit to its size.<br>
A number of suggestions have been made in the past to generate electricity using vertical axis wind turbines. There is a substantial amount of literature relating to the so-called Savonius and Darrieus designs, and practical power-generating units have been buiit. However, being iess well developed; they have not found favour with operaiors of commercial wind farms. The Sack or development of the vertical axis wind turbine is because of a perceived<br><br>
lesser efficiency of operation compared with the horizontal axis turbine.<br>
GB-A-2102079 describes a vertical axis wind turbine with the possibility of win blades inclined upwards io the horizontal plane at a selectable angle and attached at the lower ends to a shaft that permits rotation about a vertical axis,  It is not believed that this design has led to any commercial exploitation- The design has the disadvantage of generating a wind pressure force that causes an excessive overturning, or toppling moment io the whole apparatus. The cost of resisting the toppling moment is uneconomical.<br>
GB-A-2303409 discloses a similar vertical axis wind turbine consisting of a single, balanced inclined blade rotating about a vertical axis that can rock under the action of wind pressure but against the resistance of a balancing mass. This design reduces the toppling moment but requires a blade and balancing masses that are uneconomically heavy.<br>
Turbine apparatus for extracting power from flowing water is also known, from the mediaeval watermill to more modern designs of turbine for mounting unden/vaterto extract power from water flow, so-called hydroelectric power generation.<br>
We have now discovered a new class of designs for vertical axis turbines that can be scaled up to a size that exceeds that which is economically feasible for horizontal axis turbines, which can be used as wind turbines, on land or off shore, or underwater to extract power from flowing currents.<br>
According to the present invention, in its broadest aspect., there is provided a vertical axis turbine includina a fixed base and a rotatina bladed turbine member mounted on the fixed base and rotatabie about a vertical axis: The bladed member consistina of at least one inclined eioncate soar inclined upwardly and outwardly from the axis of rotation, the or each spar carrying<br><br>
set on it at least one short aerofoii or hydrofoil section blade. Preferably the angis(s) of the short aerofoii or hydrofoil section biade(s) relative to the spar(s) is/are adjusted to optimise the overall rotational couple about the vertical axis and to minimise the overall overturning moment when subjected to wind or current loading. The angle does not have to be the same for all of the blades when there is more than one. The elongate spar(s) which serve(s) as structural support for the aerofoil or hydrofoil section(s), must necessarily incur loading in their own right, and accordingly preferably have an aerofoii or hydrofoil section to minimise drag.<br>
Preferably the number of spars is 2 or 3 though up to 50 spars may be provided if desired,  if there is more than one spar, the spars are preferably held together by a plurality of guy wires or the like connecting each spar to the opposite or adjacent spars.  The angle of inclination of each spar to the vertical may be adjustable, e.g. by hinging each spar at its base and by shortening or lengthening the guy wire(s).  Preferably the number of short aerofoil or hydrofoil sections is between 1 and 207 more preferably 2 to 5, and most preferably 4.<br>
The aerofoii or hydrofoil profiles of the blade(s) and spar(s); i.e. their section from leading edge to trailing edge may vary in their classification, thickness-to-chord ratio and camber.  For wind turbines, the aerodynamic profile of the blades preferably has a maximum thickness to chord ratio in the range 10% to 50%.<br>
The aspect ratio of each short aerofoil or hydrofoil section blade is preferably in the range 2 to 5 but most preferably in the range 3 to 4.<br>
The ancle of mounting of the short aerofoil or hvdrofoil section blades on the or each span measured from the radially outward horizontal direction in the radial and vertical plane containing the centre-iine of the span is preferably in the range of 90 degrees'to 150 degrees but most preferably around 145<br><br>
degrees.<br>
The angle of mounting of each short aerofoil or hydrofoil section blade to a spar measured from a horizontal line perpendicular to the radial and vertical plane containing the centre-line of the spar in a normal cross-sectional plane of the short blade, i.e the angle of pitch.,  is preferably in the range 4-5 degrees to -5 degrees. The angles of mounting may be the same for each blade or different The angle should be adjusted to maximise the efficiency of the turbine to harvest energy from the wind or water current, but it may also be possible to use such angular adjustments for other purposes. For example, by changing the angle of pitch of one or more of the short aerofoil or hydrofoil section blades in a progressive manner, by up to 90 degrees, an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic braking effect may be achieved. This can be of value in enabling control to be effected, e.g. to limit power output in very windy or high flood current situations.  Also, one or more of the short aerofoil o\- hydrofoil section blades may incorporate means to rotate the rearmost portion about a span-wise hinge like an aileron, cyclically, within the range of +90 degrees to -90 degrees in order to maximise the power output of the turbine.<br>
The size of the turbines in accordance with the present invention may vary substantially, naturally larger sizes being capable of generating greater power. The typical sizes for a wind turbine with a design capacity of 1 megawatt would be a circle of 100 metres diameter swept out horizontally by the outer tip of a spar and blades of spanwise length 16 metres and chord lenath 5.5 metres.<br>
The structure of the vertically inclined spars may van/ widely and may be simple, i.e. a single central spar running upwardly and outwardly, or it may be complex, for example a number of sub spars constituting a framework serving to mount the individual short aerofoil or hydrofoil section blades. Preferably the cross-section of the spars and, indeed- any other members<br><br>
such as support struts or ties associated therewith, is an aerofoil or hvdrcfcil section in order to-minimise drag. Within these constraints, a wide variety of desiqns may be adopted.<br>
The invention is illustrated by way of example in more detaii with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a vertical axis wind turbine apparatus in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a vertical axial section of the apparatus shown in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective diagrammatic view of an alternative embodiment;  . and<br>
Figure 4 is a vertical section through the embodiment of Figure 3.<br>
Referring first to Figures 1 and 2, these show a wind turbine apparatus with two arms F comprising single spars supporting short aerofoil section blades<br>
S connected by guys T.<br>
The two spars F come together at their base in a hub H which is rotatably set on a base B. When the wind blows, the assembly of the arms F3 blades S and guys T rotates about a vertical axis on the base B and by means of a suitable shaft can drive generator apparatus of appropriate type, either via gearing, or preferably directly. The overail size of the turbine apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 may van/ widely, the laraer the size the qreater the engineering outlay, but, likewise, the greater the amount of power which can be generated by its rotation.<br>
Referring now to Figures 3 and 4. these shew a wind turbine apparatus with two arms comprising complex frameworks of struts and ties supporting short<br><br>
aerofoil section blades S.<br>
Each of the struts and ties forming the arms or spars is of aerofoil section to minimise wind resistance. As can be seen, the leading edge of each aerofoil section is in the same circumferential direction looked at around a vertical axis through the centre of the apparatus and when wind blows horizontally past the apparatus, it is therefore caused to rotate in the direction of rotation indicated at R on Figure 3.<br>
As can be seen easily from Figure 3, the two arms rest on a generally cylindrical base B.  As can be seen'from the drawing, the two arms sit pivoted at their respective bases to a pair of mounting lugs so that each can  be rotated about a generally horizontal axis indicated at A following disengagement of three of the struts identified as F' This is useful to enable, e.g., damage to any of the aerofoils caused by bird impact to be repaired.<br>
The base B is mounted on an appropriate bearing system and means are provided to drive a generator directly or indirectly in order to produce electricity when the wind blows and rotates the assembly shown in Figures 3 and 4.<br>
Underwater turbine installations may be made in similar fashion, though taking into account the conditions likely to be encountered.  By careful design, substantial engineering savings may be made as the effective weight of the rotatable turbine member can be much reduced, e.g. by making the hydrofoil members hollow.<br><br><br>
