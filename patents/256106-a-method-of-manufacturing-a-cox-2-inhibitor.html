COX-2-INHIBITOR;<br><br><br>
CAMBRIDGE SCIENTIFIC PTY LTD, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF AUSTRALIA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 5/284 OXFORD STREET, LEEDERVILLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA 6007, AUSTRALIA.<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an agent having COX-2 inhibition activity. In particular the present invention relates to a composition comprising an effective amount of a COX-2 inhibitor separated from a mixture of plasma and at least one metal, metal ion or metal salt thereof, wherein said mixture has been denatured.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
COX-2 inhibitors are newly developed drugs for inflammation that block the COX-2 enzyme. Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of prostaglandins that cause the pain and swelling of arthritis inflammation. While COX-2 inhibitors are classified as non-steroidal anti¬inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), most do not have the same problems as other NSAIDs, as they generally block the COX-2 enzyme and not the COX-1 enzyme.<br>
Common examples of NSAIDs which affect both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes include aspirin, indomethacin (Indocin), ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn), piroxicam (Feldene), and nabumetone (Relafen). These drugs are commonly prescribed medications for the inflammation of arthritis and other body tissues, such as in tendinitis and bursitis. However, all of these medications have side effects. The major common side effects of these NSAIDs are related to the gastrointestinal system. Some 10%-50% of patients are unable to tolerate NSAID treatment because of side effects, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bloating, heartburn, and dyspepsia. Approximately 15% of patients on long-term NSAID treatment develop ulceration of the stomach and duodenum. Even though many of these patients with ulcers do not have symptoms and are unaware<br><br>
of their ulcers, they are at risk of developing serious ulcer complications such as bleeding or perforation of the stomach.<br>
The annual risk of serious complications with chronic NSAID use is l%-4%. The risk of complications is higher in elderly patients, rheumatoid arthritis sufferers, patients on anticoagulants such as Coumadin and heparin or cortisone medication, and patients with heart disease or a prior history of bleeding ulcers.<br>
Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is an enzyme which is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including sites of inflammation and the stomach. The COX-1 enzyme of the stomach produces prostaglandins that ensure the natural mucus lining which protects the inner stomach. Common anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin block the function of the COX-1 enzyme along with COX-2. When the COX-1 enzyme is blocked, inflammation is reduced, but the protective mucus lining of the stomach is also reduced, which can cause stomach upset, ulceration, and bleeding from the stomach and intestines.<br>
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) produces prostaglandins, but the COX-2 enzyme is located specifically in areas of the body that are responsible for inflammation and not in the stomach. When the COX-2 enzyme is blocked, inflammation is reduced. Since the COX-2 enzyme does not play a role in the normal function of the stomach or intestinal tract, medications which selectively block COX-2 do not present the same risk of injuring the stomach or intestines.<br>
Accordingly, the development of new COX-2 inhibitors is desirable as COX-2 inhibitors provide the benefits of reducing inflammation without irritating the stomach.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particularly exemplified methods and may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments of the invention only, and is not intended to be limiting which will be limited only by the appended claims.<br>
All publications, patents and patent applications cited<br><br>
herein, whether supra  or infra,   are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. However, publications mentioned herein are cited for the purpose of describing and disclosing the protocols and reagents which are reported in the publications and which might be used in connection with the invention.  Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.<br>
Furthermore, the practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional chemistry and pharmacology within the skill of the art. Such techniques are well known to the skilled worker, and are explained fully in the literature. See, eg., Coligan, Dunn, Ploegh, Speicher and Wingfield "Current protocols in Protein Science" (1999) Volume I and II {John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.); The Merck Index, 12th Edition (1996), Therapeutic Category and Biological Activity Index; and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, USA.<br>
It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Thus, for example, a reference to "a metal" includes a plurality of such metals, and a reference to "an isolated protein" is a reference to one or more proteins, and so forth.  Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly  understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.  Although any materials and methods similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used to practice or test the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are now described.<br><br>
In its broadest aspect, the present invention provides a composition useful as a COX-2   inhibitor.<br>
It will be appreciated that the term "COX-2 inhibitor" reflects compounds and compositions of the present invention that are capable of blocking or reducing the activity or function of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Specifically, by reducing or blocking the COX-2 enzyme, the COX-2 inhibitor of the present invention is capable of providing anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
The term "anti-inflammatory" is intended to include an inflammatory response modifier, including all inflammatory responses such as production of stress proteins, white blood  cell infiltration, fever, pain, swelling and so forth.<br>
The composition of the present invention will therefore be administered as an effective amount to a subject in need of anti-inflammatory treatment.  The term "effective amount" refers to that amount which is sufficient to induce or maintain an anti-inflammatory effect. What constitutes an effective inflammatory amount, or dose, of the composition of the present invention depends, among other factors, on the body weight of the subject and the intensity of the inflammation being treated. Normally an effective dose will be found in the range of about 1 to about 6mg/kg body weight. For an average 75kg subject, this range equates to a dose of about 75 to about 450mg. Proportionately smaller or larger doses can be appropriate for subjects having lesser or greater body weight. Such a dose can be administered as needed, but typically administration 1 to about 4 times per day, in most cases 1 or 2 times a day, provides adequate continuing relief of pain.<br>
The COX-2 inhibitor composition of the present invention<br><br>
essentially comprises a mixture of denatured plasma protein and at least one metal, metal ion or metal salt.<br>
In some embodiments, the COX-2 inhibitor composition of the present invention essentially comprises a mixture of denatured plasma protein and at least one metal, metal ion or metal salt, wherein said protein or protein fragments have molecular weights less than 50kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "plasma" are used herein typically refers to the straw-coloured fluid in which the blood cells are suspended. It consists of various inorganic salts of sodium, potassium, calcium etc. with a high concentration of protein (approximately 70g/l) and a variety of trace elements.<br>
The plasma used in the present invention may be obtained from any animal source as plasma can be prepared from the blood of any animal. In some embodiments, the plasma is isolated from blood taken from an animal selected from the group consisting of human, equine, bovine, ovine, murine, caprine and canine.  In some embodiments, the animal source for the plasma is bovine.<br>
The plasma may be freshly isolated or lyophilised. In some embodiments, blood is isolated from cattle and the haemoglobin is removed by standard procedures. The plasma is then mixed with sodium bicarbonate (approx. 20g per litre) and heated to no more than 80°C for at least 30 minutes or until the coagulated plasma proteins precipitate. The precipitate is then isolated and used directly or lyophilised by standard procedures for further use.<br>
In some embodiments, a protease selected from the group consisting of trypsin, chymotrypsin, factor Xa, venom-<br><br>
protease, thrombin, plasmin and a serine-protease of the subtilisin family is added before heating or after heating to about 80°C. In some embodiments the protease is trypsin.<br>
The precipitate is then resolubilised by mixing the precipitate or the lyophilised precipitate with water or other aqueous solutions (approximately 50g per litre) and heating the mixture (second heating step) at between about 80°C and about 150°C.  In some embodiments the second heating step is carried out between about 90°C and about 130°C.  In some embodiments the second heating step is carried out at about 120°C.<br>
At this stage i.e. before, after or during the resolubilisation step at least one metal,   metal ion or salt thereof is added to the resolubilised plasma proteins. Various metals and/or metal ions are useful in the composition of the present invention and as such the present invention embraces all such metals or metal ions.<br>
In some embodiments, the metals are selected from the group consisting of nickel, sodium, copper, zinc, cobalt, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, silver and mercury.<br>
In cases  where the metals are sufficiently hasic  or  acidic to form stable non-toxic acid or base salts, the use of the metals as salts can be appropriate. Examples of acceptable metal salts include acetate, ascorbate, benzoate, bicarbonate, chloride, citrate, carbonate, a-glycerophosphate, a-ketoglutarate, malonate, methanesulfonate, nitrate, succinate, sulfate, tartarate and tosylate salts.<br>
Metal salts can be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal<br><br>
(for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal {for example calcium) salts can be made.<br>
For example, the metal may be silver (I), wherein the nitrate salt provides adequate free silver (I) ion to provide the necessary metal requirement. The chloride salt on the other hand provides less silver, being less soluble and with a low dissociation constant and therefore is less useful in the invention. The skilled artisan will be able to readily determine the suitable salt form of the metal ion that provides the necessary properties for the present invention. Furthermore, the skilled artisan will be aware of the compatibility of the salt forms of the metal(s) and other components of the composition to maintain adequate levels of the metal ion(s).<br>
In some embodiments, the metals used in the composition comprise a mixture of a number of metals. For example, the mixture of metals could consist essentially of NiS04.7H20, NH4V03, NaF, CuS04.5H20, ZnCl2, (NH4)6MO7O24.4H2O, COCl2.6H2O, FeS04.7H2O, MgSO4 . 7H2O, H3BO3, MnCl2.4H2O and K2Cr04 .<br>
Once  the resolubilised plasma protein mixture comprising denatured plasma proteins and metal, metal ion or salts thereof has been obtained it can  be either used directly or fractionated to obtain a more refined fraction having cytokine mediating activity. Techniques for fractionating protein-containing mixtures are well known in the art. See, for example, "Plasma Protein Fractionation" Heide K, Haupt H &amp; Schwick H; in The Plasma Proteins, 2nd Edition Vol 3 (1977) Putnam F. (Ed); US Pat. No. 4,351,710 and US Pat. No. 4,322,275 both entitled "Fractionation of protein mixtures"; US Pat. No. 5,138,034 entitled "Method of fractionating plasma proteins" all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As described above, in some embodiments, the present<br><br>
invention provides a method of relieving COX-2 related or mediated disease or disorder such as inflammation in a subject, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a composition of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, the method of the invention can be used to relieve mild to severe, acute or chronic inflammation. The method of the invention is useful for treatment of non-human mammalian subjects or patients, including domestic, farm and exotic animals, such as for example dogs horses, zoo animals and the like, but is primarily useful for treatment of human subjects or patients.<br>
Generally, the terms "treating," "treatment" and the like are used herein to mean affecting an individual or subject, their tissue or cells to obtain a desired pharmacological and/or physiological effect.  The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing the COX-2 mediated disease or sign or symptom thereof, and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure of the COX-2 mediated disease. "Treating" as used herein covers any treatment of, or prevention of inflammation in a vertebrate, a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the COX-2 mediated disease from occurring in a subject that may be predisposed to the COX-2 mediated disease, but has not yet occurred; <b inhibiting the cox-2 mediated disease i.e. arresting its development or relieving ameliorating symptoms of cause regression disease.></b>
While the methods of the present invention are primarily directed towards inflammation the compositions of the present invention are also useful in the treatment and/or<br><br>
prevention of a wide range of conditions and disorders mediated by COX-2, including but not restricted to disorders characterized by inflammation, pain and/or fever. Such compositions are especially useful as anti¬inflammatory agents, such as in treatment of arthritis. In particular, such compositions have reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity and gastrointestinal irritation including upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, reduced potential for renal side effects such as reduction in renal function leading to fluid retention and exacerbation of hypertension, reduced effect on bleeding times including inhibition of platelet function, and possibly a lessened ability to induce asthma attacks in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects, by comparison with compositions of conventional NSAIDs. Thus compositions useful in methods of the invention are particularly useful as an alternative to conventional NSAIDs where such NSAIDs are contraindicated, for example in patients with peptic ulcers, gastritis, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis or with a recurrent history of gastrointestinal lesions; gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulation disorders including anemia such as hypoprothrombinemia, hemophilia or other bleeding problems; kidney disease; or in patients prior to surgery or patients taking anticoagulants.<br>
Such compositions are useful to treat a variety of arthritic disorders, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile arthritis.<br>
Such compositions are useful in treating inflammation in such diseases as migraine headaches, periarteritis nodosa, thyroiditis, aplastic anemia, Hodgkin's disease, sclerodoma, rheumatic fever, type I diabetes, neuromuscular junction disease including myasthenia<br><br>

EXAMPLE 1      PREPARATION OF COX-2 INHIBITOR COMPOSITION<br>
200 litres of sterile cattle blood was centrifuged at 1000 - 1300 x g for 10 minutes and the haemoglobin was removed from the plasma.  After centrifugation approximately 100 litres of plasma was  gained, and transferred into a dish, suitable for heating and continuous mixing.  To the plasma liquid 2kg Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was added and mixed until the NaHCO3 dissolved, then the solution was heated to 80°C.  Denatured plasma protein was then recovered and placed on filter paper to dry.  The solid sediment was then pressed to produce a 60kg solid plasma-protein "block" which was then lyophilised by standard procedures. After this process the plasma-protein weighed approximately 8kg and was used in the preparation of the COX-2   inhibitor preparation as  described below.<br>
A solution was then prepared comprising 152 litres of water, 8kg dried plasma-protein as prepared above and 200ml of a metal-containing solution. The constituents of the metal-containing solution are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
TABLE 1<br>
METAL-CONTAINING SOLUTION<br><br>
Made up in a 200ml solution with water, which was then stirred for at least 20 minutes.<br><br>
The mixture was then heated up to 12 0°C and maintained for two hours with constant mixing.  During this time the plasma-protein dissolved and was sterilized.  The resulting material was then held at a temperature of about 35°C and 0.125g/l of trypsin was added. The material was then allowed to incubate for approximately 2 hours. The digested material was then autoclaved and cooled to produce the COX-2 inhibitor composition of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 2      MANUFACTURE OF A TOPICAL COX-2 INHIBITOR COMPOSITION<br>
A composition comprising the ingredients shown in Table 2 were mixed at 75-80°C in a 250 litre vacuum homogenizer equipped with anchor and turbo mixers. Then the ingredients shown in Table 3 were added and the mixing was continued at 80-83°C for 10 minutes with the aid of the turbo mixer.<br>
A slow cooling process was then carried out using the anchor mixer.  When the material reached 60°C, the vacuum was switched on until the end of the cooling.<br>
At 40-45°C  the  ingredients  shown  in  Table  4   were added and mixed for 10 minutes.  Mixing with the anchor mixer was continued until the mixture reached 25°C.<br>
After a standing period of approximately 24 hours, the topical COX-2 inhibitor was ready for use.<br><br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 3       CLINICAL TRIAL ON TOPICAL COX-2 INHIBITOR COMPOSITION<br>
Twenty-three (23) randomly selected patients in a general practice setting were supplied with a preparation produced according to Example 2 above. The patients we advised to apply the preparation topically three times daily.<br>
Patients were reviewed at regular intervals and divided into two groups:<br>
Group A  -    work or injury induced conditions either acute or sub-acute eg repetitive strain injury (RSI), tennis elbow, joint and musculo-tendinous injury;<br>
Group B   -    Arthritic and aging conditions - sub-acute and chronic eg osteoarthritis.<br>

Pain relief obtained Pain relief obtained Condition not treatable with topical agent Pain relief obtained Non-specific arthritis Poor patient selection Topical application not effective for this rheumatoid arthritis-like condition Multiple pathologies<br><br>
While these data are more qualitative than quantitative, it is readily apparent that use of the topical COX-2 inhibitor composition produced effect.<br>
It was observed that in the more chronic situation, elderly, local arthritis {in particular osteo-arthritis), results were more predictable.  Clinically, it appears that local application of the topical COX-2 inhibitor to a pathological joint produces some effect.  This may in some way be related to the "massage" effect, and focusing attention of the positive aspects of treatment.<br>
One of the most important aspects of the trial was selection of patient.  Inventors believe that the nature of condition to be treated has an  affect on the ability of a topical agent to work effectively. Of the small numbers used in this trial, the best results were obtained with patients having single joint pain or relatively localized non-joint pain. A patient whose general health was reasonable was more important than the age of patient. Finally, non-weight bearing joints responded more quickly than weight bearing joints.<br>
Of the patients in Group A (acute and sub-acute), the best results were obtained where local rather than vague general inflammation was evident.  Repetitive strain injury was not helped by the use of the COX-2 inhibitor unless the condition was of the very local category - eg. Tennis-elbow.  Conversely, with the "arthritic" Group B pain from osteo-arthritis was definitely reduced whilst the COX-2 inhibitor was being used.  However, following cessation of treatment in may instance, the inflammation gradually returned.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br><br>
TREATMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS IN RANDOMIZED<br><br>
DOUBLE BLIND STUDY<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any particular hypothesis or theory, the inventors believe that the active agents within the COX-2 inhibitor compositions of the present invention are metallo-peptide complexes.  When used topically this preparation has been shown to be as effective as orally administered indocid (Indomethacin), a NSAID which reduces pain, swelling, and inflammation or phenylbutazone, a NSAID used in the treatment of pain, lameness, laminitis and osteoarthritis, in an animal model of inflammatory arthritis. The animal model was inflammation caused by an  injection  of mycobacteria   into the foot pads of Long-Evans rats (data not shown).<br>
In has also been demonstrated that the composition described in Example 2 possessed inhibitory activity against the serine proteinases-trypsin and human granulocyte elastase (HGE).  Since HGE has been implicated in the destruction of cartilage in inflammatory arthritis the inhibitory properties of the composition in Example 2 against this or similar enzymes may contribute to its overall biological activity.  Apart from these direct effects it is postulated that the compositions of the present invention might also work indirectly by acting as an agent for specific transdermal transport essential metals into the affected joints.<br>
In order to test some of these theories patients aged 18 or over were treated three times daily with either the composition described in Example 2 or a placebo. Neither the patient nor the physician was aware of which agent they received. All patients were assessed to have mild to moderate non-advanced osteoarthritis of hand joints or knee joints will be entered. The patients were assessed<br><br>
before using the composition and two weeks after commencement of treatment. Joint pain was assessed both via palpation, movement and scored by the following scale: 0 - Not Tender; 1 - Tender; 2 - Tender &amp; Winced; 3 -Tender, Winced &amp; Withdrew.<br>
Pain, morning stiffness and function were also subjectively assessed by the patient using the 10 cm visual analogue scale.<br>
At the end of the two weeks the patients were asked to assess the composition as to its efficacy, scoring a percentage between 0 - 100%.<br>
Twenty-two patients completed the trial - three males and nineteen females.  The average age was 60, and the distribution of placebo and composition was approximately equal throughout the age range.  The degree of severity and joints involved were also similar for the placebo and composition groups.  Thirteen patients used the composition from Example 2 and nine used the placebo. The results are shown in Table 6.<br><br>

This double-blind trial was carried out on patients with clinically well defined osteoarthritis, both placebo and drug treated groups having a similar degree of severity, average age and similar spread of joint involvement. Although the number of patients was not large there was a clear difference between the drug treated and the placebo groups (see Table 6).  These differences were shown to be statistically significant to the P 
The pain score both on palpation and movement was significantly reduced after two weeks of treatment with composition.  All measures via the visual analogue scale were also significantly reduced.  In contrast none of the parameters measured with the placebo group showed a significant reduction.<br>
When asked to assess the efficacy of the treatment composition, the treated group scored a 75% approval for product, while the placebo group only had a 45% approval rate.<br>
As the only difference between the two compositions was the plasma protein from Example 1, it must be assumed that this product was  responsible   for  the therapeutic effects observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 5      TOPICAL TREATMENT IN NON-HUMAN ANIMALS<br>
Arthritis is a very common problem in certain dog breeds such as Rottweilers with clinical signs usually becoming evident at about 4-6 months of age.<br>
This trial was therefore conducted on a "double blind" basis to ascertain whether or not the composition described in Example 2 was capable of reliving symptoms.<br><br>
Twenty-seven dogs were admitted into the trial, twenty-six Rottweilers (including one crossbred Rottweiler) and a Labrador.  There was a fairly even distribution of immature and mature dogs and both acute and chronic conditions being treated.  A brief summary of the individual results is given in Table 7.  The placebo was designated A, while the active agent was designated B.<br><br>

Results to come<br><br>
The most simple way to examine these results is to assess them on the basis of the "first used" treatment.  When this is done, the results are as follows:<br>
TUBE A	TUBE B<br>
No. of dogs treated            11	15<br>
No of dropouts                   2	2<br>
No. completing trial            9	13<br>
No. responding (less lame)       2	10<br>
% RESPONDING	22.2      76.9<br>
These results are at first glance better than we expected when we surveyed the combined results of the double-blind study.  However, the 77% response rate must be interpreted in the light of a 22% response rate to the placebo (Tube A).  Both these results may have been influenced by the weather patterns brought about by running this trial in the Spring.  A number of the dog owners suggested that warmer weather at the time of treatment may have been at least in part responsible for the improvement in their dog's lameness.  This comment is particularly applicable to Dog 14, which was recorded as a positive response but improved further on Tube A after finishing 2 weeks on Tube B.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6<br><br>
EVALUATION OF INHIBITORY ACTIVITY<br><br>
ON COX-2<br>
Methods employed in this Example have been adapted from the scientific literature to maximize reliability and reproducibility. Reference standards were run as an integral part of each assay to ensure the validity of the results obtained.<br>
Briefly, the COX-2 inhibitory activity was measured by the methods of Riendeau et al.,   1997, Can J Physiol   Pharmacol. 75: 1088 - 1095 and Warner et al., 1999, Proc Nati Acad Sci  USA 96(13): 7563-7568. Cyclooxygenase-2 source was human recombinant insect Sf21 cells. The substrate was 0.3µM arachidonic acid in the vehicle of 1% DMSO. The pre¬incubation time was 15 minutes at 37°C, while the incubation time was 5 minutes at 37°C.  The incubation buffer was l00mM Tris-HCl, pH7.7, 1mM glutathione, 1µM Hematin, 500µM phenol. The quantitation Method was EIA quantitation of PGE2, with a significance criteria of 50% of max stimulation or inhibition.<br>
The biochemical assay results are presented as the percent inhibition of specific binding or activity.  For primary assays, only the lowest concentration with a significant response judged by the assays' criteria is shown.  Where applicable, either the secondary assay results with the lowest dose/concentration meeting the significance criteria or, if inactive, the highest dose/concentration that did not meet the significance criteria is shown. Primary screening was conducted in duplicate with quantitative data e.g., IC50± SEM, Ki ± SEM and nH) are shown where applicable for individual assays. In screening packages, primary screening in duplicate with semi¬quantitative data {e.g. , estimated IC50, Ki and nH) are shown where applicable (concentration range of 4 log units); available secondary functional assays are carried<br><br>
out (30µM) and MEC or MIC determined only if active in primary assays &gt;50% at 1 log unit below initial test concentration.<br>
Significant responses (≥50% inhibition or stimulation for Biochemical assays) were noted in the primary assays.<br>
Table 8 shows the primary test for COX-2, while Table 9 shows the experimental results.<br><br>

In both assays the reference compound was Rofecoxib with an historical IC50 of 0.17µM and concurrent IC50 of 0.0992µM. These results are shown pictorially in Figures 1 and 2 .<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7       PREPARATION OF ANALGESIC AND ANTI¬INFLAMMATORY COMPOSITION<br>
An analgesic and anti-inflammatory composition was produced by the method outlined in Example 1. Basically, eighty litres of isolated plasma was mixed and incubated for 4 hours in the presence of 1% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) . The plasma protein was then heated to not higher than 80°C and allowed to precipitate. The resulting curd was filtered out, and allowed to air dry at 80°C to a moisture level of 10%. Fifty gram of the dried soluble protein was added to water to reach a 1 litre volume. The protein and water were heated to 80°C for 1 hour during which stage the protein dissolved. This mixture was cooled to 4 0°C. The temperature was maintained between 35-39°C while adding 0.125 gram of trypsin powder. This was stirred for 1.5 hours to produce a denatured plasma protein solution.<br>
Figures 3 to 5 show the soluble plasma protein fragments obtained by this method. In Figure 3, the major protein bands apparent in untreated plasma separated by SDS-PAGE are 50-80 kDa in size (Lane 6) Proteomic analysis of these bands identified them as consisting mainly of albumin, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen and transferrin (Figure  4).<br>
In contrast, the plasma protein before protease treatment consists mainly of polypeptides smaller than 50 kDa (Figure 3. Lane 2), while after trypsinisation the soluble plasma protein fragments are reduced to molecular weights of less than 25 kDa (10-20% tricine gradient gel, Figure 3. Lanes 3, 4).  Figure 5 shows the same samples on an 8% trisglycine gel.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 8       COX-2 INHIBITION<br>
Cyclooxygenase is the key enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. In 1991, several laboratories identified a product from a second gene with Cox activity and called it Cox-2. Cox-1 is widely distributed in the body's cells, from the stomach to the platelets of the blood. Continuously present in the body, they serve "housekeeping" functions that maintain various normal physiological conditions. Cox-2 is induced by inflammatory and other injurious stimuli, and they tend to localize in the sites of injury, for instance the swelled joints of people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. PGE2 has also been reported to enhance sensitization at the spinal cord  resulting in  hyperexcitability. Protective prostaglandins, which preserve the integrity of the stomach lining and maintain normal renal function in a compromised kidney, are synthesized by Cox-1. Gastrointestinal side effects of COX inhibitors are blamed for roughly 100,000 hospitalizations and 15,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. Therefore Cox-2 inhibitors, like Celebrex and Vioxx rapidly overhauled the non-selective Cox-inhibitory, like aspirin. However in late 2004, a major trial on long term treatment found that almost twice the subjects who took Vioxx for eighteen months had strokes or heart attacks than subjects on placebo. Vioxx was immediately withdrawn from the market. The strategy of using selective Cox-2 inhibitors is being reassessed. Most likely patients will benefit most when the treatment regime of non-selective Cox or Cox-2 inhibitors is taking into consideration possible Cox-inhibition sensitivities, treatment duration and route of application.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the soluble plasma test composition was found to inhibit the human platelet Cyclooxygenase-2<br><br>
(Cox-2) with an IC50 of 0.68% of the soluble plasma test composition solution.<br>
The soluble plasma test composition inhibited the binding of [3H] Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to its receptor on human recombinant HEK-293 cells with a Ki of 0.89% (IC50 = 2.0%) of the soluble plasma test composition solution. By inhibiting PGE2 to bind to the EP2 receptor, the test composition indirectly inhibits COX2.<br>
Table 10 shows the targets and the effects shown by the soluble plasma test composition of the present invention.<br><br>
TABLE 10<br><br>
Target	Effect	Effect of 10% test composition	K1	ICS0<br>
Cox-2	Inhibition	92%		0.7%<br>
PGE2 receptor	Binding	84%	0.9%	2.0%<br>
