				<td>Title: An herbal based composition for treating acute and chronic myeloid leukemia.<br>
Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to a herbal based composition for treatment of CD33+ acute and chronic myeloid leukemia by Piper betel leaf extracts, fractions of Piper betel leaf extracts and 3-O-//-coumaryl quinic acid purified from Piper betel leaves extract.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Myeloid leukemia, both acute (AML) and chronic (CML) are lethal, there is no drug directing towards the destruction of the myeloid cells and these cells poorly respond to chemotherapy, which is always non-specific, thus adversely affecting normal cells. Unique property of the therapy with Piper betel components is the killing of myeloid cancer cells by recognizing CD33+ marker on the cell membrane, leaving normal cells without getting affected.<br>
Myeloid leukemia is usually subdivided into two groups: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). AML is characterized by an increase in the number of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and an arrest in their maturation. In the United States, the annual incidence of AML is approximately 2.4 per 100,000 and it increases progressively with age, to a peak of 12.6 per 100,000 in adults of 65 years age or older. The CML is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells. The median age at presentation is 53 years, but it occurs at all age groups, including children. The natural history of CML is progression from a benign chronic phase to a rapidly fatal blast crisis within three to five years or even earlier. The prognosis of CML is also poor inspite of vast advancement of clinical medicine (1). CD33 represents a specific and useful marker in the process of myeloid cell differentiation (2). Recent reports suggest that engagement of CD33 by monoclonal antibody induced apoptosis leading to growth inhibition of proliferation of AML and CML cells in vitro (2,3). Exploiting the myeloid specific expression of CD33, humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated with anti-cancer drug has been tried in AML patients with significant success (4). With the extract from Piper betel leaves anti-myeloid activity was claimed earlier (Patent filed no. PCT/INOO/00118 dated December 12, 2000).<br>
Hence, applicant's earlier finding is in directed consonance with the present patent filing on Piper betel leaf extract, fractionated leaf extracts and purified compound 3-O-p-coumaryl quinic acid (Fig. 1) obtained from leaf extract for treating CD33+ acute and chronic myeloid leukemia.<br>
Piper betel leaves have a strong pungent aromatic flavour and are widely used in India as a masticatory. Generally, mature or overmature leaves, which have ceased growing but not yet become brittle are used for chewing. The basic preparation for chewing purposes consists of betel<br><br>
leaf smeared with hydrated lime and catechu to which scrapings of arecanut are added; flavourings such as coconut shavings, clove, cardamom, fennel, powdered liquorice, nutmeg and also tobacco are used according to one's taste. In some places prepared Piper betel leaf preparation is covered with silver or gold film. As a masticatory, it is credited with many properties: it is aromatic, digestive, stimulant and carminative. Medicinally it is useful in catarrhal and pulmonary infections; it is also used for poultices. The effects of chewing of betel leaves with arecanut and other adjuncts are the excitation of the salivary glands and the irritation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. The red coloration produced is due to a pigment in the arecanut, which manifests itself under the action of alkali in lime and catechu. A mild degree of stimulation is produced, resulting in a sensation of warmth and well-being, besides imparting a pleasant odour. The most important factor determining the aromatic value of the leaf is the amount and particularly the nature of the essential oil present. Betel leaves from different regions vary in smell and taste. The most pungent is the Sanchi type, while the most mild and sweet ones are from Varanasi. The betal leaves contain essential oils, the content of oil varies from 0.7 to 2.6 per cent depending upon the varieties of leaves. The oil consists of phenols and terpens. The higher the proportion of phenol the better the quality. An isomer of eugenol named chavibetol (betel phenol; 4-alkyl-2-hydroxy-lmethoxy benzene) is considered to be characteristic constituent of betel oil. Betel oil of Indian types contains a predominant phenolic constituent and used in the treatment of various respiratory problems, either as a local application or by gargle. It has carminative properties. It exhibits in different actions on the central nervous system of mammals. The essential oil and extracts of the leaves possess activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Micrococcus pyogenes var. Albus, Bacillus subtilis and B. Megaterium, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Eschenchia coli, Salmonella typhosa, Vibrio comma, Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris, Pdseudomonas solanacaerum, Sarcina lutea and Erwinia carotorora. The essential oil and leaf extracts also showed anti-fungal activity against Asperigillus niger and A. Ory:ae. Curvularia lunata and Fusarium oxysporum. The oil is found to be lethal in about 5 minutes to the protozoa, Paramaeceum caudatum (5). Steam-distillate of the leaves showed activity against Mycobacterium tyberculosis. References<br>

Collection of plant material<br>
The leaves and all other plant parts of Piper betel were collected from the climber from different areas and West Bengal, India. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Deptt. of Medicinal Chemistry at the Indian Inst. of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C. Mullick Road, Kolkata-700 032. Example 2<br>
Fresh leaves 5.3 kgs of Piper betel is thoroughly washed with distilled water. Leaves are cut into small pieces. It is then homogenized with distilled water 1.5 liter in a mixture-blender. The extract was filtered through a tine cheese-cloth and the filtrate was collected. The plant material inside the cloth was again extracted with water (1000 ml). The extract was filtered in a similar way. This process of extraction was repeated three times. The combined extract was centrifuged to obtain a clear solution. The clear extract was lyophilized yielding a semi-solid mass 150 gms. The extract was then tested for biological activity.<br>
A potion (10.02 gm) of the extract was fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. The column was eluted with water, water-methanol (1:1) and methanol as eluentto give three fractions, fractions 1-3, in the order of elution. The three fractions were then tested for biological activity.<br>
The fraction-2 (designated as Fraction E) showed biological activity, i.e., destruction of myeloid cells in human patients' ex vivo blood. Thin layer chromatography of this fraction showed two spots having Rf. 0.50 and 0.41 in the solvent system n-butanol: acetic acid : water (13:3:5). The HPLC analysis of this fraction showed several peaks as in Fig.l using Intersil ODS-3 (4.6x250 mm) analytical column, with a solvent system methanol: water: acetic acid (23:76:1), having flow rate of<br><br>
1.0 ml/min and detection at 280nm. With the retention time 3.60, 8.60, 9.30, 11.50, 12.70, 16.40, 19.20,20.00, 24.00 and 36.60 mins respectively.<br>
Each peak of this fraction E was separated in a preparative HPLC using u.-Bonda pak column (19x300 mm), with a flow rate 12ml/min and the detection at 280nm. Compounds isolated from individual peak were tested for biological activity as described above. A purified compound was isolated from the peak having retention time 24.00 min. The structure of the compound was established as 3-O-p-coumaryl quinic acid (Fig.2), mp. 245 to 247° C, [oc]D -75°(methanol).<br>

Example-3<br>
The fresh leaves and all other plant parts of Piper betel (1.2 kg) was homogenized with<br>
methanol (800 ml) in a mixture-blender and then sonicated in an ultrasonic bath with 3 burst each<br>
for 15 min and allowed to be extracted over night for 16 hrs. Filtering through Whatman No.l filter<br>
paper separated the methanol-extracted material. The process of extraction was repeated for three<br>
times. The combined extract was evaporated to dryness in a flash evaporator under reduced pressure<br>
at 40" C. The residual substance was then dried under high vacuum and the semi-solid mass (35.22<br>
gm) was tested for biological activity (as mentioned above).<br>
The methanol extract (14 gm) was chromatographed on Diaion HP-20 (380 gm),<br>
elution being carried out with water, water-methanol (1:1) and methanol. Eluted three<br>
fractions were tested for biological activity.<br>
HPTLC of water-methanol fraction (fraction E) showed similar Rf values (0.5 and 0.41) as<br>
described in example. Active compound, 3-O-p-coumaryl quinic acid was isolated from the fraction<br>
E by using preparative HPLC as described in example-2.<br>
