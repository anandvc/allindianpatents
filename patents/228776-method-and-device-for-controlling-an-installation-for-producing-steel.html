Method and device for controlling an installation for producing<br>
steel<br>
The invention relates to a method for controlling an<br>
installation for the production of steel which has defined<br>
materials properties that are dependent on the microstructure<br>
and can be influenced by operating parameters of the<br>
installation, which operating parameters are defined by means<br>
of a computation program for microstructure optimization.<br>
Steel has to be produced with the materials properties<br>
requested by the customer. Important materials properties of<br>
steel include, for example, the tensile strength, the yield<br>
strength and the elongation at break. These materials<br>
properties play an important role if the steel is intended for<br>
deep-drawing, for example for the production of automobile body<br>
panels or drinks cans.<br>
The materials properties of the steel result from its<br>
microstructure, which is turn influenced and defined by the<br>
production guidelines for the production process.<br>
During production, it is necessary to ensure that the chemical<br>
composition of the steel corresponds to the respective setpoint<br>
values. These setpoint values correspond to quantitative<br>
fractions which can be checked by a chemical laboratory<br>
analysis.<br>
To produce a steel which complies with the stipulations, it is<br>
also necessary to maintain defined operating parameters. These<br>
operating parameters include setpoint values for the melting,<br>
casting, heating, rolling and cooling phase. They may, for<br>
example, be temperatures, pressures, velocities or changes of<br>
these parameters over the course of time.<br><br>
A setpoint value for a defined quantitative fraction for an<br>
element or a setpoint value for an operating parameter always<br>
comprises a target value and a lower limit value and an upper<br>
limit value, between which the tolerance range lies.<br>
In steelworks or rolling mills, it is often difficult to define<br>
suitable setpoint values for production in such a way that the<br>
desired materials properties in the end product are produced<br>
under production conditions that are as low-cost as possible<br>
and involve the minimum possible risk. The demands of the<br>
customer, who for example orders a standardized steel grade for<br>
a specific application area, have to be implemented taking into<br>
the production processes used in the steelworks. These<br>
production processes include the works standards for the steel<br>
grade and also the target values and tolerance ranges for the<br>
individual production steps.<br>
In practice, however, the actual values from production always<br>
deviate from the setpoint values for the production process.<br>
The deviations in the actual values in a production step have<br>
to be counteracted in the subsequent steps in such a way that<br>
the required materials properties, for example the minimum<br>
value for the tensile strain, are achieved. If this value can<br>
no longer be achieved, the corresponding steel material (the<br>
melt, slab or coil) can no longer be used for the intended<br>
order. In this case, the processing of this part of the order<br>
has to be restarted at the first production step, which leads<br>
to financial losses and possibly also to delivery delays.<br>
The defining of suitable setpoint values for production is<br>
usually carried out by a planning department as part of<br>
technical order planning. The operator makes use of various<br>
technical tables, which are stored in a data processing<br>
installation, to convert the customer's order into a suitable<br>
production process for the plant,<br><br>
this production process being linked to defined setpoint<br>
values.<br>
For the steel, the quantitative fractions of the individual<br>
elements are defined and can be checked by a chemical<br>
laboratory analysis. This set of setpoint values is also<br>
referred to as the steel grade. The setpoint values for the<br>
operating parameters of the individual production steps are<br>
also defined. In the steelworks, the melt is produced and the<br>
slabs are cast from this melt. In the furnace, the slabs are<br>
heated for the rolling operation. In the hot-rolling mill, the<br>
slabs are rolled to form coils, and if appropriate further<br>
rolling is carried out in a cold-rolling mill, and/or<br>
qualitative heat treatment of the coils and if appropriate<br>
division into smaller formats are carried out.<br>
The situation often arises whereby a certain order can be<br>
produced by a plurality of alternative sets of setpoint values<br>
which result from the tables. To achieve the desired<br>
properties, the operator has to decide on one of these possible<br>
sets of setpoint values, since the production order to the<br>
production department only permits one set of setpoint values.<br>
The operator decides on a defined set of setpoint values based<br>
on his production experience. The entire know-how of the<br>
company relating to production operations is held within these<br>
technical tables, which are looked after by the quality<br>
division. New entries and changes in these tables result from<br>
long years of production experience and from test productions<br>
using sets of setpoint values which have been altered in steps.<br>
In recent years, mathematical methods have been developed for<br>
calculating the materials properties of steel. These methods<br>
include a physico-metallurgical model of the production process<br><br>
and determine the changes in the microstructure of the steel<br>
for each production step and then calculate the materials<br>
properties from this information.<br><br>
Individual production steps can be simulated on the computer in<br>
this way. For standard steel grades, it has been ascertained<br>
that the materials properties which are calculated are well<br>
matched to the values which are actually measured.<br>
EP 0 901 016 A2 has disclosed a mathematical method for<br>
determining properties of a steel. Typical variables, such as<br>
yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at break,<br>
hardness, etc. are supposed to be determined by means of a<br>
neural network.<br>
WO 99/24182 has disclosed a method for controlling a<br>
metallurgical installation for the production of steel or<br>
aluminum, in which steel is produced with defined materials<br>
properties that are dependent on the microstructure, the<br>
materials properties being dependent on operating parameters<br>
with which the installation is operated. The operating<br>
parameters are supposed to be defined by means of a<br>
microstructure optimizer as a function of the desired materials<br>
properties of the steel. The microstructure optimizer is a<br>
computation program for microstructure optimization which makes<br>
use of neural networks.<br>
However, a drawback is that the production planning is often<br>
unable to produce a successful production program, i.e. an<br>
appropriate sequence, since it is restricted to one set of<br>
setpoint values per production order. One such example is melt<br>
planning, which has to combine a large number of production<br>
orders with different steel grades and dimensions in the form<br>
of melts and sequences, i.e. technically compatible sequences<br>
of melts. Only orders of one steel grade can be processed in<br>
one melt, and only melts with compatible steel grades can<br>
follow one another in one sequence. The stock of orders often<br>
comprises a large number of qualitatively similar orders of<br>
small quantities which, however, have different steel grades.<br><br>
This situation often leads to poor production programs, since<br>
the number of possible melts in the program is small and the<br>
individual melts<br><br>
often have to be filled with what are known as store orders,<br>
since there is an absence of customer orders for suitable<br>
qualities .<br>
Another drawback is that the quality department has to spend<br>
considerable money and time on optimizing sets of setpoint<br>
values with regard to the demands on the materials properties<br>
and with regard to production costs. The large number of<br>
production tests required, with modified sets of setpoint<br>
values, and the testing of the materials properties using<br>
laboratory specimens which in each case ensues, lead to high<br>
levels of outlay. Therefore, many sets of setpoint values are<br>
compromised in terms of reliability with regard to the desired<br>
target values and tolerance ranges since they have had to be<br>
derived from an inadequate number of production tests. Larger<br>
tolerance ranges and more cost-effective target values for<br>
certain materials properties can only be implemented after a<br>
steel grade has been produced for a number of years.<br>
In principle, the control systems of the individual production<br>
units attempt to maintain their setpoint values for the output<br>
variables even if the input values, i.e. the actual values from<br>
the preceding step, deviate. If a slab arrives at the rolling<br>
train from the furnace at a temperature which is too cold, the<br>
control system of the rolling train nevertheless attempts to<br>
reach its setpoint value for the output temperature of the<br>
rolled strip by suitably changing the control variables of the<br>
control system. This only works for setpoint values which can<br>
still be influenced, for example incorrect temperatures or<br>
dimensions which can be changed to a certain extent. However,<br>
it is not possible for a steel with an incorrect chemical<br>
analysis, i.e. with incorrect quantitative fractions of the<br>
alloying elements, to be altered in the subsequent rolling<br>
mill.<br><br>
If the deviations cannot be tolerated, for example because<br>
individual elements in the chemical analysis infringe the limit<br>
values, the current intermediate product is qiven up for this.<br><br>
order. Production planning then has to produce further material<br>
with a high priority, but this leads to time delays. The<br>
current intermediate material is either switched to other<br>
suitable orders, i.e. reassigned, or is if necessary switched<br>
to store orders without any associated customer request, or is<br>
removed from production and placed in an intermediate store.<br>
The final option is for the material to be designated scrap and<br>
return to the resource circuit.<br>
Therefore, the invention is based on the problem of providing a<br>
method for controlling an installation for producing steel<br>
which can plan orders more flexibly and can react more flexibly<br>
to deviations from the setpoint values.<br>
To solve this problem, it is provided, in a method of the type<br>
described in the introduction, that at the same time the<br>
setpoint values for the chemical composition of the steel are<br>
defined by means of the computation program for microstructure<br>
optimization.<br>
Unlike in known methods, the computation program for<br>
microstructure optimization defines not only the operating<br>
parameters, which have an influence on the materials<br>
properties, but also at the same time the setpoint values for<br>
the chemical composition of the steel. The term "at the same<br>
time" also encompasses methods in which, for example, in a<br>
first computation operation the setpoint values for the<br>
chemical composition are determined, and then in a second<br>
computation operation the operating parameters are determined,<br>
or vice versa. The individual computation operations can take<br>
place in succession, but the setpoint values for the chemical<br>
composition and the operating parameters are always taken into<br>
account. Accordingly, the solution has significantly more<br>
degrees of freedom available to it, since for each order it is<br>
not just a single, predefined set of setpoint values which can<br><br>
be used, but rather a plurality of sets of setpoint values. It<br>
was not hitherto possible to correct a set of setpoint values,<br>
since the operator of a production unit<br><br>
was not able to determine or stipulate the necessary effects on<br>
the downstream production steps. However, the computation<br>
program for microstructure optimization makes it possible for<br>
the required adjustments to setpoint values for subsequent<br>
production steps to be calculated on-line from the previous<br>
production results, taking account of the required materials<br>
properties.<br>
The invention is based on the discovery that when defining the<br>
setpoint values, not only the individual production step, but<br>
rather the entire possible solution range for variations in<br>
setpoint values can be taken into account in order to achieve<br>
the required materials properties. This solution range with<br>
setpoint values which are dependent on one another even across<br>
production steps contains many more degrees of freedom and<br>
accordingly many more possible solutions than have hitherto<br>
been used.<br>
As a result of the computation program for microstructure<br>
optimization being used to define the setpoint values for the<br>
chemical composition of the steel and the operating parameters<br>
at the same time, production planning can be made significantly<br>
more flexible. Moreover, continuous on-line quality control can<br>
be carried out during the individual production steps. This<br>
improved production planning allows all possible variations in<br>
the setpoint values to be included in the calculation, so that<br>
better production programs can be produced from the available<br>
stock of orders, i.e. longer sequences of melts and fewer<br>
filler orders in the melts.<br>
The method according to the invention ensures that during<br>
production deviations in individual actual values from the<br>
setpoint values are compensated for by calculating the changes<br>
required to subsequent setpoint values, so that even deviations<br>
which have not hitherto been tolerable can now be tolerated.<br><br>
Consequently, the method according to the invention means that<br>
the tolerance<br><br>
ranges for the quantitative fractions of the elements contained<br>
in the steel can be widened.<br>
It is expedient if the setpoint values for the chemical<br>
composition and if appropriate correspondingly calculated<br>
operating parameters for a defined steel application are in<br>
each case combined in a data record. As a result of an<br>
optimization calculation, a data record for a specific steel<br>
application is selected by the computation program and output<br>
as a result of an optimum combination of data records for the<br>
respective steel application of the orders to be planned being<br>
selected during production planning.<br>
In the method according to the invention, it can be provided<br>
that the actual values for the chemical composition of the<br>
steel and the actual values for the operating parameters are<br>
compared with the setpoint values, and if deviations are<br>
present the computation program for microstructure optimization<br>
is run through again. The result of this calculation can result<br>
in the selection of a different set of setpoint values which is<br>
better matched to the actual values. As a result, the number of<br>
possible combinations is considerably increased, and in the<br>
event of a deviation between actual values and setpoint values,<br>
the steel product can still be used with a high degree of<br>
probability for the intended purpose, as a result of the<br>
further production steps being carried out with a modified set<br>
of setpoint values.<br>
According to one configuration of the method according to the<br>
invention, it can be provided that a setpoint value is assigned<br>
a tolerance range, which lies between an upper limit and a<br>
lower limit, and the computation program for microstructure<br>
optimization is run through again in order to define setpoint<br>
values for the chemical composition of the steel and/or for the<br>
operating parameters in the event of values which lie outside<br>
the tolerance range.<br><br>
It can be provided that the computation program for<br>
microstructure optimization optimizes the setpoint values with<br>
a view to one or more<br><br>
optimization variables. It may be expedient for the<br>
optimization calculations to be carried out with a view to<br>
minimizing materials costs and/or production costs. By way of<br>
example, it is possible to save on certain expensive alloying<br>
elements by carrying out certain treatment steps at altered<br>
temperatures.<br>
A particular advantage of the method according to the invention<br>
is that during and/or after a production step, a quality check<br>
is carried out by comparing the setpoint values with the actual<br>
values by means of the computation program for microstructure<br>
optimization. As a result, it is possible to dispense with<br>
relatively slow and expensive laboratory tests, the validity of<br>
which is however only limited in many cases. The computation<br>
program for microstructure optimization continuously checks all<br>
the steel products, such as melt, slab or coil, in terms of<br>
their materials properties and compliance with the setpoint<br>
values, so that true material tests, for example in the form of<br>
tensile tests, can be reduced to occasional quality control<br>
tests.<br>
In a hot-rolling mill, it is recommended for the quality check<br>
to be carried out at various points during the production<br>
sequence. The linking of the slabs to the production order in<br>
the slab yard, the exit of the heating furnace, the exit of the<br>
roughing stand and the exit of the coiler at the end of the<br>
production line are particularly suitable for this purpose. At<br>
each checkpoint, the computation program for microstructure<br>
optimization calculates the expected materials properties from<br>
the actual values from production which are known by that stage<br>
and the subsequent process with the associated setpoint values.<br>
If the required materials properties cannot be achieved in the<br>
subsequent steps with the current setpoint values, the<br>
microstructure optimizer automatically attempts to adapt the<br>
setpoint values. If the calculation gives a positive result,<br>
the quality check enables the adjustment of the setpoint<br><br>
values. If the calculation does not give a result, the qualityt<br><br>
check, with the aid of the computation program for<br>
microstructure optimization, searches the setpoint value lists<br>
of the stock of orders for an inexpensive, appropriate set of<br>
setpoint values and switches the intermediate material to this<br>
order. As a result, new setpoint values are also defined for<br>
the subsequent production steps.<br>
It is possible to provide that the method according to the<br>
invention be coupled to the production planning of the<br>
installation for steel production. The production planning and<br>
the quality check are modules of the production control system<br>
(manufacturing execution system). Accordingly, the method<br>
according to the invention can also be directly coupled to the<br>
production control system of the installation for steel<br>
production.<br>
The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the<br>
method described for controlling an installation for producing<br>
steel. According to the invention, it is provided that the<br>
computation program for microstructure optimization is designed<br>
to define the setpoint values for the chemical composition of<br>
the steel and the associated operating parameters at the same<br>
time.<br>
Further advantages and details of the invention will emerge<br>
from the exemplary embodiment described below and with<br>
reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts the way in which the<br>
microstructure optimizer operates;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the change in the mechanical properties of a<br>
steel as a function of the temperature and the element<br>
content;<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows the interaction of the microstructure optimizer<br>
with a production control system;<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows a flow chart illustrating the individual method<br>
steps;<br>
Fig. 5 shows the execution of the quality check during<br>
production; and<br>
Fig. 6 shows the determination of optimum setpoint values for<br>
the entire production path.<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts the way in which the<br>
microstructure optimizer operates for optimizing alloying<br>
costs. The computation program for microstructure optimization,<br>
referred to below as microstructure optimizer 1, receives<br>
setpoint values 2 for the chemical composition and setpoint<br>
values 3 for the operating parameters of the desired process.<br>
The setpoint values 2, 3 together result in what is known as a<br>
steel grade, which is based on experience and takes into<br>
account all the information required for production of the<br>
respective order. The materials properties of the steel<br>
produced can be influenced by operating parameters of the<br>
installation, including treatment temperatures and pressures,<br>
and if appropriate also the time derivatives thereof.<br>
Mathematical models, which simulate the behavior of the<br>
material and determine the changes in the microstructure of the<br>
steel for each production step, are implemented in the<br>
microstructure optimizer 1. The microstructure optimizer 1 can<br>
also operate using the neural network method. As a result, the<br>
microstructure optimizer 1, after the execution of optimization<br>
calculations, delivers modified setpoint values 4 for the<br>
chemical composition of the steel, which allow production costs<br>
to be reduced compared to the setpoint values 2. By way of<br>
example, it is possible to aim to reduce the levels of<br>
relatively expensive alloying materials, such as niobium,<br>
manganese or titanium, without any deterioration in the<br><br>
materials properties. Modified setpoint values 5 for the<br>
production processes are coupled to the modified setpoint<br>
values for the chemical composition. The setpoint values 4, 5<br>
together form a set of setpoint values which forms the basis<br>
for production.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the change in the mechanical properties of an<br>
element as a function of the temperature and the element<br>
content.<br>
The microstructure optimizer 1 is intended to optimize, i.e.<br>
minimize, production costs. One of the ways of reducing costs<br>
consists in reducing the element content of a specific chemical<br>
element, in particular an alloying element. The element content<br>
of a specific element is plotted on the horizontal axis in<br>
Fig. 2. The temperature is plotted on the vertical axis. The<br>
lines 6 shown in Fig. 2 indicate combinations of the element<br>
content and the temperature having the same mechanical .<br>
property. A specific steel has hitherto been produced using the<br>
element content indicated by point 7. However, it is known that<br>
the property shown in Fig. 2, which may for example be the<br>
strength, remains constant if point 7 is shifted in the<br>
direction of the arrow toward point 8. In^practice, this means<br>
that the content of the respective alloying element can be<br>
reduced, while at the same time the setpoint value for the<br>
temperature for a specific production step has to be increased.<br>
Reducing the quantitative fractions of this element results in<br>
a reduction in the costs, while the mechanical properties of<br>
the steel remain the same.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the interaction of the microstructure optimizer 1<br>
with a production control system. The production control system<br>
9, also known as the manufacturing execution system (MES),<br>
comprises, inter alia, the production planning and the quality<br>
check. The microstructure monitor is a calculation module which<br>
calculates materials properties, such as the strength or yield<br>
strength, on the basis of input data. As a result, time-<br>
consuming laboratory tests can be substantially replaced. If it<br>
is established, after execution of a calculation by the<br>
microstructure monitor, that a mechanical property cannot be<br>
complied with, the microstructure optimizer 1<br><br>
analyzes whether the steel product in question, by changing the<br>
setpoint values, can still be treated in such a way that it<br>
lies within the appropriate tolerances. The actual values 10,<br>
which are input variables for the microstructure monitor or the<br>
microstructure optimizer 1, comprise the quantitative fractions<br>
of the individual chemical elements, process temperatures, etc.<br>
Setpoint values 11 output are operating parameters and process<br>
parameters which form the basis for the further production<br>
steps.<br>
The coupling of the microstructure optimizer 1 with the level<br>
of the production control system 9 allows costs to be reduced,<br>
since optimized steel grades are used for production. Time can<br>
be saved during the quality checking of coils, since the<br>
microstructure monitor substantially replaces laboratory tests.<br>
Nevertheless, materials properties are calculated for each<br>
coil, so that the probability of defects is reduced. A further<br>
advantage is that there are more degrees of freedom available<br>
for production planning. Hitherto, there has been a single<br>
standardized steel grade with predetermined setpoint values for<br>
rolling and cooling for each order. By contrast, with the<br>
method according to the invention, there are a number of<br>
presets available per order which each satisfy the required<br>
materials properties. Each preset comprises the works standard,<br>
which indicates the steel grade including the setpoint values<br>
for rolling and cooling. From the plurality of presets, the<br>
microstructure optimizer 1 can calculate and select the one<br>
which entails the lowest production costs.<br>
The order planning supplies melt planning with a list of<br>
alternative works standards that can achieve the materials<br>
properties and, in addition, suitable setpoint values<br>
calculated by means of the microstructure optimizer, for each<br>
order. This results in very many more degrees of freedom for<br>
the planning of the melts. It is possible to form larger<br>
sequences<br><br>
and the number of steel grade changes is reduced. It is also<br>
possible to reduce the number of filler orders in the melts.<br>
The production<br><br>
can be carried out using a smaller number of steel grades by-<br>
virtue of order-specific properties being compensated for by<br>
calculated rolling and cooling conditions. Order planning<br>
supplies melt planning with more orders using the same grade of<br>
steel in order to achieve better production programs. The<br>
microstructure optimizer calculates suitable setpoint values<br>
for the order-specific materials properties.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flow chart illustrating the individual method<br>
steps based on the example of a hot-rolling mill.<br>
Prior to the beginning of production, the costs relating to the<br>
chemical analysis are optimized off-line. The result of this<br>
optimization can be utilized in method step 12 in order to<br>
modify the source data for the production control system. Order<br>
planning 13 can offer melt planning a wide range of steel<br>
grades for planning for each order. In the production plan,<br>
melt planning optimizes the costs with regard to the materials<br>
properties. An on-line quality check 15 is carried out, in<br>
which the linking of a slab to an order is either saved or the<br>
slab is reassigned on-line. A further on-line quality check 16<br>
is carried out following the heating in the furnace or the<br>
rolling in the roughing stand. After a further on-line quality<br>
check 17 downstream of the coiler, the coil can be released<br>
immediately, thereby terminating the method.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the execution of the quality check during the<br>
production.<br>
The current process data pass from the furnace or the roughing<br>
stand 18 to the production control system (MES) 9. In step 19,<br>
it is checked whether the required materials properties can be<br>
achieved. If the result is "yes", production is continued with<br>
the existing setpoint values. If<br><br>
the result is "no", the setpoint values for the order have to<br>
be adapted in step 20. For this purpose, the production control<br>
system 9 interacts with the microstructure monitor and<br>
microstructure optimizer 1 and receives modified setpoint<br>
values. On the basis of the modified setpoint values, method<br>
step 21 checks whether the strength can be achieved using the<br>
modified setpoint values. If the strength can be achieved,<br>
production is continued using the modified setpoint values. If<br>
the strength cannot be achieved, a reassignment request is<br>
output in order to link the slab to a different order. The<br>
number of reassignments is reduced, and the modification to the<br>
setpoint values in many cases allows the slab to be saved for<br>
the existing order. The slabs or coils which are not suitable<br>
for the existing order are immediately reassigned without<br>
further production steps being carried out.<br>
Fig. 6 shows, in a diagram, the determination of optimum<br>
setpoint values for the entire production sequence.<br>
The method determines optimum setpoint values for the entire<br>
production sequence, with the individual operations and<br>
treatment steps of the manufacturing sequence being modeled and<br>
simulated by computation. The basis for the optimization<br>
calculation is the chemical analysis 22, the results of which<br>
form input variables for the continuous - casting 23. This is<br>
followed by hot-rolling 24 and cold-rolling 25. To improve the<br>
microstructure, the cold-rolling is followed by an annealing<br>
operation 26. All the individual treatment steps are input into<br>
the mathematical models of the microstructure optimizer 1, so<br>
that the latter can determine optimum setpoint values taking<br>
account of the entire production sequence. The microstructure<br>
optimizer 1 is in turn linked to the production control system<br>
(MES) 9, and accordingly the production can be controlled as a<br>
function of the results of the microstructure optimizer 1.<br>
Overall, the method allows considerable energy and<br><br>
materials costs to be saved. In addition, expert knowledge is<br>
built up about the overall process.<br><br>
