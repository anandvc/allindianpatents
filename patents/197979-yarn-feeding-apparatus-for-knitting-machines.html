				<td>This invention relates to knitting machines, and more particularly, to a yam-feeding apparatus for knitting machines which is provided with a replaceable yam-feeding reel. 2. Description of Related Art:<br>
Knitting machines are production tools used to manufacture fabrics. Conventionally, cotton threads are used to be knitted into fabrics. However, with advances in textile technology, artificial threads are increasingly used to make fabrics. The artificial threads are thin but firm in strength so that they can be fed with high speed to make fabrics more quickly. Since the cotton threads and artificial threads differ in quality and strength, they are fiimished by winding them on different types of yam-feeding reels. However, since conventional knitting machines are usually formed with an integrally formed yam-feeding reel, only one kind of the threads can be used on the knitting machines. This drawback will be described in more detail in the following v\ith reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a sectional view of a conventional yam-feeding apparatus. This yam-feeding apparatus includes a yam-feeding reel W which is integrally formed with a driving shaft Wl. A sleeve W2 is coupled axially to the bottom of the shaft Wl. The shaft Wl is rotatably mounted on the frame of the knitting machine by means of a pair of bearings 14A, 14B, a sleeve 15A, and a cover 16. The top end of the shaft Wl is coupled to a pair of puUey wheels 12 and an engaging means 11 which engages the pulley wheels 12 to a diiving means (not shown). A screw W4 is fastened to the topmost end of the shaft Wl so as to secure the pulley wheels 12 in position.<br>
One drawback to the foregoing yam-feeding appai'atus is that the yam-feeding reel W thereof is integi-ally formed with the shaft Wl. Therefore, when the fabrics manufacturers wants to manufacture t^vo different kinds of fabrics by using cotton threads<br><br>
and artificial threads , the manufacturer needs to purchase and install at least two types of knitting machines so as to be able to supply the two different kinds of threads.<br>
One somewhat cost-effective solution to the foregoing problem is to dismount the yam-feeding reel W for replacement of a new one that supplies the desired kind of threads. However, since the yam-feeding reel W is integrally formed with the shaft Wl, dismounting the yam-feeding reel W requires also the dismounting of the shaft Wl. To dismount the shaft Wl, the puUey wheels 12, the engaging means 11, the cover 16, the bearings 14A, 14B, and the sleeves ISA, 15B, W2 should be disassembled. This task is extremely laborious and time-consuming to do. The manufacturing cost for making fabrics from both cotton threads and artificial threads is therefore very high. There exists, therefore, a need for a yam-feeding apparatus which has a replaceable yam-feeding reel which can be replaced with a new one effortlessly and quickly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a primary objective of the present invention to provide a yam-feeding apparatus for a knitting machine which allows the yam-feeding reel mounted thereon to be easily replaceable with another type of yam-feeding reel.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing and other objectives of the present invention, an improved yam-feeding apparatos for a knitting machine is provided. The yam-feeding apparatus includes a frame and a shaft mounted on the frame. The shaft has a first end coupled to a driving means and a second end formed with a screw hole. The shaft is rotatabty supported by the frame by means of a pair of bearings, a pair of sleeves, and a cover in conjunction with at least one screw. A yam-feeding reel is rotatably coupled to the bottom end of the shaft by means of a sleeve, a washer, and a screw or a bolt. The screw or bolt fastens thiough the sleeve, the washer, and the axis hole in the yam-feeding reel to the screw hole foimed in the bottom end of the shaft, so as to secure the yam-feeding reel in position on the bottom end of the shaft.<br><br>
To dismount the yam-feeding reel, the technician needs just to loosen the screw or the bolt, and the yam-feeding reel can be easily detached from the bottom end of the shaft. A new yam-feeding reel can then be mounted. Both the dismounting and mounting tasks are easy to carry out by the technician.<br>
In conclusion, the invention allows various types of yam-feeding reels to be replaceable on one knitting machine. This benefit allows the manufacturer to invest on only one type of knitting machine and still can perform the knitting of various fabrics with different types of yam-feeding reels that supply different sorts of threads.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a yam-feeding apparatus for a knitting machine, comprising a frame; a shaft having a first end coupled to a driving means and a second end formed with a screw hole; a pair of bearings, having a bottom bearing and an upper bearing, for supporting said shaft on said frame; a pair of sleeves, having a bottom sleeve and an upper sleeve coupled axially to said pair of bearings, for supporting said shaft on said frame; a cover having at least one screw hole therein, said cover being coupled axially to said shaft; at least one screw which fastens through a hole formed in said frame to the screw hole in said cover so as to secure said shaft securely on said frame; a yam-feeding reel having an axis hole; a sleeve axially coupled to said yam-feeding reel; a washer axially coupled to said yam-feeding reel; and a fastening means, which fastens through said sleeve, said washer, and the axis hole in said yam-feeding reel to the screw hole formed in the bottom end of the shaft so as to secure said yam-feeding reel in position on the bottom end of the shaft.<br><br>

DET.4ILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERI-t.ED P:iMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a first prefeired embodiment of the yam-feeding apparatu.s according to the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a sectional view of part<br><br>
of the yam-feeding apparatus of FIG. 1. As shown, the yam-feeding apparatus includes a frame 10 on which a pulley wheel 12 and an engaging wheel 11 which couples the pulley wheel 12 to a transmission means (not shown) are mounted. The pulley wheel 12 is coupled axially to a shaft 13 so as to be driven by (he same. The shaft 13 is axially supported by a bottom bearing 14A, a bottom sleeve 15A, an upper bearing 14B, and an upper sleeve 15B, and which is secured in position on the frame 10 by fastening a pair of screws 16A through a pair of holes in the frame 10 into a pair of coiTesponding screw holes 17A in a metal cover 17.<br>
Further, the bottom end of the shaft 13 is formed with a screw hole (see FIG. 2) which allows the bottom end of the shaft 13 to be axially coupled to a yam-feeding reel 30 by means of a sleeve 18, an elastic washer 18A, and a screw 18 B. This yam-feeding reel 30 is an integrally formed solid body of metal having an axis hole 34 and a thread-winding surface coated with an electrical insulation material.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the yam-feeding reel 30 can be easily mounted in position by first inserting the bottom end of the shaft 13 into the axis hole 34 in the yam-feeding reel 30, and then fastening the screw 18B through the washer 18a and the sleeve 18 into the screw hole formed in the bottom end of the shaft 13. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 2 A, a bolt 18D can be used instead of the screw 18B to secured the yam-feeding reel 30 in position on the bottom end of the shaft 13.<br>
To dismount the yam-feeding reel 30, the technician needs just to loosen the screw 18B (the embodiment of FIG. 2) or the bolt 18D (the embodiment of FIG. 2A), and the yam-feeding reel 30 can be easily detached from the bottom end of the shaft 13. A new type of yam-feeding reel can then be mounted. Both the dismounting and mounting tasks are easy to carry out by the technician.<br>
Referring further to FIGs. 3 and 3 A, there are shown a second preferred embodiment of the yam-feeding apparatus according to the present invention. This embodiment is substantially identical in stmcture as the previous embodiment except that in<br><br>
this embodiment a grid-type yam-fee(feg reel 30 A is used instead of the solid-type yam-feeding reel 30 in the previous embodiment.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 3, before coupling the grid-type yam-feeding reel 30A to the bottom end of the shaft 13, a sleeve 34A is coupled to the shaft 13, and then the sleeve 18 and washer 18A are coupled to the shaft 13. Finally, the grid-type yam-feeding reel 30A is secured in position by fastening the screw 18B to the screw hole in the bottom end of the shaft 13. Altematively, as shown in FIG. 3 A, a washer 18C can be first coupled to the shaft 13, and then a bolt 18D is fastened to the bottom end of the shaft 13.<br>
To dismount the grid-type yam-feeding reel 30A, the technician needs just to loosen the screw 18B (the embodiment of FIG. 3) or the bolt 18D (the embodiment of FIG. 3A), and the grid-type yam-feeding reel 30A can be easily detached from the bottom end of the shaft 13. A new type of yam-feeding reel can then be mounted. Both the dismounting and mounting tasks are easy to carry out by the technician.<br>
In conclusion, the invention allows various types of yam-feeding reels to be replaceable on one knitting machine. This benefit allows the manufacturer to invest on only one type of knitting machine and still can perform the knitting of various fabrics with different types of yam-feeding reels that supply different sorts of threads.<br>
