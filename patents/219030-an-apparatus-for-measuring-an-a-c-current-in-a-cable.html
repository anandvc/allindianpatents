AN APPARATUS FOR MEASURING AN A.C. CURRENT IN A CABLE<br>

3.     PREAMBLE OF THE DESCRIPTION:-<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
l<br><br>
An Apparatus for Measuring an A.C. Current in a Cable<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for measuring an alternating current flowing in an electric cable, for example an ax. mains cable.<br>
 5<br>
The present state of the art of measuring current in two or three core round cables is described in US Patent 5,652,506. Part of the coil arrangement used in this prior apparatus is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
10     Eight identical wire-wound coils are used in total in the previous arrangement. For clarity sake, only four of these are shown in Fig. I. The four coils shown pick up the x component Hx of magnetic field only from the cable 10. The other four identical coils, not shown in this diagram, are located at the same centres as the four shown; however they are wound in a plane which is normal to the plane of<br>
15     the four shown in order to pick up the y component Hy of magnetic field only.<br>
           Coil 1 and coil 2 are the main pickup coils for the Hx component of magnetic field and are connected in phase addition. Coil 3 and coil 4 are connected in phase opposition to coil 1 and coil 2. Coil 3 and coil 4 are used only to reduce the <br>
2 0     pickup of stray magnetic fields from other possible, interfering current sources which are external to the coil arrangement<br>
The magnetic field pick-up of coil 1 and coil 2 from the current source to be measured is larger than the pickup by coil 3 and coil 4 since coils 3 and 4 are<br>
2	5      further away from the current source.  Thus, when the output from coils 3 and 4 is<br>
subtracted from coils 1 and 2 the result is not zero. Therefore a voltage pickup proportional to the Hx component of magnetic field from the current source is present at the input to the amplifier AMP1.<br>
3	0     For sources external and further away from the coil arrangement, however, the<br>
magnetic field created is much more uniform in magnitude and direction in the vicinity of the coils and the pickup from coils 3 and 4 almost completely cancels<br>
2<br><br>
out the pickup from coils 1 and 2, significantly reducing any errors incurred due to other interfering current sources in the vicinity of the apparatus.<br>
        At the output of the amplifier AMPl there is a voltage Vx which is proportional to <br>
5      the magnetic field component Hx created by the current flowing out in one conductor of the cable 10 and returning in the other.<br>
The other four coils, picking up the Hy component, are connected identically to the four shown and are amplified separately by a similar amplifier AMP2, not<br>
1	o      shown. At the output of AMP2, therefore, a voltage Vy exists which is<br>
proportional to the Hy component of magnetic field.<br>
          It is useful at this stage to examine the Hx and Hy components of magnetic field      created by a current I flowing out in one conductor of the cable 10 and returning <br>
15     in a second conductor of the cable, located a distance d away from the first conductor, as shown in Fig. 2.  For the present it is assumed that the two conductors do not twist or rotate as they extend along the length of the cable.<br>
Since the cable is round, no information is available as to the orientation angle 0<br>
2	0      of the coils to the conductors and 0 is treated as a variable. Under these<br>
circumstances<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
25<br><br><br>
Referring back to Fig. 1, if coil 1 is at an angle 6 to the current-carrying<br>
 3 0      conductors, then coil 2, which is located diametrically opposite to coil 1, has an<br>
3 <br>
angle q + 180° to the conductors and it is seen from equation (1) that Hx is identical for angles q and q + 180°. When coils 1 and 2 are connected in phase addition, therefore, the pickup voltage is double the pickup voltage of one of these coils on its own.<br>
 5<br>
       A similar analysis applies to the other coils picking up the Hy component of magnetic field as given by equation (2).<br>
         If the magnitude of the magnetic field | H | is then computed from the Hx and Hy <br>
10      components given by equations (1) and (2) respectively, the following result is obtained:<br><br><br><br><br>
15<br>
Now Vx, the output voltage of AMP 1, is proportional to Hx, and Vy, the output voltage of AMP2, is proportional to Hy.<br>
V is evaluated from Vx and Vy, as follows:<br>
20<br><br><br><br>
Where K is a constant that depends on the area and number of the coil turns and 25      the amplifier gain.<br>
4<br><br>
The computed voltage V is a maximum at 6 = 90° and is given by<br><br><br>
5      and V is a minimum when 6 = 0°<br><br><br><br><br>
10      The average value of V is approximately<br><br><br>
        Equation (7) is the equation used to evaluate the current I, since K and r are <br>
15     known, and d can be estimated fairly accurately in the previously patented technique.<br>
           For I fixed, however, there is an inherent variation in the measured voltage V as the coil positions around the cable vary as indicated by equations (5) and (6).<br>
 20      The maximum variation from equation (7) depends on the value of d^r2. For d/r = J4 there is a maximum variation (error) of ± 6.3%. For d/r 
2 5     The reason the performance is worse than indicated by equation (4) is primarily due to the fact that in round cables the conductors twist as they extend along the<br>
5<br><br>
length of the cable. It was assumed in deriving equation (4) that the conductors stay parallel and straight along the cable.<br>
          Equation (4) indicates that the maximum pickup occurs when the angle 8 = 90°<br>
5	and the minimum pickup occurs when 0 = 0°.   It is found that this effect reverses itself when the conductors are twisted beyond a certain limit, causing the maximum pickup to occur at 6 = 0° and the minimum to occur at 0 = 90°.  The variation in pickup of this previous apparatus as the coils move round the twisted conductors depends on the rate of twist, the spacing d, and the distance to the coils <br>
10        r.<br>
If V is computed from V = ^(V* + Vy2) for the coil arrangement shown in Fig. 1,<br>
then variations hi readings as the coils rotate round the cable vary from cable to cable but can exceed ±15%.<br>
15<br>
The coil arrangement shown in Fig. 1 is therefore limited in its accuracy, and it is an object of the invention to provide a new apparatus which is capable of giving greater accuracy.<br>
2 0     This object is met by the invention claimed in claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are claimed in the dependent claims.<br>
        In this specification the axis of a coil means that direction relative to the coil which, when orientated parallel to the direction of a fluctuating magnetic field <br>
25     passing through the coil, would provide the maximum induced voltage in the coil for that magnetic field.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
30<br><br><br>
6<br><br>
Fig. 1, previously described, shows part of a prior art apparatus.<br>
          Fig. 2 is a diagram to assist in understanding the operation and limitations of the      prior art. <br>
5<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the coil arrangement of a basic embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram of the embodiment of Fig. 3 illustrating the effect of an 10      interfering source.<br>
Fig. 5 is a further development of the embodiment of Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an embodiment of the invention with interference suppression. 15<br>
Fig. 7 is a circuit diagram of the embodiment of Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an alternative construction for the orthogonal coils of Fig. 6.<br>
2 0     As described, coils 1 and 2 of the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 pick up the Hx<br>
component of magnetic field. These coils are also present in the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, which is a circuit diagram of the coil arrangement of a basic embodiment of the present invention, but they are referred to there as coils ax and bx. The apparatus of Fig. 3 also includes two further coils px and dx which also<br>
25     pick up the Hx component of magnetic field. These two further coils c* and dx are located at the same distance as coils ax and bx from the centre of the cable 10 but are located above and below the cable so that a line joining coil Cx to coil dx is at an angle of 90° to a line joining coil ax and coil bx. Thus all four coils ax to dx lie in a plane which is perpendicular to the axis of the cable 10 on the circumference<br>
30	of a notional circle of radius r whose centre is coaxial with the cable 10. All four<br><br><br>
7<br><br>
coils ax to dx have substantially parallel axes; thus the axes of coils ax and bx are tangential to the notional circle while the axes of coils Cx and dx extend radially of the notional circle. All four coils ax to dx have substantially the same turns-area product. <br>
5<br>
   Thus, with reference to Fig. 2, if coil ax is at an angle 6 to the two conductors of the cable 10, then coil dx is at 90° + 6, coil bx is at 180° + 8 and coil cx is at 270° + 9. The advantage of this apparatus over the previous one, if the coils are connected in series in the correct polarity in the manner to be described, is that the <br>
10      pickup repeats itself every 90° of rotation and so the pickup at 8=0° and 8=90° are identical. In the previous apparatus maximum variation between reading occurred at q=0° and 90°.<br>
       The variation in pickup of the Hx component of magnetic field that occurs at each <br>
15     of the four coils ax to dx located round a parallel pair of conductors, as shown in Fig. 3, is now examined with the use of equation (1).<br>
If coil ax is at an angle 8 to the conductor pair then Hx at coil ax is given by equation (1) as:<br>
20<br><br><br><br>
25<br><br>
For coil dx its angle is 90 + 8 to the conductors and the Hx component there, again from equation (1), is<br><br><br><br><br><br>
8<br>
8 <br>
For coil bx its angle is 180° + Q to the conductors and therefore<br>
5<br>
For coil (cx) its angle is 270° + 6 to the conductors giving<br>
10<br>
Coils ax to dx are all connected in series, as shown in Fig. 3, in the following polarities. Coils ax and bx have an in-phase connection and coils c^ and dx are connected in anti-phase to coils ax and bx so that the voltage V(x) induced in the <br>
15     series connection of coils ax to dx is proportional to:<br>
Hx(ax) + Hx(bx) - Hx(Cx) – Hx(dx).<br>
Substituting for the values of these magnetic fields from equations (8), (9), (10), <br>
20   and (11) and simplifying gives<br>
Hx(ax) + Hx(bx) - Hx(cx) - Hx(dx) =<br><br><br>
Eq(12)<br><br>
9<br><br>
The arrangement of Fig. 3 also includes four further coils ay, by, cy and dy each having substantially the same turns-area product as each of the coils ax to dx.<br>
5	Each coil ay to dy is placed, as far as is physically practical, at the same location as a corresponding one of the coils ax to dx, but its axis is rotated through 90 so that the axes of the coils ay and by are tangential to the notional circle and the axes of the coils Cy and dy extend radially of the notional circle.   Thus four pairs ax/ay, bx/by, Cx/cy and dx/dy of closely positioned coils are present with the coils in each <br>
10	pair having substantially orthogonal axes. This close positioning of the pairs of coils ax/ay, etc. at the same location can be achieved, for example, using orthogonal pairs of coils as shown in Fig. 9 of US 5,652,506 but an alternative construction using PCB technology will be described later. As will be evident to the reader, each of the coils ay to dy is orientated to pick up the y component Hy of the magnetic field <br>
15     generated by the cable 10 at the respective location.<br>
Let Hy(ay) be the y component of magnetic field picked up by the coil ay. Let Hy(by) be the y component of magnetic field picked up by the coil by. Let Hy(cy) be the y component of magnetic field picked up by the coil cy. <br>
10         Let Hy(dy) be the y component of magnetic field picked up by the coil dy.<br>
From equation (2)<br>
10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
These four coils ay to dy picking up the Hy component of magnetic field are connected in series with the same polarities as the four coils ax to dx picking up the Hx component; i.e. coils ay and by are connected in phase and coils Cy and dy   are <br>
10        connected in antiphase to coils ay and by. To avoid over-complicating Fig. 3 the connections between the coils ay to dy are not shown in that figure.<br>
A voltage V(y) is therefore induced in the series connection proportional to Hy(ay) + Hy(by) - Hy(cy) - Hy(dy).<br>
15<br>
Substituting for the values of these magnetic fields from equation (13) to (16) and simplifying gives<br>
Hy(ay)+Hy(by)-Hy(cy)-Hy(dy) =<br>
11 <br><br><br><br><br><br>
Substituting in equation (18) from equations (12) and (17), and simplifying, gives<br><br><br><br><br>
The minimum value of V occurs when 8 = 45° and this value is given by<br><br><br>
The maximum value of V occurs when 6 = 0° or 6 = 90° and this maximum value is given by<br>
20<br>
12<br><br>
The mean value is approximately<br>
       	Eq (22)<br>
5<br>
          Except for a factor of four, equation (22) of the new apparatus is exactly the same as equation (7) of the previous apparatus. However, the variation from maximum to minimum of the previous apparatus as the sensor is rotated depends on the magnitude of d2/r2, whereas for the new coil arrangement it depends on the <br>
10      magnitude of d4/l6r4. Thus, for d/r = 1/2 the reading varies by + 6.3% for the previous apparatus whereas the new apparatus, with d/r = XA, varies by only ± 0.4%.<br>
           The improvement using the new coil arrangement as given by equation (19) <br>
15	compared to the previous apparatus as given by equation (4) is strictly true only for conductors which do not twist as they extend along the length of the cable. However, the new apparatus is far less prone to errors caused by cable rotation or conductor twisting with variations of 
2 0      15% or larger where the same cable is rotated in the jaws of the instrument.<br>
In the previous coil arrangement, as shown in Fig. 1, coil 3 and coil 4 are connected in anti-phase with coil 1 and coil 2, and their purpose is to reduce the pickup of interference from the other current sources in the vicinity of the meter.<br>
2	5      The interference pickup of the coil arrangement shown in Fig. 3 is now examined<br>
with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the coils ax to dx located on the circle of radius r. Also shown is a cable 10 carrying a current I located at two possible positions, position A or<br>
3	0     position B.  Position A is the location of the cable when a measurement of its<br>
13<br><br>
current I is made. Position B shows the same cable, located a distance n from the centre of the circle, carrying the same current I but exterior to the coil arrangement, where it is acting as an interfering source. The interference suppression S of the coil arrangement is defined as:<br>
5<br>
S = Pickup in position B Pickup in position A<br>
Eq. (23)<br>
10<br>
The smaller the value of S the better the suppression. The pickup in position A is given by equation (22)<br>
2KdI<br>
Pickup in position A =      pr2<br>
It may be shown that the pickup in position B is given by<br>
15<br><br><br><br>
20     It is seen from equation (25) that the smaller the value of — the better the suppression.<br>
          If it is assumed, due to coil and apparatus housings, that the closest an interference <br>
25	source can get to the coil arrangement is n = 2r, then the maximum value of S from equation (25) is S = 0.2 or 20%. As the interfering source moves further away S decreases fairly rapidly, with S = 4% for ri =3r and S = 1% for ri = 4r. This maximum interference value of 20% is in general unacceptable and is reduced significantly by employing the following technique. <br>
30<br>
14<br><br>
         It is noted from equation (24) that the interference pickup is primarily proportional to r2 where r is the distance of the coils from the centre. Consider therefore the situation as shown in Fig. 5.  In this arrangement, two sets of coils are used to pickup the Ex component of magnetic field, an inner set alx to diJ£ <br>
5	located at 90 intervals around the circumference of a circle of radius r, and an outer set a2x to d2x located at 90 intervals around lie circumference of a circle of radius r2 coaxial with the first circle. The four inner coils alx to dlx correspond to the coils ax to dx shown in Fig. 3, and are connected in series in the same way, and the four outer coils a2x to d2x are also connected in series in the manner shown in <br>
10      Fig. 3. Each outer coil a2x to d2x is located on the same radial line as a corresponding one of the inner coils alx to dlx and all eight coils have substantially parallel axes and substantially the same area-turns product.<br>
Let V1x be the pickup by the inner set of coils from the interfering source at 15     distance n which is given by equation (24) with r = rj.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
V2x be the pickup by the outer set of coils from the same interfering source.<br><br><br><br>
25     In order to reduce the pickup from this interfering source a fraction, rl2/r22, of the outer voltage is subtracted from the inner voltage to give Vx, where<br><br>
30<br>
15<br><br>
Substituting for Vix and V2x from equations (26) and (27) gives<br><br><br><br><br>
5<br><br>
Simplifying gives<br><br><br>
10      Since this is the pickup from the interfering source at distance n, call this voltage<br>
VxB.<br><br><br>
15      Consider now the pickup from the same current source when it is located in the measurement position (in the centre of the coil system) when the total voltage pickup is again computed from equation (28).<br><br>
20      The pickup voltage Vjx of the inner coil set is given by equation (22) with r = n, 2Kdl<br><br><br><br>
Similarly, the pickup voltage V2x of the outer set is given by equation (22) with r = r2.<br>
25<br><br><br>
16<br><br>
The total pickup voltage Vxa with the cable in the measurement position is obtained by substituting these values of V1x into equation (28)<br><br><br><br>
5	<br><br><br>
The interference ratio S, given by equation (23) for this new apparatus with inner 10      and outer sets of coils, is<br><br><br><br>
Simplifying gives<br><br><br><br>
15	<br><br>
If the inner set on its own had only been used, the interference ratio for that arrangement was given previously by equation (25) with r = ri giving<br>
20<br><br><br><br>
The interference ratio S of the new apparatus as given by equation (32) is smaller 2 5      than that for the inner set on its own, as given by equation (33), by the factor<br>
17<br><br><br><br>
       For example when r = 2r2 this factor is 0.067, causing a reduction in interference pickup by a factor of 16 approximately. Thus, the worst interference drops from <br>
5    20% for the inner set on its own to 1.25% when the inner and outer voltages are subtracted in the ratio given by equation (28) i.e. T\2/v22. When the interfering sources are further, away the reduction factor is even larger. The subtraction of the factor r\2/T22 of the outer voltage from the inner voltage may be implemented with a resistor divider network or as part of an amplifier input stage as will be<br>
1	o      described with reference to Fig. 7.<br>
The same considerations apply to the coils detecting the Hy component of the magnetic field.<br>
15      Fig. 6 is a plan view of an embodiment of the invention incorporating interference suppression as described above, and Fig. 7 is its circuit diagram.<br>
In Fig. 6, the four inner coils alx to dlx are mounted on a "C-shaped" insulating motherboard 20 at 90 intervals around the circumference of a notional circle of<br>
2	0      radius r^ and the four outer coils a2x to d2x are mounted on the motherboard 20 at<br>
          90 intervals around the circumference of a notional circle of radius x^ the two circles being concentric. All eight coils alx to dix and a2x to d2x have substantially the same area-turns product and substantially parallel axes and are located substantially in a common plane.<br>
 25<br>
Also mounted on the motherboard 20 are eight further coils, an inner set of coils a1y to d1y and an outer set of coils a2y to d2y. The coils aly to dly and a2y to d2y have substantially parallel axes and substantially the same turns-area product as<br>
18<br><br>
          the coils alx to dlx and a2x to d2x. However, their axes are normal to the axes of the coils alx to dlx and a2x to d2x. Thus each coil alx to dl3t and a2x to d2x forms an orthogonal pair of coils with a corresponding one of the coils aly to dly and a2y to d2y, wherein in each  orthogonal pair the two coils, e.g. the pair of coils aix and <br>
5      ai y, are at substantially the same location on the motherboard 20, insofar as that is physically practical using the chosen technology, but the axis of one of the coils is rotated through 90 relative to the other coil so that the axis of one coil is tangential to the notional circle on which it lies while the axis of the other coil extends radially of the same circle.  Thus the motherboard 20 bears eight<br>
10      orthogonal pairs of coils, four inner pairs alx/aly, blx/bly, clx/cly and dlx/dly and four outer pairs a2x/a2y, b2x/b2y, 2x/c2y and d2x/d2y. As mentioned above, this close positioning of the pairs of coils aix/aiy, bix/biy.... etc. at the substantially same physical location can be achieved using orthogonal pairs of coils as shown in Fig. 9 of US 5,652,506.<br>
15<br>
The gap 22 in the C-shaped motherboard 20 allows a cable 10, not shown in Fig. 6, to be introduced into the support so as to be positioned at the point P at the centre of the circles of radius ri and fy, the cable extending normal to the plane containing the coils (i.e. normal to the plane of Fig. 6). In practice the<br>
2 0     motherboard 20 and coils mounted thereon will be accommodated in a housing (not shown) winch could incorporate a clamp or other mechanical device to locate the cable at the point P. Clearly, each of the coils alx to dix and a2x to d2x is orientated to pick up the x component Hx of the magnetic field generated by the cable 10, while each of the coils aly to dly and a2y to d2y is orientated to pick up<br>
25      the y component Hy of the magnetic field generated by the cable 10.<br>
The coils are connected as shown in Fig. 7:<br>
19<br><br>
-	Coils alx and blx are connected in phase with one another and coils clx and dlx,<br>
although connected in phase with one another, are connected in anti-phase to<br>
coils alx and blx to give an overall output voltage V]x at the input to a resistor<br>
Rix-<br>
5<br>
-	Coils a2x and b2x are connected in phase with one another and coils c2x and d2x.<br>
although connected in phase with one another, are connected in anti-phase to<br>
coils a2x and b2x to give an. overall output voltage V2x at the input to a resistor<br>
R2x (the voltage V2X is shown minus because the entire series connection of coils<br>
10        a2x to d2x is connected in reverse polarity to coils alx to dlx).<br>
-	Coils aly and bly are connected in phase with one another and coils cly and dly,<br>
although connected in phase with one another, are connected in anti-phase to<br>
coils aly and bly to give an overall output voltage V] y at the input to a resistor<br>
15	Rly.<br>
-	Coils a2y and b2y are connected in phase with one another and coils c2y and d2y,<br>
although connected in phase with one another, are connected in anti-phase to<br>
coils a2y and b2y to give an overall output voltage V2y at the input to a resistor<br>
2 0        R2y (again, the voltage V2y is shown minus because titie entire series connection of coils a2y to d2y is connected in reverse polarity to coils aly to dly).<br>
The resistors R1x and R2X are connected in common to the negative input to an amplifier AMP1 and are chosen such that:<br><br><br><br>
25	<br>
VoutX is therefore given, as<br>
20<br><br><br><br>
For the frequency range of interest. jcoRc is much greater than 1, therefore<br><br>
5<br><br><br><br><br>
10	<br><br><br>
Similarly, the resistors R1y and R2y are connected in common to the negative input to an amplifier AMP2 and are chosen such that:<br><br><br>
                 Vouty is therefore given as<br><br><br><br><br>
20<br>
For the frequency range of interest, j ©Re is much greater than 1, therefore<br><br>
25	    <br><br><br><br><br>
Finally, the current flowing in the cable is calculated in a processor 30 by 3 0      evaluating<br>
21<br><br>
and the measured current displayed on a display device such as an LCD panel (not<br>
5	shown). The connections between the various coils can be effected by using conductive tracks (not shown) laid down on the motherboard 20 using printed circuit board (PCB) technology. The amplifiers AMP1 and AMP2, as well as the processor 30, can be formed by integrated circuit technology and the IC chips located on the motherboard 20 or elsewhere in the device housing.<br>
10<br>
A total of 16 coils are used in this embodiment and ideally the turns-area product of these coils should be the same to within 1% at least to obtain accurate results. The cost of 16 wirewound coils accurate to this tolerance could be too expensive for many applications. Planar magnetic printed circuit board coils are a lot <br>
15	cheaper and more accurate to manufacture.  However, for a true implementation of the apparatus shown in Figs. 6 and 7, in each pair of orthogonal coils the geometric centre of each of the coils aix, b1x, etc. picking up the Hx component should be located at the same position as the geometric centre of the corresponding coil aiy, bly, etc. picking up the Hy component  This is possible<br>
20	using the technique shown in Fig. 9 of US 5,652,506 but not with planar magnetic coils as the tracks are confined to one plane and it is not possible with present day techniques to simultaneously have tracks on orthogonal planes in the same PCB. However, a slight compromise with planar magnetic printed circuit board coils works very well and this arrangement is shown in Figs. 8(a) to 8(c). Fig. 8<br>
 25   actually shows the PCB implementation of the two orthogonal coil pairs a1s/aly and a2x/a2y. but the same principle is applicable to the two orthogonal coil pairs on the same radius at each of the other three quadrants of the motherboard 20.<br>
The coils aly and a2y are substantially identical and each is formed as a conductive<br>
30        track 40 on an insulating substrate 42. Although only one side, of the substrate is<br>
seen in Fig. 8(c), tracks 40 are formed on each opposite surface of the substrate<br>
22<br><br>
and connected in series through a central via hole 44. Both tracks 40 form the coil whose opposite ends are connected to respective solder pads 46 formed on tabs extending down from the main body of the substrate 42.<br>
5	By contrast, each coil alx and a2x is formed in two parts. Considering coil alx, it is formed in two parts alx(l) and aix(2). The parts aix(l) and alx(2) are formed as conductive tracks 50 on respective insulating substrates 52. However, each of the parts alx(l) and alx(2) has a turns-area product half that of the coil aiy. This can be achieved by providing double the number of turns on the coil aly than the<br>
 10      number on parts alx(l) and aix(2).<br>
      Similarly, the coil a2x is formed in two parts a2x(I) and a2x(2), again formed as conductive tracks 50 on respective insulating substrates 52 and each haying a turns-area product half that of the coil a2y. Actually, in this embodiment the parts <br>
15      alx(l) and a2x(l) are formed on one common substrate 52 and likewise the parts alx(2)    and a2x(2) are formed on another common substrate 52, but this is not necessary.<br>
      The substrates 42, 52 are mounted upstanding vertically in the motherboard 20 by <br>
20	inserting the solder tabs 46, 56 into slots in the motherboard and soldered to tracks on the motherboard. The arrangement is as shown in Fig. 8(a). The coil aly is embraced on each side by the coils aix(l) and aix(2) normal thereto, and the coil a2y is embraced on each side by the coils a2x(l) and a2x(2) normal thereto. The solder tabs 56 are connected by conductive tracks on the motherboard 20 to<br>
   25      connect the coils alx(l) and aix(2) in series in phase to form the coil aix and the coils a2x(l) and a2x(2) in scries in phase to form the coil a2x. Since the coil parts aix(l) and aix(2) combined have the same turns-area product as the coil aly and are equally spaced at either end of coil aly, as a pair they have the same<br>
23<br><br>
geometrical centre as coil aly. Similarly, as a pair the coil parts a2x(l) and a2x(2) they have the same geometrical centre as coil a2y. The remaining connections are as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
5	Modifications of the above embodiment are possible. For example, the turns-area product of the coils a2x to d2x could be different to that of the coils alx to dlx, provided allowance is made for this in the relative values of the resistors Rix and R.2X or elsewhere in the circuit. Similarly, the turns-area product of the coils a2y to d2y could be different to that of the coils aly to dly provided suitable allowance is <br>
10	made elsewhere. Also, if interference from external sources is not probable in the circumstances likely to be encountered in use, the outer sets of coils, i.e. the orthogonal pairs of coils located on the circle of radius r? in Fig. 6, can be omitted. Further, since diametrically opposite sets of coils are provided primarily to provide a larger signal and to further reduce external interference, as well as <br>
15    reducing errors due to movement of the cable from centre point P, the invention could be implemented with just two sets of coils at 90° spacing, e.g. the sets of coils at the 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions of Fig. 6.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described herein which may. be <br>
20      modified or varied without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
