CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/879,956 filed on January 11, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A transmission is provided having an input member, an output<br>
member, four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and a plurality<br>
of torque transmitting devices. Each of the planetary gear sets includes first,<br>
second and third members. The torque transmitting devices are for example<br>
clutches and brakes.<br>
[0007] An embodiment of the transmission includes an input member,<br>
an output member, first, second, third and fourth planetary gear sets each having<br>

torque transmitting mechanisms is selectively engageable to interconnect the<br>
third member of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary element.<br>
[0013] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the first members<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
6<br><br>
[0024] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the eight speed<br>
automatic transmission of the present invention has an arrangement of<br>
permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the four planetary<br>
gear sets in common. These mechanical connections generically link or relate<br>
the transmission embodiments. A first component or element of a first planetary<br>
gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a second<br>
planetary gear set. A second component or element of the first planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a third planetary<br>
gear set. A second component or element of the second planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a first component or element of a fourth planetary gear<br>
set. Finally, a second component or element of the third planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each<br>
represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate<br>
7<br><br>
ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between<br>
the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal<br>
lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented<br>
as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
. [0026] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0027] The input 12 is coupled to the second node 14B of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14. The output 22 is coupled to the second node 18B of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
coupled to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The third node<br>
14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the third node 16C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16. The first node 16A of the second planetary gear<br>
set 16 is coupled to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. The<br>
8<br><br>
first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the second node<br>
20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0028] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the second node 14B of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14 to the first node 16A of the second planetary gear<br>
set 16. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the first node 16A of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 to the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 and<br>
to the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16. A third clutch 30<br>
selectively connects the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 to<br>
the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 and to the second node 20B<br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first brake 32 selectively connects the first<br>
node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to a ground, stationary element, or a<br>
transmission housing 40. A second brake 34 selectively connects the third node<br>
20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to a ground, stationary element, or the<br>
transmission housing 40.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0030] For example, the first planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear<br>
member 14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B that rotatably supports a set of<br>
9<br><br>
planet gears 14D, and a ring gear member 14C. The planet gears 14D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 14A and the ring gear<br>
member 14C. The sun gear member 14A is connected for common rotation with<br>
a first shaft or interconnecting member 42. The planet gear carrier member 14B<br>
is connected for common rotation with the input member 12. The ring gear<br>
member 14C is connected for common rotation with a second shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 44.<br>
[0031] The second planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member<br>
16A, a planet carrier member 16C that rotatably supports a set of intermeshing<br>
planet gears 16D and 16E, and a ring gear member 16B. The planet gears 16D<br>
and 16E are configured to intermesh with one another and with the sun gear<br>
member 16A and the ring gear member 16B. The sun gear member 16A is<br>
connected for common rotation with a third shaft or interconnecting member 46<br>
and with a fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48. The planet carrier<br>
member 16C is connected for common rotation with the second interconnecting<br>
member 44. The ring gear member 16B is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fifth shaft or interconnecting member 50.<br>
[0032] The third planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member<br>
18C, a planet carrier member 18B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears<br>
18D, and a ring gear member 18A. The planet gears 18D are each configured to<br>
intermesh with both the sun gear member 18C and the ring gear member 18A.<br>
The sun gear member 18C is connected for common rotation with the fourth<br>
interconnecting member 48. The planet carrier member 18B is connected for<br>
10<br><br>
common rotation with the output member 22. The ring gear member 18A is<br>
connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or interconnecting member 52.<br>
[0033] The fourth planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member<br>
20C, a planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears<br>
20D, and a ring gear member 20A. The planet gears 20D are each configured to<br>
intermesh with both the sun gear member 20C and the ring gear member 20A.<br>
The sun gear member 20C is connected for common rotation with a seventh<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 54 and with the first interconnecting member 42.<br>
The planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with the sixth<br>
interconnecting member 52. The ring gear member 20A is connected for<br>
common rotation with an eighth shaft or interconnecting member 56.<br>
[0034] The input shaft or member 12 is preferably continuously<br>
connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not<br>
shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected<br>
with a final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0035] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30 and<br>
the brakes 32, 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the<br>
transmission housing 40. For example, the first clutch 26 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the input member 12 to the third interconnecting member<br>
46. The second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the second<br>
interconnecting member 44 to the third interconnecting member 46. The third<br>
clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect the fifth interconnecting member<br>
11<br><br>
50 to the sixth interconnecting member 52. The first brake 32 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the eighth interconnecting member 56 to ground or the<br>
transmission housing 40 in order to restrict rotation of the ring gear 20A relative<br>
to the ground or the transmission housing 40. The second brake 34 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the seventh interconnecting member 54 to the ground or<br>
the transmission housing 40 to restrict rotation of the sun gear 20C and the sun<br>
gear 14A relative to the ground or the transmission housing 40.<br>
[0036] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that the transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight<br>
forward speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second<br>
clutch 28, third clutch 30, first brake 32, and second brake 34), as will be<br>
explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms or elements that are activated or engaged to<br>
achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios and gear steps of<br>
the various gear states are also presented although it should be appreciated that<br>
these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over<br>
significant ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria<br>
of the transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using<br>
the embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course,<br>
12<br><br>
other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth<br>
count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0037] To establish reverse gear, the first brake 32, the second brake<br>
34, and the third clutch 30 are engaged or activated. The first brake 32 connects<br>
the eighth interconnecting member 56 to ground or the transmission housing 40<br>
in order to restrict rotation of the ring gear 20A relative to the ground or the<br>
transmission housing 40. The second brake 34 connects the seventh<br>
interconnecting member 54 to the ground or the transmission housing 40 to<br>
restrict rotation of the sun gear 20C and the sun gear 14A relative to the ground<br>
or the transmission housing 40. The third clutch 30 connects the fifth<br>
interconnecting member 50 to the sixth interconnecting member 52. Likewise,<br>
the eight forward ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and<br>
brake engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0038] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and the brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0039] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
