				<td>N-AMINOACETYL-PYRROLIDINE-2-CARBONITRILES COMPOUNDS<br>
PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION, COMPOSITIONS COMERISGENG THEM AND INTERMEDIATES The present invention relates to the novel compound of the general Formula (I) possessing<br>
dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV enzyme inhibitory activity, as well as their salts, solvates and isomers, to the therapeutic application of the compounds of the general formula (I), to the pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the general formula (I), to the process for their preparation and to the new intermediates of the general formulae (II), (IE), (V), (VII), (VIII) and (IX).<br>
The enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), which is identical with the lymphocyte surface glycoprotein CD26, a polypeptide with the molar mass of 110 k Dalton, is formed in the tissues and organs of mammals. This enzyme can be found, among others, in the liver, in the Langerhans islets, in the renal cortex, in the lungs, and in certain tissues of the prostate and small intestine. Significant DPP-IV activity can be observed furthermore in the body fluids (as for instance in the plasma, serum and urine).<br>
DPP-IV is a serine protease type enzyme, which has the unique specificity to cleave dipeptides from the N-terminals of peptides where the penultimate amino acid is primarily proline, alanine or hydroxy proline.<br>
DPP-IV enzyme is responsible for the decomposition of the glucagon-like peptides, peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide-2 (GLP-2) in the body. The enzyme GLP-1 strongly stimulates the insulin production of the pancreas, thus it has a direct, favourable effect on the glucose homeostasis, therefore DPP-IV inhibitors are suitable for the treatment and prevention of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and other diseases related with the DPP-IV enzyme activity including but not limited to diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, dermatological or mucous membrane disorders, poriasis, intestinal distress, constipation, autoimmune disorders such as enchephalomyelitis, complement mediated disorders such as glomerulonepritis, lipodystrophy, and tissue damage, psychosomatic, depressive, and neurophsychiatric disease such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, spasm, and chronic pain, HIV infection, allergies, inflammation, arthritis, transplant rejection, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, tumors, and stress-induced abortions.<br>

Term "nitrogen containing aromatic moiety consisting of one or two aromatic rings" includes all such ring systems known at the priority date of our present patent application.<br>
Term "halogen atom" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. "C1-4 alkyl group" and "C1-4 alkoxy group" mean linear or branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbon groups containing 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The compounds of the general-formula (I) according to our invention-can-be prepared by— the alkylation of the primary amines of the general formula (II) - wherein the meanings of R1 and B are the same as given above - with the chloroacetyl derivative of the general formula (III) - wherein the meanings of R2 and R3 are as given above- and, if desired, by transforming the resulting compounds into one of their salts or solvates (Scheme 1).<br>
In the course of the alkylation the chloroacetyl derivatives of the general formula (III) are applied in excess, and the resulting hydrogen chloride is bound by various acid binding agents, preferably by a base, such as for instance triethylamine, potassium carbonate, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 2-tert-butylimino-2-diethylamino-l,3-dimethyl-perhydro-l,3,2-diazaphosphorine - bound to a resin (PBEMP) -, which is known as super base. The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature between 25 and 70 °C.<br>
The primary amines of the general formula (II) are prepared in a two-step synthesis<br>
(Scheme 2). In the first step the starting cyclic secondary amine of the general formula (IV) -wherein the meaning of Y is hydrogen atom, acetyl, or tert-butoxycarbonyl group- axe arylated, preferably with the aryl halogenides of the general formula (X), wherein the meaning of R1 is the same as given above and X stands for halogen atom. Depending on the meaning of R1 the arylation reaction can be carried out in polar, protic or aprotic solvents, between 25 and 150 °C, preferably in alcohols (ethanol, n-butanol, M-pentanol), or without solvent in microwave oven, using an acid binder, for instance the excess of the amine, or DBU.<br>
For starting material the free amines or protected secondary amines of the general formula (IV) -known from the literature- are used, thus 4-acetaminopiperidine (B = formula (1), Y = COCH3)(US-3225037);<br>
4-tert-butoxycarbonylaminopiperidine (B = formula (1), Y = COOC(CH3)3) (J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 2706); 3-(S)-tert-butoxycarbonylaminopiperidine (B = formula (2)) and 3-(S)-/erf-butoxycarbonylaminopyrrolidine (B = formula (3)) (Synth. Comm. 1998, 28, 3919) in the last two cases Y = COOC(CH3)3; tert-butyl 8-azabicycIo[3.2. l]-oct-3-yl-exo-carbamate (B=formula (4), tert-butyl 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-oct-3-yl-emdo-carbamate (B=formula (5)) (J. Med. Chem 1991, 34, 656), tert-butyl 9-azabicycIo[3.3.1]-non-3-yl exo-carbamate (B=formula (6)) and tert-butyl 9-azabicyclo-[3.3.1]-non-3-yl-endo-carbamate (B=formula (7)), (J. Med. Chem 1993, 36, 3720)) (Y=COOC(CH3)3).<br>
In the second step the protecting group Y is removed from the arylated amine of the general formula (V) - wherein the meanings of R1 and B are the same as defined above- by acidic hydrolysis. The reaction is carried out in aqueous hydrochloric acid or in ethanolic hydrogen chloride solution at a temperature between 25 and 78 °C to yield the aliphatic or cyclic primary amines of the general formula (II) - wherein the meanings of R1 and B are the same as defined above.<br>
If R1 stands for an acyl group of formula R1a-CO, the compounds of the general formula (IV) -wherein the meaning of Y is tert-butoxycarbonyl group— are reacted with the acid derivatives of the general formula Rla-COZ -wherein the meaning of Z is a leaving group, preferably a chloro atom- advantageously at a temperature around 0°C, by using an inorganic or organic base, preferably triethylamine as acid binding agent. From the compounds of the general formula (V) the protecting group Y is cleaved under acidic conditions, preferably by use of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane solution, at 0 -30°C, to obtain the the amines of the general formula (II), wherein the meaning of R1 is the group of formula R1a-CO.<br>
The l-(2-chloroacetyl)-2-pyrrolidinecarbonitriles of the general formula (III) - wherein the meanings of R2 and R3 are the same as defined above- are prepared in a four-step synthesis (Scheme 3).<br>
The starting compounds are the fluoroproline derivatives, preferably L-fluoroproline derivatives- wherein the meanings of R2 and R3 are the same as defined above- with a nitrogen protected with tert-butoxycarbonyl group. These compounds can be prepared by methods written in the literature (Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 1169). In the first step a mixed anhydride is prepared with pivaloyl chloride or chloroformic acid ethyl ester, then the carbamoyl derivatives of the general formula (VII) - wherein the meanings of R2 and R3 are the same as defined above- are formed.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a halogenated solvent (CHCl3, CH2Cl2), at 0 - 25 °C.<br>
In the second step the tert-butoxycarbonyl group is cleaved in ethanolic hydrogen chloride solution. The hydrolysis takes place at 0 - 25°C and the hydrochlorides of the carboxamides of the general formula (VIII) - wherein the meanings of R2 and R3 are the same as defined above- are obtained.<br>
The fluoropyrrolidinecarboxamides of the general formula (VIII) thus obtained are in the third step acylated with chloroacetyl chloride, preferably at 0°C, in a halogenated solvent (CHCl3, CH2Cl2). Thus the chloroacetylcarbamoyl derivatives of the general formula (IX) - wherein the meanings of R~ and R are the same as defined above- are formed. In the fourth step the chloroacetylcarbamoyl derivatives of the general formula (DC) are dehydrated to yield the chloroacetylcyano derivatives of the general formula (III) -wherein the meanings of R2 and R3 are the same as defined above. Dehydration is preferably carried out with phosphorous oxychloride in dichloromethane at the boiling point of the reaction mixture, j<br>
Biological investigations<br>
DPP-IV enzyme inhibitory activities of the compounds with the general formula (I) were<br>
determined by the following method:<br>
Applied conditions of the assay:<br>
DPP-IV. source: solubilized crude extractum from CaCo/Tc-7 cells<br>
content: 0.8-1mg/assay<br>
Substrate: H-Gly-Pro-AMC (Bachem)<br>
Reaction: 1 hour preincubation with samples at 37 °C ,<br>
30 min reaction time at 37 C° Stop solution: 1M Na-acetate buffer (pH=4.2) Reaction mixture: 10 ul enzyme solution<br>
10ml test compound or assay buffer<br>
55ml assay buffer<br>
25 ml substrate<br>
300ml stop solution Measurement: spectrofluorometric determination by Tecan plate reader<br>
(Ex: 360nm Em: 465nm)<br>
The reaction of the DPP-IV enzyme and the H-Gly-Pro-AMC substrate is recorded by the liberation of AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) at 37 °C in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5 (assay buffer). Standard curve of AMC is linear up to 31.25 mM concentration, that is why we used the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) of the AMC formed. It is detected by using 360 nm excitation and 465 emission filters (30 jjls integration time, Gain 25, No. of Flashes 50) by Tecan Spectrofluor Plus plate reader. Under these conditions enzyme reaction is linear for at least 30 min, and the enzyme dependence is linear up to 2.5 mg protein (up to 700 RFU). Using 1-0.8 mg of extracted protein Km for H-Gly-Pro-AMC is 50 mM.
