The present invention relates to bitumen compositions, a process for their preparation and the use of them in asphalt mixtures for road applications.<br>
Bitumen is used as a binder in road asphalt mixtures, and has developed continually to meet ever-increasing performance demands from road building constructors. In general bitumen performs well in road asphalt, but increasingly heavy traffic loads have led to the premature wear of many roads through rutting and cracking of the surface. Cracking is a serious defect in a road asphalt because it allows water to reach lower layers of the road surface where it causes rapid deterioration, and accelerates the need for premature repairs. Increasing the bitumen content of asphalt or using a softer grade of bitumen improves the crack resistance of asphalt at low temperatures but increases the risk of excessive rutting at higher temperatures because the mixture is effectively softer. Conversely, resistance to rutting can be improved by reducing the amount of bitumen in the asphalt mixture or by using a harder grade of bitumen, at the expense of crack resistance because the mixture becomes less flexible.<br>
Much effort is therefore nowadays directed to the development of a hard bitumen composition meeting today's crack resistance requirement, i.e. a bitumen composition having both a good low temperature performance and a good high temperature rutting resistance.<br>
Another requirement which bitumen compositions frequently have to meet nowadays is the resistance to solvency of petroleum products such as fuels (e.g.<br><br>
gasoline and kerosene) and oils such as lubricating oils. This resistance to solvency is of importance in areas where asphalt mixtures are regularly exposed to spillage of fuels and oils. Such areas include for instance airfields, waste disposal areas, petrol stations and tank storage areas. When an asphalt mixture is exposed to fuel or oil spillage, the bitumen will be leached out of the asphalt mixture eventually resulting in the loss of coarse aggregate from the road surface, so-called fretting of the road surface.<br>
In view of the above it will be clear that it would be advantageous to develop a hard bitumen composition meeting today's crack resistance requirement and which would in addition display an improved resistance to solvency of petroleum products.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that such bitumen composition can be prepared by adding to a bitumen component a thermoplastic rubber and in addition a particular ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a bitumen composition comprising a bitumen component, a thermoplastic r\abber in an amount of less than 8 %wt and an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer in an amount of less than 5 %wt, both based on total bitumen composition, wherein the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer has a vinyl acetate content in the range of from 20 to 35 %wt, based on copolymer.<br>
Although the use of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer in a thermoplastic rubber-containing bitumen composition is as such known in general terms, see for instance EP-Bl-0337282 and EP-Bl-0340210, it should be noted that the advanced use of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer having the particular vinyl acetate content as now claimed has not been disclosed before.<br>
Preferably, the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer used in accordance with the present invention has a<br><br>
vinyl acetate content in the range of from 25 to 35 %wt, more preferably in the range of from 30 to 35 %wt, based on copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer to be used in accordance with the invention is present in an amount of less than 3 %wt, based on total bitumen composition. More preferably, the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is present in an amount in the range of 0.5 to 3 %wt, based on total bitumen composition.<br>
Preferably, the thermoplastic rubber is present in an amount of less than 6 %wt, based on total bitumen composition.<br>
The bitumen composition comprises a thermoplastic rubber. Suitably, the bitumen composition may comprise one or more different types of thermoplastic rubbers.<br>
Although a wide range of thermoplastic rubbers can suitably be used in accordance with the present invention, the preferred thermoplastic rubbers comprise optionally hydrogenated block copolymers which comprise at least two terminal poly(monovinylaromatic hydrocarbon) blocks and at least one central poly(conjugated diene) block, forming a continuous network.<br>
Preferably block copolymer constituents are selected from the group consisting of those of the formulae A(BA)ni or (AB)nX, wherein A represents a block copolymer of predominantly poly(monovinylaromatic hydrocarbon), wherein B represents a block of predominantly poly(conjugated diene), wherein X represents the residue of a multivalent coupling agent and wherein n represents an integer &gt; 1, preferably &gt; 2, and m represents an integer &gt; 1, preferably m is 1.<br>
More preferably, the blocks A represent predominantly poly(styrene) blocks and the B blocks represent predominantly poly(butadiene) blocks or predominantly poly(isoprene) blocks. Multivalent<br><br>
coupling agents to be used include those coiranonly known in the art.<br>
With the term "predominantly" is meant that the respective blocks A and B are mainly derived from monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon monomers and conjugated diene monomers, which monomers may be mixed with other structurally related or non-related co-monomers, e.g. monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon monomers as main component and small amounts (up to 10%) of other monomers or butadiene mixed with isoprene or small amounts of styrene.<br>
More preferably, the block copolymers contain pure poly(styrene), pure poly(isoprene) or pure poly(butadiene) blocks, of which the poly(isoprene) or poly(butadiene) blocks may be selectively hydrogenated to at most a residual ethylenic unsaturation of 20%, more preferably less than 5% of its original unsaturation content prior to hydrogenation. Preferably, hov/ever, the block copolymers are not selectively hydrogenated. Most preferably, the applied block copolymer has the structure ABA, wherein A has an apparent molecular weight of from 3000 to 100,000, preferably from 5000 to 25,000 and the diblocks AB have an apparent molecular weight in the range of from 50,000 to 170,000.  Preferably, the diblocks AB have an apparent molecular weight in the range of from 70,000 to 120,000.<br>
With the term "apparent molecular weight" as used throughout the specification is meant the molecular weight of a polymer, as measured with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using poly(styrene) calibration standards (according to ASTM 3536).<br>
The originally prepared poly(conjugated diene) blocks usually contain from 5 to 65 % by weight vinyl groups, originating from 1,2 polymerisation relative to the conjugated diene molecules, and preferably a vinyl<br><br>
content from 10 to 55% by weight.<br>
The complete block copolymer to be used according to the present invention, is normally containing polymerised vinyl aromatic monomers in an amount of from 10 to 60% by weight and preferably from 15 to 45% by weight.<br>
The apparent molecular weight of the total block copolymer will normally be in the range of from 100,000 to 500,000 and preferably in the range of from 150,000 to 200,000.<br>
As examples of suitable pure block copolymers can be mentioned KRATON G-1651, KRATON G-1654, KRATON G-1657, KRATON G-1650, KRATON G-1701, KRATON D-1101, KRATON D-1102, KRATON D-1107, KRATON D-1111, KRATON D-1116, KRATON D-1117, KRATON D-1118, KRATON D-1122, KRATON D-1135X, KRATON D-1184, KRATON D-1144X, KRATON D-1300X, KRATON D-4141 and KRATON D-4158 (KRATON is a trademark).<br>
The bitumen to be used may be a residue from distillation of crude oil, a cracked residue, an extract of a crude oil, a bitumen derived from propane bitumen, butane bitumen, pentane bitumen or mixtures thereof. Other suitable bitumens include mixtures of the above bitumens with extenders (fluxes) such as petroleum extracts, e.g. aromatic extracts, distillates or residues. Suitably, use is made of a bitumen component which has not been subjected to an oxidation treatment. Suitably, the bitumen has a penetration in the range of from 50 to 400 dmm, preferably 60 to 200 dmm (as measured by ASTM D 5 at 25°C), and a softening point in the range of from 30 to 60 °C, preferably in the range of from 35 to 50 °C (as measured by ASTM D 36) .<br>
Fillers such as carbon black, silica and calcium carbonate, stabilisers, antioxidants, pigments, and solvents are known to be useful in bitumen' compositions<br><br>
and can be incorporated in the bitumen compositions of this invention in concentrations taught in the art.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for preparing a bituminous composition as defined in any one of claims 1 to 10 comprising mixing a bitumen at a temperature range of 160 to 220°C and a time period of less than 6 hours with less than 8 wt.% of a thermoplastic rubber and less than 5 wt.% of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, both based on total bitumen composition, wherein the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer has a vinyl acetate content in the range of from 20 to 35 wt.%, based on copolymer.<br>
Suitably, the present process is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 160 to 220 °C.<br>
Preferably, the process according to the present invention is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 170 to 190 °C.<br>
The process may be carried out at ambient pressure or elevated pressure. Normally, however, it will be carried out at ambient pressure.<br>
Suitably, the present process is carried out over a period of time of less than 6 hours, preferably less than 2 hours.<br>
The present invention still further provides the use of a bitumen composition as described hereinbefore in an asphalt mixture for road applications.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated by means of the following Examples.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
A bitumen composition in accordance with the present invention was prepared as follows.<br>
A bitumen having a penetration of 88 dmm (as measured by ASTM D 5 at 25°C) and a softening point of 47.5 °C (as measured by ASTM D 36) was mixed at a temperature of 180 °C and for 1 hour with 4% by weight of a linear non-hydrogenated polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene block copolymer and 2% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, both based on total bitumen composition. The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer had a vinyl acetate content of 33 % by weight, based on<br><br>
copolymer. The block copolymer had a 31%w styrene content, an apparent molecular weight of 170,000 and contained polystyrene-polybutadiene diblocks having an apparent molecular weight of 90,000. An asphalt mixture was then prepared by mixing the bitumen composition so obtained with aggregate. Subsequently, an asphalt specimen was prepared in accordance with the Marshall method RAW 57. The asphalt specimen was then stored under Jetfuel Al for 24 hours. Then the solution was decanted and the mass of the asphalt specimen was determined after drying for 24 hours at ambient temperature. A kerosene resistance, which is expressed as a percentage of the mass of the original asphalt specimen, was observed of 0.8%. Example 2<br>
A bitumen composition in accordance with the present invention was prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 1, except that 5% by weight of the block copolymer, based on total bitumen composition, was used. Subsequently an asphalt specimen was prepared from the bitumen composition so obtained in a similar manner as described in Example 1. The asphalt specimen displayed a kerosene resistance of 0.6%. Example 3<br>
For reasons of comparison a bitumen composition was prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 1 except that no block copolymer and 5.5% by weight of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used, based on total bitumen composition, having a vinyl acetate content of 18% by weight, based on copolymer. Subsequently an asphalt specimen was prepared from the bitumen composition so obtained in a similar manner as described in Example 1. The asphalt specimen displayed a kerosene resistance of 2.3%. Example 4<br>
For reason of comparison a bituminous composition<br><br>
was prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 1, except that an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used having a vinyl acetate content of 18% by weight, based on copolymer. Subsequently an asphalt specimen was prepared from the bitumen composition so obtained in a similar manner as described in Example 1. The asphalt specimen displayed a kerosene resistance of 3.1%. Example 5<br>
For reason of comparison a bituminous composition was prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 2, except that an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used having a vinyl acetate content of 40% by weight, based on copolymer. Subsequently an asphalt specimen was prepared from the bitumen composition so obtained in a similar manner as described in Exam.ple 1. The asphalt specimen displayed a kerosene resistance of 3.0%.<br>
It will be clear from the above that the present invention provides hard bitumen compositions having an improved kerosene resistance (Examples 1 and 2) when compared with bitumen compositions falling just outside the scope of the present invention (Examples 3-5).<br><br><br>
