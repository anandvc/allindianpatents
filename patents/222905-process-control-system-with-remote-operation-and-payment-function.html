				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a process control system.<br>
Usually process control systems are developed by a manufacturer,<br>
delivered to customers, installed in a technical system to be<br>
controlled and put into operation. The process control system<br>
consists in this case of hardware and software components which each<br>
implement at least one technical control function of the process<br>
control system. The sum of these functions provided the customers<br>
with a multiplicity of operating, observation and regulation options<br>
for the technical system.<br>
Mostly the customer pays a price for the supply and if necessary the<br>
installation of the process control system, for example an agreed<br>
purchase price as a one-off payment, which includes the use of the<br>
process control system over its lifetime with all its functions, in<br>
which case the price given does not take into account to extent to<br>
which customers actually use the functions provided and/or how often<br>
and/or for what period specific functions are used. Furthermore<br>
customers normally receive a project planning system as part of the<br>
process control system/ with which they can implement new technical<br>
control functions or can modify supplied control functions, so that<br>
the process control can be adapted during its years of operation at<br>
any time to the changing requirements of the technical system. This<br>
aspect too is not taken into account in the pricing of the process<br>
control system. Customers pay a - mostly very high - purchase price<br>
and can use the supplied components of the process control system<br>
practically as they wish, without greater or lesser use of the<br>
functions of the process control system being reflected in a<br>
subsequent payment or repayment of at least a part of the purchase<br>
price.<br>
With a known process control system the customer thus mostly pays at<br>
the time of delivery the purchase price for the process control<br>
system, which includes a proportion of the price in each case for<br>
the hardware and the software supplied. So for the customer a<br>
greater financial investment is needed, at the latest by the time of<br>
delivery, to obtain an operable process control system with all<br>
hardware and software components.<br>
From this situation the object present's itself of specifying a<br>
process control system which can be adapted flexibly to the<br>
customer's requirements and which is especially designed to reduce<br>
the given initial high investment costs, especially the investment<br>
costs for the software components of the process control system and<br>
the license payments to be made for them. A further object of the<br>
invention is to specify a process control system that features an<br>
architecture that is especially suited to overcoming the stated<br>
disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
In accordance with the invention the object is achieved by a process<br>
control system which features a processing unit which is capable of<br>
determining a payment figure from operations running in the process<br>
control system.<br>
The invention in this case stems from the idea of determining a<br>
payment figure, for example license fees to be paid by a customer,<br>
that depend on the actual use of the process control system. This is<br>
a way of guaranteeing that the customer - apart from any fixed basic<br>
price that may have been agreed, for example for the supplied<br>
hardware components of the process control system - must in practice<br>
only pay (extra) for those functions of process control system that<br>
he is really using. When a customer accesses functions of the<br>
process control system, the corresponding operations, triggered by<br>
the access, run in the process control system, depending on the type<br>
of function that was accessed.<br>
Thus for example the type of operation, typically calling up a<br>
graphical process diagram with current process measurement data<br>
incorporated or executing a closed-loop control function for a unit<br>
of the technical system can have an influence on determining the<br>
payment figure. Likewise the frequency with which for example the<br>
named functions are used can have an influence on the determination<br>
of the payment figure. It is conceivable for example that each<br>
access to a specific function delivers a fixed proportion of the<br>
payment figure.<br>
Advantageously the operations include creation and/or removal of a<br>
technical function, an operating activity and execution of an<br>
automation function.<br>
The creation and/or removal of a process control function can for<br>
example be undertaken by customers when they are project planning<br>
the process control system and for example are creating a new<br>
process control function which is to run on the process control<br>
system by means of a project planning program. Further customers can<br>
also create a new process control function by selecting one or more<br>
functions from a set of prespecified process control functions and<br>
connecting it to the new process control function by means of the<br>
project planning program. The set of prespecified process control<br>
functions can for example be held on a computer of the process<br>
control system manufacturer, connected to the Internet by means of a<br>
Web server, so that the customer can download such prefabricated<br>
process control functions over the Internet and use them for a<br>
process control system. These types of operations in the customer's<br>
process control system can also influence how the payment figure is<br>
determined.<br>
An operator action can for example include calling a specific<br>
process image in the process control system or operating a unit in<br>
the technical system by means of the process control system or<br>
requesting error logs, status reports, message lists etc. by means<br>
of the process control system. Operator actions can further include<br>
customer access to the process control system via the Internet,<br>
provided the process control system is capable of being operated<br>
over the Internet. In addition operator actions can also include<br>
executions of control algorithms, that are executed in a<br>
Programmable Logic Control (PLC) of the process control system for<br>
example, to keep the speed of a motor of the technical system<br>
constant during operation for example, even if the operating<br>
conditions, such as the load to be managed by the motor, change.<br>
Advantageously the process control system includes a process control<br>
computer, a client computer and the Internet, and at least a part of<br>
the operations running in the process control system run on the<br>
process control computer.<br>
The process control system can further include one or more field<br>
devices which are advantageously installed in the technical system<br>
and are used for automation of the system components.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention the process control system is<br>
capable of being operated via the Internet, in which case the<br>
process control computer features at least a part of the functions<br>
of the process control system which run as corresponding operations<br>
on the process control computer.<br>
If the process control system includes one or more field devices,<br>
these can also feature a part of the functions of the process<br>
control system which run as the appropriate operations on the field<br>
device or devices.<br>
The client computer can for example be installed at almost any<br>
location with Internet access, for example in a maintenance center,<br>
which under some circumstances is very far from the technical system<br>
to be controlled. The client computer is connected to the Internet<br>
and can operate the process control computer via the Internet and<br>
thereby operate functions of the process control system, especially<br>
those that relate to the operation of the technical system. With the<br>
process control system in accordance with the invention those<br>
operating activities of the process control system for determining<br>
the payment figure can now also be incorporated which is undertaken<br>
by a user over the Internet. It is conceivable for example for the<br>
process control computer to be installed in a server farm of an<br>
Application Service Provider belonging to the latter. The service<br>
provider makes available to the user via the Internet the process<br>
control system functions installed on the process control computer.<br>
The payment figure can now be calculated depending on the operations<br>
running on the process control computer, since the operations are<br>
initiated by a user operating activity over the Internet. In the<br>
case previously mentioned, where the process control computer does<br>
not become the property of the customer, but remains with the<br>
service provider, the customer's investments in his process control<br>
system are particularly small since he must only pay in accordance<br>
with the payment figure for the use of the functions that are<br>
installed on the process control computer.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention the process<br>
control computer includes a Web server and the client computer an<br>
Internet browser, so that the operations running on the process<br>
control computer can be influenced by means of the client computer<br>
over the Internet, in which case the operations also include those<br>
by which further operations can be initiated in further components<br>
of the process control system.<br>
This embodiment of the invention employs globally-available,<br>
universally-applicable Internet technologies to give the process<br>
control system Internet capabilities.<br>
The process control computer has a Web server, which can transfer<br>
over the Internet data processed and/or stored in the process<br>
control computer. The client computer can use the Internet browser<br>
to dial up the Web server of the process control computer over the<br>
Internet and use familiar Internet technologies (for example URL<br>
addressing or TCP/IP transmission protocol) to explicitly call up<br>
data from the process control computer and/or transfer commands to<br>
the latter.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention the process control system<br>
includes further components in which further operations run. These<br>
further components can for example be PLCs installed close to a unit<br>
of the technical system to be controlled and which receive from the<br>
process control computer a command to process a program stored in<br>
the PLC. To this extent operations which run in the process control<br>
computer initiate further operations in one or more further<br>
components of the process control computer, for example the<br>
execution of a program in a PLC, for example by an operator activity<br>
of a user who enters a command in the client computer that is<br>
transferred over the Internet to the process control computer and<br>
which causes the process control computer to initiate the execution<br>
of a program in the PLC.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention the components<br>
include field devices for monitoring and controlling components of a<br>
technical system that are connected by means of radio communications<br>
and/or by means of a fixed link to the process control computer and<br>
the further operations also include such operations as are executed<br>
in the field devices.<br>
Field devices in this embodiment include at least setting and<br>
measuring devices that are installed in a technical system and by<br>
means of which settings can be made to units in the technical system<br>
or measured values of components and/or units of the technical<br>
system can be recorded. In this case the commands to initiate at<br>
last one setting intervention are transmitted by radio from the<br>
process control computer to at least one setting unit and the<br>
measured values recorded by the measurement units are transferred by<br>
radio to the process control computer. If the setting or measurement<br>
units involve devices that are not assigned to any controller, by<br>
which, for example a radio connection can be established by a radio<br>
interface card installed in one of the controllers, at least one<br>
radio device is to be provided to which the setting and/or<br>
measurement devices are to be connected so that the data that arises<br>
can be transmitted by radio.<br>
The field devices also include what are known as "intelligent" field<br>
devices which have at least one microprocessor, so that the further<br>
operations, for example the execution cf a control program, can be<br>
executed in the field devices. The field devices in such cases are<br>
more or less powerful computers in their own right that can normally<br>
easily be made capable, for example by means of a radio interface<br>
card, of communicating over a radio link with the process control<br>
computer. In these cases practically only those int.elli.gent field<br>
devices which transmit setting commands to the setting units and<br>
read in measured values from the measurement units need to be<br>
installed in or near the location of the technical system. The field<br>
devices which perform the further operations are activated by means<br>
of the radio connection to the process control computer. The process<br>
control computer can thus be installed at almost any location with a<br>
radio connection and the client computer can be installed at almost<br>
any location with Internet access. In this way the process control<br>
system is particularly flexible with regard to the installation<br>
sites of the components of the process control system; Practically<br>
the entire functionality of the process control system can be<br>
realized in the process control computer, whereby however a part of<br>
the functionality can also be realized in the field devices and the<br>
client computer need only have an access to the Internet by means of<br>
a (widely-used) Internet browser. The client computer needs to have<br>
practically no specific process control system software and is<br>
therefore particularly cheap.<br>
Furthermore the configuration of the process control system in<br>
accordance with this embodiment offers the advantage that<br>
diagnostics and/or maintenance and/or repair of the process control<br>
system is made possible at least partly over the Internet.<br>
Especially advantageously communication between the components of<br>
the process control system is based on the TCP/IP transmission<br>
protocol.<br>
The most important components of the process control system are in<br>
this case the process control computer, the client computer and the<br>
field devices.<br>
The use of said transmission protocol, which is widely used in the<br>
Internet area, makes the development and/or the use of a specific<br>
transmission protocol and/or the use of a particular medium for<br>
communication, for example a bus system consisting of optical<br>
fibers, superfluous. Furthermore, using said transmission protocol<br>
makes it possible to exploit the known Internet technologies for<br>
data transmission and program execution.<br>
Advantageously the payment figure is a service fee to be paid by the<br>
user of the process control system to an Application Service<br>
Provider.<br>
With this embodiment of the invention a service provider<br>
(Application Service Provider) makes available the functionality of<br>
the process control system, preferably in the process control<br>
computer, and a user, for example a customer wishing to use the<br>
process control system, uses the process control system, in which<br>
case the payment figure determined as a service charge is to be paid<br>
by the user mostly in the form of money to the service provider.<br>
The user essentially pays only for those functions that he actually<br>
uses. He pays only for the time and/or period, at or during which he<br>
uses the functions.<br>
To implement this type of user-dependent, dynamic determination of<br>
the payment figure, a license server application is preferably to be<br>
provided in the process control computer which has access to project<br>
planning data and to current operating data arising and/or stored<br>
archive data of the technical system.<br>
Advantageously the customer can be equipped with a specific software<br>
program which on the one hand allows him to execute particular<br>
functions but on the other hand also obliges him to pay the<br>
corresponding "dynamic" usage-dependent payment figure that arises.<br>
Two exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in more<br>
detail below.<br>
The diagrams show:<br>
Fig. 1 a process control system in accordance with the invention,<br>
and<br>
Fig. 2 a process control system in accordance with the invention<br>
that can be operated over the Internet.<br>
Figure 1 shows a process control system 5 that features a processing<br>
unit 10.<br>
Processing unit 10 determines from the operations 7 executed in the<br>
process control system a payment figure W.<br>
The operations 7 can for example be operations which are executed<br>
after being initiated by an operating activity of process control<br>
system 5. An example of this is the selection of for example a<br>
graphical process image of the technical system into which current<br>
measured values of the technical system and operator boxes for<br>
operating the units of the technical system are incorporated. The<br>
activation of the operator boxes, for example by means of a mouse<br>
click by a user, or a key press on the keyboard to execute a<br>
function, are also included in the operations 7. Furthermore the<br>
operations 7 include control programs running in the process control<br>
system, for example one or more automation functions, that are for<br>
example implemented as a control algorithm. A further example: for<br>
operations 7 are activities undertaken by a user for project<br>
planning of the process control system 5, in which case for example<br>
new control functions are created and/or new control functions are<br>
assembled from prefabricated base functions that advantageously are<br>
kept in a set of basic functions, by for example interfaces of such<br>
basic functions being combined and the basic functions combined in<br>
this way forming a new function.<br>
Figure 2 shows a process control system 5 that includes a process<br>
control computer 15, a client computer 25 and the Internet 20, so<br>
that the process control system 5 can be operated by means of the<br>
Internet 20.<br><br>
The process control computer includes a Web server 30, by means of<br>
which in particular the data produced in this computer which relates<br>
to the operation of a technical system 50, can be transmitted over<br>
the Internet 20. Operations 7 run in the process control computer<br>
15, such as those already shown in conjunction with Figure 1 for<br>
example.<br>
The process control computer 15 further contains a processor unit 10<br>
which determines a payment figure W from the operations 7 and/or<br>
project planning data 55 and/or operating data 60.<br>
The project planning data 55 includes all data connected with the<br>
establishment of the process control system 5, especially in a<br>
software context. This is for example the type and number of<br>
control, regulation, operating and observation functions realized in<br>
process control system 5. From the project planning data 50 it can<br>
consequently be seen how the software system of the process control<br>
system 5 is constructed. The operating data 60 include at least<br>
current values of operating parameters, measured values and status<br>
parameters which currently predominate in the technical system 50<br>
and which are transferred to the process control computer 15. The<br>
operating data 60 can also include the stored archive data of the<br>
signals previously mentioned, from which a past operating state of<br>
the technical system 50 can be determined.<br>
The client computer 25 includes an Internet browser 35, by means of<br>
which it is possible to dial into the Web-Server 30 of the process<br>
control computer 15 via the Internet 20 so that the process control<br>
computer 15 of the process control system 5 can be operated over the<br>
Internet 20 Communication between the client computer and the<br>
Internet 20 and between the Internet and the process control<br>
computer 15 is preferably based on the TCP/IP-transmission protocol<br>
which is known from Internet technology and is widely used there.<br>
The process control computer 15 is further connected via a radio<br>
link F with further components 40 of the process control system 5.<br>
These further components 40 are for example designed as field<br>
devices with their own microprocessor so that further operations 8,<br>
e.g. execution of a control program or another automation functions<br>
is made possible on the further component 40.<br>
In their turn, the further components 40 control and/or regulate<br>
components 45 of the technical system 50.<br>
The architecture of this embodiment of the invention allows the<br>
process control computer 15 to be operated by means of the client-<br>
computer 25 over the Internet 20 and thereby operations 7 in the<br>
process control computer 15 to be run. Running of operations 7 can<br>
initiate running of further operations 8 in the further components<br>
40 of the process control system, if for example a user uses the<br>
client computer 25 to transfer via the Internet 20 to the process<br>
control computer 15 a control command relating to the technical<br>
system, where as a result operations 7 are executed which by means<br>
of the radio link F cause further operations 8 to be executed in the<br>
further components 40.<br>
In this case the operations 7 can for example be execution of an<br>
identification routine that identifies the control command entered<br>
by the user and, after identification is completed, runs a control<br>
algorithm as a further operation 8 in a further component, for<br>
example in a field device, by means of which a component 45, for<br>
example, a unit of the technical system, a motor or a pump is<br>
regulated.<br>
The payment figure W calculated by the processor unit 10 can for<br>
example be a service and/or license fee that is to be paid by the<br>
user of the process control system 5 to an Application Service<br>
Provider.<br>
