Figure I: shows the top view of the axle portion of ordinary bicycle with pedals and pedal arms. The rotation of the sprocket wheel is as same as the rotations of the pedals given by the rider. There is no arrangement of gears in the centre axle. The motion is transmitted directly from pedals to sprocket wheel.<br>

(201) on right side face.<br>

Figure 9:<br>
(a)	shows a graph in which the plot of number of cycles of pedals verses speed of the bicycle is linear which indicates that the number of cycles of pedals is directly proportional to the speed in case of ordinary bicycle.<br>
(b)	shows a graph in which the plot of number of cycles of pedals verses speed of the bicycle which indicates that as the number of cycles of pedals is increased the speed is also increased drastically (one rotation of pedals rotate four times the sprocket wheel which in turn rotates rear wheel).<br><br>
Figure 10:<br>
(a)	shows a graph in which the plot of number of cycles of pedals verses distance of the bicycle is linear which indicates that the number of cycles of pedals is directly proportional to the distance in case of ordinary bicycle.<br>
(b)	shows a graph in which the plot of number of cycles of pedals verses distance of the bicycle which indicates that as the number of cycles of pedals is increased the distance is also increased drastically.<br>
When the effort is applied on pedals, the primary axle (A) rotates in forward direction and the motion is transmitted from splined year wheel (100) to splined gear wheel (200) .Then the splined gear wheel (200) rotates reverse direction to that of splined gear wheel (100) (because of the splined gear wheel (100) and splined gear wheel (200) are engaged as spur gear system). The splined gear wheel (200) rotates the splined gear wheel (300) on reverse direction as the splined gear wheel (200) and splined gear wheel (300) are on same counter axle and are connected through ratchet gears (201) of splined gear (200) and clutch pin holes (301) of splined gear wheel (300). Simultaneously the splined gear wheel (300) rotates the splined gear wheel (400) on forward direction due lo meshing between them hence the motion is transmitted from splined gear wheel (300) to splined gear wheel (400),And the splined gear wheel (400) rotates the sprocket wheel which is mounted on the hollow secondary axle (B).<br>
Hence the motion is transmitted to the rear wheel of bicycle from the sprocket wheel through the chain. If the splined gear wheels (200) and splined gear wheel (300) are disengaged as show in Figure No.8 the motion will transmitted from splined gear wheel (100) to splined gear wheel (400) directly (since the clutch pin holes (101) of splined gear wheel (100)) coincides with the ratchet gears (401) of splined gear wheel (400) and allows motion only in forward direction) then the sprocket wheel gets power from hollow secondary axle (B) as in case of ordinary bicycle<br>
Let<br>
The splined gear wheel (100) made for one revolution<br>
D1- diameter of splined gear wheel<br><br>
[distance moved by the splined gear wheel (100) for one revolution =πD1<br>
hence the distance moved by the splined gear wheel (200) is equal to the splined<br>
gear whcei (100), but the angle made by the splined gear wheel (200)<br><br>
The angle made by splined the gear wheel (300) is same as that of gear wheel (200) and the distance moved by the splined gear wheel (300) is πD3 and is not equal distance moved by the splined gear wheel (200) {i.e..splincd gear wheel (200)<splined gear wheel in diameter></splined><br>
so for one revolution of the splined gear wheel (100) on primary axle (A) i.e., 360". then the splined gear wheel (400) on the hollow secondary axle (B) makes y' for one revolution.<br>
Rotation of splined gear wheel (100) = 360<br>
Rotations of the gear wheel (400) =[D1/D2* D3/D.4] *360" -   [D1/D2* D3/D4J * rotation Therefore the difference of cotations between the splined gear wheel (iOO) on primary axle (A) and splined gear wheel (400) on secondary axle (B) depends on the diameter D2, D4 in the measurement.<br>
The technology of the instant Application is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, the examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1: The splincd gear wheel (100) on primary axle (A) completes 1 revolution on forward direction by pedal, which in turn rotates the splined gear wheel (200) on counter axle(C) makes 1.1/2 revolutions in reverse direction. The gear wheel (300) on the counter axle(C) also makes 1,1/2 revolutions on reverse direction. The gear wheel (400) on hollow secondary axle (B) makes 2.1/4 revolutions forward direction which is on the hollow secondary axle (B). Hence the sprocket wheel also makes 2.t/4 revolutions. 'I'he pre wheel is connected lo the sprocket wheel by means of chain. And makes the pre wheel 4.1/4 rotations. Hence the back wheel of bicycle also makes 4 1/4 rotations. It means one rotation of pedal is equal to 4.1/4 rotations of back wheel. Thus, it is evident that the gear train system of the instant invention helps in achieving quadruplicate rotation with single pedaling. In addition, the speed or rotations of the gear train system can be varied by varying the gear ratios among the gears used in the gear train system, 'thus. the instant invention helps the subjects to travel more distance with minimum effort.<br><br><br>
