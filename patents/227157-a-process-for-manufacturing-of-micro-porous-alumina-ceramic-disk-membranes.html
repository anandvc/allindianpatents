				<td>The present invention is related to the field of fabrication of micro-porous<br>
ceramic membranes, which can be adapted for variety of purposes/applications<br>
in particular to the filtration/separation technologies. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a methodology for fabricating disk/pellet type<br>
alumina ceramic membranes of consistently uniform pore size and its distribution<br>
with superior mechanical strength and surface finish through maintenance in the<br>
uniformity of thickness of the membrane, all of the said can further be tailored to<br>
give rise alumina membranes with predetermined levels of pore size in the range<br>
of 0.3 to 0.6 micrometer. The present method also provides a guideline to<br>
fabricate alumina ceramic membranes in the entire spectrum of micro-filtration<br>
besides the defined range of 0.3 to 0.6 micron.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Membrane based processes are known for numerous applications, each being<br>
different in their mode and with separation characteristics. Pressure driven<br>
filtration processes, e.g. micro-, ultra- and nano-filtration, reverse osmosis;<br>
Concentration driven processes, e.g. gas separation, pervaporation, dialysis;<br>
Temperature driven processes, e.g. membrane distillation; Electrically driven<br>
processes, e.g. electrodialysis. It also can be used as a support for<br>
heterogeneous catalysis reactions and photo-catalysis reactions and processing<br>
involving adsorption or absorption reactions. The produced ceramic membranes<br>
can further be used as a support material for the fabrication of ultra-filtration,<br>
nano-filtration, reverse osmosis membranes. The main criterion considered in<br>
membrane filtration/separation process is the ability of the membrane to<br><br>
permeate selectively. Indeed, approximately 60 - 75% of synthetic polymer<br>
membranes are today employed as semi-permeable barrier layers. Organic<br>
Polymeric membranes have numerous advantages like flexibility to fabricate in<br>
the form of tubes and sheets. However they have great limitations like, they are<br>
susceptible to biodegradation (organic ones), have relatively short shelf and<br>
operating life, less resistant to organic solvents, chlorines, and extreme pH<br>
conditions, relatively less mechanical strength.<br>
In order to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, there is a need to<br>
develop new membrane materials, which can overcome the disadvantages of the<br>
polymeric/organic membranes, and at the same time, it should provide similar<br>
advantages comparable to the polymer/organic membranes.<br>
During the past few decades, ceramic membranes have been receiving greater<br>
attention because of their advantages over polymeric /organic and metallic<br>
membranes. Compared to polymeric based membranes, ceramic membranes<br>
exhibit unquestionable advantages, essentially due to their inherent properties.<br>
They can withstand high temperatures, high pressure (&gt; 100 bar), abrasion, and<br>
chemical attack, which makes them a very good materials for applications in<br>
harsh and extreme environments. Recent studies have showed that ceramic<br>
membranes exhibit high resistance against microbiological attack. Generally, they<br>
are stable up to 1000°C or more under pressure which enable them for high-<br>
temperature applications and thereby permitting sterilization operation in<br>
biochemical applications. Ceramic membranes can well tolerate chemical /<br>
mechanical cleaning, can readily accommodate the abrasion encountered in<br>
slurries, and resist the build up of high pressure (up to 30 atm) often used in<br>
back flushing techniques. Ceramic membranes have excellent reliability and long<br>
operating life. There is no structural deformation even under a wide range of<br><br><br>
operating conditions. Moreoever, the well-developed production technology<br>
provides membranes with high permeability and desired pore size. Due to the<br>
stringent operating conditions (wide pH range, repeated vapor sterilization,<br>
organic solvents, and temperatures up to 500°C) several industries have thought<br>
to immensely benefit from ceramic membranes in the field of agro-foodstuffs<br>
industries, biotechnology, biomedicine, paper industries, textile, and petroleum<br>
industries. Some membranes, which have been commercialized recently<br>
haveunequivocally longer life under harsh industrial conditions and their<br>
industrial use have shown a good degree of reliability in several applications. In<br>
some cases, the lifespan of membranes is greater than five years and have also<br>
significantly decreased the cost of maintenance in industrial facilities.<br>
However, even though the basic principles and methodology of ceramic<br>
membrane processing have already been known, tailoring/regulating pore size<br>
and the distribution of pore size, consistency in the uniformity in thickness of the<br>
membranes are still a major task to accomplish. Besides, improvement in<br>
mechanical strength and good surface finish despite allowing the membrane to<br>
possess a high porosity level is also a major task.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a fabrication method to obtain<br>
microporous alumina membranes with above-mentioned characteristics.<br><br><br>
PRIOR ART REFERENCE<br>
There are many prior arts reported in the preparation of ceramic membranes.<br>
Hay et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,426 has described the procedure of preparation<br>
of strong and durable alpha phase alumina ultrafitration membranes by seeding<br>
boehmite sols, and further coating on the support with a thin layer of gel to<br>
obtain a final pore size of less than about 500µm. The preparation of membranes<br>
by sol gel technology as disclosed by Mori et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,770,908<br>
describes a procedure of membrane preparation by disposing a layer of alumina<br>
sol on a porous membrane formed by hydroly2ing an alcoholate or a chelate of<br>
alumina followed by drying and burning thereof. Anderson, Marc A et al.<br>
conducted significant work on preparation of membrane by various procedures<br>
reported in EP No.0537944B1, U.S. Pat. No. 5.006,248, U.S. Pat. No. 5.096745,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,539, U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,576, U.S. Pat No.5,194,200, U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,208,190, U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,943, U.S. Pat No. 5,610,109, U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,712,037, and was able to create a stable, transparent metal oxide ceramic<br>
membrane, particularly alumina, titanium, and silica based with a narrow pore<br>
size distribution and with pore diameter manipulable in the range of 5 - 100 Å.<br>
Ail those inventions were based on preparation of membranes using sol-gel or<br>
improved sol-gel techniques using different precursors. The same group also<br>
invented the procedure (U.S. Pat. No.5,268,101) of preparing combined alumina<br>
and silica membranes having high surface area, small pore size with high<br>
temperature stability. Various other patent literatures like Van T Veen et al. U.S.<br>
Pat.No. 5,089,299, Maier US Pat. No. 5,250,184, Nishio et al. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,250,242, de Jong et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,703, Chen et al. U.S. Pat.<br><br><br>
No. 6,165,553 have described the method of creating membranes suing sol-gel<br>
techniques. Liu et ai. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,891 has described the method of<br>
preparation of mesoporous ceramic membranes by inserting a substrate into the<br>
reaction chamber at pressure and thereby allowing the deposition of nucleates<br>
on the substrate leading to the formation of a membrane layer therein. Yet in the<br>
same patent, it is reported one more method of preparation of ceramic<br>
membranes by placing a substrate between two solutions permitting the<br>
formation of membrane on the surface by or within the pores of the porous<br>
substrate. Webster et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,926 has disclosed the creation<br>
of supported microporous membranes by placing a porous support on one side in<br>
a colloidal suspension and drying the other side by exposing it to the drying<br>
stream of air or a reactive gas stream so that the particle are deposited on the<br>
drying side as membrane. Shimai et al. in U.S. Pat No. 5,405,529 has described<br>
yet another method of preparing ceramic filter consisting of bone like structure<br>
using ceramic-slurring foaming techniques. Bartton et al. in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,935,440 has disclosed a process for treating memebrane comprising a film of<br>
crystalline ceramic zeo-type material which process comprises treating the<br>
membrane with a silicic acid and or a polysilicic acid or a mixture of the both.<br>
Takahashi et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,007,800 has described a method of<br>
preparation of ceramic porous membrane and ceramic filter by the deposition of<br>
titania from titania slurry (1-70% by weight) on the surface on the porous<br>
substrate followed by thermally treating the membrane at 100-300°C in an<br>
aqueous vapor phase environment. Herrmann et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,546<br>
discloses various examples of preparing the micro and ultra pore membrane with<br>
controlled pore size like, single membrane layer by immersing the substrate in a<br><br><br>
solution of desired metal (dip coating) followed by sintering to remove organic<br>
binder (double dip coating), two layer graded membrane by dip coating, tape<br>
casting, screen printing, and finally two layer hybrid membrane on a metallic<br>
substrate<br>
via spin coating. Fain, Sr, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,649,255 reports an unexpected<br>
invention, a process for controlling the ultimate pore size of a fine-pored<br>
inorganic membrane, particularly chosen from the group of alumina, zirconia,<br>
titania, silica alumina/silica mixtures, can be achieved by depositing one<br>
monolayer at a time of an inorganic compound where the layer thickness<br>
approximately equals to the size of the molecule, such as metal oxide, metal<br>
nitride or the pore walls of the inorganic membrane followed subsequently by<br>
drying the membrane. Piner et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,214 presents yet<br>
another method of preparing inorganic membranes by suspending the mixture of<br>
fine and coarse particles in a liquid to form a slurry followed by poring the thus<br>
prepared slurry into a mould such as one made up of 'Piaster of Paris' thereby<br>
obtaining green intermediate product and finally baking, firing or sintering the<br>
green intermediate so as to obtain a finished membranes having a density<br>
distribution of fine particles that increases in one direction (surface in use) across<br>
the finished membrane and a density distribution of the coarse particles that<br>
decreases in the same direction across the finished membrane. The method of<br>
preparation of ceramic filters or membranes by sol-gel, tape casting methods is<br>
believed to suffer from the disadvantage like higher chances for cracks formation<br>
on the membrane surface during the binder burn-off and sintering due to large<br>
shrinkage ratio between the film and the substrate. Presence of even small<br>
cracks, crevices can have a remarkable deleterious effect on the performance of<br>
membranes and can render them substantially little value in many operations.<br>
This is because in many separation operations the effect of defects is essentially<br>
to provide a channel where the un-separated products can pass through.<br><br><br>
Though some existing methods of membrane preparation like slurry suspension,<br>
sol-gel, tape casting claim that a defect free membrane is obtained on a<br>
laboratory scale, but attempts to provide a substantially defect free membrane<br>
on a larger scale production have proved to be unsuccessful.<br>
In the background of aforesaid disadvantages of prior art, the present invention<br>
has devised a novel fabrication procedure for the preparation of ceramic<br>
membranes, in particular alpha phase of alumina ceramic having a consistent<br>
and uniform pore size, uniform pore distribution, uniform thickness appended<br>
with superior mechanical strength and surface finish characteristics.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Hence, it is the objective of the present invention to provide a fabrication<br>
procedure to produce microporous aluminum oxide (alumina) ceramic<br>
membranes in the form of disks/pellets with consistently uniform pore size,<br>
uniform pore distribution and uniform thickness with superior mechanical<br>
strength with surface finish characteristics by varying the same base<br>
composition.<br>
One of the objective of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
fabrication of ceramic membranes by routes other than sol-gel route, tape<br>
casting method, solution or colloidal route, isostatic pressing.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to fabricate ceramic membranes, in<br>
disk/pellet forms using alpha phase of aluminum oxide (alumina) in an efficient<br>
and predictable manner.<br><br><br>

membranes with controlled and uniform pore size and its distribution along with<br>
uniform thickness of the membrane.<br>
Still further objective of the proposed invention is to provide a fabrication<br>
method for generating reproducible and reliable alumina ceramic disk/pellet<br>
membranes for its applications in various filtration/separation processes.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to define various process<br>
parameters for producing the above alumina membranes, which are very<br>
significant for the continuous and beneficial production of the process.<br>
Yet further objective of the present invention is to provide alumina membrane<br>
substrates (supports) for generating ultra-filtration, nano-filtration, hyper-<br>
filtration, reverse osmosis membranes by applying further ceramic/polymer<br>
layer/s on the support structure thereby generating the said membranes, which<br>
has great applications in the other separation/purification technologies.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention describes the fabrication of a disk/pellet type ceramic<br>
membrane using alpha phase of alumina material that generates consistently<br>
uniform pore diameter which is manipulable in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 µm. For<br>
the said purpose, alumina powders with different particle size distribution but<br>
similar physical and chemical properties along with other additive materials such<br>
as binders, dispersants, deflocculant, sintering agent, pore former etc were used<br>
as the starting raw materials. In general, the fabrication process starts with a<br>
wet-mixing operation using predetermined quantities of the said raw materials<br>
using water in a ball mill mixer using nylon pot or a similar kind of container for a<br>
mixing period for about 24 to 48 hours.<br>
The sequence of addition of the constituents within the raw materials has an<br>
important effect on the characteristics of the membrane. As per the present<br>
invention, alumina powders were first mixed with water. Then, the dispersant<br>
sodium stearate was added to alumina powders to aid good dispersion<br>
consistency in the mixture followed by addition of other organic additives, i.e.<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, ammonium polyarcylate, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose etc. The mixing is carried out using different sizes of alumina balls in a<br>
ball mixer. The alumina balls are used in the present invention to avoid<br>
entrainment in the batch composition. However other kinds of balls can be used<br>
for mixing the above said raw materials by taking enough precaution to avoid<br>
entrainment or contamination of the starting materials from the balls. The<br>
aqueous suspension thus obtained after 24 to 48 hours of mixing is poured into a<br>
gypsum mould to drain out the solvent (water).<br><br><br>
The suspension was then dried under controlled conditions ambient or in an oven<br>
or both or other means in order to get the dry batch. The drying temperature is<br>
kept in the range of 60-100°C. Only water is eliminated during drying as the<br>
organic additives that have been incorporated in the batch during processing<br>
have decomposition temperature of higher than 600°C. The slurry is dried until<br>
the moisture content is reduced to 
weight % moisture level results over-dried powder, which subsequently looses its<br>
binding properties and hence makes the pressing of the powders difficult in the<br>
subsequent steps, thereby leading formation of cracks and or pinholes during the<br>
green stage. The resultant dry batch is further mixed either of the organic<br>
binders, like polyethylene glycol (PEG), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinyl<br>
alcohol (PVC) etc or similar, with appropriate quantity in the range of 1-5 weight<br>
% using a dry mixer or similar so as to obtain a binder-mixed batch composition<br>
that subsequently provides good strength to the uni-axially pressed green<br>
disk/pellets. The binder-mixed batch composition is then sieved using a 200<br>
mesh or similar so as to get the binder-mixed batch composition in granular<br>
form. The resultant granular composition is then weighed (depending on the<br>
thickness of the membrane to be fabricated) and poured in the stainless steel die<br>
of desired dimensions depending on the diameter/dimension of the membrane to<br>
be fabricated. The granular composition is then uniformly spread over the<br>
surface of the die cavity and pressed in the uni-axial direction at definite levels of<br>
pressure in order to obtain a predetermined geometrical shape of disk or pellet<br>
type.<br><br>
During uni-axial pressing, compaction occurs by crushing of the granules and<br>
mechanical redistribution of the particles into a closed packed array. The<br>
lubricant and binder usually aid in this redistribution and the binder provides<br>
cohesion of the batch material. A compaction pressure in the range of 5000 -<br>
5500 kPa was chosen to ensure breakdown of the granules and uniform<br>
compaction during uni-axial pressing. After the above uni-axial pressing, the<br>
disks/pellets those obtained are conventionally called as the green disks/pellets.<br>
The green disks/pellets need to be carefully dislodged form the die using a<br>
suitable scrapping mechanism. These green disks/pellets are dried in an oven in<br>
the temperature range of 50-100°C until the moisture content of the body is<br>
reduced to <: sufficient care was taken during drying in order to obtain a></:>
homogeneous dry surface. Improper drying or uncontrolled drying can lead to<br>
differential shrinkage, resulting in wrapping density gradients, and hence cracks<br>
in the green disks/pellets.<br>
The dried disks/pellets (moisture contlent 
refractory-lined high-temperature furnace or any other type of similar furnace at<br>
a temperature of in the range of 1550°C - 1580°C in presence of air or any<br>
suitable oxidizing atmosphere. The heating rate was maintained constant at<br>
1°C/min till 600°C is reached and the heating rate was increased to 1.5°C/min<br>
until the furnace temperature reaches 1000°C where disks/pellets were soaked<br>
for 60 min. Further sintering operation was continued by increasing the<br>
temperature of the furnace in the range of 1550° to 1580°C at a rate of 2°C/min<br>
and the resultant article was soaked at the said temperature for 120 min. In<br>
between the temperature of 300 - 600°C<br><br><br>
organic substances those incorporated in the body start decomposing, certain<br>
amount of which decomposes completely and some amount would still be there<br>
in the body as un-decomposed carbonaceous matter or soot. The strength of the<br>
material is reduced during this period. This soot is subjected to oxidation from<br>
about 8O0°C to 1000°C and so-called soot removal is carried out. To remove soot<br>
completely during this period, it is necessary to ensure effective supply of air or<br>
any oxidizing atmosphere in the firing environment. Sintering starts partly at the<br>
end of this oxidation period, the strength is increased slightly over. Active<br>
sintering takes place beyond 1300°C and the body goes on skrinking<br>
considerably. Therefore, sufficient attention is paid in maintaining uniform<br>
temperature throughout the furnace cavity to avoid uneven skrinkage and<br>
deformation of the fired membranes. The temperature of the furnace is raised to<br>
the specified value (1580°C), and then soaked at this temperature for a period of<br>
two hours and then the heating process is terminated. Even when the green<br>
body is large temperature differences may occur in different portion of the body.<br>
To prevent this, the temperature uniformity around the body particularly at the<br>
maximum temperature (1580°C) zone needs to be maintained very strictly.<br>
Embodiments construed under the proposed invention is illustrated in the<br>
following examples, with the help of accompanying drawings and tables in which<br>
Figures 1 to 6 represents pore size distribution of various alumina membrane<br>
formed and construed under the scope of the proposed invention.<br>

the method of this disclosed invention as follows. In the present invention,<br><br><br>
alumina (Al2O3 and other raw materials (inorganic type) were used as per the<br>
technical specifications furnished in the Table 1, whereas Table 2 shows the<br>
technical characteristics of the other additives (organic type) those used along<br>
with the said alumina for a batch preparation. As per batch composition, a typical<br>
batch composition as per Table 3 was prepared. Different sizes of alumina balls<br>
with varying diameters (3mm, 6mm and 9mm) each with a definite quantity was<br>
used as a media for mixing/grinding operation of the said batch composition. The<br>
batch composition was taken in a Teflon/nylon pot/jar, which was then placed on<br>
a mechanical pot mill (in-house fabricated) for the purpose of mixing the batch<br>
composition homogeneously, and the speed of the pot mill was kept in the range<br>
of 50 - 75 rpm. The composition was allowed to mix in the pot mill for a period<br>
of 48 hrs or so in order to ensure homogeneity of the batch composition. The<br>
size as well as the quantity of alumina balls in the mixing operation may vary<br>
from case to case depending on the batch size, however the main importance in<br>
the mixing process is laid to obtain the homogeneity of the batch composition.<br>
After the mixing operation, a slurry was formed, which was then transferred into<br>
a gypsum mould for drying the slurry under ambient condition. When the<br>
moisture content of the said slurry was reduced to less than 7 wt %, the semi-<br>
dried slurry was taken out from the mould and sieved the mass with a 200 mesh-<br>
size siever, which forms fine granules of the semi-dried slurry. The resultant<br>
granules was then poured into the cavity of a stainless stell die (in-house<br>
fabricated) and pressed in a uni-axiai pressing machine at a pressure of 5395<br>
kPa in the form of discs having an outer diameter of 57.8 mm, and a thickness of<br>
2.5 mm.<br><br><br>
The so pressed disks/pellets were identified as green body, which were dried at<br>
room temperature for about 30 min, later it was dried in an oven to a<br>
temperature not beyond 80°C maintaining a heating rate of 0.5 °C per minute<br>
until it reached at 80°C and were subjected to be dried in the said oven until the<br>
moisture content of the discs came down to a level of 
The resultant dried pressed disks / pellets with moisture content 
were subjected to consolidation or densification (sintering) operation in a<br>
refractory-lined high-temperature furnace procured from commercial sources) at<br>
a temperature of 1580°C in presence of air. The heating rate was maintained<br>
constant at 1.0°C/min till 600°C and the heating rate was increased to 1.5°C/min<br>
until the furnace temperature reaches 1000°C where it was soaked for 60 min.<br>
Further sintering operation was continued by increasing the temperature of the<br>
furnace at 1580°C with a heating rate of 2°C/min and was soaked at 1580°C for<br>
120 min in air. The furnace was then cooled down to 100°C at a uniform rate of<br>
3°C/min after which the further cooling to room temperature was carried by<br>
exposing the membrane disc/pellets in ambient atmosphere. Once the said<br>
process of sintering was completed, the so derived sample (fired body or micro-<br>
porous alumina membranes) was characterized for various physical properties.<br>
The microporous alumina membranes thus formed had a bulk density of 2.93 ±<br>
0.05 gm/cc, apparent porosity of 23.6 ± 1%, and a uniform pore radius of 0.3<br>
urn (See Table 3, Table 9 and Figure 1). The normalized flux of water of the thus<br>
prepared alumina membranes was found to be 95 l/m2/hr at 100kPa and 26°C<br>
(Table 10).<br><br><br>

explained in Example 1, except the batch consists with different compositions as<br>
represented in the Table 4.<br>

bulk density of 2,76 ± 0.05 gm/cc, apparent porosity of 29.9 ± 1%, and a<br>
uniform pore radius of 0.37 µm (Table 4, Table 9 and Figure 2). The normalized<br>
flux of water of the thus prepared alumina membranes was found to be 167<br>
l/m2/hr at lOOkPa and 26°C (Table 10).<br>
Example 3:<br>
Further, alumina membranes were prepared in the same manner as explained in<br>
Example 2, and as per the composition presented in Table 5.<br>

porosity of 31.3 ± 1% and a uniform pore radius of 0.41 µm (See Table 5, Table<br>
9 and Figure 3). The normalized flux of water of the thus prepared alumina<br>
membranes was found to be 224 l/m2/hr at 100kPa and 26°C (Table 10).<br>
Example 4:<br>
Further, alumina membranes were prepared in the same manner as explained in<br>
Example 3, and as per the composition presented in Table 6.<br><br><br>
The so-derived had a bulk density of 2.20 ± 0.05 gm/cc, apparent porosity of<br>
46.4 ± 1% and a uniform pore radius of 0.43 µm (See Table 9 and Figure 4).<br>
The normalized flux of water of the thus prepared alumina membranes was<br>
found to be 224 l/m2/hr at 100kPa and 26°C (Table 10).<br>

46.4 ± 1%, and a uniform pore radius of 0.43 µm (Table 6, Table 9 and Figure<br>
4). The normalized flux of water of the thus prepared alumina membranes was<br>
found to be 603 l/m2/hr at lOOkPa and 26°C (Table 10).<br>
Example 5:<br>
Further, alumina membranes were prepared in the same manner as explained in<br>
Example 4, and as per the composition presented in Table 7.<br>
The so-derived membranes had a bulk density of 2.03 ± 0.05 gm/cc, apparent<br>
porosity of 50.8 ± 1%, and a uniform pore radius of 0.53 µm (Table 7, Table 9<br>
and Figure 5). The normalized flux of water of the thus prepared alumina<br>
membranes was found to be 777 l/m2/hr at lOOkPa and 26°C (Table 10).<br><br><br>
Example 6:<br>
Further, alumina membranes were prepared in the same manner as explained in<br>
Example 5, and as per the composition presented in Table 8.<br>

porosity of 53.5 ± 1%, and a uniform pore radius of 0.57 urn (Table 8, Table 9<br>
and Figure 6). The normalized flux of water of the thus prepared alumina<br>
membranes was found to be 1340 l/m2/hr at 100kPa and 26°C (Table 10).<br>
Sufficient number of alumina membranes were prepared in accordance with<br>
examples 1-5 and were subjected to test for evaluation of characterization and<br>
validation for their effectiveness in maintaining consistent physical properties.<br>
The prepared membranes out of a particular batch exhibited similar values<br>
(within the limit) of physical properties like, bulk density, apparent porosity, bulk<br>
porosity, pore size, pore distribution, mechanical strength, surface texture, water<br>
permeability. The resultant ceramic membranes were characterized in terms of<br>
porosity/density measurements, scanning electron microscopy analysis, bubble<br>
point test and clarifications in dead-end micro-filtration mode using aqueous<br>
bakers yeast solution at different trans-membrane pressure (TMP) in the range<br>
of 50-250 kPa.<br>
Membranes fabricated in accordance to examples 1-4 were also tested for their<br>
effectiveness in filtering feeds of biological origin. For this purpose, 5g/l of 250<br>
ml synthetic bakers' yeast suspension was filtered through the membranes in a<br><br>
dead-end filtration fashion. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) across the<br>
membrane was varied in the range of 50-250 kPa and subsequent flux and<br>
quality of permeate was determined as a function of time. The concentration of<br>
the bakers'yeast in the permeate was sampled using standardized methods.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention as described and explained hereinabove with illustrated<br>
embodiment is in relation to non limiting embodiments which can be adopted,<br>
changed and modified within the scope and limit of the appended claims.<br><br>
