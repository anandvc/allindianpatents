Example S (starting material): Preparation of the compound of the formula<br>
(FormulaRemoved)<br>
To a solution of 277.2 g (1.0 mole) of 2,4-dichloro-6-tert-octylamino-1,3,5-triazine in 500 ml of xylene, heated to 70°C, 194.3 g (0.5 moles) of N,N'-bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)-1,6-hexanediamine and a solution of 67.3 g (1.2 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 68 ml of water are added, under stirring.<br>
During the addition, the mixture is heated up to 80°C and maintained at this temperature.<br>
After the addition, the mixture is maintained at 80°C for further one hour, under stirring. Then, the aqueous solution containing potassium chloride is decanted off and a xylenic suspension of the product is obtained. This suspension will be used without any isolation in the following Example 1.<br>
In the structural formulae of Example 1, n and b indicate that there are repetitive units in the molecules and the products obtained are not monodispers.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of the product corresponding to the formula<br>
(FormulaRemoved)<br>
Preparation of the compound of the formula<br>
A)	(FormulaRemoved)<br>
B)	1.397 (3.54 moles) of N,N'-bis(2,2I6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)-1,6-hexanediamine, a solution of 203.1 g (3.62 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 203 ml of water and 492 g of water are loaded in a pressure vessel, equipped with a suitable stirrer.<br>
C)	Then, the mixture is heated up to 70°C under stirring and a solution of 490.6 g (1.77 moles) of 2,4-dichloro-6-tert-octylamino-1,3,5-triazine in 980 ml of xylene are added.<br>
Due to the exothermal reaction, the temperature rises up to 100°C during the addition. Then, the vessel is closed and the mixture is heated to 180°C, and maintained at this temperature for 6 hours, under stirring. The internal pressure reaches 6 to 8 bars.<br>
After cooling down to 80°C, the aqueous phase is separated off. The organic phase is filtered, treated with 420 ml of water to eliminate the unreacted N,N'-bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)-1,6-hexanediamine as hydrate by precipitation, at a temperature of 45° to 20°C.<br>
The precipitate is filtered, washed with 100 ml of xylene and the washing xylene is mixed with the organic solution.<br>
About 300-350 ml of xylene are then distilled at 60°C/1 mbar and the xylenic solution of the product is used in B) without any isolation.<br>
B) The xylenic suspension of Example S) and the xylenic solution according to A) are loaded in a pressure vessel equipped with a suitable stirrer. Under intense stirring, a solution of 639.5 g (11.4 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 640 ml of water and 900 ml of water are added.<br>
The vessel is closed and the mixture is heated to 180°C. The internal pressure reaches 6 to 8 bars and the mixture is maintained at this pressure and at the indicated temperature for 6 hours, under stirring.<br>
After cooling down to 80°C, the aqueous phase is separated off, the organic phase, after filtration, is washed with water and xylene is distilled off at 60°C/1 mbar.<br>
After drying in an oven in vacuo at 60°C/1 mbar, a white product with a melting range of 123° to 136°C is obtained.<br>
