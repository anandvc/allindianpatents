				<td>COSMETIC HAIR COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING METAL-OXIDE LAYERED PIGMENTS AND FUNCTIONALIZED METAL-OXIDE LAYERED PIGMENTS AND<br>
METHODS OF USE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[001]The disclosure relates to cosmetic hair compositions containing metal-oxides layered pigments. The disclosure also relates to the use of the metal-oxide layered pigments in cosmetic hair compositions. The disclosure also relates to cosmetic compositions containing functionalized metal-oxides layered pigments. The disclosure also relates to the use of the functionalized metal-oxide layered pigments in cosmetics such as hair, eyes, lips, skin and nail compositions. The metal-oxide layered pigments are functionalized with ligands which provide improved properties to the pigments in the cosmetics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[002] Pigments are used in cosmetic compositions to alter the color and appearance of hair, eyes, lips, skin and nails. Metal-oxide layered pigments have been used in some of these compositions because they can provide for a variety of colors. Because of poor compatibility of the metal-oxide layered pigment with other components of the cosmetic compositions, the pigments are sometimes hydrophobically modified to improve the compatibility of the pigment with oil containing cosmetic compositions. However, the unwanted transfer of these pigments in applications such as hair cosmetics is a problem. Ideally, the pigment should stay where the pigment initially applied to the hair and not be transferred to other locations such as hands, skin, clothes and furniture. In addition, while the pigment should stay on the hair, the hair composition should provide other desirable hair properties such as manageability and feel. Specifically, hair stiffness should not be adversely affected by the hair composition, in addition, while a variety of colors is available, a greater variety of colors is desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[003]The disclosure involves compositions for use in hair cosmetics. The compositions contain a metal-oxide layered pigment, optionally, at least one film-former, at least one stabilizer and<br>
<br>
 <br>
at least one auxiliary ingredient where the metal-oxide layered pigment contains at least two layers. The compositions are useful in cosmetic hair compositions. The metal-oxide layered pigments provide improved optical effects when applied to hair. For example, hair color shifts depending upon viewing angle (color travel effect) and the pigments improve the shine of hair.<br>
[004]The disclosure also involves compositions for use in cosmetics. The compositions contain the composition described above and further comprising at least one polymer where the surface of the metal-oxide layer pigment is functionalized with a ligand by formation of at least one bond between a metal at the surface of the metal-oxide layered pigment and the ligand. The compositions are useful in cosmetics such as skin, hair, eye, lip and nail compositions. The functionalized metal-oxide layered pigment of the disclosure gives improved properties to the cosmetic formulation including improved color variety and pigment trainsfer properties.<br>
[005] The functionalized pigments give improved surface properties to the pigments such that the pigment transfer characteristics of the pigment are improved. In addition, careful selection of the ligand that functionalizes the pigment can be used to fine tune the color of the pigment. This fine tuning of color is achieved by selecting the ligand such that the ligand to metal charge transfer that occurs between the ligated metal in the metal-oxide pigment and the ligand gives the desired color. (T. Rajh et al., "Surface Restructuring of Nanoparticles: An Efficient Route for Ligand-Metal Oxide Crosstalk", J. Phys. Chem., B2002, 106, 10543-10552). This technique provides for a greater variety of colors for the metal-oxide pigments.<br>

[0152]The disclosure also relates to a method for treating hair, skin, lips, eyes and nails which first involves formulating a suitable composition with the composition of the disclosure. The suitable composition is then applied to the hair, skin, lips, eyes and nails.   The specific<br>
<br>
 <br>
suitable composition contains components of the disclosed composition in a concentration which varies for each of these applications.<br>
[0153]The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. The examples are prepared by mixing the components using techniques standard in the cosmetics industry.<br>
[0154]A cosmetic gel and a cosmetic mousse composition were prepared in accordance with the disclosure. The components of the compositions are listed in Formula I and Formula II in the following tables. The functionalized metal-oxide pigment for each was a silica/iron oxide layered pigment functionalized with a PEG-DOPA polymer substituted catachol compound.<br>

[0155]Next, several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the disclosed composition. The results of the experiments are summarized in Table 1. In the experiments, several formulations are prepared with various amounts of film-former, stabilizer and auxiliary components. The formulations are tested on hair for pigment transfer properties, pigment dust effect. The samples are rated on a five step rating from low to high (low, low-medium, medium, medium-high and high). The pigment transfer property is a subjective measure of how easily the pigment is transferred from the hair after the composition is applied to the hair. The transfer property is measured by handling the hair and evaluating how much pigment transfers from the hair. A low pigment transfer effect is desirable whereas a high transfer effect is undesirable.<br>
[0156]The color travel effect is a subjective measure of how much the color of the treated hair shifts depending upon viewing angle (color travel effect). The same five step rating described above is utilized; however, a low color travel effect is undesirable and a high effect is most desirable.<br>
[0157]The pigment dust effect is a subjective measure of how much pigment dust is generated when the hair is handled after the disclose composition is applied to the hair. The five step rating described above is utilized. A low pigment dust effect is most desirable and high dust effect is most undesirable.<br>
[0158] The results of a study demonstrating the efficacy of the disclosed composition in cosmetic hair formulations is summarized in Table 1.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
1.	The balance of ingredients include water and other components necessary to complete the<br>
type of hair formulation.<br>
2.	Pigment transfer is a measure of transfer of pigment from the hair (Low=most desirable,<br>
High=least desirable)<br>
3.	Pigment travel effect is the optical effect of color shift of the pigment on the hair<br>
(Low=least desirable, High=most desirable)<br>
4.	Pigment dust effect is the amount of dust generated from the pigment from the hair in<br>
everyday use (Low=most desirable, High=least desirable).<br>
[0159]Inspection of Table 1, shows that in the absence of one of the auxiliary, stabilizer or film former components, the cosmetic hair formulation has poor pigment transfer and poor<br>
 <br>
pigment dust properties.  These results demonstrate the unexpected efficacy of the disclosed composition in cosmetic hair compositions.<br>
