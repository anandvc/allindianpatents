Method for Producing a Disk-Shaped Work Piece on the Base of a Dielectric<br>
Substrate and a Vacuum Treatment Plant for This<br>
This invention is based on a method for producing a disk-shaped work piece on the base<br>
of a dielectric substrate that includes treatment in a plasma processing chamber that is<br>
formed between opposite electrode faces in a vacuum container.<br>
Definition<br>
As "electrode face" we define a surface that is freely subjected to the plasma processing<br>
chamber.<br>
In the mentioned method, on which the invention is based, an electrical high frequency<br>
field is generated between the electrode faces and thus a high frequency plasma discharge<br>
is created in the processing chamber fed with reactive gas. One electrode face is made of<br>
a dielectric material and a high frequency potential with pre-given, varying distribution is<br>
applied to it along the surface. The distribution of the electrical field in the plasma<br>
processing chamber is adjusted by potential distribution on the dielectric electrode face.<br>
In the method used as a basis, either the dielectric electrode face is formed with the<br>
substrate, or the substrate is arranged on the metallically designed second electrode face.<br>
Further, on the electrode face lying opposite to the substrate the reactive gas is introduced<br>
from an opening pattern into the processing chamber.<br>
In the last few years one is endeavouring more and more to produce larger disk-shaped<br>
work pieces using reactive, high frequency plasma-aided methods, among other things in<br>
order to reduce the production cost. Thus high frequency plasma-aided methods<br>
(PHfECVD) are used for substrate coating or as reactive high frequency plasma aided<br>
etching methods. The mentioned endeavour can be particularly recognized in the<br>
production of liquid crystal displays (LCD), TFT-displays or plasma-displays, as well as<br>
in areas of photo-voltage technology and particularly in the field of solar cells production.<br><br>
While conducting such production method with the help of the mentioned high frequency<br>
plasma supported reactive process using the known laminar metal electrodes lying<br>
parallel opposite to one another, each with a flat electrode face towards the processing<br>
chamber in a vacuum container, and applying the electrical high frequency field for<br>
plasma excitation, it was observed that when the substrate became larger and/or the<br>
exiting frequency fHf became higher, then the dimension of the vacuum container, in top<br>
view on the substrate, is no longer of subordinated significance. This is particularly with a view on the wave length of the used high frequency electromagnetic field in the<br>
vacuum. The distribution of the electrical high frequency field in the vacuum chamber,<br>
considered parallel to the electrode faces, becomes non-uniform and partly deviates<br>
significantly from an average value, which leads to a non-uniform treatment of the work<br>
piece positioned on one of the electrode faces: during etching one obtains a non-uniform<br>
distribution of the etching effect while coating, for example the layer thickness, the<br>
stoichiometry of the coating material etc. Such significant non-homogeneity in the<br>
treatment cannot be tolerated in some applications, like particularly in the production of<br>
the mentioned liquid crystals, TFT-or plasma displays, as well as in photovoltaic, and<br>
also particularly in the production of solar cells. The mentioned non-homogeneities are<br>
even more pronounced, the more the mentioned dimension or expansion of the container<br>
approaches the wave length of the electrical field in the container.<br>
For a solution to this problem, basically different principles are known:<br>
From the document US 6 631 692 and document US-A-2003/0089314 it is known how to<br>
form the plasma processing chamber between two opposite metallic electrode faces and<br>
thereby to shape one or both of the opposite lying metallic electrode faces.<br>
The metallic electrode face lying opposite the substrate lying on the other electrode face<br>
or the other metallic electrode face on which the substrate lies, or both opposite-lying<br>
metallic electrode faces are designed concave. This previously known process is<br>
schematically depicted in fig. 1, where:<br><br>
1a and 1b: represent the opposite lying metallic electrode faces above the processing<br>
chamber PR, between which the high frequency field E is applied;<br>
Er, Ec:	denote the corresponding peripheral and central electrical field generated.<br>
Another physically basic principle, on which the present invention is based in order to<br>
solve the above mentioned problem, has become known from the document US 6 228<br>
438 of the same applicant who is filing this application. The principle of the procedure<br>
according to the document US 6 228 438 is first supposed to be described on the basis of<br>
fig. 2, which however depicts a version not published in the mentioned document.<br>
However, this is supposed to serve the purpose of basic comprehension. One of the<br>
opposite-lying electrode faces 2a is for example metallic, as shown. The second<br>
electrode face 2b, on the other hand, is made of dielectric material, e.g. a dielectric,<br>
laminar, thin plate 4. Along the dielectric electrode face 2b a potential distribution ϕ2b is<br>
created, which in spite of constant distance between both the electrode faces 2a and 2b in<br>
the processing chamber PR effects the desired local field distribution, as shown, e.g. in<br>
the edge region a stronger field Er than in the central region Ec. This can for example be<br>
realized as shown in fig. 2, in that a high frequency generator 6 is coupled through<br>
capacitive elements CR, CC differently on to the dielectric plate 4 corresponding to the<br>
desired distribution. In the design form of the principle used in fig. 2, which is however<br>
not published in the mentioned document US 6 228 438, the coupling capacities CR<br>
should be selected with greater capacitance value than the centre capacitance CC- The<br>
design of the capacitance CR or Cc is created according to the document US 6 228 438 in<br>
such a way as shown in fig. 3. A dielectric 8 is foreseen, that on the one hand forms the<br>
electrode face 2b as shown in fig. 2, which at the same time on account of the locally<br>
varying thickness d with respect to a metallic coupling face 10, forms the locally varying<br>
capacitances CR, c, as foreseen in fig. 2. The dielectric 8, as shown in fig. 4, can thereby<br>
be formed by solid body dielectric or by an evacuated or gas-filled hollow face 8a<br>
between the metallic coupling face 10 and a dielectric plate 4 forming the electrode face<br>
2b. It is important that in the last mentioned hollow face 8a there is no plasma discharge.<br><br>
This invention is based on the already known procedure according to the document US 6<br>
228 438 that is basically explained on the basis of fig. 2 to 4. In this procedure the<br>
question crops up as to where a substrate to be treated should be positioned in the<br>
processing chamber PR, on the dielectric electrode face 2b or on the metallic electrode<br>
face 2a. In the mentioned document US 6 228 438 it is taught how to deposit dielectric<br>
substrate on the electrode face 2b or electrode face 2a, as against (Kol. 5, Z. 35 ff.)<br>
substrate with electrically conducting surface on the metallic electrode face 2a.<br>
It is further known from the mentioned document, how to introduce reactive gas into the<br>
processing chamber, namely from an opening pattern distributed on the electrode face<br>
lying opposite to the substrate to be treated. If a dielectric substrate as shown in fig. 3<br>
and 4 is deposited on the electrode face, then the opening pattern with the gas feeding<br>
channel should be provided on the side of the metallic electrode face 2a. If the substrate<br>
is arranged on the metallic electrode faces 2a, then the opening pattern for the reactive<br>
gas is provided on the side of the dielectric electrode face 2b. In that case, as one can<br>
obviously see in fig. 4, the hollow chamber 8a can be used as compensation chamber and<br>
the reactive gas can be first introduced through the metallic coupling arrangement with<br>
coupling face 10 into the compensation chamber 8a and through the opening pattern<br>
foreseen in the dielectric plate 4 into the processing chamber PR. However, it is also<br>
possible to fill the hollow space 8a with a dielectric solid, whether it is with the material<br>
forming the dielectric electrical surface 2b or one or more at least partially different ones<br>
and the opening pattern passing through this solid supplying the reactive gas through<br>
distributed pipes.<br>
One should basically assume that the combination of the opening pattern for introducing<br>
the reactive gas into the processing chamber and the dielectric 8 or 8a as shown in figures<br>
3 or 4 on a single electrode array is much more complicated than providing the opening<br>
pattern on the electrode face 2a as shown in fig. 3 and depositing the substrate to be<br>
treated on the dielectric electrode face 2b, or even forming the dielectric electrode face 2b<br>
by a dielectric substrate itself.<br><br>
It seems to be advantageous to functionally separate the gas inlet arrangement with the opening<br>
pattern and the influencing measures for the electrical field, i.e. whenever possible to deposit the<br>
substrate to be treated on the dielectric electrode face, or to form the dielectric electrode face 2b at<br>
least partly by the substrate and to shape the gas inlet conditions through the opening pattern on the<br>
metallic electrode face 2a.<br>
It is the task of this invention to suggest a method for producing a disk-shaped work piece on the<br>
base of a dielectric substrate, with the help of which work pieces provided with a special coating can<br>
be produced by using the already known method from the document US 6 228 438. The thus<br>
produced disk-shaped work pieces should particularly be suitable for application as solar cells. This is<br>
achieved, in that the dielectric substrate is first coated with a coating material, at least section-wise,<br>
i.e. before treatment in the already mentioned high frequency plasma processing chamberwith<br>
specific resistance p:<br>
and having specific surface resistance Rs of the coating:<br>
then the coated substrate is positioned on the metallic electrode face and etched or coated in a<br>
reactively plasma-aided manner in the plasma processing chamber.<br>
As already mentioned, although in the already known procedure it was endeavoured to achieve a<br>
functional separation of gas inlet measures and field influencing measures and their allocation to<br>
respective. electrode faces due to design reasons, it has been seen that the combination of pre-<br>
coating the dielectric substrate with the mentioned coating and the basically known PHfECVD-method<br>
achieved success only when after the coating the substrate is deposited in the plasma processing<br>
chamber on the metallic electrode face and the field influencing measures as well as reactive gas<br>
inlet can be realised combined through the mentioned opening pattern in the region of dielectric<br>
electrode face.<br>
It was found out that after completing the coating of the dielectric substrate with a specific layer,<br>
only the mentioned substrate positioning leads to success and hence the<br><br>
function combination on the dielectric electrode face, initially considered as<br>
disadvantageous, has to be realised. With this suggested procedure one can also achieve a<br>
high flexibility with respect to the type of Hf-plasma-treatment. Irrespective of whether<br>
the dielectric substrate coated according to the procedure with the specified layer is<br>
etched or coated, and also irrespective of whether the coating is done by a PHfECVD-<br>
process dielectrically or electrically high conductively, the respective treatment process is<br>
not influenced, as far as the effect of the field distribution measures in the plasma<br>
'processing chamber or the gas inlet measures are concerned.<br>
As already mentioned above, within the scope of this invention the dielectric substrate is<br>
first coated with a material whose specific electrical resistance p is significantly higher<br>
than materials that are traditionally described as "metallic" or "electrically conductive".<br>
Thus the specific resistances of traditional conductive materials like gold, silver, copper,<br>
aluminium lie in the range of 1.7 x 10-6 12cm 2.7 x 10-612cm.<br>
Definition<br>
The surface resistance Rs is obtained from the quotient of the specific resistance p and<br>
the layer thickness. It has the dimension Ω, indexed with the sign □ . The surface<br>
resistance Rs of a considered layer is dependent on the material as well as the thickness.<br>
According to this invention, it was found that the selection of method is not dependent on<br>
whether the surface of a dielectric substrate is pre-coated with electrically more<br>
conductive or electrically less conductive material, but decisively dependent on how the<br>
surface resistance Rs of the layer is in case of the mentioned material.<br>
In a design form of the method as per the invention the distribution of high frequency<br>
potential on the dielectric electrode face and the inlet of reactive gas into the processing<br>
chamber is realized, in that the dielectric electrode face is formed by a surface of a<br>
dielectric plate array towards the processing chamber, whose back side forms a chamber<br>
with its metallic coupling face, whereby the distance of the back side of the coupling<br>
face, along these faces varies and furthermore, the reactive gas is introduced into the<br><br>
chamber and then through the opening pattern provided in the plate array into the<br>
processing chamber. On the coupling face and the other electrode face that is electrically<br>
conductive, a high frequency signal is applied for plasma exciting.<br>
Due to the varying distance between metallic coupling face and back side of the dielectric<br>
plate array the capacitance distribution as shown in fig. 2 can be realized and the chamber<br>
space between this back side and the metallic coupling electrode face is simultaneously exploited as distribution chamber for the reactive gas that flows through the opening<br>
pattern in the dielectric plate array into the processing chamber.<br>
When we speak of "reactive gas" within the framework of this application, then we are<br>
also referring to a gas mixture with one or more reactive gases. The mentioned dielectric<br>
plate array, with view on fig. 2, forms with its capacitance value determined by its<br>
thickness, part of the coupling capacitances CR or Cc shown in fig. 2. Thus, in a design<br>
form, the dielectric plate array can be used with a pre-given variable thickness<br>
distribution. In another design form however, the dielectric plate array is used with an at<br>
least approx. constant thickness. In yet another design form, the potential distribution on<br>
the dielectric electrode face from the centre towards its periphery increasingly approaches<br>
the potential of the coupling face. This is achieved in the realization of the above<br>
mentioned chamber between metallic coupling and back side of the dielectric plate array,<br>
in that the reference distance in the periphery region is selected lesser than in the centre<br>
region and/or, in that the thickness of the dielectric plate array is designed lesser in the<br>
peripheral region than in the central region.<br>
The capacitance is selected lesser in the centre region than in the peripheral region.<br>
While designing this capacitance through a chamber (8a of fig. 4), it is for example done<br>
in the following way:<br>
a)	the metallic coupling face is designed largely flat, the dielectric plate array largely<br>
with constant thickness and, considered from the process chamber, convex;<br>
b)	the dielectric plate array is designed with largely constant thickness and flat, the<br>
coupling face, considered from the processing chamber, is concave;<br><br>
c)	the coupling face is designed concave, the back side of the dielectric plate array also<br>
similarly and, considered from the processing chamber, the dielectric electrode face is<br>
concave;<br>
d)	the coupling face is designed largely flat, the dielectric plate array with flat back side<br>
parallel to the coupling face and, considered from the processing chamber, with<br>
convex electrode face;<br>
e)	the coupling face is designed flat, similarly also the electrode face, however the plate<br>
back side, considered from the processing chamber, is convex.<br>
If no chamber is foreseen, then for example, the coupling face and the electrode face can<br>
be parallel; the dielectric constant of the solid body dielectric lying in between can<br>
increase towards the periphery.<br>
It is apparent that for optimisation of the field distribution of the processing chamber, on<br>
the one hand, and the gas inlet direction distribution into the processing chamber, on the<br>
other hand, there is high flexibility. Although the field distribution measures and the gas<br>
distribution measures are carried out on the same electrode array, both magnitudes can be<br>
optimized. The procedures mentioned in the example can also be used in a mixed and<br>
combined manner. For example, the coupling face can be designed largely flat, the<br>
dielectric plate array with varying thickness and having, considered from the processing<br>
chamber, a concave back side and convex electrode face. Furthermore, it is clear to the<br>
expert that as a further design magnitude for the capacitance distribution explained in fig.<br>
2, also the dielectric constant of the dielectric plate array or its distribution can be used.<br>
By selecting different materials along with the dielectric plate array the mentioned<br>
capacitance distribution and hence the potential distribution on the dielectric electrode<br>
face can be influenced additionally or alternatively to the distance variation or thickness<br>
variation.<br>
The dielectric electrode face can thereby be selected flat and parallel to the other<br>
electrode defining the processing chamber, in order to realize a plasma processing<br>
chamber of constant depth perpendicular to the electrode faces. This preferred designed<br><br>
form can be obtained, in that the metallic coupling face is designed concave considered<br>
from the processing chamber, the back side of the plate array is designed flat, or by<br>
designing the back side of the plate array convex when considered from the processing<br>
chamber, by making the coupling face flat, or by using materials of different dielectric<br>
constant along the dielectric plate array or electrode face; in the flat metallic coupling<br>
surface and additionally parallel flat plate back side, higher dielectric constant is used in<br>
the periphery region than in the centre region.<br>
If one considers that with the method as per the invention particularly large substrates<br>
with an expansion of their circumference of at least 0.5 m can be coated according to the<br>
invention and then subjected to Hf-plasma-treatment, then it is apparent that the above<br>
mentioned dielectric plate array with opening pattern and chamber formation is<br>
cumbersome.<br>
Therefore, in another design form the dielectric plate array is formed by ceramic tiles.<br>
These tiles can be mounted centrally with respect to the metallic coupling face and<br>
positioned at a distance. In this way the dielectric electrode face does not get deformed on<br>
account of thermal deformation of the tiles, which could have a negative influence on the<br>
field distribution and sometimes on the reactive gas feeding into the processing chamber.<br>
Furthermore, the tiles made of different materials with different dielectric constants, with<br>
different thicknesses and thickness profiles can be flexibly used for specific formation of<br>
desired plate properties and through mutual overlapping and multi-layered arrangement<br>
can be used for shaping concave or convex electrode faces or array back side.<br>
At this juncture it is once again emphasized that - if a chamber is formed - it is important<br>
to prevent that parasite plasma discharges occur in this chamber formed between metallic<br>
coupling face and the back side of the dielectric plate array, in which case the effect of<br>
this chamber as laminar distributed coupling capacitance would be negated. As is known<br>
to the expert, this is ensured by measuring the distance ratios between metallic coupling<br>
face and back side of the dielectric plate array, in any case lesser than the dark chamber<br>
distance valid from the respective process.<br><br>
In another design form of the method according to the invention, the distance of the plate<br>
array back side varies from the metallic coupling face in one step or preferably in several<br>
steps, and/or the thickness of the plate varies in one step or preferably in several steps.<br>
This design form is realized by using overlapping tiles for structuring the dielectric plate<br>
array, or if several tile layers are used with locally variable number of layers.<br>
In yet another design form, the distance of the plate array back side from the metallic<br>
coupling face varies constantly, and/or the thickness of the plate array varies constantly.<br>
This design is used if a largely flat dielectric plate array is used, with constant thickness<br>
and the metallic coupling face, considered from the processing chamber, is shaped<br>
concave.<br>
In another design form of the production method according to the invention, particularly<br>
for solar cells, the dielectric substrate, before treatment of the plasma processing<br>
chamber, is coated with electrically conductive oxide, preferably with electrically<br>
conductive and transparent oxide. This coating before the treatment can be done, for<br>
example, by reactive magnetron sputtering. It is further preferable if the dielectric<br>
substrate is coated with one of the following materials: ZnO, InO2, SnO, additionally<br>
doped or not doped, with a thickness D, for which the following is applicable:<br>
10 nm 
Coating of the mentioned material within the given thickness range fulfils the layer<br>
properties given above with respect to specific resistance p and surface resistance Rs.<br>
The thus coated substrate is subsequently reactively etched and/or reactively coated by<br>
treatment in the plasma processing chamber. As reactive gas, preferably at least one of<br>
the following gases is used: NH3, N2, SF6, CF4, Cl2, O2, S2, CH4, silane, disilane, H2,<br>
phosphine, diboran, trimethylbor, NF3.<br>
For example, the following layers are deposited.<br><br>
Layer:	Used reactive gas:<br>
Amorphous silicon	SiH4, H2<br>
(a-si)<br>
n-doped a-si<br>
 (please see the original)<br>
micro-crystaline si<br>
For reactive etching, one uses for example SF6 mixed with O2 as reactive gas.<br>
The electrical high frequency field is additionally excited with frequency fFf, for which<br>
the following is applicable:<br>
10 mhz<fhf mhz></fhf>
or<br>
13 mhz 
The produced work pieces further have a preferred circumference radius of at least 0.5 m.<br>
A vacuum treatment plant used within the scope of the method according to the invention<br>
has the following:<br>
•	A vacuum container, and in it<br>
•	A first flat-metallic electrode face;<br>
•	A second dielectric electrode face towards the first that forms one surface of the<br>
dielectric plate array;<br>
•	A metallic coupling face towards the back side of the dielectric plate array;<br>
•	Electrical terminals on the coupling face and the first electrode face;<br>
•	A gas pipe system that passes through the coupling face and a distributed pattern of<br>
openings through the plate array; and<br>
has a special feature that the plate array is formed by a several ceramic tiles.<br><br>
Design forms of the vacuum treatment plant according to the invention can become clear<br>
to the expert from the claims as well as the subsequent descriptions of the invention on<br>
the basis of the examples.<br>

Fig. 5 shows the sequence of the method as per the invention on the basis of a simplified<br>
block diagram. A dielectric substrate 100 is coated with a layer at a first vacuum coating<br>
station 102, e.g. station for reactive magnetron sputtering, whose material has a specific<br>
resistance p,<br>
and in such a way, that the resulting surface resistance Rs of the layer lies in the specific<br>
ranges<br>
The lower limit can go towards 0, because the surface resistance Rs is dependent on the<br>
thickness of the deposited layer. This thickness Ds of the layer is preferably selected as<br>
follows:<br>
especially as the deposited layer material is an electrically conducting oxide (CO), sometimes<br>
a transparent, electrically conducting oxide (TCO). For this, at least one of the following<br>
	materials is deposited on the dielectric substrate: InO2, ZnO, Sn02, doped or not doped.<br>
Subsequently the coated dielectric substrate 104 is fed to a reactive Hf-plasma-treatment<br>
step at the station 105, namely a PHfECVD treatment step, or to a reactive Hf-plasma-aided<br>
etching step. The result is a work piece 106 that is particularly suitable for application as<br>
solar cells.<br><br>
The substrate 100 and hence also the resulting substrate 106 as per the invention thereby<br>
has a circumference radius Ru of at least 0.25 m, corresponding to a circumference of<br>
diameter 0.5 m, as shown in fig. 5 with the help of an arbitrarily shaped work piece W.<br>
Fig. 6 shows in cross-section and simplified, a first design form of a station or plant 105<br>
as per the invention used according to fig. 5. A metallic vacuum container 105a has a flat<br>
basic surface 3 which pointing towards inner space and forms the first electrode face EF1.<br>
On this lies the substrate 104 made of dielectric material, coated - 7 - with the mentioned<br>
coating material.<br>
An electrode array 9 is mounted lying opposite to the substrate 104 provided with a<br>
coating 7 or opposite to the first electrode face EF1. It forms the second electrode face<br>
EF2.<br>
The second electrode face EF2, lying flat opposite to the electrode face EF1 in the shown<br>
example, is formed by the surface of a dielectric array 27. The back side ER of the<br>
dielectric array 27 along with a metallic coupling face KF forms a chamber 10. In the<br>
shown example the coupling face KF is designed as in-shape 10 which, considered from<br>
the processing chamber PR, is worked-in concave into a metal plate 14. The example of<br>
the in-shape 10 shown is, as shown schematically in fig. 7, rectangular and forms a<br>
distance distribution of the distance d between coupling face KF and back side ER of the<br>
dielectric plate array 27 that jumps sporadically from 0 to the constant distance in the<br>
recess 10. The substrate 104 is plotted in fig. 7 by a dashed line. Through the metal plate<br>
14 a high frequency generator 13 is connected to the coupling face KF, which again is<br>
connected to the electrode face EF1 applied with reference potential in the usual way.<br>
From a gas storage 15, reactive gas GR or a reactive gas mixture, or if required, a working<br>
gas GA, e.g. argon, is fed through a distribution system 17 into a preliminary chamber 19<br>
on the rear side of the plate 14. The pre-chamber 19 is bordered on the one side by a<br>
holder 18 insulating the plate 14 with respect to the container 105a, and on the other<br>
hand, formed by the back side of the plate 14 and the plant wall 21 of the container 105a<br><br>
towards the metallic electrode face EF1. The plate 14 has a pattern of gas pipe holes 25<br>
passing through it.<br>
The gas pipe openings 25 in the plate 14 continue preferably aligned, in openings 29<br>
through the dielectric plate array 27. The plate array 27 in this example-is made of a<br>
ceramic, e.g. Al2O3.<br>
 With the help of the generator 13, over the coupling face KF, a high frequency plasma<br>
discharge Hf is created in the processing chamber PR.<br>
From the metallic coupling face KF through the laminar distributed capacitance C plotted<br>
by dashed line in fig. 6, a specific pre-given potential distribution is realized as already<br>
mentioned on the dielectric electrode face EF2.<br>
The exciting frequency fHf is selected as follows:<br>
10MHz<fhf mhz></fhf>
preferably<br>
13 MHz<fhf mhz.></fhf>
The circumference diameter of the substrate 104 is at least 0.5 m and could very well go<br>
up to 5 m or more.<br>
The distance d in this design as shown in fig. 6 jumps from 0 to 1 mm.<br>
As already mentioned, on the basis of extension variants of the plant as per the invention<br>
to be explained later, the chamber 10 is not designed with a distance d jumping from 0 to<br>
a constant value, but the mentioned distance is optimally designed with a defined<br>
distribution, which also defines the decisive capacitance distribution. This distance d is<br>
selected frequency-dependent between 0.05 mm and 50 mm, so that no plasma can occur<br>
in the chamber 10.<br>
With the help of the generator 13 a power of 10 to 5000 W/m2 is fed per substrate face.<br><br>
For PHfECVD-coating of the substrate 104, as reactive gas preferably at least one of the<br>
following is used: NH3, N2, SF6, CF4, Cl2,O2, F2, CH4, silane, H2, phosphine, diboran,<br>
trimethylbor.<br>
The entire gas flow through the system 15, 17, and finally out of the openings 29 lies for<br>
example between 0.05 and 10 slm/m2 per m2 of substrate face.<br>
The above given magnitude hold good especially for reactive high frequency plasma-<br>
aided coating.<br>
For the following experiments the following settings were made:<br>
Process: PHfECVD-coating<br>
fHf: 27 MHz<br>
Substrate dimension: 1.1 x 1.25 m2<br>
In-shape depth d according to fig. 6: 1 mm<br>
Total pressure: 0.22 mbar<br>
Power per substrate face: 280 W/m2<br>
Substrate material: Float glass, with specific conductivity: 10-15 (Ωm)-1<br>
Pre-applied coating: InO2, doped with tin.<br>
Surface resistance of the coating Rs: 3 Ω□<br>
Reactive gas: silane with mixture of H2<br>
Dilution of silane in H2: 50%<br>
Total gas flow per surface unit: 0.75 slm/m2.<br>
The experiments were done on the plant configurations as shown in fig. 6 or 7.<br>
In fig. 8, as reference result, the resulting layer thickness distribution measured in<br>
nanometers with respect to the layer thickness average value over both rectangular<br>
diagonals of the work piece is depicted, when in the array shown in fig.6 the plate 14<br><br>
without in-shape 10 with a flat metallic face is directly used as electrode face lying<br>
opposite to electrode face EF1.<br>
In fig. 9, also as reference, there is an analogous depiction as in fig. 8 that shows the<br>
result, when on one side, as work piece to be coated, an uncoated dielectric substrate 100<br>
is inserted, namely a float glass substrate as shown in fig. 5.<br>
As already shown for the measurement as in fig. 8, the plate 14 is designed without in-<br>
shape 10 and forms one of the electrodes in the processing chamber PR. On the other<br>
hand, an in-shape corresponding to the in-shape 10 is foreseen on the base surface 3<br>
below the substrate.<br>
In a further analogous depiction and also as reference, fig. 10 shows the result, when on<br>
the plant configuration as already used for the results shown in fig. 9, i.e. with the in-<br>
shape 10 in the base surface 3, covered by the substrate and forming of the second<br>
electrode face through the flat surface of the plate 14 subjected to the processing chamber<br>
PR, the pre-coated substrate 104 is treated, namely the float glass substrate pre-coated<br>
with InO2.<br>
From that we thereby obtained the following:<br>
From fig. 8: that on account of the non-homogeneous field distribution in the<br>
processing chamber PR, the resulting coating thickness distribution is<br>
unacceptably non-homogeneous.<br>
-	From fig. 9: that when the substrate to be treated is purely dielectric, the in-shape<br>
on the work piece bearing electrode (3) leads to a significant improvement of the<br>
field distribution homogeneity and hence to layer thickness distribution<br>
homogeneity.<br>
-	From fig. 10: that the array that leads to a significant improvement of the layer<br>
thickness distribution for a purely dielectric work piece as in fig. 9, only when the<br>
work piece is made of a pre-coated substrate 104 according to the invention, and<br>
leads to a not acceptable layer thickness distribution.<br><br>
If however, according to the invention, the mentioned pre-coated substrate for example<br>
with the plant shown in fig. 6 is coated then one obtains good layer thickness distribution<br>
as shown in fig. 11.<br>
It is apparent that astonishingly in spite of the high specific resistance p of the layer<br>
material (InO2) only the suggested procedure according to the invention is suitable for<br>
achieving homogeneous effective distribution on the work piece. In fig. 8, further<br>
simplified and schematized, another preferred design form of the treatment step<br>
according to the invention or the plant 105 used for it as per fig. 5, is depicted.<br>
The pre-coated substrate 104 is again deposited on a flat first electrode face EF1. The<br>
metallic coupling face KF connected to the high frequency generator 13 is constantly<br>
shaped-in concave with respect to the processing chamber PR.<br>
The dielectric plate array 27 forms, on the one hand, the flat dielectric electrode face EF2<br>
and of constant thickness and also similarly flat back side ER. Fig. 12 does not show the<br>
opening pattern through the dielectric plate array 27. The dielectric plate array 27 has a<br>
thickness D, for which the following holds good:<br>
0.01 mm 
Definition<br>
In the context of this invention, by the term dielectric plate array we understand a laminar<br>
two-dimensional stretching dielectric form presenting itself as either foil type or right up<br>
to plate type.<br>
As the capacitance of the dielectric plate array 27 presents itself in series to the<br>
capacitance between coupling face KF and back side ER of the dielectric plate, the<br>
eventual large plate capacitance generated in case of thin dielectric plate array 27 would<br>
only have an insignificant influence on the small capacitance generated over the chamber<br>
10a.<br><br>
Fig. 13 shows a cut-out of the array as per fig. 12, the way it is encircled at A. From that<br>
it is apparent that at least a part of the holes 25 through the metal plate 14a can align with<br>
the openings 29 (not shown) through the dielectric plate array 27 for the design form<br>
shown in fig. 12 as well as for all other design form as per the invention, and furthermore<br>
these have at least almost the same opening cross-sections.<br>
Although the coupling face KF in fig. 12 is always bent, it is easily possible to realize it<br>
by shaping in one step or in several steps. As material of the plate array 27 that is<br>
subjected to a high temperature load, an aggressive chemical atmosphere, high vacuum<br>
and plasma, as already mentioned, one can use a ceramic, e.g. Al2O3. Depending on the<br>
process, if required also other dielectric materials can be used, right up to high<br>
temperature resistant dielectric foils with the opening pattern.<br>
As shown in fig. 14, the mentioned dielectric plate array 27 can be replaced by several<br>
plate arrays 27a and 27b lying distanced above one another, which are mutually<br>
positioned by dielectric distance holders. All these individual plates 27a, 27b have the<br>
opening pattern analogous to the pattern of the openings 29 as shown in fig. 6 or 12 and<br>
13. Their thickness can again be selected between 0.01 and 5 mm.<br>
Fig. 15 (a) to (f) show schematically possible mutual allocations of metallic coupling face<br>
KF and dielectric electrode face EF2, all of which leads to the fact that in the processing<br>
chamber PR, in the peripheral region, the electrical field gets strengthen with respect to<br>
the field in the central region.<br>
In fig. 15 (a) the metallic coupling face KF is flat. The dielectric plate array 27 is, with<br>
respect to the processing chamber PR, convex and of constant thickness V. On account<br>
of its metallic properties the coupling face KF with application of high frequency<br>
potential works as equi-potential face with ΦKF. In first approximation the array shown in<br>
fig. 15 (a) can be considered as follows:<br><br>
On each volume element dV along the chamber 10 there occur a series connection of a<br>
capacitance C10 and C27 as shown in the left side of the figure. While the capacitance C10<br>
is defined by the varying distance between coupling face KF and back side ER of the<br>
dielectric plate array 27 as well as the dielectric constant of the gas in the chamber 10, the<br>
capacitance C27 is locally constant on account of the constant thickness V and the<br>
dielectric constant s of the plate array 27.<br>
"Usually the dielectric constant of the plate material is significantly greater than that of the<br>
gas in the chamber 10, whereby particularly for thin plate array 27 the capacitance C27 in<br>
series connection with C10 is negligible at least in first approximation. In the peripheral<br>
region of the dielectric electrode face EF2, C10 always becomes greater on account of the<br>
reducing distance d, whereby locally the potential distribution ϕEF2 along the electrode<br>
face EF2 while approaching the peripheral region also approaches the potential ΦKF of the<br>
coupling face KF. Thus above the processing chamber PR, in the peripheral region of the<br>
electrode face EF2 lies the almost total potential difference between ΦKF and the potential<br>
applied on the opposite electrode face EF2. In the centre region of the electrode face EF2,<br>
on account of the greater distance d C10 is lesser than in the peripheral region, whereby a<br>
greater high frequency voltage drops and thus the potential there ΦEF2 increasingly drops<br>
with respect to the potential ΦKF. Thus, above the processing chamber PR in this centre<br>
region there is a reduced electrical field as compared to the peripheral region.<br>
From the observation from fig. 15 (a) and taking into account that the chamber 10 is like<br>
a pressure compensation chamber for the reactive gas fed to the processing chamber PR<br>
from the opening pattern (not shown) through the dielectric plate array 27, it is apparent<br>
that by using a foil-type high temperature resistant plat array 27 the convex shape can be<br>
created on account of the pressure difference between processing chamber and chamber<br>
10.<br>
In fig. 15 (b) the metallic coupling face KF continues to be flat. The dielectric plate array<br>
27 has a convex shaped back side ER with respect to the processing chamber PR,<br>
however a flat electrode face EF2 parallel to the coupling face KF. On account of the<br><br>
usually higher dielectric constants ε of the material of the dielectric plate array 27, the<br>
capacitance C27 influences the capacitance C10 (see fig. 15 (a)) in the peripheral region<br>
only marginally in spite of increased thickness of the array 27, so that even in the design<br>
form as shown in fig. 15 (b) the locally varying capacitance C10 in series connection<br>
dominates and, as explained, the field distribution in the processing chamber PR got<br>
dominantly influenced.<br>
In the design form as shown in fig. 15 (c) the coupling face KF continues to be flat. The<br>
dielectric plate array 27 has a constant thickness, however it is formed by section-wise<br>
different materials with different dielectric constants sa to sd. Here one can do away<br>
with the chamber 10.<br>
Towards the periphery the dielectric constant ε of the plate material increases, whereby<br>
C27 increases with view on the substitute diagram in fig. 15 (a). In this design form the<br>
capacitance C10 formed through the chamber 10 is locally constant. If the constant<br>
thickness of the dielectric plate array 27 is selected sufficiently high, then the capacitance<br>
C27 in series connection with C10 getting bigger towards the peripheral region becomes<br>
dominant and one achieves the already described effect: in the edge region of the<br>
electrode face EF2 the electrical field in the processing chamber PR gets less weakened<br>
than in the central region, where C27 with εd is reduced with respect to C27 with εa.<br>
Fig. 15 (d) shows the already explained conditions according to fig. 6 or fig. 12.<br>
Fig. 15 (e) shows a flat coupling face KF. The dielectric plate 27 has a flat back side E<br>
parallel to the coupling face KF, however considered from the processing chamber PR it<br>
has a convex dielectric electrode face EF2. From the explanations given so far the expert<br>
can easily comprehend that in this way one can achieve the same field compensation<br>
effect in the processing chamber PR, as described so far, after giving the selected plate<br>
thickness and plate material dielectric constants.<br><br>
In fig. 15 (f) the coupling face KF as well as the electrode face EF2 is concave with<br>
respect to the processing chamber PR, however the back side ER of the plate array 27 is<br>
flat.<br>
If the dielectric constant of the plate array 27 is significantly greater than that of the gas<br>
in chamber 10, then here also C10 dominates and gives the desired field distribution in the<br>
processing chamber PR.<br>
From the fig. 15 (a) to (f) it is apparent that particular with respect to the shape of the<br>
dielectric electrode face EF2 there is high flexibility. The variants shown in fig. 15 can be<br>
further extended and combined, as the expert can easily comprehend, e.g. providing<br>
different materials on the plate array 27 combined with varying thickness etc., which<br>
increases the scope of design even further. As already mentioned one can dispense with<br>
the chamber 10 and realise the capacitance distribution exclusively through the plate<br>
array 27.<br>
If one considers that the reactive gas from the chamber 10 is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber through the opening pattern provided on the plate array 27 and<br>
further that the desired field compensation measures can be largely realized independent<br>
of the shape of the electrode face EF2 then it becomes apparent that simultaneously gas<br>
jetting direction into the processing chamber PR as well as field influence in the<br>
processing chamber PR can be optimized.<br>
While realizing the dielectric plate array 27 it should be taken into account that it is<br>
subjected to particularly high temperatures during the treatment process. Thus thermal<br>
expansion differences between dielectric plate array 27 and, through its fixation, the plate<br>
14 forming the coupling face KF should be taken into account. It must also be kept in<br>
mind that with the described plant large and even very large substrates 104 are supposed<br>
to be treated. Realization of a dielectric plate array of this dimension and its assembly, so<br>
that in any case thermal expansions and contractions can be absorbed without<br>
deformation, poses problems if the array 27 is not foil-type but in the form of a solid<br>
dielectric plate, e.g. of ceramic like A12O3.<br><br>
In another design form preferred in this case, the fixed array 27 to be explained in fig. 16<br>
is composed of several dielectrics, preferably ceramic tiles. Fig. 16 shows in top view<br>
and in cross-section such a tile and its mounting. The respective tile 50, preferably<br>
rectangular or square as shown, and made of a ceramic material like Al2O3 is centrally<br>
positioned with respect to the coupling face KF on the plate 104 with the help of a<br>
dielectric shim 54. Thus the relevant distance between the face KF and back side ER of<br>
the tiles 50 forming the plate array 27 is ensured. So that the tiles 50 are peripherally<br>
supported and with thermal load can still freely expand on all sides without stress, they<br>
are guided on support pins 56 with respect to the coupling face KF. The tiles 50 are<br>
secured against twisting by means of a guide pin 58 in an oblong channel 59. The tiles<br>
50 are provided with the opening pattern (not shown in fig. 16) that if required is<br>
supplemented with crevices between the tiles 50. The tiles 50 could also overlap. One or<br>
more positions of such tiles can be foreseen, locally varying if required, and in different<br>
regions different ceramic materials with different dielectric constants can be used. In this<br>
way flexible, different shapes and material profiles can be realized in the dielectric plate<br>
array 27.<br>
Fig. 17 (a) to (f) schematically show the configurations as shown in fig. 15 (a) to (f),<br>
structured with tiles as explained in fig. 16. In this case only the tiles lying directly<br>
opposite to the coupling face KF have to be supported as shown in fig. 17; subsequent tile<br>
positions on the processing chamber side are mounted on the tiles lying below it. By<br>
looking at fig. 17 (a) to (f) the expert can easily understand how the mentioned tiles<br>
structure can be mounted in the configurations as shown in fig. 15 (a) to (f). In doing so,<br>
in the sense of the already mentioned opening pattern, a gas jetting into the processing<br>
chamber distributed to the desired extent has to be ensured, whether it is by utilizing the<br>
labyrinth channels remaining between the tiles and/or by providing additional holes or<br>
openings through the tiles 50 (not shown). The thickness of the ceramic tile DK should<br>
ideally be selected as<br><br><br>
With the production method as per the invention or the plant used as per the invention<br>
one can homogeneously coat large or even very large dielectric substrates first with<br>
special conductive layers and then surface-treat or coat by means of reactive, high<br>
frequency plasma aided methods, whereby particularly large to very large solar cells can<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "METHOD FOR PRODUCING A DISK-SHAPED WORK PIECE ON<br>
THE BASE OF A DIELECTRIC SUBSTRATE"<br>
Method for producing a disk-shaped work piece on the base of a dielectric substrate<br>
(100), which comprises treatment in a plasma processing chamber (PR) that is formed<br>
between two opposite electrode faces (2a;EF1, 2b;EF2) in a vacuum recipient, whereby<br>
an electrical high frequency field is generated between the electrode faces and thus in<br>
the processing chamber (PR) fed with a reactive gas a high frequency plasma discharge<br>
is created; one electrode face (2b, EF2) is made of dielectric material and to this a high<br>
frequency potential (Ø2b) with pre-given, varying distribution is applied along the face<br>
and the distribution of the electrical field in the plasma processing chamber (PR) is<br>
adjusted by the potential distribution (Ø2b) on the dielectric electrode face (2b, EF2),<br>
thereby the dielectric electrode face (2b, EF2) is formed with the substrate or the<br>
substrate is arranged on the metallically designed other (2a, EF1) electrode face, and<br>
further on the electrode face lying opposite to the substrate the reactive gas is<br>
introduced into the processing chamber (PR) from an opening (29), wherein the<br>
dielectric substrate (100) before treatment in the plasma processing chamber is coated<br>
at least section-wise with a coating material having a p for which there is valid:<br><br>
said coating being so that the resulting surface resistance Rs of said coating is:<br><br>
depositing said coated substrate on said metallic electrode surface (2a, EF1);<br>
establishing between said electrode surfaces an electric Rf field; inletting into said<br>
plasma processing chamber (PR) through a multitude of openings (29) in said one<br>
electrode surface, a reactive gas; establishing a locally varying electrical Rf potential<br>
along said one electrode surface; thereby etching or coating said substrate (100).</td>
