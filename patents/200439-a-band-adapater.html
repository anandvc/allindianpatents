				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to a band adapter for a front derailleur of a bicycle. More specifically, the present invention relates band adapter for a front derailleur of a bicycle that allows the front derailleur to be used with different sizes of bicycle frames.<br>
2.	Background Information<br>
Bicycling is becoming an increasingly more popular form of recreation as well as a means of transportation. Moreover, bicycling has'become a very popular competitive sport for both amateurs and professionals. Whether the bicycle is used for recreation, transportation or competition, the bicycle industry is constantly improving the various components of the bicycle. One part of the bicycle that has been extensively redesigned is the frame of the bicycle. In fact, each bicycle manufacturer may have several different frame designs. This presents a problem for many bicycle component manufacturers as well as for bicycle shops that carry a full line of bicycle components.<br>
One component that is mounted to the bicycle frame is the front derailleur. Generally speaking, the front derailleur is typically secured to the seat tube of the bicycle frame. Basically, the front derailleur includes a fixed member nonmovably secured to the seat tube of the bicycle frame, and a movable section supported to be movable relative to the fixed member. The movable section supports a chain guide having a pair of vertical surfaces for contacting a chain.<br>
The fixed member of the front derailleur is typically a tubular clamping member that encircles the seat tube of the bicycle such that the chain guide is located above the front sprockets. Since bicycle frames have a wide variety of configurations with different diameters of seat tubes, this has required bicycle component manufacturers to supply a different front derailleur for each manufacturer's frame. More specifically, the tubular clamping member of each of the front derailleurs must be made with a size according to the customer's seat tubed diameter. Typically, seat tube diameters come in three sizes. The large size diameter of seat tube is<br><br>
approximately 34.9 millimeters. The medium size seat tube diameter is typically approximately 31.8 millimeters. The small sized seat tube diameter is typically approximately 28.6 millimeters in diameter. This has created the problem of manufacturing, stocking and controlling inventory for at least three different kinds of front derailleur to meet the various requirements of the bicycle frame manufacturers. Moreover, in bicycle shops that supply parts, the shop has to keep all front derailleurs as replacement parts so that the dealer can sell a front derailleur for any bike with-any different tube diameter.<br>
One product that has been developed to overcome this problem is an aluminum band adapter that can be used with a front derailleur in order to allow it to be used for different tube diameters. One problem with this prior art band adapter is that it is difficult to install. In particular, the band adapter must be held on the front derailleur during assembly. This is very inconvenient when assembly a large number of front derailleurs on bicycles.<br>
In view of the above, there exists a need for a band adapter for a front derailleur of a bicycle, which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a band adapter for a front derailleur of a bicycle that can be used with many different sizes of bicycle frames.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a band adapter that is easy to install on the bicycle when installing the front derailleur.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a band adapter that is lightweight.<br>
The foregoing objects can basically be attained by providing a band adapter for a tubular clamping member. The band adapter has an adapting member and a retaining member. The adapting member has an outer surface and a curved inner surface with a predetermined radius of curvature. The retaining member is coupled to the adapting member, and has a coupling member to fixedly secure the retaining member to the tubular clamping member.<br><br>
The foregoing objects can basically be attained by providing a front derailleur for a bicycle comprising a tubular clamping member, an adapter member, a band retaining member, a chain guide and a linkage assembly. The tubular clamping member is adapted to be coupled to a portion of the bicycle. The chain guide has a chain receiving slot to shift a chain of the bicycle in a transverse direction. The linkage assembly is coupled between the chain guide and the fixed member to move the chain guide between a retracted position and an extended position.<br>
The band adapter decreases the effective clamping diameter of a tubular clamping member. The adapting member having an outer surface and a curved inner surface with a predetermined radius of curvature. The retaining member is coupled to the adapting member. The retaining member has a coupling member to fixedly secure the retaining member to the tubular clamping member.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a band adapter for decreasing an effective clamping diameter of a tubular clamping member, comprising: an adapting member having an outer surface and a curved inner surface with a predetermined radius of curvature; and a retaining member coupled to said adapting member, said retaining member having a coupling member to fixedly secure said retaining member to the tubular clamping member.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring initially to Figures 1 and 2, a bicycle .10 is illustrated with a front derailleur 12 fixedly coupled to its seat tube 14 of its frame. The front derailleur 12 is operated by shifting unit 16 via a shift cable 18 to move chain 20 between the front sprockets 22 of the drive train. Front derailleur 12 in accordance with the present invention is designed to accommodate a wide variety of bicycle frames.<br>
Bicycles and their various components are well known in the art, and thus, bicycle 10 and its various components will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein except for the components that relate to the present invention. In other words,_ only front derailleur 12 and the components that relate thereto will be discussed and/or illustrated herein.<br>
As used herein, the terms "forward, rearward, upward, above, downward, below and transverse" refer to those directions of a bicycle in its normal riding position, which front derailleur 12 is attached. Accordingly, these terms, as utilized to describe the front derailleur 12 in the claims, should be interpreted relative to bicycle 10 in its normal riding position.<br>
—       Basically, front derailleur 12 includes a fixed or tubular clamping member 24, a chain guide 26 and a linkage assembly 28 coupled between mbular clamping member 24 and chain guide 26. Tubular clamping member 24 is provided with a band adapter 30 for decreasing its effective inner diameter so that front derailleur 12 can be installed on smaller size seat tubes. As best seen in Figures 2 and 5, tubular clamping member 24 is located beneath chain guide 26 and linkage assembly 28 such that chain guide 26 moves from a retracted (low gear) position to an extended (high gear) position.<br><br>
As seen in Figure 5, linkage assembly 28 is preferably designed such that biasing member (torsion spring) 43 normally biases chain guide 26 in a transverse direction towards the frame of bicycle 10. In other words, when chain guide 26 is closest to the frame of bicycle 10, chain guide 26 holds chain 20 over the sprocket 22 that is closest to seat tube 14.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2 together, when linkage assembly 28 holds chain guide 26 in its extended position, chain guide 26 is located over the outermost sprocket 22, i.e., the furthest sprocket 22 from seat tube 14. These movements of chain guide 26 and linkage assembly 28 are controlled by shifting unit 16. Specifically, when the rider squeezes the lever of shifting unit 16, this pulls shift cable 18 to move chain guide 26 between its extended position and its retracted position via linkage assembly 28. Shifting unit 16 can be a variety of types of shifting units. Therefore, the precise structure of shifting unit 16 will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.<br>
As best seen in Figures 3-5, tubular clamping member 24 is preferably clamped directly to the seat tube 14. Tubular clamping member 24 basically includes a first C-shaped clamping portion 44, a second C-shaped clamping portion 45, a pivoj pin 46 and a fastener 47. First and second clamping portions 44 and 45 are constructed of a rigid material to secure front derailleur 12 to seat tube 14 of bicycle 10. Preferably, clamping portions 44 and 45 are constructed of metal. Of course, clamping portions 44 and 45 could be constructed of other materials such as a hard rigid plastic material. In the illustrated embodiment, the clamping portions 44 and 45 are constructed by utilizing conventional manufacturing techniques such as casting or machining. Of course, clamping portions 44 and 45 can also be constructed from sheet metal.<br>
Still referring to Figures 4 and 5, band adapter 30 basically includes a first retainer 32a, a second retainer 32b and a pair of identical adapters 33. First retainer 32a is adapted to clip on to first clamping portion 44 of tubular clamping member 24, while second retainer 32b is adapted to be clipped on to second clamping portion 45 of tubular clamping member 24. Basically, first and second retainers 32a and 32b are C-shaped members that together form a band retaining member, while the two<br><br>
adapters 33 together form an adapting member that is coupled to the band retaining member to decrease the effective inner diameter of tubular clamping member 24.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, first and second retainers 32a and 32b are constructed of a non-metallic material such as a hard, resilient resin material or plastic. Adapters 33, on the other hand, are constructed of a metallic material. Preferably, adapters 33 are constructed from aluminum. Accordingly, this arrangement of non-metallic and metallic materials create an adapter that is lightweight and easily installed on the tubular planting member 24, while containing an effective clamping force on the seat tube 14 of bicycle 10. The adapters 33 can have either a smooth surface or a rough surface formed by sand blasting or the like.<br>
As best seen in Figures 6-12, first retainer 32a is a seat C-shaped member having an upper curved portion 34a, a lower curved portion 35a and a pair of connecting portions 36a extending between upper curved portion 34a and lower curved portion 35a. These portions 34a-36a define an opening or recess for receiving one of the adapters 33 therein. Preferably, this opening or recess is sized to retain one of the adapters 33 therein, as discussed below.<br>
As best seen in Figures 6,11 and 12, upper curved portion 34a has an L-shaped cross-section along most of its length for resting on the top of clamping portion 44. Upper curved portion 34a is provided with a substantially centrally located retaining abutment (detent) or hook 37a. Retaining abutment or hook 37a is adapted to be clipped on to the top of clamping portion 44 of tubular clamping member 24. In other words, a curved space is formed on the upper curved portion 34a for receiving a part of clamping portion 44 therein. Preferably, first retainer 32a is constructed of a material that can be elasticaliy deformed to clip first retainer 32a onto   clamping portion 44 of tubular clamping member 24. Upper curved portion 34a is also provided with an abutment (detent) or tab 38a for engaging adapter 33 to limit outward movement of adapter 33 relative to first retainer 32a.<br>
Lower curved portion 35a is similar to upper curved portion 34. Lower curved portion 35a is clipped onto the bottom of clamping portion 44 of tubular clamping member 24. Lower curved portion 35a includes a retaining abutment (detent) or hook 39a for engaging and coupling clamping portion 44 of tubular clamping member 24 thereto. The lower curved portion 35a also has annther abutment (detent) or tab 40a<br><br>
that engages the bottom of adapter 33 to limit the outward movement of adapter 33 relative to first retainer 32a.<br>
The retaining abutments 37a and 39a form a coupling member that is designed to snap-fit onto the upper and bottom parts of clamping portion 24. More specifically, first retainer 32a is elastically deformed by the coupling of first retainer 32a onto clamping portion 44. Since retaining abutments or hooks 37a and 39a are relatively small, the amount of resiliency or elastic deformation of first retainer 32a does not-have to be very large. In other words, first retainer 32a can be constructed of a relatively rigid material with a limited amount of resiliency or flexibility. The retaining abutments 37a and 39a are vertically opposed to each other on their respective portions 34a and 35a.<br>
Likewise, tabs 38a and 40a are also vertically opposed to one another. Tabs 38a and 40a form a coupling member that is designed to snap-fit onto the upper and bottom parts of adapter 33. More specifically, first retainer 32a is elastically deformed by the coupling one of the adapters 33 onto first retainer 32a. Accordingly, adapter 33 is fixedly secured to first retainer 32a, and first retainer 32a is fixedly secured to clamping member 24.<br>
As best seen in Figures 13-18, second retainer 32b is a seat C-shaped member having an upper curved portion 34b, a lower curved portion 35b and a pair of connecting portions 36b extending between upper curved portion 34b and lower curved portion 35b. These portions 34b-36b define an opening or recess for receiving one of the adapters 33 therein. Preferably, this opening or recess is sized to retain one of the adapters 33 therein.<br>
As best seen in Figures 17 and 18, the upper curved portion 34b has an L-' shaped cross-section along most of its length for resting on the top of clamping portion 45. Upper curved portion 34b is provided with a substantially centrally located retaining abutment (detent) or hook 37b as seen in Figure 17. Retaining abutment or hook 37b is adapted to be clipped on to the top of clamping portion 45 of tubular clamping member 24. In other words, a curved space is formed on the upper curved portion 34b for receiving a part of clamping portion 45 therein. Preferably, second retainer 32b is constructed of a material that can be elastically deformed to clip second retainer 32b onto clamping portion 45 of tubular clamping member 24.<br><br>
upper curved portion 34b is also provided with an abutment (detent) or tab 38b for engaging adapter 33 to limit outward movement of adapter 33 relative to second retainer 32b as best seen in Figure 18.<br>
Lower curved portion 35b is similar to upper curved portion 34b. Lower curved portion 35b is clipped onto the bottom of clamping portion 45 of tubular clamping member 24. As seen in Figure 17, lower curved portion 35b includes a retaining abutment (detent) or hook 39b for engaging and coupling clamping portion . 45 of tubular clamping member 24 thereto. As seen in Figure 18, the lower curved portion 35b also has another abutment (detent) or tab 40b that engages the bottom of adapter 33 to limit the outward movement of adapter 33 relative to second retainer 32b.<br>
The retaining abutment 37b and 39b form a coupling member that is designed to snap-fit onto the upper and bottom parts of clamping portion 24. More specifically, second retainer 32b is elastically deformed by the coupling of second retainer 32b onto clamping portion 45. Since retaining abutments or hooks 37b and 39b are relatively small, the amount of resiliency or elastic deformation of second retainer 32b does not have to be very large. In other words, second retainer 32b can be constructed of a relatively rigid material with a limited amount of resiliency or flexibility. The retaining abutments 37b and 39b are vertically opposed to each other on their respective portions 34b and 35b.<br>
Likewise, tabs 38b and 40b are also vertically opposed to one another. Tabs 38b and 40b form a coupling member that is designed to snap-fit onto the upper and bottom parts of adapter 33. More specifically, second retainer 32b is elastically deformed by the coupling one of the adapters 33 onto second retainer 32b. Aecordingly, adapter 33 is fixedly secured to second retainer 32b, and second retainer 32b is in turn fixedly secured to clamping member 24.<br>
As best seen in Figures 19-21, adapters 33 are curved or arc-shaped members having a curved inner surface that is designed to engage the seat tube 14 of frame 10. In the first embodiment, adapters 33 have a substantially constant thickness. The thickness of adapters 33 range from approximately 1.5 millimeters to 3.2 millimeters depending upon the frame size. In the case of a seat tube 14 having a diameter of approximately 34,9 millimeters, band adapter 30 would not be utilized. In the case of<br><br>
a medium sized seat tube 14 having a diameter of approximately 31.8 millimeters, the thickness of adapter 33 should be approximately 1.55 millimeters in thickness. In the case of a small size seat tube 14 having a diameter of approximately 28.6 millimeters, the adapters 33 should have a thickness of approximately 3.15 millimeters.<br>
Adapters 33 have a pair of centrally located notches 41 that receive tabs 38a and 40a of the first retainer 32a or receive tabs 38b and 40b of the second retainer 32b. Adapters 33 are secured within the openings of first and second retainers 32a... and 32b by a snap-fit, as discussed above. Preferably, adapters 33 are the same size as the openings in first and second retainers 32a and 32b.<br>
First ends of clamping portions 44 and 45 are pivotally coupled together by pivot pin 46, which extends in a substantially vertical direction relative to bicycle 10. The other ends of clamping portions 44 and 45 are releasably connected together via fastener 47. Fastener 47 is preferably a screw or bolt that is threaded into a threaded hole of first clamping portion 44. Of course, fastener 47 can be utilized in conjunction with a nut, or the like.<br>
As best seen in Figures 4 and 5, second clamping portion 45 includes portions of linkage assembly 28. In other words, portions of linkage assembly 28 are integrally formed with second clamping portion 45, as explained below.<br>
The second clamping portion 45 has a pair of substantially parallel mounting flanges 50 and 52 that extend in substantially vertical directions. Mounting flanges 50 and 52 each have a pivot hole 53 and 54 that receive pivot pins 55a and 55b for mounting a portion of linkage assembly 28 thereto, as explained below. Mounting flange 50 also has a second pivot hole 56 for receiving pivot pin 57 therein to couple another portion of linkage assembly 28 thereto. As explained below in more detail, -•flange 50 forms one of the links of linkage assembly 28. Accordingly, flange 50 is a non-movable link.<br>
Referring to Figures 3-5, chain guide 26 is preferably constructed of a hard rigid material. For example, chain guide 26 is preferably constructed of metal such as a rigid sheet metal that is bent to the desired shape. Chain guide 26 has a chain receiving slot 60 formed by a pair of vertical shift: plates 61 and 62 that are adapted to engage chain 20 for moving chain 20 in a direction transverse to bicycle 10. Shift plates 61 and 62 are connected together by plates 63 and 64. Plate 63 is integrally<br><br>
formed between shift plates 61 and 62. Plate 64 has one end that is integrally formed with shift plate 62 and another end that is detachably coupled to shift plate 61 via screw 65.<br>
As best seen in Figure 5, chain guide 26 also has a pair of mounting flanges 66 and 67 extending in a substantially horizontal direction from shift plate 61 for coupling linkage assembly 28 thereto. Mounting flange 66 forms one of the links of linkage assembly 28. More specifically, mounting flange 66 has a substantially horizontal section 68 and a substantially vertical section 69. Horizontal section 68 has a pair of threaded holes 70 and 71 for receiving adjustment screws 72 and 73 thereto. Adjustment screw 72 is a low position adjustment screw, while adjustment screw 73 is a high position adjustment screw. Adjustment screws 72 and 73 engage a portion of linkage assembly 28 as discussed below for controlling the range of movement of chain guide 26. In other words, by individually adjusting the axial extension of adjustment screws 72 and 73 relative to horizontal section 68, the retracted (low gear) position and the extended (high gear) position of chain guide 26 are adjusted independently of each other.<br>
A top cover 74 is provided to overlie mounting flanges 66 and 67. Top cover 74 is preferably a non-metallic or plastic member that has a pair of bores 75 and 76. The bores 75 and 76 are initially formed with diameters that are slightly smaller than the thread diameters of adjustment screws 72 and 73. Accordingly, when adjustment screws 72 and 73 are threaded through bores 75 and 76, the non-metallic material is cut or tapped to form internal, threads. This creates a friction fit between top cover 74 and adjustment screws 72 and 73. Accordingly, adjustment screws 72 and 73 will typically not move in an axial direction due to vibrations because of this frictional force between top cover 74 and adjustment screws 72 and 73, unless the screws 72 and 73 are manually adjusted by a person.<br>
Vertical section 69 of mounting flange 66 forms one of the links of the linkage assembly 28. Mounting flange 66 has a pair of pivot holes 77 and 78 for pivotally mounting a pair of links of linkage assembly 28 thereto, as discussed below. Mounting flange 67 has a pivot hole 79 that is aligned with pivot hole 78 of vertical section 69 for pivotally coupling a link of linkage assembly 28 therebetween.<br><br>
Linkage assembly 28 is preferably a four-bar linkage assembly having a first link 81, a second link (vertical section) 69, a third link (mounting flange) 50 and a fourth link 82. First link 81 has its pivot points lying on a line which is substantially parallel to a line that passes through the pivot points of fourth link 82. Similarly, second link (vertical section) 69 has its pivot points lying on a line which is substantially parallel to a line passing through the pivot points of third link (mounting flange) 50.<br>
First link 81 includes a cable attachment member 84 for couple the shift cable 18 thereto. First link 81 is pivotally coupled at one end to second link or vertical section 69 by pivot pin 86. The other end of first link 81 is pivotally coupled to third link or flange 50 of tubular clamping member 24 via pivot pin 57. Accordingly, first link 81 has a pair of spaced pivot holes 88 for receiving pivot pins 86 and 57 therein. First link 81 is preferably secured on pivot pins 86 and 87 by snap-on retaining washers 90. More specifically, pivot pins 86 and 87 each have a groove 92 for receiving retaining washers 90 thereon.<br>
Cable attachment member 84 has a wire clamp 94, a bolt 95 and a nut 96 for attaching the inner wire of cable 18 thereto.<br>
Fourth link 82 is pivotally mounted to second link or vertical section 69 of chain guide 26 via pivot pins 104a and 104b. Specifically, pivot pins 104a and 104b are received in pivot holes 78 and 79 of flanges 66 and 67 of chain guide 26. The other end of fourth link 82 is pivotally mounted on pivot pin 55 of third link or mounting flange 50. The upper end of fourth link 82 is provided with a fan-shaped member 105 that engages adjustment screws 72 and 73 for limiting movement of chain guide 26 between its retracted position and its extended position. More   specifically, fan member 105 is provided with a low stopping surface 106 and a high stopping surface 107 as best seen in Figures 5 and 6. Low stopping surface 106 is designed to engage the free end of low adjustment screw 72, while high stopping surface 107 is positioned to engage the high adjustment screw 73. Since this is a relatively conventional adjustment mechanism that is well known in the prior art, this adjustment mechanism will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.<br>
Biasing member 43 is preferably a coil spring that has its coiled portion mounted on pivot pin 57 with a first end engaging a part of mounting flanges 50 and a<br><br>
second end engaging a part of first link 81 for normally biasing chain guide 26 from its extended position to its retracted position. In other words, biasing member or coil spring 43 is a torsion spring that normally urges the cable guide 26 from its extended position to its retracted position. Of course, movement of chain guide 26 is controlled by shifting unit 16 moving cable 18 in a relatively conventional manner. SECOND EMBODIMENT OF ADAPTERS<br>
Referring now to Figures 22 and 23, a modified adapter 133 is illustrated in... accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. Basically, adapter 133 is identical to adapter 33 of the first embodiment, except that a pair of longitudinally extending openings 134 are formed therein with a bridge member 135 bisecting adapter 133 to form a pair of equally sized openings 134. Adapter 133 is designed to be utilized with first and second retainers 32a and 32b in substantially the same manner as adapter 33. Therefore, adapter 133 will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.<br>
THIRD EMBODIMENT OF RETAINERS<br>
Referring now to Figures 24 and 25, a retainer 233 is illustrated in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention. Retainer 233 is substantially identical to retainer 133 of the second embodiment, except that the bridge 135 has been removed from this embodiment such that a single large longitudinally extending opening 234 is formed therein. Similar to the second embodiment, adapter 233 is designed to be utilized with either retainers 32a or 32b of the first embodiment. Therefore, retainer 233 will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.<br>
