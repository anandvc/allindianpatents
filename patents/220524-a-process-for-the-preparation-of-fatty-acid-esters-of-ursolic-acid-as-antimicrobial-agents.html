				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fatty acid esters of ursolic acid as antimicrobial agents.<br>
The long chain fatty acid esters of ursolic acid obtained in the present process were found to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity in vitro against the gram - ve bacteria Pseudomonas syringae ( ATCC # 13457) and the gram + ve bacteria Bacillus sphaericus ( ATCC # 14577 ) and Bacillus subtilis ( ATCC # 6051 )<br>
Reference may be made to Collins et.al. ( M.A. Collins and H. P. Charles, Food Microbiol., 1987, 4(4), 311) wherein ursolic acid isolated as one of the anti- oxidant constituents of Rosemary, was tested against the growth of some food associated bacteria. The drawbacks are : No significant activity is reported to ursolic acid.<br>
Reference may be made to Zaletova et. al. (N.I. Zaletova, A.N. Shchavlinskii, 0. N. Tolkachev, S. A. Vichkanova, T. V. Fateeva, N. M. Krutikova, I. V. Yartseva and N. A. Klyuev, Khim - Farm. Zh., 1986, 20(5), 568) wherein some 3 - keto and 11 - keto derivatives of ursolic acid were prepared and screened for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococous aureus. These compounds were found to be active only at 250 ug/ml concentrations. The drawbacks are : the concentrations of the test compounds are very high ( 250 ug/ml and above).<br>
The enhanced antimicrobial activity of ursolic acid can be achieved by preparing some of its lipophilic derivatives. The low acute toxicity of ursolic acid and<br>
structure activity studies, which suggest that the desired substituents on the<br>
lipophilic 5 - ring backbone can increase the selectivity and potency of a desired<br>
action, indicate that ursolic acid provide a rich source for natural lead compounds<br>
for drug development. The limiting parameter with ursolic acid is its low solubility.<br>
Ursolic acid has a hydroxyl at C3 position, a double bond between C12 and C13<br>
and a carboxylic acid group at C17. The C3 hydroxyl group can be exploited to<br>
make new members with enhanced lipophilic properties. Lipophilicity is an<br>
important parameter in drug development and it increases with the increase of<br>
the side carbon chain. Molecules with carbon chains above C10 are fairly<br>
lipophilic and good candidates for antimicrobial screening.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of long chain fatty acid esters of ursolic acid as potent antimicrobial<br>
agents which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilise the major metabolite<br>
obtained in one of our programmes on Diospyros melanoxylon (kendu) leaves<br>
i.e. ursolic acid, which is incidentally the starting material for the test compounds.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to make 'New Molecules' with<br>
enhanced   biological   activities   from   abundantly   available   inactive   natural<br>
products.<br>

The process for the preparation of long chain fatty acid esters of ursolic acid as<br>
potent antimicrobial agents comprises derivatisation of the C3 - hydroxyl<br>
function of ursolic acid (as shown in the drawing as fig.1) with long chain fatty<br>
acids such as lauric acid , myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid (as shown<br>
in the drawings as figs. 3a - 3d) in presence of mild base and a powerful<br>
dehydrating agent in a low boiling chlorinated solvent at room temperature under<br>
stirring and isolating the resulting products( as shown in the drawing as figs. 2a<br>
- 2d) by chromatographic separation and screening for antimicrobial activity in<br>
vitro against the gram -ve bacteria Pseudomonas syringae and gram +ve<br>
bacteria, Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus subtilis.<br>
The long chain fatty acid esters of ursolic acid as prepared by the process of<br>
present invention are synthesised and screened for antimicrobial activity for the<br>
first time.<br>
Accordingly,  the  present  present invention  relates to  a  process for the<br>
preparation of fatty acid esters of ursolic acid of formula 2 wherein R is alkyl<br>
group which comprises reacting ursolic acid of formula 1 with fatty acids of<br>
formula 3 as shown in the drawing wherein n is 10 to 16 carbons in presence of a<br>
mild organic base and a dehydrating agent in chlorinated solvent at room<br>
temperature under stirring for at least a period of 72 hrs., recovering the esters of<br>
ursolic acid and purifying the esters by conventional methods<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the mild base used may be<br>
such as pyridine, 4 - pyrrolidinopyridine, 4 - dimethylaminopyridine, 4 - diethyl-<br>
aminopyridine.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the dehydrating agent used<br>
may be such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, N,N' - carbonyldiimidazol, 1-cyclo-3-<br>
2-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimde.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the synthesised long chain<br>
fatty acid esters are found highly lipophilic and soluble in most of the organic<br>
solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the fatty acid esters of<br>
ursolic acid were found to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity in vitro against<br>
gram - ve bacteria Pseudomonas syringae and gram + ve bacteria Bacillus<br>
sphaericus and Bascillus subtilis.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the fatty acid esters of<br>
ursolic acid were found to be highly active than tetracycline and benzyl penicillin<br>
sodium against the gram - ve bacteria Pseudomonas syringae.<br>
In still another embodiment of the preset invention the fatty acid esters of ursolic acid were found to be highly active than benzyl penicillin sodium against the gram + ve bacteria Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus subtilis. The present invention describes the drivatisation of C3 hydroxyl group of ursolic acid with the long chain fatty acids (C10 - C-16) under mild esterification conditions comprising a base, a dehydrating agent and a low boiling chlorinated solvent. The base used is e.g. pyridine, 4 - pyrrolidinopyridine, 4 -dimethylaminopyridine, 4 - diethylaminopyridine. The dehydrating agent used is e.g. carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N,N' - cabonyldiimidazol, 1- cycle - 3 - (2 - morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide. The chlorinated solvent used is e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride.<br>
For several years ursolic acid has been thought of biologically inactive. Even though some interesting biologically activities have been attributed recently to ursolic acid, it could not come to limelight due to several limiting parameters like solubility and polarity. In the present invention we have demonstrated that some of the lipophilic derivatives of ursolic acid are more potent and exhibiting high antimicrobial activities than the parent acid. The most significant part of the present invention is that lipophilic ester chains have been synthesised in totally mild experimental conditions. Our method has got an advantage over the conventional methods for the preparation of esters in eliminating the intermediate acid chloride formation, which is very cumbersome.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
To ursolic acid (1g. 1eq.) in dichloromethane(15 ml.) was added lauric acid (0.438g,1eq.), dimethylaminopyridine (0.268g,1eq.) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.452g, 1eq.) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by TLC. As the reaction found incomplete, some more equivalents of lauric acid (0.438g, 1eq), dimethylaminopyridine (1.072g, 4eq) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.808g, 4eq) were added and stirring was continued. After the reaction is over, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue (4.48g.) was chromatographed over a column of silica gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (n-hexane, n-hexane - ethyl acetate : 98-2) and collected 250 ml fractions. Fractions (n-hexane - ethyl acetate : 98-2) showing single and identical spots on TLC were combined and evaporated to give ursolic acid laurate as a colourless oil (30%).<br>

As the reaction found incomplete, some more equivalents of myristic acid (0.499g,1eq.), dimethylaminopyridine (1.072g, 4eq) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.808g, 4eq) were added and stirring was continued. After the reaction is over, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue (4.48g.) was chromatographed over a column of silica gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (n-hexane, n-hexane - ethyl acetate : 98-2) and collected 250 ml fractions. Fractions (n-hexane - ethyl acetate : 98-2) showing single and identical spots on TLC were combined and evaporated to give ursolic acid myristate as a colourless oil (30%).<br>

The reaction was monitored by TLC. As the reaction found incomplete, some more equivalents of stearic acid (0.62g, 1eq), dimethylaminopyridine (1.072g, 4eq) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.808g, 4eq) were added and stirring was continued. After the reaction is over, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue (5.538g) was chromatographed over a column of silica gel and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (n-hexane, n-hexane - ethyl acetate : 98-2) and collected 250 ml fractions.
