				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for producing soft and fine jute fibres from raw jute suitable for application in value added products especially in the textile industry.<br>
Jute is a ligno-cellulosic and multicellular fibre with its quality usually strongly depending on growing, harvesting and retting conditions. It is coarse and harsh in feeling and thus mostly used by the packaging industries. The traditional processing of jute fibre is done by the century old machinery and these are becoming costlier in the international markets. Naturally attention is being paid to the diversified use of the jute fibre. In order to produce competitive products and to use multiple properties of jute fibre economically and ecologically, the development of the new processing methods is indispensable.<br>
In the past lot of work has been done to improve the properties of jute fibre through chemical and mechanical treatments, for use in the textile industries but a very little success was achieved because of the presence of the ligno-cellulosic materials in jute.<br>
Chemical treatment on jute for making the fibre finer and more pliable have been attempted in the art. In particular, dilute solution of Na2CO3 (0.5% to 0.75%) improved the processing condition but there was no improvement in the fibre fineness. Treatment of jute with the mercerising strength of NaOH at room temperature and in slacked condition showed impact on various properties like lustre, crimpiness, swelling, shrinkage and increased absorbency of the fibre. Resulting fibre is termed as woolenised jute and the process is popularly known as woolenisation of jute. In this process no substantial reaction takes place, only breakage of certain bonds occurs, so the cavities in the noncrystalline region of the fibre appear and the resultant fibre becomes homogeneous and crimpy. There is however, considerable amount of loss in weight and strength of the fibre which is dependent on the concentration of alkali, time of treatment and temperature. The improvement in fibre fineness does not generally take place in this process. There is partial conversion from cellulose I to cellulose II structure. <br>
The treatment with liquid ammonia is also known which lead to certain improvement in resilience and dye uptake. Complete conversion from cellulose I to cellulose III structure takes place but the fineness of the fibre does not change very much.<br>
Treatment of jute with chemical reagents used in textile applications showed lignin, hemicellulose and other encrusting substances were attacked and to some extent removed but the main multicellular structure remain unaltered in most cases. Naturally, the effect in fibre fineness was very low. The lignin, hemicellulose are cross bonded with the main cellulose chain.<br>
Thus production of soft and fine jute fibres from raw jute suitable for wide applicability of jute fibres has been a continuing and long existing problem in the art of processing of jute fibres and continue to be unsolved thus restricting the application of jute compatible to its natural harsh and coarse properties.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide for soft, pliable and fine jute fibres from raw jute which would be suitable for diversified use of jute fibres Another object of the present invention is to provide for a process of producing very fine jute fibre from raw jute which will be suitable for use in the textile industry.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a process for producing tailor made jute fibres for specific application.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing fine jute fibres which can advantageously substitute the conventional water or ribbon retting and will be simple, environment friendly and cost effective to carry out.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for producing soft and fine jute fibres from raw jute comprising:<br>
pretreating the raw jute by impregnation in an alkaline impregnating solution,<br>
subjecting the thus pretreated raw jute to steam treatment in a pressure vessel under pressure of at least 10 bars for a period of 10 to 30 minutes ;<br>
releasing the pressure in said pressure vessel to atmospheric pressure to thereby cause explosion of the jute to fine fibres,<br>
followed by washing the thus obtained fine fibres with water and then drying<br>
Importantly, immediately after the steam explosion treatment of jute to obtain fine fibres in the above disclosed process of the invention, the fibres are required to be thoroughly washed, if necessary, with a mild scouring agent to maintain desired softness and fineness of the fibres produced.<br>
In the above process of the invention the raw jute input material is pre-treated with an impregnating solution which is an alkaline solution preferably dilute sodium hydroxide solution having concentration in the range of 1% to 10% which is next treated in a reactor similar to a pressure chamber, using saturated steam under pressure of about at least 10 bar and time of about 10-30 mins.<br>
The alkaline concentration, the time of impregnation, pressure and duration of treatment and varied depending on the quality and the intended purpose of fibres. After the necessary reaction time, the reactor is de-compressed to normal pressure by means of a valve (steam explosion) and the fibres are sent through a tube system to a collecting vessel Through a sudden simmering and acceleration of the fibres being sent out, a refining of the fibres takes place. Those which have been freed from accompanying<br>
substances in the steam explosion process, are rinsed in a follow-up treatment Here, the fibres can be washed, dyed or subject to spin finish when required. After a drying, and if needed a first opening process, the fibres can then be delivered for spinning<br>
Thus in accordance with the invention, conditions and process parameters of the steam explosion technology to produce "tailor made" fibres for specific applications is possible The application of the fine jute fibres produced by the process of the invention would serve better processing behaviour (spinnability etc.) and better yarn quality for higher value added products as well as the use of the jute fibres in cotton processing (OE and ringspinning) with a high percentage of jute.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages will be further apparent from the ensuing description made with relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the process of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
The following Examples 1 to 5, the raw jute JRO 524 was processed in accordance with the present invention under processing parameters as detailed in Table I.<br>
As would be evident from Table II, the strength of the alkali solution used as the impregnating solution and the pressure applied during steam treatment can be varied to achieve varied ultimate fibre properties and fibre fineness. In particular, the above Table II clearly also demonstrate the adaptability of the process of the invention to produce jute fibres of varying fineness varying from airflow fineness of 6.05 to 12.87.<br>
Suitability of the steam exploded jute fibres produced in accordance with the present invention for standard jute processing line and also for short staple spinning systems/the cotton spinning system was next tested.<br>
Considering that standard jute processing line would require longer but less finer jute fibres, the fibre obtained following one of the low severity treatment methods under Example 4 above was subjected to standard jute processing line while the fibre produced following one of the high severity treatment under Example 3 above was used for cotton spinning system which required more finer and short length fibres.<br>
I. Following Standard Jute Processing Line<br>
Procedure :<br>
About 80 kg of soft and fine jute fibre obtained following the process of Example 4 (low severity treatment) after proper drying was treated with oil water emulsion as per normal practice in the jute industry. Thereafter, the fibres were opened in the breaker and finisher card. After passing through several passage of intersecting drawing and comber, when necessary sliver were made for spinning. The fibres were spun in NSC ring<br><br>
spinning machine into 3 lbs and 4 lbs all jute yarns at a speed of 7500 and 8000 r.p.m. respectively.<br>
The results of the above processing at various stages A0, A2, A4, Bl, B4 are given in the Tables III.<br>
As would be evident the fibre quality of the fine fibres produced under Example 4 are superior to that obtained under conventional techniques. In particular, the fibres obtained following Example 4 in accordance with the process of the invention appeared very soft in feeling with improved quality as compared with the raw jute and there was no problem in handling these treated jute fibres in jute machinery. The yarn tenacity of the fibres under Example 4 was found to be much higher as the fibre fineness improved and also due to less rigidity of the fibres. The jute yarn is also more regular and can be very easily used in coarse cotton clothes.<br>
Comparative study of yarns made from standard processed jute fibres and that of steam exploded jute fibres in accordance with the process of the invention under Example 4 was carried out and the results are represented in Table IV.<br>
II. Following Cotton Spinning Line Procedure :<br>
This fibre produced by the process of Example 3 (high severity treatment) was chosen for processing in the short staple spinning machinery The fibres after washing and drying were opened.<br>
The fibre appeared very soft and had no harsh feeling as compared with normal jute The fibre fineness in this case was found to vary between 5 to 8 denier depending on the treatment conditions which is very much desired for blending with cotton in the<br>
short staple machinery. The strength of the fibres are also found matching very well with cotton. The fibres were blended with cotton in 50 : 50 ratio and the results of the yarn test are given in Table V.<br>
Thus the above results of spinning tests carried out one in the long fibre machinery and the other in short staple machinery using steam exploded jute fibres produced in accordance with the invention, it was possible to spin all jute and jute blended yarns of Nm 10 to 15 very easily and without any process modification. Due to polygonal structure of the fibres even after steam explosion a very good silver adhesion is maintained. The process reduces the fibre stiffness considerably and thereby lead to more compact yarn structure and also more regular all jute yarn.<br>
Importantly, in keeping with the requirement in rotor or open and spinning of well cleanned fibres, as trash and dirt particles can accumulate in the rotor and do not produce good yarn, after steam explosion the jute fibre produced in accordance with the invention have a very high degree of purity which can be achieved after washing or bleaching.<br>
Also, due to improved surface properties of the fibre a very good silver adhesion are possible without the use of any spin finishing agents. The yarns, intended for optimizing for industrial purpose, may be used for apparels.<br>
It is thus evident from the above disclosure that the steam exploded jute fibre processing in accordance with the invention could provide for fine jute fibres. Added to the above, the process of the invention would provide for diversified use of jute<br>
fibre especially in the textile industry and enable production of tailor made jute fibres for specific application.<br>
The steam explosion process of the invention will also provide new fibre extraction process without the use of time consuming normal retting process<br>
The process of fine jute production of the invention which can substitute retting process can also help the farmers to get fibres without normal retting process and thereby favour environmental pollution free production of fine jute fibres.<br>
The steam exploded jute fibres produced in accordance with the invention is proved to be completely different material from normal jute and it can be used for value added jute products. Importantly, the fibre obtained by the process being very soft and flexible can be blended with cotton or any synthetic fibres. The fibre with low severity treatment can be very well blended with wool and can be used for knitting<br>
The process of the invention provides for industrial production of jute fibres which can open up new innovative fields of application for the natural resources of jute. Apart from the textile application containing the highest added values for the products, the application in non-textile fields is also possible such as substitute for man made or glass fibres, as well as in the production of special cellulose pulps, composites and fibre reinforced plastics.<br>
