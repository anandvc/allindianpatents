Multi-level scheduling method supporting multiple ports and<br>
multiple services<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to data frame communication technology, specifically to the Resilient Packet Ring (abbreviated as RPR) technology in a metropolitan area network, and more specifically to the scheduling method of a RPR device with multiple user side ports and each user side ports supporting multiple services.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The Resilient Packet Ring technology is a newly-emerged technology* the purpose of which is to build a data frame communication network where the bandwidth can be multiplexed, and each node has a fair algorithm to ensure the bandwidth occupancy, and with the capabilities of ring protection and QOS (Quality of Service), and is mainly directed to metropolitan area backbone ring networks and metropolitan area access ring network. In December 2000, the IEEE specifically set up an IEEE 802.17 standard group to formulate an IEEE 802.17 MAC (Media Access Control) level standard which is based on the RPR technology and capable of building a resilient packet ring.<br>
The key characteristic of the RPR technology is to classify all traffic into three classes: Class A is that of real time traffic; Class B is divided into two portions, with the B-CIR (committed information rate) being that of traffic of a guaranteed rate level, and the B-EIR (excess information rate) being that of traffic exceeding a guaranteed rate level; and Class C is that of best effort traffic. These three classes of traffic are distinguished by the<br><br>
ZhongzHLaid Office	FftX NO.   :66091199	Mar.   07 2006 13:39	P4<br>
ServiceClass defined in the frame structure. The traffics to enter a RPR ring from an individual RPR node are shaped and scheduled according to their respective classes of A, B, or C, and then enter the RPR ring.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a RPR device typically comprises 2 RPR ring side ports and a set of user side ports, and the frames entering or leaving through the RPR ring side ports are RPR MAC frames having the traffic class IDs of A, BÂ» or C, while the user side ports are mostly Ethernet ports, the frames entering or leaving through which are Ethernet frames with no traffic class IDs of A, B, or C within the frame structure. Multiple RPR devices are formed into a RPR through their RPR ring side ports. The user side ports of a prior art RPR device have no queues, and when a data frame enters a user side port, after some forwarding operation, it enters the A/B/C queue of a RPR ring, and then goes through the standard shaping and scheduling operations, eaters a pending send queue, and finally enters a RPR ring, as shown in Fig. 2. There are several problems in the above method of scheduling processing of frames received in the user side ports: Firstly, now that there are often multiple user side ports in a RPR device, the case may occur where some port has heavy traffic and some other port has light traffic, and in the prior art the scheduling is typically performed in a first-come first-serve manner, which may lead to a situation where the port with slight traffic is starved. Secondly, the traffic entering from a certain user side port may be Class A or B or C traffic, and if a large amount of Class C traffic enters first and Class A traffic enters subsequently, according to the first-come first-serve principle, a large amount of Class C traffic with lower priority will be processed first, and the Class A traffic with higher priority will only be processed after the Class C traffic has been processed, thus the problem of delay and delay jitter of Class A traffic cannot be solved.<br>

The weight values of different classes of traffic can be different.<br>
The step of performing a two level scheduling on the second level queues specifically comprises:<br>
Step 1, querying one by one whether the second level queues of traffic class A of the user side ports are empty, and if so, performing Step 2; otherwise proceeding to Step 3;<br>
Step 2, determining whether this user side port is the last user side port, and if so, proceeding to Step 5; otherwise returning to Step 1, querying the second level queue of traffic class A of the next user side port;<br>
Step 3, according to the weight value of class A traffic of the user side port, scheduling the class A traffic in the second level queue into the first level queue of traffic class A;<br>
Step 4, determining whether the first level queue of traffic class A is full, and if no, proceeding to Step 2; if yes, proceeding to Step 5;<br>
Step 5, querying one by one whether the second level queues of traffic class B of the user side ports are empty, and if so, performing Step 6; otherwise, proceeding to Step 7;<br>

The step of performing the insert scheduling on the three classes of traffic in the first level queues further comprises: shaping die three classes of traffic respectively, and then scheduling the data frames of the respective traffics to be outputted into the corresponding RPR ring.<br>
The shaping and scheduling are performed in the order that class A traffic takes priority over class B traffic, and class B traffic takes priority over class C traffic;<br>
The shaping is to shape the traffic of the corresponding class in the first level queues according to the credit value of each class of traffic.<br>
The credit value of each class of traffic is determined by the total bandwidth of class A, B, or C traffic allowed to enter into the RPR ring from the RPR device.<br>
The total bandwidth of class A, B or C traffic allowed to enter into the RPR ring from an individual RPR device is configured by users.<br>
The steps of the insert scheduling specifically comprises:<br><br>

repeated here.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, at each user side port of the RPR device is provided three queues, as the second level queues of the three traffic classes A, B and C. The data frames received by the user side ports first enter the second level queues of the respective traffic classes, and a two level scheduling consisting of firstly traffic class scheduling and then port weight scheduling is performed on the data frames of various traffics in the second level queues, and the data frames after the two level scheduling enter into the first level queues of traffic classes A, B and C, and after being shaped by a shaper, the data frames enter into a pending send queue, and finally enter into the RPR ring.<br>
The total bandwidth of class A traffic, the total bandwidth of class B traffic, and the total bandwidth of class C traffic of an individual RPR device allowed to enter into the RPR ring, as well ^&amp; the minimum bandwidth of class A traffic, the minimum bandwidth of class B traffic, the minimum bandwidth of class C traffic at each user side port allowed to enter into the RPR ring, can all be configured by users, wherein the sum of the minimum bandwidths of class A traffic allowed at each user side port is equal to the total bandwidth of class A traffic of the RPR device, and the same corresponding relationship holds true for class B traffic and class C traffic as well.<br>
The process flow of the user side ports receiving data frames is as shown in Fig. 4, where the respective user side port receives a data frame, then classify the data frame into the traffic class A, B or C according to the its class ID, and place the data frame into the second level queue of the corresponding traffic class belonging to the port<br>
The process flow of the two level scheduling is as shown in Fig. 5. Assuming that an individual RPR site has N user side ports, first the traffic<br>

FROM :2hongzi Law D-Tfice	FAX NO. :6G091199	Mar. 07 2006 13:42   Pll<br>
class scheduling of the first level is performed, that is, the scheduling is performed in the order of firstly class A traffic, then class B traffic, and finally class C traffic one by one. First, the second level queues of class A traffic of the user side ports 1-N are polled one by one, and if the polled second level queue of the current user side port is empty, the second level queue of class A traffic of the next user side port is polled subsequently, otherwise the traffic data frames in the second level queue of class A traffic of this user side port is scheduled into the first level queue of class A traffic according to the weight value of class A traffic of this user side port. The weight value of class A traffic is derived from the ratio between the bandwidth of class A traffic of the user side port as configured by a user and die bandwidth of class A traffic of the entire RPR device. If all the second level queues of class A traffic have been scheduled, or the first level queue of class A traffic is full, the scheduling of the second level queues of class B traffic is performed The scheduling method of the second level queues of class B traffic is the same as the above-described scheduling method of the second level queues of class A traffic, if all the second level queues of class B traffic have been scheduled, or the first level queue of class B traffic is full, the scheduling of the second level queues of class C traffic is performed. The scheduling method of the second level queues of class C traffic is the same as the above-described scheduling method of the second level queues of class A traffic. And the above steps are cycled through repeatedly. It should be noted that the port weight values of the three traffic classes A, B and C can be different.<br>
Fig. 6 depicts a flow diagram of the insert scheduling, wherein the normal RPR insert scheduling is performed on the traffics in the first level queues, including the shaping operation and scheduling process on the traffic data in the priority order of firstly class A traffic, then class B<br>

traffic, and finally class C traffic. As defined in the standard, traffic class A is further divided into class AO and class Al, wherein class AO is higher in priority, therefore when class A traffic is scheduled, the scheduling is performed in the order of firstly class AO traffic and then class Al traffic. When class AO traffic is scheduled, first the class A traffic in the first level queue is shaped according to the credit value of AO, consuming the corresponding credit value of AO, and the shaped data frames are sent to the pending send queue to enter into the RPR ring. When the credit value of AO is consumed up, the scheduling of class Al traffic is performed, wherein the class A traffic in the first level queue is shaped according to the credit value of At, consuming the corresponding credit value of Al, and then the shaped data frames go through a D shaper, consuming the corresponding credit value of D, and shaped data is sent to the pending send queue to enter into the RPR ring. When the credit value of Al is consumed up, the scheduling of class A traffic is suspended, and class B traffic is scheduled, and then class C traffic is scheduled subsequently, the process flow of scheduling class B traffic and class C traffic being the same as that of class A traffic. The credit values of different traffics are determined by the respective total bandwidths of class A, B or C traffic of the RPR device allowed to enter into the RPR ring.<br>
Although the traffic class classification method of the present invention has been illustrated and described, obviously the present invention is not limited thereby. And numerous modifications, substitutions, alterations, and alternative and equivalent elements would readily be contemplated by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A multi-level scheduling method supporting multi-ports and multi-services comprises: providing second level queues of traffic classes A, B, and C at each user side port of an individual RPR device, the data frames received at the user side port to be placed in the respective second level queues according to their traffic class IDs; performing a two level scheduling consisting of firstly traffic class scheduling and then port weight scheduling on the second level queues of the user side port; the data frames after the two level scheduling entering into first level queues of traffic classes A, B, and C respectively; and performing a RPR insert scheduling on the three classes of traffic in the first level queues. The present invention effectively solves the scheduling in case where the traffics of multiple user side ports need to eater the RPR ring and each user side port has the three classes A, B and C of traffic at the same time, meets the requirement that the class A traffics are scheduled firstly, the class B traffics are scheduled secondly, and the class C traffics are scheduled finally, thus guaranteeing the delay and delay jitter requirements of class A traffic and class B traffics.<br><br></td>
