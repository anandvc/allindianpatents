MEASURING FEEDING UNIT<br>
The invention relates to a measuring feeding unit according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In a known measuring feeding device (WO 98/37265) a brake shoe for co-action with the storage body is arranged in winding direction ahead of the stopper element.  The brake shoe can be adjusted between a braking position and a passive position.   The purpose of the brake shoe is to temporarily stabilise the yarn section between the last winding in withdrawal direction and the stopper element which then is moved into the stopping position.    The brake shoe is moved back and forth correlated with the movement of the stopper element into the braking position.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a measuring feeding unit of the type as disclosed at the beginning which performs with an improved yarn control during and after the yarn withdrawal.   Part of the object is to improve the yarn control in a measuring feeding unit where several windings are completely set free for the withdrawal from the very small outer diameter rod cage by the winding-on action by pushing windings substantially axially off from the rod cage, which pushed off windings then remain free in space, i.e. without any inner mechanical suspension, and which set free windings then are consumed by the insertion process before they collapse.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of claim 1.<br>
The braking element which is in a permanent braking position with respect to the rods surprisingly does not have any negative influence on the yarn geometry or the insertion speed during the forward conveyance of the windings on the rods and/or during the withdrawal although each yarn winding or several yarn windings at the same time are transiently loaded by to the braking resistance as generated between the yarn carrying surface and the braking surface.  When passing through the braking zone the yarn windings, in some cases, will become placed closely adjacent to each other, in some cases even with strong mutual contact, however, without losing the well organised tubular configuration on the rod cage.   It is assumed that this is the result of the very uniform and permanent action of the braking element.   In addition, a desirable effect will occur, namely that the braking element controls at least a majority of the yarn on the rod such that the<br><br>
windings maintain an orderly configuration and that an occurring tension increase is dissipated to a large extent by friction forces.  The tension increase results from a momentary tension peak caused y strong deceleration of the yarn after the termination of an insertion process by the stopper element.   The tension increase tends to act backwards into the windings on the storage body and to cause disorder or even a yarn breakage there. The braking element either only contacts the yarn carrying surface or even is pressed resiliency against the yarn carrying surface, or even may be positioned with a predetermined distance from the yarn carrying surface which distance is smaller than the thickness of the winding of the yarn.   Due to this arrangement each winding will be exposed to a predetermined braking effect.   These combined effects are of particular advantage in case of a measuring feeding unit having a very small diameter storage body and an operating principle according to which several windings are set free axially in a tubular configuration from the rods for each insertion process.   In this case the effect of the braking element is particularly advantageous because a lot of windings will have to be moved due to the very small storage body diameter with high axial speed below the braking element for each insertion process.   In connection therewith it is particularly important for the windings which have been set free in the tubular configuration that these windings are maintained stably and orderly in the tubular configuration even for the insertion process. During the insertion process the yarn is then pulled from the frontmost winding in withdrawal direction directly inwardly towards the axis of the tubular configuration, because there is no inner balloon forming mechanical suspension of the set free windings, such that an undesirable balloon formation is avoided to a large extent which otherwise could delay the insertion speed in an unpredictable fashion.<br>
Expediently at least two braking elements are arranged symmetrically to each other.   This assures that the windings will not become oriented obliquely in relation to the axis of the rod cage.<br>
Expediently, the braking element is formed or arranged such that it yields substantially radially with respect to the axis of the rod cage.   This flexibility results in a well dosed braking effect during which the braking element may yield.   This is also important if e.g. a thickened portion of the yarn has to pass.  The springy flexibility of the braking element, furthermore, results in an instantaneous return of the braking element into the<br><br>
predetermined permanent braking position such that all passing windings will receive essentially the same braking effect.<br>
Expediently, the braking element and the yarn carrying surface jointly define a tapering yarn entrance gap and a diverging yarn exit gap with a braking zone provided in-between, along which the yarn carrying surface and the braking surface at least to a large extent extend parallel to each other and in withdrawal direction.   By means of this structure the braking effect gradually increases to a maximum, remains then, e.g. transiently, at the maximum, and then decreases gradually.   These kinematic conditions are important for good yarn control.   In case of a tension peak acting backwards during the braking phase with maximum braking effect from the withdrawal side this tension peak will be dissipated at least to a large extent by the braking effect without causing a disorder in the windings which are situated upstream of the braking zone, or without causing a yarn breakage.<br>
In an expedient embodiment the braking element is arranged next to an end portion of the yarn carrying surface which is situated at the withdrawal end of the rod cage such that the windings are brought against each other directly upstream of the withdrawal end while at the same time the yarn windings are braked in a controlled fashion.<br>
In an important embodiment the circumferential width of the yarn carrying surface or of the braking zone decreases in withdrawal direction such that then as well the braking effect will decrease while the specific area contact pressure will increase.   The braking zone theoretically could even be line-shaped.   In order to treat the yarn as gently as possible it is, however, expedient to form the braking zone in circumferential direction with a finite width.<br>
In an expedient embodiment the braking element is constituted by a skid which is moveably guided essentially radial with respect to the axis of the rod cage in an external stationary guidance, and which is loaded by a spring in the direction towards the rod.   The friction properties of the braking surface and the spring force result in a predetermined well dosed braking effect.<br>
Expediently the allowed stroke end position of the skid in the guidance is limited by a stop such that the permanent braking position is a braking position in which the braking surface<br><br>
eitner coniacis tne yarn carrying surface with a predetermined contact pressure or even maintains at a predetermined distance from the yarn carrying surface.<br>
The spring force with which the braking surface is acting, expediently, can be adjusted in order to adapt the respective braking effect to different yarn qualities.<br>
In an expedient embodiment braking elements are arranged in permanent braking positions at more than two up to maximum all rods.  A particularly symmetrical distribution of the braking effect can be achieved with the help of four braking elements which are arranged offset to each other respectively by approximately 90°.<br>
In order to properly consume the tension peak occurring with the termination of an insertion process at least to a large extent, and to avoid that the tension peak can act backwards into the windings on the rod cage, an engagement opening for the stopper element is provided in a selected rod, and a braking element is arranged in the permanent braking position in winding direction in front of the engagement opening for the same rod or for a rod which precedes in winding direction, respectively.   Due to this arrangement the first braking effect will be received by the yarn with an optimal short distance from the stopper element while the stopper element terminates the yarn withdrawal of this insertion process.<br>
In an alternative embodiment each braking element is constituted by a spring tongue which is stationarily held in withdrawal direction in front of and/or behind the braking zone.   A spring tongue only needs a small mounting space and may be designed to produce a very precisely predictable braking effect.<br>
In a further embodiment the braking elements are arranged within a ring body surrounding the rod cage.   The ring body, so to speak, then defines a common guidance and suspension for all braking elements.<br>
In a further, expedient embodiment a braking element is associated to each rod. At least for some of the braking elements de-activating devices may be provided. By using these devices, e.g. for an adaptation to different yarn qualities, the number of actually active and permanently braking braking elements can be selected upon demand.   The braking<br><br>
elements which then will be held in their passive positions do not generate any braking influence on the yarn windings.<br>
Since in case of a measuring feeding unit having only a single stopping device the effective diameter of the rod cage must be, as is conventional, variable in order to allow an adaptation to the respective actual weaving width, also the braking elements or the guidances of the braking elements should be adjustable in radial direction in order to allow to again adjust the desired braking effects when beforehand the diameter of the rod cage has been changed.<br>
A particularly expedient embodiment is characterised by the fact that the rod cage has an outer diameter between about 20 mm to 60 mm, that a stopper element is provided at a selected rod which stopper element is transported in withdrawal direction exclusively by the yarn windings along this selected rod into a defined stopped position, and that a respective braking element is provided in a permanent braking position at each of at least at two rods which are offset in circumferential direction by about 90° in relation to the selected rods.   In order to achieve that at least the last braking element which operates in winding direction ahead of the stopper element, will consume energy as desired and will maintain the yarn windings in controlled fashion during the occurring tension peak after the termination of the insertion process, the yam braking zone of this braking element should be aligned in circumferential direction at least approximately to the defined stop position.   Expediently, the selected rod is one of the lowermost rods of the rod cage the axis of which should be substantially horizontal.   In this case the at least two diametrically opposed other braking elements are situated approximately in the same horizontal plane.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be explained with the help of the drawings.   In the drawings is:<br>

Fig. 5 a side view of a further embodiment.<br>
Although in Figs 1 to 4 structural details are shown of a specific type of a measuring feeding unit M, the core of the invention, consisting of at least two braking elements P placed in permanent braking positions, also may be useful for other types of measuring feeding units which are provided with a stationary storage body for intermediately storing windings of a yarn Y.   The storage body does not necessarily need to be a rod cage but instead could have another geometrical shape.<br>
Such measuring feeding units usually are used in jet weaving machines, particularly air jet weaving machines, for intermediately storing the weft yarn material and for measuring the pick length for each insertion process.   For measuring the pick length such units are equipped with a stopping device containing a movably driven stopper element A.<br>
The measuring feeding unit M as shown in Figs 1 to 4 differs from other, known measuring feeding units among other things by an extremely small diameter storage body which is formed as a rod cage K (diameter e.g. between 20 mm and 60 mm, preferably between about 30 mm and 45 mm), by a stopper element A used for terminating the respective insertion process or pick which stopper element exclusively is moved by the windings of the yarn Y into a defined stop position Q, and by a controlled yarn clamp K used for starting the respective insertion process or pick.   Furthermore, in some cases, an axial, expediently tapering guiding arbour B is provided at the rod cage K in Fig. 1.   This measuring feeding unit M is operating according to a specific function principle such that prior to an insertion process several closely adjacent windings are set free in a tubular configuration from the storage body by using the result of the winding motion of a winding-on element W in relation to the stationary rod cage K to convey the already formed windings forward, which then set free windings are pulled off during the withdrawal action of the insertion process without inner mechanical suspension out of the tubular configuration inwardly towards the tube axis and then further into the weaving machine.   This function principle results in the prevention of a ballooning effect and, for that reason, allows high insertion speeds without delays (disclosed in WO 02/33157 A incorporated here).<br><br>
In Figs 1 and 2 the measuring feeding unit M comprises a stationary rod cage K consisting of substantially axially extending, in this case freely ending rods S, S' which are spaced apart in circumferential direction.  The rod cage K e.g. is rotatably supported on a driving shaft of the winding-on element W and is hindered by magnets, as known per se, against co-rotation with the driving shaft.  The winding-on element W e.g. is rotating in a winding direction 1.<br>
A stopping device which is not shown in detail is co-acting with a selected rod S' (Figs 3 and 4) which selected rod S' is situated in Fig. 1 in a low position.   The stopping device has the extractable and retractable stopper element A.   Stationary guidances F are provided on both sides of the rod cage K.   Each guidance comprises at least one braking element P which is held in a permanent braking position in relation to one rod S.   In the embodiment shown, two braking elements P are located at two rods S which are diametrically opposed in relation to the axis X of the rod cage.   Instead there could be provided more than two braking elements P, which, expediently, are distributed regularly in circumferential direction, in some cases even as many braking elements P as rods S, S' are provided.  A good yarn control, however, already can be achieved by providing one single braking element P only.<br>
The yarn clamp C is controlled between a clamping position and a release position, such that in the release position the withdrawn yarn runs off unobstructedly but is stopped in the clamping position.   The stopper element A, when engaged, terminates an insertion process by hindering a further withdrawal of the yarn Y.   The insertion process is started by the yarn clamp C by releasing the yarn Y which has been held until this point in time.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates that each rod S defines a yarn carrying surface 4 which terminates at a withdrawal end 5 and which has, at the beginning, an inclined slope.  The yarn carrying surface 4 is situated on the upper side of the rod S which upper side is remote from the axis X of the rod cage.  The yarn carrying surface 4 extends substantially axially.<br>
The yarn carrying surfaces 4 could extend parallel to the axis X of the rod cage, or could have a slight slope downwardly in withdrawal direction D.   In order to allow an adaptation of the rod cage diameter to different weaving widths the rods S expediently are adjustable in<br><br>
radial direction in the direction of a double arrow 13 in order to vary the circumferential length as defined by the yarn carrying surfaces 4.<br>
Both braking elements P which are shown in their actual spatial positions in Fig. 1 are arranged in permanent braking positions relative to the rods S.   In Fig. 2 each braking element P is a skid 2 which is guided for a sliding motion essentially radial to the axis X of the rod cage in the guidance F and which is urged by a spring 8 in the direction towards the yarn carrying surface 4.   The skid 2 defines a braking surface 3 the geometric form is selected in the cross-section in Fig. 2 such that an entrance gap 6 which gradually converges in withdrawal direction D, in continuation thereto a braking zone Z, and behind the braking zone a gradually diverging exit gap 7 are defined between the braking surface 3 and the yarn carrying surface 4.   The braking surface 3 only co-acts with the end portion of the yarn carrying surface 4 close to the withdrawal end 5, expediently with a yarn carrying surface end section 4' which, in some cases, has a stronger slope downwardly in the direction to the axis X of the rod cage than the remaining part of the yarn carrying surface 4 which is situated closer to the winding element W.<br>
The spring 8 urging the braking element 2 expediently is pre-loaded by a spring retainer 9 which can be adjusted in the direction of the arrow 10 in order to vary the spring load for the braking element.<br>
Furthermore, a stop 11 (Fig. 2) may be provided which serves to limit the stroke of the braking element P in the guidance F.   The position of the stop 11 may be adjusted at 12. In the permanent braking position of the braking element P the braking surface 3 is held with a distance from the yarn carrying surface 4 or 4\ respectively, which distance amounts to between zero and less than the thickness of the respectively processed yarn Y.   That is, the braking surface 3 may directly contact the yarn carrying surface 4 or 4\ even could be pressed against the yarn carrying surface under pre-load, or may remain under pre-load with a small intermediate distance from the yarn carrying surface 4 or 4\   This intermediate distance is smaller than the thickness of the yarn Y, such that a winding of the yarn Y (Figs 3 and 4) formed on the yarn carrying surfaces 4 or 4' by the rotation of the winding-on element W will become exposed to a braking effect while axially passing through the braking zone Z.<br><br>
The yarn carrying surfaces 4 or 4' extend substantially axially and either have a finite width in circumferential direction, or may even be almost line-shaped, or may taper in withdrawal direction W such that their width decreases in withdrawal direction W.   In circumferential direction the braking surface 3 has a width which to a large extent corresponds to the width of the yarn carrying surface 4 or 4'.   However, the braking surface 3 even may be wider or narrower than the yarn carrying surface.   In Fig. 2 the braking surface 3 e.g. is curved convexly such that, expediently, at least in the braking zone Z in Figs 2 or 3 the yarn carrying surface 4' and the braking surface 3 extend substantially parallel to each other. The braking surface 3 may - seen in circumferential direction - run backwardly outside of the braking zone, as indicated in Fig. 3.<br>
Function<br>
Consecutive windings of the yarn Y lie on the rod cage K.  The stopper element A is retracted.   The yarn clamp C is in the clamping position and firmly holds the yarn which extends from the windings to the not shown insertion device of the weaving machine.   The stopper element A is retracted by a not shown drive to the outside of the windings and is moved back in the direction towards the winding-on element W by another drive such that it is in a preparatory position ready to be engaged again.   The winding-on element W is rotating in winding direction 1 and consecutively is forming new windings on the rod cage K. Depending on the number of windings which have to be released per insertion process or pick the stopper element is extended in front of a just formed winding and e.g. into a selected rod S' while the winding-on element W still is rotating.   Then the engaging stopper element is transported by the windings themselves in withdrawal direction D to the predetermined stop position Q in Fig. 4.   During the winding process windings are continuously set free in withdrawal direction beyond the withdrawal ends 5 of the rods S which set free windings then constitutes a tubular configuration and, so to speak, remain free in space.  The guiding arbour B has a substantially smaller diameter than the outer diameter which is defined by the rods S, S'.   The yarn clamp C is adjusted into the release position such that the not shown insertion device of the weaving machine can withdraw the yarn from the set-free windings.  As no inner mechanical suspension of the set-free windings exists, the withdrawn yarn runs from the first winding at the withdrawal side directly inwardly essentially towards a prolongation of the axis X of the rod cage and then may be supported by the guidance arbour B such that no kinks can be formed.  As soon as<br><br>
the stopper element A has reached the defined stop position Q, the insertion process or pick is terminated since the yarn will be caught and secured at the stopper element A. Subsequently, the yarn clamp C again is adjusted into the clamping position in order to firmly hold the yarn while the stopper element A then will be retracted and then will be returned in the direction towards the winding-on element W.  At the same time, new windings are again set free.<br>
The braking elements P which are placed in the permanent braking positions and which, e.g., are symmetrically provided at the circumference of the rod cage in relation to the axis X of the rod cage act on each winding of the yarn Y (Figs 3 and 4) with a braking effect while the winding passes through.  The braking zones S are aligned in circumferential direction substantially at least with the defined stop position Q of the stopper element A such that a whiplash stretching effect which normally would occur when the insertion process has been terminated and which would result in a drastic yarn tension peak and would act backward into the windings on the rod cage K is to a large extent dissipated already in the braking zones S and for that reason cannot bring the other upstream windings out of their orderly winding configuration.   For this damping of the whiplash stretching effect particularly the first braking element P is responsible which is placed in winding direction 1 (corresponding with the winding off direction during the withdrawal) ahead of the stopper element A.<br>
This will be explained again with the help of Figs 3 and 4.   Fig. 3 shows the selected rod S' which co-acts with the stopper element A and which is, e.g. in Fig. 1, the lowermost rod. The rod S' has the yarn carrying surface 4 or 4\ and an engagement opening 15 for the stopper element A which is guided in the engagement opening 15 substantially in withdrawal direction D until it reaches the defined stop position Q at the end of the engagement opening 15.   The yarn carrying surface 4 or 4' e.g. is rounded convexly with a radius of the curvature the centre of which may be the axis X of the rod cage.  Alternatively, the yarn carrying surface 4, 4' even may be planar or flat.   The one rod S shown in Fig.3 which is offset in relation to the selected rod S' in winding direction 1 by about 90° also has a yarn carrying surface 4' which is bounded on both sides by downwardly sloping flanks 14 and which also may be curved with a radius towards the axis X of the rod cage (in the cross-section in Fig. 3).   The braking surface 3 of the braking element P, which may be loaded by the spring 8, may be flat or rounded convexly and is bounded on both sides of<br><br>
tne braking zone Z by flanks which run outwardly.   Each winding of the yarn Y will be brakingly clamped in the braking zone Z.  As a consequence of the winding-on operation the shown winding has passed the entrance gap 6 and has reached the braking zone Z and then will leave the braking zone Z in withdrawal direction through the exit gap 7.  As mentioned, the braking zone Z is aligned in circumferential direction substantially to the predetermined stop position Q of the stopper element A such that the tension rise or tension peak which could occur in the yarn Y as a consequence of the stoppage at the stopper element A is dampened or attenuated in the braking zone Z.<br>
As soon as the stopper element A again has been disengaged by being retracted, the yarn is withdrawn continuously by the not shown insertion device of the weaving machine out of the set free windings.  At the same time, the windings which continuously are formed by the winding operation have passed one by one through the braking zones Z of the braking elements P and by this braking effect are brought in direct contact with each other.   This mutual abutting condition between the yarn windings will remain also in the tubular configuration of the windings which are set free for the withdrawal beyond the withdrawal ends 5, which improves the dimensional stability of the tubular configuration of the set free windings.<br>
There may more than two braking elements P each in a permanent braking position, in some cases braking elements at all rods S, and in some cases even a braking element also at the selected rod S\   If there is a braking element P at the selected rod S\ the braking element P should be located in winding direction ahead of the stopper element A.<br>
In some cases, all braking elements P may be provided in a not shown ring-shaped body then serving as a common guiding element.   In this case it is possible to provide deactivating devices by which selectively one or several braking elements can be brought from the permanent braking position into a passive position and can be held in the passive position such that they do not gain any further influence on the passage of the windings of the yarn Y.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a simple embodiment in which the braking element P is constituted by a spring tongue 16 (e.g. a leaf spring), which is held in a stationary guidance at 17 and which contacts the yarn carrying surface 4 in order to define the braking zone Z in the vicinity of<br><br>
the withdrawal end 5 by its braking surface 3.   The spring tongue 16 does not necessarily need to be in contact with the yarn carrying surface 4 but could even be positioned with a small distance above the yarn carrying surface 4 which distance, however, has to be smaller than the thickness of the yarn Y.  The spring tongue 16 instead could be supported at the other end or even could be supported at both ends, provided that it is assured that the braking surface 3 may yield in a springy fashion.  Alternatively, the spring tongue 16 could also substantially extend in circumferential direction in order to fulfil the same or a similar function.<br>
Other shapes of braking elements which are held in permanent braking positions would also be possible.<br>
In the shown embodiment the yarn carrying surface 4 extends substantially parallel to the axis X of the rod cage.   Only the end portion 4' of the yarn carrying surface 4 which leads to the withdrawal end 5 is inclined slightly downwards or is rounded downwards, respectively.   It is possible to orient the yarn carrying surface 4 continuously parallel to the axis X of the rod cage or to provide a uniform downward slope in withdrawal direction (cone feeding principle).   Furthermore, it is possible to equip the rod cage with an advance assembly which transports the windings when formed by the winding element W forward in withdrawal direction and which produces, in some cases, in the starting section of the rod cage intermediate distances between the windings (yarn separation).   These intermediate distances then can, in some cases due to the braking effect, even disappear later in the braking zone Z.<br>
The braking element P may have a metallic braking surface 3 or a braking surface 3 which is equipped with a specific coating, e.g. with a ceramic coating, in order to increase the wear resistance and to assure a constant coefficient of friction.   The shape of the rods and of the braking elements, basically, can be selected freely as long as it is assured that the braking zone Z will be formed within which each winding of the yarn Y which will be exposed to a braking effect.   The windings may be exposed to the braking effect one by one or in groups of several.<br>
The at least two braking elements P which are provided in permanent braking positions even could be implemented in conventional measuring feeding units which have a stop<br><br>
device with an exclusively radially engageable and retractable stopper element which then alone controls both the start and the termination of each insertion process.   In this case no windings will be set free prior to the withdrawal but the windings will be withdrawn during the insertion process only from the rod cage or from the storage body, respectively.<br><br>
