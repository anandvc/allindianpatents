TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention concerns an apparatus and a method for controlling the power flow in an ac transmission system. More precisely the invention concerns a control apparatus comprising a phase shifting transformer (PST). By a phase shifting transformer should in this context be understood to include a single cored as weii as a multiple cored transformer, both of which may comprise a symmetric or an asymmetric design. The phase shifting transformer may also comprise additional voltage regulating means.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A phase shifting transformer (PST) is previously known for controlling the power flow in an ac transmission line. Such PST comprises a tap changer that serially connects or disconnects additional windings of the transformer. By doing so the phasor orientation is controlled. Power is then moved from adjacent phases to a single phase by connections between windings excited by different parts of the magnetic circuit. In a pure phase shifting transformer a voltage in quadrature to the source voltage is injected to the line.<br>
A phase shifting transformer may be used to control the distribution load between parallel lines to increase total power transfer. Advantageous is the capability of the phase shifting transformers to block parasitic power flow due to phase angle difference in a feeding<br><br>
network. Power may be distributed to customer in a defined way and circulating power flows may be avoided.<br>
The use of a PST is advantageous in that the PST has relatively low reactive power consumption. There is no risk of a subsynchronous resonance (SSR) and it is powerful also at low current conditions.<br>
The use of a PST however offers a slow control speed. The tap changer has to go through every tap position in a sequential manner. Each tap change is effected in the order of 3-5 seconds. Thus the PST cannot participate in a decisive way in a transient period following a power disturbance. Further frequent tap changing, in particular at high current conditions, increases the need for maintenance.<br>
The tap changer is a mechanical device and thus slow and an object to mechanical wear. It has a maximum regulation voltage range of 150 kV and" the maximum number of operating steps is less than 35. The maximum tap voltage is in the order of 4000 - 5000V between two tap positions and the maximum rated throughput current is about 3000 -4500 A- The maximum power handling capacity is 6000 - 8000kVA/tap and there is a short circuit thermal limit. Small voltage steps results in a greater number of mechanical operations.<br>
Another way to control the power flow In an ac transmission line is the use of a controlled series compensator (CSC). Such CSC comprises one or a plurality of thyristor switched Inductive devices. The CSC may also comprise one or a plurality of thyristor switched capadtive devices, often In combination with an inductor. The capacltive device or the inductive device is connected in a parallel branch with a thyristor switch. By controlling the thyristor switch the inductive or the capacitive device Is connected or disconnected to the transmission line.<br><br>
9754WO 2007-04-20<br>
Thus the phasor orientation is controlled by connecting or disconnecting a'desired number or combination of inductances or capacitances. The regulation is rapid since there is no mechanical switching device involved.<br>
A CSC is controllable from full inductive to full capacitive regulation, and vice versa, within a few fundamental frequency cycles and is thus    . capable of being a powerful control device in a transient period following a power disturbance. In comparison with the mechanical tap changer of a PST, the need for maintenance of the thyristor controlled CSC does not increase as a consequence of frequent control actions. A CSC is therefore suitable for closed IOOD control.<br>
However in a circuit comprising a CSC with capacitive steps there is a risk for resonance problems such as SSR. The CSC has a larger reactive power consumption with large inductive steps in comparison to a PST. At low current conditions the CSC has a small impact on the power flow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide a power flow control of an ac power transmission that is rapid and that does not involve the drawbacks of the single use of either a PST or a CSC.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a control apparatus characterized by the features in the independent claim 1 or By "a method characterized by the steps in the independent claim 152, or by a computer program product containing instructions for a<br><br>
9754WO 2007-04-20<br>
computer according to claim 158. Preferred embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention a PST containing a tap changer, a CSC containing at controllable reactance means, and a controljunit that controls both the PST and the CSC are combined to form a control apparatus for controlling the power flow in a high voltage network. The controllable reactance means comprises a controllable capacitive means, i.e. a thyristor switched capacitor function. As a response to a change in the load conditions of the power transmission the power flow is contrdlled by flrstfy regulating the CSC and secondly regulating the PST by the tap changer. In a first period of time the control is effected solely by the CSC device and in a second period of time the control is effected by a combined regulation of both the CSC device and the PST. By this control the slow control capability of the PST is compensated for .by the rapid capability of the CSC.<br>
For every change from one tap to another of the tap changer the CSC is controlled to compensate for the new tap position. Since the CSC is rapid and controlled by the same control equipment as the tap changer every effected tap change is simultaneously compensated for by the CSC. Thus a favorable working condition of the apparatus may be achieved within the controlling ranges of both the PST and the CSC. if* a first embodiment of the invention tho controllable reactance means of the CSC comprises a thyristor switched capacitor function. In a second embodiment -of the invention the controllable reactance means of the CSC comprises a thyristor switched inductor function. In a further development of each of those embodiments the controllable reactance means of the CSC comprises a combination of switched capacitive<br>
mnnnc   r*n/H   jfi/rii iffiwo   rnAinr n Tt-CTtitJ a!1U TituUtilvtr tntraMo,<br><br>
In a first further aspect of the invention the object is achieved by a control apparatus comprising a PST including a tap changer, a CSC including a controllable reactance means, and a control system containing computer means including a processor for controlling the PST and the CSC in coordination. In a first preferred embodiment the GSC contains a controllable capacitivc means. In a further development of this embodiment the capacitive means comprises a plurality of Controllable capacitive units, each comprising a capacitor in parallel connection with a thyristor switch. In a second preferred embodiment the CSC contains a controllable inductive means. In a further development of this embodiment the controllable inductive means eompriscs a plurality of inductive units, each comprising an inductor in q parallel connection, witji o thyristor switch. In, a further embodiment the CSC comprises a combination of controllable capacitivc means and inductive means. In yet-a further embodiment the capacitive unit comprises an inductor in series with the thyristor switch. This inductor serves as a switching improvement and its presence is for switching purposes only. The control system comprises in a further embodiment a communication unit by which the control is supervised, controlled or overridden by an operator or a customer.<br>
In a yet furthersecond aspect of the invention the objects are achieved by a method for controlling the power flow in an ac transmission line, the method comprising a first step in which the new load demand is rapidly regulated by adjusting the reactance of the CSC, which is achieved by adjusting the capacitance of the capacitive means in the CSC, and a second step in which a combined regulation of both the PST and the CSC is evaluated. In a further step an internal regulation of a favorable working point for both the PST and the CSC is accomplished<br><br>
by regulating the PST in coordination with the CSC such that the external control is unaffected.<br>
The PST which is regulated in sequential steps by the tap changer is according to the invention combined with a CSC which is regulated by thyristor switches, to provide a fast and adaptive control of the power flow by a common control system. The stow control capability of the PST is compensated for by the rapid control of the CSC. The PST is thus dynamically assisted by the CSC when regulating. This dynamically assisted PST, in the following text denoted DAPST, comprises a standard tap changer controlled phase-shifting transformer combined with a thyristor switched inductive and/or caoacitive reactance circuits. Each suehThis circuit may comprise a plurality of inductive and capacitive circuits which may be connected in steps. The dynamic assistance of the PST reduces the number of control actions made by the tap changer, which dramatically increases the life time cycle of the tap changer.<br>
According to the invention the required rating of a power flow controller (PFC) is divided into two parts, one part consisting of the PST and the other part consisting of the CSC containing thyristor switched reactance circuits. The possibility to coordinate the control of the CSC and the PST offe.rs the rating of .both units to be smaller than in circuits where each unit works alone. As a comparison a single PST regulating unit would have to have a large rating and a single CSC unit would have to have an increased number of reactance circuits. The combination will obtain an overall improvement of the performance as compared to both the PST and the thyristor switched reactance steps only.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An apparatus for controlling the power flow according to the invention is shown in fig 1. The apparatus comprises a tap changer controlled phase shifting transformer (PST) 1, a controlled series compensator (CSC) 2 and a control unit 3, The CSC comprises a first reactance unit 5 that includes a capacitive unit 8 and a thyristor switch 7 for connecting and disconnecting the capacitive unit. In the embodiment<br><br>
shown the first reactance unit 5 further comprises an inductive unit 9 in series with the thyristor switch 7. The inductive unit 9 only serves the function of improving the switching performance of the first reactance unit. In the embodiment shown the CSC 2 further comprises a second reactance unit 4 that includes an inductive unit 6 and a thyristor switch 7 for connecting and disconnecting the inductive unit. The single capacitive and inductive reactance units are shown by way of example, It lies within the scope of the invention to combine any number of capacitive and inductive steps. Thus the controlled series compensation device may comprise a plurality of both capacitive 3nd inductive circuits.<br>
The CSC may be realized in different configurations. In a first embodiment the CSC comprises switchable capacitive units by which the CSC is controllable in discrete steps. In a second embodiment the CSC comprises a combination of capacitive and inductive units and thus being controllable in discrete steps. In a third embodiment the CSC comprises a plurality of boostabie capacitive steps and a plurality of inductive step that offers the CSC to be continuously controllable.<br>
In a one-sided discrete embodiment of the invention the CSC comprises only capacitive units. Assuming that the two capacitive steps are thyristor switched and that<br>
Xc,=2Xa<br>
The CSC units have thus a capacitive control range divided into discrete steps as illustrated in the fig 2,<br>
The control of the power flow by the PST is accomplished through control of the tap-changer. Since this is a mechanic device and the<br><br><br><br>
The control resolution of the apparatus according to the invention (the combined effect of tap changer and CSC control action) is in this embodiment made infinite over a large portion of the combined control range.<br>
In a further advanced embodiment of the invention means for reactive power shunt compensation is included such that the reactive power balance of the DAPST may be customized to meet the particular power system requirements. These means include devices such as for instance circuit breaker connected capacitor banks and reactors, static var compensators (SVC) and STATCGM.<br>
In order to illustrate the operating range of a DAPST a simple network as shown in fig 5 is used. The network comprises a DAPST according to the invention in a parallel connection with an equivalent reactance between a first node 14 and a second node 15. The purpose of a DAPST is to control the distribution of power between on one hand the path in which it is installed and on the other hand parallel paths. The parallel paths are in fig 5 represented by the equivalent inductive reactance X^<br>
connected in parallel to the DAPST. By controlling the series voltage<br>
seri^ the distribution of power flow can be controlled.<br>
The bold faced quantities in fig 5 represent phasors (with both a magnitude and a phase). Currents are represented with I and voltages with V.<br>
With this simple network, the operating range may be described in a diagram as indicated in fig 6, where the current through the DAPST is on the »axts and the series voltage \s on the y-axis.<br><br>
The left half plane corresponds to current (power) flowing from the second node 15 to the first node 14 (called import) and the right half plane corresponds to current (power) flowing from the first node to the second node (cailed export). The first and third quadrant correspond to a reduction of the magnitude of the current (power) whereas the second and fourth correspond to an increase of the magnitude of the current (power).<br>
A DAPST comprising a PST 1 and a CSC 2 comprising a plurality of switched units of which two are capacitive units 5a, 5b and one is an inductive unit 4 as indicated in fig 7. Such DASPT configuration may be operated in a purely Controllable Series Compensator (CSC) mode with the Phase-Shifting Transformer (PST) at zero tap position. This implies that only the short circuit reactance of the PST contributes to the series voltage.<br>
Fig 8 illustrates the operating range in purely CSC mode. Along the bypass line aii CSC steps are thyristor by-passed. The slope of the line depends on the short circuit reactance of the PST.<br>
Starting from the by-pass line, the magnitude of the voltage across the CSC decreases (if the sum of the PST short circuit reactance and the controllable reactance is inductive) or increases (if the sum of the PST short circuit reactance and the controllable reactance Is capacitive),. and the current through the DAPST increases by switching in capacitive steps. The operating point will thus move along lines parallel to the arrows in Fig 8 (the slopes of the arrows will depend on the size ofz   )<br>
towards the line corresponding to maximum capacitance. By giving the capacitive steps different sizes (e.g. binary sizes) and adding additional steps the resolution of control can be made arbitrarily high. The CSC will typically be dimensioned such that operation is only allowed for<br><br>
series voltages across the individual steps faeiow timits that are predetermined.<br>
Similarly, starting from the by-pass line, the voltage across the CSC is increased and the current through the DAPST is reduced by switching in inductive steps. The operating point will thus move along lines parallel to the arrows in Fig 8 towards the line corresponding to maximum inductance. When all inductive steps are switched in, the series voltage will decrease if the current decreases further.<br>
It can be noted that for low currents, the CSC is quite powerless as hardly any series voltage can be provided even if very large capacitive or inductive steps were available.<br>
With the CSC part thyristor by-passed (both capacitive and possibly inductive steps) the DAPST may be operated in a pure PST mode. The operating range may then look as indicated in Fig 9.<br>
The zero tap line is the same as the by-pass line in fig 8f I.e. its slope depends on the short circuit reactance of the PST. Starting from the zero tap line, the series voltage increases in the positive direction when the tap-changer is moved towards the most positive position and the magnitude of the series voltage increases in the negative direction when the tap-changer is moved towards the most negative position. It can be noticed that this PST has the ability to both decrease the power flow (first and third quadrant operation) and increase the power flow (second and fourth quadrant operation) as compared to the zero tap Sine, Furthermore, the PST has a substantial capability to control the power flow also at low current conditions.<br><br>
Fig 10 illustrates the DAPST steady state control range when both the PST and the CSC ranges are combined.<br>
With capacitive CSC steps, the operating range is extended in the second and fourth quadrants (corresponding to an increase of power flow) as compared to the pure PST mode. With the inductive CSC steps, the operating range is in a similar fashion extended in the first and third quadrants (corresponding to reduction of power) as compared to the pure PST mode.<br>
With dynamic operating range it is meant the part of the operating range that can be controlled fast enough to mitigate the consequences of electro-mechanical transients in a power system. As the thyristor controlled CSC easily can change operating point from maximum capacitive to minimum capacitive (or maximum inductive if inductive steps are available) and vice versa within a fraction of a second, it is well suited for contributing to e.g. damping of power oscillations originating from electro-mechanical oscillations in synchronous machines (generators). The PST on the other hand, where each step takes in the order of five seconds and each step must be sequentially passed, Is too slow to actively contribute in the transient period. In other words, the dynamic part of the operating range of he DAPST corresponds to the CSC part.<br>
A control apparatus comprising a PST 1, a CSC 2 and a control unit 3 and further comprising a shunt compensation means 25 Is shown in fig 13. A shunt compensation means may comprise a capacitor bank and a circuit breaker. When including capacitive shunt compensation into the control apparatus the DAPST may be given characteristics very similar to a controllable series capacitor, also in terms of reactive power balance, without the risk of e.g. sub-synchronous resonance.<br><br>
However, by controlling the tap-changer in the pre-disturbance situation the over-all characteristics of the DAPST can be changed. Fig 8 of course gives the dynamic range with the P5T in zero tap position.<br>
In Fig II the PST is in the maximum tap position. It can be noted that in the import situation (negative throughput currents), the DAPST has the whole dynamic range in the second quadrant, i.e. both capacitive and inductive steps provides fast control in the over-ail increase situation. Of course a similar feature can be achieved in the export situation by setting the PST in e.g. the minimum tap position, as indicated in fig 12.<br>
It is consequently possible to give the DAPST the possibility to dynamically both increase and decrease the power flow. The circumstance that this Is achievable with relatively small capacitive CSC units is a major advantage in systems with thermal production plants, e.g. nuclear power plants, with complex turbine strings. As is well-known installation of large series capacitors in such systems requires substantial analysis and adequate control means to avoid the risk of sub-synchronous resonance which may seriously damage the production units.<br>
As indicated in Fig 8, 10-12 the sum of the capacitive steps can be made larger than the short circuit reactance of the PST, In such over-al! capacitive situations, the DAPST produces reactive power independent of tap position. This is a major advantage for application of power flow control in power systems which are weak in terms of voltage support (e.g. at high load operating conditions).<br><br>
The main control objectives, i.e. the reasons for instaiiing a control apparatus, which may be denoted a dynamically controllable phase shift transformer (DAPST), include one or several of the following;<br>
•	Slow/quasi-steady state power flow control<br>
•	Power oscillation damping<br>
•	Improving transient performance through fast change of transmission corridor characteristics<br>
Slow/quasi-steady state power flow control is the slow control of the distribution of power between on one hand the transmission path in which the DAPST is installed and on the other hand parallel paths. The control speed requirements for meeting this objective are low enough to be satisfied by both the PST and the CSC parts.<br>
Power oscillation damping is the fast control of the DAPST to mitigate power oscillations typically following a disturbance in the power system. The frequency of these oscillations are typically in the range of 0.1 -2.0 Hz and depends to a large extent on the inertia constants of the synchronous machines (typically generators) or groups of machines participating in the oscillation. The control speed requirement to meet this objective can only be satisfied by the CSC part of the DAPST.<br>
By quickly, within a fraction of the transient period following a disturbance, changing the operating point of the CSC part of the DAPST, the character of the transmission interconnection on which the DAPST is installed can be changed. In its most capacitive position the total reactance of the interconnection is at Its minimum resulting in an increased power transfer over the interconnection and a reduced power transfer over parallel paths. In its most inductive position (or least capacitive) the total reactance of the transmission interconnection is at its maximum resulting in a reduced power transfer over the<br><br>
interconnection and an increased power transfer over parallel paths. In particular if several DAPST are installed and their controls are coordinated, the disturbed part of the system experiencing e.g. stability problems can quickly be relieved of power transfer whereas an intact part of the system picks up the power transfer. By having the capability to go between end positions within say less then 0.5 s after the disturbance occurs, the transient performance of the overall interconnected system can thus be significantly improved. The P5T part is too slow to act within this time frame however its pre-disturbance operating point will affect the overall character of the DAPST and thus the transmission interconnection.<br>
By coordinating the control of the tap-changer and the thyristors, it is also possible to include one or several of the following advantageous control objectives in the control strategy:<br>
•	Operation of the tap-changer at lowest possible current<br>
•	Smallest possible number of tap-changer operations<br>
•	Reactive power consumption control (limitation)<br>
•	Dynamic range control<br>
By controlling the DAPST at high current conditions such that the CSC part primarily acts first to reduce the current and then the PST part acts primarily at lower current conditions, the stresses on the tap-changer are relieved and the need for maintenance is reduced.<br>
By letting the CSC part be as fast as possible, and slowing down the PST part even more than It is by nature,, the number of tap-changer operations can be reduced. This is accomplished as changes in loading with short duration are handled by the CSC part and the PST part only acts on changes of longer duration.<br><br>
The PST part consumes reactive power due to its short circuit reactance, which only has a small variation due to tap-changer position as compared to the CSC which reactance has a substantially larger variation due to its nature. The CSC may as a consequence produce or consume a considerable amount of reactive power if all capacitive or inductive steps are switched in. As a(most the whoie operating range can be reached with different mixes of PST and CSC controi action the overall consumption or production of reactive power can be affected. If e.g. the power system for some reason is weak in terms of voltage support, i.e. the voltages are low it is advantageous to produce reactive power or at least limit the overall consumption of reactive power of the DAPST. If the desired series voltage can be achieved through the combined action of capacitive CSC steps and PST, as much CSC action and as little PST action is advantageous. If the desired series voltage only can be achieved through the combination of inductive CSC steps (if available) and PST action, as much PST action and as little CSC action is advantageous. Similarly, if the voltages are high it is advantageous to consume reactive power or at least limit the overall production of reactive power of the DAPST. Obviously the opposite control strategy is to be preferred, i.e. if the desired series voltage can be achieved through the combined action of inductive CSC (if available) and PST, as much CSC action and as little PST action is advantageous. If the desired series voltage only can be achieved through the combination of capacitive CSC steps and PST action, as much PST action and as little CSC action is advantageous. In addition it is possible to control the over all reactive power balance if means for reactive power shunt compensation is added to the DAPST as mention above.<br>
Yet another advantageous control objective is the controi of dynamic range at Sow current conditions. At low line currents the control range of the CSC part becomes small and even zero. By controlling the PST<br><br>
part such that there almost always is a minimum line current available, a minimum dynamic range is consequently also almost always available. There may be a short time period with low current when the power direction is changed from import to export, but this time period can be made very short by proper control of the tap-changer.<br>
A control scheme of a DASPT for controlling the power flow according to the invention is shown in fig 14. In the embodiment shown the DAPST comprises a PST and a CSC arranged on a power transmission line 10, a first closed loop 11 and a second closed loop 12. The first dosed loop comprises a sensor 13 for sensing the power flow on the line 10 between a first node 14 and a second node 15. Further the first loop comprises a first comparator 16, a PI (Proportional-Integrate) controller 17 and a second comparator 18,<br>
The measured active power flow,/*81, is compared with a set value,Pw, corresponding to the desired active power flow. A difference signal is sent to a PI controller with limits. The Pl-controSier creates a signal proportional to the required reactance which is sent to the thyristor control of the CSC, which by these means is controlled to satisfy the set value of active power flow. The discrete nature of the CSC will in most situations result in a control error which is handled through dead-bands (not indicated in the drawing).<br>
A supplementary signal for Power Oscillation Damping (POD) may be added after the PI controller such that fast electro-mechanical power oscillations can be mitigated by CSC action.<br>
The second closed loop for controlling the PST comprises a low pass filter 19, a comparator 20 and a Pi-controller 21. The signal proportional to the required reactance is sent through the low-pass<br><br>
filter 19 for comparison to a set value of the reactance, x . The low-pass filter will block variations of in x of short duration. The difference between the actual vaiue of x and the desired value x \s sent to a PI controller with limits which creates a signal proportional to the desired tap, i, which is sent to the tap-changer control.<br>
It is possible to achieve all control objectives listed above by application of the control scheme in fig 14.<br>
•	Slow/quasi-steady state power flow control is obviously achieved.<br>
•	Power oscillation damping is achieved by introduction of the supplementary POD signal.<br>
•	Fast change of transmission corridor characteristics can be achieved by quickly changing the set point Pm t possibly combined with changing the gain of the first Pl-controlier.<br>
•	Operation of the tap-changer at high current conditions is avoided in the following way. If the current suddenly increases, in particular into the overload range, the CSC will first act to reduce the current, and then at lower currents the PST will act to satisfy the set value x .<br>
•	The number of tap-changer operations is reduced by the introduction of a low-pass filter in the tap-changer control branch. This filter will block changes of short duration and thus reduce the number of tap-changer operations.<br>
•	Reactive power balance control (limitation) can be realized in at least two ways. By changing the set value x the reactive power balance can be controlled, and by introducing reactive power limits In the first Pl-controlier Umiter it can be limited.<br>
•	Control of the dynamic range at low current conditions can be accomplished by control of the set \/alue P™. By using a limit pniMh 
minimum control range, can be realized in steady state,<br><br>
Other control schemes can of course also be used to meet the control objectives.<br>
Although favorable the scope of the invention must not be limited by the embodiments presented but contain also embodiments obvious to a person skilled in the art. For instance the transmission line between the PST and the SCS must not be short as indicated in the accompanied figures but comprise any length as only the PST and the CSC is serially connected. The closed loop arrangement in fig 14 must not be fully closed. Thus it may under certain conditions be favorable for an operator or a customer to choose a desirable working point by direct adjustment of the tap changer of the PST. According to the invention the apparatus would automatically respond to such a forced control of the PST by adjusting the CSC correspondingly.<br><br><br><br><br>
