				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to coating compositions. More particularly, the present invention relates to a coating compositions based on, curable polyurethane material, coatings prepared therefrom, and methods of making the same.<br>
This application claims priority from provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/234,640, filed September 22, 2000 and is related to U.S. Patent Application Nos. 09/611,051 and 09/688,085, filed July 6, 2000 and September 22, 2000 respectively, which are Contuation-in-Part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/309,851, filed May 11, 1999, now U.S. Patent No. 6,248,225B1.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coating formulations find use in various Industries including the coating and/or painting of motor vehicles. In these industries, and in the automotive industry in particular, considerable efforts have been expended to develop coating compositions with improved performance properties. In the automotive industry, for example, numerous approaches have been advanced to achieve improved chip resistance and corrosion protection. These efforts have included, for example, applying up to 6 or more individually applied coating layers over the substrate by one or more coating methods.<br>
These coatings may be applied by either electrophonetic or non-electrophonetic coating methods. Electrodeposition has become increasingly important in the coatings industry because, by comparison with non-electrophonetic coating means, electrodeposition offers higher paint utilization, outstanding corrosion protection, low environmental contamination, and a highly automated process. Generally, cationic electrodeposited coatings provide better corrosion resistance than anionic electrodeposited coatings. Non-electrophonetic coatings, such as sprayable coatings, however, are still widely used throughout the coatings industry because of the relatively low equipment and operating costs associated therewith.<br>
•Such efforts have resulted in Increased protection of the surface of the substrate and reduced paint loss through chipping when the substrate of the vehicle is hit with solid debria such as gravel and stories. By reducing the difference in impact energy between multiple coating layers, It is believed that chip resistance of the overall coating can be Improved, especially for coatings in which the respective coating layers have excessive differences in hardness. It is believed that redu ring the hardness differential can lessen delamination between the coating layers such as between the undercoat, an intermediate coat, and a topcoat or an undercoat and an Intermediate coat<br>
Jn U.S. Patent No. 6,047,284, this differential is said to be reduced by applying a crosslinked polyurethane resin filler composition between coating layers to improve Intercoat adhesion The fillar composition includes a water-dispersible polymer derived from polylsocyanates, high and low molecular weight polyois, compounds reactive with the isocyanata, and monofunctional or active hydrogen-oontainIng compounds, Anhydrides of carboxylic aoids, such as trimelltic acid, are disclosed as useful to form the high molecular weight polyol The coating formulation is typically applied as an intermediate coat between the primer and the topcoat to even out irregularities present in th© primer, and Improve the overall stone-ohlp resistance of the coating.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 5,674,560, a chip resistant polyoielin type of primer Is spray applied over a cationic ojr anionic electrodapostted coated film before application of a soft Intermediate polyester film. The reduction of the differential in impact energy is reportedly maximized when the polyolefin primer is appfled oyer the softer anionic electrodepostted film as opposed to a catonic electrodepostted film.<br>
Even though electrophoretic coatings can provide many advantages over non-electrophoretic coatings. Improvements to each are still sought . because of the widespread use of both.<br>
Accordingly, the need exists for a polyurethane material useful In coating compositions that can and may be applied to the substrate by electrophoretic and non-electrophoretic coating methods.<br>

,     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Other than in the operating examples, or unless otherwise expressly specified, all of the numerical rarjges, amounts, values and percentages such as those for amounts of materials, times and temperatures of reaction, ratios of amounts, values for molecular weight (whether number average molecular weight (M) or weight average molecular weight (M), and others in the following portion of the specification may be read as If prefaced by the word "about even though the term "about" may not expressly appear with tee value; amount or ranee. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired.. properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very, .'east and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying<br>
ordinary rounding techniques, <br><br>
Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the fnventiori a'e approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found In their respective testing measurements. Furthermore, when numerical ranges of varying scope are set forth herein, it is contemplated that any combination of these values inclusive of the recited values may be used.<br>
Any numeric references to amounts, unless otherwise specified, am "by weight. The term "Equivalent weight* Is a calculated value based on the relative amounts of the various ingredients used in making the specified material and is based on the solids of the specified material The relative amounts are, those that result In the theoretical weight in grams of the material, like a polymer, produced from the ingredients and give a theoretical number of the particular funcotional group' thai is present in the resulting polymer. The theoretical polymer weight is divided by the theoretical number of equivalents erf urethane/urea g roups to give'the equlvalent.weight For example, urethane/urea equlvalent weight is based on the equivalents of urethane end. urea groups in the polyurethane/urea material.<br>
As used herein, the term Ipolymer" is meant to refer to oligomers and<br>
both hormopolymers and copolymers. Also, as used herein, the term<br>
"polyurethane material is meant'to include polyurethanes; polyureas, and<br>
mixtures thereof.	&gt;<br>
Also for molecular, weights, whether Mn or Mw these quantities are determined by gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene as standards as Is weii lonown to those skilled In the art and such as is discussed In U.S. Patent No, 4,739,018 at column 4, lines 2-45. which is Incorporated herein by reference in its entirety<br>
As used herein 'based on total weight of the resin solids" of the composition means that the amount of the component added during the formation of the composition is based upon the total weight of the resin solids (non-volatiles) of the film forming materials, polyurethanes, cross-tinkers, and polymers present during the formation of the composition, but not including. any water, solvent, or any additiye solids such as hindered amine stabilizers, photointtiators, pigments Including extender pigments and fillers, flow modifiers, catalysts, and UV light absorbers.<br>
As used herein, "formed from" denotes open, e.g., "oomprising," claim language. As such, It is intended that a composition "formed from" a list of recited components be a composition comprising at least these recited components, end can further corrjprise other nonrecited components during the composition's formation.<br>
As used herein, the term *cure" as used !n connection with a composition, e.g., "a curable polybrethane material", "a cured composition," shall mean that any crosslinkable components of the composition are at least partially crosslinked. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the crosslink density of the crosslinkabte components, i.e., the degree of crosslinking, ranges from 5% to 100% of complete crossJinking. In other embodiments, the crosslink density ranges from 35% to 86% of full crosslinking. In other embodiments, the crosslink density ranges from 60% to 85% of full crossllnking. One skilled In the art will understand that the presence and degree of crosslinking, i.e., the crosslink density, can be determined by a variety of meihojds, such as dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) using a TA Instalments DMA 2980 DMTA analyzer conducted under nitrogen. This method determines the glass transition temperature and crosslink density of free films of coatings or polymers. These physical properties of.a cured material are related to the structure of the crosslinked network.<br>
The average particle size can be measured according to known laser scattering techniques. For example, the average particle size of such particles Is measured using a Horiba Model LA 900 laser diffraction particle size instrument, which uses a helium-neon laser with a wave length of 633 nm to measure the size of the particles and assumes the panicle has a ephertcal shape, l.e., the kparticle size" refers to the smallest sphere that will Completely enclose the particle<br><br><br>
As used herein, "TOUGHNESS TEST METHOD" refers to test<br>
procedures for determining tensle properties of polymeric materials based<br>
upon a modified form of ASTM 4 D 2370-92, entitled "Standard Test Method<br>
for Tensile Properties of Organid Coatings" (1992), Incorporated by reference<br>
herein In its entirety. Relative to ASTM # 0 2370-82, The TOUGHNESS<br>
TEST METHOD provides for the preparation of flexible coatings that are<br>
cured at relatively low temperatures (less'than about 100°C) using a non-<br>
adhering substrate such as polybropylene, polyvinylfluoride, or Teflon™. A<br>
liquid coating is applied to the substrate (spray or wire bar) and te thereafter<br>
cured or aged. The coating is then cut into a ½ x 4" free film sample size,<br>
and peeled from the substrate. But for these modifications, the TOUGHNESS<br>
TEST METHOD" incorporates trie same testing procedures as ASTM # D<br>
2370-92	<br>

The heating is preferably only for a short period of time sufficient to ensure that s clear coating composition can be applied over the basecoat coating essentially without dissolving the basecoat coating. Suitable drying conditions depend on the components of the basecoat composition and on the ambient humidity, but generally the drying conditions are similar to those discussed above with respect to the primer coating.

During application of the clear coating composition to the substrate, ambient relative humidity generally can rang© from about 30 to about 90 percent, preferably about 80 percent to about 60 percent<br>
After application of the clear coating composition to the substrate, the composite coating can be at least partially dried by evaporating water and/or solvent from the surface of the film by air drying at ambient (about 25°C) or an elevated temperature for a period sufficient to dry the film. Preferabiy. the clear coating composition Is dried at a temperature and time sufficient to<br>
crosslink the crosslinkable components of the composite coating. Suitable drying conditions depend on the components of the clear coating composition and on the ambient humidity, but generally the drying conditions are similar to those disoussed above with respect to the primer coating. 'Also, multiple dear coating compositions can be applied to develop the optimum appearance. Usually between coats, the previously applied coat is flashed; that is, exposed to ambient conditions for about 1 to 20 minutes.<br>
A substantially uncured coating of the clearcoat/baseoaat composite or the topcoat/primer composite is formed on the surface of the substrate during application. Typically, the coating thickness after curing of the muttilayered baseooat/clearooat composite coating on the substrate ranges from about 0.5 to about 4 mils (about 15 to about 100 micrometers), and preferably about 1.2 to about 3 mils (about 30 to about 75 micrometers).<br>
After application of the dearcoating ortopcaating composition, the composite coating coated substrate is heated to cure the coating films or layers, in the curing operation, water and/or solvents are Evaporated from the surface of the composite coating and the film-forming materials of the coating films are crosslinked, The heating or curing operation is usually carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 160°F to about 360°F (about 71 oC to about 177°C) but if needed, lower or higher temperatures can be used as necessary to activate crosslinking mechanisms. The thickness of the dried and orosslinked composite coating l6 generally about 0.2 to 5 mils (5 to 125 micrometers), and preferably about 0.4 to 3 mlls (10 to 75 micrometers).<br>
In one embodiment, compositions including the poivfurethane material of the present invention may be used for electrodeposition coating. Such compositions can include an electroconductive pigment to make the resultant coating eiectroconductive upon curing, Suitable electrocotnductive pigments inciude electrically conductive carbon black pigments. Generally, the carbon blacks can be any one or-a blend of carbon blacks ranging from those that<br>
are known as higher conductive carbon blacks, i.e. those with a BET surface area greater than 500 m2/gram and DBP adsorption number (determined in accordance with ASTM D2414-93) of 200 to 600 ml/100 g, to those with lower OBP numbers on the order of 30 to 120 ml/100 gram such as those with DBP numbers of 40 to 80 ml/1 OOgrams.<br>
Examples of commercially available carbon blacks include Cabot Monarch™ 1300, Cabot XC-72R, Black Pearls 2000 and Vulcan XC 72 sold by Cabot Corporation; Acheson Electrodag™ 230 sold by Acheson Colloids Co.; Columbian Raven™ 3500 sold by Columbian Carbon Co.; and Printex™ . XE 2, Printex 200, Printex L and Printex L6 sold by DeGussa Corporation, Pigments Group. Suitable carbon blacks are also described in U.S. Patent No. 5,7334062, which is Incorporated herein by reference in Its entirety.<br>
Also, electricallyconductive silica pigments may be used. Examples include "Aerosii 200" sold by Japan Aerosii Co., ltd., and "Syloid 161",  . "Syloid 244", "Syloid 308", "Syloid 404* and "Syloid 978" made by Fuji Davispn Co., Ltd, Mixtures of different electroconductive pigments can be used.<br>
The amount of electroconductive pigment In the composition can vary depending on specific type of pigment that is used, but the level needs to be effective to provide an electrodeposHed coating with a conductivity of greater than or equal to lO'12 mhos/cm. Stated another way the etectrodeposftecf coating should have a resistivity of less than or equal to 1012 ohms-cm., preferably a resistance of less than or equal to 102ohms at typical film builds or thicknesses for etectrodeposited coatings. This level is necessary so tftat upon curing or partial curing the coating becomes eleotrooonductive. Preferably, curing is by heating at a temperature of at least 120"C (248°F). Typically, the electroconductive pigment content In the electrodepositable composition Is from 6 to 25 percent by weight based on total solids of the electrodeposltion composition-<br>
In the process of applying the electrically conductive coating, the aqueous dispersion of the efectrodeposltable composition is placed In contact with an electrically conductive anode and cathode. Upon passage cf an electric current between the anode and cathode, an adherent film of the electrodeposltable composition will deposit in a substantially continuous manner on either the anode or the cathode depending on whether the composition is anfcnically or cationically electrodeposltable. Electrodepasltion is usually carried out at a constant voltage in the range of from about 1 volt to several thousand volts, typically between 50 and 500 volts. Current density is usually between about 1.0 ampere and 15 amperes per square foot (10.8 to 161.6 amperes per square meter).<br>
Furthermore, a second efectrodeposftable coating that may, but need not, contain the pcryurethane material of the present Invention, may be applied over the first efectrodeposttton coating, described above, under the processing conditions described herein in order to provide a multiple layer ©lecirodeposited coating,<br>
Aferr electrodepositlon, the coating is at least partially cured, typically by heating. Temperatures usually range from about 200oF to about 400oF (about 93oC to about 204oC), preferably from about 250oF to 350°F (about 121oC to about 177oC} for a period of time ranging from 10 to 60 minutes. The thickness of the resultant film is usually from about 10 to 50 microns.<br>
The heating or baking cf the electrodeposited coating can also be performed by means of infrared radiation ('1R'). Generally, there are three categories of IR. These categories are: near-1R (short wavelength) having a peak \wavelength from 0.75 to 2.6 microns (u) (750 to 2500 nanometers); Intetmedlate-IR (madium wavelength) having a peak wavelength from 2.6 to 4 u (2600 to 4000 nanometers), and far-IR (long wavelength) having a peak wavelength from 4 to 1000 u (4000 to 100,000 nanometers). Any or any<br>
combination or all of these categories of IR can be used for the heating to at least partially cure the coating.<br>
Curing can be done In a selective manner. At least one predetermined area of the first etectrodeposited coating composition is selectively heated by IR, tor example, the exterior surfaces of an automobile body, where such predetermined area is to be coated with the second electrodepositable coating composition. The Interior surfaces of the eleotrocoated substrate are not exposed to the IR and as a result, the first eiectroceat coating is not cured on the interior surfaces and does not become electroconductive. Hence, the deposition of the second electrodeposlted coating layer is only on the exterior surfaces which are electrically conductive. With trite treatment, substrates like an automobile body have the cured, conductive, first electrodeposlted coating on exterior surfaces and the uncured, noncondutive, first electrodeposlted coating on interior surfaces, Upon application of the second electrodeposlted coating end curing of both electrodeposlted coatings, the exterior surface of the automobile body will have bath the first and second electrodeposlted coalings and good corrosion and chip resistance where it Is needed most The Interior surface will only have the first elecirodeposited coating and , corrosion resistance but no chip resistance. Since the Interior surfaces will not be exposed to road debris, chip resistance is not needed.<br>
When JR heating is used with complex shapes such as automobile bodies, It is preferable to dry the substrate coated with the first electrodeposited coating composition for 2 to 20 minutes, in a standard oven such as a convection, electric, or gas fired oven before exposing the etectrocoated substrate to IR. The drying step can be at a temperature sufficient to remove water but not sufficient to cure the coating such that ft becomes conductive. Generally, the temperature is less than 120°c.<br>
IR heating can be conducted from 10 seconds to 2 hours, usually from 5 to 20 minutes. Temperatures range from greater than 120°C to 220°C (248°F to 428oF) and preferably from 130°C to 18C°C (268°F to 374oF).<br>
The aqueous cattonic or anionic polyurethane dispersions are typical!/ eiectrodeposited on the electroconduciive coating from an electrodepositJon bath having a solids content of 6 to 50 percent by weight The bath temperature is usually about 15oC to 35*C. The voltage Is from 100 to 400 V (load voltage) using the substrate with the ejectroconductive coating as a cathode in the case of the cattonic polyuretharte or as an anode in the case of the anionic polyurethane. The film thickness of the eiectrodeposited coating is not particularly restricted and can vary largely depending upon the application of finished product, etc. However, the thickness is usually between 3 to 70 microns, particularly 15 to 36 microns in terms of cured film thickness. The baking and curing temperature of the coating film is usually from 100°C to 250oC and preferably 140°C to 200°C. As mentioned above in the case of the selective application of the second electrocoat through use of the IR bake of the first eiectrodeposited coating, tie heating or baking after application of the second electrccoat can cure both the first and second electrocoats on surfaces not exposed to IR heating or baking. Also, the baking can complete the cure of the first electrocoat that was exposed to IR and overcoated with the second electrccoat<br>

* available from OuPont de Namours Company, Wilmington, Delaware.<br>
The first three ingredients were stirred together In the given order. The pigments {items 4, 5 and 6) were added In small portions while stirring until a smooth paste was formed. The paste was then recirculated for 20 minutes through an Elger Minlmill at 2500 rpm with 2 mm zircoa beads. The final product had a Hegman rating of 7.5+.<br>
Example 10; Primer Coating Composition Using Polyurethane of Example 2<br>
A primer coating composition was made by mixing in order the<br>
following ingredients:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The pH of the coating was greater than 6.0. The viscosity was 30 seconds as measured on a #4 ford efflux cup at ambient temperature. The primer coating composition of this example (Sample A) was evaluated against a solventborne primer/surfacer {commercially available from PPG Industries Lacke GmbH as PPG-.73277) (Comparative Sample). . The test substrates were ACT cold roll steel panels electrocoated with a cationically electrodetepositable primer commercially available from PPG industries, Inc. as ED-6000, which are commercially'available from ACT laboratories of Hillsdale, Michigan. Both the primer coating composition of the present Invention.and the Commercial primer/'surfacer were spray applied (2 coats automated spray with 60 s'econds ambient flash between coats) at 60% relative humidity and 21CC to give a dry film thickness of 1.35 to 1.43 mils (33 microns to 36 microns). The panels were flashed tor 10 minutes at the ambient condition, and were then baked for 10 minutes at 80"C and then 30 minutes at 165'C. The panels were topcoated.with a silver basecoat and flashed for 5 minutes at the ambient conditions, and baked for 10 minutes at 80eC to give a film thickness of 0.S5 to 0.65 mils. The basecoat formulation used Is sold under the tradename HWJ3518F, commercially available from PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.<br>
The panels were then ciearooafed with a 2K clearcoat {commercially available from PPG Industries Cleveland as Part A TKV105QAR7 Part B WTKR20Q0B) and flashed for 10 minutes at ambient condition and then baked for 30 minutes at 165*C. The thickness of the clear coat was determined to be 1.8 /nils (40 microns).<br>
The appearance and physical properties of the coated panels were measured using the following tests: chip resistance (muttichlp) Was measured by the Erichsen chip method (PPG STM-0002 or Ford Test Method #Bl 157-06, without steps 3 and 4,2 x 2000 g, 30 psi) with a rating of zero being best Multichip by the GM Gravelometer (PPG STM-0744, or GM Test Method #GME 60-268, -20°C) with a rating scale of 0-10 with 10 being the best Monochip testing on the BYK-Gardner Monochip Tester (PPG STM-0823, or BMW Test Method BMW-PA15-1S3L RT and -20oC) wrth a rating of mm of pick-off from the point of Impact 8y "pick-off what is meant is the amount of delamination pulled from the sample by an adhesive. The test results are set forth below in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 1, trte substrate coated with the primer of the present Invention (Sample A) exhibited generally better chip resistance than the comparative solventbome commercially available primer surfacer (Comparative Sample),<br>
Appearance wasalso measured on the finished panels. Appearance was measured using the BYK-wavescan (commercially available from<br>
BYK-Gardner, columbia, Maryland) with data collected on the longwave and shortwave numbers. The Instrument optically scans the wavy, light dark pattern on the surface over a distance of 10 cm (4 In) and detects the reflected light intensity point by point The measured optical profile Is divided into long-term waviness (structure size 0.8-l0 mm) and short-term waviness (structure size 0.1-0.8 mm). Wavy structures with sizes between 0.1 mm and 10 mm are considered as orange peel or.microwaviness. Orange peel is observed as a wavy, light-dark pattern on a high gloss surface.. The type of structures that can be seen Is dependent on the observation distance: long-term waviness at distances of 2 to 3 m and short-term waviness at about 50 cm (original adhesion, usingASTM # D33S9-87). Adhesion was tested by making a Crosshatch grid and applying tape (Scotch 610) over the grid. The tape ts then pulled from the grid and examined for delamination. these results are fisted In Table 2.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The Crosshatch samples were then put into a humidity chamber (38°C, 100 percent relative humidity) for ten days (Chrysler Humidity Box) and tested again for adhesion in the same manner listed above. Both samples still past this test (i.e. there was no loss of adhesion).<br>
Example 10 (Sample A) was also applled via automated spray as" described above, to precoated Sine steel (USS Gah/aneaf) coated .with about 3-4 micrometers of Bonazinc 3001 zinc-rich epoxy pretreatment, which is commercially available from PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This substrate was not electrocoated. The same baseooat and clearcoat<br>
described above were applied in a simitar manner, The panels were tested along with the previously reported samples and In the same manner. The results set forth In Table 3 were observed:<br>
