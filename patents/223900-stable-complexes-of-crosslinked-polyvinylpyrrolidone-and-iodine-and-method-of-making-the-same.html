				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to an antimicrobial material<br>
which can be applied to minor wounds, cuts, abrasions and<br>
burns for the prevention of infections and for the<br>
promotion of rapid healing. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to complexes of polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
(PVP) and iodine. Even more particularly, the invention<br>
relates to complexes of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
and iodine capable of providing effective antimicrobial<br>
activity while at the same time avoiding wound irritation<br>
and retardation of wound healing. The invention also<br>
includes a method for preparing such complexes of<br>
crosslinked PVP and iodine. The invention further<br>
includes preparations, such as powders, gels and the like,<br>
which contain such complexes.<br>
2. Description of Prior Art<br>
Current antiseptic products are generally quite effective<br>
in reducing microbial counts in vitro, although many of<br>
them suffer from limitations inherent in their<br>
antimicrobial spectra and are readily inactivated by wound<br>
fluid/serum. Another major drawback of currently used<br>
antiseptic agents is the relative balance between their<br>
antimicrobial efficacy and their cytotoxic potential.<br>
When used in concentrations that exhibit adequate<br>
antimicrobial activity, they are generally irritating to<br>
wounds to varying degrees and/or retard wound healing<br>
significantly. Conversely, when used in concentrations<br>
which minimize or avoid irritation of wounds or<br>
retardation of wound healing, they either do not have<br>
sufficient antimicrobial activity in the first instance or<br>
their antimicrobial activity quickly dissipates to<br>
inadequate levels.<br>
Topical antimicrobial materials and preparations<br>
containing them have long been recognized as important<br>
parts of disinfection of intact skin and/or wounds.<br>
Antimicrobial materials used for this purpose represent a<br>
wide variety of chemical compositions including phenols,<br>
halogens, peroxides, quaternary ammonium compounds and<br>
antibiotics. These antimicrobial agents vary greatly in<br>
their effectiveness against different types of micro-<br>
organisms to which the skin or wound might be exposed.<br>
They also vary greatly in terms of their susceptibility to<br>
inactivation by contact with blood, serum or wound fluid<br>
as well as changes in pH or ionic environment. Many<br>
antimicrobial agents that show a wide effective range of<br>
biocidal activity are used for disinfection of inanimate<br>
objects such as hard surfaces and instruments but cannot<br>
be effectively used on skin or particularly on wounds<br>
because of the lack of wide differentiation between their<br>
biocidal effects on micro-organisms versus mammalian<br>
tissues.<br>
Iodine has long been recognized as an antimicrobial agent<br>
with outstanding effectiveness against a wide range of<br>
micro-organisms including Gram positive and Gram negative<br>
bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. It<br>
remains effective over a wide pH range and, unlike a large<br>
majority of other antimicrobial agents, it is not readily<br>
inactivated by proteins in the wound fluid/serum. Iodine<br>
readily penetrates microbial cell walls and is believed to<br>
exert its biocidal activity through a number of<br>
interactions including the following:<br>
1) Oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in enzymes and<br>
proteins;<br>
2) Inactivation by iodination of phenolic groups in<br>
amino acids and proteins;<br>
3) Iodination of basic -NH- groups in amino acids and<br>
nucleotides that serve as critical hydrogen bonding<br>
sites;<br>
4) Iodination of unsaturated lipids/fatty acids leading<br>
to membrane immobilization.<br>
As used in the art, the term "available iodine" refers to<br>
any form of iodine that has oxidizing capacity. Such<br>
forms are titratable with sodium thiosulfate and include<br>
elemental iodine, triiodide ion, hypoiodite ion, and<br>
iodate ion.<br>
In a typical aqueous iodine solution, e.g., a solution<br>
containing 2% w/v iodine (I2) and 2.4% w/v sodium iodide<br>
(NaI), the available iodine exists in several species in<br>
equilibrium with each other. These species include<br>
elemental iodine (I2), hypoiodic acid (HOI), hypoiodite ion<br>
(0I), hydrated iodine cation (H20I+), iodate ion [IO3] and<br>
tri-iodide ion [I3]. Most antiseptic formulations, and<br>
the aqueous environment of wounds to which they are<br>
applied, have a pH range of 3 to 9. In this pH range of<br>
3 to 9, the concentrations of hydrated iodine cation,<br>
hypoiodite ion, and iodate ion are so low that they can be<br>
essentially neglected. Tri-iodide ion readily dissociates<br>
into elemental iodine and iodide ion in highly diluted<br>
solution. Thus, the primary active species in highly<br>
diluted aqueous iodine solution are elemental iodine i.e.,<br>
I2, and hypoiodic acid, i.e., HOI, in equilibrium. The<br>
relative proportions of the two species depends on the pH<br>
and the available iodine content. Concentrations of free<br>
iodine as low as 0.5 to 2 ppm exhibit antimicrobial<br>
effect. The term "free iodine" refers to available iodine<br>
which is not bound to another chemical substance such as<br>
a polymer or surfactant.<br>
Tincture of iodine, which is a hydro-alcoholic solution of<br>
elemental iodine (I2) and sodium iodide (NaI) , is well<br>
recognized as a degerming antiseptic and has been in use<br>
for presurgical prepping of skin for over one hundred<br>
years. However, it is highly irritating, corrosive and<br>
toxic when in contact with a body cavity, mucus membranes<br>
or wounds. It also has other undesirable side effects<br>
that make it unsuitable for wound treatment. These<br>
include potential for occasional hypersensitivity<br>
reactions, skin staining and unpleasant odor.<br>
Major advances in utilizing the antimicrobial efficacy of<br>
iodine while minimizing its tissue toxicity and other<br>
undesirable side effects were made with the advent of<br>
iodophors. Iodophors are readily dissociable, loose<br>
complexes of tri-iodide or iodine with polymers or<br>
surfactants. Iodophors not only increase the solubility<br>
of iodine in aqueous media but reduce its chemical<br>
potential and vapor pressure, thereby reducing its<br>
undesirable side effects. The iodophors serve as<br>
reservoirs of iodine and function by slowly releasing<br>
iodine at the site of application. A well known and very<br>
widely used iodophor is polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine<br>
complex, which is also known as PVP-iodine. Since the<br>
term "Povidone" is an art recognized synonym for<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, it will be understood that the term<br>
I2, and hypoiodic acid, i.e., HOI, in equilibrium. The<br>
relative proportions of the two species depends on the pH<br>
and the available iodine content. Concentrations of free<br>
iodine as low as 0.5 to 2 ppm exhibit antimicrobial<br>
effect. The term "free iodine" refers to available iodine<br>
which is not bound to another chemical substance such as<br>
a polymer or surfactant.<br>

widely used iodophor is polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine<br>
complex, which is also known as PVP-iodine. Since the<br>
term "Povidone" is an art recognized synonym for<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, it will be understood that the term<br>
"Povidone-iodine" is synonymous with, and an alternative<br>
way of referring to, a polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine<br>
complex. Its available iodine content ranges between 9%<br>
and 12%. Spectroscopic studies by Schenck et al.,<br>
reported in Structure of polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine, J.<br>
Pharm. Sci., 68, p 1505-1509, 1979, indicate that<br>
Povidone-iodine consists of adjacent pyrrolidone units<br>
complexed with hydrogen tri-iodide rather than elemental<br>
iodine. Therefore, only two thirds of its entire iodine<br>
content constitutes available iodine. One third of the<br>
entire iodine in this complex is in the unavailable iodide<br>
form.<br>
Povidone-iodine is utilized in commercially available<br>
disinfectant products such as Betadine® and Isodine® that<br>
are widely used in hospitals for prepping of skin prior to<br>
surgery and as surgical scrubs and hand washes for health<br>
care personnel hand washes.<br>
Although they are useful for application to intact skin,<br>
iodophor solutions as well as most other topically<br>
effective antimicrobial preparations based on quaternary<br>
ammonium salts or chlorhexidine salts are not well suited<br>
for use on wounds. In these preparations, all of the<br>
antimicrobially active content is in solution and in<br>
direct contact with the wound. Furthermore, in order to<br>
be effective over an extended period of time, the<br>
concentrations of the active agents far exceed minimum<br>
inhibitory concentrations by several orders of magnitude.<br>
At these concentrations, the active agents exert<br>
cytotoxic, cytopathic or cytostatic effects on the wound<br>
tissue as well as on cells, such as fibroblasts, involved<br>
in the wound repair process. As a result, the wound<br>
repair process is significantly and undesirably retarded.<br>
Lineaweaver et al., Topical antimicrobial toxicity; Arch.<br>
Surgery, 120, p 267-270, 1985, found in human fibroblast<br>
tissue culture studies that no fibroblasts survived 24<br>
hours after a 15 minute exposure to 1% povidone-iodine, 3%<br>
hydrogen peroxide or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. These<br>
studies also showed that the cytotoxicity threshold<br>
concentration of soluble povidone-iodine was below 0.01%<br>
and above 0.001%. It was also found that re-<br>
epithelialization of full thickness dermal wounds on the<br>
backs of rats was substantially and statistically<br>
significantly inhibited at eight days after initial<br>
irrigation with 1% povidone-iodine or with 0.5% sodium<br>
hypochlorite.<br>
Rosso, in U.S. Patent No. 4,323,557, describes adhesives<br>
containing N-vinylpyrrolidone in the polymer backbone. In<br>
these adhesives, iodine complexing, monomeric units of<br>
vinylpyrrolidone are co-polymerized with other adhesive<br>
co-monomers. Therefore, the iodine complexing N-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone units in this polymeric adhesive are<br>
rendered water-insoluble. Pressure sensitive films with<br>
such adhesives can be complexed with iodine for providing<br>
its slow release. These compositions can be used as<br>
antimicrobial surgical drapes. However, they cannot be<br>
used on wound surface due to the risk of physical reinjury<br>
to the healing wound tissues from direct contact with the<br>
adhesive.<br>
Shih, in U.S. Patent No. 5,242,985, describes a complex of<br>
a strongly swellable, moderately crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and iodine. The composition is<br>
capable of releasing iodine substantially uniformly over<br>
a 6 hour period in the presence of water. Shih's complex<br>
is prepared by a method which employs a particular type of<br>
crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone described in his earlier<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,073,614. Shih defines narrower ranges<br>
for its characteristics (aqueous gel volume, Brookfield<br>
viscosity and crosslinker concentration) required for the<br>
iodine complex. Shin's iodine complexes are prepared by<br>
moistening the specific powdered crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone with a small amount of isopropanol or<br>
isopropanol/water mixture, mixing the moistened cross-<br>
linked polyvinylpyrrolidone with approximately 20%, based<br>
on the weight of the PVP polymer of iodine at room<br>
temperature, and then heating it at 45°C for 2 hours and<br>
then at 90°c for 16 hours. The resulting PVP/iodine<br>
complex is a light yellow, free flowing fine powder<br>
containing approximately 10% available iodine and<br>
approximately 5% iodide. The Shin complex releases its<br>
available iodine at a uniform rate over a six hour period.<br>
In view of this uniform rate of release, the concentration<br>
of soluble, available iodine at the wound site will exceed<br>
cytotoxic levels within a relatively short period of time,<br>
e.g., a few hours, after application of the Shih complex<br>
to a wound. This means that use of the Shih material<br>
will, at some point in time, undesirably result in wound<br>
irritation and/or retardation of wound healing. Those<br>
skilled in the art will also notice that nearly one fourth<br>
of the iodine used in the preparation of the complex<br>
described by Shih et al is unaccounted for and another one<br>
fourth is reduced to iodide. This strongly indicates that<br>
the starting polymer, i.e., crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, is partially oxidized by iodine<br>
during the preparation of the complex under the processing<br>
conditions used for iodination. Without wishing to be<br>
bound by any particular theory, it is thought that this<br>
partial oxidation may account for the observed uniform<br>
release pattern of available iodine into the aqueous<br>
environment. Although the compositions described in<br>
Shih's U.S. Patent No. 5,242,985 may expose wounds to<br>
lower initial iodine levels compared to conventional<br>
povidone-iodine, this lower initial level is expected to<br>
last for a relatively short time and, as indicated above,<br>
cytotoxic levels can be expected to be reached within a<br>
few hours.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been unexpectedly found that a stable, water-<br>
insoluble and water-swellable crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex prepared by an<br>
iodination process which differs from that disclosed by<br>
Shih in U.S. Patent No. 5,242,985 is capable of providing<br>
effective antimicrobial action on skin and wounds while at<br>
the same time avoiding wound irritation and retardation of<br>
wound healing. It has been further unexpectedly found<br>
that compositions containing the complex of the present<br>
invention actually promote wound healing, possibly by<br>
supplementing its non-cytotoxic nature with physical<br>
protection/cushioning and moist/non-desiccating<br>
environment offered by the hydrated and swollen polymer.<br>
The crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex of the<br>
present invention is water-insoluble but water-swellable<br>
and is capable of releasing iodine in an equilibrium<br>
controlled diffusion process which depends on the<br>
concentration of free iodine in the wound fluid to which<br>
the complex is applied. The concentration of free iodine<br>
in contact with the wound is maintained below the<br>
cytotoxic potential which irritates the wound and<br>
significantly retards the healing process. When this<br>
polymer complex comes in contact with the wound fluid, it<br>
becomes hydrated, swells and permits iodine to diffuse<br>
from the complex into the wound. As the concentration of<br>
the available iodine in the wound fluid increases at the<br>
wound complex interface, the rate of release of iodine is<br>
reduced until an equilibrium is reached between the iodine<br>
in the polymer complex and the iodine in the wound fluid<br>
in contact with the complex. Further release of available<br>
iodine from the polymer complex into the wound fluid is<br>
dependent on the rate of depletion of the iodine in the<br>
wound fluid which is in contact with the complex.<br>
One starting polymer which can be used in the preparation<br>
of the iodine complexes of the present invention is cross-<br>
linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, which the National Formulary<br>
calls "Crospovidone" and which is commercially available<br>
from, e.g., the ISP Division of GAF Corporation as<br>
Polyplasdone® XL. This polymer is capable of strongly<br>
complexing with iodine to form a stable water-insoluble<br>
but water swellable complex upon iodination at ambient<br>
temperatures with an aqueous solution of elemental iodine<br>
and a soluble iodide salt in which the molar ratio of<br>
iodide ion to iodine exceeds 1 to 1. This iodination<br>
process yields the polymer-iodine complex of the present<br>
invention without adversely affecting the starting<br>
polymer. Antimicrobial activity on the wound surface<br>
results from diffusion controlled release of iodine from<br>
the complex to the wound surface. The crosslinked PVP<br>
iodine complex of the invention has a broad spectrum of<br>
antimicrobial activity characteristic of iodine and<br>
povidone-iodine and is not readily inactivated by wound<br>
fluids. Crosslinked povidone-iodine complexes of the<br>
present invention can be used in a number of topical<br>
antimicrobial products such as powders, aerosol sprays,<br>
gels, creams, ointments, and water sensitive films. The<br>
crosslinked PVP-iodine complexes of the present invention<br>
can also be used for other microbial infections of the<br>
skin such as athlete's foot.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 is a conceptual comparison, in graphical forM, of<br>
the iodine release characteristics as a function of time<br>
of a conventional povidone-iodine solution (A); a<br>
composition according to U.S. Patent No. 5,242,985 (B);<br>
and a composition according to the present invention (C) .<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Example 1<br>
A crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone-iodine complex<br>
according to the present invention was prepared from a<br>
water-insoluble, water-swellable crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone available from the ISP Division of<br>
GAF Corporation as Polyplasdone® XL.<br>
Polyplasdone® XL is a water-insoluble, water-swellable<br>
synthetic crosslinked homopolymer of N-vinyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone. It contains not less than 11.0 percent and<br>
not more than 12.8 percent of Nitrogen (N) , calculated in<br>
the anhydrous basis, and meets the standards set for<br>
Crospovidone in National Formulary, Edition No. 18.<br>
"crospovidone" is the name which the National Formulary<br>
uses for crosslinked homopolymers of l-vinyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone. 1500 grams of water were mixed with 1433<br>
grams of an aqueous iodinating solution containing 1.27%<br>
by weight iodine (I2) and 3.0% by weight sodium iodide in<br>
a 4 liter beaker. The iodinating solution was 0.05 M with<br>
respect to iodine and 0.2 M with respect to iodide ion, so<br>
that the molar ratio of iodide ion to iodine was 4:1.<br>
120.8 grams of Polyplasdone® XL were added with stirring<br>
to the contents of the beaker at room temperature. The<br>
resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 5 minutes<br>
during which time the crosslinked povidone-iodine complex<br>
was formed. The crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine<br>
complex was recovered in moist form with the use of a<br>
vacuum filtration unit. After rinsing with a small amount<br>
of water, the moist filter cake was dried overnight at<br>
55°C ± 5°C, crushed to a free-flowing powder and further<br>
dried at 55°C ± 5°C to a constant weight. Available<br>
iodine content of the crosslinked povidone-iodine complex<br>
was measured by dispersing an accurately weighed amount of<br>
the complex in a large excess of iodine-free solution<br>
containing approximately 5% by weight of potassium iodide<br>
and titrating it with 0.02 Normal sodium thiosulfate. The<br>
complex was found to contain 17% available iodine. The<br>
available iodine content of crosslinked povidone-iodine<br>
complexes in accordance with the invention can be varied<br>
by changing the concentration of iodine in the iodinating<br>
solution and by changing the ratio of the amount of the<br>
starting polymer to the amount of the iodinating solution.<br>
It will be understood that other water soluble iodide<br>
salts such as potassium iodide and ammonium iodide can be<br>
used in place of sodium iodide in the iodinating solution.<br>
In all cases, the molar ratio of iodide to iodine in the<br>
iodinating solution must be in excess of l to 1. Molar<br>
ratios of iodide ion to iodine in excess of 3 to 2 are<br>
preferred and molar ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are most<br>
preferred.<br>
Antimicrobially effective, non-irritating crosslinked<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complexes of the present<br>
invention may have available iodine contents ranging from<br>
about 0.2% by weight to about 50% by weight. Preferably,<br>
the available iodine content ranges from about 2% by<br>
weight to about 30% by weight and even more preferably,<br>
from about 8% by weight to about 20% by weight.<br>
Examples 2-6<br>
Additional crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine<br>
complexes of the present invention were made according to<br>
the method described in Example 1 above. The amounts of<br>
crosslinked povidone ("povidone" is the pharmaceutical<br>
industry's nomenclature for polyvinylpyrrolidone), water,<br>
and iodinating solution for each different sample are<br>
shown in Table I. Also shown in Table I are the<br>
molarities of the iodinating solution as well as the<br>
available iodine content for each sample.<br>
The data presented herein for Examples 1 through 6 reflect<br>
experimental conditions and analytical results.<br>
Crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complexes of the<br>
present invention may also be made by a fluidized bed<br>
process in which the crosslinked povidone polymer<br>
particles are suspended in a gaseous stream into which the<br>
iodinating solution is injected and allowed to react with<br>
the polymeric material.<br>
Example 7<br>
An antimicrobial powder was prepared by mixing 89.895<br>
grams of the crosslinked povidone-iodine complex (in<br>
powder form) made according to Example 1 with 5 ug. of<br>
Aerosol OTB® (Sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate/sodium<br>
benzoate), 100 mg of Cab-O-Sil M-5® (a fumed silica<br>
powder) and 10 grams of Natrosol 250H® (hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose screened through 60 mesh) in a wide mouth<br>
cylindrical glass jar. The mixed materials were then<br>
blended for 5 minutes on a roller blender to yield a free-<br>
flowing antiseptic powder. This powder can be sprinkled<br>
on a wound site as an antiseptic and to promote wound<br>
healing.<br>
Sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate/ sodium benzoate a non-<br>
irritating surfactant, enhances the wetting of the<br>
crosporidone-iodine complex by the wound fluid and permits<br>
the release of iodine into the wound fluid.<br>
Concentrations of the sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate/sodium<br>
benzoate range from 1 ppm to 5% by weight. The preferred<br>
range is 10 ppm to 1% by weight of the antimicrobial<br>
powder and the most preferred range is 20 to 200 ppm by<br>
weight of the antimicrobial powder.<br>
Cab-O-Sil M-5® (fumed silica) serves to improve the flow<br>
characteristics of the powder to ensure ease and<br>
uniformity of application. Concentrations of<br>
Cab-O-Sil M-5® from 0.0001% w/w to 2% w/w may be used.<br>
The preferred range is from 0.001% w/w to 0.5% w/w and<br>
more preferred range is from 0.005% w/w to 0.2% w/w.<br>
Other flow additives including precipitated silica and<br>
dicalcium phosphate may be used in place of fumed silica.<br>
A hydrophilic polymer like Natrosol 250 H (hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose) improves the consistency of the crosslinked<br>
povidone-iodine applied to the wound by making it more<br>
cohesive, softer in consistency and by helping keep it<br>
moist on the wound surface. Concentrations of the<br>
hydrophilic polymer up to 75% w/w may be used. The<br>
preferred range is between 4% to 40% w/w and the most<br>
preferred range is from 8% w/w to 20% w/w.<br>
Example 8<br>
An antimicrobial powder was prepared using the procedure<br>
described in Example 7. The Example 8 powder had the<br>
following composition: 89.9 grams of the crosslinked<br>
povidone-iodine complex of Example 2; 5 mg. of Aerosol®<br>
OTB; 100 mg. of Cab-O-Sil M-5®; and 10 grams of Natrosol<br>
250 H. As can be seen by reference to Table I, the<br>
available iodine content of the Example 2 complex was<br>
7.5%.<br>
Example 9<br>
An antimicrobial gel dispersion containing 11.4 grams of<br>
the crosslinked povidone-iodine complex of Example 1,<br>
200 grams of propylene glycol, 1 gram methyl paraben,<br>
10 grams of Carbopol-974P NF; 1 gram NaOH, and 776.6 grams<br>
of water was prepared. The methyl paraben and the<br>
Carbopol-974P NF were dispersed in the propylene glycol by<br>
mixing for 20 minutes. 450 grams of water were then added<br>
to the dispersion and mixing was continued for 30 minutes<br>
until a uniform dispersion was obtained. The 11.4 grams<br>
of the complex of Example 1 were gradually added, with<br>
stirring, to the dispersion and stirring was continued for<br>
30 minutes. The pH was adjusted by adding 250 mis. of 0.1<br>
N NaOH solution. The remaining water was added to adjust<br>
the final weight to 1000 grams and stirring was continued<br>
for thirty minutes. The final pH was approximately 5.0.<br>
As mentioned earlier herein, the available iodine content<br>
of the complex of Example 1 was 17%. The available iodine<br>
content of the antimicrobial gel dispersion of this<br>
Example 9 was 0,2% by weight.<br>
The crossliked polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex of<br>
Example 2, the antimicrobial powders of Examples 7 and 8,<br>
and the gel dispersion of Example 9 were microbiologically<br>
tested using a modification of test methodology described<br>
in the FDA/OTC Tentative Final Monograph for First Aid<br>
Antiseptic Drug Products and were found effective against<br>
all three specified test micro-organisms. The test<br>
requires at least 99.9% reductions in the viable counts of<br>
Staph. aureus (ATCC 6538), Pseudomonas aerug. (ATCC 9027)<br>
and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) after contact for 10<br>
minutes in presence of serum. The results of this test<br>
demonstrate that the Example 2 complex and the Example 7,<br>
8 and 9 preparations are antiseptically effective.<br>
The antimicrobial powders of Examples 7 and 8 and the gel<br>
dispersion of Example 9 were also tested to assess their<br>
wound irritation and wound healing characteristics. The<br>
testing was conducted as follows:<br>
Preparation of animals: The tests were conducted on six<br>
to eight weaned, female crossbred swine. On day-0, the<br>
animals were anesthetized by inhalation of isofluorane.<br>
The skin was prepared by clipping the hair followed by<br>
shaving the remainder with a razor. The surgical field<br>
(paravertebral areas) was washed with an antimicrobial<br>
soap, rinsed with water and finally washed with alcohol.<br>
Proper aseptic technique was followed to minimize<br>
potential for exogenous infection.<br>
Preparation of wounds: On the prepared site, 20 to 30<br>
partial thickness wounds were made on the right and on the<br>
left paravertebral areas using a Castro-Viejo dermatome<br>
with wound dimensions of approximately 1 cm x 1 cm x<br>
0.5 mm.<br>
The wounds formed four quadrants of 10 to 14 wounds each.<br>
Hound treatments were assigned to each quadrant and<br>
rotated through the four quadrants using a latin square<br>
design so that each treatment would be at the same<br>
quadrant on two animals.<br>
Following hemostasis, the antimicrobial preparations of<br>
Examples 7, 8 and 9 were applied to the wounds in each<br>
quadrant according to the predetermined format. The<br>
wounds were covered with adhesive bandages which were<br>
changed daily. The test procedure utilized the following<br>
controls: adhesive bandage (A) , a commercially available<br>
antiseptic liquid containing 0.13% benzalkonium chloride<br>
(B) , a commercially available water soluble ointment<br>
containing 1% povidone-iodine (C) . The preparations to be<br>
tested were applied on two consecutive days (day 0 as well<br>
as on day 1). Only adhesive bandages on the wounds were<br>
changed on days 2, 3 and 4.<br>
Observations and evaluations: None of the wounds observed<br>
on a daily basis for five days following treatment showed<br>
inflammation, edema, infection or skin maceration. On<br>
day 5, following the evaluation, a representative sample<br>
was biopsied and the remaining wounds and the surrounding<br>
skin are surgically excised. The skin strips were<br>
incubated in 0.5 M NaBr solution for 24 hours at 37°C to<br>
facilitate separation of dermis from epidermis. Wound<br>
epithelialization was measured after separating the dermis<br>
from epidermis. The percentage of wounds completely<br>
epithelialized was calculated and compared with other<br>
treatments in the study. The results are shown below.<br>
As can be seen, the antimicrobial preparations of Examples<br>
7, 8 and 9 provided faster wound epithelialization than<br>
any of the controls.<br>
Example 10<br>
A water dispersible polymeric film containing the cross-<br>
linked povidone-iodine complex of Example 1 was prepared<br>
as follows. 40 grams of the complex of Example 1 were<br>
thoroughly blended with 20 grams of Carbowax 8000 (a<br>
commercially available polyethylene glycol), 20 grams of<br>
Polyox WSR N-80 (also a commercially available<br>
polyethylene glycol) and 20 grams of Methocel A-15C (a<br>
commercially available methyl cellulose). The blended<br>
materials were pressed between hot metal plates at 100°C to<br>
form a thermoplastic film. This film can be used as an<br>
antiseptic patch either alone or in combination with an<br>
adhesive pad or absorbent dressing.<br>
Although the examples described above are intended to<br>
illustrate the breadth of utility for the invention, they<br>
should not be viewed as limitations on the invention.<br>
Numerous additional applications, particularly in the<br>
field of wound care and skin care should be obvious to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Fig. 1 is a conceptual comparison, in graphical form, of<br>
the iodine release characteristics as a function of time<br>
of a conventional povidone-iodine solution (A); a<br>
composition according to U.S. Patent No. 5,242,985 (B);<br>
and a composition according to the present invention (C).<br>
It will be understood that it is virtually impossible to<br>
measure the concentration of iodine at the interface of a<br>
wound surface and a iodine-containing material, such as A,<br>
B or C, which has been applied to the wound. However, the<br>
concentration of iodine in wound fluid which results from<br>
the application of a conventional povidone-iodine solution<br>
(A) is, from the outset of application of the solution to<br>
the wound, considerably in excess of the Cytotoxic<br>
Threshold. This results in wound irritation and<br>
retardation of wound healing. The concentration of iodine<br>
in wound fluid which results from the application of a<br>
composition disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,242,985 is<br>
below the Antimicrobial Efficacy Threshold immediately<br>
upon application of the composition to the wound. After<br>
a period of time, the concentration of iodine exceeds the<br>
Antimicrobial Efficacy Threshold and is below the<br>
Cytotoxic Threshold. After the further passage of time,<br>
the concentration of iodine increases and eventually<br>
exceeds the Cytotoxic Threshold. This can be expected to<br>
likewise result in wound irritation and retardation of<br>
wound healing. As mentioned earlier, the release of<br>
iodine from compositions of the present invention is<br>
equilibrium controlled. Accordingly, the concentration of<br>
iodine in a wound fluid which results from the application<br>
of the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex of<br>
the present invention reaches, shortly after application,<br>
concentration levels which are above the Antimicrobial<br>
Efficacy Threshold and below the Cytotoxic Threshold.<br>
This means that compositions according to the present<br>
invention are antimicrobially effective but do not<br>
irritate the wound or retard wound healing.<br>
