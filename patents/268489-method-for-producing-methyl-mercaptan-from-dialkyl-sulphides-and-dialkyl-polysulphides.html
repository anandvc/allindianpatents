				<td>Method for producing methyl mercaptan from dialkyl<br>
sulphides and dialkyl polysulphides<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing alkyl<br>
mercaptan by reacting a reactant mixture comprising dialkyl<br>
sulphides and/or dialkyl polysulphides and optionally<br>
dialkyl ethers with hydrogen sulphide over heterogeneous<br>
catalysts.<br>
Methyl mercaptan is an industrially important intermediate<br>
for the synthesis of methionine and for the preparation of<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide and dimethyl sulphone. Methyl mercaptan<br>
is prepared predominantly from methanol and hydrogen<br>
sulphide by reaction over a catalyst consisting of an<br>
aluminium oxide support and transition metal oxides and<br>
basic promoters.<br>
In the reaction of methanol with hydrogen sulphide, at the<br>
typical reaction temperatures and using an economically<br>
viable hydrogen sulphide excess, the reaction equilibrium<br>
is such that dimethyl sulphide is always formed as well as<br>
methyl mercaptan. In addition to thioether formation, the<br>
reaction to give polysulphides (e.g. dimethyl disulphide)<br>
is also observed. These compounds are removed in the course<br>
of workup of the product gas stream. When no further<br>
economically viable utilization of these components is<br>
possible, the by-products are typically disposed of, for<br>
example by incineration or reaction with alkalis. This<br>
procedure lowers the overall selectivity of the preparation<br>
process for methyl mercaptan and hence the economic<br>
viability of the process. In this context, one alternative<br>
is the recycling of the sulphides or polysulphides into the<br>
process. When the sulphide level, according to US 2 81614 6,<br>
is kept sufficiently high by a recycling, the new formation<br>
of mercaptans from alcohols or ethers is suppressed. The<br>
process has the serious disadvantage that large amounts of<br>
sulphides have to be separated, condensed and, on recycling<br><br>
into the circuit, evaporated again. For this purpose, large<br>
amounts of heat and cooling energies are required.<br>
Typical catalysts which are used in industrial processes<br>
for producing methyl mercaptan from methanol and hydrogen<br>
sulphide exhibit high selectivities for the formation of<br>
methyl mercaptan and lead to a comparatively low evolution<br>
of dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide. A problem in<br>
this connection is that these compounds accumulate in the<br>
circuit when they are recycled into the process, since the<br>
catalysts used in the prior art can only poorly establish<br>
the equilibrium between methyl mercaptan and dimethyl<br>
sulphide. This means that, in each case, at most a quarter<br>
of the undesired newly formed sulphide is converted in the<br>
case of recycling into the circuit.<br>
As shown by DE-C 1193038, it is also possible to separate<br>
the sulphide and to convert it in a separate reaction step<br>
over a different catalyst to methyl mercaptan. However, it<br>
is necessary to select a high excess of hydrogen sulphide<br>
in order to achieve technically relevant conversions of<br>
dimethyl sulphide. DE-C 1193038 describes a process in<br>
which the sulphide formed, in an upstream reactor, together<br>
with the total amount of hydrogen sulphide required, is<br>
passed over a catalyst which efficiently establishes the<br>
reaction equilibrium between sulphide and mercaptan<br>
(precatalyst, e.g. MoO3/Al2O3). The reaction products<br>
obtained are subsequently, after addition of methanol or<br>
dimethyl ether, conducted over a main catalyst<br>
(K2WO4/Al2O3)over which the alcohol or the ether reacts with<br>
as yet unconverted hydrogen sulphide to give methyl<br>
mercaptan.<br>
As described in the abovementioned patent application, the<br>
separation of reaction product and hydrogen sulphide in the<br>
case of use of large hydrogen sulphide excesses is,<br>
however, found to be difficult.<br><br>
JP 58159456 relates to a methyl mercaptan process in which<br>
the hydrogen sulphide conducted in the circuit is mixed<br>
with fresh hydrogen sulphide, and the overall H2S stream is<br>
subsequently divided between a methyl mercaptan reactor and<br>
a DMS cleavage reactor. Upstream of the methyl mercaptan<br>
reactor, one H2S substream is mixed with methanol, while<br>
the second substream passes into the cleavage reactor with<br>
the DMS. The product streams of the two reactors are<br>
subsequently fed together to a product workup.<br>
US 2831031 discloses catalysts based on pyrophosphoric acid<br>
on titanium dioxide, over which dimethyl sulphide is<br>
converted to methyl mercaptan with a maximum selectivity of<br>
97% at a conversion of 42%. US 4005149 and JP 5246203<br>
describe aluminium oxides doped with cobalt molybdate or<br>
tungsten sulphide, with which dimethyl sulphide conversions<br>
of, respectively, 41 and 88% and, respectively,<br>
selectivities of 92 and 93% for methyl mercaptan can be<br>
achieved. Further catalysts claimed in US 4313006 are<br>
zeolites (X, Y, L) doped with sodium or potassium ions,<br>
with which maximum methyl mercaptan selectivities of 65%<br>
are achieved with a dimethyl sulphide conversion of 70%.<br>
JP 58159456 relates to aluminium oxides modified with<br>
phosphorus oxides and tungsten oxides, with which a maximum<br>
DMS cleavage conversion of 4 0% can be achieved. The<br>
H2S/DMS ratio in the reactant gas is 2 to 28 in the<br>
abovementioned applications. Preference is given to<br>
pursuing a high H2S/DMS ratio in order to achieve<br>
sufficiently high DMS cleavage conversions. US 4005149<br>
describes a process for catalytically cleaving organic<br>
sulphides with hydrogen sulphide in the presence of<br>
sulphactive catalysts. As a result of the addition of<br>
carbon disulphide to the reaction mixture, the overall<br>
conversion of sulphides to mercaptans can be increased. A<br>
disadvantage of this process is the use of toxic carbon<br>
disulphide in the process, which has to be separated again<br>
from the reaction products in a costly manner. Generally,<br><br>
in the cleavage of dialkyl sulphides to mercaptans with<br>
hydrogen sulphide, high selectivities for mercaptan and the<br>
maximum suppression of by-products are pursued. In<br>
contrast, the decomposition of (poly)sulphides to<br>
mercaptans, for example over aluminium oxides, without the<br>
addition of hydrogen sulphide, is characterized by<br>
comparatively low selectivities for methyl mercaptan and a<br>
broad spectrum of by-products. Mashkina et al. describe,<br>
for example, in React. Kinet. Catal. Lett., Vol. 70, No. 1,<br>
183-189, 2000, the decomposition of dimethyl disulphide to<br>
methyl mercaptan without H2S addition over acidic catalysts<br>
with maximum methyl mercaptan selectivities of 87%.<br>
According to Koshelev et al. [React. Kinet. Catal., Vol.<br>
27, No. 2, 387-391 (1985)] for the cleavage of dimethyl<br>
sulphide with hydrogen sulphide over γ-aluminium oxide, a<br>
maximum activity is achieved when the catalysts have a<br>
large number of aprotic Lewis acid sites and basic sites of<br>
moderate strength. The catalysts based on 3.5% Na2O/Al2O3<br>
described by Koshelev et al. exhibit, at a DMS conversion<br>
of 9.5%, however, only maximum methyl mercaptan<br>
selectivities of 82%, while methyl mercaptan selectivities<br>
of 97% with a conversion of 3 8% are achieved over pure<br>
γ-Al2O3.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an economically<br>
viable process, an apparatus and specific catalysts for<br>
preparing methyl mercaptan from dialkyl sulphides and/or<br>
dialkyl polysulphides and hydrogen sulphide.<br>
The invention provides a process for continuously preparing<br>
alkyl mercaptans by reacting a reactant gas comprising<br>
dialkyl sulphides and/or dialkyl polysulphides with an at<br>
least molar excess of hydrogen sulphide at elevated<br>
temperature in the gas phase and<br>
a) in the presence of a catalyst based on or consisting<br>
of Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, aluminosilicates, zeolites,<br><br>
bentonites or aluminas, which contain at least 1% by-<br>
weight of alkali metal oxide,<br>
b)	in a reactor which comprises at least n = 2 separate<br>
catalyst zones, wherein<br>
c)	the predominant portion or the total amount of the<br>
dialkyl sulphides and/or dialkyl polysulphides<br>
mentioned is introduced into the reactor into the<br>
first catalyst zone together with at least a portion<br>
of the total amount of the hydrogen sulphide used, and<br>
d)	the remaining amount of the hydrogen sulphide and of<br>
the dialkyl sulphides and/or dialkyl polysulphides is<br>
metered in between the catalyst zones.<br>
Alkyl means C1 to C5-alkyl, especially methyl. The poly-<br>
sulphides have generally 2 to 6 sulphur atoms.<br>
The process is preferably performed continuously.<br>
Preferred examples of dialkyl sulphides and dialkyl<br>
polysulphides which are reacted in accordance with the<br>
invention with hydrogen sulphide to give alkyl mercaptan<br>
are dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl<br>
trisulphide, dimethyl tetrasulphide and dithiapentanes.<br>
These (poly)sulphides may be metered into the process alone<br>
or in a mixture with dimethyl sulphide. It is also possible<br>
to meter alkyl ether compounds, for example dimethyl ether,<br>
to the reactant gas, said alkyl ether compounds being<br>
reacted with hydrogen sulphide to give methyl mercaptan.<br>
Equation (1) illustrates, using the example of the cleavage<br>
of dimethyl sulphide, that the reaction can be performed<br>
without formation of by-products. The aim of the invention<br>
is to perform the conversion to methyl mercaptan with a<br>
selectivity for the reaction product of greater than 98%.<br>
The formation of further by-products, for example carbon<br>
disulphide, should as far as possible be suppressed.<br><br><br>
Caused by the low exothermicity of the cleavage reaction,<br>
the preheated reactant gas mixture which comprises hydrogen<br>
sulphide and dialkyl (poly)sulphides can be converted to<br>
methyl mercaptan in an adiabatic reactor. The reactant gas<br>
mixture may also comprise dialkyl ethers or diaryl ethers,<br>
especially dimethyl ether.<br>
The molar ratios of hydrogen sulphide and the total amount<br>
of dialkyl sulphide and dialkyl polysulphide range from 3:1<br>
to 25:1, preferably 5:1 to 25:1, especially 10:1 to 25:1.<br>
The reaction is preferably performed in a reactor in which<br>
at least 2, especially 2 to 25, catalyst zones are<br>
connected in series. The catalyst zones may be configured,<br>
for example, as fixed beds or tube bundles filled with<br>
catalyst. Optionally, it is also possible for a plurality<br>
of individual apparatuses of this type to be connected in<br>
series. The reactant mixture comprising gaseous or liquid<br>
dialkyl sulphides and/or dialkyl polysulphides, hydrogen<br>
sulphide and optionally further components is metered into<br>
the reactor in such a manner that preferably the total<br>
amount of dialkyl (poly)sulphides, upstream of the first<br>
catalyst zone, is added with a portion which corresponds to<br>
at least the nth part of the total amount of hydrogen<br>
sulphide, while the remaining amount of hydrogen sulphide<br>
is metered in between the catalyst zones. Optionally, it is<br>
also possible to add the total amount of hydrogen sulphide<br>
upstream of the first catalyst zone.<br>
The product gas mixture can be separated by various known<br>
processes. A particularly advantageous separation is<br>
described in EP 0850923 B1, (US 5866721). Unconverted<br>
dialkyl sulphide or dialkyl polysulphide is recycled into<br>
the reactor.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the preferred embodiment of the reaction<br>
apparatus for cleaving dialkyl (poly)sulphides to<br>
mercaptans according to Claim 1. The gas comprising these<br>
compounds is referred to as reactant gas or reactant<br>
mixture and stems preferably from processes for preparing<br>
methyl mercaptan from hydrogen sulphide and methanol. In<br>
the reactor 1, n (n = 2-25) catalyst zones which consist of<br>
a distributor chamber and a catalyst bed are accommodated.<br>
Preference is given to using 3-10 catalyst zones. The<br>
reactant mixture 2 comprising the alkyl (poly)sulphides<br>
mentioned enters the first catalyst bed 8 through the<br>
distributor chamber 7. This first catalyst bed is<br>
optionally, in flow direction of the reactant gas, covered<br>
first with a bed of inert materials. For example, aluminium<br>
oxide spheres or ceramic Raschig rings may be used as inert<br>
materials. Downstream of the inert bed is disposed the<br>
catalyst bed. After leaving the first stage, the gas<br>
mixture is enriched in the distributor chamber 9 with<br>
hydrogen sulphide 10 or optionally the reactant mixture 2.<br>
The gas mixture subsequently flows out of the distributor<br>
chamber 9 into the second catalyst bed 11, and devices in<br>
the distributor chamber 9 ensure turbulent flow and<br>
complete mixing of the reactants which is distributed<br>
uniformly over the entire area of the second catalyst bed.<br>
The supply of hydrogen sulphide or optionally the reactant<br>
gas mixture is effected analogously at n - 1, preferably<br>
(where n &gt; 2) at n - 2, injection points between the<br>
downstream catalyst beds of the apparatus. Optionally, it<br>
is possible to dispense with a supply of hydrogen sulphide<br>
or reactant gas mixture upstream of the last catalyst bed<br>
at injection point 12 in order to obtain full conversion in<br>
the reaction. The last catalyst zone may optionally also be<br>
configured longer than the other zones in order to enable<br>
full conversion.<br>
The process is also characterized in that the reactant gas<br>
contains optionally at least 0.1% by volume, preferably 0.1<br><br>
to 10% by volume, especially 1 to 10% by volume, of<br>
hydrogen based on the total amount. These measures suppress<br>
the formation of oligomers and polymers. In addition,<br>
further secondary components, for example nitrogen, water,<br>
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonyl sulphide or<br>
dialkyl ether, may be present in the reactant gas.<br>
The dialkyl (poly)sulphides are converted to mercaptans<br>
preferably over catalysts comprising alkali metal oxides at<br>
a temperature of 100 to 600°C, preferably 150 to 450°C,<br>
especially 300 to 430°C, and a pressure of 1.5 to 50 bar,<br>
preferably 8 to 40 bar. The catalyst supports used may be<br>
silicates, titanium oxides, zeolites, aluminas, aluminium<br>
oxides and preferably 7-aluminium oxides. The supports have<br>
preferably been modified with alkali metal oxides such that<br>
the Lewis acidity, compared to the unmodified catalyst<br>
support, is reduced in a controlled manner while<br>
simultaneously increasing the Lewis basicity. Preference is<br>
given to using 7-aluminium oxides containing 1-50% by<br>
weight, preferably 2 to 20% by weight, of alkali metal<br>
oxide as catalysts. Preference is given to using<br>
7-aluminium oxides containing caesium oxide or rubidium<br>
oxide in the process according to the invention as<br>
catalysts. The catalysts are prepared, for example, by<br>
means of the impregnation of the catalyst support with<br>
suitable alkali metal salts, which are converted to the<br>
corresponding oxides by thermal decomposition. Preference<br>
is given to using alkali metal nitrates, carbonates or the<br>
alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids. The catalysts are<br>
subsequently dried and optionally calcined at temperatures<br>
of 50 to 600°C.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the catalyst comprises oxidic<br>
compounds of one or more transition metals of atomic<br>
numbers 21 to 80, especially of V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn,<br>
Zr, Nb, Mo or W.<br><br>
These metals may also be present in the form of phosphates<br>
or pyrophosphates.<br>
Before they are used for the first time, the catalysts are<br>
advantageously sulphidated in a hydrogen sulphide stream at<br>
a temperature of at least 100°C for at least 1 h.<br>
Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of the reactor according to<br>
Claim 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows the test results of the cleavage of dimethyl<br>
sulphide to methyl mercaptan in the presence of hydrogen<br>
sulphide over catalysts based on Rb20-γ-Al2O3, under the<br>
conditions of p = 9 bar and H2S/DMS = 14/1.<br>
Figure 3 shows the test results for the cleavage of<br>
dimethyl sulphide to methyl mercaptan in the presence of<br>
hydrogen sulphide in a reactor with two catalyst zones and<br>
H2S feeding upstream of the two catalyst zones in the<br>
presence of different catalysts.<br>
Example 1 shows, by way of example, the synthesis of the<br>
catalysts, while Example 2 describes the catalytic cleavage<br>
of dimethyl sulphide to methyl mercaptan.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of M2O-Al2O3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs)<br>
49.66 g of LiNO3 were dissolved in 300 ml of distilled<br>
water. The solution was heated to approx. 60°C, such that<br>
the salt had dissolved completely. 50 g of y-aluminium<br>
oxide were added to the solution with stirring. The<br>
solution was subsequently stirred for approx. 60 min. The<br>
catalyst was stirred at a temperature of at least 60°C,<br>
optionally under reduced pressure, until the complete<br>
amount of liquid had been absorbed into the support. The<br>
catalyst was dried under air at approx. 12 0°C overnight,<br>
and then calcined at 500°C in an air stream for 3 h.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The DMS cleavage was studied in a temperature range of<br>
100-500°C and a pressure of 1.5 - 25 bar. The ratio of<br>
hydrogen sulphide to dimethyl sulphide (DMS) in the<br>
reactant gas was varied in the range of 1:1 - 25:1.<br>
Before the start of the reaction, the fresh catalysts were<br>
first sulphidated in the reactor at 350°C for 2.5 h in a<br>
hydrogen sulphide stream. Figure 2 shows, for Rb2O-Al2O3<br>
(spheralite) a comparison of the dimethyl sulphide cleavage<br>
conversions to methyl mercaptan as a function of the<br>
temperature with classical "overhead feeding" (fixed bed<br>
reactor with one catalyst zone) and in "two-zone<br>
operation", i.e. the H2S stream, similarly to a staged<br>
reactor with H2S intermediate feeding, was fed in upstream<br>
of the two catalyst zones. In both cases, the total H2S to<br>
DMS ratio was 14:1. The space velocities and gas loadings<br>
were identical in both cases. Figure 2 illustrates that, in<br>
the inventive apparatus, over the catalysts which have been<br>
modified with alkali metal oxides and are claimed in this<br>
application, significantly higher DMS cleavage conversions<br>
can be achieved than in conventional "one-zone operation",<br>
for example in a conventional fixed bed reactor.<br>
Figure 3 shows the positive influence of the increasing<br>
Lewis basicity of the catalysts in the inventive apparatus<br>
in "two-zone operation". With Cs2O-Al2O3 catalysts, both in<br>
"one-zone" and "two-zone operation", significantly higher<br>
cleavage conversions were achieved than with catalysts<br>
based on Li2O-Al2O3. The overall selectivity for methyl<br>
mercaptan in all cases is 100%, i.e. no by-products were<br>
detected. Among other catalysts, Cs2O-Al2O3 catalysts with<br>
different Cs2O loadings were synthesized (5 - 10% by<br>
weight). As is evident to those skilled in the art,<br>
modification with regard to 7-Al2O3 source, performance of<br>
the impregnation, dispersion of the alkali metal oxides,<br>
porosity and BET surface area of the catalyst and<br><br>
performance of the catalyst conditioning or sulphidation<br>
can achieve even higher DMS cleavage conversions.<br>
The economic viability of the overall process depends<br>
crucially on the product selectivity for methyl mercaptan<br>
based on the carbon source used (e.g. methanol). It is<br>
evident from the above that sulphides, for example dimethyl<br>
sulphide, can be converted to methyl mercaptan with high<br>
yields, which increases the overall selectivity of the<br>
preparation of methyl mercaptan. A particular advantage of<br>
the invention is that dialkyl (poly)sulphides, which would<br>
otherwise have to be incinerated as by-products or disposed<br>
of in a costly manner, can be utilized in a technically<br>
simple and inexpensive transformation as a raw material for<br>
methyl mercaptan. Moreover, in the process according to the<br>
invention, no toxic carbon disulphide or other by-products<br>
are formed.<br>
The methyl mercaptan formed is removed from the product gas<br>
mixture together with the methyl mercaptan from the first<br>
process step (for example reaction of methanol with<br>
hydrogen sulphide), as explained in DE 1768826 (GB<br>
1268842), in several distillation and scrubbing columns at<br>
temperatures between 10 and 14 0°C.<br><br>
