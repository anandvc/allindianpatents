FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved bench scale pressure reactor system for<br>
chemical leaching of minerals at elevated temperature and pressure. More<br>
particularly the invention relates to an improved bench scale pressure reactor<br>
system in which various minerals and metals can be extracted at elevated<br>
temperature and pressure using the process of leaching.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Beneficiation is a variety of processes whereby extracted ore from mining is<br>
reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former being<br>
suitable for further processing or direct use. Beneficiation may be conducted via a<br>
range of techniques including crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation,<br>
gravity etc. Beneficiation enables operators to improve the quality of their end<br>
product and to enhance the overall processing performance of an ore. Accordingly,<br>
physical as well as chemical cleaning (beneficiation) processes have been explored.<br>
In physical cleaning, the mineral is crushed into suitable particle size, and the waste<br>
is removed in processes based on the differences in their physical properties. In<br>
contrast to physical cleaning, chemical processes involve addition of chemical which<br>
reacts with the mineral matter or waste and allow it to be easily removed. This<br>
includes mainly the process of liquid/solid extraction, also known as leaching,<br>
involves the transfer of a solute from a solid, generally employed in particulate<br>
form, to a liquid solvent which is termed as the "extract". In this process, the solid<br>
imbibes the solvent which<br><br>
dissolves the solute and thereby extracts it from the solid. Leaching is a very old<br>
process and a great diversity of apparatuses have been developed over the years<br>
to meet the varying requirements of the processes in respect to its widely<br>
diverse applications.<br>
Leaching processes have been proposed which operate in a batch, semi-batch or<br>
continuous mode, and both single-stage and multi-stage contacting techniques<br>
are used.<br>
Leaching equipment is commercially available for a wide variety of processes,<br>
including fixed-bed processes in which solvent is percolated through a stationary<br>
bed of solids, moving-bed processes in which the solids are conveyed through<br>
the solvent with little or no agitation, and dispersed-solid processes in which the<br>
solids are dispersed in the solvent by mechanical agitation. Among the many<br>
critical problems involved in the successful operation of a leaching process are<br>
those associated with the leaching of solid material which is often quite<br>
heterogeneous in character, and therefore exceedingly difficult to treat in an<br>
optimum manner.<br>
However, most of these reactors are operated at atmospheric pressure only and<br>
hence; there is a limit on temperature to which the material can be treated. In<br>
most of the cases the maximum temperature limit in such reactors are less than<br>
the boiling point of the liquid being used for leaching out the solid materials.<br>
Besides, when pressure is applied, uniform mixing of the slurry inside the<br>
pressure reactor becomes a difficult proposition because of inadequate provision<br>
or lack of stirring.<br><br><br>
U.S.Patent No. 6613271 discloses an apparatus and method for recovering<br>
valuable metals particularly gold using an in line leach reactor. This invention<br>
states about the apparatus and method for continuously separating a dense<br>
valuable material such as gold from a feed including a grinding mill which directs<br>
a crushed feed through hydrocyclones for separation into a light and dense<br>
fraction. The dense fraction is concentrated further by in line pressure jigs and<br>
the concentrate is leached in a rotating leaching reactor. The resulting pregnant<br>
liquor is subjected to electrowinning to recover gold and the spent liquor is<br>
recycled.<br>
U.S.Patent No. 4824939 discloses a novel leaching process which is useful for<br>
leaching a particulate solid material that comprises extractable and<br>
nonextractable portions. The process includes the steps of introducing the<br>
particulate solid material and a liquid solvent to an extraction zone; agitating the<br>
liquid solvent to a degree sufficient to suspend the particulate solid material and<br>
effect segregation of particles thereof in relation to their propensity to settle;<br>
maintaining contact between the liquid solvent and the particulate solid material<br>
for a time sufficient to leach extractable material there from: and selectively<br>
withdrawing particles from the extraction zone. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
leaching process is a multi-stage process employing a series of stages in which<br>
the selectively withdrawn particles from each stage are introduced to the next<br>
successive stage of the series.<br>
U.S.Patent No. 5993635 relates to a method of enabling a sulphide mineral<br>
composition to be leached at atmospheric pressure instead of above atmospheric<br>
pressure which has been hitherto required in order to achieve acceptable rates of<br>
leaching.<br><br>
The typical problems usually observed with the existing pressure reactors when the<br>
method is conducted near the boiling point of the solution being used for leaching,<br>
can be summarized as under:<br>
•	Substantial vapour generation at the top of the reactor,<br>
•	Precipitation of the solute/chemical because of substantial loss of vapour while<br>
releasing the pressure from the reactor,<br>
•	Entrainment of liquid chemical droplets with coal particles and carryover of these<br>
coal particles,<br>
•	Slugs of these droplets into the condenser circuit and pressure releasing valve,<br>
and<br>
•	Loss of substantial amount liquid and increase in final filtrate concentration.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention is to propose an improved bench scale<br>
pressure reactor system for chemical leaching of minerals at elevated temperature<br>
and pressure which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an improved bench scale pressure<br>
reactor system for chemical leaching of minerals at elevated temperature and<br>
pressure which enables evaluating and improving kinetics, thermodynamics and<br>
energy requirement of chemical leaching process.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an improved bench scale pressure<br>
reactor system for chemical leaching of minerals at elevated temperature and<br>
pressure which reduces slugging and solid carryover.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose an improved bench scale<br>
pressure reactor system for chemical leaching of minerals at elevated temperature<br>
and pressure which restricts the loss of liquid chemical and improves the<br>
concentration of the final filtrate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved bench scale pressure reactor system, in<br>
which substantially higher quantity of ore/minerals can be treated. This helps in<br>
optimization as well as scaling up the chemical leaching process at elevated<br>
temperature and pressure. In the present case, an example has been given for brief<br>
methodology to be followed for carrying out chemical leaching of coal using alkali<br>
and acid leaching method. However, the invented system can be used for<br><br>
chemical leaching process of various other minerals using any other inorganic<br>
chemical including acid and alkalis. This system can be used for evaluating data<br>
representing detail kinetics, thermodynamics and energy requirement for<br>
extraction of minerals using existing chemical leaching processes, and further for<br>
implementing new processes for extraction of other minerals using this leaching<br>
technique. Methodology, scientific background and few important test results<br>
using this system have been discussed in the subsequent sections.<br>
The invention addresses the problem of existing location of the compressed air<br>
inlet (pressure input point) of prior art, by optimally relocating the pressure input<br>
point so as to suppress slugging and solid carryover. A new control strategy has<br>
been adopted which enables determining the liquid-solid equilibrium and<br>
minimum filtrate concentrations to be maintained during the process-<br>
implementation.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A schematic diagram of the improved bench scale pressure reactor system for<br>
carrying out chemical leaching at elevated pressures and temperatures is shown<br>
in Fig. 1. The system essentially comprises a batch reactor of substantially equal<br><br><br><br>
to 5.0 litres capacity with heating and continuous mixing means; two condenser<br>
units, means for applying pressure at least up to 10 bar; and data acquisition<br>
and control means. The batch reactor (1) is of diameter ~ 7.0 inch and height ~<br>
10.0 inch, and having a conical bottom. The reactor (1) is made up of SS-316 or<br>
equivalent material. The feed materials are charged inside the reactor through a<br>
charging funnel (2) disposed at the top of the reactor (1) by opening a first valve<br>
(3). The products after completion of the reaction time are taken out by opening<br>
a second valve (4) located at the bottom of the reactor (1). Pressure can be<br>
applied inside the reactor (1) through an air inlet pipe (6) by opening a third<br>
valve (5). Pressure can be applied by using compressed air, nitrogen or argon.<br>
The inlet pipe (6) through which pressure is applied is having side arms (not<br>
shown) at different angles inside the reactor (1) and is extending up to the end<br>
of the cylindrical part of the reactor (1). The side arms and inlet pipe (6) are<br>
having perforations through which pressure is applied inside the reactor (1). This<br>
configuration helps in continuous agitation and mixing of the reactants inside the<br>
reactor (1). A plurality of baffles (not shown) are fitted at 60 degree angle at the<br>
entrance and exit points of the reactor (1) so that entraihment and carryover of<br>
the solid particles can be avoided. At least two numbers of shell and tube<br>
condensers (7) are fitted at the top of the reactor (1) in series as shown in Fig.<br>
1. The schematic diagram of the condenser (7) is depicted in Fig. 2. Either one<br>
or both the condensers (7) can be used at the time of implementing the process.<br>
Both the condensers (7) have a plurality of tubes (23) each inside the shell (24).<br>
Vapour flows through the shell side and cooling water flows (23) through the<br>
tube side. Water flow rate to the condensers (7) can be controlled by adjusting<br>
the position of a plurality of ball valves (8). All the pipe lines connected to the<br>
reactor system are of nearly 9 mm thickness. At least five numbers of<br><br><br>
thermowells (9) have been fitted at various locations in the pipelines to measure<br>
the temperature using a thermometer or RTD (10). The pressure inside the<br>
reactor (1) is controlled by control elements called solenoid valves (11), which<br>
act as ON-OFF control. At least two solenoid valves (11) are fitted after each<br>
condenser (7) for releasing pressure incase pressure inside the system becomes<br>
higher than the set point pressure. A pressure sensor (12) is connected at the<br>
middle of the at least two solenoid valves (11) to control the pressure inside the<br>
reactor (1). A separate line is taken out from the main line and mercury is filled<br>
in the extended pipe. The pressure sensor (12) is fitted after the mercury filled<br>
part so that the sensor (12) is not exposed to steam or vapour. This is important<br>
as the pressure transmitter (14) or sensor (12) should never be exposed to very<br>
high temperature. The reactor (1) is heated with two heating coils (13) of 1-<br>
kilowatt capacity each of which are fitted outside the circumference of the<br>
reactor (1). A Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) (10) is mounted inside the<br>
reactor (1) to indicate and control temperature. There are at least two heating<br>
coils (13) each of lkw capacity to raise the temperature inside the reactor (1).<br>
These two heating coils (13) are mounted on the circumference of the reactor<br>
(1), which are well insulated from the surrounding. The RTD (10) is connected to<br>
a first PID controller (16) through which the temperature inside the reactor (1)<br>
can be controlled using a relay switch (25) connected to the heaters (13). A<br>
second PID controller (15) is used to control the pressure inside the reactor (1).<br>
The pressure transmitter (14) sends the signal to the pressure controller (16)<br>
which in turns sends the signal to the solenoid valves (11) to open or close. A<br>
tank (17) half filled with water having measurement facility is placed at the<br>
pressure release outlet so that amount of non-condensable gas at the end of the<br>
process can be measured using water displacement method. There is a current<br><br><br>
sensor (18) to sense the amount of current passing through the "Live wire"<br>
which provides electricity supply to the at least two heating coils (13). The<br>
output from a data acquisition device (19) is sent to a host computer (20) for<br>
measuring the total cumulative energy consumption during the process using the<br>
calculations as mentioned below.<br>
Power (kwhr) = Power (kwhr) + Voltage (volt)* Current (ampere)<br>
Energy= (Power)* time<br>
The temperature, pressure and current data from data acquisition module (19)<br>
can be seen on the host computer (20) through a graphical user interface<br>
developed particularly for this system. The details of the microprocessor based<br>
interfacing for data acquisition is described later. The data acquisition modules<br>
(19), PID controllers, (15,16) current sensor (18) and batteries (21,22) are<br>
placed inside a panel. Schematic views of the pressure control arrangement and<br>
data acquisition and control means along with circuit diagram for the unit are<br>
shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 respectively.<br>
Different Sensors and Modules that were used during the process-<br>
implementation<br>
Sensors:<br>
RTD temperature Sensor (10):<br>
The RTD (10) is a sensor that operates on the principle that the resistance of a<br>
metal like platinum increases with an increase in temperature at a specific rate.<br><br><br>
The Resistance Temperature Detector is often selected when accurate<br>
temperature measurements are required. RTD's could be made of Copper, Nickel<br>
or Platinum. Currently, Platinum is the industry standard for the material use in<br>
making RTD's. As long as the temperature relationship with resistance is<br>
predictable, smooth, and stable, the phenomenon can be used for accurate<br>
temperature measurement. To ensure high accuracy, the resistance effects due<br>
to impurities must be small and the resistance versus temperature curve must be<br>
known and repeatable. Platinum RTD's are suitable for use from -50C to 550C,<br>
when long-term temperature stability and repeatability is required. They offer<br>
virtually a linear response over this range. The details of the two data acquisition<br>
module used in the present case is described below.<br>
The Pressure Sensor (12)<br>
The pressure sensor (12) is a sensor that operates on the principle of<br>
capacitance. It consists of a diaphragm and two parallel plates. An insulating<br>
fluid has been used to insulate the diaphragm from the reactor's vapour. Here<br>
mercury is used as insulating fluid because its density is higher than normally<br>
used fluid. It can sense pressure range from 0-100 kg/cm2. When the reactor<br>
pressure acts on the insulating fluid it transmit the pressure to the diaphragm<br>
which changes the capacitance between the two plates. And due to the change<br>
in capacitance a change in potential difference develops across the plates that in<br>
turn give rise a change in output voltage.<br>
The Solenoid valve (11)<br><br><br>
The solenoid valve (11) is the final control element in this process. It works on<br>
the principle of Magnetic Induction Effect and is consisting of a plunger and a<br>
coil. It operates in ON-OFF mode (i.e., at one time it is either ON or OFF). The<br>
operating voltage is 22-24 V dc. The moment voltage is applied the coil get<br>
energized and it pull the plunger inside. And as the applied voltage is removed<br>
the coil gets de-energized and releases the plunger to reach its original position.<br>
This effect is used to release and maintain pressure in side the reactor according<br>
to the control signal generated by the pressure controller.<br>
Modules<br>
1.	7520 Module (19)<br>

standard RS 232 to a 2 wire RS 485 interface. This module connects to all other<br>

2.	7017 Module (19)<br>
The 7017 (19) is a 8-Channel Voltage and 4-20mA Input Module. It takes in an<br>
analog input. Eight different inputs can be given to this module at a time at<br>

Bandwidth: 13.1 Hz<br>
Accuracy: 0.01% or better<br>
Methodology followed for chemical leaching of minerals in the bench<br>
scale pressure reactor system of the invention<br>
In the present case, an example has been given describing a brief methodology<br>
to be followed for carrying out chemical leaching of coal using alkali and acid<br>
leaching method with this pressure reactor system. Here, West Bokaro fine clean<br>
coal was taken as a feed sample for this process. The feed sample can be taken<br>
directly or can be crushed to desired size fraction for improving the kinetics of<br>
the process. This West Bokaro fine clean coal is referred as feed coal in the<br>
subsequent section of this write up and the clean coal produced from this<br>
process is referred as Product.<br>
Sample Preparation:<br>
200-300 gm of coal is taken through coning quartering method from the received<br>
West Bokaro fine clean coal. This coal sample is dried in an oven at 105°C.<br>
Chemicals:<br>
Commercially available sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in combination with sulphuric<br>
acid (H2SO4) and HCI were used in the present method.<br><br><br>
The treatment process<br>
The process for chemical leaching were carried out in the reactor assembly using<br>
two steps. In the first step, feed coals (200-300 gm) were treated with varying<br>
concentration of alkali (NaOH) (2-3 lit) at varying temperatures under different<br>
pressure conditions upto 10 bar for particular length of time in the reactor<br>
system described hereinabove. The treated coal is then washed repeatedly with<br>
water and/or HCI and then dried. Then, the treated coal is filtered, washed with<br>
water and dried before sending for their chemical, Theological and petrographical<br>
properties.<br>
The coal to slurry ratio can be maintained at 1:10 or 1:5 keeping the total<br>
volume 2-3 litres. The moment the feed is fed to the reactor (1), the heaters<br>
(13) are switched on and then the data acquisition means (19) is switched on.<br>
The readings are checked in the host computer (20) using the GUI to ensure<br>
proper working of the sensors. Once checked, the data are captured using the<br>
save command which saves the data to a text file. Pressure is applied inside the<br>
reactor (1) by opening the inlet valve (5) for pressure as desired for the<br>
particular process. The treated coal samples are collected at the end of the<br>
process only once pressure inside the reactor (1) is released. The sample can be<br>
washed with water and/or 10-20% HCI/H2SO4 solution. These samples are dried<br>
and analyzed for various properties. Multi-stage processes can also be carried<br>
out using the invented system. The detail work instructions for carrying out these<br>
experiments is given below.<br><br><br>

has ~ 14% ash content.<br><br>
With the development of the present bench scale pressure reactor system, the<br>
chemical cleaning process can be carried out at high temperature and pressure<br>
using a bigger size reactor with jacketed steam heating or electric heating<br>
arrangement as described above. Detail thermodynamic and kinetic study as well<br>
as energy requirement for this process can be evaluated using the bench scale<br>
unit. This will help in optimization as well as scaling up the chemical leaching<br>
process to commercial scale and low ash coal can be produced economically for<br>
coke making. However, this system can also be used for detail kinetics,<br>
thermodynamics and energy requirement studies for extraction of any other<br>
minerals using existing chemicazl leaching processes and also for development of<br>
new processes for extraction of other minerals using this leaching technique.<br><br>
