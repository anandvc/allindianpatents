				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
SEMICONDUCTOR CERAMIC MATERIAL<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor ceramic<br>
material having PTC characteristics.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Semiconductor ceramic materials for use in positive<br>
temperature coefficient thermistors have such PTC<br>
characteristics that the resistances thereof sharply<br>
increase when the semiconductor ceramic materials are heated<br>
to predetermined temperatures (Curie points). Known<br>
examples of such semiconductor ceramic materials having PTC<br>
characteristics include BaTiO; materials.<br>
[0003]<br>
The semiconductor ceramic materials need to be usable at<br>
elevated temperatures for applications such as thermistors<br>
for heaters. The following material is known: a (Ba,<br>
PbjTiO. semiconductor ceramic material, prepared by partly<br>
replacing Ba in BaTiO; with Pb, having a high Curie point.<br>
[0004]<br>
However,there is a problem in that a material of which<br>
the Curie point is increased by the addition of Pb as<br>
described above has a small temperature coefficient of<br>
resistance and the temperature coefficient of resistance<br>
thereof is voltage-dependent as described in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 56-169301<br>
(Patent Document 1). Therefore, the following material is<br>
demanded: a semiconductor ceramic material which contains<br>
no Pb, which has a high Curie point, and which is suitable<br>
for use in positive temperature coefficient thermistors.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, Patent Document 1 or Japanese Unexamined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 2005-255493 (Patent<br>
Document 2) discloses a (3a, Na, Bi, Ln)TiO:. semiconductor<br>
ceramic material (Ln is a rare-earth element) for use in<br>
positive temperature coefficient thermistors as recently<br>
known.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, an increase in Curie point tends to cause an<br>
increase in electrical resistivity. Therefore, compositions<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1 or 2 have a high Curie point<br>
of 120°C or higher and an electrical resistivity of about 70<br>
Q-cm, which is relatively large. Therefore, compositions<br>
having lower resistivity are demanded for use in thermistors<br>
for heaters.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0007]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
semiconductor ceramic material which contains no Pb and<br>
which has a high Curie point, low electrical resistivity/<br>
and PTC characteristics.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention is shown to a semiconductor<br>
ceramic material which is represented by the formula ABO-: and<br>
which has PTC characteristics, wherein A includes Ea, Ca, an<br>
alkali metal element, Bi, and a rare-earth element and B<br>
includes Ti. The semiconductor ceramic material contains 5<br>
to 20 molar parts of Ca per 100 molar parts of Ti.<br>
[0009]<br>
The content of Ca is preferably 12.5 to 17.5 molar parts<br>
per 100 molar parts of Ti.<br>
[0010]<br>
The content of the alkali metal element, the content of<br>
Bi, and the content of the rare-earth element are preferably<br>
selected such that a ratio of the content of the alkali<br>
metal element to the sum of the content of the bismuth plus<br>
the content of the rare earth element is from 1.00 to 1.06.<br>
[0011]<br>
The semiconductor ceramic material according to the<br>
present invention preferably further contains 0.01 to 0.2<br>
molar parts of Mn per 100 molar parts of Ti.<br>
Advantages<br>
[0012]<br>
In a semiconductor ceramic material according to the<br>
present invention, an A-site (Ba site) is partly replaced<br>
with Ca such that the content of Ca is 5 to 20 molar parts<br>
of Ca per 100 molar parts of Ti; hence, the electrical<br>
resistivity thereof can be reduced while the Curie point<br>
thereof is kept high. Therefore, if the semiconductor<br>
ceramic material according to the present invention is<br>
applied to a positive temperature coefficient thermistor, a<br>
large current can be supplied through the thermistor and<br>
therefore a high-power PTC heater can be obtained.<br>
[0013]<br>
If the content of Ca is selected within a limited range<br>
from 12.5 to 17.5 molar parts per 100 molar parts of Ti, the<br>
electrical resistivity can be further reduced.<br>
[0014]<br>
If a ratio of the content of the alkali metal element to<br>
the sum of the content of the bismuth plus the content of<br>
the rare earth element, is from 1.00 to 1.06, a good carrier<br>
balance and high rare of change in resistance can be<br>
obtained and PTC characteristics can be improved.<br>
[0015]<br>
When the semiconductor ceramic material according to the<br>
present invention further contains 0.01 to 0.2 molar parts<br>
of Mn, which serves as an acceptor, per 100 molar parts of<br>
Ti, acceptor levels can be formed at grain boundaries, rare<br>
of change in resistance can be enhanced, and PTC<br>
characteristics can be further improved.<br>
Erief Description of Drawings<br>
[0016]<br>
[Fig. 1] Fig. 1 is a graph showing the relationship<br>
between the content of Ca in a ceramic crystal in each<br>
evaluation sample prepared in Example 1, the length of the<br>
a-axis and c-axis of the ceramic crystal, and the axial<br>
ratio (c/a axial ratio) of the ceramic crystal, the a-axis<br>
and c-axis thereof being determined by X-ray diffraction.<br>
[Fig. 2] Fig. 2 includes illustrations prepared by<br>
tracing grain boundaries of ceramic crystals in SEM images<br>
of chemically etched surfaces of samples of sintered bodies<br>
obtained in Example 1.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0017]<br>
A semiconductor ceramic material, having PTC<br>
characteristics, according to the present invention has a<br>
composition represented by the formula ABO;. In the formula<br>
ABO;., A includes Ba, Ca, an alkali metal element (such as Na,<br>
K, or Li), Bi, and a rare-earth element (such as La) serving<br>
as a donor and B includes Ti. The semiconductor ceramic<br>
material contains two to 20 molar parts and preferably 12.5<br>
to 17.5 molar parts of Ca per 100 molar parts of Ti.<br>
[0018]<br>
In general, Ca is sometimes added to BaTi02<br>
semiconductor ceramic materials such that PTC thermistors<br>
have increased withstand voltage. This is because the<br>
addition of Ca allows fine grains to be formed and therefore<br>
results in an increase in withstand voltage. In other<br>
words, the addition of Ca allows fine grains to be formed<br>
and therefore is likely to result in an increase in<br>
electrical resistivity. Kence, the following advantage is<br>
not usually available: an advantage that the addition of Ca<br>
results in a reduction in withstand voltage as described in<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0019]<br>
When the composition of the semiconductor ceramic<br>
material according to the present invention is (Ba, Na, Bi,<br>
Ln)TiO3 (Na may be replaced with another alkali metal element<br>
and Ln is a rare-earth element), grains therein are fine.<br>
It has been found that the addition of Ca to the<br>
semiconductor ceramic material allows the grains to grow<br>
(see experiments below).<br>
[0020]<br>
Semiconductor ceramic materials having PTC<br>
characteristics have low resistance because grain boundary<br>
barriers are reduced due to spontaneous polarization in<br>
ceramic crystal grains. It has been found that the<br>
tetragonalinity of a crystal is increased, that is, the<br>
axial ratio (c/a axial ratio) of the crystal is increased in<br>
such a manner that Ba is partly replaced with Ca in<br>
accordance with the present invention. From this result, it<br>
can be inferred that an increase in spontaneous polarization<br>
reduces the grain boundary barriers to cause a reduction in<br>
resistance.<br>
[0021]<br>
In the semiconductor ceramic material according to the<br>
present invention, the content of the alkali metal element,<br>
the content of Ei, and the content of the rare-earth<br>
element, which serves as a donor, are preferably selected<br>
such that a ratio of the content of the alkali metal element<br>
to the sum of the content of the bismuth plus the content of<br>
the rare earth element, is from 1.00 to 1.06. This range<br>
provides a good carrier balance and high rare of change in<br>
resistance and can improve PTC characteristics.<br>
[0022]<br>
The semiconductor ceramic material according to the<br>
present invention preferably further contains 0.01 to 0.2<br>
molar parts of Mn, which serves as an acceptor, per 100<br>
molar parts of Ti. The addition of Mn allows acceptor<br>
levels to be formed at grain boundaries and allows an<br>
increase in rare of change in resistance and an improvement<br>
in PTC characteristics.<br>
[0023]<br>
SiO: is likely to react with Bi and Na to produce a<br>
glass component. Therefore, even if, for example, a major<br>
component is calcined and a mixture of the major component<br>
and SiC. is then fired, Na and Bi that remain without<br>
reacting during calcination are readily taken into glass<br>
during firing. This can result in a shift in the<br>
composition of a mother crystal to cause an increase in<br>
resistance. Therefore, in the case of adding SiO:, the<br>
content thereof is preferably 0.2 molar parts or less per<br>
100 molar parts of Ti.<br>
[0024]<br>
Experiments performed to determine the scope of the<br>
present invention and to confirm advantages of the present<br>
invention will now be described.<br>
[0025]<br>
[Experiment 1]<br>
The following powders were weighed and compounded such<br>
that compositions shown in Table 1 were obtained after<br>
firing: powders of BaCO1, CaCO1, Na:CO1, Bi2O3, TiO2, and La2O2<br>
that was a semiconducting agent that were raw materials.<br>
[0026]<br>
Each compounded powder mixture was mixed with an<br>
ethanol-based solvent for 24 hours using zirconia balls,<br>
dried by removing the solvent, and then screened with a #50-<br>
mesh sieve. The screened powder mixture was heat-treated at<br>
a temperature of 800°C to 1000°C for two hours, whereby a<br>
calcined powder was obtained.<br>
[0027]<br>
The calcined powder was mixed with vinyl acetate, which<br>
was used as an organic binder, poly(ammonium carboxylate),<br>
which was used as a dispersant, and water for 16 hours using<br>
zirconia balls. The slurry thereby obtained was dried and<br>
then screened with a #50-mesh sieve, whereby a source<br>
material for pressing was obtained.<br>
[0028]<br>
The source material was formed into a disk shape at a<br>
pressure of 1000 kgf/cni- using a single-shaft press, whereby<br>
a disk sample was obtained. The disk sample was debinded in<br>
air and then fired at a top temperature of 1250°C to 1400°C<br>
for two hours in a nitrogen atmosphere. This allowed the<br>
disk sample to have a diameter of 12 mm and a thickness of 2<br>
mm. The compositions shown in Table 1 were determined by<br>
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry<br>
(ICP-AES) analysis.<br>
[0029]<br>
Both principal surfaces of the disk sample fired as<br>
described above were polished with a piece of sandpaper.<br>
Ni/Ni-Cu alloy/Ag electrodes were formed on the polished<br>
principal surfaces thereof by dry plating, whereby an<br>
evaluation sample was obtained. The evaluation sample was<br>
evaluated for properties as shown in Table 1.<br>
[0030]<br>
The "electrical resistivity" of the evaluation sample<br>
was determined as follows: a direct-current voltage of 0.1<br>
V was applied to the evaluation sample at room temperature<br>
(25°C), the room-temperature resistance of the evaluation<br>
sample was measured by a direct current four-terminal<br>
method, and the room-temperature resistance per unit length<br>
of the evaluation sample was calculated, whereby the<br>
electrical resistivity thereof was obtained.<br>
[0031]<br>
The "PTC digit" of the evaluation sample was determined<br>
in such a manner that the evaluation sample was measured for<br>
resistance at 25°C and 250°C by the same method as that used<br>
to measure the room-temperature resistance thereof and the<br>
rate of change in resistance determined by the equation ?R =<br>
log(Rsec/R25) was used to express the "PTC digit" thereof,<br>
wherein ?R represents the rate of change in resistance of<br>
the evaluation sample, R2e represents the resistance of the<br>
evaluation sample at 25°C, and R250 represents the resistance<br>
thereof at 250°C.<br>
[0032]<br>
The "Tc (Curie point)" of the evaluation sample was<br>
defined to be the temperature at which the electrical<br>
resistivity of the evaluation sample doubled.<br>
[0033]<br>
[0034]<br>
As is clear from Table 1, Samples 4 to 9, in which the<br>
content of Ca ranges from 5 to 20 molar parts per 100 molar<br>
parts of Ti, have a high Curie point of 150°C or higher and<br>
an electrical resistivity of 30 O.cm or less. Samples 6 to<br>
8, in which the content of Ca is within a limited range from<br>
12.5 to 17.5 molar parts, have a particularly low electrical<br>
resistivity.<br>
[0035]<br>
In contrast, Samples 1 to 3, in which the content of Ca<br>
is less than 5 molar parts, and Samples 10 to 12, in which<br>
the content of Ca is greater than 20 molar parts, have an<br>
electrical resistivity of greater than 30 O.cm.<br>
[0036]<br>
The reason why Samples 4 to 9, which are within the<br>
scope of the present invention, have low electrical<br>
resistivity can be inferred as described below.<br>
[0037]<br>
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the content of Ca<br>
in each ceramic crystal, the length of the a-axis and c-axis<br>
of the ceramic crystal, and the axial ratio (c/a axial<br>
ratio) of the ceramic crystal, the a-axis and c-axis thereof<br>
being determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). With reference<br>
to Fig. 1, an increase in the content of Ca tends to<br>
increase the c/a axial ratio. This suggests that the<br>
ceramic crystal has strong ferroelectricity. Therefore,<br>
this advantageously acts on semiconductor ceramic materials<br>
having such PTC characteristics that spontaneous<br>
polarization causes a reduction in resistance; hence, the<br>
presence of Ca and an increase in the content thereof<br>
probably result in a reduction in resistance. The reason<br>
why a Ca content exceeding 20 molar parts causes an increase<br>
in electrical resistivity as shown in Table 1 is probably<br>
that this content exceeds the solubility limit of Ca.<br>
[0038]<br>
Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) are illustrations<br>
prepared by tracing grain boundaries of ceramic crystals in<br>
SEM images of chemically etched surfaces of sintered bodies<br>
obtained from Samples 1, 4, 9, and 11, which have a Ca<br>
content of zero, 5, 20, and 25 molar parts, respectively.<br>
[0039]<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates that the increase of the content of<br>
Ca from 5 molar parts to 20 molar parts allows the ceramic<br>
crystals to have a large grain size because of the growth of<br>
grains of the ceramic crystals. This suggests that the<br>
number of grain boundaries per unit thickness of a sintered<br>
body can be reduced by selecting the content of Ca within a<br>
range from 5 to 20 molar parts and this leads to a reduction<br>
in resistance.<br>
[0040]<br>
The sample, shown in Fig. 2(d), having a Ca content of<br>
25 molar parts contains a slight number of grown grains.<br>
White heterophases (indicated by hatched portions in this<br>
figure) are present at boundaries between these grains.<br>
This suggests that Ca precipitates at grain boundaries of<br>
ceramic crystals and this results in an increase in<br>
electrical resistivity.<br>
[0041]<br>
[Experiment 2]<br>
Evaluation samples were prepared and then evaluated in<br>
substantially the same manner as that described in<br>
Experiment 1 except that a Mn3Oj powder was prepared and then<br>
added to the above-mentioned calcined powders such that<br>
compositions shown in Table 2 were obtained after firing.<br>
[0043]<br>
Table 2 illustrates that although the addition of Mn<br>
tends to cause a slight increase in electrical resistivity,<br>
Samples 23 to 25, in which the content of Mn is 0.01 to 0.2<br>
molar parts per 100 molar parts of Ti, are not significantly<br>
increased in electrical resistivity and the PTC digit<br>
thereof can be increased to 4.0 or more without<br>
significantly reducing the Tc (Curie point) thereof. The<br>
increase of the PTC digit thereof is probably due to the<br>
fact that the addition of a predetermined amount of Mn<br>
allowed acceptor levels to be formed at grain boundaries of<br>
ceramic crystals.<br>
[0044]<br>
[Experiment 3]<br>
Evaluation samples were prepared and then evaluated in<br>
substantially the same manner as that described in<br>
Experiment 1 except that the ratio "Na/(Bi + La)" was varied<br>
in fired compositions as shown in Table 3.<br>
[0046]<br>
As shown in Table 3, Samples 33 to 36, in which the<br>
ratio "Na/(Bi + La)" is within a range from 1.0 to 1.06,<br>
have a larger PTC digit and can be improved in PTC<br>
characteristics as compared to Samples 31, 32, and 37, in<br>
which the ratio "Na/(Bi + La)" is outside this range.<br>
[0047]<br>
[Experiment 4]<br>
Evaluation samples were prepared and then evaluated in<br>
substantially the same manner as that described in<br>
Experiment 1 except that a Mn3O4 powder and a SiO2 powder<br>
were prepared and then added to the above-mentioned calcined<br>
powders such that compositions shown in Table 4 were<br>
obtained after firing.<br>
[0048]<br>
[0049]<br>
Table 4 illustrates that Samples 56 to 62, in which the<br>
content of SiO; is zero molar parts or 0.2 molar parts or<br>
less per 100 molar parts of Ti, have low electrical<br>
resistivity, a large PTC digit, and a high Tc. However,<br>
Sample 63, in which the content of SiO; is 0.3 molar parts<br>
per 100 molar parts of Ti, has high electrical resistivity<br>
and a small PTC digit.<br>
