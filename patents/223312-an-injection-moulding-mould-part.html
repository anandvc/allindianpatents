Injection wctvftAmfi Tnould part with wear-resistant coating<br>
The present invention relates to an injection moulding mould part comprising a base plate (minor) delimiting the injection mould cavity, around which a ring (vesting ring) that can be moved with respect thereto is arranged, which ring delimits within it an annular boundary surface of said injection mould cavity, which ring can be moved so as to reduce the volume of the injection mould cavity during injection moulding, the movable ring and the base plate being made of steel and at least one of the movable ring and the base plate being provided with a wear-resistant coating at the interface between said movable ring and the base plate,<br>
An injection moulding mould part of this type is generally known in the state of the art, The distance between the venting ring and mirror must be particularly small if not zero in order to prevent plastic getting in-between. However, the venting ring must move with respect to the mirror or base plate during each opening and closing movement<br>
To prevent wear, it is proposed in the state of the art to provide either the base plate or the venting ring with a wear resistant coating. This wear resistant coating is a PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) coating, such as a DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) coating.<br>
It has been found that this coating is adequately wear-resistant, but that it cannot be guaranteed that the PVD coatings which is a few microns thick, will continue to adhere to the steel after prolonged use.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a mxtror/venting ring combination with which a very large number of injection moulding cycles can be ensured without maintenance or replacement of components being necessary in lie interim*<br>
This aim is realised with an injection moulding mould part as described above wherein the wear-resistant coating comprises a coating based on tungsten with cobalt and has a thickness of at least 0.01 mm.<br>
According to the present invention, use is no longer made of a PVD coating a few microns thick. Instead of this, hard metal based on tungsten is used and the coating thickness is chosen to be appreciably greater, being at least 0.01 mm and more particularly at least 0.1 mm. More particularly, such a wear-resistant coating is applied to both the mirror and the venting ring. Experiments have shown that such a combination has a particularly long life and does not have the problems described above which are observed with PVD coatings.<br><br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the wear-resistant coating contains except from tungsten cobalt and nickel.<br>
The steel used for the roiiror and the venting ring preferably contains at least 10 % chromium and is, of course, hardened.<br>
Although the wear-resistant coating can be applied to the venting ring and/or the mirror in any manner known in the state of the art, according to an advantageous embodiment this is applied using the method with the so-called BYOF process. HVOF (High Velocity Oxygen Fuel) is a process with which a hard metal product is introduced into a gas stream, which is generated by combining oxygen and fuel in a chamber located upstream* This powder is entrained by the gas through a delivery tube and projected onto the workpieceÂ« The fuel used can be gas or liquid fuel, such as kerosene. Gas speeds of up to 3000 m/s are achievable. With such a process it is possible to apply both material based on tungsten and non-ferrous materials, such as types of bronze.<br>
According to the present invention, after applying the coating, the substrate treated in this way is finished by grinding in order to obtain the tight fit with the other component, being mirror or venting ring.<br>
Other methods for producing a hard metal coating are the application of hard metal foil and/or the use of hard metal sleeves. However it has been found that the bonding between the substrate and a hard metal is critical, and for this reason preference is given to Uie HVOF method described above. This adhesion is critical because of the close fit between the two intrinsically moving parts and the temperature fluctuations.<br>
The invention will be explained below with reference to an illustrative embodiment shown in the drawing. In the drawing;<br>
Fig. 1 shows, diagrammatically, an injection moulding mould in cross-section; and<br>
Fig 2 shows detail IE according to Fig. 1,<br>
In Fig. 1 an injection moulding mould is indicated by 1. This is in particular a mould for the injection of optical information carriers such as DVDs, CDs, etc. This mould must be fitted on an injection moulding machine. The mould consists of a mould part 3 and a mould part 2. Mould part 3 is provided with the ejector pin and the like, but this will not be discussed in detail below.<br>
Mould part 2 is coupled to the nozzle 4. On mould part 2 there is a mhxor 5, the mirror surface of which is indicated by 6.<br>
There is a venting ring 7 on the mirror 5. This ring is fixed to mould part 2 by means<br><br>
of bolts. There is a free space through which the venting ring 7 can be displaced with respect to the mirror 5 &gt; The inner ring surface of the venting ring 7 is indicated by 8.<br>
The mould cavity 9 is delimited by the mirror surface 6 and the part of the jacket surface 8 that protrudes beyond the mirror surface 6.<br>
The venting ring moves relative to the mirror 5 during each injection cycle. This occurs for a wide variety of reasons. One of these is the post-pressing of the plastic (stamping) so as to obtain better correspondence between the stamper and the part produced by injection moulding.<br>
The interface between the venting ring 7 and the mirror 5 is subjected to particularly severe stress. After all, the movement described above takes place during each cycle. The fit between the two parts must be close in order to prevent plastic material penetrating into the gap between them during injection.<br>
In older to prevent problems with regard to wear at the interface, it is proposed according to the present invention, as shown in Fig. 2, to apply a wear-resistant coating 13 and 12, respectively, to both the venting ring 7 and the mirror 5. This wear-resistant coating consists of a hard metal based on tungsten and is at least 0.1 mm thick. Apart from tungsten, nickel and cobalt, for example, are present as alloying elements. It has been &amp;uud that as a result of the use of such a wear-resistant coating there is stiU no damage or change in tolerance between venting ring 7 and mirror 5 even after many million cycles.<br>
The coatings 12 and 13 are preferably applied with the aid of the HVOF method.<br>
Although the invention has been described above with reference to a preferred embodiment; it will be understood by those skilled in the art that numerous variants are possible that are obvious after reading the above description and fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
