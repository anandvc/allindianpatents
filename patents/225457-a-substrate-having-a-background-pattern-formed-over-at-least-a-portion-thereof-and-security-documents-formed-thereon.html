Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods and systems for inconspicuously embedding binary<br>
data in security documents, and associated methods/systems for detecting/decoding such data. ("Security<br>
document" is used herein to refer to negotiable financial instruments (e.g. banknotes, travelers checks,<br>
bearer bonds), passports, visas, other immigration documents, stock certificates, postal stamps, lottery<br>
tickets, sports/concert tickets, etc.) One application of this the invention is in discouraging counterfeiting<br>
of security documents. Another is in transferring machine-readable information through such documents,<br>
without alerting human viewers to the presence of such information.<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
Digital watermarking (sometimes termed "data hiding" or "data embedding"; is a growing field<br>
of endeavor, with several different approaches. The present assignee's work is reflected in the patents and<br>
applications detailed above, together with laid-open PCT application WO97/43736. Other work is<br>
illustrated by U.S. patents 5,734,752, 5,646,997, 5,659,726, 5,664,018, 5,671,277, 5,687,191, 5,687/236,<br>

97/22206, WO 97/26733. Some of the foregoing patents relate to visible watermarking techniques. Other<br>
visible watermarking techniques (e.g. data glyphs) are described in U.S. patents 5,706,364, 5,689,620.<br>
5,684,885, 5,680,223, 5,668,636, 5,640,647, 5,594,809.<br>
Much of the work in data embedding is not in the patent literature but rather is published in<br>
technical articles. In addition to the patentees of the foregoing patents, some of the other workers in this<br>
field (whose watermark-related writings can by found by an author search in the INSPEC or NEXIS<br>
databases, among others) include I. Pitas, Eckhard Koch, Jian Zhao, Norishige Morimoto, Laurence<br>
Boney, Kineo Matsui, A.Z. Tirkel, Fred Mintzer, B. Macq, Ahmed H. Tewfik, Frederic Jordan, Naohisa<br>
Komatsu, Joseph O'Ruanaidh, Neil Johnson, Ingemar Cox, Minerva Yeung, and Lawrence O'Gorman.<br>
The artisan is assumed to be familiar with the foregoing prior art.<br>
In the following disclosure it should be understood that references to watermarking encompass<br>
not only the assignee's watermarking technology, but can likewise be practiced with any other<br>
watermarking technology, such as those indicated above.<br>
Watermarking can be applied to myriad forms of information. The present disclosure focuses<br>
on its applications to security documents. However, it should be recognized that the principles discussed<br>
below can also be applied outside this area.<br>
Most of the prior art in image watermarking has focused on pixelated imagery (e.g. bit-mapped<br>
images, JPEG/MPEG imagery, VGA/SVGA display devices, etc.). In most watermarking techniques, the<br>
luminance or color values of component pixels are slightly changed to effect subliminal encoding of<br>
binary data through the image. (This encoding can be done directly in the pixel domain, or after the<br>
signal has been processed and represented differently - e.g. as DCT or wavelet coefficients, or as<br>
compressed data, etc.)<br>
While pixelated imagery is a relatively recent development, security documents - commonly<br>
employing line art — go back centuries. One familiar example is U.S. paper currency. On the one dollar<br>
banknote, for example, line art is used in several different ways. One is to form intricate webbing<br>
patterns (sometimes termed "guilloche patterns") around the margin of the note (generally comprised of<br>
light lines on dark background). Another is to form gray scale imagery, such as the portrait of George<br>
Washington (generally comprised of dark lines on a light background).<br>
There are two basic ways to simulate grey-scales in security document line art. One is to change<br>
the relative spacings of the lines to effect a lightening or darkening of an image region. Fig. 1A shows<br>
such an arrangement; area B looks darker than area A due to the closer spacings of the component lines.<br>
The other technique is to change the widths of the component lines — wider lines resulting in darker areas<br>
and narrower lines resulting in lighter areas. Fig. IB shows such an arrangement. Again, area B looks<br>
darker than area A, this time due to the greater widths of the component lines. These techniques are often<br>
used together. Ultimately, a given region simply has more or less ink.<br>
In my application 08/438,159 I introduced, and in my application 09/074,034 I elaborated on,<br>
techniques for watermarking line art by making slight changes to the widths, or positions, of the<br>
component lines. Such techniques are further expanded in the present disclosure.<br>
In several of my cited patents, I discussed various "calibration signals" that can be used to<br>
facilitate the decoding of watermark data despite corruption of the encoded image, such as by scaling or<br>
rotation. (See, e.g., patent 5,832,119.) Common counterfeiting techniques - e.g. color photocopying, or<br>
scanning/inkjet printing — often introduce such corruption, whether deliberately or accidentally.<br>
Accordingly, it is important that watermarks embedded in security documents be detectable<br>
notwithstanding such effects. Calibration signals particularly suited for use with<br>
security documents are detailed in this disclosure.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a substrate having a<br>
background pattern formed over at least a portion thereof, characterized in that<br>
the pattern has a substantially uniform appearance to casual human inspection,<br>
but has localized luminance changes that represent machine readable multibit<br>
binary information, when subject to computer analysis, said pattern also<br>
representing a calibration signal.<br>
In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, security documents are encoded to<br>
convey machine-readable multi-bit binary information (e.g. digital watermarks), usually in a manner not<br>
alerting human viewers that such information is present. The documents can be provided with overt or<br>
subliminal calibration patterns. When a document incorporating such a pattern is scanned (e.g. by a<br>
photocopier), the pattern facilitates detection of the encoded information notwithstanding possible scaling<br>
or rotation of the scan data. The calibration pattern can serve as a carrier for the watermark, information,<br>
or the watermark can be encoded independently. In one embodiment, the watermark and the calibration<br>
pattern are formed on the document by an intaglio process, with or without ink. A photocopier<br>
responsive to such markings can take predetermined action if reproduction of a security document is<br>
attempted. A passport processing station responsive to such markings can use the decoded binary data to<br>
access a database having information concerning the passport holder. Some such apparatuses detect both<br>
the watermark data and the presence of a visible structure characteristic of a security document.<br>
The foregoing and other features and advantages of the present technology will be more readily<br>
apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying<br>

Detailed Description<br>
By way of introduction, the present specification begins with review of techniques for<br>
embedding watermark data in line art, as disclosed in my application 09/074,034.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the earlier-described technique employs a grid 10 of imaginary reference<br>
points arrayed over a line art image. The spacing between points is 250 microns in the illustrated<br>
arrangement, but greater or lesser spacings can of course be used.<br>
Associated with each grid point is a surrounding region 12, shown in Fig. 3. As described<br>
below, the luminosity (or reflectance) of each of these regions 12 is slightly changed to effect subliminal<br>
encoding of binary data.<br>
Region 12 can take various shapes; the illustrated rounded-rectangular shape is representative<br>
only. (The illustrated shape has the advantage of encompassing a fairly large area while introducing<br>
fewer visual artifacts than, e.g., square regions.) In other embodiments, squares, rectangles, circles,<br>
ellipses, etc., -.an alternatively be employed.<br>
Fig. 4 is a magnified view of an excerpt of Fig. 3, showing a line 14 passing through the grid of<br>
points. The width of the line, of course, depends on the particular image of which it is a part. The<br>
illustrated line is about 40 microns in width; greater or lesser widths can naturally be used.<br>
In one encoding technique, shown in Fig. 5, the width of the line is controllably varied so as to<br>
change the luminosity of the regions through which it passes. To increase the luminosity (or reflectance),<br>
the line is made narrower (i.e. less ink in the region). To decrease the luminosity, the line is made wider<br>
(i.e. more ink).<br>
Whether the luminance in a given region should be increased or decreased depends on the<br>
particular watermarking algorithm used. Any algorithm can be used, by changing the luminosity of<br>
regions 12 as the algorithm would otherwise change the luminance or colors of pixels in a pixelated<br>
image. (Some watermarking algorithms effect their changes in a transformed domain, such as DCT,<br>
wavelet, or Fourier. However, such changes are ultimately manifested as changes in luminance or color.)<br>
In an exemplary algorithm, the binary data is represented as a sequence of-1s and 1s, instead of<br>
0s and 1s. (The binary data can comprise a single datum, but more typically comprises several. In an<br>
illustrative embodiment, the data comprises 128 bits, some of which are error-correcting or -detecting<br>
bits.)<br>
Each element of the binary data sequence is then multiplied by a corresponding element of a<br>
pseudo-random number sequence, comprised of-Is and Is, to yield an intermediate data signal. Each<br>
element of this intermediate data signal is mapped to a corresponding sub-part of the image, such as a<br>
region 12. (Commonly, each element is mapped to several such sub-parts.) The image in (and optionally<br>
around) this region is analyzed to determine its relative capability to conceal embedded data, and a<br>
corresponding scale factor is produced. Exemplary scale factors may range from 0 to 3. The scale factor<br>
for the region is then multiplied by the element of the intermediate data signal mapped to the region in<br>
order to yield a "tweak" or "bias" value for the region. In the illustrated case, the resulting tweaks can<br>
range from -3 to 3. The luminosity of the region is then adjusted in accordance with the tweak value. A<br>
tweak value of-3 may correspond to a -5% change in luminosity; -2 may correspond to -2% change; -1<br>
may correspond to -1% change; 0 may correspond to no change; 1 may correspond to +1% change; 2<br>
may correspond to +2% change, and 3 may correspond to +5% change. (This example follows the basic<br>
techniques described in the Real Time Encoder embodiment disclosed in patent 5,710,834.)<br>
In Fig. 5, the watermarking algorithm determined that the luminance of region A should be<br>
reduced by a certain percentage, while the luminance of regions C and D should be increased by certain<br>
percentages.<br>
In region A, the luminance is reduced by increasing the line width. In region D, the luminance<br>
is increased by reducing the line width; similarly in region C (but to a lesser extent).<br>
No line passes through region B, so there is no opportunity to change the region's luminance.<br>
This is not fatal to the method, however, since the exemplary watermarking algorithm redundantly<br>
encodes each bit of data in sub-parts spaced throughout the line art image.<br>
The changes to line widths in regions A and D of Fig. 5 are exaggerated for purposes of<br>
illustration. While the illustrated variance is possible, most implementations will typically modulate the<br>
line width 3 - 50% (increase or decrease).<br>
(Many watermarking algorithms routinely operate within a signal margin of about +/- 1%<br>
changes in luminosity to effect encoding. That is, the "noise" added by the encoding amounts to just 1 %<br>
or so of the underlying signal. Lines typically don't occupy the full area of a region, so a 10% change to<br>
line width may only effect a 1% change to region luminosity, etc. Security documents are different from<br>
photographs in that the artwork generally need not convey photorealism. Thus, security documents can<br>
be encoded with higher energy than is used in watermarking photographs, provided the result is still<br>
aesthetically satisfactory. To illustrate, localized luminance changes on the order of 10% are possible in<br>
security documents, while such a level of watermark energy in photographs would generally be<br>
considered unacceptable. In some contexts, localized luminance changes of 20, 30, 50 or even 100% are<br>
acceptable.)<br>
In the illustrated technique, the change to line width is a function solely of the watermark tweak<br>
(or watermark/calibration pattern tweak, as discussed below) to be applied to a single region. Thus, if a<br>
line passes through any part of a region to which a tweak of 2% is to be applied, the line width in that<br>
region is changed to effect the 2% luminance difference. In variant techniques, the change in line width<br>
is a function of the line's position in the region. In particular, the change in line width is a function of the<br>
distance between the region's center grid point and the line's closest approach to that point. If the line<br>
passes through the grid point, the full 2% change is effected. At successively greater distances,<br>
successively smaller changes are applied. The manner in which the magnitude of the tweak changes as a<br>
function of line position within the region can be determined by applying one of various interpolation<br>
algorithms, such as the bi-linear, bi-cubic, cubic splines, custom curve, etc.<br>
In other variant techniques, the change in line width in a given region is a weighted function of<br>
the tweaks for adjoining or surrounding regions. Thus, the line width in one region may be increased or<br>
decreased in accordance with a tweak value corresponding to one or more adjoining regions.<br>
Combinations of the foregoing techniques can also be employed.<br>
In the foregoing techniques, it is sometimes necessary to trade-off the tweak values of adjoining<br>
regions. For example, a line may pass along a border between regions, or pass through the point<br>
equidistant from four grid points ("equidistant zones"). In such cases, the line may be subject to<br>
conflicting tweak values — one region may want to increase the line width, while another may want to<br>
decrease the line width. (Or both may want to increase the line width, but differing amounts.) Similarly<br>
in cases where the line does not pass through an equidistant zone, but the change in line width is a<br>
function of a neighborhood of regions whose tweaks are of different values. Again, known interpolation<br>
functions can be employed to determine the weight to be given the tweak from each region in<br>
determining what change is to be made to the line width in any given region.<br>
In the exemplary watermarking algorithm, the average change in luminosity across the security<br>
document image is zero, so no generalized lightening or darkening of the image is apparent. The<br>
localized changes in luminosity are so minute in magnitude, and localized in position, that they are<br>
essentially invisible (e.g. inconspicuous/subliminal) to human viewers.<br>
An alternative technique is shown in Fig. 6, in which line position is changed rather than line<br>
width.<br>
In Fig. 6 the original position of the line is shown in dashed form, and the changed position of<br>
the line is shown in solid form. To decrease a region's luminosity, the line is moved slightly closer to the<br>
center of the grid point; to increase a region's luminosity, the line is moved slightly away. Thus, in<br>
region A, the line is moved towards the center grid point, while in region D it is moved away.<br>
It will be noted that the line on the left edge of region A does not return to its nominal (dashed)<br>
position as it exits the region. This is because the region to the left of region A also is to have decreased<br>
luminosity. Where possible, it is generally preferable not to return a line to its nominal position, but<br>
instead to permit shifted lines to remain shifted as they enter adjoining regions. So doing permits a<br>
greater net line movement within a region, increasing the embedded signal level.<br>
Again, the line shifts in Fig. 6 are somewhat exaggerated. More typical line shifts are on the<br>
order of 3 - 50 microns.<br>
One way to think of the Fig. 6 technique is to employ a magnetism analogy. The grid point in<br>
the center of each region can be thought of as a magnet. It either attracts or repels lines. A tweak value<br>
of-3, for example, may correspond to a strong-valued attraction force; a tweak value of+2 may<br>
correspond to a middle-valued repulsion force, etc. In Fig. 6, the grid point in region A exhibits an<br>
attraction force (i.e. a negative tweak value), and the grid point in region D exhibits a repulsion force<br>
(e.g. a positive tweak value).<br>
The magnetic analogy is useful because the magnetic effect exerted on a line depends on the<br>
distance between the line and the grid point. Thus, a line passing near a grid point is shifted more in<br>
position than a line near the periphery of the region.<br>
(Actually, the magnetism analogy can serve as more than a conceptual tool. Instead, magnetic<br>
effects can be modeled in a computer program and serve to synthesize a desired placement of the lines<br>
relative to the grid points. Arbitrarily customized magnetic fields can be used.)<br>
Each of the variants applicable to Fig. 5 is likewise applicable to Fig. 6.<br>
Combinations of the embodiments of Figs. 5 and 6 can of course be used, resulting in" increased<br>
watermark energy, better signal-to-noise ratio and, in many cases, less noticeable changes.<br>
In still a further technique, the luminance in each region is changed while leaving the line<br>
unchanged. This can be effected by sprinkling tiny dots of ink in the otherwise-vacant parts of the<br>
region. In high quality printing, of the type used with security documents, droplets on the order of 3<br>
microns in diameter can be deposited. (Still larger droplets are still beyond the perception threshold for<br>
most viewers.) Speckling a region with such droplets (either in a regular array, or random, or according<br>
to a desired profile such as Gaussian), can readily effect a 1% or so change in luminosity. (Usually dark<br>
droplets are added to a region, effecting a decrease in luminosity. Increases in luminosity can be effected<br>
by speckling with a light colored ink, or by forming light voids in line art otherwise present in a region.)<br>
(Actually, production realities often mean that many such microdots will not print, but statistically some<br>
will.)<br>
In a variant of the speckling technique, very thin mesh lines can be inserted in the artwork -<br>
again to slightly change the luminance of one or more regions (so-called "background tinting").<br>
The following portion of the specification reviews a calibration, or synchronization pattern used<br>
in an illustrative security document to facilitate proper registration of the watermark data for decoding. It<br>
may be helpful to being by reviewing further details about the illustrative watermarking method.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7A, an exemplary watermark is divided into "cells" that are 250 microns on a<br>
side, each conveying a single bit of information. The cells are grouped into a "block" having 128 cells<br>
on a side (i.e. 16,384 cells per block). The blocks are tiled across the region being watermarked (e.g.<br>
across the face of a security document).<br>
As noted, the watermark payload consists of 128 bits of data. Each bit is represented by 128<br>
different cells within each block. (The mapping of bits to cells can be pseudo-random, sequential, or<br>
otherwise.) The 128 "0"s and "l"s of the watermark data are randomized into substantially equal-<br>
probability "l"s and "-l"s by a pseudo-random function to reduce watermark visibility. Where a cell has<br>
a value of "1," the luminance of the corresponding area of the image is slightly increased; where a cell<br>
has a value of "-1," the luminance of the corresponding area of the image is slightly decreased (or vice<br>
versa). In some embodiments, the localized changes to image luminance due to the +1/-I watermark cell<br>
values are scaled in accordance with data-hiding attributes of the local area (e.g. to a range of+/- 4 digital<br>
numbers) to increase the robustness of the watermark without compromising its imperceptibility.<br>
It should be noted that a single watermark "cell" commonly encompasses a large number of ink<br>
droplets. In high resolution printing, as is commonly used in security documents (e.g. 5000<br>
microdroplets per inch), a single watermark cell may encompass a region of 50 droplets by 50 droplets.<br>
In other embodiments, a cell may encompass greater or lesser numbers of droplets.<br>
Decoding a watermark requires precise re-registration of the scanned document image, so the<br>
watermark cells are located where expected. To facilitate such registration, a calibration signal can be<br>
employed.<br>
An exemplary calibration signal is a geometrical pattern having a known Fourier-Mellin<br>
transform. As described in patent 5,862,260, when a known pattern is transformed into the Fourier<br>
domain, and then further transformed into the Fourier-Mellin domain, the transformed data indicates the<br>
scale and rotation of the pattern. If this pattern is replicated on a security document that is thereafter<br>
scanned (as noted, scanning commonly introduces rotation, and sometimes scaling), the F-M transform<br>
data indicates the scale and rotation of the scanned data, facilitating virtual re-registration of the security<br>
document image for watermark detection.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7B, an illustrative geometrical calibration pattern is a block, 3.2 cm on a side.<br>
The block comprises a 16 x 16 array of substantially identical tiles, each 2 mm on a side. Each tile, in<br>
term, comprises an 8 x 8 array of component cells.<br>
As described below, the geometrical calibration pattern in the illustrated embodiment is a visible<br>
design feature on the security document. Accordingly, unlike the watermark data, the calibration pattern<br>
does not have to be limited to a small range of digital numbers in order to keep it substantially hidden<br>
among other features of the document. Also unlike the watermark data, the illustrated calibration pattern<br>
is not locally scaled in accordance with data hiding attributes of the security document image.<br>
It is possible to print rectangular grids of grey-scaled ink on a document to serve as a calibration<br>
pattern. However, aesthetic considerations usually discourage doing so. Preferable is to realize the<br>
calibration pattern in a more traditional art form, such as a seemingly random series of intertwining lines,<br>
forming a weave-like pattern that is printed across part or all of the document.<br>
To create this weave-like calibration pattern, a designer first defines an 8 x 8 cell reference<br>
calibration tile. Each cell in the tile is assigned a grey-scale value. In the illustrated embodiment, values<br>
within 2-10 percent of each other are used, although this is not essential. An exemplary reference<br>
calibration tile is shown in Fig. 8 (assuming 8-bit quantization).<br>
The Fourier-Mellin transform of a block derived from this reference calibration tile will serve as<br>
the key by which the scale and rotation of a scanned security document image are determined.<br>
There is some optimization that may be done in selecting/designing the pattern of grey-scale<br>
values that define the reference calibration tile. The pattern should have a F-M transform that is readily<br>
distinguished from those of other design and watermark elements on the security document. One design<br>
procedure effects a trial F-M transform of the rest of the security document design, and works backwards<br>
from this data to select a reference calibration tile that is readily distinguishable.<br>
Once a reference tile pattern is selected, the next steps iteratively define a tile having a weave-<br>
like pattern whose local luminance values approximately match the reference tile's grey-scale pattern.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9A, the first such step is to select points on the bottom and left side edges of<br>
the tile where lines are to cross the tile boundaries. The angles at which the lines cross these boundaries<br>
are also selected. (In the illustrated embodiment, these points and angles are selected arbitrarily, although<br>
in other embodiments, the choices can be made in conformance with an optimizing design procedure.)<br>
The selected points and angles are then replicated on the corresponding right and top edges of<br>
the tile. By this arrangement, lines exiting the top of one tile seamlessly enter the bottom of the adjoining<br>
tile at the same angle. Likewise, lines exiting either side of a tile seamlessly join with lines in the<br>
laterally adjoining blocks.<br>
The designer next establishes trial line paths snaking through the tile (Figs. 9B, 9C), linking<br>
arbitrarily matched pairs of points on the tile's edges. (These snaking paths are sometimes termed<br>
"worms.") Desirably, these paths pass through each of the 64 component cells forming the tile, with the<br>
total path length through each cell being within +/- 30% of the average path length through all cells.<br>
(This trial routing can be performed with pencil and paper, but more commonly is done on a computer<br>
graphics station, with a mouse, light pen, or other input device being manipulated by the designer to<br>
establish the routing.) In the illustrated embodiment, the lines have a width of about 30 - 100 microns,<br>
and an average spacing between lines of about 100 - 400 microns, although these parameters are not<br>
critical.<br>
Turning next to Fig. 10, the trial tile is assembled with like tiles to form a 16 x 16 trial block (3.;<br>
cm on a side), with a repetitive weave pattern formed by replication of the line pattern defined on the 8 x<br>
8 cell trial tile. This trial block is then converted into grey-scale values. The conversion can be done by<br>
scanning a printed representation of the trial block, or by computer analysis of the line lengths and<br>
positions. The output is a 128 x 128 array of grey-scale values, each value corresponding to the<br>
luminance of a 250 micron cell within the trial block.<br>
This grey-scale data is compared with grey-scale data provided by assembling 256 of the<br>
reference calibration tiles (each an 8 x 8 array of cells) into a 16 x 16 calibration pattern block. In<br>
particular, the grey-scale array resulting from the trial block is subtracted from the grey-scale array<br>
resulting from the reference block, generating a 128 x 128 array of error values. This error data is used<br>
to tweak the arrangement of lines in the trial block.<br>
In cells of the trial calibration block where the error value is positive, the line is too long. That<br>
is, the pattern is too dark in those cells (i.e. it has a low luminance grey-scale value), due to a surplus of<br>
line length (i.e. too much ink). By shortening the line length in those cells, their luminance is increased<br>
(i.e. the cell is lightened). Shortening can be effected by straightening curved arcs, or by relocating a<br>
line's entrance and exit points in a cell so less distance is traversed through the cell.<br>
Conversely, in cells where the error value is negative, the line is too short. By increasing the<br>
line length in such cells, their luminance is decreased (i.e. the cell is darkened). Increasing the line length<br>
through a cell can be accomplished by increasing the curvature of the line in the cell, or by relocating a<br>
line's entrance and exit points along the boundary of the cell, so more distance is traversed through the<br>
cell.<br>
A computer program is desirably employed to effect the foregoing changes in line routing to<br>
achieve the desired darkening or lightening of each cell.<br>
After line positions in the trial calibration block have been tweaked in this fashion, the trial<br>
block is again converted to grey-scale values, and again subtracted from the reference block. Again, an<br>
array of error values is produced. The positions of the lines are then further tweaked in accordance with<br>
the error values.<br>
The foregoing steps of tweaking line routes in accordance with error signals, converting anew<br>
into grey-scale, and computing new error values, is repeated until the luminance of the resulting weave<br>
pattern in the trial block is arbitrarily close to the luminance of the reference block. Four of five<br>
iterations of this procedure commonly suffice to converge on a final calibration block.<br>
(It will be noted that the initial tile pattern created by the designer is done at the tile level - 8 x<br>
8 cells. After the initial trial tile is created, subsequent processing proceeds at the block level (128 x 128<br>
cells). A common result of the iterative design procedure is that the component tiles lose their<br>
uniformity. That is, the pattern of lines in a tile at a corner of the final calibration block will generally be<br>
slightly different than the pattern of lines in a tile near the center of the block.)<br>
After the final calibration block pattern has been established as above, the blocks are tiled<br>
repetitively over some or all of the security document, and can serve either as a background design<br>
element, or as a more apparent element of the design. By printing this weave pattern in an ink color close<br>
to the paper substrate color, the patterning is highly unobtrusive. (If a highly contrasting ink color is used<br>
and if the pattern extends over most or all of the security document, it may be desirable to employ a<br>
brighter luminance paper than otherwise, since the weave pattern effectively darkens the substrate.)<br>
As noted in my application 08/649,419, the Fourier-Mellin transform has the property that the<br>
same output pattern is produced, regardless of rotation or scaling of the input image. The invariant<br>
output pattern is shifted in one dimension proportional to image rotation, and shifted in another<br>
dimension proportional to image scaling. When an image whose F-M transform is known, is thereafter<br>
rotated and/or scaled, the degree of rotation and scaling can be determined by observing the degree of<br>
shift of the transformed F-M pattern in the two dimensions. Once the rotation and scale are known,<br>
reciprocal processing of the image can be performed to restore the image to its original orientation and<br>
scale.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the calibration block pattern has a known F-M transform.<br>
When a security document incorporating such a pattern is scanned (e.g. by a photocopier, a flatbed<br>
scanner, a facsimile machine, etc.), the resulting data can be F-M transformed. The known F-M pattern is<br>
then identified in the transformed data, and its two-dimensional shift indicates the scale and rotation<br>
corruption of the scanned security document data. With these parameters known, misregistration of the<br>
security document - including scale and rotation corruption — can be backed-off, and the security<br>
document data restored to proper alignment and scale. In this re-registered state, the watermark can be<br>
detected. (In alternative embodiments, the original scan data is not processed to remove the<br>
scale/rotation effects. Instead, subsequent processing proceeds with the data in its corrupted state, and<br>
takes into account the specific corruption factor(s) to nonetheless yield accurate decoding, etc.)<br>
The just-described calibration pattern and design procedure, of course, are just exemplary, and<br>
are subject to numerous modifications. The dimensions can be varied at will. It is not essential that the<br>
cell size of the calibration tiles match that of the watermark. Nor do the cells sizes need to be integrally<br>
related to each other. Nor does the calibration pattern need to be implemented as lines; other ink patterns<br>
can alternatively be used to approximate the grey-scale reference pattern<br>
There is no requirement that the lines snake continuously through the tiles. A line can connect<br>
to just a single edge point of a tile, resulting in a line that crosses that tile boundary, but no other. Or a<br>
line can both begin and end in a single tile, and not connect to any other.<br>
While darker lines on a lighter background are illustrated, lighter lines on a darker background<br>
can alternatively be employed.<br>
The iterative design procedure can employ the F-M transform (or other transform). For<br>
example, the trial block pattern can be transformed to the F-M domain, and there compared with the F-M<br>
transform of the reference block. An F-M domain error signal can thus be obtained, and the routing of<br>
the lines can be changed in accordance therewith.<br>
Although the illustrated embodiment tweaked the cell-based grey-scales of the calibration block<br>
by changing line curvature and position, other luminance changing techniques can be employed. For<br>
example, the width of the weave lines can be locally changed, or small ink dots can be introduced into<br>
certain cell areas.<br>
The foregoing (and following) discussions contemplate that the watermark and/or calibration<br>
pattern is printed at the same time as (indeed, sometimes as part of) the line art on the security document.<br>
In many applications it is desirable to provide the calibration pattern on the security document substrate<br>
prior to printing. The markings can be ink applied by the manufacturer, or can be embossings applied,<br>
e.g., by rollers in the paper-making process. (Such textural marking is discussed further below.) Or, the<br>
markings can be applied by the security document printer, as a preliminary printing operation, such as by<br>
offset printing. By using an ink color/density that is already closely matched to the underlying tint of the<br>
paper stock, the manufacturer of the paper can introduce less tinting during its manufacture. Such tinting<br>
will effectively be replaced by the preliminary printing of the watermark/calibration pattern on the blank<br>
paper.<br>
Calibration signals entirely different than those detailed above can also be used. Calibration<br>
signals that are optimized to detect rotation, but not scaling, can be employed when scaling is not a<br>
serious concern. DCT and Fourier transforms provide data that is readily analyzed to determine rotation.<br>
A calibration signal can be tailored to stand out in a typically low-energy portion of the transformed<br>
spectrum (e.g. a series of fine lines at an inclined angle transforms to a usually vacant region in DCT<br>
space), and the scanned image can be transformed to the DCT/Fourier domains to examine any shift in<br>
the calibration signal (e.g. a shift in the spatial frequency representation of the inclined lines).<br>
In some security documents, the just-described calibration weave is printed independently of the<br>
watermark encoding. In other embodiments, the weave serves as the lines whose widths, locations, etc.,<br>
are modulated by tht watermark data, as detailed herein and in application 09/074,034.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, the printing of the security document is achieved by intaglio<br>
printing. Intaglio is a well known printing process employing a metal plate into which the security<br>
document pattern is etched or engraved. Ink is applied to the plate, filling the etched recesses/grooves.<br>
Paper is then pressed into the plate at a very high pressure (e.g. 10 - 20 tons), both raised-inking and<br>
slightly deforming (texturing) the paper.<br>
Although ink is commonly used in the intaglio process, it need not be in certain embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Instead, the paper texturing provided by the intaglio pressing - alone - can suffice<br>
to convey watermark data. (Texturing of a medium to convey watermark information is disclosed in<br>
various of my prior applications, including allowed application 08/438,159.)<br>
To illustrate, an intaglio plate was engraved (using a numerically controlled engraving<br>
apparatus), to a depth of slightly less than 1 mm, in accordance with a 3.2 x 3.2 cm. noise-like block of<br>
watermark data. The watermark data was generated as described above (e.g. 128 bits of data, randomly<br>
distributed in a 128 x 128 cell array), and summed with a correspondingly-sized block of calibration data<br>
(implemented as discrete grey-scaled cells, rather than the line/weave pattern detailed above). In this<br>
embodiment, the data was not kept within a small range of digital numbers, but instead was railed to a<br>
full 8-bit dynamic range.) Banknote paper was intaglio-pressed into this plate — without ink — yielding a<br>
generally flat substrate with a 3.2 x 3.2 cm textured region therein. Only on fairly close inspection was<br>
the texturing visible; on casual inspection the paper surface appeared uniform.<br>
This textured paper was placed - textured exfrema down - on the platen of an conventional<br>
flatbed scanner (of the sort commonly sold as an accessory for personal computers), and scanned. The<br>
resulting image data was input to Adobe's Photoshop image processing software, version 4.0, which<br>
includes Digimarc watermark reader software. The software readily detected the watermark from the<br>
textured paper, even when the paper was skewed on the scanner platen.<br>
The optical detection process by which a seemingly blank piece of paper can reliably convey<br>
128 bits of data through an inexpensive scanner has not been analyzed in detail; the degree of localized<br>
reflection from the paper may be a function of whether the illuminated region is concave or convex in<br>
shape. Regardless of the explanation, it is a remarkable phenomenon to witness.<br>
A second experiment was conducted with the same engraved plate, this time using transparent<br>
ink. The results were similar, although detection of the watermark data was not always as reliable as in<br>
the inkless case. The raised transparent ink may serve as light conduit, dispersing the incident<br>
illumination in unpredictable ways as contrasted with simple reflection off un-inked paper.<br>
Experiments have also been conducted using traditional opaque inks. Again, the watermark car<br>
reliably be read.<br>
In addition to the just-described technique for "reading" intaglio markings by a conventional<br>
scanner, a variant technique is disclosed in Van Renesse, Optical Inspection Techniques for Security<br>
Instrumentation, SPIE Proc. Vol. 2659, pp. 159-167 (1996), and can alternatively be used in<br>
embodiments according to the present invention.<br>
Although intaglio is a preferred technique for printing security documents, it is not the only sucl<br>
technique. Other familiar techniques by which watermarks and calibration patterns can be printed<br>
include offset litho and letterpress, as well as inkjet printing, xerographic printing, etc. And, as noted,<br>
textured watermarking can be effected as part of the paper-making process, e.g. by high pressure texture
rollers.<br>
In still other embodiments, the watermark and/or calibration ("information") patterns are not<br>
printed on the security document substrate, but rather are formed on or in an auxiliary layer that is<br>
laminated with a base substrate. If a generally clear laminate is used, the information patterns can be<br>
realized with opaque inks, supplementing the design on the underlying substrate. Or the added<br>
information can be encoded in textural form. Combinations of the foregoing can similarly be used.<br>
To retrofit existing security document designs with information patterns, the existing artwork<br>
must be modified to effect the necessary additions and/or tweaks to localized security document<br>
luminance and/or texture.<br>
When designing new security documents, it would be advantageous to facilitate integration of<br>
information patterns into the basic design. One such arrangement is detailed in the following discussion.<br>
Many security documents are still designed largely by hand. A designer works at a drafting<br>
table or computer workstation, and spends many hours laying-out minute (e.g. 5 mm x 5 mm) excerpts of<br>
the design. To aid integration of watermark and/or calibration pattern data in this process, an accessory<br>
layout grid can be provided, identifying the watermark "bias" (e.g. -3 to +3) that is to be included in each<br>
250 micron cell of the security document. If the accessory grid indicates that the luminance should be<br>
slightly increased in a cell (e.g. 1%), the designer can take this bias in mind when defining the<br>
composition of the cell and include a touch less ink than might otherwise be included. Similarly, if the<br>
accessory grid indicates that the luminance should be somewhat strongly increased in a cell (e.g. 5%), the<br>
designer can again bear this in mind and try to include more ink than might otherwise be included. Due<br>
to the substantial redundancy of most watermark encoding techniques, strict compliance by the designer<br>
to these guidelines is not required. Even loose compliance can result in artwork that requires little, if any,<br>
further modification to reliably convey watermark and/or calibration information.<br>
Such "designing-in" of embedded information in security documents is facilitated by the number<br>
of arbitrary design choices made by security document designers. A few examples from U.S. banknotes<br>
include the curls in the presidents' hair, the drape of clothing, the clouds in the skies, the shrubbery in the<br>
landscaping, the bricks in the pyramid, the fill patterns in the lettering, and the great number of arbitrary<br>
guilloche patterns and other fanciful designs, etc. All include curves, folds, wrinkles, shadow effects,<br>
etc., about which the designer has wide discretion in selecting local luminance, etc. Instead of making<br>
such choices arbitrarily, the designer can make these choices deliberately so as to serve an informational -<br>
- as well as an aesthetic ~ function.<br>
To further aid the security document designer, data defining several different information-<br>
carrying patterns (both watermark and/or calibration pattern) can be stored on mass storage of a computer<br>
a workstation and serve as a library of design elements for future designs. The same user-interface<br>
techniques that are employed to pick colors in image-editing software (e.g. Adobe Photoshop) and fill<br>
textures in presentation programs (e.g. Microsoft PowerPoint) can similarly be used to present a palette<br>
of information patterns to a security document designer. Clicking on a visual representation of the<br>
desired pattern makes the pattern available for inclusion in a security document being designed (e.g.<br>
filling a desired area).<br>
In the embodiment earlier-described, the calibration pattern is printed as a visible artistic<br>
element of the security document. However, the same calibration effect can be provided subliminally if<br>
desired. That is, instead of generating artwork mimicking the grey-scale pattern of the reference<br>
calibration block, the reference calibration block can itself be encoded into the security document as<br>
small changes in local luminance. In many such embodiments, the bias to localized document luminance<br>
due to the calibration pattern is simply added to the bias due to the watermark data, and encoded like the<br>
watermark data (e.g. as localized changes to the width or position of component line-art lines, as inserted<br>
ink droplets, etc.).<br>
The uses to which the 128 bits of watermark data can be put in security documents are myriad.<br>
Many are detailed in the materials cited above. Examples include postal stamps encoded with their value,<br>
or with the zip code of the destination to which they are addressed (or from which they were sent);<br>
banknotes encoded with their denomination, and their date and place of issuance; identification<br>
documents encoded with authentication information by which a person's identify can be verified; etc.,<br>
etc.<br>
The encoded data can be in a raw form - available to any reader having the requisite key data (in<br>
watermarking techniques where a key data is used), or can be encrypted, such as with public key<br>
encryption techniques, etc. The encoded data can embody information directly, or can be a pointer or an<br>
index to a further collection of data in which the ultimate information desired is stored.<br>
For example, watermark data in a passport need not encode a complete dossier of information<br>
on the passport owner. Instead, the encoded data can include key data (e.g. a social security number)<br>
identifying a particular record in a remote database in which biographical data pertaining to the passport<br>
owner is stored. A passport processing station employing such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 11.<br>
To decode watermark data, the security document must be converted into electronic image data<br>
for analysis. This conversion is typically performed by a scanner.<br>
Scanners are well known, so a detailed description is not provided here. Suffice it to say that<br>
scanners conventionally employ a line of closely spaced photodetector cells that produce signals related<br>
to the amount of the light reflected from successive swaths of the document. Most inexpensive consumer<br>
scanners have a resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi), or a center to center spacing of component<br>
photodetectors of about 84 microns. Higher quality scanners of the sort found in most professional<br>
imaging equipment and photocopiers have resolutions of 600 dpi (42 microns), 1200 dpi (21 microns), or<br>
better.<br>
Taking the example of a 300 dpi scanner (84 micron photodetector spacing), each 250 micron<br>
region 12 on the security document will correspond to about a 3 x 3 array of photodetector samples.<br>
Naturally, only in rare instances will a given region be physically registered with the scanner so that nine<br>
photodetector samples capture the luminance in that region, and nothing else. More commonly, the<br>
image is rotated with respect to the scanner photodetectors, or is longitudinally misaligned (i.e. some<br>
photodetectors image sub-parts of two adjoining regions). However, since the scanner oversamples the<br>
regions, the luminance of each region can unambiguously be determined.<br>
In one embodiment, the scanned data from the document is collected in a two dimensional array<br>
of data and processed to detect the embedded calibration information. The scanner data is then processed<br>
to effect a virtual re-registration of the document image. A software program next analyzes the statistics<br>
of the re-registered data (using the techniques disclosed in my prior writings) to extract the bits of the<br>
embedded data.<br>
(Again, the reference to my earlier watermark decoding techniques is exemplary only. Once<br>
scanning begins and the data is available in sampled form, it is straightforward to apply any other<br>
watermark decoding technique to extract a correspondingly-encoded watermark. Some of these other<br>
techniques employ domain transformations (e.g. to wavelet, DCT, or Fourier domains, as part of the<br>
decoding process).)<br>
In a variant embodiment, the scanned data is not assembled in a complete array prior to<br>
processing. Instead, it is processed in real-time, as it is generated, in order to detect embedded watermark<br>
data without delay. (Depending on the parameters of the scanner, it may be necessary to scan a half-inch<br>
or so of the document before the statistics of the resulting data unambiguously indicate the presence of a<br>
watermark.)<br>
In other embodiments, hardware devices are provided with the capability to recognize embeddec<br>
watermark data in any document images they process, and to respond accordingly.<br>
One example is a color photocopier. Such devices employ a color scanner to generate sampled<br>
(pixel) data corresponding to an input media (e.g. a dollar bill). If watermark data associated with a<br>
security document is detected, the photocopier can take one or more steps.<br>
One option is simply to interrupt copying, and display a message reminding the operator that it<br>
is illegal to reproduce currency.<br>
Another option is to dial a remote service and report the attempted banknote reproduction.<br>
Photocopiers with dial-out capabilities are known in the art (e.g. patent 5,305,199) and are readily<br>
adapted to this purpose. The remote service can be an independent service, or can be a government<br>
agency.<br>
Yet another option is to permit the copying, but to insert forensic tracer data in the resultant<br>
copy. This tracer data can take various forms. Steganographically encoded binary data is one example.<br>
An example is shown in patent 5,568,268. The tracer data can memorialize the serial number of the<br>
machine that made the copy and/or the date and time the copy was made. To address privacy concerns,<br>
such tracer data is not normally inserted in all photocopied output, but is inserted only when the subject<br>
being photocopied is detected as being a security document. (An example of such an arrangement is<br>
shown in Fig. 12.)<br>
Desirably, the scan data is analyzed on a line-by-line basis in order to identify illicit<br>
photocopying with a minimum of delay. If a security document is scanned, one or more lines of scanner<br>
output data may be provided to the photocopier's reprographic unit before the recognition decision has<br>
been made. In this case the photocopy will have two regions: a first region that is not tracer-marked, and<br>
a second, subsequent region in which the tracer data has been inserted.<br>
Photocopiers with other means to detect not-to-be-copied documents are known in the art, and<br>
employ various response strategies. Examples are detailed in U.S. Patents 5,583,614,4,723,149,<br>
5,633,952, 5,640,467, and 5,424,807.<br>
Another hardware device that can employ the foregoing principles is a standalone scanner. A<br>
programmed processor (or dedicated hardware) inside the scanner analyzes the data being generated by<br>
the device, and responds accordingly.<br>
Yet another hardware device that can employ the foregoing principles is a printer. A processor<br>
inside the device analyzes graphical image data to be printed, looking for watermarks associated with<br>
security documents.<br>
For both the scanner and printer devices, response strategies can include disabling operation, or<br>
inserting tracer information. (Such devices typically do not have dial-out capabilities.)<br>
Again, it is desirable to process the scanner or printer data as it becomes available, so as to<br>
detect any security document processing with a minimum of delay. Again, there will be some lag time<br>
before a detection decision is made. Accordingly, the scanner or printer output will be comprised of two<br>
parts, one without the tracer data, and another with the tracer data.<br>
Many security documents already include visible structures that can be used as aids in banknote<br>
detection (e.g. the seal of the issuer and various geometrical markings). In accordance with a further<br>
aspect of the present invention, a security document is analyzed by an integrated system that considers<br>
both the visible structures and watermark-embedded data.<br>
Visible security document structures can be sensed using known pattern recognition techniques.<br>
Examples of such techniques are disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,321,773, 5,390,259, 5,533,144, 5,539,841,<br>
5,583,614, 5,633,952, 4,723,149, 5,692,073, and 5,424,807 and laid-open foreign applications EP<br>
649,114 and EP 766,449.<br>
In photocopiers (and the like) equipped to detect both visible structures and watermarks from<br>
security documents, the detection of either can cause one or more of the above-noted responses to be<br>
initiated (Fig. 12).<br>
Again, scanners and printers can be equipped with a similar capability - analyzing the data for<br>
either of these security document hallmarks. If either is detected, the software (or hardware) responds<br>
accordingly.<br>
Identification of security documents by watermark data provides an important advantage over<br>
recognition by visible structures - it cannot so easily be defeated. A security document can be doctored<br>
(e.g. by white-out, scissors, or less crude techniques) to remove/obliterate the visible structures. Such a<br>
document can then be freely copied on either a visible structure-sensing photocopier or scanner/printer<br>
installation. The removed visible structure can then be added back in via a second printing/photocopying<br>
operation. If the printer is not equipped with security document-disabling capabilities, image-editing<br>
tools can be used to insert visible structures back into image data sets scanned from such doctored<br>
documents, and the complete document can then be freely printed. By additionally including embedded<br>
watermark data in the security document, and sensing same, such ruses will not succeed.<br>
(A similar ruse is to scan a security document image on a non-security document-sensing<br>
scanner. The resulting image set can then be edited by conventional image editing tools to<br>
remove/obliterate the visible structures. Such a data set can then be printed - even on a<br>
printer/photocopier that examines such data for the presence of visible structures. Again, the missing<br>
visible structures can be inserted by a subsequent printing/photocopying operation.)<br>
Desirably, the visible structure detector and the watermark detector are integrated together as a<br>
single hardware and/or software tool. This arrangement provides various economies, e.g., in interfacing<br>
with the scanner, manipulating pixel data sets for pattern recognition and watermark extraction,<br>
electronically re-registering the image to facilitate pattern recognition/watermark extraction, issuing<br>
control signals (e.g. disabling) signals to the photocopier/scanner, etc.<br>
While the foregoing apparatuses are particularly concerned with counterfeit deterrence, the<br>
embedded markings can also serve other functions. Examples include banknote processing machines that<br>
perform denomination sorting, counterfeit detection, and circulation analysis functions. (I.e., banknotes<br>
with certain markings may be distributed through known sources, and their circulation/distribution can<br>
subsequently be monitored to assist in macro-economic analyses.)<br>
From the foregoing, it will be recognized that various embodiments according to the present<br>
invention provide techniques for embedding multi-bit binary data in security documents, and provide for<br>
the reliable extraction of such data even in the presence of various forms of corruption (e.g. scale and<br>
rotation).<br>
Having described and illustrated the principles of my invention with reference to several<br>
illustrative embodiments, it will be recognized that these embodiments are exemplary only and should<br>
not be taken as limiting the scope of my invention. Guideu Dy the foregoing teachings, it should be<br>
apparent that other watermarking, decoding, and anti-counterfeiting technologies can be substituted for,<br>
and/or combined with, the elements detailed above to yield advantageous effects. Other features<br>
disclosed in my earlier applications can similarly be employed in embodiments of the technology detailed<br>
herein. (Thus, I have not here belabored application of each of the techniques disclosed in my earlier<br>
applications ~ e.g. use of neural networks for watermark detectors — to the present subject matter since<br>
same is fairly taught by reading the present disclosure in the context of my earlier work.)<br>
While the technology has been described with reference to embodiments employing regular<br>
rectangular arrays of cells, those skilled in the art will recognize that other arrays — neither rectangular<br>
nor regular ~ can alternatively be used.<br>
While the embodiments have described the calibration patterns as adjuncts to digital watermarks<br>
- facilitating their detection, such patterns have utility apart from digital watermarks. One example is in<br>
re-registering scanned security document image data to facilitate detection of visible structures (e.g.<br>
detection of the printed seal of the issuer, using known pattern recognition techniques). Indeed, the use<br>
of such calibration patterns to register both watermark and visible structure image data for recognition is<br>
an important economy that can be gained by integration a visible structure detector and a watermark<br>
detector into a single system.<br>
Although security documents have most commonly been printed (e.g. cotton/linen), other<br>
substrates are gaining in popularity (e.g. synthetics, such as polymers) and are well (or better) suited for<br>
use with the above-described techniques.<br>
The embodiments detailed above can be implemented in dedicated hardware (e.g. ASICs),<br>
programmable hardware, and/or software.<br>
Several patents and patent publications were noted above. The artisan is presumed to be<br>
familiar with the technologies described therein, and to be capable of integrating same with the elements<br>
particularly detailed in this disclosure. To the extent possible, the disclosures of those documents is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the above-described<br>
technology may be put, it should be recognized that the detailed embodiments are illustrative only and<br>
should not be taken as limiting the scope of my invention. Rather, I claim as my invention all such<br>
embodiments as may come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A substrate having a background pattern formed over at least a portion<br>
thereof, characterized in that the pattern has a substantially uniform appearance<br>
to casual human inspection, but has localized luminance changes that represent<br>
machine readable multibit binary information, when subject to computer analysis,<br>
said pattern also representing a calibration signal.<br>
2. A banknote formed on the substrate as claimed in claim 1.<br>
3. The banknote as claimed in claim 2, wherein said N - bit data represents<br>
the banknote's denomination.<br>
4. The banknote as claimed in claim 2, wherein said N - bit data represents<br>
location information.<br>
5. The banknote as claimed in claim 2, wherein said N - bit data represents<br>
date information.<br>
6. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pattern is formed by ink.<br>
7. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pattern is formed by<br>
texture.<br>
8. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pattern comprises plural<br>
cells, each representing all N - bits.<br>
9. The substrate as claimed in claim 8, wherein each cell comprises a<br>
rectangular array of plural regions.<br>
10. The substrate as claimed in claim 9, wherein each region is associated<br>
with one of said bits.<br>
11. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
pattern comprises a steganographic calibration pattern,<br>
permitting the orientation of said substrate to be<br>
determined by said computer analysis.<br>
12. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
pattern comprises plural inter-woven lines.<br>
13. The substrate as claimed in claim 12, wherein the<br>
lines have widths of between 30 and 100 microns.<br>
14. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
pattern is designed to produce a particular pattern in a<br>
transform domain.<br>
15. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
pattern gives the substrate a colored tint.<br>
16. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
pattern is formed by intaglio printing.<br>
17. The substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
pattern is formed on a layer that is laminated to said<br>
substrate.<br>
18. A. passport page formed on the substrate as claimed<br>
in claim 1.<br>
19. A check formed on the substrate as claimed in claim<br>
1.<br>
20. An identification document formed on the substrate<br>
as claimed in claim 1.<br>
Security documents (e.g. passports, currency, event tickets, and the like) are encoded to<br>
convey machine-readable multi-bit binary information (e.g., a digital watermark), usually<br>
in a manner not alerting human viewers that such information is present. The documents<br>
can be provided with overt or subliminal calibration patterns. When a document<br>
incorporating such a pattern is scanned (e.g. by a photocopier), the pattern facilitates<br>
detection of the encoded information notwithstanding possible scaling or rotation of the<br>
scan data. The calibration pattern can serve as a carrier for the watermark information, or<br>
the watermark can be encoded independently. In one embodiment, the watermark and the<br>
calibration pattern are formed on the document by an intaglio process, with or without<br>
ink. A photocopier responsive to such markings can take predetermined action if<br>
reproduction of a security document is attempted. A passport processing station<br>
responsive to such markings can use the decoded binary data to access a database having<br>
information concerning the passport holder. Some such apparatuses detect both the<br>
watermark data and the presence of a visible structure characteristic of a security<br>
document (e.g., a printed seal of the document's issuer).</td>
