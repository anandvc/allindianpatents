				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of copper and nickel powder from copper bleed stream.<br>
The invention particularly relates to selectively producing copper and nickel powder by reducing copper level equal to nickel, separating mixed copper and nickel solution followed by hydrogen reduction of its mixed sulphate solution.<br>
Copper bleed stream is produced in the processing of sea nodules by roast-ammonia leach - solvent extraction - electrowinning route, for controlling metallic impurities in the copper electrolysis. This solution consists of 16-20 g/L Ni and 35-45 g/L Cu besides 150-200 g/L H2SO4 and some other impurities which needs to be processed to recover valuable metals viz. nickel and copper. Producing nickel and copper powder from this solution will thus be the high value products which have specific demands and can be used in powder metallurgical (P/M) applications to make important components. Copper and nickel powders can also be prepared from the copper bleed stream of copper smelters. Besides, acidic and ammoniacal leach liquors of several lean grade and complex ores containing copper and nickel can be suitably processed to produce high value products.<br>
As such no attempt appears to be made to process copper bleed stream produced in the processing of sea nodules. The known literature on the processing of sea nodules often shows the separation and recovery of copper, nickel and cobalt from the ammoniacal / sulphate / chloride leach solutions without mentioning the metal recovery (Cu and Ni) from the bleed solutions (Han, KN, Trans. HM, 51(1), 1998, p.55-67).<br>
There are however, a number of literature reports on the processing of copper bleed streams of copper smelters. Reference may be made to Havlik et al (Havlik, T, Skrobian, M, Kammel, R, Curilla J and Cmorejova, D, Hydrometallurgy, 41, 1996, p.79-88) and Nagai et al (Nagai, T, Zaki, NY and Kobayashi, MMIJ, L-l, 1976, p. 1-4) wherein the copper bleed stream of copper smelter is subjected to a number of cumbersome steps such as (i) decopperisation to remove copper as poor quality nodular sheet (99.6% purity) for recharging to the smelter, (ii) evaporation / crystallisation of decopperised nickel sulphate solution to produce impure nickel sulphate and recycling the mother liquor to electrolysis section for acid make-up, (iii) purification of nickel sulphate by hydrometallurgical process, and (iv) crystallisation of nickel sulphate. The drawbacks are production of poor quality copper, recycling back of this copper to smelter thereby reducing the productivity, high-energy requirement, production of off-grade nickel sulphate crystal, environmental problems due to evolution of abnoxious arsine gasduring decopperisation etc. Reference may be made to Toyabe, K, Segawa, C and Sato H (In Proc. Electrorefining and winning of copper, 116 th Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 1987, AIME Perm., p.99-116) and Shibata, T, Hashivchi, M and Kato, T, (116 th Annual Meeting, Dever, Colorado, 1987, AIME Perm., p.l 17-128) wherein the process is based on selective removal of Sb and Bi from electrolyte by adsorption on carbon or chelating resin and producing nickel sulphate crystals after removal of arsenic in deccopperisation step. In yet another process developed by Shibayama, R and Nagai, T (ISEC 1990, p. 1193-1198), chelating ion-exchange resin in combination with conventional process is used to recover copper and nickel cathodes/ sulphates. A process described by Abhishev, DN and Stryapkov, AV (ISEC'88, 1988, p.305-307) uses an alcohol for acid extraction and naphthenic acid to separate nickel and copper producing their sulphates. The drawbacks of the above processes are the involvement of very large number of processing steps and separation of individual components such as sulphuric acid, copper and nickel, besides producing metal salts or cathodes of lower return and payback. Reference may be made to Togashi, R and Nagai, T (Hydrometallurgy, 11, 1983, p. 149-163) wherein production of copper powder by hydrogen reduction from copper bleed stream with above 100 g/L sulphuric acid resulted in poor quality powder at higher depletion level. The drawbacks are removal of arsenic from the bleed stream, presence of bismuth ions for effective reduction of copper and need to purify electrolyte by solvent extraction.<br>
There are known processes to produce copper and nickel powder by hydrogen reduction from the leach liquors of their respective ores. Reference may be made to US Patent 2,7976,342 (1957) wherein copper precipitation is followed with modification for other metals as well. Reference may be made to US Patent 332, 679 (1973) wherein attempts had been made to the continuous preparation of metal powders by hydrogen reduction from the leach solutions of metals from their ores. The main requirements of producing metal powders are purity of individual metal sulphates, metal ion concentration, specific pH (ammoniacal solution), seeding and additives, thus restricting their applicability in complex situations as encountered in the processing of bleed stream. Moreover, because of the drawbacks such as the purification steps by precipitation, solvent extraction and ion exchange, separation of metals from a solution with multimetals, and incomplete recovery in hydrogen reduction, the existing processes are not recommended for the processing of copper bleed stream.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to prepare copper and nickel powders from the copper bleed stream, a waste by product generated in the processing of polymetallic sea nodules which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
In the process of present invention, the copper bleed stream obtained from the electrowinning circuit of sea nodules treatment partially decopperised to equalise the level of copper and nickel and then evaporated to crystallisation of mixed sulphates of copper and nickel. From the mixed solution containing copper and nickel sulphates, iron is removed by precipitation. This solution is then processed for the metal powder preparation in autoclave by reducing with hydrogen gas. The preparation of copper powder is selectively carried out followed by subsequent nickel recovery as powder. The copper and nickel powders possess desired purity for Powder Metallurgical application.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of copper and nickel powder from  copper bleed stream which comprises: (i)       partially decopperising the sulphate phase said copper bleed stream containing<br>
polymetallic sulphate phase   by   electrolysis to reduce   copper level equal to<br>
nickel at a current density of 150 to 300A/m2, (ii)      separating the mixed copper and nickel sulphate phases from rest of the solution<br>
obtained in step (i) by known methods to obtain crystallise mixed sulphates of<br>
copper and nickel phases, (iii)     leaching the  said mixed copper and nickel  sulphate phases in aqueous media<br>
followed by dilute sulphuric acid at a temperature of 30-100°C for a period of 1<br>
to 8 hrs, (iv)     reducing the resultant solution obtained in step (iii) by hydrogen gas to produce<br>
copper powder,<br>
(v)      purifying the copper depleted solution obtained from step (iv), (vi)     reducing the said purified copper depleted solution by hydrogen gas at a pressure<br>
range of 20-70 Kg/cm2to produce nickel powder at a temperature of 140- 250 ° C<br>
for 15-120 minutes with stirring rate varying from 20 to 80 stroke/min, (vii)    washing   and   drying  the   said   copper   powder   for  powder   metallurgical<br>
