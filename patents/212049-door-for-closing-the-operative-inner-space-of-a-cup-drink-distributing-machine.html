DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention refers to a door for closing the operative inner space of a cup drink distributing machine.<br>
US 5090589 discloses a vending machine for beverage containers comprising a frame having front side and rear faces; a bowed sign panel substantially covering the front face and extending outwardly therefrom, said sign panel being fabricated from transparent materials with translucent display fields thereon; illumination means are disposed behind the bowed sign panel for backlighting the same. The curved or bowed shape of the sign panel is such that the overall appearance and configuration of the vending machine, viewed from the front face thereof suggests the appearance of a can of beverage of the primary product.<br>
US 4886325 discloses an in-door mounted shadow-box type display assembly for use in can vending machines. The assembly comprises a unitary frame adapted to be mounted within the interior of the vending machine's front door behind a transparent area of the door's front panel. Plural display openings or sockets are provided in a planar display associated with the frame for receiving hill size cans in upright display position. Translucent light shields border the mounting frame to extend forwardly of the display cans to hide the door's interior from view while serving to transmit artificial light for illuminating the display articles.<br>
Known automatic cup drink distributing machines have a door suitable for closing the machine operative inner space containing devices for dosing and dispensing liquids and powders necessary to prepare drinks. This door is located in the front side of the distributing machine and its depth accommodates means necessary for loading the cups and driving the same to a dispensing space.<br>
Moreover, the above mentioned automatic distributing machines are provided with means for illuminating their front surface. In this way the lighting means enables both the distributing machine to be easily located, particularly when the same is positioned in a scarcely lit room and the customers to easily select the kind of drink chosen and read the machine operations instruction on the front surface.<br>
2<br><br>
of the machine.<br>
The above mentioned distributors are required to accommodate the lighting means, e.g. a fluorescent light, 5 in their interior in order to avoid the distributing machine from having projecting parts and to prevent the customers from accidentally contacting the light.<br>
In order to meet said requirement, the available automatic 10 distributing machines require an outer backdoor hinged to the door that really closes the machine operative space. The outer backdoor is made of substantially light-transparent plastics. A closed spaced containing the machine lighting means is defined by the backdoor and the 15  door outer front surface.<br>
The necessary patterns or notices of the automatic distributing machine are printed or applied as transfers on the outer backdoor and back-lighted by the lighting means.<br>
20<br>
It would be helpful to point out that the distributing machines having the backdoor hinged to the door for closing the operative space, while preventing incidental liquid spatters from reach the electrical parts of the lighting<br>
25  means,  result in an undesirable high increase of the<br>
3<br><br>
manufacturing cost of the distributing machines and in a more complex structure of the sa-tie.<br>
The problem at the basis of the present invention consists 5 of devising a door for a drink distributing machine which shows structural and functional features which meet said requirement, while avoiding the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Further features and advantages of the door of the drink 10<br>
distributing machine according to the present invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment given by way of an illustrative and non limiting example with reference to the attached figures, wherein:<br>
-	fig. 1 is an exploded prospective, view of a cup<br>
drink distributing machine comprising a door according to<br>
the present invention,<br>
20<br>
-	fig. 2 is a schematic prospective exploded view of<br>
the door of the drink distributing machine of fig. 1, 25<br>
4<br><br>
-	fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a detail of the<br>
door of fig. 2,<br>
-	fig. 4 is a prospective cross-sectional schematic<br>
exploded view of another embodiment of the door of the<br>
5  drink distributing machine of fig. 1,<br>
-	fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of a detail of the<br>
door of fig. 4,<br>
-	fig. 6 is a schematic prospective exploded view of<br>
another form of the embodiment of the door of the drink<br>
10  distributing machine of fig. 1,<br>
-	fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a detail of the<br>
door of fig. 6.<br>
Referring to the figures, reference number 1 generally 15  shows a machine for distributing cup drinks comprising a door 2 according to the invention.<br>
The distributing machine 1 comprises a frontally open supporting boxed structure. 3 that defines an operative 20 inner space suitable for receiving containers, dosing devices, and dispensers of liquids and powders required for preparing drinks.<br>
The door 2  is  made  of plastic material,  preferably 25  polycarbonate, and   is hinged tc the boxed structure 3 of<br>
5<br><br>
the distributing machine 1 in order to close its front opening. The opening of door 2 allows to get into the distributing machine operative space to carry out routine liquids and powders supplying and servicing operations. 5<br>
In this example, door 2 is a shell having a concave back part facing the distributing machine operative space and an outwardly facing opposed front part.<br>
10 Means for loading and stacking cups to be filled with dispensed drinks and means for handling (e.g. cup pushing means) and driving cups to a dispensing space are connected to door 2. Said means will be neither described nor shown in the following because they are conventional,<br>
15<br>
Said cup loading, stacking, handling and driving means are<br>
received into the door depth, more particularly into its<br>
back concave part. For this purpose, door 2 is provided<br>
with a holding and support shell 4 suitable for holding and<br>
20  supporting said means.<br>
The . shell 4 is made of light-transparent plastics, e.g. methacrylate or transparent ABS  and it  is removably connected by fixing screws 12 to door 2. 25<br>
6<br><br>
The door front wall has in its bottom part a recess defining an outwardly open dispensing space 6, ' from which can be withdrawn a cup containing the dispensed drink. For this purpose door 2 is provided with an opening 7 through 5 which cups are individually supplied to the dispensing space 6.<br>
Moreover, lighting means, such as a fluorescent lamp 8, are associated to the  door 2 for backlighting at least a 10  substantially light-transparent portion 5 of the door 2.<br>
*<br>
Conveniently, the fluorescent lamp 8 is supported inside the holding and supporting shell 4. However, the shell is internally provided with a partition 9 to protect the lamp<br>
15 ' 8 and its electrical connections from liquid spatters coming from the machine operative space. Said partition 9 divides the shell 4 in a front portion 10, for receiving the lighting means 8, and in a back portion for receiving said cup loading/ stacking, handling and driving means- The<br>
20 front portion of the shell 4 faces said door light-transparent portion 5, while the shell back portion 4 faces the distributing machine operative space.<br>
Referring particularly to the preferred embodiment shown in 25  figures 2 and 3, said door substantially light-transparent<br>
7<br><br>
portion 5 is provided with an opening defined by a perimetric edge 14, while the shell front portion 4 is formed by a wall 13 made cf a substantially light-transparent material and it is suitable for being inserted 5 in said opening of the door 2. Therefore, a closed space is defined by said light-transparent wall 13 and partition 9 in said front portion of the shell in which the lamp 8 is safely and protectively received.<br>
10  Preferably, the front portion cf the shell 4 is shaped to<br>
closely fit into the opening of the door 2 defined by the<br>
perimetric edge 14, in a way that the front wall 13 of the<br>
shell 4 is flush, preferably pertaining to the same plane,<br>
with the outer front surface of coor 2.<br>
15<br>
Preferably, the front portion of the shell 4 forms a shoulder 15 on which the door perimetric edge 14 abuts to restrict the maximum insertion of the shell front portion in the opening of the door2.<br>
20<br>
The lighting means, such as the lamp 8, are associated to the partition 9,<br>
In the example, the partition 9 has a window 16 closed -by a 25  closing plate 18 removably fixed to the partition 9, The<br>
8<br><br>
lighting means 8 are fixed tc zhe   closing plate 18. The size of the window 16 formed in the partition 9 is chosen in order to allow the lighting means 8 to be inserted trough the window. 5<br>
Preferably, the closing plate 18 is arranged to abut the side of the partition 9 faced the back part of the door 2.<br>
Partition 9 is removably connected to the shell 4 and it is 10  made of an aluminum alloy. Alternatively, the partition 9 can be made of appropriate material, for example bakelite or plastic material.<br>
Referring particularly to figures 4 and 5, reference number 15 102 generally shows a different embodiment of a door for a cup drink distributing machine according to the present invention. The elements of the door 102 which are structurally and functionally identical to the elements of door 2 have the same reference numbers and they will not 20  further described.<br>
The door 102 distinguishes from the above described door 2<br>
in that said at least a substantially light-transparent<br>
portion of the door 102 is formed by a wall 105 made of<br>
25  transparent plastics, such as r.ethacrylate or transparent<br>
g<br><br>
ABS, on which the front transparent wall 13 of the shell 4 abuts as shown in fig. 5. Preferably, the front transparent wall 13 of the shell 4 has a shape complementary to the door wall 105 in order to adhere to it across its surface. 5<br>
Referring particularly to figures 6 and 7, reference-number 202 generally shows a different embodiment of a door for a cup drink distributing machine according to the present invention. The elements of the door 202 which are 10 structurally and functionally identical to the elements of door 2 have the same reference numbers and they will not further described.<br>
The door 202 distinguishes from the above described door 2 15 in that said at least "a substantially light-transparent portion of the door 202 is formed by a wall 205 made of transparent plastics, such as nethacrylate or transparent ABS. Moreover, the front wall of the shell 4 is open and defined by a frontal perimetric edge 206 abutting the 20 transparent wall 205 of the door 202 as shown in fig. 7. The lighting means 8 are also safely and protectively received in a closed space defined between the transparent wall 205 of the door 202 and the partition 9.<br>
25  Referring to door 202, the partition can be integral with<br>
10<br><br>
the holding and support shell.<br>
How it can be appreciated from above, the door of the drink distributing machine according to the invention meets the 5 above mentioned requirement while overcoming ' the disadvantages mentioned in the introductory part of the present specification.<br>
Actually, the lighting means received into the door 10 according to the invention are accommodated in a closed space safely protected from spatters coming from the machine operative space and from users, without the presence of an outer backdoor.<br>
15 Another advantage of the door of the drink distributing machine according to the present invention is its structural simplicity that reduces its manufacturing cost. It can be helpful to point out that the replacement of the lighting means is a fast and simple operation because it is<br>
20 sufficient to open the door and remove the closing plate supporting the lighting means.<br>
Obviously, several changes and modifications can be made to<br>
the distributing machine door according to the above<br>
25  described invention by a person skilled in the art, in<br>
