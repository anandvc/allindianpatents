				<td>The present invention relates to a method for providing refrigeration to a cryogenic vessel and cryogenic vessel system.<br>
This invention relates generally to the containment of cryogenic fluids such as for storage or other purposes.<br>
Background Art<br>
The storage or other containment of a cryogenic fluid involves the use of insulated vessels to reduce as much as possible the loss of some of the cryogenic fluid due to heat leak into the vessel.  However, even with the use of the best insulation systems available, a significant portion of the contained cryogen will vaporize due to the heat leak, resulting in a pressure increase within the container to the point at which the vapor is vented to the atmosphere through safety valves.  This loss of cryogenic fluid imposes a significant economic burden, especially for higher cost cryogenic fluids such as helium and neon which are used for such applications as superconductivity.<br>
Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide a system for storing or otherwise containing a cryogenic fluid which can reduce or eliminate losses due to heat leak into the fluid.<br>

Brief Description Of The Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional representation of one preferred embodiment of the cryogenic vessel system of this invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-sectional representation of another preferred embodiment of the cryogenic vessel system of this invention wherein a heat pipe is employed.<br>
Figure 3 is a cross-sectional representation of another preferred embodiment of the cryogenic vessel system of this invention wherein refrigeration is provided directly to the insulation within the vessel interior. Detailed Description<br>
The invention relates to vessels for containing cryogenic fluids such as stationary storage tanks, mobile tankage, dewars and the like.  Among the cryogenic fluids which can be effectively contained<br>
with the use of this invention one can name hydrogen, helium, neon, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and mixtures such as air and natural gas.<br>
The invention will be discussed in greater detail with reference to the Drawings.  Referring now to Figure 1, cryogenic vessel 20 has an outer shell 1, which defines a vessel interior 2.  The vessel interior 2 contains insulation 21 which, in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 1, is a layer of insulation abutting the inner surface of vessel shell 1.  Vessel interior 2 also contains a quantity of cryogenic liquid 3. Absent the pulse tube refrigeration provision of this invention, ambient heat leak into the vessel through the insulation will cause some of the cryogenic liquid to vaporize and ultimately some of the vaporized cryogenic fluid will be vented through safety valve 22.<br>
The pulse tube refrigeration system is typically a closed refrigeration system that pulses a working gas or refrigerant in a closed cycle and in so doing transfers a heat load from a cold section to a hot section.  The frequency and phasing of the pulses is determined by the configuration of the system. One embodiment of a pulse tube refrigeration system is illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
In the pulse tube refrigeration system illustrated in Figure 1, driver 11 may be a piston or some other mechanical compression device, or an acoustic or thermoacoustic wave generation device, or any other suitable device for providing a pulse or compression wave to a working gas.  That is, the pulse generator provides a compression phase and an expansion phase to<br>
the working gas. When the cryogenic vessel is a mobile tank such as a cryogenic tank on a tractor-trailer, the driver or pulse generator may be advantageously driven by the engine which powers the mobile system or may be driven by heat generated by the engine via a thermoacoustic wave generation device. Driver or pulse generator 11 provides a pulse to a working gas to produce a compressed working gas. Helium is the preferred working gas,- however any effective working gas may be used in the practice of this invention and among such one can name air, nitrogen, oxygen, argon and neon.<br>
The compressed working gas is cooled in aftercooler 23 wherein the heat of compression is removed by indirect heat exchange with cooling medium, such as water 24, and the resulting compressed working gas is then processed in regenerator 12.  Within regenerator 12 the compressed working gas is cooled by heat exchange with regenerator media and then cooled compressed working gas is provided to cold heat exchanger 13 and then to the cold end of insulated pulse tube 10.<br>
The geometry and pulsing configuration of the pulse tube refrigeration system is such that before the compression pulse from the driver passing through the working gas reaches the cold end of the pulse tube, the driver initiates the expansion phase.  This causes the cooled compressed working gas at the cold end of the pulse tube to expand.  The cold end of the pulse tube is the end adjacent the cold heat exchanger.  This expansion causes the working gas within the pulse tube to be compressed in the direction of the warm end of<br>
the pulse tube and heat is removed from the warm end typically by use of a hot heat exchanger 25 by indirect heat exchange with cooling medium, such as water 26. Preferably the pulse tube refrigeration system employs an orifice 15 and reservoir 14 to maintain the gas displacement and pressure pulses in appropriate phases.<br>
The warmer compressed pulse tube gas within the warm end of pulse tube 10 is processed in hot heat exchanger 25 and then into reservoir 14 through orifice 15. The gas motion, in appropriate phase with the pressure, is facilitated by incorporating orifice or valve 15 and a reservoir volume 14 where the gas is stored at an average pressure with small fluctuation. The size of reservoir 14 is sufficiently large so that essentially very little pressure oscillation occurs in it during the oscillating flow in the pulse tube.  The inlet flow from the wave-generation device/piston 11 stops and the tube pressure decreases to a lower pressure. Gas from reservoir 14 at an average pressure passes through the orifice to the pulse tube, which is at the lower pressure.  The further cooled expanded gas at the cold end of pulse tube 10 provides the refrigeration to the external load as it passes through the cold heat exchanger 13. Refrigeration from the further cooled working gas is thus passed by indirect heat exchange to the interior 2 of vessel 20 thereby serving to counter heat leak into the vessel and reduce or completely eliminate qryogenic fluid loss from the vessel due to such heat leak.  The resulting warmer working gas is further warmed by processing in regenerator 12 as it cools the regenerator.  Then it is<br>
ready to receive the next pulse.  Cryogenic fluid may be withdrawn from vessel 20 such as through piping 27. The orifice pulse tube refrigerator functions to provide refrigeration as the working fluid goes through cyclic compression and expansion in the pulse tube. The cycle is as follows: the pulse generator through timed compression and expansion phases causes the working gas at its warm end to be compressed and thereby heated.  Since the compressed gas is at a higher pressure than the average pressure in the reservoir, it flows through the orifice into the reservoir and exchanges heat through the hot heat exchanger located at the hot end of the pulse tube. The flow stops when the pressure in the pulse tube is reduced to the average pressure.  The pulse generator moves back and thus expands the gas at its warm end. The cold, low-pressure gas in the warm end of the pulse tube is forced toward the cold end of the pulse tube by the gas flow from the reservoir into the pulse tube through the orifice.  This in turn pushes the further cooled gas at the cold end of the pulse tube to be processed through the heat exchanger at the cold end of the pulse tube.  In this process it removes the heat from the fluid or other entity being cooled.  This flow stops when the pressure in the pulse tube increases to the average pressure.  The cycle is then repeated.<br>
In Figure 1 the cold heat exchanger is shown as being within the vessel interior 2 in the volume occupied by vapor.  The cold heat exchanger could also be positioned so that it delivers at least some refrigeration directly to liquid within the vessel interior.  In another embodiment the cold heat<br><br>
exchanger could be connected to a heat pipe or other heat transfer device which passes the refrigeration to the cryogenic vapor and/or cryogenic liquid within the vessel interior.  In yet another embodiment, the cold heat exchanger could be positioned to deliver refrigeration directly to the insulation within the vessel interior.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another embodiment of the invention wherein a heat pipe is used to deliver refrigeration from the cold heat exchanger to cryogenic liquid within the vessel interior.  The numerals in Figure 2 are the same as those of Figure 1 for the common elements, and these common elements will not be described again in detail.<br>
A heat pipe is a thermal device for efficiently transferring heat from one end of the pipe to its other end.  Typically the device comprises a low conducting pipe, such as stainless steel pipe 50, closed at both ends and containing a heat transfer fluid.  This heat pipe is charged with heat transfer fluid, i.e. gas or gas mixture, at appropriate pressure and temperature so as to change phase by condensing at the end 51 in contact with the cold heat exchanger of the pulse tube and by boiling at the other end 52 in indirect contact with the cryogenic fluid to be condensed or subcooled. For example, to condense vapor or subcool liquid in vessel interior 2 at, for example 80K, the required mass of nitrogen gas within the heat pipe could be determined by the vapor and liquid portions designed for the heat pipe volume corresponding to the phase change condition of nitrogen at 80K.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another embodiment of the invention wherein refrigeration is provided to two places within the vessel interior, one of those places being a thermoshield within the. insulation. The numerals in Figure 3 are the same as those of Figure 1 for the common elements, and these common elements will not be described again in detail.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 cryogenic vessel 20 has a thermoshield 30 within insulation 21 in the vessel interior.  The thermoshield could be any entity which serves to intercept heat leak into the vessel.  For example, it could be metallic material, or it could be a refrigerant, e.g. liquid nitrogen.  In the two stage pulse tube refrigeration system illustrated in Figure 3, cooled compressed working gas from regenerator 12 is divided into two portions. A first portion 32 is processed in second regenerator 31 wherein it is brought to a lower temperature before being processed in cold heat exchanger 13.  The remainder of this stage of the pulse tube refrigeration system operates in a manner similar to that described above with reference to Figure 1.<br>
A second portion 33 of the cooled working gas from regenerator 12 is processed in a second cold heat exchanger 34 which is in heat exchange relation with thermoshield 30.  The second stage of the pulse tube refrigeration system illustrated in Figure 3 which includes second pulse tube 35, second hot heat exchanger 36, second orifice 37, and second reservoir 38, operates in a similar manner to the first pulse tube stage except that the refrigeration generated by this second stage is delivered to the thermoshield<br><br>
within interior 2 rather than to the cryogenic fluid within interior 2.  The two stages could employ two independent pulse tubes with thermal linkage or any other suitable effective configuration.  For purposes of clarity the insulation covering a portion of the cold part of the two stage pulse tube refrigeration system is not illustrated in Figure 3. Those skilled in the art will recognize that in normal operation such part will be insulated.<br>
