				<td>In the above process the 2-amino-6-chloropurine (1) is reacted with 2-acetoxymethyl-4-halobuty-1-yl-acetate (2) to give 9-[4-acetoxy-3-(acetoxymethyl) but-l-yl]-2-amino-6-chloropurine (3) which is then dechlorinated to give Famciclovir (4). Although this process is simple and straightforward, it has a number of disadvantages. The main disadvantage of this process is that N-alkylation reaction is not selective generating the undesired N-7-isomer along with the desired compound 3 in the ratio of ~ 80: 20. The structure of N-7-isomer is depicted below: <br>
It is very difficult to remove the N-7 isomer impurity by conventional crystallization methods and often requires chromatographic separation. Therefore, it results in overall lower yield and low process efficiency. Additionally this process has another problem that the palladium catalyst used in the final step of synthesis result in higher residual palladium content in API product.<br>
US 5,138,057 discloses a process for preparing Famciclovir as shown below:<br><br><br>
The above process for the preparation of Famciclovir has overcome some of the disadvantages of the earlier processes, by way of improving regioselectivity with respect to N-9 and N-7 to a ratio of 94:6. However, this process still suffers from the drawback of high pressure conditions using palladium charcoal for dechlorination in the final stage of synthesis. The Famciclovir obtained has to be purified by column chromatography which is disadvantageous.<br>
US 5,917,041 discloses an alternative approach for the preparation of 2-aminopurine derivatives including Famciclovir wherein N-(2-amino-4,6-dichloro-5-pyrimidinyl)formamide is reacted with 2-acetoxymethyl-4-aminobutyl-1 -yl-acetate to get an intermediate which upon cyclization followed by dechlorination yields Famciclovir as shown below:<br><br><br>
This approach has been applied for the synthesis of Abacavir. It is of interest to note that no examples for the synthesis of Famciclovir or any of its intermediates have been given. This patent describes only the synthesis of Abacavir and its intermediates. The applicant's attempt to follow the above approach of synthesis involving reaction of N-(2-amino-4, 6-dichloro-5-pyrimidinyl)formamide with 2-acetoxymethyl-4-amino-but-l-yl-acetate in presence of a base did not result in the desired product, probably due to the self cyclisation of the side chain.<br>
In the prior art, after reaction of amino side chain with formamido compound (Formula II), the intermediate obtained is cyclized using triethylorthoformate in presence of aqueous acid. A similar approach when applied by the applicants using the 4-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-l-butanol (amino side chain with hydroxyl end group), a problem was encountered in this approach. It was observed that during cyclization step a major impurity is formed, which was subsequently<br><br>
Identified as the 6-ethoxyderivative of purine. Based on this observation, an alternative was thought of wherein dechlorination of the coupled product is carried out first followed by cyclization.<br><br>
R4 is a C1 -C20 linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl, optionally substituted by a C3-6 carbocylic ring, said alkyl group or carbocylic ring being optionally substituted by at least one hydroxy, thiol, C1-2 -alkoxy, acyl, acyloxy, carboxy, -P(O)(OH)2, -O-P(O)(OH)2, C1-5 -mono- or diacylamino, C1-8 -alkoxycarbonylamino or allyloxycarbonylamino group, wherein the term acyl of the definitions of group R4 denotes saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon acyl having 1-10 carbon atoms.<br>
This approach relies on the methodology of protecting the 7-position of the imidazole moiety of the guanine or purine molecule followed by the N-alkylation at the desired N-9 position. In this approach guanosine has been mainly used as a starting material wherein the benzylation of the guanosine is followed by acid hydrolysis to get 7-benzyl guanine derivative which in a number of synthetic steps is converted to desired product.<br>
US 7,041,823 discloses another process for improved selectivity of N-9 alkylated product as shown below:<br><br><br>
The process described above was able to limit the N-7 isomer formation. However, the thallium (I) ethoxide has been used to prepare thallium salt of 2-aminopurine. Thallium ethoxide is highly toxic and highly moisture sensitive which makes it difficult for using in industrial production. Also any trace contamination of thallium in API is unacceptable.<br>
From the above discussion it is obvious that the prior-art process for the preparation of Famciclovir are inherently associated with a number of disadvantages and are not satisfactory from an industrial point of view and therefore not suitable for large scale production. The inventors have now developed a new industrial process that completely eliminates the possibility of N-7 isomer formation and thus making the process less laborious, yielding exclusively Famciclovir with high purity that is suitable to use as a pharmaceutical active ingredient.<br>
Additionally, a new pyrimidine intermediate (Formula V) that is useful for the synthesis of 9-substituted-2-aminopurines such as Famciclovir is described.<br><br>
OBJECTIVES OF INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention is to develop an improved process for the preparation of 9-[(4-acetoxy-3-acetoxymethyl) but-1 -yl]-2-aminopurine without requiring laborious purification and free of impurities that is amenable to use as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel intermediate that can be used for the synthesis of Famciclovir.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of     9-[(4-acetoxy-3-acetoxymethyl) but-l-yl]-2-aminopurine     of<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes an improved process for the preparation of Famciclovir which is suitable for large scale production in high yield and with high purity.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the formation of N-7 isomer so as to yield Famciclovir with good quality and improved yield. This has been achieved by condensing the side chain precursor to the formamide derivative followed by dechlorination and cyclization all in a single reaction solvent and without the need for isolation of intermediates to obtain the 2-aminopurine derivatives which is further acylated to obtain Famciclovir.<br><br>
The compound of Formula II is condensed with the amine of Formula III. The condensation is preferably carried out at reflux temperature in solvents such as ethanol, methanol, n-butanol, isopropanol, t-butanol, acetonitrile or water, most preferably in aqueous ethanol or aqueous isopropanol in the presence of at least one equivalent of a base, such as trialkylamine or potassium or sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, preferably triethylamine, or sodium bicarbonate, more preferably sodium bicarbonate. After completion of reaction, the salts are filtered and the solution containing compound of Formula IV is used as such for next step of dechlorination.<br>
The compound of Formula IV is dechlorinated by catalytic hydrogenation using a metal catalyst in a solvent selected from C1-C6 alkyl acetate,  C1-C6 alcohols or mixtures thereof. The alkyl acetates is preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl acetate. The C1-C6 alcohol is preferably selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol. Most preferably ethanol or aqueous ethanol is used as a solvent for dechlorination. The catalyst is selected from palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium and raney nickel. The preferred catalyst is 5 or 10 % palladium on charcoal. The palladium on charcoal can be wet or dry. The dechlorination reaction can be done either in the presence of base such as triethylamine or in the absence of base. Hydrogen pressure maintained during the reaction is in the range of 4-6 kg/cm and the reaction can be performed at room temperature or at -50 °C. When the reaction is carried out at -50 °C it takes less time to complete the reaction.<br>
Alternatively, the dechlorination can also be performed using a metal catalyst in the presence of hydrogenation transfer source like ammonium formate. When ammonium formate is used the reaction is carried out in aqueous methanol or in aqueous ethanol at reflux temperature.<br>
Accordingly a feature of the invention, is the novel compound of Formula V that can be subjected to ring closure to the corresponding 2-aminopurine derivative of<br><br>
Formula VI without isolation. The novel compound of Formula V are optionally isolated or continued further without isolation in the preparation of Famciclovir.<br>
The synthesis of 9-substituted-2-aminopurines such as compound of Formula VI represents a significant improvement over previously published procedures. In the present process all the reaction steps are performed in one pot and in a single solvent thereby eliminating many operational difficulties normally associated with large-scale operation. The inventors have also found that the previously described procedure for the preparation of Famciclovir following the methods mentioned in US 5,917,041 are not viable. This procedure describes ring closure on substituted pyrimidine to form the imidazole ring of the 9-substittuted-6-chloro-2-aminopurines. The disadvantage observed with this type of ring closure is the formation of numerous impurities, because of the presence of highly labile chloro substituent at C-6 of the resulting purine moiety. One of it is the conversion of 6-chloro into 6-ethoxy group if triethylorthoformate is applied as cyclising agent. Hence, in comparison to US '041, in the process of the present invention, the compound of Formula IV is subjected to dechlorination and then cyclized to furnish the required purine derivative in high purity, yielding substantially better yields and better quality product.<br>
The solution containing compound of Formula V is partially concentrated and hydrogen chloride dissolved in ethanol or methanol is added. The compound of Formula V is subsequently cyclized with an appropriate ring closure agent to give compound of Formula VI. The ring closure of compound of Formula V to compound of Formula VI is conveniently carried out by trialkylorthoformates like triethylorthoformate, trimethylorthoformate and diethoxymethyl acetate in presence of acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid etc more preferably hydrogen chloride. A catalytic quantity of water is optionally added to the reaction mixture to expedite the cyclization process. The cyclization reaction is conducted at about 50°C. The product crystallizes out as its acid addition salt from the reaction mass, which is isolated<br><br>
By filtration. The compound of Formula VI can be further purified by crystallization or taken as such for next stage of synthesis. The hydrochloride salt of compound of Formula VI can be crystallized with ethanol or aqueous ethanol to get highly pure intermediate.<br>
The compound of Formula VI is acylated with a suitable acylating agent in the presence of a base to give compound of Formula I. The acylating agents used is selected from acetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, more preferably acetic anhydride. The base used as catalyst for acylation is selected from pyridine, triethylamine, N,N-dimethylamino pyridine, more preferably triethylamine. The solvent used for the acylation is selected from methylene dichloride, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl formamide, 1,4-dioxane, more preferably methylene chloride. Dimethyl amino pyridine is used as catalyst.<br>
The present invention is exemplified by the following examples which are provided for illustration purposes, and do not limit the scope of invention.<br>
