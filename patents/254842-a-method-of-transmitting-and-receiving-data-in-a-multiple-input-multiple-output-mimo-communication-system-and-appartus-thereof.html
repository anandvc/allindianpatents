				<td>The present invention relates generally to a method of transmitting and receiving data m a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication svstem and apparatus thereof.<br>
Background<br>
A MIMO system employs multiple (T) transmit antennas at a transmitting entity and multiple (R) receive antennas at a receiving entity for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the T transmit antennas and R receive antennas may be decomposed into S spatial channels, where S 
OFDM is a multi-carrier modulation technique that effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into multiple (K) orthogonal frequency subbands. These subbands are also referred to as tones, subcarriers, bins, and frequency channels. With OFDM, each subband is associated with a respective subcarrier that may be modulated with data.<br>
A MIMO-OFDM system is a MIMO system that utilizes OFDM. The MIMO-OFDM system has S spatial channels for each of the K subbands. Each spatial channel of each subband may be called a "transmission channel", Each transmission channel may experience various deleterious channel conditions such as, e.g., fading, multipath, <br>
and interference effects. The transmission channels for the MIMO channel may also experience different channel conditions and may achieve different signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SNRs). The SNR of each transmission channel determines its transmission capacity, which is typically quantified by a particular data rate that may be reliably transmitted on the transmission channel. For a time variant wireless channel, the channel conditions change over time and the SNR of each transmission channel also changes over time. The different SNRs for different transmission channels plus the time varying nature of the SNR for each transmission channel make it challenging to efficiently transmit data in a MIMO system.<br>
[0006]	If the transmitting entity has knowledge of the channel condition, then it may<br>
transmit data in a manner to more fully utilize the capacity of each transmission channel. However, if the transmitting entity does not know the channel condition, then it may need to transmit data at a low rate so that the data transmission can be reliably decoded by the receiving entity even with the worst-case channel condition. Performance would then be dictated by the expected worst-case channel condition, which is highly undesirable.<br>
[0007]	There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to more efficiently transmit<br>
data in a MIMO-OFDM system, especially when the channel condition is not known by the transmitting entity.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008]	Techniques for transmitting data in a manner to achieve more diversity, greater<br>
reliability, and/or improved performance for a MIMO system are described herein. A transmitting entity performs spatial processing on data symbols for each subband to obtain spatially processed symbols for the subband. The spatial processing for each subband may be performed with (1) an eigenmode matrix to transmit the data symbols on orthogonal spatial channels, (2) a steering matrix to transmit each data symbol on multiple spatial channels, or (3) an identity matrix for no spatial processing. In any case, multiple data symbols may be sent from multiple transmit antenna on each subband in each symbol period.<br>
[0009]	The transmitting entity further performs beamforming on the spatially processed<br>
symbols prior to transmission from the multiple transmit antennas. The beamforming may be performed in the frequency domain by multiplying the spatially processed symbols for each subband with a beamforming matrix for that subband. The<br><br>
beamforming may also be performed in the time domain by applying different amounts of delay for different transmit antennas.<br>
[0010]	A receiving entity performs the complementary processing to recover the data<br>
symbols sent by the transmitting entity. The receiving entity may derive an estimate of an actual or effective MIMO channel response based on a pilot sent by the transmitting entity. The receiving entity may derive a spatial filter matrix for each subband based on a MIMO channel response matrix for that subband. The receiving entity may then perform receiver spatial processing for each subband based on the spatial filter matrix for that subband.<br>
[0011]	Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail<br>
below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0024]	FIG. 1 shows a MIMO-OFDM system 100 with an access point (AP) 110 and<br>
user terminals (UTs) 120. An access point is generally a fixed station that communicates with the user terminals and may also be referred to as a base station or some other terminology. A user terminal may be fixed or mobile and may also be<br><br>
referred to as a mobile station, a wireless device, a user equipment (UE), or some other<br>
terminology. For a centralized network architecture, a system controller 130 couples to<br>
the access points and provides coordination and control for these access points.<br>
[0025]	Access point 110 is equipped with multiple antennas for data transmission and<br>
reception. Each user terminal 120 is also equipped with multiple antennas for data transmission and reception. A user terminal may communicate with the access point, in which case the roles of access point and user terminal are established. A user terminal may also communicate peer-to-peer with another user terminal.<br>
[0026}	FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a transmitting entity 210 and a receiving entity<br>
250 in system 100.   Transmitting entity 210 is equipped with multiple (T) transmit<br>
antennas and may be an access point or a user terminal.   Receiving entity 250 is<br>
equipped with multiple (R) antennas and may also be an access point or a user terminal.<br>
[0027]	At transmitting entity 210, a TX data processor 212 processes (e.g., encodes,<br>
interleaves, and symbol maps) traffic/packet data to generate data symbols.   As used<br>
herein, a "data symbol" is a modulation symbol for data, a "pilot symbol" is a<br>
modulation symbol for pilot (which is data that is known a priori by both the<br>
transmitting and receiving entities), a "transmit symbol" is a symbol to be sent on one<br>
subband of one transmit antenna, and a "received symbol" is a symbol obtained on one<br>
subband of one receive antenna. A TX spatial processor 220 receives and demultiplexes<br>
pilot and data symbols onto the proper subbands, performs spatial processing as<br>
described below, and provides T streams of transmit symbols for the T transmit<br>
antennas.   A modulator (MOD) 230 performs OFDM modulation on each of the T<br>
transmit symbol streams and provides T streams of time-domain samples to T<br>
transmitter units (TMTR) 232a through 232t. Each transmitter unit 232 processes (e.g.,<br>
converts to analog, amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) its sample stream to<br>
generate a modulated signal. Transmitter units 232a through 232t provide T modulated<br>
signals for transmission from T antennas 234a through 234t, respectively.<br>
[0028J	At receiving entity 250, R antennas 252a through 252r receive the T transmitted<br>
signals, and each antenna 252 provides a received signal to a respective receiver unit (RCVR) 254. Each receiver unit 254 processes its received signal and provides a stream of input samples to a corresponding demodulator (DEMOD) 260. Each demodulator 260 performs OFDM demodulation on its input sample stream to obtain receive data and pilot symbols, provides the received data symbols to a receive (RX) spatial processor 270, and provides the received pilot symbols to a channel estimator<br><br>
284 within a controller 280. Channel estimator 284 derives a channel response estimate for an actual or effective MIMO channel between transmitting entity 210 and receiving entity 250 for each subband used for data transmission. Controller 280 derives spatial filter matrices based on the MIMO channel response estimates. RX spatial processor 270 performs receiver spatial processing (or spatial matched filtering) on the received data symbols for each subband with the spatial filter matrix derived for that subband and provides detected data symbols for the subband. The detected data symbols are estimates of the data symbols sent by transmitting entity 210. An RX data processor 272 then processes the detected data symbols for all subbands and provides decoded data.<br>
[0029]	Controllers 240 and 280 direct the operation of the processing units  at<br>
transmitting entity 210 and receiving entity 250, respectively. Memory units 242 and 282 store data and/or program code used by controllers 240 and 280, respectively.<br>
[0030]	FIG. 3 shows an OFDM waveform in the frequency domain.  OFDM provides<br>
K total subbands, and the subcarrier for each subband may be individually modulated with data. Of the K total subbands, ND subbands may be used for data transmission, Np subbands may be used for pilot transmission, and the remaining NQ subbands may be unused and serve as guard subbands, where K = ND + Np + NG. In general, system 100<br>
may utilize any OFDM structure with any number of data, pilot, guard, and total subbands. For simplicity, the following description assumes that all K subbands are usable for data and pilot transmission.<br>
[0031J	System 100 may support data transmission using multiple operating modes.<br>
Each operating mode utilizes different spatial processing at the transmitting entity. In an embodiment, each operating mode may utilize (1) "eigensteering" to transmit data symbols on orthogonal spatial channels (or "eigenmodes") of a MIMO channel, (2) "matrix steering" to transmit each data symbol on all S spatial channels of the MIMO channel, or (3) no spatial processing to transmit each data symbol from one transmit antenna. Eigensteering is also called eigenmode transmission or full channel state information (full-CSI) transmission. Matrix steering may be used to achieve spatial diversity. Data transmission without spatial processing is also called partial-CSI transmission. In an embodiment, each operating mode may or may not utilize beamforming to introduce additional diversity for the T sample streams sent from the T transmit antennas.<br><br>
[t|)32]	The operating mode with the combination of matrix steering and beamforming is<br>
called "spatial spreading". The transmitting entity may use spatial spreading to achieve spatial and frequency/time diversity, for example, if the transmitting entity does not know the MIMO channel response.<br>
1. Transmitter Spatial Processing<br>
[0033]	In system 100, the MIMO channel formed by the T transmit antennas at<br>
transmitting entity 210 and the R receive antennas at receiving entity 250 may be characterized by an R x T channel response matrix H(£) for each subband k, which may be given as:<br>
for Ar = 0, ..., K-l,    Eq(l)<br>
where entry hi}{k), for z = 0, .,., R-l and j = Q, ..., T-l, denotes the coupling or<br>
complex channel gain between transmit antenna j and receive antenna i for subband k.<br>
For simplicity, the MIMO channel is assumed to be full rank with S = T 
[0034]	For data transmission with eigensteering, eigenvalue decomposition may be<br>
performed on a correlation matrix of H(fr) to obtain S eigenmodes of H(&amp;), as follows:<br>
B (lr\ — I¥     {1r\    Ttt(]r\ — UVIA     \flr\*TT      flr\	T7*-»   f*)JTV^rv ) — JT1.     \K J    MJi{nrj — Ej\K-J    i±\**'/    j-J     \*^J     9	-^T.  \~)<br>
where R(k) is a T xT correlation matrix of H(k);<br>
E(k) is a T x T unitary matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of R(Jt); A(&amp;) is a T xT diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of R(&amp;); and " H " denotes a conjugate transpose.<br>
A unitary matrix U is characterized by the property U" • U = I, where I is the identity matrix. The columns of a unitary matrix are orthogonal to one another, and each column has unit power. The matrix E(k) is also called an "eigenmode" matrix or a "transmit" matrix and may be used for spatial processing by the transmitting entity to transmit data on the S eigenmodes of H(fc). The eigenmodes may be viewed as<br><br>
orthogonal spatial channels obtained through decomposition.   The diagonal entries of A(£) are eigenvalues of R(£), which represent the power gains for the S eigenmodes.<br>
The eigenvalues in A(A) may be ordered from largest to smallest, and the columns of E(k) may be ordered correspondingly.   Singular value decomposition may also be<br>
performed to obtain matrices of left and right eigenvectors, which may be used for<br>
eigensteering.<br>
[0035]	For data transmission with eigensteering, the transmitting entity may perform<br>
spatial processing for each subband k as follows:<br>
I. (*&gt; = K*) •!(*).	Eq(3)<br>
where s(£) is a vector with up to S data symbols to be sent on subband k; and za (k) is a vector with T spatially processed symbols for subband k.<br>
In general, D data symbols may be sent simultaneously on D (best) eigenmodes of H(£)<br>
for each subband k, where 1 
processed with D columns of E(k) corresponding to the D selected eigenmodes.<br>
[0036]	For data transmission with matrix steering, the transmitting entity may perform<br>
spatial processing for each subband k as follows:<br>
z«(*) = V(*)-s(*),	Eq(4)<br>
where  V(fc) is a unitary steering matrix for subband k\ and<br>
za(k) is a vector with up to T spread symbols for subband k.<br>
Each data symbol in s(£) is multiplied with a respective column of V(&amp;) to obtain up to T spread symbols. The steering matrix V(£) may be generated in a manner to simplify the matrix multiplication in equation (4), as described below.<br>
[0037J	In general, D data symbols may be sent simultaneously on each subband k with<br>
matrix steering, where 1 ^ D 
 <br>
[££38]	For partial-CSI transmission,  the transmitting  entity may perform  spatial<br>
processing for each subband k as follows:<br>
?WW=l(A),	Eq(5)<br>
where z^ik) is a vector with up to T data symbols to be sent on subband k. In effect,<br>
the transmitting entity performs spatial processing with the identity matrix I for partial-CSI transmission.<br>
[0039J	The transmitting entity thus spatially processes the data vector s(A) for each<br>
subband k to obtain a corresponding vector z(k) of spatially processed symbols for that subband. The vector z(&amp;) is equal to za(k) for eigensteering, za(k) for matrix steering, and z^,-^) for partial-CSI transmission.<br>
2.  Beamforming<br>
[0040]	The transmitting entity may selectively perform beamforming on the vector<br>
z(k) for each subband k, as follows:<br>
S(*) = K*)-z(*),	Eq(6)<br>
where  B(/c) is a T x T beamforming matrix for subband k; and<br>
x(£) is a vector with T transmit symbols to be sent from the T transmit antennas for subband k,<br>
If beamforming is not performed, then the beamforming matrix B(Jt) is replaced with the identity matrix I in equation (6).<br>
[0041]	The transmit vector  x^C^)   f°r eigensteering with beamforming may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
xte(*) = fi(*) •£(*)•§(*).	Eq(7)<br>
[0042]	The transmit vector xto(#) f°r spatial spreading, which is matrix steering with<br>
beamforming, may be expressed as:<br>
Eq(8)<br><br>
A matrix B(£)-V(&amp;) may be pre-computed for each subband k. In this case, the transmit vector \bsi(k) may be obtained with a single matrix multiply. The matrices V(£) and B(£) may also be applied in two steps and possibly in different manners. For example, the matrix V(fc) may be applied in the frequency domain with a matrix multiply and the matrix B(£) may be applied in the time domain with circular or linear delays, as described below.<br>
[0043]	The transmit vector xfcM (k) for partial-CSI transmission with beamforming may<br>
be expressed as:<br>
!*,(*) = B(*)-s(*) .	Eq(9)<br>
[0044]	The beamforming matrix B(/r) for each subband k is a diagonal matrix having<br>
the following form:<br><br>
"*(*) 	0                0 <br>
0 	4l(*)   -       0 <br>
0 	o    - M*)_ <br><br>
for £ = 0, ..., K-l,	Eq(10)<br><br>
where 6,.(A) is a weight for subband k of transmit antenna i. As shown in equation (6), the /-th element of z(k) is multiplied by the z'-th diagonal weight in B(&amp;).<br>
[0045]	The beamforming matrices for the K subbands may be defined such that<br>
continuous beamforming is achieved across the K subbands. The beamforming matrix B(A) for each subband k defines an antenna beam for that subband. K different beamforming matrices may be used for the K subbands to obtain different antenna beams across the subbands. The K beamforming matrices may be varied in a continuous manner (instead of an abrupt or discontinuous manner) so that the antenna beams change in a continuous manner across the K subbands. Continuous beamforming thus refers to a continuous change in the antenna beams across the K subbands.<br>
[0046]	In an embodiment, the weights in the beamforming matrix  E(k) for each<br>
subband k are defined as follows:<br>
.2*1-*<br>
g(i)-e   K   ,	forz=0, .... T-l and * = 0, ..., K-l,         Eq (11)<br><br>
where g(i) is a complex gain for transmit antenna /.<br>
10047]	The magnitude of the complex gain for each transmit antenna may be set to one,<br>
or II £(0 II = 1 -0 for / = 0, ..., T - 1 . The weights shown in equation (1 1) correspond to a progressive phase shift across the K subbands of each transmit antenna, with the phase shift changing at different rates for the T transmit antennas. These weights effectively form a different beam for each subband for a linear array of T equally spaced antennas.<br>
[0048]	In a specific embodiment, the weights are defined as follows:<br><br>
K   =<br><br>
Eq(12)<br><br>
for * = 0, ..,, T-l and £ = 0, ..., K-l. The embodiment shown in equation (12) uses g(i) = e'"* for equation (11). This results in a phase shift of zero being applied to subband K II -f 1 for each antenna.<br>
[0049]	FIG. 10 shows plots of the phase shifts for each transmit antenna for a case with<br>
T = 4 . The center of the K subbands is typically considered to be at zero frequency. The weights generated based on equation (12) may be interpreted as creating a linear phase shift across the K subbands. Each transmit antenna i, for i = 0, ..., T-l, is associated with a phase slope of 2^-z7K. The phase shift for each subband k, for k-Q, .... K-l, of transmit antenna i is given as 2;r-z-(£-K/2)/K. The use of<br>
g(0 = e~'** result in subband fc = K/2 observing a phase shift of zero.<br>
|0050]	The weights derived based on equation (12) may be viewed as a linear filter<br>
having a discrete frequency response of G,(k')  for each transmit antenna i.   This discrete frequency response may be expressed as:<br>
G,(*') = */(*' + K/2) = /*T ,	Eq(13)<br>
for i=0, ..., T-l and £' = (-K/2) ... (K/2-1). Subband index k is for a subband numbering scheme that places the zero frequency at subband Ncenter = K/2 . Subband<br>
index k' is a shifted version of subband index A: by K/2,orAr' = yt-K/2. This results in subband zero being at zero frequency for the new subband numbering scheme with index k' . NCCTte, may be equal to some other value instead of K / 2 if index k is defined in some other manner (e.g., k = 1, ..., K ) or if K is an odd integer value.<br><br>
A discrete time-domain impulse response g.(n) for the linear filter may be obtained by performing a K-point inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) on the discrete frequency response Gt(k'}. The impulse response g,.(") may be expressed as:<br><br>
-<br>
Z ,
 <br><br><br>
i        K/2-1     MX—       yZir—<br>
KZ-J	'<br>
*'=-K/2<br>
Eq(14)<br>
= K *,£^f<br>
(<br>
I    for n = —i 0   otherwise<br>
where n is an index for sample period and has a range of n = 0, ..., K -1. Equation (14)<br>
indicates that the impulse response gt-(n) f°r transmit antenna i has a single tap with<br>
unit-magnitude at a delay of i sample periods and is zero at all other delays.<br>
[0052]	Beamforming may be performed in the frequency domain or time domain.<br>
Beamforming may be perfonned in the frequency domain by (1) multiplying K spatially processed symbols z,.(0) through z,(K-l) for each transmit antenna i with K weights<br>
fe(.(0)   through   &amp;((K-1)   for that antenna to obtain K transmit symbols and (2)<br>
performing OFDM modulation on the K transmit symbols for each transmit antenna i to obtain K time-domain samples for that antenna. Equivalently, beamforming may be performed in the time domain by (1) performing a K-point IDFT on the K spatially processed symbols for each transmit antenna i to obtain K time-domain samples for that transmit antenna and (2) performing a circular convolution of the K time-domain samples for each transmit antenna i with the impulse response g,(«) for that antenna.<br>
[0053]	FIG. 4 shows a TX spatial processor 220a that performs beamforming in the<br>
frequency domain and is an embodiment of TX spatial processor 220 at transmitting entity 210. TX spatial processor 220a includes a spatial processor 420 and a beamformer 430. Spatial processor 420 performs spatial processing on the data symbols s(k) for each subband k with the eigenmode matrix E(A), the steering matrix<br><br>
V(&amp;), or the identity matrix I and provides spatially processed symbols z(k) for that<br>
subband. Beamformer 430 multiplies the spatially processed symbols z(&amp;) for each<br>
subband k with the beamforming matrix B(&amp;) to obtain the transmit symbols x(k) for<br>
that subband. Modulator 230 performs OFDM modulation on the transmit symbols for<br>
each transmit antenna i to obtain a stream of OFDM symbols for that antenna.<br>
[0054J	FIG. 5 shows an embodiment of spatial processor 420 and beamformer 430<br>
within TX spatial processor 220a. Spatial processor 420 includes K subband spatial processors 520a through 520k for the K subbands and a multiplexer (MUX) 522. Each spatial processor 520 receives the symbols s0(k) through s^(k) in the vector s(k) for<br>
its subband, performs spatial processing on the data symbols with E(fc), Y(£), or I, and provides spatially processed symbols z0(k) through z^(k) in the vector z(k) for<br>
its subband. Multiplexer 522 receives the spatially processed symbols for all K subbands from spatial processors 520a through 520k and provides these symbols to the proper subbands and transmit antennas.<br>
[0055J	Beamformer 430 includes T multiplier sets 528a through 528t for the T transmit<br>
antennas. For each symbol period, each multiplier set 528 receives the K spatially processed symbols z,.(0) through z,.(K-l) for its transmit antenna /, multiplies these<br>
symbols with K weights 2&gt;.(0) through 6f(K-l) for transmit antenna i, and provides K transmit symbols ;c,.(0) through x,.(K-l) for transmit antenna i. For each symbol<br>
period,. beamformer 430 provides T sets of K transmit symbols for the T transmit antennas.<br>
[0056]	Modulator 230 includes T OFDM modulator 530a through 530t for the T<br>
transmit antennas.   Each OFDM modulator 530 receives the transmit symbols xs(0)<br>
through Xj(K-1) for its transmit antenna /, performs OFDM modulation on the transmit<br>
symbols, and provides an OFDM symbol for transmit antenna i for each symbol period.<br>
(0057J	FIG. 6 shows a block diagram of OFDM modulator 530x, which may be used<br>
for each of OFDM modulators 530a through 530t in FIG. 5. In each OFDM symbol period, one transmit symbol may be sent on each subband. (A signal value of zero, which is called a zero symbol period, is usually provided for each unused subband.) An EDFT unit 632 receives K transmit symbols for the K subbands in each OFDM symbol period, transforms the K transmit symbols to the time domain with a K-point IDFT, and provides a "transformed" symbol that contains K time-domain samples. Each sample is<br><br>
a complex-value to be transmitted in one sample period. A parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 634 serializes the K samples for each transformed symbol. A cyclic prefix generator 436 then repeats a portion (or C samples) of each transformed symbol to form an OFDM symbol that contains K + C samples. The cyclic prefix is used to combat inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading, which is a frequency response that varies across the overall system bandwidth. An OFDM symbol period (which is also referred to herein as simply a "symbol period") is the duration of one OFDM symbol and is equal to K + C sample periods.<br>
[0058]	FIG. 7 shows a TX spatial processor 22Gb that performs beamforming in the<br>
time domain and is another embodiment of TX spatial processor 220 at transmitting entity 210. TX spatial processor 220b includes spatial processor 420 and a beamformer 440. Spatial processor 420 performs spatial processing on the data symbols s(&amp;) for each subband k and provides spatially processed symbols z(£) for that subband. Modulator 230 performs OFDM modulation on the spatially processed symbols for each antenna i and provides a stream of tune-domain samples for that antenna. Beamformer 440 performs beamforming in the time-domain by either circularly shifting or linearly delaying the time-domain samples for each transmit antenna /'.<br>
[0059J	FIG. 8A shows a block diagram of modulator 230 and a beamformer 440a,<br>
which is one embodiment of beamformer 440 in FIG. 7. Modulator 230 includes T OFDM modulators for the T transmit antennas. Each OFDM modulator includes IDFT unit 632, P/S converter 634, and cyclic prefix generator 636, as shown in FIG. 6. The OFDM modulator for each transmit antenna i receives K spatially processed symbols z(.(0) through z,.(K -1) for the K subbands in each symbol period. Within the OFDM<br>
modulator, IDFT unit 632 performs a K-point IDFT on the K spatially processed symbols and provides K time-domain samples. P/S converter 634 serializes the K time-domain samples.<br>
[0060]	Beamformer 440a includes T circular shift units 842a through 842t for the T<br>
transmit antennas. Shift unit 842 for each transmit antenna i receives the K time-domain samples from P/S converter 634 for transmit antenna /, performs a circular shift of the K time-domain samples by i samples, and provides a circular-shifted transformed symbol {z'(n)} containing K samples. In particular, shift unit 842a performs a circular<br>
shift of zero sample on the transformed symbol {z'0(n)} for transmit antenna 234a, shift unit 842b performs a circular shift of one sample on the transformed symbol {z((ri)} for<br><br>
transmit antenna 234b, and so on, and shift unit 842t performs a circular shift of (T -1) samples on the transformed symbol {^., («)} for transmit antenna 234t. T cyclic prefix generators 636a through 636t receive T the circularly-shifted transformed symbols from shift units 842a through 842t, respectively. Each cyclic prefix generator 636 appends a C-sample cyclic prefix to its circularly-shifted transformed symbol {z,'(")) an^ provides an OFDM symbol {*,(«)} containing (K + C) samples.<br>
[0061J	FIG. 8B shows a timing diagram for the T transmissions from the T transmit<br>
antennas for the embodiment shown in FIG. 8A. T different transformed symbols are generated for the T transmit antennas from T different sets of spatially processed symbols, as shown in FIG. 8A. The T transformed symbols are then circularly shifted by different amounts for the T transmit antennas. A cyclic prefix is appended to each circularly-shifted transformed symbol in the normal manner. The T different OFDM symbols are sent from the T transmit antennas at the same time.<br>
(0062]	FIG. 9A shows a block diagram of modulator 230 and a beamformer 440b,<br>
which is another embodiment of beamformer 440 in FIG. 7. Each OFDM modulator performs OFDM modulation on the spatially processed symbols for its transmit antenna and provides a stream of OFDM symbol {#,'(«)} for its transmit antenna. Beamformer<br>
440b includes T digital delay units 844a through 844t for the T transmit antennas. Each delay unit 844 receives the OFDM symbol for its transmit antenna i from the associated OFDM modulator and delays the OFDM symbol by an amount determined by transmit antenna i. In particular, delay unit 844a for transmit antenna 234a delays its OFDM symbol {x'0(n)} by zero sample period, delay unit 844b for transmit antenna 234b<br>
delays its OFDM symbol {*,'(«)} by one sample period, and so on, and delay unit 844t<br>
for transmit antenna 234t delays its OFDM symbol {xj.., («)} by T -1 sample periods.<br>
[0063]	The T different delays may also be provided in the analog domain by transmitter<br>
units 232a through 232t. For example, transmitter unit 232a may delay its modulated signal by zero sample period, transmitter unit 232b may delay its modulated signal by one sample period (or Tsam seconds), and so on, and transmitter unit 232t may delay its<br>
modulated signal by (T -1) sample periods (or (T -1) • T^ seconds). A sample period is equal to Twni = 1 /[BW • (K + C)], where B W is the overall bandwidth of the system in Hertz.<br><br>
[0064]	FIG. 9B shows a timing diagram for the T transmissions from the T transmit<br>
antennas for the embodiments shown in FIG. 9A. T different transformed symbols are generated for the T transmit antennas, as shown in FIG. 9A. The OFDM symbol sent from each transmit antenna is delayed by a different amount.<br>
(0065]	For the embodiments shown in equations (12) through (14) and in FIGS. 8 A and<br>
9A, the delays for the T transmit antennas are in integer numbers of sample periods, or / sample periods for transmit antenna i. Other integer phase shifts, instead of i for transmit antenna i, may also be used for antenna i. Phase slopes that result in non-integer delays for the T transmit antennas (e.g., g(i) = e L, for L&gt;1) may also be implemented. For example, the time-domain samples from each P/S converter 634 in FIG. 8A may be up-sampled to a higher rate (e.g., with a period of T^^ = Tsam/L). The higher rate samples may then be circularly shifted by the associated shift unit 842 by integer numbers of the higher rate sample period, T^^, where T,^ 
Alternatively, each transmitter unit 232 may provide analog delays in integer numbers of rTapstm (instead of T^ ). In general, any amounts of circular or linear delay may be<br>
used for the T transmit antennas. The delays for the T transmit antennas should be unique so that no two antennas have the same delay. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to a different phase characteristic for the beamformer across the K subbands.<br>
[0066]	When the number of transmit antennas is less than the cyclic prefix length (or<br>
T 
thus be implemented by a time delay of i sample periods for each transmit antenna i, as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B. However, as shown in FIG. 9B, the T OFDM symbols are transmitted from the T transmit antennas at different delays, which reduces the effectiveness of the cyclic prefix to protect against multipath delay.<br>
(0067)	Equations (11) and (12) represent a function that provides linearly changing<br>
phase shifts across the K subbands for each transmit antenna. The application of linearly changing phase shifts to symbols in the frequency domain may be achieved by either circularly shifting or delaying the corresponding time-domain samples, as described above. In general, the phase shifts across the K subbands for each transmit<br><br>
antenna may be changed in a continuous manner using any function so that the beams<br>
are varied in a continuous instead of abrupt manner across the subbands. A linear<br>
function of phase shifts is just one example of a continuous function. For a continuous<br>
function, an arbitrarily small change in the function input produces an arbitrarily small<br>
change in the function output. Some other exemplary continuous functions include a<br>
quadratic function, a cubic function, a parabolic function, and so on. The continuous<br>
change ensures that the performance of receiving entities that rely on some amounts of<br>
correlation across the subbands (e.g., to simplify channel estimation) is not degraded.<br>
[0068J	The embodiments shown in FIGS. 8A and 9A illustrate some of the ways in<br>
which beamforming may be performed in the time domain for continuous beamforrning. In general, the beamforming may be performed in various manners and at various locations within the transmitting entity. The beamforming may be performed in the time-domain or the frequency-domain, using digital circuitry or analog circuitry, prior to or after the OFDM modulation, and so on,<br>
[0069]	The   transmitting   entity   may   selectively   perform   beamforming   so   that<br>
beamforming is either enabled or disabled. The decision to either apply or disable beamforming may be made based on various factors such as, for example, the channel condition. If the transmitting entity performs continuous beamforming, or if the receiving entity performs channel estimation without relying on correlation between subbands, then the receiving entity may not need to be aware of whether or not beamforming is being applied.<br>
[0070]	The   transmitting   entity   may   adaptively   perform   beamforming   so   that<br>
beamforming is adjusted in some manner over time. In one embodiment, the transmitting entity may enable or disable beamforming based on channel condition, feedback from the receiving entity, and/or some other factors. For example, the transmitting entity may apply beamforming if the channel is flat fading with unit magnitude complex channel gains that may add to zero or a low value for each subband at a receiving entity.<br>
[0071]	In another embodiment, the transmitting entity may adjust beamforrning in a<br>
predetermined or pseudo-random manner. For time-domain beamforming, the amounts of delay for the T transmit antennas may be varied for each time interval, which may correspond to one symbol period, multiple symbol periods, the time duration between consecutive transmissions of a MIMO pilot (described below), and so on. For example, the transmitting entity may apply delays of {0, 1, 2, ..., T-l} sample periods to the T<br><br>
transmit antennas in one time interval, then delays of {0, 0, 0, .... 0} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in the next time interval, then delays of {0, 2, 4, ..., 2(T-1)} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in the following time interval, and so on. The transmitting entity may also cycle through the delays in a base set in different time intervals. For example, the transmitting entity may apply delays of {0, 1,2, ..., T-l} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in one time interval, then delays of {T-l, 0,1, ,.., T-2} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in the next time interval, then delays of {T-2, T-l, 0, ..., T-3} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in the following time interval, and so on. The transmitting entity may also apply delays in different orders in different time intervals. For example, the transmitting entity may apply delays of {0, 1, 2, ..., T-l} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in one time interval, then delays of {2,1, T-l, ..., 0} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in the next time interval, then delays of {1, T-l, 0, ..., 2} sample periods to the T transmit antennas in the following time interval, and so on. The transmitting entity may also apply fractional (e.g., 0.5,1.5) sample periods of delay to any given transmit antenna.<br>
[0072]	If the receiving entity is unaware that beamforming is being performed, then the<br>
transmitting entity may perform beamforming in the same manner across all symbol periods in each data and pilot transmission interval (e.g., each frame). A data and pilot transmission interval is a time interval in which data as well as a pilot used to recover the data are transmitted. For example, the transmitting entity may use the same set of beamforming matrices B(&amp;) for the K subbands or apply the same set of delays to the T transmit antennas for all symbol periods in each data and pilot transmission interval. This allows the receiving entity to estimate an "effective" MIMO channel response (with beamforming) based on a received MIMO pilot and to perform receiver spatial processing on received symbols for the data and pilot transmission interval with the effective MIMO channel response estimate, as described below.<br>
[0073]	If the receiving entity is aware of the beamforming being performed, then the<br>
transmitting entity may adjust the beamforming across the symbol periods in each data and pilot transmission interval. For example, the transmitting entity may use different sets of beamforming matrices B(£) or apply different sets of delays in different symbol periods. The receiving entity may estimate an initial effective MIMO channel response based on a received MIMO pilot, determine the effective MIMO channel response for each subsequent symbol period / based on the initial effective MIMO channel response<br><br>
estimate and knowledge of the beamforming being applied in symbol period t, and perform receiver spatial processing on received symbols for symbol period t with the effective MIMO channel response estimate for symbol period t.<br>
3. Receiver Spatial Processing<br>
[0074]	For data transmission with eigensteering and beamforming, the receiving entity<br>
obtains R received symbols from the R receive antennas for each subband k, which may be expressed as:<br>
Eq(15)<br>
where  rfcej (k) is a vector with R received symbols for subband k; n(k) is a noise vector for subband Jc, and<br>
is an "effective" channel response matrix observed by data vector s with eigensteering and beamforming, which is:<br>
H(*).B(*)-E(*) .	Eq(16)<br>
For simplicity, the noise is assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (A WON) with a zero mean vector and a covariance matrix of &amp;   = cr2 • I , where a2 is the variance of<br>
— nit	"™<br>
the noise.<br>
[0075]	The receiving entity can recover the data symbols sent by the transmitting entity<br>
using various receiver processing techniques such as a minimum mean square error<br>
(MMSE) technique and a channel correlation matrix inversion (CCMI) technique<br>
(which is also commonly called a zero-forcing technique).<br>
[0076]	For the MMSE technique, the receiving entity may derive a spatial filter matrix<br>
each subband k, as follows:<br>
The spatial filter matrix M"«(^) minimizes the mean square error between the symbol estimates from the spatial filter and the data symbols in s(<br><br>

as follows:<br>
Eq(18)<br>
where jLW^diag [M.(*)-S(*)]]-1;and is the MMSE filtered noise.<br>
The symbol estimates from the spatial filter M^Je(£) are unnormalized estimates of the<br>
data symbols. The multiplication with the scaling matrix De(*0 provides normalized estimates of the data symbols.<br>
[0078J	Eigensteering attempts to send data on the eigenmodes of H(£) . However, a<br>
data transmission with eigensteering may not be completely orthogonal due to, for example, an imperfect estimate of H(fc) , error in the eigenvalue decomposition, finite arithmetic precision, and so on. The MMSE technique can account for (or "clean up") loss of orthogonality in the data transmission with eigensteering.<br>
{0079J	For the CCMI technique, the receiving entity may derive a spatial filter matrix<br>
Mttl-W f°r each subband k, as follows:<br>
MiW-LSS'W-HjW]-1-^*^)  -	Eq(19)<br>

|0081]	The receiving entity may perform spatial processing for the other operating<br>
modes in similar manner, albeit with different effective channel response matrices and different spatial filter matrices. Table 1 summarizes the spatial processing at the transmitting entity for the various operating modes and the effective MIMO channel for each operating mode. For clarity, the index "(&amp;)" for subband is not shown in Error! Reference source not found.. Beamforming may be performed in the frequency domain, as shown Table 1. Linear continuous beamforming may also be performed in the time domain, as described above. In this case, the beamforming matrix B is omitted from the transmit symbol vector x but is still present in the effective MIMO channel response.<br>

Eq (21)<br><br>
where the superscript "x" denotes the operating mode and may be equal to "es" for eigensteering without beamforming, "ss" for matrix steering without beamforming, "ns" for no spatial processing and no beamforming, "bes" for eigensteering with beamforming, "&amp;$s" for matrix steering with beamforming, or "bns" for beamforming<br>

processing may also be performed in the same manner for all operating modes, albeit with the MMSE spatial filter matrices being derived with different effective channel response matrices. An MMSE-based receiver may thus support all operating modes using the same MMSE spatial processing. In equation (21), the term d1 -I may be replaced with the covariance matrix <p of the noise if known.></p>
[0083]	The receiving entity may also derived a CCMI spatial filter matrix M*ccmi(k) for<br>
each subband k, as follows:<br>
Again, the receiving entity may derive the CCMI spatial filter matrix in the same manner for all operating modes, albeit with different effective channel response matrices. The receiving entity may also apply the CCMI spatial filter matrices in the same manner for all operating modes.<br>
[0084]	The receiving entity may utilize other receiver spatial processing techniques to<br>
recover the data symbols, and this is within the scope of the invention.<br>

[0085]	The transmitting entity may transmit a pilot to allow the receiving entity to<br>
estimate the actual or effective MIMO channel response. The pilot may be transmitted in various manners. For example, the transmitting entity may transmit an unsteered MIMO pilot, a steered MIMO pilot, a spread MIMO pilot, and so on. A MIMO pilot is a pilot comprised of multiple pilot transmissions sent from the T transmit antennas. An unsteered MIMO pilot is comprised of up to T pilot transmissions sent from the T transmit antennas, one pilot transmission from each antenna. A steered MIMO pilot is comprised of up to S pilot transmissions sent on the S orthogonal spatial channels. A spread MIMO pilot is comprised of up to S pilot transmissions sent on the S spatial channels with matrix steering.<br>
[0086]	For a MIMO pilot, each of the multiple pilot transmissions is identifiable by the<br>
receiving entity. This may be achieved by:<br><br>
1.	Apply a different orthogonal sequence to each pilot transmission using code<br>
division multiplexing (CDM),<br>
2.	Send the multiple pilot transmissions in different symbol periods using time<br>
division multiplexing (TDM), and/or<br>
3.	Send the multiple pilot transmissions on different subbands using frequency<br>
division multiplexing (FDM).<br>
For FDM, a different set of subbands may be used for each of the multiple pilot transmissions. The subbands used for each pilot transmission may be cycled such that the pilot transmission eventually observes all K subbands. A MIMO pilot may be sent with full transmit power for each transmit antenna using CDM or FDM, which is desirable. A MEMO pilot may also be sent using any combination of CDM, FDM, and TDM.<br>
[0087]	For an unsteered MIMO pilot, the transmitting entity may perform spatial<br>
processing for each subband k used for pilot transmission as follows:<br>
W*.') = W(0 •£(*),	Eq(23)<br>
where  p(£) is a vector of pilot symbols to be sent on subband k; W(r) is a diagonal Walsh matrix for symbol period t; and ?w^o(^) is a vector of spatially processed symbols for the unsteered MIMO ""pilot for subband k in symbol period /.<br>
Different pilot symbols may be sent from the T transmit antennas, as shown in equation (23). Alternatively, the same pilot symbol may also be used for all transmit antennas, in which case the Walsh matrix is simply a Walsh vector.<br>
[0088]	If T = 4, then the four transmit antennas may be assigned 4-symbol Walsh<br>
sequences W, =1, 1, 1, 1, W2 =1, -1, 1, -1, W3 =1, 1, -1, -l,and W4 =1, -1, -1, 1<br>
for the MIMO pilot. The four symbols of Walsh sequence W, are applied to the pilot transmission from transmit antenna j in four symbol periods. W(l) contains the first element of the four Walsh sequences along its diagonal, W(2) contains the second element of the four Walsh sequences, W(3) contains the third element of the four Walsh sequences, and W(4) contains the fourth element of the four Walsh sequences. The/-th Walsh sequence W, for transmit antenna j is thus carried as they'-th diagonal<br><br>
element of all the Walsh matrices.   The four Walsh matrices may be used in four<br>
symbol periods to transmit the unsteered MIMO pilot.<br>
[0089]	The transmitting entity further processes the vector   zflJiffv&gt; (k,t)   for either<br>
beamforming or no beamforming, e.g., in the same manner as the data vector s(k) , to obtain a transmit vector for the unsteered MIMO pilot. The transmitting entity may transmit the unsteered MIMO pilot over T symbol periods by using one Walsh matrix W(/) for each symbol period.<br>
[0090 J	For an unsteered MIMO pilot without beamforming, the receiving entity obtains<br>
received pilot symbols for each subband k used for pilot transmission, as follows:<br>
Eq (24)<br>
The MIMO channel and noise is assumed to be static over the time during which the unsteered MIMO pilot is transmitted. The receiving entity obtains T vectors rn <mf></mf>
through r^,mp(k,T) for T-symbol Walsh sequences used for the unsteered MIMO pilot.<br>
[0091]	The receiving entity may estimate the actual MIMO channel response H(&amp;)<br>
based on the received unsteered MIMO pilot without beamforming.  Each column j of H(&amp;) is associated with a respective Walsh sequence Wy .   The receiving entity may<br>
obtain h,.j(k) , which is the /-th element of they-th column of H(#) by (1) multiplying<br>

The process may be repeated for each element of H(&amp;) . The receiving entity may then use H(A:) to derive the effective MIMO channel response H^-(Jt) or H^(yfc) , which may<br>
be used for receiver spatial processing.<br>
[0092]	For an unsteered MIMO pilot with beamforming, the receiving entity obtains<br>
received pilot symbols for each subband k used for pilot transmission, as follows:<br>

beamforming or no beamforming and may then transmit the steered MIMO pilot.<br>
[0094]	For a steered MIMO pilot without beamforming, the receiving entity obtains<br>
received pilot symbols for each subband k used for pilot transmission, as follows:<br>

5. Steering Matrix<br>
[0097J	A set of steering matrices may be generated and used for matrix steering. These<br>
steering matrices may be denoted as {V}, or V(j) for i = 1 ... L, where L may be any integer greater than one. Each steering matrix V(z) should be a unitary matrix. This condition ensures that the T data symbols transmitted simultaneously using V(i') have the same power and are orthogonal to one another after the matrix steering with V(z).<br>
[0098]	The set of L steering matrices may be generated in various manners.   For<br>
example, the L steering matrices may be generated based on a unitary base matrix and a set of scalars. The base matrix may be used as one of the L steering matrices. The other L -1 steering matrices may be generated by multiplying the rows of the base matrix with different combinations of scalars. Each scalar may be any real or complex value. The scalars are selected to have unit magnitude so that steering matrices generated with these scalars are unitary matrices.<br>
[0099]	The base matrix may be a Walsh matrix.   A 2 x 2 Walsh matrix W2x2 and a<br>
larger size Walsh matrix W2Nx2N maybe expressed as:<br><br>
1      1 1   -1<br><br>
and      W<br><br>
2Nx2N<br><br>
W W<br><br>
NxN<br>
NxN<br><br>
W<br><br>
NxN<br><br>
-Eq(30)<br><br>
Walsh matrices have dimensions that are powers of two (e.g., 2,4, 8, and so on).<br>
[00100]	The base matrix may also be a Fourier matrix.   For an N x N Fourier matrix<br>
DNxN, the elements dnjm of DNxN may be expressed as:<br><br>
for « = 0, ..., N-l and m = 0, ..., N-l.<br><br>
Eq (31)<br><br>
Fourier matrices of any square dimension (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on) may be formed. Other matrices may also be used as the base matrix.<br>
[00101]	For an N x N base matrix, each of rows 2 through N of the base matrix may be<br>
independently multiplied with one of Q different possible scalars.    QN~'  different<br><br>
steering matrices may be obtained from QN~' different permutations of the Q scalars for N -1 rows. For example, each of rows 2 through N may be independently multiplied with a scalar of -*-1, -1, +j,or-j, where j = V—1 • In general, each row of the base<br>
matrix may be multiplied with any scalar having the form eje, where 6 may be any<br>
phase value. Each element of a scalar-multiplied N xN base matrix is further scaled by<br>
1 /V&gt;f to obtain an N x N steering matrix having unit power for each column,<br>
(00102]	Steering matrices derived based on a Walsh matrix (or a 4x4 Fourier matrix)<br>
have certain desirable properties.  If the rows of the Walsh matrix are multiplied with<br>
scalars of +1 and ± j, then each element of a resultant steering matrix V(i) belongs in<br>
a set composed of {+1, -1, + j, -j}. In this case, the multiplication of an element of<br>
another matrix with an element of V(e') may be performed with just bit manipulation.<br>
[00103]	The data transmission techniques described herein may be used for various<br>
wireless systems. These techniques may also be used for the downlink (or forward link) as well as the uplink (or reverse link).<br>
[00104]	Continuous beamforming with or without matrix steering may be used in various<br>
manners. For example, a transmitting entity (e.g., an access point or a user terminal) may use continuous beamforming to transmit to a receiving entity (e.g., another access point or user terminal) when accurate information about the wireless channel is not available. Accurate channel information may not be available due to various reasons such as, for example, a feedback channel that is corrupted, a system that is poorly calibrated, the channel conditions changing too rapidly for the transmitting entity to use/adjust beam steering on time (e.g., due to the transmitting and/or receiving entity moving at a high velocity), and so on.<br>
[00105J	Continuous beamforming may also be used for various applications in a wireless<br>
system. In one application, broadcast channels in the system may be transmitted using continuous beamforming, as described above. The use of continuous beamforming allows wireless devices in the system to receive the broadcast channels with improved reliability, thereby increasing the range of the broadcast channels. In another application, a paging channel is transmitted using continuous beamforming. Again, improved reliability and/or greater coverage may be achieved for the paging channel via the use of continuous beamforming. In yet another application, an 802.11 a access point<br><br>
uses continuous beamforming to improve the performance of user terminals under its coverage area.<br>
[00106]	The transmission techniques described herein may be implemented by various<br>
means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing units at a transmitting entity may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof. The processing units at a receiving entity may also be implemented with one or more ASICs, DSPs, and so on.<br>
|00107]	For a software implementation, some of the processing may be implemented<br>
with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. The software codes may be stored in a memory unit (e.g., memory unit 242 or 282 in FIG. 2) and executed by a processor (e.g., controller 240 or 280). The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor, in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is known in the art,<br>
