METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING PACKET DATA TO<br>
SUPPORT MULTIPLE SERVICES IN A WIRELESS PACKET DATA<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a wireless packet data communication<br>
system, and in particular, to a packet data generating method and apparatus for supporting<br>
the transmission of signaling and control information for multiple services.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Typically, the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) has evolved from the 2nd<br>
generation (2G) standards focusing on the voice service to the 3rd generation (3G) CDMA<br>
standards (CDMA2000) that provide high-speed data service as well as the voice service.<br>
The 3G CDMA mobile communication system supports data rates of up to 3Mbps (Mega<br>
bit per second). The 3G CDMA can transmit more data than the 2G CDMA mobile<br>
communication system that supports 9.6kbps or 14.4kbps. This data transmission<br>
capability enables the provisioning of multiple services including high-quality voice<br>
service, transmission of moving pictures, Internet browsing, etc.<br>
In the first developed CDMA2000 mobile communication system (CDMA2000 lx<br>
system), packet data is transmitted mainly on a supplemental channel (SCH), but voice or<br>
signaling information requiring high reliability is to be transmitted on a fundamental<br>
channel (FCH) or dedicated control channel (DCCH) because the FCH and DCCH are<br>
designed to have a better quality.<br>
An advanced 3G CDMA mobile communication system proposed to<br>
simultaneously support voice service and high-speed packet data service, CDMA2000<br>
lxEV-DV (Evolution-Data and Voice) uses a packet data channel (PDCH) to more stably<br>
deliver voice and packets at a higher rate. The PDCH, having a channel quality as good as<br>
the FCH or DCCH, can deliver information requiring a high transmission probability, for<br>
example, signaling information for call control and RLP (Radio Link Protocol) control in<br>
CDMA2000 lxEV-DV, along with voice and packet data.<br>
In the CDMA2000 lx and CDMA2000 lxEV-DV systems, the MAC (Media<br><br>
-2-<br>
Access Control) layer uses a plurality of MuxPDU (Multiplex sub-layer Protocol Data<br>
Unit) types to support a variety of physical channel types. The MuxPDU Types allow<br>
MuxPDUs to be generated through the multiplexing of various services.<br>
Conventional PDU generation methods define some available multiplexing<br>
methods. Information about the multiplexing method used is written in the header of a<br>
PDU. Especially in a PDU for the FCH, signaling traffic and non-signaling traffic (primary<br>
and secondary traffic) can be multiplexed only in the methods defined by the standards.<br>
At most, the three services, that is, the signaling traffic, the primary traffic and the<br>
secondary traffic, can be multiplexed in one PDU.<br>
Along with the recent diverse user demands, provisioning of multiple services<br>
through an identical connection has emerged as a significant issue. As described before,<br>
however, since up to three types of services can be multiplexed in the conventional PDU<br>
generation methods, user-demanded various types of services cannot be supported.<br>
Moreover, the multiplexing is available only in the predefined methods, thereby<br>
decreasing efficiency in transmitting data of a variable length.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to substantially solve at least the above<br>
problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below. Accordingly,<br>
an object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for generating a<br>
PDU according to the MuxPDU Type supporting a variable length.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for<br>
generating a PDU having in its header a length field to support a variable length.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for<br>
generating a PDU, including in its header a service identifier for identifying a service, in<br>
which different types of service data can be multiplexed.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus<br>
for defining a MuxPDU type using a multiplex option to provide multiple services.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The above objects are achieved by providing a method and apparatus for<br>
supporting multiple services in a wireless packet data communication system where an<br>
MS (mobile station) transmits two or more traffic types to a BS (base station) on one of a<br>
reverse PDCH, a reverse FCH, and a reverse DCCH. To generate a PDU using<br>
non-signaling traffic and/or signaling traffic for one of the reverse physical channels, a<br>
multiplex option is determined during service negotiations between the MS and the BS.<br>
The multiplex option defines a traffic format having a header and a payload including<br>
traffic data, and the header includes a service reference identifier field, a length indicator<br>
field indicating the presence or absence of a length field, and the length field indicating the<br>
length of the traffic data. A PDU is generated by formatting a reverse traffic to have a<br>
header and a payload according to the determined multiplex option.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention pertains to the multiplexing of signaling traffic and<br>
non-signaling traffic in the case where three or more services are provided in a wireless<br>
packet data communication system. According to the present invention, the header of a<br>
PDU includes a length field for supporting a variable length and a service ID field for<br>
identifying a service, to thereby adapt to various service situations.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below in the<br>
context of a CDMA2000 system, particularly a CDMA2000 lxEV-DV system proposed<br>
by 3GPP2 (3rd Generation Partnership Project 2). Yet, it will be obvious to those skilled in<br>
the art that the present invention is applicable to any other mobile communication system<br>
based on similar technology and channel structure.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a layered protocol architecture in an OSI reference model of a<br>
CDMA2000 system to which the present invention is applied. The CDMA2000 system is<br>
used to refer to both the CDMA2000 lx system and the CDMA2000 lxEV-DV system.<br>
The term "layer" used herein refers to software or hardware responsible for performing the<br>
functions of a corresponding layer.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the CDMA2000 system is composed of an upper signaling<br>
layer 10, a data service layer 11, and a voice service layer 12, which correspond to the OSI<br>
layer 3 to layer 7. The CDMA2000 system further includes an LAC (Link Access Control)<br><br>
-5-<br>
layer 13, an RLP layer 14, and a MAC layer 15 in OSI layer 2, and a PHY (PHYsical) layer<br>
16 in OSI layer 1.<br>
Typically, the CDMA2000 system separates by layers the functionalities of a BS<br>
wirelessly connected directly to an MS from those of a base station controller (BSC). That<br>
is, the BS takes charge of the functionalities of layer 1, and the BSC takes charge of the<br>
functionalities of layer 2 to layer 7.<br>
The upper signaling layer 10 processes signaling information for call control and<br>
PHY layer interfacing. The data service layer 11 and the voice service layer 12 process<br>
data traffic and voice traffic, respectively.<br>
The LAC layer 13 creates a control message by attaching a header related to<br>
authentication, sequencing, and addressing, a report field related to radio link quality, and<br>
a length field to signaling information generated from the upper layer signaling layer 10.<br>
The LAC layer 13 then segments to a transmittable size for the MAC layer 15 the control<br>
message and adds a start of message (SOM) bit indicating the start or continuation of a<br>
message to each segment, thereby producing a data unit.<br>
The RLP layer 14 creates a data unit by segmenting to a transmittable size for the<br>
PHY layer 16a data stream generated from the data service layer 11 and numbering the<br>
segments with sequence numbers. Also, the RLP layer 14 generates a data unit out of<br>
control information about a data service in progress in RLP.<br>
The data units generated by both the LAC layer 13 and the RLP layer 14 are called<br>
SDUs (Service Datagram Units). An SDU is classified into signaling traffic or<br>
non-signaling traffic according to its characteristics. The signaling traffic is a signaling<br>
message from the LAC layer 13, and the non-signaling traffic is service data or control<br>
information from the RLP layer 14. The non-signaling traffic is further divided into<br>
primary traffic and secondary traffic according to its service type.<br>
The MAC layer 15 adds a multiplexing header to an SDU received from the LAC<br>
layer 13 or the RLP layer 14 according to the type of a physical channel. The MAC layer<br>
15 has a multiplex sub-layer for multiplexing signaling data and traffic data. A data unit<br>
with a multiplexing header is called a MuxPDU.<br><br>
-6-<br>
The MAC layer 15 constructs a physical channel frame with one or more<br>
MuxPDUs according to the type and data rate of a currently connected physical channel<br>
and transmits it to the PHY layer 16. The PHY layer 16 processes the physical channel<br>
frame by coding, modulation, etc., and transmits the processed frame to another party.<br>
The PHY layer 16 also transmits to the MAC layer 15 at least one PDU included in<br>
a physical channel frame received from another party. The MAC layer 15 then extracts an<br>
SDU from the at least one PDU by analyzing the header of the PDU and transmits the SDU<br>
to a corresponding layer.<br>
Physical channels used for a packet data service in the PHY layer 16 are as follows.<br>
FCH: delivers low-rate traffic data and control information like an existing FCH<br>
ofIS-95;<br>
SCH: delivers mainly low-rate traffic data like an existing SCH of IS-95; and<br>
PDCH: stably delivers traffic data at high rate.<br>
The MAC layer 15 uses a plurality of MuxPDU Types to support the above<br>
different physical channels. The MuxPDU Types will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
2.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates the formats of MuxPDU Types in a CDMA system. A full rate<br>
(rate 1) is 9600bps, rate 1/2 is 4800bps, rate 1/4 is 2400bps, and rate 1/8 is 1200bps. The<br>
data rates determine physical channel frame sizes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, MuxPDU Type 1 transmits signaling information, primary<br>
traffic and secondary traffic on a physical channel that supports 1200 to 9600bps.<br>
MuxPDU Type 2 supports data rates up to 14400bps for similar usages to MuxPDU Type<br>
1. Both MuxPDU Type 1 and MuxPDU Type 2 are used to transmit control information<br>
and traffic data on the FCH and the DCCH. The primary traffic and secondary traffic are<br>
service data, or RLP control information from the RLP layer, discriminated from signaling<br>
information for call control from the upper signaling layer. The primary and secondary<br>
traffic are separated according to the service type of data or control information.<br><br>
-7-<br>
MuxPDU Type 3 transmits traffic data from the RLP layer on the SCH at or below<br>
14400bps. MuxPDU Type 4 transmits particular (relatively short) control messages on the<br>
FCH.<br>
The size of the payload in a MuxPDU Type 1, 2, 3, and 4 is fixedly determined<br>
according to the size of the signaling information or the RLP control information. A<br>
receiver can detect the payload size from a received PDU, especially its header. On the<br>
other hand, the PDCH proposed for the CDMA2000 lxEV-DV system supports only the<br>
MuxPDU Type 5 having a field indicating a payload length in order to support a variable<br>
data rate.<br>
MuxPDU Type 5 is used to transmit traffic data from the RLP layer on the PDCH.<br>
A PDU of the MuxPDU Type 5 includes a field indicating a payload length.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the structure of a PDU of MuxPDU Type 5 in detail.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the PDU of MuxPDU Type 5 comprises a Header having a<br>
length of 6, 14 or 22 bits, a 0- or 10-bit Extension Header, and a Payload.<br>
The Header includes 3-bit SR_ID (Service Reference Identifier), 1-bit Extension<br>
Indicator, 2-bit Length Indicator, and Length (LEN) having a length of 0, 8 or 16 bits. The<br>
Extension Indicator indicates the presence or absence of the following Extension Header.<br>
The Length Indicator indicates the presence or absence of the following LEN and<br>
describes the LEN if the LEN exists. The LEN is 8 or 16 bits, representing the length of the<br>
Payload in bytes. Thus, the length of the Header of the MuxPDU Type 5 is 6, 14 (8-bit<br>
LEN included), or 22 bits (16-bit LEN included).<br>
As to the meaning of the SR_ID, "000" indicates signaling, "001" to "110"<br>
indicate service indexes, and "111" indicates a null service. A service index identifies the<br>
type of a service maintained through a single call connection. When the Length Indicator<br>
is "00", it implies the absence of the LEN. If it is "01", the LEN is 8 bits, if it is 10, the<br>
LEN is 16 bits, and if it is "11", the Payload has a fixed length.<br>
The Length Indicator indicates whether or not the following LEN exists and, if the<br>
LEN exists, describes the LEN. The LEN provides the length of the Payload in bytes. The<br><br>
-8-<br>
Extension Header exists only when the Extension Indicator is 1. The extension header is<br>
used to expand the usage of the PDU of the MuxPDU Type 5.<br>
If the Extension Header is "01", it includes a 2-bit Encapsulation MuxPDU Type,<br>
2-bit Encapsulated MuxPDU Size, and a 4-bit Reserved for byte arrangement. The<br>
Encapsulation MuxPDU Type, Encapsulated MuxPDU Size, and Reserved are<br>
collectively called the Encapsulation Header.<br>
The Encapsulation MuxPDU Type indicates the MuxPDU Type of the following<br>
Payload. As for the meaning of the Encapsulation MuxPDU Type, "01" indicates<br>
MuxPDU Type 1, "10" indicates MuxPDU Type 2, "11" indicates MuxPDU Type 4, and<br>
"00" is a reserved value.<br>
The Encapsulated MuxPDU Size indicates the size of a service unit in the Payload<br>
for the FCH supporting the full rate, rate 1/2, rate 1/4 and rate 1/8. That is, "00" indicates<br>
the full rate, "01 "indicates rate 1/2, '10" indicates rate 1/4, and "11" indicates rate 1/8. For<br>
example, when a service unit of the MuxPDU Type 1 for anFCH at the full rate of 9.6kbps<br>
is generated, the size of the service unit is 168 bits.<br>
If the data is transmitted on the FCH or the DCCH, the MuxPDU Type 1, 2 or 4 is<br>
used. The MuxPDU Type 4 delivers relatively short data on the FCH or DCCH for a short<br>
time of 5ms. In the MuxPDU Type 4, a PDU is formed with only one SDU, without<br>
multiplexing. The MuxPDU Type 1 and the MuxPDU Type 2 allow for signaling traffic<br>
and up to two non-signaling traffic (primary and secondary traffic) to be multiplexed in<br>
one PDU.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates multiplexing methods for the MuxPDU Type 1 and the MuxPDU<br>
Type 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MuxPDU Type 1, with a multiplex option set to "0x1",<br>
defines 12 multiplexing methods. For example, for the full rate, a header "1101" indicates<br>
a combination of 40-bit primary traffic and 128-bit secondary traffic. The MuxPDU Type<br>
2, with a multiplex option set to "0x2", defines 25 multiplexing methods. For example, for<br>
rate 1/2, a header "1100" indicates a combination of 20-bit primary traffic and 101-bit<br>
secondary traffic.<br><br>
-9-<br>
Thus, different traffics are multiplexed in one PDU according to a predetermined<br>
multiplexing rule and information about the multiplexing rule is written in the header of<br>
the PDU. Due to the preset data sizes, however, this multiplexing method decreases<br>
multiplexing efficiency. In order to increase the maximum number of available traffic<br>
types to be multiplexed, the size of the header is increased as much as the number of<br>
available combinations of the traffic types.<br>
The present invention adopts the MuxPDU Type 7 supporting a variable length to<br>
efficiently multiplex the SDUs having diverse characteristics.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the structure of a PDU of the MuxPDU Type 7 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the PDU of the MuxPDU Type 7 is composed of a Header and<br>
a Payload. The Payload includes at least part of the signaling traffic or the non-signaling<br>
traffic. The MuxPDU Type 7 Header includes a 3-bit SR_ID (Service Reference<br>
Identifier), a 1-bit Length Indicator indicating the presence or absence of Length, and a 0-<br>
or 4-bit Length.<br>
The SR_ID of the MuxPDU Type 7 discriminates the signaling traffic and six<br>
different non-signaling traffic, compared to the SR_ID of the MuxPDU Type 5. The<br>
values of the SR_JD of the MuxPDU Type 7 will be described below with reference to FIG.<br>
6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the SR_ID identifies signaling traffic by "000" and six<br>
different non-signaling traffics by "001" to "110". If the SR_ID is "111", it indicates a null<br>
service, implying that the MuxPDU is full. As described above, "001" to "110" of the<br>
SR_K&gt; identify packet data services maintained through a single call connection.<br>
The Length Indicator is a 1-bit flag indicating whether the Length field follows.<br>
Only when the Length Indicator is "1", the Length is included in the MuxPDU Type 7<br>
Header. The header is a 0- or 4-bit field representing the size in octets of the Payload. The<br>
length of the Payload is 2 octets greater than the value of the Length. Thus, the Payload<br>
length is set to (Length+2). Since the Payload length is expressed in octets, if a 4-bit<br>
Length field is used, 0 to 15 can be represented by 4 bits. As described above, because the<br><br>
- 10-<br>
Payload length is "Length+2", it can be set to up to 17 bytes (=15+2), namely 136bits<br>
(=17x8).<br>
If the Length Indicator is "0", the Length is omitted. Thus, the Header is 4 bits and<br>
it is considered that the Payload occupies the remaining physical frame. FIG. 7 illustrates<br>
the format of an exemplary MuxPDU Type 7 physical channel frame with six<br>
non-signaling traffic and one signaling traffic according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The Length is 4 bits and the size of a PDU for a 20-ms FCH frame at 9.6kbps is<br>
172 bits except a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) for error correction.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, the 172-bit PDU has six non-signaling traffic and one<br>
signaling traffic multiplexed therein. The six non-signaling traffic have SR_ED set to<br>
"001" to "110", respectively, and the non-signaling traffic has SRJD set to "000".<br>
A MuxPDU Type for a physical channel is set according to the multiplex option<br>
information exchanged between an MS and a BS during a service setup. The multiplex<br>
option information is a value that indicates a set (rate set) of a MuxPDU type, the PDU<br>
sizes, and the data rates for a corresponding service. During the service setup, the MS and<br>
the BS exchange information about a preset multiplex option, to thereby determine a<br>
MuxPDU Type for use during the communications. To use the MuxPDU Type 1 or the<br>
MuxPDU Type 2 during the communications, the MS and the BS exchange a multiplex<br>
option of "0x01" (rate set 1) or a multiplex option of "0x02" (rate set 2). It is preferable to<br>
set a multiplex option greater than "0x10" for the MuxPDU Type 7 of the present<br>
invention in order to avoid confusion between the MuxPDU Type 7 and existing other<br>
MuxPDU Types. Formation of the multiple option for MuxPDU Type 7 will be described<br>
below with reference to FIGs. 8 and 9.<br>
FIG 8 illustrates a rule by which a multiplex option greater than "0x10" is set<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 8, starting with the most significant bit (MSB) of the multiplex<br>
option for the MuxPDU type 7, a 3-bit Format_Descriptor describes the format of the<br>
multiplex option. It is set to only "000" indicating Format 1. That is, without additionally<br>
setting a particular format that discriminates this multiplex option from other multiplex<br>
options, only Format 1 is used.<br><br>
-11 -<br>
The MuxPDU_Type is 3 bits long to identify the MuxPDU Type 7 from the<br>
MuxPDU Type 1 to the MuxPDU Type 6. Therefore, the 3-bit MuxPDU_Type is set to<br>
"100" indicating the MuxPDU Type 7.<br>
The following 2-bit field, Data_Block_Size is set to "11" indicating a variable<br>
length because the MuxPDU Type 7 has a variable length. The 6-bit Max_Data_Blocks is<br>
set to "000000" indicating no limit in the number of blocks, or one of "000001" to<br>
"001000". "000001" means that only one block is included in the PDU and "001000"<br>
means that eight blocks are included in the PDU. The two least significant bits (LSBs:<br>
Rate_Set) indicate a rate set. It is set to "01" for rate set 1 (9.6kbps family) and "10" for<br>
rate set 2 (14.4kbps family). Hence, final available multiplex options are 0x1301, 0x1302,<br>
0x1305, and 0x1306. Since two values are variable as Rate_Set and Max_Data_Blocks<br>
each, a total of four multiplex options become available.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates in detail the structures of the multiplex options 0x1301 and<br>
0x1302 from among the final available multiplex options, 0x1301, 0x1302, 0x1305, and<br>
0x1306.<br>
The multiplex option 0x1301 will be described. "1301", which is a hexadecimal<br>
number, is equivalent to a binary number "1001100000001". Adding "000" to the binary<br>
number results in "0001001100000001".<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the multiplex option 0x1301 is composed of a<br>
Format_Descriptor set to "000" as the MSBs, a MuxPDU_Type set to "100", a<br>
Data_Block_Size set to "11", a Max_Data_Blocks set to "000000" indicating the<br>
maximum number of MuxPDUs in a physical SDU, and a Rate_Set set to "01". The<br>
multiplex option 0x1301 has Rate_Set set to "01" indicating rate set 1 (9.6kbps family).<br>
With reference to FIG. 10, an operation for establishing a call and negotiating a<br>
physical channel and a multiplex option between an MS and a BS will be described. While<br>
the names and flow of messages related to the establishment of the physical channel and<br>
the setting of the multiplex option are shown and described in detail, it is obvious that the<br>
details can be changed depending on a system used, system configuration, or operation<br>
intention.<br><br>
-12-<br>
Referring to FIG 10, upon arrival of traffic destined for the MS from a network to<br>
the BS, the BS transmits a General Page Message to the MS to establish a call for a packet<br>
data service in step (a). In step (b), the MS tells the BS if it accepts the call and which<br>
channel it supports by a Page Response Message. The MS supports the PDCH and a<br>
common power control channel (CPCCH) on a forward link (FL) and the FCH or DCCH<br>
on a reverse link (RL).<br>
In step (c), the transmits to the MS FL and RL channel assignment information by<br>
an Extended Channel Assignment Message (ECAM). The MS and the BS acquire the<br>
assigned channels in step (d).<br>
In step (e), the MS and the BS set information about a service to be provided by<br>
exchanging a Service Request Message, a Service Connect Message, and a Service<br>
Connect Complete Message. In the above messages, the MS or the BS sets a service<br>
configuration record (SCR) that provides a multiplex option, a physical channel, the size<br>
of a physical channel frame, and the radio configuration (RC) information required for the<br>
provisioning of the service. The BS or MS determines if the service can be supported as<br>
configured in the SCR, by analyzing the SCR and, if it can be supported, transmits the<br>
Service Connect Complete Message to the MS or BS.<br>
The MS and the BS establish RLP and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)<br>
synchronization and exchanges user traffic according to the SCR in step (f).<br>
While the multiplex option of the MuxPDU Type 7 is so configured as not to be<br>
identical to other MuxPDU Types in the above embodiment, it is further contemplated as<br>
another embodiment that a mixed-mode MuxPDU Types are created by mixing the basic<br>
multiplex options, the MuxPDU Type 1 and the MuxPDU Type 2, with the MuxPDU Type<br>
7. The mixed-mode MuxPDU Types will be described with reference to FIGs. 11A and<br>
11B.<br>
FIG 11A illustrates the format of mixed-mode the MuxPDU Type 1 according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention and FIG. 11B illustrates the format of the<br>
mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 2 according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
-13-<br>
Referring to FIG. 11 A, the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1 defines 12 multiplexing<br>
methods. Three service types are available: primary traffic, signaling traffic, and the<br>
MuxPDU Type 7. These three services are transmitted in one PDU. A Header of the<br>
mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1 includes a Mixed Mode (MM), a Traffic Type (TT), and a<br>
Traffic Mode (TM). For example, if MM is "1", TT is "1", and TM is "01" for the full rate<br>
(9600bps), the primary traffic is 40 bits and the MuxPDU Type 7 is 128 bits. According to<br>
this setting, the MS combines the traffic in one PDU for transmission.<br>
At the full rate, the FCH and the DCCH are used. At rate 1/2 (4800bps), rate 1/4<br>
(2400/2700bps), and rate 1/8 (1200/1500bps), only the FCH is used without the DCCH<br>
and only 80-, 40- and 16-bit primary traffic are available, respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11B, the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 2 defines 17 multiplexing<br>
methods. Three service types are available: primary traffic, signaling traffic, and the<br>
MuxPDU Type 7 like mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1. A Header of the mixed-mode<br>
MuxPDU Type 2 includes an MM and a Frame Mode (FM). For example, if the MM is "1"<br>
and the FM is "0110" for the full rate (14400bps), primary traffic is 20 bits and the<br>
MuxPDU Type 7 is 242 bits. According to this setting, the MS combines the traffics in one<br>
PDU for transmission.<br>
At the full rate, the FCH and the DCCH are used. At rate 1/2 (7200bps), rate 1/4<br>
(3600/2700bps), and rate 1/8 (1800bps), only the FCH is used without the DCCH. If the<br>
MM is "1" and the FM is "001" for rate 1/2 (7200bps), the primary traffic is 20 bits and the<br>
signaling traffic is 101 bits. If the MM is "1" and the FM is "00" for rate 1/4 (3600bps), the<br>
primary traffic is 20 bits and the signaling traffic is 32 bits. According to this setting, the<br>
MS combines the traffics in one PDU for transmission.<br>
The MS and the BS establish a call and negotiate a physical channel and a<br>
multiplex option using the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1 and the mixed-mode MuxPDU<br>
Type 2 in the same manner as described with reference to FIG 10. One thing to note in<br>
relation to the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1 and the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 2 is that<br>
the MS and the BS must agree on the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1 and the mixed-mode<br>
MuxPDU Type 2 at a service setup to use the mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 1 and the<br>
mixed-mode MuxPDU Type 2.<br><br>
-14-<br>
The major effect of the present invention as described above is that the use of a<br>
MuxPDU Type of a variable length, allowing up to seven different services to be<br>
multiplexed, easily adapts to various service situations.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
