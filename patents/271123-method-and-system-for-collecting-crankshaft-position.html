				<td>ETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING CRANKSHAFT POSITION<br>
DATA<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure is related to an internal combustion engine<br>
crankshaft position sensing.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Combustion within an internal combustion engine is a time<br>
sensitive process in which the opening and closing of valves, fuel injection,<br>
and spark ignition must occur at precise times in relation to the stroke of the<br>
associated cylinder in order to meet emission, performance and efficiency<br>
objectives. Measuring crankshaft position is a known method to approximate<br>
cylinder positions. One method to measure crankshaft position is to link a<br>
target wheel to the crankshaft and sense the target wheel rotation. This target<br>
wheel includes features which allow individual revolutions of the wheel and<br>
fractions thereof to be sensed.<br>
[0003] As already mentioned, timing is very important to the combustion<br>
process. Small manufacturing variations and dynamic system conditions may<br>
introduce errors crankshaft position measurements via a target wheel. These<br>
errors may compromise the combustion process, so it is therefore<br>
advantageous to quantify these errors and adapt to them. While a portion of<br>
these errors are driven by manufacturing variations that can be measured while<br><br>
the engine is stationary, the effects of the dynamic system forces interact with<br>
these manufacturing variations and may not be discounted. In addition, the<br>
system experiences additional deformations while in an acceleration mode, a<br>
deceleration mode, or while being driven by the combustion process.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A method for collecting crankshaft position data includes rotating a<br>
crankshaft of an engine within a selected angular velocity range without any<br>
fuel being applied to the engine and measuring crankshaft position data.<br>

disclosure; and<br><br>
[0011] FIG. 6 is a plot of crankshaft angular velocity versus time in<br>

disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012]	Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for<br>
the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIG. 1 depicts a hybrid drive system 10 which<br>
has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.<br>
The hybrid drive system 10 depicted includes an engine 20, a crankshaft 25,<br>
an electric motor 30, a transmission assembly 40, a target wheel assembly 70,<br>
a crankshaft position sensor 60, and an output shaft 90. Engine 20 and electric<br>
motor 30 operate in tandem with transmission assembly 40. Transmission<br>
assembly 40 may receive power from engine 20, motor 30, output shaft 90, or<br>
sub-combinations thereof; transmission assembly 40 may also transmit power<br>
to engine 20, motor 30, output shaft 90, or sub-combinations thereof. This<br>
embodiment of the disclosure provides power from motor 30 to engine 20<br>
through transmission assembly 40 for the purpose of rotating crankshaft 25.<br>
Crankshaft 25 is a component of engine 20 which acts to transform power<br>
from and to pistons in the engine. This embodiment of the disclosure further<br>
incorporates a target wheel assembly 70 located in-line between engine 20 and<br>
transmission assembly 40; however, it should be appreciated that target wheel<br>
assembly 70 may be replaced by any device capable of quantifying the<br>
rotational position of crankshaft 25. Crankshaft position sensor ("sensor") 60<br><br>
is positioned within target wheel assembly 70 such that sensor 60 may<br>
measure rotational data related to the position of crankshaft 25. Data<br>
collection module 50 is in communication with sensor 60 to collect any data<br>
gathered by sensor 60.<br>
[0013] FIG. 2 depicts the interaction between target wheel assembly 70,<br>
sensor 60, and data collection module 50 according to an embodiment of the<br>
disclosure. Data collection module 50 may contain a data processor 55, or it<br>
may simply contain or link to a port by which data may be collected by a<br>
device outside the system. Target wheel assembly 70 contains target wheel 72<br>
connected to target wheel shaft 74. Target wheel shaft 74 is connected to<br>
transmission assembly 40 and crankshaft 25 in such a way that any rotation of<br>
crankshaft 25 creates a substantially matching or proportional rotation of<br>
target wheel 72.<br>
[0014] FIG. 3 depicts the internal workings of target wheel assembly 70<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. Sensor 60 interacts<br>
with target wheel 72, such that sensor 60 may gather detailed data regarding<br>
each rotation of target wheel 72. This particular embodiment of the disclosure<br>
illustrates the use of a plurality of target wheel raised indicators 76 in<br>
conjunction with a magnetic crankshaft position sensor 60. Magnetic sensors<br>
may be used to detect a change in metallic mass located proximately to the<br>
sensor. As the wheel rotates, each individual raised indicator 76 creates an<br>
impulse in sensor 60, and that impulse is relayed to data collection module 50.<br>
Target wheel 72, in this particular embodiment, incorporates a blank section<br>
78 where no indications are found. This particular embodiment omits two<br><br>
raised indicators 76, and the area is left flush with the main body of target<br>
wheel 72. The blank section 78 acts as a rotational index, such that any<br>
subsequent processing of the data collected may distinguish between particular<br>
impulses. As aforementioned, the target wheel assembly 70 is connected to<br>
the crankshaft 25 so that any rotation of crankshaft 25 creates a substantially<br>
matching or proportional rotation of target wheel 72. In this particular<br>
embodiment, the crankshaft 25 is attached to the target wheel assembly 70<br>
with such timing that blank section 78 correlates to an index cylinder of<br>
engine 20 being in top dead center position. As target wheel 72 rotates past<br>
blank section 78, engine control features may time engine functions to<br>
subsequent rotation readings relative to the known position of blank section 78<br>
and hence the top dead center position of the index cylinder of the engine.<br>
Functions which may be calibrated to known cylinder locations include valve<br>
timing, spark timing, and fuel injector timing. While this preferred<br>
embodiment is pictured utilizing raised indicators 76, many different forms of<br>
indication could be used, including depressions in place of the raised<br>
indicators 76, notches cut in place of the raised indicators 76, optically<br>
recognizable stripes or other patterns, or any other form of indication which<br>
could be translated into a data stream from a spinning wheel or shaft. Blank<br>
section 78 is utilized in this embodiment as the index indicator, however, it<br>
should also be appreciated by those having skill in the art that any non-<br>
symmetrical or non-perfectly repeating arrangement of the pattern of<br>
indicators used could be utilized to create an index indication.<br><br>
[0015] As the timing of an index cylinder may be correlated to the target<br>
wheel 72, so too can the timing of the remaining cylinders. A plurality of<br>
crankshaft positions may be used in connection to individual raised indicators<br>
76 and correlated to the known timing of the multiple cylinders of engine 20.<br>
In this way, the target wheel assembly 70 may be used in the control of<br>
cylinder to cylinder engine functions.<br>
[0016] The target wheel 72 is utilized in the control engine functions for<br>
engine 20; however, manufacturing variances in a particular vehicle can stack<br>
up to create variances in the location of the raised indicators 76 to the angular<br>
position of crankshaft 25 and hence the desired index cylinder top dead center<br>
position. The sources of these variances include the attachment of target<br>
wheel shaft 74 to crankshaft 25, the attachment of target wheel 72 to target<br>
wheel shaft 74, variances in the formation of raised indicators 76 upon target<br>
wheel 72, the deformation of components of hybrid drive system 10 as a result<br>
of stress caused by system wide forces created in the spinning of engine 20, or<br>
variances in the operation of sensor 60 or data collection module 50. These<br>
variances may be in the form of a variance in the entire target wheel 72 to<br>
crankshaft 25, indicating that every raised indicator is out of position by a<br>
certain amount, and these variances may additionally be in the form of<br>
variances in a particular raised indicator 76 to the target wheel 72 and the<br>
index created by blank section 78. In whatever form, the variances could<br>
compromise operations of the combustion cycles taking place in engine 20<br>
which are cylinder position dependent. Therefore, it is advantageous if a<br>
crankshaft error factor for the entire target wheel 72 or crankshaft error factors<br><br>
for each individual raised indicator 76 are utilized by the engine control device<br>
to improve engine timing. In this way, the crankshaft position data taken from<br>
target wheel assembly 70 by sensor 60 may be used to improve the<br>
performance of engine 20.<br>
[0017] As previously mentioned, one source of variances that can reduce<br>
the accuracy of the target wheel assembly 70 to the position of crankshaft 25 is<br>
the deformation of components of hybrid drive system 10 as a result of stress<br>
caused by system wide forces created in the operation of engine 20. At a<br>
given engine velocity, some of these forces will always be present but stable.<br>
However, other deformation causing forces are variable and could reduce the<br>
accuracy of any crankshaft error factor calculations. A primary example of<br>
such a variable force is the force of combustion caused by the operation of<br>
engine 20. As the fuel-air mix is combusted in the cylinder chamber, a violent<br>
reaction takes place. This combustion reaction is variable and can be affected<br>
by any number of factors, including but not limited to fuel composition,<br>
altitude of the vehicle, the tuned setting of engine 20, and the temperature of<br>
the engine block. Because of the highly variable nature of combustion<br>
reactions, a known technique for calculating crankshaft error factors was<br>
performed by using the combustion of engine 20 to rotate the engine up a<br>
certain angular velocity, cut off all fuel to the engine, and take data<br>
measurements from target wheel assembly 70 as the engine decelerated<br>
without fueled power. While this method accomplished the elimination of<br>
combustion reaction forces from the target wheel 72 data measurements, the<br>
test had to include interpolation of what the target wheel assembly would do at<br><br>
a steady velocity. As previously mentioned, system-wide forces resulting<br>
from the rotation of engine 20 are steady only at a steady or nearly-steady<br>
velocity. The data measurements of the known test contained an error related<br>
to the deceleration of engine 20 and only yielded a snap-shot picture of<br>
crankshaft 25 at a particular engine velocity. A method of calculating<br>
crankshaft error factors at a steady or nearly steady engine velocity without<br>
any fuel being applied to engine 20 has the advantage of eliminating any error<br>
associated with the deceleration of engine 20 and of allowing statistical<br>
manipulation of a series of data measurements taken at a constant engine<br>
velocity.<br>
[0018] Electric motors such as electric motor 30 in hybrid drive system 10<br>
create the potential for rotating crankshaft 25 at a steady or nearly steady<br>
engine velocity. As aforementioned, transmission assembly 40 allows the<br>
transmission of power in several directions. In this particular embodiment,<br>
electric motor 30 provides power to transmission assembly 40, which, in turn,<br>
provides power to engine 20 through crankshaft 25. In this way, the<br>
crankshaft 25 may be driven within a selected angular velocity range without<br>
any fuel being applied to engine 20, and data measured from target wheel<br>
assembly 70 may be utilized to calculate crankshaft error factors for that<br>
steady engine velocity. While this embodiment utilizes an electric motor 30<br>
supplied as part of hybrid drive system 10 to drive crankshaft 25 in a un-fueled<br>
condition, it will be appreciated that the same method could be employed by<br>
other means, such as backdriving the engine by attaching an electric motor to<br>
an engine 20 and target wheel assembly 70 combination in a manufacturing<br><br>
setting or, in a vehicular application, by the linking of the vehicle to some test<br>
apparatus (e.g. a dynamometer) that can act to spin the wheels of the vehicle<br>
under external power and backdrive the engine through the final drive and<br>
transmission. Additionally, steady state unfueled engine rotation may be<br>
achieved by backdriving the engine during vehicle coasting through the<br>
transmission. Additionally, the back driven engine speed in hybrid drive<br>
configurations may be maintained via the electric motor and transmission gear<br>
set.<br>
[0019] FIG. 4 illustrates a crankshaft error factor test run in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the disclosure. Electric motor 30 is utilized to power<br>
engine 20 and crankshaft 25 to a selected angular velocity. An ideal selected<br>
angular velocity is chosen based upon test data to perform the crankshaft error<br>
factor calculations. No control system is capable of running at a perfectly<br>
precise velocity, and some acceptable margin of error must be determined in<br>
which the test data can still be accurately representative of a test run at steady<br>
angular velocity. This margin of error is utilized in this particular embodiment<br>
by defining a selected angular velocity range in which the test is to be run.<br>
Once the velocity of crankshaft 25 enters the selected angular velocity range<br>
by equaling or exceeding the minimum test velocity, crankshaft position data<br>
is collected or flagged as test data. Once the test has begun, a test period of<br>
relevant crankshaft position data is defined. The gathering of test data<br>
continues until the test period ends by reaching a defined test duration or until<br>
the angular velocity data falls outside of the selected angular velocity range.<br>
The defined test duration may be set in terms of seconds elapsed, crankshaft<br><br>
revolutions, data samples taken, or any other durational measure. In the event<br>
that the test is ended as a result of data falling outside of the selected angular<br>
velocity range, the data that was collected prior to the end of the test may<br>
either be used or discarded. The gathered data corresponding to the controlled<br>
velocity unfueled engine is then processed to determine the crankshaft error<br>
factor.<br>
[0020] FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate crankshaft error factor tests run in<br>
accordance with two additional exemplary embodiments of the disclosure.<br>
FIG. 5 represents a test in which engine 20 utilizes fuel to speed crankshaft 25<br>
past the selected angular velocity range, and upon reaching a threshold fuel<br>
cutoff velocity, fuel is cut off from engine 20. During this acceleration period,<br>
the components of hybrid drive system 10 are subject to variable deformation<br>
as a result of the combustion process, as previously described. Upon the<br>
engine being cut off from all fuel, the crankshaft then decelerates toward the<br>
selected angular velocity range. At some point, electric motor 30 controllably<br>
rotates crankshaft 25 through transmission assembly 40, and crankshaft 25 is<br>
maintained within the selected angular velocity range. Although the<br>
combustion process is no longer applying forces to the components of hybrid<br>
drive system 10, the deformation associated with this process does not end<br>
immediately. For some transient period, the deformation continues to have<br>
appreciable effects upon hybrid drive system 10 after fuel cutoff. In this<br>
particular embodiment of the disclosure, the crankshaft error factors<br>
determined from data gathered in the test period are more accurate when a<br>
transitory period is defined starting at the fuel cutoff event and running for<br><br>
some set duration. All data measurements taken during the transitory period<br>
are disregarded, and the test period does not begin until the end of the<br>
transitory period. In this way, combustion may be used to accelerate<br>
crankshaft 25 without the associated forces causing inaccurate test results.<br>
[0021] Similar to the test represented in FIG. 5, FIG. 6 represents a test in<br>
which engine 20 utilizes fuel to speed crankshaft 25 to some threshold fuel<br>
cutoff velocity. This threshold fuel cutoff velocity may be below or within the<br>
selected angular velocity range. Upon reaching the threshold fuel cutoff<br>
velocity, fuel is cut off from engine 20, and power is applied by electric motor<br>
30 to turn crankshaft 25. As discussed previously, it is beneficial to define a<br>
transitory period after fuel cutoff in order to allow the dissipation of<br>
deformation caused by the fueled acceleration. As in previously discussed<br>
tests, a test period is defined in which crankshaft position data is measured and<br>
used to calculate crankshaft error factors relevant to more efficient operation<br>
of engine 20. While FIGS. 5 and 6 represent exemplary embodiments of tests<br>
in which engine 20 and electric motor 30 accelerate the crankshaft in separate<br>
phases, it should be noted that any combination of sources can be used to<br>
accelerate the crankshaft, so long as fuel is cutoff from the engine before the<br>
test period begins.<br>
[0022] When present, processor 55 may be programmed to perform<br>
various functions upon the data collected, including but not limited to storage<br>
of raw data, calculation of crank error values calculated as the difference<br>
between data gathered from sensor 60 and expected position points generated<br>
from design or lookup values, correlation of these crank error values and the<br><br>
selected angular velocity, correlation of crank error values for each cylinder of<br>
engine 20 for the selected angular velocity, filtering of the data, and<br>
authentication of the data<br>
[0023] The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and<br>
modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiments)<br>
