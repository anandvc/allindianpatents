				<td>CUTTING INSERT HAVING CERAMIC COATING<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to improved coating systems, and<br>
particularly but not exclusively to novel thick coatings and methods of fabrication<br>
thereof, for applying to appropriate substrates to provide cutting tools, inserts and<br>
replaceable cutting heads having enhanced properties such as longer working life,<br>
for example.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For machining metal work-pieces, by cutting, turning, milling, drilling and<br>
like, cutting tools are used. To ensure that chips are efficiently removed from the<br>
work-piece, whilst ensuring long working life of cutting tool, a cutting tool insert<br>
is required to be hard and tough.<br>
Hardness however may be correlated with brittleness. Being both hard<br>
and tough, composite materials consisting of hard ceramic particles in a metal<br>
matrix are very popular choices for inserts. A number of such ceramic metal<br>
composites or cermets have been developed. The so called hard metals or<br>
cemented carbides, in particular, WC-Co, consisting of tungsten carbide grains in<br>
a cobalt matrix, are the materials of choice for fabrication of cutting tool inserts<br>
for many applications.<br>
Inserts remove chips and shape the work-piece, but are, themselves, worn<br>
away in the process. The wear of cutting tool inserts takes place at their contact<br>
surfaces with the workpiece, and can generally be attributed to mechanical,<br>
chemical and thermal interaction with the workpiece.<br>
The downtime of machine tools whilst replacing insert is generally an<br>
expensive operation. Much research is directed to improving the wear resistance<br>
of inserts by application of hard coatings. Hardness is a measure of resistance to<br>
plastic deformation, and there is a correlation between hardness and wear<br>
resistance. While coatings increase wear resistance, they are often susceptible to<br>
catastrophic failure modes such as peeling and the like.<br>
Coatings may be formed on inserts by a range of coating technologies that<br>
are generally classified as PVD (physical vapor deposition) or CVD (chemical<br>
vapor deposition).<br>
PVD gives very good properties. Coating is only line-of-sight. PVD<br>
coatings are characterized by compressive residual stresses from the deposition<br>
process. Because of the risk of coating failure by peeling as the coating thickness<br>
increases, PVD is generally limited to thin coatings.<br>
CVD coatings are not to line-of-sight. Furthermore, deposition<br>
temperatures are typically rather higher than those of PVD technologies and this<br>
facilitates the development of a diffusion-induced interface between coating and<br>
substrate which allows good adhesion to be achieved. Indeed, good adhesion is<br>
one of the critical requirements for the coating of inserts.<br>
Furthermore, there are some materials and material-substrate combinations<br>
that are only practical by one or other coating technique.<br>
For more than 40 years, CVD (chemical vapor deposition) has been used<br>
for coating inserts, thereby improving their performance in machining. Coatings<br>
of TiN, TiC and TiC,N may be deposited onto appropriate substrates by reacting<br>
titanium tetrachloride with other gases, and removing the gaseous chlorides thus<br>
formed:<br>
TiCl4 + N2 + H2 ?TiN + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
T1Cl4 + CH4+H2 ? TiC + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
TiCl4 + N2 +CH4 + H2 ? TiCN + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
Al2O3 coatings may be produced in a similar manner:<br>
Al + HCl + H2 — AlCl3 + H2;<br>
A1C13 + H2 + CO2 +H2S ? Al2O3 + Chlorides and other gases,<br>
where H2S serves as a catalyst; enhancing the deposition rate and<br>
thickness uniformity of the Al2O3 coating.<br>
It will be appreciated that, over the years, other chemical vapor deposition<br>
routes have become available for deposition of TiN, TiC, TiCN and Al2O3 and<br>
the above routes using titanium chloride and aluminum chloride are given by way<br>
of non-limiting example, only.<br>
Indeed, a wide variety of hard coatings, such as various carbides, nitrides,<br>
oxides, borides and mixtures thereof may be deposited by one or other of the<br>
various PVD and / or CVD techniques. In the machining of hard materials, such<br>
as cast iron, for example, high temperatures are generated. At such high<br>
temperatures, many coating materials, such as carbides and nitrides are reactive,<br>
and may interact with the work-piece and / or with the cooling fluids and air.<br>
Al2O3 (alumina) is both highly chemical resistant and very hard. Consequently,<br>
alumina is a popular coating material for increasing the life of inserts.<br>
European Patent Number EP1245700 to Ruppi entitled "Enhanced Al2O3 -<br>
Ti(C,N) Multi-Coating Deposited at Low Temperature" relates to a coated body<br>
of cemented carbide, cermet, ceramic and / or high speed steel used as a metal<br>
cutting tool and having a multi-layer of k- Al2O3 and / or y- Al2O3 optionally<br>
interspersed with layers of titanium carbonitride Ti(C,N) which can also be<br>
applied by MTCVD.<br>
Other known multilayered coatings that comprise both Ti based layers and<br>
Al2O3 layers can be found in the following references:<br><br>
Alumina exists in a number of forms. y-alumina and K-alumina are<br>
metastable phases. In a number of machining scenarios, such as interrupted<br>
turning on a lathe, and when turning without a coolant, for example, inserts<br>
coated with a-alumina has been found to perform better than those coated with y-<br>
alumina or K-alumina.<br>
From the alumina phase diagram, at temperatures of above 1050°C under<br>
standard pressure, ?-alumina and K-alumina transpose into the stable a-alumina<br>
allotrope (corundum). Due to the poor heat dispersing properties of alumina and<br>
the high temperatures generated in machining, it is likely that the rake surface<br>
reaches 1050°C in some cutting processes, particularly with dry machining, and,<br>
at the very high pressures experienced on the rake face of inserts, the phase<br>
transformation is likely to occur at lower temperatures. The recrystallization of<br>
the alumina surface of an insert during machining processes may lead to<br>
accelerated wear.<br>
It is also possible that at the high temperature - pressure conditions<br>
experienced by inserts during cutting processes, where temperatures of 1000°C<br>
are not uncommon, and various mechanisms such as slip, twinning, grain<br>
boundary sliding and possibly diffusional creep come into play in a-Al2O3 and<br>
this allows sufficient ductility to prevent brittle failure. See "Nanoindentation<br>
Hardness, Microstructure and Wear Resistance of CVD a-Alumina and k-<br>
Alumina Coatings" by Ruppi, Laarsson and Flink.<br>
The growth process, the structure and properties of the deposited layer are<br>
governed by deposition conditions such as the nature and temperature of the<br>
substrate and the contents and kinetic energies of the gas flux. The rhombohedral<br>
a-alumina phase which is the stable allotrope and the hardest of the various<br>
polymorphs is generally achieved at deposition temperatures of I000-1100°C.<br>
See for example, Prengel et al. Surface Coatings Technology, 68-69,217 (1994),<br>
although deposition at 580°c has been achieved by plasma assisted CVD. See<br>
Krylov et al. for example, Appl. Phys. A 80 1657 (2004). By use of an<br>
appropriate template (i.e. favorable substrate), specifically Chromia, Andersson<br>
achieved a-alumina deposition at temperatures of as low as 280°C by reactive<br>
magnetron sputtering. See Ph.D. thesis, "Controlling the Formation and Stability<br>
of Alumina Phases" by Jon Martin Andersson, Linkoping Universitet, Institute of<br>
Technology, LinkSping 2005.<br>
Relatively thick coatings of a-alumina may be deposited using CVD<br>
techniques. However, such coatings generally display directed grain growth<br>
through the coating thickness, resulting in a columnar microstructure that is<br>
somewhat susceptible to crack propagation.<br>
A known technique for avoiding columnar growth in K-alumina is to<br>
periodically interrupt the deposition of the K-alumina by depositing a thin layer of<br>
a different material, after which deposition of K-alumina may be resumed. TiN is<br>
one such material that has been used to interrupt the growth of K-alumina. See<br>
"Microstructure and Deposition Characteristics of k-Al2O3" S. Ruppi &amp; A.<br>
Larsson Journal de Physique IV France 8 (1999), EuroCVD 12, Part 8 350-355.<br>
By periodically introducing a thin layer (0.1 um to 1 µm) of TiN, the K-alumina<br>
crystal growth can be arrested and a new layer of alumina can be nucleated. The<br>
resultant K-alumina is almost equiaxed and displays significantly better resistance<br>
to crack propagation than the columnar microstructure typical of CVD K-alumina.<br>
Unfortunately, the technique does not provide good results for cutting<br>
inserts and the like, since the K-alumina - TiN layers have relatively poor<br>
adhesion, resulting in coating peeling, which may actually result in accelerated<br>
wear.<br>
There is thus still a need for thick, high quality, a-alumina coatings that<br>
show high ductility and a low tendency to both crack propagation and peeling,<br>
and the present invention addresses this need.<br>

DETAlLED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are a number of CVD techniques available for depositing Al2O3<br>
(also known as aluminum oxide, corundum, and alumina).<br>
The vapor typically comprises volatile gases which react chemically on the<br>
substrate, depositing Al2O3; the other products of the reaction being gaseous<br>
phase chemicals that are transported away. Using conventional thermal CVD,<br>
Al2O3 requires temperature of over 1000°C for its deposition. Plasma CVD<br>
allows such coatings to be deposited at temperatures below 900°C. In this<br>
process, chemical compounds are decomposed and react together using plasma<br>
discharge and heating. As a result, very pure alumina films may be generated on<br>
the substrate surface. The conventionally used CVD process for Al2O3 involves<br>
the corrosive reactant AlCl3. Using a gas mixture of AlCl3/CO2/H2 at low<br>
pressure tends to result in columnar growth rather than an equiaxed coating. The<br>
gas mixture of AlCl3/CO2/H2 at atmospheric pressure may lead to the growth of<br>
large grains.<br>
Aluminum tri-isopropoxide is another precursor that may be used to<br>
deposit a-alumina. Another route includes the reactive sputtering of aluminum<br>
targets in argon-oxygen plasma.<br>
Aluminum acetylacetonate has also been used as the precursor for metal-<br>
organic chemical vapor deposition of alumina at atmospheric pressure, see<br>
"MOCVD of Aluminum Oxide Barrier Coating" by Jun C. Nable et al. J. Phys.<br>
IV France 12 (2002) Pr 4-139.<br>
Aluminum tris-tetramethyl-heptanedionate [Al(thd) 3] and aluminum tris-<br>
acetylacetonate [Al(acac) 3] have also been used for the CVD of Al2O3 films.<br>
See -"Diketonates as Precursors MOCVD of Aluminium Oxide Films Using<br>
Aluminium", by A. Devi, S.A. Shivashankar and A.G. Samuelson.<br>
Yet another route is the pyrolysis of aluminum acetylacetonate precursor<br>
which may be performed at relatively low temperatures of, say, 435-550 °C to<br>
deposit a thin film of alumina.<br>
At high temperatures, grain growth is favored over nucleation and the<br>
deposition of a-alumina by CVD processes tend to result in a relatively coarse<br>
columnar grain structure characterized by sharp boundaries between adjacent<br>
crystals and weak inter-crystalline bonding. Consequently, such a-alumina<br>
coatings tend to be susceptible to crack propagation through the coating<br>
thickness. Deposition temperature is not the only parameter to affect grain<br>
growth and nucleation rates, and other parameters such as the partial pressures of<br>
the reactants, substrate temperature, use of H2S or other catalyst may influence<br>
the resultant microstructure and their manipulation provides a means of<br>
controlling the features of the coatings thus formed.<br>
A particular feature of the preferred embodiments of the present invention<br>
as described hereinbelow is a well bonded, thick, multilayered a-alumina coating<br>
having a fine microstructure of equiaxed grains. This is achieved by alternately<br>
depositing alumina sub layers or strata and interfacial layers of a second material<br>
having good adhesion with the a-alumina sub layer such as, for example,<br>
TiAlCON, TiAlON, or TiAlOC, believed to be a solid solution of alumina in<br>
TiOCN, TiON, or TiOC respectively. The second layer is deposited by chemical<br>
vapor deposition from a mixture of TiCU, AlCl3. N2, CH,, H2, CO2 and H2S. In<br>
this manner, the a-alumina deposition is periodically interrupted by deposition of<br>
very thin layers of the second material that both interrupt the a-alumina grain<br>
growth of the previous stratum and provide sites for the nucleation of fresh a-<br>
alumina crystals in the new stratum and a multilayered a-alumina structure is<br>
built up. Thus, the interfacial layer of the second material is formed over an<br>
immediately preceding a-alumina oxide layer prior to development of a columnar<br>
structure in such immediately preceding a-alumina oxide layer. The<br>
development of thick, directed, columnar a-alumina growth is thereby prevented,<br>
which significantly reduces susceptibility of the ceramic coating to crack<br>
propagation.<br>
Unlike the system described in US20020176755Al and most other<br>
alumina wear resistant coatings, it will be noted that the coating system of the<br>
preferred embodiments relate to a-alumina and not to K-Al2O3 or 7-Al2O3. It will<br>
be appreciated that, in addition to being the stable allotrope, a-alumina is also the<br>
densest allotrope (density of about 4 g/cm3 as opposed to about 3.6 - 3.8 g cm/m3<br>
for other allotropes). It has been found that in the pressure-temperature regime<br>
encountered during machining operations, the a-alumina proves tougher than the<br>
other allotropes, and is able to deform plastically to relieve stress. Additionally,<br>
the interfacial layers of the second material have been found to help ensure good<br>
interfacial bonding with the alumina, providing high coating integrity. It is<br>
believed that the interfacial layer of the second material provides a high density<br>
of sites for the nucleation of new Al2O3 crystals, thereby resulting in a large<br>
number of small crystals. It is also believed that the presence of both Al and O in<br>
the second material intermediate layers provides chemical bonding to the Al and<br>
O in the Al2O3 and also provides nucleation sites encouraging a large density of<br>
alumina grains which encourages the growth of small grains<br>
With reference now to Fig. 1, a schematic cross-section of the coating<br>
layers of an insert 10 is shown. As seen in Fig. 1A, insert 10 consists of an<br>
uncoated body or substrate 12 and a multilayer coating 14. The body 12 may be<br>
fabricated from a high speed steel alloy containing, in addition to iron and carbon,<br>
varying amounts of refractory metals such as chromium, tungsten, molybdenum<br>
and titanium, for example. Alternatively, the body 12 may include a ceramic<br>
such as Si3N4, Al2O3, Al2O3/TiC, SiAlON, Al2O3/SiC whisker composite, and the<br>
like. More commonly, the body 12 is a cermet type composite such as TiC or<br>
TiN in a metallic binder. However, most commonly, the body 12 is a so-called<br>
hard metal cemented carbide type composite material such as tungsten carbide<br>
(WC) and additional carbides cemented by a metal matrix, often cobalt (Co)<br>
hereinafter referred to as tungsten cemented carbide. Cemented carbides are<br>
described on page 321 in Tungsten Properties, Chemistry, Technology of the<br>
Element, Alloys, and Chemical Compounds, published by Kluwer Academic /<br>
Plenum Publishers in 1999. The uncoated body 12 may be any of the<br>
aforementioned known compositions and will be referred to hereinafter as the<br>
substrate 12.<br>
Typically the substrate 12 will be prepared by degreasing, sandblasting<br>
and cleaning in an ultrasonic bath prior to deposition of the multilayer coating 14<br>
thereupon.<br>
The multilayer coating 14 comprises a relatively thick undercoat layer 16<br>
of a first hard material. Undercoat layer 16 is typically 4 um to 15 um thick and<br>
is particularly good at resisting flank and nose wear. A thin (0.1 um to 1.5 um)<br>
optional base layer 18, typically TiN, is generally deposited prior to the undercoat<br>
layer 16. The base layer 18 allows the insert 10 to be subjected to the relatively<br>
severe CVD conditions that may be required for deposition of the undercoat layer<br>
16 without decarburizing the substrate 12 thereof, thereby minimizing the<br>
formation of undesirable, brittle ? phases (M12C, M6C where M is Co and W)<br>
being formed near surface of the substrate 12.<br>
A thin bonding layer 20 (0.1 µm to 1 um) is deposited on the undercoat<br>
layer 16. The bonding layer 20 may be a sandwich structure consisting of an<br>
inner bonding layer of TiAlOCN 22 sandwiched between a bottom bonding layer<br>
and a top bonding layer of TiOCN, 24,26 respectively.<br>
TiCON may be deposited by a number of routes. For example:<br>
TiCl4 + N2 + H2 +CH4 + CO2 ? TiCON + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
TiAlCON may also be deposited by a number of routes. For example:<br>
TiCU + N2 + H2 +CR, + CO2 + AlCl3 ? TiAlCON + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
A thick ceramic coating 28 is deposited on the bonding layer 20. The<br>
ceramic coating 28 has a stratified structure of oxide layers 30 of a-Al203 with<br>
interfacial layers 32. Firstly, a first oxide layer 30A is deposited. It is believed<br>
that due to the top bonding layer 26 of TiOCN the oxide layer 30A is deposited<br>
with a high grain density and thus small grain size, and is well bonded to the<br>
bonding layer 20.<br>
The interfacial layer 32 is a second material that is a solid solution of<br>
oxygen and aluminum in a matrix of TiCN, TiC or TiN. It is hypothesized that<br>
excellent bonding of the oxide layer 30 with the interfacial layer 32 results from<br>
the interaction between the Al and O in the interfacial layer 32 and the oxide<br>
layer 30 by the interfacial layer 32 providing a more appropriate lattice spacing,<br>
and more compatible chemical bonding possibilities for nucleation of the oxide<br>
layer 30 thereupon.<br>
If allowed to grow unhindered, the oxide layer 30 grains are typically large<br>
and columnar. In some cases they may also have a preferred orientation.<br>
However, in the present embodiment, a very thin first interfacial layer 32A, of<br>
TiAlCON, for example, is deposited onto the first oxide layer 30A. First<br>
interfacial layer 32 A terminates the grain growth of the first oxide layer 30A, and,<br>
it is believed, provides fresh sites for nucleation and grain growth on which a<br>
second oxide layer 30B may be deposited. A second, very thin interfacial layer<br>
32B may then be deposited thereupon.<br>
By alternating oxide layers 30 with interfacial layers 32, a thick ceramic<br>
coating 28 having small equiaxed grain size may be grown by CVD. Each<br>
interfacial layer 32 arrests the grain growtfi of previous oxide layer 30 and<br>
possibly also provides a high density of sites for the nucleation of fresh ceramic<br>
crystals thereupon.<br>
It will be appreciated that an improvement in the hardness and wear<br>
resistance of most materials is found with a decrease in grain size due to the Hall-<br>
Petch effect. Additionally and more significantly, the continuous renucleation<br>
prevents the growth of thick, directed, columnar crystals, and thus significantly<br>
reduces the crack propagation susceptibility of the ceramic coating thus formed.<br>
The preferred number of oxide layers 30 and interfacial 32 layers within a<br>
ceramic coating 28 depends on design criteria for each specific application. It is<br>
believed that to a certain extent, the composition of the interfacial layer 32,<br>
particularly, the Al and O content within the solid solution interfacial layer 32,<br>
determines the grain size. It will be noted that although the composition of the<br>
interfacial layer 32 is affected by the partial pressures of the reactive species, it is<br>
not determined thereby in a simple manner, and the concentration of the various<br>
elements in the coating will invariably be different from their concentration in the<br>
reactive gases.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the substrate 12 is tungsten cemented carbide<br>
and the first hard material of the undercoat layer 16 is TiCN which is particularly<br>
good at reducing flank wear and crater wear. To avoid decarburization of the<br>
substrate 12 which would otherwise lead to the formation of brittle r| phases by<br>
the severe processing conditions required to deposit the TiCN undercoat layer 16,<br>
a base layer 18 is preferably provided thereunder. TiN has been found to be an<br>
appropriate option for the base layer 18 for this purpose and is well established in<br>
the art.<br>
The bonding layer 20 is deposited between the TiCN undercoat layer 16<br>
and the ceramic coating 28, which is built up of alternating layers of a-Al2O3<br>
oxide layers 30 and TiAlCON interfacial layers 32 laid down in turn (30A, 32A,<br>
30B,32B,30C,32C...).<br>
Use of TiAlCON for interfacial layers 32A, 32B, 32C... promotes<br>
nucleation of a-Al2O3 oxide layers 30B, 30C, 30D... thereupon. The alternating<br>
a-Al203 oxide layers 30A, 30B, 30C... and the TiAlCON interfacial layers 32A,<br>
32B... have been found to have excellent adhesion.<br>
The number of oxide 30 and interfacial 32 layers will vary depending on<br>
the thickness of ceramic coating 28 desired. In general, by varying the operating<br>
temperature and / or partial pressures of the process gases and the activity of the<br>
base layer 18 and specifically, the upper surface thereof, nucleation of oxide 30<br>
may be favored over grain growth and a smaller grain size will result. It is also<br>
believed that the a-Al2O3 oxide layers 30A, 30B, 30C are almost fully equiaxed,<br>
or at any rate far less directional that the columnar crystalline growth resulting<br>
from continuous CVD a-Al2O3 growth.<br>
Usefully, to provide an attractive finish, an outer layer 34 may be<br>
deposited onto the coating 14 described hereinabove. TiN may be used for this<br>
purpose, thereby providing an attractive gold finish, as known. Optionally the<br>
outer layer 34 of TiN may be removed at least one rake face of an insert.<br>
Example 1<br>
By way of proof of concept, with reference to Fig. 2, a SEM<br>
microphotograph of a cross section of an insert 100 comprising a substrate 112<br>
and a multilayer coating 114 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention is shown. At the bottom of the image, the substrate 112 of cemented<br>
tungsten carbide is shown. The angular crystals of tungsten carbide have a mean<br>
grain size of about 1 urn. The multilayer coating 114 comprises a thin base<br>
coating of TiN 118 of about 1 urn. On top of the TiN base coating 118, a<br>
relatively thick of about 7 um undercoat of columnar TiCN undercoat layer 116<br>
was deposited. A bonding layer 120 is deposited thereupon. Bonding layer<br>
system 120 is actually a sandwich structure of TiOCN, TiAlOCN and TiOCN,<br>
but because of the interdiffusion, there is poor contrast and the different sublayers<br>
are not resolved in the SEM microphotograph.<br>
A stratified thick ceramic coating 128 of alternating sub layers of a-Al2O3<br>
oxide layers 130A, 130B, and 130C of thickness approx. 1 um alternating with<br>
TiAlOCN interfacial layers 132A, 132B, 132C of thickness approx. 0.1 um is<br>
shown. Thus, a ratio of the thickness of the oxide to the interfacial layer is on the<br>
order of 10. This ratio can take on other values, but preferably is between 7 and<br>
15. An outer layer of TiN 134 of thickness approx. 0.5 µm can also be seen.<br>
The temperature, pressure and flow rates of the gases used for the<br>
chemical vapor deposition are shown in Table 1. These details provide a full<br>
enabling description for producing a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
The coating shown in Fig. 2 was examined by X-Ray diffraction (XRD)<br>
using X-Rays from a Cu-Ka source. In Fig. 3, the X-Ray Diffraction spectrum is<br>
shown. As is well known in the art, the vertical axis is the number of counts per<br>
second of photons received by an X-ray detector and the horizontal axis (2?) is<br>
the diffraction angle (at which the detector is set), where 6 is the angle of<br>
incidence of the X-rays. All the main peaks are labeled as follows: 1 is a-Al2O3,<br>
2 is TiN; 3 is TiCN (MT); and 4 is WC. As is clearly shown, the oxide layers are<br>
indeed a-Al2O3 and not other allotropes. Furthermore, from the sharpness of the<br>
peaks and the relatively low background noise, it can be seen the coating has only<br>
crystalline structure with crystal size more than 100 nm.<br>
Examples 2-4 exemplify the advantages of the Grade A inserts (i.e.,<br>
inserts that were coated according to the disclosure) which were tested with<br>
identical conditions together with Grade B inserts (i.e., inserts coated with a<br>
known prior art coating). Details of the Grade B prior art insert coating from the<br>
innermost layer to the outer layer is as follows: an innermost TiN layer of<br>
thickness approx. 0.6 µm followed by a second thick layer TiCN MT of thickness<br>
approx. 6 um with columnar grains using MTCVD technique. The third layer is<br>
TiN of thickness approx. 0.15 µm and the fourth layer is TiC of thickness approx.<br>
0.3 µm. The fifth layer is TiOCN of thickness approx. 0.1 µm and a sixth layer of<br>
cc-Al2O3 of thickness approx. 3 µm thick layer. The top outer layer is TiN of<br>
thickness approx. 0.8 µm thick.<br>
These examples are summarized in table form.<br>
