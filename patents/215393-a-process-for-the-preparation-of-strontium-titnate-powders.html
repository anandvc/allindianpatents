				<td>This  invention relates to a process for  the preparation of Strontium titanate (SrTiO3 ).<br>
Strontium titanate of the electroceramic grade is prepared by solution derived procedures in the  known<br>
art.  There are disadvantages associated with the  prior art.   One  of  the  main  disadvantages  is  that   the<br>
strontium titanate obtained by the conventional  process is not pure.<br>
Therefore  the  main object  of  the  present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of SrTiO3 at low temperatures.<br>
Yet  another object of the present  invention<br>
is  to propose a process for the  preparation of SrTiO3<br>
wherein  there  is  phase  purity  of  the  end  product<br>
obtained  by  the avoiding  premature  precipitation  of<br>
constituent cations.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for the preparation of SrTiO3  wherein good control of the particle size of the  ceramic powder is achieved.<br><br>
According   to   this   invention   there   is   provided   a   process   for   the preparation of the strontium titanate (SrTiO3) comprising:<br>
a)	preparing strontium salt solutions such as described herein.<br>
b)	preparing a titanium salt solution such as described herein.<br>
c)	mixing the strontium salt solution and titanium salt solution in the<br>
ratio of 1:2.5 to 3 respectively.<br>
d)	adding 1ON sodium hydroxide solution to the solution formed in<br>
step c in the ratio of 1: 2 to 3 at a temperature of 85° to 90°C<br>
under continuous stirring to get a stable solution having pH in the<br>
range of 8-13 so as to get the precipitate of strontium titanate.<br>
e)	filtering the said precipitate and subjecting the same to the steps of<br>
washing, the precipitate is first washed with 0.1 N hydrochloric<br>
acid and then with the distilled water till precipitate is alkali free,<br>
and drying at a temperature preferably 110°C for three hours to<br>
obtain said chemically pure strontium titanate.<br>
In accordance with this invention the process for preparing strontium titanate (SrTio3) comprises in preparing a strontium precursor/salt solution and titanium precursor/salt solution separately. The strontium precursor/salt solution and titanium precursor/salt solution so obtained are mixed in the ratio of 1:2.5-3 respectively.<br><br>
The stabilizing agents, modifiers (for example 1ON sodium hydroxide solution) then added to said mixed solution in a controlled manner to obtain a stable solution. The pH of the stable solution is adjusted to 8 to 13 using alkali and alkaline earth metal basic salt at a temperature of 85° to 90°C and under continuous stirring so as to obtain the direct precipitation of strontium titanate (SrTio3). The precipitated SrTio3 is filtered from the solution and subsequently subject to the steps of washing with dilute Hydrochloric acid and then with distilled water until the precipitate is alkali free.<br>
A process for the preparation of strontium titanate according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying example.<br>
According to the process of the invention, strontium salt solution first prepared by dissolving commercial grade strontium chloride into distilled water in the ratio of one part strontium chloride and 4 to 5 part distilled water, filter it and store.<br><br>
Similarly titanium salt solution is prepared by adding titanium tetrachloride into distilled water under constant stirring in the ratio of one part titanium tetrachloride and 2 to 3 part distilled water and the bottle is kept in a cold bath of ice-common salt mixture. After complete addition, stirring is continued for half an hour and then volume is made up to 20 litres with distilled water. The weight of the titanium content in the solution is preferably 0.14g/ml. The next step of the process is that titanium tetra chloride solution is mixed the strontium chloride solution at room temperature in the ratio of 1:2.5 to 3 respectively. This mixed solution of titanium and strontium constituents is then added slowly to the stabilizing agent, modifiers for example 1ON Sodium Hydroxide solution in the ratio of 2 to 3:1 respectively under continuous stirring at a temperature of 85° to 90°C. The pH of the solution was adjusting using alkali and alkaline earth metal basic salt. The Sodium Hydroxide solution is prepared by dissolving 200g Sodium Hydroxide in 500ml of distilled water.<br><br>
the step of addition of mixed solution to the sodium hydroxide solution, white precipitate of strontium<br>
titanate is formed. After the addition is complete stirring and heating is continued for another two hours<br>
and then the precipitated solution is allowed to be cooled. The precipitate then filtered and washed first<br>
with hydrochloric acid (0.1N) and then with distilled water until the washings are alkali free. Washed<br>
precipitate is then dried at 110°C for three hours and is ground to fine powder of strontium titanate.<br>
90 grams of strontium chloride was dissolved in 750 ml distilled water to prepare strontium salt<br>
solution which was subsequently filtered and stored. 200 ml titanium tetra chloride was slowly added to 500<br>
ml distilled water in bottle and which was kept in a cold bath ice-common salt mixture. After the complete<br>
addition,  stirring was continued for half an  hour  and<br><br>
then   the volume was made upto 2 litres with distilled<br>
water.  The weight of titanium content was 0.14 g/ml  in the titanium salt solution.<br>
200 ml titanium salt solution was mixed  with<br>
750 ml strontium chloride solution at room  temperature. The  mixture   so obtained was added  slowly   to  500ml<br>
of 10N sodium hydroxide solution  under continuous spray<br>
at  a   temperature  of  9dP C  so  as  to  get  a  white precipitate  of strontium titanate.  After the  addition<br>
is  complete  stirring  and heating  was  continued  for another two hours and then the precipitate solution  was<br>
allowed  to be cooled.  After cooling, the  precipitate was filtered, washed three times with 100 ml portions of<br>
dilute  hydrochloric acid (0.1N) and then four  or  five times  with 100ml portions of distilled water until  the<br>
washing   are   alkali  free.    The   precipitate   was subsequently ground to get the fine powders of strontium<br>
titanate.  The strontium titanate powder so obtained was subjected  to  chemical analysis are given   here  under<br>
table  one.<br>
