				<td>Description<br>
Contact arrangement for a vacuum interrupter<br>
The invention concerns the field of electrical<br>
components and is to be used for the structural design<br>
of vacuum interruDters. the contact arrangement of<br>
which comprises two coaxially arranged contacts with<br>
mutually facing contact surfaces, each contact being<br>
formed as a flat, multi-armed spiral contact and at<br>
least one contact arm being axially movable. Contacts<br>
of this type generally have four arms, but may also be<br>
formed in a six-armed configuration (DE 196 24 920 A1).<br>
Contact arrangements of the said type for vacuum<br>
interrupters are known as so-called "vane electrodes"<br>
or "spiral contact" and often have an inner contact<br>
region, which is provided for switching operating<br>
currents. and an outer contact region, which<br>
concentrically surrounds the inner contact region, is<br>
provided for interrupting short-circuit currents and<br>
serves as a running surface for a rotating arc. In<br>
this case, the inner contact region projects over the<br>
outer contact region by. a certain, not very large<br>
amount (US 3,158,719 A, US 3,809,836 A). In the case<br>
of other known embodiments of spiral contacts, the<br>
inner region of the contact surface is formed as a<br>
depression, so that the contact region provided for<br>
switching operating currents is identical to the<br>
contact region provided for interrupting short-circuit<br>
currents (EP 0 532 513 B1, DE 198 02 893 Al, DE 199 10<br>
148 Al).<br>
In order to be able to separate welded contact regions<br>
more easily from one another in the case of vacuum<br>
interrupters, it is known to give each contact<br>
a relatively large number of contact surfaces and to<br>
hold these elastically on a main contact body. A<br>
tubular main contact body with radially inwardly<br>
projecting support arms for the contact surfaces can be<br>
provided for this purpose (US 3,869,589 A).<br>
For air-breakina circuit breakers in the low-voltage<br>
range it is furtner known per se to divide the movable<br>
contact up into a plurality of contact fingers arranged<br>
parallel to one another, in order to reduce contact<br>
pressure force (US 5,210,385 A).<br>
In the case of vacuum interrupters for circuit<br>
breakers, in particular for circuit breakers in the<br>
low-voltage range (DE 199 10 148 A1), the hioh currents<br>
give rise to high forces on the contacts which tend to<br>
lift the contacts off one another. These current<br>
forces must be compensated by suitable measures to<br>
avoid lifting off of the contacts with the risk of them<br>
becoming welded to one anotner. In the case of<br>
switches fitted with vacuum interrupters, this problem<br>
has been solved so far by using in addition to a<br>
permanently applied static contact pressure force an<br>
additional current 100p with the aid of which high<br>
dynamic magnetic field forces which act to strengthen<br>
the contact force are produced for a short time, i.e.<br>
particularly during the occurrence of short-circuit<br>
currents. This obviates the need for the entire<br>
contact pressure force, which is required only for a<br>
short time, to be applied mechanically. However,<br>
because of the relatively high costs of such current<br>
loops, the contact force to be permanently applied<br>
mechanically continues to be relatively large and can<br>
be several kN per switching pole, particularly in the<br>
case of high currents of more than 50 kA. This<br>
requires a switching device of a correspondingly high<br>
mechanical complexity.<br>
is the object of the invention to form the contact<br>
arrangement in such a way that the mechanical contact<br>
point between the two contacts is distributed over a<br>
plurality of separate individual contacts with a<br>
defined spring constant and that the rotation of an arc<br>
is nevertheless possible.<br>
To achieve this object, it is provided according to the<br>
invention that each contact comprises as an at least<br>
two-layered contact body with a lower layer of a highly<br>
elastic material and an upper layer of a highly<br>
electroconductive material, the two layers being<br>
adhesively/cohesively bonded to each other, and that a<br>
support of a contact material is arranged in the outer<br>
region of each contact arm.<br>
In the case of such a configuration of the contact<br>
arrangement, the mechanical stability and electrical<br>
conductivity functions are separated from each other by<br>
a layer structure of the individual contacts, spring<br>
properties being additionally integrated into the layer<br>
ensuring the mechanical stability and damped only<br>
insignificantly by the electrically conducting layer.<br>
The supports of a contact material in this case produce<br>
raised contact points, which lead to a resilient<br>
flexural load on the arms of the spiral contacts. - In<br>
the case of such a configuration of the individual<br>
spiral contacts, the layer consisting of a highly<br>
electroconductive, comparatively costly material can be<br>
kept as thin as the electrical requirements allow. By<br>
backing this layer with a resilient layer,<br>
premature fatigue rupture of the electrically<br>
conducting layer consisting - generally - of a brittle<br>
contact material is avoided. Materials from the group<br>
of high-grade steels are preferably suitable for these<br>
purposes, while high-purity cooper should be used for<br>
the electrically conducting layer. A thickness of<br>
approximately 3 to 5 mm is expediently chosen for the<br>
lower and upper layer, respectively, and a thickness of<br>
approximately 2 mm is expediently chosen for the<br>
support. The support expediently consists of a<br>
material which contains copper and chromium, preferably<br>
of a tried-and-tested sintered copper-chromium<br>
material. If appropriate, this material may also be<br>
used for the electrically conducting layer. In this<br>
case, a copper layer may be arranged between the two<br>
layers to ensure the required electrical properties.<br>
In order to distribute the mechanical contact point<br>
between the two spiral contacts over as many separate<br>
individual contacts as possible, it is recommendable to<br>
form the contacts as 5-armed, preferably 6-armed spiral<br>
contacts.<br>
Two exemplary embodiments of the novel contact<br>
arrangement are represented in figures 1 to 3. Of<br>
these, figure 1 shows a first contact arrangement with<br>
four-armed spiral contacts in cross section,<br>
figure 2 shows a plan view of a contact of the<br>
arrangement according to figure 1 and<br>
figure 3 shows a plan view of a contact of a second<br>
contact arrangement with six-armed spiral contacts.<br>
The two contacts 1 and 2 of the contact arrangement<br>
according to figure 1 are formed according to figure 2<br>
as four-armed (10) spiral contacts<br>
and comprise a contact carrier 3 and the actual contact<br>
body 4.<br>
In this case, each disk-shaped contact body 4 has a<br>
lower layer 6 and an upper layer 7; the layers 6 and 7<br>
are adhesively/cohesively bonded to each other, in<br>
particular soldered. Contact supports 9 are arranged<br>
on the upper layer 7. The contact body 4 is seated on<br>
a contact carrier 3, which is provided with a step 8<br>
and is directly connected to the upper layer 7 through<br>
a bore in the lower layer 6. In this case, the contact<br>
carrier 5 consists of high-purity copper, the lower<br>
layer 6 consists of a high-grade steel, the upper layer<br>
7 consists of high-purity copper and the contact<br>
supports 9 consist of a sintered copper-chromium<br>
material.<br>
According to Figure 2, the contact arms 10 of the two<br>
spiral contacts 1 and 2 are formed by special slots 11,<br>
similar to the arrangement known from EP 0 532 513 B1.<br>
The slots are cut out from the disk-shaped contact body<br>
4, which has a central depression 5, in order that the<br>
initiation of the arc in the region of the arms is<br>
ensured during switching, A contact support 9 is<br>
respectively arranged at the ends of the contact arms<br>
10, that is in the outer region of the contact arms.<br>
Figure 3 shows a contact body 12, which is formed in a<br>
six-armed configuration, a contact support 14 being<br>
respectively arranged at the ends of the spirally<br>
running contact arms 13.<br>
