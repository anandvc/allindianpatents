				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is for the purpose of forming a film-like   or  sheet-like  resin-made  membrane   (a  thin-film), and relates  to  a resin-made  membrane  formation  casting apparatus  suitably used,  for example,  as  a biaxial oriented film machine,  a non-oriented film machine, a sheet machine,   and   others.<br>
2)	Description of the Related Art<br>
Figs.  II  and  12 are respectively a side elevational view  and  a front elevational  view each illustratively showing  a  prior resin-made   membrane  formation  casting apparatus.    Although Fig.   12 shows only one end portion side of the prior apparatus in its width direction, the other end portion side is constructed in a similar way.<br>
As shown in Figs.  11  and 12, the prior apparatus is equipped with a T die  101  for extruding a molten resin from an extruding machine (not shown) into a film-like or sheet-like membrane   102,  a casting roll (cooling roll)   103 for receiving the membrane   102 extruded from the T die<br><br>
101  on its outer circumferential surface to cool  and deliver the membrane   102,  and a suction chamber (vacuum box)<br>
104	for stably making  the membrane   102 come closely<br>
into contact with the surface of the casting roll  103.<br>
In this constitution, the casting roll 103 is supported by a roll supporting shaft 106 to be rotatable with respect to a side frame 107.<br>
The suction chamber  104 is fixedly secured on one side surface of the T die 101.    Further, a vacuum pump<br>
105	is in a coupled relation to the suction chamber 104 so<br>
that, when this vacuum pump  105 is placed into operation,<br>
the air between the membrane  102 and the casting roll<br>
103  is sucked through an opening section  104a of the<br>
suction  chamber   104.<br>
The opening section  104a is made throughout the overall width of the membrane  102 in the proximity of a portion  where  the membrane   102  starts  to  come  closely into  contact with the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll  103.    Further, a seal gap 104b is defined between the  suction chamber  104 and the casting roll  103. The dimension of the seal gap 104b is set to ensure a required  suction  force  (pressure reduction  level)  at the close  contact section between the  membrane   102  and  the casting roil  103  concurrently with allowing the rotation of the casting roll  103.    In Figs.  11  and 12, reference numeral<br><br>
108  represents  wheels to be  used when shifting  this apparatus.<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  constitution,   the  resin molten  by  the  non-shown  extruding  machine  passes through the T die  101 to be extruded into a film-like or sheet-like membrane  102 which in turn, is placed on the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll  103 to be cooled for formation.<br>
At this time, the air within the suction chamber  104 is sucked by the vacuum pump  105 so that the air in the close contact  section between the  membrane   102  and the casting roll  103 is sucked through the opening section 104a of the suction chamber  104.    Whereupon, that close contact section  is  pressure-reduced to  discharge  the  air taken in between the membrane  102 and the casting roll 103,  with  the result that the  membrane  102 made of the molten resin can stably be brought into contact with the casting roll  103.<br>
In this case, depending upon the kind of resin, on the condition that an interval between the T die  101  and the casting roll  103 is small, the orientation of the molten resin due to its extension is not relieved, but the resin is cooled and solidified on the casting roll 103, and hence, a necessary   film   characteristic   (membrane  characteristic)   is unobtainable.     In  addition,  under the condition  that the<br><br>
interval between the T die  101  and the casting roll  103 is small,  the microscopic  surface irregularities  occurring at the exit of the T die 101  is unreducible in the extension interval,  and after being cooled and solidified,  they remain as  the  surface  roughness,   thereby  deteriorating  the  film quality   (membrane   quality).<br>
Accordingly,  a way of adjusting  the interval between the T die  101  and the casting roll  103 in accordance with kinds of resins can be taken in order to attain the necessary   film   characteristic   (membrane   characteristic).<br>
In the apparatus shown in Figs.  11  and  12, although the interval between the T die  101  and the casting roll  103 is not necessarily easy to vary because the suction chamber 104 is in a fixed relation to the T die 101, the adjustment of the interval between the T die 101   and the casting roll  103  is  accomplished through the adjustment of the fitting condition of the suction chamber 104 to the T die   101   or through the  adjustment in relative position between the casting roll  103 and the T die  101  based upon the movement of the casting roll  103 by the wheels  108.<br>
However,  in  such  a  prior resin-made  membrane formation  casting  apparatus,  since  the  suction  of ambient air takes place when the vacuum pump   105  sucks air from the close  contact section  between the membrane   102  and the casting roll  103, depending upon the air suction gas<br><br>
quantity,  the  surface  temperature of the inner wall of the suction chamber  104 varies due to the heat transfer between the inner wall surface of the  suction chamber  104 and  the  suction air flows  at the  atmospheric  temperature level.<br>
Particularly, in the case of a large suction gap quantity   (high   negative   pressure),   the   thermal conductivity rises between the  inner wall surface of the suction chamber  104 and the suction air flows at the atmospheric  temperature  level,   so   that  the  surface temperature of the inner wall  surface of the suction chamber   104  may decrease to  the  atmospheric  level.<br>
In   general,  in  a  resin-made  membrane  formation casting apparatus for forming    a plastic film or a sheet-like resin-made membrane made of a material such as  a polyethylene,   polypropylene,   polyethylene   terephthalate and nylon, in the vicinity of an extruding machine for extrusion of a molten resin,  particularly,  at the periphery of the T die 101, volatile gases such as a residual monomer,  oligomer and additive come  into existence,  and the volatile gases  are  sucked and removed from the suction chamber  104 together with air caught up into between  the casting roll   103   and  the membrane   102.<br>
At this time, in a state where the surface temperature of the inner wall  surface of the suction<br><br>
chamber  104 does  down due  to the heat transfer between the suction air flows and the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 104, the volatile gas such as an additive attaches as a volatile matter to the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 104 in a condensed condition.    This condensed  and   attaching  volatile  matter is   accumulated with the passage of time, and drops onto the casting roll 103  to make the casting roll  103  and the membrane  102 dirty, which deteriorates  the film quality.    In addition, if the  attaching  and  accumulating  matter resulting  from  the drop onto the casting roll 103 gets mixed in the film (membrane  102), this can cause the film to be broken.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been developed  with a view  to  eliminating  the  above-mentioned problems,  and  it is therefore an object of this invention to provide a resin-made  membrane  formation  casting  apparatus   which  is capable of preventing the drop of the temperature of an inner wall surface of a suction chamber for the absence of attachment of volatile matters onto the inner wall of the suction chamber leading to the contamination of a membrane by the falling of the volatile matters onto a cooling roll.<br><br>
For this purpose, in accordance with this invention, a casting  apparatus for formation  of a resin-made membrane is composed of a die for extruding a molten resin into a membrane, a cooling roll for receiving the membrane  extruded from the  die  on its  outer circumferential  surface  to  deliver  the  membrane  while cooling, a suction chamber for sucking air from between the membrane and the cooling roll to make the membrane come closely into contact with the cooling roll, and a temperature  adjusting  unit  for  allowing  a  temperature  of an inner wall surface of the suction chamber to be set to a desired   value.<br>
In   this  resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus,   the   temperature   adjusting  unit  can  include heating  means  for heating  a  structural  member constituting  the  suction  chamber,  detection  means  for detecting the temperature  of the inner wall  surface of the suction chamber, and control means for controlling the heating means on the basis of the detection result by the detection   means.<br>
On  the  other hand,  in  this resin-made membrane formation  casting  apparatus,  it is  also  appropriate that the temperature  adjusting unit is  made up  of heating means for heating  a  structural  member constituting  the  suction chamber, cooling means for cooling the structural member.<br><br>
detection  means  for detecting  the  temperature  of the  inner wall surface of the suction chamber, and control means for controlling the heating means and the cooling means on the basis  of the detection result by the detection means.<br>
Furthermore,   in   this   resin-made   membrane formation casting apparatus,  it is  also acceptable that the heating means is embedded in the interior of the structural  member,  it is  provided  inside the  structural member to constitute the inner wall surface of the suction chamber, it is placed along an outer wall surface of the structural  member,  or it is  mounted on  another  structural member placed closely  into contact with the aforesaid structural   member.<br>
Still further,  in any one of the resin-made membrane formation casting  apparatus mentioned above,  it is  also possible that the heating means comprises  a heating  wire type heater, or it is composed of a fluid passage situated along  the  structural  member  organizing  the  suction chamber   and   a   temperature-controlled   heating   medium movable  within the fluid passage.<br>
Besides,   in   the  resin-made   membrane  formation casting  apparatus mentioned  above,  the cooling  means  can also be composed of a fluid passage situated along the structural  member  organizing  the  suction  chamber  and  a<br><br>
temperature-controlled   cooling   medium   movable   within the  fluid passage.<br>
In addition, it is also appropriate that the desired temperature  which  can  be  set by  the  temperature adjusting  unit  in   the  resin-made  membrane  formation casting apparatus is  set to be above an attachment suppressing  temperature   whereby   the   attachment   of  a volatile matter to the inner wall surface of the suction chamber   is   suppressible.<br>
Accordingly,   with   the  resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to  this  invention, through  the  use  of the temperature  adjusting  unit which can  set the inner wall  surface temperature of the suction chamber to a desired value,  the inner wall surface temperature  of the  suction chamber is  maintainable  to a desired value  (for example,  above  a volatile matter attachment   suppressing   temperature),   which   prevents   the volatile  matters such as additives volatilizing from  the membrane  from  being  condensed  and  attaching  onto  the inner wall surface of the suction chamber,  and hence, which  prevents   the   condensed   attachment   and accumulation on the inner wall surface of the suction chamber from falling onto the cooling roll to accomplish no contamination  of the membrane,  with  the result that the formation of a membrane with a high.quality is feasible.<br><br>
Furthermore,   the   temperature   adjusting   unit   can comprise a healing means  for heating  a  structural member constituting the  suction chamber,  a cooling means for cooling the structural member, and a control means for conducting control on the basis of the detection of the inner wall surface  temperature of the suction chamber.     In this case, since the inner wall surface of the suction chamber can be cooled by the cooling means, it is possible to shorten the time required for the adjustment of the inner wall  surface  temperature  of the  suction  chamber, with effective construction.    In addition, the formation of a high-quality   membrane   is   feasible.<br>
Still further, if the heating means is provided inside the  structural  member to  constitute  the  inner  wall  surface of the suction chamber, the direct control of the inner wall surface of the suction chamber becomes possible to allow the  control  of the  inner wall  surface  temperature thereof with a high accuracy and to permit certain suppression of the condensation and attachment of volatile maters,  so  that a  high-quality   membrane  is  producible.<br>
Moreover, if the heating means is placed along the outer wall surface of the  structural member,  its structure becomes   simple,   which  permits  manufacturing   the apparatus at a low cost, so being economical.<br><br>
Besides, if the heating means is mounted on a different structural member different from the aforesaid structural member and placed closely into contact therewith, it can be set with a single structure, so being economical.<br>
Furthermore, if comprising a heating wire type heater, the heating means can be constructed simply, so that the apparatus is producible at a low cost and is economical.<br>
Still further, if the heating means is made up of a fluid passage disposed along the structural member constituting the suction chamber and a temperature- controlled heating medium movable within the fluid passage, by changing the temperature of the temperature-controlled heating medium, the inner wall surface temperature of tiie suction chamber is adjustable to a desired value.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made membrane characterized in that: a die for extruding a molten resin mto a membrane; a cooling roll for receiving said membrane extruded from said die on its outer circumferential surface to deliver said membrane while cooling; a suction chamber for sucking air from between said membrane and said cooling roll to make said membrane come closely into contact with said cooling roll; and a temperature adjusting unit for allowing a temperature of an iimer wall surface of said suction chamber to be set to a desired value, wherein said temperature adjusting unit, has heating means for heating said suction chamber.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, a description will be made hereinbelow  of embodiments  of the present invention. (A)    Description of a First Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Figs. 1 to 4 show a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made  membrane  according  to  a  first embodiment of the present invention.    Of these drawings, Fig. 1 is a side-elevational  and  cross-sectional  view   showing  its suction chamber,  and  additionally  showing  a control system. Fig. 2 is an illustrative side elevations! view thereof, Fig. 3 is a partially broken perspective view showing the suction chamber, and Fig. 4 is a side-elevational   and cross-sectional  view  showing  a  structure and fitting condition of an elastic seal member thereof.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the resin-made membrane formation casting  apparatus  according  to the first embodiment of this invention is also composed of a T die (die)  1  for extruding a molten resin from a extruding machine (not shown) into a film-like or sheet-like membrane 2, a casting roll (cooling roll) 3 for receiving the membrane 2 extruded from the T die 1  on its outer circumferential surface to deliver it while cooling, and a suction chamber 40 for sucking  air from between the membrane 2  and the casting roll  3  to make the membrane<br><br>
2 stably brought closely into contact with the surface of the casting roll 3. Further, the casting roll 3 is supported by a roll supporting shaft 16 to be rotatable with respect to side frames 17, and wheels 18 are mounted under the side frames 17, with the wheels 18 being used when this apparatus is  shifted in horizontal directions.<br>
In this embodiment,  the suction chamber 40 is provided independently of the T die  1.    Further, the suction chamber 40 is formed along the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3, and a necessary  seal  gap is  defined between the  suction  chamber 40 and the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3.    The dimension (interval) of this seal gap is set to ensure a necessary suction force (pressure reduction level) at a close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 while allowing the rotation of the casting roll 3.<br>
Besides, as well as the prior art, a vacuum pump 5 is communicated through  a suction duct 60 with the  suction chamber 40, and on the operation of this vacuum pump 5, the air between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is sucked through a suction inlet (opening section) 40a of the suction chamber 40 (see Fig.  1).    Further, the suction inlet 40a is made throughout the overall width of the membrane 2  in the proximity of the portion where the<br><br>
membrane 2 starts to come closely into contact with the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3.<br>
In  addition,  in this embodiment,  a driving member no is used as a circumferentially moving mechanism designed to move  the suction chamber 40 along a circumferential direction of the casting roll 3 while maintaining the necessary seal gap.    This driving member 110 is made such that its proximal side is supported coaxially with a roll supporting shaft (rotary shaft)  16 of the casting roll 3 to be rotatable around the roll supporting shaft 16 (in directions of arrows A in Fig. 2) while its tip side is in a fixed relation to the suction chamber 40.<br>
Furthermore,  in  the  driving member   110,  elongated holes  IlOa are made along the radial directions of the casting roll 3, and in a manner of adjusting the tightening positions  of supporting  bolts   11  penetrating  these elongated holes   UOa,  the suction chamber 40 is movable in the radial directions of the casting roll 3 with respect to the driving member  UO, that is, the suction chamber 40 is fitted so that the necessary seal gap between the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3  and the suction chamber 40 is adjustable.     The aforesaid elongated holes 110a and supporting bolts  11   constitute  a radially moving mechanism.<br><br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the suction chamber 40 is composed of a housing (a structural member constituting the suction chamber 40) 41, comprising upper walls 41a, 41b, a rear wall 41c and left- and right-hand side walls 4Id, and labyrinth packings 42, 43 fixedly secured to a rear wall 41c and to outer-surface lower portions of the left- and right-hand side walls 4Id, respectively.    The labyrinth packing 43 is fixed to the left- and right-hand side walls 41d.<br>
Furthermore, a front side (left side in Fig. 1) of the suction chamber 40 is open, and a suction inlet (opening section) 40a is made between the upper wall 41a of the suction  chamber  40  and  an  outer circumferential  surface of the casting roll 3.    In addition, the housing 41 is closed by the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3 from the below except the suction inlet 40a, and a suction room 40b is defined between the housing 41   and the casting roll 3.<br>
The labyrinth packings 42, 43  stand against the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3 in a state where they are in a slightly spaced relation to each other to possibly suppress the inflow of the air from below the rear wall 41c and the left- and right-hand walls 41d. Incidentally, in place of the labyrinth packings 42, 43, it is also possible to use rubber seals, felt seals or the like.<br><br>
The suction room 40b is coupled through a suction duct 60, fixedly secured to the upper wall 41b,  to the vacuum pump 5 (see Figs. 1 and 2).<br>
In  addition,  in the resin-made  membrane  formation casting apparatus  according  to  the  first embodiment, heating   wire  type  heaters  (sheathed  heaters)   502  are embedded at a nearly equal interval in the interior of the housing 41   comprising the upper walls 41a, 41b,  the rear wall 41c and the left- and right-hand walls 41d, which constitutes the suction chamber 40, and in the housing 41, temperature  sensors  501   acting  as  detection  means  for sensing  the  inner wall surface temperature  of the  suction chamber 40 are put at a plurality of portions (in this embodiment,  5  portions)  corresponding  to  unit  areas (which  will  be  referred hereinafter  to   as  temperature-controlled  zones)  which  are  made  to  undergo  temperature adjustment.<br>
Moreover,   in  this  embodiment,  a  temperature controller 70 is provided  to control  the heating wire type heaters  502 in accordance with the detection results of the temperature  sensors  501.     That is,  the  temperature controller  70  receives  information  representative  of the temperatures   measured   by   the   respective   temperature sensors 501   as  indicated  by  arrows with  circled numerals 1  lo 5 in Fig.  1, and compares these temperature<br><br>
information  with  a  given  preset value  to  feedback-control the heating  conditions  by  the healing wire type heaters 502.<br>
More  specifically, in the first embodiment,  the foregoing   temperature   sensors  501,  heating  wire  type heaters   502  and  temperature  controller 70  organize  a temperature   adjusting   unit   where  each   of  the   temperature sensors  501   detects  the inner wall  surface  temperature  of the   suction   chamber   40   at  every  temperature-controlled zone on the inner wall of the suction chamber 40 while the temperature  controller  70  controls  the  heating  condition by each of the heating wire type heaters 502 for each temperature-controlled   zone,   thus   setting   the  inner  wall surface  temperature of the suction chamber 40 to  a desired  temperature,  that  is, above  a volatile  matter attachment   suppressing   temperature   (attachment suppressing    temperature).<br>
This   volatile   matter   attachment   suppressing temperature   is  a  temperature  which  can   suppress   the attachment of a volatile matter(s), contained in the air within the suction chamber 40, to the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40, and is set on the basis of the composition and concentration  of the volatile  matter,  the coefficient of mass transfer to the inner wall surface, and others.<br><br>
Furthermore,  the  entire suction chamber 40 is rotatably  supported  coaxially  (around  the  roll  supporting shaft  16) with the casting roll 3 through the aforesaid circumferentially moving mechanism,  so that it is movable along the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3 in a state where a necessary gap is maintainable therebetween.<br>
Still further, an elastic seal member 50 is interposed between the T die  1  and the suction chamber 40 to seal the gap therebetween.    This elastic seal member 50 is disposed throughout a width exceeding the  overall  width of the membrane 2, and as shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 4, is made up of an elastic seal body 51  and fixtures (fitting tools) 52, 53, so that, in response to variation of the gap between the upper surface of the suction chamber 40 and the lower surface of the T die 1, it elastically deforms to automatically  and  continuously  seal   the  gap  therebetween.<br>
The elastic seal body 51 is fixed to the suction chamber 40 in a manner that its lower portion is held between rising portions 52b, 53b of the fixtures 52, 53 in the forward and  backward  directions and  the fixtures 52, 53  are fixedly tightened with fitting bolts 55 with respect to the upper wall 41a of the suction chamber 40.<br>
The fixture 53 is disposed to be placed on the fixture 52, and in a state where elongated holes 52a made on the<br><br>
fixture 52 side are aligned with elongated holes 53a made on the fixture 53 side, the fitting bolts 55 are inserted through  washers  54 into these elongated holes 52a,  53a and tightened with respect to the upper wall 41a of the suction chamber 40 so that the fixtures 52, 53 are fixed integrally.    As shown in Fig. 4, upper wall 41a side female screws to be engaged with the fitting bolts 55 are constructed as blind screws in a rear plate 41e.<br>
The elongated holes 52a are made for the purpose of changing the position of the fixture 53 so that elastic seal bodies 51  different in size can be fitted to the suction chamber 40.    Further, the elongated holes 53a are for the purpose of adjusting the fitting position of the elastic seal member 50 to the suction chamber 40 in cooperation with the fixture  52 side elongated holes 52a.<br>
The elastic seal body 51 is made of a foaming agent such as a polyimide foam having an excellent heat resistance,  a high impact resilience and a less compressive permanent  strain,  and  formed  into  a  semicircular  bar-like configuration in cross section, with its front surface being covered with a glass cloth (made by integrally adhering an aluminium foil through an adhesive to a glass cloth) coated with an aluminium foil.   Further, as shown in Fig.  1, the elastic  seal member 50 closes the portion between the T<br><br>
die  1  and the suction chamber 40 by coming into pressing contact with the T die 1 due to an elastic force.<br>
The   resin-made   membrane  formation  casting apparatus according  to the first embodiment of this invention is  constructed as  described above,  a molten resin from  a  non-shown  extruding  machine  is  extruded  through the T die  1  into a film-like or sheet-like membrane 2 and then caught on the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3.<br>
At this time, the air within the suction chamber 40 is taken by the vacuum pump 5, so that the air in the close contact section between  the membrane 2  and the  casting roll 3 is sucked through the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.    Whereupon, the pressure in the space in the vicinity of that close contact section drops to remove the air caught up into between the membrane  2 and the casting roll 3, which allows the membrane 2 made from a molten resin to be stably brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Meanwhile,  the   attachment quantity   of volatile matters  such as  a residual monomer,  oligomer and  additive onto the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40 is affected  by  the  inner wall  surface  temperature of the suction chamber 40.    Although the free energy of a attaching  substance  (volatile  matter)  commonly  tends  to<br><br>
reduce with the attachment to the inner wall surface, raising the temperature  of the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40 can work against the reduction of the free  energy  due to  the  attachment,  and the attachment becomes  hard  so  that  the   attachment quantity   decreases. Further,  the   attachment  quantity  decreases  as   the  inner wall  surface  temperature of the  suction chamber 40 rises, and  reaches   zero  when  exceeding   some  temperature (attachment   suppressing   temperature).      Incidentally,   the attachment   suppressing   temperature   varies   on   the composition  and  concentration of the  attaching substance (volatile matter), the coefficient of mass transfer to the inner wall surface,  and others.<br>
Thus,  in  the  resin-made  membrane  formation  casting apparatus  according to  the first embodiment,   the temperature  sensors  501   set in the interior of the housing 41  detect the surface temperature of the inner wall of the suction  chamber 40,   and  the  temperature  controller 70 controls  the heating wire type heaters 502  so  that the inner  wall  surface temperature  of the  suction chamber 40 is  kept above  a  volatile  matter attachment  suppressing temperature   depending   upon   the   composition   and concentration of a volatile matter contained in air within the suction chamber 40, the coefficient of mass transfer of the inner wall surface and others, thus controlling the<br><br>
attachment of the  volatile matter.     Whereupon,  no condensation of a volatile gas such as an additive generated  as  a volatile matter from  the membrane  2 nor attachment thereof to the inner wall  surface of the suction chamber 40 take place, but it goes out from the suction chamber 40 and the suction duct 60.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation casting  apparatus  according to  the  first embodiment,  the  suction  chamber 40  is  provided separately and despondently from  the T die  1, and the suction  chamber 40 is  movable  along  the  circumnferential direction of the casting roll 3 by means of the driving member  110 in a state where the necessary seal gap 40d is maintained with respect to the casting roll 3.<br>
Accordingly, if the gap between the T die 1  and the casting roll 3 is large, the suction chamber 40 is shifted counterclockwise  around the  roll  supporting  shaft   16 by the driving member  110 to advance up to a desired position and the suction inlet (opening section 40a) of the suction chamber 40 is brought close to the close-contact portion between the membrane  2 and the casting roll 3, thereby   shortening   the  interval  between  the   membrane   2 and the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.    On the contrary, if the interval between the T die  1  and the casting roll 3 is small, the suction chamber 40 is shifted<br><br>
clockwise around the roll supporting  shaft  16 by the driving member 110 to move back to a desired position.<br>
Furthermore,  at this  time,  since  the  suction  chamber 40 is made along the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3, even if it is rotationally driven by the driving  member  110, the necessary seal gap 40d is always maintainable  between  the  suction  chamber 40  and  the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3. Whereupon,  irrespective of the dimension of the gap between the T die  1 and the casting roll 3, a necessary pressure  reduction  level  is  securable  in  the pressure reduction  space,  and  the pressure reduction in  the  space between the membrane 2 and the casting rolJ  3 can stably be accomplished by the  suction chamber 40.<br>
Still further, even if the gap (interval) between the T die  1  and the suction chamber 40 varies due to the variation of the dimension of the interval between the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 or the position of the suction chamber 40 as mentioned above, in this  embodiment,  the elastic seal member 50 is placed between the T die  1 and the suction chamber 40, and closes the gap between the T die  1  and the suction chamber 40 while following that variation.     Whereupon,  the  airtightness  in  the  pressure reduction space  surrounded by  the T die  1,  the membrane 2 and the suction chamber 40 is maintainable,  so that the<br><br>
necessary   pressure  reduction   level  in  that  pressure reduction  space  is   certainly   attainable.<br>
Besides, it is also appropriate that the operation for the  driving  member   110  being  rotationally  driven  around the roll supporting  shaft  16  to make the suction chamber 40 take a rotating action is done manually, or that the operation is  accomplished  fay  a non-shown  driving mechanism   (drive   motor).<br>
In Fig.   I, the contour configuration (before deformation due to the extrusion from the T die  1) of the elastic seal member 50 before the movement of the suction chamber 40 is shown by a dashed line 50a.<br>
In addition, in the case that the positional relationship between the T die 1  and the casting roll 3 is changed largely, the elastic seal member 50 itself is replaced with  another with  a different size,  and adjustment is  again done.<br>
As  mentioned  above,   with  the  resin-made  membrane formation casting  apparatus  according  to  the  first embodiment  of this invention,  the pressure reduction in the space between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is  stably achievable by the  suction chamber 40 regardless of the dimension of the gap between the T die 1 and the casting roll 3, and the gap between the T die 1  and the casting roll 3 can adequately be set even in the case of any<br><br>
type of resin, with the result that a necessary film characteristic   (membrane   characteristic)  is   securable   to sharply  improve  the  quality  of the  resin-made  membrane (film or sheet) 2.<br>
Moreover,  according to this embodiment,  the elastic seal member 50 can more surely and automatically close the gap between the upper surface of the suction chamber 40 and the lower surface of the T die 1 even at the change of the position of the suction chamber 40,  which allows the airtightness  of the  pressure  reduction  space  surrounded  by the T die  1, the membrane 2 and the suction chamber 40 to be  securable  to  surely provide  a necessary  pressure reduction  level  in that pressure  reduction  space.<br>
In addition, even at the positional adjustment of the suction chamber 40 for the optima! condition prior to the production running for each membrane (film,  sheet) 2,  the gap between the upper surface  of the  suction chamber 40 and the lower surface of the T die 1 can surely and automatically be  sealed by  the elastic  seal member 50 irrespective of the change of the position of the suction chamber 40 as mentioned above, and therefore, it is possible  to  surely prevent  the  vibrations  of the  membrane 2 occurring because of the air flow into the suction chamber 40 through  that  gap  and further to  extremely facilitate the  adjustment work.     And,  this permits  the<br><br>
production  running  to  continuously   start  immediately   after the  adjustment   work.<br>
Furthermore,  with  the  casting  apparatus  according  to this embodiment, an additive such as a slipping agent and an antistatic  agent volatilizing from the membrane 2 (molten resin) is also sucked into the suction chamber 40 when the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken by the suction chamber 40, and at this  time, the inner wall surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40 is kept by the temperature   adjusting   unit   including   the   temperature sensors  501, the heating wire type heaters  502  and the temperature controller 70 to  be  above  a volatile  matter attachment   suppressing   temperature   depending   upon   the composition and concentration of a volatile mater contained in the air within the suction chamber 40,  the mass transfer coefficient of the inner wall surface and others.    That is, the surface temperature of the inner wall of the suction chamber 40 is controllable without depending upon the suction gas quantity or the like in the suction chamber 40, so that the condensation of the volatile gas from  the membrane 2  and the  attachment thereof onto the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40   are   surely   suppressible.<br><br>
Accordingly, the condensed and  attached volatile matter does not drop onto the casting roll 3, so that the contamination of membrane 2 is avoidable,  which allows the  formation  of  a  high-quality   resin-made  membrane (film or sheet) 2.<br>
Although   in   the   above-described  first  embodiment the heating wire type heaters 502 are embedded in the interior of the housing 41, this invention is not limited to this, but it is also appropriate that a plate-like heating wire type heater (plate healer; see numeral 503 in Fig. 5) or a film-like heating wire type heater (see numeral 504 in Fig. 6) is embedded in the interior of the housing 41. This construction can also provide the same effects as those  of the   above-described  first  embodiment. (B)    Description of a Second Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made membrane  according to  a second embodiment  of this invention,  and is a side-elevational and  cross-sectional view  showing its  suction chamber, additionally including  an illustration of its  control system. In   the  resin-made  membrane  formation   casting  apparatus according to this second embodiment, in place of the heating  wire  type heaters  502 being  embedded  in  the housing 41  of the suction chamber 40 in the Fig.  1 resin-made  membrane   formation  casting  apparatus   according   to<br><br>
the first embodiment,  a plate-like heating wire type heater (plate heater)  503 is disposed along the outer wall surface of the housing 41 as shown in Fig. 5, and other parts are constructed  like   those   of  the  resin-made  membrane formation casting apparatus  according to the first embodiment.     In the illustration,  the same  numerals  as those used in the above description signify the same or corresponding parts,  and  the description  thereof will  be omitted   for  brevity.<br>
In this  second embodiment, in addition to the plate¬like heating wire type heater 503 serving as a heating means being provided along the outer wall surface of the housing 41  comprising the upper walls 41a, 41b, the rear wall 41c and the left-  and right-hand side walls 41d constituting   the   suction  chamber  40,   temperature   sensors 501  are set at a plurality of portions (5 in this embodiment)  of the  housing 41   corresponding  to temperature-controlled  zones  in  order  to  detect  the  inner wall  surface  temperature  of the  suction chamber 40.<br>
As  in  the  first  embodiment,  the  temperature controller  70  receives  information  representative   of  the temperature   sensed   by   the   respective   temperature   sensors 501 as shown by arrows with circled numerals  1  to 5 in Fig.  5,  and compares the temperature information with a given  preset  value,   thereby  accomplishing  feedback<br><br>
control of the heating condition by the healing wire type heaters   503.<br>
More specifically, in the second embodiment, a temperature  adjusting  unit is  composed  of the  aforesaid temperature   sensors   501,  plate-like  heating   wire   type heater  503  and  temperature  controller  70,  where  each of the  temperature  sensors  501   senses  the  inner wall  surface temperature of the  suction  chamber 40 at every temperature-controlled zone  on  the inner wall  of the suction  chamber 40  while   the  temperature  controller 70 controls, on the basis of the detection result, the heating condition by  the plate-like  heating wire type heater  503  at every  temperature-controlled  zone  so  that  the  inner wall surface temperature of the suction chamber 40 can be set to a desired value, that is, above a volatile matter attachment   suppressing   temperature   (attachment suppressing    temperature).<br>
In  the  second embodiment,  the elastic  seal member 50 is fitted onto the outer circumferential surface of the plate-like  heating  wire  type  heater  503.<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  construction,   even  in  the second embodiment,  a molten resin  from  a non-shown extruding machine is extruded from the T die  1  into a film-like or sheet-like membrane 2 which in turn,  is<br><br>
caught by the  outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3 to be subjected to cooling for formation.<br>
At this time, in a manner that the air within the suction chamber 40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5, the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken through the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.    Whereupon, the pressure reduction in the space near that close contact section takes place to drive out the air caught up into between the membrane 2 and the casting roll  3, so that the membrane 2 made of a molten resin can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation casting  apparatus  according  to  the  second embodiment,   the  temperature sensors  501   placed  in  the housing 41   detect the  surface temperature  of the  inner wall of the  suction chamber 40,  and the  temperature controller 70  controls  the plate-like  heating  wire  type heater 503  so  that the  inner wall surface temperature  of the suction chamber 40 is kept to be above a volatile matter   attachment   suppressing   temperature   depending upon the composition and concentration of a volatile matter contained in the air within the suction chamber 40, the mass  transfer coefficient of the inner wall surface and others,   thereby  suppressing  the  attachment  of the  volatile<br><br>
matter onto the inner wall surface of the suction chamber<br>
40.	Thus, the volatile gas such as an additive volatilizing<br>
from  the  membrane  2  is  removable  without condensing<br>
and attaching onto the inner wall of the suction chamber<br>
40.<br>
As   described   above,   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according to the  second embodiment of this invention can offer the same effects as those  of the   above-described  first embodiment,   and further,  since the heating means can more easily be provided in the housing 41  as compared with the case that the  healing  wire type heaters 502 are  embedded in  the housing 41,  the apparatus is economically producible at a low cost.<br>
Although   in   the   above-described  second   embodiment the  plate-like  heating  wire  type  heater 503  is provided along the outer wall surface of the housing 41, this invention is not limited to this, but it is also appropriate that a sheathed heater or a film-like heating wire type heater is placed along the outer wall surface of the housing<br>
41.	Even in this case, the same effects as those of the<br>
second   embodiment   are   attainable.<br>
(C)    Description of a Third Embodiment of the Invention Fig. 6 shows a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made  membrane  according  to  a  third  embodiment  of<br><br>
this  invention,  and is  a  side-elevational  and cross-sectional view  showing  its  suction  chamber,  additionally  including an illustration of its control system.    In the resin-made membrane  formation  casting   apparatus  according  to   this third embodiment, in place of the plate-like heating  wire type heater 503 being placed outside the housing 41  of the suction chamber 40 in the Fig.  5 resin-made membrane formation  casting apparatus  according  to  the  second embodiment,  a film-like heating wire type  heater 504 is disposed inside the housing 41  to make the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40 as shown in Fig. 6, and other parts  are  constructed like  those of the resin-made membrane  formation  casting   apparatus   according  to  the first and second embodiments.     In the illustration, the same numerals as those used in the above description signify the same or corresponding parts, and the description thereof will be omitted for simplicity.<br>
In  this  third  embodiment,  the film-like heating  wire type heater 504 acting as a heating means is provided inside the housing 41  comprising the upper walls 41a, 41b, the rear wall 4Ic and the left- and right-hand side walls 41d composing the suction chamber 40 to form the inner wall  surface  of the suction chamber 40,  and temperature sensors 501  are set at a plurality of portions (5 in this embodiment)  of the  housing 41   corresponding  to<br><br>
temperature-controlled zones  to  detect the inner  wall surface  temperature  of the  suction  chamber 40  (the inner surface  temperature  of the  film-like  heating  wire  type heater   504).<br>
As in the first and second embodiments, the temperature   controller   70   receives   information representative   of the  temperature   sensed   by  the respective   temperature  sensors   501   as   shown  by  arrows with circled numerals 1  to 5 in Fig. 6, and compares the temperature  information  with   a  given  preset  value, thereby  accomplishing feedback  control  of the heating condition by  the heating  wire type heaters  504.<br>
More specifically, in the third embodiment,  a temperature  adjusting  unit is  composed  of the  aforesaid temperature   sensors   501,   film-like  heating   wire  type heater 504  and  temperature controller 70,  where  each of the  temperature  sensors  501   senses  the inner wall  surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40 (that is,  the inner surface  temperature  of the  film-like  heating  wire  type heater 504)  at  every  temperature-controlled  zone  on   the inner wall of the suction chamber 40 while the temperature controller 70 controls,  on the basis of the detection result,  the heating condition  by the film-like heating  wire   type   heater  504   at  every  temperature-controlled zone so that the inner wall surface temperature<br><br>
of the suction chamber 40 can be set to a desired value, that is,  above  a volatile matter  attachment suppressing temperature   (attachment   suppressing   temperature).<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  construction,  even  in  the third embodiment,   a molten  resin from a  non-shown extruding machine is extruded from the T die  1 into a film-like or sheet-like membrane 2 which in turn,  is caught by the  outer circumferential  surface  of the casting roll 3 to be subjected to cooling for formation.<br>
At this time, in a manner that the air within the suction chamber 40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5, the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken through the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.     Whereupon, the pressure reduction in the space near that close contact section takes place to drive out the air caught up into between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3, so that the membrane 2 made of a molten resin can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to  the  third embodiment,   the  temperature   sensors   501   placed  in  the housing 41   detect the  surface temperature  of the  inner wall  of the  suction chamber 40,  and the temperature controller 70 controls  the film-like heating  wire type<br><br>
heater 504  so that the inner wall  surface  temperature of the suction chamber 40 (that is,  the inner surface temperature  of the  film-like  heating  wire  type  heater 504) is kept to be above a volatile matter attachment suppressing   temperature   depending   upon   the   composition and  concentration of the volatile  matter contained in  the air within the  suction chamber 40,  the mass  transfer coefficient of the inner wall  surface and others,  thereby suppressing the attachment of the  volatile  matter onto  the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40.    Thus, the volatile gas such as an additive volatilizing from the membrane  2  is  removable  without  condensing  and attaching onto the inner wall of the suction chamber 40.<br>
As   described   above,   the  resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to  the  third embodiment of this invention can offer the same effects as those  of the  above-described  second  embodiment,  and since the temperature of the  inner wall surface of the housing 41   is  measured  by the  temperature  sensors  501 and the film-like heating wire  type heater 504 placed on the inner wall surface of the housing 41  is controlled by the  temperature  controller  70,   the  temperature  of the inner wall surface of the housing 41  is directly controllable and is more certainly adjustable, which allows more<br><br>
certain  suppression  of  the  condensation  and   attachment onto the inner wall of the suction chamber 40.<br>
Although  in   the   above-described   third   embodiment the film-like heating wire  type heater 504  is provided inside the housing 41  to constitute the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40, this invention is not limited to this, and it is also appropriate that a plate heater is provided inside the housing 41  to make the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40 or a sheathed heater is adhered to the inside of the housing 41.    Even in either case, the same effects as those of the third embodiment are   attainable. (D)    Description of a Fourth Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made  membrane   according  to  a  fourth  embodiment of this invention,  and is  a side-elevational and cross-sectional view  showing  its  suction chamber,  additionally including an illustration of its control system.    In the resin-made  membrane  formation  casting  apparatus   according   to this fourth eKibodiment, in place of the heating wire type heaters 502 being embedded in the housing 41  of the suction chamber 40 in the Fig.   1   resin-made membrane formation casting  apparatus  according to the first embodiment,   as  shown  in  Fig.  7,   temperature-controlled heating passages (fluid passages) 505 are made in the<br><br>
housing   41   and  a  temperature-controlled  heating   medium is  provided  which  is  movable  within  the  temperature-controlled heating passages  505,  and  other parts  are constructed  like  those   of the  resin-made  membrane formation casting apparatus  according to the first to  third embodiments.     In the illustration,  the  same numerals  as those used in the above description signify the same or corresponding  parts,  and the  description  thereof will  be omitted  for  brevity.<br>
In   this   fourth   embodiment,   the   temperature-controlled heating passages  505 are made in the housing 41  comprising the upper wails 41a, 41b, the rear wall 41c and  the left-  and right-hand  side  walls 41d constituting the suction chamber 40,  with they being arranged at a nearly equal interval  along the respective  wall members (that is, the upper walls 41a, 41b, the rear wall 41c and the  left-  and right-hand  side  walls  41d)  forming  structural members   of the  housing  41,  and  the  temperature-controlled heating medium (not shown)  is made to travel within  the   temperature-controlled   heating   passages   505. In  addition,   temperature   sensors  501   for  detecting  the inner wall  surface  temperature  of the  suction chamber 40 are set at a plurality of (5 in this embodiment) portions of the   housing   41   corresponding   to   temperature-controlled zones.<br><br>
As in the first to third embodiments, the temperature   controller   70   receives   information representative   of  the  temperature   sensed   by   the respective   temperature   sensors   501   as  shown  by  arrows with circled numerals 1  to 5 in Fig. 7, and compares the temperature  information  with  a  given  preset  value, thereby  accomplishing feedback control of the heating condition   by   the   temperature-controlled   heating   medium in   the   temperature-controlled  healing   passages   505.<br>
More specifically, in the fourth embodiment, a temperature adjusting unit is  composed of a heating means comprising   the   temperature-controlled   heating   passages 505   and   the   temperature-controlled   heating   medium   and further   comprising  the  temperature  sensors   501   and  the temperature  controller  70,   where   each   of  the  temperature sensors  501   senses  the  inner wall  surface  temperature  of the   suction   chamber  40   at   every   temperature-controlled zone on the inner wall of the suction chamber 40 while the temperature controller 70 controls,  on the basis of the detection   result,   the   temperature   of  the   temperature-controlled   heating   medium   traveling   in   the   temperature-controlled heating passages 505 or the flow rate thereof so that the  inner wall  surface temperature  of the  suction chamber 40 can be set to a desired value, that is, above a<br><br>
volatile   matter   attachmeat   suppressing   temperature (attachment   suppressing   temperature).<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  construction,   even  in  the fourth  embodiment,  a molten resin from  a non-shown extruding machine is extruded from the T die  1  into a film-like or sheet-like membrane  2 which in turn, is caught by  the outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3 to be subjected to cooling for formation.<br>
At this time, in a manner that the air within the suction chamber 40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5, the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken through the opening section 40a  of the suction chamber 40.    Whereupon, the pressure reduction in the space near that close contact section takes place to drive out the air caught up into between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3, so that the membrane 2 made of a molten resin can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to  the  fourth embodiment,   the  temperature   sensors  501   placed  in  the housing 41   detect the  surface  temperature  of the  inner wall  of the suction chamber 40,  and the temperature controller  70   controls   the   temperature   of  the   temperature-controlled  heating  medium   traveling  within   the<br><br>
temperature-controlled  heating  passages  505   or  the   flow rate thereof so that the inner wall surface  temperature  of the suction chamber 40 is kept to be above a volatile matter   attachment   suppressing   temperature   depending upon the composition  and concentration of the  volatile matter contained in the air within the suction chamber 40, the mass transfer coefficient of the inner wall surface and others,   thereby  suppressing  the  attachment  of the  volatile matter onto the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40.    Thus, the volatile gas such as an additive volatilizing from  the  membrane  2  is removable  without condensing and attaching onto the inner wall of the suction chamber 40.<br>
As   described   above,   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to  the  fourth embodiment of this invention can offer the  same effects as those  of the   above-described  first  embodiment  because the   temperature   of   the   temperature-controlled   heating medium   placed   within   the   temperature-controlled   heating passages 505  can be changed so that the temperature of the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40 is adjusted to a desired value.<br>
Incidentally,   for  putting  this  embodiment  into practice, it is  desirable  to add, for example,  a temperature-controlled  heating   medium   supplying  means  for  supplying<br><br>
the   temperature-controlled  heating   medium   into   the temperature-conlroUed  heating  passages  505   or  a temperature-controlled   heating   medium   temperature adjusting  means for adjusting and maintaining the temperature   of   the   temperature-controlled   heating medium to a given value. (E)    Description of a Fifth Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made  membrane  according  to  a  fifth  embodiment of this invention, and is a side-elevational and cross-sectional  view  showing  its  suction chamber,  additionally including an illustration of its control system.    In the resin-made  membrane  formation   casting   apparatus  according  to this fifth embodiment, as shown in Fig. 8, the heating wire type heaters 502 are removed from the housing 41  of the suction chamber 40 in the Fig.   1  resin-made membrane formation casting  apparatus  according  to  the first embodiment,   whereas   a   temperature-controlled   block  506 having   temperature-controlled   heating   passages   (fluid passages) 505 therein is placed outside the housing 41, with   a   temperature-controlled   heating   medium   being provided   to   be  movable   within   the   temperature-controlled heating passages  505.     The other parts are constructed like those  of  the  resin-made  membrane  formation  casting apparatus  according to the  first embodiment.     In the<br><br>
illustration, the same numerals as those used in the above description signify the same or corresponding parts, which will be omitted from the description for brevity.<br>
In   this   fifth  embodiment,   temperature  sensors   501 are set at a plurality of (5 in this embodiment) portions of the housing 41  comprising the upper walls 41a, 41b,  the rear wall 41c and the left- and right-hand side walls 41d constituting  the  suction chamber 40  corresponding  to temperature-controlled  zones   in  order  to  detect  the   inner wall surface  temperature  of the  suction  chamber 40.<br>
In  addition,   the  temperature-controlled  block  506  is disposed over the entire outer wall surface of the suction chamber 40 to be brought closely into the outer surface of the  housing  41,  and in  the  temperature-controlled  block 506,   the   temperature-controlled   heating  passages   505   are made at a nearly equal interval along the respective wall members (that is, the upper walls 41a, 41b, the rear wall 41c and the left- and right-hand side walls 41d) forming the  structural members  of the housing 41,  and  the temperature-controlled   heating   medium   (not   shown)   is designed   to   travel   within   the   temperature-controlled heating  passages   505.<br>
As well as the first to fourth embodiments, the temperature   controller   70   receives   information representative   of  the  temperature   sensed  by   the<br><br>
respective  temperature   sensors  501   as  shown  by  arrows with circled numerals 1  to 5 in Fig. 8, and compares the temperature  information  with  a  given  preset  value, thereby  accomplishing  feedback control  of the  heating condition   by   the   temperature-controlled  heating   medium in   the   temperature-controlled  heating   passages   505.<br>
More specifically, in the fifth embodiment, a temperature adjusting unit is  composed of a heating  means (the   temperature-controlled  heating  passages   505   and  the temperature-controlled   heating   medium)   within   the temperature-controlled   block   506,   the   temperature sensors   501   and  the  temperature  controller 70,   where each of the temperature  sensors  501   senses the inner wall surface  temperature  of the  suction chamber 40  at every temperature-controlled zone  on  the inner wall  of the suction  chamber  40  while  the  temperature  controller 70 controls, on the basis of the detection result, the flow rate or   temperature   of  the   temperature-controlled   heating medium   placed   in   the   temperature-controlled   heating passages  505  so that the inner wall surface temperature of the suction chamber 40 can be set to a desired value, that is,   above  a  volatile  matter  attachment  suppressing temperature    (attachment   suppressing   temperature).<br><br>
Besides, in the fifth embodiment, the elastic seal member  50 is  mounted  on  the  outer circumferential surface  of the   temperature-controlled   block  506.<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  construction,  even  in  the fifth  embodiment,  a molten resin from a non-shown extruding machine is extruded from the T die 1  into a film-like  or sheet-like membrane 2 which in turn, is caught by the  outer circumferential  surface of the casting roll 3 to be subjected to cooling for formation.<br>
At this time, in a manner that the air within the suction chamber 40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5, the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken through the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.     Whereupon,  the pressure reduction in the space near that close contact section takes place to drive out the air caught up into between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3, so that the membrane 2 made of a molten resin can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation casting  apparatus  according to  the  fifth embodiment,   the  temperature  sensors  501   placed  in  the housing  41   detect the  surface temperature  of the inner wall  of the suction chamber 40,  and the  temperature controller 70 controls the flow rate or temperature of the<br><br>
temperature-controlled   heating   medium   situated   within the   temperature-controlled  heating  passages   505   so  that the  inner wall  surface  temperature  of the  suction chamber 40 is kept to be above a volatile matter attachment suppressing   temperature   depending   upon   the   composition and  concentration of the volatile matter contained in the air within the suction chamber 40,  the mass transfer coefficient of the inner wall surface and others, thereby suppressing  the  attachment of the  volatile  matter onto the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40.    Thus, the volatile gas such as an additive volatilizing from the membrane  2  is  removable  without condensing  and attaching onto the inner wall of the suction chamber 40.<br>
As   described  above,   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according to the fifth embodiment of this invention can offer the same effects as those  of the   above-described  fourth  embodiment,   and since  the heating means is  set on  the temperature-controlled block 506 placed closely into contact with the surface of the housing 41, the heating means can be disposed with  a simple  structure  so that the apparatus is economically producible at a low cost.<br>
Incidentally,   for putting  this  embodiment  into practice,  it is desirable to add, for example,  a temperature-controlled  heating  mediuili   supplying  means  for  supplying<br><br>
the   temperature-controlled   heating   medium   into   the temperature-controlled  heating   passages   505   or   a temperature-controlled   heating   medium   temperature adjusting  means  for  adjusting  and  maintaining  the temperature   of   the   temperature-controlled   heating medium to a given value. (F)    Description of a Sixth Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made  membrane  according  to  a  sixth  embodiment of this invention, and is a side-elevational and cross-sectional  view  showing  its  suction chamber,  additionally including an illustration of its control system.    In the resin-made   membrane  formation   casting  apparatus  according  to this sixth embodiment, as shown in Fig. 9, a temperature-controlled   block   506   having   temperature-controlled cooling passages  (fluid passages) 507  therein is placed outside the housing 41  of the suction chamber 40 in the Fig.   1   resin-made   membrane  formation  casting   apparatus according  to  the  first  embodiment,  with  a  temperature-controlled cooling  medium (not shown) being provided to be  movable   within   the   temperature-controlled   cooling passages  507,  and  a temperature controller 71   is provided. The other parts are constructed like those of the resin-made  membrane  formation  casting  apparatus   according  to the first embodiment.    In the illustration,  the same<br><br>
numerals as those used in the above description signify the same or corresponding parts, which will be omitted from the  description for simplicity.<br>
In this sixth embodiment, as in the case of the first embodiment,  heating  wire  type  heaters  502  being  heating means  are embedded in the housing 41  comprising the upper walls 41a, 41b, the rear wall 41c and the left- and right-hand  side  walls  41 d  constituting  the  suction  chamber<br>
40	to be  arranged  at a nearly equal interval throughout the entire width of the  suction chamber 40,  and further, temperature  sensors  for  sensing  the  inner  wall  surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40 are placed at a plurality of portions (5  in this embodiment) of the housing<br>
41	corresponding   to   temperature-controlled   zones.<br>
Further,   the   temperature  controller   71   receives information   representative   of  the  temperature   sensed   by the  respective  temperature  sensors  501   as   shown by arrows with circled numerals  1 to 5 in Fig. 9, and compares the  temperature  information  with  a  given preset value  to control the heating condition by  the heating wire type heaters 502 and further to control the flow rate or temperature   of  a   temperature-controlled   cooling   medium movably   placed   within   the   temperature-controlled  cooling passages   507.<br><br>
Still further, as well as the fifth embodiment, the temperature-controlled  block  506  is  disposed  over the entire outer wall surface of the suction chamber 40 to be brought closely into the outer surface of the housing 41, and  in  the  temperature-controlled  block  506,   the temperature-controlled  cooling  passages  507   are  made  at  a nearly  equal  interval  along  the  respective  wall  members (that is, the upper walls 41a, 41b, the rear wall 41c and the left-  and right-hand side walls 4Id) forming the structural members  of the housing 41,  and the temperature-controlled  cooling  medium  (not  shown)   is designed   to   travel   within   the   temperature-controlled cooling passages  507.<br>
More specifically, in the sixth embodiment, a temperature adjusting unit is composed of a cooling means (the  temperature-controlled   cooling  passages   507   and  the temperature-controlled   cooling   medium)   within   the temperature-controlled   block   506,   the   temperature sensors 501,  the heating wire type heaters 502  and the temperature  controller  71,   where  each  of the   temperature sensors  501   senses the  inner wall  surface  temperature  of the   suction   chamber  40   at   every   temperature-controlled zone on the inner wall of the suction chamber 40 while the temperature controller 71  controls, on the basis  of the detection result,  the flow rate or temperature of the<br><br>
temperature-controlled   cooling   medium   and   the   heating condition by the heating wire type heaters 502  so that the inner wall  surface  temperature of the  suction chamber 40 can be set to a desired value, that is, above a volatile matter   attachment   suppressing   temperature   (attachment suppressing    temperature).<br>
A description will be made hereinbelow of one example of control methods for the inner wall surface temperature  of the  suction chamber 40 by  the temperature  controller 71.     When  the  inner wall surface temperature  of the  suction  chamber 40  measured  by  the temperature   sensors   501   becomes  higher  than  the  preset temperature  as  a  result  of the  detection,   the  temperature controller 71   stops the heating by the heating wire type heaters 502 while increasing the flow rate of the temperature-controlled   cooling   medium  placed   within   the temperature-controlled   cooling  passages   507  or  lowering the  temperature  thereof so  that the inner wall  surface temperature  of the  suction  chamber 40 drops.<br>
On the other hand, when the detection result shows that the inner wall  surface  temperature of the suction chamber  40  obtained  by  the  temperature   sensors  501 becomes   below   the   preset   temperature,   the   temperature controller 71   starts  the heating by the heating wire  type heaters 502 while restraining the flow rate  of the<br><br>
temperature-controlled   cooling   medium   within   the temperature-controlled  cooling passages  507   or  raising  the temperature   of   the   temperature-controlled   cooling medium,  thereby  making  the  inner wall  surface temperature  of the  suction  chamber 40 higher.<br>
In detail,  through the repetition of the control processes  by  the  temperature controller 71,  the  inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40 is converged to a given temperature   set  previously   in   the   temperature   controller 71   and maintained  at that value.<br>
Incidemally,  in the  sixth embodiment, the  elastic  seal member 50  is  mounted  on  the  outer circumferential surface   of  the   temperature-controlled  block  506.<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  construction,  even  in  the sixth embodiment,  a molten  resin from  a non-shown extruding machine is extruded from the T die  1  into a film-like  or sheet-like membrane 2 which in turn, is caught by the outer circumferential  surface of the casting roll 3 to be subjected to cooling for formation.<br>
At this time, in a manner that the air within the suction chamber 40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5, the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken through the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.     Whereupon, the pressure reduction in the space near that close contact section takes<br><br>
place to drive out the air caught up into between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3, so that the membrane 2 made of a molten resin can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to the  sixth embodiment,   the  temperature  sensors   501   placed  in  the housing 41   detect the  surface  temperature  of the inner wall  of the suction chamber 40,  and the temperature controller 71  controls the heating by the heating wire type heaters 502 or the flow rate or temperature of the temperature-controlled  cooling  medium  so  that  the  inner wall  surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40 is kept to be  above  a volatile  matter attachment  suppressing temperature   depending   upon   the   composition  and concentration of the volatile matter contained in the  air within  the  suction  chamber 40,  the mass transfer coefficient of the inner wall  surface and others, thereby suppressing the  attachment of the  volatile  matter onto  the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40.    Thus, the volatile gas such as an additive volatilizing from the membrane  2  is  removable  without  condensing  and attaching onto the inner wall of the suction chamber 40.<br>
As   described  above,   the  resin-made   membrane formation casting apparatus  according  to the sixth<br><br>
embodiment of this invention can offer the same effects as those  of the  above-described first embodiment,  and  since the housing 41  can be cooled by  the temperature-controlled  cooling  medium traveling within  the temperature-controlled  cooling  passages   507,   the  control time  required  for the  temperature  control  of the housing 41   becomes   short   and   the   temperature   adjustment becomes possible with a high accuracy.<br>
Incidentally,   for putting  this  embodiment into practice, it is desirable to add, for example,  a temperature-controlled cooling  medium  supplying  means  for  supplying the   temperature-controlled  cooling   medium   into  the temperature-controlled  cooling  passages  507   or  a temperature-controlled   cooling   medium   temperature adjusting  means  for adjusting  and maintaining  the temperature   of   the   temperature-controlled   cooling medium to a given value.<br>
Although   in   the  above-described   sixth  embodiment the  temperature  controller 71   controls  both  the  heating wire   type  heaters   502   and   temperature-controlled  cooling medium for the control of the inner wall surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40,  this  invention is not limited to this, and it is also appropriate that the inner wall  surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40 is controlled by the control of the flow rate or temperature of<br><br>
the   temperature-controlled  cooling  medium  in  a  state where the heating  by the healing wire type heaters  502 remains  uniform,  or the inner wall  surface  temperature  of the suction chamber 40 is controlled by the control of the heating by the heating wire  type heaters  502  while the flow   rate   or   temperature   of  the   temperature-controlled cooling medium is kept constant.    In either case, the same effects as those of the  sixth embodiment are obtainable.<br>
Furthermore,   although   in   the  above-described   sixth embodiment  the  heating  wire  type  heaters   502   embedded in the interior of the housing 41  are used as the heating means, this invention is not limited to this, it is also appropriate  that  the  plate-like  heating  wire   type  heater 503 shown in Fig. 5 or the film-like heating wire type heater 504 shown in Fig. 6 is placed along the outer wall surface of the housing 41 or is set inside the housing 41 to constitute  the  inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40,   or  the   temperature-controlled  heating  medium  is movably   provided   within   the   temperature-controlled heating passages 505 disposed along the interior of the suction chamber 41  as shown in Fig. 7. In either case, the same effects as those of the  sixth embodiment are obtainable. (G)    Description of a Seventh Embodiment of the Invention<br><br>
Fig.  10 illustrates a casting apparatus for formation of a resin-made membrane according to  a  seventh embodiment of this invention,  and is  a side-elevational and cross-sectional  view  showing  its  suction chamber, additionally including an illustration of its control system. In   the   resin-made   membrane   formation   casting   apparatus according  to this seventh embodiment,  the elastic  seal member 50 and others are removed from the Fig.   1  casting apparatus  according to  the first embodiment,  and as  shown in Fig.  10, the suction chamber 40 is fixedly secured through a heat insulating material 601   to one side surface of the T die I.    The other parts are constructed like those of  the  resin-made   membrane   formation  casting   apparatus according to the first embodiment.    In the illustration, the same numerals  as those used in the above description signify the same or corresponding parts,  which will be omitted from  the  description  for  simplicity.<br>
In  the apparatus  according  to  the  seventh embodiment, the suction chamber 40 is not made to be movable  along  the  circumferential  directions  of the  casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,  the  heat insulating  material  601   is placed between the T die 1  and the upper wall 41a of the suction chamber 40 to suppress the cooling of the side surface of the T die  1  occurring through the upper wall<br><br>
41a of the suction chamber 40 owing to the heat transfer between the sucked air flows and the inner wall surface of the  suction chamber 40.<br>
With  the  above-mentioned  construction,  even  in  the seventh  embodiment,  a  molten resin from  a non-shown extruding machine is extruded from the T die  1  into a film-like or sheet-like membrane 2 which in turn, is caught by the  outer circumferential surface of the casting roll 3 to be subjected to cooling for formation.<br>
At this time, in a manner that the air within the suction chamber 40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5, the air in the close contact section between the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 is taken through the opening section 40a of the suction chamber 40.     Whereupon, the pressure reduction in the space near that close contact section takes place to drive out the air caught up into between the membrane 2 and the casting roll  3, so that the membrane 2 made of a molten resin can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in   the   resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according   to  the  seventh embodiment, as  well  as  the first embodiment, the temperature  sensors  501   placed in the  housing 41   delect the surface temperature of the inner wall of the  suction chamber 40,  and  the  temperature  controller 70  controls<br><br>
the heating wire type heaters 502 so that the inner wall surface temperature of the  suction chamber 40 is kept to be  above  a  volatile  matter  attachment  suppressing temperature   (attachment   suppressing   temperature) depending upon the  composition  and concentration of the volatile matter contained in the air within the suction chamber 40, the mass transfer coefficient of the inner wall surface  and  others,  thereby   suppressing  the  attachment  of the volatile matter onto the inner wall surface of the suction chamber 40.    Thus, the volatile gas such as an additive  volatilizing from  the membrane  2  is  removable without condensing and attaching onto the inner wall of the  suction chamber 40.<br>
As   described   above,   the  resin-made   membrane formation  casting  apparatus  according  to  the  seventh embodiment of this invention can offer the same effects as those  of the  above-described  first  embodiment,  and  the apparatus  can  be manufactured with  a simple  structure, which results  in low-cost production of the  apparatus.<br>
Although   in   the   above-described   seventh embodiment  the   heating   wire  type  heaters   502   embedded in the interior of the housing 41  are employed as the heating means, this invention is not limited to this, and it is  also appropriate  that  the plate-like  heating wire  type heater 503 shown in Fig. 5 or the film-like heating wire<br><br>
type heater 504 shown in Fig. 6 is placed along the outer wall surface of the housing 41 or is set inside the housing 41 to constitute the inner wall surface of the suction chamber   40,   or  the   temperature-controlled   heating medium   is   movably  provided   within   the   temperature-controlled  heating  passages  505  disposed along  the  interior of the suction chamber 41 as shown in Fig. 7. In either case, the same effects as those of the seventh embodiment are   obtainable. (H)   Others<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments,  and it is intended to cover all changes  and modifications of the embodiments of the invention herein used for the purpose of the disclosure, which  do not constitute  departures from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
For instance,  although  in  the  above-described embodiments the elastic  seal member 50 is mounted  on the upper surface of the suction chamber 40,  this invention is not limited to this, it is also possible that the elastic seal member 50 is mounted on the lower surface of the T die  1 to be elaslically pressed into contact with the upper surface side of the suction chamber 40.<br>
Furthermore,   although   in   the  foregoing  embodiments the elastic seal member 50 is made of a foaming agent to<br><br>
have a semicircular bar-like configuration in cross section and its front surface is covered with a glass cloth coated with an aluminium foil, this invention is not within this limitation, it is also possible to use a plate spring which is inflated into an arc shape and turned.<br>
Still  further,  although  in  the foregoing embodiments the temperature sensors  are disposed at 5 portions of the housing 41, this invention is not within this limitation, any number of temperature  sensors  can be provided  if necessary, and no limitation is imposed on their locations.<br>
In  addition,  although  in  the foregoing embodiments not  only  the   temperature-controlled  heating  passages   and the   temperature-controlled   heating  medium  but   also   the heating  wire  type heaters  502,  the plate-like  healing  wire type  heater 503  and the  film-like heating wire  type heater 504 are used as the heating means, this invention does not fall  under this.<br>
Moreover,  although  in  the  foregoing  embodiment the temperature-controlled   cooling   passages   and   the temperature-controlled  cooling  medium  are   used   as   the cooling means, this invention does not fall under this, and it is also possible to employ a different cooling means such as a Peltier element.<br><br><br>
