INTRODUCTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for isolating glycoprotein from neem leaf and its<br>
characterization to define immunomodulatory and cancer preventive functions.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a widely prevalent and esteemed wonder tree, mainly<br>
cultivated in Indian subcontinent (1). This unique plant is well known in India and its<br>
neighbouring countries for more than 2000 years as one of the most versatile medicinal<br>
plants having a wide spectrum of biological activity (2). As per recommendation of the<br>
Indian Ayurvadic literature, eight parts of the neem tree (leaf, bark,flower, twig, gum,<br>
seed, pulp and oil) have shown to possess several biologically active components having<br>
a wide variety of activities against different ailments (2). This SARBAROGAMBAPINI<br>
neem generously contributes each and every parts of its body as suitable for human<br>
consumption. This valuable ancient knowledge surprisingly has been neglected in India<br>
and its recognition was chiefly limited within poor rural Indian population, as a village<br>
dispensary (3). Neem products never considered as a prime factor towards Indian<br>
scientists for proper exploration of its therapeutic values and also towards commercial<br>
agencies for proper marketing of the economic values hidden within neem products.<br>
Neem products hit the popular media headlines only after it became the subject of legal<br>
controversy when the European Patent office rejected a patent application from the WR<br>
Grace Company and the United States Department of Agriculture. Although, neem<br>
remained neglected for a long time in the Western countries, interest on this particular<br>
medicinal plant is gradually growing and as a consequence, US National Academy of<br>
Science published a report on 1992 with a title, 'Neem-a tree for solving global problem'<br>
(National Academic Press, USA, 1992).<br>
Neem can be exploited in modern biological research, using toxicological, molecular<br>
biological, immunological techniques. These effort may disclose some new applications<br>
of neem, those are not described in Indian traditional medicine. Immune boost up by<br>
neem was not considered as a potential field of medical research, but the research<br>
associated with present invention will disclose several applications of neem leaf in the<br>
prevention of cancerous growth by stimulation of the body's defense (immune)<br>
mechanism.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Several pharmacological activities and medicinal applications of various parts of<br>
neem tree are known. Biological activities of neem tree are reported where crude extracts<br>
and their different fractions from leaf, bark, root, seed and oil were used. These reports<br>
have exhibited a wide diversity in biological functions from a group of compounds<br>
present in the various parts of the plant (4). Some of these are as follows:<br>
i. General Health: Neem is known to be useful remedy in some chronic skin diseases,<br>
ulcers, rheumatism, leprosy, dental troubles, intestinal helminthiasis, constipation, asthma<br><br>
and also as a general health promoter (5-7). Bark, leaf, root, flower and fruit together cure<br>
blood morbidity, biliary afflictions, itching, skin ulcers and burning sensations (4).<br>
Gastroprotective antiulcer effect of neem bark extract has been reported recently (8).<br>
ii. Reproduction: It also has wide range of effects on the reproductive system. Neem oil<br>
is used as a spermicidal (9) and early abortificient agent (10). It has contraceptive and<br>
antifertility properties (11). For long term contraceptive, single intrauterine application<br>
of neem extract has been reported (12). Oral administration of aqueous extract of neem<br>
leaf shows antifertility effect in mice (4). Neem seed preparations have been shown to be<br>
effective to abrogate pregnancy in rodents, monkeys and baboons (4). This antifertility<br>
effects are possibly mediated by activation of the cell mediated immune reaction, thus<br>
can overcome the side effects of steroidal contraceptives.<br>
iii. Immunomodulation: Various products of neem are known to have<br>
immunomodulatory properties. These may act by stimulating cell-mediated and/or<br>
humoral immunity. However, studies are incomplete and preliminary. Some of these<br>
published reports are encouraging. Neem kernel oil has been shown to induce the<br>
secretion of gamma interferon (13) and tumor necrotic factor-alpha (14). Dry neem leaf<br>
could enhance the antibody titre against new castle disease virus (15), bovine serun<br>
albumin and sheep erythrocytes (16). Intraperitoneal treatment of mice with neem oil<br>
reported to be increase the number of leukocytic cells in peritoneal lavage. Peritoneal<br>
macrophages exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity and expression of MHC class-II<br>
antigens after treatment with neem oil (13). Enhancement in macrophage migration<br>
inhibition and foot thickness in mice after neem treatment (17) was also observed. Neem<br>
(NIM-76) can enhance macrophage activity and lymphocyte proliferation response, while<br>
humoral component of immunity was unaffected 18). An aquaous extract from stem bark<br>
of neem has been shown to have an inhibitory influence on complement activation and<br>
superoxide ion production by polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes while having a<br>
stimulatory effect on the production of migration inhibition factor (MIF) by PMN<br>
leukocytes (19). The aqueous extract of stem bark possesses anticomplement activity,<br>
acting both on the alternative as well as classical pathway of complement activation in<br>
human serum.<br>
iv. Cancer: Based on some preliminary in vitro studies and its known effects on immune<br>
system, it can be hypothesized that neem components may have some effects on the<br>
restriction of tumor growth. Neem seed preparation contains a variety of limonoids, some<br>
of which are cytotoxic to N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma, 143B.TK-human osteosarcoma<br>
and sf9 insect cells (20). Water soluble polysaccharides isolated from the bark of Melia<br>
azadirachta, demonstrated antitumor effect with complete regression of tumors (21).<br>
Cytotoxicity of the neem toxin, azadirachtin A, in human glioblastoma cell lines is also<br>
reported (22). Recently, it is reported that the bark of the giant neem tree Melia dubia<br>
contains euphane type triterpenes, some of them can inhibit the growth of P388<br>
lymphocytic leukemia cell line (23). Effects of these neem compounds and mechanism of<br>
inhibition of tumor cell growth are completely unknown in in vivo. Neem leaf extracts<br>
enhance hepatic glutathione and glutathione dependent enzymes, which may offer a<br>
degree of chemoprevention during N-methyl-N-mtro-N-nitrosoguanidine induced gastric<br>
carcinogenesis in rats (24) and on 7, 12-dimethylbenzanthracene induced buccal pouch<br><br>
carcinogenesis (25). However, none of these reports was focused on the involvement of<br>
immune system in neem induced tumor growth inhibition. The mechanism of<br>
immunopotentiation is still unknown.<br>
Various parts of neem (Azadirachta indica) is used to cure different human diseases from<br>
the dawn of civilization. In inspiration with the ancient experiences, we are working on<br>
an aquaous preparation of neem leaf (NLP), which was proved to be nontoxic,<br>
hematostimulatory and immunostimulatory. This preparation has immunoprophylactic<br>
function to prevent the growth of murine Ehrlich's carcinoma and B16 melanoma.<br>
Studies utilizing adoptive cell transfer technology suggest that activation of various<br>
immunocompetent cells by neem leaf component(s) may be responsible for tumor growth<br>
restriction. NLP also acts as an adjuvant by inducing an active antitumor immunity in<br>
murine model against tumor antigens. Moreover, NLP mediated immune activation<br>
protects mice from leukepenia, caused by cancer chemotherapy. Constituents present in<br>
the neem leaf responsible for the immune functions are not known. Our preliminary<br>
findings, suggest that NLP has an instructive role in the secretion of Thl cytokines,<br>
IFNy, IL-12 and TNFa. However, active principal(s) present in neem leaf responsible for<br>
such immunobiological activity and physiological condition required for optimum<br>
demonstration of these biologic activities are not disclosed earlier.<br>
Object of invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to disclose the chemical nature of active principal<br>
responsible for immunobiological activity of the neem leaf preparation.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for isolating glycoprotein from<br>
neem leaf and its characterization to define immunomodulatory and cancer preventive<br>
functions of this glycoprotein.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is for the extraction of this active ingredient and<br>
conditions required for its maximum biological activity, which may have use as a<br>
medicine to prevent cancerous growth.<br>
Summary of invention:<br>
The invention provides that a glycoprotein component present in neem leaf is responsible<br>
for the restriction of tumor growth after prior vaccination. This glycoprotein mediates its<br>
action through immunomodulation of the host's physiological system. Optimum<br>
biological activity is obtained upon exposure of this glycoprotein into a buffered solution<br>
with pH 7.4at a temperature 56°C.<br>
Unique immunomodulatory functions of aqueous preparation of neem leaf (NLP) in<br>
relation to|cancer are disclosed. In an objective to find out the active principle present in<br>
NLP a glycoprotein was detected in NLP, designated as neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP).<br>
NLGP appeafed in nondenatured PAGE as a single band, whereas, three bands in SDS-<br>
PAGE. This glycoprotein constitutes the carbohydrate moiety of about 33%, consisting of<br>
arabinose, galactose and glucose. Protein moiety of the glycoprotein consists of sixteen<br><br>
amino acids, except arginin. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the protein like<br>
structure of the NLP constituents. Immunogenecity of this protein was defined by strong<br>
reaction of the anti-NLP sera with NLP by ELISA and immunoblot analysis. To<br>
understand the association of the NLGP with tumor growth restriction, it was exposed to<br>
a gradient of temperature (0°C, 37°C, 56°C and 100°C), pH (5.7, 6.2, 7.4 and 8.2),<br>
enzymes (trypsin, papain and neuraminidase) and ions (phosphate, tris etc.). Exposure of<br>
NLP to the condition not favorable to maintain the protein conformation caused<br>
significant reduction or abolition of the tumor growth restricting function of NLP. Such<br>
exposure also caused diminished immune reactivity of NLP. Overall results demonstrated<br>
the immense potential of newly identified, NLGP, present in NLP as an<br>
immunoprophylactic agent for tumor growth restriction in a clinical setup.<br>

a) Methods involved in the invention.<br>
Neem Leaf Preparation (NLP)<br>
Matured neem leaves of same size and color (indicative of same age), procured<br>
from a standard source were shed-dried to pulverize. Neem powder was soaked overnight<br>
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 just one day, before the experiment.<br>
Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm and was membrane (0.22 µm)<br>
filtered for in vivo or in vitro uses. Extraction condition was changed in studies for<br>
characterization of the active component. Crude NLP was then extensively dialyzed<br>
against PBS, pH 7.4 and concentrated by Centricon Membrane Filter (Millipore<br>
Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) with 10 Kda molecular weight cut off. Endotoxin<br>
content of the freshly prepared NLP was determined by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate<br>
(LAL) test as per manufacturer's (Salesworth India, Bangalore) instruction. The<br>
endotoxin content of all the batches of NLP was found to be less than 6 pg/ml.<br>
Animals and tumor cells<br>
Female Swiss mice (age, 6-8 weeks, body weight, 24-27 gms) were obtained from<br>
Institutional Animal Care and Maintenance Department. Dry pellet diet and water were<br>
given ad libitum. Maintenance and treatment of animals were given according to the<br>
guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee. Ehrlich's<br><br>
carcinoma (EC) was maintained in Swiss mice by intraperitoneal passage of viable tumor<br>
cells (1 X 107), as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. These EC cells were<br>
used for in vivo tumor development.<br>
Protein estimation<br>
Protein concentration of NLP was measured by Lowry's method using Folin<br>
Phenol reagent (Lowry et al, 1951) and by UV absorption. For these two methods of<br>
protein estimation, optical density was measured at 660 nm and 280 nm respectively.<br>
Analysis of carbohydrate moiety<br>
Amount of carbohydrate moiety in protein, present in NLP was estimated using<br>
phenol- sulphuric acid method (Dubois et al, 1956). In brief, 80% phenol (lOOul) was<br>
mixed with NLP (1 ml) and then concentrated sulphuric acid (1 ml) was added slowly.<br>
After 10 mins, absorbance was measured at 490 nm using microplate reader (Tecan<br>
Spectra, Grodig, Austria).<br>
Analysis of sugar moiety by GLC-MS<br>
NLP was hydrolysed with 2M Trifluroacetic acid for 3 hrs at 100°C in a boiling water<br>
bath (Ghosh et al, 2005; Ghosh et al, 2005). Myo-inositol was used as internal standard.<br>
Hydrolytic losses were accounted for by using standard sugar mixtures containing all the<br>
sugars usually present in the cell wall of a plant. After acid hydrolysis, the solution was<br>
neutralized with 25% ammonia solution (0.7 ml) and the monosaccharides were reduced<br>
with 0.1 ml sodium borohydride in 3M ammonia solution at room temperature for one hr.<br>
the excess borohydride after reduction was decomposed by addition with acetic acid.<br>
Ultimately, the free alditols were obtained as a mixture in dried condition by lyophilizing<br>
the above solution. Acetylation of dried sample was first carried out by acetic anhydride<br>
and L-Methylimidazole as catalyst (Blakeney et al, 1983). Derived alditol acetates were<br>
then analyzed and identified by GLC-MS. GLC-MS was carried on a Shimadzu GC-MS<br>
(QP-5050) instrument (Shimadzu, Japan) with a Flame ionization Detector and DB-225<br>
(JW) column using helium as carrier gas. The temperature of the injection port was<br>
250°C and the column oven temperature was maintained at 210°C (isothermal).<br>
Polyacrylamide gel electroporesis (PAGE)<br>
Crude and dialyzed NLP, after concentration by membrane filtration, were<br>
analyzed by native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE with different acrylamide concentrations.<br>
Molecular weight marker (SC-2035; Santacruz, USA) was electrophorsed in each time to<br>
know the molecular weights of protein bands. In some cases, NLP was exposed to<br>
different temperature and pH before electrophoretic analysis.<br>
Antibody production and ELISA<br>
Swiss mice (n=6) were injected with NLP (extract obtained from 0.25mg of dry<br>
neem powder) weekly for 4 weeks in total. Blood was collected after completion of the<br><br>
fourth injection from anaesthesized mice by retro-orbital puncture and serum separated.<br>
Serum antibodies were assessed by ELISA (Baral et al, 2001). Briefly, the microtiter<br>
plates were coated with NLP (10µg/50µl/well) for overnight and blocked with 5% BSA.<br>
Anti-NLP sera (1:50 diluted in 1% BSA) were added in the wells in triplicate and<br>
incubated for 2 hours. The plates were washed with PBS containing Tween-20 and goat<br>
anti-mouse Ig labeled with peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis) was added at a dilution of 1:<br>
1000. Color was developed with TMB substrate solution (OptEIA™, BD-Pharmingen).<br>
Reaction was stopped with 2N H2SO4 solution and absorbance was measured at 450 nm<br>
using microplate reader (Tecan Spectra, Grodig, Austria).<br>
Immunoblotting<br>
NLP was electrophorsed on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred on nitrocellulose<br>
membrane, blocked with POD blocking substrate (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,<br>
Germany) and incubated with anti-NLP sera, before and after absorption with NLP, for<br>
overnight at 4°C. After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase<br>
conjugated secondary antibody for two hours at room temperature. Bands were detected<br>
using chemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the<br>
manufacturer's manual.<br>
Absorption of immune sera with NLP<br>
NLP generated immune sera was absorbed with NLP (5 µg/ml of 1:50 diluted<br>
sera) for 1 hr at 37°C and centrifuged at 5000g for 10 mins. Absorbed sera were then<br>
tested by ELISA and immunoblotting for their reactivity.<br>
Scanning electron microscopy<br>
Structural morphology of protein fraction present in NLP was studied using<br>
Scanning Electron Microscope (Chavan et al, 2001). Freeze dried neem protein was<br>
mounted on circular aluminium stubs with double sticky tape and coated with 20 nm gold<br>
using I-B2 Ion coater. The sample was examined and photographed in a scanning<br>
electron microscope (Hitachi S-530 SEM, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).<br>
Amino acid analysis<br>
Amino acid analysis was performed in a PICO.TAG system according to the<br>
PICO.TAG operation manual (Waters, USA). NLP was extensively dialyzed against<br>
deionised water for 24 hrs, dried and the protein (20µg) was hydrolysed by 6N HC1<br>
containing 1% phenol for 24 hrs at 105°C in the PICO.TAG work station. Hydrolysed<br>
sample and standard amino acid mixture, 'Standard S' (0.0005 ml) were taken in<br>
respective'tubes, introduced into the reaction vial and were dried completely. These were<br>
then derivatized by phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) solution (ethanol: triethylamine : water<br>
: PITC = 7:1:1:1 by volume) for 20 min at 25°C (33). The vials were then dried and<br>
samples were reconstituted in diluent solution (Na2HPO4. 0.071%, w/w, pH 7.4<br>
containing acetonitrile 5%, v/v). The samples were analysed at 38°C as per PICO.TAG<br><br>
manual using C18 column (Ghosh et al, 1997). Detector setting, chart speed and run time<br>
were AT 128 at 254 nm, 2 cm/min and 32 min respectively. Amino acids present in<br>
unknown sample (NLP) were determined quantitatively by comparing the peak areas<br>
(745b data module print out) of amino acids present in 'Standard S'.<br>
Exposure of NLP in different temperature, pH and enzymes<br>
Crude and dialyzed NLP were exposed to different temperatures (100°C for 5<br>
mins, 56°C, 37°C and 0°C for 1h) and phosphate buffers with pH 5.7, 6.2, 7.4 and 8.0 for<br>
overnight. NLP was also digested with proteolytic enzymes, like, trypsin (SRL) (20<br>
µg/mg NLP), papain (SRL) (50 µg/mg NLP) and neuraminidase (Sigma) (0.6 U with 2<br>
mM PMSF/mg of NLP) for one hour at 37 C. Trypsin and papain were inactivated by<br>
rapid chilling and neuraminidase was removed by centrifugation.<br>
Exposure of NLP to various ions<br>
NLP was prepared by soaking neem leaf powder into water with pH 6.0 and pH<br>
7.4, PBS, pH 7.4, Tris buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, 10mM disodium hydrogen<br>
phosphate solution, 1.4mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution individually.<br>
Except variation in the ions, other conditions were identical, as described in the section,<br>
'Neem Leaf Preparation'.<br>
Tumor growth restriction assay<br>
Swiss mice were injected with NLP either exposed to various temperatures, pH<br>
or digested with different enzymes or soaked with solutions containing various ions.<br>
Extracts obtained from 0.25 mg of neem powder were used for treatment of each week<br>
and NLP treatment was given for 4 weeks in total. After completion of the treatment,<br>
each mouse was inoculated with EC cells (1X107) subcutaneously on right hind leg<br>
quarter. Growth of solid tumor (in mm3) was monitored weekly by caliper measurement<br>
using the formula: (width2 x length)/2. Survival of mice was monitored regularly, till<br>
tumor size reached to 25 mm in either direction.<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
All results from in vivo experiments represent the average of two separate<br>
experiments involving eight mice in each group. Statistical significance was established<br>
by using INST AT 3 Software.<br><br>
Features of the invention<br>
NLP contains protein<br>
Protein estimation suggests the presence of protein in NLP<br>
NLP is soaked in PBS, pH 7.4 for overnight, extract was collected and dialyzed<br>
extensively against PBS. Protein concentration of the dialyzed NLP was measured by Lowry's<br>
method using Folin's Phenol reagent. Determination of the optical density confirms the presence<br>
of protein and quantitative estimation of NLP revealed the presence of protein and yield of it is<br>
1.4 µg/mg of dry neem leaf (Table 1).<br><br><br><br>
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identifies proteins in NLP<br>
Dialyzed NLP was analyzed by 12% nondenatured PAGE and 20% denatured SDS-<br>
PAGE. Nondenatured PAGE and SDS-PAGE demonstrated one and three major protein bands<br>
respectively (Fig. 1). Molecular weight of three bands appeared in 20% SDS-PAGE was 65Kda,<br>
36Kda and 22Kda.<br>
Identified NLP protein is a glycoprotein<br>
Biochemical estimation reveals the presence of 33.3% carbohydrate in the protein<br>
present in NLP, thus, may be glycoprotein. After dialysis, concentration of this<br>
glycoprotein was increased significantly (Table 2). Carbohydrate moiety in NLP was<br>
analyzed by GLC-MS and results suggest the presence of 53% arabinose, 36% galactose<br>
and 11% glucose (Fig. 2). Henceforth, the protein present in NLP will be termed as neem<br>
leaf glycoprotein (NLGP).<br>
NLGP consists of various amino acids, except arginin<br>
Amino acid analysis of protein part of the NLP revealed the presence of sixteen<br>
amino acids of which eight were essential. This protein is rich in Glutamic acid, Glycine,<br>
Threonine and Valine but low in Methionine, Cysteine and Histidine. Arginine is not<br>
present in NLGP. Result of amino acid analysis of NLGP is presented in Table 3.<br>
Electron microscopy identifies protein structure<br>
Fig. 3 reveals the structure of NLGP after detection in scanning electron<br>
microscope using different magnifications. SEM micrographs show 3-dimensional<br>
structures through 2-dimensional images. The image demonstrates the heterogeneous<br>
surface with void spaces of NLGP.<br>
NLGP is efficient to generate antibody<br>
Mice were immunized with NLP weekly for four weeks. Blood was collected on<br>
seventh day after last injection to separate the serum. Immune sera were strongly reactive<br>
with NLGP, as detected by ELISA and immunoblotting, demonstrating its nature like a<br><br>
protein antigen (Fig. 4). This reactivity of the immune sera was significantly decreased<br>
after its absorption with NLP.<br>
NLGP of NLP is responsible for tumor growth restriction<br>
Dialysis increases tumor growth restricting activity of NLP<br>
Two groups of Swiss mice were injected with either total NLP or dialyzed NLP<br>
weekly for four weeks. Three days after the last injection both groups of mice were<br>
inoculated with Ehrlich carcinoma cells. Fig. 5 a documented the tumor growth pattern in<br>
dialyzed and nondialyzed NLP injected mice, which clearly shows that dialyzed NLP<br>
gave better protection to the growth of Ehrlich's carcinoma. Mice received dialyzed NLP<br>
before tumor inoculation also survived longer than the group received total NLP (Fig.<br>
5b). Nondialyzed NLP also caused tumor growth restriction in comparison to PBS<br>
control.<br>
Exposure to 56° C increases the tumor growth restricting activity of NLP than<br>
0oC,3rC and 100oC<br>
Four groups of Swiss mice were injected with total NLP exposed to temperatures,<br>
like, 100°C, 56°C, 37°C and 0°C weekly for four weeks in total. Three days after the last<br>
injection mice of all groups were inoculated with Ehrlich carcinoma cells. Minimum<br>
tumor growth was demonstrated in mice treated with NLP exposed to 56°C, than those<br>
mice immunized with NLP exposed to 0°C, 37°C and 100°C (Fig. 6). Identical experiment<br>
was performed with dialyzed NLP, and almost similar result was obtained (data not<br>
shown).<br>
pH of extracting buffer influences tumor growth restricting activity of NLP<br>
Four groups of Swiss mice were injected with total NLP soaked in phosphate<br>
buffer with different pH, like, pH 5.7, 6.2, 7.4 and 8.2 weekly for four weeks. Three days<br>
after the last injection mice of all groups were inoculated with Ehrlich carcinoma cells.<br>
Maximum tumor growth was observed in mice injected with NLP prepared with pH 5.7<br>
buffer and significant tumor growth restriction was demonstrated when NLP prepared<br>
with pH 7.4 and pH 6.2 buffers. Moderate tumor growth restriction was observed during<br>
injection with NLP, pH 8.0 (Fig. 7). Identical experiment was performed with dialyzed<br>
NLP, demonstrated almost similar result (data not shown).<br>
Exposure of NLP to proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, papain and neuraminidase abolishes<br>
tumor growth restricting activity<br>
Four groups of Swiss mice were injected with either total NLP or NLP digested<br>
with trypsin, papain and neuraminidase weekly for four weeks. Three days after the last<br>
injection mice of all groups were inoculated with Ehrlich carcinoma cells. No significant<br>
restriction of the tumor growth was noticed when NLP was exposed to all three enzymes,<br>
in comparison to mice injected With NLP only (Fig. 8). Similar experiment was<br><br>
performed with dialyzed NLP and also demonstrated abolition of the tumor growth<br>
restricting activity of NLP (data not shown).<br>
Antibody against NLP reacts differentially with NLP exposed to different temperatures,<br>
pH and enzymes<br>
Swiss mice were injected with NLP weekly for four weeks. Immune sera obtained after<br>
fourth injection were reacted with NLP before and after exposure to various<br>
temperatures, pH, enzymes or soaked with solutions containing various ions by ELISA<br>
(Fig. 9a). Maximum immune reactivity was noticed with those treated NLP, showed<br>
significant tumor protection. For example, injection with NLP exposed to 56°C<br>
demonstrated maximum tumor protection (Fig. 6) and this NLP reacted maximally with<br>
anti-NLP sera. Differentially treated NLPs were electrophorsed and partial degradation of<br>
the NLP was detected, in those cases where minimum tumor protection was observed<br>
(Fig. 9b).<br><br>
