In the stage (I) for producing a solid product, polycarboxylic acid ester is used in an amount of about 0.01-5 mol, preferably about 0.1-1 mol based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound in the solution of magnesium compound (A'), the solution of titanium compound (B) is used in an amount of 0.1 - 1000 mol, preferably 1 - 200 mol in terms of the titanium compound in the component (B) based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound in the solution of magnesium compound (A1).  The electron donor (C) is used in an amount of about 0.01 - 5 mol, preferably about 0.0 5 - 2 mol based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound in the solution of magnesium compound (A').<br>
In the stage (II) for producing the solid titanium catalyst component, the solution of titanium compound (B1) is used in an amount of 0.1 - 1000 mol, preferably 1 - 200 mol in terms of the titanium compound in the component (B)<br>
based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound in the solid product.<br>
The temperature in contacting each component as stated above generally ranges from -70°C to 200°C, preferably from -30°C to 150°C.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component thus obtained contains titanium, magnesium, a halogen and polycarboxylic acid ester.<br>

Further, the titanium component mixture liquid may be obtained by distilling the solution containing titanium compound which has not been supported on the solid product<br>
in the step of contacting the solution of magnesium compound with the solution of titanium compound and/or the solution containing titanium compound which has not been supported the solid titanium catalyst component in the step of contacting the solid product with the solution of titanium compound so as to have the aforesaid composition, and consequently the recycle of titanium compound and the cost saving can be realized.<br>

EXAMPLE<br>
The present invention is illustrated below with reference to examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
In the examples, the composition of titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid was determined by measuring the hydrocarbon separated by using a device shown in Fig. 2<br>
by gas chromatography.  To calculate the purity of the titanium tetrachloride, the weight of the titanium tetrachloride was found by decreasing the weight of hydrocarbon from the weight of the titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid.  Fig. 2 is a schematic view showing a device used for measuring the composition of titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid, wherein 1 represents a condenser, 2 represents a round flask, 3 represents ice water, 4 represents a coolant circulating pump, 5 represents Peristar pump, and 6 represents a stirrer.<br>
(1)	To a 200-ml dried round flask, about 20 ml of toluene<br>
was charged.<br>
(2)	10 ml of a specimen was pipetted out and charged into the round flask.<br>
(3)	As shown in Fig. 2, the flask was joined with a condenser, and cooled by ice water.<br>
(4)	A coolant circulating pump was turned on to circulate the ice water inside the condenser.<br>
(5)	When the condenser was cooled, Peristar pump was turned on to commence the dropping of a pure water at the rate of 2 ml/min.   (SPEED = x 15, CONTROL = 3-5, POWER = R)<br>
(6)	During the dropping of water, a yellowish brown solid was produced.  In such a situation, a stirring operation was gently carried out with the joint of the flask and the condenser held by hand.  (The stirring operation may be carried out by a stirrer set to the device.)<br>
(7)	While the dropping of water was continued, the solid was dissolved to be a clouded liquid.  When the cloud of the liquid was disappeared, the reaction was completed.<br>
(8)	After the content of the round flask was introduced to a 100-ml separatory funnel A, 10 ml of toluene used for washing the inside of the round flask was also introduced to the separatory funnel A.<br>
(9)	The separatory funnel A was shaken and allowed to stand for separation, and then an aqueous phase was introduced to another separatory funnel B and a toluene phase was introduced to a 50-ml measuring flask.<br>
(10)	10 ml of toluene was charged into the separatory funnel A to wash the inside thereof, and then introduced to the separatory funnel B to be shaken.<br>
(11)	After the separatory funnel B was allowed to stand for separation, a toluene phase was introduced to the 50-ml measuring flask formerly charged with toluene.<br>
(12)	About 0.5 ml of p-xylene was added to the 50-ml measuring flask charged with toluene, and measurement by gas chromatography was conducted under the following conditions.<br>

[Preparation of Solid Titanium Catalyst Component (A-1)]<br>
To a 0.5-m3 reactor were charged 98.5 kg of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol, 78.3 kg of decane and 24 kg of magnesium chloride to give a homogeneous solution at 140°C. Then, 5.6 kg of phthalic anhydride was introduced thereto, and followed by cooling to room temperature to obtain a liquid magnesium compound (m-1).<br>
To a 1-m3 reactor was charged 0.3 m3 of a titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid (1) having the composition shown in Table 1.  After lowering the temperature to -20°C,<br>
103.2 kg of the magnesium compound (m-1) was introduced thereto.  This titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid (1) was obtained by distilling the hydrocarbon containing the<br>
titanium tetrachloride stored in a storage tank (D) which<br><br>
will be described below can parathe lerample 2 on the condition that the bottom<br>
temperature was 67.5°C, the top temperature was 52.0°C, the top pressure was 50 Torr, and the reflux rate was 500.1 kg/hour.<br>
When the introduction was completed, the temperature of the mixture was raised to 110°C, 8.8 kg of<br>
diisobutylphthalate was introduced thereto, and the mixture was kept for 2 hours for reaction.  When the reaction was completed, a liquid phase was extracted and stored in the storage tank (D), and a solid phase was transferred to the filter by pressure of nitrogen gas and filtered.<br>
To the solid obtained by the filtration, a small quantity of titanium tetrachloride was added, and the mixture was fed into a 1-m3 reactor by pressure to obtain 0.4 m3 of the titanium tetrachroride mixture liquid (1) having the composition shown in Table 1.<br>
In the above, the filer was kept at 100°C, and the pressure-feeding line which connects the filter with the 1-m3 reactor was kept at 90°C.<br>
The inside temperature of the 1-m3 reactor was raised to 110°C, and kept for 20 minutes.  A liquid phase was fed to the filter by pressure in the same manner as described above, and filtered.  The solid obtained by the filtration<br>
was fed into the 1-m3 reactor by pressure, washed three times with 0.4 m3 of hexane of 60°C, and then washed thoroughly with hexane of room temperature until no titanium was detected in the supernatant liquid.<br>
The thus obtained solid was dried with a paddle dryer to obtain a solid titanium catalyst component (A-1) having the composition shown in Table 2.<br>
[Polymerization]<br>
To a 2-liter autoclave was charged 750 ml of purified n-hexane, and then were charged 0.75 mmol of triethyl aluminium, 0.075 mmol of cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane and 0.0075 mmol of Ti in terms of the titanium atom, in the solid titanium catalyst component (A-1) at 40°C and in a propylene atmosphere.<br>
Further 200 ml of hydrogen was introduced at 60°C thereto, and the temperature of the system was raised to 70°C and the system was kept for 2 hours to proceed propylene polymerization.  During the polymerization, the pressure was kept at 7 kg/cm2-G.<br>
When the polymerization was completed, the slurry containing a solid product was filtered to separate into white powder and a liquid phase.  The white powder was dried under reduced pressure for 10 hours, and then the weight and the properties were measured.  A production quantity of polymer soluble in a solvent (n-hexane) was<br>
calculated by condensing a part of the liquid phase.  The results were shown in Table 3.<br>
