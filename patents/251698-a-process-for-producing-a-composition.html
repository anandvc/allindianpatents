				<td>IMPROVED PROCESSING COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF<br>
FORMING THE SAME<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Application Serial<br>
No. 10/740,346, filed December 18, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a process composition (concentrated and diluted forms)<br>
and a method (i.e., process) for forming the same. The inventive process composition<br>
(concentrated and diluted forms) is useful in forming a treatment composition that is capable of<br>
forming essentially transparent, detachable and renewable protective coatings on a receptive<br>
surface by a process of applying to the receptive surface a treatment composition comprising a<br>
plurality of hydrophobic particles colloidally dispersed in a volatile solvent; allowing the volatile<br>
solvent to evaporate; and thereby depositing a coating on the receptive surface that provides dirt-<br>
and water-repellent properties, self-cleaning and easier next time cleaning benefits.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art <br>
[0003] The principle of self-cleaning coatings is well-known in the literature. The effect<br>
generally requires two essential features: one being a hydrophobic surface or hydrophobic<br>
coating on a surface; and the second being some degree of surface roughness which combine to<br>
produce a structured "superhydrophobic" surface, exhibiting high water contact angles that act to<br>
readily repel water and shed adherent particulate soils with even small amounts of water alone,<br>
without requiring the use of typical cleaning agents.<br>
[0004] The use of hydrophobic materials, such as perfluorinated polymers, to produce<br><br><br>
hydrophobic surfaces is known. A further development of these surfaces consists in structuring<br>
the surfaces in the µm to nm range. U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,489 discloses a process in which a<br>
surface can be rendered particularly repellent by bombardment with particles of appropriate size,<br>
followed by perfluorination.<br>
[0005] A suitable combination of structure and hydrophobic properties permits even small<br>
amounts of water moving on the surface to entrain adherent dirt particles and clean the surface<br>
(see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,363; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,354,022).<br>
[0006] The prior art of EP-B-0 933 388 requires an aspect ratio &gt;l and a surface energy of less<br>
than 20 mN/m for these self-cleaning surfaces; the aspect ratio being defined here as the quotient<br>
which is the ratio of the height of the structure to its width. The abovementioned criteria are<br>
typically found in nature, for example, in the lotus leaf. The surface of the plant is composed of<br>
a hydrophobic waxy material and has elevations separated by a few µm. Water droplets<br>
substantially contact only the peaks of the elevations. There are many descriptions in the<br>
literature of water-repellent surfaces of this type.<br>
[0007] EP-A-0 909 747 teaches a process for generating a self-cleaning surface. The surface has<br>
hydrophobic elevations whose height is from 5 to 200 µm. A surface of this type is produced by<br>
applying a dispersion of pulverulent particles and of an inert material in a siloxane solution and<br>
then curing. The structure-forming particles are therefore secured to the surface by way of an<br>
auxiliary medium. <br>
[0008] U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0136217A1 concludes that it is technically possible to render the<br>
surfaces of articles artificially self-cleaning. The surface structures necessary for this purpose,<br>
which are composed of elevations and depressions, have a separation in the range from 0.1 to<br>
200 µm between the elevations of the surface structures, and have an elevation height in the<br>
range from 0.1 to 100 µm. The materials used for this purpose are composed of hydrophobic<br><br><br>
polymers or of lastingly hydrophobized material. Release of the particles from the carrier matrix<br>
has to be prevented.<br>
[0009] This principle has been borrowed from nature. Small contact surfaces lower the level of<br>
van der Waals interaction responsible for adhesion to flat surfaces with low surface energy. For<br>
example, the leaves of the lotus plant have elevations composed of a wax, and these reduce the<br>
area of contact with water.<br>
[0010] Processes for producing these structured surfaces are likewise known. Besides the use of<br>
a master template to mold these structures in fill-in detail by an injection molding or embossing<br>
processes, there are also known processes that utilize the application of particles to a surface.<br>
This is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,489.<br>
[0011] Recently, attempts have been made to provide self-cleaning surfaces on textiles. It has<br>
been found that self-cleaning surfaces can be generated by applying fine-particle SiO2<br>
(AEROSIL®) to textiles. In this process, the AEROSIL® materials are bonded into the polymer<br>
matrix of the textile fiber, using a solvent that partially dissolves the fiber to effect adhesion<br>
[0012] U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0154106A1 describes polymer fibers with self-cleaning surfaces.<br>
In the prior art disclosure, the self-cleaning surface is obtained by exposure to a solvent, which<br>
comprises structure-forming particles, using the solvent to solvate the surface of the polymer<br>
fibers, adhesion of the structure-forming particles to the solvated surface, and removing the<br>
solvent. The disadvantage of this process is that, during processing of the polymer fibers<br>
(spinning, knitting, etc.), the structure-forming particles, and therefore the structure that renders<br>
the surface self-cleaning, can become damaged or sometimes lost entirely, the result being that<br>
the self-cleaning effect is also lost.<br>
[0013] U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0103457A1 describes textile sheets with a self-cleaning and<br>
water-repellent surface composed of at least one synthetic and/or natural textile base material A,<br><br><br>
and of an artificial, at least to some extent, hydrophobic surface with elevations and depressions<br>
composed of particles that have been securely bonded to the base material A, without adhesives,<br>
resins, or coatings. The hydrophobic surfaces are obtained by treating the base material A with<br>
at least one solvent that comprises the undissolved particles, and removing the solvent,<br>
whereupon at least some of the particles become securely bonded to the surface of the base<br>
material A. However, the disadvantage of this prior art process is the very complicated finishing<br>
of the textile surfaces. Moreover, this prior art process requires precise matching of the solvent<br>
to the base material of the textiles. However, in clothing there are generally mixed fabrics<br>
present, and this matching therefore becomes more complicated. If the matching of the solvents<br>
is not precise, the result can be irreparable damage to parts of the clothing. The textile surfaces<br>
therefore have to be treated prior to tailoring.<br>
[0014] U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,354 describes substrates with a self-cleaning surface and a process<br>
for a permanent coating of the substrates providing the self-cleaning properties. The process<br>
includes the following steps: (1) coating of the surface with a composition containing structure<br>
forming particles and a layer forming material; (2) forming a cohesive layer that fixes the<br>
structure forming particles firmly to the surface, and then; (3) hydrophobizing the structured<br>
surface with a hydrophobizing agent which adheres firmly to the structured surface. The<br>
structure forming particles preferably have an average diameter of less than 100 nm, more<br>
preferably in the range between 5 and 50 nm. In an example, a float glass with a transparent<br>
self-cleaning surface was produced by coating the glass with a composition by means of a screen<br>
printing process using a 100 T screen. The composition included 0.5 wt.% boric acid and 4 wt.%<br>
pyrogenic silica with an average diameter of the primary particles of 12 nm in a water friendly<br>
medium. After drying, the coating was shock fired at 660°C for a duration of 4 min. The<br>
hydrophobization of the structured surface was carried out by introducing an ethanolic solution<br>
of tridecafluorooctyltriethoxysilane over the surface and curing at an elevated temperature. The<br>
disadvantages of the described method is its multiple-step nature and the requirement of a high<br><br><br>
temperature process. In addition, it results in a permanent coating which cannot be easily<br>
detached by a simple cleaning procedure.<br>
[0015] All of these coatings are characterized in that they are intended to be applied permanently<br>
to the articles, and thus have the disadvantage that they cannot be simply removed and reapplied<br>
in the event of impairment by scratching, discoloration or any other damage to the coating,<br>
surface or coated surface structure. If this type of damage occurs, the article either has to be<br>
freed from the surface structure by a complicated method and retreated, or has to be disposed of,<br>
if its appearance is no longer acceptable.<br>
[0016] U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0136217A1 describes a process for producing detachable<br>
coatings with dirt- and water-repellent properties. These coatings of the prior art are produced<br>
by spray-application of hydrophobic alcohols, such as nonacosan-10-ol, or of alkanediols, such<br>
as nonacosane-5,10-diol, or of waxes. The coatings of U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0136217A1 can<br>
be removed from articles by strong mechanical forces, e.g., scratching, brushing, or high-<br>
pressure water treatment, or by treatment with water which comprises detergents that disperse<br>
some of the structure-formers. A disadvantage of the prior art coatings disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br>
Pub. No. 2005/0136217A1 is the strong forces needed for mechanical removal of the coating.<br>
The use of strong forces for the mechanical removal of the coating runs the risk that when the<br>
coating is removed the surface of the article itself will also be damaged. Treatment with water<br>
that comprises detergents can likewise lead to damage to the article, depending on its nature.<br>
[0017] U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0213904 describes a process for producing detachable dirt- and<br>
water-repellent surface coatings on articles, wherein during the coating process, hydrophobic<br>
particles are applied to the surface of the articles, thus generating a structure with elevations on<br>
the surface of the articles that has dirt- and water-repellent properties, which comprises<br>
suspending the hydrophobic particles in a solution of an alkyl-modified silicone wax in a highly<br>
volatile siloxane, applying this suspension to at least one surface of an article, and then removing<br><br><br>
the highly volatile siloxane. In this prior document, examples of compositions for producing<br>
those surface coatings are given and procedures how they are made are also provided. The<br>
compositions are dispersions of fumed silica particles present at 1 to 2 wt.% of the total weight<br>
of the dispersion in a solution of an alkyl-modified silicone wax present at 0.5 wt.% in<br>
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane. These compositions are produced by dissolving the alkyl-<br>
modified silicone wax in decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and then dispersing the fumed silica in<br>
this solution with vigorous stirring. Although the process for producing detachable dirt- and<br>
water-repellent surface coatings provided in the aforementioned application proved to provide<br>
better results with respect to run-off behavior of water droplets and gloss values on various<br>
surfaces compared to processes known from the prior state of the art, it still has some<br>
disadvantages. Especially on high gloss surfaces such as glass, brushed metal and varnished or<br>
painted surfaces, the coating is easily perceptible as a grayish or hazy layer by the naked eye,<br>
which is not acceptable for many applications.<br>
[0018] The various approaches employed in the prior art are directed to modification of the<br>
targeted surfaces to have sufficient roughness to provide a coating capable of exhibiting the<br>
Lotus effect, and generally produce non-transparent coatings and films that suffer from poor<br>
visual appearance, particularly on glossy, shiny and/or highly reflective surfaces. Further,<br>
approaches that provide protective coatings with improved visual appearances rely on fixatives<br>
to firmly attach and/or embed materials onto the treated surface, accompanied by chemical,<br>
physical and/or thermal processes required to produce them and resulting in permanent and non-<br>
renewable treated articles.<br>
[0019] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process to produce process<br>
compositions (concentrated and diluted forms) to be used in treatment compositions, which can<br>
produce essentially transparent protective surface coatings on a wide variety of materials.<br>
[0020] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process to produce process<br><br><br>
compositions (concentrated and diluted forms) to be used in treatment compositions that can<br>
produce detachable and renewable dirt- and water-repellent surface coatings on a receptive<br>
surface, and which can also treat articles to give a relatively durable coating, which, however,<br>
can be detached using simple means, without requiring any chemical or physical modification or<br>
change to the underlying substrate, which may then be readily restored to its pristine initial state<br>
when desired.<br>
[0021] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process to produce process<br>
compositions (concentrated and diluted forms) to be used in treatment compositions that can<br>
provide receptive surfaces with transparent, detachable and renewable protective surface<br>
coatings on a wide variety of materials and substrates. <br>
[0022] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process to produce process<br>
compositions (concentrated and diluted forms) to be used in treatment compositions which can<br>
provide receptive surfaces with transparent, detachable and renewable protective surface<br>
coatings, which can be easily renewed by removing the coatings by simple means and reapplying<br>
the coatings, on a wide variety of materials and substrates.<br>
[0023] It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a process to produce process<br>
compositions (in concentrated or diluted forms) to be used in treatment compositions which can<br>
provide receptive surfaces with transparent, detachable and renewable protective surface<br>
coatings on a wide variety of materials which thereby exhibit dirt- and water-repellency, self-<br>
cleaning and easier next time cleaning benefits.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0024] It was surprisingly found that detachable and renewable protective coatings which are<br>
substantially transparent can be applied to receptive surfaces by use of a hydrophobically<br>
modified silica particles containing treatment composition, provided said treatment composition<br><br>
has been made by diluting, optionally while adding other functional ingredients, an initial<br>
process composition, which, in turn, has been produced at a high concentration of the silica, in<br>
the presence of an optional, yet preferable, disilazane derivative, and under high shear<br>
conditions. It was further surprisingly found that these protective coatings can exhibit good<br>
durability, even in the absence of conventional durability agents.<br>
[0025] In accordance with the aforementioned surprising finding and the above objects and those<br>
that will be mentioned and will become apparent below, one aspect of the present invention is a<br>

in from 10 percent to about 30 percent by weight of the total weight of the pre-dispersion, and<br>
wherein the concentration of any one of compounds (I) and/or (II) is between 0.1 and 10 percent<br>
by weight of the total weight of the pre-dispersion; and<br>

(b) wherein a second volatile solvent or solvent mixture, which is the same or different solvent or<br>
solvent mixture as the first volatile solvent or solvent mixture, is used as the diluent to provide a<br>
final concentration of the hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles of minimum 5 % by<br>
weight of the total process composition. The dilution may also occur using durability agents or a<br>
combination of durability agents and the second volatile solvent or solvent mixture.<br>
[0028] In accordance with the above objects and those that will be mentioned and will become<br>
apparent below, one aspect of the present invention is a process composition that comprises:<br><br>
5 to 30 % by weight of hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles with a<br>
median particle size in the range between 100 and 4000 nm;<br>

[0040] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same<br>
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention<br>
pertains. Although a number of methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described<br>
herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods<br>
are described herein.<br><br><br>
[0041] In the application, effective amounts are generally those amounts listed as the ranges or<br>
levels of ingredients in the descriptions, which follow hereto. Unless otherwise stated, amounts<br>
listed in percentage ("%'s") are in weight percent as indicated as "wt.%", (based on 100 wt.%<br>
active) of the total composition or formulation described.<br>
[0042] As used herein, the term "particle" is intended to include any discrete particle, primary<br>
particle, aggregate and/or aggregated collection of primary particles, agglomerate and/or<br>
agglomerated collection of aggregates, and/or colloidally dispersed particles, aggregates,<br>
agglomerates and/or loose assemblies of particulate materials, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0043] It is noted that particle size determination provides an average of particle sizes, generally<br>
calculated as a median particle size, of a selected distribution obtained by measuring a sample of<br>
material either in the form of an aliquot of a liquid composition, and/or a sample of material in-<br>
situ as present as an applied surface coating on a surface. Measurement techniques to determine<br>
the particle size differ on the nature of the material, providing for some variability in measured<br>
particle size distributions, mean, median and average particle size parameters, and the like.<br>
Measured particle sizes thus typically indicate an average value and distribution of all the various<br>
particulate structures present in the measured system, providing an average particle size whose<br>
value reflects some proportional contribution from all primary, aggregated and/or agglomerated<br>
particulate structures present.<br>
[0044] The median particle size (mass median particle diameter), also referred to as "D50", is the<br>
particle diameter that divides the frequency distribution in half; fifty percent of the mass has<br>
particles with a larger diameter, and fifty percent of the mass has particles with a smaller<br>
diameter. According to this definition, the median particles size as such does not specify<br>
whether the particle size distribution curve is monomodal, biomodal or multimodal.<br>
[0045] "Specific surface area" means the surface area per unit weight of a particulate solid, e.g.<br><br><br>
as determined by the B.E.T. (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) method.<br>
[0046] As stated above, one aspect of the present invention relates to a process composition and<br>
a method (i.e., process) of forming the same. The process composition of the present invention<br>
which, may or may not be in a diluted form, can be formulated into a treatment composition that<br>
forms a detachable and renewable protective coating on a respective surface which provides<br>
water and dirt repellency. In accordance with the present invention, the detachable coating is<br>
substantially transparent and results in a change of less than 3.0 Delta E units to the respective<br>
surface measured before and after deposition of the coating. It is noted that the diluted process<br>
composition provides a dispersion that is flowable and pumpable that is more desirable in some<br>
applications than the undiluted process composition of the present invention.<br>
[0047] The process composition of the present invention includes from 5 to 30 %, preferably 5 to<br>
25 %, even more preferably 5 to 15 %, and most preferably 5 to 10 % by weight of<br>
hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles (to be described in greater detail hereinbelow)<br>
with a median particle size in the range between 100 and 4000 nm, preferably between 100 to<br>
3000 nm, and even more preferably between 100 to 1000 nm. The process composition of the<br>
present invention also includes from 50 to 95 %, preferably from 75 to 95 %, and even more<br>
preferably from 90 to 95 %, by weight of a volatile solvent or solvent mixture (to be described in<br>
greater detail herein below). The volatile solvent or solvent mixture present in the process<br>
composition of the present invention has been added during the formation of the pre-dispersion<br>
(e.g., a first volatile solvent or solvent mixture) and partly may have been added after formation<br>
of the process composition as a diluent (e.g., a second volatile solvent or solvent mixture). Of<br>
the various volatile solvents or solvent mixtures which are mentioned hereinbelow, it is preferred<br>
in one embodiment that the volatile solvent or solvent mixture comprises a linear<br>
polydimethylsiloxane with 2 to 10 dimethylsiloxy units. In yet another embodiment, it is<br>
preferred that the volatile solvent or solvent mixture within the inventive process composition<br><br>
comprises a cyclic polydimethylsiloxane with 3 to 6 dimethylsiloxy units. One highly preferred<br>
volatile solvent that is present in the inventive process composition is<br>
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane.<br>
[0048] In some embodiments of the present invention, the process composition may optionally<br>
include from 0.01 to 10 %, preferably from 0.01 to 5%, and even more preferably from 0.01	to 1<br>
%, by weight of a compound of general formulas (I) or (II)<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 can be the same or different, and are independently selected from<br>
hydrogen, straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain groups of from 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, optionally substituted with fluorine atoms, or aromatic groups of from 6 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms, optionally substituted with fluorine atoms, R4 is hydrogen or a methyl group, and m is<br>
from 3 to 8.<br>
[0049] In embodiments wherein compounds of formula (I) and (II) are present, it is preferred<br>
that R4 is hydrogen, R1 and R2 are methyl, and R3 is hydrogen, straight or branched, saturated or<br>
unsaturated alkyl chain groups of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with fluorine<br>
atoms, aromatic groups of from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with fluorine atoms,<br>
R is a hydrogen or a methyl group, and m is from 3 to 8. More preferably, and when<br>
compounds of formula (I) and (II) are present in the inventive process composition, R4 is<br>
hydrogen, R1 and R2 are methyl, and R3 is independently hydrogen or methyl. Even more<br>
preferably, compounds of formula (I) and (II) in which R4 is hydrogen, R1, R2, and R3 are methyl<br>
can optionally be present.<br><br>
[0050] In yet another embodiment of the present invention, an optional durability agent (to be<br>
described in greater detail hereinbelow) can also be present in the process composition of the<br>
present invention. It is noted that although the present invention contemplates the use of a<br>
durability agent, the applicants of the present application have surprisingly discovered that the<br>
durability of protective coatings obtained using treatment compositions derived from the<br>
inventive process compositions (diluted or undiluted) which contain a disilazane derivative is<br>
substantially no different than compositions of the prior art that include a durability agent. It is<br>
noted that when a durability agent is used it may be added during the initial stage of providing a<br>
pre-dispersion or after mixing. When present, the durability agent is present in the inventive<br>
process composition in a concentration from 0.01 to 10 % by weight, more preferably from 0.01<br>
to 5 % by weight, and even more preferably from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total<br>
process composition.<br>
[0051] The inventive process composition described hereinabove is formed by first providing a<br>
pre-dispersion of silica particles comprising hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles by<br>
stirring the silica particles into a solution comprising<br>
(i) optionally at least one compound of general formula (I) or (II):<br><br>
wherein R1,R2,R3,R4 and m are as defined herein above, and<br>
(ii) a first volatile solvent or solvent mixture selected from straight or branched, linear or<br>
cyclic aliphatic, or aromatic hydrocarbons with 2 to 14 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with<br>
fluorine or chlorine atoms, monovalent linear or branched alcohols with 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
ketones or aldehydes with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, ethers or esters with 2 to 8 carbon atoms, or<br><br><br>
linear or cyclic polydimethylsiloxanes with 2 to 10 dimethylsiloxy units, wherein the<br>
concentration of the hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles in the pre-dispersion results<br>
in from 10 percent to about 30 percent by weight of the total weight of the pre-dispersion. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, and when compounds of formula (I) and (II) are used, the<br>
concentration of any one of compounds (I) and/or (II) is between 0.1 and 10 percent, preferably<br>
between 0.1 to 5 percent, and even more preferably between 0.1 to about 3 percent, by weight of<br>
the total weight of the pre-dispersion. An optional durability agent can also be used in providing<br>
the pre-dispersion. The amounts of the silica particles, optional disilazane derivatives, first<br>
volatile solvent or solvent mixture, and optional durability agent are within ranges that provide<br>
the above stated amounts of each component within the final process composition. Stirring is<br>
achieved at this point of the present invention by using conventional stirring equipment that is<br>
well known in the art.<br>
[0052] After providing the pre-dispersion, the pre-dispersion is then mixed with a disperser to<br>
provide the inventive process composition while reducing the silica particles to a median particle<br>
size in the range between 100 and 4000 nm, more preferably between 100 and 3000 nm, and<br>
even more preferably between 100 and 1000 nm. The conditions and disperser used in this step<br>
of the present invention will be described in greater detail hereinbelow.<br>
[0053] The above mentioned steps provide a process composition of the present invention that is<br>
concentrated, i.e., undiluted. Dilution of the inventive process composition can be performed by<br>
adding, with stirring, a second volatile solvent or solvent mixture and/or a durability agent<br>
therein. The second volatile solvent or solvent mixture can comprise the same or different<br>
volatile solvent or solvent mixture than used in forming the pre-dispersion. It is noted that the<br>
section including the description of the volatile solvent provided hereinbelow is intended to<br>
include both the first and second volatile solvents. Dilution of the hydrophobically modified<br>
fumed silica particles containing process composition to a minimum final concentration of 5%<br><br><br>
by weight can be achieved. This provides a process composition that is generally more flowable<br>
and pumpable, i.e., easier processability, than a concentrated form of the inventive process<br>
composition.<br>
Hydrophobically modified silica<br>
[0054] Suitable hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles that may be used in the present<br>
invention include silica particles that have been hydrophobicized by any means known in the art.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the silicon dioxide utilized is a colloidal silicon dioxide.<br>
Colloidal silicon dioxide is a generally fumed silica prepared by a suitable process to reduce the<br>
particle size and modify the surface properties. A common process in the art to modify the<br>
surface properties is to produce fumed silica, for example by production of the silica material<br>
under conditions of a vapor-phase hydrolysis at an elevated temperature with a surface<br>
modifying silicon compound, such as silicon dimethyl dichloride. Such products are<br>
commercially available from a number of sources, including Cabot Corporation, Tuscola, IL<br>
(under the trade name CAB-O-SIL) and Degussa, Inc., Piscataway, NJ (under the trade name<br>
AEROSIL).<br>
[0055] Suitable hydrophobically modified firmed silica particles include, but are not limited to:<br>
those commercially available from Degussa Corporation, Parsippany, NJ, as designated under<br>
the R Series of the AEROSIL® and AEROXIDE® LE trade names. The different AEROSIL® R<br>
and AEROXIDE® LE types differ in the kind of hydrophobic coating, the BET surface area, the<br>
average primary particle size and the carbon content. The hydrophobic properties are a result of<br>
a suitable hydrophobizing treatment, e.g., treatment with at least one compound from the group<br>
of the organosilanes, alkylsilanes, the fluorinated silanes, and/or the disilazanes. Commercially<br>
available examples include AEROSIL® R 202, AEROSIL® R 805, AEROSIL® R 812,<br><br><br>
AEROSIL® R 812 S, AEROSIL® R 972, AEROSIL® R 974, AEROSIL® R 8200, AEROXIDE®<br>
LE-1 and AEROXIDE® LE-2.<br>
[0056] Other silica materials are also suitable when hydrophobically modified by use of<br>
hydrophobizing materials capable of rendering the surfaces of the silica particles suitably<br>
hydrophobic. The suitable hydrophobizing materials include all those common in the art that are<br>
compatible for use with the silica materials to render their surfaces suitably hydrophobic.<br>
Suitable examples, include, but are not limited to: the organosilanes, alkylsilanes, the fluorinated<br>
silanes, and/or the disilazanes. Suitable organosilanes include, but are not limited to:<br>

e.g., polydimethylsiloxane; arylsilanes including, e.g., substituted and unsubstituted arylsilanes;<br>
alkylsilanes including, e.g., substituted and unsubstituted alkyl silanes including, e. g., methoxy<br>
and hydroxy substituted alkyl silanes; and combinations thereof. Some suitable<br>
alkylchlorosilanes include, for example, methyltrichlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane,<br>
trimethylchlorosilane, octylmethyldichlorosilane, octyltrichlorosilane,<br>
octadecylmethyldichlorosilane and octadecyltrichlorosilane. Other suitable materials include, for<br>
example, methylmethoxysilanes such as methyltrimethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane and<br>
trirnethylmethoxysilane; methylethoxysilanes such as methyltriethoxysilane,<br>

vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinylmethyldimethoxysilane, vinyldimethylmethoxysilane,<br>
vinyltriethoxysilane, vinylmethyldiethoxysilane and vinyldimethylethoxysilane.<br>
[0057] Disilazanes, which can be employed in the present invention as processing aid, are well<br>
known in the art. Suitable disilazanes include for example, but are not limited to:<br>
hexamethyldisilazane, divinyltetramethyldisilazane and bis(3,3-<br>
trifluoropropyl)tetramethyldisilazane. Cyclosilazanes are also suitable, and include, for example,<br>
octamethylcyclotetrasilazane. It is noted that the aforementioned disilazanes and cyclosilazanes<br>
typically have the basic formula (I) and (II) described above. Thus, these disilazanes and<br>
cyclosilazanes can be used as either or both as hydrophobizing material for hydrophobically<br>
modifying fumed silica particles and as a processing aid in forming the pre-dispersion mentioned<br>
supra.<br>
[0058] Suitable fluorinated silanes include the fluorinated alkyl-, alkoxy-, aryl- and/or alkylaryl-<br>
silanes, and fully perfluorinated alkyl-, alkoxy-, aryl- and/or alkylaryl-silanes. Examples of<br>
fluoroalkyl silanes include, but are not limited to: those marketed by Degussa under the trade<br>
name of Dynasylan. An example of a suitable fluorinated alkoxy-silane is perfluorooctyl<br>
trimethoxysilane.<br>
Process Equipment<br>
[0059] Suitable equipment for effectively dispersing the hydrophobically modified fumed silica<br>
particles of the present invention include any kind of device which is capable of applying high<br>
enough shear forces to a concentrated particulate slurry and thus being effective at decreasing the<br>
average particle size distribution of particles within the slurry down to 100 to 4,000 nanometers<br>
where initial particle sizes range from about 1000 to 1,000,000 nanometers can be employed<br>
according to the methods of the present invention. Suitable examples include, but are not limited<br>
to: mixers and/or dispersers based on the rotor stator principle such as the L4RT type available<br><br>
from Silverson Machines, Waterside at Chesham Bucks, England. Further suitable examples are<br>
mixers using dissolver or dispenser blades, such as the CV type available from Dispermat (BYK-<br>
Gardner, Geretsried, Germany), and/or the H-Trieb 4REB/L model available from Heynau<br>
Getriebe, Landshut, Germany. Effective dispersing can also be achieved with a horizontal mill,<br>
one suitable example being the MH2P type from OKK USA Company, Glendale Heights, IL.<br>
Durability Agent<br>
[0060] A durability agent may optionally be included in the process and/or treatment<br>
compositions of the present invention. When included, one possible embodiment is to include<br>
the durability agent during the processing step. Suitable durability agents may be selected from<br>
the group of alkoxysilanes of the general formula (III)<br><br>
wherein R5 is a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain group of from 1 to 16<br>
carbon atoms, optionally substituted with fluorine atoms, hydroxyl, amino, mercapto, or epoxy<br>
groups, R6 is an alkyl chain of 1 to 2 carbon atoms, a is 1 or 2; or selected form the group of<br>

Additional durability agents suitable for use herein include those previously disclosed in U.S.<br><br><br>
Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0213904A1.<br>
[0061] The level of durability agent employed herein is typically between 0.1 and 10 percent by<br>
weight of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Volatile Solvent<br>
[0062] A volatile solvent is employed in the inventive process and/or treatment compositions in<br>
the capacity of a liquid carrier for methods of delivering and effectively applying the treatment<br>
compositions to a receptive surface in a manner capable of forming a functional protective<br>
coating on the surface.<br>
[0063] Suitable volatile solvents are selected from the group of aromatic, branched, cyclic,<br>
and/or linear hydrocarbons with 2 to 14 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with fluorine or<br>

[0064] Additional solvents that may be employed include those organic solvents having some<br>
water solubility and/or water miscibility, and at least some ability to couple with water or<br>
moisture that may be present or become incorporated into the inventive treatment compositions<br>
through processing, packaging and during application. These are generally added in addition to<br><br>
3<br>
the more volatile solvent, although they may be employed alone as well as in any suitable<br>
combination or mixture capable of stabilizing the dispersion of the hydrophobically modified<br>
silica particles during processing, packaging, storage and use.<br>
[0065] Suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to: C1-6 alkanols, C1-6 diols, C1-10<br>

acid, lactic acid and propionic acid. Short chain esters include, but are not limited to: glycol<br>
acetate, and cyclic or linear volatile methylsiloxanes.<br>
[0066] Organic solvents that are less volatile can optionally be included in combination with the<br>
more volatile solvent for the purpose of modifying evaporation rates. Suitable examples of less<br>
volatile organic solvents are those with lower vapor pressures, for example those having a vapor<br>
pressure less than 0.1 mm Hg (20 °C) which include, but are not limited to: dipropylene glycol<br>
n-propyl ether, dipropylene glycol t-butyl ether, dipropylene glycol n-butyl ether, tripropylene<br>
glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol propyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol butyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate,<br><br><br>
and diethylene glycol butyl ether acetate (all available from ARCO Chemical Company).<br>
[0067] The volatile solvent is typically present at a level between 50 to 90 weight percent in the<br>
inventive process composition.<br>
[0068] As stated above the process composition of the present invention can be formulated into a<br>
treatment composition which may comprise, in addition to the inventive process composition,<br>
additional additives including a suspending agent, functional adjunct, and propellant, which are<br>
described in greater detail herein below.<br>
Propellant<br>
[0069] Propellants which may optionally be used in conjunction with the inventive treatment<br>
compositions are those well known and conventional in the art and include, for example, a<br>
hydrocarbon, of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, such as n-propane, n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane,<br>
isopentane, and mixtures thereof; dimethyl ether and blends thereof as well as individual or<br>
mixtures of chloro-, chlorofluoro- and/or fluorohydrocarbons- and/or hydrochlorofluorocarbons<br>
(HCFCs). Useful commercially available compositions include A-70 (Aerosol® compositions<br>
with a vapor pressure of 70 p.s.i.g. available from companies such as Diversified and Aeropress)<br>
and Dymel 152a (1,1-difluoroethane from DuPont). Also suitable as propellants are<br>
compressed gases such as carbon dioxide, compressed air, nitrogen, and possibly dense or<br>
supercritical fluids may also be used, either alone or in combination, and alternatively in<br>
combination with other propellant types.<br>
[0070] In dispensing applications employing a propellant, the inventive treatment composition is<br>
dispensed by activating the actuator nozzle of an aerosol type container onto the area in need of<br>
treatment, and in accordance with the application manner as described herein, the area is treated<br>
when the inventive treatment composition is deposited onto the surface, the propellant normally<br>
dissipating during the dispensing step so that minimal residue of the propellant remains<br><br><br>
associated with the inventive treatment composition as it impinges the surface to be treated. The<br>
nature of the atomization by extremely rapid propellant dissipation is believed to produce<br>
extremely fine droplets of the inventive treatment compositions to aid in producing an even spray<br>
pattern and allow deposition of a uniform and consistent film of the liquid inventive treatment<br>
composition onto the surface, although alternative non-propellant assisted delivery means may<br>
also be suitably employed.<br>
[0071] If a propellant is used, it will generally be in an amount of from about 1 wt.% to about 75<br>
wt.% of the aerosol formulation. Generally, the amount of a particular propellant employed<br>
should provide an internal pressure of from about 20 to about 150 p.s.i.g. at 70°F in order to<br>
provide good atomization and delivery of the inventive treatment compositions.<br>
Suspending Agent<br>
[0072] Suspending agents may optionally be included in the inventive treatment compositions to<br>
improve the suspension and/or dispersion properties of the inventive compositions. Suspending<br>
agents when employed, may function to improve the suspension and dispersion properties of the<br>
hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles, other solid particulate additives, and other<br>
optional agents and functional adjuvants included in the treatment composition. They are<br>
generally employed at levels sufficient for stabilization and so that when present, the level of<br>
usage does not negatively impact the beneficial transparent properties of films provided by use of<br>
the inventive treatment compositions containing them.<br>
[0073] Suitable suspending agents include polymers and surfactants, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0074] Polymer type suspending agents include anionic, cationic and nonionic polymers.<br>

polyethyleneimine.<br>
[0075] Other optional suspending agents include anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and<br>
zwitterionic surfactants. Examples of surfactants that are useful as particle suspending agents,<br>
which can be categorized as acyl derivatives, include long chain amine oxides, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Exemplary suspending agents of this type are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,855.<br>
Additional suitable suspending agents include ethylene glycol esters of fatty acids, preferably<br>
having from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms. Also suitable are the ethylene glycol stearates,<br>
both mono and distearate; alkanol amides of fatty acids, for example, stearic monoethanolamide,<br>
stearic diethanolamide, stearic monoisopropanolamide and stearic monoethanolamide stearate;<br>
long chain acyl derivatives including long chain esters of long chain fatty acids, for example,<br>
stearyl stearate and cetyl palmitate; long chain esters of long chain alkanol amides, for example,<br>
stearamide diethanolamide distearate, stearamide monoethanolamide stearate); and glyceryl<br>
esters, for example, glyceryl distearate, trihydroxystearin, a commercial example of which is<br>
Thixin available from Rheox, Inc. Also suitable are long chain acyl derivatives, ethylene glycol<br>
esters of long chain carboxylic acids, long chain amine oxides, and alkanol amides of long chain<br>
carboxylic acids.<br><br><br>

this family, which are commercially available from Stepan Company (Northfield, III., USA).<br>
[0077] Examples of suitable long chain amine oxides for use as suspending agents include<br>
longer chain alkyl dimethyl amine oxides, for example, stearyl dimethyl amine oxide.<br>
[0078] Other suitable suspending agents include primary amines having a fatty alkyl moiety<br>
having about 12 or more carbon atoms, examples of which include palmitamine or stearamine;<br>
and secondary amines having two fatty alkyl moieties each having at least about 12 carbon<br>
atoms, examples of which include dipalmitoylamine or di(hydrogenated tallow)amine. Still<br>
other suitable suspending agents include di(hydrogenated tallow)phthalic acid amide, and<br>
crosslinked maleic anhydride-methyl vinyl ether copolymer.<br>
[0079] In addition, other polymer and surfactant materials known in the art may also be suitably<br>
employed in the inventive treatment compositions provided that they do not negatively impact<br>
the performance of the protective films when applied to a receptive surface.<br>
[0080] When included, the suspending agent is typically employed at a level of about 0.001 to 5<br>
wt.% of the finished treatment composition, or at a level that does not impact the desirable<br>
beneficial optical properties of the films provided by use of the present invention.<br>
Functional Adjunct<br>
[0081] Treatment compositions, methods and treatment kits of the present invention may<br>
optionally further include one or more functional adjuncts. Functional adjuncts may be<br>
combined with the inventive treatment compositions, combined during processing of the<br>
concentrated process materials or process compositions, or alternatively post added or delivered<br><br><br>
simultaneously during dispensing and application of the inventive treatment compositions<br>
according to the methods and treatment kits described herein.<br>
[0082] Functional adjuncts are optionally included to provide at least one additional beneficial<br>
property, functional and/or corollary benefit, or aesthetic enhancement to the treatment<br>
compositions, or the resultant protective coatings provided by use of the treatments compositions<br>
and/or kits employing them. The functional property can be one that provides enhanced product<br>
properties owing to improved storage stability, and thus incorporating for example, but not<br>
limited to: phase stabilizers, corrosion protection agents, dispersants, and the like, including<br>
combinations thereof for improving treatment composition storage properties when packaged.<br>
Additionally, functional adjuncts that provide enhanced dispensing properties, including, for<br>
example, flow agents, atomization aids, wetting agents, spreading agents, evaporation modifiers,<br>
solvent couplers, drying aids, azeotropic cosolvents, droplet-size modifiers, and the like,<br>
including combinations thereof for improving the step of application wherein the treatment<br>
compositions are dispensed and applied to the targeted surface to provide the inventive<br>
protective properties described herein.<br>
[0083] Further functional adjuncts may be included that provide enhanced protective benefits<br>
and/or corollary benefits to the protective films present on receptive surfaces treated by use of<br>
the inventive treatment compositions. Suitable functional adjuncts providing such enhanced<br>
protective benefits and/or corollary benefits may be selected from ultraviolet light absorbers,<br>
ultraviolet light blockers, free-radical scavengers, fluorescent whitening agents, colorants, dyes,<br>
pigments, photoactive particles, color changing dyes, color fading dyes, bleaching agents,<br>
fixative agents, perfume, fragrance, odor control agents, anti-static agents, and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
[0084] When included, the functional adjunct is typically employed at a level of about 0.001 to 5<br>
wt.% of the finished treatment composition, or at a level that does not impact the desirable<br><br><br>
beneficial optical properties of the films provided by use of the present invention.<br>
Water<br>
[0085] Since the inventive treatment compositions described herein are generally non-aqueous,<br>
water is generally excluded from the composition, and materials employed, including optional<br>
functional adjuncts, are selected which are free of excessive water and/or moisture. The<br>
inventive treatment compositions and methods of application described herein may tolerate some<br>
water, particularly if a coupling solvent, selected from a water miscible, water soluble, and/or<br>
partially water soluble solvent or combination thereof, is employed as an optional functional<br>
adjunct in the treatment composition. If water is present, it may be de-ionized, industrial soft<br>
water, or any suitable grade of water for the particular application.<br>
[0086] For non-aqueous treatment compositions, water is preferably limited to levels of less than<br>
5% by weight or volume, more preferably less than 2% by weight or volume and most preferably<br>
less than 1% by weight or volume. When coupling solvents are employed, water may be present<br>
at significantly higher levels, any level being suitable provided that the level of water and any<br>
necessary coupling agent does not interfere with the ability of the inventive treatment<br>
compositions to form transparent, renewable and durable surface protective coatings on the<br>
receptive surfaces to which they are applied.<br>

elastomer (TPU), thermoplastic rubber vulcanisate (TPV), neoprene, vinyl, silicone elastomer,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
Methods of Use<br>
[0098] Treatment compositions of the present invention are generally applied in a manner so as<br>
to deposit fine droplets of the liquid composition comprising the colloidally dispersed<br>
hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles in a volatile solvent as a continuous coating<br>
upon a receptive surface such that the droplets completely cover the surface to effectively merge<br>
to form a thin continuous liquid film upon initial deposition. This first manner of application is<br>
generally preferred for a single treatment application. Alternatively, the liquid treatment<br>
compositions can be applied in a manner to uniformly coat the area of the surface to a nearly<br>
complete extent as an array of fine droplets arranged in high density, but finely separated so as<br>
not to form a continuous liquid film. In this latter method of application, depending on the<br>
degree of surface protection desired, a single application, or multiple repeated applications of the<br>
inventive treatment compositions can be applied to produce the desired level of surface coverage.<br>
[0099] Following this application step of applying the liquid treatment composition to the<br>
surface, the volatile solvent is left to evaporate in the second step of the process, effectively<br>
leaving a deposited film of particles in the form of silica particle agglomerates than is essentially<br><br><br>
transparent. The evaporation of the volatile solvent results in a thin, macroscopically uniform<br>
and essentially transparent film on the receptive surface that is detachable and renewable, and<br>
exhibits excellent dirt-repellency, and also water-repellency owing to high water contact angles<br>
sufficient to effect beading water incident on the surface so that the deposited film exhibits<br>
provides soil- and water-repellency, and the ability of the soiled surface to be self-cleaning, and<br>
readily cleanable with only the application of water.<br>
[00100] Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the evaporation of the volatile<br>
solvent of the present invention provides for some relative ordering and separation of the<br>
particles across the area of the treated surface following application, without significant<br>
clumping or association between the particles and/or agglomerates, which likely results in a<br>
mono-layer of deposited particles having favorable optical properties owing to the absence of<br>
significant scattering centers due to otherwise unfavorable clustering of agglomerates. Thus,<br>
treatment compositions of the present invention tend to form essentially transparent films on the<br>
treated surfaces that are nearly invisible to the human eye, even when applied to particularly<br>
glossy or highly reflective surfaces where surface defects or other coatings in the art are readily<br>
discemable. Without being bound by theory, it is further believed that the volatile solvent serves<br>
to effect reversible attachment of the particles to the receptive surfaces by weaker, non-covalent<br>
binding forces by enabling the particles during the evaporation step to settle onto the surfaces in<br>
their lowest energetically favorable binding states with maximum surface contact. Owing to the<br>
extremely small particle sizes, and the ability of the particle agglomerates to adopt the most<br>
favorable positions during solvent evaporation, binding forces owing to hydrophobic-<br>
hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces are sufficient to enable the hydrophobically<br>
modified silica particles to bind tightly enough to suitably receptive surfaces to effectively resist<br>
displacement even under flowing water and/or air, yet be readily removed when desired by<br>
moderate means.<br><br><br>
[00101] Thus, the films produced by the treatment compositions and methods of the present<br>
invention are detachable and may be readily removed by physical means, such as by abrasion,<br>
rubbing or wiping using some appropriate physical tool or wiping article and/or by chemical<br>
means, such as by use of a surface active agent, dispersant and/or solvent, or some suitable<br>
combination of these to overcome the relatively weak binding energies of the particles and<br>
displace them from the surface. It is noted that water alone under typical temperatures and<br>
pressures, such as rain water, splashed water and a moderate water spray using a home garden<br>
hose, and further, even water with significant soil load and contaminants present, is not effective<br>
in displacing the films of the present invention, thus enabling them to act as detachable but<br>
durable protective coatings on receptive substrates that favorably repel dirt, and owing to their<br>
hydrophobic nature and high water contact angles are water-repellent and capable of being<br>
cleaned of any adhering soil or dirt using water alone. The treated surfaces also exhibit a<br>
surprising ability to repel and resist the adhesion of dry soils and particulate matter, such as<br>
brake-dust and household dust, and the surfaces bearing the protective films according to the<br>
present invention can be cleaned using a gentle stream of air alone, or if a vertical surface the use<br>
of a gentle tapping, shaking or slight percussive motion to displace particulate soils. Thus,<br>
receptive materials treated according to the methods and treatment compositions of the present<br>
invention exhibit dirt-repellency, are self-cleaning, and their favorable repellency properties<br>
provide easy cleaning using water alone. Further, treated materials exhibit easier cleaning and<br>
easier next-time cleaning in that non-removable and/or excessive soil load that may adhere to the<br>
film are prevented from associating with the underlying surface, and thus are more readily<br>
removed from the surface during a cleaning step employing a cleaning agent, such as a surfactant<br>
solution, owing to the films being detachable in nature and thus acting as a removable sacrificial<br>
barrier in protecting the treated surface from soil adhesion and build-up, while still providing<br>
self-cleaning characteristics to the surface. Surfaces thus cleaned to remove a previously applied<br>
protective film, may then be reprotected by a fresh application of the present inventive treatment<br><br><br>
compositions to restore the self-cleaning and easier next time cleaning benefits. Thus, the<br>
surface treatment and resulting protective benefit is infinitely renewable in that the surface may<br>
subsequently be retreated periodically, or at any desired interval without any harm or degradation<br>
of the original surface.<br>
[00102] In addition, an inventive protective coating on a previously treated surface may be<br>
renewed by repeated application of the inventive treatment compositions, without prior removal<br>
of the protective coating, even if the coating is partially worn away or damaged. Generally, it is<br>
desirable to remove a prior coating, particularly if the surface becomes damaged and/or<br>
excessively soiled between treatments, but this is not a requirement. Without being bound by<br>
theory, it is believed that reapplication of the inventive treatment compositions to a previously<br>
treated surface, owing to the reintroduction of the solvent carrier and an additional fresh aliquot<br>
of the hydrophobic silica agglomerates, results in sufficient resuspension and redistribution of<br>
the inventive materials across the surface in a manner that essentially renews the protective<br>
coating while preventing excessive build-up that would otherwise diminish the superior optical<br>
properties exhibited by the inventive treatment compositions.<br>
Application Means<br>
[00103] Application of the inventive treatment compositions to a receptive surface may be<br>
achieved by use of an application device employing any suitable means known in the art capable<br>
of producing a fine distribution of fine liquid droplets and directing them to the surface to be<br>
treated. The application device can be an aerosol or non-aerosol device. Treatment<br>
compositions can be sprayed using any suitable type of sprayer. One suitable type of sprayer is<br>
an aerosol pressurized package using a propellant. If an aerosol sprayer is used, it can use any<br>
suitable type of propellant. The propellant can include hydrocarbon propellants, or non-<br><br><br>
hydrocarbon propellants. A non-hydrocarbon propellant may include, but is not limited to: a<br>
compressed and/or liquefiable gas. Suitable compressed gases include, but are not limited to:<br>
compressed air, nitrogen, inert gases, carbon dioxide, etc., and suitable liquefiable volatile<br>
materials include, but are not limited to: propane, butane, pentane, and materials selected from<br>
hydrocarbons, fluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00104] In one embodiment, a pressurized aerosol package is employed, using the liquid<br>
treatment compositions of the present invention, optionally pressurized by use of a suitable<br>
pressurized gas, compressible liquid and/or liquid propellant, and/or gaseous propellant or<br>
combination thereof, in combination with a dispensing valve capable of suitably dispensing the<br>
liquid treatment composition in the form of a plurality of fine droplets.<br>
[00105] Suitable aerosol delivery includes the Truspray® system (available from Boehringer<br>
Ingelheim-Steag microParts, Dortmund, Germany) which employs capillary atomization<br>
technology to deliver fine atomization with reduced propellant and solvent levels, enabling more<br>
concentrated colloidal dispersions and/or thickened treatment compositions according to the<br>
present invention to be suitably dispensed.<br>
[00106] Also suitable are application devices and/or dispensing devices not requiring the use of<br>
a pressurization means and/or propellant means.<br>
[00107] One suitable example disclosed in U.S. Pat. 6,708,852 describes a mechanically<br>
pressurized dispensing system that offers an alternative to chemically pressurized aerosol<br>
dispensers. The system is fitted over a standard container holding a liquid product, and includes<br>
a dip tube assembly to draw liquid into the dispensing head assembly, where the contents are<br>
released through the dispensing head assembly, via the nozzle and valve. A twist of the threaded<br>
cap raises a piston, thereby opening a charging chamber within the dispensing head assembly.<br>
This creates a vacuum with the resulting suction pulling the product up through the dip tube to<br><br><br>
fill the charging chamber. Twisting the cap in the opposite direction lowers the piston in a down<br>
stroke, which closes the charging chamber, forcing the product into the expandable elastic<br>
reservoir where it is then discharged through the nozzle.<br>
[00108] Also suitable are applicator devices in which the container encloses the liquid treatment<br>
composition present in a separate pouch, either foiled or foil-less bag, that is surrounded by<br>
propellant within the container and surrounding the inner sealed pouch. Examples include those<br>
disclosed in U.S. Pat. 6,196,275, U.S. Pat. 4,308,973, and U.S. Pat. 5,730,326 describing a<br>
rechargeable container. U.S. Pat. App. 2003/0102328 describes an aerosol container lacking a<br>
return spring and product dip tube. For some applications, a dip tube may still be appropriate.<br>
The valve may have multiple product delivery openings. The container may use a propellant<br>
driven piston to dispense the product or the product may be in a collapsible, flexible bag.<br>
[00109] U. S. Pat. 5,111,971 describes a pressurized liner-sleeve assembly that can be fitted<br>
with an aerosol valve, and requires no propellant.<br>
[00110] Elimination of the chemical propellant can reduce or eliminate volatile organic content<br>
(VOC) to allow compliance with various state and federal regulations designed to reduce green-<br>
house gas emissions. Alternatives to chemically pressurized dispensers include various<br>
mechanically pressurized models that obtain prolonged spray time by storing a charge without<br>
the use of chemical propellants. Such "stored charge" dispensers include types that are<br>
mechanically pressurized at the point of assembly, as well as types that may be mechanically<br>
pressurized by an operator at the time of use. Stored charge dispensers that are pressurized at the<br>
point of assembly often include a bladder that is pumped up with product. Examples include<br>
those described in U.S. Pat. 4,387,833 and 4,423,829.<br>
[00111] Stored charge dispensers that are pressurized by an operator at the time of use typically<br>
include charging chambers that are charged by way of screw threads, cams, levers, ratchets,<br><br><br>
gears, and other constructions providing a mechanical advantage for pressurizing a product<br>
contained within a chamber. This type of dispenser is generally be referred to as a "charging<br>
chamber dispenser." Many ingenious charging dispensers have been produced. Examples<br>
include those described in U.S. Pat. 4,872,595, U.S. Pat. 4,222,500, U.S. Pat. 4,174,052, U.S.<br>
Pat. 4,167,941, and U.S. Pat. 5,183,185, which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[00112] U.S. Pat. App. 2005/0035213 describes an ultrasonic spray coating system comprising<br>
an ultrasonic transducer with spray forming head, integrated fluid delivery device with air and<br>
liquid supply passage ways, support brackets and an ultrasonic power generator. The ultrasonic<br>
transducer consists of an ultrasonic converter that converts high frequency electrical energy into<br>
high frequency mechanical energy. The converter has a resonant frequency. A spray forming<br>
head is coupled to the converter and is resonant at the same resonant frequency of the converter.<br>
The spray forming head has a spray-forming tip and concentrates the vibrations of the converter<br>
at the spray-forming tip. The separate passage ways for air and the liquid supply allows the<br>
treatment compositions to remain separated from potential contaminants until used. The<br>
ultrasonic transducer can produce a fine mist or a spray as the transducer is adjusted. Additional<br>
ultrasonic spray devices are described in U.S. Pat. App. 2004/0256482 and U.S. Pat. 6,651,650,<br>
which describes an ultrasonic atomizer for pumping up a liquid from a liquid vessel by an<br>
ultrasonic pump and atomizing the liquid by passing it through a mesh plate formed to have<br>
multiplicity of minute holes. The device can be controlled for automatic, manual, or intermittent<br>
operation.<br>
[00113] Another non-limiting example is the TrueSpray™ (TTP Group, The Technology<br>
Partnership) and TouchSpray™ (ODEM affiliates of TTP, Bespak PLC and PARI GmbH,<br>
Germany) atomization devices which both employ a microdroplet generating system based on a<br>
perforated membrane that is vibrated at selected frequencies to convert a continuous flow of an<br>
atomizable liquid composition on one side of the membrane into a fine spray of liquid droplets<br><br><br>
emanating from the opposite side. The system employs an electrical means using either a battery<br>
or other electronic power supply and a circuit to control the vibrational frequencies, amplitudes<br>
and duration of membrane oscillation in order to control liquid flow and dispensing rates as well<br>
as droplet size, distribution, velocity and atomization rate. A favorable property of this<br>
application means is the tendency of the system to produce smaller liquid droplet sizes on the<br>
order of 10 to 100 microns in diameter, with a majority of the liquid droplets of a size within<br>
several standard deviations of the mean liquid droplet size, thus producing a homogeneous<br>
distribution of fine liquid droplets of uniform size, which would be capable of forming a more<br>
uniform surface film of applied material when used to deposit the inventive treatment<br>
compositions onto a receptive surface.<br>
[00114] Also suitable are electrostatic applicators, which may be employed as a delivery means<br>
that combines any suitable atomization means with a dispenser capable of imparting a unipolar<br>
charge on the dispensed liquid droplets, which may be selected to be net positive or net negative<br>
depending on the conditions desired and target substrate. Imparting a unipolar charge to the<br>
dispensed droplets acts to disperse them during atomization, as the like-charged droplets tend to<br>
repel one another so that coherence of the spray pattern of the plurality of droplets is maintained<br>
while the droplets are in flight. The unipolar charge, suitably selected, may also act to<br>
accelerate, attract and/or adhere the charged droplets onto either a neutral, polarizable or<br>
oppositely charged surface to effectively increase deposition efficiency and further decrease<br>
overspray and droplet bounce from the target surface, as well as producing more uniform films<br>
on the surface.<br>
Treatment Kits<br>
[00115] The inventive treatment compositions, suitably packaged in a dispensing and/or<br>
applicator means for direct application to a receptive surface, may be combined in the form of a<br>
treatment kit. The treatment kit may further contain instructions for use of the inventive<br><br><br>
treatment compositions, including a list of suitable surfaces and substrates that may be treated,<br>
application techniques and application instructions illustrating use of and most suitable means of<br>
applying the compositions to surfaces, pre-cleaning instructions, drying instructions, and post-<br>
treatment cleaning instructions, and the like.<br>
[00116] Generally, it is desirable to treat a surface that has been previously cleaned so as to<br>
form a first protective coating on a cleaned receptive surface. This is typically done for most<br>
surfaces by washing with a detergent, hard surface cleaner, soap or some similar cleaning agent<br>
followed by either rinsing with water and allowing to dry, or wiping dry directly, or wiping dry<br>
after rinsing with water. Generally, it is desirable to remove all trace residue of water, cleaning<br>
agent and other adherent materials before treatment. The inventive treatment compositions may<br>
be applied to damp or slightly wetted surfaces, but generally a substantially dry surface, such as<br>
one free of adherent water droplets, to which the inventive treatment compositions are applied<br>
provides for the most appealing aesthetic surface treatment. Thus, treatment kits according to the<br>
present invention may optionally include a drying article, such as for example, but not limited to:<br>
an absorbent material, a drying aid, and/or combinations thereof. Examples of suitable absorbent<br>
materials that may be used as a drying article include, but are not limited to: a woven, non-<br>
woven, sponge, polymeric foam, microfiber, paper towel, paper pad, tissue or other similar<br>
absorbent article or wiping article capable of effectively absorbing and/or removing water from a<br>
wetted surface prior to application of the inventive treatment compositions. Other alternative<br>
drying articles include drying aids. Examples of suitable drying aids include for example, but<br>
are not limited to: a compressed gas source, infrared heat generating device, forced air device,<br>
such as a powered fan, combinations thereof, and the like.<br>
Preparation of Treatment Compositions<br>
[00117] Treatment compositions according to the present invention may be prepared by a<br>
variety of methods well known in the art depending on the quantity and scale desired. For the<br><br><br>
purpose of consistency in preparing small batches for testing and evaluation, inventive treatment<br>
compositions were prepared using process compositions, i. e., concentrated hydrophobically<br>
modified fumed silica dispersions as indicated, produced according to the inventive process<br>
described herein, and then further processed in the following manner described below suitable<br>
for obtaining quantities of 100 to 5,000 grams of a finished or ready-to-use treatment<br>
composition. First, a major aliquot, or total desired level of the volatile solvent is weighed into<br>
a plastic vessel, optionally with a remaining minor aliquot of the volatile solvent retained in<br>
order to later rinse the walls of the mixing vessel, if desired. Stirring is then begun using a<br>
conventional motorized mixer using a mechanical stirring rod of suitable size, operated at a<br>
speed of about 300 to 400 r.p.m. sufficient to create a smooth vortex without splashing of the<br>
volatile solvent. Addition of the optional dispersing agent, and/or addition of the optional<br>
durability agent, if any, is performed by slowly adding each separately in turn and mixing<br>
sufficiently to achieve a uniform solution and/or suspension of the agents in the volatile solvent,<br>
generally following about 5 to 10 minutes mixing duration. The process composition is then<br>
added slowly to the solution, and after complete addition, any remaining aliquot of the volatile<br>
solvent added in such a manner as to rinse any adhering particles on the mechanical stirring rod<br>
and/or sides of the mixing vessel into the bulk liquid. The mixing speed is generally maintained<br>
at 400 r.p.m., but may optionally be increased to about 1000 r.p.m., if desired, and stirring<br>
continued for a time sufficient to produce a homogeneous dispersion of the particles, which can<br>
be as short as a minute or so, or longer if additional materials are to be added. Alternatively, the<br>
optional dispersing agent, and/or optional durability agent may be added at this stage of the<br>
mixing to produce a final treatment composition.<br>
[00118] This approach produces suitable treatment compositions of colloidal dispersions of the<br>
hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles according to the present invention in a volatile<br>
solvent, which may then be combined with a suitable applications means to provide for suitable<br>
dispensing onto a target surface. In one embodiment, for example, the treatment compositions<br><br><br>
may be packaged into a suitable aerosol container (i.e., a conventional pressurized spray can with<br>
pin hole nozzle) as an application means combined in the form of a treatment kit, and optionally<br>
combined with a propellant or compressible gas to provide for suitable dispensing by<br>
atomization.<br>
[00119] In another embodiment, treatment compositions may be processed further with addition<br>
of, and/or dilution with additional volatile solvent, and/or additional optional suspending<br>
agent(s), and/or additional optional functional adjuncts, and/or optional propellant prior to<br>
packaging or use. In yet another alternative embodiment, the colloidal dispersion of the<br>
hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles may be packaged or associated with a non-<br>
aerosol applicator for dispensing by suitable means not requiring direct pressurization and/or use<br>
of a propellant.<br>
[00120] For testing purposes, treatment compositions prepared from the process compositions<br>
described herein comprising dispersions of the hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles<br>
in the volatile solvent were applied using the PreVal™ system commercially available from<br>
Precision Valve (New York, NY).<br>
Preparation of Samples for Particle Size Analysis<br>
[00121] Particle size analysis of the hydrophobically modified fumed silica particles was<br>
performed following application to a treated surface by use of scanning electron microscopy<br>
(SEM) to image and evaluate particle size, distribution and coverage of the particles present in-<br>
situ on the surface. Representative substrates were tested, including plastic and metal surfaces,<br>
by employing flat plastic and aluminum test panels, respectively, of approximately 1" x 1" size<br>
that are carefully cleaned with anhydrous isopropanol and dried prior to use. Coated test panels<br>
are prepared by first covering one-half of the panel (approximately ½" x 1" portion) with heavy<br>
stock paper or suitable barrier that will not wet through or overspray during application of test<br><br><br>
formulations, which are then sprayed manually in essentially the same manner as used in<br>
applying a spray paint to a surface, by evenly spraying the treatment compositions onto the test<br>
panel surface using a smooth uninterrupted linear motion during spraying, with the nozzle<br>
located approximately 6" from the surface, with the spraying action commencing a short time<br>
prior to reaching the one edge of the test panel and continuing for a short time after passing the<br>
second edge of the test panel in order to produce a uniform coating. The treated panel is allowed<br>
to dry with the partial cover paper attached, and then mounted onto a carrier sheet, e.g. a thicker<br>
piece of paper stock by using double sticky tape, and the sample stored under a dust cover prior<br>
to imaging to preserve the treated surface.<br>
[00122] The surface morphology of the test panels coated with the inventive treatment<br>
compositions were examined using a Hitachi S-4300SE SEM (Hitachi USA) operated at an<br>
accelerating voltage of 2 kilovolts (KV). The test panels were dried at room temperature and no<br>
additional coating was performed prior to the examination.<br>
[00123] Results of the SEM imaging are shown in the accompanying Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1, a<br>
black test panel was treated with a conventional Lotus effect coating formulation prepared<br>
according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2004/0213904, corresponding to<br>
Comparative Example 21 as referenced herein. By eye, the panel treated by the comparative<br>
material appeared visually hazy and the SEM image shows a generally uneven (non-<br>
homogenous) surface covered by small particles presumed to be larger silica agglomerates and/or<br>
clumps of agglomerated material. In Fig. 2, a black test panel was treated with the inventive<br>
treatment composition (Example 15) employing means of application according to the methods<br>
of the present invention, but otherwise prepared, treated and evaluated in an identical manner as<br>
the first test panel. By eye, the panel was extremely glossy and reflective, no noticeable film or<br>
haziness being apparent on the surface under normal lighting conditions. The SEM image in Fig.<br>
2 reveals an extremely smooth and uniform film of particulate materials on the surface of the<br><br><br>
panel, evidence of a very isotropic and homogeneous surface morphology. The scale of both<br>
SEM images is about 200 µm, corresponding to an effective magnification of about 250x.<br>
Atomic Force Microscopy<br>
[00124] Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the extent and nature of the<br>
renewable surface modification effects according to the materials, treatment compositions and<br>
methods of application of the present invention. The AFM technique allows virtual imaging of<br>
the surface at a scale fairly comparable to that of the applied deposited materials so that surface<br>
topography can be ascertained to a high degree of precision. AFM images were obtained using a<br>
Digital Instruments Nanoscope III in non-contact mode with Olympus Tapping Etched Silicon<br>
Problem Aluminum-coated (OTESPA) sensing tips. Images were acquired from the center of<br>
each one inch square segment of panel. Although phase data was simultaneously acquired, no<br>
significant phase difference in the topography were detected, so images were generated without<br>
including this factor. Photomicrographs of the AFM data generated images are presented herein<br>
with appropriate vertical height scales indicated by the relative intensity of the image at the<br>
indicated coordinates, scaled from black (0) to white (1) on a relative basis with respect to the<br>
relative vertical height range indicated in the key insert accompanying the photomicrograph, and<br>
the horizontal length scale length is indicated on the borders in units of micrometers (µm). Fig. 3<br>
shows typical topographical images obtained on a treated black paint panel after treatment with a<br>
treatment composition applied according to the present invention, compared to Fig. 4 of an<br>
untreated black paint panel.<br>
Preparation of Coated Paint Panels<br>
[00125] Treatment compositions of the present invention were applied to a variety of surfaces<br>
for testing and evaluation, using representative materials selected for convenience of testing<br>
under controlled conditions including a clear coated black painted metal rectangular test panel<br><br><br>
obtained from ACT Laboratories Co., Hillsdale, Michigan, designated APR41841, Batch<br>
50505412, having an exceptionally high gloss surface owing to clear-coating finish R10CG060Z<br>
UreClear. Test panels were first thoroughly cleaned with isopropyl alcohol (IPA), washed with a<br>
soap and water solution, and finally rinsed with IP A, rinsed with de-ionized water, wiped dry<br>
with a dry lint-free paper towel. Visual inspection of each panel was performed to insure<br>
cleanliness and panels were handled by the edges to prevent fingerprints from marring the<br>
surface. Selected portions of the panel were masked to produce control and treatment areas, the<br>
middle roughly 1/3 area section being masked by use of a folded paper covering the center of the<br>
test panel or temporary barrier when sprayed to prevent overspray. Samples were placed in a<br>
holder so that they could be sprayed while in a vertical orientation. After masking, the exposed<br>
right and left side sections were treated by spraying test formulas using the PreVal™ sprayer<br>
system, held about 8 to 10 inches above the panel surface with spraying times of about 3<br>
seconds, in a consistent overlapping spray pattern with motion from top to bottom of the panel,<br>
repeated consistently for every panel in the set, which usually included three sets of panels and<br>
four replicates per set per treatment composition under evaluation. Following spraying, test<br>
panels are either dried at 80°C for 15 minutes (accelerated drying), followed by at least 5 minutes<br>
of cooling time, or allowed to dry at room temperature or about 70°F overnight or until dry by<br>
appearance (typically 5-30 minutes depending on the surface and up to one to two hours for<br>
heavy applications on some non-porous surfaces).<br>
[00126] The first set of panels was used for evaluation of hydrophobic surface modification<br>
with respect to water repellency ("Roll Off Test"), appearance evaluation with a haze meter<br>
instrument ("Chrome Test"), and gloss-meter instrument, and durability testing under repeated<br>
water rinse conditions ("Durability Test"). The second set of panels were used to evaluate self-<br>
cleaning soil repellency characteristics measured both qualitatively by visual rankings using<br>
trained evaluators and/or quantitatively using a combined gloss-meter and colorimeter<br>
instrument.<br><br><br>
Roll Off Test<br>
[00127] To measure the ability of treated surfaces to repel water, contact angle measurements<br>
and visual evaluation of the behavior of a water droplet was performed. A single drop of tap<br>
water (roughly 0.05 mL) was applied to the test panel surface held in a horizontal position.<br>
Contact angles were measured using an N.R.L. Model C.A. 100-00 goniometer (Rame-Hart,<br>
Mountain Lake, NJ).<br>
[00128] Surface behavior of the water droplet was observed while the panel was moved and<br>
rocked gently while held by hand in a generally horizontal position, and a rating score assigned<br>
to the treated panel based on the behavior of the water droplet as described below:<br>
Rating Description of Visual Behavior<br>
1	"Marble on a surface" - water droplet rolls easily<br>
2	Rolls easily, but sticks occasionally<br>
3	Rolls freely but sticks some times<br>
4	Rolls freely but sticks more often<br>
5	Remains mostly in place with hardly any movement<br>
6	Water droplet remains fixed in place (untreated surface)<br>
Roll Off Height Test<br>
[00129] In addition to visually assessing roll off behavior, a "roll off height" measurement was<br>
performed to determine the height of inclination required for water to roll off from a panel<br>
following a surface treatment to be evaluated. Panels were prepared using the same approach as<br>
described in the preceding Roll Off Test herein.<br>
[00130] Panels to be evaluated are then placed on a flat or elevated flat surface in a horizontal<br><br><br>
position, with one side of the panel, and if rectangular in shape this being one of the short sides<br>
of the rectangular panel, placed in close proximity to a vertically positioned scaled ruler placed<br>
perpendicular to the flat or elevated surface such that the height of the selected edge as it is<br>
displaced from the horizontal position can be readily measured by comparing the edge to the<br>
markings on the scale.<br>
[00131] With the panel in the initial horizontal position, from about three to five independent<br>
drops of water (about 0.1 mL each) are gently pipetted onto the panel in an approximately<br>
straight line located approximately parallel to the selected edge and located approximately 1 inch<br>
from the selected edge. The panel is then lifted so as to elevate the selected edge of the panel in<br>
an upward vertical direction slowly and smoothly to prevent any undesirable motions, until all of<br>
the water droplets "break free of the surface" and/or begin to move or roll down the inclined<br>
surface of the panel. The height at which the drop begins to roll off is obtained from the scale,<br>
being the "Roll Off Height", and generally expressed in centimeters (cm).<br>
[00132] Any residual liquid (spotting or trailing) after the drops have rolled off is noted.<br>
Additional replicates or measurements of the Roll Off Height are obtained by rotating the test<br>
panel 180° and repeating the test again.<br>
Chrome Test<br>
[00133] All appearance measurements under identical conditions were taken either before and<br>
after treatment, or taken from treated and untreated (masked) sections of the test panel, with the<br>
difference between these measurements calculated to determine changes as a result of the<br>
treatment or soiling test employed. Colorimetric, gloss and haze measuring instrumentation and<br>
techniques can be employed to demonstrate the surprisingly transparent nature of the surface<br>
protective films and coatings formed onto receptive surfaces by means of employing the<br>
inventive treatment compositions.<br><br><br>
[00134] Colorimeter measurements were performed using a Minolta spectrophotometer, Model<br>
CM-508D, Serial No. 15711032, with an illuminating/viewing geometry selected to compensate<br>
for specular reflection, SCE (specular component excluded), obtained from Konica Minolta<br>
Photo Imaging Inc. Instruments Systems Division, Mahwah, NJ.<br>
[00135] Measurements before and after treatment or soiling were taken as described above,<br>
although tests can be done in different order to enable sequential testing against the various test<br>
methods for convenience. All measurements are generally replicates of duplicate or additional<br>
trials that are then averaged, differences before and after treatment being reported at Delta E,<br>
which is the total color difference between the sample and a reference sample, or alternatively<br>
the initial untreated and final post-treated sample after treatment was applied. To determine the<br>
major contribution to the Delta E value, Delta L and the colorimetric "a" and "b" parameters<br>
were examined and Delta L was found to best represent, and be most sensitive to changes in the<br>
visually appearance of treated materials, likely owing to the colorimetric "L" parameter being the<br>
parameter that tracks total neutral shade values from pure black (L=0) to pure white (L=100) in<br>
the absence of any color contributions. Similar measurements were also employed to measure<br>
the relative influence on Delta E and Delta L following application and removal of soil to<br>
provide an approach to measuring comparative soil removal. Visual evaluation of the surfaces<br>
held at a reflective angle to a light source (a suitable example being normal overhead fluorescent<br>
room lighting, incandescent lamp and outdoor sunlight) was also performed to judge aesthetic<br>
characteristics of treated surfaces, in particular appearance associated with common visual<br>
descriptors including: "uneven" and/or "streaky", "hazy", cloudy" and/or "dull", "pearlescent"<br>
and/or "rainbow effect", and "clear" and/or "glossy". Here, both "pearlescent" and "rainbow<br>
effect" refer to the tendency of thin transparent films, depending on their thickness, regularity of<br>
thickness and the substrate to which applied, produce interference and diffraction effects upon<br>
reflection of incident white light which are perceived as a plurality of colored patterns and<br>
colored bands, respectively.<br><br><br>
[00136] Haze measurements were performed using a Haze Gloss Meter, Model No. 4606,<br>
available form BYK Gardner, Silver Spring, MD, U.S.A calibrated with a haze-gloss standard<br>
reference No. 195829312 providing a haze set point value corresponding to H'(20°) = 463. Haze<br>
Unit measurements obtained were uncompensated (indicated as "nc") values determined after<br>
calibration. Delta Haze Units corresponded to the difference in measured Haze obtained by<br>
subtraction of haze values obtained before and after treatment of a chromed panel, or between an<br>
untreated control panel and a treated panel, or between an untreated and treated portion of the<br>
same panel, as indicated. Generally, Delta Haze Unit measurements using the same panel before<br>
and after treatment and other test procedures as described herein are preferred for improved<br>
accuracy, with a multiple number of replicate readings taken across the surface to enable an<br>
average value to be calculated.<br>
[00137] Delta Haze Unit measurements were made on the treated surfaces to correlate the level<br>
of haze associated with the typical ability of the human eye to discern noticeably perceptible<br>
visual change in the surface appearance of treated substrates viewed under normal room lighting.<br>
A highly polished mirror finished reflective chromed test panel was selected as a preferred<br>
surface for the purposes of testing and demonstrating the advantageous optical properties of<br>
surface protective films provided by use of the instant treatment compositions, as the chrome<br>
surface showed a high sensitivity to changes in surface appearance and measured haze<br>
parameters. The chrome test panels, 4" x 8" in size are designated SAE-1010 CR with 1/8" hole<br>
for suspension, Chrome Plated Steel, available from Metaspec, Inc., San Antonio, TX. Thus the<br>
Chrome Test, conducted to provide a Delta Haze Unit measurement on treated chrome, provides<br>
a convenient means of measuring the surprisingly improved transparent protective films<br>
produced by the inventive treatment compositions.<br>
[00138] Generally, the inventive treatment compositions when applied to the polished chrome<br>
test panels produced transparent and nearly invisible surface coatings that demonstrated the<br><br><br>
beneficial protective properties as described herein. Haze measurements confirmed that Delta<br>
Haze Unit values of below around 250 as measured according to the Chrome Test methodologies<br>
described hereinabove are readily achievable by use of the inventive compositions, these Delta<br>
Haze Unit values corresponding to a change in the measured haze value wherein the level of<br>
haze produced on the surface is barely, if at all perceptible to the human eye.<br>
Substantivity and Durability Test<br>
[00139] Substantivity testing was also performed to determine the ability of the treated surfaces<br>
to maintain their beneficial properties following treatment, and the durability of the beneficial<br>
properties following challenge by soils, dirt, water, mechanical abrasion and action of cleaning<br>
solutions. These substantivity and durability tests provide a measure of the inventive treatment<br>
compositions utility for treated interior and exterior surfaces, and materials likely to be exposed<br>
to a variety of typical environmental challenges.<br>
[00140] Panels previously used for the Roll Off Test may be employed, or newly prepared<br>
panels, placed and held in an approximately vertical position. For substantivity testing, panels<br>
are sprayed over an approximately 3" x 6" area, using an electrosprayer charged with regular tap<br>
water (Febreze Power Sprayer, carefully cleaned and rinsed with water before use, distributed by<br>
the Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio) for 15 seconds of continuous spray,<br>
measured using a timer.<br>
[00141] Following spraying, the surface of the panel is visually evaluated to determine the<br>
tendency of any water drops to remain on the surface, which would be indicative of a loss of the<br>
protective benefit, compared to an untreated control panel. The number of drops and surface<br>
appearance of the panels following the rinsing are collectively assigned a visual substantivity<br>
grading score being an integer from 0 to 10, using the following scale as guidance, with<br>
intermediate assignments possible:<br><br>
Rating	Description of Visual Behavior ( Water Adhesion)<br>
10	No observed water droplets<br>
7	Small number of water droplets<br>
5	Some water droplets<br>
3	Numerous water droplets<br>
1	Appearance similar to untreated control<br>
0	Appearance worse than untreated control<br>
Durability Test<br>
[00142] Durability testing is performed in a similar manner as the substantivity test described<br>
hereinabove, with the substantivity test procedure repeated a multiple number of times (cycles)<br>
until a visual grading score of approximately 5 is observed, at which point the number of cycles<br>
is recorded as the Durability Test Score. This Durability Test Score essentially represents the<br>
number of water rinses over which the protective benefit may be observed, with a higher number<br>
of cycles representing both increased substantivity (the effect) and persistence of effect<br>
(duration) of the surface protective benefit at an acceptable level of performance (about 5 on the<br>
substantivity visual grading scale). Durability Test Scores of at least 1 are suitable for sacrificial<br>
surface protective coatings that will provide durability following at least one rinse event using<br>
water to remove incidental soil, dirt and grime from a protected surface to which the inventive<br>
treatment compositions are applied. Higher durability scores are more suitable for detachable,<br>
yet more durable surface coatings that can provide multiple rinse cleaning cycles using water. A<br>
Durability Duration value (in units of seconds) can also be calculated by multiplying the total<br>
number of cycles determined according to the durability test (Durability Test Score) times the<br>
individual spray time used (15 seconds per spray in the test method) to determine a Durability<br>
Duration time for the inventive films present on a treated surface according to the methods<br>
described herein.<br><br><br>
Self Cleaning Test (Qualitative)<br>
[00143] Self cleaning performance testing (designated "SCL Test") is done to determine the<br>
ability of treated panels to be cleaned of adhering soil, dust, grime and the like following simple<br>
mechanical tapping or rinsing by water alone (soil-repellency and self-cleaning performance, and<br>
easier cleaning performance). Treated panels are first exposed to a soil laden environment, or<br>
may be soiled artificially to mimic such exposure in the following manner: Treated panels and<br>
control panels are positioned on a flat or inclined surface, depending on the surface to be<br>
modeled or for worst case testing positioned in a horizontal orientation. Powdered soil of choice<br>
is shaken onto the panels to produce a thin uniform coating, the panel is re-orientated into a<br>
vertical position so that excess (non-adherent) soil will fall away. To simulate brake-dust as a<br>
test soil, brake fines obtained from replacement brake pads as described below were combined to<br>
obtain a dry free flowing finely powdered dust. The brake dust thus obtained was placed into a<br>
large cheese shaker can with fine holes on the top, inverted and applied evenly across the test<br>
panel surfaces by hand.<br>
[00144] Brake-dust test soil was prepared by finely grinding down the top three purchased<br>
brands of brake pads obtained from Grand Auto, a national retailer with branches throughout the<br>
United States, corresponding to Honda Accord front new pads #45022-S84-A02, Honda Accord<br>
rear new pads#43022-SY8-A01, VW Jetta front new pads #1SATZ 1-J0698 151 J, VW Jetta rear<br>
new pads #1 SATZ 1J0698 451 D, Ford Taurus front new pads # 2F1Z-2001-AA, and Ford<br>
Taurus rear new pads # F8DZ-2200-AA. All pads were individually ground down to a fine dust,<br>
which was then sieved through a 325 mesh screen on a conventional Rotap™ machine to collect<br>
only the fines below that mesh size. For an approximately 30 gram portion of finished brake-<br>
dust test soil, about 3 grams each of the back brake pad fines and about 7 grams each of the front<br>
brake pad fines (the front pads wearing faster during typical use) were combined to produce a<br>
representative test soil that closely resembled that observed on actual vehicle wheels produced<br><br>
during normal operation.<br>
[00145] Once the soiled panel is prepared, it is rated using the description of visual behavior<br>
scale presented herein below, and is then mounted in either an inclined or vertical position. In<br>
dry soil resistance testing, the panel is lightly tapped once and the appearance evaluated to<br>
determine dry soil repellency/resistance. In a wet soil resistance test, the panel is sprayed with<br>
water in a manner as described above in the Substantivity Test Method, using tap water in the<br>
electronic sprayer operated for about 15 seconds over the entire surface. For either test, a<br>
duplicate replicate panel is treated in an identical manner and reserved as a control for<br>
subsequent comparisons. After the test panels are treated, visual surface appearance of the<br>
panels are assigned a Self Cleaning Performance score using the following scale as guidance,<br>
either in reference to a treated but unsoiled panel (unsoiled control) that is rinsed according to the<br>
procedure above, or in reference to an untreated but soiled panel. The visual scale employed is as<br>
follows:<br>
Rating	Description of Visual Behavior (Dry or Water Rinse Test)<br>
-3	most/all soil removed (resembles unsoiled control)<br>
-1	slightly less soil sticks or remains<br>
0	no change (untreated soiled panel control)<br>
+1	slightly more soil remains<br>
+3	most/all soil remains<br>
Self Cleaning Test (Quantitative)<br>
[00146] Quantitative measurements of the self-cleaning performance may be performed by<br>
conducting haze test measurements on panels employed as described above in the "SCL Test"<br>
procedure. Haze measurements of untreated panels, treated panels, tapped soil-treated panels<br>
post testing, and soil-treated rinsed panels and rinsed treated panels are obtained by measuring<br><br>
haze at 20° using a Haze-Gloss BYK Gardner Model 4606 instrument, and averaging four<br>
readings per test panel or duplicate readings on at least three replicates panels.<br>
Uniformity Appearance Rating (Qualitative)<br>
[00147] A surface appearance uniformity ranking (designated "Chrome Test") are performed by<br>
measuring treatments applied to a glossy and reflective surface such as a mirror or high gloss<br>
chromed metal substrate. After treatment and drying times as described hereinabove, the highly<br>
reflective substrates are view by eye and a qualitative visual score assigned based on general<br>
appearance and uniformity of the surface over about a 3.5" x 4" size treatment area.<br>
Rating Description of Visual Behavior<br>
6	white haze - significant cloudy and/or dull appearance<br>
5	some hazy appearance<br>
4	uneven appearance and/or streaks observed<br>
3	some distortion but mostly clear with high gloss appearance<br>
2	slight distortion with overall clear and glossy appearance<br>
1	no distortion or visual change (resembles untreated surface)<br>
[00148] Ratings are assigned according to the above scale and closest appearance to the<br>
description of visual behavior noted, using these actual textual descriptions for judges to consider<br>
when viewing and rating the panels.<br>
General Components of Inventive Process Compositions<br>
[00149] Applicants have determined the shear rate dependent viscosity of the inventive process<br>
compositions (at various ranges of silica content and disilazane) as well as prior art<br>
compositions. From this study, it was apparent that the amount of disilazane had no influence on<br>
the flow behavior in a concentration range between 0.5-3.0%. This supports the finding in Table<br>
1 presented hereinbelow that the amount of disilazane has only a minor impact on the achieved<br><br>
median particle size.<br>
[00150] Applicants further note that increasing the amount of silica (5-15%) had a dramatic<br>
impact on the viscosity. Doubling of the concentration from 5% to 10% raises the viscosity by<br>
approximately one order of magnitude. Increasing the concentration to 15% silica, raises the<br>
viscosity by an additional half an order magnitude.<br>
[00151] Additionally, the general flow behavior is dramatically influenced by the amount of<br>
silica. A particle load of 5% can be regarded as a very low concentration since the flow behavior<br>
is that of an ideal (i.e., Newtonian) liquid. At a concentration of 15% silica, however, a<br>
decreasing viscosity with increasing shear rate can be observed that increases again at high shear<br>
rates (dilatant peak). These results support the finding in Table 1 presented hereinbelow that the<br>
amount of silica has a dramatic impact on the achieved median particle size.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Process Compositions<br>
[00152] Examples A through OO in Table 1 are representative embodiments of materials<br>
prepared in the form of process compositions according to the processes of the present invention.<br>
Example H is a comparative example prepared in a manner outside the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Example A<br>
[00153] A quantity of 10.0 g of hexamethyldisilazane (DYNASYLAN® HMDS) was dissolved<br>
in 140 g of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (TEGO® Polish Additiv 5, also designated as siloxane<br>
"D 5"). 50.0 g of a commercially available, hydrophobized fumed silica with a BET surface area<br>
of 220 m2/g (AEROSIL® R 812 S) was slowly dispersed in this solution with gentle stirring at<br><br>
2,000 r.p.m. After all fumed silica had been added, the mixing speed of the Dispermat (single<br>
rotating shaft, outfitted with saw-tooth blade proportional to mixing vessel where blade is half<br>
the diameter of vessel) was increased to 10,000 r.p.m. and kept operating at this speed for 15<br>
min.<br>
Examples B-OO<br>
[00154] Preparation of examples B through OO follows the same procedure as for example A<br>
except using otherwise specified parameters as shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
1.10). This instrument measures the size and distribution of particles suspended in liquid<br>
using laser diffraction.<br>
(2)	Examples F, G, H and 00 were unable to be processed at 10,000 r.p.m..<br>
(3)	Example H additionally contains 2 wt.% of TEGOPREN® 6814, an alkyl-modified<br>
polydimethylsiloxane, as a durability agent and thus is a representative example of the<br>
process compositions obtained by following the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. Pub. No.<br>
2004/0213904A1.<br>
[00155] Examples I through PP are examples of process compositions obtained by further<br>
diluting some of the process compositions in Table 1 with TEGO® Polish Additiv 5.<br><br>
[00156] By comparing Delta Haze values in Table 14 with particle sizes of the corresponding<br>
process compositions, it can be concluded that a particle size of approximately 4,000 nm or less<br>
is necessary to achieve Delta Haze values of 250 or less which was found to be the Haze value<br>
from which on the coatings of the present invention start to be percieved as a visible film by the<br>
human eye on a highly polished chrome test substrate according to the methods described<br>
hereinabove. Table 1 shows that several parameters of different weighting play a role in order to<br>
achieve a targeted particle size of 4000 nm or less. It can be concluded from Table 1 that the<br><br><br>
concentration of silica (AEROSIL®) in the process compositions is by far the most important<br>
factor and that a concentration of 10 wt.% seems to be a lower practical limit. With 5 wt.% for<br>
example (Comparative example H) a more than tenfold larger median particle size is obtained. It<br>
became also obvious that the viscosity of the process composition during mixing is critical and<br>
needs to be in a defined range (see also chapter hereinabove on "General Components of<br>
Inventive Process Compositions"). On the one hand, the process liquid needs to have a high<br>
enough viscosity for adequate energy transmission throughout the bulk solution to produce the<br>
requisite shear forces needed to effectively reduce particle size to the targeted median range. On<br>
the other hand, the process liquid must not be too viscous in order to be still processable in the<br>
mixing equipment.<br>
[00157] It was surprisingly found that these counteracting effects during the process can be<br>
balanced by the use of a disilazane derivative. The impact of hexamethyldisilazane, as one<br>
representative embodiment according to the present invention, on the rheological behavior of<br>
highly concentrated silica dispersions is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows that a dispersion with 25<br>
wt.% silica and without hexamethyldisilazane (Process Composition U) exhibits a yield point<br>
indicated by G' &gt; G", which means it shows a solid-like behavior, whereas a dispersion with 25<br>
wt.% silica and with 5 wt.% hexamethyldisilazane (Process Composition R) does not have a<br>
yield point. Process composition U demonstrates that it was basically possible to process a<br>
dispersion of silica at 25 wt.% without a disilazane derivative, but much more effort was<br>
required to get this amount of silica incorporated into the solvent, and the viscosity was too high<br>
for proper processing. The disilazane derivative not only helps to keep the process viscosity at a<br>
practical level for convenient processing, but also helps to wet and disperse the silica in the<br>
solvent more easily. Besides the silica concentration, mixing process parameters such as stirrer<br>
speed and mixing duration have a significant impact on the particle size results as well, even<br>
though they are not as important as the silica concentration. Obviously it makes a big difference<br>
whether a disilazane derivative is present or not with respect to ease of processing, but the<br><br>
absolute amount present seems to be of lesser importance. In addition, it was observed that<br>
samples processed with a disilazane derivative show a retarded settlement of silica particles<br>
compared to those samples processed without the disilazane derivatives. In summary, it was<br>
surprisingly found that the combination of high silica concentration with a sufficiently high<br>
mixing speed or mixing power is critical to achieve the desired reduction to the desirable median<br>
particle size range of the present invention, and that the presence of a disilazane derivative as a<br>
processing aid facilitates the process dramatically.<br>
[00158] The following examples O and P are further representative embodiments of materials<br>
prepared in the form of process compositions according to the processes of the present invention.<br>
Example O<br>
[00159] A quantity of 5 kg of hexamethyldisilazane (DYNASYLAN® HMDS) was dissolved in<br>
70 kg of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (TEGO® Polish Additiv 5, D 5). 25 kg of a<br>
commercially available, hydrophobized fumed silica with a BET surface area of 220m2/g<br>
(AEROSIL® R 812 S) was added and passed repeatedly through a horizontal mill until the<br>
desired particle size had been achieved.<br>
[00160] Preparation of example P follows the same procedure as for example O except using<br>
otherwise specified parameters as shown in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>

parameters in the table below. Examples A and R demonstrate the variance in the median<br>
particle size achievable under identical process parameters.<br><br><br>

Treatment Compositions<br>
Non-Porous Surface Modification<br>
[00165] Examples of embodiments of the inventive treatment compositions suitable for use in<br>
modification of receptive surfaces, including non-porous surfaces and substrates, are provided in<br>
Table 9. The treatment compositions in these examples are prepared in the form of diluted silica<br>
dispersions for use with a suitable delivery means capable of applying the treatment<br>
compositions for surface modification of a variety of substrates and general usage on automotive,<br>
home and textile surfaces.<br><br>
[00166] Additional embodiments of examples of suitable inventive treatment compositions for<br>
surface modification use are provided in Table 10, further including some optional functional<br>
adjuncts to provide additional benefits to the treatment compositions and improved methods of<br>
application onto targeted surfaces. Examples 9 and 10 are representative embodiments<br>
formulated as ready-to-use propellant-based aerosol treatment compositions.<br><br><br>
[00167] Further embodiments of the inventive treatment compositions prepared to determine the<br>
dependence of properties of the protective coating on compositional variations were explored<br>
using a design of experiments model to vary component levels of the functional and optional<br>
ingredients as shown in Table 11. All treatment compositions were stable during spraying<br>
application, and were applied using a PreVal sprayer.<br><br><br>
[00168] Measurements of the example embodiments were conducted according to the test<br>
procedures described hereinabove on high gloss black clear-coated automotive test panels, with<br>
test data presented in Table 12, and on the high-gloss mirror chrome panels. Results show that a<br>
clean, untreated black panel is fairly hydrophobic owing to the nature of the clear-coat finish and<br>
exhibits a water droplet contact angle of about 79.6°. Spraying of the panels according to the<br>
methods disclosed above with Example treatment compositions 2, 7, 11-14, 17, 18 and 22<br>
provided treated test panels all exhibiting high water contact angles sufficient to repel water.<br>
After application of the inventive treatment compositions 2, 7, 17, 18 and 22 to chrome panels,<br><br>
treated sections of the panels were found to be nearly identical in appearance to untreated or<br>
control sections of the panels previously masked prior to spray treatment to prevent deposition of<br>
the inventive treatment compositions. A six person group visually evaluated the panels<br>
(corresponding to treatment with treatment compositions 2, 7, 17, 18 and 22 according to the<br>
"Chrome Test" appearance ranking and assigned scores on double-blind panel sections to<br>
prevent bias, with averaged scores obtained presented in Table 12. Results show that treatment<br>
according to methods of the present invention provided essentially clear surface coatings that did<br>
not detract from observed shine of the panels, and which were not readily discernable to the<br>
human eye, producing slight distortion or at worst some distortion while maintaining an overall<br>
clear and glossy appearance.<br>
[00169] The ability of the treated black panels to shed water was measured using the roll-off<br>
height test, the height of the inclined panel from a flat horizontal position in centimeters at which<br>
water drops begin to move as shown in Table 12. Results show a tendency for the untreated<br>
panel, despite its moderate hydrophobic properties, to "pin" the water droplet in place, required a<br>
fairly large tilt angle (here in excess of 45°) and Roll-Off Height greater than 20 cm for water<br>
droplets to move. In contrast, the treated panels exhibited the ability to bead the water droplets,<br>
and essentially enable the water droplets to be completely shed from the surface with only a<br>
slight angle as the panels were inclined to a height of less than 1 cm to about 1.5 cm, which<br>
corresponded to an angle of less than 10° inclination from the horizontal.<br>
[00170] Colorimeter test measurement of the treated panels are also shown in Table 12 as the<br>
component contributions Delta E and Delta L illustrating differences before and after treatment<br>
with the inventive treatment compositions. Changes in the control panel measured value (A)<br>
merely reflect the instrumental uncertainty and repeatability of the test. As discussed above,<br>
Delta E measurement reflect the total color difference between panels before and after treatment,<br>
while Delta L measurements best represent changes in white to black color scale "whiteness" of<br><br>
the panels, an indication of any whitish film attributable to haze seen on the panels after<br>
treatment. A higher, or positive Delta L value then corresponds to a greater observed visual haze<br>
on the panel surface, and conversely, a lower or negative Delta L number indicates a sample is<br>
darker than the untreated control. The inventive treatments are seen to affect the measured color<br>
minimally, as expected from the highly transparent nature and lack of visual indication of the<br>
film present on the treated panel surfaces. Colorimeter test measurements employing both Delta<br>
E and Delta L components show that the inventive treatments, which have a minimal impact on<br>
visual appearance, correspondingly exhibit very small changes in both of these parameters,<br>
showing a minimal effect on color (total energy of reflectance, E) and negligible contribution to<br>
haze (white component of reflectance, L).<br><br><br><br>
[00171] The durability and self cleaning ability of surfaces treated using several example<br>
embodiments was tested using treated black automotive panels exposed to water and/or brake<br>
dust, with results presented in Table 13.<br>
[00172] In one test, panels treated with the inventive treatment compositions were first tested<br>
for dry dirt repellency. In a second test, the panels were then exposed to a continuous spray of<br>
water and the time at which the panels first showed an indication to form adherent droplets and<br>
hold beads of water on the surface was noted to the nearest 15 second interval to determine<br>
durability of the coating to a water spray. Alternatively, panels were treated with a 15 second<br>
water spray and the surface appearance ranked by visual inspection according the visual ranking<br>
scale described hereinabove to measure the appearance with respect to any adherent water<br>
droplets. All treatment examples provided an initial benefit in readily shedding water from the<br>
surface compared to an untreated control panel. It needs to be emphasized that all treatment<br>
compositions in Table 13 do not contain a durability agent and yet provide good to excellent<br>
durability of the protective coating. The SCL Brake Dust test results demonstrate the ability of<br>
the dry treated surface to resist adhesion of dry brake-dust without the use of any water or<br>
cleaning action. Here, after exposure to the dry brake-dust test soil according to the methods<br>
described herein above, a single tap was sufficient to remove most if not all of the brake-dust<br>
present on the black test surface treated with the inventive treatment compositions indicated in<br>
Table 13. These test results demonstrate that a deposited film of hydrophobically modified<br>
fumed silica delivered via use of a treatment composition according to the present invention is<br>
capable of providing both wet and dry surface protective benefits, producing a treated article<br>
with the protective film deposited thereon, that exhibits self-cleaning and easier cleaning<br>
benefits.<br><br><br>
Haze Test Results<br>
[00173] Measurements of the example embodiments were taken according to the Chrome Test<br>
procedures described hereinabove on the high shine chrome test panels, with results presented in<br>
Table 14. The chrome test panels have mirror-like finishes and any surface distortion or residue<br>
is readily perceivable by eye, as well as instrumentally, where the Haze measurement technique<br><br>
appears to be the most suited for quantifying very slight changes in appearance. Treatment<br>
weight recorded in Table 14 reflects the amount of applied treatment composition, obtained by<br>
weighing the aerosol can containing the respective treatment before and after controlled<br>
dispensing onto the test panel. Compositions had comparable level of the silica active, so that<br>
the amount of deposited silica materials would be comparable. Application of the comparative<br>
example 21 produced a visually hazy and non-uniform coating on the chrome test panel that was<br>
not acceptable, and had a very large Delta Haze Unit value of 288. In comparison, inventive<br>
treatment compositions, Examples 16, 20 and 22, when applied resulted in transparent and barely<br>
perceptible coatings on the chrome surface, all with very low Delta Haze Unit values. Example<br>
16 produced an invisible coating that could not be discerned by the eye, yet exhibited the full<br>
range of protective performance benefits demonstrated by use of the present invention. A variety<br>
of tests on the polished chrome revealed that an preferred transparent surface coatings could be<br>
obtained from inventive treatment compositions providing a measured Delta Haze Unit value of<br>
equal to or less than about 250, as determined by following the Chrome Test procedure as<br>
described hereinabove.<br><br><br>
[00174] Thus, surprisingly low Delta Haze Units below around 250 before and after treatment<br>
are demonstrated by the inventive treatment compositions even on highly polished chrome,<br>
corresponding to a surface protective treatment that is transparent and nearly invisible to the eye,<br>
and yet maintain the surface protective benefits desirable in a protective film that still retains<br>
effectiveness in resisting and repelling dirt, water and soil, yet can be easily removed from the<br>
treated surfaces. The noted decrease in observable haze corresponds to the reduced particle size,<br>
suggesting that Delta Haze values below 25, which is essentially invisible, are possible when the<br>
median particle size is reduced to below 1000 nanometers. In addition, using colorimetric<br>
measurements, very low Delta E values below around 3.0 as measured on shiny black metal test<br>
panels demonstrate the ability of the inventive methods and treatment compositions to exhibit<br>
self-cleaning capability and ability to maintain visual appearance close to that of the treated<br>
surface prior to soiling and application of the inventive treatments, thus providing a means for<br>
nearly invisible surface protection applicable to a wide variety of surfaces, including glossy and<br>
reflective surfaces.<br>
Treatment of wood panels<br>
[00175] The ability of an example embodiment of the inventive treatment composition in a<br>
convenient aerosol form (using example 23 below) to provide water roll-off properties to a<br>
commercially available varnished wood panel was tested.<br>
Treatment Composition Example 23<br>
Ingredient	Wt.%<br>
Process Composition I	5.0<br>
DYNASILAN® OCTEO	2.0<br>
DC 245  43.0<br>
ATI Propellant	50.0<br><br><br>
[00176] The finished wood substrate was a 3 " x 6" section of tongue and groove wood flooring<br>
purchased from Home Depot, with a factory applied coating of an OEM polyurethane finish,<br>
which being hydrophobic in nature provides the wood with high water resistance. Half of the<br>
surface of the sample was treated by spraying with the aerosol treatment composition from a<br>
distance of 6", with the sample lying horizontally, with the second half was masked to prevent<br>
overspray. The sample was then allowed to dry overnight at ambient conditions.<br>
[00177] The roll-off behavior of several water drops placed on the surface in a horizontal<br>
position was tested, comparing the treated and untreated regions of the surfaces. Surface<br>
behavior of multiple water droplets on the surface were observed using and found to provide a<br>
Roll-off test rating of 2 on the treated side, and a rating of 6 on the untreated side. Visual<br>
comparison of the treated and untreated areas provided a uniformity appearance rating of 2 for<br>
the side treated with the inventive treatment compositions, which provided a clear, transparent<br>
protective coating on the finished wood surface.<br>
[00178] In a demonstration of the removability of the treatment, the treated surface was wiped<br>
three times with a dry paper towel. This dry wiping was effective at removing the inventive<br>
treatment compositions, as evidenced by a repeated Roll-off test performed thereafter that<br>
provided equivalent ratings of 6, respectively on both the previously treated, yet cleaned, and<br>
original untreated control side of the wood panel.<br>
[00179] Thus, the utility of the inventive treatment compositions to provide protection of<br>
varnished decorative household surfaces against accidental splashes of water is demonstrated. In<br>
addition, the easy removal of the treatment without special chemical means is also demonstrated<br>
here.<br><br><br>
Treatment of Plastic Surfaces<br>
[00180] The ability of the inventive treatment composition exampled above to provide water<br>
roll-off properties to commercially available plastics was then tested. Plastic sheet materials,<br>
obtained from McMaster - Carr, were cut into 4" x 4" sections. Two types of materials were<br>
investigated: a black "acrylic" plastic and a gray "PVC" (polyvinyl chloride) plastic. Each test<br>
treatment was conducted at least on duplicate samples. <br>
[00181] The plastic panels were cut, and cleaned briefly by wiping with a paper towel<br>
moistened with isopropanol (IPA). After drying completely, the panels were treated with the<br>
aerosol formulation sprayed from a distance of 6" for 3 seconds, with the panels in a horizontal<br>
position. The panels were then allowed to dry overnight, before testing.<br>
[00182] The behavior of several water drops placed on the surface in a horizontal position was<br>
tested comparing treated and untreated surfaces as control. Surface behavior of several water<br>
droplets on the treated surfaces of the black acrylic plastic achieved a Roll-off test rating of 2,<br>
while the untreated acrylic control exhibited a rating of 6, even though the water did not "wet"<br>
the surface of the untreated hydrophobic plastic. Surface behavior of several water droplets on<br>
the treated surfaces of the gray PVC plastic also achieved a Roll-off test rating of 2, while the<br>
untreated PVC control exhibited a rating of 6. The uniformity appearance ratings of both the<br>
treated acrylic test panel, and the treated PVC panel both gave a rating of 2 in comparison to<br>
their respective controls, thus providing a clear, invisible protective coating on the plastic<br>
surfaces.<br>
[00183] To test the removability of the inventive treatment from these plastic treatments, the<br>
treated panels were wiped three times with a dry paper towel and retested as to their water roll-of<br>
properties. As with the wood paneling, behavior reverted to that observed on the original<br>
untreated panels. This further demonstrates the utility of the inventive treatment compositions in<br><br><br>
providing non-durable protection to plastic surfaces and materials. In addition, the easy removal<br>
of the treatment without special chemical means is also demonstrated on these materials.<br>
Textile Surface Modification<br>
[00184] Example embodiments of the present invention were also tested for their ability to<br>
impart water roll-off properties to woven porous textiles typically used in the manufacture of<br>
clothing.<br>
[00185] In this example, testing employed approximately 3" x 5" swatches of white (undyed<br>
and non-brightened) 100% cotton fabric, white 100% Nylon 6.6 knit fabric, white 50-50 (%)<br>
cotton-polyester fabric, navy colored 100% Dacron 56 polyester texturized double knit heat set<br>
fabric dyed with Disperse Blue 167, Style No. TIC-720H and a dark blue colored 100% nylon<br>
texturized Nylon 6.6 knit fabric dyed with Acid Blue 113, Style No. TIC-314, all obtained from<br>
Textile Innovators Co., Windsor NC.<br>
[00186] The swatches were hung vertically and then treated with the same inventive aerosol<br>
treatment composition as used above to treat plastic substrates. Treatment was accomplished by<br>
spraying the fabrics at a distance of 6 inches for about 3 seconds each, after which the swatches<br>
were allowed to dry overnight under ambient conditions. Three swatches of each type were<br>
treated, and the results obtained from each replicate were averaged.<br>
[00187] The ability of the inventive treatment to produce water roll-off from the swatches was<br>
tested as follows. The swatches were placed on a hard flat surface which was inclined from the<br>
horizontal by about 20°. Using a pipette, 6 drops of de-ionized water (approximately 200<br>
microliters each) were allowed to fall onto the swatch from a height of 6 inches. In this manner,<br>
the effect of the momentum of the falling drops on their ability to wet and penetrate the swatches<br>
is compared. Simple placement of the water drops onto fabric swatches can sometimes yield<br>
false positives, in that the water droplets tend to remain on the surface for a variable and non-<br><br>
reproducible period of time before finally wicking into, or through the fabric. It was thus found<br>
that with some momentum, the force of the water drop impacting the surface of the fabric results<br>
in the fabric exhibiting its ultimate water wicking, and/or water resistive nature more<br>
reproducibly for the purposes of test comparisons.<br>
[00188] Fabrics with and without the inventive treatment were tested by the above method, and<br>
a Repellency Score was assigned by visually observing and counting the number of repetitive<br>
water droplets impacting on the same spot of the fabric required to produce wetting of the fabric<br>
at that spot. The Repellency Score is the average number of water drops out of 18 (6 drops, three<br>
replicates of each swatch) that rolled off the fabric without sticking or wicking into the fabric.<br>
Thus, treatments with higher scores represent the ability of the fabric to resist wetting by water<br>
and repel water droplets. Fabric test results are presented in Table 15.<br><br>
[00189] Results show that the inventive treatment compositions are most effective on porous<br>
textile materials having at least some synthetic fibers present, as performance on the 100%<br>
cotton (a natural, fairly hydrophilic biopolymer) was marginal at best in repelling water<br>
following treatment.<br><br>
[00190] The white fabrics were used to screen for any negative effects of the inventive<br>
treatments on yellowing or staining the fabrics. No yellowing or staining of the white fabrics<br>
was observed. The dark blue fabrics were used to observe whether use of the inventive<br>
treatments resulted in any appearance of visual fading, discoloration or greying of the fabrics.<br>
No fading, discoloration or greying effects were noted after application to the dark fabrics. It<br>
was noted however that use of the inventive treatments on dark fabrics was observed to make<br>
them very slightly darker in appearance when observed side by side with an untreated fabric test<br>
swatch. Colorimetric measurements revealed that use of the inventive treatments yielded a Delta<br>
L value well below 3 units, and with the dark fabrics a small negative Delta L value was<br>
observed, corresponding to the very slightly darker appearance noted by eye. This effect, though<br>
slight, is generally beneficially perceived as a color enhancement on darker fabrics, since fading<br>
due to wear, abrasion, washing, surface fiber damage and subsequent dye loss, otherwise<br>
produces changes in L resulting in larger positive Delta L changes, generally observable by eye<br>
when positive Delta L values exceed a value of greater than 5, the effect generally being<br>
attributed to overall "fading." Thus, the inventive treatment compositions tend to exhibit a slight<br>
anti-fading benefit on darker fabrics, and are essentially invisible on white and lighter-colored<br>
fabrics when applied according to the methods of application described herein.<br><br><br><br>
[00191] These last few examples further demonstrate the utility of the inventive treatment<br>
compositions to be used to treat a wide variety of both hard, non-porous materials such as<br>
plastics, wood, metal painted paneling, chrome and the like, as well as porous materials such as<br>
textiles, and to provide clear, protective coatings that repel water and dirt readily from the<br>
surfaces of the treated materials, substrates and articles treated according to the methods<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
[00192] While the present invention has been shown and described in accordance with practical<br>
and preferred embodiments thereof, it is recognized that departures from the instant disclosure<br>
are contemplated within the spirit of the invention and, therefore, the scope of the invention<br>
