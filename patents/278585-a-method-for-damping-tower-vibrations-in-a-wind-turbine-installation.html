				<td>A method for damping tower vibrations in a wind turbine installation<br>
The present method concerns a method in connection with a wind turbine installation for damping tower vibrations, in particular a floating wind turbine installation. The wind turbine installation comprises a floating cell, a tower arranged over the floating cell, a generator mounted on the tower that is rotatable in relation to the wind direction and fitted with a wind turbine, and an anchor line arrangement connected to anchors or foundations on the sea bed.<br>
The development of floating, anchored wind turbines that can be used at great depths<br>
will strongly enhance access to areas for the expansion of wind energy at sea. Current<br>
technology for wind turbines located at sea is considerably limited to permanently<br>
installed towers at low depths, under approximately 30 m.<br>
Permanent installations at depths over 30 m generally result in technical problems and<br>
high costs. This has meant that, until now, sea depths of more than around 30 m have<br>
been regarded as technically and commercially unfavourable for the installation of wind<br>
turbines.<br>
With floating solutions at greater sea depths, the foundation problem and costs<br>
associated with complicated, labour-intensive installations can be avoided.<br>
A wind turbine that is mounted on a floating foundation will move on account of the<br>
forces from the wind and waves. A good wind turbine foundation design will ensure that<br>
the system's eigenperiods for rigid cell movements (surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and<br>
yaw) are outside the period range for sea waves, which is approximately 5-20<br>
seconds.<br>
There will still be forces that act in connection with the eigenperiods for the system (swell, non-linear wave forces, fluctuations in wind speed, current forces, etc.). If such<br>
 <br>
forces are not to produce unacceptable movements, they must not be too large, and the<br>
system must have damping for the relevant periods.<br>
The present invention represents a solution, more precisely a method, for effective<br>
damping of tower vibrations for wind turbine installations. The results produced in<br>
simulation tests show that vibrations in connection with the system's eigenperiod were<br>
damped by a factor of approximately 10 using the method in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention is characterised by the features as defined in the attached<br>
independent claim 1.<br>
Dependent claims 2 - 8 define advantageous features of the present invention.<br>
The present invention will be described in further detail in the following using examples and with reference to the attached drawings, where:<br>

Figs. 9-10 show diagrams based on simulation tests, with and without a stabiliser, in connection with, respectively, horizontal displacement of the top of the tower, ziZ, and active power (pu) supplied to the grid at a mean wind velocity of 20.04 m/sec,<br>
Fig. 11	shows a general diagram of a wind turbine including the stabiliser in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
When the wind acts on a wind turbine installation, the forces from the wind will contribute to movements in the foundation. However, the forces from the wind turbine depend on how the turbine is controlled, i.e. how the RPM and the pitch of the turbine blades vary with wind velocity. The control algorithms will vary with the wind velocity. A typical control philosophy for land-based wind turbines is shown in Fig. 1. With reference to this Figure, it can be seen that:<br>
•   In the startup range, small forces act on the wind turbine. The wind forces will have little effect on the movements. If the movements are affected by the wind<br>
forces, it is possible to control the turbine approximately as in the variable RPM range.<br>
•	In the variable RPM range, there is an approximately constant pitch angle for the turbine blades. The aim is to control the RPM for the turbine so that maximum power can be produced at any time, given the momentary relative wind velocity against the turbine. The relative wind velocity consists of mean wind velocity, variation in wind velocity and the movement (velocity) of the tower. This means that there will be increased power and increased thrust from the turbine when the wind increases. In turn, if the system (the wind turbine, including the foundation) moves against the wind with a combined pitch and surge movement, this entails increased wind velocity for the turbine, and the thrust increases. This is equivalent to a damping force (a force that acts against the velocity). In this wind velocity range, the wind forces on the turbine will therefore contribute positive damping to the system. This will contribute to reduced movements in connection with the system's eigenperiods.<br>
•	In the constant moment range, the turbine's rated power is reached. It is then usual to maintain approximately constant RPM and control the moment and thus the power by regulating the pitch angle of the turbine blades. The aim is to maintain approximately constant power. If the wind velocity increases, the pitch angle is increased in order to reduce the moment. This also produces reduced thrust despite the increased wind velocity. Unlike that which happens in the variable RPM range, the result is thus a negative damping effect. A standard control system will try to adjust all power variations that are due to changes in the relative wind velocity against the turbine. This is done by changing the blades' pitch angle so that the moment on the turbine is kept constant despite the variation in relative velocity. This will result in the wind turbine contributing negative system damping,  which thus increases the tower's movement in<br>
connection  with  the eigenperiods.     This  can  produce  unacceptably large movements.<br>
With the present invention, it has been found that the control algorithms must be modified to prevent the negative link between control of the wind turbines and the system's movements.<br>
It is desirable to maintain approximately constant RPM and the moment in the "constant moment" range, but, using appropriate filtering and control algorithms, that will be described in further detail in the following, the turbine is still prevented from supplying negative damping in connection with resonance. In fact, the control philosophy outlined will supply positive damping in connection with resonance and thus reduce the system's movements. The control philosophy in accordance with the present invention will otherwise only result in minor fluctuations in power produced. This is demonstrated by numerical simulations. Moreover, the reduced movements will significantly contribute to reduced load on the wind turbine and the tower structure.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section of a blade angle controller, with proportional and integral control<br>
(PI), and a sketch of the transfer function.<br>
Hp.AZ_dot(s), between the blade angle, fi, and the horizontal tower velocity. This is the<br>
change required in the turbine blade angle to maintain constant power on the turbine<br>
when the relative velocity changes.<br>
A vibration in j8 that has a frequency equal to the eigenfrequency ωeig of the tower<br>
vibrations   will,    via   the   transfer   function    Hß-ΔZ-dot(s),    result   in   the   tower's<br>
movement AZ given by the amplification and phase of Hß-ΔZ-dot(s) for ωeig It is given that:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
To  damp  the  vibrations  in  ß with  frequency    ωeig  it  is   possible  to  design   a<br>
stabiliser with the transfer function Hstab(s) between AZ and A|3 that is such that the loop transfer function H ß-ΔZ-dot (jωeig)Hstab (jωeig)  -b. This means that:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where "b" is a variable control amplifier. This is selected on the basis of obtaining best possible damping of the tower ocillations and at the same time avoiding unwanted exitation of other eigenfrequncis depending on the turbine blade momentum and thrust characteristic.<br>
Such a transfer function will ensure that the blade angle is not adjusted for the velocity fluctuations that occur in connection with the tower's eigenfrequency. This will produce frequency-dependent damping. In connection with the tower's eigenfrequency, this damping will be equivalent to the damping produced with a constant pitch system. If the amplification is increased, the damping can be increased further. If it is reduced, the damping will be reduced until we reach a limit at approximately zero damping contribution.<br>
To ensure that the stabiliser does not have an unwanted effect on j3 at frequencies that are considerably different from the eigenfrequency of the tower vibrations, it is important for Hstab(s) to have necessary filters that filter these frequencies (see the later section).<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of the transfer function between the blade angle and the tower velocity as well as the transfer function for a stabiliser that damps vibrations with the eigenfrequency of the tower vibrations.<br>
 <br>
If we take a closer look at the system shown in Fig. 3 and call the signal that comes in from the left (variation in blade angle) ß0, we can set up the expression for the tower<br>
vibrations ΔZas<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
For the tower vibrations we then get:<br>
<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 <br>
Here, H,is(s) is the transfer function for the closed loop, including the stabiliser, from/30 to AZ.<br>
Additional damping that damps the tower vibrations at a given frequency^ can be designed by making:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
It should be noted that any stabiliser designed according to the criteria in (2.3) that will reduce the tower vibrations will not necessarily supply the system with enough damping to make it stable. Therefore, in addition, it is necessary to demand that the system is stable when selecting the controller parameters for the turbine in question.<br>
 <br>
An example was based on the tower vibrations' eigenfrequency, coeig, being approximately equal to 0.5 radians/second (feig =0.0795 Hz), i.e. on a vibration of the tower having a period of approximately 12.57 s. The stabiliser in accordance with the present invention, which was created to damp the tower vibrations that vibrate with the eigenfrequency, then had a transfer function as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
A Bode plot of this transfer function is shown in Fig. 5. The Figure shows the frequency response of the designed stabiliser. The arrows define amplitude and phase in connection with the eigenfrequency of the tower dynamics.<br>
In the elementary diagram shown in Fig. 6, the stabiliser solution is included in the control solution in accordance with the present invention, and the Figure shows how the output signal from the stabiliser is designed to modulate the turbine's blade angle, /3. The principle of the solution in accordance with the present invention is thus to damp the tower's eigenvibrations by controlling the blade angle of the turbine blades so that the eigenvibrations are counteracted. The stabiliser is designed so that it only has to affect the blade angle in the frequency range near the tower vibrations' eigenfrequency, coeig.. A high-pass filter ensures that no (zero) amplification is provided at low frequencies, and a low-pass filter ensures that no (zero) amplification is provided at high frequencies. Moreover, a phase-compensating filter must be tuned so that the phase distortion in the<br>
stabiliser is such that additional damping, Δß (+ or -), damps the vibrations in AZthat are caused by the tower vibrations' eigenfrequency, ωeig. . In other words, this means that the blade angle is affected by an amplitude and phase in relation to the tower's<br>
velocity AZ in such a way that it damps the vibrations in the tower that have frequency<br>
COeig.<br>
Using the stabiliser leads to the turbine experiencing a relative wind velocity with greatly reduced influence from the tower's eigenvibrations in relation to a situation in which the stabiliser is not used. In addition, the tower will physically vibrate much less when a stabiliser is used.<br>
 <br>
Simulation tests.<br>
On the basis of the control solution as described above, simulation tests were carried out for two wind series with a mean wind velocity of 17.43 m/sec. and 20.04 m/sec. These velocities were selected because the need for damping is greatest at such high wind velocities, i.e. when the turbines are operated in constant power mode.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 show a selection of results from the simulation of wind series at 17.43 m/sec. with and without stabilisers for damping tower vibrations.<br>
Fig. 7 shows that there are considerable tower vibrations when the turbine runs in constant power mode and the stabiliser is not used. This also results in large fluctuations in power supplied to the grid (see Fig. 8). The high amplitudes in the tower vibrations can be explained as follows:<br>
In the constant RPM range, the thrust is reduced when the wind velocity increases. If the tower assumes a rearward velocity, the relative wind velocity that the tower experiences will be reduced. The blade angle (pitch) will be adjusted (increased) to maintain the moment and thus constant power. Thus the thrust will also increase despite the reduced relative wind velocity. Accordingly, when the tower moves at a velocity against the wind direction, the relative wind velocity will increase. The blade angle (pitch) will be adjusted (reduced) to reduce the moment. This will also reduce the thrust. This method of regulating the turbine will thus produce a variation in the thrust that acts in the same direction as the tower movement. I.e. negative damping. This will result in an amplification of the tower movement, in particular near the tower's resonance period in which the movement is controlled by damping. These are the tower vibrations that the stabiliser described above was designed to damp. In the example in question, the vibrations are so large that, even if the turbine runs in constant power mode, it is not able to supply constant power, Fig. 8.<br>
If the stabiliser in accordance with the present invention is used, Fig. 7 shows that the tower vibrations are damped well, and Fig. 8 shows that the power variation is also<br>
 <br>
considerably reduced. The stabiliser thus produces the desired effect. In parts of the simulation, the amplitude of the tower vibrations is reduced from over 10 m without a stabiliser to under 1 m with a stabiliser.<br>
Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the results for the case with 20.04 m/sec. wind velocity. It can be seen that the turbine supplies approximately constant power without a stabiliser, Fig. 9, but that the tower vibrations gradually build up to large fluctuations, Fig. 10. If a stabiliser is used, the power remains approximately constant, while a considerable reduction in the tower movement is achieved.<br>

In short, the stabiliser acts by receiving the signal associated with the change in tower<br>
velocity, ΔZ, from a sensor (not shown) in the form of an accelerometer or similar. The signal is "processed" by the stabiliser, which emits a new signal to a controller for the rotor blades to change the pitch angle,Δß, of the blades to achieve the desired damping of the vibrations in the tower as described above.<br>
The invention, as it is defined in the claims, is not limited to the examples described above. Therefore, the pitch of the turbine blades of the wind turbine may be controlled jointly, i.e. the same pitch angle, p, for all blades, or individually with a different pitch angle for each blade.<br>
Moreover, although the present invention has been specifically developed for floating wind turbine installations, it may also be used for wind turbine towers in which the flexibility in the tower as such is relatively high, or a combination of a floating wind turbine installation and a flexible tower.<br>
