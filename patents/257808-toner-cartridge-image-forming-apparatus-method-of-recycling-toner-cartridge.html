DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
recycling toner cartridges of image forming apparatuses.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Image forming apparatuses generally employ an<br>
electrophotography method or a direct recording method to<br>
form toner images on a recording medium. Copiers,<br>
facsimile machines, printers are the examples of an image<br>
forming apparatus.<br>
In the electrophotography method, a toner image is<br>
formed first on a latent image carrier, such as a<br>
photosensitive drum, and then the toner image is<br>
transferred to a recording medium. Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-open Publication No. 2002-307737<br>
describes the direct recording method. In the direct<br>
recording medium, a toner image is directly formed on a<br>
recording medium.<br>
Because toner is consumed as images are formed, it is<br>
necessary to periodically replenish the toner. In<br>
general, when replenishing the toner, the old and empty<br>
toner cartridge is replaced with a new and full toner<br>
cartridge. To reduce the frequency of replacement of the<br>
toner cartridge, it is better that the toner cartridges<br>
have a larger capacity to accommodate the toner. Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2004-18138<br>
and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No.<br>
2004-139031 disclose various toner cartridges.<br>
FIG. 16 is a schematic of a toner replenishing unit of<br>
an image forming apparatus described in Japanese Patent<br><br>
Application Laid-open Publication No. 2004-18138. In this<br>
conventional art, the toner cartridge is set vertically in<br>
the image forming apparatus. However, this structure<br>
limits the freedom of layout.<br>
FIG. 17 is a perspective view of a toner cartridge<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open<br>
Publication No. 2004-139031. This toner cartridge is set<br>
horizontally in an image forming apparatus. However, this<br>
toner cartridge can be attached or detached only from the<br>
upper side of the image forming apparatus.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

A second object is to provide a toner cartridge that is<br>
configured to prevent misalignment of the receptacle<br>
holding member due to the rotation of the toner<br>
receptacle, and that can be set not only vertically but<br>
also horizontally.<br>
A third object is to provide a toner cartridge that is<br>
configured to discharge a stable amount of toner to the<br>
image forming apparatus, and that can be set not only<br>
vertically but also horizontally so as to allow freedom in<br>

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described below with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
The present invention is not limited to these embodiments.<br>
An embodiment of an electrophotographic printer<br>
(hereinafter, "printer") is described below as an image<br>
forming apparatus to which the present embodiment is<br>
applied.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic of an internal structure of the<br>
printer. The printer includes four process cartridges 1Y,<br>
1M, 1C, and 1K for creating toner images of yellow,<br>
magenta, cyan, and black (hereinafter, "Y, M, C, and K")<br>
colors, respectively. The process cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C,<br>
and 1K use toner of different colors Y, M, C, and K, , but<br>
have the same structure, and are replaced when they reach<br>
their end of life.<br>
The process cartridge 1Y for creating a Y toner image<br>
is taken as an example in FIG. 2. The process cartridge<br>
1Y includes a photosensitive drum 2Y, a drum cleaning unit<br>
3Y, a decharging unit (not shown), a charging unit 4Y, and<br>
a developing unit 5Y. The process cartridge 1Y is<br>
detachable from the printer, and consumables can be<br>
replaced. The process cartridges 1M, 1C, and 1K also<br>
include photosensitive drums 2M, 2C, and 2K, respectively.<br>
The charging unit 4Y uniformly charges a surface of the<br>
photosensitive drum 2Y that is rotated in a clockwise<br>
direction by a driving unit (not shown) . The charging<br>
unit ' 4Y charges the photosensitive drum 2Y by causing a<br>
charging roller 6Y, which is driven and rotated in a<br>
counterclockwise direction, to contact the photosensitive<br>
drum 2Y, and applying a charging bias by a power supply<br><br>
(not shown). A charging brush can be employed to contact<br>
the photosensitive drum 2Y, instead of the charging roller<br>
6Y. Moreover, the charging unit 4Y can be a scortoron<br>
charger that performs a non-contact charging process on<br>
the photosensitive drum. The charged surface of the<br>
photosensitive drum 2Y is scanned by being exposed to a<br>
laser light emitted from an optical writing unit, so as to<br>
hold an electrostatic latent image for Y.<br>
The developing unit 5Y includes a first developer<br>
accommodating section 8Y in which a first transporting<br>
screw 7Y is disposed. Moreover, the developing unit 5Y<br>
has a second developer accommodating section 13Y equipped<br>
with a toner density sensor (hereinafter, "T sensor") 9Y<br>
formed by a magnetic permeability sensor, a second<br>
transporting screw 10Y, a developing roll 11Y, and a<br>
doctor blade 12Y. These two developer accommodating<br>
sections accommodate a Y developer (not shown), composed<br>
of a magnetic carrier and negatively charged Y toner. The<br>
first transporting screw 7Y carries the developer Y inside<br>
the first developer accommodating section 8Y from a front<br>
side as viewed in the diagram to a back side by being<br>
driven and rotated by a driving unit (not shown) . The<br>
developer Y then enters into the second developer<br>
accommodating section 13Y through a continuous opening<br>
(not shown) provided in a partition wall between the first<br>
developer accommodating section 8Y and the second<br>
developer accommodating section 13Y. The second<br>
transporting screw 10Y in the second developer<br>
accommodating section 13Y carries the developer Y from the<br>
front side as viewed in the diagram to the back side by<br>
being driven and rotated by a driving unit (not shown) .<br>
Toner density of the developer Y being carried is detected<br><br>
by the T sensor 9Y fixed at a bottom of the second<br>
developer accommodating section 13Y. Thus, on an upper<br>
side of the second transporting screw 10Y, the developing<br>
roll 11Y including a magnet roller 15Y inside a non-<br>
magnetic pipe 14Y, driven and rotated in the<br>
counterclockwise direction, is disposed in parallel. The<br>
developer Y carried by the second transporting screw 10Y<br>
is drawn up on a surface of the non-magnetic pipe 14Y by a<br>
magnetic force generated by the magnet roller 15Y. Then,<br>
after the thickness of a layer of the developer Y is<br>
regulated by the doctor blade 12Y disposed with a<br>
predetermined distance between the non-magnetic pipe 14Y,<br>
the developer Y is carried up to a developing area facing<br>
the photosensitive drum 2Y, and the toner Y adheres to the<br>
electrostatic latent image for Y on the photosensitive<br>
drum 2Y. Accordingly, a Y toner image is formed on the<br>
photosensitive drum 2Y. The Y developer in which the Y<br>
toner has been consumed by developing is returned to the<br>
second transporting screw 10Y by rotation of the non-<br>
magnetic pipe 14Y. As the Y developer is carried up to a<br>
front side as viewed in the diagram, it returns to the<br>
first developer accommodating section 8Y through the<br>
continuous opening.<br>
A detection result of the magnetic permeability of the<br>
Y developer by the T sensor 9Y is transmitted as a voltage<br>
signal to a controlling section (not shown). Since the<br>
magnetic permeability of the Y developer is correlated<br>
with the toner density of the Y developer, the T sensor<br>
outputs a voltage of a value corresponding to the toner<br>
density of the Y toner. The controlling section is<br>
equipped with a Random Access Memory (RAM) that stores<br>
data of Vtref for Y that is a target value of the output<br><br>
voltage from the T sensor 9Y, and of Vtref for M, Vtref<br>
for C, and Vtref for K, which are target values of the<br>
output voltage from the T sensor 9Y for the M, C, and K<br>
installed in the other developing units. The developing<br>
unit 5Y compares the value of the output voltage from the<br>
T sensor 9Y and the Vtref for Y, and drives a toner<br>
supplying unit for Y, for a time corresponding to a result<br>
of comparison. Accordingly, an appropriate amount of the<br>
Y toner is supplied in the first developer accommodating<br>
section 8Y for the Y developer, in which the density of<br>
the Y toner has reduced by consumption. Therefore, the<br>
density of the Y toner of the Y developer in the second<br>
developer accommodating section 13Y is maintained in a<br>
predetermined range. A similar toner supply control is<br>
performed for the developers of the process cartridges<br>
(1M, 1C, and 1K) for other colors.<br>
The Y toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 2Y<br>
is subjected to an intermediate- transfer to an<br>
intermediate transfer belt. The drum cleaning unit 3Y<br>
removes toner remaining on the surface of the<br>
photosensitive drum 2Y after the intermediate transfer<br>
process. The surface of the photosensitive drum 2Y is<br>
decharged by the decharging unit. Due to the decharging,<br>
the surface of the photosensitive drum 2Y is initialized<br>
and is ready for the next image formation. In the process<br>
cartridges 1M, 1C, and 1K shown in FIG. 1 M, C, and K<br>
toner images are similarly formed on photosensitive drums<br>
2M, 2C, and 2K, and are transferred to the intermediate<br>
transfer belt.<br>
In FIG. 1, beneath the process cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C,<br>
and 1K, an optical writing unit 20 is disposed. The<br>
optical writing unit 20, which is a latent-image forming<br><br>
unit, radiates a laser beam L based on image information<br>
on each photosensitive drum in each of the process<br>
cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1K. Thus, electrostatic latent<br>
images for Y, M, C, and K are formed on the photosensitive<br>
drums 2Y, 2M, 2C, and 2K, respectively. The optical<br>
writing unit 20 deflects the laser beam L emitted from a<br>
light source by a polygon mirror 21 driven and rotated by<br>
a motor, and radiates the laser beam L on the<br>
photosensitive drums 2Y, 2M, 2C, and 2K.<br>
Beneath the optical writing unit 20, a first paper<br>
feeding cassette 31 and a second paper feeding cassette 32<br>
are disposed such that they overlap in a vertical<br>
direction. In each of these paper feeding cassettes,<br>
sheets of transfer paper P are stacked. A first paper<br>
feeding roller 31a and a second paper feeding roller 32a<br>
are in contact with a top sheet of transfer paper P in the<br>
first paper feeding cassette 31 and the second paper<br>
feeding cassette 32, respectively. When the first paper<br>
feeding roller 31a is driven and rotated in a<br>
counterclockwise direction by a driving unit (not shown),<br>
the transfer paper P at the top in the first paper feeding<br>
cassette 31 is discharged towards a paper feeding passage<br>
33 arranged along a vertical direction on the right side<br>
of the cassettes as viewed in the diagram. Moreover, when<br>
the second paper feeding roller 32a is driven and rotated<br>
in a counterclockwise direction by a driving unit (not<br>
shown) , the transfer paper P at the top in the second<br>
paper feeding cassette 32 is discharged towards the paper<br>
feeding passage 33. A plurality of pairs of transporting<br>
rollers 34 are disposed along the paper feeding passage<br>
33, and the transfer paper P fed to the paper feeding<br>
passage 33 is pinched between these pairs of transporting<br><br>
rollers 34 and is carried towards an upper side of the<br>
paper feeding passage 33.<br>
At a tail end of the paper feeding passage 33 a pair of<br>
registering rollers 35 is disposed. As the transfer paper<br>
P that is fed by the pair of transporting rollers 34 is<br>
pinched between the pair of registering rollers 35, the<br>
rotation of both the rollers stops for a time. Then, the<br>
pair of registering rollers 35 transfers the transfer<br>
paper P at an appropriate timing towards a secondary<br>
transfer nip.<br>
Above the process cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1K is<br>
provided an intermediate transferring unit 40 including an<br>
intermediate transfer belt 41 that moves endlessly in the<br>
counterclockwise direction. The intermediate transferring<br>
unit 40 further includes a belt cleaning unit 42, a first<br>
bracket 43, a second bracket 44, four primary transfer<br>
rollers 45Y, 45M, 45C, and 45K, a secondary transfer back-<br>
up roller 46, a drive roller 47, an auxiliary roller 48,<br>
and a tension roller 49. The intermediate transfer belt<br>
41 is stretched over these eight rollers, and moves in the<br>
counterclockwise direction by being driven and rotated by<br>
the drive roller 47. The intermediate transfer belt 41 is<br>
pinched between the four primary transfer rollers 45Y,<br>
45M, 45C, and 45K and the photosensitive drums 2Y, 2M, 2C,<br>
and 2K, forming primary transfer nips, respectively. On a<br>
reverse face (peripheral surface inside the loop) of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 41, a transfer bias of a<br>
polarity opposite to that of the toner (for example,<br>
positive") is applied. As the intermediate transfer belt<br>
41 passes over the primary transfer nips for the Y, M, C,<br>
and K one after another, the Y, M, C, and K toner images<br>
on the photosensitive drums 2Y, 2M, 2C, and 2K are<br><br>
superimposed and transferred on a front face of the<br>
intermediate transfer belt 41. Thus, a four-color<br>
superimposed toner image (hereinafter, "four-color toner<br>
image") is formed on the intermediate transfer belt 41.<br>
The secondary transfer back-up roller 46 forms a<br>
secondary transfer nip by pinching the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 41 with a secondary transfer roller 50 that<br>
is disposed on an outer side of the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 41. The pair of registering rollers 35 described<br>
earlier feeds the transfer paper P towards the secondary<br>
transfer nip at a timing synchronized with the four-color<br>
toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 41. The<br>
four-color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt<br>
41 is subjected to a secondary transfer, so as to be<br>
transferred to the transfer paper P at the secondary<br>
transfer nip. The secondary transfer is performed by nip<br>
pressure and a secondary transfer electric field formed<br>
between the secondary transfer back-up roller 46 and the<br>
secondary transfer roller 50 applied with a secondary<br>
transfer bias. Combined with a white color of the<br>
transfer paper, the four-color toner image becomes a full-<br>
color toner image.<br>
Toner remaining after the secondary transfer is adhered<br>
to the intermediate transfer belt 41 after passing through<br>
the secondary transfer nip. This toner is cleaned by the<br>
belt cleaning unit 42.<br>
Above the secondary transfer nip, a fixing unit 6 0<br>
including a pressurizing roller 61 and a fixing belt unit<br>
62 is disposed. The fixing belt unit 62 includes a fixing<br>
belt 64 that moves endlessly in the counterclockwise<br>
direction, being stretched over a heating roller 63, a<br>
tension roller 65, and a drive roller 66. The heating<br><br>
roller 63 includes a heat generating source such as a<br>
halogen lamp and heats up the fixing belt 64 from a<br>
reverse side. The pressurizing roller 61 is driven and<br>
rotated in the clockwise direction, and is brought in<br>
contact with a front face of the fixing belt 64, opposite<br>
to the heating roller 63. Thus, a fixing nip is formed<br>
between the pressurizing roller 61 and the heating roller<br>
63.<br>
The transfer paper P that passes the secondary transfer<br>
nip, after being separated from the intermediate transfer<br>
belt 41, is fed into the fixing unit 60. When it is<br>
carried from the lower side towards the upper side in the<br>
diagram while being pinched in the fixing nip, it is<br>
heated by the fixing belt 64, and pressurized, so that the<br>
full-color toner image is fixed onto the transfer paper P.<br>
After the fixing process, the transfer paper P is<br>
discharged out from the printer after passing through a<br>
pair of discharge rollers 67. On an upper surface of a<br>
casing of the printer, there is a stacking section 68, and<br>
the transfer paper P discharged from the printer by the<br>
pair of discharge rollers 67 is stacked one after another<br>
in the stacking section 68.<br>
On an upper side of the intermediate transferring unit<br>
40, four toner cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C, and 100K that<br>
accommodate Y, M, C, and K toners are disposed. The Y, M,<br>
C, and K toners in the toner cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C,<br>
and 100K are supplied to the developing units of the<br>
processing cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1K. Each of these<br>
toner cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C, and 100K are detachable<br>
from the process cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C, and 1K,<br>
respectively.<br>
In the printer, the four process cartridges 1Y, 1M, 1C,<br><br>
and 1K, the optical writing unit 20, and the intermediate<br>
transferring unit 40 etc. form a toner-image forming unit<br>
that forms a toner image on transfer paper.<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y. The toner cartridge 100Y includes a<br>
bottle 101Y that accommodates Y toner (not shown) and a<br>
cylinder shaped holder 102Y. The holder 102Y is engaged<br>
with a front end of the bottle 101Y such that it covers an<br>
opening at a front end of the bottle 101Y, and holds the<br>
bottle 101Y so that the bottle 101Y can rotate. A<br>
protrusion 103Y in a form of a screw protrudes from an<br>
outer side towards an inner side of the bottle 101Y, along<br>
its peripheral surface. When the bottle 101Y is rotated<br>
by a drive system (not shown), Y toner in the bottle 101Y<br>
moves along the protrusion 103Y from a bottom of the<br>
bottle 101Y towards a front end side of the bottle 101Y.<br>
Then, the Y toner enters into the holder 102Y through the<br>
opening that is provided on the front end of the bottle<br>
101Y, which is a toner accommodating receptacle.<br>
On an end face of the holder 102Y in an axial direction<br>
of the bottle, a nozzle receiving opening 109Y is formed.<br>
This nozzle receiving opening 109Y is for receiving a<br>
suction nozzle, which is fixed to a side of the printer.<br>
On both sides of the nozzle receiving opening 109Y, there<br>
are positioning-pin receiving openings HOY, each having a<br>
diameter slightly smaller than that of the nozzle<br>
receiving opening. These positioning-pin receiving<br>
openings HOY are formed at a position shifted from an<br>
axis of rotation of the bottle 101Y. Moreover, a pin<br>
insertion passage (not shown) is formed inside each of the<br>
positioning-pin receiving openings HOY, extending along a<br>
direction parallel to the direction of axis of rotation of<br><br>
the bottle 101Y. The bottle 101Y is made of a resin<br>
material having high rigidity, so as not to be deformed by<br>
an impact when rotated by a driving gear.<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing a cartridge<br>
engaging section 71Y that is a part of a toner<br>
replenishing unit (described later). This cartridge<br>
engaging section 71Y is fixed on an upper end of a<br>
transporting pipe 72Y for carrying Y toner such that a<br>
suction nozzle 73Y that is a pipe member extends in a<br>
horizontal direction. On a front end portion of the<br>
suction nozzle 73Y, a toner receiving opening 74Y for<br>
receiving Y toner is formed. Moreover, on both sides of<br>
the suction nozzle 73Y, positioning pins 75Y in the form<br>
of a rod are formed, and fixed so that they extend in the<br>
horizontal direction (a direction parallel to the axis of<br>
rotation of the bottle) . A front end portion of the<br>
positioning pin 75Y that is a protrusion of the cartridge<br>
engaging section 71Y, which is a positioning member,<br>
sticks out further than the front end of the suction<br>
nozzle 73Y. Cartridge engaging sections 71M, 71C, and 71K<br>
for the colors other than Y have the same configuration as<br>
the cartridge engaging section 71Y, and also include<br>
transporting pipes 72M, 72C, and 72K, respectively.<br>
When setting the toner cartridge 100Y shown in FIG. 3<br>
on a toner replenishing unit, the two positioning pins 75Y<br>
of the cartridge engaging section 71Y shown in FIG. 4 are<br>
inserted into the two positioning-pin receiving openings<br>
HOY of the holder 102Y. Thus, the toner cartridge for Y<br>
is fixed not only to the toner replenishing unit but also<br>
to the printer. The suction nozzle 73Y shown in FIG. 4 is<br>
inserted into the nozzle receiving opening 109Y of the<br>
toner cartridge for Y shown in FIG. 3.<br><br>
FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view of the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y. The holder 102Y that is a receptacle<br>
holding member of the toner cartridge 100Y includes an<br>
engaging section that engages with the bottle 101Y and a<br>
nozzle inserting section 104Y formed separately. The<br>
manufacturing process is facilitated as these sections are<br>
formed separately. Moreover, the engaging section has a<br>
cap 105Y that covers an opening (not shown) on a front end<br>
of the bottle 101Y while engaging with the bottle 101Y,<br>
and a toner storage section 106Y that temporarily stores<br>
the toner. The cylindrical toner storage section 106Y has<br>
a diameter smaller than an inner diameter of the<br>
cylindrical cap 105Y, so as to fit into the cap 105Y. An<br>
0 ring 107Y made of rubber, which is a non-porous<br>
material, is provided between the toner storage section<br>
106Y and the cap 105Y. This maintains a superior<br>
airtightness between an inner peripheral surface of the<br>
cap 105Y and an outer peripheral surface of the toner<br>
storage section 106Y.<br>
A dent is formed on a lower portion of the toner<br>
storage section 106Y, and the nozzle inserting section<br>
104Y is fitted in this dent. An 0 ring 108Y made of<br>
rubber, which is a non-porous material, is provided<br>
between the toner storage section 106Y and the nozzle<br>
inserting section 104Y. This maintains a high<br>
airtightness between a recessed inner peripheral surface<br>
of the toner storage section 106Y and a protruded outer<br>
peripheral surface for fitting the nozzle inserting<br>
section 104Y.<br>
FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing a front end of<br>
the toner cartridge 100Y before being set in the toner<br>
replenishing unit. A cylindrical front end portion of the<br><br>
bottle 101Y has a diameter smaller than that of a main<br>
unit of the bottle 101Y (hereinafter, "smaller portion"),<br>
and an opening is formed at a front end of this smaller<br>
portion. A gear 111Y having a gear wheel for engaging<br>
with a driving gear sticks out from a peripheral surface<br>
of the smaller portion. A hitching section 112Y that<br>
sticks out a little from an external peripheral surface of<br>
the smaller portion is formed ahead of the gear 111Y<br>
towards the front end side of the bottle 101Y. A<br>
cylindrical space for receiving the smaller portion of the<br>
bottle 101Y is formed in the cap 105Y of the holder 102Y.<br>
A protrusion 113Y sticks out from inner peripheral surface<br>
of the cap 105Y. The smaller portion is rotatably engaged<br>
into the cap 105Y, such that the hitching section 112Y<br>
passes over the protrusion 113Y to be hooked inside the<br>
cap 105Y.<br>
In the nozzle inserting section 104Y, a fitting<br>
protrusion sticks out from an upper surface of a nozzle in<br>
the form of a pipe, and this fitting protrusion is fitted<br>
to a bottom of the toner storage section 106Y inside the<br>
cap 105Y. A connecting passage 114Y is formed in the<br>
fitting protrusion, and this connecting passage 114Y<br>
connects to an insertion passage 115Y that extends in a<br>
direction parallel to the axial direction of the bottle<br>
101Y, in the nozzle. The connecting passage 114Y extends<br>
straight in a direction orthogonal to the direction of<br>
axis of rotation of the bottle 101Y, and therefore, the Y<br>
toner can drop by self-weight into the suction nozzle 73Y<br>
without being stagnated. A rod-shaped shutter member 116Y<br>
has the same diameter as that of the suction nozzle (73Y)<br>
is slidably inserted into the insertion passage 115Y.<br>
Accordingly, when the opening of the connecting passage<br><br>
114Y is closed by the shutter member 116Y and when the<br>
suction nozzle 73Y is inserted into the insertion passage<br>
115Y, the airtightness between an outside of the holder<br>
102Y and the connecting passage 114Y can be maintained the<br>
same. Thus, when the cartridge that has the suction<br>
nozzle 73Y inserted into the connecting passage 114Y is<br>
not set, it is possible to prevent toner from leaking<br>
outside from the toner storage section 106Y through the<br>
connecting passage 114Y. Furthermore, when the cartridge<br>
is set, deterioration in the transporting ability of toner<br>
by air suction is prevented effectively. Since the<br>
shutter member 116Y is positioned immediately under the<br>
connecting passage 114Y, the connecting passage 114Y and<br>
the insertion passage 115Y are shut from each other. An<br>
end of the insertion passage 115Y corresponds to the<br>
nozzle receiving opening 109Y shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The toner entering into the toner storage section 106Y<br>
from the smaller portion falls by self-weight and<br>
accumulates in the connecting passage 114Y of the nozzle<br>
inserting section 104Y. The fitting protrusion for<br>
fitting the nozzle inserting section 104Y into the toner<br>
storage section 106Y functions as a bottom of the toner<br>
storage section 106Y. Since the connecting passage 114Y<br>
of the fitting protrusion has a conical shape, it<br>
functions as a hopper that collects toner at the bottom<br>
due to a taper. Thus, the toner can drop smoothly. Since<br>
a front end of the connecting passage 114Y is closed by<br>
the shutter member 116Y, the toner does not flow in the<br>
insertion passage 115Y from the connecting passage 114Y.<br>
Moreover, toner is prevented from leaking out from the<br>
insertion passage 115Y before the toner cartridge 100Y is<br>
set. Furthermore, toner can flow in from the toner<br><br>
storage section 106Y to the suction nozzle 73Y, as the<br>
opening automatically opens when the cartridge is set.<br>
FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing a front end<br>
portion of the toner cartridge 100Y. In this diagram, for<br>
the sake of expediency, the cap (105Y) of the holder 102Y<br>
is omitted. A ring seal 118Y in the form of a ring made<br>
of sponge, which is a porous as well as elastic material,<br>
is fixed by sticking to an end portion of the side of the<br>
bottle 101Y in the toner storage section 106Y. As shown<br>
in FIG. 6, the front end of the bottle 101Y rotatably<br>
engaged with the cap 105Y abuts against the ring seal 118Y<br>
fixed to the end portion of the toner storage section<br>
106Y, so that the bottle 101Y is prevented from shifting.<br>
This improves the airtightness between an inner peripheral<br>
surface of the bottle 101Y that is a toner accommodating<br>
receptacle and an outer peripheral surface of the cap<br>
105Y.<br>
While setting the toner cartridge 100Y on a cartridge<br>
mounting platform of the toner replenishing unit, a door<br>
(not shown), provided on a side plate of the casing of the<br>
printer, is opened. As this door is opened, the cartridge<br>
mounting platform of the toner replenishing unit in the<br>
casing is exposed. The cartridge mounting platform is<br>
provided with four parallel dents in the form of a half<br>
cylinder for mounting parallel the four toner cartridges<br>
100Y, 100M, 100C, and 100K. An operator holds the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y such that the holder 102Y is positioned at<br>
a front end. Then, after mounting the holder 102Y on an<br>
end of the dent for Y from among the four half cylindrical<br>
shaped dents provided on the cartridge mounting platform,<br>
the entire cartridge is moved by sliding along the<br>
direction of axis of rotation of the bottle such that the<br><br>
entire cartridge is inserted. By this sliding movement,<br>
the toner cartridge 100Y is inserted up to a predetermined<br>
position and set on the cartridge mounting platform.<br>
In FIG. 4 mentioned earlier, the two positioning pins<br>
75Y of the cartridge engaging section 71Y in the toner<br>
replenishing unit stick out more than the front end of the<br>
suction nozzle 73Y. Moreover, the positioning pins 75Y<br>
are tapered, such that the tips are narrow. Half way<br>
through the operation of inserting the toner cartridge<br>
into the cartridge mounting platform, the tapering tips of<br>
these two positioning pins 75Y enter into the two<br>
positioning-pin receiving openings HOY of the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y shown in FIG. 3. Then, when the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y is inserted further, the rear end sides of<br>
the positioning pins 75Y, which are wider than the tips,<br>
enters the positioning-pin receiving opening HOY. This<br>
fixes a position of the toner cartridge 100Y in a<br>
direction orthogonal to the direction of the axis of<br>
rotation, on the cartridge mounting platform.<br>
After this position is fixed, the suction nozzle 73Y in<br>
the cartridge engaging section 71Y of the toner<br>
replenishing unit shown in FIG. 4 enters the nozzle<br>
receiving opening 109Y of the holder 102Y shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Then, at a point where the suction nozzle 73Y is pushed a<br>
certain extent into the insertion passage (115Y), the<br>
setting of the toner cartridge 100Y is completed. Thus,<br>
the toner cartridge can be installed in and detached from<br>
the side surface of the image forming apparatus.<br>
FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view showing the front end<br>
portion of the toner cartridge 100Y set in the toner<br>
replenishing unit. When the toner cartridge 100Y is set<br>
on the cartridge mounting platform of the toner<br><br>
replenishing unit (not shown), the suction nozzle 73Y<br>
fixed to the toner replenishing unit is inserted into the<br>
insertion passage 115Y of the nozzle inserting section<br>
104Y in the holder 102Y. At this time, in the insertion<br>
passage 115Y, the shutter member 116Y positioned right<br>
under the connecting passage 114Y moves by sliding from<br>
the right side to the left side in the diagram by being<br>
pushed to the front end of the suction nozzle 73Y inserted<br>
into the insertion passage 115Y. Then, the shutter member<br>
116Y moves away from the position right under the<br>
connecting passage 114Y, to a position right under the<br>
toner receiving opening (74Y in FIG. 4) provided on the<br>
front end portion of the suction nozzle 73Y. Thus, the<br>
toner storage section 106Y and the suction nozzle 73Y are<br>
connected via the connecting passage 114Y of the nozzle<br>
inserting section 104Y. Two 0 rings 117Y made of rubber,<br>
which is a non-porous material, are fixed on an inner<br>
peripheral surface of the insertion passage 115Y. The<br>
suction nozzle 73Y and the shutter member 116Y slide in<br>
the insertion passage 115Y while penetrating an inner<br>
portion of the 0 rings 117Y. One of the two 0 rings 117Y<br>
is located towards an inlet side (nozzle receiving<br>
opening) from the connecting passage 114Y and seals this<br>
location between the insertion passage 115Y and the<br>
suction nozzle73Y, which is a pipe member. Accordingly,<br>
an inflow of air from a gap between an inlet (toner<br>
receiving opening) of the insertion passage 115Y and the<br>
suction nozzle 73Y, to the insertion passage 115Y is<br>
blocked. Another 0 ring 117Y is located towards an outlet<br>
side from the connecting passage 114Y, and seals this<br>
location between the insertion passage 115Y and the<br>
suction nozzle 73Y. Accordingly, an inflow of air from a<br><br>
gap between the outlet of the insertion passage 115Y and<br>
the suction nozzle 73Y is blocked. As a result, toner<br>
conveyance by suction can be prevented from being<br>
hampered.<br>
The toner cartridge 100Y that is set on the toner<br>
replenishing unit (not shown), causes the gear 111Y of the<br>
bottle 101Y to engage with a driving gear 76Y fixed to the<br>
toner replenishing unit. As the driving gear 76Y is<br>
driven and rotated by a driving source (not shown), due to<br>
the engagement between the driving gear 76Y and the gear<br>
111Y, the bottle 101Y rotates while being held by the<br>
holder 102Y. Accordingly, Y toner in the bottle 101Y is<br>
carried from a rear end side of the bottle 101Y to a front<br>
end side of the bottle 101Y, and flows into the toner<br>
storage section 106Y of the holder 102Y. Then, Y toner is<br>
accumulated in the connecting passage 114Y that has become<br>
a bottom of the toner storage section 106Y.<br>
Due to a counteraction of the rotational motion of the<br>
bottle 101Y, it is assumed that the holder 102Y that<br>
rotatably holds the bottle 101Y is about to rotate on the<br>
cartridge mounting platform. However, an inner wall of<br>
the pin inserting passage inside the positioning-pin<br>
receiving openings 110Y hitches onto the positioning pin<br>
75Y. The rotation of the holder 102Y is prevented, and<br>
therefore, the holder 102Y is prevented from being<br>
misaligned.<br>
In another example, the protrusion and the recession<br>
can be reversed. Specifically, instead of the positioning<br>
pins 75Y, the cartridge engaging 'section 71Y can include a<br>
recessed section that extends in a direction parallel to<br>
the axis of rotation of the bottle. Furthermore, instead<br>
of the pin inserting passage, the holder 102Y can include<br><br>
a protruding section extending in a direction parallel to<br>
the axis of rotation of the bottle.<br>
In an area of the transporting pipe 72Y connected to<br>
the suction nozzle 73Y (not shown), a suction pump is<br>
connected, and air and toner in the transporting pipe 72Y<br>
is sucked by operation of this suction pump. As the air<br>
and toner are sucked, the suction force is transmitted to<br>
the connecting passage 114Y and the toner storage section<br>
106Y via the transporting pipe 72Y and the suction nozzle<br>
73Y. Then, the Y toner in the toner storage section 106Y<br>
and the connecting passage 114Y is sucked into the suction<br>
nozzle 73Y.<br>
As described above, the gap between the insertion<br>
passage 115Y and the suction nozzle 73Y inserted into the<br>
insertion passage 115Y is sealed by the 0 ring 117Y that<br>
is a non-porous sealing member. On the other hand, a gap<br>
between the cap 105Y of the holder 102Y and the bottle<br>
101Y engaged with the cap 105Y is sealed by the ring seal<br>
118Y that is a porous sealing member. According to this<br>
structure, the airtightness in the gap between the<br>
insertion passage 115Y and the suction nozzle 73Y is<br>
superior than an airtightness in the gap between the<br>
bottle 101Y and the cap 105Y. As a negative pressure is<br>
developed in the suction nozzle 73Y, the connecting<br>
passage 114Y, and the toner storage section 106Y, by<br>
suction of the suction pump, air flows in from outside<br>
through the gap between the bottle 101Y and the cap 105Y,<br>
where the airtightness is inferior. Concretely, the air<br>
reaches the porous ring seal 118Y through a gap between<br>
the inner side of the cap 105Y and an outer side of the<br>
bottle 101Y. Since the airtightness between the insertion<br>
passage 115Y and the suction nozzle 73Y is maintained well<br><br>
by the 0 ring 117Y, air is prevented from flowing through<br>
this portion into the suction nozzle 73Y. Therefore,<br>
suction force is exerted appropriately from the toner<br>
storage section 106Y to the suction nozzle 73Y. Thus, a<br>
stable amount of the Y toner is discharged from the toner<br>
storage section 106Y to a developing unit 5Yin the<br>
printer.<br>
If the airtightness between the inside and the outside<br>
of the toner cartridge 100Y is too high, air does not flow<br>
into the toner cartridge at all by the suction of the<br>
suction pump. This causes the bottle 101Y to deform due<br>
to excessive negative pressure. However, in the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y, the ring seal 118Y is made of a porous<br>
material. Accordingly, the toner storage section 106Y has<br>
a little negative pressure due to the toner suction, so<br>
that a proper amount of air flows into the toner storage<br>
section 106Y through the ring seal 118Y. This prevents<br>
the deformation of the bottle 101Y caused by to the<br>
excessive negative pressure.<br>
The toner cartridges 100M, 100C, and 100K have the same<br>
structure as the toner cartridge 100Y.<br>
FIG. 9 is a perspective view showing a toner<br>
replenishing unit 70 and its surrounding structure. The<br>
toner replenishing unit 70 includes a cartridge mounting<br>
platform 77, the four cartridge engaging sections 71Y,<br>
71M, 71C, and 71K, and four suction pumps 78Y, 78M, 78C,<br>
and 78K. The cartridge mounting platform 77 has four<br>
dents in the form of a half cylinder for mounting in<br>
parallel the four toner cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C, and<br>
100K. On a lower side of the cartridge mounting platform<br>
77, four developing units are disposed in positions right<br>
under the toner cartridges of corresponding colors. In<br><br>
the same diagram, for the sake of expediency, only a<br>
developing unit 5Y from among the four developing units is<br>
shown.<br>
On a side surface of the casing of the printer, the<br>
door that opens when replacing a toner cartridge is<br>
provided. As this door opens, the back side of the toner<br>
replenishing unit 70, as viewed in Fig. 9, is exposed. An<br>
operator sets the toner cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C, and<br>
100K by pushing them in a longitudinal direction of the<br>
bottle and sliding them on the cartridge mounting platform<br>
77.<br>
At one end of the cartridge mounting platform 77, an<br>
engaging section supporting plate for supporting the four<br>
cartridge engaging sections 71Y, 71M, 71C, and 71K is<br>
installed. Respective suction nozzles of the cartridge<br>
engaging sections 71Y, 71M, 71C, and 71K are inserted into<br>
nozzle insertion passages (not shown) of the toner<br>
cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C, and 100K, which are mounted<br>
on the cartridge mounting platform 77. At ends of the<br>
transporting pipes 72Y, 72M, 72C, and 72K of the cartridge<br>
engaging sections 71Y, 71M, 71C, and 71K, the suction<br>
pumps 78Y, 78M, 78C, and 78K are connected. A toner<br>
replenishing opening E of each developing unit is<br>
positioned right under each of the suction pumps 78Y, 78M,<br>
78C, and 78K.<br>
FIG. 10 is a perspective view showing the suction pump<br>
78Y from among the four suction pumps 78Y, 78M, 78C, and<br>
78K. This suction pump 78Y is an eccentric screw pump<br>
(popularly known as mono pump) . A pump section 80Y of the<br>
suction pump 78Y includes a rotor 81Y that is processed in<br>
the form of a eccentric double-threaded screw made of a<br>
metal or a highly rigid resin, a stator 82Y made of a<br><br>
material such as rubber including a hollow section in the<br>
form of the double-threaded screw, and a holder made of<br>
resin that accommodates the rotor 81Y and the stator 82Y.<br>
Furthermore, the suction pump 78Y includes a delivery<br>
section 83Y, and a motor 84Y that rotates the rotor 81Y.<br>
As the rotor 81Y rotates inside the stator 82Y, negative<br>
pressure is developed at a suction side (right side in the<br>
diagram) in the pump section 80Y. Due to this negative<br>
pressure, Y toner in the toner cartridge 100Y is sucked<br>
via the transporting pipe 72Y. Then, the Y toner reaches<br>
the pump section 80Y of the suction pump 78Y and is<br>
delivered from the delivery section 83Y after passing<br>
through the stator 82Y. The Y toner that is delivered is<br>
replenished to the developing unit 5Y after passing<br>
through the toner replenishing opening of the developing<br>
unit positioned right under the delivery section 83Y.<br>
Toner is replenished in the same manner in the developing<br>
units for other colors.<br>
As described above, the bottle in the toner cartridges<br>
100Y, 100M, 100C, and 100K has a long-slender cylindrical<br>
shape along a direction of axis of rotation. Thus, a<br>
rotating peripheral surface can be supported easily as<br>
compared to the case of using an angular shaped bottle.<br>
If only one end of the bottle is held rotatably by the<br>
holder, the other end is apt to bend down due to the<br>
weight of the toner. As a result, a considerable load is<br>
exerted on the holding section, which might cause the<br>
toner cartridge to break. Therefore, it is necessary to<br>
support the other end side of the bottle on the platform.<br>
When the bottle is supported on the platform, and the<br>
peripheral surface of the bottle is angular, the bottle is<br>
caused to bounce. However, if the bottle is cylindrical,<br><br>
the bottle does not bounce, and can be supported on the<br>
platform.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, in the toner cartridge 100Y of this<br>
printer, the holder 102Y is structured as follows.<br>
Specifically, the toner storage section 106Y that stores<br>
the Y toner sent from the bottle 101Y and the connecting<br>
passage 114Y that connects the toner storage section 106Y<br>
and the insertion passage 115Y are positioned such that<br>
the insertion passage 115Y, the connecting passage 114Y,<br>
and the toner storage section 106Y are arranged in this<br>
order, in a direction orthogonal to the direction of axis<br>
of rotation of the bottle. Thus, the Y toner that is sent<br>
from the bottle 101Y to the toner storage section 106Y by<br>
its self-weight, can be passed through the connecting<br>
passage 114Y and dropped into the suction nozzle 73Y in<br>
the insertion passage 115Y.<br>
In the present embodiment, a non-recycled cartridge is<br>
used. Similar results can be obtained by using a recycled<br>
cartridge, as the toner cartridges 100Y, 100M, 100C, and<br>
100K.<br>
FIG. 11, FIG. 12, FIG. 13, and FIG. 14 are schematic<br>
diagrams showing an outline of a projection image in the<br>
direction of axis of rotation of the bottle of the holder<br>
in the toner cartridges 100M, 100C, 100K, and 100Y for the<br>
toners M, C, K, and Y. Each diagram shows an outline of a<br>
projection image when the holder is projected from the<br>
rear end side of the bottle to the front end side of the<br>
bottle. Each shape of the projected image is different.<br>
Concretely, in each projection image, a rectangular<br>
protrusion is formed at a top left of a circle. This<br>
protrusion is formed by a guide member that sticks out<br>
from an external peripheral surface of the holder.<br><br>
However, the shape of these rectangular protrusions<br>
differs slightly according to each holder.<br>
FIG. 15 is a front view showing the side plate of the<br>
toner replenishing unit 70. When the door on the side<br>
plate of the casing of the printer is open, the side plate<br>
of the toner replenishing unit is exposed as shown in FIG.<br>
15. This side plate has four circular shaped openings and<br>
having different shapes. A first, a second, a third, and<br>
a fourth opening counted from the left side in the diagram<br>
are configured to receive toner cartridges for M, C, K,<br>
and Y, respectively. Shapes of the first, the second, the<br>
third, and the fourth openings are same as the outline<br>
shape of the projection images of the holders shown in<br>
FIG. 11, FIG. 12, FIG. 13, and FIG. 14, respectively. For<br>
example, even if an attempt is made to insert the toner<br>
cartridge for Y having the outline shape as shown in FIG.<br>
14 into the first opening on the far left side, the holder<br>
gets hitched onto the opening and insertion is obstructed.<br>
Thus, a toner cartridge is prevented from being set on an<br>
incorrect mounting section.<br>
There are mainly two types of methods for recycling the<br>
toner cartridge 100Y, as described below.<br>
In the first method of recycling, when the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y becomes empty, it is recycled by performing<br>
three steps viz. a disassembling step, a refilling step,<br>
and a reassembling step. In the disassembling step, the<br>
bottle 101Y rotatably engaged with the holder 102Y is<br>
removed by a special purpose tool. When the bottle 101Y<br>
is removed, an opening for toner discharge provided at a<br>
front end of the bottle 101Y is exposed. Next, at the<br>
refilling step, refill toner Y is refilled in the bottle<br>
101Y through this opening. Then, at the reassembling<br><br>
step, the front end of the bottle 101Y is engaged with the<br>
holder 102Y, so that the toner cartridge 100Y is<br>
reassembled.<br>
Second method of recycling<br>
In the second method of recycling, when the toner<br>
cartridge 100Y becomes empty, it is recycled by performing<br>
three steps viz. a hole making step, a refilling step, and<br>
a hole-closing step. At the hole making step, a hole<br>
drilled through a bottom surface (base) of the rear end of<br>
the bottle 101Y. Next, at the refilling step, refill<br>
toner Y is refilled through the hole, and at the hole<br>
closing step, the hole is closed by welding the same resin<br>
material as that of the bottle 101Y. In another example,<br>
the new toner cartridge 100Y can have an opening formed on<br>
the bottom surface (base) of the rear end of the bottle<br>
101Y, to be closed by sticking a sealing film. The<br>
sealing film may be peeled off or a hole may be made in<br>
the sealing film, to perform the hole making step.<br>
Moreover, at the hole making step, a location of making<br>
the hole need not be at the base of the bottle 101Y; the<br>
hole may be made on a peripheral surface.<br>
These recycling methods can be performed for toner<br>
cartridges corresponding to any other color.<br>
In the above embodiments, a printer that forms a full<br>
color image by using a plurality of image carriers for<br>
each color has been described. However, the present<br>
invention can be applied to an image forming apparatus<br>
that forms a full color image by forming single-color<br>
toner images of different colors on one image carrier and<br>
then superimposing and transferring them one by one to an<br>
intermediate transfer body. Moreover, the present<br>
invention can be applied as well to an image forming<br><br>
apparatus that forms only a single-color toner image.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can be applied to an<br>
image forming apparatus that forms a toner image by direct<br>
recording instead of by electrophotography.<br>
According to the present invention, a stable amount of<br>
toner is discharged to an image forming apparatus, and a<br>
toner cartridge can be set not only vertically but also<br>
horizontally so as to allow freedom in the layout.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, a<br>
toner cartridge can be installed in and detached from the<br>
side surface of an image forming apparatus.<br>
Moreover, according to the present invention, a holder<br>
that engages with a toner bottle is prevented from<br>
rotating, and therefore, the holder is prevented from<br>
being misaligned due to rotation of the toner bottle.<br>
Although the invention has been described with respect<br>
to a specific embodiment for a complete and clear<br>
disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited<br>
but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and<br>
alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in<br>
