at a maximum temperature of 60°C.   Ethyl acetate was then added and was then stripped<br>
under vacuo at a maximum temperature of 60°C. To the semi solid oil was added tert-butyl<br>
methyl ether (2.5 liters) and the solution stirred overnight. The crystalline product was filtered<br>
off and washed with further tert-butyl methyl ether (0.3 liters).   The mother liquors were<br>
concentrated and resubjected to silica chromatography (dissolved in 5 liters of toluene, added<br>
onto silica, eluted with 15 liters of toluene) and crystallized in the same fashion to afford a<br>
second crop. The (product was isolated as a white crystalline solid. Yields range from 70% to<br>
80%.	<br><br>

Preparation       2:       Allyl-2-tri-n-methylphosphoranvlidene-2-(3-phenvlacetamido-4-(tetrahvdrofuran-2-ylcarbonyl-methvlthio)azetidin-on-1-yl)acetate<br>
The solution of al|yl-2-hydroxy-2-(3-phenylacetamido-4-(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylcarbonyl-methylthio)azetidin-on-1-yl)acetate in tetrahydrofuran, which was obtained from Preparation 1 of Example 3, was further diluted with additional tetrahydrofuran (total tetrahydrofuran was 12 liters). The solution was cooled back to -20°C under nitrogen and 2,6-lutidene (654.0g, 6.09 moles) was added, followed by a dropwise addition of thionyl chloride (724.0g, 6.09 moles) at a maximum temperature of -20°C After a thirty minute stirring, the solution was allowed to warm to -10°C and sampled for TLC. The TIC showed that the starting material was converted into allyl-2-chloro-3-(3-phenylacetamido-4-(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylcarbonyl -methylthio)azetidin-on-1-yl)acetate to completion. The precipitated compounds were then filtered off and washed further with tetrahydrofuran. The tetrahydrofuran solution was then concentrated under vacuo at a maximum temperature of 30°C, redissolved in fresh tetrahydrofuran (6 liters) and cooled back to -10°C. After stirring overnight at ambient temperature, the solution was sampled for completion, diluted with ethyl acetate (35 liters) and washed with 5% sodium bicarbonate (20 liters) and 20% saturated sodium chloride (20 liters). The ethyl acetate was then stripped under vacuo at a maximum temperature of 4Q°C to afford thick dark oil. The yields range from 88% to 90%.<br>
Preparation! 3: Allvl-2-hvdroxv-2-(,3-phenvlacetarr)ido-4-(tetrahydrofuran-2-vlcarbonvl-methvlthio)azetidin-on-1-vl")acetate<br>
To a 20-liter flask was added methylene chloride (10.0 liters), tetrahydrofuran (1.0 liter) and allyl 2-hydroxy-2-(3-benzyl-4-thia-2,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-7-one) acetate (2016 g, 6.05 moles). To this solution was added 45% aqueous para-toluene sulphonic acid solution (500.0 g). After a three hour stirring the solution was sampled for completion.with TLC. The solution was then transferred to a 50 liter glass separating vessel, and methylene chloride was added |(5 liters) followed by water (2 liters). The separated organic phase was then washed with water (4 liters). The methylene chloride phase was then dried over sodium sulphate to afford a dry solution of allyi-2-hydroxy-2-(3-phenylacetamido-4-mercapto-azetidin-on-1-yl)acetate in methylene chloride that was then used without delay. To the above solution was added 86% of the solution of 2-bromoacetyltetrahydrofuran in methylene chloride (6.3 moles). The resultant solution was stripped under vacuo at a maximum temperature of 30°C to 50% of its volume. Pyridine (503.1 g, 6.36 moles) was added at a maximum temperature of 10°C. The solution was stirred overnight, diluted with methylene chloride (10 liters) and washed twice with water (10 liters total) then once with saturated sodium chloride (10%, 10 liter). After drying over sodium sulphate, the solution was concentrated under (vacuo at a maximum temperature of 40°C to ensure dryness.   The<br><br>

solution was redissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 liter) for use in the next step. If storage was required, the tetrahydrofuran solution was stored and dried before use.<br>
Preparation: 4: 2-Bromoacetvltetrahvdrofuran<br>
To a 20-liter glass vessel was added methylene chloride (10.0 liters) followed by acetyltetrahydrofuran {838.0 g, 7.34 moles). The solution was then cooled back to -10°C and triethylamine was added (854.0g 8.44 moles). The vessel was purged with nitrogen and trimethylsilane triflate (1713.0 g, 7.71 moles) was added dropwise at a.maximum temperature of -8°C. Addition was typically complete in 45 minutes. After 15 minutes stirring, a sample was removed for TLC and GC analysis, which showed that the reaction was completed. N-bromosuccinimide (1340g, 7.53 moles) was added to the solution at a maximum temperature of -5°C over a period of approximately 45 minutes in six portions. After a 30 minute stirring, the solution was sampled for GC and TLC analysis, which showed that the reaction was completed. The solution was then transferred to a 50-liter separating vessel, and 5% sodium bicarbonate (5 liters) was added with caution. The solution was stirred and separated. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the methylene chloride phase was washed with water, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and stored in a freezer before use in the next step.<br>
Preparation 5: Allvl-2-hydroxv-2-(3-benzvl-4-thia-2.6-diazabicvclo[3.2.01hept-2-en-7-one)acetate<br>
To a 50-liter glass vessel was added methylene chloride (20.6 liters) followed by 3-benzyl-4-thia-2,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-7-one (1700 g, 7.79 moles). To this suspension was added allyl glyoxylate monohydrate (1285 g, 9.74 moles) followed by sufficient triethylamine (about 175 g) to bring the pH of the solution to 7.5-7.9. After a 1 hour stirring, the solution was sampled for TLC/HPLC analysis. Upon completion, the solution was quenched with 0.1 M of hydrochloric acid (2.75 liters) to a pH of 4.50-5.00. The upper aqueous phase Was discarded, and the methylene chloride phase was washed with water (8 liters) and saturated sodium chloride (8 liters). The solution was dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated to a thick oil. The oil was dispersed in hexane (5 liters), filtered, and reslurried in tert-b[utyl methyl ether (5 liters) before filtration and washing with further tert-butyl methyl ether. Air prying afforded an off white crystalline product. Yields range from 72-99%.<br>
