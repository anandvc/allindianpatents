APPARATUS FOR NON-INVASIVELY SENSING PULSE RATE AND BLOOD<br>
FLOW ANOMALIES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention generally relates to apparatuses for monitoring blood flows,<br>
and more particularly to an apparatus and for non-invasivcty sensing pulse rate and blood flow<br>
anomalies using a localized, uni-dircctional, and constant magnetic field<br>
[0002]	With the advancement of bioelectronics, portable health monitoring devices<br>
are getting popular for they arc able to provide continuous monitoring of an individual's<br>
health condition with ease of use and comfort. The portable health monitoring devices are<br>
increasingly used at places such as home, ambulance and hospital, and at situations<br>
including military training and sports.<br>
[0003]	Pulse rate and blood flow characteristics are important parameters-subject to<br>
continuous monitoring because they are important in assessing the health condition of an<br>
individual. Healthcare institutes such as the hospitals and elderly care centres can use this<br>
information to remotely monitor the health conditions of their patients. This is particular<br>
important for paraplegic patients whose blood flow anomalies need to be detected early, In<br>
addition, blood flow anomaly monitoring for patients after major surgeries is important to<br>
ensure patients smooth recovery,<br>
[0004]	Furthermore, pulse rate and blood flow information of individuals subjected<br>
to crowded and cramped conditions with limited physical activity may be utilized to trigger<br>
alert for immediate attention when blood flow anomalies, such as deep vein thrombosis,<br>
are detected. Similar monitoring and alert system may also be deployed during disaster<br>
where life condition of the affected personnel can be assessed continuously for rescue risk<br>
management. Finally, it is important for monitoring of the pulse rate and blood flow of<br>
personnel working in dangerous environments such as deep sea condition (divers), high<br>
temperature (fire-fighters), and deep underground (coal miners).<br><br>
[0005]	Current apparatuses for non-invasive measurements of blood pulse rate use<br>
electrical, mechanical and optical means for sensing. The apparatuses can come in the<br>
form of chest stripes, socks attachments, wrist-watches, and finger attachments. However,<br>
each of the apparatuses for blood pulse measurement has its weaknesses. Chest stripes and<br>
sock attachments usually measure the body electrical signals to detennino the pulse rate; it<br>
is simple but requires the use of complex algorithms and/or reference signals to reduce<br>
noise due to motion artifacts. Measurement of pulse rate by mechanical means employs<br>
the detection of pulsation on the skin, which is highly susceptible to other motion artifacts.<br>
Optical means for pulse rate measurements usually come as finger attachment device.<br>
Such device employs the use of special light sources and detectors, which normally results<br>
in higher power consumption. With the various apparatuses discussed above, it is important<br>
to note that most of these apparatuses aro not able to acquire information on blood flow.<br>
[0005]	Another typo of apparatuses for measuring pulse rate and blood flow<br>
employs non-invasive electromagnetic method. For example, U.S. Pat 5,935,077 discloses<br>
an electromagnetic blood flow sensor that uses a bipolar magnetic field sourpe to provide a<br>
varying magnetic field with a component parallel to the skin and through the blood vessel,<br>
a stogle sense electrode on the skin adjacent to the blood vessel, a reference electrode, and<br>
a detector that samples tho sense electrode signal in synchronism to the varying magnetic<br>
field. However, the non-invasive electromagnetic apparatuses using electrodes to measure<br>
pulse rate and blood flow have poor signal-to-noise ratios as most of tho systems employ<br>
electrodes; tho apparatuses are more susceptible to body electrical noise and motion<br>
artifacts. In addition, most of these apparatuses employ the reversal of magnetic field<br>
polarity to achieve signal acquisition of pulse rate and blood flow information. This<br>
method usually requires the use of an olectromagnet, which will result in high power<br>
consumption. As such, tho current electromagnetic .apparatuses of pulse rate and blood<br>
flow monitoring aro not portable and are not meant for ambulatory use.<br>

[0016]	In another embodiment of the apparatus, the magnetic source further<br>
comprises a placement mechanism controlling the placement of the magnetic source in<br>
respect to the signal acquisition module and the orientation of tho blood vessel; thereby the<br>
placement of the magnetic source can be controlled. In yet another embodiment of the<br>
apparatus, the signal processing module further has the feedback capacities to control the<br>
signal for the placement mechanism and tho signal for the sensitivity of the sensor in tho<br>
signal conditioning module; in turn, the sensitivity control feedbacks to the signal<br>
acquisition modulo, and the placement mechanism feedbacks to the magnetic source to<br>
vary magnetic positions.<br>
[0017]	In anothor embodiment of tho apparatus, the signal acquisition module<br>
further comprises a placement mechanism for a user to manually or automatically adjust<br>
tho position and orientation of tho magnetio sensor. In another embodiment of the<br>
apparatus, the display/userinterface/alarm modulo displays tho two measurable parameters:<br>
blood flow anomaly arid measured pulse rate. In another embodiment of the apparatus, tho<br>
display/uscrjnterfacc/alarm modulo comprises a display, an alarm, and a user interface.<br>
[0018]	In another embodiment, the apparatus further comprises a wireless interface<br>
modulo to allow remote monitoring; and a base station for receiving the information from<br>
the wireless interface module, In yat another embodiment of tho apparatus, the base station<br>
comprises a data CODEC (Encoder and Decoder) and transceiver modules, display and<br>
user interface module, and microprocessor modules with RAM/ROM.<br><br>
[0019]	Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for non-<br>
invasively monitoring of the blood flow of an object In this embodiment, the method<br>
comprises providing a localized, uni-dircctional, and constant magnetic field in proximity<br>
to a blood vessel; detecting the variations of the magnetic field caused by the flow of<br>
pulsatile blood within the blood vessel; and processing the signals of the detected<br>
variations so as to monitor the blood flow.<br>
[0020]	In another embodiment of the method, the localized, uni-directional, and<br>
constant magnetic field is provided by a magnetic source that is a permanent magnet or an<br>
electromagnet In yet another embodiment of the method, the variations of the magnetic<br>
field is detected by a signal acquisition module with a magnetic sensor. In yet another<br>

rate can be calculated with the following equation:<br>
[0022J <br>
[0023]	where n is the number of pulses detected within the time duration T (in<br>
seconds); and T is the total time to observe n pulses.<br>
[0024]	In another embodiment of the method, the signal processing module detects<br>
the time interval between two adjacent pulses so as to measure and display physiological<br>
anomalies. In yet another embodiment of the method, the physiological anomalies include<br>
cardiac arrhythmia and on-set of heart failures.<br>
[0025]	One advantage of the present invention is that using magnetic field sensing<br>
to acquire the Modulated Magnetic Signature of Blood (MMSB) provides electrical<br><br>
isolation and is therefore less susceptible to body bioelectrical noise such as bioelcctrical<br>
noiso from the heart, brain and voluntary and involuntary motion artifacts.<br>
[0026]	Another advantage of tho present invention is that it docs not need to have<br>
direct physical contact of the magnetic source and/or signal acquisition module with tho<br>
skin, For example, thore could be fabric, perspiration and oil secretion between them.<br>
These do not in any way affect the quality of signal being acquired or measured. Another<br>
advantage of tho present invention is that the use of a localised constant unidirectional<br>
magnetic field allows tho employment of a permanent magnet. This will greatly reduce<br>
power consumption of the system making it feasible for deployment as a portable device.<br>
[0027]	Another advantage of tho present invention is that the apparatus docs not<br>
require a reference potential or signal such as tho electrocardiogram (ECG). Another,<br>
advantage of the present invention is that the apparatus can bo designed and developed to<br>
automatically or manually optimize the data acquisition process by varying the strength of<br>
the magnetic field or the sensitivity of tho sensor,<br>

Detailed Description of tho Invention<br>
[0045]	The present invention may bo understood more readily by reference to tho<br>
following detailed description of certain embodiments of tho invention.<br>
[0046]	Throughout this application, whore publications are referenced, the<br>
disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference, in their entireties,<br><br>
into this application in order to more fully describe the state of art to which this invention<br>
pertains.<br>
[0047]	In the following detailed description, specific details are set forth in order to<br>
provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will bo understood by<br>
those skilled in the relevant art that the present invention may bo practiced without these<br>
specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and<br>
materials have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.<br>
[0048]	The present invention provides an apparatus and method for non-invasively<br>
sensing pulse rate and blood flow in an object including human. The present invention is<br>
originated from the inventors discovery that when a localized, uni-directional, and<br>
constant magnetic field is applied to a blood vessel, tno flow of pulsatile blood can<br>
modulate the applied magnetic field and that the modulation of the magnetic field can bo<br>
sensed directly if a magnetic sensor is disposed in a suitable position within the magnetic<br>
field. Of principle, the apparatus comprises a magnotio source for providing the magnetic<br>
field, a magnetic sensor for acquiring the signals of modulation, and a signal<br>
processing/displaying subunit for processing and outputting the processed signal. The<br>
processed signals, named modulated magnetic signature of blood (MMSB), arc a function<br>
of the strength of tho magnetic source, the sensitivity of tho sensor, the distance between<br>
them, and their relative placement and orientation with respect to a major blood vessel near<br>
tho surface of the skin. While tho following description will use specific configurations<br>
and dimensions and modules to illustrate tho principles of tho present invention, it by no<br>
means intends to limit the practice of tho present invention to those specifics.<br>
[0049]	Now referring to PIG 1, there is provided a functional block diagram of the<br>
non-invasive magnetic apparatus for sensing pulse rate and blood flow in an object in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The non-invasive magnetic<br>
apparatus 10 comprises a magnetic source 1, a signal acquisition module 2, and a signal<br>
processing/displaying subunit 6 including a signal conditioning modulo 3, a signal<br>
 processing module 4, and a display/userinterface/alarm module 5. Briefly, a permanent<br>
magnet is shown in FIG 1 to illustrate the magnetic field distribution near an artery and the<br>
signal acquisition modulo, Tho flow of pulsatile blood in the artery modulates the applied<br>
magnetic field to create a modulated magnetic signature of blood flow (MMSB). The<br>
MMSB is translated by the signal acquisition modulo to an electrical signal, which is then<br><br>
conditioned and digitized for signal processing. Then; the processed signal, primarily the<br>
pulse rate and blood flow profile, will be sent to the display/uscrinterface/olann module.<br>
[0050]	The magnetic source 1 provides a localized, uni-dircctional, and constant<br>
magnetic field that is close to a major blood vessel. As discussed above, the flow of<br>
pulsatile blood modulates the applied magnetic field to produce a modulated magnetic<br>
signature of the blood flow (MMSB). The magnetic source 1 may comprise a permanent<br>
magnet, an electromagnet (including coil of wiro, coil of wiro on a ferromagnetic material,<br>
or coil of wiro on a magnet), or the like as long as a constant magnctio field can be<br>
generated. The magnetic source may optionally further comprise a slider and control<br>
interface so as to control the position of the magnetic source within the apparatus. In<br>
addition, tho magnetic source 1 may come in various geometry and sizes. As discussed<br>
hereinafter, a magnetic source may produce a magnetic field strength of 1000 Gauss ± 20<br>
% tolerance; that was used for tho inventors experiments. It is to be notod that the<br>
magnetic source may be of other magnetic field strength where tho related parameters (e.g.,<br>
tho sensitivity of tho sensor, the distance between the magnetic source and sensor, and the<br>
relative placement and orientation of the magnetic source and sensor with respect to a<br>
blood vessel) will have to be modified with appropriate support from experimental results.<br>
[0051]	The signal acquisition module 2 comprises a magnetic sensor that is able to<br>
translate magnetic variations to voltages proportional to the variations of the magnetic<br>
signature. The magnetic sensors suitable for tho present invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, spintronics. based sensors (e,g. giant magnctorcsistive (GMR) sensor and<br>
tunneling magnetoresistivc (TMR) sensor), anisotropic magnctorcsistive (AMR) sensors<br>
and any magnetic based sensors. One exemplary magnetic sensor is a Spintronics based<br>
magnetic sensor (e.g., AAH002-02 manufactured by NVE Corporation). It is to bo noted<br>
that other magnetic-based sensors, with different sensitivities may also be used to detect tho<br>
modulated magnetic signature of blood flow (MMSB), but the related parameters (e.g., the<br>
strength of the magnetic source, the distance between the magnetic source and sensor, and<br>
tho relative placement and orientation of the raagnetio source and sensor: with respect to a<br>
blood vessel) will have to bo modified with appropriate support from experimental results.<br>
[0052]	Magnetic sensors are well known in the art. Their working principles will<br>
only be briefly described herein. Such sensors change their resistances based on the<br>
magnetic field applied. FIGs 9a and 9b show a graphic illustration of the working principle<br><br>
behind the GMR magnetic sensors. As shown in FIG 9a, a conductive, nonmagnetic<br>
interlayer A is sandwiched by two-alloy layers B; when no external magnetic field is<br>
applied, the magnetic moments in the alloy layers face opposite directions (represented by<br>
the arrows), and the resistance to current C is high. As shown in FIG 9b, when an external<br>
magnetic field D is applied, applied external magnetic field overcomes: anti-ferromagnetic<br>
coupling, aligning magnetic moments in alloy layers, and the electrical resistance drops<br>
dramatically; 10% to 15% is typical. The magnetic signal variation is translated to a<br>
corresponding change of resistance in the GMR sonsor device. This change of resistance<br>
with magnetic field applied can be illustrated as shown in HG 4. To those skilled in the<br>
art, the curve shows a change of resistance that can be correlated to minute variations in<br>
magnetic field.	<br>
[0053]	Now referring to FIG 2, there is provided an exemplary schematic electronic<br>
circuit for the signal acquisition module 2 in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The circuit of the signal acquisition module 2 is so configured that a<br>
direct current (DC) power supply such as a battery to create a potential across the<br>
Wheatstone-Bridge connected to the GMR sensor. Coupled with the use of a Whcatstonc-<br>
Bfidge, the change in resistance due to the minute variations in the magnetic field can, be<br>
translated into a measurable potential To those skilled in the art, the potential applied<br>
across Y+ and V- will result in a measured output across OUT+ and OUT- Tho changes<br>
in resistance due to the applied magnetic field will then bo linearly translated to a<br>
differential potential change across OUT+ and OUT-. Acquiring and measuring this<br>
differential potential will allow the magnetic field variations duo to MMSB to bo quantified<br>
and processed for measuring pulse rates and detecting blood flow anomalies.<br>
[0054] With tho application of a localised, unidirectional, and constant magnetic<br>
source, tho measurable range of the Spintronics based magnetic sensor is shifted as shown<br>
in FIG 4. To those skilled in tho art, this will provide better linearity for the sensor to detect<br>
the minute changes of magnelio field generated from tho modulated magnetic signature of<br>
blood (MMSB).	<br>
[0055]	For optimized measurement of pulse rates and detection of blood flow<br>
anomalies by the apparatus, the factors other than the strength of the magnetic source and<br>
the sensitivity of tho magnetic sensor need to be considered. First is the placement and<br>
orientation of the magnetic source with respect to a blood vessel. Tho magnetic source 1<br><br>
may Be preferably placed along the longitudinal axis of the blood vessel at an appropriate<br>
proximity that will generate a signal which can be detected by the magnetic senior,. In<br>
addition, the magnetic source may also be placed at an offset position or angle with respect<br>
to the longitudinal axis of any major blood vessels near the surface of the skin. If so, then<br>
other parameters including tho strength of the magnetic source, the sensitivity of the<br>
sensor, and tho distance between the magnetic source and sensor will have to be modified<br>
with appropriate support from experimental results. Second is the distance between the<br>
magnetic source and sensor. The distance is affected by many factors including the<br>
strength of the magnetic source. For example, when the magnetic source is about 1000<br>
Gauss, the distance between tho magnetic source and sensor is about 2.5 cm ± 20 %.<br>
When the magnetic source produces a magnetic field with different strengths, it is easy for<br>
those skilled in the art to determine the proper range within which the magnetic sensor can<br>
be disposed without undue experimentation.<br>
[005G1	The magnetic source and magnetic sensor can sense tho pulse rate and blood<br>
flow in a non-direct contact configuration. As shown in FIG la, ono space gap 7 may exist<br>
between the magnetic source/sensor and the skin. For example, the space gap could be<br>
fabric, perspiration and oil secretion between them. The thickness of tho space gap can be<br>
easily determined in consideration of tho strength of the magnetic source, the sensitivity of<br>
the magnetic sensor, and the material used in tho space gap.<br>
[0057]	Now referring back to HG 1, tho signal conditioning modulo 3 converts tho<br>

modulo, anda signal digitization circuit for digitizing tho received signals. FIG 2 shows an<br>
exemplary schematic circuit of the signal conditioning modulo 3. The suitable circuits aro<br>
well known in tho art. As shown in FIG 2, an optional envelope detector and/or filter is<br>
proposed before digitization of tho signal using an analoguc-to-digital converter (ADC).<br>

rate and detect blood flow anomaly, In one embodiment, the signal processing module 4<br><br>
comprises a microcontroller, a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, programs to<br>
perform signal analysis, and a memory for storing oll the programs and providing venues<br>
for the execution of the programs. The result output /display module 5 displays the two<br>
measurable parameters-blood flow anomaly and measured pulse rate-obtained from the<br>
digital signal processing modulo 4 m cither discrete (LED) or continuous form (LCD), In<br>
one embodiment, the result output/display module 5 comprises a display, an alarm, and a<br>
user interface,<br>
[0050]	The outputs may take different forms. For example, the outputs may be an<br>
alarm notification if any anomalies are detected. The pulse rates may be expressed as<br>
pulses per minute. The outputs may also bo digital data with computed pulse rates. Typical<br>
digital data are shown in FIG 5 and FIG 6 for normal and abnormal blood flow condition<br>
respectively. Typical digital data are shown an FIG 7 and FIG S (at a more refined<br>
resolution) for normal and abnormal blood flow condition respectively. The calculation of<br>
pulse rates from the digital data will bo discussed hereinafter.<br>
[0060]	Now referring to FIG 3, there is provided a functional block diagram of the<br>
non-invasivo magnetic apparatus that is able to automate signal acquisition to achieve<br>
optimal signal level. As shown in FIG 3, the signal processing module 4 now has the<br>
feedback capacities to control the sensitivity of the sensor and placement mechanism such<br>
as a slider in the signal conditioning module, The placement mechanism enables a user to<br>
manually or automatically adjust the position and orientation of the magnetic source. In<br>
turn, tho sensitivity control feedbacks to the signal acquisition module, and the slider<br>
control feedbacks to tho magnetic source to vary magnetic positions. While not shown in<br>
FIG 3, the signal acquisition modulo may further comprises a placement mechanism<br>
enabling a user to manually or automatically adjust tho position and orientation of the<br>
magnetic sensor. In addition, while not shown in FIG 3, the magnetic source may further<br>
comprise a strength adjustment mechanism when the electromagnet is used as tho magnetic<br>
source. Tho devices for controlling position and orientation of the magnetic source and<br>
sensor and for controlling the strength of the magnetic source arc well known to those in<br>
the arts; any suitable devices may be used in the present invention.<br>
[0061]	Still referring to FIG 3, tho apparatus further comprises a wireless interface<br>
modulo 8 to allow remote monitoring. Tho base station 9 may be incorporated into the<br>
apparatus or employed in a separate location for receiving the information from tho<br><br>
apparatus. The base station comprises a data CODEC (Encoder and Decoder) and<br>
transceiver modules, display and user interface module, and microprocessor modules with<br>
HAM/ROM. The wireless transmission is well known in the art, thus no details will be<br>
provided herein.<br>
[0062]	Now referring to FIG 10, there is provided a flow chart of the method for<br>
sensing the pulse rato and blood flow anomalies using a localized, uni-dircctional, and<br>
constant magnetic field.<br>
[0063J	The method 100 starts with placing directly or in proximity to the skin the<br>
apparatus for non-invasively sensing pulse rato and blood flow using the localized, uni-<br>
directional, and constant magnetic field 110, The magnetic source and sensor of the<br>
apparatus is preferably disposed along the longitudinal axis of a major blood vessel such<br>
as, but not limited to, the ones found on the wrist, leg, or heel.<br>
[0064]	Then, the sensor is then connected to a direct current (DC) power supply<br>
120 such as a battery to create a potential across the Whcatstone-Bridgo connected to the<br>
GMR. sensor. For example, when the sensor used is the NVB AAH002-02, the potential<br>
applied is a DC voltage supply of 9V. Then, the signal acquisition module outputs the<br>
differential outputs, OUT+ and OUT-130.<br>
[00065]	Then, the output signals from the signal acquisition modulo are amplified by<br>
the signal conditioning module before any analogue signal conditioning (optional) 140, To<br>
those skilled in the art, such a configuration will ensure signal integrity. The analogue<br>
signal will then be digitised by tho analogue-to-digital converter (ADC),<br>
[0066]	Then, the conditioned output signals from the signal conditioning module<br>
are processed by the signal processing module to measure tho pulse rate and detect blood<br>
flow anomalies 150. Now referring to FIG 5, there is provided a typical digital data<br>
acquired with normal blood flow on the wrist The pulse rate can bo calculated with the<br>
following equation;<br><br>
where n is the number of pulses detected within the time duration T (in seconds); a is the<br>
time interval between two adjacent pulses as shown in FIG 5; and T is the total time to<br>
observe n pulses in seconds. Tho measurable parameter a can be used for tho observation<br><br>
of heart beat anomaly such as the presence of a chaotic pattern which could signify the on<br>
set of a heart attack or cardiac arrhythmia,<br>
[0067]	Then, the outputs from the signal processing module include pulse rate and<br>
blood flow anomalies. The outputs will be displayed 160 on the result output /display<br>
module.<br>
[0068]	The apparatus and method of the present invention is applicable to many<br>
situations. For example, hospitals can use the apparatus for monitoring patients; athletes<br>
. can use the apparatus for monitoring their blood flow; elders can be monitored remotely<br>
with the wireless apparatus; blood flow anomalies can be detected in different<br>
circumstances such as long flight, rescues, and dangerous situations.<br>
[0069]	FIGS 11-13 shows the placement and configuration of the non-invasive<br>
magnetic apparatus in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
magnetic source 1 and magnetic signal acquisition module % are placed along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the blood vessel on the wrist In this design, the apparatus can be '<br>
incorporated into any wrist wearing devices or decors. Of course, the apparatus can be<br>
used in other parts of a body and incorporated into other devices,<br>
