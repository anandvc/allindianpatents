				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (3-amino alcohols. More particularly it relates a process for the preparation of p-amino alcohols by N-alkylation of anilines with an alkylene carbonate in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
P-amino alcohols are extensively used in medicinal chemistry in the preparation of biologically active natural and synthetic products, artificial amino acids, and chiral auxiliaries for asymmetric synthesis. They are also useful as intermediates in the synthesis of perfumes, dyes and photo developers, p-amino alcohol is a versatile organic intermediate in the synthesis of several important organic compounds having different functionalities e.g. oxazolidones can be easily obtained by reacting i-amino alcohols with carbonylating reagents such as phosgene, alkyl carbonates, urea and carbon dioxide.<br>
The synthesis of p-amino alcohols from alkylene carbonate and aniline is attractive due to non-hazardous nature of alkylene carbonate over alkylene oxide used as starting material in conventional production. The drawback of conventional methodology is that it involves handling of potentially hazardous alkylene oxide and often catalysts used are corrosive and costly In addition, alkylation employing an alkylene carbonate does not require the high-pressure equipment often necessary when working with the highly volatile alkylene oxide. In most cases, the carbonate acts both as reactant and as solvent.<br>
N-alkylation and alkoxy carbonylation of amines by dimethyl carbonate to A/-alkyl amine and carbamate respectively is known, however a similar reaction of alkylene carbonates for the formation of (3 -amino alcohols is not well investigated. It has been reported that reaction between amine and alkylene carbonate gives polymeric products having carbamate and carbonate functionality. Kaye et al. (J. Org. Chem., 1953, 18, pp. 664-668) reported the synthesis of A/-methyl A/-phenyl<br><br>
ethanolamine from A/-methyl aniline and ethylene carbonate using corrosive and flammable homogeneous lithium amide catalyst.<br>
Union Carbide Chemicals &amp; Plastics Technology Corporation developed a process (King S.W., US Patent 5,104,987; April 14, 1992) for the alkoxylation of an active hydrogen containing compound comprising contacting the active hydrogen-containing compound with an alkylene carbonate in the presence of a mixed metal oxide catalyst a product mixture having alkoxylation products which constitutes oxyalkylene units of about 18 to 40 weight percent of the is reportedly produced. However, in this patent synthesis of p-amino alcohols from amines and alkylene carbonate is not described.<br>
The prior art literature on this reaction revealed that the use of solid base catalysts such as mixed metal oxides and hydrotalcite could be effective. However, these catalysts show poor activity and are not attractive from synthetic of view. There are industrial reports on reaction of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate with compounds containing active hydrogen atom in the presence of KaCOa to give polymeric hydroxy alkyl derivatives [Dow Chemical U.S.A., Experimental Ethylene carbonate XAS-1666.00L Product Bulletin 1982, pp. 4-9; Texaco Chemical Company, TEXACAR.RTM. Ethylene and Propylene carbonates Product Bulletin 1987, pp. 23-24]. This patent describes the synthesis of i-amino alcohols using a green chemistry approach, wherein the conventional reagent epoxides (which are toxic and hazardous) are replaced with alkylene carbonates a benign reagent using heterogeneous recyclable catalyst (See Scheme A). The use of solid base catalysts for organic synthesis is increasing because these catalysts are safe to handle, non-corrosive, low cost, have long shelf life and easily available commercially. In this context zeolites are promising due to their micro porous, alumino silicate structure with highly ordered crystalline nature. The combination of acid and base properties and shape selectivity in the zeolite catalyst is an important factor for synthesis of fine chemicals;<br><br>
particularly faujasites are often employed as preferred catalysts for various types of the reactions like alkylation, isomerization, polymerization, cyclization, nitrile hydrolysis, photo reduction, nitration of aromatic compounds etc.<br>
From industrial point of view, alkylene carbonates are important precursors. Ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate have been available commercially for over 40 years and have numerous applications as both reactive intermediates and inert solvents. They have additional properties like, high boiling and flash point, low odor level and evaporation rates, low toxicities and biodegradable which are appreciable and they can react with an active hydrogen containing compounds like, amines, alcohols, thiols and carboxylic acids (Clements J.H.; Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2003,42, pp 663-674).<br><br>

The contents were heated under stirring upto 160 °C and kept for 0.5 h while inert atmosphere (nitrogen) was maintained. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered to separate the catalyst from reaction crude, the reaction mass (filtrate) was analyzed on gas chromatogrph (GC) on a HP-1 capillary column with 30 M length, 0.32 mm inner diameter and film thickness 0.25 nm.

Analysis of reaction crude by GC showed conversion of aniline to be 100 % and yield of A/-phenyl ethanolamine to be 100 % and no formation of A/-phenyl diethanolamine (NPDEA). A/-phenyl ethanolamine was also isolated in pure form by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane-ethyl acetate 95:5) and characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR.
