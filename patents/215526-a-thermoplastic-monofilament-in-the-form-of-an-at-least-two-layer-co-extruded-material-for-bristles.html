Thermoplastic Monofilament for Bristles<br>
The invention concerns a thermoplastic monofilament for bristles which<br>
are exposed to extensive moisture during use.<br>
Bristles of thermoplastic plastic materials are used for the most<br>
different types of brushes, paint brushes and the like. They are<br>
subjected to greatly differing physical and chemical loads due to their<br>
functional use for brushing, painting, polishing, application of media or<br>
the like, and owing to the conditions prevailing directly during use or at<br>
the location of use. These conditions include in particular the use of<br>
auxiliary agents such as detergents, cleaning agents, cosmetics, water<br>
or the like. Should the location of use have high ambient humidity, the<br>
drying of moist auxiliary agents is thereby precluded.<br>
For this reason, bristles must have properties which meet these highly<br>
differing requirements. These different requirements are illustrated and<br>
exemplified by a toothbrush, wherein the bristles have an extremely<br>
small diameter of between approximately 0.05 and 0.4mm and are<br>
disposed at a small separation from each other and also densely packed<br>
into bundles. Toothbrush bristles must have good bending properties to<br>
be able to bend within the purely elastic range and to return to the<br>
initial position without deformation (bend recovery). Due to the plurality<br>
of different movements and differing user-dependent individual<br>
application of pressure for brushing her/his teeth, the bristles must<br>
have a good fatigue strength under reversing bending stresses as well<br>
as long term stability for an appropriate period of use. The plastic<br>
material must be structured such that the bristle can be processed in<br>
mechanical or thermal production procedures, in particular for mounting<br>
the bristles to the bristle carrier. Finally, the bristles must be rounded at<br>
the useful end to produce protective and at the same time sufficient<br>
brushing action on the tooth surfaces and in the interdental spaces<br>
without damaging the enamel due to excessive hardness, edges or the<br>
like and without injuring the gums.<br>
Due to the required dense bristle stock of a toothbrush, the auxiliary<br>
agents used, e.g. tooth paste, water etc., as well as the excessive<br>
moisture in the air at the location of use, e.g. bathroom, the bristles are<br>
constantly subjected to moisture. Drying proceeds slowly due to the<br>
dense bristle stock and the ambient conditions.<br>
As has been previously noticed with earlier natural bristles, the<br>
excessive moisture weakens the bristles. Such failure was referred to as<br>
"wet breakdown" (US 2 309 021). With natural bristles, this failure is<br>
mainly due to the loss of natural fat during washing and cleaning<br>
processes, the fat serving a hydrophobic role for the living animal. This<br>
process in a toothbrush is further enhanced by hydrolytic interaction<br>
between tooth cleaning agents and the bristle and by abrasive particles<br>
in the tooth cleaning agents. Attempts had been made to overcome this<br>
"wet breakdown" through surface chemical treatment of the natural<br>
bristle.<br>
For the above reasons, the natural fibers of toothbrushes could only be<br>
replaced by synthetic plastic materials when high-quality thermoplastic<br>
materials became available. Today, bristles for toothbrushes exclusively<br>
use high quality polyamides, in particular PA 6.10 or 6.12. Polyamides<br>
of such quality are correspondingly expensive, in particular since these<br>
high-quality polyamides are too expensive for other applications.<br>
Although high-quality polyamides have excellent strength properties,<br>
they absorb significant amounts of moisture thereby compromising their<br>
favorable strength characteristics. This reduction in strength leads to<br>
failure of the bristle, the earlier the smaller its diameter, since the<br>
moisture rapidly penetrates into the bristle core. Today, toothbrushes<br>
are often characterized on the basis of bristle hardness, e.g. soft,<br>
medium or hard, which is mainly determined by the bristle diameter.<br>
This characterization and grading looses its validity after a period of use<br>
due to the influence of moisture. The absorption and retention of<br>
moisture in the bristle gaps also leads to considerable hygienic<br>
problems since the moisture promotes bacterial growth which would<br>
require even longer drying times that cannot be achieved in practice<br>
(U.S. News &amp; World Report 12.10.87, page 88).<br>
Many other types of thermoplastic monofilaments have been repeatedly<br>
tried and tested for different kinds of bristles. In particular, bristles of<br>
thermoplastic polyesters have a comparable bending behavior and<br>
fatigue strength under reversing bending stresses but have not yet<br>
been successful for toothbrushes. This is attributable to their increased<br>
hardness and resulting danger of injury to gums and enamel. Moreover,<br>
they tend to split and form ridges during mechanical processing, in<br>
particular during rounding of the useful ends. In addition, they have an<br>
increased tendency of binding dirt, i.e. are difficult to clean by rinsing of<br>
the toothbrush.<br>
Co-extruded filaments are known from textile technology (EP 0 763 611<br>
Al) which consist of a polyester core and a polyamide jacket. The<br>
requirements on such applications are, however, different from those<br>
for bristles. Co-extruded monofilaments for toothbrushes are also<br>
known (WO97/14830) which consist i.a. of a polyamide jacket and a<br>
polyester core. Only high-quality polyamides are used for the jacket. In<br>
a further variant with a jacket of polyamides of lower quality, the core<br>
consists of a copolyether ester which is an elastomer and therefore does<br>
not meet the requirements for toothbrush bristles. The same is true for<br>
another known composite structure (GB 980 814), having a core and<br>
jacket made from differently treated polyvinyl chlorides.<br>
It is the underlying purpose of the invention to propose a monofilament<br>
for bristles whose properties can be optimally adapted to the desired<br>
functional, technical requirements and ambient conditions during use<br>
and at reduced material cost.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved with a thermoplastic<br>
monofilament which forms the starting material for bristles in that the<br>
monofilament comprises a polymer mixture of at least one polyamide<br>
(PA) and at least one thermoplastic polyester (PE).<br>
The precise mixing ratio (PA/PE) is selected in dependence on the<br>
relevant technical, functional properties for use of the bristle and on the<br>
ambient conditions relevant for the function of the bristle at the location<br>
of use.<br>
Polymer mixtures (polymer blend) almost invariably form multi-phase<br>
systems such as those also known from metal alloys. Their behavior<br>
when mixed is different from that of many low-molecular materials<br>
which e.g. dissolve and form a single-phase system. The reason<br>
therefor is the molecular interaction due to Van der Waals, dipole and<br>
hydrogen interactive forces which are more effective for similar<br>
macromolecules than between different polymers in the mixing phase.<br>
Moreover, the degree of looping of the macromolecules and the entropy<br>
increase during mixing is important, which, due to the steric effects, is<br>
smaller for macromoles than for low-molecular substances.<br>
For blends of thermoplastic polyester and polyamides, the polar groups<br>
of both polymers have a positive effect on the mixing properties. The<br>
different segment lengths are the basis of the tendency to multi-phases<br>
which is desired if the technical physical and chemical properties of the<br>
components involved in the mixture are maintained with sufficiently<br>
high binding forces, which is the case with a PA/PE blend. This is due to<br>
the fact that, in contrast to homogeneous blends, the morphology of the<br>
mixing phase PA/PE largely displays the natural crystallinity of the<br>
individual components such that the positive properties of the polymers<br>
forming the blend are maintained. PA/PE blend filaments have a<br>
reduced rigidity compared to pure polyester, however, a better damping<br>
behavior which corresponds more to that of nylon. The mixing phase<br>
has a dispersion-like character which explains the improved impact<br>
strength compared to the pure mixing components.<br>
The polymer portions of the blend for extrusion of the thermoplastic<br>
monofilament can be optimally adjusted to the requirements for the<br>
bristle. The bending behavior and the bend recovery can be adjusted<br>
corresponding to the bristle diameter and length and to the precise type<br>
of use of the bristle (toothbrushes, massage brushes, hand brushes,<br>
cosmetic brushes, paint brushes etc.). It can also be adjusted to the<br>
physical and chemical conditions prevailing at the location of use due to<br>
the media used (tooth cleaning agents, cleaning agents, water etc.) and<br>
the prevailing ambient conditions (dry or moist atmosphere, retention<br>
of moisture in the bristle stock etc.).<br>
The mixing ratio (PA/PE) can be varied within large limits without<br>
considerably impairing the stability of the mixing phase. The mixing<br>
ratio PA/PE can e.g. vary between 10/90 mass% and 90/10 mass% and<br>
is preferably between 20/80 mass% and 80/20 mass%.<br>
If the bending strength and its durability during use even under<br>
extremely moist conditions is the most important requirement, the PE<br>
portion is increased by reducing the PA portion. An appropriate PA<br>
fraction improves the bend recovery in the dry state. Vice versa, the<br>
bend recovery in extremely moist ambient conditions is impaired by a<br>
high PA portion due to the increased water absorption of PA. If the<br>
sliding quality of the bristle and the cleaning effectivity (abrasion<br>
behavior) are most important, the PA portion is increased by reducing<br>
the PE portion which simultaneously leads to protective treatment of the<br>
surface to be cleaned and its surroundings (e.g. the enamel, the gums).<br>
An optimum mixing relationship PA/PE which best meets the<br>
requirements for toothbrushes, is a PA portion of between 10 and 30<br>
mass% and a PE portion of between 70 and 90 mass%.<br>
Moreover, the mixing ratio can be adjusted to the bristle geometry<br>
taking into consideration the ambient conditions at the location of use.<br>
The PE portion of the mixing ratio will be higher, the smaller the cross-<br>
section of the bristle to prevent penetration of moisture into the thin<br>
cross-section and associated impairment of the bending behavior and<br>
bend recovery.<br>
It is advantageous to increase the PE portion, reducing the PA portion,<br>
irrespective of the geometrical shape of the bristle, the stronger and/or<br>
more persistent the influence of moisture at the location of use of the<br>
bristle. This recommendation is not however absolutely necessary since<br>
absorption of moisture by the brush is desired in some applications to<br>
improve the binding of the liquid application media to the bristle.<br>
The thermoplastic polyester is preferably a polyalkylene terephthalate<br>
(PAT), wherein in particular polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or<br>
polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) or a mixture thereof can be used.<br>
These thermoplastic polyesters are particularly suited for bristles not<br>
only because of their technical properties but also since they are much<br>
less expensive than the polyamides, e.g. PA 6.12, which have been<br>
used for toothbrush bristles up to now.<br>
A high proportion of PAT also permits at least partial replacement of<br>
high-quality PA with lower-quality and less expensive PA, e.g. PA 6.<br>
The polyamide component of the mixture can be selected e.g. from the<br>
group of higher-quality polyamides, such as PA 6.10, PA 6.12, PA 11,<br>
PA 12 and the group of lower-quality polyamides, such as PA 6, PA 6.6<br>
thereby taking into consideration that the mixing phase must have<br>
sufficient stability.<br>
The invention also concerns a thermoplastic monofilament in the form<br>
of an at least two-layer co-extruded material for bristles which are<br>
subjected to extensive moisture during use. In such co-extruded<br>
material, at least one layer consists of a polymer mixture of the above-<br>
described composition.<br>
The two layers of the co-extruded material can be concentric, i.e. a core<br>
and a jacket. Alternatively, the co-extruded material can comprise<br>
several monofilaments which are embedded in a second layer which<br>
defines the outer cross-section of the monofilament. Moreover, the co-<br>
extruded material can consist of a core which defines only a portion of<br>
the periphery while the second layer forms segments completing the<br>
periphery, i.e. can have a substantially rectangular cross-section which<br>
is mainly formed by one layer, whereas the other layer only forms the<br>
corners.<br>
Irrespective of the precise geometry of the co-extruded material whose<br>
one layer is formed by the polymer mixture of the inventive type, the<br>
second layer can consist of a single polyamide or a mixture of<br>
polyamides and vice versa. The second layer can also be formed of a<br>
thermoplastic polyester of a mixture of such polyesters.<br>
If the co-extruded material consists of a core and a jacket, the core<br>
preferably consists of a PAT or a mixture of polyalkylene esters, while<br>
the jacket is formed of a polyamide or a polyamide mixture.<br>
In the case of a toothbrush bristle, the core substantially determines<br>
the bending behavior and the bend recovery whereas the jacket<br>
substantially provides the brushing effect for distribution of the<br>
application or cleaning media. Although the jacket of such a bristle<br>
absorbs an increased amount of water, this has, however, no or only<br>
little effect on the moisture properties since these are mainly<br>
determined by the core which has considerably reduced absorption of<br>
moisture.<br>
The core can also be made from one thermoplastic polyester or from a<br>
polyester mixture since it is not directly involved in the brushing action,<br>
with the jacket then having the inventive polymer mixture. The<br>
inventive polymer mixture can be present in the core and also in the<br>
jacket, wherein the PE or PAT portion in the core and the PA portion in<br>
the jacket can be increased.<br>
The excellent rigidity properties of the inventive polymer mixture permit<br>
structures having a core consisting of this mixture covered by a jacket<br>
made from any polymer, in particular PA or a PA mixture. This permits<br>
different coloring of the jacket, which is limited with PE and PE<br>
mixtures, whereas e.g. polyamides are particularly easy to color. This<br>
material combination also allows the jacket to be extremely thin.<br>
Depending on the application, the bristle diameter can vary between<br>
5.0mm for rough brushes, e.g. street brushes, and 0.1mm for<br>
toothbrushes, cosmetic brushes etc. For bristles having a diameter of<br>
between 0.5 and 5.0mm, the jacket can have a thickness between 0.01<br>
and 0.5mm. For toothbrush bristles having a diameter range of 0.1 to<br>
0.3mrn, the thickness of the jacket can be between 10 and 50µ. This<br>
permits creation of a wear display, wherein, with increasing length of<br>
use, the colored jacket is removed and the non-colored or differently<br>
colored core is exposed to show the user the degree of wear.<br>
The properties of the inventive polymer mixture which determine the<br>
stability also permit three-layered co-extruded material structures with<br>
e.g. a core containing PAT or a PAT mixture, an intermediate layer of an<br>
inventive polymer mixture, and an outer layer of an elastomer or an<br>
elastomer blend. In this context, a copolyether ester is particularly<br>
recommended due to its affinity to the polyester portion of the central<br>
layer. In this case as well, the outer useful layer provides optimum<br>
conditions for meeting the requirements for brushing, cleaning, for<br>
massage or for the application of media.<br>
Finally, the core can be formed as a hollow core to absorb media and<br>
release them at the free end of the bristle.<br>
Should the jacket consist of the inventive polymer mixture or of PA or a<br>
PA mixture, a bristle which consists of core and jacket can be<br>
mechanically treated at the bristle ends with improved quality and, in<br>
particular, perfectly rounded without the formation of edges.<br>
