				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a window type air conditioner, and more particularly, to a ventilating device of a window type air conditioner which is capable of supplying the air of outdoors inside a room by a user"s selection, during air conditioning, and thereby ventilating the air in the room using the supplied air. Discussion of Related Art<br>
Generally, an air conditioner is used to heat-exchange a hot air in a room into a cool air, for air-conditioning the room under a predetermined temperature. In accordance with types of installation place, the air conditioner is largely divided into three types. The first type of air conditioner is installed in a bottom surface of the room, the second type of air conditioner is installed attachably on the wall surface of the room, and the third type of air conditioner is installed on a window. The first and second types of air conditioners include a room device and an outdoor device separated from each other, and the third<br>
type of air conditioner includes the room device and the outdoor device integrated with each other.<br>
First, the construction of a conventional window type air conditioner will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 4.<br>
The conventional window type air conditioner is comprised of: a body 1 which is attached on a window and forms a plurality of air holes 2 on the both sides and the upper surface thereof; a front panel 5 which is attachably/detachably coupled on the front surface of the body 1 and has an intake grill 3 and a discharge grill 4; a separating plate 6 which is fixed in the interior of the body 1 and separates the body 1 into a room portion la and an outdoor portion lb; a fan 7 which is installed in the room portion la of the body 1 and rotates by a driving force of a motor (not shown) to generate an intake force; and a heat exchanger 8 which is installed in the room portion la of the body 1 and heat-exchanges the hot air within the room sucked through the intake grill 3 according to the rotation of the fan 7 into a cool air.<br>
Upon installation of the window type air conditioner under the above construction, the front panel 5 is positioned within the room, and the plurality of air holes 2 on the body 1 is positioned<br>
in an outdoors.<br>
If an air-conditioning mode is selected by an operation dial 10 on a control plate which is installed on the front panel 5, the air-conditioning is started according to the selected control signal.<br>
In more detail, since the fan 7, which is installed m the room portion la of the body 1, rotates by a driving force of the motor and thus generates an intake force, the hot air in the room is sucked into the room portion la of the body 1 through the intake grill 3. At the same time, since the heat exchanger 8 executes a heat exchange operation, the hot air sucked into the room portion la is changed into a cool air, while passing through the heat exchanger 8. The changed cool air is discharged into the room through the front panel 5 and the discharge grill 4 in accordance with the continuous rotation of the fan 7. Thus, the room is air conditioned, while falling under a predetermined temperature.<br>
Since the conventional window type air conditioner performs the air conditioning by continually circulating the air in the room, if the air conditioning has been executed for a long time period, there occurs a problem in that the air in the room becomes<br>
impure. To solve this problem, the window type air conditioner separately includes a ventilating device which selectively supplies the air of an outdoors inside the room and thus prevents the air of the room from being impure.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a window type air conditioner having a ventilating device constructed according to a first embodiment of prior art, FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view illustrating main parts of FIG. 1, FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line I-I of FIG. 2, and FIG. 4 is a perspective view illustrating a lever constituting the ventilating device of FIG. 1. In the first embodiment of prior art, the ventilating device includes: a ventilating hole 11 which is formed in the discharge grill 4 of the separating plate 6, for connecting the room portion la with the outdoor portion lb; a lever 12 which is movable forwardly/backwardly in the room portion la of the body 1, to expose the front end portion thereof to the outside of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4, and maintains a horizontal state by a lever guide portion, not being deviated during its own forward/backward movement; a damper 13 which is formed on the back end portion of the lever 12, for selecting<br>
opening/closing the ventilating hole 11 during the forward/backward<br>
movement of the lever 12; and a pair of grooves 14 which are formed opposite to each other on the front end of the lever 12 and serve as a handle grip.<br>
The lever guide portion is comprised of a vertical hole<br>
15	which is vertically formed on the lever 12, a guide projection<br>
16	which is formed in the bottom surface of the room portion<br>
la and is inserted into the vertical hole 15, and a screw 17<br>
which is screwed on the guide projection 16 on the upper portion<br>
of the lever 12.<br>
Now, the assembling process of such the conventional ventilating device as mentioned in the above will be discussed.<br>
In a state where the front panel 5 is not coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the guide projection 16 is inserted into the vertical hole 15, and then the screw 17 is screwed on the guide projection 16 on the upper portion of the lever 12. As a result, the lever 12 is installed m the room portion la to be movable forwardly/backwardly, without deviation.<br>
Thereafter, if the front panel 5 is coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the front end portion of the lever 12 is exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4.<br>
In the state where such the window type air conditioner is attached on a window 9, if ventilation is desired in an air conditioning operation mode selected by a user, the pair of grooves 14 which are formed in the front end portion of the lever 12 are grasped by the user"s hand to pull the lever 12 in a forward direction. To the contrary, if the ventilation is not further desired, the pair of grooves 14 are grasped by the user"s hand to push the lever 12 in a backward direction.<br>
Referring to the state shown by a dotted line of FIG. 2, the damper 13 closes the ventilating hole 11, such that the room portion la and the outdoor portion lb within the body 1 are not connectedwitheachother . In this case, although the air conditioner is in an air conditioning state, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is not supplied to the room portion la, thereby not achieving the ventilation of the room.<br>
Under the state shown by the dotted line of FIG. 2, if the user forwardly pulls the lever 12, since the guide projection 16 is inserted into the vertical hole 15 on the lever 12 and the screw 17 is screwed on the guide projection 16, the lever 12 is not deviated under the guide of the guide projection 16<br>
and horizontally moves in a forward direction. Accordingly, since the damper 13 opens the ventilating hole 11 on the separating plate 6, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is supplied to the room portion la through the ventilating hole 11. The supplied air is mixed with a cool air by the heat exchange 8 and is discharged to the room through the discharge panel 4 of the front panel 5, thus achieving the ventilation of the room.<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view illustrating main parts of a window type air conditioner having a ventilating device constructed according to a second embodiment of prior art, and FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating a lever constituting the ventilating device of FIG. 5. The ventilating device is well disclosed in Japanese patent publication number 6-129669. In construction, there are provided a ventilating hole 21 which is formed in the discharge grill 4 of the separating plate 6, for connecting the room portion la with the outdoor portion lb, a lever 22 which is hinge-installed to be horizontal-rotatably moved in the room portion la of the body 1, to expose the front end portion thereof to the outside of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4, and a damper 23 which is formed on the<br>
back end portion of the lever 22, for selecting opening/closing the ventilating hole 21, during the horizontal rotation of the lever 22.<br>
An explanation of the assembling process of such the conventional ventilating device as mentioned in the above will be avoided because it is similar to that of the first embodiment of the conventional device. Meanwhile, a ventilation procedure during the air conditioning in the air conditioning operation mode will be explained.<br>
If the ventilation in the room is desired, the front end portion of the lever 22 exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 is pulled and the lever 22 rotates in a counterclockwise direction, whereas if the ventilation is not further desired, the lever 22 rotates in a clockwise direction.<br>
In the state shown by a dotted line of FIG. 5, the damper 23 closes the ventilating hole 21, such that the room portion la and the outdoor portion lb within the body 1 are not connected with each other. In this case, although the air conditioner is in an air conditioning state, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is not supplied to the room portion la, thereby not achieving the ventilation<br>
of the room.<br>
Under the state shown by the dotted line of FIG. 5, if the user pulls the front end portion of the lever 22 and pressurizes the portion in a counterclockwise direction, since the lever<br>
22	is hinge-installed on the bottom surface of the room portion la of the body 1, the lever 22 rotates in a counterclockwise direction around the hinge point. Accordingly, since the damper<br>
23	opens the ventilating hole 21 on the separating plate 6, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is supplied to the room portion la through the ventilating hole 21. The supplied air is mixed with a cool air by the heat exchange 8 and is discharged to the room through the discharge panel 4 of the front panel 5, thus achieving the ventilation of the room. In the ventilating devices according to the first and second embodiments of the prior art, since the front end portion of the lever is exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 in the state that the assembly is completed, there exist the following problems: first, upon package of the product for shipment, a package area is increased to cover the exposed portion of the lever, thus to increase the cost of package; second, upon loading of the packaged product in container for<br>
delivery, the number of products to be loaded is reduced, thus to increase the cost of delivery; and finally, upon the packaging and delivery, the tearing off of the package box or the breakage of lever is often generated.<br>
Moreover, in the ventilating device according to the first embodiment of the prior art, since the assembling structure of the lever which is capable of moving forwardly and backwardly in a horizontal state, without deviation, is greatly complicated, the yield of production is accordingly decreased.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a ventilating device of a window type air conditioner that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Reference will now be made in detail to the prefer red embodiments<br>
of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
First, the construction and effect of a ventilating device of a window type air conditioner according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be in detail discussed with reference to FIGS. 7A to 10.<br>
FIGS. 7A and 7B are cross-sectional views illustrating main parts of a window type air conditioner having a ventilating device constructedaccording toa first embodiment ofthepresent invention, in which FIG. 7A shows the state that the whole portion of a second lever is received in a room portion of a body, and FIG. 7B shows the state that the front end portion of the second lever is exposed to the outside of a front panel of the body, FIG. 8 is a perspective view illustrating separation between the first and second levers constituting the ventilating device of FIGS. 7A and 7B, FIG. 9 is a sectional view taken along the line II-II of FIG. 7B, and FIG. 10 is a sectional view taken along the line III-III of FIG. 7B. In the ventilating device according to the first embodiment of the present invention, a ventilating hole 101 is formed in a discharge grill 4 of a partition 6 separating<br>
a body 1 into a room portion la and an outdoor portion lb, for connecting the room portion la with the outdoor portion lb. A first lever 102 is movable forwardly/backwardly m the bottom surface of the discharge grill 4 of the room portion la, while being received m the room portion la m the whole portion thereof. The first lever 102 is not deviated and maintains a horizontal statebymeans ofa leverguideportion,during the forwardly/downward movement. A damper 103 is formed as a unitary body on the back end portion of the first lever 102, for selecting opening/closing the ventilating hole 101, during the forward/backward movement of the first lever 102. A second lever 104 is formed on the front end of the first lever 102 and is received in the room portion la of the body 1 during the shipment of product, but is turned in a straight line state against the first lever 102, by an artificial force, to be exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4 m the front end portion thereof, after the installation of product. A pair of grooves 105 which are formed opposite to each other on the front end of the second lever 104 and serve as a handle grip, on which a knurling 106 is formed to prevent sliding.<br>
The lever guide portion is preferably comprised of a vertical<br>
groove 107 which is formed in a length direction on the lower portion of the first lever 102, a guide projection 108 which is formed in the bottom surface of the room portion la of the body 1 and is inserted into the vertical groove 107, and a pair of hookers 109 which are formed in the bottom surface of the room portion la of the body 1 for hook-locking the first lever 102, when the guide projection 108 is inserted into the vertical groove 107.<br>
In construction of the second lever 104, there are provided a thin loop 110 which connects the one side of the rear end of the second lever 104 with the one side of the front end of the first lever 102, a reentrant groove 111 which is formed on the upper surface of the front end portion of the first lever 102, a locking protrusion 112 which is formed opposite to each other on the both sides of the reentrant groove 111, respectively, the locking protrusion 112 being inwardly inclined gradually from the outside portion thereof to the inside portion thereof, a locking projection 113 which is formed on the upper portion of the rear end portion of the second lever 104 and is inserted into the reentrant groove 111 on the first lever 102, to be thereby locked into the locking protrusion 112, and a deviation preventing<br>
projection 114 which is formed on the top end portion within the reentrant groove 111 of the first lever 102 and secures the locking projection 113 to prevent the locking projection 113 from being deviated from the reentrant groove 111.<br>
On the lower surface of the front end portion of the first lever 102, an auxiliary locking protrusion 115 is formed to be downwardly inclined gradually from the front portion thereof to the rear portion thereof. An auxiliary locking projection 116 is formed on the lower surface of the rear end portion of the second lever 105. After the second lever 104 is turned in a straight line state against the first lever 102 by using an artificial force, when the locking projection 113 on the second lever 104 is inserted into the reentrant groove 111 on the first lever 102, the auxiliary locking projection 116 is accordingly locked to the auxiliary locking protrusion 115.<br>
Now, the assembling process of such the ventilating device as mentioned in the above will be discussed.<br>
First, after the first lever 102 which is integrated with the second lever 104 by the thin loop 110 is inserted into the room portion la of the body 1, the first lever 102 is pressed downwardly to insert the guide projection 108 into the vertical<br>
groove 107. At the time, since the pair of hookers 109 are formed on the bottom surface of the room portion la, the first lever 102 is hook-locked to each of hookers and is not deviated from the room portion la of the body 1, to thereby move horizontally in the forward/backward direction.<br>
Next, when the front panel 5 is coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the second lever 104 which is integrated with the first lever 102 by the thin loop 110 is received within the room portion la of the body 1. In the case, it can be understood that both of the first and second levers 102 and 104 are not exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the air conditioner is attached to the window 9, the front panel 5 coupled with the body 1 is first detached, and the back end portion of the second lever 104 is grasped by a user"s hand and then is pressurized in a counterclockwise direction. As a result, the second lever 104 is turned m the counterclockwise direction on the basis of the thin loop 110 and is in a straight line state against the first lever 102. Then, when the second lever 104 is pushed towards the first lever 102, the second lever 104 is coupled with the first lever 102 in a straight line state.<br>
During the above assembling procedure, after the second lever 104 is completely detached from the first lever 102, if necessary, the second lever 104 can be coupled with the first lever 102 in a straight line state. In this case, in the state where the second lever 104 is integrated with the first lever 102 by the thin loop 110, the second lever 104 is twisted or a separate tool is used so as to cut off the thin loop 110.<br>
As shown m FIG. 7A, after the second lever 104 which is integrated with the first lever 102 is rotated to be m a straight line state against the first lever 102, or after the second lever 104 is completely detached from the first lever 102 to be in a straight line state against the first lever 102, the second lever 104 is pushed towards the first lever 102, and the locking projection 113 on the second lever 104 is inserted into the reentrant groove 111 on the first lever 102 to be locked to the locking protrusion 112 within the reentrant groove 111. As a result, the second lever 104 is coupled with the first lever 102 in a straight line state, as shown in FIG. 7B. At the time, since the deviation preventing projection 114 on the upper portion of the reentrant groove 111 is in contact with the upper surface of the locking projection 113 of the second lever 104, the locking<br>
projection 113 is not easily deviated from the reentrant groove 111. Accordingly, the separation of the second lever 104 from the first lever 102 is not generated.<br>
Meanwhile, when the locking projection 113 on the second lever 104 is inserted into the reentrant groove 111 on the first lever 102, the auxiliary locking projection 116 of the second lever 104 is locked to the auxiliary locking protrusion 115 of the first lever 102, such that a rigid coupling of the second lever 104 with the first lever 102 is ensured.<br>
Thereafter, when the front panel 5 is coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the whole portion of the first lever 102 is all received within the room portion la of the body 1 and the front end portion of the second lever 104 being in a straight state against the first lever 102 is exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4.<br>
In the window type air conditioner having the ventilating device constructed according to the first embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 7B and 9, the damper 103 on the first lever 102 closes the ventilating hole 101, such that the room portion la and the outdoor portion lb within the body 1 are not connected with each other. In this case, although the<br>
air conditioner is in an air conditioning state, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is not supplied to the room portion la, thereby not achieving the ventilation of the room.<br>
If the ventilation is desired in the states as shown in FIGS. 7B and 9, the pair of grooves 105 of the second lever 104 exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 are grasped and then the second lever 104 is pulled out, such that the second lever 104 is coupled with the first lever 102 in a straight line state. Thereby, the first lever 102 is moved forwardly with the second lever 104, and at the time, since the guide projection 108 is inserted into the vertical groove 107 on the first lever 102 and the first lever 102 is hook-locked to the pair of hookers 109, the first lever 102 is not deviated under the guide of the guide projection 108 and horizontally moves in a forward direction. Accordingly, as shown by a dotted line of FIG. 7B, since the damper 103 opens the ventilating hole 101 on the partition 6, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is supplied to the room portion la through the ventilating hole 11. The supplied air is mixed with a cool air by the heat exchange 8 and is discharged to the room through<br>
the discharge panel 4 of the front panel 5, thus achieving the ventilation of the room.<br>
If the ventilation is not further desired, the pair of grooves<br>
105	of the second lever 104 are grasped and the second lever<br>
104 is pushed back.<br>
When the pair of grooves 105 on the second lever 104 are grasped to pull out or push back the second lever 104, the knurling<br>
106	formed on the grooves 105 can prevent the user"s hand from<br>
being slid.<br>
FIGS. 11A and 11B are cross-sectional views illustrating mam parts of a window type air conditioner having a ventilating device constructed according to a second embodiment of the present invention, in which FIG. 11A shows the state that the whole portion of a second lever is received in a room portion of a body, and FIG. 7B shows the state that the front end portion of the second lever is exposed to the outside of a front panel of the body. FIG. 12 is a perspective view illustrating separation between the first and second levers constituting the ventilating device of FIGS. 11A and 11B, and FIG. 13 is a perspective view of a bottom surface illustrating the mam parts of the second lever constituting the ventilating device of FIGS. 11A and 11B. FIG.<br>
14 is a sectional view taken along the line IV-IV of FIG. 11B. In the ventilating device according to the second embodiment of the present invention, since the construction of the second lever 104 is different from that of the first embodiment of the present invention, explanation on the rest of components will be avoided for the brevity of description.<br>
Now, the construction of the second lever 104 in the ventilating device according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be m detail discussed.<br>
In construction, an upper supporting member 117 and a lower<br>
supporting member 118 are spaced by a predetermined interval<br>
on the front end portion of the first lever 102. A center axis<br>
119 is formed on the center portion of the upper portion surface<br>
of the lower supporting member 118 and is upwardly inclined gradually<br>
from the front portion thereof to the back portion thereof. A<br>
disk type of inserting projection 120 is formed on the back end<br>
portion of the second lever 104 and is inserted between the upper<br>
supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 on<br>
the first lever 102. A center hole 121 is formed on the center<br>
portion of the inserting projection 120 and is inserted into<br>
the center axis 119 of the lower supporting member 118, when<br>
the inserting projection 12 0 is inserted between the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118. As a result, the second lever 104 is coupled with the first lever 102 to be horizontally rotated.<br>
A locking pin 122 is formed on the outside of the lower surface of the upper supporting member 117, and an upper guide groove 123 which is installed on the peripheral surface of the upper portion of the inserting projection 120 and when the rotation of the second lever 104, is adapted to guide the locking pin 122. First and second locking grooves 124 and 125 are formed within the upper guide groove 123 and selectively lock the locking pm 122 upon the rotation of the second lever 104. A protrusion 12 6 is formed on the one side of the outside peripheral surface of the inserting projection 120 and is in contact with the side surface of the first lever 102 to suppress the rotation of the second lever 104 in the state where the second lever 104 is in the straight line state against the first lever 102. A lower guide groove 127 is formed on the lower surface of the inserting projection 120 and is downward-inclined gradually from the outside peripheral surface thereof to the center portion thereof to guide the center axis 119 on the lower supporting member 118, when<br>
the insertingp rojection 12 0 is inserted between the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 in the state where the second lever 104 is perpendicular to the first lever 102.<br>
Now, the assembling process of each of components in the ventilating device as mentioned in the above will be discussed.<br>
If the inserting projection 120 on the second lever 104 is inserted between the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 on the first lever 102 in the state where the second lever 104 is perpendicular to the first lever 102, the center axis 119 of the lower supporting member 118 is guided by the lower guide groove 127 of the inserting projection 120. Then, the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 formed on the first lever 102 each open upwardly and downwardly, by their own elastic force due to a characteristic of a mold material, and at the moment that the center axis 119 is completely deviated from the lower guide groove 127, the center axis 119 is inserted into the center hole 121 on the inserting<br>
projection 120. Simultaneously, as the open state of the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 is restored to an original state, the inserting projection 120 of the second lever 104 is fully inserted between the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 on the first lever 102. Accordingly, the second lever 104 is perpendicular to the first lever 102 and is rotatable m the horizontal direction. At the time, when considering that the center axis 119 formed on the center portion on the lower supporting member 118 on the first lever 102 is upward-inclined gradually from the front portion thereof to the back portion thereof, the center axis 119 is easily guided to the lower guide groove 127 on the inserting projection 120 of the second lever 104.<br>
As explained in the above, the lower guide groove 12 7 which is formed on the inserting projection 120 on the second lever 104 is downward-inclined gradually from the outside peripheral surface thereof to the center portion thereof. The reason of this forming method is that the center axis 119 is easily guided to the lower guide groove 127 and is inserted into the center hole 121 on the inserting projection 120 of the first lever 102, when the inserting projection 120 on the second lever 104 is<br>
inserted between the upper supporting member 117 and the lower supporting member 118 on the first lever 102.<br>
In the state where the second lever 104 is perpendicular to the first lever 102 and is rotatable in the horizontal direction, the locking pin 122 on the upper supporting member 117 of the first lever 102 is guided to the upper guide groove 123 on the inserting projection 120 of the second lever 104 and is then locked to the first locking groove 124 of the first and second locking grooves 124 and 125 on the upper guide groove 123.<br>
Under the above state, the installation process of the first lever 102 to be horizontally moved forwardly and backwardly, without deviation from the bottom surface of the discharge grill 4, is the same as that of the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Next, when the front panel 5 is coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the first lever 102 and the second lever 104 which is coupled with the first lever 102 and is horizontally rotated are all received within the room portion la of the body 1. In the case, it can be understood that both of the first and second levers 102 and 104 are not exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the air conditioner is attached to the window 9, the front panel 5 coupled with the body 1 is first detached, and the second lever 104 which is perpendicular to the first lever 102 rotates in a counterclockwise direction. Thereby, the second lever 104 is coupled with the first lever 102 in a straight line state.<br>
Then, under the state as shown in FIG. 11A, if the second lever 104 is pressurized in the counterclockwise direction, since the center axis 119 on the first lever 102 is inserted to the center hole 121 on the inserting projection of the second lever 104, the second lever 104 rotates in the counterclockwise direction on the basis of the center axis 119. At the time, the locking pin 122 on the upper supporting member 117 is detached from the first locking groove 124 within the upper guide groove 123 on the second lever 104 and at the same time, since the protrusion 126 on the inserting projection 120 is in contact with the one side of the first lever 102, the second lever 104 is further not rotated in the counterclockwise direction and becomes in the straight line state against the first lever 102, as shown in FIG. 11B. Under this state, since the locking pin 122 on the upper supporting member 117 is inserted into the second locking<br>
groove 125 on the upper guide groove 123, the second lever 104 can not be reversely rotated.<br>
Thereafter, when the front panel 5 is coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the whole portion of the first lever 102 is all received within the room portion la of the body 1, and only the front end portion of the second lever 104 being in a straight state against the first lever 102 is exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4.<br>
In the window type air conditioner having the ventilating device constructed according to the second embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 11B and 14, the damper 103 on the first lever 102 closes the ventilating hole 101, such that the room portion la and the outdoor portion lb separated by the partition 6 are not connected with each other. In this case, although the air conditioner is in an air conditioning state, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2 is not supplied to the room portion la, thereby not achieving the ventilation of the room.<br>
If the ventilation is desired m the states as shown in FIGS. 11B and 14, the pair of grooves 105 of the second lever<br>
104 exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 are grasped and then the second lever 104 is pulled out forwardly, whereas if the ventilation is not further desired, the second lever 104 is pushed back.<br>
FIG. 15 is a cross-sectional view illustrating main parts of a window type air conditioner having a ventilating device constructed according to a third embodiment of the pre sent invention, which shows the state that the front end portion of a second lever is exposed to the outside of a front panel of the body. FIG. 16 is a perspective view illustrating separation between the first and second levers constituting the ventilating device of FIG. 15, FIG. 17A is a sectional view taken along the line V-V of FIG. 15, which shows the state where the whole portion of a second lever is received in a room portion of a body, and FIG. 17B is a sectional view taken along the line V-V of FIG. 15, which shows the state where the front end portion of a second lever is exposed to the outside of a front panel of the body.<br>
In the ventilating device according to the third embodiment of the present invention, since the construction of the second lever 104 is different from those of the first and second embodiments of the present invention, explanation on the rest of components<br>
will be avoided for the brevity of description.<br>
Now, the construction of the second lever 104 in the ventilating device according to the third embodiment of the present invention will be in detail discussed.<br>
In construction, a pair of hinge members 128, which are formed opposite to each other on the upper surface of the front end portion of the first lever 102, are spaced by a predetermined interval from each other. A hinge hole 129 is formed on each of the hinge members 128, and an inserting projection 130, which is formed on the rear end portion of the second lever 104, is inserted between the hinge members 128. A hinge axis 131, which is formed on the end portion of the inserting projection 130, is inserted to the hinge hole 129 on the hinge members 128. The hinge axis 131 is outward-inclined gradually from the rear portion thereof to the front portion thereof to be easily inserted into the hinge hole 129. As a result, the second lever 104 is coupled with the first lever 102 and thus is vertically rotatable.<br>
Stoppers 132 are each formed on the top portions of the opposite surfaces of the hinge members 128, each of which has a round type of rear portion edge and a right angle of front portion edge. Thereby, under the state where the hinge axis 131<br>
is inserted into the hinge hole 129, the second lever 104 coupled with the first lever 102 is capable of being vertically rotated in a straight line state against the first lever 102, and under the state where the second lever 104 completes the vertical rotation, the second lever 104 can not be reversely rotated.<br>
Now, the assembling process of each of components in the ventilating device as mentioned in the above will be discussed.<br>
If the inserting projection 130 on the second lever 104 is inserted between the pair of hinge members 128 on the first lever 102, the hinge axis 131 on the end portion of the inserting projection 130 is forcibly inserted between the pair of hinge members 128 and is then inserted into the hinge hole 129. Hence, in the state where the second lever 104 maintains a predetermined angle against the first lever 102, as shown in FIG. 17A, the second lever 104 is coupled with the front end portion of the first lever 102 and can be vertically rotated. As explained in the above, the hinge axis 131 which is formed on the end portion of the inserting projection 130 on the second lever 104 is outward-inclined gradually from the rear portion thereof to the front portion thereof. The reason of this forming method is that the hinge axis 131 is easily inserted into the hinge hole 129<br>
when the inserting projection 130 of the second lever 104 is inserted between the hinge members 128 on the first lever 102. Under the above state, after the first lever 102 coupled with the second lever 104 is all received within the room portion la of the body 1, the installation process of the first lever 102 to be horizontally moved forwardly and backwardly, without deviation from the bottom surface of the discharge grill 4, is the same as that of the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Next, when the front panel 5 is coupled with the front surface of the body 1, the first lever 102 and the second lever 104 which is coupled with the first lever 102 and is vertically rotated are all received within the room portion la of the body 1. In the case, it can be understood that both of the first and second levers 102 and 104 are not exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where the air conditioner is attached to the window 9, the front panel 5 coupled with the body 1 is first detached, and the second lever 104 which maintains the predetermined angle against the first lever 102 rotates in a counterclockwise direction. Thereby, the inserting projection<br>
130 on the second lever 104 is inserted between the pair of hinge members 128 on the first lever 102, and thus the hinge axis 131 on the inserting projection 130 is inserted into the hinge hole 129 on the hinge members 128. Accordingly, the second lever 1,04 completely rotates in the counterclockwise direction and becomes in the straight line state against the first lever 102, as shown in FIG. 17B.<br>
Under this state as shown in FIG. 17A, if the second lever 104 which is coupled with the first lever 102 in the vertical rotatable state rotates in the counterclockwise direction, since the rear portions of the stoppers 132 are rounded, the inserting projection 130 on the second lever 104 is momentarily guided to the rounded portion of the stopper 132. At the time, since the first lever 102 and the hinge members 128 are all made of a mold material, each of the hinge members 128 opens outwardly by receiving the pressurized force of the stopper 132 until the inserting projection 130 passes through the stoppers 132. After the inserting project ion 130 completely passes through the stoppers 132, the outwardly opened hinge members 128 can be restored to an original state due to a characteristic of the mold material, since the pressurized force of the inserting projection 130 is<br>
not further delivered to the hinge members 128. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 17B, in the state where the second lever 104 completely rotates in the counterclockwise direction in the straight line state against the first lever 102, the stopper 132 on the hinge members 128 prevents the second lever 104 from being reversely rotated.<br>
Thereafter, when the front panel 5 is recoupled with the front surface of the body 1, the whole portion of the first lever 102 is all received within the room portion la of the body 1, and only the front end portion of the second lever 104 being in a straight state against the first lever 102 is exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 through the discharge grill 4.<br>
In the window type air conditioner having the ventilating device constructed according to the third embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 15 and 17B, the damper 103 of the first lever 102 closes the ventilating hole 101, such that the room portion la and the outdoor portion lb separated by the partition 6 are not connected with each other. In this case, although the air conditioner is in an air conditioning state, the air of outdoors within the outdoor portion lb flowing through the air holes 2<br>
is not supplied to the room portion la, thereby not achieving the ventilation of the room.<br>
If the ventilation is desired in the states as shown in FIGS. 15 and 17B, the pair of grooves 105 of the second lever 104 exposed to the exterior of the front panel 5 are grasped and then the second lever 104 is pulled out forwardly, whereas if the ventilation is not further desired, the second lever 104 is pushed back.<br>
As apparent from the foregoing, a ventilating device of a window type air conditioner according to the present invention can, since the first and second levers are all received within the room portion of the body during the shipment of the product, give the following advantages: a) upon package of the product for shipment, a package area is reduced to decrease the cost of package as well as the cost of delivery; and b) during the package and delivery, the tearing off of the package box or the breakage of the first and second levers can be prevented.<br>
In addition, a ventilating device of a window type air conditioner according to the present invention is capable of simplifying the assembling structure of the first lever for moving forwardly and backwardly in a horizontal state, without deviation,<br>
to thereby increase the yield of production.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in a ventilating device of a window type air conditioner of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
