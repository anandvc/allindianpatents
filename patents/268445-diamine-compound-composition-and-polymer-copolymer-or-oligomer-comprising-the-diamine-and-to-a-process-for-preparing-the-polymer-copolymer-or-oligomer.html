Photocrosslinkable materials<br>
The invention relates to diamine compounds, represented by the general formula (I), and also relates to oligomers, polymers and copolymers from the class of polyamic acids, polyamic acid esters or polyimides (and any mixtures thereof) obtained by the reaction of a diamine compound represented by the general formula (I) and optionally of one or more additional other diamines, with one or more tetracarboxylic acid anhydrides, and to the use of these diamine compounds, oligomers, polymers and copolymers for the preparation of orientation layers for liquid crystals and in the construction of unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems.<br>
Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are becoming increasingly dominant in advanced visualization devices. LCDs offer favourable characteristics with respect to image quality (high luminance, high resolution, colour and grey scale capability), power consumption as well as dimensions and weight (flat panel displays). The use of commercial LCDs has become widespread, e.g. in automotive and telecommunication instruments, as well as in monitors of notebooics, desktop computers, television sets, etc. Today the need for LCDs in television applications is rapidly growing. Recently developed LCD modes possess high potentials in achieving fast response times, wide viewing angles and high luminance. Amongst other newly developed LCD modes, the MVA (multi-domain vertical alignment) mode appears to be the most promising for the use In modem television applications.<br>
In the MVA mode the liquid crystal molecules are usually nearly vertically aligned with respect to the surface of the substrates. By using protrusions (or other alignment subdivisions) on the surface of the substrate, the liquid crystal molecules become locally pre-tllted within a single cell in more than one direction, leading to domains switchable in different directions. This multi-domain configuration exhibits very good display perfonnance, with wide viewing angles of up to 160° In any direction, short response times (below 20 ms), high contrast ratios (up to 700:1) and high brightness.<br><br>
However, by means of using protrusions only, it is difficult to clearly define the domain space within a single pixel. Therefore the MVA mode demands additional manufacturing steps to ensure shape effects as well as electrical field effects on both the upper and lower substrate; hence all in all leading to complex manufacturing procedures.<br>
In order to by-pass this technical challenge, the availability of an alignment layer would be desirable, which directly leads to pre-defined alignment directions within each pixel domain and having well controllable off-axis angles with respect to the normal axis of the substrate.<br>
Methods for the preparation of orientation layers for liquid crystal materials are well known to the skilled person. Customarily used uniaxially rubbed polymer orientation layers, such as for example polyimides, however, do have a series of disadvantages, like the formation and deposition of dust during the rubbing process and concomitant partial destruction of the thin film transistors. Scratches due to brushing is another issue associated with this technique, which is particularly evident when the pixels are of the order of 10 microns or even lower, like e.g. in micro-display applications. Because of the strong optical magnification, which is required to visualize the displayed information, scratches easily become visible and are also the cause for the reduction of the contrast level. Furthermore, the rubbing process does not allow the production of structured layers.<br>
The production procedure for obtaining orientation layers in which the direction of orientation is induced by irradiation with polarized light is not faced with the problems inherent to the rubbing process. With the irradiation technique it is furihennore also possible to create areas having different orientation and thus to structure the orientation layer as described for example in Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 31 (1992), 2155-64 (Schadt et al).<br>
Using the lineariy photo-polymerif able alignment (LPP) technique, the possibility of realizing a four-domain vertical aligned nematic (VAN) LCD was demonstrated some years ago (K. Schmitt, M. Schadt;v Proceedings of EuroDlsplay 99, 6-9 September,<br><br>
1999). The four-domain VAN-LCD exhibits an excellent off-state angular brightness performance.<br>
Apart from the current display performance requirements to be fulfilled in modem TV applications, the use of appropriate LPP materials is furthermore also guided by the necessity to achieve specific optical and electro-optical properties, e.g. with respect to the compatibility with the TFT (thin film transistors). Other important characteristics of the materials must also be taken Into consideration, i.e. those crucial parameters directly related to and dependent on the molecular properties of the material.<br>
Primarily such characteristics are;<br>
•	High voltage holding ratio (VHR), i.e. VHR of &gt; 90 % (measured at 80' C)<br>
•	High stability of the induced pre-tilt angle against light and heat<br>
•	Low alignment energy profile (short irradiation time and/or low In-adiation energy)<br>
In the case of LCDs of thin-film transistor type a certain amount of charge is applied over the course of a very short period of time to the electrodes of a pixel and must not subsequently drain away by means of the resistance of the liquid crystal. The ability to hold that charge and thus to hold the voltage drop over the liquid crystal is quantified by what is known as the "voltage holding ratio" (VHR). It is the ratio of the RMS-voltage (root mean square voltage) at a pixel within one frame period and the initial value of the voltage applied.<br>
Photo-reactive materials for orientation layers with improved voltage holding ratios (VHR) are described in WO-A-99/49360, US 6,066,696, US 6,027,772, WO-A-99/15576 and WO-A-99/51662. In WO-A-99M9360, US 6,066,696 and US 6,027,772 blends of polymeric compounds are described, containing photo-reactive polymers and polyimldes.<br>
In WO-A-99/15576 and WO-A-99/51662 polyimldes having photo-reactive cinnamate groups incorporated in their side chains are described. WO-A-99/15576 for instance<br>
-'t<br>
discloses photo-active polymers which contain as side-chain specific photo-cross-<br><br>
linkable groups and of which a typical monomer unit is 6-{2-methoxy-4-[(1E)-3-methoxy-3-oxoprop-1 -enyllphenoxy}hexyl 3,5-diamineben2oate.<br>
In the above cited references it was generally demonstrated that in order to achieve the aforementioned important parameters, molecular structures combining firstly a polyamic/polyimide backbone (i.e. delivering molecular polarity) and secondly side chains with an incorporated photo-reactive group, such as a cinnamic acid residue, are suitable for the general concept of planar orientation [requiring only slight pretilt angles, like e.g. being used in TN (twisted nematic) devices]. However, these types of molecular structures, primarily developed for TN applications, cannot directly be utilized in MVA applications.<br>

For example, the amidisation, poly-condensation reaction for the preparation of the polyamic acids is carried out In solution in a polar aprotic organic solvent, such as y-butyrolactone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or N,N-dimethyl-fomiamlde. In most cases equimolar amounts of the anhydride and the diamine are used, i.e. one amino group per anhydride group. If It is desired to stabilize the molecular weight of the polymer, copolymer or oligomer, it is possible for that purpose to either add an excess or a less-than-stoichiometric amount of one of the two components or to add a mono-functional compound in the form of a dicarboxylic acid monoanhydride or in the fomn of a monoamine. Examples of such mono-functional compounds are maleic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, aniline and the like. Preferably the reaction is cam'ed out at temperatures of less than 100 'C.<br>
The imidisation, cyclisation of the polyamic acids to form the polyimides can be carried<br>
out by heating, i.e. by condensation with removal of water or by other imidisation<br>
reactions using appropriate reagents.<br>
Partially imidisation is achieved for example, if the imidisation is canied out purely<br>
themnally, the imidisation of the polyamic acids may not always be complete, i.e. the<br>
resulting polyimides may still contain proportions of polyamic acid.<br>
Complete imidisation reactions are carried out at temperatures between 60 and<br>
250 °C, preferably at temperatures of less than 200 °C.<br><br>
In order to achieve imidisation at lower temperatures additional reagents that facilitate the removal of water are added to the reaction mixture. Such reagents are, for example, mixtures consisting of acid anhydrides, such as acetic acid anhydride, propionic acid anhydride, phthalic acid anhydride, trifluoroacetic acid anhydride or tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, lutidine, coiiidine etc. The amount of aforementioned additional reagents that facilitate the removal of water is preferably at least four equivalents of acid anhydride and two equivalents of amine per equivalent of polyamic acid to be condensed.<br>
The imidization degree of each polymer used in the liquid crystal alignment agent of the invention can be arbitrarily adjusted by controlling the catalyst amount, reaction time and reaction temperature employed in production of the polymer. In the present description, "imidization degree" of polymer refers to a proportion (expressed in %) of the number of recurring units of polymer forming an imide ring or an isoimide ring to the number of total recun'ing units of polymer, in the present description, the imidization degree of a polyamic acid not subjected to dehydration and ring closure is 0%. The imidization degree of each polymer is determined by dissolving the polymer in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide, subjecting the resulting solution to ^H-NMR measurement at a room temperature using tetramethylsilane as a standard substance, and calculating from the following formula.<br>
Imidization degree (%) = 1-(AVA2 X B)X100<br>
A^ Peak area based on protons of NH groups (in the vicinity of 10ppm) A^: Peak area based of one proton of acrylate double bond (in the vicinity of 6.5 ppm). B: Proportion of the number of acrylate protons to one proton of NH group in the polymer precursor<br>
The imidization degree is usually ih the range of 1 to 99%, preferably 5 to 50%, more preferably 10 to 40%.<br>

A further embodiment of the present invention concerns a polymer, copolymer or oligomer layer, in particular orientation layer, comprising at least one polymer, copolymer or oligomer according to the present invention.<br>
It is understood that the polymer or oligomer layers of the present Invention (in form of a polymer gel, a polymer network, a polymer film, etc.) can also be used as orientation layers for liquid crystals. A further prefenred embodiment of the invention relates to an orientation layer comprising one or more polymers or oligomers according to the invention, preferably in a cross-linked form. Such orientation layers can be used in the manufacture of unstructured or structured opticai-or electro-optical elements, preferably in the production of hybrid layer elements.<br>
In addition, the present invention concerns a method for the preparation of a polymer layer or oligomer layer, wherein one or more polymers, copolymers or oligomers according to the present invention is applied to a support, preferably from a solution of the polymer or oligomer material and subsequent evaporation of the solvent, and wherein, after any imidisation step which may be necessary, the polymer or oligomer or polymer mixture or oligomer mixture treated with aligning light, and preferably isomerized and/or cross-linked by irradiation with aligning light.<br><br>
A preferred method of the present invention concerns a method, wherein the direction of orientation and the tilt angle within the polymer layer or oligomer layer is varied by controlling the direction of the irradiation with aligning light, and/or wherein by selectively irradiating specific regions of the polymer layer or oligomer layer specific regions of the layer are aligned.<br>
The orientation layers are suitably prepared from a solution of the polymer or oligomer material. The polymer or oligomer solution is applied to a support optionally coated with an electrode [for example a glass plate coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO)] so that homogeneous layers of 0.05 to 50 jam thickness are produced. In this process different coating techniques lil<e spin-coating meniscus-coating wire-coating slot-coating offset-printing flexo-printing gravur-printing may be used. then or optionally after a prior imidisation step the regions to oriented are inradiated for example with high-pressure mercury vapour lamp xenon pulsed uv laser using polarizer and mask creating images of structures.></e>

Further, the present invention concerns preferably the use of a polymer layer, copolymer or oligomer layer for the induction of vertical alignment of adjacent liquid crystalline layers, in particular for operating a cell in MVA mode.<br>
The Irradiation time is dependent upon the output of the individual lamps and can vary from a few seconds to several hours. The photo-reaction (dimerisatlon, polymersiation, cross-linking) can also be carried out, however, by Irradiation of the homogeneous layer using filters that, for example, allow only the radiation suitable for the cross-"   linking reaction to pass through.<br>
It is understood that the polymer or oligomer layers of the invention may be used in the production of optical or electro-optical devices having at least one orientation layer as well as unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems.<br><br>

More preferably, the present Invention concerns an orientation layer, comprising at least one polymer layer, copolymer or oligomer layer according to the present invention.<br>
The advantages of the present invention could not be foreseen by a skilled person. It has surprisingly been found, that In addition to the polyamlc/polyimide backbone, the introduction of an organofluorine group into a peripheral position of the polymer side groups having specific molecular architecture plays a predominant role in obtaining MVA materials having optimised properties, such as the required high voltage holding ratios, the adjustable pre-tllt angles required for the MVA mode and their stability to light and heat.<br><br>

Example 19 Preparation of an orientation layer for vertical alignment with non-polarized UV light<br>
A 4% solution of LPP (see molecular structure on figure 1 )in a solvent mixture of N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolldone (NMP) and Butylglycol (BC) in a ratio of 1: 9 by weight was prepared. This LPP solution was filtered over a 2µm Teflon filter and applied to two indium tin oxyde (ITO) coated rectangular glass plates by spin coating at 1350 rpm for 30 seconds. The resulting films were then pre-drled for 5 minutes at 130OC and further post-baked for 40 minutes at 200'C. Both ITO covered glass plates were irradiated with non-polarised UV light at a dose of 48mJ/cm2. The direction of incidence of the light being Inclined by 10° relative to the plate normal and the incidence plane was parallel to the short side of the substrate. The two irradiated plates were used to build a cell of 20 µm spacing in an anti-parallel manner such that the irradiated surfaces were facing each other. The cell was then capillary filled with liquid crystal mixture MLC6610 from Merck in the isotropic phase at 105°C. The cell was then gradually cooled down at a rate of 0.1°C/min from T=105Oc to T=85oC and at a rate of 2 C/min from T=85°C to room temperature. When arranged between crossed polarisers , the cell appeared unifonnly black for every angle between the short edge of the ceil and the polariser transmission axis, as long as viewed from the vertical, in conclusion, the liquid crystal mixture was aligned homeotropically.<br>
When the short edge of the cell was set at 45° to the polariser axis and an AC voltage of 7V and 90Hz was applied, the liquid crystals switched and caused the cell to appear green (high order birefringence). No defects or tilt domains were   observed.   Brightness   and   colour   of  the   switched   cell   changed<br><br>
asymmetrically when viewed from opposite, but equal oblique angles along a plane parallel to the short edge of the cell. Contrary, no asymmetry was found when viewed obliquely from opposite angles within a plane parallel to the long edge of the cell. When the switched cell with its short edge was aligned parallel or perpendicular to one of the poiariser transmission axes the cell appeared dark again. From above observations we concluded that LC alignment capability was induced in the thin film on the substrate due to Irradiation with slantwise incident non-polarized light. The azimuthal alignment direction was parallel to the plane of incidence of the non-polarized uv-light. From tilt angle evaluation by means of the crystal rotation method a tilt angle value of 89.2° with respect to the substrate surface was obtained. The direction of the LC molecules was in between the surface normal and the direction of the incident light.<br>
Example 20 Production of an orientation layer having a defined angle of tilt with unpolarized UV light<br>
The same type of experiment has been done with the same LPP, except that<br>
the direction of incidence of the light was inclined by 40° relative to the plate nonnal. The azimuthal alignment direction was parallel to the plane of incidence of the non-polarized UV-light. From tilt angle evaluation by means of the crystal rotation method a tilt angle value of 88.65° with respect to the substrate surface was obtained. The direction of the LC molecules was in between the surface nonnal and the direction of the incident light.<br><br><br>

Example for the Production of an orientation layer having a defined angle of tilt<br>
2% solution of Polyamic acid 1 in cyclopentanone is filtered over a 0.2 µM Teflon filter and applied to a glass plate, which has been coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO), in a spin-coating apparatus at 3000 rev./min. in the course of 60 seconds. The resulting film is then predried for 15 minutes at 130 "C and then imidized for 1 hour at 200 "C to form a polyimide film. The so obtained LPP film is irradiated for 30mJ/cm2 with linearly polarised UV light, the direction of incidence of the light being inclined by 20" to 40° relative to the plate normal. The direction of polarisation of the light was kept in the plane defined by the direction of incidence of the light and the plate normal. From both plates a cell of 20 µm spacing is built such that the illuminated surfaces are facing each other and the previous polarisation directions of illumination are parallel. The cell is then filled with liquid crystal mixture MLC6609 from Merck in the isotropic phase at 100°C. The cell is then gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate ranging from 0.1'C/min to 2C/min. Between crossed polarisers a uniformly oriented liquid crystal layer is observed. The tilt angle of this parallel cell, by crystal rotation method, was 88.7°.<br>
Example for the Detemriination of the voitaae holding ratio (VHR)<br>
Two glass plates coated in accordance with the above example are irradiated perpendicularly during 4 minutes with linearly polarised UV light. From both plates a<br><br>
cell of 10µm spacing is built such that the illuminated surfaces were facing each other and the previous polarisation directions of illumination are parallel. This cell is then maintained at 120° C under high vacuum for 14 hours and thereafter filled with TFT liquid crystal mixture MLC6610 from Merck in vacuum at room temperature. Between crossed polarisers a unifomnly oriented liquid crystal layer is observed. Prior to testing the voltage holding ratio (VHR) the cell is first subjected to ageing for 50 hours at 120 C The voltage decay V (at T=20ms) of a voltage surge of 64 µS with Vo (V at t=0)=0.2V is then measured over a period of T=20ms. The voltage holding ratio then determined, given by VHR=Vm8(t=T)A/o,<br><br><br>
