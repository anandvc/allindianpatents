				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a body cover structure of a small-sized vehicle such as a motorcycle or tricycle.<br><br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In such a small-sized vehicle, the front of each leg portion of a rider is covered with a leg shield to prevent the rider's legs from being exposed directly to wind and rain during vehicular running.<br>
In scooter type vehicles, in many cases, leg shields are formed integrally with a front cover which covers the front of a head pipe, overhanging right and left behind the<br>
head pipe. <br>
However, in the event either the right or the left leg shield is damaged, it is required to replace the whole, which is uneconomical. Besides, the rider may want to remove the leg shields during vehicular running, but it is impossible to easily meet such request.<br><br>
         In view of this point there has been proposed an<br>
           example (Japanese Patent Laid -open No. Hei 5-8779) in which<br>
           right and left leg shields are formed separately and<br>
consideration is given to riding in a removed state of leg shields.<br>
In the above proposed example, a front cover which covers the front of a head pipe and a frame cover which covers a frame behind the head pipe are formed dividedly. As shown in Fig. 19, right and left leg shields 03 expand outside with front-side edges thereof being held between the front cover 01 and the frame cover 02. <br>
The front-side edges of the leg shield 03 are each formed at an opposed position of both a front-side mounting slot 03a and a rear-side mounting slot 03b. Both side end portions of the front cover 01 are inserted into the right<br>
and left front-side mounting slots 03a, while both front side end portions of the frame cover 02 are inserted into the right and left rear-side mounting slots 03b. The front cover 01 and the frame cover 02 are thus mounted.<br>
Since the front-side edges of the leg shields 03 are sandwiched in between the front cover 01 and the frame cover 02, the mounting and removal of the leg shields 03 can be done easily, that is, a change to a leg shield-free body cover can be done easily.<br>
[ Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In removing the leg shields 03, however, the front-side edges of the leg shields 03 held between the front cover 01 and the frame cover 02 are pulled out, so that after removal of the leg shields 03 there is formed a clearance between both the covers 01, 02.  Since this portion is visible from the exterior, the presence of such a clearance is not desirable from the standpoint of appearance and causes deterioration of the commercial value.<br>
Further, since the mating surfaces of the lower half portion of the frame cover 02 and the leg shields 03 extend substantially along the main frame when seen from a side,<br>
the removal of the leg shields 03 results in substantial exposure of devices disposed below the main frame such as, for example, an air cleaner and a carburetor. This condition is not desirable in point of appearance and permits easy deposition of dust and the like on those devices . <br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above-mentioned point and it is an object of the invention to provide a body cover structure of a small-sized vehicle which permits easy mounting and removal of leg shields and which retains good appearance even with leg shields removed.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems and Function and Effect]<br>
According to claim 1 in the present invention, in order to achieve the above-mentioned object, there is provided a body cover structure of a small-sized vehicle wherein the front of a head pipe of a body frame is covered with a front cover, the body frame comprising the head pipe and a main pipe extending obliquely backward and downward from the head pipe, the main pipe is covered with a main pipe cover extending backward from the rear side of the head pipe along the main pipe, and separate, right and left<br>
leg shields are mounted sandwichedly between the front cover and the main pipe cover, characterized in that the main pipe cover covers the main pipe from above and both right and left side walls thereof hang down so that mating surfaces at side edges of the side walls are positioned to cover sideways the space below the main pipe.<br>
Since the main pipe cover covers the main pipe from above and both right and left side walls thereof hang down so that mating surfaces at side edges of the said side walls are positioned to cover sideways the space below the main pipe, even when the leg shields are removed, the devices disposed in the space below the main pipe are covered sideways with the main pipe cover and are not exposed, so that not only good appearance can be retained but also the deposition of dust and the like on those devices can be avoided as far as possible.<br>
According to claim 2, in combination with claim 1, an internal combustion engine is disposed below the rear portion of the main pipe, and an intake system extending upward from the internal combustion engine is disposed in the space below the main pipe and is covered sideways with the main pipe cover.  In this construction, component<br>
devices of the intake system are covered with the main pipe cover, whereby not only good appearance can be retained but also it is possible to minimize the deposition of dust and the like on those devices.<br>
According to claim 3, in combination with claim 1 or claim 2, the front cover and the main pipe cover are arranged in a superimposed fashion when seen from a side, so that no clearance is formed in the removed state of leg shields, and this is preferable in point of appearance. <br>
According to claim 4, in combination with claim 3, since side edges of the front cover and main pipe cover are superimposed each other when seen from a side, the superimposition is made at such a minimum portion and hence there is no waste, thus permitting easy mounting and removal of leg shields.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a body cover structure of a small-sized vehicle such as motor cycle or tricycle wherein an internal combustion engine is disposed below the<br><br>
rear portion of a body frame having a main pipe extending<br>
backward and obiquely downward from a head pipe,<br>
an  intake  system  extending  upward  from  said  internal<br>
combustion engine is disposed below said main pipe,<br>
said body cover comprises a front top cover covering the front<br>
of said head pipe, a main pipe top cover extending backward<br>
from the rear side of said head pipe along said main pipe and<br>
right and left main pipe side covers hang down from said main<br>
pipe top cover,  and separate,  right and left leg shields<br>
provided in front of said main pipe side cover,<br>
wherein said leg shields are detachably mounted sandwichedly<br>
between said front top cover and said main pipe side cover at<br>
an upper portion thereof,<br>
characterized in that said leg shields are detachably mounted<br>
sandwichedly between said front top cover and said main pipe<br>
side cover at said upper portion thereof in superimposed<br>
manner when seen from a side,<br>
said leg shields are detachably attached to the front of said<br>
main pipe<br>
side cover at an lower portion thereof in such a manner as<br>
that an upper edge of said leg shield is aligned with a lower<br>
edge of said main pipe side cover,<br>
said main pipe side covers extends to the side of said intake<br>
system at<br>
the front edge thereof, and<br>
said main pipe side covers covers said intake system in a<br>
state that said leg shield is detached.<br><br>

The upper portion of the front wheel 19 is covered with a front fender 46, while the upper rear portion of the rear wheel 22 is covered with a rear fender 47.<br>
A front basket 48 is attached to the front face of the front cover 40.<br>
The motorcycle 1 is generally covered with the body cover as described above. The front half portion of the body cover is shown in Fig. 4 which is an enlarged side view and in which the front basket 48 is omitted. The front basket 48 is mounted by co-clamping with the front top cover 40 in such a manner as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
The front top cover 4 0 , main pipe top cover 41 , and main pipe side cover 42, are fixed to the body frame 2. But the leg shields 43 are mounted removably in a sandwiched state between the front and rear covers.<br>
The front top cover 40 which covers the front of the head pipe 2 is clamped, together with the front basket 48, to a mounting stay 55 which is connected to a mounting piece 51 projecting forward from the head pipe 3, as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
The mounting stay 55 comprises a body plate 55a whose<br><br>
front face faces forward and obliquely upward and a connecting piece 55b projecting from the rear face of the body plate 55a. The mounting piece 51 and the connecting piece 55b are clamped and fixed together with bolts at two front and rear positions.<br>
In the body plate 55a of the mounting stay 55, a clamping tapped hole 55c is formed in an upper central position, and clamping tapped holes 55d, 55d are formed in lower right and left positions.<br>
The front top cover 40 is superimposed on the front face of the body plate 55a of the mounting stay 55, and the front basket 48 is attached to the front top cover through collars 56.<br>
The front top cover 40 is a plate member which is symmetric right and left.  As shown in Fig. 6 and 7, the front top cover 40 is somewhat curved so as to cover the front of the head pipe 3 and its right and left side edges 40d, 40d are somewhat tapered downward. Centrally of the front top cover 40 is formed one mounting hole 40a, and mounting holes 40b, 40b are formed at lower right and left positions in a somewhat concave portion. The three mounting holes 40a, 4 Ob, 40b correspond to the three<br><br>
clamping tapped holes 55c, 55d, 55d, respectively, of the mounting stay 55.<br>
To a rear wall 48a of the front basket 48 are fixed three mounting metal pieces 49 correspondingly to the three clamping tapped holes 55c, 55d, 55d formed in the mounting stay 55.<br>
For mounting the front basket 48, first the front top cover 40 is put on the front face of the body plate 55a of the mounting stay 55 while aligning the tapped holes 55c, 55d, 55d with the mounting holes 40a, 40b, 40b, then the front basket 48 is put on the recessed portions of the mounting holes 40a, 4 Ob, 4 Ob through the cylindrical collars 56 so that the mounting metal pieces 49 on the rear wall 48a come into abutment with the collars 56.  Further, three screws 57 are inserted through the mounting metal pieces 49, collars 56, and mounting holes 40a, 40b, 40b, from the inside of the front basket 48 and are brought into threaded engagement with the tapped holes 55c, 55d, 55d of the mounting stay 55 to clamp the front basket (see Fig. 5).<br>
The front top cover 40 is fixed to the body frame 2 in the manner described above.<br><br>
Mounting pieces 40c	are projected right and left from<br>
the upper portion of the	rear side of the front top cover<br>
40. The mounting pieces	40c are each centrally formed with<br>
a mounting hole.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 8, the main pipe top cover 41 which covers the main pipe 4 from above and from the rear side of the head pipe 3 is long along the main pipe 4 and generally comprises an upper wall 4 la which covers the main pipe 4 from above and side walls 41b, 41b formed right and left as somewhat dependent walls.<br>
The front end of the main pipe top cover 41 is of a shape rising upward to cover the back of the head pipe 3, with a mounting hole 41c being formed centrally in the front end portion of the upper wall 4 la.  Also centrally of the upper wall 4 la at a position near the rear end there is formed a mounting hole 4 Id. Further, mounting pieces 41e, 41e are projected downward from the front portion of the right and left side walls 41b, 41b.<br>
In the rising portion of the front end of the right-hand g'ide wall 41b is formed a circular hole 4 If for the mounting of a combination switch.<br><br>
The main pipe top cover 41 is put on the main pipe 4, then the front mounting hole 41c is brought into abutment with the cover bracket 50 projecting from the head pipe 3 of the body frame 2 and is fixed with a bolt. Further, the rear mounting hole 4 Id of the main pipe top cover 41 is brought into abutment with the cover bracket Ida projecting from the first cross plate 10 and is fixed with a bolt.<br>
The mounting pieces 41e, 41e projecting from the front portion of the right and left side walls 41b, 41b of the main pipe top cover 41 are abutted from the outside with the cover brackets 52, 52 projecting from the gusset 9 of the body frame 2, and are clamped with bolts 60 together with the main pipe side cover 42 (see Fig. 12). At these three positions the main pipe top cover 41 is fixed to the body frame 2.<br>
The right and left covers 42 have shapes symmetric with each other. The left-hand main pipe side cover 42 will now be described with reference to Figs. 9 and 10. An obliquely inclined front edge 42a corresponds to a side edge 40d of the front top cover 40, and a mounting recess 42b is formed in the upper portion of the front edge 42a by notching from the outside. The mounting recess 42b<br><br>
corresponds to the left mounting piece 40c of the front top cover 40.<br>
An upper edge 42c extends downward from the upper end of the front edge 42a, then bends and extends backward and obliquely downward. The upper edge 42c corresponds to the side edge of the left side wall 41b of the main pipe top cover 41. A mounting hole 42d is formed in the vicinity of the upper portion of the upper edge 42c and it corresponds to the left cover bracket 52 projecting from the body frame 2.<br>
A rear edge 42e extends downward from the rear end of the upper edge 42c and is connected to the left side cover 44. A mounting piece 42f is projected from the lower portion of the rear edge 42e and it corresponds to the left cover bracket 53.<br>
On the other hand, a lower edge 42g extends slightly horizontally from the lower end of the front edge 42a, then bends and extends backward and obliquely downward. Three screwing boss portions 42h formed successively from above along the lower edge 42g and projectingly on the inner surface. At the lower end is formed a mounting hole 42i, which corresponds to a mounting stay 15c (see Fig. 14)<br><br>
which is clamped to a boss of the cylinder 15b of the<br>
internal combustion engine 15.<br>
The left-hand leg shield 43 will now be described while referring to the associated left-hand portions. As shown in Fig. 11, an obliquely inclined front edge 43a of the upper portion corresponds to the side edge 40d of the front top cover 40 and the front edge 42a of the main pipe side cover 42. An inner wall 43c and an outer wall 43d of a shield body 43b which extends obliquely downward from above are connected together at the front edge. The outer wall 43d has a shape which overhangs sideways while curving (see Figs. 16 and 17). An upper edge 43e of the inner wall 43c corresponds to the lower edge 42g of the main pipe side cover 42. Mounting slots 43f are formed in three positions along the upper edge 43e. The mounting slots 43f correspond to the three screwing boss portions 42h of the main pipe side cover 42.<br><br>
A mounting piece 43g is projected from the lower end of the upper edge 43e, and a mounting hole 43h formed in the mounting piece 43g corresponds to the mounting hole 42i of the main pipe side cover 42 and the mounting stay 15c (see Fig. 14).<br><br>
The main pipe side cover 42 is mounted as follows. The upper front edge 42a is disposed along the side edge 40d of the front top cover 40, the upper edge 42c is fitted in the lower edge of the side wall 41b of the main pipe top cover 41, the mounting hole 42d is put on and aligned with the mounting piece 41e of the main pipe top cover 41 which has been placed on the cover bracket 52, followed by co-clamping with bolt 60, as shown in Fig. 12, the mounting piece 42f projected from the rear edge 42e is placed on the cover bracket 53 as shown in Fig. 13, further, the front edge of the side cover 44 is connected with the rear edge 42e and a mounting hole 44 a formed along the said front edge is aligned with the mounting piece 42f , followed by co-clamping with bolt 61.<br>
The mounting recess 42b formed in the upper portion pf the front edge 42a of the main pipe side cover 42 is aligned with the mounting piece 40c of the front top cover 40, which are then fixed together with a bolt.<br>
Thus, the main pipe side cover 42 is clamped to the cover brackets 52 and 53 of the body frame 2 at two positions together with the main pipe top cover 41 and the side cover 44, and is fixed to the front top cover 40 at<br><br>
one upper position<br>
The upper front edge 42a of the main pipe side cover 42 conforms to the side edge 40d of the front top cover 40 and is located inside the side edge 40d at a superimposed position when seen from a side (see Fig. 15).<br>
The leg shield 43 is mounted to the front top cover 40 and the main pipe side cover 42 both mounted as above to the body frame.  In this mounting operation, the front edge 43a is fitted between the side edge 40d of the front top cover 40 and the front edge 42a of the main pipe side cover 42, and the upper edge 43e of the inner wall 43c is disposed along the lower edge 42g of the main pipe side cover 42.<br>
More specifically, as shown in Fig. 15, the front edge 43a of the leg shield 43 is bent crankwise in section and is fitted between the side edge 40d of the front top cover 40 and the front edge 42a of the main pipe side cover 42. The side edge 40d of the front top cover 40 is fitted in a slot formed in the front portion of the front edge 43a of the leg shield 43.<br>
As shown in Fig. 16 and 17, the mounting slots 43f<br><br>
formed at three positions along the upper edge 43e of the inner wall 43c of the leg shield 43 are aligned with the screwing boss portions 42h which are formed at three positions along the lower edge 42g of the main pipe side cover 42, followed by clamping with tapping screws 62. Further, as shown in Fig. 14, the mounting piece 43g formed at the lower portion of the leg shield 43 is inserted between the mounting stay 15c clamped to the boss of the cylinder 15b and the mounting hole 42i formed in the main pipe side cover 42, followed by co-clamping with bolt 63 from the outside.<br><br>
Since the leg shield 43 is thus mounted, by removing<br>
the three tapping screws 62 and the lower bolt 63, the leg shield 43 alone can be removed easily.<br>
When the rider gets on the vehicle with the leg shields 43 removed, the mounting hole 42i formed in the lower end of the main pipe side cover 42 is kept clamped to the mounting stay 15c with bolt 63. <br>
Fig. 18 is a side view of a principal portion with the leg shields 43 removed. As is seen from Fig. 18, the main pipe side cover 42 substantially covers sideways the whole of intake devices such as carburetor 26 and air cleaner 27<br><br>
which are arranged in the space above the cylinder 15b of the internal combustion engine 15 and below the main pipe 4, whereby the deposition of dust and the like on those devices can be minimized and the appearance is not impaired, thus permitting the commercial value to be maintained .<br>
Since no clearance is formed in side view between the front top cover 40 and the main pipe side cover 42, it is possible to keep good appearance.<br>
As mentioned above, the mounting and removal of the leg shield 43 can be done easily, and even when the rider gets on the vehicle with the leg shields 43 removed, good appearance is maintained without giving rise to any sense of incongruity.<br>
Further, even with the leg shields 43 removed, the main pipe side covers 42 still covers sideways a part of both intake devices and the cylinder 15b of the internal combustion engine 15b, so that the cooling air introducing function is maintained.<br>
Additionally, a combination switch 70 (indicated with broken line in Fig. 18), which is fitted in the circular hole 41f formed in the rising front-end portion of the<br><br>
right-hand side wall 41b of the main pipe top cover 41, is also covered and not exposed with both front top cover 40 and main pipe side cover 42 which are still mounted to the body frame even after removal of the leg shields 43. This is advantageous in point of crime prevention.<br>
