				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to non-evaporable getter multilayer deposits<br>
obtained by cathodic deposition and to a process for their manufacturing.<br>
The main non-evaporable getter materials, also known in the art as NEG<br>
materials, are some transition metals such as Zr, Ti, Nb, Ta, V, or alloys or<br>
compounds thereof and/or with one or more elements selected among Cr, Mn, Fe,<br>
Co, Ni, Al ,Y, La and Rare Earths, such as for example binary alloys Ti-V, Zr-Al,<br>
Zr-V, Zr-Fe and Zr-Ni, ternary alloys Zr-V-Fe and Zr-Co-Rare Earths, or multi-<br>
components alloys.<br>
NEG materials are capable of reversibly sorbing hydrogen and irreversibly<br>
sorbing gases such as oxygen, water, carbon oxides and, in some cases, nitrogen.<br>
Therefore, these materials are used for keeping vacuum in applications requiring<br>
it, such as for example evacuated interspaces for thermal insulation; getter<br>
materials can also be employed to remove the above-mentioned species from inert<br>
gases, mainly rare gases, for example in gas-filled lamps or for manufacturing of<br>
ultrapure gases such as those used in the microelectronic industry.<br>
The functioning of NEG materials is based on the chemical reaction among<br>
the NEG metallic atoms and the atoms of the above-mentioned gaseous species.<br>
At room temperature, in consequence of this reaction oxide, nitride or carbide<br>
species are formed on the material surface, resulting eventually in the formation of<br>
a passivating layer that prevents from further gas sorbing. The passivating layer<br>
can rapidly form in presence of considerable amounts of gas, for example at the<br>
first exposure to the atmosphere of the freshly produced NEG material, or during<br>
certain "dirty" manufacturing steps of the devices in which this is contained;<br>
furthermore this layer forms, although more slowly, as a result of the NEG<br>
functioning itself, in consequence of sorbing gaseous species, which the material<br>
removes from the atmosphere at the inside of the final device as time goes on. To<br><br>
allow the correct NEG functioning at the beginning of its operating life a thermal<br>
activation treatment (normally under vacuum) is required, whose object is the<br>
migration of the passivating layer species towards the inside of the material<br>
structure, thereby exposing a metallic surface "fresh" and active for gas sorption.<br>
The activation may be complete, thus obtaining a material surface essentially<br>
entirely made up of metals, or partial, thus obtaining a "mixed" surface, made up<br>
of areas of oxide-type species (or the like) and metallic areas; an activation degree<br>
(generally expressed in percentage) can thus be defined, that will correspond to<br>
the fraction of "free" surface sites, i.e. metals at the elementary state and<br>
consequently available for reaction with gases. The activation advancement can be<br>
controlled through the process temperature and time; for example an activation<br>
degree of 70% of a given material can be reached by treatment for half an hour at<br>
350 °C or for 10 hours at 250 °C: according to a rule generally valid in chemical<br>
reactions, the effect of temperature on the reaction advancement degree is much<br>
greater than that of time. Generally, to completely activate a NEG would be<br>
always preferable, but it may be impossible in the manufacturing of certain<br>
devices owing to manufacturing times, or because the device wouldn't tolerate too<br>
high temperatures necessary to the purpose: in these cases, the producers of<br>
devices containing NEG materials are satisfied with a partial activation, even<br>
though they have to accept lower gas sorbing properties (for example, shorter<br>
NEG operating life). The conditions of the activation treatment are different<br>
according to the material, depending on the physical-chemical characteristics<br>
thereof. For some materials a complete activation treatment requires even very<br>
high temperatures; for example, the alloy of weight percent composition Zr 84% -<br>
Al 16%, requires thermal treatments at 700 °C at least and preferably at about 900<br>
°C (unless extremely long times are adopted, unacceptable in an industrial<br>
production); other alloys, such as some ternary alloys Zr-V-Fe, have much lower<br>
activation temperatures and can be activated at 100% at about 350 °C in about one<br>
hour. In some cases, the activation treatment can be periodically repeated<br>
(processes called of reactivation) during the device operating life, to restore the<br>
initial NEG gas sorbing properties. In the following and in the claims, by the<br><br>
definition of "low activation temperature" material, it will be meant a material<br>
(metal, intermetallic compound or alloy) which can be activated for at least 90%<br>
by a treatment of one hour at a maximum temperature of 300 °C.<br>
NEG materials can be employed in the form of discrete devices, for example<br>
sintered pills or powders of the material within suitable containers. In some<br>
applications, for reasons of available space or for simplicity of construction, it is<br>
required the use of NEG materials in the form of thin layers, having thickness<br>
generally of tens or hundreds of micron (µm), placed on an inner surface of the<br>
final apparatus: the NEG material can be deposited on a thin support, generally<br>
metallic, subsequently brought into contact with the surface, but preferably the<br>
deposit is directly formed thereon. Examples of uses of thin layers of NEG<br>
material are disclosed in US patent 5,453,659, that describes Field Emission<br>
Displays (known in the art as FEDs) wherein discrete and thin deposits of NEG<br>
material are formed among the electrons emitting cathodes on the anodic plate of<br>
the display; in US patent 6,468,043, that describes the coating with a NEG layer<br>
of the inner surface of the pipes defining the chamber of a particles accelerator;<br>
and in US patents 5,701,008 and 6,499,354, that describe, respectively, the use of<br>
getter materials in micromechanical devices and in miniaturized IR radiation<br>
detectors (micromechanical or microoptoelectronic devices are known in the art as<br>
"micromachines" or MEMs). In all these applications, the NEG deposit (after<br>
activation) works at room temperature.<br>
The more convenient technique for the NEG deposit formation is the<br>
cathodic deposition, better known in the art as sputtering. On this technique, well<br>
known and broadly used for the production of thin layers, is based the whole<br>
microelectronic industry; since also FEDs and MEMs are manufactured by using<br>
this technique (among others), for reasons of production integration the same<br>
technique results to be preferred also for manufacturing NEG material layers in<br>
these devices.<br>
As it is well known, in the sputtering technique a vacuum chamber is used<br>
wherein it is possible to generate an electrical field. Inside the chamber there are<br>
placed a target (generally in the form of a short cylinder) of the material to be<br><br>
deposited and in front of this, the support on which the thin layer has to be<br>
formed. The chamber is firstly evacuated and then backfilled with a noble gas<br>
atmosphere, generally argon, at a pressure generally from about 0.1 to 1 Pa. By<br>
 applying a potential difference of a few thousands volts between the stands of the<br>
support and of the target (so that the latter is at cathodic potential), a plasma of<br>
Ar+ ions is created; these ions are accelerated by the electrical field towards the<br>
target and cause its erosion through impact; the species (generally atoms or atoms<br>
clusters) derived from target erosion deposit on the support thus forming the thin<br>
layer. In a variation of the method commonly used, a magnetic field is applied to<br>
the plasma region, helping to confine the plasma itself and improving the<br>
characteristics of cathode erosion and deposit formation; this variation is defined<br>
in the art as "magnetron sputtering". The deposit can entirely cover the support<br>
surface, obtaining a single continuous deposit; otherwise, through suitable<br>
maskings, deposits on only certain support regions can be obtained.<br>
For various reasons, however, the NEG deposits up to now obtained by<br>
sputtering are not fully satisfactory for the use in applications in which the deposit<br>
has to work at room temperature.<br>
NEG deposits made up of a single metal (and particularly those of titanium,<br>
which are the most commonly used) can be easily manufactured by sputtering<br>
with open or porous morphology, that increases the effective surface area and<br>
consequently the initial gas sorption rate. For an effective activation (or<br>
reactivation) pure metals however require comparatively high temperatures,<br>
generally higher than 450 °C. In small sized or miniaturized devices such as FEDs<br>
or MEMs, wherein the NEG material is quite close to functional or structural parts<br>
of the device, the activation treatment can damage these parts. For example, in the<br>
case of FEDs in which the NEG is generally placed at the peripheric region, the<br>
heating at about 400 °C can compromise the tightness of sealing between the two<br>
glass parts forming the display, made up of a low-melting glass paste; similarly,<br>
treatments at the indicated temperatures can compromise the sealings between the<br>
two silicon parts forming the MEMs, when these are made up e.g. of brazing<br>
alloys such as silver-based alloys, or gold-tin or gold-indium alloys.<br><br>
Certain NEG intermetallic compounds or alloys have the advantage of<br>
having low activation temperatures according to the above given definition, for<br>
example of about 300 °C or lower. However the present inventors have<br>
experimentally determined that these materials having low activation temperature,<br>
when deposited by sputtering, give rise to thin layers having extremely compact<br>
morphology and consequently a very reduced effective surface area, generally<br>
equivalent to few times the deposit geometrical area. This characteristic limits<br>
considerably the deposit sorbing properties at room temperature, particularly its<br>
initial sorption rate and its capacity, and for example makes necessary frequent<br>
reactivations which can be hardly carried out into practice in some applications.<br>
Therefore the known NEG deposits obtained by sputtering have poor<br>
sorbing characteristics at room temperature (particularly low sorption rate), or<br>
activation temperatures incompatible with some applications, particularly the<br>
miniaturized ones.<br>
Object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of the prior<br>
art, and particularly to provide NEG material deposits obtained by cathodic<br>
deposition, being characterized by low activation temperature and large surface<br>
area.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention, that in a first<br>
aspect thereof relates to a multilayer deposit of non-evaporable getter materials,<br>
characterized in comprising at least one first layer of non-evaporable getter<br>
material having surface area equivalent to at least 20 times its geometrical area<br>
and, upon said first layer, at least a second layer having thickness not greater than<br>
1 µm of a non-evaporable getter alloy with low activation temperature, both said<br>
layers being obtained by cathodic deposition and without any exposure of the first<br>
layer material to reactive gases occurring between the deposition of the two<br>
layers.<br>
By the term "getter alloy" (or NEG alloy), as above used, in the following<br>
and in the claims, are also meant compositions corresponding to intermetallic<br>
compounds, such as for example the ZrV2 composition; the reason is that<br>
depositing by sputtering thin material layers of composition corresponding to an<br><br>
intermetallic, a regular structure typical of these compounds is hardly obtained, on<br>
the contrary obtaining an almost amorphous or however irregular structure typical<br>
of the alloys.<br>
The multilayer deposits of the invention are such that the layer formed by<br>
the low activation temperature NEG alloy directly faces in the final application<br>
the space to be kept evacuated or wherein the gas to be purified is present.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that a multilayer deposit obtained by<br>
sputtering such as the one described, has a very large effective surface area<br>
combined with the typical properties (particularly the activation temperature) of<br>
certain NEG alloys. In other words, the multilayer deposits of the invention do not<br>
act as the mere addition of the two (or more) component layers, but as one single<br>
monocomponent layer, the properties of which are the addition of the best<br>
properties of the different present layers.<br>
The invention will be in the following described with reference to the<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows in a schematic way in cross-section a NEG multilayer of<br>
the invention;<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show in a schematic way in cross-section possible<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention;<br>
Figure 4 show graphs representative of gas sorbing properties of<br>
multilayer deposits of the invention and of deposits formed by a single<br>
NEG material of the known art;<br>
Figure 5 shows two graphs representative of gas sorbing properties of<br>
two deposits of the invention.<br>
Getter systems made up of a first material on which a second one is<br>
deposited by sputtering are already known from the international publication WO<br>
02/27058 Al. In the systems of this application however the underlying material<br>
is not obtained in its turn by sputtering, but it is made up of a macroscopic body of<br>
sintered getter powders, and the purpose of the deposit formation by sputtering on<br>
the macroscopic body is to reduce the loss of particles from this one. In this case,<br>
the presence of the deposit obtained by sputtering does not alter the sorbing or<br><br>
activation characteristics of the system, because the ratio between the volumes<br>
and the masses of the two components is such that the presence of the sputtered<br>
deposit is negligible to this effect; furthermore, the underlying material is exposed<br>
to the atmosphere before the deposit formation by sputtering. On the contrary, in<br>
the systems of the invention all the active components (i.e. except for the support)<br>
are obtained by sputtering in immediately subsequent process steps; this<br>
productive characteristic and the ratio between the quantities of the two materials<br>
is such that the presence of the low activation NEG alloy substantially changes the<br>
properties of the overall system, particularly the activation ones.<br>
Figure 1 is the reproduction of a microphotograph of a multilayer of the<br>
invention seen in cross-section as obtained by scanning electron microscope.<br>
The first layer, 11, of the deposit of the invention is formed on a support, 10.<br>
This one can be an additional support being then applied to the inner surface of<br>
the device to be kept evacuated or wherein the gas to be purified is present.<br>
Preferably however, the support 10 is the inner device surface itself (or a part of<br>
this one) when this is allowed by the geometry of the device wherein the NEG<br>
must be inserted: it is the case of medium or small sized devices which can be put<br>
into a sputtering chamber, such as FEDs or MEMs. The first layer 11 is made up<br>
of NEG material that can be deposited by sputtering in the form of layer having<br>
large surface area. For this purpose it is possible to use one of the alloys described<br>
in US patent 5,961,750, comprising zirconium, cobalt and one or more elements<br>
selected among yttrium, lanthanum and Rare Earths, and particularly the alloy<br>
having percent composition by weight Zr 80% - Co 15% - A 5% (where A stands<br>
for one or more among Y, La and Rare Earths). It is however preferred using a<br>
metal selected among niobium, tantalum, vanadium, hafnium, zirconium and<br>
titanium, particularly the last two ones. The thickness of layer 11 can range within<br>
large limits, not bound by stringent restrictions. The lower thickness limit is<br>
essentially determined by the possibility to obtain a layer having the desired<br>
morphology: thicknesses lower than 0.2 µm are not advisable because layers<br>
having such thicknesses tend to "repeat" the support morphology (which could be<br>
not rough) and consequently do not assure to obtain a layer having sufficient<br><br>
surface area; furthermore, since this layer forms the main gas sorbing "reservoir"<br>
of the multilayer, its minimum thickness is also determined by the gas quantity<br>
that is expected it will be needed to sorb. The maximum thickness is instead<br>
determined mainly by productive factors, and particularly by the time necessary<br>
for the layer growth; the layers formation rate by sputtering is generally not very<br>
high, and consequently it is generally preferred to keep the thickness at values<br>
lower than about 50 µm, for example between about 1 and 10 µm if these<br>
thicknesses are compatible with the required sorption capacity.<br>
As aforesaid, the layer 11 must have a large surface area, determined by its<br>
porosity. It is possible to give an indication on the porosity of these layers<br>
obtained by cathodic deposition as ratio between the effective surface area and the<br>
geometrical area: this ratio, indicated in the following as Re, is 1 in the theoretical<br>
case of a perfectly smooth deposit, and increases with the increasing of the<br>
roughness or irregularity of the metallic deposit surface. For the purposes of the<br>
invention Re must be greater than 20 and preferably greater than 50.<br>
Over layer 11 there is formed by sputtering at least a second layer, 12, made<br>
up of a low activation temperature getter alloy. Getter alloys suitable for the<br>
invention are for example the Zr-V-Fe alloys of US patent 4,312,669, particularly<br>
the alloy having percent composition by weight Zr 70% - V 24.6% - Fe 5.4%;<br>
alloys comprising mainly zirconium and vanadium and smaller amounts of one or<br>
more elements selected among iron, nickel, manganese, and aluminum, described<br>
in US patent 4,996,002; Zr-Co-A alloys (where A is an element selected among<br>
yttrium, lanthanum and Rare Earths and mixtures thereof) described in US patent<br>
5,961,750, particularly the alloy having percent composition by weight Zr 70% -<br>
Co 15% - A 5%, when the material of layer 11 is not made up also of a Zr-Co-A-<br>
type alloy; Zr-Ti-V alloys, particularly the alloy having percent composition by<br>
weight Zr 44% - Ti 23% - V 33%, which can be activated (at least partially) by<br>
treatments even of a few hours at 200 °C; and the compound ZrV2.<br>
This second layer thickness is not greater than 1 µm, and preferably ranging<br>
from 50 to 500 nanometer (nm); with these thicknesses the layer keeps the<br>
morphological characteristics of the underlying layer 11, and consequently high<br><br>
Re values and high sorption rate, whereas with higher thicknesses the layer<br>
becomes more compact and unsuitable for the application at room temperature.<br>
Optionally, on the upper surface of layer 12 it is possible to deposit a further<br>
layer, continuous or discontinuous, of palladium or of one compound thereof,<br>
which can be palladium oxide, silver-palladium alloys comprising up to atomic<br>
30% of silver and compounds among palladium and one or more metals forming<br>
the getter material.<br>
Figure 2 shows the first of these possibilities (continuous layer): in this case,<br>
the palladium layer, 13, allows the hydrogen selective sorption; it is known indeed<br>
that palladium has high hydrogen permeability, and consequently allows the<br>
transfer of this gas towards the underlying getter material layer. To maximize the<br>
hydrogen transfer rate to the getter, the palladium deposit must have low<br>
thickness, for example ranging from about 10 to 100 nm. Getter deposits made<br>
hydrogen selective by coating with a continuous palladium deposit are known for<br>
example from international publication WO 98/37958 Al, but in the case of the<br>
invention a higher sorbing rate is obtained, due to the larger surface area.<br>
Figure 3 shows the case of a discontinuous deposit of palladium (or a<br>
compound thereof). In this case palladium (or palladium compound) is present in<br>
the form of "islands" 14, 14', 14", ..., on the getter layer 12 surface; these islands<br>
cover preferably from 10 to 90% of the layer 12 surface. Such a configuration is<br>
described in international publication WO 00/75950 Al, with reference to getter<br>
materials in the form of powders. With this structure a material is obtained being<br>
able to act both as a constant hydrogen sorber an as sorber of other gases in<br>
consequence of a suitable activation. As more diffusely disclosed in the<br>
mentioned international publication, these operation characteristics are due to the<br>
fact that the islands 14, 14', 14", ..., not sorbing other gases, do not get passivated<br>
and consequently form passages for continuous hydrogen entering into the getter<br>
alloy, whereas the zones 15, 15', ..., of the layer 12 surface not covered by said<br>
islands keep their usual operation as getters.<br>
In a second aspect thereof, the invention relates to the process for<br>
manufacturing the deposits hitherto described.<br><br>
The process of the invention comprises at least the steps of:<br>
depositing by cathodic deposition on a support a first layer of a non-<br>
evaporable getter material having a surface area equivalent to at least 20<br>
times its geometrical area; and<br>
- depositing by cathodic deposition over said first layer at least a second<br>
layer, having thickness not greater than 1 µm, of a non-evaporable getter<br>
alloy having low activation temperature;<br>
operating in such way that, between the two mentioned deposition steps, the<br>
material of first layer is not exposed to gas species able to react therewith.<br>
The process consists of two subsequent steps of deposition by sputtering of<br>
two different materials. The deposition by sputtering occurs according to the<br>
procedure known in the art and described in general outline in the introduction,<br>
and necessarily requires that the formed first layer is not exposed to species that<br>
can react therewith; particularly, the exposure to oxidant species, such as oxygen<br>
or water, must be avoided. It is believed that the characteristic of the invention,<br>
according to which the low activation temperature alloy "transfers" its activation<br>
temperature to the underlying material, depends on the fact that the latter,<br>
operating as described, is never subjected to passivation.<br>
As aforesaid, the support on which the first layer 11 having large surface<br>
area is deposited can be an additional part, such as for example a support<br>
(generally flat) of metal, glass or silicon, which is then placed into the final<br>
system at a suitable position. Preferably however, when size and shape of the<br>
device intended for the getter deposit allow that, the deposition directly occurs on<br>
an inner surface of the device itself, without requiring an additional support; this<br>
preferred manufacturing procedure can be employed for example in the<br>
production of MEMs and FEDs.<br>
A layer 11 made up of the previously mentioned materials and having high<br>
roughness or irregularity (and consequently the required values of Re) can be<br>
obtained by sputtering resorting to some expedients known in the art. First, it is<br>
possible to cool the support on which the deposition takes place; in this way the<br>
atoms reaching the support have not available enough energy to rearrange and<br><br>
form more regular structures, thus achieving a kind of "quenching" of the deposit<br>
under formation. For the purpose of keeping low the support temperature, it is<br>
also preferable to operate at reduced currents, since with high currents a high<br>
number of impacts per time unit would occur between Ar+ ions and the target,<br>
with a consequent widespread heating of the system. Finally, another possibility is<br>
to operate with the target not directly placed in front of the support, or moving,<br>
rotating or vibrating the support during the deposition; all these operating modes<br>
increase the geometrical disorder of the deposit and consequently promote the<br>
formation of not very compact layers. Of course it is possible to use at the same<br>
time more procedures of the types here above mentioned to increase the Re value<br>
of layer 11.<br>
To form layer 12 the sputtering technique can be used according to its usual<br>
procedures, without resorting to the above-mentioned particular expedients to<br>
increase the morphological irregularity of the layer 11, which have turned out<br>
ineffective in the case of low activation temperature alloys.<br>
The possible deposit of palladium (or its alloys or compounds) must not be<br>
necessarily obtained by sputtering, and could be obtained for example by<br>
evaporation, using the Chemical Vapor Deposition technique; in the case of<br>
metallic palladium or its alloys it is however preferable for convenience that also<br>
this deposit is obtained by sputtering.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated through the following examples.<br>
These non-limiting examples show some embodiments intended to teach to those<br>
skilled in the art how to practise the invention and to represent the considered best<br>
way to carry out the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example regards the preparation of a double-layered deposit according<br>
to the invention.<br>
As support for the deposition a polished monocrystalline silicon disc is used<br>
having a diameter of 2.5 cm, which is cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with an<br>
organic solvent (an alcoholic solution of n-propylbromide) and subsequent rinsing<br>
in deionized water. The support is placed into a cathodic deposition chamber that<br><br>
can contain up to three targets of different materials, which is evacuated until a<br>
pressure of 3x10-6 Pa is reached and that is subsequently backfilled with argon at<br>
a pressure of 2 Pa. A titanium layer is first deposited, with the following operating<br>
parameters:<br>
- power density on the target: 3.5 W/cm2;<br>
target-support distance: 140 mm;<br>
support temperature: 100 °C;<br>
deposition time: 80 minutes.<br>
Subsequently a second target of a ZrV2 alloy is used, a layer of which is<br>
deposited on the titanium one employing the same operating parameters of the<br>
previous step, except for the power density on the target which is decreased to 3<br>
W/cm2 and the deposition time which is limited to 10 minutes.<br>
Finally the support with the double deposit is withdrawn from the deposition<br>
chamber and analyzed at the electronic microscope to determine the average<br>
thickness of the two layers, resulting to be 3.3 µm for the titanium layer and 0.2<br>
µm for the alloy. These thickness values (as all the thicknesses reported in the<br>
following examples) are average values, owing to the defective deposits planarity.<br>
This support with the double deposit is sample 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, depositing however only one layer<br>
of ZrV2 alloy. The same operating parameters adopted for the alloy deposition in<br>
Example 1 are used, with the exceptions that the chamber is initially evacuated<br>
until a residual pressure of 7x10-6 Pa is reached, and that the deposition is<br>
continued for 60 minutes.<br>
The support with the alloy deposit, being sample 2, is extracted from the<br>
chamber and analyzed at the electronic microscope to determine the average<br>
thickness of the deposit, resulting to be 3.5 µm.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, depositing however only one layer<br>
of titanium. The same operating parameters adopted for titanium deposition in<br>
Example 1 are used, with the exception that the deposition is continued for 90<br><br>
minutes.<br>
The support with the titanium deposit, being sample 3, is extracted from the<br>
chamber and analyzed at the electronic microscope to determine the average<br>
thickness of the deposit, resulting to be 3.5 µm.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The procedure of the Example 1 is repeated, with the only difference that<br>
the titanium deposition lasts 40 minutes; the sample so obtained (sample 4) has an<br>
overall average thickness of 1.8 µm, made up of titanium layer having thickness<br>
of 1.6 µm and one of ZrV2 alloy having thickness of 0.2 µm.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
In this example, the gas sorbing properties at room temperature of samples<br>
1, 2 and 3 are evaluated.<br>
The samples are mounted one at a time into a quartz bulb, which before<br>
every test is evacuated through a turbomolecular pump until a residual pressure of<br>
1x10-6 Pa is reached; to promote the degassing of the system walls and therefore<br>
to accelerate the achievement of the required pressure, during this step the system<br>
is heated at 180 °C for about 12 hours.<br>
Upon reaching the required residual pressure, the sample object of the test is<br>
activated by radiofrequency heating at 300 °C for 30 minutes, through an<br>
induction coil placed outside the bulb; the temperature is monitored with an<br>
optical pyrometer. The sample is then let cool down to room temperature, and the<br>
gas sorption test is carried out according to the procedures described in the<br>
standard ASTM F798-82, introducing into the bulb carbon monoxide, CO, at a<br>
pressure of 4x10-4 Pa and recording the pressure decrease downstream a known<br>
conductance. The result of the three sorption tests is shown in Figure 4, wherein<br>
the number of each curve corresponds to the number of sample as above<br>
indicated. The curves show the sample sorbing rate, S, measured in liters of gas<br>
sorbed every second per square centimeter of deposit (1/cm2), as a function of<br>
sorbed gas quantity, Q, measured in liters of gas sorbed, multiplied by the sorption<br>
pressure (in hectoPascal, hPa), divided by the deposit surface (hPax1/cm2). The<br>
maximum value of Q of the three curves measures the total samples capacity.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
In this example, the gas sorption properties at high temperatures of samples<br>
1 and 4 are evaluated.<br>
On a second sample prepared exactly as described in Example 1, and on<br>
sample 4, CO sorption tests are carried out with procedures similar to those<br>
described in Example 5; in these tests the samples are activated by heating at 430<br>
°C, and the two tests are carried out at 300 °C. The two tests results are<br>
graphically shown in Figure 5 (wherein the symbols have the same meaning as in<br>
Figure 4), as curve 4 for sample 4 and curve 5 for the sample prepared according<br>
to Example 1.<br>
Under test conditions of Examples 5 and 6, various characteristics of the<br>
deposits of getter materials are measured. In the room temperature tests (Example<br>
5), the species formed on the getter surface as a result of gas sorbing do not have<br>
energy enough to diffuse inwards of material: the exhaustion of sorption capacity<br>
therefore shows that all the metallic sites initially available on the surface are<br>
saturated, so that the results of these tests are a measure of the starting number of<br>
these surface sites. On the contrary, in the high temperature tests (Example 6) the<br>
species initially formed on the surface as a result of gas sorbing can diffuse<br>
inwards of the deposit; therefore these tests involve the whole amount of available<br>
getter material, and measure the whole capacity of the deposits.<br>
Considering these characteristics, from the three curves graphically shown<br>
in Figure 5 it may be inferred that the sample of the invention shows surface<br>
sorption characteristics better than those of deposits of metal only or NEG alloy<br>
only in the whole measure range. In particular, the sample of the invention (curve<br>
1) shows in the whole measure range sorption rate and capacity greater by more<br>
than one order of magnitude than those of a deposit of NEG alloy only (curve 2),<br>
and rate and capacity at least double compared to a deposit of titanium only (curve<br>
3). The comparison between curves relating to samples 1 and 2, wherein the<br>
exposed surface is made up of the same material, shows that the sample of the<br>
invention is characterized by a large specific surface, considerably greater than<br>
that obtainable depositing only a getter alloy. The difference of results between<br><br>
curves relating to samples 1 and 3, instead, can be attributed to an activation<br>
degree lower for the titanium with respect to getter alloy, when the activation<br>
occurs for both materials at the same temperature: a lower activation degree<br>
corresponds to a lower surface "cleanness", resulting in a reduced number of sites<br>
available for gas sorbing.<br>
The comparison between curves 4 and 5 allows instead to show that in the<br>
double-layered deposits of the invention there is an effective transfer of sorbed<br>
species from the upper layer of low activation temperature NEG alloy to the lower<br>
layer. The two tested samples, indeed, have been manufactured under exactly the<br>
same conditions, with the only difference that the sample of curve 5 comprises<br>
twice as much titanium as sample 4. As it can be noted, the two curves have the<br>
same initial sorption rate, thus confirming that at the beginning of test the two<br>
samples are essentially equivalent in specific area and activation degree (as it<br>
could be expected); sample 4 however shows a total capacity being about half the<br>
capacity of the sample of Example 1; this behavior can be explained only as<br>
indication of the fact that the titanium deposit underlying the alloy deposit takes<br>
part in sorbing at the test temperature.<br>
From the analysis of above reported tests results it can be thereby concluded<br>
that the multilayer deposits of the invention act as if they were a deposit of a<br>
single material, each characteristic of which is better than the corresponding<br>
characteristic of both the component layers, i.e., the activation temperature of the<br>
present material having the lower activation temperature (material of layer 12) and<br>
a large surface area (characteristic of layer 11), conferring to the deposit high<br>
sorbing performances at room temperature (not obtainable with deposits of getter<br>
alloys only). While the replication of the morphology of layer 11 by layer 12<br>
could be expected, it was absolutely not predictable that in the multilayers of the<br>
invention the material of lower activation temperature could impart this<br>
characteristic to the whole multilayer.<br><br>
