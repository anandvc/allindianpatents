INTEGRATED CURRENT COLLECTOR AND ELECTRICAL COMPONENT<br>
PLATE FOR A FUEL CELL STACK<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to electrochemical fuel cell stacks, and,<br>
more particularly, to an integrated current collector and electrical component plate for<br>
an electrochemical fuel cell stack.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Electrochemical fuel cells convert reactants, namely fuel and oxidant, to<br>
generate electric power and reaction products. Electrochemical fuel cells generally<br>
employ an electrolyte disposed between two electrodes, namely a cathode and an anode.<br>
An electrocatalyst, disposed at the interfaces between the electrolyte and the electrodes,<br>
typically induces the desired electrochemical reactions at the electrodes. The location<br>
of the electrocatalyst generally defines the electrochemically active area of the fuel cell.<br>
Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells generally employ a<br>
membrane electrode assembly (MEA) comprising a solid polymer electrolyte or ion-<br>
exchange membrane disposed between two electrode layers comprising a porous,<br>
electrically conductive sheet material, such as carbon fiber paper or carbon cloth, as a<br>
fluid diffusion layer. In a typical MEA, the electrode layers provide structural support<br>
to the ion-exchange membrane, which is typically thin and flexible. The membrane is<br>
ion conductive (typically proton conductive), and also acts as a barrier for isolating the<br>
reactant streams from each other. Another function of the membrane is to act as an<br>
electrical insulator between the two electrode layers. A typical commercial PEM is a<br>
sulfonated perfluorocarbon membrane sold by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company<br>
under the trade designation NAFION®.<br>
As noted above, the MEA further comprises an electrocatalyst, typically<br>
comprising finely comminuted platinum particles disposed in a layer at each<br>
membrane/electrode layer interface, to induce the desired electrochemical reactions.<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
The electrodes are electrically coupled to provide a path for conducting electrons<br>
between the electrodes through an external load.<br>
In a fuel cell, the MEA is typically interposed between two separator<br>
plates that are substantially impermeable to the reactant fluid streams. The plates act as<br>
current collectors and provide support for the electrodes. To control the distribution of<br>
the reactant fluid streams to the electrochemically active area, the surfaces of the plates<br>
that face the MEA may have open-faced channels formed therein. Such channels define<br>
a flow field area that generally corresponds to the adjacent electrochemically active<br>
area. Such separator plates, which have reactant channels formed therein, are<br>
commonly known as flow field plates.<br>
In a fuel cell stack, a plurality of fuel cells are connected together,<br>
typically in series, to increase the overall output power of the assembly. In such an<br>
arrangement, one side of a given separator plate may serve as an anode plate for one<br>
cell and the other side of the plate may serve as the cathode plate for the adjacent ceil.<br>
In this arrangement, the plates may be referred to as bipolar plates. The fuel cell stack<br>
is typically held together in its assembled state by tie rods and end plates. A<br>
compression mechanism is generally required to ensure sealing around internal stack<br>
manifolds and flow fields, and also to ensure adequate electrical contact between the<br>
surfaces of the plates and membrane electrode assemblies to provide the serial electrical<br>
connection among the fuel cells which make up the stack.<br>
Typically, in fuel cell systems, current is drawn from the fuel cell stack<br>
via a pair of current collector or bus plates, typically formed of copper or coated copper,<br>
one of which is positioned at each end of the fuel cell stack between the assembled fuel<br>
cells and the end plates. In order to minimize power losses, the bus plates presently<br>
employed in fuel cell systems are typically quite thick (e.g., on the order of 2mm for an<br>
automotive sized stack, but the thickness would be expected to vary somewhat<br>
depending on fuel cell size). However, this results in both high through-plane and in-<br>
plane thermal conductivity. A consequence of such high through-plane thermal<br>
conductivity is that heat is removed from the fuel cell stack, and a consequence of such<br>
high in-plane conductivity is that the thermal gradients within the fuel cells in the<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
vicinity of the bus plates are decreased. Both of these consequences may lead to<br>
operating issues, such as flooding, in the fuel cells in the vicinity of the bus plates.<br>
Prior attempts to mitigate these operating issues have primarily involved<br>
the incorporation of an additional heating component, such as an electric heater or<br>
resistive heating element, between the bus plates and end plates of a fuel cell stack {see,<br>
e.g., Japanese Patent Publication No. 8-167424, U.S. Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 2001/0036568, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0137295).<br>
Further additional components, such as high potential bleed down resistors and thermal<br>
and electrical insulation layers, have also been incorporated into fuel cell systems to<br>
improve performance. However, the presence of these additional components has the<br>
disadvantage of increasing the complexity of the fuel cell system design, of increasing<br>
the fuel cell system space requirements and of increasing the weight of the fuel cell<br>
system. These are significant disadvantages in mobile applications such as fuel cell<br>
powered motor vehicles.<br>
Accordingly, although there have been advances in the field, there<br>
remains a need in the art for improved fuel cell systems generally, and, in particular, for<br>
simple, space-efficient and lightweight fuel cell systems. The present invention<br>
addresses these needs and provides further related advantages.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In brief, the present invention is directed to an integrated current<br>
collector and electrical component plate for a fuel cell stack.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides an integrated current<br>
collector and electrical component plate for a fuel cell stack, comprising a printed<br>
circuit board comprising the following layers: (1) a current collection layer, comprising<br>
a current collector; (2) a first insulation layer, comprising a first surface and a second<br>
surface; (3) an electrical component layer, comprising an electrical component having a<br>
first connection site and a second connection site; and (4) a second insulation layer,<br>
comprising a first surface and a second surface, wherein the current collection layer is<br>
laminated to the first surface of the first insulation layer, and the electrical component<br>
layer is laminated between the second surface of the first insulation layer and the first<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
surface  of the  second  insulation  layer.     In  certain  embodiments,   the  electrical<br>
component may be a resistor.<br>
In a further embodiment of the foregoing, the first insulation layer<br>
further comprises a first conductive via and the first connection site of the electrical<br>
component is electrically connected to the current collector by the first conductive via.<br>
In addition, in yet further embodiments, the first insulation layer may further comprise a<br>
second conductive via, the current collection layer may further comprise a current<br>
removal region electrically isolated from the current collector, and the second<br>
connection site of the electrical component may be electrically connected to the current<br>
removal region of the current collection layer by the second conductive via of the first<br>
insulation layer.<br>
In yet further embodiments, the current collection layer comprises one or<br>
more additional layers selected from copper, nickel and gold, the electrical component<br>
itself {e.g., a resistor) may comprise copper and/or the electrical component layer may<br>
comprise a plurality of electrical components.<br>
Other embodiments of the present invention include fuel cell stacks<br>
comprising the aforementioned integrated current collector and electrical component<br>
plate. One such embodiment comprises: (1) an end cell; (2) an end plate; and (3) the<br>
foregoing integrated current collector and electrical component plate, wherein the<br>
integrated current collector and electrical component plate is disposed between the end<br>
cell and the end plate, the current collector is adjacent to, and in electrical contact with,<br>
the end cell, and the second surface of the second insulation layer is adjacent to the end<br>
plate. In other embodiments, the electrical component may be electrically connected in<br>
series or in parallel to the fuel cell stack.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the present invention provides for a simple,<br>
efficient method for manufacturing a fuel cell stack comprising the aforementioned<br>
integrated current collector and electrical component plate. The method comprises<br>
fabricating the integrated current collector and electrical component plate via printed<br>
circuit board manufacturing methods, and incorporating it into the fuel cell stack. The<br>
method is useful for incorporating a cell row resistor to act as a resistive heater for<br>
heating an end cell of the fuel cell stack.   Alternatively such a resistor can serve to<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
lower voltages during open circuit or to bleed down the cell voltage during shutdown.<br>
The method is also useful for incorporating component arrays comprising a plurality of<br>
electrical components into the stack. Such arrays may be used to map physical<br>
characteristics of the fuel cell stack such as local current or temperature distributions.<br>
The electrical components may thus include shunt resistors and/or resistive<br>
thermometers.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be evident upon reference<br>
to the attached figures and following detailed description.<br>

WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a representative electrochemical fuel cell stack 10<br>
comprising two integrated current collector and electrical component plates 40 of the<br>
present invention. As shown, fuel cell stack 10 comprises a plurality of fuel cell<br>
assemblies 16 arranged between a pair of end plates 18a, 18b, one of the fuel cell<br>
assemblies 16 being partially removed from fuel cell stack 10 to better illustrate the<br>
structure of a representative fuel cell assembly 16. Tie rods (not shown) extend<br>
between end plates 18a, 18b and cooperate with fastening nuts 17 to bias end plates<br>
18a, 18b together by applying pressure to the various components to ensure good<br>
contact therebetween.<br>
Each fuel cell assembly 16 comprises a membrane electrode assembly 20<br>
having two electrodes, namely, an anode 22 and a cathode 24, separated by an ion<br>
exchange membrane 26. Electrodes 22, 24 may be formed from a porous, electrically<br>
conductive sheet material, such as carbon fiber paper or cloth, that is permeable to the<br>
reactants. Each of electrodes 22, 24 are coated on a surface thereof adjacent to the ion<br>
exchange membrane 26 with a catalyst 27, such as a thin layer of platinum, to render<br>
each electrode electrochemically active.<br>
Each fuel cell assembly 16 also includes a pair of separator or flow field<br>
plates 28 sandwiching the membrane electrode assembly 20. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, each of the flow field plates 28 includes one or more reactant channels 30<br>
formed on the planar surface of the flow field plate 28 adjacent to an associated one of<br>
the electrodes 22, 24 for carrying fuel to anode 22 and oxidant to cathode 24,<br>
respectively. Furthermore, each flow field plate 28 includes a plurality of cooling<br>
channels 32 formed on the planar surface of the flow field plate 28 opposite the planar<br>
surface having reactant channels 30. When fuel cell stack 10 is assembled, the cooling<br>
channels 32 of adjacent fuel cell assemblies 16 cooperate so that closed cooling<br>
channels 32 are formed between adjacent membrane electrode assemblies 20.<br>
While the illustrated embodiment includes two flow field plates 28 in<br>
each fuel cell assembly 16, other embodiments can include a single bipolar flow field<br>
plate (not shown) between adjacent membrane electrode assemblies 20. In such<br>
embodiments, channels on one side of the bipolar plate carry fuel to the anode of one<br>
adjacent membrane electrode assembly 20, while channels on the other side of the plate<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
carry oxidant to the cathode of another adjacent membrane electrode assembly 20. In<br>
such embodiments, additional flow field plates 28 having channels for carrying coolant<br>
fluid (e.g., liquid or gas, such as cooling air) can be spaced throughout fuel cell stack<br>
10, as needed to provide sufficient cooling of fuel cell stack 10.<br>
End plate 18a includes a fuel stream inlet port (not shown) for<br>
introducing a supply fuel stream into fuel cell stack 10. End plate 18b includes a fuel<br>
stream outlet port 35 for discharging an exhaust fuel stream from fuel cell stack 10. If<br>
desired, fuel stream outlet port 35 may be closed with a valve such that fuel cell stack<br>
10 operates in a dead-ended mode (i.e., a mode in which substantially all of the fuel<br>
supplied during operation is consumed). Each fuel cell assembly 16 has openings<br>
formed therein to cooperate with corresponding openings in adjacent assemblies 16 to<br>
form internal fuel supply and exhaust manifolds (not shown) that extend the length of<br>
stack 10 and are fluidly connected to fuel reactant channels 30.<br>
The end plate 18b includes an oxidant stream inlet port 37 for<br>
introducing a supply oxidant stream into fuel cell stack 10, and an oxidant stream outlet<br>
port 39 for discharging an exhaust oxidant stream from fuel cell stack 10. Each fuel<br>
cell assembly 16 has openings 31,34, formed therein to cooperate with corresponding<br>
openings in adjacent fuel cell assemblies 16 to form oxidant supply and exhaust<br>
manifolds (not shown) that extend the length of stack 10 and are fluidly connected to<br>
oxidant reactant channels 30.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, fuel cell stack 10 comprises two integrated current<br>
collector and electrical component plates 40. Although not specifically shown, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the electrical component is a resistor. Each current collector<br>
and resistor plate 40 is disposed between an end plate 18a or 18b and the corresponding<br>
fuel cell assembly 16 located at the end of fuel cell stack 10, shown in FIG. 1 and<br>
referred to herein as an end cell 36.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an exploded view of the configuration of the<br>
representative integrated current collector and resistor plate 40 of FIG. 1. As illustrated,<br>
the representative integrated current collector and resistor plate 40 comprises a printed<br>
circuit board comprising a plurality of layers, namely, an electrically conductive current<br>
collection layer 50 comprising a current collector 52, an electrically insulating first<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
insulation layer 60, an electrical component layer 70 comprising a resistor 72, and an<br>
electrically insulating second insulation layer 80. The current collection layer 50<br>
further comprises a current removal region 54, which is electrically isolated from the<br>
current collector 52. First insulation layer 60 comprises a first surface 62, a second<br>
surface 64, a first conductive via 66, and a second conductive via 68. Resistor 72<br>
comprises a first connection site 74 and a second connection site 76. Second insulation<br>
layer 80 comprises a first surface 82 and a second surface 84.<br>
When assembled, current collector layer 50 comprising current collector<br>
52 and current removal region 54 is laminated to first surface 62 of first insulation layer<br>
60, the electrical component layer 70 comprising resistor 72 is laminated between<br>
second surface 64 of first insulation layer 60 and first surface 82 of second insulation<br>
layer 80, and first connection site 74 of resistor 72 is electrically connected to current<br>
collector 52 by first conductive via 66 of first insulation layer 60. Furthermore, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment, second connection site 76 of resistor 72 is electrically<br>
connected to current removal region 54 by second conductive via 68 of first insulation<br>
layer 60.<br>
As noted above, when integrated into fuel cell stack 10, integrated<br>
current collector and resistor plate 40 is disposed between an end cell 36 of the fuel cell<br>
stack and an end plate 18a or 18b of the fuel cell stack. In this way, when fuel cell<br>
stack 10 is in its compressed and assembled state, current collection layer 50 will be<br>
adjacent to, and in electrical contact with, end cell 36, and second surface 84 of second<br>
insulation layer 80 will be adjacent to the end plate 18a or 18b.<br>
During operation, current from fuel cell stack 10 passes (1) from current<br>
collector 52 to first connection site 74 of resistor 72 through first conductive via 66, (2)<br>
through resistor 72, and (3) from second connection site 76 to current removal region<br>
54 through second conductive via 68. In this way, in the illustrated embodiment,<br>
resistor 72 is electrically connected in series to fuel cell stack 10. By sizing the<br>
magnitude of the resistance appropriately, heat can be provided to the adjacent end cell<br>
36 via resistive heating from resistor 72 in accordance with the current drawn from the<br>
fuel cell stack.   In such a case, it may not be necessary to use external temperature<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
regulation systems comprising components such as sensors, controllers, power supplies<br>
and electric heaters to heat the end cell.<br>
In an alternative embodiment (not shown), resistor 72 may be<br>
electrically connected in parallel to the fuel cell stack instead of in series. This may be<br>
accomplished, for instance, by drawing current from a different location on current<br>
collector 52 and by electrically connecting current removal region 54 (i.e., connecting<br>
second connection site 76) to the opposite end of the stack. Such a configuration may<br>
be employed to lower the voltage of the fuel cell stack during periods of open circuit or<br>
to act as a bleed down resistor during shutdown of the fuel cell stack (i.e., resistor 72<br>
draws a small amount of current, and, in this way, can lower the stack voltage or can<br>
"bleed" or consume excess hydrogen remaining in the fuel cell stack).<br>
Current collection layer 50 may comprise one or more additional layers<br>
of copper, nickel and/or gold. In an embodiment comprising each of such layers, the<br>
copper layer may be utilized to collect and distribute the bulk of the current from the<br>
fuel cell stack, and the nickel and gold layers may be utilized to ensure low electrical<br>
contact resistance when the integrated plate is exposed to corrosive conditions. For<br>
example, a nickel layer protects the copper conductive layer under a hard scratch, while<br>
a gold layer provides an oxide-free surface with low electrical contact resistance.<br>
In a typical embodiment, resistor 72 may be made of copper. Resistor<br>
72 may be continuous (as shown in FIG. 2) or may be formed as one or more traces. As<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, the resistance or heat desired will govern<br>
the thickness, length and width of resistor 72. If traces are to be used, the pitch (i.e., the<br>
number of traces per length) and/or width of the traces may be varied to provide for a<br>
specific resistance or heat dissipation in desired locations.<br>
It has been discovered that relatively thin current collectors may be<br>
desirable for use in certain fuel cell stack applications, although a minor loss of output<br>
power may be incurred as a result. One advantage in using relatively thin current<br>
collectors is that it allows for printed circuit board designs and manufacturing<br>
techniques to be used as well. With typical printed circuit board technology, multiple<br>
components made of copper or other foils (e.g., simple resistors) may readily be<br>
fashioned on a multi-layer board.   In this way, complicated patterns of conductive<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
traces can readily be formed. In a typical manufacturing process, suitable bare laminate<br>
materials are drilled to form openings and the laminate is then electroplated with<br>
conductor (e.g., copper). The conductor is then typically masked in accordance with<br>
the desired conductive pattern and unwanted conductor is etched away (e.g., via<br>
application of suitable photo-resist, patterning using UV light, and acid etching).<br>
Additional layers (e.g., insulators), materials (e.g., solder), and/or components can then<br>
be incorporated.<br>
The use of printed circuit board technology in the manufacture of an<br>
integrated current collector and electrical component plate as described above provides<br>
for a current collector (i.e., bus plate) which is relatively thin. While this may result in<br>
some minor power dissipation and hence loss of output power form the stack, there are<br>
advantages to having a current collector with significantly lower in-plane and through-<br>
plane thermal conductivity. Less heat is removed from the fuel cell stack as a<br>
consequence and thermal gradients within the fuel cells in the vicinity of the bus plates<br>
are decreased. This can be useful in reducing flooding in the fuel cells in the vicinity of<br>
the bus plates. In this way, the likelihood that end cells will experience performance<br>
issues is decreased. Furthermore, it provides a means of manufacturing using<br>
established and substantially more cost effective high volume circuit board<br>
manufacturing methods.<br>
In addition, this design also provides for the integration of a current<br>
collection layer with other fuel cell components, such as electrical and thermal<br>
insulators, end cell heaters, high potential bleed down resistors and shunt resistors, into<br>
a single plate. By minimizing the number of separate components, the present<br>
invention allows for the development of easier to handle, lightweight and space-<br>
efficient fuel cell systems.<br>
FIG. 3a shows another embodiment of the invention in which the<br>
integrated current collector and electrical component plate comprises a plurality of<br>
electrical components, (e.g., simple resistors), for purposes of mapping current<br>
distribution in a fuel cell stack. In the depicted schematic, suitably shaped copper traces<br>
are formed on the printed circuit board to form an array of shunt resistors. With<br>
reference to FIG. 3a, local currents are collected from flowfield plate 100 by local<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/071994	PCT/US2005/047457<br>
current collectors 101. The integrated current collector and shunt resistor plate<br>
comprises three electrically insulation layers 102, 106, and 110. Conductive vias 103<br>
electrically connect local current collectors 101 to an end (i.e., first connection site) of<br>
individual shunt resistors 104 in electrical component layer 105. In a like manner,<br>
conductive vias 107 electrically connect the other ends (i.e., second connection sites) of<br>
shunt resistors 104 to current collector 108 that serves as a bus plate. If the resistance<br>
of each shunt resistor is known, the current distribution in the stack can then be mapped<br>
by measuring the voltage drops across each shunt resistor. For this purpose, pairs of<br>
copper traces (not shown in FIG. 3a) are provided on the printed circuit board to<br>
connect the ends of each shunt resistor to a suitable voltage acquisition unit. FIG. 3b<br>
illustrates an exploded view of the configuration of one of the shunt resistors in the<br>
array of FIG. 3a. FIG. 3b shows a pair of traces 112 for acquiring the voltage drop<br>
across shunt resistor 104.<br>
In the embodiment of FIGS. 3a and 3b, the resistance of shunt resistors<br>
104 will be a function of temperature. For instance, over the practical operating range<br>
of a typical fuel cell (e.g., 0° to 100°C), the resistance may be expected to change of<br>
order of 10%. For some purposes, errors in measurement of this order may be accurate<br>
enough. However, for more sensitive measurements, an array of resistive thermometers<br>
may be incorporated into the integrated plate in order to measure, and hence correct for,<br>
the local temperature in the vicinity of each shunt resistor. This may be accomplished<br>
by forming an array of resistive traces (to serve as resistive thermometers) in a separate<br>
layer, that is electrically insulated from, but otherwise adjacent to the layer comprising<br>
the shunt resistor array. Via a series connected trace, a known current can be passed<br>
through each resistive thermometer. Then, in a like manner to the shunt resistor array,<br>
the voltage drop across each resistive thermometer can be acquired via pairs of voltage<br>
traces that are additionally formed in the layer. These voltage drops are indicative of<br>
the local temperature and this data can be used to correct the shunt resistor<br>
measurements. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that some power will be<br>
dissipated in the resistive thermometers. It would therefore be necessary to design the<br>
integrated plate such that this dissipated power is negligible compared to the fuel cell<br>
heat output in order to avoid perturbing the fuel cell stack.<br>
