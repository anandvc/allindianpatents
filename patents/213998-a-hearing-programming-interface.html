				<td>PATTFNT ISOLATING PROGRAM INTERFACE<br>
FOR PROGRAMMING HEARING<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to programmable hearing aids,<br>
a hearing programming interface<br>
and more particularly relates to a hearing programing interface<br>
programmable hearing aids. In its most immediate sense,<br>
the invention relates to hearing aid programming<br>
interfaces that are designed for use with hand-held<br>
computers.<br>
Programmable hearing aids are programmed by<br>
connecting them to a programming unit. One type of<br>
programming unit is a dedicated device that can only be<br>
used to program hearing aids. Another type of<br>
programming unit is a programming interface. A<br>
programming interface is a device connected between a<br>
computer and the hearing aids to be programmed. When a<br>
programming interface is used, the computer is loaded<br>
with appropriate software and the audiologist uses the<br>
software to issue commends to the programming interface.<br>
The programming interface then issues signals to the<br>
hearing aids, thereby programming them. The hearing aids<br>
are generally worn by the patient while they are<br>
connected to the programming interface.<br>
At present, programming interfaces are of two<br>
general types. One type, which is the HI-PRO programming<br>
interface presently sold by the assignee Siemens Hearing<br>
Instruments, Inc., is designed for connection to a<br>
personal computer. Another type, which is exemplified by<br>
the EXPRESSfit programming interface now being sold by<br>
Sonic Innovations, Inc., is designed for connection to a<br>
battery-powered hand-held computer (the Palm Pilot, in<br>
this instance). These two types of programming<br>
interfaces are subject to different regulatory<br>
requirements. In the case of the Siemens HI-PRO<br>
programming interface, the personal computer can be<br>
connected to an unprotected source, e.g. the computer<br>
power supply can be connected to the electrical mains,<br>
and the computer modem can be connected to an unprotected<br>
telephone jack. Because of this, lightning strikes,<br>
electrical malfunctions within the computer, etc. can<br>
subject the programming interface to dangerously high<br>
currents, which in turn can shock or even electrocute the<br>
patient. For this reason, regulatory agencies require<br>
that this type of programming interface electrically<br>
isolate the patient from the computer.<br>
In the case of the EXPRESSfit programming interface,<br>
applicable regulatory requirements are more lenient.<br>
Although the Palm Pilot computer can itself be connected<br>
to an unprotected source via a female jack for a modem<br>
connection or via a jack for a DC adapter, the EXPRESSfit<br>
device covers over these jacks when it is put into<br>
service. As a result, it is impossible for the Palm<br>
Pilot computer to be connected to an unprotected source<br>
while it is connected to the programming interface. For<br>
this reason, it is highly unlikely that any malfunctions<br>
in the Palm Pilot computer could produce any significant<br>
risk to the patient. For this reason, this type of<br>
programming interface need not isolate the patient from<br>
the computer.<br>
Recent developments in the field of programming<br>
interfaces have brought about unanticipated problems.<br>
For example, Micro Ear Technology, Inc. of Plymouth MN<br>
makes a programming interface sold under the MICROCARD<br>
trademark. This programming interface is packaged as a<br>
PCMCIA card so it can fit into a hand-held computer such<br>
as the Apple MessagePad 2000. When so installed, the<br>
programming interface need not isolate the patient from<br>
the computer. However, PCMCIA cards can also be used<br>
with conventional personal computers (laptop and desktop<br>
units). Because audiologists and other hearing aid<br>
dispensers make extensive use of personal computers in<br>
their practices, dispensers can install the MICROCARD<br>
programming interface in a PCMCIA port in a laptop<br>
computer or in a PCMCIA adapter that is connected to a<br>
desktop computer. When so installed, the patient is not<br>
isolated from the computer and the dispenser is not in<br>
compliance with applicable regulations.<br>
There is now a need for a programming interface that<br>
can be used with computers of all types. This is because<br>
dispensers use different types of computers for different<br>
purposes. For example, a dispenser may use a desktop<br>
computer when working in the office, may use a laptop<br>
computer when travelling to a factory to carry out a<br>
hearing conservation program, and may use a hand-held<br>
computer when working with patients at a nursing home.<br>
It would be advantageous if the dispenser could lawfully<br>
use the same programming interface with each of these<br>
computers, thereby eliminating the need to carry<br>
different devices for use with different computers.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a hearing<br>
aid programming interface that can be lawfully used with<br>
computers of all types.<br>
Another object is, in general to improve on known<br>
hearing aid programming interfaces.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a hearing aid<br>
programming interface is provided. The housing contains<br>
interface circuitry. A connector element conforming to<br>
the PCMCIA compact flash interface standard is mounted to<br>
the housing and permits the interface circuitry to be<br>
connected to a host computer. Means, mounted to the<br>
housing, are provided for connecting the interface<br>
circuitry to at least one hearing aid. A power supply is<br>
contained within the housing and supplies electrical<br>
power to the interface circuitry therein. The circuitry,<br>
the connecting means, and the power supply are<br>
electrically isolated from the host computer to prevent<br>
undesired stray currents from entering the patient while<br>
the host computer is connected to an unisolated power<br>
source, the patient is wearing said at least one hearing<br>
aid, and said at least one hearing aid is connected to<br>
the interface circuitry.<br>
By using a connector element that complies with the<br>
PCMCIA compact flash interface standard, the invention<br>
can be used with hand-held computers because they all<br>
accept PCMCIA compact flash cards. And, because the<br>
compact flash standard is a subset of the PCMCIA<br>
standard, a compact flash card can be connected to a<br>
laptop computer through a PCMCIA slot using a compact<br>
flash adapter (which is quite inexpensive). (A compact<br>
flash adapter is an electrical connector mounted in a<br>
frame. The frame is sized to receive a compact flash<br>
card so that it is mated to the connector, and is also<br>
sized to fit into a standard PCMCIA slot so that the<br>
connector is mated to the PCMCIA port.) Furthermore,<br>
cards in PCMCIA format can be made available to the<br>
hardware in desktop computers by using commonly-available<br>
peripheral devices known as PCMCIA card readers. Hence,<br>
the invention makes it possible to easily and<br>
inexpensively connect a single programming interface to<br>
desktop, laptop, and hand-held computers, while remaining<br>
compliant at all times with applicable patient isolation<br>
requirements.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the power supply draws<br>
electrical power from the host computer to which the<br>
programming interface is connected. This avoids the need<br>
to have a separate power supply that must e.g. be<br>
connected to the electrical mains. Advantageously, in<br>
instances where the programming interface draws more<br>
power than can conveniently be taken from the host<br>
computer, a battery can be provided to supplement the<br>
power supply.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention will be better understood with the aid<br>
of the illustrative and non-limiting drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a known programming interface in PCMCIA<br>
format;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the mechanical packaging of the<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The following description assumes that<br>
fitting/programming software (such as that marketed<br>
through Siemens Hearing Instruments, Inc. under the<br>
CONNEXX trademark) is running on a computer. It is also<br>
assumed that a hearing aid dispenser wishes to use that<br>
software in the process of fitting the patient with at<br>
least one, but usually two, properly-programmed hearing<br>
aids. To do this, a programming interface is connected<br>
between the computer and the aid(s) to be programmed.<br>
Then, the dispenser operates the computer and causes the<br>
aid(s) to be programmed (and reprogrammed, if necessary)<br>
until the patient has been properly fitted.<br>
Persons skilled in the art are familiar with such<br>
software and with the methods by which hearing aids are<br>
fit to the patient and programmed. For this reason,<br>
neither the software_nor the fitting methodology will be<br>
described.<br>
Referring first to Fig. 1, it can be seen that a<br>
programming interface 2 in the format of a PCMCIA card<br>
can be plugged into a PCMCIA slot 4 in a desktop computer<br>
6 or in a hand-held computer 8. Two hearing aids 10 and<br>
12 can be connected to the programming interface 2 via<br>
cables 14 and a male connector 16 that can be plugged<br>
into a corresponding female connector (not visible)<br>
located in the programming interface 2.<br>
This known programming interface 2, which is<br>
available from Micro Ear Technology, Inc. under the<br>
MICROCARD trademark, draws its power from the host<br>
computer (6 or 8) to which it is connected. While this<br>
poses no regulatory issues if the host computer is a<br>
hand-held computer 8, it does pose a regulatory issue if<br>
the host computer is a desktop computer 6. This is<br>
because a) the programming interface is not sufficiently<br>
well electrically isolated as to satisfy patient safety<br>
requirements established by IEC 60601-1, type BF in<br>
Europe and UL 2601-1 in the U.S. and b) the desktop<br>
computer 6 can be connected to unprotected sources. For<br>
example, the desktop computer 6 can be connected to a<br>
telephone line 20 via a modem 22 or to the electrical<br>
mains 24 via a power cord 26. Let it for example be<br>
assumed that lightning strikes the telephone line 20 or<br>
the electrical mains 24 while a patient (not shown) is<br>
wearing the hearing aids 10 and/or 12. In that event, a<br>
high voltage spike can propagate through the circuitry in<br>
the desktop computer 6, into and through the programming<br>
interface 2, into the hearing aids 10 and 12, and thence<br>
into the patient"s body. This poses a risk of injury to<br>
the patient.<br>
Although it might be possible to re-engineer the<br>
programming interface 2 so as to electrically isolate the<br>
patent in accordance with the above-identified<br>
regulations, this would certainly be very difficult and<br>
very expensive. This is because the above-identified<br>
regulations require that the programming interface 2<br>
withstand a specific high voltage without any current<br>
leakage into the cables 14. To do this at a reasonable<br>
cost, an isolation transformer is required, and a<br>
conventional isolation transformer suitable to this task<br>
cannot be packaged in a PCMCIA format.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the invention will now<br>
be discussed with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. Turning<br>
first to Fig. 2, a housing generally indicated by<br>
reference number" 100 has an intromittent connector<br>
element 102 and an exterior element 104. The connector<br>
element 102 conforms to the PCMCIA compact flash standard<br>
and when introduced into a PCMCIA compact flash compliant<br>
slot 106 in a host computer 108 is electrically connected<br>
thereto. The preferred embodiment may optionally contain<br>
a battery compartment 119 in which a battery 121 (see<br>
Fig. 3) may be installed. A battery 121 may be required<br>
if design power requirements exceed host supply<br>
capabilities. Two female connectors 110 (which are<br>
advantageously of the 6 pin, mini DIN type) are mounted<br>
to the exterior element 104. Mating male connectors 112<br>
and cables 114 can be used to connect one or two hearing<br>
aids 10, 12 to the preferred embodiment through the<br>
female connectors 110. Interface circuitry (not shown in<br>
Fig. 2) is used to program one or both of the hearing<br>
aids 10, 12. If the preferred embodiment is to be used<br>
with a laptop or desktop computer, it can be plugged into<br>
a conventional PCMCIA flash card adapter 123, which in<br>
turn can be plugged into the laptop or desktop computer<br>
125 containing a PCMCIA compliant slot 127.<br>
To satisfy the requirements of the above-identified<br>
regulations, the preferred embodiment must be able to<br>
withstand specified high voltage without any leakage<br>
current into the cables 114 when the male connectors 112<br>
are connected to the female connectors 110. This is<br>
accomplished by using the circuitry shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The connector element 102 has a connector 118 at its<br>
distal end to make an electrical connection with the host<br>
computer 108. To provide electrical power for the<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, a switching power<br>
supply 120 _is__ supplied with current from the host<br>
computer 108 (not shown in Fig. 3). The switching power<br>
supply 120 is connected to the primary winding of an<br>
isolation transformer 122. The isolation transformer 122<br>
provides the required electrical isolation. In this way,<br>
voltage spikes etc. will not be propagated into the<br>
preferred embodiment through the power supply circuitry,<br>
thereby also isolating the patient as required by the<br>
above-referenced regulations. Because the isolation<br>
transformer 122 is comparatively bulky and therefore<br>
cannot be mounted to the connector element 102, it is<br>
located in the exterior element 104.<br>
As stated above, the battery 121 can be provided<br>
when the power requirements of the preferred embodiment<br>
exceed the power available from the host computer. The<br>
battery 121 is connected to power supply circuitry 144<br>
and supplies electrical power thereto while the<br>
programming interface is in use.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the invention also<br>
receives data from the host computer 108. This data<br>
comes through the connector 118, bus interface circuitry<br>
124, and a UART 126. To isolate the preferred<br>
embodiment from voltage spikes propagated through the<br>
data bus circuitry, one or more opto isolators 128 are<br>
used. The opto isolator(s) 128 are located between the<br>
UART 12 6 and a microcontroller 13 0, and like the<br>
isolation transformer 122 they can easily provide<br>
required isolation without current leakage into the<br>
microcontroller 130.<br>
It will thus be understood that in accordance with<br>
the preferred embodiment all the circuitry (and therefore<br>
the patient) is sufficiently isolated to meet the<br>
requirements of the above-identified regulations.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, only one hearing aid (10 or 12) is programmed<br>
at one time. To program the hearing aids 10 and 12, a<br>
multiplexer 132 is used to select the particular hearing<br>
aid (10 or 12) to be programmed. Programming is carried<br>
out by generating appropriate analog signals using<br>
digital-to-analog converters 134, which supply the<br>
necessary clock and data signals. These signals are<br>
routed through multiplexers 136, which select a source<br>
impedance appropriate to program the particular hearing<br>
aids 10 and 12 that are to be programmed. (Different<br>
models of hearing aids are programmed differently.) The<br>
voltages across resistors 138 are used to read the input<br>
impedance of the hearing aids 10 and 12 and to thereby<br>
determine the models of the hearing aids 10 and 12 (so as<br>
to select the appropriate protocols to program them). A<br>
protective circuit 140 is used to prevent conducted EMI<br>
from interfering with the surrounding environment and to<br>
protect the circuitry from static discharge.<br>
The preferred embodiment contains a provision for<br>
input of data from an external source (such as a control<br>
box operated by the patient during programming of the<br>
hearing aids 10 and 12). So, too, the preferred<br>
embodiment contains a provision for outputting data to an<br>
external display (such as a display to be viewed by the<br>
patient during programming of the hearing aids 10 and<br>
12)•<br>

inly by the following claims:<br>
