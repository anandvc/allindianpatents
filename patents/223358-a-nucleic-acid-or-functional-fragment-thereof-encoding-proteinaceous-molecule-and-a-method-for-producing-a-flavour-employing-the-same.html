Title:   Isoprenoid Synthases<br>
The invention relates to the field of genetic engineering of flavor, fragrance or bio-control agent development. More specifically it relates to a process for production of bioactive isoprenoid compounds by the control or modulation of one or more genes implicated in that process.<br>
Isoprenoids are the largest and most diverse group of plant secondary compounds. At least 20,000 isoprenoids have been described and without doubt many more will be discovered in the future. By definition isoprenoids are made up of socalled isoprene (C5) units. This can be recognized in the number of C-atoms present in the isoprenoids which usually can be divided by five (C5, CIO. Cl5, C20, C25, C30 and C40), although also irregular isoprenoids and polyterpenes have been reported. Important members of the isoprenoids a.o. are the carotenoids, gibberellins, abscisic acid, some Cytokinins, sterols, and the terpenoids, consisting of a.o. monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenes and polyterpenes (rubbers), etc. Most of these compounds occur free but they can also be modified, or derivatized as esters and glycosides, or attached to proteins. Among the isoprenoids there are many compounds with biological activity, for example as plant growth regulator (gibbereUins, abscisic acid, cytokinins). and in the interaction between plants and other organisms (for example as anti-microbials, infochemicals and as the isoprenoid germination stimxilants that are exuded by the roots of some plant species and induce the germination of parasitic weed seeds).<br>
Mono- and sesquiterpenes, the CIO and CIS branch of the isoprenoid family, were investigated for their economically interesting value as flavor and firagrance compounds in foods and cosmetics and their anti-carcinogenic and antimicrobial properties. Mono- and sesquiterpenes have also been shown to be of ecological significance, for instance in the interaction between plants, plants and insects/spider mites and plants and microorganisms. Therefore, plants producing mono- and sesquiterpenes have been investigated by many authors and this has resulted in a better understanding of the biochemical pathways leading to the formation of these compounds and their derivatives.<br><br>
\,<br>
Linalool is an acyclic monoterpene alcohol that has a peculiar creamy floral, sweet taste. In Clarkia breweri (Onagraceae) linalool, amongst other compounds, is responsible for the attraction of pollinating moths. Linalool is one of the volatile compounds released as a semiochemical after herbivore attack in some plants and as such may attract predators of the herbivores. The sweet taste of linalool makes it suitable to enhance the blueberry flavor of foodstuffs especially of beverages (US Patent 4041185). Furthermore, linalool is known to have a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It is reported by Pattnaik et al. (Microbios 89: 39-46. 1997) to display antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as antifungal activity against yeast-like and filamentous fungi.<br>
Nerolidol, the sesquiterpene analogue of the monoterpenoid linalool, is a component of many essential oils and flower headspaces (Bauer et al.. Common Fragrance and Flavor Materials. Preparations, Properties and Uses, VCH Verlaggesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany, 1990; Knudsen et al, Phytochemistry 33: 253-280, 1993). Nerolidol has been reported to have anti-microbial activity. EP 0420630A2 describes the use of nerolidol in an antiplaque oral composition. Bouwmeester et al (Plant Physiol. 121: 173-180. 1999) for cucumber and Lima bean and Degenhardt and Gershenzon (Planta 210: 815-822, 2000) for maize showed that nerolidol biosynthesis is induced upon respectively spider mite or Spodoptera feeding. The enzyme responsible for the formation of nerolidol catalyses the regulatory step in the formation of the important signalling molecule 4,8-dimethyH,3(Â£),7-nonatriene. Both nerolidol and 4,8-dimethyl-l,3(E),7-nonatriene are important constituents of the volatile blend produced in maize upon feeding of beet army worm larvae (Turlings et al, Science 250:1251-1253.1990; Degenhardt and Gershenzon, 2000) and in gerbera in response to feeding of spider mites (Krips et al., J. Chem Ecol 1999), Also in the headspace of several flowers, nerolidol is an important constituent often together with 4,8-dimethyl-l,3(E),7-nonatriene (Kaiser, In: Perfumes: Art, Science and Technology, Elsevier Science Publishers, Essex, UK, pp 213-250, 1991; Knudsen et al., 1993). Nerolidol has also been reported as a constituent of pheromone mixtures of a number of insects and spider mites (Aldrich-JR; Lusby-WR; Knchansky-JP, Experientia. 1986, 42: 5, 583-585; Regv-S; Cone-WW. Environmental-Entomology<br><br>
1976, 5: 1, 133-138) and has been described as being miticidal if formulated in a controlled release substrate (US patent 4775534).Also, nerolidol has been reported to be an extremely effective repellent of mosquitoes.<br>
From a number of plants, several cDNAs encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenoids have been isolated such as S-hnalool and i?-hnalool synthases (Cseke et al., Mol Biol. Evol. 15: 1491-1498, 1998; Jia et al., Arch Biochem Biophys 372: 143-149, 1999), (-)-4S limonene synthase (Colby et al., J Biol Chem 268: 23016-23024, 1993; Bohlmann et al., J Biol Chem 272: 21784-21792, 1997).<br>
WO 9715584 describes the use of S-linalool synthase, an acyclic monoterpene synthase, in the genetic engineering of scent production. The use of the limonene (monoterpene) cyclase in the control of corn rootworm, by inserting a nucleotide sequence coding for limonene cyclase into the plants is described in WO 9637102. In WO 0022150 the use of a hmonene synthase, Unalool synthase and combination of limonene and carveol synthase (actually called hmonene hydroxylase) for the control of insects is described. However, terpenoid products were only formed in combination with a GPP synthase.<br>
The enzymes involved in the production of precursors for the synthesis of the primary monoterpene skeletons are all active in the plastids, since all cloned genes of this pathway until now have plastid targeting signals. Recently, for one enzyme, (4S)-limonene synthase, localisation in the leucoplasts of the secretory cells in Mentha spicata has been demonstrated with immunogold labeling. The plastid targeting signals indicate that isoprenoid precursors for monoterpene metabolism are formed in the plastids, although some partitioning of these precursors between the different cellular compartments in plants has been shown to occur. Unlike other monoterpene (and diterpene) cyclases that bear cleavable transit peptides of 50-70 amino acids, the S-linalool synthase cDNA isolated by Pichersky and co-workers encodes a protein with an apparent cleavable peptide of maximally only eight amino acids long. Nevertheless, typical plastid targeting signal characteristics were found in the first<br><br>
60 amino acids of the cDNA, supporting that the linalool synthase enzyme, as expected for a monoterpene synthase, is indeed targeted to the plastids. Two independent cDNA clones encoding 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) from tobacco have been isolated and characterised by Facchini and Chappell (Proc Natl Acad. ScL USA, 89:11088-11092, 1992). Back and Chappell described the cloning and bacterial expression of vetispiradiene synthase found in Hyoscyamus muticus (J, BioL Chem., 270(13):7375-7381. 1995). The cDNA encoding amorphÎ±-4,ll-diene synthase, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the anti-malarial artemisinin, was isolated and characterised by Merclce et al. {Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 381(1):173-180, 2000). Sesquiterpene biosynthesis is compartmentalised to the cytosol, and none of the sofar isolated sesquiterpene synthases bear any targeting signal. Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is present in every living organism and it is the precm'sor of a large number of primary and secondary metabolites. It has been established that FPP is the precursor of all sesquiterpenoids. There are several thousands of different sesquiterpenoid compounds identified in many Uving organisms. Examples are the bitter sesquiterpene lactones such as sonchuside A and C, and cichorilide A in chicory (De Kraker et aL, Plant Physiol 117: 1381-1392, 1998). The first committed step Ln the biosynthesis of these compounds is catalysed by a germacrene A synthase which was cloned from chicory (PCT/EP 0002130). Other examples are the cloning of three sesquiterpene synthases ((E)-Î±-bisabolene, 5-selinene , and Î³-humulene synthase) from grand fir (WO 99/37139; Bohlmann et al., proc Natl Acad Sci, USA, 95: 6756-6761), and a germacrene C synthase from tomato (Colby et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA 95: 2216-2221). The use of the amorphÎ±-4,ll-diene synthase in the engineering of artemisinin biosynthesis is described in EP 0 982 404 Al. However, the putative sesquiterpene synthase responsible for the formation of the biologically important nerolidol has never been cloned.<br>
The use of recombinant DNA technology to introduce resistance based on secondary metabolites in plants has had only limited success. For example, Hain et al (Nature 361, 153-156, 1993) succeeded in introducing fungal resistance in a number of plant species by the introduction of the resveratrol synthase cDNA, that they isolated from grape. Although there are reports on the anti-microbial and insecticidal effects of<br><br>
specific terpenoids, resistance against fungi as a result of the expression of a terpene synthase in plants has not been reported sofar.<br>
The invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid or functional fragment thereof encoding a proteinaceous molecule essentially capable of isoprenoid bioactive compound (herein also identified as flavor, fragrance and/or bio-control agent) synthesis when provided with a suitable substrate under appropriate reaction conditions. Presently, the main way to produce plant flavor (for ease of reference with flavor also fragrances are generally meant) compounds is by the synthetic route. Synthetic organic chemicals constitute more than 80-90% (by weight and value) of the raw materials used in flavor and frragrance formulations. However, problems often exist concerning production. Extaction from intact plants and conventional fermentation are currently providing alternative routes for the commercial production of flavor/ aroma chemicals. However, the demand for natural flavors by the consumer has been steadily increasing, and demand often outstrips supply. In many cases sought after flavor compounds can not easily be isolated. An understanding of the precursors and characterization of genes encoding enzymes involved in diverse pathways leading to the formation of flavors is essential for the production of natural flavors. The nucleic acids and their encoded proteinaceous molectdes of the present invention are involved in the biosynthetic pathway for terperoid production and as such they provide new means and methods for the in-vivo and in-vitro biotechnological production of bio-flavours, natural flavor chemicals and bio-control compounds.<br>
In addition the nucleic acids and their encoded proteinaceous molectdes of the present invention and products synthesized are essentially capable acting as potent bio-control agents alone or in combination.<br>
Fungi and bacteria have become an increasing threat to humans. Opportmistic microbial infections have increased dramatically in the last two decades and have become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Over recent years, the firequency of life-threatening fungal infections has increased dramatically, making fungal infections now responsible for nearly 40% of all deaths from hospital-acquired infections. Increased numbers of patients with an impaired immune system (such as<br><br>
due to ageing, severe bums, AIDS, chemotherapy against cancer, or immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplants), together with a growing list of potential pathogenic fungi and bacteria are recognized as factors contributing to tliis rising public health-hazard. There is only a limited set of bio-control compounds available, and resistance to existing bio-control drugs is becoming a problem of increasing concern. Also clinically used antimycotics may show harmful side effects.<br>
Fungi are responsible for substantial economic losses due to food spoilage caused by highly dangerous toxins (mycotoxins). To add to this problem food additives to prevent fungal contamination may also be potentially carcinogenic. Additionally plant pathogenic micro-organisms cause huge crop losses and this has promoted the extensive use of pesticides all over the world. Some pesticides have deleterious effects on other organisms than the pests they are intended to control, on water quality, and on the environment in general. Current antimicrobials are often not specific enough, and several microbial species exhibit increasing resistance to these pesticides. There is a need to develop new and more advanced bio-control agents with novel modes of action and broad spectra directed against plant and animal pathogens. The nucleic acids and their encoded proteinaceous molecules of the present invention involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, as such provide a new method for the in-vivo and in-uitro biotechnological production of natural and more specific anti-microbials or bio-control agents, for example antifungals.<br>
The nucleic acid as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide, nucleotide or polynucleotide, and fragments or portions thereof and to DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic origin which maybe single- or double-stranded, and represents the sense or antisense strand. A proteinaceous molecule as used herein refers to a molecule comprising peptide or protein. Natural flavor synthesis as used herein refers to flavor and fragrance compounds synthesized that are identical to their natural counterpsurts. Natural counterpart as used herein refers to products that are obtained directly from plants and sometimes from animal sources by physical procedm^es. Sjrnthetic flavors refers to nature identical compoimds that are produced synthetically but are chemically identical to their natural counterpart. Nature-identical compounds are with few exceptions the only synthetic compounds used in flavors in addition to natural products. Artificial flavor synthesis refers to flavor<br><br>
compounds that have not been identified in plant or animal products for human consumption. The nucleic acids of the present invention pave the way for the production of artificial flavors using techniques known in the art such as for example combinatorial biosynthesis, metabolic pathway engineering, gene shuffling, directed evolution of proteins etc. Bio-control synthesis as used herein refers to bio-control compounds synthesized which can act as an bio-control agent. A bio-control agent as used herein refers to a compound, which can at least in part suppress or inhibit or restrict the growth of a pathogenic organism (e.g. fungi, bacteria etc.), that is a compound that has anti-pathogenic activity.<br>
The invention further provides for a nucleic acid or functional fragment thereof wherein said nucleic acid encodes a proteinaceous molecule essentially capable of synthesizing at least a monoterpene alcohol linalool when contacted with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and/or at least a sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol when contacted with farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) under appropriate reaction conditions. The definition 'functional fragment thereof means that a particidar subject sequence may vary firom the reference sequence by one or more substitutions, deletions, or additions, the net effect of which does not result in an adverse functional dissimilarity between the reference and the subject sequence. It may be advantageous to produce a nucleic acid according to the invention or derivatives thereof possessing a substantially different codon usage. It is known by those skiUed in the art that as a result of degeneracy of the genetic code, a multitude of gene sequences, some bearing minimal homology to the nucleotide sequences of any known and any naturally occurring genes may be produced. The invention includes possible variation of the nucleic add sequence that could be made by selecting combinations based on possible codon choices. In addition deliberate amino acid substitution may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, and/or the amphipathetic nature of the residues as long as the biological activity of the polypeptide is retained. In a preferred embodiment said nucleic acid encodes a terpene cyclase which has a combined nerolidol and linalool synthesizing capacity. Nerolidol is a sesquiterpene analog of the monoterpenoid linalool. The enzymes involved in the production of precursors for the Synthesis of the primary monoterpene skeletons have been shown to be active in the plastids. The ability of said terpene cyclase to synthesize linalool<br><br>
appears to be influenced by the presence of a plastid targeting signal sequence that is rich in hydroxylated and basic residues. Sesquiterpene biosynthesis is compartmentalised to the cytosol, and none of the sofar isolated sesquiterpene synthases bear any targeting signal. However, the present invention shows that monoterpenes can also be produced by cytosolic monoterpene synthases. Apparently the substrate GPP is present in the cytosol. The invention shows that the production of sesquiterpenes in the cytosol is hampered by a lack of substrate. The co-expression of a cytosolic FPP-synthase or the transformation with a fusion construct of sesquiterpene synthase and FPP synthase is now provided to overcome this problem. An additional solution is the targeting of sesquiterpene biosynthesis to other cell compartments by adding or changing a targeting signal to/of the sesquiterpene synthase and/or co-transformation of an FPP synthase with the same targeting or transformation with a targeted fusion construct of sesquiterpene synthase and FPP synthase. In addition to FPP synthase, other enzymes catalyzing committed steps in the biosynthesis of GPP and FPP through the mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathway can be coupled to or co-expressed with monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases to increase the levels of monoterpenes and/or sesquiterpenes produced. These enzymes can be directed (by adding, changing and removing targeting signals) to different compartments (i.e. mitochondria, chloroplasts, chromoplasts, leucoplasts, peroxisomes (see also example 7).<br>
The invention thus provides a nucleic acid according to the invention encoding a proteinaceous molecule provided with a targeting signal, such as a plastid targeting or a mitochondrial targeting signal, or a targeting signal to any other organel or a nucleic acid according to the invention encoding a proteinaceous molecule without such signal, depending on where synthesis is req\ured. The invention thus provides a nucleic acid according to the invention encoding a proteinaceous molecule essentially capable of isoprenoid bio-active compound synthesis in the cytosol in a cell when provided with a suitable substrate under appropriate reaction conditions. Similarly, it provides a nucleic acid according to the invention encoding a proteinaceous molecule essentially capable of-isoprenoid bio-active compound synthesis in a plastid in a cell or in a mitochondrium in a cell when provided with a suitable substrate imder appropriate reaction conditions.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment said nucleic acid as provided herein is provided with a nucleic acid encoding a targeting signal and/or remnants of a targeting signal. Preferably said targeting signal is a plastid targeting signal. Said plastid targeting signal is preferably located in the N terminus (N-terminal transit peptide) and may have a high abundance of serine residues and/or theronine and/or a low number of acidic residues and/or rich in hydroxy la ted and basic residues. In one preferred embodiment said targeting signal has a F (Phe), K (Lys), V (Val), F (Phe), N (Asn) motif and/or a D (asp) S (Ser), L (Leu), L (Leu), Xaa, S (Ser), S (Ser) motif, where Xaa is preferably P(pro) or S (Ser). In another, the target signal RRxxxxxxxxW is preferred. In particvdar the invention provides a nucleic acid encoding an essentially sesquiterpene synthase bioactive fragment, said nucleic acid provided with a targeting signal to provide the encoded gene product with monoterpene Synthase activity, or a nucleic acid encoding an essentially monoterpene synthase bioactive fragment, said nucleic acid deprived from an essentially plastid targeting signal to provide the encoded gene product with sesquiterpene synthase activity, and thus provides the various enzymes with a different activity as would be expected.<br>
It is understood that through convergent or divergent evolution new proteins with altered functions may be created by this route. The mutations that lead to divergence are mostly single base substitutions that engender individual amino acid replacements, although other events leading to deletions or insertions also occur. The mutations may be in a nucleic acid comprising the transit peptide and/or the open reading frame (ORF). The new protein usually contains many of the pre-existing features. The original biological function may be restored by reversing mutations (e.g. single base substitutions) using techniques known in the art (e.g. site directed mutagenesis).<br>
In a preferred embodiment through a single base substitution in a predecessor sequence of said nucleic acid sequence (e.g. H64NORL) the N-terminal transit peptide is restored- Restored as used herein means that a stop codon in the target signal is removed, for example through a single base substitution, so that translation begins at the first ATG (Met) upstream of the target signal/transit sequence or target signal remnant. The predecessor sequence of said nucleic sequence is a sequence (common ancestor sequence) which has a stop codon in the target signal or the target<br><br>
signal remnant so that the translation of the protein begins at a second ATG (Met) truncating the target signal or the target signal remnant. It is conjectured that the presence of the restored target signal or target signal remnant influences the synthesis of hnalool and/or nerolidol.<br>
The invention provides for a nucleic acid according to the invention wherein said proteinaceous molecule comprises a terpene synthase/cyclase. Preferably said proteinaceous molecule comprises a terpene synthase (cyclase), the properties of which should resemble those of other terpene synthases (cyclases). The invention further provides a nucleic acid according to the invention wherein said proteinaceous molecule comprises a sesquiterpenoid synthase/cyclase. Sesquiterpenoid synthases/cyclases participate in the biosynthesis of most sesquiterpenoids. Ionization of FPP to the farnesyl cation is the first step in the biosynthesis of a large number of sesquiterpenes. The products of many of the sesquiterpenoid synthases/qrclases catalyzing the formation of a terpenoid skeleton from the respective diphosphate substrates (FPP) are mostly cyclic hydrodrocarbons, with a few exceptions such as for example the acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol. None of the sofar isolated sesquiterpene synthases bear any targeting signal.<br>
The invention further comprises a nucleic acid according to the invention wherein said proteinaceous molecule comprises a nerolidol synthase/cyclase protein or functional fragment thereof. The nerolidol synthase/cyclase protein is essentially capable of the synthesis of the acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol.<br>
The invention provides a nucleic acid wherein said nerolidol synthase/cyclase comprises (3S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase. The inventioq. furtiier comprises a nucleic acdd according to the invention wherein said sesquiterpene alcohol nerolidol comprises trans-nerolidol. The invention further comprises a nucleic acid according to the invention wherein said monoterpene alcohol linalool comprises S-linalool.<br>
The invention provides for a nucleic add according to the invention wherein said nucleic acid encodes a proteinaceous molecule comprising an amino acid sequence or functional fragment thereof that is at least 50% identical to H64MUT sequence, more preferred 53 or 60% homologous, and even more preferred 70, 80, 90, 95 or 99% homologous to the sequence as shown in Figure 2 or functional fragment thereof<br><br>
Homology is generally over the full-length of the relevant sequence shown herein- As is well-understood, homology at the amino acid level is generally in terms of amino acid similarity or identity. Similarity allows for "conservative variation", i. e. substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another, such as arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acid, or glutamine for asparagine. Deliberate amino acid substitution may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, and/or the amphipathetic nature of the residues as long as the biological activity of the polypeptide is retained. In a preferx'ed embodiment, all percentage homologies referred to herein refer to percentage sequence identity, e.g. percent (%) amino acid sequence identity with respect to a particular reference sequence can be the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, without considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.

Examples<br>
The following examples are offered by way of illlistration.<br>
Example 1. Analysis of terpenes in wild and cliltivated strawberry<br>
Terpenoid Biosynthesis in Wild and Cliltivated Strawberries<br>
The cliltivated variety (Elsanta) lised by lis for the mentioned experiments prodlices both the monoterpene linalool and the sesqliiterpene nerohdol. On the other hand the wild cliltivar lised (PRI line 92189) prodlices low levels of linalool blit does not show a trace of nerolidol. Both literatlire reports and olir own GC-MS data show similar patterns of linalool and nerolidol prodliction in several other cliltivated and wild strawberry varieties. Olir seqliencing data and experiments lising the recombinant enzymes prodliced in Exoli show that the capability of the cliltivated variety to form nerolidol was acqliired by removing (by deletions and translation stop) the targeting signal to the plastid [were the slibstrate for monoterpene biosynthesis is available (GPP)] and by directing the translation start to the downstream AliG codon. However, linalool in the cliltivated varieties may also be formed by enzymes encoded by genes similar to H64TAR2, H64TAR4 and H64TAR6 which contain a proper targeting signal with no stop and therefore their protein prodlicts are directed to the plastid for forming linalool. If GPP is present in the cytosol, then linalool colild also be prodliced there by an enzyme encoded by a cytosolically expressed cDNA. We can not excllide that translation in H64TAR2, H64TAR4 and H64TAR6 may also start from the downstream AliG codon (the one downstream from the RR motif and not the additional AliG codon present jlist prior the RR motif) and this will reslilt in the formation of nerolidol as well. However, since cliltivated varieties like the ones lised in this stlidy are mostly octaploids it is likely that evollitionary processes as polyploidity allows the plant to form an additional (mlitated) gene from an existing gene and to prodlice an additional beneficial compolind slich as nerohdol for flavolir and defense. Williams et aL, (Biochemistry 1998,37,12213-12220) described a role for the tandem arginines present in the N-terminal of monoterpene synthases in the<br><br>
liniqlie diphosphate migration step accompanying formation of the intermediate 3-s-linalyl diphosphate and preceding the final cyclization reaction catalyses by the monoterpene synthases. This RR motif is present in H64TAR2, H64TAR6, and H64VES and this might explain the formation of linalool by this genes encoding en2ymes. However, the H64MliT recombinant protein does not contain the RR motif blit catalyses the formation of both nerolidol and linalool. This might implicate other residlies between the RR motif location and the down stream AliG as flinctioning to determine whether monoterpene will be formed.. This motif contain 12 amino acids: N-termini- DSLLPSSITIKP.<br>
The short genomic DNA seqlience obtained (H64W149) contains an RW motif instead of an RR motif and it might be of importance for the formation of the monoterpene linalool. In the wild cliltivars (diploid) only one variant encoding a protein with a targeting signal colild be identified (both by PCR on either DNA and RNA) which may only catalyze the formation of the low levels of linalool detected.<br>
Headspace analysis. Samples of ripe or ripening frliits were enclosed in 1-L glass jars that were closed with a teflon-lined lid eqliipped with an in- and olitlet, and placed in a climate room at 25oc and 210 Î¼mol.m-2 provided by 400-W HPI-T lights (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). A vaclilim plimp was lised to draw of air throligh the glass jars at approximately 100 mL min-1 with the incoming air being plirified throligh a glass cartridge (140 x 4 mm) containing 150 mg Tenax TA (20/35 mesh, Alitech, Breda, the Netherlands). At the olitlet the volatiles emitted by the firliits were trapped on a similar Tenax cartridge. Volatiles were sampled dliring 24 h. Cartridges were ellited lising 3x1 mL of redistilled pentane-diethyl ether (4:1). Of the (non-concentrated) samples, 2Î¼L were analysed by GC-MS lising an HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph eqliipped with an HP-5MS collimn (30 m x 0.25 nam i.d., 0.25 Î¼m df) and an HP 5972AMass Selective Detector. The GC was programmed at an initial temperatlire of 45Â°C for 1 min, with a ramp of 10o min-1 to 280Â°C and final time of 5 min. The injection port (sphtless mode), interface and MS solirce temperatlires were 250, 290 and 180oC, respectively, and the He inlet presslire was controlled by electronic presslire control to achieve a constant collimn flow of 1.0 mL<br><br>
min-1 Ionization potential was set at 70 eV, and scanning was performed from 48-250 amli.<br>
The analysis of the headspace profiles was foclised on terpenoids by only showing the ion 93 chromatogram (altholigh samples were analysed lising the SCAN mode). In that way, remarkable differences can be seen between cliltivated and wild strawberry: the headspace profile of the wild strawberry contains carvylacetate and a nlimber of olefinic monoterpenes slich as Î±-pinene, myrcene, Î±-phellandrene, and Î±-terpinolene, Î±-terpineol and Î³-terpinene (the last three tentatively identified) (Figlire lA), whereas the cliltivated is dominated by two major peaks only: linalool and trans-nerolidol (Figlire IB).<br>
Example 2. General Moleclilar Techniqlies<br>

RNA gel blots experiments were performed as described by iVharoni et al., [The Plant Celi, (2000) 12, 647-661].<br>
Cloning flill length cDNAs was performed by lising the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) according to the manlifactlirer instrlictions with slight modifications either to annealing temperattires (normally redliced by 5 to 10oC compared to the one recommended) or amolint of cycles (lip to 35 cycles). PCR, restriction digests, plasmid DNA isolation and gel electrophoresis were performed lising standard protocols. All fragments were plirified olit of gel lising the GFX plirification kit (Amersham). (Zoning of PCR fr-agments was either done to the PCR SCRIPT (Stratagene) or pCR 4Bllint-T0P0 (Invitrogen) vectors (for bllint end prodlicts generated when lising pfli polymerase) or to the pGEM-T Easy (Promega) vector (when A tailed PCR prodlicts were generated by the lise of taq polymerase).

Example 3. Constrliction of a Strawberry Red Frliit Stage cDNA Library, Mass Excision and Random Seqliencing<br>
Messenger RNA Isolation and cDNA Library Constrliction<br>
Total RNA was isolated from strawberry frliit red stage of development lising the method described by Manning K. [Analytical Biochemistry (1991) 195, 45-50]. The cliltivar lised was Fragaria X ananassa Ditch, cv. Elsanta. The cDNA library was prodliced as a clistom service by (Stratagene) in the lambda zap vector. Messenger RNA was isolated from total RNA lising the polyA+ isolation kit (Pharmacia).<br>
Mass Excision and Random Seqliencing<br>
The ExAssistTM/SOLRTM system (Stratagene) was lised for mass excision of the pBlliescript SK(-) phagemid. The excision was done according to the manlifactlirer instrlictions lising 20Î¼1--3pfli from the non-amplified library for each excision. High qliality plasmid DNA from randomly picked colonies was extracted lising the QIAGEN BioROBOT 9600. Colonies were grown overnight in 3ml Lliria Broth medilim (10g/l tryptone, 5 gA yeast extract, 5 g/1 NaCl) slipplemented with 100 mgA ampicillin, centrifliged at 3000 RPM for 10 min. and the pellet was lised directlf for plasmid DNA isolation by the robot. Each DNA isolation rolind consisted of 96 cliltlires.<br>
Insert size was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis after restriction enzyme digestion of the pBllieScript (SK-) vector with EcoRI and XhoL Inserts with length above 500 bp were lised for seqliencing. Plasmid DNA from the selected samples were lised for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) seqliencing reactions lising the ABI PRISMâ¢ Dye Terminator Cycle Seqliencing Ready Reaction Kit and the MJ Research PTC-200 DNA Engineâ¢ thermal cycler. The T3 and T7 liniversal primers<br><br>
were lised for seqliencing from the 5' and 3'ends respectively. PCR program was according to the Dye Terminator manlifactlire's protocol (ABI PRISM). The ABI 373, 370A and 310 seqliencers (Applied Bio-systems) were lised. Seqliences were edited manlially to remove vector and non reliable seqliences and slibmitted to the BLAST homology search (Altschlil et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215, 403 - 410, 1990) provided by the National Center for Biotechnological Information on the world wide web (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2e4740487f6e404d4c47004042430040474600494158">[email&#160;protected]</a>). Search was performed against ali non-redlindant data bases available by the program.<br>
Example 4. Cloning and Characterization of H64 Genes from Wild and Cliltivated Strawberry<br>
Cloning of the H64 cDNA from Cliltivated Strawberry (H64NORL) and its Homologlie from the Wild Strawberry (H64VES)<br>
We primarily identified the H64 cDNA olit of olir randomly seqlienced clones originating from the cliltivated strawberry cliltivar Elsant-a (ripe red frliit) cDNA library. Homology search reslilts lising the BLAST program indicated that the cDNA might encode a terpene synthase protein. The entire H64 cDNA is 1874 bp long [(termed H64 Normal Long (H64NORL)] and contains a open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 519 amino acids (aa) long protein [we termed the part of the cDNA forming the 519 aa ORF as H64 Normal Short (H64NORS), see Figlire 2].<br>
Cloning of the wild strawberry homolog of the cliltivated H64 cDNA was accomplished by the lise of the SMART RACE kit (Clontech) lising RNA from the Plant Research International collection of wild strawberries (line 92189). Oligonlicleotides primarily lised for seqliencing the H64NORL cDNA were lised for 3' RACE amplification (AAP291 - 5'- CTTCATGAGGTTGCACTTCG- 3' and the nested oligonlicleotide AAP 293 - 5'- AATGGTGGAAGGAGCTTGKIATTGG- 3'). The flill length wild strawberry cDNA [H64 Vesca (H64VES)] was obtained by designing an oligonlicleotide on the 3' lintranslated region (liTR) based on the 1000 bp fragment obtained in the 3' RACE and lising it to RACE for the 5' side (5' GTTCAACTCCACnTCCAGCAGTC 3'). The H64VES cDNA is 1894 bp long and contains a open reading frame encoding a 580 anlino acids (aa) long protein. Sixty<br><br>
one amino acids downstream of the first methionine residlie of the 580 aa protein we colild identify an additional methionine residlie. This 61 amino acids resemble the characteristic plastidic targeting signal of monoterpene synthases since it contains the two arginines motif and a large nlimber of serine residlies [Williams et al. (Biochemistry, 37 12213-12220, 1998); see Figlire 3A). The H64NORL and H64VES cDNAs share 96 % identity at the nlicleic acid level and if the stop codon is eliminated and the rest of the seqlience translated, 92.4 % at the amino acid level (from the ATG located at nlicleotide 145 lip to the end of the coding region). H64VES and H64NORS share 97.2 % identity at the nlicleic acid level and 94.2 % at the amino acid level (when the part starting from the beginning of H64NORS from H64NORVES is lised for the ahgnment lip to the end of the coding region).<br>
Analysis of H64 Expression Dliring Development, in Cliltivated and Wild Cliltivars and in Response to Alixin Treatment<br>
RNA gel blot analysis lising H64NORL as a probe revealed that it is lipreglilated dliring the cliltivated strawberry frliit ripening (Figlire 4). No expression colild be detected in the leaf and green frliit tisslies. H64 expression increased from the white to red stage of frxdt development. Analysis of H64 expression in ripe frmts of two wild and two cliltivated cliltivars showed that H64 is strongly expressed in the cliltivated cliltivars and hardly any expression colild be detected in the wild cliltivars (slight signal was detected in the wild cliltivars after long exposlire of the film, data not shown). Another RNA gel blot showed that H64 is repressed by alixin. This correlates with the fact that also other ripening lip-reglilated genes in strawberry are repressed by alixin.<br>
Site Directed Mlitagenesis of H64NORL<br>
A more thoroligh analysis of the H64 cDNA (termed H64NORL) revealed that it might contain an additional ATG start codon, 99 bp lipstream of the original ATG we identified (proposed to be the beginning of the ORF encoding the 519 aa H64NORS protein). The two ATG codons were located in frame blit no peptide colild be formed between them since a stop codon located 39 bp before the down stream ATG was evident. We slispected that the part between the two ATG is actlially part of the<br><br>
protein and for some reason it might be mlitated so a shorter protein starting for the downstream ATG might be formed. Additional slipport to this idea was the high ablindance of serine residlies identified in the translated area between the two ATGs. It resembled N-termini of other monoterpenoid synthases which contain relativelÎ³-high ablindance of serine residlies. We therefore employed site directed mlitagenesis in order to modify the stop codon and constrlict a non trlincated H64N0RL protein [termed H64 Mlitagenized (H64MliT)1. By changing the stop codon (TGA) into a lelicine residlie (CTA) the H64MliT cDNA is 1659 bp long containing a 552 aa long protein (see Figlire 3B). The site directed mlitagenesis was performed lising the QuikChange kit as described by the manlifactlirer (Stratagene). The ohgonlicleotide lised for the exchange was. 5' GGGAAGCAAGCTATCTAGAAAGTAGCAG-GCAATT-3'.<br>
PCR on Cliltivated Strawberry Genotnic DNA<br>
In order to verify whether the seqlience we obtained for H64NORL was not a PCR artifact and the stop codon between the two ATGs exists, we performed PCR on the cliltivated strawberry genomic DNA. We designed two ohgonlicleotides one lipstream the first ATG (5'- CTCCCACAGCTTCTTAGTTGC- 3') and the other downstream of the second ATG (the beginning of H64NORS) (5-<br>
CTAGCTCTGCTTACATTCCrrCAAGAC- 3'). Amplification with these two oligonlicleotides was expected to amplify a fragment of approximately 200 bp. We obtained two clear firagments of 300 bp and 400 bp each. Seqliencing folir clones of the 300 bp length firagments revealed them to be similar to the original Hâ¬4N0RL cDNA. Seqliencing and aligning 20 of the larger clones identified several isoforms which were different firom the original cliltivated H64NORL cDNA. Ali fi-agments (inclliding the short ones) contained an intron of approximately 100 bp. Fom' liniqlie different clones olit of the 20 seqlienced were identified. Two of them [SEQ6C(H64N0Rli1/W151) and SEQ7C(H64NORV2nJP3)] had an additional 20 aa (compared to H64MliT) blit still contained a stop codon located immediately at the beginning of the peptide they formed. Other two firagments<br>
[SEQ8C(H64N0Rli3/liP16) and SEQ9C(H64N0Rli4/liP1)] did not contain any stop codon and were most similar to the seqlience of H64VES. These fragments added 26<br><br>
aa to the H64MliT seqlience and they both contain the two arginine residlies as in H64VES which are most often folind in the plastidic targeting signal of monoterpene synthases (see Figlire 3A).<br>
Cloning H64MliT/H64NORS for Expression in E,coli<br>
The Exoli expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen) was lised for heterologolis expression of strawberry terpene synthases (see Figlire 5). The pRSETB vector contains the T7 promoter which can be indliced by isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and therefore by inserting the desired gene downstream of this promoter, the gene can be expressed in E. coll. In addition, DNA inserts were positioned downstream and in fi:ame with a seqlience that encodes an N-terminal flision peptide. This seqlience incllides (in 5' to 3' order from the N-terminal to C-terminal), an ATG translation initiation codon, a series of six histidine residlies that flinction as a metal binding domain in the translated protein, the Anti-Xpress epitope, and the enterokinase cleavage recognition seqlience.<br>
CP<br>
t&gt;<br>
The original pRSETB was primarily lised for the insertion of the gene encoding the Green Flliorescent Protein (GFP). The GFP gene was flised to the pRSETB vector lising the BamHI and Hindlll restriction sites located at the mliltiple cloning site (MCS) as can be seen in figlire 5. This constrlict for the expression of GFP served as control for the experiments together with the empty pRSETB vector. Cloning the GFP gene to the pRSETB vector inserted an additional Sail restriction site at the 3' of the GFP gene and together with the BamHI site located at the 5' of the GFP gene served as sites for cloning H64MliT- The BamHI and Sail sites were introdliced to the 5' and 3' respectively of the H64MIJT coding seqlience by the lise of PCR, The 552 amino acid open reading firame of the H64MliT clone was amplified with the pfli DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonlicleotides (containin the BamHI and SaII sites) AAP339 (5'- CGGATCCGGCATC-GTCTTCTCGGGC- 3') and AAP334 (5'- CGTCGACCAACTCCACTTCCGGTAGTC- 3') according to the manlifactlirers instrlictions. The PCR prodlict was cloned into PCR-script vector (Stxatagene), clit olit with BamHI and Sall and flirther inserted (as a translation flision) into the corresponding restriction sites in the pRSETB vector. H64NORS was cloned in a similar way.<br><br>
Bacterial Expression and Partial Plirification lising the His tag Collimns. The pRSETB vector harboring the H64MliT or H64NORS was lised to transform E. coli strain BL21 Gold DE3 pLysE (Stratagene) as described by the manlifactlirer. For bacterial expression typically 1 ml of overnight liqliid cliltlire gi'own at 37Â°C in Lliria Broth (LB) medilim (lOgA tryptone, 5 gfl yeast extract, 5 gA NaCl) slipplemented with 100 mgfl ampicillin was dillited 50 times in the same medilim and grown lintil the OD600 reached 0.4 (at 37o C). At this stage IPTG was added to a final concentration of ImM in order to indlice expression . After overnight growth at 16Â°C the cells were harvested by centrifligation at 4000 x g for 15 min. Pellet and a sample from the slipernatant were kept for SDS gel analysis. The cells were flirther processed as described by the Ni-NTA Spin Collimns manlifactlirers (QIAGEN) for protein plirification linder native conditions. First ellite from the collimn (200 fil) was flirther lised for enzymatic activity assays.<br>
Example 5. Cloning and Characterization of SOS Genes from Wild and Cliltivated Strawberry<br>
Cloning of the SOS cDNA from Cliltivated Strawberry (SOSA) and its hom,olog from the Wlid Strawberry (SOSV)<br>
For cloning the SOSA(MA) cDNA from the cliltivated strawberry CV Elsanta, we designed an oligonlicleotide on a pliblished seqlience of a sesqliiterpene cyclase fi-om the wild strawberry (Nam et al. Plant MoL Biol. 39: 629-636, 1999). The oligonlicleotide (AAP 272, 5'- GATGATATGTATGATGCATTCGG- SO was lised to perform a 3' RACE reaction lising the RACE kit (Clontech) and a 991 bp fi-agment was cloned. For cloning the flill length cDNA we performed a 5' RACE reaction lising an oligonlicleotide designed on the 3' liTR of the cDNA (AAP283, 5'-GAAAGGATAGGCTCATCAGTACGTG- 3'). The entire S0SA(1^IA) cDNA cloned is 2605 bp long. We however colild not identify an ORF encoding a protein longer then 255 aa, which is less then a half of a tjqpical terpene synthase. Therefor a second attempt to clone a cDNA with a longer ORF was performed. lising oligonlicleotides based on the SOSA(MA) seqlience, one located on the beginning of the ORF (AAP325,<br><br>
5'- CGGATCCGCCTGTCCATGCTACTCC" 3') and the other on the liTR (AAP341, 5'-CGTCGACTGAGTTCAGAGTGGCACTGG- 3'), a second full-length SOSA cDNA was isolated by the means of PCR on the cliltivated strawberry cDNA [termed SOSA(WS)]. Seqliencing SOSA(WS) revealed that as for SOSA(MA) it contains a trlincated ORF. We decided to clone the flill length SOS homolog from the wild strawberry in order to identify the calise for slich a trlincation in the cliltivated genes ORF. Cloning of the wild SOS homolog was performed by 3' RACE reaction lising an ohgonlicleotide designed on the SOSA(MA) ORF (AAP325, see above). The flili length SOS homolog from the wild strawberry (SOSV) is 1973 bp long and contains a ORF encoding a 556 aa long protein. Aligning SOSA(MA), SOSA(WS) and SOSV nlicleic acid seqliences revealed minor changes in the ORF (see Figlire 6). We colild however identify the basis of the trlincation in the cliltivated SOS genes which was an insertion of two cytosine nlicleotides calising a frame shift followed by a stop codon (see Figlire 6). Removing the CC insertion from the SOSA(WS) and SOSA(MA) genes reslilts in the formation of ORFs encoding 554 and 555 aa respectively (Figlire 7).<br>
PCR on Cliltivated and Wild Strawberry Genomic DNA<br>
In order to confirm the presence of the CC frame shift, calising a trlincation in the cliltivated strawberry SOS genes we analyzed the existence of the insertion at the DNA level PCR on both wild and cliltivated strawberry genomic DNA was performed lising two oligonlicleotides located from both sides of the place of insertion (AAP345, 5'- AGAGGTTAGKJTGCrrCCJGCGTTAC- Z') and the reverse ohgonlicleotide, AAP346, 5' GAACAACTCCACGATCCTrATCrrC- 3^. The expected amplified DNA Segment was 200 bp. PCR prodlicts at the size of 300 bp were obtained from both reactions lising the wild and cliltivated DNA We seqlienced 20 and 15 fragments from the cliltivated and wild strawberry reactions respectively. AH fragments contained an intron of approximately 100 bp. Seqlience alignment of all fragments revealed 7 different seqliences from the cliltivated and 5 from the wild. Figlire 8 shows an alignment of all fragments of the SOS genes both from the wild and cliltivated strawberry obtained either from RNA (the different cDNAs) or from DNA. Among the cxiltivated fragments we colild identify 2 fragments which showed the CC insertion while the other 5 did<br><br>
not contain it. On the other hand no fragment in the wild strawberry colild be detected that contained the frame shift mlitation.<br>
Analysis of SOS Expression in Ripe Cliltivated and Wild Strawberry Frliit lising the SOSV cDNA as a probe we analyzed SOS gene expression in two different wild and cliltivated cliltivars (Figlire 9). The SOSV cDNA colild be lised for hybridization with blots containing RNA from both wild and cliltivated cliltivars since the SOSA genes and SOSV share nearly 99 % identity at the nlicleic acid level (in the ORF region). Hardly any expression colild be detected in the cliltivated cliltivars while strong expression colild be detected in the wild cliltivars. The SOSA probe was also lised for hybridizing blots with RNA extracted from different cliltivated (Elsanta) frliit developmental stages, blit jlist weak signal colild be detected after long exposlire. Nam et al., (1999) were also not able to detect expression of the partial cDNA homolog of SOS with RNA derived from different frliit developmental stages of the cliltivated strawberry. Expression in different wild strawberry plant tisslies was restricted to the frliit, specifically to the red ripe stage.<br>
Cloning and Expression of SOSV and SOSA in E.coli<br>
Both the SOSA and SOSV coding regions were lised for the formation of a recombinant protein in E,Coli cells. The entire ORF of SOSA cDNA altholigh trlincated was expressed in order to serve as a negative control for the enz3rmatic assays. Similar to the cloning of H64MliT the BamHIand Sail restriction sites at the 5' and 3'of the GFP gene respectively served as sites for the cloning of SOSA and SOSV ORFs into the pRSETB expression vector. The BamHI and SaZI sites were introdliced to the 5' and 3* respectively of the wild and cliltivated SOS genes coding seqlience by the lise of PCR. The restriction sites were added to the oligonlicleotides lised for PCR reaction (AAP325, 5^ CGGATCCGCCTGTCCATGCTACTCC- 3' and the reverse primer AAP341, 5'- CGTCGACTGAGTTCAGAGTGGCACTGG- 3'). The PCR prodlict was cloned into PCR-script vector (Stratagene), clit olit with BamHIand Sail and flirther inserted (as a translation flision) into the corresponding restriction sites in the pRSETB vector. Expression of SOSA and SOSV in E. Call was performed parallel to the expression of H64MliT and linder identical experimental conditions.<br><br>
Example 6. Analysis of SOSA, SOSV, H64MliT and H64NORS recombinant enzymes<br>
For determination of terpene synthase identity, the His-tag plirified enzymes (prepared as described above linder Example 4.6) were dillited 10-fold with bliffer A containing 15 mM MOPSO (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCb, 1 mM sodilim ascorbate and 2 mM DTT. To 1 mL of this enzyme preparation, 40Î¼M of either PH]-geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or pH]-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) were added. Assays with GPP as slibstrate were also slipplemented with 1 mM MnCl2. After the addition of a 1-mL redistilled pentane overlay, the tlibes were careflilly mixed and inclibated for 1 h at 30oC. After the assay, the tlibes were vortexed, the pentane layer was removed and passed over a short collimn of alliminlim oxide overlaid with anhydrolis Na2SO4. The assay was re-extracted with I mL of diethyl ether, which was also passed over the alliminlim oxide collimn, and the collimn washed with 1.5 mL of diethyl ether. 100 jiL of the organic exrtract was removed for liqliid-scintillation colinting in 4.5 mL of scintillation cocktail (liltima Gold. Packard Bioscience. The Netherlands). Radio-labelled prodlicts were present in the organic extracts of:<br>
H64MliT	H64NORS	SOSV	SOSA<br>
____	^	^	^<br>
PHl-FPP	+	+	-	,<br>
Slibseqliently, the extracts were carefidly concentrated linder a stream of No before analysis lising radio-GLC and GC-MS. Radio-GLC was performed on a Carlo-Erba 4160 Series gas chromatograph eqliipped with a RAGÎ±-90 radioactivity detector (Raytest, Stralibenhardt, (Germany). Sample components elliting from the collimn were qliantitatively redliced before radioactivity measlirement by passage throligh a conversion reactor filled with platinlim chips at 800Â°C. Samples of 1Î¼L were injected in the cold on-collimn mode. The collimn was a flised silica capillary (30 m x 0.32 mm i'd.) coated with a film of 0.25 fim of polyethylene glycol (EconoCap EC-WAX, Alltech Associates) and operated with a He-flow of 1.2 mL min-1. The oven temperatlire was<br><br>
programmed to 70oC for 1 min, followed by a ramp of 5Â° min-1  to 210oC and a final time of 10 min. Abolit 20% of the collimn effllient was split with an adjlistable splitter to an FID (temperatlire 270oC). The remainder was directed to the conversion reactor and radio detector. H2 was added prior to the reactor at 3 mL min-1, and CH4 as a qliench gas prior to the radioactivity detector (5 mL colinting tlibe) to give a total flow of 36 mL min-1,  Radio-GLC analysis gave the following reslilts: -     the SOSV and H64MliT and H64NORS recombinant proteins catalysed the<br>
formation of radio-labelled prodlicts from PH]-GPP (Fig 10). For the SOSV protein a nlimber of radio-labelled prodlict peaks were visible in the retention time area of olefinic monoterpenes (Fig. lOB). The major radio-labelled prodlict did not co-ellite with any of the added linlabelled reference compolinds, blit one of the minor radio-labelled peaks seemed to co-ellite with the reference Î²-myrcene. For the H64MliT recombinant enzyme the single radio-labelled prodlict co-ellited with linalool (Fig. 100).<br>
with PH]-FPP as slibstrate scintillation colinting showed that neither the SOS A nor the SOSV recombinant protein catalysed any radio-labelled prodlict formation. The H64MliT protein catalysed the formation of a radio-labelled prodlict which radio-GC analysis showed to be one single prodlict, co-elliting with traas-nerolidol (Fig. 11). The samples were also analysed by GC-MS lising a HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph eqliipped with an HP5-MS collimn (30 m x 0.25 mm Ld., 0.25 Î¼m di) and HP 5972A Mass Selective Detector (Hewlett-Packard). The oven was programmed at an initial temperatlire of 45Â°C for 1 min, with a ramp of 10Â°C min-1  to 280Â°C and final time of 5 min. The injection port (splitless mode), interface and MS solirce temperatlires were 250, 290 and 180Â°C, respectively, and the He inlet presslire was controlled by electronic presslire control to achieve a constant collimn flow of 1.0 mL min-1 Ionization potential was set at 70 eV, and scanning was performed from 48-250 amli. The m/z 93 chromatogram of SOSV recombinant protein catalysed prodlicts from PH]-GPP again shows several peaks (Fig. 12) as was also seen in the radio-GC chromatogram (Fig. lOB). The compolinds were identified as Î±-pinene (major compolind), fi-pinene, sabinene, Î²-myrcene, Î±-phellandrene, 6-pheliandrene, dihydromyrcenol (tentative), Î±-terpinolene (tentative) and Î±-terpineol (tentative).<br><br>
This shows that SOSV is not a sesqliiterpene synthase as is claimed for a fragment nlicleic acid isolated by Nam et al (Plant Mol Biol, 39: 1999-2002, 1999) and Marty (EMBL Database, Accession nlimber AJ001452), blit a monoterpene synthase, viz. an Î±-pinene synthase. Nam et al and Marty had isolated jlist a fragment of the cDNA and for example missed the 5'-side. Hence, the alithors were also not able to flinctionally express the protein and identified it wrongly as a sesqliiterpene synthase. The GC-MS chromatograms of the inclibations of the H64MliT protein with [3H]-GPP or PH]-FPP show the presence of one terpene prodlict for each slibstrate and comparison of the retention times and mass spectra with alithentic standards confirmed that from PHJ-OPP hnalool was prodliced (Fig. 13) and from PHJ-FPF trans-nerolidol (Fig. 14). Analysis lising enantioselective collimns showed that both hnalool and nerolidol were of the S configliration, so (3S)-(E-nerolidol and S-linalool. Characterisation. The H64N0RS encoded and his-tag plirified protein was shown to have an optimlim pH of arolind 7 for both GPP and FPP/For both slibstrates there was no preference for Mn-1  (at 1 mM) or Mg2+ (at 10 mM) and therefore a combination of the two was rolitinely lised. The affinity of the enzyme for the two slibstrates strongly differed. The Ivm for FPP was 3.2 ^.M which is in the expected range for sesqliiterpene synthases. However, for GPP the Km was &gt;50 jiM which is highly linlislial. However, the apparent Vraax for GPP was mlich higher than for FPP.<br>
Example 7. Analysis of targeting<br>
We lised transient expression assays lising the Green Flliorescent Protein (GFP) to identify the sliÎ²-celililar localization of the proteins encoded by the different nlicleic acid fragments described in this invention (Fig. 15). We first constrlicted 13 different constrlicts which flised in-frame the 5'-end parts of the different genes (H64N0RL, H64NORS, H64TAR4, H64VES, SOSV) to the GFP gene (Fig. 16). Different regions of the 5'-ends were lised part of them incllided a portion firom the protein itself (lip to the MID motif). Expression in plants was driven by the 35S caliliflower mosaic virlis promoter. Plasmid DNA firom constrlicts was lised to transform tobacco protoplasts. After transformation the protoplasts were inclibated for 24 hr at 28Â°C in the dark and thereafter lised for the analysis of GFP transient expression and slibcelllilar<br><br>
localization lising confocal laser scanning microscopy. The reslilts demonstrated that the 5'-ends of both H64TAR4 and H64VES encode a targeting signal (Fig. 15). The protein encoded by H64TAR4 is targeted to the plastids (e.g. chloroplasts) and mitochondria while the H64VES protein is targeted to the plastids (e.g. chloroplast3). H64NORL and H64NORS, which are most active in the ripe cliltivated strawberry, are targeted to the cytosol. SOSV is also targeted to the cytosol, in-contrast to all monoterpene synthases described to date which are plastid localized. Thlis, according to this experiment for monoterpene synthases the cytosol and not only the plastids arc a possible location and in the cytosol there are high levels of GPP to synthesize the monoterpenes. For sesqliiterpene synthases normally reported to be localized in the cytosol other sliÎ²-celllilar localization may be possible slich as in the mitochondria and chloroplasts and they may lise FPP in these compartments and prodlice high levels of the sesqliiterpene. We also demonstrated by the same method that the different targeting signals of the terpene synthases colild be easily swapped by the lise of site-directed mlitagenesis. For example the plastidic targeting signal encoded by the H64VES N-terminal part colild be modified to dlial targeting to mitochondria and chloroplasts by a change in 2 amino acid residlies (Tryptophan-W6 changed to Arginine-R6 and deletion of Isolelicine-116).<br>
Example 8. Effects of neroiidol on Agrobacterilim tlimefaciens FPP, the preclirsor for sesqliiterpene biosynthesis is a most common metabolite and exists in every living organism. Thlis, the expression of a protein encoding a neroiidol synthase will resvdt in the conversion of endogenolis FPP to neroiidol in most living organisms. We constrlicted a binary vector (plasmid lised for the transformation of plants celis, which lacks the virlilent genes present on the Ti plasmid of the virlilent strain oi Agrobacterilim tlimefaciens) containing the H64NORS gene flanked by a 35S Ca]\W promoter (5'-end) and a Nopaline Synthase (NOS) terminator (3'-end) and lised it to transform 2 different strains of Agrobacterilim. In both cases no colonies were obtained after plating the transformation reaction on Lmia Broth (LB) medilim containing 50 mg/1 kanamycin and Rifampicin. Thlis, the H64 NORS gene was expressed in Agrobacterilim and the protein encoded by it converted the bacterial endogenolis FPP to neroiidol, which is highly toxic to the Agrobacterilim cells, and<br><br>
therefore no transformants were obtained. Thlis, transgenic plants expressing a nerolidol synthase will have an anti-microbial effect and colild be lised for the protection against Agrobacterilitn crown-gall disease. In order to be able to introdlice a plasmid containing slich a terpene synthase having toxic effects on the bacteria one can introdlice one or more introns into the coding seqlience of the gene. These introns can not be spliced by the bacteria and hence no flinctional protein is formed by the micro-organism. In the plant, the normal elikaryotic splicing process will lead to a flinctional protein. The introdliction of sliitable, organ-specific and/or indlicible promoters in the appropriate constrlict wlil allow the directed expression of hnalool and/or nerolidol at the appropriate site to control crown-gali disease in plants slich as frliits, rose, etc. Also, slow release formlilations or other compositions containing linalool and/or nerolidol may be liseflil to control crown-gall disease.<br>
Example 9. Effects of linalool and nerolidol on spore germination, lesion growth and sporlilation of Phytophthora infestans, Flisarilim spp. and Botrytis spp.<br>
Comparison of effects of farnesol and linalool on mycelilim growth of Phytophthora infestans on growth medilim<br>
Farnesol and linalool were tested in two concentrations (2% and 0.2% (v/v)) throligh the addition to PKch medilim in 6 well plates (3 ml per well). One 6 well plate per compolind was lised with two different concentrations in triplicate. All welis were inoclilated with a pllig ol Phytophthora infestans mycelilim (isolate VK98014, 1 month old) and inclibated at 20Â°C. On day 3, 5 and 7 the radial growth of the mycelilim was measlired. An overview of the reslilts is given in Figlire 17. The mycelilim growth oi Phytophthora infestans was inhibited completely 3, 5 and 7 days after the experiment by both the high and the low concentrations of linalool. Farnesol reslilted in a partial inhibition of mycelilim growth at both the high and the low concentration. The experiment demonstrates that linalool is more active than farnesol for the inhibition of mycelilim growth of Phytophthora infestans.<br><br>
Comparison of the effects of linalool and nerolidol on mycelilim growth of Phytophthora infestans alone and in combination on growth medilim Linalool and nerolidol were tested in three concentrations (0,2%, 0.02% and 0.002% (v/v)) throligh the addition to Plich medilim in 6 well plates (3 ml per well). One 6 well plate per compolind was lised with two different concentrations in triplicate. To stlidy whether the compolinds acted directly or throligh the vapolir phase in one plate mycelia were grown on control medilim with the compolinds (0.2%) added to the medilim in the adjacent wells. Free exchange of the compolinds throligh the vapolir phase was possible this way. All wells were inoclilated with a pllig of Phytophthora infestans mycelilim (isolate VK98014, 1 week old) and inclibated at 20Â°C. On day 3 and 5 the radial growth of the mycelilim was measlired. The reslilts are shown in Figlires 18-21.<br>
Figlire 18 shows that linalool is active even at the lowest concentration of 0.002% (=20 ppra). Remarkably, the effects of linalool are eqlially effective throligh the vapolir phase as throligh the medilim. Apparently this monoterpene is so volatile that the active concentrations in the vapolir and medilim phase are similar. This high activity in the vapolir phase makes linalool an attractive compolind for the protection of stored prodlicts against micro-organisms e.g. the protection of potato to Phytophthora, Phoma, and Flisarilim.<br>
Figlire 19 shows that nerohdol is slightly more effective than linalool (compare Figlire 18) in inhibiting Phytophthora infestans mycelilim growth and that it is a strong inhibitor of mycelilim growth even at the lowest concentration of 20 ppm. In contrast to linalool the effects throligh the vapolir phase are negligible. This can be explained by the fact that the sesqliiterpene nerolidol is mlich less volatile than the monoterpene linalool.<br>
Figlires 20 and 21 show that the action of linalool and nerolidol is stronger in combination than when taken alone. This sliggests that the simliltaneolis prodliction of these compolinds in plants colild reslilt in more effective flingal control compared to a sitliation when only one of the tw o compolinds is present.<br><br>
The effect of nerolidol infiltrated in potato leaves on the germination of Phytophthora infestans spores, lesion formation and sporlilation.<br>
Leaves of potato cliltivar Bintje wei'e vaclilim-infiltrated with a 0.05% (v/v) sollition of nerolidol. This was done by placing 6 leaflets at a time in a 50 ml blliecap with the nerolidol sollition or a water control. The tlibes were placed for 15-30 min linder vaclilim which was then sliddenly released. Good infiltration was visible by the dark green color of the leaves. The leaves had gained abolit 25% weight this way so that the actlial concentration in the leaves was in the range of ca. 0.0125%. The leaves were placed on water agar (1.5%) and inoclilated with 250-500 spores of the 4 different Phytophthora infestans isolates (race-0, IPO-c, 428-2, VK98014). The leaves were inclibated one night in the dark at 15-Â°C and then moved to normal lighting conditions (15'C, 16h light, 8h dark). After 7 days the leaves were scored for the formation of lesions and sporlilation. The reslilts demonstrate that also when infiltrated in potato leaves nerolidol strongly inhibits mycelilira growth, lesion formation and sporlilation at a low concentration. The effects appear to be not race-specific blit eqlially affecting the folir different isolates showing that also nerolidol provides broad resistance against this flinglis.<br>
Effects of linalool and nerolidol on Flisarilim and Botrytis mycelial growth Flisarilim. Nerolidol and linalool were tested in a range of concentrations (10-5000 ppm) alone and in combination throligh the addition to Plich medilim in 6 well plates (3 ml per well). In the case of comparing the application of nerolidol and linalool alone to the combination of the two compounds, 100 ppm of the single compolind was for example compared to 50 + 50 ppm of the two compolinds together. One 6 well plate per compolind was lised with two different concentrations in triplicate. All wells were inoclilated with a mycelilim pllig of Flisarilim graminearlim, Flisarilim clilmorlini or F.verticillioides strain MRC826 and inclibated at 20Â°C. Each day the radial growth of the mycelilim was measlired. The reslilts of day 7 are given in Figlire 22. The mycelimn growth of all Flisarilim spp, was inhibited at concentrations above 10 ppm. At low concentrations nerolidol was slightly more effective than linalool in the case F. graminearlim and MRC826, At very high concentrations linalool was more effective.<br><br>
The combined lise of nerolidol and linalool is at least as effective as either individlial compolind and appears to provide a more roblist inhibition against all Flisarilim species.<br>
Botrytis. Nerolidol and linalool were tested in a range of concentrations (10-5000 ppm) alone and in combination throligh the addition to Plich medilim in 6 well plates (3 ml per well). In the case of comparing the application of nerolidol and linalool alone to the combination of the two compolinds, 100 ppm of the single compolind was for example compared to 50 + 50 ppm of the two compolinds together. One 6 well plate per compolind was lised with two different concentrations in triplicate. All welis were inoclilated with a mycelilim pllig of Botrytis cinerea isolated from grape and strawberry and inclibated at 20Â°C. Each day the radial growth of the mycelilim was measlired. The reslilts of day 7 are given in Figlire 23. The mycelilim growth of all Botiytis isolates was inhibited at concentrations above 10 ppra. At low concentrations nerolidol was more effective than linalool. At very high concentrations linalool or the combination of linalool and nerolidol was most effective. The combined lise of nerolidol and linalool is at least as effective as either individlial compolind and appears to provide the most roblist inhibition against all Botrytis isolates.<br>
Effects of linalool and nerolidol on Flisarilim spore germination. A spectrophotometric assay was lised to monitor the onset of germination of Flisarilim verticillioides spores (isolates: ITEM2282, MRC3235. MRC826, MRC826-2) in sollition. The spores were dillited to a concentration of 10 spores/ml in Czapek Dox medilim and mixed with 8-4000 ppm of linalool or nerolidol. Linalool did not affect the germination of the spores at ali (Figlire 24B). Nerolidol, however, showed strong inhibition of germination at concentrations above 250 ppm (Figlire 24A). This sliggests that nerolidol provides an additional mode of control of Flisarilim verticillioides at the level of spore germination in comparison to linalool and that for the most effective control at all stages of flingal development of Flisarilim spp a combined lise of nerolidol and linalool is most appropriate.<br><br>
Example 10. Transformation and characterization of Arabidopsis, potato, tomato and petlinia<br>
Preparation of constrlicts for the transformation of plants.<br>
Constrlicts with the H64 cDNAs are prepared for the transformation of plants in<br>
order to yield plants that will prodlice linalool and/or nerolidol in variliolis<br>
compartments:<br>
The cDNAs are placed linder the control of either the 35S promoter or the Rlibisco<br>
promoter, both separately and in combination in order to obtain plants prodlicing<br>
linalool or nerolidol alone or in combination. It is also contemplated that for some<br>
plirposes glycosylation or deglycosylation of the terpene-alcohol is reqliired for the<br>
mode of action against flingi or insects. For this reason also constrlicts are made<br>
containing glycosyl-transferases or glycosidases in conjlinction with the Hnalool<br>
and/or nerolidol synthase cDNAs.<br>
Constrliction of binary vectors.<br>
The appropriate seqliences were ligated into a pFlaplO vector. The ligation prodlict was transformed to E.coli DH5a competent cells, and transformed colonies were grown 0/N at 37**C and 250 rpm. The expression cassette was removed from the reslilting vector by lising Pad and Ascl restriction enzymes (NEB, England) and ligated into the binary vector pBINPLliS, containing a kanamycin resistance selection marker (nptll), after digestion with Pad and Ascl. Colonies were checked after transformation by back-transformation to E. coli DH5a competent cells.<br>
Transformation of Arabidopsis<br>
We lised the floral-dip transformation method to transform Arabidopsis plants ecotype Collimbia according to Marsh-Martinez et al. (2002). After collecting the seeds they were let to dry for several days and then sown on MS medilim containing<br><br>
50 mg/1 kanamycin and 400 mg/1 cefotaxime. Green shoots, 1 cm m size were transferred to the green holise and grown to matlirity.<br>
Transformation of potato<br>
On day 1 an Agrobacterilim twnefaciens cliltlire of AGLO containing a BINPLliS derived binary vector was started in 50 ml LÎ²-medilim containing 50 mgA kanamycin and shaken for 2 days at 28 oC. On day 2 internodes from an in vitro cliltlire of the potato cliltivar Desiree were clit into 0.5-1 cm pieces and placed on R3B medilim (30 g/l slicrose, 4.7 gA Mlirashige and Skoog salts, pH 5.8 (KOH), 8 gfl plirified agar, 2 mg/1 NAA and 1 mgA BAP) which was covered with 2 sterile filterpapers that had previolisly been soaked in 2 ml PACM medilim (30 g/1 slicrose, 4.7 gA Mlirashige and Skoog salts, 2 gA casein hydrolysate, pH 6.5 (KOH), 1 mg/ml 2,4-D and 0.5 mgA kinetine). The dishes were taped with parafilm and inclibated overnight at 24 oC linder a regime of 16 h light. At day 3 the A. tlimefaciens cliltlire was polired in a sterile petridish containing the explants. After 5-10 min explants are removed from the cliltlii'e, placed on a sterile filter paper to remove excess Agrobacteria and placed back on the R3B medilim containing dishes after first removing the top filter paper (leaving one behind). Dishes with explants were flirther inclibated at 24 oC and 16 h Light lintil day 5, when the explants were transferred to dishes containing ZCMv medilim (20 gA slicrose, 4.7 gA Mlirashige and Skoog salts. pH 5.8 (KOH), 8 gA plirified agar, 1 mgA zeatine, 200 mgA vancomycin, 100 mgA kanamycin, 200 mgA claforan). On day 19 and slibseqliently every 3-4 weeks explants were transferred to new ZCVK medilim. When shoots appeared shoots were transferred to Mlirashige and Skoog medilim containing 20% slicrose (MS20). After rooting plants were transferred to the green holise<br>
Petlinia transformation.<br>
Leaf clittings of Petlinia W115 were transformed with Agrobacterilim tlimefaciens strain LBA4404 lising a standard plant transformation protocol (Liicker et al., The Plant Jolirnal 27: 315-324, 2001). As a control leaf clittings were also transformed with LBA4404 containing the pBINPLliS vector. Flirthermore some non-transformed leaf clittings were carried throligh the regeneration process. Rooting plants, arising<br><br>
from the Agrohacterilim transformation were tested with PCR for the presence of the respective gene constrlict. Positive plants were transferred to the greenholise. All ransgenic plants were phenotypically normal and showed a normal development compared with non-transformed control plants, which had gone throligh the same regeneration process.<br>
Tomato transformation.<br>
The tomato cliltivar Micro-Tom' {Lycopersicon flavolir) was lised (Scott and Harbaligh, 1989). The plants were grown from seeds provided by a seed company (Beekenkamp seed, Holland). Micro-Tom seeds were first sterilised. A rinse in 70% ethanol followed by a two holir bleaching in 1.5% HC104. After bleaching, the seeds were qliickly rinsed in water twice and then washed in water for ten and sixty minlites. After sterilisation, seeds were sowed in pots, containing 80ml vermiclilite and 70ml of germination medilim containing 4.4gA MS salts with vitamins and 0.5% slicrose (pH 5.8).<br>
After 7 days of growth in a cliltlire room (25Â°C), covered with 2 folds of filter paper, the cotyledons were clit linder water near the petiole and the tip with a rolling action of the scalpel, to minimize damage. The explants were placed on their backs on filter paper on feederlayers to inclibate overnight in the cliltlire room (25Â°C). covered with 4 folds of filter paper, linder low light conditions. After inclibation, the explants wex-e immersed in the Agrobacterilim slispension for 20 minlites. After immersion, the explants were placed back on feederlayers for co-cliltivation, following a rinse in a sollition containing 400mg/l carbenicillin and 100mg/1 tricarcillin. The explants were placed in calllis indlicing mediimi (4.4gA MS salts with Nitsch vitamins, 3% slicrose, 0.8% plirified agar (Oxoid), pH 6.0, 2mg/l zeatin, 400mgA carbenicillin, 100mg/1 tricarcillin, 100mgA kanamycin). Tlie plates were covered with 2 folds of filter paper and set to grow in a cliltlire room (25Â°C) linder low light conditions for 3 weeks. Formed calllis was transferred to shoot indlicing medilim (as calllis indlicing medilim, blit with lmg/1 zeatin, 200mg/l carbenicillin, 50mgA tricarcillin). These plates were set to grow linder the same conditions as the calllis-indlicing plates. Shoots formed were transferred to rooting medilim in pots (4.4g/l MS salts with Nitsch vitamins, 3% slicrose, 0.5% agargel (Sigma), pH 6.0, 0.25mg/l IBA,<br><br>
50mgA kanamycin, 400mgA carbenicillin. The growing conditions remained the same. FliliÎ³-grown plants were slibseqliently transferred to the greenholise.<br>
Analysis of the transgenic plants with capillary gas chromatographÎ³- mass spectrometry (GC-MS).<br>
The tisslies to be analyzed were collected in the greenholise and frozen in liqliid nitrogen. In general, 200mg frozen material was homogenized and transferred to a mortar containing I.5mL 5M CaCl2 and a small amolint of plirified sea sand. These tisslies were mixed with 0.75 mL 5M CaCb. The material was grolind rapidly and thorolighly with a pestle, inhibiting enzymatic reactions. 0.75 mL of the material was introdliced into a 1.8 mL GC vial containing a small magnetic stirrer. The vial was then closed with an alliminlim cap with a PTFE/Blitylrlibber septlim. Slibseqliently the vial was placed in a 50Â°C waterbath and preheated for 20 minlites while stirring. The headspace sampled dliring 30 minlites with a 100Î¼ PDMS SPME fiber (Slipelco, Belfonte PA USA).<br>
GC-MS analysis was performed lising a Fisons 8060 gas chromatograph directly colipled to a MD 800 mass spectrophotometer (Interscience, Breda, the Netherlands). A HP-5 collimn (50 ra x 0.32 mm, film thickness 1.05Î¼m) was lised with He (37 kPa) as carrier gas. GC oven temperatlire was programmed as follows: 2 min 80Â°C, ramp to 250Â°C  at 8Â° min'1 and 5 min 250Â°C. Mass spectra in the electron impact mode were generated at 70 eV. The compolinds were identified by comparison of GC retention indices and mass spectra with those of alithentic reference compolinds. Injection was performed by thermal desorption of the SPME fiber in the injector at 250Â°C dliring 1 min lising the splitless injection mode with the split valve being opened after 60 sec. Alternatively, volatiles were trapped on cartridges containing Tenax, ellited lising pentane/ether and analysed lising GC-MS essentially as described by Boliwmeester et al (1998). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing H64TAR, for example, prodliced large amounts of linalool and smaller amolints of nerolidol (Figlire 25). Transgenic potato lines also prodliced slibstantial amolints of linalool, blit also the hydroxÎ³-derivative 8-hydroxylinalool (Figure 26). Interestingly, the native linalool of potato, which can also be detected, had a different stereochemistry as the transgenic linalool (Fig. 26), which allowed a clear distinction between native and transgenic prodlict.<br><br>
Becalise it was slispected that in some of the plant species these compolinds were present in a bolind form, leaf material of Petlinia (transgenic and control samples) was harvested and frozen in liqliid nitrogen, and grolind to a fine powder in a cooled mortar and pestle. In total 60 mg of the powdered leaf material was transferred to 0.5 ml of citrate bliffer at pH 4.5, to which 140 i.li. fi-gllicosidase were added. The vial was capped and inclibated dliring 12 h at 25Â°C. Slibseqliently, the headspace of the vial was sampled dliring 30 minlites with 100 micron PDMS solid phase microextraction device and analysed lising GC-MS as described above. No linalool or nerolidol was detectable in samples from the lintransformed control plants, whereas in the transgenic plants both linalool and nerolidol were detected. The sample of transgenic leaf material witholit betÎ±-gllicosidase present dliring the inclibation did not show any detectable linalool or nerolidol, indicating that ali Linalool and nerolidol is stored in the petlinia leaves in the form of its gllicoside, instead of continliolis emission as was described for linalool in the flowers of Clarkia brewerL<br>
Identification of glycosides in transgenic plants<br>
High-performance-liqliid-chromatography electrospraÎ³-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS) analysis of methanol extracts was performed on a triple stage qliadrlipole TSQ 7000 LC-MS-MS system with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). The temperatlire of the heated capillary was 240 Â°C. The ESI capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV, reslilting in a 3.4 Î¼A clirrent. Nitrogen served as both the sheath (70 psi) and alixiliary gas (10 L/min). Data acqliisition and evalliation were carried olit on a Personal DECstation 5000/33 (Digital Eqliipment, linterfohring, Germany) and ICIS 8.1 software (Finnigan MAT). HPLC separation was carried olit on an Elirospher 100 C-18 collimn (100 x 2 mm, 5m, Knalier, Berlin, Germany) lising a linear gradient with a flow rate of 200Î¼L min-1 Solvent A was 5 mM ammonilim acetate in water, and solvent B was 5 mM ammonilim acetate in methanol. The gradient program was as foliows: 0-30 min 5 to 100% B.Mass spectra were acqliired in the negative mode. Prodlict ion spectra were available by collision-indliced dissociation (CID) (1.5 mTorr of Argon; -20 eV). For preparation of extracts plant leaves (3 to 7 g) were homogenized in 50 ml of 80% methanol and centrifliged (2000 g for 5 min). The residlie was washed with 50 ml of 80% methanol and the slipematants were combined. Methanol was removed in<br><br>
vaclilim and the remaining aqlieolis sollition was extracted with 2 x 20 ml diethyl ether. The extract was slibjected to XAD-2 (20 cm, 1 cm inner diameter) solid phase extraction. The collimn was sliccessively washed with 50 ml water and 50 ml diethyl ether. Glycosides were elated with 80 ml methanol. The extract was concentrated in vaclilim. The residlie was dissolved in 1 ml of 50% methanol in water and analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.<br>
R,S-Linalyl Î²-D-gllicopyranoside was synthesized from R,S-hnalool and 2,3,4,6-tetrÎ±-O-acetyl-betÎ±-D-gllicopyxanosyl bromide according to a modified Koenigs-Knorr synthesis. For enzymatic hydrolysis an aliqliot of the methanol extract was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.2 M phosphate bliffer (pH 5.5), and 200 Î¼l of Rohapect DSL (Rohm, Darmstadt, Germany), a pectinolytic enzyme preparation exhibiting glycosidase activity was added. After an inclibation period of 24 h at 37Î¼, the liberated aglycons were extracted two times by 1 ml of diethyl ether each. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. Mliltidimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (MDGC-MS) analyses were performed with tandem Fison 8160 GC connected to a Fison 8130 GC and a Fisons MD 800 qliadrlipole mass spectrometer eqliipped with Fisons MassLab software (Version 1.3). The first GC was fitted with a split injector (1:10, at 230o'C) and a flame ionization detector (at 250Â°C). The first GC employed a 25 m x 0.25 mm i.d. flised silica capillary collimn coated with a 0.25Î¼m film of DÎ²-Wax 20 M (J &amp; W Scientific) for the pre-separation of the target moleclile. Separation of enantiomers was achieved with the second GC lising a 25 m x 0.25 mm i.d. flised silica capillary collimn coated with a 0.15 jxm film of 2,3-di-O-ethyl-6-O-tert. Blityl dimethylsnyl-D-cyclodextrin/PS086. The collimn in GCl was coimected by a mlilticollimn switching system (Fisons) to the collimn in GC2. The retention time of the compolind of interest was determined by GC separation while the collimn in GCl was connected to the FID. Separation of the enantiomers was achieved in the second GC after transfer of the compolind of interest from the capillary collimn in GCl to the collimn in GC2 via the switching device. The flised silica capillary collimn in GCl was maintained at 60Â°C then programmed to 240Â°C at 10Â°C min-1 with He gas flow at 3 ml min-1, The flised sOica capillary collimn in GC2 was maintained at 60oC (15 min) then programmed to 200Â°C at 2Â°C min-1 with He gas flow at 3 ml min-1. The compolind of interest was transferred from GCl to GC2 from<br><br>
9.8 min to 10.3 min. The MS operating parameters were ionization voltage, 70 eV (electron impact ionization); ion solirce and interface temperatlire, 230oC and 240Â°C, respectively. Linalyl-Î²-D-gllicopyranoside was synthesised in order to verify the identity of the glycoside present in the transgenic petlinia tisslie transformed with S-linalool synthase. HPLC-MS/MS analysis on control and transgenic Petlinia tisslie as shown in Figlire 28, revealed that the m/z 375 ion trace (Figlire 27A) of the compolind detected in the transgenic Petlinia tisslie had the same retention time as one of the two diastereomers of (R,S)-hnalyl 13-D-gllicoside that are slightly resolved in ion trace A. Also the prodlict ion spectrlim of the synthesised reference compolind fits the spectrlim of the peak detected in the transgenic petlinia tisslie nicely (Figlire 28B). The control Petlinia tisslie ion trace m/z 375 showed only a slight elevation above backgrolind level at the retention time of the linalyl Î²-D-gllicoside indicating that there is also a basal level of linalyl-Î²-D-gllicoside present in the plant before transformation (Figlire 28A). Following Chiral phase Mliltidimensional Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (MDGC-MS) analysis, after enzymatic hydrolysis of the gllicoside fraction of leaf tisslie, revealed that the transgenic Petlinia leaf contains highly enriched (S)-linalyl-6-D-gllicoside. The control plant however contains shghtly enriched (fl)-linalyl-Î²-D-gllicoside. Since no tisslie-specific promoter for expression was lised, the enzyme can be formed in all plant organs and will give a prodlict in all cells where GPP is present. By the action of a highly active endogenolis gllicosyltransferase of Petlinia that is able to efficiently bind the S-linalool prodliced by the transgenic plants as (S)-linalyl-Î²-D-gllicoside, celllilar damage is prevented. Slich a highly active glycosyltransferase was also reported in transgenic Kiwi frliit expressing stilbene synthase, that acclimlilated picied (resveratrol-gllicoside) in stead of resveratrol. Large-scale volatilisation of linalool from the transgenic plants colild be excllided, since only traces of linalool were detectable when the headspace of the transformed plants was analysed. Volatilisation only occlirred from the flowers and not from leaves. This in contrast to Arabidopsis where large amolints of linalool were emitted from the leaves (Figlire 25). Therefore we concllide that most of the linalool in Pettmia is directly bolind as a Î²-D-gllicoside.<br><br>
Flirther analysis of potato-leaf extracts also showed the presence of gllicosides, not only of linalool itself blit also of 8-hydroxylinalool. In addition, more derivatives of linalool were folind slich as linalool-triol, inclliding the corresponding gllicoside (Table 1).<br>
In concllision, transgenic plants expressing the inserted transgenes are shown to prodlice the expected terpenoid compolinds. Their amolints, release, oxidation to polyols, and derivatization to glycosides vary from species to species and can be infllienced by the co-expression of other seqliences (see Example 11). When these compolinds are not stored in any bolind intermediates slich as glycosides, the plants have altered olfactory characteristics.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 11. Effects of changes in targeting of terpenoid and GPP and FPP synthases<br>
Example 10 shows that we are able to prodlice large amolints of monoterpenes in a range of different species, and that it is not necessary to introdlice a GPP synthase linlike was claimed in WO 0022150. However, the prodliction of sesqliiterpenes in transgenic plants proved difficlilt, as has been reported by several other alithors (Wallaart et al., Planta 212: 460-465, 2001; Hohn and Ohlrogge, Plant Physiol 97: 460-462. 1991).<br>
Therefore, the effect of introdlicing an additional gene encoding an FPP synthase to wild-type plants or plants which already over-express a sesqliiterpene synthase on sesqliiterpene prodliction was examined lising Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Collimbia). Two genes were introdliced in two ways, either by co-transformation of two binary vectors harboring the different genes or by retransforming a plant already transformed with a single gene, and selecting on a new selectable marker (hygromycin instead of kanamycin that was lised in the fii'st gene transformation). Single genes incllided an FPP synthase from strawberry encoding a cytosolic protein (FPPS), FPP synthase with a plastid targeting signal (TARFPPS) and a germacrene A sjTithase gene (GERA, sesqliiterpene synthase) that was isolated from chicory (PCT/EP 0002130), Co-transformation was performed with the following combinations of genes:<br>
1.	FPPS and a plastid localized H64NORS (H64TAR)<br>
2.	TARFPPS and H64TAE<br>
3.	FPPS and H64NORS (cytosohc)<br>
4.	FPPS and GERA.<br>
To prevent problems with the introdliction of the H64N0RS containing plasmid to Agrobacterilim (see Example 8) we introdliced an intron to the H 64NORS gene which can not be processed by the bacteria blit can be processed by the plant. The combination of cytosolic FPP synthase and a plastidic sesqliiterpene synthase was performed in order to check whether the pool of FPP in the plastids can be increased by transport from the cytosol to the plastids. A nlimber of selfed progeny lines of a<br><br>
high linalool and nerolidol prodlicing line dlie to the introdliction ot a plastidic H64NORS (H64TAR) were also co-transformed with the FPPS and TARFPPS genes. GC-MS analysis of the reslilting trangenic plants showed that the co-expression of a cytosolic FPP synthase and cytosolic sesqliiterpene synthase greatly enhances the prodliction of the sesqliiterpenes nerolidol (combination 3) and germacrene A (combination 4). Also, overexpvession of a cytosolic FPP synthase did enhance nerolidol prodliction in case of thie plastid-targeted H64NORS (combination 1). Co-expression of an FPP synthase and H64N0RS in the plastids (combination 2) did reslilt in appreciable levels of both linalool and nerolidol. This shows that it is possible to boost (transgenic) sesqliiterpene biosynthesis in the cytosol by enhancing slibstrate availability and that it is possible to direct sesqliiterpene biosynthesis to other compartmments than the cytosol.<br>
Example 12, Transgenic plants with improved biological control of pests<br>
Linalool and nerolidol, and its derivative 4,8-dimethyr-l,3(E).7-nonatriene have been reported to play an important role in the attraction of predators of a variety of insect and spider mite pests by a large nlimber of crops. The seqliences described in the present invention can be lised as markers for the selection of crop species, slich as for example maize, cotton, apple, and cliclimber, and any other crops employing this indirect defense mechanism, with improved prodliction of volatile, predator attracting, compolinds in response to feeding pests. In addition, the present invention can be lised to make transgenic plants with improved signalling capacity. Hereto the DNA seqliences are placed linder the control of an indlicible promoter, slich as wolind-indlicible or specific indlicible promoters. The latter type of promoters are isolated from plants that were fed lipon by for example spider mites or insects. Spider mite indlicible promoters can for example be isolated from cliclimber or lima bean. These plant species have been shown to strongly react to spider mite feeding with the prodliction of volatile signaling compolinds (Boliwmeester et al., 1999). Slibtractive (lip- and down-reglilated) libraries are made from non-infested (control) and infested plant material lising the PCR-Selectâ¢ cDNA Slibtraction Kit (Clontech). and the expression of the cDNAs in these slibtractive libraries checked lising cDNA micro-<br><br>
array technology (see for example Aharoni et al., 2000) lising mRNA from control, spider-mite infested and JÎ±-treated plant materials as probes for hybridisation. Reglilated cDNAs will be seqlienced, and BLASTed to hint their identity. The flill-length cDNAs of interesting, strongly reglilated genes are obtained lising the RACE PCR technology, or by screening a cDNA library. The interesting flill-length cDNAs are characterised for their expression profile and lising heterologolis expression or model plant transformation. Promoters of strongly (lip-)reglilated genes are isolated lising the Genome Walkerâ¢ kit (Clontech).<br>
As mentioned above the DNA seqliences from the invention are placed linder the control of wolind-indlicible or the isolated sliitable (tisslie-) specific (indlicible) promoters and lised for transformation of crops in which biological control is enabled by the prodliction of indlicible volatile signaliing compolinds, slich as cliclimber, maize and cotton, lising pliblished protocols. Transformation of cliclimber is carried olit lising a protocol for gene transfer and regeneration of cliclimber as developed by a Dlitch seed company.<br>
The altered response of the transgenic plants is determined lising jasmonic acid treated and spider mite or beet army worm infested transgenic and control plants. Volatile prodliction is determined lising headspace trapping and GC-MS analysis (Boliwmeester et al., 1999). The response of the respective predators is determined lising behavioliral stlidies lising a Î³-tlibe olfactometer (e.g. Takabayashi et al., J. Chem. EcoL 20(2). 373-385,1994). The transgenic Arabidopsis from Example 10 was shown to prodlice large amovmts of linalool and smaller amolints of nerolidoL In a Î³-tlibe experiment, starved predatory mites (Phytoseilillis persimilis) were shown to strongly prefer the linalool/nerolidol prodlicing plants: 70% of the tested predatory mites preferred the transgenic Arabidopsis above the wild type.<br>
Example 13. Effects of linalool and nerolidol expression on resistance to micro-organisms<br>
Several plant species expressing the H64NORS gene and prodlicing elevated levels of linalool and nerolidol were analyzed for resistance to microbial infections of powdery mildew and Phytophthora infestans. Clear effects were observed on leaves and frliits<br><br>
showing that the in vitro data presented in Example 7 are predictive of the in vivo data in transgenic plants.<br>
Petlinia and powdery mildew<br>
Transformed tomato plants (control (empty vector) and transgenic homozygolis for the trait) were grown from seed in a small greenholise linder identical controlled conditions (n=30). The plants were inoclilated with powdery mildew (Erysiphe cichoracearlim) spores. After 4 weeks plants were scored for infection. The reslilts indicate that the the presence of linalool protected the plants from infection by mildew (Table 2).<br><br>
Tomato and Phytophthora infestans<br>
Green firliits were harvested from variolis homozygolis transgenic Microtom tomato lines. Earlier these lines had been characterized for linsdool content by steam destination and GC-MS. Ten different berries from each transgenic line were inoclilated by pricking the top of the frliit with a tooth pick dipped in a slispension of 10,000 sporangia/ml of Phytophthora infestans IP0428-2. After 7 days the frliits were scored for infection level (Table 3). Nearly all diseased frliits had tlirned completely grey/black jlist below the skin. Frliits were scored clean if they had no infection at ali. A strong correlation was observed between a high linalool expression level and a low percentage of diseased berries. The transgenic frliits with high linalool levels largely remained free of infection<br><br><br>
Potato and Phytoohthora infestans<br>
Transgenic potato lines expressing the H64NORS gene in two different constrlicts (H64NOR and H64TAR) were analyzed for prodliction of linalool and nerolidol in the headspace lising an SPME fiber and GC-MS. The H64NOR constrlict did not yield nerolidol or linalool prodliction above the backgrolind present in potato, while the H64TAR constrlict gave very high levels of linalool and low levels nerolidol in the headspace. Both sets of plants were tested for Phytophthora infestans resistance by inoclilating 5 detached leaves in 2 replicates with spore slispensions and scoring lesion area, lesion growth and sporlilation (Table 4). A very strong correlation was observed between high linalool expression levels and strongly repressed or absent lesion growth and sporlilation.<br><br><br>
per leaf (IP0428-2, 50.000 sporangia/ml) and scored for lesion area, growth and sporlilation (vislial score on a scale of 0-4) at the indicated days post infection (dpi)<br>
Figlire 30 combines the data of table 1 and 4. Figlires 30 A, B and C provide the correlation in lesion size, lesion growth rate, and sporlilation respectively of Phytophthora infestans isolate IPO 428-2 plotted against the content of linalool, 8-hydroxylinalool, linalooltriol. lynalylgllicoside, 8-hydroxylinalylgllicoside and linalyltriolgllicoside content of the potato transgenic lines T or TM-9, -13, -29 and a control line. The control data from table 4 on flingal growth and sporlilation were taken to be the average vallies of the H64NOR plants (Mines) with negligible increased levels of either linalool, nerolidol or derivatives. The linalool (derivative) data provided in table 1 sire known to the art to be mlich more reliable and qliantitative than the SPME data on linalool in table 4, which jlistifies their preferred<br><br>
lise. Figlire 30 demonstrates a strong dose-effect correlation of the levels of linalool (derivatives) prodliced in potato to the levels of resistance. With high levels of terpene expression clearly complete resistance to Phytophthora infestans infection was obtained. Flirthermore, figlire 30 D provides the in vitro data on the sensitivity of Phytophthora infestans isolate IP0428-2 which was lised for the in planta experiments to plire hnalool in the medilim as described in Example 9. From the comparison of the in vitro data with the in planta data of Figlire 30 it is clear that the qliantities prodliced in planta are in the same range as the qliantities reqliired in vitro to affect the mycehal growth. It is not clear, however, whether the natlirally formed alcohol and gllicoside derivatives of linalool are similarly active to inhibit flingal growth as the free linderived linalool forms and may contriblite to the effect of free linalool in a major way.<br>
Example 14. Effect of linalool and nerolidol expression on insect resistance<br>
Arabidopsis thaliana and Myzlis persicae<br>
A line of Arabidopsis tllixliana transformed with the H64TAR constrlict was characterized to have a single gene insertion by Solithern blot, high headspace levels of hnalool and lower headspace levels of nerolidol (Example 10). This line was selected and selfed. Selfed seeds were sown and yoling, non-flowering plants were analysed for levels of linalool in the headspace lising SPME GC-MS analysis (Example 10). Homo- and heterozygolis plants with high levels of linalool were lised in a bioassay with Myzlis persicae female adlilts to observe repellent or deterrent effects of linalool expression (Table 5), For each experiment two leaves were taken from the plant, one from a control and one from a linalool plant and embedded next to each other in gelling wateragar of a small petridish. Ten adlilt females were placed on the inside of the lid of the petridish. After preset times the nlimber of adlilts on each of the leaves was recorded. A deterrent effect was visible over time. Initially the aphids did not display any preference blit after 2 days a very significant distriblition was observed in which 62% were on control plants and 38% were on hnalool plants. This indicates that linalool and  for nerohdol are potential insect deterrents or repellents in plants that can express high levels of these compolinds.<br><br>
