Intermediates for the preparation of citalopram and escitalopram<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of intermediates used in the manufacture of the antidepressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1^4-fluoiophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years. Citalopram has the following structure (I):<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally active serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, e.g. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-PsychopharmacoL &amp; Biol Psychiat, 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand, 1987, 75,478-486.<br>
Citalopram may be prepared by the process described in US 4,650,884, according to which 5-cyanophthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fiuorophenyl magnesium halogenide and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively, and the resulting compound of the Formula (II) is subjected to a ring closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid.<br><br><br>
Enantiomers of citalopram may be prepared by the method described in US 4,943,590, i.e. by separating the enantiomers of the intermediate of Formula (II) and performing enantioselective ring closure in order to obtain the desired enantiomer.<br>
Thus, 5-cyanophthalide is an important intermediate for the manufacture of citalopram and escitalopram and it is important to produce this material in an adequate quality, by a convenient process and in a cost-effective way.<br>
A method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide has previously been described in Tirouflet, Bull. Soc. Sci. Bretagne, 26, 1951, 35 and in Levy and Stephen, J. Chem. Soc, 1931,867.<br>
WO 00/39112 describes a method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide from 5-carboxyphthalide in which 5-carboxyphthalide is treated with an alcohol R-OH in the presence of an acid to produce an ester corresponding to the compound of Formula (HI), i.e. R3 corresponding to R; R is disclosed as Ci-6-alkyl or phenyl.<br><br>
In WO 00/39112 Ci-e alkyl is defined as referring to a branched or unbranched alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-l-ethyl and 2-methyl-1-propyl. In WO 00/39112 is also disclosed the preparation of 5-ethoxycarbonyl-<br><br>
phthalid by suspension of 5-carboxyphthalide in ethanol, addition of POCI3 followed by heating to reflux temperature for 5 hours. The precipitate was filtered of and washed with ethanol. Similarly, 5-ethoxycaibonylphthalid was prepared by suspension of 5-chlorocarbonylphthalid in ethanol, heating of the mixture to reflux for 15 minutes, followed by cooling, filtration and washing the collected precipitate with ethanol.<br><br>
Finally, in WO 00/39112 the amide of Formula (IV) is reacted with a dehydrating agent, e.g. SOCI2, thereby obtaining 5-cyanophthalide having the Formula (V).<br><br>
JP 62185070 A2 describes use of phthalimides for treatment of angina pectoris.<br>
A further method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide from 5-carboxyphthalide is described in WO 00/044738. Reference is also made to WO 98/19513 and WO 98/19511 describing methods for the preparation of citalopram.<br>
The preparation of 5-carboxyphthalide of Formula (VI) from terephthalic acid of Formula (VII) is described in, e.g., US 6,403,813, US 6,458,973, US 3,607,884 and by Forney, L.S, J. Org. Chem. 1970,35, p. 1695-1696.<br><br>
Accordingly, US 3,607,884 discloses a method of producing 5-carboxyphthalide by reaction of terephthalic acid with formaldehyde and SO3, followed by addition of water. US 3,607,884 also discloses a reaction of formaldehyde with terephthalic acid and SO3 which is cooled down and poured into alcohol (e.g. methanol or ethanol); it is stated that thereby the corresponding ester of 5-carboxypthaIide is produced and that this ester subsequently can be converted to 5-carboxyphthalide. Forney, L.S, J. Org. Chem. 1970, 35, p. 1695-1696 and US 3,607,884 further discloses the preparation of 5-methoxycarbonylphtalide and 5-ethoxycarbonylphtalide by esterification of 5-carboxyphthalide. Another method is described by Anzalone L. and Hirsch J.A , J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 2128-2133 in which an ester substituted phthalide is prepared from diethyl 2-methylterepthalate.<br>
Forney, L.S, J. Org. Chem. 1970, 35, p. 1695-1696 discloses a reaction of terephthalic acid (Formula VII), trioxane, and sulfuric acid by heating to 150 °C for 2 hours in a sealed glass tube; the tube was chilled and opened and the content poured into methanol, concentrated, poured into water, and extracted into dichloromethane. The yield of this reaction is disclosed as 83.2% dimethyl terephthalate and 1.1% 5-methoxycarbonylphtalide.<br>
Furthermore, a reaction of oleum, terephthalic acid and formaldehyde is also disclosed in Forney, L.S, J. Org. Chem. 1971, 36, p. 689-693. W09916743 discloses compounds with alkoxycarbonyl groups, among which are compounds corresponding to formula DDL<br>
Sugimori, A. and Yashima, T, Chemistry Letters, 1980, 483-486, describes gamma-radiation of aromatic carboxylic esters in alcohol solutions, exemplified by radiation of dimethyl terephthalate. In this connection is disclosed a formula corresponding to the compound of formula (III) wherein R3 is methyl. Similarly, Anzalone L. and<br><br>
Hirsch J. A., J. Org. Chem 1985,2128-2133 describes the preparation of a compound corresponding to formula (EI) wherein R3 is ethyl from diethyl 2-methylterepthtalate.<br>
One aspect of the invention provides a new method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide without the need for 5-carboxyphthalide.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As indicated above the inventors have simplified the known process for the production of 5-cyanophthalide which is an intermediate in the manufacturing of the medicaments citalopram and escitalopram. Instead of producing 5-carboxyphthalide as done previously, the inventors have now provided a method for the manufacturing of alkoxycarbonylphtalides which are very suitable for the downstream production of citalopram/escitalopram and their intermediates. The developed method is suitable for large scale production and the alkoxycaibonylphtalides are obtained in high purity and in high yields. In further aspects, the inventors have provided improved manufacturing conditions for the production of intermediates suitable for the manufacturing of citalopram or escitalopram. In preferred embodiments of the invention, alkoxycaibonylphtalides are provided as disclosed herein with improved filtration properties, in particular as compared to 5-carboxyphthalide. In further embodiments, alkoxycaibonylphtalides are provided as disclosed herein with improved solubility properties, in particular as compared to 5-carboxyphthalide.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for preparing an alkoxycabonylphtalide of formula (IQ)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compound of formula (VHI) may be purchased from commercial sources or it may be prepared by any suitable methods known by the person skilled in the art, cf. e.g. J. Chem. Soc; 77; 1900; 278. For example terephthalic acid - i.e. formula (Vm), wherein R and R are H - is commercial available and can be prepared by several known methods, such as by catalytic oxidation of p-xylene. Terephthalic acid can be<br><br>
converted into esters of formula (VIE) wherein Rl and R2 are independently selected from Cj-6-alkyl by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a broad aspect, the invention relates to use of a compound of formula (VDla) in all the methods of the invention as disclosed herein such that the compound of formula fVIIIa) replaces the compound of formula Vm.<br>
  dently from the group consisting of: OH, a Ci-6-alkoxy, a halogen (such as CI, Br, I), and NR; wherein R is H or a Ci-6-alkyL It is understood that the C1-6-alkyl part of the Ci-6-alkoxy in this context may be as indicated herein for Rl and R2 in formula (VIII). Evidently, when X and Y is selected independently from OH and a Ci-6alkoxy then formula (VlUa) is identical to formula (VIII) as described herein<br>
Accordingly, it is within the scope of invention to use terephthaloyl dichloride (formula B) instead of the compound of formula (VIE) in any of the processes of the invention as described herein. Terephthaloyl dichloride is commercial available.<br><br><br>
Those skilled in the art will know how to manufacture compounds of formula (VIET) wherein R1 and R2 are Ci-e-alkyl form e.g. terephthalic acid or terephthaloyl dichloride by conventional methods.<br>
The inventors have found that terephthaloyl dihalides, especially terephthaloyl dichloride have a better solubility in oleum than terephthalic acid. Additionally, the reaction mixture derived from this starting material, i.e. during step (a) as disclosed herein, has good properties for production at industrial scale. For example the foam is considerably reduced when using terephthaloyl dichloride as starting material as compared to a similar process using terephthalic acid. Also when using terephthaloyl dichloride as starting material the reaction mixture of step (a) may be cooled down to room temparture before the addition of the alcohol, whereas usually this step is performed at higher temperatures when using terephthalic acid as starting material.<br>
Accordingly, in further embodiments, the reaction mixture of step (a) is cooled down to a temperature of less than 40 °C, such as less than 35 °C, less than 30 °C, e.g. in the range 15-30 °C, such as 18-30 °C or 18-25 °C, preferably at room temperature, before the addition of the alcohol.<br>
Accordingly, within the invention is a method as described herein, in which step (b) is perfoimed at temperatures less than 40 °C, such as less than 35 °C, less than 30 °C, e.g. in the range 15-30 °C, such as about 18-30 °C or 18-25 °C, preferably at room temperature.<br>
Oleum is also named fuming sulfuring acid, i.e. sulfuric acid containing SO3. The oleum used may be commercially available oleum, e.g. the following are available from Aldrich/Fluka: 12-17% SO3 (Fuming sulfuric acid)=15% oleum; 18-24% SO3 (Fuming sulfuric acid)=20% oleum; 27-33% SO3 (Fuming sulfuric acid)=30% oleum.<br>
) In preferred embodiments of the invention, the oleum contains at least 15% SO3, e.g. in the range of 15-65% S03; such as 12-17% S03; 16-18% SO3, e.g. below 20%, but preferably higher than 14%. In further embodiments it is preferred that the oleum contains at least 20% SO3, e.g. in the range of 20-40%; 22-33% or 25-30%. The<br><br>
percentages is meant to indicate the SO3 content as present, i.e. e.g. 15% oleum in the "12-17%" S03 (Fuming sulfuric acid) described above.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, in step (a) is used an oleum as described herein in amounts of 1-8 1 per kg of formula (VIE), such as 1.5-6 1/Kg; 1.5-4 1/Kg; 1.5*3.5 1/kg, preferably in the range of 1.5-3.5 1/kg. Preferably, in step (a) 1-2.5, such as 1-2 or 1.25-1.75, equivalents SO3 per equivalent of the compound of formula (VIII) are used.<br>
Preferably no filtration step is performed between step (a) and (b). Accordingly, within the invention are also embodiments as described herein where the product mixture of step (a) is not subjected to an isolation procedure before the addition of the alcohol in step (b). Furthennore, in one embodiment, the reaction in step (a) and/or (b) is not performed in a sealed container, in particular not in a sealed glass tube.<br>
The reaction in step (a) is preferably performed at elevated temperatures, e.g. at a temperature in the range of 115 °C - 175 °C; 120 °C - 165 QC; 115 °C - 150 °C; 115 °C - 145 °C, preferably 120 °C - 140 °C. In further embodiments of the invention, step (a) is performed at a relatively high temperature, preferably at a temperature from about 145 °C, e.g. in the range of 150 °C - 175 °C, such as 150 °C -160 °C. Within the invention is also embodiments where in step (a) a solution of the compound of formula (VHI) in oleum is heated to a temperature as described above before the addition of the formaldehyde, preferably paraformaldehyde in oleum, cf. Example 6.<br>
When using an oleum having a lower S03 content, e.g. less than 20% SO3 (e.g. in the range of 16-19% SO3 or 16-18% SO3), the temperature in step (a) is conveniently relatively high, such as at a temperature from about 145 °C, e.g. in the range of 150 °C - 175 °C, such as 150 °C - 160 °C. When using an oleum having a relatively high SO3 content, e.g. at and above 20% SO3 (e.g. in the range of in the range of 20 -40%; 22 - 33% or 25 - 30% S03) the temperature in step (a) is conveniently relatively lower, such as at a temperature in the range of 115 °C - 145 °C; 120 °C - 145 °C; or 120°C-140°C.<br><br>
The duration of the reaction in step (a), i.e. before the addition of the alcohol in step (b) should be sufficient to allow the desired reaction to proceed. Preferably, the reaction in step (a) is performed for at least 1 hour, preferably in the range of 1-24 hours, e.g. 2-18 hours, 2-10 hours, and preferably 2-5 hours.<br>
Step (b) is preferably performed at a temperature below the boiling point of the alcohol. When the alcohol used for quenching is n-butanol, then during step (b) the temperature is preferably in the range of 60-110 °C, such as 70-110 °C preferably in the range of 75 °C- 100 °C, or 75 °C-85 °C.<br>
After quenching the reaction in step (b) with an alcohol, the reaction is preferably cooled down to a lower temperature to assist the crystallization, e.g. down to a temperature less than 40 °C.<br>
Preferably the alkoxycarbonylphtalide of step (b) is subjected to isolation procedures, preferably to obtain an essentially isolated product The alkoxycarbonylphtalide may be isolated by filtration, or in alternative by decanting. Thus, preferably, the method of the invention comprises collecting the alkoxycarbonylphtalide by filtration. The alkoxycarbonylphtalide produced in a process of the invention may also be further purified by washing, e.g. in alcohol and/or water followed by additional filtration to collect the product. In further embodiments, the method of the invention comprises purification of the alkoxycarbonylphtalide by addition of an organic solvent (e.g. toluene, optionally in combination with a higher alkane, such as heptane) and aqueous solvent (preferably water) thereby extracting the alkoxycarbonylphtalide into the organic phase, preferably followed by collecting the extracted alkoxycarbonylphtalide by filtration. Accordingly, in further embodiments the method of the invention comprises purifying the alkoxycarbonylphtalide, e.g. butoxycarbonylphtalide, by dissolution in a mixture of toluene and heptanes; precipitation by cooling; filtration, and then drying the resulting product. The method of the invention may also comprise a step of addition of NaOH to a pH of about 4 to remove unreacted phthalic acid followed by filtration. Further purification may, if desired, be performed by recrystallisation, e.g. in a mixture of toluene and heptanes or in methanol.<br><br>
Diphthalide (Formula A) impurities may be formed by this type of reaction starting from the compound of formula (Vm).<br><br>
The diphthalide impurity is preferably removed. This is advantageously done by dissolving the crude alkoxycarbonylphtalide, e.g. butoxycaibonylphtalide, product in a mixture of toluene and heptanes (e.g. two volumes of toluene and two of heptanes per amount of crude butoxycarbonylphtalide); heating the mixture to 80 °C; treating with activated carbon and a filter aid, such as dicalite, and performing a pressure filtration at this temperature; cooling the resulting mixture to 25 °C over a period of 5 hours; keep at 25 °C for 2 hours before the purified product is filtered off. The described purification method is able to reduce the diphthalide level in the crude product from over 5% to less than 03% in the purified product. One further advantage of preparing a carboalkoxyphtahlide of formula (HI) instead of 5-carboxyphthalide for the subsequent production of citalopram /escitalopram is that the product purified with respect to diphthalide impurities is precipitated from an organic solvent which make it easier to dry than the 5-carboxyphthalide product obtained from aqueous solution when removing diphthalide impurities from crude 5-carboxyphthalide.<br>
It is further preferred that the alkoxycarbonylphtalide produced by a method of the invention is dried, i.e. subjected to a drying procedure lowering the liquid content, i.e. of the precipitate preferably collected by filtration. The product prepared by a process of the invention is preferably in the form of powder which expression refer to a collection of essentially dry particles, i.e. the moisture content being below about 10% by weight, preferably below 8% by weight, such as below 6% by weight, 4% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the alkoxycarbonylphtalide product produced by a method of the invention as described herein has a purity of at least 20%, preferably at least 50%, e.g. at least<br><br>
75%, at least 85%, or at least 90% as measured by HPLC. The alkoxycarbonylphtalide product produced by a method of the invention preferably has a purity of less than 99%, or less than 98%, less than 95%, such as less than 90% pure as measured by HPLC. In other embodiments, the alkoxycarbonylphtalide product prepared by a method of the invention has a purity between 80-99%, such as 90-98%, e.g. 95-98% or 80-95%,<br>
The alkoxycarbonylphtalide product of the invention is conveniently used for the production of 5-cyanophthalide. Thus, the alkoxycarbonylphtalide product of the invention may be converted to the amid of formula (IV), wherein R is H or Ci^alkyl, bv amidation with ammonia or a G-fi-alkylamine. e.g„ t-butvl amine.<br>
The amide of Formula (IV) may then be reacted with a dehydrating agent, e.g. SOCI2, to obtain the 5-cyanophthalide.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to methods for the synthesis of 5-cyanophthalide starting from a alkoxycarbonylphtalide prepared by a method of the invention, i.e. in particular within the scope of the invention are embodiments where R\R2andR3 are as defined above. Thus, in particularly preferred embodiments R3 is a C3-6-alkyl; R3 is a G3-6-alkyl; or is R3 is a C4-alkyl, preferably n-butyl. Likewise, within the scope of the invention is also a method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide comprising a method as described herein for preparing an alkoxycarbonylphtalide of formula (ID). Within the scope of the invention are also methods for the synthesis of citalopram or escitalopram comprising a method of the invention i for the synthesis of 5-cyanophthalide. As indicated above it is of significant value that the present invention provides a process for preparing intermediates like 5-cyanophtahlide comprising one step less as compared to the known process of preparing 5-cyanophtahlide through 5-carboxyphthlide.<br><br>
Accordingly, in further aspects, the invention relates to a method for the synthesis of citalopram or escitalopram from the alkoxycarbonylphtalide of formula (EI) as defined herein, in particular where the alkoxycarbonylphtalide has been prepared by a method as disclosed herein, i.e. within the scope of the invention is embodiments where R1, R2 and R3 are as defined herein. In particularly preferred embodiment, R3 is<br><br>
As mentioned above citalopram is the racemate, whereas escitalopram is the S-enantiomer form essentially without the R-enatiomer form. Escitalopram* may be prepared by the method described in US 4,943,590, i.e. by separating the enantiomers of the intermediate of Formula (II) and performing enantioselective ring closure in order to obtain the desired enantiomer.<br>
In a broad aspect the invention relates to use of a method as disclosed herein for the preparation of a medicament, such as but not limited to, citalopram or escitalopram.<br>
The inventors have found that dialkyl terephthalate, such as dimethyl-, and diethyl terephthalate and terephthaloyl dihalides such as terephthaloyl dichloride (formula B) is more soluble in oleum than terephthalic acid. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, R1 and R2 of formula (Vm) is not hydrogen; likewise X and Y of formula (Villa) are not OH.<br>
The inventors have also found that the n-butyl ester of formula IH (i.e. R3 = n-butyl) has better filtration properties and is more soluble than 5-carboxyphthalide. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, an ester having one or more of such characteristics are used as starting material for the production of citalopram or escitalopram, advantageously trough the intermediate 5-cyanophthalide as described herein. Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for preparing an 1 intermediate suitable for the synthesis of citalopram or escitalopram, said method comprising the steps of: (i)       preparing a alkoxycarbonylphtalide of formula (HI),<br><br><br>
The alkoxycarbonylphtalide in step (i) may be prepared by any of the methods<br>
described herein, i.e. with step (a) and (b); or, e.g., by a method comprising the step<br>
of:<br>
