				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to communications and telecommunicated devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for a voice controlled device capable of translating native language phrases into a predetermined set of foreign language phrases.<br>
II.	Description of the Related Art<br>
For an individual traveling in a foreign country the inability to effectively communicate in the local language can present serious difficulties. Of course, the best solution is for the individual to become proficient in the foreign language. However, this is not always possible. Individuals that are on vacation travel may often spend very little time in a foreign country. It is unreasonable to expect a vacation traveler to become proficient in one or several foreign languages for the limited purpose of a one time vacation trip. Similarly, a business traveler may be required on short notice to travel to foreign locations for limited amounts of time.<br>
The foreign traveler has a limited number of solutions available that will help to bridge the communication gap. The traveler can attempt to learn key phrases prior to the trip. This solution is extremely helpful provided the traveler is able to recall the phrases at the required moment in time. The communication difficulties persist when the traveler is unable to recall the proper phrase. Problems with recall are further compounded when the traveler passes through multiple regions, each require a different foreign language.<br>
Another popular solution bridging the commemoration gap is the foreign language phrase book. When a foreign phrase is required the traveler looks in the phrase book for the translation then speaks the phrase. The problem inherent in this solution is the time required to look up a particular phrase. However, the time delay in looking up a phrase is preferable to the inability to communicate. The phrase book is a likely companion solution to learning a predetermined small set of foreign phrases.<br><br>
The advancement in digital processing power makes it possible to integrate highly complicated tasks into portable devices. The development of tile wireless phone is a demonstration of the effective integration of advanced processing power into a user friendly portable device.<br>
Modem wireless phones integrate numerous complicated signal processing tasks within a form factor small enough to be carried in a shirt pocket. Numerous features are implemented into wireless phones for the user"s convenience. The features are accessed by using the phone keypad in conjunction with the display to navigate through a series of menu options. The different manta provide a convenient hierarchical method of categorizing the various features. Some wireless phones implement a voice recognition feature. Voice recognition allows the user to operate the phone using a predetermined set of voice commands. This allows the user to activate features without manually navigating menus. However, the phone is also configured such that the menus can be navigated using voice commands. Features accessible using voice commands include called number dialing, number storage in an electronic phone book, number retrieval from an electronic phone book based upon a name, and incoming call answering.<br>
Two forms of voice recognition exist. The two forms are speaker dependent voice recognition and speaker independent voice recognition. Speaker independent voice recognition requires more processing time and requires a larger voice database. Speaker dependent voice recognition minimizes the processing time and voice database size by comparing voice inputs with the speaker"s voice samples. In speaker dependent voice recognition the user mist enter a training menu and run a training routine prior to using the voice recognition function. In the training routine the user is required to voice a predetermined command vocabulary to allow the voice recognition feature to learn to recognize user voice commands. Once the predetermined vocabulary is trained, the user is" able to utilize the voice<br>
recognition feature.<br>
The voice recognition feature of the wireless phone allows for useful possibilities beyond phone menu navigation. However, the capabilities of voice recognition and signal processing are not limitless.<br>
What is required is a foreign phrase translator that is portable and can provide nearly instantaneous access and   of retie language phrases into foreign language phrases. This device could serve as a back up solution to learning a small set of foreign language phrases or could provide a primary"<br><br>
communication solution to the traveler that knows no foreign language phrases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE  <br>
The present invention is a novel and improved method and apparatus for translating a spoken native language phrase into a foreign language phrase. When configured, the device plays a foreign language phrase in response to a  language phrase spoken by the user.<br>
The user is   a collection of predetermined foreign language phrases. The collection may be a set of phrases in a single foreign language or may consist of several sets of foreign language phrases. The collection may be grouped according to foreign language or alternatively may be grouped according to meaning. The collection may be provided to the user aheady implemented in the translation device or may be provided to See user in some form of non-volatile memory. If the collection of foreign language phrases is provided to the user in the form of non-volatile memory, such as a diskette or CDROM, the user is instructed on how to load the desired foreign phrases into the translation device.<br>
Once the desired foreign language phrases and corresponding native language equivalents are loaded into the translation device the user is able to access each phrase by scrolling through a menu on the device user interface. In speaker dependent voice recognition the user must train die voice recognition feature of the device prior to using it as a translator. The user must initiate a training routine where the user says die native language phrase and assigns that voiced native language phrase to a specific foreign language phrase. The voice recognition training routine typically requires the user to repeat the native language phrase at least once.<br>
The set of foreign language phrases saved in memory is audible. The user can append the set of foreign language phrases   phrases loaded from non-volatile memory or, alternatively, can enter new foreign phrases and their corresponding native  language  translations  using  the  device  user<br>
interface.<br>
The user is able to access the translation feature after the phrase has been trained. The voice recognition feature must first be active. Then the user is able to speak the native language phrase and have the device repeat the foreign language pupae.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment a wireless phone is used as the translation device. Modem wireless phones are small enough to be convenient to carry at all times. Some wireless phones have voice recognition capabilities built into the phone. Voice recognition is used to allow a user to dial a number, retrieve phone book entries, store phone book entries, and navigate phone menxas using voice commands. A translator feature can be added to these wireless phones without a significant increase in the amount of hardware within the phcme. Some wireless phones may require additional memory to store the native language phrases and foreign language phrases while other wireless phones already have sufficient memory capabilities and only require a software update. Other wireless phones may require a more powerful loudspeaker than is currently available in the phone. The phone requires the more powerful loudspeaker to provide a louder audible output.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the preferred embodiment die translation feature is implemented into a wireless phone containing voice recognition capabilities. The user accesses the voice recognition features tiirough a small, predetermined, vocabulary set. The voice recognition feature must be activated prior to using the translation feature.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. lA a user starts 101 the user interface by either first powering on the phorw or by ending an active phone call Following either one of those user actions the phone enters a standby state 102. At the standby state<br>
102	the phone is able to accept incoming pfu)ne calls or paging messages and is able to initiate phone calls. At the standby state 102 the user is also able to na\"igate through the user interftice menus. The menus are typically displayed on the phone display with menu options often providing access to additional menus. In phones with a voice recognition feature the user is also able to initiate the voice recognition routine at the standby state 102. Initiation of the voice recognition routine is illustrated in state 103. The user is able to initiate *e voice recognition feature by pressing a predetermined button on the keypad or by sajing and repeating a predetermined command term- In state<br>
103	pressing the "END" button on the keypad or sajong the tenn "Wake-Up" twice will initiate the voice recognition routine. It should be noted that the first time the voice recognition feature is initialized the user must access the voice recognition feature using the keypad since the voice recognition software has not yet been trained to recognize the user voice commands.<br>
After the user has accessed the voice recognition feature the routine advances to state 104 where the voice recognition routiiw checks to see if initial training has been done. Training is first verified because the voice recognition software is not able to recognize laser commands that have not been trained. If initial training has not yet been accomplished the voice reoDgnition software will be unable to recognize any user commands. Therefore, if initial training has not been accomplished the routine proceeds to tiie training menu WO.<br>
However, if initial training has been accomplished die routine proceeds to state 108. At state 108 the voice recognition routine prompts the user by saying "Call, Redial, Voicebook, or Sleep." Each of the key terms used in the prompt. Call, Redial, Voicebook, and Sleep, are available user voice commands that correspond to voice controlled functions. However, the prompt only mentions the commonly used commands. Other voice commands are available to the user. Once the routine has provided the audible prompt to the user the routine proceeds to point A 111. Point A 111 serves only to link the flow chart of HG. lA to the flow chart of FIG. IB. The point has no functionality within the actual voice recognition routine.<br>
Continuing in FIG. IB from point A 111, the routine advances to state 112 where the routine checks to see if there is any user voice input prior to a timeout. If the routine times out prior to user voice input the routine routes the user to state 110 which returns the user back to the point in FIG. 1A where the<br><br>
routine prompts the user for voice input. However, if voice input is detected, the contents of the voice command are analyzed.<br>
Voice recognition routines rely on the ability to correlate user voice commands to words within a pre\"iousIy trained vocabulary set. Voice input matches a previously trained vocabulary set if the correlation exceeds a predetermined tiireshold. One of ordinary skill in the voice recognition art is able to determine die specific details of matching voice input witii a previously trained vocabulary set. The field of voice recognition is not the basis of tiiis invention, therefore the process of voice recognition is not detailed.<br>
When user voice input is required the voice recognition routine utilizes a function which verifies a valid voice command. Additionally, the function may prompt the user to r^)eat the voice input if the command is not understood. The voice command verification functicm would typically be present in any state, such as state 112, w^iich requires user voice input. However, this function is not depicted in FIG.S lA-lE. The presence of a voice command verification function does not alter the operation of the invention and therefore is not shown.<br>
The user can enter one of several voice commands while in state 112. If the user says Translate", state 122, the voice recognition routine advances to the translation function, state 200. The translation function 200 is shown in detail in FIG. IC.<br>
If at state 112 the user says "Record", state 118, the voice recognition routine advances to the reoarder function 500. The recorder function 500 allows the user to manually enter new foreign language phrases that are not within the foreign phrase set supplied by the device manufacturer. The recorder function 500 is shown in detail in FIG. IF.<br>
All of the otiwr commands featured in FIG. IB illustrate phone functions that are accessible using voice commands. If at state 112 the user says a name 124 that has been previously trained and stored in memory, the voice recognition function procseds to a name function 300. The name function 300 allows the user to initiate a phone call to a party by saying a previously saved name of the called party.<br>
At state 112 if the user says "Call" 126 the voice recognition routine proceeds to a call function 400. The call function 400 is much like the name function 300 in that it allows the user to initiate calls using voice commands. However, in the call funchon 400 tfw user can initiate calls either by saying a previously saved name of a called party or by saying the individual digits that are to be dialed.<br><br>
Not all user voice commands relate to call initiation. If the user, in state 112, says "Voicebook" 128 the voice recognition routine proceeds to the voicebook function 500. The voicebook function 500 allows the user the ability to save names and associated phone num.bers in a voice phonebook using voice commands. The names in the voit^ phonebook are then accessible through voice commands. The stored names are the names tfiat can be accessed using the name function 300 or the call function 400.<br>
Additional voice commands may be available to the user at state 112. The additional functions (hat are activated upon the voice command are represented by state 130. Additional commands include tf»e command to exit the voice recognition mode, ti« command tiwt initiates a training function, and the command that initiates redial of the last number called.<br>
FIG. IC shows a flow chart of the translation function 200 shown in FIG IB. When the user issues the voice command to initiate the translation fimction 200 the routine illustrated in FIG. IC starts 201. The translation function 200 first checks to see if there are any foreign language phrases saved in memory, state 202. In devices where foreign language phrases are supplied to the user in the form of a CDROM or floppy disk the user is required to enter the desired set of foreign language phrases. This method is flexible since it allows many sets of foreign language phrases to be supplied to the user. The user then only needs to load the desired set of foreign language phrases. The hardware requirements of the device are minimized by iwt requiring the complete compilation of foreign language phrases to be permanently stored in the<br>
device.<br>
If at state 202 the routine does not find any foreign language phrases presently in memory the routine proceeds to state 204 where the user is instructed to load foreign phrases. At this point (he user is also given the opportunity to exit the voice recognition fimction (not shown).<br>
Once the user has loaded foreign phrases into memory, or if (he voice recognition routine detects foreign phrases already loaded into memory, the voice recognition routiiw proceeds to state 210 to check to see if the foreign language phrases have been trained. If the foreign language phrases have not yet been trained the voice recognition routine proceeds to the training menu 700. However, if the foreign language phrases have already been trained the voice recognition routine proceeds to state 220 where it waits for die user to say a native language phrase. State 220 may be allowed to persist indefinitely until cancelled bv the user or the state may have a timeout Msociated with it.<br><br>
Once the user $ays a nati\"e language phrase the voice recognition routine proceeds to state 230 to correlate the user phrase with previously trained phrases stored in memorv". If the voice recognition routine is unable to correlate the user phrase wiiii a previously trained phrase stored in memory the routine proceeds to state 232 where the phone plays an error message. The voice recognition routine tJien returns to state 220 to await the user voice input. The number of times tfie user is allowed to repeat a phrase may be controlled by the voice recognition routine. It may be preferable to allow the user an indefinite number of retries. If the number of retries is unbounded then user input will be allowed until a matdi is found or until ttie user decides to exit the translation function. Altemati\"ely, the voice recognition routine may only allow a limited number of unsuccessful voice commands. If tiie number of retries is limited the translation function will terminate upon reaching the limit.<br>
If at state 230 the user input correlates with a previously trained phrase the voice recognition function proceeds to state 240- In state 240 the voice recognition function plays the foreign language phrase corresponding to the previously trained phrase. The successful correlation of a user phrase with a previously trained phr&amp;se results in the phone playing a foreign language phrase. Alternatively, the voice recognition function can display tiie foreign language phrase on a display. Effectively, the phone translates the native language phrase input by the user into a foreign language phrase.<br>
FIG. ID is a block diagram of the trairung menu 900. The training menu 900 is accessible from the top level menu 110 or is automatically accessed if the user has never performed any voice training. When the training menu is started 901 the phone proceeds to state 902 where the phone display"s the vocabulary set options. The vocabulary set options would typically include a vocabulary set corresponding to digits, a vocabulary set of command words, and a vocabulary set correspondir^ to tf&gt;e translation function. The phone tfien waits for the user to choose a vocabulary set to train. Once the user chooses a vocabulary set, state 910, ihe routine proceeds to state 912 where the phone displays the available training options corresponding to the chosen vocabulary set.<br>
The user is provided the option of training a vocabulary set or retraining a vocabulary set. The training option is used if the user has never attempted to train the particular vocabulary set. The training option is also used if the user wishes to completely retrain all of the words in the vocabulary set. The retraining option is used if the user has previously trained the vocabulary set<br><br>
and wishes to retrain only a portion of the vocabulary".   The user is also provided the option of quitting the training menu.<br>
If the user chooses the train option 914 the routine proceeds to the initial training function for the chosen vocabulary set 700. FIG. IE provides a detailed flow chart of the training function for the translation function.<br>
If the user chooses the retrain option 916 the routine proceeds to the retrain function for the chosen vocabulary set 800. The retraining function is very similar to the initial training functitm except die retraining function allows die user to skip words in the vocabulary set that do not need to be retrained.<br>
The final option provided the user is quitting die menu 924. If die user chooses to quit the menu 924 the routine can either return the user to the top level menu 110 or exit the voice recognition function.<br>
FIG. IE is a flow chart detailing the initial training function corresponding to the translation function. The initial training function begins at state 710 where the voice recognition routine (abbreviated VR) prompts the user by saying "Follow the voice instructions to begin training." The routine then proceeds to state 712 where the user is prompted to "Say die phrase (phrase)." The term (phrase) in the prompt represents die native language phrase that the user is presently training. The native language phrase corresponding to a foreign language phrase is loaded at die same time that the foreign phrase set is loaded into the phone. Alternatively, the phone display can show the foreign language phrase and the portion of the prompt stating the native language phrase can be eliminated. However, this alternate embodiment is not preferred since the user then must know the translation of the foreign language phrase in order to say die correct native language phrase. This could potentially result in erroneous pairing of native language phrases to foreign language phrases.<br>
Once the voice recognition routine provides the user prompt the routine proceeds to state 716 to wait for user voice input. If die user does not respond prior to die timeout the routine returns to state 712"to repeat the user prompt. As in previous states where user input is required, state 716 allows a limited number of timeouts to occur before terminating the function. If the user provides voice input at state 716 the voice recognition function proceeds to state 720 and says "Again" to prompt the user to repeat the phrase.<br>
The voice recognition routine dien proceeds to state 72A to wait for voice input from the user prior to a timeout. If timeout occurs prior to user voice input the routine returns to state 720 where the prompt is repeated. As before, the user is only given a limited number of opportunities to provide input<br><br>
before the routine terminates. If the user provides voice input prior to timeout, the routine proceeds to state 726 and decides whether both user inputs match.<br>
If the second user voice input does not match the first user voice input the routine proceeds to state 740 where the voice recognition function tells the user "Match was unsuccessful." There are a variety of reasons for an unsuccessful matdi. If the user does not repeat the phrase in the same way it was said the first time there would not be a match. Also if the user does not provide the complete phrase within the allowable input window a portion of the input is not captured. This reailts in an ur\successful match for the two user inputs. Since the root cause of the unsuccessful match cannot be determined, the user mi3l train the phrase again. ITie routine returns to state 712 to repeat the training of the current phrase.<br>
If the voice recognition routine determines both user inputs match, the phrase is saved in memory and the routine proceeds to state 728. In state 728 the voice recognition routine checks to see if all phrases have been trained. If not all phrases have been trained the routine proceeds to state 732 and retrieves the next phrase from the vocabulary set. The routine then returns to state 712 to prompt the user to train the phrase.<br>
State 728 routes ibe routine back to the top level menu 110 once all phrases have been trained. The user is then able to access the translation function.<br>
Hie recorder function 500 allows the user to enter foreign language phrases to the set of foreign language phrases supplied by the device manufacturer. Once the recorder function 500 is started 501, the routine proceeds to state 502 where the routine prompts the user for a native language phrase. The prompt can be an audio prompt played to the user, a visual prompt shown on the device display, or a combination of the two. The user will be required to enter the native language phrase. The native language phrase is entered using the keypad. This allows the user to catalog the native language phrase along with the predetermined" native language phrases supplied by the device manufacturer. Alternatively, the user is prompted to say the native language phrase and the user voice input is saved in the device. Once the user has entered the native language phrase the routine proceeds to state 504 where the routine prompts the user by saying, "Say the foreign language phrase." The routine then advances to state 510 to wait for the user input. If there is no user input prior to a timeout period the routine returns to state 504 to again prompt the user to say the foreign phrase. If die user provides a foreign language phrase before the timeout the routine advances to<br><br>
state 512 where the routine prompts the user to repeat the foreign language phrase by saying, "Again." The routine then proceeds to state 520 where the routine waits for the user input, if the user does not provide any input prior to a timeout the routine returns to state 512 to prompt the user to repeat the foreign language phrase. Although not shown in the flow chart, Uie routine will typically only aUow irput timeouts to occur twice before exiting the routine. If the user repeats ihe foreign language phrase prior to the timeout die routine proceeds to state 530 to dieck to see if both utterances of the foreign language phrase match. Althou^ Ae routine will not be using voice recognition to matdi user input to the foreign language phrase the routine matches the two utterances to ensure a consistent input. One disadvantage with the user recorded foreign language phrases is tine pronunciation of the stored foreign language phrase. The manufecturer supplied foreign language phrases are correctly spoken and definitely correspond to the ixative language phrases. In contrast, a user entered foreign language phrase may suffer from a user"s accent. In the worst case scenario the foreign language phrase entered by the user may not correspond to the native language phrase believed by the user to be the translation.<br>
If the routine decides tiiat the two foreign language phrases spoken by the user do not match, the routine returns to state 504 to again prompt the user to say the foreign language phrase. Once the routine determines that the two utterances of the foreign language phrase match, the routine returns to the Top Level Menu, state 110. like any of the manufacturer supplied foreign language phrases, the user must train the device prior to using the new foreign language phrase.<br>
The hardware required to implement the preferred embodiment is illustrated in the block diagram of FIG. 2. All of the elements to implement the preferred embodiment are already present within some existing wireless phones. FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a wireless phone 600 implementing the preferred embodiment<br>
An antenna 602 sen-"es as the transition between the wireless phone 600 hardware and electromagnetic radiation. The antenna 602 receives electromagnetic radiation and transfers the signal to the RF transceiver 610. Similarly, the RF transceiver 610 provides transmit signals to the antenna 602 to be broadcast to a base station.<br>
In the receive signal path the RF transceiver 610 filters and amplifies die received signal. The received signal is then downconverted to a baseband signal.   This baseband signal is provided to the baseband processor 620.   A<br><br>
digital processor 630 works in conjunction with the baseband processor 620 to extract and format the information in the received signal. The digital processor then provides the extracted and formatted information to the appropriate hardware. The digital processor 630 processes incoming call alerts by retrieving a predetermined ringer soimd from memory 640 and playing it on the ringer. Textual information received by the phone is ^own on the phone display 654. Voice signals are sent to a speaker 658 to be played to the user. Other information is sent to its appropriate interface device 652.<br>
In the transmit path, user input is received by the phone through Ihe keypad 656 or interface de\ice such as a microphone 660. The digital processor 630 conditions and fonnats the input signals in conjunction with the baseband processor 620. The baseband signals are then provided to the RP transceiver 610 where the baseband signals are upconverted to the transmit frequency and broadcast through the antenna 602.<br>
Memory 640 within Ihe phone holds the operating software of the phone. The user interface represCTits one portion of the operating software. The voice recognition algorithm is also stored as software in memory 640 in phones that provide voice recognition as an optional user interface. In one embodiment of the invention a predetermined set of foreign language phrases are stored in a portion of memory 644. Phone memory 640 may be composed of several memory chips. If multiple memory chips are used for phone memory 640, the foreign lar^uage phrases are stored in a first memory device.<br>
In anodier embodiment several sets of foreign language phrases are provided to the user on some tj"pe of ncmvolatile memory format such as floppy disks or CDROM. TTw sets are segregated according to ihe foreign language. The user then chooses one foreign language phrase set and downloads the information to the phone using a personal computer linked to the phone through a data cable. The foreign language phrases are then saved within phone memory 644. The second embodiment has the advantage of allowing the user the abili^ to pick which foreign language phrase will be loaded into tiie phone. The disadvantage is the additional effort and hardware required by the laser.<br>
Once foreign phrases have been loaded into phone memory 644 tfie user must train the voice recognition routine to recognize the native language phrase. The user caimot access the translation feature until voice recognition training has been accomplished. The details of the voice recognition training routine are provided above in FIG. 1. During voice recognition training the phone saves the user"s native language \"oice input in another portion of<br><br>
memory 642. Where the phone memory 640 is composed of multiple memory chips, the native language phrases are saved in a second memory device. Each saved native language phrase corresponds to one of the previously saved foreign language phrases.<br>
The user is able to access ^e translation feature once voice recognition training has been accomplished. To access the translation feature the user first accesses voice recognition capabilities within the phone. This is accomplished by either pressing a predetermined key sequence on the kej^ad 656 or by saying a previously trained voice commar^. User voice commands are input to the phone using the microphone 660 and are processed in (he digital processor 630 nmning voice recognition software saved in memory 640. Once the voice recognition routine has been initiated ihe user must navigate to the translation feature. The user can accomplish this witfi a series of key presses or voice commands. Once the user has accessed the translation feature the foreign language phrases are accessible. The user provides a native language phrase voice input to the microphone 660 that is processed by (he digital processor 630 using voice recognition software saved in phone memory 640. If the voice input correlates with a native language phrase saved in memory 642 the digital processor retrieves a resultant phrase to output to the user. Typically, the resultant phrase is the foreign language phrase from memory 644 that corresponds to the native language phrase. Ihe digital processor retrieves the foreign language phrase and plays it on the speaker 658. In an alternate embodiment the resultant phrase is text of the foreign language phrase corresponding to the native language phrase. In this case, the text of the foreign language phrase is displayed on the phone display 654. The user says a native language phrase and the phone, using voice recognition, responds with the foreign language phrase. The phone effectively translates the native language phrase to a foreign language phrase.<br>
A more detailed block diagram of the voice recognition function is shown" in FIG. 3. A user interface/voice service application 1302 is used to allow a convenient user interface to the voice sen"ice 1310. A voice Application Programming Interface (AH) serves to link the user interface 1302 with the remainder of the voice recognition application. The voice service 1310 controls the distribution of voice recognition tasks. The voice service 1310 also oversees the playback, training, recognition and control functions associated with voice recognition. The voice database (DB) 1340 performs tiie omtrol functions required when voice information needs to be either saved or received from memor\".    The memory manager 1344 performs the tasks associated with<br><br>
interfacing the actual memory hardware to the remaining software routines. A sound 1312 function is used to synthesize and play sounds required by the voice service. These sounds include tones, alerts, and the voice sounds that are retrieved from memory through the voice database 1340. The vocoder driver 1314 and vocoder DSP 1320 routines serve to format voire input signals and process them such flmt they can be utilized in the Voice Recognition engine 1330. They also format voice output data and play back the voice data tfirough the speakers. The VR engine 1330 is the function diat performs the actual voice recognition. The VR engine 1330 lal;es the voice input tfiat has been processed in the vocoder DSP 1320 and compares it against voice templates that are retrieved from memory through the voice database 1340. Matehes or rejections are indicated to the voice service 1310, which supervises the operation of the VR engine 1330.<br>
The liser interface 1302 is further detailed in FIG. 4A. The user interface 1302 is composed of a number of handlers to address the various user inputs and outputs that are required. For example a handler would be used to interface the keyboard to the application. Once the handlers 1402 have converted the user input to a suitable event, the event is routed to the appropriate state machine 1410. All of the functions within the phone can be characterized in tfie form of a state machine. The overall state machine 1410 that represents all tasks within a phone performed by software is composed of a number of individualized state machines SI 1412 through Sn 1416 that perform particular applications. One of the individualized state machine is the translator 1414. The translator 1414 state machine goverrts the flow of the trarislation user interface application.<br>
Information that is processed in tfie state machine is conditioned in an external interface manager 1420 prior to being sent to the voice service 1310 or voice database 1340. In a structure analogous to the state machine 1410 the external interface manager 1420 is composed of a number of individual managers El 1422 tiirough En 1426 that manage the interfaces to applications. The Voice Service (VS) manager 1424 is used to interface between the translator 1414 state machine and tfie voice service 1310 or voice database 1340 applications.<br>
Various utility 1430 applications are available to all the routines present in the user interface 1302. The utilities 1430 are not specific to any one routine and are shared throughout all the routines of tiie user interface 1302.<br>
FIG. 4B is a block diagram detailing the translator state machine 1414. The translator state machine 1414 is composed of three smaller state machines.<br><br>
the trainer 1510, the translator 1512, and the recorder 1514. Each of the smaller state machines control the function of that portion of the translator state machine 1414. The relationship of the translator state machine 1414 to the external interface manager 1420, voice service 1310, and voice database 1340 are the same as shown in FIG. 4A.<br>
