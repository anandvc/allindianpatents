				<td> Toughened composition<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to epoxy resin compositions with improved toughness resistance. Epoxy resin compositions exhibit numerous advantageous properties which allow them to be used as structural adhesives or as a matrix for composite materials or in applications for protecting electronic components. The compositions of the invention comprise an epoxy resin, an impact modifier component, especially a copolymer, and a hardener. These compositions can be manufactured by dissolution of the copolymer in the epoxy resin, followed by addition of the hardener and crosslinking under hot conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Epoxy materials have a high crosslinking density, which provides them with a high glass transition temperature Tg, which confers excellent thermomechanical properties on the material. The higher the crosslinking density, the higher the Tg of the material and consequently the better the thermomechanical properties: the higher the operating temperature limit of the material. Nevertheless, the impact strength properties of epoxy materials are insufficient for numerous applications. Numerous solutions have been developed to attempt to respond to this problem. At the same time, while all epoxy materials are difficult to strengthen with regard to impacts, epoxy materials with high Tg values are the most difficult.<br>
US patent application 2003/0187138 describes a toughener for thermosetting resins which comprised a trithiocarbonate polymer.<br>
The patent EP 0 659 833 describes a composition based on epoxy resins, impact modifier and a mixture of amine hardeners being formed of dicyandiamide, cycloaliphatic amine and polyoxyalkylenamine.<br>
US patent US 486256 describes a two-part composition comprising an epoxy resin, a chain extender, a base catalyst and a polymeric toughener, especially a core-shell graft copolymer.<br><br>
US Publication US 2003/0187154 describes impact-resistant epoxy resin compositions containing an epoxy resin (A), a copolymer (B), for example a CTBN rubber, a latent hardener (C) and reaction products containining more than one carboxyl group per molecule.<br>
Recently, it has been found that the addition of triblock copolymers having at least one block predominantly composed of methyl methacrylate units to epoxy compositions results in epoxy materials with improved impact resistance; EP1290088.<br>
The patent application WO 03/063572 describes thermoset materials with improved impact strength, obtained from compositions comprising a hardenable resin, typivally epoxy resin, polyamide resulting from the condensation of at least one diacid and at least one diamine, and possibly an impact modifier selected from SBM, BM and MBM copolymers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It now has surprisingly been found that the impact resistance of epoxy materials is significantly improved when compositions containing an epoxy resin, an impact modifier component especially a core-shell copolymer or a block copolymer having at least one block predominantly composed of methyl methacrylate units, together with a polyoxyalkyleneamine hardener, are cured to form epoxy materials..<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention thus relates to epoxy resin compositions comprising<br>
(a)	an epoxy resin liquid at room temperature having on average more than one 1,2-epoxide<br>
group in the molecule;<br>
(b)	a hardener-accelerator system consisting essentially of a polyoxyalkyleneamine hardener<br>
(commercialized by Huntsman as Jeffamine® hardener);<br>
(c)	an impact modifier containing at least one of (C1)a block copolymer having at least one<br>
block predominantly composed of methyl methacrylate or a core-shell copolymer (C2).<br>
EPOXY RESIN<br>
The term "epoxy resin" is understood to mean any organic compound having at least two functional groups of oxirane type which can be polymerized by ring opening. The term "epoxy resin" denotes any conventional epoxy resin which is liquid at room temperature (23° C.) or<br><br>
at a higher temperature. These epoxy resins can be monomeric or polymeric, on the one hand, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic, on the other hand. Mention may be made, as examples of such epoxy resins, of resorcinol diglycidyl ether, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, triglycidyl-p-amino-phenol, bromobisphenol F diglycidyl ether, the triglycidyl ether of m-amino-phenol, tetraglycidylmethylenedianiline, the triglycidyl ether of (trihydroxy-phenyl)methane, polyglycidyl ethers of phenol-formaldehyde novolak, polyglycidyl ethers of ortho-cresol novolak and tetraglycidyl ethers of tetraphenyl-ethane. Mixtures of at least two of these resins can also be used.<br>
Epoxy resins are, for example, those which contain groups of the formula A<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which either R6 and R8 are each a hydrogen atom, in which case R7 is then a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, or R6 and R8 together are -CH2-CH2 or -CH2-CH2-CH2 --, in which case R7 is then a hydrogen atom, bonded directly to oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms.<br>
Examples, which may be mentioned, of such resins are polyglycidyl esters and poly-(.beta.-methylglycidyl) esters, which can be obtained by reaction of a compound containing two or more carboxylic acid groups per molecule with epichlorohydrin, glycerol dichlorohydrin or .beta.-methylepichlorohydrin in the presence of an alkali. Such polyglycidyl esters can be derived from aliphatic polycarboxylic acids, for example oxalic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid or dimerized or trimerized linoleic acid, from cycloaliphatic polycarboxylic acids, such as tetrahydrophthalic acid, 4-methyltetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid and 4-methylhexahydrophthalic acid, and from aromatic polycarboxylic acids, such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid.<br>
Other examples are polyglycidyl ethers and poly-(.beta.-methylglycidyl) ethers which are obtainable by reaction of a compound containing at least two free alcoholic and/or phenolic hydroxyl groups per molecule with the corresponding epichlorohydrin under alkaline conditions, or in the presence of an acid catalyst, with subsequent treatment with an alkali.<br><br>
These ethers can be prepared with poly-(epichlorohydrin) from acyclic alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and higher poly-(oxyethylene) glycols, propane-1,2-diol and poly-(oxyprapylene) glycols, propane-1,3-diol, butane-1,4-diol, poly-(oxytetramethylene) glycols, pentane-1,5-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, hexane-2,4,6-triol, glycerol, 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol and sorbitol, from cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as resorcitol, quinitol, bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-methane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane and 1,1-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-cyclohex-3-ene, and from alcohols having aromatic nuclei, such as N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-aniline and p,p'-bis-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-diphenylmethane. They can furthermore be prepared from mononuclear phenols, such as resorcinol and hydroquinone, as well as polynuclear phenols, such as bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane, 4,4-dihydroxydiphenyl, bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone, 1,1,2,2-tetrakis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane (otherwise known as bisphenol A) and 2,2-bis-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane, as well as novolaks formed from aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, chloral and furfural, with phenols, such as phenol itself and phenol which is substituted on the ring by chlorine atoms or alkyl groups having in each case up to nine carbon atoms, such as 4-chlorophenol, 2-methylpheno! and 4-tert-butylpheno!.<br>
Poly-(N-glycidyl) compounds include, for example, triglycidyl isocyanurate and N,N'-diglycidyl derivatives of cyclic alkyleneureas, such as ethyleneurea and 1,3-propyleneurea, and hydantoins, such as 5,5-dimethylhydantoin.<br>
Poly-(S-glycidyl) compounds are, for example, the di-S-glycidyl derivatives of dithiols, such as ethane-1,2-dithiol and bis-(4-rnercaptomethy!phenyl) ether.<br>
Examples of epoxy resins containing groups of the formula A in which R6 and R8 together are a -CH2-CH2 -- group are bis-(2,3-epoxycyclopentyl) ether, 2,3-epoxycyclopentyl glycidyl ether, 1,2-bis-(2,3-epoxycyclopentyloxy)-ethane and 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl 2',4'-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate which are less preferred.<br>
Epoxy resins in which the 1,2-epoxide groups are bonded to different types of hetero atoms, for example the N,N,O-triglycidyl derivative of 4-aminophenol, the glycidyl ether/glycidyl ester of salicyclic acid or p-hydroxybenzoic acid, N-glycidyl-N'-(2-glycidyloxypropyl)-5,5-dimethylhydantoin and 2-glycidyIoxy-1,3-bis-(5,5-dimethyl-1 -glycidy]-3-hydantoinyl)-propane, are also suitable.<br><br>
Aromatic epoxy resins, such as diglycidyl ethers of bisphenols, are specifically preferred.<br>
The epoxy resin (a) is advantageously employed in the compositions according to the invention in amounts of 30 to 94.5% by weight, preferably 45 to 84% by weight and in particular 60% to 78.5% by weight, based on the amount of components (a), (b) and (c).<br>
POLYOXYALKYLENE AMINE<br>
US patent US 4528308 describes an epoxy resin curing agent comprising a mixture of an<br>
imidazole compound and a selected polyoxyalkylenepolyamine.<br>
As regards the polyoxyalkyleneamine (Jeffamine®) type hardener, such hardeners are usually based on a polyether backbone composed of polypropylene oxide, polyethylene oxide or a mixture thereof whereby the terminal hydroxyl group(s) is/are converted to an amine. Preferably, the amine functionality of the polyoxyalkyleneamines hardener is at least 2 so as to form a diamine, triamine .. Said polyoxyalkyleneamines are commercially available and include polyoxypropylenetriamine (preferably having an average molecular weight of approximately 440) and polyoxypropylenediamine (α-(2-aminomethylethyl)-∞-(2-aminomethylethoxy)-poly-[oxy(methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)], preferably having an average molecular weight of approximately 230). Further suitable hardeners may be found in Technical Bulletin of Huntsman : " The Jeffamine Polyoxyalkylenamines"; Huntsman Corporation 2002 (1008-1002).<br>
In addition to the Jeffamine® type hardener, further hardeners may be included in the epoxy composition. Preferably, such further hardeners are amine hardeners. For example, they can be isophorondiamin, dicyandiamid, chlortolurone and laromine, N-aminethylpiperazine, 5-amino-1,3,3-trimethyl cyclohexane-methanamine, ethyleneamine, 2,2-dimethyl-4,4methylenebis-(cyclohexyl-amin) and adducts, as they are obtainable for example by the reaction of 5-amino-1,3,3-trimethyl cyclohexane-methanamine with epoxy resins,<br>
It is believed that the beneficial effect of the presence of the Jeffamine on the properties of the cured resin is especially apparent when the Jeffamine is the most important hardener of the hardener mixture. Therefore, if the polyoxyalkyleneamine (Jeffamine®) type hardener is not the sole hardener, it forms preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70%, 75% or 80% y weight, based on the amount of hardeners. The non-Jeffamine hardener can be a cycloaliphatic amine like those cited above, or an aromatic amine<br><br>
hardener, like diaminodiphenylsulfon. Preferably the hardener mixture amine does not comprise dicyandiamid.<br>
The polyoxyalkyleneamine (Jeffamine®) type hardener (b) is advantageously employed in the compositions according to the invention in amounts of 5% to 70% by weight, preferably 5% to 60% by weight and in particular 5% to 50% by weight, based on the amount of components (a), (b) and (c).<br>

In the latter case, the acrylates are different from those of the M block, in order to observe the condition that S and M are incompatible.<br>
The S-B-M triblock has a number-average molar mass which can be between 10,000 g/mol<br>

a core comprising, in moles, at least 93% of butadiene, 5% of styrene and 0.5 to 1% of divinylbenzene and (ii) of 25 to 20 parts of two shells essentially of the same weight, the internal one made of polystyrene and the other, external, made of PMMA.<br>
While block copolymers like SBM when introduced into epoxy resin permit to form transparent or colored cured resin products, incorporation of core shell polymers tends to lead to opaque cured resin products. Therefore, for some applications and uses of the cured product, incorporation of core shell polymers into a resin composition is not always desired.<br>
According to a second preferred form of the invention, the impact modifier comprises at least one S-B-M block copolymer and at least one S-B block copolymer. The impact modifier advantageously comprises between 5 and 80% of S-B diblock for respectively from 95 to 20% of S-B-M triblock.<br>
According to a third preferred form of the invention, the impact modifier comprises at least one S-B-M block copolymer and at least one core-shelf polymer (A). The proportion of core-shell with respect to the S-B-M can be between 5 for 1 and 1 for 4 and preferably between 3 for 1 and 1 for 2.<br>
According to a fourth preferred form of the invention, the impact modifier comprises at least one S-B-M block copolymer and at least one ATBN or CTBN reactive rubber. The proportion of reactive rubber with respect to the S-B-M can be between 5 for 1 and 1 for 4, preferably between 3 for 1 and 1 for 2.<br>
According to an advantageous form, a portion of the S-B-M can be replaced with an S-B diblock. This portion can be up to 70% by weight of the S-B-M.<br>
It will not be departing from the scope of the invention to replace all or part of the S-B-M triblock with an M-S-B-S-M or M-B-S-B-M pentablock. They can be prepared by anionic polymerization, like the di- or triblocks mentioned above, but by using a difunctional initiator. The number-average molar mass of these pentablocks is within the same ranges as that of the S-B-M triblocks. The proportion of the two M blocks together or of the two B or S blocks together is within the same ranges as the proportions of S, B and M in the S-B-M triblock.<br><br>
The impact modifier consisting essentially of a block copolymer having at least one block predominantly composed of methyl methacrylate, in particular the S-B-M-triblock or M-B-M-triblock impact modifier (c) is advantageously employed in the compositions according to the invention in amounts of 0.5 to 20% by weight, preferably 1 to 15% by weight and in particular 1.5 to 10% by weight, based on the amount of components (a), (b) and (c).<br>
FURTHER EMBODIMENTS<br>
The compositions according to the invention preferably contain, per 100 parts by weight of<br>
the composition, components (a) and (b) in amounts of 70-99.5 parts by weight and<br>
component (c) in amounts of 0.5-30 parts by weight and more preferably components (a) and<br>
(b) in amounts of 80-99.5 parts by weight and component (c) in amounts of 0.5-20 parts by<br>
weight.<br>
Preferably, the content of impact modifier component, especially the block copolymer component, should be limited in order to ensure proper dissolution into the epoxy resin and also for cost reasons.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be prepared by blending the epoxy resin, not yet crosslinked, and the impact modifier using a conventional blending device followed by adding the polyoxyalkyleneamine type hardener. Alternatively, the impact modifier may be blended first with the polyoxyalkyleneamine type hardener and then with the epoxy resin.<br>
The epoxy resin compositions can be prepared using a conventional stirred reactor. The epoxy resin is introduced into the reactor and brought for a few minutes to a temperature sufficient to be fluid (140°C). The impact modifier comprising the block copolymers is subsequently added and stirred at a temperature sufficient to be fluid until it has completely dissolved. The stirring time depends on the nature of the copolymer added. After three to five hours the blockcopolymers is dissolved at an internal temperature of 140°C-150°C.The hardener is then added and blending is carried out for a further 5 minutes at a temperature sufficient to be fluid in order to obtain a homogeneous blend. These blends are subsequently cast and cured in a mould.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also contain other known additives usually employed in the art of polymerizable materials. Examples of such additives are fillers,<br><br>
pigments, dyes, flame retardant substances, antistatics, adhesion promoters, flow control agents, antioxidants, light stabilizers and fibers.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be employed quite generally for the production of cured products and can be used in the formulation suitable for the particular specific field of use, for example as coating compositions, paints, pressing compositions, dipping resins, casting resins, impregnating resins, laminating resins, 1- or 2-component adhesives or matrix resins. Use in the field of aerospace, wind mil! and sports equipment as laminating resins, hotmelt, composition for the RTM process, 1- or 2-component adhesives or matrix resins is particularly preferred.<br><br>

Discussion of the results;<br>
1. Regarding the flexural modulus, flexural strength and flexural elongation;<br>
The results are very similar for these properties amongst all examples and comparatives.<br>
2.Tg<br>
In none of the investigated cases the Tg has been lowered by addition of impact modifier by more than 10%. Typically the Tg decrease is in the range of 0-3% when adding 5% of SBM or MAM, and can be 5-10% when adding core/shell toughener.<br>
3. Toughener<br>
The core shell particles must be dispersed in the epoxy resin while copolymers like MAM, SBM etc are dissolved in the starting epoxy resin. This permits an homogenous distribution of the copolymer while particles can agglomerate after some time, leading to an heterogen distribution in the resin matrix which may produce product exhibiting heterogen properties. It is possible to achieve better K1C and G1C values with copolymers, especially of the SBM type. Epoxy resin compositions containing core shells particles can only lead to opaque products while copolymers-containing composition may lead to to translucent or transparent products. Therefore compositions containing copolymers are preferred. Preferably, the epoxy resin composition comprises:<br>
(a)	an epoxy resin liquid at room temperature having on average more than one 1,2-epoxide<br>
group in the molecule;<br>
(b)	a hardener-accelerator system consisting essentially of a polyoxyalkyleneamine type<br>
hardener;<br>
(c)	an impact modifier containing at least one of:a block copolymer having at least one block<br>
predominantly composed of methyl methacrylate.<br>
The improvement in GlC-toughness when adding 5% of the claimed impact modifiers is typically in the range of 500-1200% for compositions containing Jeffamine ® hardeners. The toughness increase is the highest when the composition contains a polyoxyalkylene amine and SBM block copolymer.<br>
4. Toughness: K1c and GC<br><br>
Table 7:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Toughness of the cured resin is increased when an impact modifier (toughening agent) is<br>
present in the composition.<br>
For each amine, save XTJ 590, this toughness increase is the highest with the block<br>
copolymer SBM1, then with core shell then with MAM1.<br>
The behavior of compositions containing polyoxyalkylene amine XTJ-590 is different than the<br>
others as XTJ 590 provides a high toughness even without any toughening agent present in<br><br>
The composition. This hardener reacts very fast with epoxy resins which is limiting the work life. This is restricting the use for a number of applications where a longer open time is required.<br>
When comparing the influence of 5% of impact modifier to standard amine/epoxy systems the improvement in G1C-toughness is in the range of 200-400%.<br>
However, the toughness increase of cured resins made from epoxy resin compositions containing impact modifiers is dramatically increased for compositions containing Jeffamine ® hardeners, which was not expected.<br>
