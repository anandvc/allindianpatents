				<td>METHOD OF HEAVY METAL REMOVAL FROM INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER USING SUBMERGED ULTRAFILTRATION OR MICROFILTRATION MEMBRANES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains to a method of heavy metal removal from industrial wastewater via the use of a submerged ultrafiltration or microfiltration membrane system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Due to stringent environmental regulations and / or water shortages, industries have to remove heavy metals from their wastewaters before discharge or reuse. Most of the wastewaters are treated by commodity DTC/TTC chemistries or specialty polymeric DTC compounds and then the precipitated metals are separated in a clarirler. In recent years, ultrafiltration (UF) or microfiltration (MF) membranes are increasingly being used for solid-liquid separation instead of clarifiers, because UF/MF membrane processes are much more compact and result in water with much better quality than clarifiers; specifically there are almost no suspended solids and negligible turbidity. The UF or MF permeate can be reused with or without any further treatment, depending on purpose of reuse. Therefore, industrial wastewaters when treated with polymeric chelants and subsequently filtered through UF or MF membranes result in high metal removal and also higher membrane fluxes than those treated with commodity DTC/TTC/TMT chemistries.<br>
Although cross-flow UF or MF processes have been used for this application, the operating cost of these processes is usually high due to high cross-flow energy required to minimize membrane fouling. In last decade or so, submerged UF and MF membranes have been successfully used for the high-suspended solids separation application such as in Membrane Bioreactors (MBR) or low suspended solid applications such as raw water treatment and tertiary treatment. Submerged membranes operate at low fluxes (10-60 LMH) in these applications, as membranes get fouled at higher fluxes. For minimizing membrane fouling, aeration is used to scour the membrane surface, either continuously (e.g. in MBR) or intermittently (e.g. in MBR, raw water and tertiary treatment). Therefore, it is of interest to adapt these relatively low operating cost submerged membrane systems for other high solid applications such as heavy metal removal in conjunction with polymeric chelants, which function as metal complexing agents as well as membrane flux enhancers. The application of polymer chelants in filtration<br>
systems is discussed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,346,627 and 6,258,277, which are herein incorporated by reference,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method of removing one or more heavy metals from industrial wastewater by use of a membrane separation process comprising the following steps: (a) collecting an industrial wastewater containing heavy metals in a receptacle suitable to hold said industrial wastewater; (b) adjusting the pH of said system to achieve hydroxide precipitation of said heavy metal in said industrial wastewater; (c) adding an effective amount of a water soluble ethylene dichloride ammonia polymer having a molecular weight of from about 500 to about 10,000 daltons that contain from about 5 to about 50 mole percent of dithtocarbamate salt groups to react with said heavy metals in said industrial wastewater system; (d) passing said treated industrial wastewater through a submerged membrane, wherein said submerged membrane is an ultrafiltration membrane or a microfiltration membrane; (e) and optionally back-flushing said membrane to remove solids from the membrane surface.<br>

A potential industrial wastewater treatment scheme is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, industrial wastewater containing heavy metals is collected in a receptacle (1), in which acid or base is added through a line (3) to adjust pH to 3-4. The chelant scavenger such as iron compound is then added through a line (3A). This water then flows in to a receptacle (2), In which the pH is adjusted to 8-10 through in-line (4) or direct (5) addition of base in the receptacle (2). From the receptacle (2) the water then flows to a receptacle (8) in which an ultrafiltration or microfiltration membrane (10) is submerged. Aeration may be applied to the ultrafiltration or microfiltration membrane. The polymeric chelant such as ethylene dichloride-ammonia polymer may be added in-line (6) or directly (9) in to a membrane tank (8). After ethylene dichlonde ammonia polymers are added, one or more water-soluble polymers may be added optionally in-line (7) before the water flows into membrane tank (8).  The permeate (11) from the submerged ultrafiltration or microfiltration membrane process may be optionally treated by passing the permeate through an additional membrane (12) and the reject (concentrate) (13) may be sent for further dewatering or disposal.<br>
The following examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
This invention was tested by conducting experiments with a submerged flat-plate microfiltration membrane having a 0.4 ujn pore size and 0.1 m2 membrane area and industrial wastewater. Membrane performance was determined by conducting a critical flux study in which the rate of change of trans-membrane pressure, TMP, with time was measured at different fluxes. The flux at which the TMP increases abruptly is defined as the critical flux. The higher the critical flux, the lower the membrane area required for a given capacity and therefore lower the capital cost. Metal concentration in the feed and permeate was measured using Perkin Elmer Atomic Absorption Spectrometer, (Model AA200, Boston, MA). Permeate turbidity was measured by a Hach Turbidimeter (Hach, Ames, IA), that is sensitive to 0.06 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidimetric Unit).<br>
Example 1<br>
Industrial wastewater containing 15 ppm of copper, surfactants, and chelants was obtained from a circuit board manufacturing company and placed in a tank equipped with an overhead mixer. The pH was adjusted to 3.0 with sulphuric acid. Then 190 ppm ferric sulphate was added and mixed for 2 minutes. The pH was then adjusted to 8.0 with 25% sodium hydroxide and a 180 ppm of ethylene dichloride-ammonia polymer, fimctionaiized with carbon disulfide and available from Nalco Company, 1601 West Diehl Road, Naperville, IL, was. added and mixed for 3 minutes. This treated wastewater was then placed in membrane tank. Initially, lower flux of 30 LMH was applied while monitoring the TMP. After 10 minutes, flux was increased to 59 LMH and again the TMP measured. This process was continued up to 300 LMH flux. During these measurements, permeate was recycled back into the feed tank and no concentrate was purged out, which means the metal and solids concentration in the membrane tank was constant. Permeate metal concentration and turbidity was also measured at each flux. The flux-TMP data is shown in Figure 2. The turbidity of permeate was 0.09-0.12 NTU at all fluxes. The permeate Cu++ concentration remained between 0.1-1 ppm throughout this experiment. These metal concentrations are as desired or lower than required for discharge into water bodies.<br>
As seen from Figure 2, the TMP was below 1 psi, even at the highest flux of 320 LMH. Secondly, the TMP did not increase significantly with time at any flux. As a reference, submerged membranes are operated at only 10-40 LMH for high solids application such as in Membrane Bioreactor, with maximum allowed TMP of 4-5 psi above which membranes have to be cleaned. Thus, this example illustrated that said ethylene dichloride-ammonia polymer treatment allows submerged membranes to be operated at higher fluxes while resulting in<br>
permeate with very low metal level and turbidity. Such a high water quality qualifies for the water reuse option with or without further treatment.<br>
Example 2<br>
Similar protocol was used as in Example 1, but with industrial wastewater containing 773 ppm Cu and also surfactants and chelants. This wastewater was also obtained from circuit board manufacturing company. The ferric sulphate and dosage of said ethylene dichloride-ammonia polymer used in this example were 3000 ppm and 2100 ppm respectively. The TMP-flux data is shown in Figure 3. Even in presence of much higher level metal, other foulants and treatment chemistries, critical flux was not detected even after 300 LMH flux operation. The permeate turbidity was again 0.09-0.12 NTU and permeate Cu++ varied between 0.09 to 14 ppm. The reduction of Cu++ from 773 to even 14 ppm is over a 98% reduction, which is significant, while allowing the stable operation, i.e. no membrane fouling, at higher fluxes.<br>
Example 3<br>
In this example, 24 L of simulated wastewater containing 100 ppm Cu++ and 590 ppm EDTA-Na4 (Tetrasodium salt of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid) was treated the same way as in Example 1. The ferric sulphate and said ethylene dichloride-ammonia polymer were 1300 ppm and 300 ppm, respectively. After polymeric chelant treatment, 5 ppm of a DMAEA.MCQ-AcAm copolymer having 50 mole % cationic charge, was also added and mixed for 2 minutes. Here, both permeate and reject/concentrate were discharged while constantly adding the treated feed in the membrane tank to maintain the level of 7 L. The final concentration factor in Figure 4 means a ratio of initial feed volume (24 L) / final retentate volume (7 L), i.e. the solids in the feed were concentrated 3.4 times at the end of the experiment at each of the both fluxes studied.<br>
As seen from Figure 4, even after 3.4 times concentration, TMP remained low and almost constant with time (or volume concentration) at both 266 and 317 LMH fluxes. In this example as well, turbidity was
