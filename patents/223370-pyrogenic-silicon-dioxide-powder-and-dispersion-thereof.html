				<td>Pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder and dispersion thereof<br>
The invention provides a pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide powder, an aqueous dispersion containing this<br>
silicon dioxide powder, the production and use of the<br>
silicon dioxide powder and the dispersion.<br>
The term pyrogenic silicon dioxide or pyrogenic silica<br>
(fumed silica) is a collective term for all highly disperse<br>
silicas obtained in the gas phase at elevated temperatures<br>
by coagulation of monomeric silica. There are two processes<br>
for the industrial production of pyrogenic silicas, high-<br>
temperature hydrolysis and the arc process.<br>
In the high-temperature hydrolysis process a homogeneous<br>
 mixture of a vaporous silicon compound, hydrogen, oxygen<br>
and an inert gas is burned with a burner in a cooled<br>
combustion space. Two reactions proceed side by side here.<br>
Firstly the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen with formation<br>
of water and secondly the hydrolysis of the silicon<br>
compound with formation of silicon dioxide.<br>
The homogeneity of the gas mixture means that the reaction<br>
conditions and hence the formation and growth conditions<br>
are largely the same for each SiO2 particle, such that very<br>
homogeneous and uniform particles can form. Air is used as<br>
the oxygen source in the known process. The pyrogenic<br>
silicas produced by the known process display specific<br>
surface areas of between 10 and 600 m2/g.<br>
The starting material for the silicon dioxide is generally<br>
silicon tetrachloride (cf. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A23, pages 635 ff. 5th edition).<br>
In addition to silicon tetrachloride methyl<br>
trichlorosilane, trichlorosilane or mixtures thereof with<br>
silicon tetrachloride can also be used.<br>
JP 2002114510 claims a process in which silicon dioxide is<br>
obtained with an average particle size of 0.05 to 5 mm. In<br>
this process silicon compounds are burned in the presence<br>
of oxygen and hydrogen. Siloxanes, silanes or silicon<br>
chlorides can be used as the silicon compound. However, the<br>
silicon dioxide produced by this process displays no<br>
properties that could not also be obtained by processes of<br>
the prior art. The process described is itself only of<br>
limited suitability for the production of larger<br>
quantities. A non-uniform product and, where carbon-<br>
containing silicon compounds are used as starting<br>
materials, dark products too are then to be expected in<br>
particular.<br>
When used in dispersions such as are used in the production<br>
of glass articles or in chemical mechanical polishing in<br>
the semiconductor industry, the powder produced according<br>
to JP 2002114510 provides no advantages over the prior art.<br>
Due to growing requirements an improvement in the<br>
properties of silicon dioxide is demanded in these very<br>
sectors. In the glass industry in particular, highly<br>
filled, readily manageable dispersions, in other words ones<br>
with low viscosity, are required because of their low<br>
shrinkage on drying and sintering.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a silicon dioxide<br>
powder which is suitable for the production of highly<br>
filled dispersions with low viscosity. The object of the<br>
invention is also to provide a stable dispersion containing<br>
this silicon dioxide powder.<br>
The invention provides a pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide powder having a specific surface area of between 5<br>
and 600 m2/g and a carbon content of less than 500 ppm,<br>
which is characterised in that it displays<br>
a specific dibutyl phthalate absorption of less than<br>
or equal to 1.2 g dibutyl phthalate/100 g SiO2 per<br>
m2 of specific surface area<br>
and a specific thickening action of less than<br>
15 mPas per m2 of specific surface area.<br>
The specific dibutyl phthalate absorption represents a<br>
measure of the structure of the silicon dioxide powder<br>
according to the invention as a function of its specific<br>
surface area. The term structure in this connection means<br>
the degree of intergrowth of the primary particles. These<br>
are initially formed in the pyrogenic process and as the<br>
reaction continues can coalesce to form chain-like<br>
aggregates, which in turn form agglomerates. The specific<br>
dibutyl phthalate absorption of less than or equal to 1.2 g<br>
dibutyl phthalate/100 g SiO2 per m2 of specific surface<br>
area claimed for the silicon dioxide powder according to<br>
the invention is generally lower than pyrogenic silicon<br>
dioxide powders obtained by the prior art.<br>
The silicon dioxide powder according to the invention<br>
arises only in combination with a specific thickening<br>
action. This is understood to mean the thickening action<br>
per m2 of specific surface area. The thickening action is<br>
determined in a dispersion of a silicon dioxide powder in a<br>
polyester.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the powders according to the<br>
invention can display a specific compacted bulk density,<br>
defined as the product of the compacted bulk density and<br>
specific surface area, of between 1000 and 10000 and<br>
particularly preferably between 4000 and 7000 g/1 x m2 of<br>
specific surface area. Powders according to the invention<br>
displaying a specific compacted bulk density in this range<br>
can be incorporated especially readily into dispersions.<br>
Furthermore, silicon dioxide powders according to the<br>
invention can preferably have a chloride content of less<br>
than 50 ppm, particularly preferably less than 20 ppm. The<br>
low chloride contents can for example demonstrate<br>
advantageous effects when the powders according to the<br>
invention are used in the area of chemical mechanical<br>
polishing.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the production of<br>
silicon dioxide powder according to the invention which is<br>
characterised in that<br>
vaporous tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and/or<br>
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) together with air or with<br>
oxygen-enriched air and separately<br>
hydrogen<br>
are supplied to a burner, and the mixture of gases<br>
is allowed to react in a flame in a reaction chamber<br>
connected in series to the burner, and the solid<br>
reaction product is separated from the gas stream by<br>
known means,<br>
the lambda value in the burner being between 0.95<br>
and 1.5 and<br>
sufficient secondary air also being supplied to the<br>
reaction chamber that the lambda value in the<br>
reaction chamber is between 0.8 and 1.6.<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified process flow chart upon which<br>
the process according to the invention is based. A =<br>
burner; B = flame; C = reaction chamber;<br>
1 = supply of mixture comprising vaporous<br>
tetramethoxysilane and/or tetraethoxysilane together with<br>
air or with oxygen-enriched air; 2 = supply of hydrogen; 3<br>
= supply of secondary air.<br>
In the performance of the process it is substantial that a<br>
premixing of silane and air occurs, the stoichiometry of<br>
air/hydrogen and the oxygen component, expressed as the<br>
lambda value, being maintained in the burner and reaction<br>
chamber.<br>
Lambda denotes the ratio of oxygen supplied to the burner<br>
or the reaction chamber to stoichiometrically required<br>
oxygen, which is needed to convert the silane compound<br>
completely to silicon dioxide. The lambda value range that<br>
must be maintained in the reaction chamber likewise refers<br>
to the total amount of the silane to be hydrolysed.<br>
In the process according to the invention the volume ratio<br>
of oxygen/hydrogen in the burner can be varied between 0.2<br>
and 2.8. In a particularly preferred embodiment the volume<br>
ratio of oxygen/hydrogen in the burner is between 0.9 and<br>
1.4.<br>
Depending on the desired specific surface area, it can be<br>
useful to vary the streams supplied to the burner and the<br>
burner geometry in such a way that the discharge velocity<br>
of the gases leaving the burner is at least 10 ms-1.<br>
Discharge velocities of at least 20 ms-1 are particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
The invention also provides an aqueous dispersion<br>
containing the silicon dioxide powder according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The aqueous dispersion according to the invention can<br>
display a content of silicon dioxide powder of between 2 0<br>
and 80 wt.%. Dispersions having a content of silicon<br>
dioxide powder of between 40 and 60 can be particularly<br>
preferred. These dispersions display a particularly high<br>
stability with a comparatively low structure.<br>
The aqueous dispersion according to the invention can<br>
preferably display an average particle size in the<br>
aggregates of silicon dioxide powder which is less than<br>
200 nm. For certain applications such as e.g. the chemical<br>
mechanical polishing of semiconductor substrates, a value<br>
of less than l50 nm can be particularly preferred.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention can be stabilised<br>
by the addition of bases or cationic polymers or aluminium<br>
salts or a mixture of cationic polymers and aluminium salts<br>
or acids.<br>
Bases that can be used are ammonia, ammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, primary, secondary or<br>
tertiary organic amines, sodium hydroxide solution or<br>
potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
Cationic polymers that can be used are examples having at<br>
least one quaternary ammonium group, phosphonium group, an<br>
acid adduct of a primary, secondary or tertiary amine<br>
group, polyethylene imines, polydiallylamines or<br>
polyallylamines, polyvinylamines, dicyandiamide<br>
condensates, dicyandiamide-polyamine cocondensates or<br>
polyamide-formaldehyde condensates.<br>
Aluminium salts that can be used are aluminium chloride,<br>
aluminium hydroxychlorides having the general formula<br>
Al(OH)xCl where x=2-8, aluminium chlorate, aluminium <br>
sulfate, aluminium nitrate, aluminium hydroxynitrates<br>
having the general formula Al(OH)xNO3 where x=2-8,<br>
aluminium acetate, alums such as aluminium potassium<br>
sulfate or aluminium ammonium sulfate, aluminium formate,<br>
aluminium lactate, aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide<br>
acetate, aluminium isopropylate, aluminium hydroxide,<br>
aluminium silicates and mixtures of the aforementioned<br>
compounds.<br>
Inorganic acids, organic acids or mixtures of the<br>
aforementioned can be used as acids.<br>
In particular, phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, nitric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, mixtures thereof and their acid-<br>
reacting salts can be used as inorganic acids.<br>
Organic acids that are preferably used are carboxylic acids<br>
having the general formula CnH2n+1CO2H, where n=0-6 or n= 8,<br>
10, 12, 14, 16, or dicarboxylic acids having the general<br>
formula HO2C(CH2)nCO2H, where n=0-4, or hydroxycarboxylic<br>
acids having the general formula R1R2C (OH) CO2H, where R1=H,<br>
R2=CH3, CH2CO2H, CH(OH)CO2H, or phthalic acid or salicylic<br>
acid, or acid-reacting salts of the aforementioned acids or<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned acids and salts thereof.<br>
Stabilisation of the dispersion according to the invention<br>
with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide or aluminium<br>
hydroxychloride in an acid medium can be particularly<br>
advantageous.<br>
The dispersion can optionally also contain other additives.<br>
These can for example be oxidising agents such as hydrogen<br>
peroxide or per-acids, oxidation activators whose purpose<br>
is to increase the rate of oxidation, corrosion inhibitors<br>
such as e.g. benzotriazole. Surface-active substances of a<br>
non-ionic, cationic, anionic or amphoteric nature can also<br>
be added to the dispersion according to the invention.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the production of<br>
the dispersion according to the invention, which is<br>
characterised in that the silicon dioxide powder according<br>
to the invention is incorporated with a dispersing device<br>
into water, which can be stabilised by the addition of<br>
bases or cationic polymers or aluminium salts or a mixture<br>
of cationic polymers and aluminium salts or acids, and is<br>
then dispersed further for a period of 5 to 3 0 minutes.<br>
There is no restriction on the type of dispersing device.<br>
It can be advantageous however, especially for the<br>
production of highly filled dispersions, to use dispersing<br>
devices with a high energy input. These can for example be<br>
rotor-stator systems, planetary compounders or high-energy<br>
mills. In the latter, two predispersed streams of<br>
suspension under high pressure are decompressed through a<br>
nozzle. The two jets of dispersion hit each other exactly<br>
and the particles grind themselves. In another embodiment<br>
the predispersion is likewise placed under high pressure,<br>
but the particles collide against armoured sections of<br>
wall. A rotor-stator system can preferably be used to<br>
produce the dispersion according to the invention.<br>
The invention also provides the use of the silicon dioxide<br>
powder according to the invention as a filler in rubber,<br>
silicone rubber and plastics, to adjust the rheology in<br>
paints and coatings and as a support for catalysts.<br>
The invention also provides the use of the dispersion<br>
according to the invention for the production of glass<br>
articles, for chemical mechanical polishing and for the<br>
production of inkjet papers.<br>
Examples<br>
Analytical determinations<br>
The specific surface area of the powders is determined in<br>
accordance with DIN 66131.<br>
The dibutyl phthalate absorption is measured with a<br>
RHEOCORD 90 device supplied by Haake, Karlsruhe. To this<br>
end 8 g of the silicon dioxide powder is introduced into a<br>
mixing chamber with an accuracy of 0.001 g, the chamber is<br>
closed with a lid and dibutyl phthalate is metered in<br>
through a hole in the lid at a predefined feed rate of<br>
0.0667 ml/s. The compounder is operated at a motor speed of<br>
125 revolutions per minute. On reaching the maximum torque<br>
the compounder and DBP metering are automatically switched<br>
off. The DBP absorption is calculated from the consumed<br>
amount of DBP and the weighed amount of particles according<br>
to the formula below:<br>
DBP value (g/100 g) = (DBP consumption in g / weighed<br>
amount of particles in g) x 100.<br>
The thickening action is determined by the following<br>
method: 7.5 g silicon dioxide powder are introduced into<br>
142.5 g of a solution of an unsaturated polyester resin in<br>
styrene with a viscosity of 13 00 +/- 100 mPas at a<br>
temperature of 22°C and dispersed by means of a high-speed<br>
mixer at 3000 min-1. A suitable example of an unsaturated<br>
polyester resin is Ludopal® P6, BASF. A further 90 g of the<br>
unsaturated polyester resin in styrene are added to 60 g of<br>
this dispersion and the dispersion process is repeated. The<br>
thickening action is taken to be the viscosity value in<br>
mPas of the dispersion at 25°C, measured with a rotary<br>
viscometer at a shear rate of 2.7 s-1.<br>
The chloride content of the silicon dioxide powder is<br>
determined by the following procedure: Approximately 0.3 g<br>
of the particles according to the invention are weighed in<br>
accurately, topped up with 20 ml of 20 percent reagent-<br>
grade sodium hydroxide solution, dissolved and transferred<br>
into 15 ml cooled HNO3 whilst being stirred. The chloride<br>
content in the solution is titrated with AgNO3 solution<br>
(0.1 mo1/1 or 0.01 mol/1).<br>
The carbon content of the silicon dioxide powder is<br>
determined by the following procedure: Approximately 100 to<br>
1000 mg of the particles according to the invention are<br>
weighed accurately into a crucible, combined with 1 g each<br>
of ultrapure iron and aggregate (LECOCELL II) and burned in<br>
a carbon analyser (LECO) at approx. 1800°C with the aid of<br>
oxygen. The CO2 that is generated is measured by IR and the<br>
content calculated therefrom.<br>
The compacted bulk density is determined by reference to<br>
DIN ISO 787/XI K 5101/18 (not screened).<br>
The pH is determined by reference to DIN ISO 787/IX, ASTM D<br>
1280, JIS K 5101/24.<br>
The viscosity of the dispersions is determined with a<br>
Physica Model 300 rotary rheometer and a CC 27 measuring<br>
beaker at 25°C. The viscosity value is determined at a<br>
shear rate of 10 1/sec. This shear rate is in a range in<br>
which the viscosity of the dispersions formed is virtually<br>
independent of the shear stress.<br>
The particle size prevailing in the dispersion is<br>
determined by means of dynamic light scattering. A<br>
Zetasizer 3000 HSa (Malvern Instruments, UK) is used. The<br>
volume-weighted median value of the peak analysis is<br>
stated.<br>
Example 1;<br>
1.5 kg/h tetramethoxysilane are evaporated at 180°C and<br>
introduced into the central pipe of the burner. 12 m3/h of<br>
air are additionally introduced into the central pipe.<br>
1.8 m3/h of hydrogen are fed into a pipe surrounding the<br>
central pipe. The gas mixture burns in the reaction<br>
chamber, into which 17 m3/h of secondary air are<br>
additionally introduced.<br>
The reaction gases and the silicon dioxide that is formed<br>
are drawn through a cooling system by application of a<br>
partial vacuum, cooling them to values between 100 and<br>
160°C. The solid is separated from the waste gas stream in<br>
a filter or cyclone.<br>
The analytical data for the silicon dioxide powder obtained<br>
is reproduced in Table 2.<br>
Examples 2 to 9 and comparative examples 10 and 11 were<br>
performed in the same way.<br>
In comparative examples 12 to 14 silicon tetrachloride is<br>
used in place of tetramethoxysilane. In these experiments,<br>
following separation from the waste gas stream the silicon<br>
dioxide powder is treated at elevated temperature with<br>
water vapour-containing air to remove adhering hydrochloric<br>
acid residues.<br>
The physical-chemical data for the silicon dioxide powders<br>
obtained is reproduced in Table 2.<br>
Examples 1 to 9 lead to the silicon dioxide powders<br>
according to the invention having a low structure,<br>
expressed as the specific DBP value, a low specific<br>
thickening action and a high specific compacted bulk<br>
density.<br>
Examples 10 and 11 show that only the process according to<br>
the invention leads to these powders. Reducing the<br>
secondary air or even omitting it altogether or increasing<br>
the burner air does not lead to the silicon dioxide powders<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In the same way, using silicon tetrachloride, examples 12<br>
to 14, whilst maintaining the conditions with regard to the<br>
lambda value in the burner and in the reaction chamber,<br>
does not lead to the silicon dioxide powders according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Example 15: Production of a dispersion in the acid pH range<br>
36 kg of demineralised water are placed in a 60 1 stainless<br>
steel batch container. 6.4 kg of the pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide are then drawn in under shear<br>
conditions using the suction pipe of the Ystral Conti-TDS 3<br>
and on completion of the drawing-in process shearing is<br>
continued for a further 15 min at 3000 rpm.<br>
Example 16: Production of a dispersion in the alkaline pH<br>
range<br>
35.5 kg of demineralised water and 52 g of a 30% KOH<br>
solution are placed in a 60 1 stainless steel batch<br>
container. 6.4 kg of the pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide are then drawn in under shear conditions using the<br>
suction pipe of the Ystral Conti-TDS 3 and on completion of<br>
the drawing-in process shearing is continued for a further<br>
15 min at 3 000 rpm. During this 15-minute dispersion the pH<br>
is adjusted to and held at a pH of 10.4 by addition of<br>
further KOH solution. A further 43 g of KOH solution were<br>
used in this process and a solids concentration of 15 wt.%<br>
established by addition of 0.4 kg water.<br>
Example 17: Production of a dispersion in the presence of<br>
aluminium salts<br>
35 kg of demineralised water are placed in a 60 1 stainless<br>
steel batch container. 6.4 kg of the pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide are then drawn in under shear<br>
conditions using the suction pipe of the Ystral Conti-TDS<br>
3. 640 g of a 1 wt.% solution (relative to aluminium oxide)<br>
of aluminium chloride are then added with dispersion and on<br>
completion of the addition shearing is continued for a<br>
further 15 min at 3000 rpm. 0.1 kg demineralised water and<br>
3 05 g 1 N NaOH are then added to obtain a 15 wt.%<br>
dispersion with a pH of 3.5.<br>
Example 18: Production of a dispersion of Aerosil 90<br>
(comparative example)<br>
35.5 kg of demineralised water and 52 g of a 30% KOH<br>
solution are placed in a 60 1 stainless steel batch<br>
container. 5.2 kg of AEROSIL® 90 are then drawn in under<br>
shear conditions using the suction pipe of the Ystral<br>
Conti-TDS 3 and on completion of the drawing-in process<br>
shearing is continued for a further 15 min at 3000 rpm.<br>
During this 15-minute dispersion the pH is adjusted to and<br>
held at a pH of 10.4 by addition of further KOH solution. A<br>
further 63 g of KOH solution were used in this process and<br>
a solids concentration of 15 wt.% established by addition<br>
of 0.6 kg water.<br>
The physical-chemical parameters for the dispersions are<br>
reproduced in Table 3.<br>

Example 19: Dispersion with high solids content<br>
35.5 kg of demineralised water in a 60 1 stainless steel<br>
batch container are adjusted to a pH of 11 with tetramethyl<br>
ammonium hydroxide solution (25%). 37 kg of the<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide are then drawn in<br>
under shear conditions using the suction pipe of the Ystral<br>
Conti-TDS 3 and on completion of the drawing-in process<br>
shearing is continued for a further 15 min at 3000 rpm.<br>
During this 15-minute dispersion the pH is held at a pH of<br>
between 10 and 11 by addition of tetramethyl ammonium<br>
hydroxide solution. A solids concentration of 50 wt.% is<br>
established by addition of the remaining amount of water<br>
that is needed.<br>
The resulting dispersion has a silicon dioxide content of<br>
50 wt.% and a pH of 10.3. It displays a viscosity,<br>
determined with a Physica viscometer, of 2450 mPas. The<br>
average particle size is 116 nm. The dispersion displays no<br>
thickening or sedimentation even after a storage period of<br>
6 months.<br>
The silicon dioxide powders according to the invention are<br>
characterised by an ability to be incorporated rapidly into<br>
aqueous media.<br>
In comparison to dispersions with the known silicon dioxide<br>
powder, the dispersions according to the invention display<br>
more favourable values for viscosity and smaller particle<br>
sizes.<br>
Example 19 shows that dispersions with a high solids<br>
content can also be produced. Under similar conditions the<br>
use of known silicon dioxide powders with a comparable BET<br>
surface area leads to gel-like compositions, or the powder<br>
cannot be incorporated fully.<br>
