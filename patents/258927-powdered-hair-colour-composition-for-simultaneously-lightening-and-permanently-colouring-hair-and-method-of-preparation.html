1. Title of the invention:<br>
"POWDERED HAIR COLOUR COMPOSITION FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY LIGHTENING AND PERMANENTLY COLOURING HAIR AND METHOD OF PREPARATION"<br><br><br>
2. Applicant (s)<br>
(a)	Name: Godrej Consumer Products Limited<br>

3. Preamble to the description<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to one step method and compositions of powder hair colour which can simultaneously lighten the hair up to seven levels and imparting colour to hair with oxidation hair dyes. The invention further relates to process for preparation of powder hair colour composition.<br>
Back ground and prior art:<br>
Natural hair colour is derived from melanin granules embedded throughout the cortex of hair fibers. Two general classes of such pigments have been identified as eumelanins (brownish black) and pheomelanins (reddish orange). The combination ratio and concentration of these two types of pigments impart to the hair its characteristic natural gradations of color. Dark hair has a higher concentration of the eumelanins, while red hair has a predominance of the pheomelanins. Light blond hair has reduced amounts of both.<br>
Hair bleaching is a chemical process by which a bleaching agent gradually destroys the melanin granules in the cortex, resulting in a lighter color of the hair. When an ammonical solution of hydrogen peroxide diffuses through the cuticle and enters the cortex, it starts to attack and disperse the melanin granules. The different types of melanin granules are not destroyed at the same rate. Generally, the eumelanins are easier to breakdown than the pheomelanins. Because of this property, dark hair, when bleached, experiences a visual enhancement of the red pigments during the bleaching process, and the casting of a reddish orange or "brassy" tone to the resultant bleached hair. In order to neutralize this warmth, hair colorants are applied during or after a bleaching treatment.<br>
Hair bleaches may be classified into two categories based on their chemical composition and their strength.Category-1 bleaches are liquid- or cream-based compositions utilizing alkaline hydrogen peroxide solutions as the main oxygen-generating agent to oxidize and bleach hair melanin, usually in conjunction with a hair coloring process. Just before use, the peroxide is mixed with an alkalizing agent such as ammonia, and the resulting liquid<br><br>
or cream is applied to hair for 30 to 60 minutes. Such compositions may lighten the hair by as much as four levels at the most, depending on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide used.<br>
Category-2 bleaches can deliver over seven levels of lift, something which cannot be attained with category-1 bleaches. Bleaches are generally powder compositions, some of them are in cream form, which are based on persulfate salts (ammonium, potassium, sodium) as auxiliary or booster supplies of active oxygen, and silicate and/or carbonate salts as sources of alkalinity. Again, just before use, they are mixed with hydrogen peroxide solutions to form a workable cream that can be applied to the hair.<br>
U.S.Pat. No. 5,688,291 teaches a single-step method and compositions for simultaneously lightening and coloring hair up to seven levels, utilizing alkaline peroxide solutions. This patent discloses a single-step composition, which utilized disperse dye components azo and anthraquinone compounds in category-2 bleach, to simultaneously lighten the hair up to seven levels and deposit different colors.<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 08175940, published Jul. 9, 1997, teaches the combination of a xanthene-based hair dyeing agent, a peroxide based developer, and a persulfate based bleaching compound.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 718,9265, and 6.44,0177, teaches us simultaneously lightening and colouring hair utilizing bleach-stable derivatives of azo, triaryl methane thiazine, or nitro dyes.<br>
EP 1 106 166 describes hair dye compositions comprising ammonia, carbonate (other than ammonia salt), transition metal salt and chelating agent which do not give off an irritating odour, have low skin irritation and can change the hair colour into a lighter tone in a short time.<br><br>
WOOl/28508 describes hair colouring formulations comprising oxidising agents and ammonia carbonate or carbamate which deliver improved bleaching and colouring with reduced odour and hair damage without the need for buffering agents, pH modifiers or hair swelling agents.<br>
JP11343219 discloses hair bleaching compositions comprising ammonia, or ammonium ion and carbonate ion. Similarly DE 296 13 065 Ul discloses a hair beaching powder comprising hydrogen peroxide, ammonium salt and alkali carbonate or alkali hydrogen carbonate.<br>
US Pat. No. 7204861 describes a hair colouring and hair bleaching composition comprising peroxymonocarbonate ions, alkalizing agent, ammonium ions and radical scavenger, in liquid / cream form.<br>
In general, the cursory review of prior art reveals that the conventional permanent hair dye compositions, however, needs to be applied in two step process; which requires more time to apply on hair and hence gives discomfort to the client as well as hair dresser. Moreover, these compositions results in scalp irritation due to prolonged contact of the skin with alkalinity, peroxide and oxidation dyes. Furthermore, these compositions significantly damage the hair as the two step process needs additional alkaline peroxide treatments. Further, these compositions normally present in liquid or gel form. The liquid forms normally pose stability as well as handling problems.<br>
However, the prior art fails to address the above mentioned problems, which the present inventors have achieved in this invention and hence sought the protection for the same. Therefore, there is a need in the art to develop stable powdered hair colour compositions and methods which are capable of providing subtle to dramatic variations in tonality and hue at one extreme, and at the other extreme, subtle to pronounced variations in shade in a one step procedure. These hair colour compositions must also be stable, gentle, and suitable for use with those who have dark and black hair.<br><br>
Objectives of the invention:<br>
The object of the invention is to provide one step method for simultaneously lighten the hair up to  seven  levels  and  imparting  colour to  hair with  oxidation hair dyes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide the consumer with a hair colourant, which provides improved lift and lightening, reduced damage, particularly brittle fibre formation, and improved colour delivery, uptake and durability without causing undue hair damage due to double processing.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a powder composition for lightening and coloring the keratin fibres, which is devoid of peroxide or persulphate.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In the present invention there is provided a one step method and a composition of powder hair colour which can simultaneously lighten the hair up to seven levels and imparting colour to hair with oxidation hair dyes. The composition for lightening and coloring of keratin fibres comprises a combination of powder oxidizing agents, ammonium salts, thickening agents, surfactants, hair care materials, oxidative dyes. The composition of the present invention is compatible with oxidation dyes and dye precursor systems and result in improved lift and lightening for blond shades, and provides excellent dye deposition &amp; colour with improved grey coverage.<br>
