Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to ultrasonic generators, transducers, and converters, and<br>
relates more particularly to an ultrasonic transducer or converter having a two-piece head mass or front<br>
driver, where one piece provides good thread integrity and the other piece provides good acoustic<br>
and/or heat transfer properties.<br>
Description of the Relevant Art<br>
Typical prior art stacked ultrasonic transducers or converters 10 and 12 are shown in Figures 1<br>
and 2. Both transducers 10 and 12 have multiple PZTs 14 (piezoelectric crystals or transducers), which<br>
are annular in shape and are located between a tail mass or back driver 16 and a head mass or front<br>
driver 18 (Fig. 1) or 20 (Fig. 2). A bolt 22 is threaded into internal threads in the head mass 18 or 20 to<br>
hold the converter together and to compress the PZTs 14 between the head mass and tail mass. An<br>
insulating sleeve 23 electrically insulates the PZTs 14 from the bolt 22, and electrical contacts 25<br>
provide electrical connections to the PZTs. A threaded extension 24 connects the converter to a booster<br>
or horn (not shown) used for ultrasonic welding or similar application. The PZTs operate in thickness<br>
mode, which means they expand and contract primarily in the direction of the central axis 26 of the<br>
transducer. The head mass 18 or 20 is tapered in order to amplify the amplitude of the vibrations of the<br>
PZTs 14.<br>
In Figure 1, the head mass 18 is a single material such as aluminum or titanium. Aluminum has<br>
an advantage in that it has a high thermal capacity which is useful as a heat sink for transferring heat<br>
away from the PZTs. However, aluminum is a relatively soft metal and the screw threads needed to<br>
retain the bolt 22 and threaded extension 24 are correspondingly weak.<br>
Titanium has superior material strength and thread strength as compared to<br>
aluminum, but has a lower thermal capacity and cannot absorb heat as<br>
effectively as aluminum.<br>
TEe transducer 12shown in Figure 2 substitutes titanium for aluminum<br>
in the threaded area of the head mass. The two-piece head mass 20 is composed<br>
of aluminum in the proximal piece 28 next to the PZTs 14 and is composed of<br>
titanium in the distal piece 30 that contains internal threads to mate with the<br>
bolt 22 and lie threaded extension 24. A disadvantage of such a two-piece head ,<br>
mass design is that it does not perform as well as a single-piece head mass<br>
(Figure 1) because having two materials interferes with the amplitude gain of<br>
the tapered head mass and transmission of ultrasonic vibrational energy<br>
from the PZTs to the booster or horn.<br>
In other applications, an ultrasonic transducer may be attached to a<br>
surface to which ultrasonic vibrational energy is to be transferred. For example,<br>
the surface may be the outside surface of a tank holding a cleaning solution and<br>
-s in which objects to be cleaned ultrasonically are immersed. In such an<br>
application, the ultrasonic transducer may be adhesively bonded to the tank<br>
surface. However, if the material of the tank and that of the head mass are<br>
different, there may be a mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion,<br>
which can cause failure of the adhesive bond. The tank may be made of quartz<br>
and the head mass of the transducer may be made of aluminum, which have<br>
significantly different coefficients of thermal expansion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In summary, the present invention is afsleeved ultrasonic transducer<br>
comprising a threaded sleeve for one part of the head massjand an outer housing<br>
of a different material for the other part of the head mass. Since the head mass<br>
is composed of two parts, they can be made of different materials, each selected<br>
to optimize a different property or function. The threaded sleeve is preferably<br>
metal such as titanium that provides superior .thread strength for mating with the<br>
bolt and threaded extension, if any, while the outer housing is preferably<br>
aluminum or ceramic that provides good thermal heat sink capacity and/or<br>
transmission of vibrational energy. The combination of the two components<br>
provides an improved ultrasonic transducer.<br>
More specifically, the ultrasonic transducer of the present invention<br>
includes one or more disk-shaped piezoelectric crystals wherein each<br>
piezoelectric crystal, has an axial hole; a tail mass positioned on one side of the<br>
piezoelectric crystals, wherein the tail mass includes an axial hole; a head mass<br>
positioned on a side of the piezoelectric crystals opposite the tail mass, wherein<br>
the head mass has an internally-threaded axial hole; and a threaded bolt<br>
positioned within the axial hole of each piezoelectric crystal and the axial holes<br>
of the tail mass and head mass and threaded into the internally-threaded axial<br>
hole of the head mass, wherein the bolt compresses the piezoelectric crystals<br>
between the tail mass and head mass. The head mass includes two pieces<br>
composec of different materials, including a threaded sleeve that has the<br>
internally-threaded axial hole and has a reduced diameter section and further<br>
including an outer housing that is axially outside the reduced diameter section.<br>
of the threaded sleeve.<br>
Preferably, the threaded sleeve and the outer housing have mating<br>
contact surfaces on a plane perpendicular to an axis of the transducer. Also<br>
preferably, an outer diameter of the reduced diameter section of the threaded<br>
sleeve is substantially equal to an inner diameter ot the one or more<br>
piezoelectric crystals.<br>
The features and advantages described in the specification are not all<br>
inclusive, and particularly, many additional features and advantages will be<br>
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification<br>
and claims hereof. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the<br>
specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional<br>
purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the<br>
inventive subject matter, resort to the claims being necessary to determine such<br>
inventive subject matter. For example, the specification uses the terms<br>
transducer, converter, and generator interchangeably to refer to a device that<br>
generates ultrasonic vibrations in response to an electrical driving signal. The<br>
term piezoelectric crystal is used interchangeably with the terms piezoelectric<br>
transducer and PZT. Also, the terms head mass and front driver are used<br>
interchangeably to refer to the portion of the transducer (or converter or<br>
generator) through which the ultrasonic vibrational energy passes to the object<br>
of interest. Likewise, the terms tail mass and back driver are used<br>
interchangeably to refer to the portion of the transducer (or converter or<br>
generator) mat is opposite the head mass (or front driver) and that provides a<br>
mass to balance the vibrations of the piezoelectric crystals.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The drawings depict various preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily<br>
recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the<br>
structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing<br>
from the principles of the invention described herein.<br>
As shown in Figures 3-6, a sleeved ultrasonic transducer 40 according to<br>
the present invention has a two-piece head mass 42 that comprises an internally-<br>
threaded sleeve 44 of one material and a counterbored outer housing 46 of<br>
another material. Preferably, the threaded sleeve 44 is composed of a material,<br>
such as titanium or other metal, that has sufficient material strength for screw<br>
threads. Also preferably, the outer housing is composed of a material, such as<br>
aluminum, another metal, or ceramic or other non-metallic material, that<br>
provides advantageous thermal and/or acoustical properties, including thermal<br>
conduction, thermal expansion and/or efficient conduction of the vibrational<br>
energy generated by the PZTs (piezoelectric transducers or crystals) 14.<br>
The threaded sleeve 44 has internal threads 48 that mate with external<br>
threads of the bolT 22 and fed threaded extension 24. The outer housing 46 has<br>
a flat upper surface 50 that contacts the PZT stack and a counter bored hole 52<br>
that nests or mates with a reduced diameter section 54 of the threaded sleeve 44.<br>
The outer housing 46 has a flat lower surface 56 that is perpendicular to the axis<br>
of the transducer and that contacts a shoulder 58 of the threaded sleeve 44. The<br>
bolt 22 compresses the PZTs 14 against the upper surface 50 of the outer<br>
housing 46 and compresses the lower surface 56 against shoulder 58 of the<br>
threaded sleeve 44. Axial vibrations from the PZTs 14 travel through the outer<br>
housing 46 and into the threaded sleeve 44 at the contact between the surface 56<br>
of the outer housing and the shoulder 58 of the threaded sleeve.<br>
The lower surface 56 of the outer housing 46 is preferably located in a<br>
cylindrical section 60 of the head mass, not in a tapered section 62.The<br>
amplitude gain of the head mass is fully developed in the tapered section 62 so<br>
that the vibrations in the cylindrical section 60 are axial. The transition between<br>
the two pieces of the head mass, where surface 56 butts against shoulder 58, is<br>
located at the cylindrical section so that the axial vibrations are transferred<br>
efficiently from the outer housing 46 to the threaded sleeve 44. Preferably, the<br>
outer diameter of the reduced diameter section 54 of the threaded sleeve is<br>
substantially the same as the inner diameter of the PZTs 14.<br>
As compared to the prior ultrasonic transducer 12 with a two piece head<br>
mass 20 (Figure 2), the sleeved ultrasonic transducer 40 of the present invention<br>
with an aluminum outer housing 46 and a titanium threaded sleeve 44 has more<br>
aluminum for better heat sinking and has a more effective transition of<br>
vibrations between the aluminum and titanium pieces. As shown in Figure 7,<br>
the prior transducer 12 has a minimum impedance of 11.24 ohm, while Figure 8<br>
shows that such a sleeved transducer 40 of the present invention has an<br>
improved minimum impedance of 4.18 ohm.<br>
As compared to the prior art one piece ultrasonic transducer 10 (Figure<br>
1), the sleeved ultrasonic transducer 40 of the present invention with an<br>
aluminum outer housing 46 and a titanium threaded sleeve 44 has better thread<br>
strength than an all-aluminum head mass and better thermal heat sinking than<br>
an all-titanium head mass. The combination of the titanium threaded sleeve 44<br>
and aluminum outer housing 46 of the sleeved transducer 40 achieves acoustical<br>
performance equivalent to single-metal front drivers.<br>
The outer housing may also be composed of a metal other than<br>
aluminum or a non-metallic material including ceramics such as silicon carbide,<br>
aluminum oxide, or other advanced ceramics. As used herein, the term<br>
"advanced ceramics" is intended to mean ceramic materials having a minute<br>
grain size of a few microns or a fraction of a micron and which also have very<br>
high density with near zero porosity as measured in microns. The grain<br>
structure is highly uniform allowing ultrasonic signals to move in every<br>
direction simultaneously. Silicon Carbide is a preferred; form of advanced<br>
ceramic and is made from a chemical reaction with graphite. Using a ceramic<br>
material for the outer housing improves acoustic performance because ceramic<br>
is a better conductor of ultrasonic vibrational energy than aluminum and other<br>
metals, and may be preferred for that reason.<br>
Figure 9 shows an alternative construction of the Figure 3-6<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Transducer 90 has a head mass 92 that<br>
has an outer housing 94 and a threaded sleeve 96. A reduced diameter section<br>
98 of the threaded sleeve 96 extends upwardly to the top of the outer housing<br>
94. The outer housing 94 has an axial hole sized to accommodate the section 98<br>
of the threaded sleeve 96. Preferably, the outer diameter of the reduced<br>
diameter section 98 of the threaded sleeve 96 is substantially the same as the<br>
inner diameter of the PZTs 14. Vibrational energy from the PZTs 14 is<br>
transferred to the outer housing 94, then downward to a bottom surface 100 of<br>
the outer housing to an upper surface 102 of the threaded sleeve 96. In other<br>
respects, the transducer 90 is the same as the transducer 40 described above.<br>
Figure 10 shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention for<br>
high frequency applications. An ultrasonic transducer 70 has two annular PZTs<br>
72 in the middle of a stack, an annular disk 74 of aluminum oxide above the<br>
PZTs, an annular disk 76 of silicon carbide below the PZTs, a titanium head<br>
mass 78 and a titanium tail mass 80. The tail mass 80 has a threaded sleeve 82<br>
that is internally threaded and that extends into the annular region of the<br>
transducer stack from above. The head mass 78 has an externally threaded<br>
member 84 that extends into the annular region of the transducer stack from<br>
below. The internally threaded sleeve 82 of the tail mass 80 mates with the<br>
externally threaded member 84 of the head mass 78 to secure the transducer<br>
stack and compress the PZTs 72 and disks 74 and 76 between the head mass<br>
and tail mass.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to an improvement in<br>
ultrasonic transducers used in cleaning systems, shown in Figures 12-13. More<br>
specifically, it has now been recognized that enhanced performance can be<br>
achieved by forming the tank or vessel out of quartz or an advanced ceramic<br>
material and by bonding the transducer directly onto a surface of the tank.<br>
Ultrasonic transducers commonly used for cleaning operations have a<br>
stacked construction. A typical transducer has one or more piezoelectric<br>
crystals shaped in the form of a disk with an annular hole. The piezoelectric<br>
crystal is oriented so that expansion and contraction in response to applied<br>
electrical signals is axial in direction. On one side of the piezoelectric crystal is<br>
a tail mass and on the other side is a head mass. A screw or bolt compresses the<br>
piezoelectric crystal between the head mass and tail mass. The head mass is<br>
mounted on the tank and transmits vibrations from the piezoelectric crystal to<br>
the tank. The tail mass balances the displacements caused by the expansion and<br>
contraction of the piezoelectric crystal. In my prior U.S. Patents 5,748,566 and<br>
5,998,908,1 disclosed an improvement to a stacked transducer construction,<br>
which added a resonator made of a ceramic material between the piezoelectric<br>
crystal and the head mass.<br>
One problem to overcome in bonding a transducer to a cleaning tank is<br>
inconsistent material properties between the materials used for the tank and<br>
transducer. Head and tail masses are commonly made from metals, such as<br>
aluminum, which have a much higher coefficient of expansion than quartz or<br>
ceramics such as silicon carbide.<br>
The present invention has a different construction for the transducer,<br>
which facilitates bonding of the transducer to a tank. Typically more than one<br>
transducer is mounted to a tank, either internally or externally. Commonly<br>
several transducers are mounted to the bottom of a cleaning tank The tank<br>
contains a liquid and parts to be cleaned, rinsed, or otherwise processed using<br>
ultrasonics. The transducers are excited by an alternating current. Vibrations<br>
caused by the piezoelectric crystals of the transducers are transferred into the<br>
tank and through the liquid to the parts in the tank.<br>
The construction of another embodiment of the transducer of the present<br>
invention is shown as transducer 110 in Figures 11 and 12. The components of<br>
the transducer 110, from the top, include a tail mass 118, electrode 120,<br>
piezoelectric crystal 122, electrode 120, ceramic resonator 124, and a head mass<br>
125 that includes a threaded sleeve 126 and an outer housing 128. A bolt 130 is<br>
threaded into an internally threaded hole in the threaded sleeve 122 and<br>
compresses the electrodes 120, piezoelectric crystal 122 and ceramic resonator<br>
124 between the tail mass 118 and the head mass 125. The outer housing 128 is<br>
preferably composed of silicon carbide or other ceramic material and is bonded<br>
to a flat surface 132 of the threaded sleeve 126. Preferably, the outer housing is<br>
composed of a metal or non-metallic material that has a coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion that is similar to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material<br>
of the tank. Another flat surface 134 of the outer housing 128 is bonded to a<br>
surface of a cleaning tank. A protrusion 136 at the bottom of the threaded<br>
sleeve 126 mates with an axial hole 138 of the outer housing 128 to assist in<br>
positioning the threaded sleeve relative to the outer housing. All the parts of the<br>
transducer except the electrodes 120 are axially symmetrical. The tail mass 118<br>
and threaded sleeve 126 are preferably composed of aluminum material, but<br>
may be made of other non-metallic materials or metals such as titanium if<br>
thread strength is an issue.<br>
An alternative construction of the transducer 110 is shown in Figure 13.<br>
Transducer 150 has a threaded sleeve 152 that extends downward to the bottom<br>
of the outer housing 128, which provides more thread area for the bolt 130 to<br>
engage. Also, transducer 150 has an insulated sleeve 154 inside the inner<br>
diameter of the PZT 156. Preferably, the outer diameter 158 of the lower<br>
protrusion 160 of the threaded sleeve 152 is substantially the same as the inner<br>
diameter 162 of the PZT 156. Such a construction may be more efficient in<br>
transferring the vibrational energy of the PZT through the outer housing 128 to<br>
the tank. Alternatively, the ceramic resonator 124 may have the same inner<br>
diameter as the PZT 156 with the insulated sleeve 154 extending downward to<br>
the top of the threaded sleeve 152.<br>
One advantage of the construction of transducer 110 or 150 is that the<br>
outer housing 128 of the head mass can be made out of a metal or non-metallic<br>
material, such as silicon carbide, that has properties similar to those of the tank<br>
material, which may be quartz or silicon carbide or other advanced ceramic.<br>
Silicon carbide is a polycrystalline material. There are many grains in a silicon<br>
carbide ceramic, with grain size being a few micrometers (direct sintered).<br>
There are different forms of quartz, including fused quartz and single crystal<br>
quartz. Fused quartz is an amorphous (non-crystalline, or glass) material.<br>
Generally speaking, single crystal quartz is one big grain. It can be as big as<br>
several inches (with only one grain). Fused quartz is amorphous, so it does not<br>
contain any grains.<br>
The coefficients of thermal expansion of glass and ceramic are isotropic,<br>
meaning that it is not direction dependent The coefficient of thermal expansion<br>
of a single crystal quartz is anisotropic (direction dependent), meaning it varies<br>
with the crystal orientation. Generally speaking, the coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion of quartz single crystal is about 15-20 times bigger than fused quartz<br>
glass. The preferred type of quartz for cleaning tanks is fused quartz. The<br>
coefficients of thermal expansion (in units of µm/m-°C) are 0.4 for fused quartz,<br>
4.5 for silicon carbide, 17 for stainless steel, 9 for titanium, and 23-24 for<br>
aluminum.<br>
By using silicon carbide instead of aluminum for the portion of the head<br>
mass that is bonded to a cleaning tank, the thermal mismatch is reduced<br>
significantly. The mismatch in thermal expansion between two bonded<br>
materials induces stresses within the material/boundary when there is a<br>
temperature change. The difference in thermal expansion coefficients between<br>
aluminum and fused quartz is about 60 times, compared to 10 times between<br>
silicon carbide and fused quartz.<br>
The transducer 110 or 150 is bonded to a surface (exterior or interior) of<br>
the tank with an epoxy polymer adhesive Supreme 10AOHT. This epoxy<br>
contains a ceramic filler of aluminum oxide (alumina). It is a heat curing epoxy<br>
with high shear strength and high peel strength. It also is thermally conductive<br>
and resistant to severe thermal cycling. The same adhesive is used to bond the<br>
silicon carbide outer housing 128 to the aluminum threaded sleeve 126 or 152.<br>
The use of silicon carbide in the head mass provides an ultrasonic<br>
transducer that can readily be bonded to a quartz or ceramic tank, which<br>
facilitates efficient transfer of ultrasonic vibrations from the transducer to the<br>
parts or items in the tank.<br>
From the above description, it will be apparent that the invention<br>
disclosed herein provides a novel and advantageous sleeved ultrasonic<br>
transducer. The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary<br>
methods and embodiments of the present invention. As will be understood by<br>
those familiar with the art, the invention may be embodied in other specific<br>
forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.<br>
