TITLE OF THE INVENTION WAVE-DISSIPATING BLOCK<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to wave-dissipating blocks made of concrete which are disposed near the shores of, for example, harbors, fishery harbors, seashores, and rivers and build wave-dissipating structures.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, building wave-dissipating structures by disposing and arranging wave-dissipating blocks near shores has been known in order to keep calm water surfaces in fishery harbors, seashores, rivers, etc. by blocking the waves that come from, for example, the open sea. [0003]<br>
Also, as a wave-dissipating block used for building a wave-dissipating structure, a wave-dissipating block made of concrete which is a block having four legs radially extending from the center and is composed so that the axis lines of the legs of the wave-dissipating blocks meet the centroid of the block has been conventionally known (for example, see Japanese<br><br>
Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai)   No. 2006-348572) . [0004]<br>
The wave-dissipating block described in above mentioned Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 2006-348572 has the structure in which the four legs each having a tapered shape having an inclined peripheral surface so that the cross-sectional area thereof is gradually reduced from a base end portion to a distal end portion are provided to extend radially from the center portion, at which the axis lines of<br>
the four legs are intersecting, at the interval of about 120Â°. [0005]<br>
In the invention described above in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai)   No. 2006-348572, the structure comprises the four legs radially extending from the center, and recessed portions, hollow portions, etc. for absorbing the energy of waves and maintaining the wave-dissipating effects are not particularly provided other than the four legs radially extending from the center. Also, recessed portions, hollows, etc. that form habitat environments of algae, fish and shellfish, etc. are not provided. [0006]<br>
Therefore, when wave-dissipating structures are to be built by using the wave-dissipating blocks described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai)  No. 2006-348572, arrangements which can promise further sufficient<br><br>
wave-dissipating effects and form various habitat environments of algae, fish and shellfish, etc. are also needed. Therefore, the construction operations are cumbersome, and a means for forming a habitat environment of algae, fish and shellfish, etc. has to be separately provided; thus, there has been a problem of high construction cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007]<br>
Thus, technical problems to be solved in order to provide wave-dissipating blocks capable of further improving the wave-dissipating effects and contributing to habitat environments of algae, fish and shellfish, etc. are occurred, and according to the present invention, these problems are solved. [0008]<br>
The present invention has been proposed in order to achieve the above described object, and the invention according to a first aspect provides a wave-dissipating block which is a block having four legs radially extending from a center and constituted so that axis lines of the legs of the block meet the centroid of the block; wherein a recessed portion is formed at a center part of an approximately horizontal surface constituted by the three legs among the four legs. [ 0 0 0 9 !<br><br>
According to this constitution, part of the water mass of a wave is absorbed by the recessed portion, and the water mass that flows out of the recessed portion and the water mass outside the recessed portion collide with each other. [0010]<br>
When the recessed portion is formed to have, for example, corners when viewed in a plan view, many corner portions are provided, algae readily adhere thereto, the bottom surfaces of the corner portions are at the positions recessed from the leg surfaces, and the impact of the wave is reduced. [0011]<br>
The invention according to a second aspect provides the wave-dissipating block, wherein the recessed portion comprises first recessed portions and a second recessed portion, the first recessed portions are formed along a peripheral portion of a base end part of each of the legs, and the second recessed portion is formed by providing a stepped portion inside the first recessed portions. [0012]<br>
According to this constitution, although water does not readily remains at the first recessed portions (upper step) since the first recessed portions are provided near the outer surface of the block, the water remains at the second recessed portion (lower step) since the second recessed portion is provided inside that is recessed than the first recessed<br><br>
portions, thereby forming a calm region and facilitating<br>
capture of spores of algae, etc.<br>
[0013]<br>
The invention according to a third aspect provides the wave-dissipating block, wherein minute irregularities are provided on the entirety or part of the inner surfaces of the first and second recessed portions. [0014]<br>
According to this constitution, the minute irregularities on the bottom surface facilitate adhesion of algae and shellfish such as abalones onto the bottom surface. [0015]<br>
The invention according to a fourth aspect provides a wave-dissipating block which is a block having four legs radially extending from a center and constituted so that axis lines of the legs of the block meet the centroid of the block, the wave-dissipating block having: a hollow retention portion formed at a center portion where the axis lines of the four legs intersect with one another; recessed portions each of which formed at a center part of an approximately horizontal surface constituted by the three legs among the four legs; and four tubular connecting portions connecting the interiors of the four recessed portions with the interior of the retention portion. [0016]<br><br>
According to this constitution, part of the water mass of a wave is absorbed by the recessed portions, and the water mass that flows out of the recessed portions and the water mass outside the recessed portions collide with each other. [0017]<br>
When the water mass that is part of the waves in bad weather reaches the retention portion through the recessed portions and the tubular connecting portions, the waves are rapidly contracted and rapidly expanded, thereby causing energy loss. Particularly, the water mass retained in the retention portion is discharged with a phase difference from the reflected wave at the time of undertows. [0018]<br>
Furthermore, when the recessedportion is formed to have, for example, corners when viewed in a plan view, many corner portions are provided, the bottom surfaces of the corner portions are at the positions recessed from the leg surfaces, and the impact of waves is reduced.  In addition, when it is calm, the hollow retention portion also serves as a spawning site or a habitat site of young fish, fish, and shellfish. [0019]<br>
The invention according to a fifth aspect provides the wave-dissipating block, wherein the recessed portion comprises first recessed portions and a second recessedportion, the first recessed portions are formed along a peripheral portion of a<br><br>
base end part of each of the legs, and the second recessed portion is formed by providing a stepped portion inside the first recessed portions. [0020]<br>
According to this constitution, although water does not readily remains at the first recessed portions (upper step) since the first recessed portions are provided near the outer surface of the block, water readily remains at the second recessed portion (lower step) since the second recessed portion is provided inside that is recessed than the first recessed portions, thereby facilitating the second recessed portion to capture spores of algae, etc. [0021]<br>
The invention according to a sixth aspect provides the wave-dissipating block, wherein minute irregularities are provided on the bottom surface of the second recessed portion. [0022]<br>
According to this constitution, the minute irregularities on the bottom surface facilitate adhesion of algae and shellfish such as abalones onto the bottom surface. [0023]<br>
In the invention according to the first aspect, the mutual collision of the water mass that flows out of the recessed portions and the water mass outside the recessed portions reduces the energy of waves, and the effect of facilitating wave<br><br>
dissipation can be expected. [0024]<br>
Moreover, since the impact of the waves is reduced at the deep parts of the recessed portions, an environment suitable for algae, fish, and shellfish to inhabit can be provided. Therefore, the means which has been conventionally provided separately from installation of wave-dissipating blocks for forming habitat environments of algae, fish, and shellfish becomes unnecessary, and the cost of construction, etc. can be reduced. [0025]<br>
In the invention according to the second aspect, water is caused to remain at the recessed second recessed portion, and the interior of the second recessed portion is facilitated to capture spores of algae, etc.; therefore, in addition to the effect of the invention of the first aspect, the environment suitable for algae, fish, and shellfish to inhabit is further improved. [0026]<br>
In the invention according to the third aspect, the minute irregularities on the bottom surface provided on the second recessed portion facilitate adhesion of algae and shellfish such as abalones onto the bottom surface; therefore, in addition to the effect of the invention according to the second aspect, the environment suitable for algae, fish, and shellfish to<br><br>
inhabit is also further improved.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the invention according to the fourth aspect, the mutual collision of the water mass that flows out of the recessed portions and the water mass outside the recessed portions reduces the energy of waves, and the effect of facilitating wave dissipation can be expected.<br>
[0028]<br>
In addition, the water mass that is part of the waves in bad weather reaches the retention portion through the recessed portions and the tubular connecting portions, the waves are rapidly contracted and rapidly expanded, thereby causing energy loss, and the effect of wave dissipation can be obtained. Particularly, the water mass retained in the retention portion is discharged with a phase difference from a reflected wave at the time of undertows; therefore, the wave dissipation effect is further enhanced.<br>
[0029]<br>
Furthermore, since the impact of waves is reduced at the deep parts of the recessed portions, an environment suitable for algae, fish, and shellfish to inhabit can be provided. Therefore, the means which has been conventionally provided separately from installation of wave-dissipating blocks for forming a habitat environment of algae, fish, and shellfish becomes unnecessary, and the cost of construction, etc. can be<br><br>
also reduced. [0030]<br>
In the invention according to the fifth aspect, water is caused to remain at the recessed second recessed portions so . that spores of algae, etc. are readily captured in the second recessed portions; therefore, in addition to the effect of the invention of the fourth aspect, the environment suitable for algae, fish, and shellfish to inhabit is also further improved. [0031]<br>
In the invention according to the sixth aspect, the minute irregularities on the bottom surface provided in the second recessed portions facilitate adhesion of algae and shellfish such as abalones onto the bottom surface; therefore, in addition to the effect of the invention of the fifth aspect, the environment suitable for algae, fish, and shellfish to inhabit is also further improved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0032]<br><br>
In order to achieve the object to provide a wave-dissipating block having high wave-dissipating effects and capable of contributing to the habitat environment of algae, fish and shellfish, etc., a block has four legs radially-extending from a center and is constituted so that axis lines of the legs of the block meet the centroid of the block; wherein a recessed portion is formed at a center part of an approximately horizontal surface constituted by the three legs among the four legs; thus, it is realized. [0033]<br>
Hereinafter, wave-dissipating blocks of the present invention will be described by suitable embodiments. FIG. 1 to FIG. 6 show a wave-dissipating block according to a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1 is a front view of the wave-dissipating block, FIG. 2 is a rear view, FIG. 3 is a right side view, FIG. 4 is a left side view, FIG. 5 is a plan view, and FIG. 6 is a bottom view. [0034]<br>
In FIG. 1 to FIG. 6, the wave-dissipating block 1 according to the present invention has four legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d which have the same shape and are integrally formed, for example, by pouring concrete into molds, and is composed as a four-leg body. The legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d are integrated by mutually joining base end portions 3a, 3a, 3a, and 3a thereof and are composed so that axis lines 4, 4, 4, and 4 of the legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and<br><br>
2d are caused to meet at the center 0 (centroid) of the wave-dissipating block 1, and the four legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d are radially extended from the center 0 at the interval of about 120Â°. [0035]<br>
Note that, in the present embodiment, the transverse cross section of each of the four legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d is formed to be a regular hexagon. Each of the legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d is formed to be like a tapered hexagonal pyramid having the transverse cross-sectional area that is gradually reduced from the base end portion 3a side to a distal end 3b, and the end face of the distal end portion 3b is cut and formed to be a flat surface. [0036]<br>
Each of the four parts where the base end portions 3a, 3a, and 3a of the three legs (in the case of FIG. 1, the legs 2a, 2b, and 2c) among the four legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d assemble is formed to have an approximately horizontal surface, and recessed portions 5, 5, 5, and 5 are provided at the center parts of the horizontal surfaces, respectively. Each of the recessed portions 5, 5, 5, and 5 comprises three first recessed portions 5a, 5a, and 5a which are formed to be discontinuous and divided from one another and one second recessed portion 5b provided at the inner part surrounded by the three first recessed portions 5a, 5a, and 5a.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
The first recessed portions 5a, 5a, and 5a are in the state in which cutout portions 6 are provided between the mutually adjacent legs (in the case of FIG. 1, between the legs 2a and 2b, the legs 2b and 2c, and 2c and 2a) among the three legs (in the case of FIG. 1, the legs 2a, 2b, and 2c), and three cutout portions are formed mutually between the legs (in the case of FIG. 1, the legs 2a and 2b, 2b and 2c, and 2c and 2a) and along the base end portions 3a, 3a, and 3a of the legs, respectively. Note that, the cutout portions 6 facilitate discharge of the water that enters inside the first recessed portions 5a to outside. [0038]<br>
Meanwhile, the second recessed portion 5b is formed in the state in which a stepped portion is provided inside the first recessed portions 5a in the inner part surrounded by the three first recessed portions 5a, 5a, and 5a, and the second recessed portion is recessed toward the center 0 side than the first recessed portions 5a, 5a, and 5a and is formed to have a shape having corners when viewed in a plane view. Moreover, on a bottom surface 8 of the second recessed portion 5b, unshown minute stripe-like irregularities are formed. [0039]<br>
The thus-constituted wave-dissipating blocks 1 are arranged and disposed in the water and ar the embankments near<br><br>
the shores of fishery harbors, sea shores, rivers, etc. so as to build wave-dissipating structures. Note that, in building of the wave-dissipating structures, the wave-dissipating blocks 1 are not limited to a single-step arrangement, and the blocks are sometimes arranged in several steps. [0040]<br>
When waves come toward the wave-dissipating block 1, the wave-dissipating block 1 installed in water takes part of the water mass of the wave forming the waves into the recessed portion 5, which is recessed than the surfaces of the legs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d, so as to absorb the energy of the wave, and the water mass flowing out from the recessed portion 5 and the water mass outside the recessed portion 5 collide with each other; thus, the energy of the wave is reduced so as to contribute to wave dissipation. [0041]<br>
The recessed portion 5 reduces the impact of the wave; and, at the same time, although water does not readily stay at the first recessed portions (upper steps) 5a, 5a, and 5a since they are provided near the outer surface of the block 1, water readily stays at the second recessed portion (lower step) 5b since it is provided inside that is recessed than the first recessed portions 5a, 5a, and 5a, and spores of algae or the like are captured by the second recessed portion 5b so as to form various habitat environments of algae, fish and shellfish,<br><br>
etc. Furthermore, since the minute stripe-like irregularity surface is provided on the bottom surface 8, the surface of the minute irregularities facilitates adhesion of algae and shellfish such as abalones. [0042]<br>
FIG. 7 to FIG. 14 show a wave-dissipating block according to a second embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 7 is a front view of the wave-dissipating block, FIG. 8 is a rear view, FIG. 9 is a right side view, FIG. 10 is a left side view, FIG. 11 is a plan view, FIG. 12 is a bottom view, FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view taken from the line A-A of FIG. 12; and FIG. 14 is a cross-sectional view taken from the line B-B of FIG. 12. [0043]<br>
In FIG. 7 to FIG. 14, in the constitution of the wave-dissipating block 10 in the second embodiment of the present invention, a hollow retention portion 11 is provided at a center portion of the wave-dissipating block 1 of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 6, and four tubular connecting portions 12, 12, 12, and 12 connecting the interior of the retention portion 11 with the interiors of the four recessed portions 5, 5, 5, and 5, respectively, are provided; and, since the other constitution is same as FIG. 1 to FIG. 6, the same constituent parts are denoted by the same reference numerals, and redundant explanations will be omitted.<br><br>
[0044]<br>
As shown in FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, the retention portion 11 comprises a hollow portion provided at the center of the wave-dissipating block 10. [0045]<br>
The tubular connecting portion 12 is a path having one end side that is open at the center portion of the bottom surface 8 of the second recessed portion 5b and the other end side that is open to the interior of the retention portion 11 and is formed to be hexagonal in the transverse cross section in the present embodiment.  In addition, each of the tubular connecting portions 12 is formed to have a tapered shape having the transverse cross-sectional area that is gradually reduced from the recessed portion 5 side to the retention portion 11. [0046]<br>
When waves come toward the wave-dissipating block 10 in the state it is installed in the water, the thus-constituted wave-dissipating block 10 takes part of the water mass of the wave forming the waves into the recessed portion 5 that is recessed than the surfaces of the legs 2 and takes part of the wave into the retention portion 11 through the tubular connecting portions 12 so as to absorb the energy of the wave. In addition, the water mass that flows out of the recessed portion 5 and the water mass outside the recessed portion 5 collide with each other, thereby reducing the energy of the wave<br><br>
and contributing to wave dissipation.<br>
[0047]<br>
Particularly, since the retention portion 11 at the center portion and the four recessed portions 5 are mutually communicated via the tubular connecting portions 12, respectively, the waves in bad weather are rapidly contracted and rapidly expanded in the path (the recessed portions 5 and the tubular connecting portions 12), which reaches to the retention portion 11, so as to lose the energy thereof and dissipate the wave.  Particularly, the water mass retained in the retention portion 11 is discharged with a phase difference from a reflected wave at the time of undertows; therefore, the wave-dissipating effect is further enhanced. When it is calm, the interior of the retention portion 11 contributes as a spawning site or habitat site of young fish, fish, and shellfish.<br>
[0048]<br>
Note that, various modifications can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit of the present invention, and it goes without saying that the present invention pertains to the modifications.<br>
