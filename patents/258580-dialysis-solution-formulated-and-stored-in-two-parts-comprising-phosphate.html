Dialysis solution,  formulated and stored in two parts,<br>
comprising phosphate.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a medical solution, a method for producing and use thereof. Particularly the present invention relates to a medical solution for dialysis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dialysis is the indicated treatment for patients whose kidney function is failing. The removal of waste substances from the blood is effected by transfer to an external fluid or replacement of plasma liquid by an external fluid. Various dialysis techniques, with associated dialysis fluids, can be differentiated, which are used depending on the type of patient. In the case of patients suffering from long-term renal insufficiency, the dialysis technique used is usually an intermittent treatment of few times (2 to 3 times) per week for a few hours (3 to 5 hours). With this technique, known as hemodialysis, waste substances, in particular urea, salts and other small molecules, are removed from the blood by means of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane. Another form of dialysis is peritoneal dialysis. In contrast to hemodialysis, where the blood is passed over a dialysis fluid in a dialysis unit (artificial kidney) outside the body, in the case of peritoneal dialysis a dialysis fluid is introduced into a patient's abdominal cavity (peritoneum), wherein the peritoneum is acting as a semi-permeable membrane.<br>
In the case of patients suffering from acute renal insufficiency, a continuous treatment, throughout the entire day for several weeks, a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), is the indicated treatment. A technique other than hemodialysis, specifically hemofiltration, is used for this. In the case of hemofiltration, waste substances are removed from the blood by means of convective flow through a highly permeable membrane. In this way the above-mentioned waste substances are removed in larger amounts andlarge(r) molecules are also removed. In addition, in the case of hemofiltration and appreciable quantity of liquid, which can vary from 1 to 5 liters per hour, is removed from the bloodstream. In contrast to hemodialysis, this demands that in the case of hemofiltration a replacement fluid must be returned to the patient in large quantities. Optionally a combination of dialysis and filtration can be used. This is called hemodiafiltration. A specific type of hemodiafiltration is continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, abbreviation as CWHDF.<br><br>
Under certain circumstances, in patients receiving regular thrice-weeWy hemodialysis treatments and more frequently in patients undergoing CRRT Hypophosphatemia could occur. In the first case it is mainly due to an excessive ingestion of phosphate binders, inadequate administration of phosphate salts in parenteral nutrition and continued removal of phosphorus by dialysis. In the second case it is mainly a consequence of the efficient removal of phosphorus from patients having normal renal function from the beginning and thus a normal serum phosphorus level.<br>
Hypophosphatemia is prevented and treated principally via the oral and<br>
the intravenous routes, for example by ingestion of phosphorus-rich foodstuffs, by<br>
oral phosphorus preparations or by intravenous administration of sodium (or<br>
potassium) phosphate salts. However the administration of phosphorus via oral and<br>
intravenous routes must be carried out with great caution, since it is impossible to<br>
determine the precise magnitude of the total phosphorus deficit, it is difficult to<br>
decide the correct amount of phosphorus to be administered to the patient. If too<br>
much phosphorus is administered hyperphosphatemia might develop, having serious<br>
consequences for the patient, for example hypocalcaemia, metastatic calcification and<br>
hypotensions, and if too little phosphorus is administered the hypophosphatemia is<br>
not corrected.	c<br>
JTho uoo offlgolution containing both calcium ions and phosphate is used \m colution^for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The TPN solutions is packed in multi-compartment bags with lipids in a first compartment, amino acids and phosphate and most of the electrolytes except calcium in a second compartment, and a third compartment containing calcium and glucose. The main difference compared to a medical solution according to the invention is that the pH of the final, ready-for-use solutions is much lower than in the solutions [showed iffiEs invention^The TPN solutions normally have a pH between 5.2-6.<br>
In US 6,743,191 a substitution infusion fluid is disclosed, which infusion fluid comprises among other 0.2-1.0 mM dihydrogen phosphate ions, preferably 0.5-0.9 mM, and 1.6-2.6 mM calcium ions, preferably 1.9-24. The substitution infusion fluid according to this disclosure may conveniently be prepared by dissolving salts in water in such amounts that the desired concentrations are reached, as is well within the expertise of the normal person skilled in the art. During the preparation it is desired that a sterile environment be maintained.<br>
In US 6,017,942 an intravenous solution for treating patient with chronic renal failure is disclosed, which solution comprises among other approximate 0-20 mM phosphate and approximate 0-10 mM calcium. This solution is to be administered 1-3 times per day.<br><br>
The problem when introducing phosphorus in a medical solution is the formation of various calcium phosphates that precipitate and the risk for precipitation is further increased if the fluid is exposed to terminal heat sterilization. The solubility of calcium phosphates depends on the concentrations of calcium and phosphate, respectively, and further on the presence of other electrolytes, temperature and pH. As long as the pH is about 5.2-6, as in the TPN solutions, there is no risk of precipitation, but in physiological solutions with pH values equal to physiological. pH of about 7-7.6, the risk of precipitation is enhanced. Accordingly, it is not only the pH during sterilization and storage that need to be controlled, also the pH in a mixed and ready-for-use solution needs to be controlled. The problem is also that many of these fluids should be stable during long-term storage, up to two years.<br>
In one of the above-identified references this is solved by having the composition for the solution as a powder up until use and then dissolve it in a fluid before administration. However, even if trying to maintain sterility according to the European pharmacopoeia to thereby avoid the risk of infection in a patient, this is not an optimal way to maintain sterility. If a package is brought in connection with the atmosphere by e.g. injecting a solution component into a bag with a solution, this solution is no longer a sterile solution. Instead it is an aseptic solution, and aseptic solutions as such are not allowed to be infused into a patient.<br>
The best way would be to have the solution terminal sterilized in its packaging in order to make sure that the solution is as sterile as possible and to be kept in this sterile environment also during mixing into a ready-for-use solution without opening up the bag and expose the content therein for contamination.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that during specific circumstances, concentrations, pH ranges and packaging, a sterile, stabile phosphate containing medical solution could be provided, and it is this which constitute the base for the present invention.<br>
One of the more important matters searching for the most favorable circumstances, concentrations, pH ranges and packaging is the formation of particles during production, storage and preparation for a ready-for-use solution. The amount of particles has to stay in between specific ranges both concerning the size of the particles as well as the amount of particles. This is specified within the European Pharmacopoeia, and for particles in the size of 10 jam the limit is 25 counts/nil. It is very important that the particle formation is kept to a minimum, otherwise the immune system could get triggered, which could lead to start of the inflammatory cascade. A further problem with the presence of particle is the risk of clogging the filters, which are used during the dialysis treatment<br>
The main components that give rise to the problem of particle formation are calcium ions in combination with either carbonate and/or phosphate.<br>
The first instant thought to solve the problem is of course to keep calcium ions separated from carbonate and phosphate during production and storage, but the problem is still there when preparing the ready-for-use solution, whereby the formation of solid calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate still could be formed during mixing.<br>
The present inventors have found that, with a phosphate concentration of up to about 2.8 mM in the ready-for-use solution, the amount of formed particles<br><br>
are within the allowed limits if the pH value in the ready-for-use solution is kept to at most 7.4, preferably at most 7.2.<br>
If the phosphate concentration is up to about 1.3 mM in the ready-for-use solution an allowed amount of particles are formed if the pH value in the ready-for-use solution is kept to at most 7.6, preferably at most 7.4.<br>
The present inventors have also found that calcium and phosphate could be kept together during preparation and storage if these two components are kept in a compartment with a pH below 2.5, preferably below 1.5, and most preferably below or equal to 1.3.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the medical solution is before use divided into at least two single solutions, a first single solution and a second single, wherein said first and second single solutions, after terminal sterilization and up on use, are to be mixed to form a final solution with a pH of 6.5-7.6.<br>
Said first single solution comprises at least one buffer chosen from the group comprising acetate, lactate, citrate, pyruvate, carbonate and bicarbonate and said second single solution comprises an acid.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention said first single solution comprises bicarbonate and carbonate in such proportions that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, C02, in the first single solution is of the same order of magnitude as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, COa, of the atmosphere. Bicarbonate and carbonate are preferably mixed as sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate, and in one embodiment said first single solution has a pH within the range of 10.1-10.5, preferably 10.3,<br>
By adjusting the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, CO2, in the first single solution in the same order of magnitude as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, C02, in the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide in the compartment for the first single solution stays within the bag compartment and does not enter out of the bag material out into the atmosphere, as the partial pressure of C02 within the liquid is in equilibrium with the partial pressure of C02 in the atmosphere.<br>
After having mixed said first and second single solutions in this embodiment into a ready-for-use solution, said ready-for-use solution has a pH within the range of 7.0-7.6. Further, said ready-for-use solution preferably has a bicarbonate concentration of at least 25 mM, preferably at least 30 mM, and at most 45 mM, preferably at most 40 mM.<br>
However, the combination of bicarbonate/carbonate in said first single solution could in another embodiment, as stated above, be exchanged to or supplemented by one or more of the buffers chosen from the group comprising acetate, lactate, citrate and pyruvate. In one embodiment, the buffer is bicarbonate in<br><br>
a concentration of 25-35 mM with optionally 0-15 mM lactate added, wherein the concentration given is the concentration in the ready-for-use solution.<br>
In one embodiment said second single solution preferably has a pH within the range of 1.0-1.5, most preferably a pH of 1.3. In one embodiment of the invention said second single solution comprises HCL<br>
In one embodiment said ready-for-use solution further comprises one or more electrolytes. The electrolytes are one or more of the ions of sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium and/or chloride. The arrangement of the electrolytes in the different compartments is dependent on the different electrolytes co-behavior with the other substances present in said single solutions, i.e. whether some sort of reaction could occur between one or more of the electrolyte(s) and the other substances present in a specific single solution. Usually, the electrolytes are contained in said second single solution. For example, calcium ions and magnesium ions are preferably provided in any of the other single solutions, but said first single solution when said first single solution comprise the combination of bicarbonate/carbonate, only bicarbonate and/or phosphate. The reason for this is that calcium and magnesium and bicarbonate/carbonate, bicarbonate and/or phosphate together could cause precipitation of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium phosphate and magnesium phosphate. However, calcium ions and magnesium ions could be kept with bicarbonate under certain circumstances, such as specific pH ranges and so on, this is for example disclosed in EP 0 437 274, which hereby is enclosed by reference. Further calcium and magnesium could be kept with phosphate also under certain circumstances, see above of this.<br>
Sodium ions and/or chloride ions, on the other hand, are usually arranged in both said first and said second single solutions.<br>
Said medical solution could further comprise glucose or glucose-like compounds, and in one embodiment the glucose or glucose-like compounds is arranged in said second single solution. During sterilization and storage glucose or glucose-like compounds should be kept at a low pH value in order to ensure that the formation of glucose degradation products (GDPs) are kept to a minimum. In one embodiment the pH in the second single solution is below 2.5.<br>
In the method for producing a medical solution according to above, said single solutions are provided in separate compartments. Thereafter said single solutions are terminally sterilized. Preferably, the terminal sterilization is heat sterilization and/or radiation sterilization, (see also European Pharmacopoeia 1977 for a review of different sterilization techniques). In one embodiment of the method according to the invention, the terminal sterilization is heat sterilization at a temperature of at least ioo°C, preferably at least 121°C.<br><br>
The sterilization time may vary depending on the sterilization temperature, the type of container and the contents therein to be sterilized.<br>
The radiation sterilization may be either ionising or non-ionising sterilization. Examples of ionising sterilization are gamma and beta radiation. Examples of non-ionising radiation sterilization is UV radiation.<br>
The medical solution according to the present invention has the advantage of ensuring good stability and good biocompatibility.<br>
Said single solutions could be provided in different compartments in a multi-compartment bag, and the mixing could be provided by having the different compartments coupled by frangible pins, which pins could be broken in order to mix the content in the different compartments within the multi-compartment bag. The mixing could further be provided by having a peal seal in-between the different compartments, which peal seals could be pealed in order to mix the content in the different compartments.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Below you will find different examples of solutions according to the present invention.<br>
Example l<br>
The following pairs of single solutions were prepared according to the table 1-5 below. The volume relationship between the first single solutions and the second single solutions are 1:20.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example g<br>
In order to find out the optimal pH ranges for the ready-for-use solution in order to keep the formation of particles to a minimum the following pair of single solutions according to table 7 was prepared and mixed. The volume relation between the first single solution and the second single solution is 1:20.<br><br>
The mixed solution was split in two parts, and 1,3 mM NaH2P04 were added to one part and 2,6 mM NaH2P04 were added to the other part. The two different solutions were pooled in 50 ml glass bottles and in each group of bottles with the two different concentrations of NaH2P04 the pH was adjusted to 6.8,7.0, 7.2,7.4,7.6,7.8,8.0, and 8.2. The amount of particles was measured 24 hours later.<br>
In the enclosed figures 1A-1C the results from this measurements are seen for the solution containing 1.3 mM phosphate. In the enclosed figures 2A-2B the results form this measurements are seen for the solution containing 2.6 mM phosphate.<br>
As evident from the figures, the pH in a ready-for-use solution with a phosphate concentration of 1.3 mM should be below or equal to 7.6, preferably below or equal to 7.4. In a ready-for-use solution with a phosphate concentration of 2.6 mM the pH should be below or equal to 7.4, preferably below or equal to 7.2. Particle formation is normally first observed in the very small size and than they aggregate and form larger particles. The chosen pH upper limits of 7-4 and 7.6, respectively, is based on changes in the particle profile rather than on absolute values. All measured particle sizes where included in the evaluation with some extra focus on the small particles preceding the formation of larger particles.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
In order to find out the optimal upper limit for the phosphate concentration for the ready-for-use solution in order to keep the formation of particles to a minimum, the following pair of single solutions according to table 8 was prepared. The volume relationship between the first and the second single solution was 1:20.<br><br>
The first and second single solutions were mixed and split in 5 different parts and phosphate was added in the following concentrations 2.6, 2.8,3.0,3.5 and 4.0. pH was adjusted to 7.6 and the amount of particles was measured at o hour and 24 hours after mixing.<br>
The results are shown in fig 3A-C, and from the figures it could be concluded that the solution is stable during 24 hours at a phosphate concentration less or equal to 2.8 mM phosphate and a pH of 7.6.<br>
Accordingly, by having a phosphate concentration of 1.0-2.8 in a final ready-for-use solution with a pH of 6.5-7.6 a sterile, stable phosphate containing medical solution could be provided.<br>
Example 4<br>
The following pairs of single solutions were prepared according to the tables 9-11 and constitute different embodiments of the present invention. The volume relationship between the first single solution and the second single solution in these pairs of solutions are 20:1. Accordingly, this time the second single solution has the small volume and the first single solution has the larger volume.<br><br><br>
