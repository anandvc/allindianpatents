				<td>The invention relates to a honeycomb body having<br>
passages, through which a fluid can flow and which<br>
extend between two end faces, and having at least one<br>
measurement sensor, which at least partially extends<br>
into the honeycomb body. The invention also proposes an<br>
exhaust system which includes a honeycomb body of this<br>
type.<br>
Honeycomb bodies, the basic design of which is known,<br>
for example, from EP 0 245 73 7, EP 0 43 0 945 and<br>
GB 1,452,982, are used for numerous applications in the<br>
automotive industry, in particular as catalyst support<br>
bodies in the treatment of exhaust gas. In view of the<br>
fact that permitted pollutant concentration limits in<br>
exhaust gas from an automobile released to the<br>
environment are being constantly reduced by<br>
legislation, methods which allow control of an exhaust-<br>
gas treatment process are becoming increasingly<br>
important. The measurement sensors which such control<br>
requires and which make it possible, for example, to<br>
determine the exhaust-gas composition or pollutant<br>
concentrations in the exhaust gas, are an important<br>
part of an exhaust-gas treatment system with controlled<br>
operation. Consequently, honeycomb bodies which are<br>
able to accommodate one or more measurement sensors and<br>
therefore provide data for controlling the catalytic<br>
treatment, as are known for example from<br>
DE 88 16 154 Ul, are an important element in exhaust-<br>
gas treatment systems with controlled operation.<br>
Suitable measurement sensors are, for example, sensors<br>
which are used to determine the exhaust-gas<br>
composition, such as for example lambda sensors and<br>
hydrocarbon sensors (HC sensors), which measure the<br>
hydrocarbon content of the exhaust gas. Furthermore, it<br>
is also possible to use what are known as nitrogen<br><br>
oxide sensors which determine the level of the nitrogen<br>
oxides in the exhaust gas.<br>
Measurement sensors of this type are used in particular<br>
in conjunction with what is known as on-board diagnosis<br>
(OBD) . The purpose of OBD is to continuously monitor<br>
the components which are of relevance to the exhaust<br>
gas in the vehicles, the intention being to immediately<br>
recognize and indicate significant increases in<br>
emissions over the lifetime of each vehicle. This is<br>
intended to ensure permanently low exhaust-gas<br>
emissions.<br>
When  monitoring  the  functionality  of  a  catalytic<br>
converter, it is preferable to determine the oxygen<br>
concentration  in  the  exhaust  gas  upstream  and<br>
downstream of the catalytic converter. To do this, it<br>
is customary for a lambda sensor for determining the<br>
oxygen content to be positioned upstream and downstream<br>
of a .catalytic converter. With the aid of the lambda<br>
sensor arranged upstream of the catalytic converter, it<br>
is possible in particular to draw conclusions as to the<br>
air/fuel mix fed to the internal combustion engine. The<br>
sensor connected downstream of the catalytic converter<br>
generates, for example, a comparison value based on the<br>
oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas, so that it is<br>
possible to draw conclusions as to the functionality of<br>
the  catalytic  converter.  The  oxygen  is  at  least<br>
partially used to convert pollutants contained in the<br>
exhaust gas,  and therefore a low concentration of<br>
oxygen at the exit of the catalytic converter indicates<br>
effective conversion.<br>
A particular problem with measurement sensors of this<br>
type, in addition to the additional space which they<br>
take up, is that they react very sensitively to<br>
different ambient conditions, as also occur under<br>
certain   circumstances   in   exhaust   systems.   In<br><br>
particular, the sensitivity to water or water vapor<br>
needs to be mentioned, as well as the high temperatures<br>
prevailing in the aggressive environment, which can<br>
lead to undesirably rapid aging of the measurement<br>
sensor. However, in particular with a view to OBD, it<br>
is necessary for the sensors for controlling the<br>
exhaust-gas properties and/or monitoring the components<br>
in the exhaust system to remain functional for a<br>
prolonged period of time.<br>
Working on this basis, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to overcome the known technical problems with<br>
regard to arranging measurement sensors in exhaust<br>
systems. In particular, it is intended to propose a<br>
position or form of arrangement of measurement sensors<br>
which ensure long-term use of the measurement sensors<br>
in the exhaust system of mobile internal combustion<br>
engines. The intention is that measured value results<br>
which are as precise and accurate as possible and can<br>
be used to control the exhaust-gas components should be<br>
deliverable. Furthermore, it is intended to propose an<br>
exhaust system which has a particularly space-saving<br>
and functional arrangement of a honeycomb body with a<br>
measurement sensor.<br>
These objects are achieved by a honeycomb body having<br>
the features of patent claim 1 and by an exhaust system<br>
comprising a honeycomb body of this type having the<br>
features of patent claim 20. Further advantageous<br>
configurations are described in the respective<br>
dependent patent claims. At this point, it should be<br>
noted that the features disclosed therein can be<br>
combined with one another in any technologically<br>
appropriate way, in particular even independently of<br>
the way in which they are referred back in the patent<br>
claims.<br><br>
The honeycomb body according to the invention has<br>
passages, through which a fluid can flow and which<br>
extend between two end faces, and at least one<br>
measurement sensor, which at least partially extends<br>
into the honeycomb body. A part-volume of the honeycomb<br>
body is defined between a first end face and the at<br>
least one first measurement sensor. The honeycomb body<br>
is distinguished by the fact that it has a lower<br>
capacity to take up oxygen in the first part-volume<br>
than in at least one further part-volume.<br>
The honeycomb body can in principle be produced from<br>
various materials, in particular from ceramic or<br>
metallic material. It is preferably to be understood as<br>
a body which comprises a multiplicity of passages which<br>
are arranged next to one another and extend<br>
substantially parallel to one another. The term passage<br>
does not necessarily mean a continuous flow passage,<br>
but rather also encompasses other forms of flow paths<br>
through the honeycomb body. The most important<br>
criterion is that the fluid be divided into a<br>
multiplicity of partial fluid flows when it comes into<br>
contact with an end face of the honeycomb body, with<br>
these partial fluid flows being routed separately from<br>
one another at least in the vicinity of the end faces,<br>
in particular for the first 2 mm to 3 mm. The term<br>
fluid in principle encompasses both gaseous and liquid<br>
substances, although in this context it is preferably a<br>
gas stream, in particular an exhaust-gas stream from a<br>
mobile internal combustion engine (spark-ignition<br>
engine or diesel engine or the like).<br>
The at least one measurement sensor may be any known<br>
type of measurement sensor which is used in connection<br>
with the control or monitoring of exhaust-gas<br>
components of mobile internal combustion engines. This<br>
includes in particular lambda sensors, HC measurement<br>
sensors,    temperature   sensors,   nitrogen   oxide<br><br>
measurement sensors or the like. This at least one<br>
measurement sensor at least partially extends into the<br>
honeycomb body, in other words the at least one<br>
measurement sensor is placed against a lateral surface<br>
of the honeycomb body and preferably extends radially<br>
inward. For a detailed description of the way in which<br>
it is actually arranged, reference is made to the<br>
explanations given below.<br>
A first part-volume is defined by the first end face,<br>
which represents the gas entry side for the use of the<br>
honeycomb body in the exhaust system of a mobile<br>
internal combustion engine, and the at least one<br>
measurement sensor. The part-volume in particular<br>
comprises all passages and their walls. It extends from<br>
the first end face as far as a cross section through<br>
the honeycomb body which is arranged parallel to the<br>
first end face and extends through the closest point of<br>
the measurement sensor to the first end face.<br>
Consequently, the first part-volume is described by the<br>
first end face, this cross section which has just been<br>
described and the lateral surface of the honeycomb body<br>
in between.<br>
According to the invention, the honeycomb body has a<br>
lower  capacity to take up oxygen in this first part-<br>
volume than in at least one further part-volume.<br>
Therefore, it will firstly be clear that the first<br>
measurement sensor is located within the interior of<br>
the honeycomb body, i.e. deviates from the known<br>
principle of the measurement sensor connected upstream<br>
or downstream. The integration of the measurement<br>
sensor means that the latter is not directly exposed to<br>
the extreme thermal and dynamic stresses in the exhaust<br>
system of an internal combustion engine. In this way,<br>
it is possible in particular to reduce premature<br>
thermal aging and the risk of what is known as "water<br>
shocks", since the exhaust gas comes into contact with<br><br>
the honeycomb body first of all and only subsequently<br>
with the measurement sensor. With a view to the use of<br>
a measurement sensor of this type as part of OBD, it is<br>
particularly  important  for  the  first  measurement<br>
sensor, which is, for example, a lambda sensor, to come<br>
into contact with a composition of the exhaust-gas<br>
stream which still permits conclusions to be drawn as<br>
to  the  underlying  air/fuel  mix.  Therefore,  it  is<br>
proposed here that the honeycomb body have a low<br>
capacity to take up oxygen in the part-volume. The<br>
result of this is that insufficient oxygen required for<br>
virtually 100% conversion of the pollutants contained<br>
in the exhaust-gas stream is available in this first<br>
part-volume.  Consequently,  the conversion rates are<br>
considerably lower  in  this  first part-volume,  for<br>
example less than 85%, in particular less than 75% and<br>
even less than 5 0%. Therefore, characteristic values of<br>
the exhaust gas which provide information as to the<br>
fuel/air mix used can still be recorded by the first<br>
measurement sensor.<br>
According to a further configuration of the honeycomb<br>
body, the first part-volume at least in part has a<br>
first coating. A coating of this type is preferably<br>
applied to the passage walls and itself has a capacity<br>
to take up oxygen. The coating may be identical or<br>
different over the entire cross section and the entire<br>
length of the first part-volume in terms of its coating<br>
thickness, the type of coating, the coating surface<br>
area or further parameters. It is also possible for<br>
regions which do not have any coating to exist in the<br>
part-volume. Suitable coatings also include, for<br>
example, support layers for catalytically active<br>
materials, such as for example washcoat.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that an exchange of fluid<br>
flows between adjacent passages is ensured in the first<br>
part-volume. In other words, the partial fluid flows<br><br>
which are formed in the vicinity of the end face of the<br>
honeycomb body are at least partially mixed with one<br>
another in the first part-volume. For this purpose, it<br>
is necessary for the passages arranged adjacent to one<br>
another to be provided with means which allow such an<br>
exchange of fluid flows.<br>
In this context, it is preferably proposed that at<br>
least in the first part-volume apertures, in particular<br>
with a mean diameter in the range from 2 mm to 10 mm,<br>
are provided in the passage walls. The apertures can in<br>
principle comprise any conceivable shapes, in<br>
particular round, polygonal, oval or similar holes,<br>
slots, perforations or the like. In view of the wide<br>
range of forms which apertures of this type can take, a<br>
mean diameter is to be understood as meaning a mean<br>
value for the distance between the opposite edge of the<br>
apertures which lies between the maximum extent and the<br>
minimum extent. In this context, it should be noted<br>
that the apertures do not have to be formed uniformly<br>
over the part-volume, but rather it is possible for the<br>
apertures to be varied in terms of their form, size or<br>
distribution in the first part-volume.<br>
To ensure an exchange of fluid flows between adjacent<br>
passages, it is also proposed that the apertures, at<br>
least in the first part-volume, are provided with<br>
microstructures, which are preferably used to divert<br>
the fluid in a direction which is transverse to an axis<br>
of the honeycomb body. A microstructure is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning structures which,<br>
starting from the passage walls, extend into inner<br>
regions of the passage or toward adjacent passage<br>
walls. These microstructures preferably have a height<br>
which is less than the height of the passage itself.<br>
Suitable microstructures include studs, stamp<br>
formations, guide surfaces, vanes, grooves, bumps or<br>
the like.<br><br>
Microstructures of this type are preferably used to<br>
generate pressure  differences  in  adjacent  passages<br>
which cause the partial fluid stream to flow from one<br>
passage to the adjacent passage. A suitable arrangement<br>
of the microstructures with respect to one another<br>
allows uniform mixing of the fluid, with the result<br>
that,  for  example,  regions  with particularly high<br>
concentrations,  as  may  for  example  also  occur<br>
individually  in  exhaust-gas  streams,  are  avoided.<br>
Rather, a virtually uniform concentration distribution<br>
of a pollutant or a component of  the  fluid over<br>
virtually the entire cross section of the honeycomb<br>
body is provided. If a fluid stream which has been<br>
mixed in this manner is brought into contact with the<br>
downstream  measurement  sensor,  it  is  possible  to<br>
provide more accurate statements as to the composition<br>
of the fluid stream.<br>
According to a further configuration, the first part-<br>
volume forms in the range of less than 30%, in<br>
particular in the range from 10% to 25%, of the total<br>
volume of the honeycomb body. In this case, the total<br>
volume is to be understood as meaning the volume of the<br>
honeycomb body, which is defined by the two end faces<br>
and the lateral surface and encompasses both the<br>
passages and their walls or coatings, etc. At this<br>
point, it should be noted that the honeycomb body does<br>
not necessarily have to cylindrical in form. Rather,<br>
oval, conical, polygonal or similar shapes of honeycomb<br>
bodies are also known. If the honeycomb body has a<br>
housing, the housing does not count as part of the<br>
total volume of the honeycomb body.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the first part-volume<br>
has a length of from 10 mm to 40 mm, starting from the<br>
first end face. This length may be sufficient on the<br>
one hand to provide a sufficient contact area for water<br><br>
vapor contained in the exhaust-gas stream or water<br>
entrained therein and at the same time (in particular<br>
when providing apertures) to effect sufficient mixing<br>
of the exhaust-gas stream. This length detail<br>
preferentially relates to honeycomb bodies which have a<br>
total length of over 100 mm.<br>
It is preferably also proposed that a single<br>
measurement sensor is provided, this measurement sensor<br>
being a lambda sensor. In other words, in this case the<br>
result is a honeycomb body which has only a single<br>
measurement sensor, designed as a lambda sensor, which,<br>
however, can at the same time also be used to carry out<br>
OBD. This single lambda sensor makes it possible, for<br>
example, to detect unburnt hydrocarbons, which occur in<br>
particular after the mobile internal combustion engine<br>
has been started or restarted (known as a "cold<br>
start").<br>
According to a further configuration, the honeycomb<br>
body, starting from its lateral surface, has a recess,<br>
extending radially in the direction of its axis, for<br>
accommodating the measurement sensor, this recess<br>
preferably having a maximum extent in the range from<br>
15 mm to 35 mm and/or a depth in the range from 15 mm<br>
to 40 mm.<br>
The term "lateral surface" is to be understood in<br>
particular as meaning the envelope of the honeycomb<br>
body which is arranged between the two end faces. The<br>
"axis" of the honeycomb body relates in particular to a<br>
center axis, which preferably extends through the<br>
center points of the two end faces. The "recess" or its<br>
center axis extends from the lateral surface preferably<br>
radially toward the axis. Although at this point it<br>
should be noted that this recess may also be arranged<br>
skew or obliquely with respect to the axis of the<br>
honeycomb  body,  a  radial  extent  constitutes  an<br><br>
embodiment which is preferred here, since in this way a<br>
relatively deep penetration of the measurement sensor<br>
can be achieved.<br>
To ensure that the measurement sensor extends<br>
sufficiently far into inner regions of the honeycomb<br>
body yet at the same time does not constitute an<br>
undesirably major flow resistance, the dimensions<br>
indicated should be complied with. In this context, the<br>
"maximum extent" is arranged substantially in a cross<br>
section of the recess and describes the distance<br>
between the opposite points of the recess arranged<br>
furthest away from one another. The "depth" extends<br>
radially inward from the lateral surface and in this<br>
direction describes the dimension of the recess. The<br>
number of recesses of this type in the honeycomb body<br>
is to be selected taking account of the number of<br>
measurement sensors used. Under certain circumstances,<br>
however, it is also possible for a plurality of<br>
measurement sensors to be arranged in one recess.<br>
Moreover, it is also proposed that the shape of the<br>
recess is oval-cylindrical, quadrilateral or narrows<br>
conically in the direction of the axis. For details as<br>
to the production of recesses of this type in honeycomb<br>
bodies which comprise a plurality of at least partially<br>
structured sheet-metal foils, reference should be made<br>
in particular to the content of disclosure of<br>
WO 02/075126, the content of which is hereby<br>
incorporated in full by reference in the subject matter<br>
of the present description, and reference can be made<br>
to this content of disclosure in full in particular for<br>
a more detailed explanation of the invention.<br>
In addition, it is proposed that the recess is at least<br>
partially surrounded by a rim which does not permit<br>
exchange of adjacent flows, in particular does have any<br>
apertures, this rim preferably having a width in the<br><br>
range from 1 mm to 5 mm. The configuration of the<br>
recess with a rim of this type means that its external<br>
shape is not delimited by especially fissured passage<br>
walls. This could lead to particularly fine subregions<br>
of the passage walls being freely exposed to the<br>
extreme environmental conditions. On account of the<br>
ensuing pressure fluctuations, subregions could become<br>
detached or cracks could form, which would then<br>
propagate through the passage wall. The provision of<br>
the rim means that stable passage edge regions are<br>
provided in the immediate vicinity of the recess, so as<br>
to ensure long-term use of honeycomb bodies of this<br>
type.<br>
The invention also proposes a honeycomb body, in which<br>
there is a second measurement sensor, which is arranged<br>
between a first measurement sensor - which is arranged<br>
near the first end face and is designed as a lambda<br>
sensor - and the second end face, a second part-volume<br>
being formed between the second measurement sensor and<br>
the first measurement sensor, and a third part-volume<br>
being formed between the second measurement sensor and<br>
the second end face.<br>
In this respect, the honeycomb body has two measurement<br>
sensors, which at least in part project into other<br>
regions. The measurement sensors, which are preferably<br>
each arranged in a cross-sectional plane parallel to at<br>
least one end face of the honeycomb body, in this case<br>
define different part-volumes of the honeycomb body.<br>
The  first  measurement  sensor  preferably  has  the<br>
function of generating certain characteristic variables<br>
which provide information as to the fluid flowing in.<br>
This means that it is possible to ascertain knowledge<br>
as  to  the  composition,  concentration  differences,<br>
temperatures, etc. on the basis of the data obtained<br>
using  the  first  measurement  sensor.  The  second<br>
measurement sensor is used in particular to record the<br><br>
functionality of the honeycomb body or its coating by<br>
metrological means. In this case, by way of example,<br>
the same parameters which have been recorded using the<br>
first measurement sensor are recorded again, and the<br>
two recorded parameters are compared with one another.<br>
The rise or drop in this characteristic variable<br>
accordingly allows conclusions to be drawn as to the<br>
for example catalytic activity of the honeycomb body.<br>
However, it is also possible for the two measurement<br>
sensors to observe different parameters of the fluid or<br>
exhaust-gas stream.<br>
In this context, it is also proposed that at least in<br>
part a coating, which has an increased capacity to take<br>
up oxygen compared to the first coating in the first<br>
part-volume, is provided in the second part-volume.<br>
Accordingly, the second part-volume preferably forms<br>
the region of the honeycomb body in which particularly<br>
effective conversion of pollutants in an exhaust-gas<br>
stream takes place. This preferably achieves an<br>
efficiency of over 99%. The higher oxygen uptake<br>
capacity of the second oxidizeable coating ensures that<br>
the pollutants are brought into contact to a sufficient<br>
extent with their reaction partner.<br>
Moreover, it is also proposed that the third part-<br>
volume at least in part has a third coating, which has<br>
a lower catalytic activity than at least the first<br>
part-volume and/or the second part-volume. This is to<br>
be understood in particular as meaning that a smaller<br>
quantity of catalytically active material is provided<br>
in this third part-volume. Catalysts of this type used<br>
are in particular platinum, rhodium or rare earths<br>
(i.e. in particular including weakly basic oxides of<br>
the rare earths).<br>
According to a further configuration of the honeycomb<br>
body, at least the second part-volume and/or the third<br><br>
part-volume ensures an exchange of fluid flows between<br>
adjacent passages. Under certain circumstances, it is<br>
advantageous not to permit any exchange of fluid flows<br>
between adjacent passages in the second part-volume.<br>
This is the case, for example, if the first measurement<br>
sensor and the second measurement sensor are in each<br>
case  supposed  to  generate  measured  values  to  be<br>
compared with one another. To ensure that the same<br>
fluid flows which are routed past the first measurement<br>
sensor also flow past the second measurement sensor,<br>
cross-mixing between partial  fluid flows  is  to be<br>
avoided. If a comparison of this type is not carried<br>
out, mixing of partial fluid flows is under certain<br>
circumstances also advantageous in the second part-<br>
region.<br>
According to a refinement of the honeycomb body, the<br>
second measurement sensor is positioned at a distance<br>
in the range from 10 mm to 3 0 mm from the second end<br>
face. The distance described here constitutes a type of<br>
minimum distance which should be ensured starting from<br>
the second end face, which in the exhaust train of an<br>
automobile usually means the gas exit side. This has<br>
the advantage that when establishing that a limit value<br>
has been exceeded or undershot at the second<br>
measurement location, there is still a third part-<br>
volume available, which if necessary continues to<br>
convert the pollutants until the engine control has<br>
effected a change in the fuel/air mix in order to<br>
restore the functionality of the honeycomb body. This<br>
has its origin, inter alia, in the fact that the<br>
functionality of a honeycomb body generally changes<br>
with a time delay in different regions. Since the<br>
exhaust gas for example always enters from one end<br>
face, this region of the honeycomb body is generally<br>
impaired first. This may affect, for example, the<br>
capacity to store nitrogen oxides, the capacity to trap<br>
particulates    or    similar    components.    This<br><br>
"malfunctioning" then continues over the course of time<br>
into inner regions until ultimately the change can be<br>
detected even at the second measurement location.<br>
Accordingly, the minimum distance or the size of the<br>
third part-volume represents a safety measure to ensure<br>
that the emission limits prescribed by legislation are<br>
still complied with even in the event of sudden failure<br>
of the honeycomb body (for example as a catalyst<br>
support body).<br>
In particular, it is advantageous if the second<br>
measurement sensor is a sensor for monitoring nitrogen<br>
oxide levels in the fluid stream. It is already known<br>
for an N0x store, which can store the nitrogen oxides<br>
produced in operation for a certain period of time, to<br>
be provided for example in the exhaust system of a<br>
diesel engine or lean-burn engine. Before its storage<br>
capacity is exhausted, an N0x store of this type is<br>
regenerated by unburnt hydrocarbons being fed to the<br>
exhaust system. These hydrocarbons react, if<br>
appropriate with the assistance of suitable catalysts,<br>
with the stored nitrogen oxides, generally forming the<br>
products carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water. Any excess<br>
hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons which do not react with<br>
the nitrogen oxides are oxidized in the exhaust system<br>
or the honeycomb body using the residual oxygen<br>
contained in the exhaust gas, so that the result may be<br>
just carbon dioxide and water.<br>
The catalytic conversion can take place in a<br>
catalytically active coating of the N0x store itself or<br>
in a downstream oxidation catalytic converter. As has<br>
already been mentioned above, the honeycomb body itself<br>
may have different coatings, for example an oxidation<br>
coating with a high oxygen storage capacity or a<br>
coating which is able to store N0x. The monitoring of<br>
the ability to store NOX in particular allows<br>
statements to be made as to the functioning of the<br><br>
honeycomb body or  the  combustion  of  the  internal<br>
combustion engine at operating temperature.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also proposes a honeycomb<br>
body which is formed using at least partially<br>
structured sheet-metal foils which delimit the<br>
passages. In this case, it is preferable for the<br>
honeycomb body to have both smooth and structured<br>
sheet-metal foils which are stacked on top of one<br>
another and wound together. The profiles of the sheet-<br>
metal foils may be in a spiral shape, an S shape or a<br>
similar intertwined arrangement. These honeycomb bodies<br>
have a cell density which is preferably in the range<br>
from 200 to 1000 cpsi (cells per square inch) , in<br>
particular in the range from 400 to 800 cpsi. The<br>
sheet-metal foil thickness is in this case preferably<br>
less than 100 m, in particular in a range from 20 to<br>
80 m. Temperature-resistant and corrosion-resistant<br>
aluminum/chromium alloys are preferred as material for<br>
the sheet-metal foils.<br>
According to a further configuration of the honeycomb<br>
body, the honeycomb body is surrounded by a housing<br>
which has at least one cutout which is used for the<br>
gastight fixing of the at least one measurement sensor.<br>
The housing substantially ensures the structural<br>
integrity of the honeycomb body. The passage walls or<br>
sheet-metal foils are preferably nonreleasably<br>
connected to the housing; this is to be understood as<br>
meaning that they can only be detached from one another<br>
again as a result of damage to or destruction of the<br>
honeycomb body or the housing. The housing proposed is<br>
likewise a metallic tubular casing, in which case the<br>
passage walls are preferably welded or soldered to the<br>
housing. The cutout is in this case positioned<br>
substantially above the recess, so that the at least<br>
one measurement sensor can be passed through it from<br>
the outside. Special sealing means can be provided to<br><br>
make the cutout gastight. It is also possible for an<br>
additional housing or a sleeve to be fitted or welded<br>
onto the housing, likewise aligned above the cutout.<br>
Moreover, the invention proposes an exhaust system<br>
which comprises a pipe section for positioning<br>
components for exhaust-gas aftertreatment, in which<br>
system at least one honeycomb body in accordance with<br>
the statements made above is provided. The pipe section<br>
in this case has a longitudinal axis and a base, a<br>
secondary axis, which intersects the longitudinal axis<br>
and the lowest point of the base being formed, and the<br>
at least one measurement sensor being positioned in an<br>
angle range of 270° arranged opposite the lowest point<br>
of the base.<br>
The term exhaust system is to be understood in<br>
particular as meaning an exhaust system of mobile<br>
internal combustion engines, i.e. of automobiles,<br>
motorcycles, trucks or similar vehicles. The exhaust<br>
system is usually connected to the internal combustion<br>
engine and has an opening to the environment, from<br>
which the exhaust gas produced, which has first been<br>
treated, flows out. If appropriate a plurality of<br>
different components for exhaust-gas aftertreatment,<br>
such as for example filter elements, adsorbers, heating<br>
elements, particulate separators, catalytic converters,<br>
etc., are arranged in a pipe section, which is<br>
preferably of widened design. If appropriate, this<br>
exhaust system may be equipped with additional nozzles,<br>
sensors or feed lines for reducing agents or oxidizing<br>
agents.<br>
The arrangement of the at least one measurement sensor<br>
will now be described with reference to the<br>
longitudinal axis and the lowest point of the base of<br>
the pipe section. The invention here proposes a<br>
particularly  wide  angle  range,  namely  of  270°.<br><br>
Hitherto, measurement sensors of this type have only-<br>
been arranged in a very limited angle range opposite<br>
the lowest point of the base. This was done in<br>
particular with a view to the condensation water which<br>
may form in the pipe section in the vicinity of the<br>
base, which has an adverse effect on the measurement<br>
result acquired using the at least one measurement<br>
sensor. However, this risk of accumulation of liquids<br>
is considerably reduced on account of the configuration<br>
of the recess and the provision of apertures.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to vary the arrangement<br>
within a particularly wide angle range.<br>
It is in this context very particularly advantageous if<br>
the at least one measurement sensor is positioned in an<br>
angle range of 45° which extends from a tertiary axis<br>
extending perpendicular to the secondary axis and<br>
through the longitudinal axis toward the lowest point<br>
of the base. This is to be understood as meaning in<br>
particular that the at least one measurement sensor is<br>
arranged below a horizontal through the longitudinal<br>
axis of the pipe section. More detailed explanations as<br>
to this arrangement of the at least one measurement<br>
sensor will be provided with reference to the figures.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with<br>
reference to the figures, which show particularly<br>
preferred embodiments, without the invention being<br>
restricted to these embodiments. In the drawing <br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts a longitudinal section<br>
through a first embodiment of the honeycomb<br>
body;<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a detail view of a<br>
further embodiment of the honeycomb body in<br>
cross section; and<br><br>
Fig. 3 diagranunatically depicts the arrangement of an<br>
embodiment of the honeycomb body in an exhaust<br>
system.<br>
Fig. 1 diagrammatically depicts a cross section through<br>
a first embodiment of the honeycomb body 1 according to<br>
the invention with passages 2 through which a fluid can<br>
flow and which extend between two end faces 3, 4. The<br>
honeycomb body 1 comprises a housing 28, through which<br>
two measurement sensors 5, 21 extend, via cutouts 29,<br>
into inner regions of the honeycomb body 1. Both<br>
measurement sensors 5, 21 are connected to a<br>
measurement data recording means 38, which preferably<br>
interacts with the engine control or an internal<br>
combustion engine (not shown).<br>
The honeycomb body 1 has a total volume 13, which is<br>
divided into a first part-volume 6, a centrally<br>
arranged, second part-volume 22 and a third part-volume<br>
23. The part-volumes 6, 22, 23 are substantially<br>
defined by the position of the measurement sensors 5,<br>
21	and the two end faces 3, 4. The first part-volume 6<br>
has a length 14 extending from the first end face 3 as<br>
far as a cross-sectional plane through the honeycomb<br>
body 1, which is substantially defined by the position<br>
of the first measurement sensor 5. The second part-<br>
volume 22 is arranged between the first measurement<br>
sensor 5 and the second measurement sensor 21 and is<br>
once again defined by the position of these measurement<br>
sensors. The third part-volume 23 is defined by the<br>
position of  the  second measurement  sensor and the<br>
second end face 4, so as to form a distance 26.<br>
The honeycomb body 1 in each case has different<br>
coatings in the part-volumes 6, 22, 23. In the first<br>
part-volume 6 there is a first coating 7, which has a<br>
low oxygen storage capacity. In the second part-volume<br>
22	there is a second coating 24, which has a higher<br><br>
oxygen storage capacity than the coating 7 in the first<br>
part-volume 6. In the third part-volume 23 there is a<br>
third coating 25, which is distinguished by a reduced<br>
catalytic activity compared to the coating 24.<br>
The honeycomb body 1 has a multiplicity of passages 2<br>
which are arranged substantially parallel to one<br>
another and in this case preferably continue parallel<br>
to an axis 12 of the honeycomb body 1 through the<br>
interior of the latter. In the embodiment illustrated,<br>
the passages 2 in the first part-volume 6 are formed in<br>
such a way that they ensure an exchange of fluid flows<br>
between adjacent passages 2. For this purpose,<br>
apertures 8 and microstructures 11 are provided in the<br>
passage walls 9.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a diagrammatic, sectional illustration of<br>
a further embodiment of the honeycomb body 1, which is<br>
formed using smooth and structured sheet-metal foils<br>
27. The sheet-metal foils 27 are equipped with<br>
apertures 8 which have a mean diameter 10 in the range<br>
from 2 mm to 10 mm. The at least partially structured<br>
sheet-metal foils 27 in turn delimit the passages 2.<br>
Starting from its lateral surface 15, the honeycomb<br>
body 1 has a recess 16 extending radially in the<br>
direction of its axis 12 for accommodating the<br>
measurement sensor 5, this recess having a maximum<br>
extent 17 and a depth 18. The measurement sensor 5 is<br>
arranged in such a way as to ensure a distance from the<br>
boundary of the recess 16 which is preferably in the<br>
range from 3 to 2 0 mm. A rim 19 which has a width 2 0 of<br>
preferably between 1 mm and 5 mm is provided around the<br>
recess 16. No exchange of adjacent flows is possible<br>
within this rim 19, since in this section or rim 19 the<br>
sheet-metal foils 27 do not have any apertures 8 and/or<br>
microstructures 11.<br><br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts the arrangement of an<br>
exhaust system 3 0 secured to a bearing surface 40, as<br>
may be provided for example on an automobile.  The<br>
exhaust system 3 0 comprises a pipe section 31  for<br>
positioning components for exhaust-gas aftertreatment,<br>
with a honeycomb body 1 being indicated here. The pipe<br>
section 31 has a longitudinal axis 32 and a base 33,<br>
with  a  secondary  axis  35  which  intersects  the<br>
longitudinal axis 32 and the lowest point 34 of the<br>
base 33 being formed.  The measurement sensor 5 is<br>
positioned in an angle range  36  of  270°  arranged<br>
opposite the lowest point 34 of the base 33. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated here, the measurement sensor 5<br>
is even positioned in an angle range of 45° which<br>
extends   from   a   tertiary  axis   37,   extending<br>
perpendicular to the secondary axis 35 and through the<br>
longitudinal axis 32, toward the lowest point 34 of the<br>
base 33. Arranging the measurement sensor 5 in the<br>
angle range 36 means that it does not come into contact<br>
with a liquid 41 which collects in the vicinity of the<br>
lowest point 34 of the base 33. At the same time,<br>
however, it is possible for the pipe section 31 to be<br>
positioned close to the bearing surface 40, since the<br>
region lying precisely opposite the lowest point 34<br>
does not necessarily have to be used to position the<br>
measurement sensor 5.<br><br><br>
