				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to a coating composition of an acrylic polymer and a crosslinking agent such as a polyisocyanate or a melamine crosslinking agent and contains a highly fluorinated polymeric additive and forms a finish that remains relatively dirt free under exterior use conditions and is easily cleaned when soiled, for example by washing with water.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Acrylic polymer containing coating compositions crosslinked with a polyisocyanate are well known as shown in Vasta US Patent 3,558,564 issued January 26, 1971 and Krueger US Patent 4,156,678 issued May 29, 1979. Coating compositions of blends of acrylic polymers and acrylic polymer containing fluorocarbon constituents that form antiicing coatings are well known. Clear coats containing acrylic polymers having small amounts of fluorocarbon constituents that are applied over metallic base coats to provide auto finishes that have good weatherability, have high water and oil repellence and stain resistance are shown in Sugimura et al US Patent 4,812,337 issued March 14, 1989.<br>
Fluorinated polyurethanes that are used as soil release agents are shown in Gresham US,Patent 3,759,874 isjsued September 18, 1973. Polyurethanes of fluorinated isocyanates that are used as adhesives are shown in Mitsch et al US Patent 3,972,856 issued August 3, 1976. Protective coatings of fluorinated polyurethanes of fluorinated diols or triols are shown in Re et al US Patent 4,782, 130 issued November 1, 1988.<br>
There is a need for a fluoro carbon containing additive that can be added to a conventional coating composition that will form a coating composition that is high in solids, that can be applied with conventional equipment and cures to a hard, tough, durable and weatherable finish without baking at elevated temperatures and the finish is soil resistant and is easily cleaned. Preferably, the coating composition has a low content of fluorocarbon constituents which reduces the cost of the composition since the fluorocarbon constituent of the composition is expensive.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A coating composition containing about 45-80% by weight of a binder and 20-55% by weight of a carrier liquid; wherein the binder contains<br>
(A)	an acrylic polymer of polymerized hydroxyl containing<br>
monomers of hydroxy alkyl (meth)acrylates having 1-4 carbon<br>
atoms in the alkyl group, and polymerized monomers from the<br>
group of alkyl (meth)acrylates having 1-18 carbon atoms in the<br>
alkyl groups, styrene or any mixtures of the above and the acrylic<br>
polymer has weight average molecular weight of about 2,000 -<br>
20,000 determined by gel permeation chromatography,<br>
(B)	an acrylic polymeric additive containing about 5-90% by<br>
weight, based on the weight of the acrylic polymer additive, of<br>
polymerized monomers from the group of alkyl (meth)acrylates<br>
having 1-18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, styrene or any<br>
mixtures of the above and 10-95% by weight, based on the weight<br>
of the acrylic polymeric additive, of polymerized fluoro alkyl<br>
containing monomer represented by the formula<br>

CH2=CR-C- O-X-Rf<br>
where R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 -2 carbon atoms, X is a divalent radical and Rf is a fluoro alkyl containing group having 4-20 carbon atoms and the acrylic polymeric additive has a weight average molecular weight of about 1,000 - 15,000 determined by gel permeation chromatography, and<br>
(C)	an organic crosslinking agent; and<br>
where a cured layer of the coating of the composition has a combination of advancing water contact angle of at least 100° and a hexadecane advancing contact angle of at least 40°.<br>
Articles coated with the composition also are part of this invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coating compositions of this invention are primarily used as a clear coat over a pigmented base coat containing solid color pigments or metallic flake pigments or mixtures thereof. These coating composition also can be used as a conventional pigmented compositions. Conventional spray equipment can be used to apply theses coating compositions and the compositions can be cured at ambient temperatures or slightly elevated temperatures which decreases drying time. The resulting finish has excellent gloss and distinctness of image and excellent dirt, water and oil repellency, is easily cleaned by washing with water or with a water surfactant mixture or can be wiped clean and has good stain resistance and weatherability.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition is a clear coating composition, i.e. containing no pigments or only a small amount of transparent pigment. The composition has a relatively high solids content of about 45-80% by weight of binder and about 20-55% by weight of a carrier which usually is an organic carrier that can be a solvent for the binder or a mixture of solvents and non solvent which would form a non aqueous dispersion. The composition has a low VOC (volatile organic content) and meets current pollution regulations.<br>
The coating composition when applied to a substrate and fully cured has a water advancing contact angle of at least 100°, preferably 100-120° and a hexadecane advancing contact angle of at least 40°, preferably 45-85° and more preferably 60-85°.<br>
Contact angles are measured by the Sessile Drop Method which is fully described in A.W. Adamson, The Physical Chemistry of Surfaces, 5 tn Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1990, Chapter II which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Briefly, in the Sessile Drop Method, a drop of liquid, either water or solvent, is placed on a surface and the tangent is precisely determined at the point of contact between the drop and the surface. An advancing angle is determined by increasing the size of the drop of liquid and a receding angle is determined by decreasing the size of the drop of liquid. Additional information on the equipment and procedure needed to measure these contact angles are more fully described in R.H. Dettre, R.E. Johnson Jr., Wettability, Ed. by J.C. Berg, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1993, Chapter 1 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The relationship between water and organic liquid contact angles and cleanability and dirt retention is described in chapters XII and XIII of A.W. Adamson, above. In general, the higher the contact angle the more dirt or soil<br>
resistant the surface is and the easier the surface is to clean. The coating composition of this invention has a high contact angle and is resistant to dirt and soil and is easily cleaned.<br>
Typically, the coating composition contains about 30-89% by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an acrylic polymer, 1-20% by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an acrylic polymeric additive and 10-50% by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of a crosslinking agent.<br>

When the coating composition is used as a clear coating on a vehicle such as a car, truck, bus, train, or on construction equipment, industrial equipment, structures such as tanks, bridges, exterior or interior of buildings, a basecoating which may be either a solvent based or waterbased composition is first applied and then the clear coating is applied usually by conventional means such as spraying or electrostatic spraying. The clear coating is dried and cures at ambient temperatures but moderately high temperatures of up to about 90°C can be used to shorten drying time.<br>
The coating composition can be used as a conventional pigmented coating composition containing pigments in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 0.1-100. The composition can be used to coat any of the aforementioned items and substrate and provides a finish that has good gloss and is weatherable, tough and hard.<br>

The constituents of Portion 1 were charged into a mixing vessel in the order shown with continuous mixing. Portion 2 was added and mixed for 15 minutes. The constituents of Portion 3 were charged into the mixing vessel in the order shown with constant mixing. The resulting composition had a solids content of about 53.5%.<br>
A clear coating composition I (control) was prepared by mixing the above clear acrylic composition I with a polyisocyanate solution in a 3/1 volume ratio. The polyisocyanate solution contains 90% by weight of the trimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate and 10% by weight of a solvent of n-butyl acetate/Aromatic 100 solvent in a 1:1 ratio. Clear coating .composition A was prepared by mixing the above clear coating composition I with 5.0%, by weight of the fluorinated acrylic polymeric additive solution A, prepared above.<br>
Similarly, clear coating compositions B and C were prepared by mixing the above clear coating composition respectively with 2.0%, and 5.0%, by weight of the fluorinated acrylic polymeric additive solution B, prepared above.<br>
A set of two phosphated cold rolled steel panels that had been coated with a cured electrocoating primer composition of a polyepoxy hydroxy ether resin cross linked with a polyisocyanate were spray coated with a white basecoat coating composition of an acrylic polymer containing an organic polyisocyanate crosslinking agent to a dry film thickness of about 18-23 microns.<br><br>
The basecoat was allowed to stand for about 10 minutes to allow solvent to evaporate and then the above prepared clear coating composition I (control) was spray applied. Two coats were applied with a solvent evaporation time of 2 minutes between the application of each coat. The resulting film was dried at about 83°C for about 30 minutes.   The dry film thickness of the clear coat was about 44-56 microns. The resulting clear coat was smooth and essentially free of craters and had an excellent appearance.<br>
Clear coating compositions A-C were applied in the same manner to separate phosphated steel panels coated as above and then cured as above. In each case, the resulting clear coat was smooth and essentially free of craters and had an excellent appearance.<br>
The following tests were conducted on each of the panels and the results are shown in Table I:<br>
Advancing and Receding contact angles for water and hexadecane.<br>
Gloss measured at 20 °.<br>
DOI distinctness of image.<br>
Haze<br>
Hardness (measured in knoops)<br>
L, a, b, color angle values.<br>
Soil Resistance Test. Soil Resistance Test<br>
A soil substitute was prepared by blending 10 g of Nujol (mineral oil), 20g of carbon black, 500 ml of heptane and 1 liter of "Surlyn" polymer beads (polymer of an acrylic ionomer). The resulting suspension was thoroughly mixed and then the heptane solvent was stripped off using a vacuum stripper.<br>
A 2.54 cm length of 7.62 cm OD polyvinyl chloride pipe was place on the surface of the test panel. Three grams of the above prepared soil substitute was poured into the pipe and gently rolled around on the surface of the test panel for a total of fifty rotations. The soil substitute was poured off and the pipe segment was removed. The test panel was then tapped sharply twice on the side of a trash can to remove lightly adhered dirt. The amount of dirt remaining on the panel was measured in delta E units with a color analyzer.<br>
The data in Table I shows that clear coating compositions A-C that contain an additive of a fluorinated acrylic polymer have a higher contact angle for water and for hexadecane in comparison to the control .which did not contain the additive. The Soil Resistance Test shows that coating compositions A-C that contained the fluorinated acrylic polymer additive provides a finish which is resistant to soiling and also is easily washed or wiped clean in comparison to the<br><br>
clear coating composition made from the control which did not contain a fluorinated acrylic polymer additive. The control had low contact angles and exhibited poor soil resistance in the Soil Resistance Test and poor cleanability. All of the coating compositions with and without the fluorinated acrylic polymer additive had comparable gloss, distinctness of image, haze and hardness and had an acceptable color.<br>

(prepared in Example 1)<br>
Catalyst (aromatic sulfonic acid in isopropanol)	1.8<br>
Total	308.0<br>
Clear coating composition D was applied in the same manner as in Example 1 to phosphated steel panels coated with an electrocoating primer and base coat as described in Example 1 and cured providing a clear coat that was smooth, essentially free of craters and had an excellent appearance. The panels were tested as in Example 1 and the test results are shown in Table I. <br>
