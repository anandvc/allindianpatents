				<td>A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING AN AUDIO SIGNAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and<br>
apparatus for processing an audio signal. Although the<br>
present invention is suitable for a wide scope of<br>
applications, it is particularly suitable for processing an<br>
audio signal received via a digital medium, a broadcast<br>
signal or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, in the process for downmixing an audio<br>
signal containing a plurality of objects into a mono or<br>
stereo signal, parameters are extracted from each object<br>
signal. A decoder may use these parameters. In doing so,<br>
panning and gain of each of the objects are controllable by<br>
a selection made by a user.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
However, in order to control each object signal,<br>
sources included in downmix need to be appropriately<br>
positioned or panned. In case of controlling an object by a<br>
user, it is inconvenient to control the entire object<br>
signals. And, it may be difficult to reproduce an optimal<br>
state of an audio signal containing a plurality of objects<br>
rather than control it by an expert.<br>
Moreover, in case that object information to<br>
reconstruct an object signal is not received from an<br>
encoder, it may be difficult to control an object signal<br>
contained in a downmix signal.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an<br>
apparatus for processing an audio signal and method thereof<br>
that substantially obviate one or more of the problems due<br>
to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
apparatus for processing an audio signal and method thereof,<br>
by which gain and panning of an object can be controlled<br>
using preset information that is set in advance.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an apparatus for processing an audio signal and method<br>
thereof, by which preset information set in advance can be<br>
transported or stored separate from an audio signal.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an apparatus for processing an audio signal and method<br>
thereof, by which gain and panning of an object can be<br>
controlled by selecting one of a plurality of previously<br>
set preset informations based on a selection made by a user.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an apparatus for processing an audio signal and method<br>
thereof, by which gain and panning of an object can be<br>
controlled using user preset information inputted from an<br>
external environment.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an apparatus for processing an audio signal and<br>
method thereof, by which an audio signal can be controlled<br>
by generating blind information using a downmix signal if<br>
object information is not received from an encoder.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the<br>
following effects or advantages.<br>
First of all, gain and panning of an object can be<br>
easily controlled without user's setting for each object<br>
using preset information set in advance.<br>
Secondly, gain and panning of an object can be<br>
controlled using preset information modified based on a<br>
selection made by a user.<br>
Thirdly, gain and panning of an object can be easily<br>
controlled using a plurality of preset informations set in<br>
advance.<br>
Fourthly, gain and panning of an object can be<br>
controlled using various kinds of preset informations by-<br>
using user preset information inputted from an external<br>
environment.<br>
Fifthly, gain and panning of an object can be<br>
controlled using blind information in case of using an<br>
encoder incapable of generating object information.<br>

at least one selected from the group consisting of object<br>
level information, object correlation information and<br>
object gain information, wherein the object level<br>
information is generated by normalizing an object level<br>
corresponding to an object using one of object levels,<br>
wherein the object correlation information is generated<br>
from a combination of two selected objects, wherein the<br>
object gain information is for determining contributiveness<br>
of the object for a channel of each downraix signal to<br>
generate the downmix signal, and wherein the preset<br>
information is extracted from a bitstream.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing<br>
general description and the following detailed description<br>
are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide<br>
further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
MODE FOR INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In this disclosure, information means a terminology<br>
that covers values, parameters, coefficients, elements and<br>
the like overall. So, its meaning can be construed<br>
different for each case. This does not put limitation on<br>
the present invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an audio signal<br>
processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an audio signal processing<br>
apparatus 10 0 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention comprises an information generating unit 110, a<br>
downmix processing unit 120, and a multi-channel decoder<br>
130.<br>
The information generating unit 110 receives object<br>
information (01) and preset information (PI) from an audio<br>
signal bitstream. In this case, the object information (01)<br>
is the information on objects included within a downmix<br>
signal (DMX) and may comprise object level information,<br>
object correlation information and the like. The object<br>
level information is generated by normalizing an object<br>
level using reference information. The reference<br>
information may be one of object levels, and more<br>
particularly, a highest level among the entire object<br>
levels. The object correlation information indicates<br>
correlation between two objects and also indicates that two<br>
selected objects are signals of different channels of<br>
stereo outputs having the same origin. The object gain<br>
information indicates a value about contributiveness of<br>
object to each channel of downmix signal, and more<br>
particularly, a value to modify contributiveness of object.<br>
The preset information (PI) is the information<br>
generated based on preset position information, preset gain<br>
information, playback configuration information and the<br>
like. And, the preset information (PI) is extracted from a<br>
bitstream.<br>
The preset position information is the information<br>
set to control a position or panning of each object. The<br>
preset gain information sets to control a gain of each<br>
object and includes a gain factor per object. And, the per-<br>
object gain factor may vary according to a time. And, the<br>
playback configuration information is the information<br>
containing the number of speakers, a position of speaker,<br>
ambient information (virtual position of speaker) and the<br>
like.<br>
The preset information (PI) designates that object<br>
position information, object gain information and playback<br>
configuration information corresponding to a specific mode<br>
and effect set in advance. For instance, a karaoke mode in<br>
the preset information can contain preset gain information<br>
rendering a gain of vocal object into '0'. And, a stadium<br>
mode can contain preset position information and preset<br>
gain information to give effect that an audio signal exists<br>
within a wide space. An audio signal processing apparatus<br>
according to the present invention facilitates a gain or<br>
panning of object to be adjusted by selecting a specific<br>
mode in preset information (PI) set in advance without<br>
user's adjustment of a gain or panning of each object.<br>
The information generating unit 110 is able to<br>
further receive meta information (MTI)(not drawn) on preset<br>
information. The meta information (MTI) corresponds to<br>
preset information(PI) and may contain a preset information<br>
(PI) name, a producer name and the like. In case that there<br>
are at least two preset informations (PI) , meta<br>
information(MTI) on each preset information (PI) can be<br>
contained and can be represented in an index form. And, the<br>
meta information (MTI) is revealed by a user interface or<br>
the like and can be used by receiving a selection command<br>
from a user.<br>
The information generating unit 110 generates multi-<br>
channel information(MI) using the object information (01)<br>
and the preset information(PI). The multi-channel<br>
information (MI) is provided to upmix a downmix signal<br>
(DMX) and can comprise channel level information and<br>
channel correlation information. And, the information<br>
generating unit 110 is able to generate downmix processing<br>
information (DPI) using the object information (01) and the<br>
preset information (PI).<br>
The downmix processing unit 120 receives a downmix<br>
signal (DMX) and then processes the downmix signal (DMX)<br>
using the downmix processing information (DPI). The downmix<br>
processing information (DPI) can process the downmix<br>
signal (DMX) to adjust a panning or gain of each object<br>
signal contained in the downmix signal (DMX).<br>
The multi-channel decoder 130 receives the processed<br>
down downmix (PDMX) from the downmix processing unit 120.<br>
The multi-channel decoder 130 then generates a multi-<br>
channel signal by upmixing the processed downmix signal<br>
(PDMX) using the multi-channel information (MI) generated<br>
from the information generating unit 110.<br>
FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B exemplarily show the<br>
configurations of a bitstream transported to an audio<br>
signal processing apparatus according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2A, in general, a bitstream<br>
transported from an encoder is a single integrated<br>
bitstream that contains a downmix signal (Mixed_Obj BS) ,<br>
object information (Obj_Info BS) and preset information<br>
(Preset_Info BS). And, the object information and the<br>
preset information can be stored in a side area or extend<br>
area of the downmix signal bit stream. Yet, referring to<br>
FIG. 2B, a bitstream according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention can be stored and transported as<br>
independent bit sequences in various forms. For instance,<br>
the downmix signal (Mixed_Obj) can be carried by a first<br>
bitstream 202, and the object information (Obj_Info BS) and<br>
the preset information (Preset_Info BS) can be carried by a<br>
second bitstream 204. According to another embodiment, the<br>
downmix signal (Mixed__Obj BS) and the object information<br>
(Obj_Info BS) are carried by a first bit stream 206 and the<br>
preset information (Preset_Info BS) can be carried by a<br>
separate second bit stream 208 only. According to a further<br>
embodiment, the downmix signal (Mixed_Obj BS) , the object<br>
information (Obj_Info BS) and the preset information<br>
(Preset_Info BS) can be carried by three separate<br>
bitstreams 210, 212 and 214, respectively.<br>
The first bitstream, the second bitstream or the<br>
separate bitstreams can be transported at a same or<br>
different bit rate. Particularly, the preset information<br>
(Preset_Info BS) (PI) can be stored or transported by being<br>
separated from the downmix signal (Mixed_Obj BS) (DMX) or<br>
the object information (Obj_Info BS) (01) after<br>
reconstruction of an audio signal.<br>
The audio signal processing apparatus according to<br>
the present invention receives user control information<br>
(UCI) from a user as well as the preset information<br>
transported from an encoder and is then able to adjust a<br>
gain or panning of object signal using the user control<br>
information(UCI).<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an information<br>
generating unit 110 of an audio signal processing apparatus<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an information generating unit<br>
110 comprises an information transceiving part 310, a<br>
preset information receiving part 330, and an information<br>
generating part 340, and further comprises a user interface<br>
320 receiving user control information (UCI).<br>
The information transceiving part 310 receives object<br>
information (01) and preset information (PI) from a<br>
bitstream transported from an encoder. Meanwhile, the user<br>
interface 320 is able to receive separate user control<br>
information (UCI) from a user. In this case, the user<br>
control information (UCI) can comprise user preset<br>
information (UPI).<br>
The user interface 320 receives the user control<br>
information (UCI) to select whether to use the preset<br>
information (PI) inputted from the encoder. The preset<br>
information receiving part 330 receives the preset<br>
information (PI) transported from the encoder or user<br>
preset information (UPI) received from a user. If the<br>
selection is made not to use the preset information (PI)<br>
from the user control information (UCI) , the user preset<br>
information (UPI) is selected and then inputted to the<br>
preset information receiving part 330 to use.<br>
The information generating part 340 is able to<br>
generate multi-channel information (MI) using the preset<br>
information (PI) or the user preset information (UPI)<br>
received from the preset information receiving unit 330 and<br>
the object information (OI) received from the information<br>
transceiving part 310.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a bitstream<br>
interface of an audio signal processing apparatus including<br>
the information generating unit shown in FIG. 3. According<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention, a bitstream<br>
inputted to a decoder 410 contains a downmix signal (DMX),<br>
object information (01), preset information (PI) and user<br>
preset information (UPI). And, a bitstream outputted from<br>
the decoder can contain a multi-channel signal (MI) and<br>
user preset information (UPI). The user preset information<br>
is outputted from the decoder 410 and is then able to be<br>
stored in a memory 420 to be reused.<br>
A method of generating multi-channel information (MI)<br>
using modified preset information (MPI) resulting from<br>
modifying a portion of preset information (PI) transported<br>
from an encoder using user control information (UCI)<br>
inputted from a user interface is explained in detail with<br>
reference to FIGs. 5 to 7 as follows.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of an information<br>
generating unit 110 of an audio signal processing apparatus<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of a bitstream interface of<br>
an audio signal processing apparatus including the<br>
information generating unit shown in FIG. 5, and FIG. 7 is<br>
a diagram of a user interface of an audio signal processing<br>
apparatus including the information generating unit shown<br>
in FIG. 5. In the following description, the respective<br>
elements and steps are explained in detail with reference<br>
to FIGs. 5 to 7.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, as user control information<br>
(UCI) is inputted, as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, preset<br>
information transported from an encoder is excluded and<br>
downmix processing information (DPI) and multi-channel<br>
information (MI) can be then generated using user preset<br>
information (UPI) contained in the used control information<br>
(UCI). Yet, the user control information (UCI) enables<br>
modified preset information (MPI) , as shown in FIG. 5, to<br>
be generated by modifying a portion of the preset<br>
information (PI) transported from the encoder only.<br>
The information generating unit 110, as shown in FIG.<br>
5, comprises an information transceiving part 510, a preset<br>
information modifying part 530 and an information<br>
generating part 54 0 and further comprises a user interface<br>
520 receiving user control information (UCI).<br>
The information transceiving part 510 receives object<br>
information (01) and preset information (PI) from a<br>
bitstream transported from an encoder. Meanwhile, the user<br>
interface 520 displays the preset information (PI) on a<br>
screen to enable a user to control a gain or panning of<br>
each object.<br>
The preset information modifying part 530 receives<br>
the preset information (PI) from the information<br>
transceiving part 510 and is then able to generate modified<br>
preset information (MPI) using the user control information<br>
(UCI) inputted from the user interface 520. The modified<br>
preset information (MPI) may not be relevant to entire<br>
object. If the modified preset information (MPI) is<br>
relevant to partial objects, the preset information on the<br>
rest of the objects, which are not the targets of the<br>
modification, can be maintained intact without being<br>
modified in the preset information modifying part 530.<br>
The information generating part 540 is able to<br>
generate multi-channel information (MI) using the modified<br>
preset information (MPI) and the object information (OI)<br>
received from the information transceiving part 510.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of a bitstream<br>
interface of an audio signal processing apparatus including<br>
the information generating unit 110 shown in FIG. 5.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
bitstream inputted to a decoder 610 contains a downmix<br>
signal (DMX), object information (01), preset information<br>
(PI) and user control information (UCI) . And, a bitstream<br>
outputted from the decoder 610 can contain user control<br>
information (UCI), modified preset information (MPI) and a<br>
multi-channel signal (MI) . The user control information<br>
(UCI) and the modified preset information (MPI) are<br>
outputted from the decoder 610 and are then able to be<br>
separately stored in a memory 620 to be reused.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the preset information (PI)<br>
transported from an encoder can be displayed as a volume<br>
adjuster or a switch together with an index (e.g., object<br>
name, symbol, table corresponding to the symbol)<br>
corresponding to each object on a user interface (UI). A<br>
display part of the user interface (UI) can display<br>
modification of preset information per object corresponding<br>
to modified preset information (MPI) as the preset<br>
information (PI) is modified by user control information<br>
(UCI). In case that there are a plurality of modes<br>
represented as the provided preset information (PI), the<br>
user interface (UI) displays mode information relevant to a<br>
plurality of preset informations (PI) having been set on<br>
the display part and is then able to display the preset<br>
information (PI) of the mode corresponding to a selection<br>
made by a user.<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of a bit stream<br>
interface of an audio signal processing apparatus according<br>
to a further embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
decoder-1 810 comprising the information generating unit<br>
shown in FIG. 5 receives a downmix signal (DMX), object<br>
information (01), preset information (PI) and user control<br>
information (UCI) and is then able to output a multi-<br>
channel signal (MI), user control information (UCI) and<br>
modified preset information (MPI). The user control<br>
information (UCI) and the modified preset information (MPI)<br>
can be separately stored in a memory 820. And, a downmix<br>
signal (DMX) and object information (OI) corresponding to<br>
the modified preset information (MPI) can be inputted to a<br>
decoder-2 830. In this case, using the modified preset<br>
information (MPI) stored in the memory 820, the decoder-2<br>
830 is able to generate a multi-channel signal identical to<br>
the former multi-channel signal generated from the decoder<br>
1 810.<br>
The modified preset information (MPI) can have a<br>
different value per frame. The modified preset information<br>
(MPI) can have a value common to a single music and can<br>
comprise meta information describing features or a producer.<br>
By being transported or stored separate from the multi-<br>
channel signal, the modified preset information (MPI) can<br>
be legitimately shared only.<br>
An audio signal processing apparatus according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention can comprise a<br>
plurality of preset informations (PI) . And, a process for<br>
generating multi-channel information is explained in detail<br>
as follows.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of an information<br>
generating unit of an audio signal processing apparatus<br>
according to a further embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, an information generating unit<br>
110 comprises an information transceiving part 910, a<br>
preset information determining part 93 0, and an information<br>
generating part 940 and also includes a user interface 920<br>
capable of receiving user control information (UCI).<br>
The information transceiving unit 910 receives object<br>
information (01) and preset informations (PI_n) from a<br>
bitstream transported from an encoder. The preset<br>
informations can be configured in a plurality of preset<br>
modes such as a karaoke mode, an R&amp;B emphasis mode, and the<br>
like.<br>
Meanwhile, the user interface 920 displays schematic<br>
information about the preset informations (PI_n) on a<br>
screen to provide to a user and is able to receive user<br>
control information (UCI) for selecting preset information<br>
from the user.<br>
The preset information determining part 93 0 is able<br>
to determine one preset information (PI) among the preset<br>
informations (PI_n) inputted from the information<br>
transceiving unit 910 using the user control information.<br>
For instance, in FIG. 9, in case that preset information_1,<br>
preset information_2, preset information_3 and preset<br>
information_4 correspond to karaoke mode, R&amp;B emphasis mode,<br>
convert mode and acoustic mode, respectively, a mode name<br>
corresponding to each of the preset informations (PI) is<br>
displayed on the user interface 920. If a user attempts to<br>
obtain a sound stage that provides effect in wide space,<br>
the preset information_3 can be selected. The user<br>
interface 920 outputs user control information (UCI) for<br>
selecting the preset information_3 inputted from the user.<br>
The preset information determining unit 930 determined the<br>
selected preset information_3 as preset information (PI)<br>
using the user control information (UCI) and then outputs<br>
it to the information generating part 940.<br>
The information generating part 940 is able to<br>
generate multi-channel information (MI) using the preset<br>
information (PI) received from the preset information<br>
receiving unit 930 and the object information (01) received<br>
from the information transceiving unit 910.<br>
An audio signal processing apparatus according to the<br>
present invention is able to adjust a gain or panning of<br>
object by selecting and applying previously set optimal<br>
preset information using a plurality of preset informations<br>
(PI) transported from an encoder and user control<br>
information (UCI) comprising preset information(PI)<br>
selected by a user, without having a gain or panning object<br>
adjusted by the user.<br>
In the following description, if object information<br>
(01) is not received from an encoder, a method and<br>
apparatus for processing an audio signal for decoding a<br>
downmix signal (DMX) comprising a plurality of object<br>
signals are explained in detail with reference to FIG. 10<br>
and the like.<br>
First of all, blind information(BI) has a concept<br>
similar to that of object information(01). The blind<br>
information(BI) may comprise level and gain information of<br>
an object signal contained in a downmix signal in a manner<br>
that a decoder uses the downmix signal (DMX) received from<br>
an encoder and may further comprise correlation information<br>
or meta information. A process for generating blind<br>
information (BI) is explained in detail as follows.<br>
FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B are schematic diagrams for an<br>
audio signal processing method for generating blind<br>
information using position information of an output signal.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10A, in case of using an output<br>
device having stereo channels, a listener receives an audio<br>
signal (DMX) from left and right channels. If the audio<br>
signal comprises a plurality of object signals, each object<br>
signal may differ in area occupied in space according to<br>
gain information contributed to the left or right channel.<br>
FIG. 10B shows a configuration of a signal outputted<br>
from each stereo signal to generate a single object signal<br>
among object signals discriminated from each other<br>
according to a position area. In FIG. 10B, an object signal<br>
s indicates a signal located in a direction determined by a<br>
gain factor a and independent object signals n1 and n2<br>
indicate peripheral signals for the signal s. The object<br>
signal can be outputted to a stereo channel with specific<br>
direction information. And, the direction information may<br>
comprise level difference information, time difference<br>
information or the like. Besides, the peripheral signal can<br>
be determined by a playback configuration, a width that is<br>
aurally sensed, or the like. The stereo output signal shown<br>
in FIG. 10B can be represented as Formula 1 using the<br>
object signal s, the peripheral signals n1 and n2 and the<br>
gain factor a for determining a direction of object signal.<br>
[Formula 1]<br>
<br>
In order to get a decomposition which in not only<br>
effective in a one auditory event scenario, but non-<br>
stationary downmix signal(DMX) comprising multiple<br>
concurrently active sources, the Formula 1 needs to be<br>
analyzed independently in a number of frequency bands and<br>
adaptively in time. If so, x1(n) and x2(n) can be<br>
represented as follows.<br>
[Formula 2]<br>
<br>
where 'i' is the frequency band index and 'k' is the<br>
time band index.<br>
FIG. 11 is a graph of time-frequency domain for<br>
analyzing a stereo output signal according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Each time-frequency<br>
domain includes index I and index k. And, object signal S,<br>
peripheral signals N1 and N2 and gain factor A can be<br>
independently estimated. In the following description, the<br>
frequency band index I and the time band index k shall be<br>
ignored in the following.<br>
Bandwidth of a frequency band for the analysis of<br>
downmix signal (DMX) can be selected to be identical to a<br>
specific band and can be determined according to<br>
characteristics of the downmix signal (DMX). In each<br>
frequency band, S, N1, N2 and A can be estimated each<br>
millisecond t. In case that X1 and X2 are given as downmix<br>
signals (DMX), estimated vales of S, N1, N2 and A can be<br>
determined by the analysis per time-frequency domain. And.<br>
A short-time estimate of the power of X1 can be estimated<br>
as Formula 3.<br>
[Formula 3]<br>
<br>
where E{.} is a short-time averaging operation.<br>
For the other signals, the same convention is used,<br>
i.e. PX2, PS, and PN=PN1=PN2 are the corresponding short-<br>
time power estimates. The power of N1 and N2 is assumed to<br>
be the same, i.e. it is assumed that the amount of power of<br>
lateral independent sound is the same for left and right<br>
channels of stereo channels.<br>
Given the time-frequency band representation of the<br>
downmix signal (DMX), the power (PX1, PX2) and the normalized<br>
cross-correlation are computed. The normalized cross-<br>
correlation between left and right can be represented as<br>
Formula 4.<br>
[Formula 4]<br>
]<br>
<br>
Gain information (A ) , object signal power ( Ps ) ,<br>
peripheral signal power ( PN ) are computed as a function of<br>
the estimated PX1, Px2, and normalized cross-correlation (?) .<br>
Three equations relating the known and unknown variables<br>
are represented as Formula 5.<br>
[Formula 5]<br>
<br>
Formula 5 is summarized for A, Ps and PN into<br>
Formula 6.<br>
[Formula 6]<br>
<br>
FIG. 12A and FIG. 12B are block diagram and flowchart<br>
of a process for generating blind information (BI) from a<br>
downmix signal (DMX) transported from an encoder. First of<br>
all, downmix signals (x1(n), x2(n)) having stereo channels are<br>
inputted to a filter bank analyzing part 1210 and then<br>
transformed into per-time-frequency domain signals<br>
( x1(i,k),x2(i,k) ) [S1200]. The transformed downmix signals<br>
(x1(i,k),x2(i,k) ) are inputted to a gain information estimating<br>
part 1220. The gain information estimating part 1220<br>
analyzes the converted downmix signals ( x1(i,k),x2(i,k) ) ,<br>
estimates gain information ( A ) of object signal [S1210],<br>
and determines a position of the object signal in a downmix<br>
output signal [S1220]. In this case, the estimated gain<br>
information (A) indicates an extent that the object signal<br>
contained in the downmix signal contributes to the stereo<br>
channel of the downmix output signal, decides a signal<br>
existing at a different position in case of outputting the<br>
downmix signal as a separate object signal, and assumes<br>
that a single object signal has one gain information. An<br>
object level estimating part 1230 estimates a level (Ps) of<br>
object signal corresponding to each position using position<br>
information of the gain information (A ) outputted from the<br>
gain information estimating part 1220 [S1230]. And, a blind<br>
information generating part 1240 generates blind<br>
information (S0LD) (BI) using the gain information and the<br>
level of the object signal [S1240].<br>
The blind information (BI) can further comprise blind<br>
correlation information (BCI) and blind gain information<br>
(BGI). The blind correlation information (BCI) indicates<br>
correlation between two objects and can be generated using<br>
the estimated gain information and the level of the object<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 13 is a block diagram of an audio signal<br>
processing apparatus according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. An audio signal processing apparatus<br>
1300 according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
comprises an information generating unit 1210, a downmixing<br>
processing unit 1220, and a multi-channel decoder 1230. The<br>
downmix processing unit 1220 and the multi-channel decoder<br>
1230 have the same configurations and roles of the former<br>

1210 receives a downmix signal (DMX), object information<br>
(01) and preset information (PI) from an encoder and then<br>

channel information (MI). The information generating unit<br>
1210 mainly includes a blind information generating part<br>
1211 and an information generating part 1212.<br>
If the object information (OI) is transported from<br>
the encoder, the blind information generating part 1211<br>
does not generate blind information (BI) and, as mentioned<br>
in the foregoing description of FIG. 1, the information<br>
generating part 1212 generates downmix processing<br>
information and multi-channel information using the<br>
transported object information (01).<br>
If the object information (OI) is not transported to<br>
the information generating unit 1210, as mentioned in the<br>
foregoing descriptions of FIGs. 11 to 12B, the blind<br>
information generating part 1211 receives a downmix signal<br>
(DMX), transforms it into per-time-frequency domain signals<br>
( x1(i,k),x2(i,k) ), recognizes a signal located at a separate<br>
position as a single object signal from the transformed<br>
downmix signal, estimates gain information ( A ) of the<br>
object signal, and then generates blind information (BI,<br>
Sold) by estimating a level of the object signal using the<br>
gain information ( A ) .<br>
FIG. 14 is a detailed block diagram of the<br>
information generating unit 1210 including the blind<br>

enable analysis for generating blind information (BI). The<br>
downmix signal (DMX) transformed into the per-time-<br>
frequency domain signals ( x,(i,k),x2(i,k) ) by the filter bank<br>
1310 is inputted to the blind information estimating part<br>
1320. And, blind information (Sold) for decoding of the<br>
downmix signal (DMX) is generated using position<br>
information, gain information ( A ) of object signal and<br>
level (Ps) of object signal. Meanwhile, the information<br>
generating part 1330 generates multi-channel information<br>
using the blind information (BI) (Sold) and the preset<br>
information (PI).<br>

to one embodiment of the present invention, a bitstream<br>
inputted to a decoder 1510 contains a downmix signal (DMX),<br>
preset information (PI), and user control information (UCI).<br>

user preset information (UPI) used instead of not using<br>
preset information (PI) transported from an encoder or may<br>
correspond to control information (UCI) for modifying<br>
preset information (PI) in part. Object signal (01) is not<br>
inputted thereto. And, a blind information generating part<br>
(not shown in the drawing) is included within the decoder<br>
1510. Bitstream outputted from the decoder 1510 can contain<br>
