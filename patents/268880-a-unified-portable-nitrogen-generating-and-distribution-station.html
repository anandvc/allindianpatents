FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to combination of trolleys to carry unified Nitrogen Gas Generating and Distribution Station, which is portable and having application in space and aerospace industry such as inflation of aircraft tires, charging of landing gear struts and actuators, missile launcher charging, blanketing of fuel tank in case a missile hits fuel tank.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At present, the space and aerospace industry is using the nitrogen gas available in high pressure cylinders. However, they are facing many difficulties in availability of high quality Nitrogen, effective supply system, storage facilities, checking of quality of Nitrogen at the users' site, mobility and portability etc. To overcome these disadvantages particularly for space and aerospace requirements where mobility, portability and space are the main constraints, there was a need to have a technology and /or combination of suited technology for generation of nitrogen gas of required purity and grade, present invention provides for a trolley comprising of Nitrogen Gas Generation unit, Storage unit and transport vehicle.<br>
At present, generally production of gaseous nitrogen at the site of user can be divided into two broad categories.<br>
First method is to generate gaseous nitrogen from liquid nitrogen stored in a cryogenic-containers by controlled evaporation of liquid at the users' site. In this method liquid nitrogen is produced at the large Unitary plants. This liquid nitrogen is thereafter stored and purchased in relatively smaller cryogenic containers and transported to the users site.<br>
1<br><br>
At the User's site, the liquid nitrogen is evaporated in controlled heat exchanger to gaseous form as and when required and further compressed to required pressure and stored in the standard cylinders.<br>
This method is having many disadvantages such as, heavy "boil off i.e. the liquid nitrogen is stored at cryogenic temperature during the storage, heat from the atmosphere is transferred to the nitrogen liquid even though the vessel is thermally insulated. This heat evaporates some amount of liquid nitrogen into gaseous form arid relieved through pressure relieving devices provided on the vessel in the atmosphere. This is a continuous process. Moreover, at the time of transfer of liquid nitrogen for evaporation in controlled heat exchanger, there is a leakage through the joints which is called "transfer loss". In addition, the cost of liquid nitrogen per kg. is comparatively higher than generation of nitrogen gas at the users' site. Further, this process involves operational hazards due to the generation and storage of liquid nitrogen at a very low temperature (cryogenic temperature).<br>
It is pertinent to note here that the nitrogen gas is also available in low pressure commercial nitrogen cylinders for direct use at the site. The said gas is however, lacks in requisite purity, cleanliness and moisture contents and there are no means available to achieve requisite quality. In addition, these cylinders are available only at few select locations.<br>
The second method is to generate gaseous nitrogen from the atmosphere. This methodology is based on the principle of separating components of atmospheric air into nitrogen and oxygen.<br>
There are two principal sub methods of this type viz. Pressure Swing Adsorption techniques known as PSA technology and Membrane Technology.<br>
2<br><br>
PSA Technology:<br>
PSA technology is used to effect the separation of gaseous components from the atmosphere. This technology consists of twin vessel charged with special molecular sieve in a form of chemical granules called adsorbent. These vessels do adsorption of oxygen bearing molecules and regeneration of adsorbent on an alternate basis and generate gas rich of nitrogen.<br>
This method is also having certain disadvantages which include:<br>
1.	inconsistent nitrogen purity and moisture content due to cyclical operation time and properties of the adsorbent at near saturation point.<br>
2.	relatively larger plant resulting in problems of portability or manageability at the users' site and heavy maintenance attached thereto.<br>
Membrane Technology:<br>
The membrane technology consists of passing oil free air through hollow membrane fiber walls. The gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor permeate out of the wall of the fiber and are vented cut.<br>
Nitrogen rich gas with requisite purity comes out of membrane module. This gas is having a low dew point of minus 65 Deg C which is suitable for most of commercial applications.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
3<br><br>
As stated in the background herein above, to overcome various disadvantages particularly for space and aerospace requirements where mobility, portability and space are the main constraints, there was a need to have a technology and /or combination of suited technology for generation of nitrogen gas of required purity and grade. The present invention provides for at least three moveable and relatively portable independent units possibly in form of trolleys. These units comprises of a Power generating unit, Nitrogen Gas Generating Unit, Nitrogen Gas Storage Unit, Nitrogen Gas transport Unit. These trolleys are movable as well as relatively portable at possibly all the users' site.<br>
Now, we will summarize the invention comprises of these three Units as under:<br>
The Nitrogen Gas Generating Unit comprises mainly of a compressor which receives power form a power generation unit The atmospheric air is filtered and then compressed into two stages by a water-cooled, non-lubricated compressor. The Air is then passed through the membrane unit to separate Nitrogen from Air and boosted to the pressure of 350 Bar and dried through high pressure drier. The generated high pressured Nitrogen Gas thereafter passed over to the Nitrogen Gas Storage Unit wherein to maintain the moisture level, the Nitrogen Gas is passed through a high pressure dryer fitted with online Dew Point meter to monitor the moisture level. The dried nitrogen is "then stored into the high pressure storage cylinders for necessary dispensation. The Final unit is Nitrogen Gas Transport Unit which carries cylinders full of high purity dry nitrogen. This unit is in a form of battery operated electric Unit which can move upto the Aircraft for dispensation of high pressured pure nitrogen gas through cylinders. Thus the whole process i.e. from the nitrogen gas generation, its storage and finally its dispensation at the place where the recipient is United is being done with relatively compressed moveable and portable units. As explained at the outset,<br>
4<br><br>
such mobility and portability are very crucial for fighter Aircrafts united at Air Bases on hilly areas as well as the Army united at hilly, forest or deserted areas where free movement of vehicles are not easily possible.<br>
However, all the three units are operating independently but in conjunction and to achieve the objective of the invention, it is necessary to operate all the three units in sequence.<br>
The embodiment of the invention is described properly with reference to the accompanying drawings. Various drawings are referring various Units as explained in brief above:<br>
