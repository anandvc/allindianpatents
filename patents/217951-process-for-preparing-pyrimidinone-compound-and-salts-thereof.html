BAKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, numerous researches have been conducted on non-peptide angiotensin II antagonist (US Patent 4,207,324; 4,340,598; 4,576,958; 4,582,847 and 4,880,804; European Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 028,834; 245,637; 253,310; 291,969; 323,841 and 324,377, etc.) Among the above, EP Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 028,834 and 253,310 disclose imidazole derivatives substituted with biphenyl group (eg. Losartan) and EP Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 245,637 disclose imidazolepyridine derivatives (eg. 1158,809). These compounds are asserted to have strong angiotensin II antagonistic effect. Besides, EP Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 407,342, 419,048 and 445,811 disclose pyrimidinone compound, that is, a 6 membered heterocyclic compound containing an additional nitrogen atom compared to a 5 membered imidazole derivative mentioned above. However, those pyrimidinone compounds exert less activity than imidazole derivatives.<br>
As a result of intensive study on pyrimidinone compounds, the present<br>
inventors had  developed  a  novel  pyrimidinone compound  having  basically different structur<br>
e compared to the above pyrimidinone compounds, while having significantly superior activity, that is, as high as 50 times more than that of the aforementioned imidazole derivatives [in vitro (rabbit aorta) inhibition rate of 60-70% at 10~8 ~ 10"9 mole cone.] and filed patent applications therefor (International Application Nos. PCT/KR95/00121, filed September 15, 1995; and PCT/KR 9900198, filed April 26, 1999). The developed pyrimidinone compounds of Formula 1 have been produced as depicted in the following Reaction Scheme 1, as disclosed in bcfh of the above applications.<br>
Reaction Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5and n are as defined in the above.<br>
However, the aforementioned process comprising multiple steps is somewhat very complicated, and it is also very difficult to isolate the compound of Formula 5 due to the non-selective reactions of N, O-alkylated compounds, which inevitably entail an inconvenience involved with column purification and a disadvantage of very poor yield (1.28%).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the aforementioned prior art problems by providing a novel process for preparing a pyrimidinone compound of Formula 1, in which the process comprises the steps of: inducing a selective N-alkylation reaction by adding a base to the compounds of Formula 3 and Formula 4 in an organic solvent mixture so as to obtain the above compound of Formul 5; hydrolysing and amidating the compound of Formula 5 simultaneously to obtain the compound of Formula 7; conducting a thioamidation reaction of the compound of Formula 7 by using Lawessons's reagent without acid treatment; and treating the obtained product with alcoholic reagent.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a pyrimidinone compound and salts thereof in a relatively simple and high productive manner.<br>
Further, it is other object of the present invention to provide hydrates of the pyrimidinone compound produced by the above process and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Any other objects of the present invention will be clearly understood in view of the following detailed description.<br><br>

n is an integer selected from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.<br>
Hereinafter, the preparation process according to the present invention is explained in more detail.<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing a pyrimidinone compound of Formula 1 and salts thereof, comprising the steos of thioamidating the compound of Formula 7 by using Lawessons's reagent and then treating the product by alcoholic reagent. According to the present process, a pyrimidinone compound of Formula 1 can be conveniently obtained in a single step with high yield by conducting thioamidation reaction. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are produced by adding a salt to the obtained pyrimidinone compound pursuant to the conventional methods. The Lawessons's reagent is used in an amount of 0.5-2.0 eq, preferably in the amount of 1.0 eq during thioamidation.<br>
Then, the protecting groups are treated with alcoholic reagent, preferably selected<br>
.i<br>
from methanol, ethanol, propanol and mixtures thereof. As a salt, potassium salt or sodium salt is preferably used.<br>
The compound of Formula 7 is prepared by simultaneously conducting hydrolysis and arnidation of the compound of Formula 5 simultaneously, as outlined in the following Reaction Scheme 3, wherein hydrolysis is conducted by using sodium hydroxide, and arnidation is conducted by using amine and N-hydroxybenzotriazole, N-methylmorpholine and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in an amount of 1 eq. in chloroform.<br>
Reaction Scheme 3<br><br><br><br>
(Scheme Removed) The compound of Formula 5 can be easily obtained by selectively forming N-alkylated compound by adding a base into the compounds of Formulae 3 and 4 in a mixed organic solvent<br>
Reaction Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed) As a mixed organic solvent, a mixture of dimethylformamide and ethylacetate is used, preferably in a mixing ratio of 1-50 : 50-1, and more preferably 1-10 : 10-1. Further, as a base, it can be mentioned alkali metal hydrides or organic salts of alkali metal, and it is most preferred to use lithium hydride among the alkali metal hydrides.<br>
Consequently, according to the process of the present invention, it is possible to prepare N-alkylated compound of Formula 5 in a high selectivity, which further enables a convenient operation in separation and purification steps. Further,<br>
it is possible to produce pyrimidinone compound of Formula 1 in a remarkably high yield (28.2%).<br>
The present invention also provides hydrates of the pyrimidinone compound produced by the aforementioned process and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As described above, the pyrimidinone compound of Formula 1 is disclosed in the International Application Nos. PCT/KR95/00121, filed September 15, 1995 and PCT/KR 9900198, filed April 26, 1999. However, in case the above compound exists in a state of anhydride, it has a tendency to absorb moisture from the air. Thus, if a medicine is produced with anhydrides of the above pyrimidinone compound, it becomes unstable because of moisture in the air.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples. It will be apparent to those having conventional knowledge in the field that these examples are given only to explain the present invention more clearly, but the invention is not limited to the examples given.<br>

As seen in the Table 1, the moisture content for the compound of Example 3 was hourly measured. As a result, the moisture content increased, as the time went by. However, after the fixed time went by, the content did not increased any more.

The elementary analysis data for the aforementioned hydrates is illustrated in the following Table 2.<br>
