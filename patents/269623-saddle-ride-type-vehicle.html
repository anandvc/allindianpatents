[Title of the Invention]  Saddle-Ride Type Vehicle<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to the improvement of a saddle-ride type vehicle including an interlocking brake device. [Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
There has been known a bar-handle vehicle-use interlocking brake device which allows a front wheel brake and a rear-wheel brake to be operated in an interlocking manner in response to an operation of one brake operating element so that braking is simultaneously applied to a front wheel and a rear wheel (see patent document 1, for example).<br>
[Patent Document 1]  JP-A-2004-42908 (Fig. 1)<br>
[0003]<br>
In Fig. 1 of patent document 1, an output distributor 24 which distributes an operational force (hereinafter also referred to as "interlocking device") is connected to a second brake operating element 13 (the symbol being identical with symbol used in the above-mentioned patent document, the same definition applicable hereinafter) which constitutes a rear wheel brake lever. An operation lever<br><br>
34 of a front wheel brake 6 is connected to the output distributor 24 by way of a front-wheel-brake-use linking means 21 and, at the same time, an operation lever 34 of a rear wheel brake 8 is connected to the output distributor 24 by way of a rear-wheel-brake-use linking means 22. Further, the operation lever 34 of the front wheel brake 6 is connected to a first brake operating element 12 which constitutes a front wheel brake lever by way of an independent-use linking means 20. That is, to the operation lever 34 of the front wheel brake 6, cables of two systems consisting of the independent-use linking means 2 0 and the front-wheel-brake-use linking means 21 are connected. Here, two elongated holes which constitute connecting portions to which the independent-use linking means 2 0 and the front-wheel-brake-use linking means 21 are respectively connected in the operation lever 34 (hereinafter also reiferred to as "front brake arm 34") . By forming the elongated holes, when either one of the independent-use linking means 20 and the front-wheel-brake-use linking means 21 is pulled, it is possible to alleviate that a force more than necessary is applied to the other interlocking means. [0004]<br>
For example, when an operation force is applied only to the independent-use linking means 20, the elongated hole<br><br>
formed in the operating lever 34 is moved and hence, a large force is hardly applied to a distal end of the front-wheel -brake -use linking means 21 which is inserted into the elongated hole. Here, a distal end of the independent-use linking means 20 approaches the distal end of the front-wheel brake-uee linking means 21. [0005]<br>
In this case, when an adjustment nut or the like which constitutes a position adjustment means is mounted on a distal end of the front-wheel-brake-use linking means 21 and a distal end of the independent-use linking means 20, it may be necessary to ensure a sufficiently large distance between two elongated holes which constitute a connecting portion so as to prevent both the distal end of the front-wheel-brake-use linking means 21 and the distal end of the independent-use linking means 2 0 form coming into contact with each other. However, the increase of the distance may bring about large-sizing of the connecting portion.<br>
[Disclosure of Invention]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve] [0006]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a saddle-ride type vehicle including an interlocking brake device which can make a connecting portion of a cable mounted on a brake arm small.<br><br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0007]<br>
The invention according to claim 1 is directed to a saddle-ride type vehicle which includes a front wheel brake i  which applies braking to a front wheel of the saddle-ride type vehicle, a rear wheel brake which applies braking to a rear wheel of the saddle-ride type vehicle, a front brake arm which is rotatably supported on the front wheel brake and applies a braking force to the front wheel brake corresponding to the rotation of the front brake arm, a front wheel brake operating element which a rider operates at the time of operating the front wheel brake, a rear wheel brake operating element which the rider operates at the time of operating the rear wheel brake, and an interlocking device which has an equalizer for dividing an operational force applied to the rear wheel brake operating element and transmits divided operational forces to the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake respectively, wherein a first hole to which a distal end of a first cable led from one of the front wheel brake operating element and the interlocking device is connected, and a second hole to which a distal end of a second cable led from the other of the front wheel brake operating element and the interlocking device is connected are formed in the front brake arm, and a first reference line which passes the<br><br>
center of rotation of the front brake arm is set, and a first point is set on the first reference line while holding a predetermined distance from the center of rotation, a second reference line which passes the center of rotation of the front brake arm is set, and a second point is set radially outside the first point and on the second reference line, a first circle which has the center thereof at the center of rotation and passes the first point is set, the first hole is formed of an elongated hole which passes the first point, a second circle which has the center thereof at the center of rotation and passes the second point is set, and a tangent line of the second circle which passes the second point is set, an inclination line which intersects with the tangent line of the second circle at the second point and is raised from the tangent line of the second circle toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm is set, and the second hole is formed of an elongated hole which extends along the inclination line. [0008]<br>
The invention according to claim 2 is characterized in that the front brake arm is curved in a projecting manner in the direction opposite to a direction directed toward the axle (in the radially outward direction with respect to the axle).<br><br>
[0009]<br>
The invention according to claim 3 is characterized in that a bottom-link-type suspension is provided to a front fork which rotatably supports the front wheel by the axle on a side opposite to a rotary shaft of the front brake arm with the axle of the front wheel sandwiched therebetween in the longitudinal direction.<br>
[0010]<br>
The invention according to claim 4 is characterized in that a fastening hole which is formed in the brake arm and into which a rod-shaped fastening member for fixing the brake arm and the rotary shaft is inserted is arranged below the rotary shaft, and an axis of the fastening hole intersects with a straight line which connects the axle and the rotary shaft in a non-braking state.<br>
[0011]<br>
The invention according to claim 5 is characterized in that a bottom surface portion is formed on a bottom of the brake arm, and a straight line which constitutes the bottom surface portion as viewed in a side view has a shape which is raised from the inclination line toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm. [Advantage of the Invention]<br>
[0012]<br>
In the invention according to claim 1, in the saddle-<br><br>
ride type vehicle including the interlocking device, the first hole to which the first cable is connected and the second hole which is arranged outside the first hole and to' which the second cable is connected are respectively formed in the distal end portion of the front brake arm.<br>
[0013]<br>
The first hole is formed of the elongated hole which extends along the tangent line of a circle about the center of rotation of the front brake arm, the second hole is formed of the elongated hole which extends along the inclination line which is raised from the tangent line of a circle toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm with respect to the tangent line of the circle about the center of rotation, and the first and second holes are arranged non-parallel to each other.<br>
[0014]<br>
With respect to the first cable and the second cable which are connected to the distal end portion of the front brake arm at inner and outer positions in the radial direction with respect to the center of rotation, when a brake operational force is applied only to the first cable, the front brake arm is rotated in the rearward direction about the center of rotation due to the operational force applied to the first cable. Here, the brake operational force is not applied to the second cable, and along with<br><br>
the rotation of the front brake arm, the distal end of the second cable remains at the position as it is and the second hole is moved. On the other har&gt;d, the distal end of the first cable is moved along the first circle about the center of rotation together with the front brake arm. Accordingly, the distal end of the first cable and the distal end of the second cable approaches each other.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the invention, the second hole is formed of the elongated hole which extends along the inclination line which is raised from the tangent line of a circle toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm with respect to the tangent line of the circle about the center of rotation, and the first and second holes are arranged non-parallel to each other. Accordingly, along with, the increase of the operational force applied to the front brake arm, the distal end of the second cable is guided in the direction away from the distal end of the first cable due to the second hole.<br>
Since it is possible to make it difficult for the first cable and the second cable to approach each other, it is possible to arrange the second hole close to the first hole. As a result, the size of the connecting portion can be made small thus forming the front brake arm in a compact shape.<br><br>
In the invention according to claim 2, the rotary shaft of the front brake arm is arranged on a side opposite to the rotational direction with the axle of the front wheel sandwiched therebetween and hence, the front brake arm is curved in a projecting manner in the direction opposite to the direction directed toward the axle.  Due to such a constitution, it is possible to make the axle and the rotary shaft arranged close to each other while allowing the front brake arm to ensure a sufficient rotational angle.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the invention according to claim 3, the bottora-link-type suspension is provided to the front fork which rotatably supports the front wheel by the axle toward the side opposite to the rotary shaft of the front brake arm with the axle of the front wheel sandwiched therebetween in the longitudinal direction. Accordingly, it is possible to ensure a space in front of the axle, and it is possible to easily arrange the brake arm or the like by making use of this space.  Since the space can be ensured, the maintenance property of the vehicle around the front brake can be enhanced.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the invention according to claim 4, the fastening<br><br>
hole IS arranged below the rotary shaft, and the fastening hole intersects with the straight line which connects the axle and the rotary shaft in a non-braking state and hence, the axis of the fastening hole is arranged along the approximately vertical direction. Since the axis of the fastening hole is arranged along the approximately vertical direction, the fastening hole can be easily observed. Accordingly, the bolt can be easily inserted into the fastening hole thus enhancing the assembling property of the brake arm.<br>
[0019]<br>
In the invention according to claim 5, the bottom surface portion is formed on the bottom of the brake arm, and the straight line which constitutes the bottom surface portion as viewed in a side view has the shape which is raised from the inclination line toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm. Although the distal end of the second cable approaches the bottom surface portion due to the rotation of the front brake arm, since the bottom surface portion is inclined and hence, it is possible to make it difficult for the bottom surface portion and the second cable approach each other even when the bottom surface portion and the second hole are arranged close to each other. Accordingly, the second hole can be arranged close to the bottom surface portion thus forming<br><br>
the bra&gt;e arm in a compact manner.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
[0020]<br>
The best mode for carrying out the invention is explained in conjunction with attached drawings hereinafter. With respect to the arrangement relationship of respective constitutional parts described hereinafter, the directions of these constitutional parts are set as viewed from a rider of a motorcycle. Here, drawings are viewed in the direction of numerals.<br>

Due to the above-mentioned constitution, in both a case where the rear-wheel-brake operating element 31 is operated and a case where the front-wheel brake operating element 4 9 is operated, braking is applied to the front wheel 11.<br>
[002.9]<br>
As described above, the interlocking brake device 52 according to the invention includes the front wheel brake<br><br>
12 whicr. applies braking to the front wheel 11 and the rear-wheel brake 16 which applies braking to the rear wheel 14. The first front wheel cable 23 and the second front wheel cable 24 are connected to the front wheel brake 12, and the rear-wheel cable 35 is connected to the rear-wheel brake 16. The interlocking brake device 52 constitutes a portion of the brake system of the motorcycle. [0030]<br>
Fig. 2 is a side view of the front wheel which includes the interlocking brake device according to the invention, wherein the front wheel 11 is rotatably mounted on a lower end portion of a front fork 53 which constitutes a front portion of the motorcycle 10 by way of an axle 56, wherein the motorcycle 10 is shown as a saddle-ride type vehicle.<br>
[0031]<br>
The front wheel 11 includes an axle 56 which is mounted on a distal end portion 55 of the front fork, and the front wheel brake 12 which is mounted around the axle 56 and applies a braking force to the front wheel 11. The front brake panel 13 is mounted on a side surface of the front wheel brake 12.<br>
The front brake arm support shaft 18 to which a brake operational force is inputted is rotatably mounted on the front-brake panel 13 in a projecting manner.  A front<br><br>
brake arrr. 21 is swingably mounted on the front brake arm support shaft 18. First and second joint pieces 61, 62 having a columnar shape are pivotally supported on the front brake arm 21, and these first and second brake rods 63, 64 are respectively connected to first and second joint pieces 61, 62.  The first front wheel cable 23 is connected to the first brake rod 63, and the second front wheel cable 24 is connected to the second brake rod 64. Numeral 70 indicates a spring member which biases the front brake arm 21 on a side where the front wheel brake 12 is released. In this embodiment, a leading-arm-type suspension is adopted as an application example.<br>
[0032]<br>
Hereinafter, the suspension structure of the front fork which supports the front wheel 11 is explained.<br>
A swing arm 67 which swingably supports the front wheel 11 extends rearwardly from the axle 56 of the front wheel, a support shaft 69 is mounted on a rear end portion 68 of the swing arm, a fork lower arm 71 is mounted on the support shaft 69 in a rearwardly and downwardly extending manner from a front fork side, and the support shaft 69 is supported on the fork lower arm 71. Further, a cushion unit 73 is interposed between an end portion 72 of the axle and the front fork 53, and the axle 56 of the front wheel is swingably supported on the cushion unit 73 using the<br><br>
supporL shaft 69 as an axis. Such a suspension device is usually referred to as a bottom-link-type suspension 74.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the drawing, numeral 75 indicates a holding member which holds the first and second cables 23, 24, numeral 76 indicates a speedometer-use cable, and symbol G indicates a road surface. An arm length of the front brake arm 21 is set as long as possible within an allowable range for ensuring a larger brake operational force. The front brake arm 21 also includes a connecting portion to which the first and second front wheel cables 23, 24 are respectively connected at a position in the vicinity of the distal end portion 22 of the front brake arm 21.<br>
[0034]<br>
Fig. 3 is a side view of the front brake lever and the connecting portion according to the invention.  The front wheel brake 12 includes a connecting portion 78 to which the first front wheel cable (indicated by numeral 23 in Fig. 2) and the second front wheel cable (indicated by numeral 24 in Fig. 2) are connected at a distal end portion of the front brake arm 21.<br>
The connecting portion 78 is constituted of a first connecting portion 83 which is arranged in the radial direction with respect to the center of rotation 81 of the front brake arm and to which the first front wheel cable 23<br><br>
is connected, and a second connecting portion 84 which is arranged outside the first connecting portion '83 in the radial direction and to which the second front wheel cable 24 is connected. [0035]<br>
The first connecting portion 83 is constituted of a first hole 85 which is formed along the tangential direction of a circle which sets the center of rotation 81 of the front brake arm as an axis thereof, the first columnar joint piece 61 which is movably fitted in the first hole 85 by insertion, the first brake rod 63 which is inserted into a penetrating hole portion 87 formed in a columnar surface of the first joint piece 61 and is connected to the first front wheel cable (indicated by numeral 23 in Fig. 2), and a first adjustment nut 89 which is threaded into a distal end potion 88 of the first brake rod and holds the first joint piece 61 in a manner that a position of the first joint piece 61 can be adjusted.<br>
In the drawing, numeral 21a indicates a distal end portion of the front brake arm 21.  The distal end portion 21a is a bottom portion which constitutes a lowermost portion of the front brake arm 21 when the front brake arm 21 extends downwardly.<br>
Here, in this embodiment, the first brake rod 63 is connected to the first front wheel cable 23. However, the<br><br>
object CI zhe invention can be achieved even when the first brake rod 63 is connected to the second front wheel cable 24 in place of the first front wheel cable 23.<br>
[0036]<br>
The second connecting portion 84 is constituted of a second hole 8 6 which is arranged radially outside the first hole 85 which sets the center of rotation 81 of the front brake arm 21 as an axis thereof, the second columnar joint piece 62 which is movably fitted in the second hole 86 by insertion, a second brake rod 64 which is inserted into a penetrating hole portion 91 formed in a columnar side surface of the second joint piece 62 and is connected to the second front wheel cable 24, and a second adjustment nut 93 which is threaded into a distal end portion 92 of the second brake rod and holds the second joint piece 62 in a manner that a position of the second joint piece 62 can be adjusted.<br>
[0037]<br>
Here, in this embodiment, the second brake rod 64 is connected to the second front wheel cable {indicated by numeral 24 in Fig. 2) . However, even when the second brake rod 64 is connected to the first front wheel cable 2 3 in place of the second front wheel cable 24, there arises no problem.<br>
[0038]<br><br>
The first hole 85 and the second hole 86 which constitute the connecting portion 78 are arranged at positions where the first adjustment nut 89 and the second adjustment nut 93 are not brought into contact with each other when an operational force is applied to either one of the first front wheel cable 23 and the second front wheel cable 24 so that only one of the first joint piece 61 and the second joint piece 62 is moved.<br>
[0039]<br>
With respect to the arrangement of the first hole 85 and the second hole 86, usually, two elongated holes which are formed on an inner side and on outer side in the radial direction of the brake arm respectively are arranged such that these elongated holes are arranged parallel to each other in the tangential direction of a rotational arc of the front brake arm. However, according to the invention, two elongated holes are arranged non-parallel to each other. The detailed arrangement of two elongated holes is explained later.<br>
[0040]<br>
The first hole 85 is formed of an elongated hole having a longitudinal length A, and the second hole 86 which is arranged outside the first hole 85 is formed of an elongated hole having a longitudinal length B. The respective first hole 85 and the second hole 86 satisfy the<br><br>
length  relationship  of  A<b.></b.>
[0041]<br>
Since both the first hole 85 and the second hole 86 are formed of an elongated hole, for example, when a brake operational force is applied only to the first brake rod 63, the second joint piece 62 is moved along the second hole 86 and hence, it is possible to release a force applied to the second brake rod 64 to which the brake operational force is not applied.<br>
[0042]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 1 to Fig, 3, the front brake arm 21 includes the first hole 85 to which the first adjustment nut 89 which is guided to the second output part 43 formed on the interlocking device 33 and corresponds to a distal end of the first cable 23 is connected. The front brake arm 21 also includes the second hole 86 to which the second adjustment nut 93 which is guided to the front wheel brake operating part 49 and corresponds to a distal end of the second cable 24 is connected.<br>
[0043]<br>
The front fork 53 which rotatably supports the front wheel 11 on the axle 56 includes the bottom-link-type suspension 74 in a state where the bottom-link-type suspension 74 is directed rearwardly. Accordingly, it is<br><br>
possible ^c ensure a space in front of the axle so that the brake arm and the like can be easily arranged by making use of such a space. Since the space can be ensured, the maintenance property around the front brake can be enhanced. The front fork can adopt a telescopic-type suspension in place of the bottom-link-type suspension with no problem.<br>
[0044]<br>
Further, the front brake arm support shaft 18 which constitutes the rotary shaft of the front brake arm is arranged on a side opposite to the rotational direction thereof with the axle 56 of the front wheel sandwiched therebetween, and the front brake arm 21 is curved in a projecting manner in the direction opposite to the direction toward the axle 56. Due to such a constitution, the front brake arm support shaft 18 which constitutes the rotary shaft of the front brake arm 21 and the axle 56 can be arranged close to each other while ensuring sufficient a rotational angle of the front brake arm 21. In this case, provided that the front brake arm 21 extends downwardly from the front brake arm support shaft 18, it is possible to arrange the front brake arm 21 in a compact manner.<br>
[0045]<br>
Here, the rotary shaft of the front brake arm may be arranged in front of and below the axle of the front wheel. Further, the front brake arm 21 may not be curved in a<br><br>
frontwardly projecting manner. For example, the front<br>
brake arm 21 may extend linearly from the rotary shaft.<br>
[0046]<br>
Further, a fastening hole 96 is formed in the front brake arm 21 below the front brake arm support shaft 18. A rod-shaped fastening member 95 (bolt) for fixing the front brake arm 21 and the front brake arm support shaft 18 is inserted into the fastening hole 96. The fastening hole 96 intersects with a straight line L which connects the axle 56 and the front brake arm support shaft 18 in a non-braking state.<br>
In the drawing, numeral 97 indicates a nut which is mounted on a lower surface of the front brake arm 21 by welding at a position where the fastening hole 96 penetrates, and the fastening member 95 is threadedly engaged with the nut 97.<br>
[0047]<br>
The fastening hole 96 is arranged below the front brake arm support shaft 18, the fastening hole 96 intersects with the straight line L which connects the axle 56 and the front brake arm support shaft 18 in a non-braking state, and an axis J of the fastening hole is arranged in the direction that the axis J approaches the vertical direction. Since the axis J of the fastening hole is arranged in the direction that the axis J approaches the<br><br>
vertical direction, the fastening hole 96 can be easily-viewed. Accordingly, the fastening member 95 can be easily inserted into the fastening hole 96. As a result, it is possible to enhance the assembling property of the front brake arm 21.<br>
[0048]<br>
Fig. 4 is a front view for explaining the structure of the distal end portion of the front brake arm which is mounted on the saddle-ride-type vehicle according to the invention, and the structure is explained also in conjunction with Fig. 3.<br>
The distal end portion 22 of the front brake arm is constituted of an outer plate 98 and an inner plate 99 which are arranged substantially parallel to each other and is formed in a bag shape.  A pair of first holes 85, 85 and a pair of second holes 86, 86 are formed in the outer plate 98 and the inner plate 99 respectively at the same positions as viewed in a side view. The first and second joint pieces 61, 62 are movably fitted into the first and second holes 85, 85, 86, 86 respectively by insertion. The first and second brake rods 63, 64 penetrate the penetration hole portions 87, 91 of the first and second joint pieces 61, 62 respectively. The first and second adjustment nuts 89, 93 for adjusting a play of braking or the like are threaded into distal end portions 88, 92 of<br><br>
the first and second brake rods.<br>
[0049]<br>
Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) are views showing a comparison example and the embodiment of the invention for explaining the cable connecting portion which is mounted on the distal end portion of the brake arm. The arrangement of the first and second holes which constitute the connecting portions to which the distal end portions of the cables are connected is explained in detail in conjunction with Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b).<br>
[0050]<br>
Fig. 5(b) shows the embodiment of the invention. The first reference line Ilia which passes the center of rotation 81 of the front brake arm is set. A first point 112 is set on the first reference line Ilia while holding a predetermined distance (Rl) from the center of rotation 81. A second reference line 111b which passes the center of rotation 81 of the front brake arm is set. A second point 114 is set radially outside the first point 112 and on the second reference line 111b while holding a distance (R2) larger than the predetermined distance (Rl) from the center of rotation 81. A first circle 115 which has the center thereof at the center of rotation 81 and passes the first point 112 is set. The first hole 85 is formed of an elongated hole extending along a tangent line 116 of the<br><br>
first circle vhich passes the first poinc 112. A second circle 117 which has the center thereof at the center of rotation 81 and passes the second point 114 is set. A tangent line 118 of the second circle which passes the second point 114 is set. An inclination line 119 which intersects with the tangent line 118 of the second circle at the second point 114 and, at the same time, is raised from the tangent line 118 of the second circle toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm 21 is set. The second hole 86 is formed of an elongated hole which extends along the inclination line 119.<br>
Here, an angle (9) which is made by the tangent line<br>
118	of the second circle and the inclination line 119 is<br>
not limited to an angle described in the embodiment.<br>
[0051]<br>
Further, with respect to the bottom surface portion 21a formed on a bottom of the brake arm, a straight line 131 which is formed along the bottom surface portion as viewed in a side view is raised from the inclination line<br>
119	toward the rotational direction of the front brake arm<br>
21. In this embodiment, the bottom surface portion 21a is<br>
arranged in the direction that the bottom surface portion<br>
21a is raised at a rising angle (a) with respect to the<br>
inclination line 119.<br>
Due to the rotation of the front brake arm, the<br><br>
distal end ct  "he second cable approaches the bottom surface portion 21. However, the bottom surface portion 21a is inclined and hence, even when the bottom surface portion 21a and the second hole 86 are arranged close to each other, it is possible to make it difficult for the bottom surface portion 21a and the distal end of the second cable approach each other. Accordingly, the second hole 86 can be arranged close to the bottom surface portion 21a thus forming the brake arm 21 in a compact manner.<br>
[0052]<br>
Fig. 5(a) shows the comparison example, wherein both the first and second holes 85B, 86B which are two elongated holes formed at the radially inner position and at the radially outer position of the front brake arm 21 respectively are formed in the tangential direction of the rotational arc of the front brake arm 21.<br>
In conjunction with the next drawing, the manner of operation and the advantageous effects acquired by above-mentioned change of the arrangement of second hole 86 is explained.<br>
[0053]<br>
Fig. 6(a) to Fig. 6(d) are view's showing a comparison example and the embodiment of the invention for explaining the manner of operation of the cable connecting portion according to the invention (when the first cable which is<br><br>
mounted on an inner side of the connecting portion is pulled). Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) are views showing the comparison example, and Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 6(d) are views showing the embodiment of the invention. Further, in Fig. 6(a) to Fig. 6(d), the front brake arm 21 has the same shape and the same size.<br>
[0054]<br>
In Fig. 6(a), the first hole 85B and the second hole 86B are arranged substantially parallel to each other.<br>
The first front wheel cable and the second front wheel cable (indicated by numerals 23, 24 in Fig. 2) are in a state where the operational force is not applied to the respective cables, and the first adjustment nut 89 which corresponds to the distal end 65 of the first cable and the second adjustment nut 93 which corresponds to the distal end 66 of the second cable are arranged spaced-apart from<br>
each other by a distance 5a.<br>
[0055]<br>
Fig. 6(b) shows a state in which an operational force is applied to the first brake rod 63 from the first front wheel cable (indicated by numeral 2 3 in Fig. 2) so that the front brake arm 21 is pulled in the direction indicated by an arrow b, while the operational force is not applied to the second brake rod 64. Here, the first adjustment nut 89 which corresponds to the distal end of the first cable and<br><br>
the second aa;ustraent nut 93 which corresponds to the distal end of the second cable are spaced apart from each<br>
other by a distance 6b.  In this case, the distance 6b is a value close to 0 and hence, when the front brake arm 21 is further pulled in the direction indicated by the arrow b, there arises a drawback that the first adjustment nut 89 and the second adjustment nut 93 are brought into contact with each other.<br>
[0056]<br>
To overcome such a drawback, it is necessary to arrange the first brake rod 63 and the second brake rod 64 such that the distance between the first brake rod 63 and the second brake rod 64 which corresponds to a distance between distal ends of two front wheel cables 23, 24 becomes sufficiently large to prevent both rods from coming into contact with each other. Such arrangement, however, may increase a size of the connecting portion.  In this case, it may be possible to adopt a means which moves the position of the first hole to a side where the center of rotation of the brake arm is positioned. However, a drawback still remains with respect to the assurance of predetermined rotational torque. To satisfy the above-mentioned condition, it is necessary to take a countermeasure such as the elongation of a length of the arm. That is, the comparison example has a drawback that<br><br>
the increase of the size of the connecting portion is inevitable.<br>
[0057]<br>
In Fig. 6(c), the first hole 85 and the second hole 86 are formed in the first and second front wheel cables 23, 24 respectively in a state where the first hole 85 and the second hole 86 are arranged in a V shape in the rearward direction. The first and the second front wheel cables 23, 24 are in a state where an operational force is not applied to these front wheel cables, and the first adjustment nut 8 9 corresponding to a distal end of the first cable and the second adjustment nut 93 corresponding to a distal end of the second cable are spaced apart from each other by a<br>
distance 5c.<br>
[0058]<br>
Fig. 6(d) shows a state in which an operational force is applied to the first front wheel cable 23 so that the front brake arm 21 is pulled in the direction indicated by an arrow d, while an operational force is not applied to the second brake rod 64. Here, the first adjustment nut 89 and the second adjustment nut 93 are spaced apart from each other by a distance 6d. The relationship of 5b 
 <br>
direction indicated by the arrow d, there is no possibility that the first adjustment nut 89 and the second adjustment nut 93 come into contact with each other.<br>
[0059]<br>
Fig, 7 is a view showing the comparison example and the embodiment for explaining the manner of operation of the cable connecting portion according to the invention (showing a case in which the second cable provided to an outer side of the connecting portion is pulled).<br>
Fig. 7(a) shows the comparison example. Contrary to the case explained in conjunction with Fig. 6(b), Fig. 7(a) shows a state in which an operational force is applied to the second front wheel cable 24 so that the second front wheel cable 24 is pulled in the direction indicated by an arrow e, while an operational force is not applied to the first front wheel cable 23. Here, the second adjustment nut 93 corresponding to a distal end of the second cable and the first adjustment nut 89 corresponding to a distal end of the first cable are spaced apart from each other by<br>
a distance 6e. In this case, there is no possibility that the second adjustment nut 93 and the first adjustment nut 8 9 come into contact with each other.<br>
[0060]<br>
Fig. 7(b) shows the embodiment. Contrary to the case explained in conjunction with Fig. 6(d), Fig. 7(b) shows a<br><br>
state in which. an operational force is applied to the second front wheel cable 24 so that the second front wheel cable 24 is pulled in the direction indicated by an arrow f, while an operational force is not applied to the first front wheel cable 23. Here, the second adjustment nut 93 corresponding to the distal end portion of the second front wheel cable and the first adjustment nut 89 corresponding to the distal end portion of the first front wheel cable are spaced apart from each other by a distance 6f. In this case, there is no possibility that the first adjustment nut 8 9 and the second adjustment nut 93 come into contact with each other. [0061]<br>
The distance (6) between the first adjustment nut 89 and the second adjustment nut 93 when the operational force is applied to either one of the first front wheel cable 23 and the second front wheel cable 24 has been explained heretofore. Here, a case in which an operational force is applied to both the first front wheel cable 23 and the second front wheel cable 24 falls within a range of the above-mentioned operational mode and hence, the explanation of the case is omitted.<br>
[0062]<br>
As explained in conjunction with Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the second hole 86 is formed of the elongated hole which<br><br>
extends along zr.e  inclination line 119 raised from the tangent line 118 of the circle about the center of rotation 81 along with extending of the second hole 86 as the second hole 86 extends rearwardly, and the first and the second holes 85, 86 are arranged non-parallel to each other and form a V shape in the vehicle rearward direction. Accordingly, compared to the case in which the first and the second holes 85, 86 are arranged parallel to each other, it is possible to make it difficult for the first adjustment nut 8 9 corresponding to the distal end of the first front wheel cable 23 and the second adjustment nut 93 corresponding to the distal end of the second front wheel cable 24 to approach each other. Accordingly, the interference between the first and the second adjustment nut 89, 93 is hardly generated.<br>
[0063]<br>
Conventionally, the first cable and the second cable are connected to the distal end portion of a brake arm. Due to the above-mentioned manner of operation, it is necessary to ensure the sufficient distance between the first cable and the second cable to prevent the interference between the cables. Since it is necessary to ensure the sufficient distance between the cables, there may be a case that the cable connecting portion becomes large-sized.<br><br>
[0064] .<br>
In this respect, according to the invention, the second hole 86 is formed of the elongated hole extending along the inclination line 119 raised from th' tangent line 118 of the circle about the center of rotation 81, of the front brake arm 21 along with extending of the second hole 86 in the vehicle rearward direction. By arranging the second hole 8 6 in such a manner, even when a brake operational force is applied only to the second front wheel cable 24 or the like, there is no possibility that the first front wheel cable 23 and the second front wheel cable 24 excessively approach each other and hence, it is possible to arrange the second hole 86 close to the first hole 85. As a result, the connecting portion 78 for connecting the brake arm and the cable can be made small in size and, at the same time, it is possible to apply a predetermined rotational torque to the front brake arm.<br>
[0065]<br>
Fig. 8 is a modification of the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, and the modification largely differs from the embodiment with respect to a point that the modification adopts a so-called trailing-arm-type suspension in which a fork lower arm 7IB is provided behind a swing arm 67B. There is no substantial difference between the modification and the embodiment with respect to other points and hence,<br><br>
the explanaticn ct   other points is omiuced.<br>
[0066]<br>
Although the invention is applied to a motorcycle in the embodiment, the invention is also applicable to a three-wheeled vehicle, and there is no problem in applying the invention to general-use vehicles. [Industrial Applicability]<br>
