ROBUST BIT SCHEME FOR A MEMORY OF A REPLACABLE<br>
PRINTER COMPONENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to printers and to memories for printe.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a robust bit scheme for a memory of a<br>
replaceable printer component.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The art of inkjet technology is relatively well developed. Commercial<br>
products such as computer printers, graphics plotters, and facsimile machiros<br>
have been implemented with inkjet technology for producing printed media.<br>
Generally, an inkjet image is formed pursuant to precise placement on a prim<br>
medium of ink drops emitted by an ink drop generating device known as an inkjet<br>
printhead assembly. An inkjet printhead assembly includes at least one prinihead.<br>
Typically, an inkjet printhead assembly is supported on a movable carriage that<br>
traverses over the surface of the print medium and is controlled to eject drops of<br>
ink at appropriate times pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other<br>
controller, wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is intended to<br>
correspond to a pattern of pixels of the image being printed.<br>
Inkjet printers have at least one ink supply. An ink supply includes an ink<br>
container having an ink reservoir. The ink supply can be housed together with the<br>
inkjet printhead assembly in an inkjet cartridge or pen, or can be housed<br>
separately. When the ink supply is housed separately from the inkjet printhead<br>
assembly, users can replace the ink supply without replacing the inkjet printhead<br>
assembly. The inkjet printhead assembly is then replaced at or near the end of the<br>
printhead life, and not when the ink supply is replaced.<br><br>
Current printer systems typically include one or more replaceable printer<br>
components, including inkjet cartridges, inkjet printhead assemblies, and ink<br>
supplies. Some existing systems provide these replaceable printer components<br>
with on-board memory to communicate information to a printer about the<br>
replaceable component. The on-board memory, for an inkjet cartridge for<br>
example, may store information such as pen type, unique pen code, ink fill level,<br>
marketing information, as well as other information. Such a memory may also<br>
store other information about the ink container, such as current ink level<br>
information. The ink level information can be transmitted to the printer to<br>
indicate the amount of ink remaining. A user can observe the ink level<br>
information and anticipate the need for replacing a depleted ink container.<br>
If the data received by a printer from a printer component memory<br>
contains an error, the printer may perform an incorrect action, or may be unable<br>
to use the printer component. Such an error may be the result of a short circuit or<br>
open circuit in an address line coupling the memory to other printer components,<br>
such as a printer controller, or from some other problem.<br>
It is desirable to have a memory scheme that is more robust than current<br>
memory schemes used in replaceable printer components to detect and correct<br>
errors and provide uninterrupted operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for detecting an error in data<br>
received from a memory of a replaceable printer component. The memory<br>
includes a plurality of bits. The method includes providing a first parity bit<br>
associated with a first data item. The first data item and the first parity bit are<br>
stored in the printer memory. The printer includes a plurality of electrically<br>
conductive lines. At least one of the electrically conductive lines is associated<br>
with each bit. The first data item and the first parity bit are read from the<br><br>
memory. An electrical test of at least one of the electrically conductive lines is<br>
performed. An error in the first data item is identified based on the first parity bit<br>
read from the memory and the electrical test.<br>
One aspect of the invention is directed to a printing system including an<br>
inkjet printhead for selectively depositing ink drops on print media. An ink<br>
supply stores ink to be provided to the inkjet printhead. A memory device stores a<br>
first parity bit and a first data item. The first parity bit is associated with the first<br>
data item. A processor is coupled to the memory device by a plurality of<br>
electrically conductive lines. The processor is responsive to output of the memory<br>
device. The processor performs an electrical test of at least one of the elect' ically<br>
conductive lines. The processor identifies an error in the first data item based on<br>
the first parity bit and the electrical test.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed to an inkjet cartridge for an<br>
inkjet printing system having a controller. The inkjet cartridge includes an inkjet<br>
printhead assembly having at least one inkjet printhead that selectively deposits<br>
ink drops on print media. An ink supply stores ink to be provided to the inkjet<br>
printhead. An information storage device stores a first parity bit and a first data<br>
item. The first parity bit is associated with the first data item. The first parity bit<br>
is used by the controller in conjunction with an electrical test of electrically<br>
conductive lines coupled to the information storage device to identify an error in<br>
the first data item.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed to a memory for a replaceable<br>
inkjet printer component of a printing system. The memory includes a<br>
semiconductor die. A plurality of circuits are formed on the semiconductor die.<br>
Each circuit is associated with and determines the state of a bit in the memory.<br>
The memory stores a first data item, which provides identifying information<br>
regarding the replaceable inkjet printer component. The first data item is useable<br>
by the printing system to determine whether the replaceable inkjet printer<br><br>
component is appropriate for use in the printing system. The circuits associated<br>
with the first data item are positioned substantially near a center of the<br>
semiconductor die.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments,<br>
reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in<br>
which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the<br><br>
invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be<br>
utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore,<br>
is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is<br>
defined by the appended claims.<br>
Figure 1 is an electrical block diagram of major components of an inkjet<br>
printer according to the present invention. Inkjet printer 10 includes removable<br>
inkjet cartridge 12, which includes an inkjet printhead assembly 14, an integrally<br>
mounted memory 16, and an ink supply 26. Inkjet cartridge 12 is pluggably<br>
removable from printer 10 via interconnects 18. Inkjet printhead assembly 14<br>
includes at least one printhead 14A. Memory 16 may include multiple forms of<br>
memory, including RAM, ROM and EEPROM, and stores data associated with<br>
inkjet printhead assembly 14 and ink supply 26. In one embodiment, memory 16<br>
includes factory-written data and printer-recorded data. In one embodiment,<br>
memory 16 includes a 26-bit ROM 16A, having 13 fusible bits, and 13 masked<br>
bits. In an alternative embodiment, all 26 bits are fusible bits. In another form of<br>
the present invention, all 26 bits are masked bits. ROM 16A can also include a<br>
different number of total bits, other than 26 bits. An advantage of using both<br>
fusible and masked bits is that a size reduction in ROM 16A may be obtained.<br>
Each fusible bit may be set by blowing a resistor in a circuit 400A (shown in<br>
Figure 4A) representing the fusible bit. Each masked bit may be set by adding a<br>
resistor in a circuit 400B (shown in Figure 4B) representing the masked bit. In<br>
one embodiment, ROM 16A is integrated with inkjet printhead assembly 14. In<br>
an alternative embodiment, ROM 16A may be integrated with ink supply 26. It<br>
will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that, rather than<br>
incorporating inkjet printhead assembly 14 and ink supply 26 into an inkjet<br>
cartridge 12, inkjet printhead assembly 14 and ink supply 26 may be separately<br>
housed and may include separate memories.<br>
Printer 10 includes communication lines 20 for communications between<br><br>
inkjet cartridge 12 and controller 34. Communication lines 20 specifically include<br>
address lines 20A, first encode enable line 20B, second encode enable line 20C,<br>
and output line 20D, which are all connected to ROM 16A. In one embodiment,<br>
address lines 20A include 13 address lines. First encode enable line 20B is usee<br>
to select fusible bits in ROM 16A, and second encode enable line 20C is used to<br>
select masked bits in ROM 16A. Address lines 20A are used to select a particular<br>
fusible bit or masked bit. The value of a selected fusible or masked bit is read by<br>
sensing the output on output line 20D.<br>
Inkjet printhead assembly 14, memory 16, and ink supply 26 are connectec<br>
to controller 34, which includes both electronics and firmware for the control of<br>
the various printer components or sub-assemblies. A print control procedure 35<br>
which may be incorporated in the printer driver, causes the reading of data frorc<br>
memory 16 and adjusts printer operation in accordance with the data accessed<br>
from memory 16. Controller 34 controls inkjet printhead assembly 14 and i&gt;ik<br>
supply 26 to cause ink droplets to be ejected in a controlled fashion on print<br>
media 32.<br>
A host processor 36 is connected to controller 34, and includes a central<br>
processing unit (CPU) 38 and a software printer driver 40. A monitor 41 is<br>
connected to host processor 36, and is used to display various messages that are<br>
indicative of the state of inkjet printer 10. Alternatively, printer 10 can be<br>
configured for stand-alone or networked operation wherein messages are<br>
displayed on a front panel of the printer.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating ROM 16A of Figure 1 in additional detail.<br>
ROM 16A includes semiconductor die 60 having a plurality of pads 62. Address<br>
lines 20A, first encode enable line (El) 20B, second encode enable line (E2) 20C,<br>
and output line 20D are coupled to semiconductor die 60 via pads 62. Address<br>
lines 20A include 13 address lines (A1-A13). In one embodiment, ROM 16A<br>
includes other electrical connections (not shown), including ground connections.<br><br>
Figure 3 is a table illustrating information stored in ROM 16A according to<br>
the present invention. Table 300 includes address line identifiers 302, encode<br>
enable line identifiers 304, bit type identifiers 306A and 306B (collectively<br>
referred to as bit type identifiers 306), bit values 308, and fields 310. Table 300 is<br>
divided into portion 312 and portion 314. Portion 312 of table 300 represents<br>
information associated with fusible bits, as indicated by fusible type identifier<br>
306A. Portion 314 of table 300 represents information associated with masked<br>
bits, as indicated by masked type identifier 306B. As mentioned above, rather<br>
than using both fusible and masked bits, all bits in ROM 16A may be fusible bits,<br>
or all bits in ROM 16A may be masked bits. Each one of the address line<br>
identifiers 302 represents one of address lines 20A, and corresponds to either a<br>
fusible bit or a masked bit. Both the fusible and the masked bits are numbered 1-<br>
13, indicating the particular address line 20A associated with the bit. Encode<br>
enable line identifiers 304 indicate the encode enable line 20B or 20C that must<br>
be set in order to select the corresponding bit. A " 1" in encode enable line<br>
identifiers 304 corresponds to first encode enable line 20B, which is used to<br>
select fusible bits. A "2" in encode enable line identifiers 304 corresponds to<br>
second encode enable line 20C, which is used to select masked bits.<br>
Fusible bits 1-13 and masked bits 1-13 are divided into a plurality of fields<br>
310. Each bit in a particular field 310 includes a bit value 308. When a bit is set,<br>
it has the value indicated in its corresponding bit value 308. When a bit is not set,<br>
it has a value of 0. In one embodiment, fusible bits 1-13 and masked bits 1-13 are<br>
set during manufacture of ROM 16A.<br>
Field 310A includes fusible bit 13. In one embodiment, fusible bit 13 is not<br>
used to store data, so field 310A includes the letters "NA" (i.e., not assigned).<br>
Ink fill field 310B includes fusible bits 10-12. In one embodiment, fusible<br>
bits 10-12 provide a reference level or trigger level to determine when a low ink<br><br>
warning should be displayed.<br>
Parity field 3IOC includes fusible bit 9. In one embodiment, fusible bit 9 is a<br>
parity bit used in association with the bits corresponding to marketing field 310D.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, fusible bit 9 is a parity bit used in association with<br>
multiple ones of the fields 310. Fusible bit 9 may also be used in association with<br>
memory bits associated with another printer component, such as ink supply 26.<br>
Marketing field 310D includes fusible bits 6-8. In one embodiment, fusible<br>
bits 6-8 are used to identify whether an inkjet cartridge can be used in a particular<br>
printer.<br>
Field 310E includes fusible bit 5. In one embodiment, fusible bit 5 is not<br>
used to store data, so field 310E includes the letters "NA" (i.e., not assigned).<br>
Pen uniqueness field 310F includes fusible bits 2-4. In one embodiment,<br>
fusible bits 2-4 represent a random number that uniquely identifies an inkjet<br>
cartridge, which allows printer controller 34 to determine when a new inkjet<br>
cartridge has been installed.<br>
Field 310G includes fusible bit 1. In one embodiment, fusible bit 1 is not<br>
used to store data, so field 310G includes the letters "NA" (i.e., not assigned).<br>
Field 310H includes masked bits 10-13. In one embodiment, masked bits 10-<br>
13 are not used to store data, so field 310H includes the letters "NA" (i.e., not<br>
assigned).<br>
Field 3101 includes masked bit 9. In one embodiment, masked bit 9 is a<br>
parity bit used in association with the bits corresponding to pen type field 310J.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, masked bit 9 is a parity bit used in association with<br>
multiple ones of the fields 310. Masked bit 9 may also be used in association with<br><br>
memory bits associated with another printer component, such as ink supply 26.<br>
Pen type field 310J includes masked bits 5-8. In one embodiment, masked<br>
bits 5-8 provide an identification of the type of inkjet cartridge that is associated<br>
with the memory.<br>
Pen uniqueness field 310K includes masked bits 1-4. In one embodiment,<br>
masked bits 1-4 represent a random number that uniquely identifies a particular<br>
inkjet cartridge, which allows printer controller 34 to determine when a new<br>
inkjet cartridge has been installed.<br>
Figure 4A is a schematic diagram of a circuit for defining the state of a<br>
fusible bit in ROM 16A. Circuit 400A includes first encode enable input (E_on)<br>
402, output (id_out) 404, address input 406, transistor 408, resistor 410, transistor<br>
412, second encode enable input (E_off) 414, transistor 416, and ground (p_gnd)<br>
418. Address input 406 is coupled to one of address lines 20A (shown in Figure<br>
1). First encode enable input 402 is coupled to first encode enable line 20B<br>
(shown in Figure 1). Second encode enable input 414 is coupled to second<br>
encode enable line 20C (shown in Figure 1). Output 404 is coupled to output line<br>
20D (shown in Figure 1).<br>
In one embodiment, each of transistors 408, 412 and 416 is a field effect<br>
transistor (FET). Address input 406 is coupled to the drain of transistor 408. First<br>
encode enable input 402 is coupled to the gate of transistor 408. The source of<br>
transistor 408 is coupled to the gate of transistor 412 and the drain of transistor<br>
416. The gate of transistor 416 is coupled to second encode enable input 414. The<br>
drain of transistor 416 is coupled to the source of transistor 408 and the gate of<br>
transistor 412. The source of transistor 416 is coupled to ground 418. Resistor<br>
410 is positioned between output 404 and the drain of transistor 412. The source<br>
of transistor 412 is coupled to ground 418.<br><br>
A fusible bit in ROM 16A, such as the bit represented by circuit 400A, is<br>
read by setting first encode enable input 402 high, setting address input 406 high,<br>
and sensing the signal at output 404. First encode enable input 402 is set high by<br>
controller 34 by setting first encode enable line 20B high. Address input 406 is<br>
set high by controller 34 by setting the address line 20A coupled to address input<br>
406 high. The output voltage at output 404 is sensed by controller 34 by sensing<br>
the voltage on output line 20D.<br>
Transistor 408 acts as an AND gate, with inputs 402 and 406. If inputs 402<br>
and 406 are both high, a current flows through transistor 408, turning on<br>
transistor 412. Transistor 412 acts as a drive transistor, driving output 404. If<br>
resistor 410 is blown, the voltage at output 404 will be high, indicating a logical<br>
1. If resistor 410 is not blown, the voltage at output 404 will be low, indicating a<br>
logical 0. Transistor 416 is used as an active pull down to prevent leakage current<br>
from transistor 408 from turning on transistor 412 when transistor 412 should be<br>
off. Transistor 416 is turned on by setting second encode enable input 414 high.<br>
When turned on, transistor 416 diverts current from transistor 408 to ground.<br>
In one embodiment, transistors 408 and 416 each have a length of about 4<br>
micrometers and a width of about 15.5 micrometers, and transistor 412 has a<br>
length of about 4 micrometers and a width of about 600 micrometers. In one<br>
embodiment, resistor 410 has a resistance of over about 1000 ohms when blown,<br>
and a resistance of under about 400 ohms when not blown. In addition to blowing<br>
resistor 410, other methods may be used to create an open circuit to define the<br>
state of a bit in ROM 16A, including mechanical cutting, laser cutting, as well as<br>
other methods.<br>
Figure 4B is a schematic diagram of a circuit for defining the state of a<br>
masked bit in ROM 16A. Circuit 400B is substantially the same as circuit 400A<br>
shown in Figure 4A, with the exceptions that resistor 410 is replaced by switch<br>
420, and transistor 422 includes different properties than transistor 412. In one<br><br>
embodiment, switch 420 is not an actual physical switch, but represents either the<br>
presence or absence of a resistor. If a resistor is present in place of switch 420,<br>
the resistor has sufficient resistance to act as an open circuit between output 404<br>
and transistor 422. If a resistor is not present in place of switch 420, there is no<br>
additional resistance between output 404 and transistor 422. In one embodiment,<br>
transistor 422 is a field effect transistor (FET), with a length of about 4<br>
micrometers and a width of about 100 micrometers.<br>
Address input 406 is coupled to one of address lines 20A (shown in Figure<br>
1). First encode enable input 402 is coupled to second encode enable line 20C<br>
(shown in Figure 1). Second encode enable input 414 is coupled to first encode<br>
enable line 20B (shown in Figure 1). Output 404 is coupled to output line 20D<br>
(shown in Figure 1).<br>
Address input 406 is coupled to the drain of transistor 408. First encode<br>
enable input 402 is coupled to the gate of transistor 408. The source of transistor<br>
408 is coupled to the gate of transistor 422 and the drain of transistor 416. The<br>
gate of transistor 416 is coupled to second encode enable input 414. The drain of<br>
transistor 416 is coupled to the source of transistor 408 and the gate of transistor<br>
422. The source of transistor 416 is coupled to ground 418. Switch 420 is<br>
positioned between output 404 and the drain of transistor 422. The source of<br>
transistor 422 is coupled to ground 418.<br>
A masked bit in ROM 16A, such as the bit represented by circuit 400B, is<br>
read by setting first encode enable input 402 high, setting address input 406 high,<br>
and sensing the signal at output 404. First encode enable input 402 is set high by<br>
controller 34 by setting second encode enable line 20C high. Address input 406 is<br>
set high by controller 34 by setting the address line 20A coupled to address input<br>
406 high. The output voltage at output 404 is sensed by controller 34 by sensing<br>
the voltage on output line 20D.<br><br>
Transistor 408 acts as an AND gate, with inputs 402 and 406. If inputs 402<br>
and 406 are both high, a current flows through transistor 408, turning on<br>
transistor 422. Transistor 422 acts as a drive transistor, driving output 404. If<br>
switch 420 is open (i.e., resistor present), the voltage at output 404 will be high,<br>
indicating a logical 1. If switch 420 is closed (i.e., resistor not present), the<br>
voltage at output 404 will be low, indicating a logical 0. Transistor 416 is used as<br>
an active pull down to prevent leakage current from transistor 408 from turning<br>
on transistor 422 when transistor 422 should be off. Transistor 416 is turned on<br>
by setting second encode enable input 414 high. When turned on, transistor 416<br>
diverts current from transistor 408 to ground.<br>
In ROM 16A of the present invention, fusible and masked bits may be<br>
further classified as either functional or informational. Functional bit fields must<br>
match values expected by the printer for proper operation. An example of a<br>
functional bit field is pen type field 310J. If the bits corresponding to pen type<br>
field 310J indicate a type of inkjet cartridge that is not compatible with the<br>
printer, the printer may disable the inkjet cartridge. Thus, an error in pen type<br>
field 310J could cause the printer to improperly disable an inkjet cartridge.<br>
Informational bit fields are not critical to proper operation and may be ignored, or<br>
action may be taken based on incorrect information in an informational bit field<br>
without causing a stoppage in operation. Examples of informational bit fields<br>
include pen uniqueness fields 310F and 310K.<br>
Short circuits caused by stray ink ("ink shorts") in an inkjet cartridge ROM<br>
16A typically occur more frequently toward the edges of the semiconductor die<br>
60 (shown in Figure 2). Pads 62 that are positioned near the edges of<br>
semiconductor die 60 tend to suffer from corrosion, potentially causing electrical<br>
failures. In one embodiment, functional bits and other important bits, such r&gt;s<br>
parity bits, are positioned toward the center of semiconductor die 60 to reduce the<br>
likelihood of ink shorts with respect to these bits, and thereby provide a more<br>
robust ROM 16A. In one embodiment, marketing bits 310D, pen type bits 310J,<br><br>
and parity bits 3IOC and 3101 are positioned substantially near the center of<br>
semiconductor die 60.<br>
In one embodiment, to further improve the robustness of an inkjet cartridge<br>
ROM 16A according to the present invention, parity bits are assigned to<br>
important bit fields, including functional bit fields. As shown in Figure 3, a parity<br>
bit 3 IOC is assigned to marketing bit field 310D, and a parity bit 3101 is assigned<br>
to pen type bit field 310J. The use of parity bits, such as parity bits 3 IOC and<br>
3101, to improve the robustness of an inkjet cartridge ROM, is discussed in<br>
further detail below with reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br>
Figure 5A is a table illustrating two examples of bit assignments in an inkjet<br>
cartridge ROM according to the present invention. The table includes lines 302<br>
and 504, and columns 506 and 508A-D. Column 506 includes the value of a<br>
parity bit for each example, such as parity bit 310C or 3101. Columns 508A-D<br>
include the value of bits in a data bit field for each example, such as marketing<br>
field 310D or pen type field 310J. In Example 1, shown on line 502, the parity bit<br>
is set to 0, bit 1 is set to 0, bit 2 is set to 0, bit 3 is set to 1, and bit 4 is set to 1. In<br>
Example 2, shown on line 504, the parity bit is set to 1, bit 1 is set to 1, bit 2 is set<br>
to 0, bit 3 is set to 0, and bit 4 is set to 0.<br>
In one embodiment, even parity is used in determining what value to assign<br>
to the parity bits. Since bits 1-4 in Example 1 add up to an even number, the<br>
parity bit for Example 1 is set to 0 to maintain an even number for the sum of bits<br>
1-4 and the parity bit. Since bits 1-4 in Example 2 add up to an odd number, the<br>
parity bit for Example 2 is set to 1 to produce an even number for the sum of bits<br>
1-4 and the parity bit. In an alternative embodiment, odd parity is used rather than<br>
even parity.<br>
Figure 5B is a table illustrating the bit assignments of Figure 5A after an<br>
error in the data bit fields has occurred. It is assumed in Figure 5B that an ink<br><br>
short has occurred in the address line 20A corresponding to data bit 3. Conu'oller<br>
34 determines whether any of address lines 20A has a short circuit or open circuit<br>
by electrically testing each of address lines 20A. In one embodiment, the<br>
electrical test includes a check for continuity. Techniques for testing electrically<br>
conductive lines and electric circuits are known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art. After electrically testing address lines 2GA, controller 34 determines that the<br>
address line 20A corresponding to bit 3 has a short. When an ink short occurs in<br>
an address line, the output read by controller 34 will be a 1, regardless of whether<br>
the bit was a 1 prior to the ink short. Thus, bit 3 is a 1 for both Example 1 a.id<br>
Example 2 in Figure 5B, even though bit 3 in Example 2 should be a 0 as shown<br>
in Figure 5A.<br>
In Example 1, controller 34 examines the parity bit to determine if the data<br>
bit field contains an error. Since the sum of bits 1-4 and the parity bit is an even<br>
number, controller 34 determines that the data bit field does not contain an error.<br>
In Example 2, after examining the parity bit to determine if the data bit field<br>
contains an error, controller 34 determines that an error occurred, since the ,-um<br>
of bits 1-4 and the parity bit is an odd number, and even parity is being used.<br>
Based on the electrical test of the address line corresponding to bit 3, which<br>
indicated an ink short, and the determination from the parity test that an error<br>
occurred, controller 34 determines that bit 3 should be a 0, and corrects the bit<br>
accordingly. Thus, the error does not cause an interruption in the operation of<br>
printer 10.<br>
