				<td>A PROCESS FOR CONTINUOUS CASTING OF ALUMINIUM KILLED STEEL<br>
THROUGH BILLET CASTER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for continuous casting of aluminium killed steel<br>
without causing nozzle clogging in 1(K) mm X100 mm billet caster. More particularly the<br>
present invention relates to a process of continuous casting of billet with significantly<br>
high level of sulfur vis-a-vis aluminium content in steel. The invention is further related to<br>
a process of identifying the narrow window of calcium treatment practice in order to<br>
avoid probable precipitation of calcium sulphide at comparatively high sulphur level vis-<br>
a-vis aluminium content in steel, aluninium rich calcium aluminate or pure alumina - the<br>
causes for nozzle clogging in billet csster.<br>
The invention further relates to a process of formation of liquid calcium aluminate<br>
at steel making temperature by identifying suitable calcium treatment practice in<br>
aluminium killed steel at comparatively high sulphur level to avoid nozzle clogging in<br>
billet caster.<br>
The invention further relates to adoption of suitable slag engineering practice<br>
under the shop logistics in order to effectively use calcium and aluminium and produce<br>
cleaner steel without nozzle clogging during billet casting.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Continuous casting in small size billet section (100 mm X 100 mm) as existing in<br>
DSP (Durgapur) requires extremely low content of aluminium (
alumina build up in metering nozzle and subsequent nozzle clogging/choking. Such<br>
steels killed by weak deoxidisers (Si-Mn) are characterized by product defects like pin<br>
holes, blow holes, high inclusions ard total oxygen. Resulting slag has low basicity and<br>
high (FeO+MnO) leading to high dissolved oxygen in liquid steel, billet macro with pin<br>
holes/blow holes and high total oxygen and inclusion in finished products.<br>
In order to ensure better quality of the product and to cater to the demand of<br>
wider market it is imperative to use strong deoxidiser (aluminium) but at the same time to<br>
ensure smooth castability, as aluninium content more than 0.007% lead to nozzle<br>
choking in open billet caster (i.e. without submerged entry nozzle). Calcium injection,<br>
which is practiced to bind calcium with alumina arising out of aluminium deoxidation<br>
forming low melting calcium aluminate to avoid nozzle choking, may result in calcium<br>
sulphide (CaS) formation at relatively high sulphur level (requirement of S is less than<br>
0.015% for Al level of &gt; 0.01%) which is again a source of nozzle choking. Further,<br>
stringency of S level increases with increase in Al content Sulphur level at DSP is<br>
normally &gt;0.03%.<br>
Hence, criticality of Al killing ir volves designing of process chart for steel making<br>
and casting so that generation of nozzle clogging compound is minimal and whatever is<br>
generated gets removed from liquid steel to avoid abortion of casting due to nozzle<br>
clogging.<br>
PRIOR ART AND DRAWBACKS<br>
Steel produced through BOF is tapped into ladle. During tapping silico<br>
manganese, ferro manganese along with ferro silicon is added through bunker/chute into<br>
the ladle to meet the specification of manganese and silicon. Part of these ferroalloys<br>
are consumed for deoxidation, i.e., removal of dissolved oxygen in the metal bath. Rests<br>
go for alloying. Carry over slag from the furnace along with the slag generated through<br>
deoxidation float over the metal bath. This slag being low in basicity (0.8 - 1.6) and high<br>
in FeO + MnO (17-30%) content result in high dissolved oxygen content in metal bath<br>
due to slag/metal equilibrium phenomenon. No slag engineering is carried out through<br>
suitable addition of fluxes resulting in his type of low basicity, high (FeO +MnO) and<br>
consequent high dissolved oxygen in liquid steel, leading to high total oxygen and<br>
inclusion in finished product. Further, wrthin the specification desired Mn/ Si ratio is not<br>
maintained, which leads to entrapment cf solid deoxidation product termed as inclusion<br>
In addition to above additives, other minor alloying is also made during tapping to<br>
meet the steel grade specifications. Then the ladle is transported to ladle treatment<br>
station (LTS), where argon/nitrogen is purged from bottom of the ladle for<br>
homogenization of bath and temperature adjustment and, if required trim additions are<br>
made for composition correction. At LTS, dissolved oxygen in bath varies from 40-75<br>
ppm depending on carbon content mainly.<br>
After treatment in LTS, the ladle is taken to continuous casting shop and kept<br>
over a turret Casting starts with opening of the ladle nozzle. Metal stream passes to the<br>
six strand molds through acid board tundish fitted with six metering nozzles at the<br>
bottom. Tundish sample and temperature are taken time to time. Though arrangements<br>
for use of ladle to tundish shroud to protect the stream from reoxidation is there in the<br>
shop but normally not used.<br>
Formation of AI2O3 during Al-killing or reoxidation of Al to AI2O3 due to reaction of<br>
Al with Silica board, oxidizing slag (i.e. high FeO + MnO in slag) and surrounding oxygen<br>
around open stream during casting lead to nozzle choking in the metering nozzle. This is<br>
why Al-killed steel is not made in open billet caster.<br>
In view of the above, extensive, experimentation has been carried out at<br>
Durgapur Steel Plant, SAIL in an open billet caster to develop suitable steel making and<br>
casting practice for casting of aluminum-killed steel needed for high value products with<br>
stringent quality requirements..<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for<br>
continuous casting of aluminium-killed steel in billet size 100 mm X 100 mm without<br>
nozzle choking. The process comprises of the following steps:<br>
(i) After tapping steel from Baric Oxygen Furnace into ladle Si-Mn deoxidation is<br>
carried out maintaining proper Mn/Si ratio and more than critical value for<br>
generation of liquid deoxidation product.<br>
(ii) This is followed by slag deoxidation through appropriate slag engineering.<br>
Slag engineering involves addition of fluxes like, lime, calcined bauxite/AI<br>
dross/calcium aluminate and Al cubes over slag in order to change the top<br>
slag composition to enhance deoxidation.<br>
(iii) In the ladle treatment station, calcium treatment of steel is earned out at<br>
existing S level of about 0.03% and with very low level of Al (
(iv) Further deoxidation of steel with Al-wire feeding to achieve up to 0.015% Al in<br>
steel,<br>
(v) Prevention of reoxidaticn and formation of Al2O3 by using ladle-tundish<br>
shroud and basic tundist lining during continuous casting of billets (100 mm<br>
X 100 mm size).<br>
The steps (i) and (ii) are camed out in ladle during tapping of steel from BOF<br>
while steps (iii) and (iv) take place n ladle al LTS and step (v) during billet casting in<br>
continuous casting machine shop, further, steps (iii), (iv) and (v) are essential steps<br>
while steps (i) and (ii) are preferable.<br>
According to further aspects of the present invention, there is provided a process<br>
for successfully continuous casting of steel with 0.015% Al in LTS and 0.0008-0.011% Al<br>
during casting and S level as high as 0.03%.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention the deposits like CaS, Al2O3<br>
, alumina rich calcium aluminate in nozzle, causes for choking during casting, are<br>
avoided.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention improved product quality in<br>
respect of inclusion content, total oxygen and pinholes/blow holes is ensured.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In steel making through BOF LTS-billet caster route weekly deoxidized steel is<br>
made due to nozzle choking problem n billet caster (100 X 100 mm) in highly deoxidized<br>
Al-killed steel. In the present invention, a process has been developed wherein solid<br>
deposits of AI2O3 in nozzle causing nozzle choking has been successfully avoided. Even<br>
the generation of CaS or Al2O3 rich cilcium aluminate responsible for nozzle choking in<br>
Ca treated Al-killed steel could be suppressed leading to smooth casting. The process<br>
may be effected in existing BOF-LTS-billet caster route.<br>
The various process steps of the inventions are discussed below in greater<br>
details.<br>
• Mn/Si ratio<br>
Within the specification of the grade Mn/Si ratio of the steel tapped from BOF<br>
had been so maintained that the deoxidation product (reaction product of Mn,<br>
Si and residual Al in ferroalloys with bath oxygen) is liquid spessartite. Being<br>
liquid at steel making temperature, it floats up to slag layer easily making the<br>
steel cleaner.<br>
• Slag Engineering<br>
Slag chemistry was so designed that the deoxidation product (MnO- AI2O3-<br>
SiO2 type) generated after Si-Mn deoxidation is converted to CaO- Al2O3-SiO2<br>
type. This slag in equilibrum with steel bath has a capacity to reduce bath<br>
oxygen by 10-20 ppm. Under the constraints of shop logistics and<br>
temperature management problem this was effected by addition of lime (500-<br>
800 kg/ht), calcined bauxita/AI drossffused calcium aluminate (150-200 kg/ht)<br>
and Al cube (75-100 kg/ht) over slag towards the end of tapping in ladle.<br>
Basicity (CaO/ SiO2) was rare than 2.0 and FeO + MnO varied between 8-<br>
12%.<br>
• Ca-Si treatment followed by Al-wire injection at LTS<br>
In conventional practice of Ca treatment in Al-killed steel, Ca-Si/Ca-Fe is<br>
injected into the bath at a very low S level (preferably 
0.015% Al) after Al deoxidation. This practice helps suppress formation of<br>
solid CaS, AI2O3 rich calcium alumnate or AI2O3 by forming liquid calcium<br>
aluminate as deoxidation product and hence, nozzle choking is averted in<br>
continuous casting. With increase in Al content, stringency in S increase in<br>
order to avoid nozzle choking. Again with increase in Ca injection beyond a<br>
certain proportion, CaS formation is enhanced. On the other hand, with low<br>
proportion of Ca injection AI2O3 rich calcium aluminate is formed. Further, in<br>
billet caster (100 X 100 mm) nozzle choking problem aggravates due to its<br>
metering nozzle.<br>
Since, shop facilities do not permit desulphurisation to achieve 
from existing level of about 0.03%, the present technology of Ca-treatment<br>
was invented to cast 0.0(18-0.015% Al containing steel successfully under<br>
existing condition of the plant.<br>
In the present invention CaSi (250-400m) was injected into the bath at<br>
relatively low Al level (
prevented formation of Al2O3 rich calcium aluminate and also CaS. This was<br>
followed by Al wire injection (60-150rn) for achieving Al at LTS 0.008-0.015%.<br>
With the increase in aim AI content amount of CaSi injection was increased.<br>
This process helped formation of liquid calcium aluminate and in turn led to<br>
smooth casting. Further, d ssolved oxygen at LTS could be brought down to<br>
18-35 ppm compared to 43-75 ppm in conventional heats which resulted in<br>
improvement in quality of billets in respect to inclusions and total oxygen.<br>
• Control of reoxidation trough use of ladle to tundish shroud and basic<br>
tundish<br>
Any Al containing steel gets reoxidised through reaction with oxygen of<br>
atmosphere in open stream casting and silica in acid tundish. This reoxidised<br>
Al2O3 again causes nozzle coking. In order to reduce reoxidation<br>
phenomenon during casting, ladle to tundish metal stream was shrouded<br>
through fixing of refractory shrouds and basic board tundish was used<br>
thereby protecting the meal from reoxidation, particularly in high Al heats<br>
(about 0.012-0.015% Al at LTS). For heats with aim Al of about 0.01%,<br>
successful casting could be achieved even with acid board tundish and<br>
without shroud.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION IN RELATION TO EXAMPLRY ILLUSTRATIONS<br>
Example-1<br>
Heat no. 1-9839/01 have been cited as example no. 1 for showing details of one<br>
heat made through conventional practice at DSP Durgapur. Aluminium content in steel in<br>
this heat is only 0.004%. It may be noted that ratio of Mn and Si (i.e. Mn/Si) is 2.9 which<br>
is less than critical value as per literature. The critical value of Mn/Si ratio, above which<br>
formation of liquid inclusion is favored is dependent on percentage of Silicon content of<br>
steel. Further, neither slag engineering was carried out by addition of any suitable flux<br>
nor aluminium and calcium wire were injected. As a result slag basicity was only 1.62,<br>
(FeO + MnO) as high as 23.27% and dissolved oxygen at LTS was 68.6 ppm. In<br>
conventional practice, aluminium content in steel is kept as low as possible (
avoid abortion of casting due to nozzle choking. Such heats do not meet the quality<br>
requirements of Al-killed grades of steel.<br>
Example-2<br>
One heat was performed as example-2 as per present invention for 0.01%<br>
content Al in steel during casting.<br>
Heat no. 1-9731/01 was aimed for 0.01% Al. Details of the heat making,<br>
castability and billet quality are given below and for comparison with conventional heat<br>
1-9839/01 heat cited as example-2.<br><br><br>
Example-3<br>
The heat performed as example-3 was aimed for 0.015% Al at LTS. Heat details,<br>
castability and product quality of heat no. 1-1817/82 have been given below as example-<br>
3, which may be compared with conventional heat cited in Example-1.<br><br><br>
11. Nozzle deposit analysis No trace of deposits like , Cas, rich Ca Aluminate<br>
responsible for nozzle choking.<br>
The effect of invented process (Slag Engineering + CaSi treatment + Al wire<br>
injection) over conventional process on various quality parameters is given below. For<br>
more than 0.01% aim Al, basic board and shroud were used.<br>
Heat No. 1-9731/01 and 1-1817/02 are cited as example 2 and 3 respectively for<br>
showing efficacy of the present invention in comparison to example-1. It is seen that<br>
maintaining of Mn/Si ratio above the critical value, implementation of slag engineering<br>
through addition of suitable fluxes, aluminium and calcium injection and use of shroud<br>
(ladle to tundish) during casting were practiced as per process design in example 2 and<br>
3. As a result, heats with aluminium 0 31% (example-2) and 0.015% (example-3) at LTS<br>
stage were fully cast without nozzle choking. Basicity of slag was 2.01 and 2.64, (FeO +<br>
MnO) 12.01% and 9.4% in example-2 and 3 respectively. Dissolved oxygen at LTS was<br>
29 ppm in example-2 and (FeO +MnO of 9.4% in slag in example-3 reflects lower value<br>
of dissolved oxygen even compared to example -2 (dissolved oxygen in this heat could<br>
not be measured).<br>
Figure 1 shows comparison of dissolved oxygen level at LTS. It may be<br>
mentioned that the product quality improves with lower dissolved oxygen level and the<br>
trial heats contain lower dissolved oxygen compared to conventional.<br>
Figure 2 shows the comparative frequency distribution of percentage inclusion<br>
volume fraction and figure 3 shows comparative frequency distribution of total oxygen in<br>
billets. It may be noted that in conventional heats 100% heats have percentage inclusion<br>
volume fraction more than 0.5 whereas in present invention 100% of heats have less<br>
than 0.5 and 50% of heats have less than 0.35. With the increase in Al and improved<br>
slag characteristics percentage inclusion volume fraction decrease. From figure 3 it is<br>
seen that total oxygen is more than 153 ppm in 67% heats and &gt;100 ppm in 100% heats<br>
in conventional heats whereas in invented process 57% of heats have less than 100<br>
ppm and 100% heats have less than 150 ppm.<br>
Figure 4 represents the flow chart of the entire process of present invention for<br>
successful casting of Al-killed steel.<br>
