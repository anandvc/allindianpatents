7.	ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION: Given on a Separate Sheet<br><br>
The present invention relates to a unique locking system for automobiles which function at times when the automobile moves in backward direction. More particularly, it relates to an automatic locking system in an automobile, which works at time when automobile moves in backward direction, except when reverse gear is applied.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to prevent the backward movement of automobile when the automobile is plying on a steep road, wherein the automobile may be brought to a halt or a stationary position.<br>
The scope of the present invention is to facilitate the driver to drive the automobile on steep roads easily and free from tension. It reduces the efforts of the driver as neither he has to press on the accelerator to move the automobile ahead nor does the automobile moves backward when he releases his foot from the brakes.<br>
The object of the present invention is to curtail the backward motion of the automobile. The present invention is therefore useful to curtail the backward motion of an automobile when the said motion is not required. The present invention does not operate when the reverse gear in an automobile is applied and therefore it operates in all gears except the reverse gear because the movement during reverse gear is intentional.<br>
The main aim of the present invention is to provide a mechanism, which will not allow the vehicle to move in backward direction when it actually needs to move forward. The present invention facilitates a locking system for backward movement of an automobile and can be performed in various ways i.e. hydraulically, pneumatically, electro mechanically etc.<br>
2<br><br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
In the conventional method it has been experienced that whenever an automobile ply on steep roads with heavy load in it, the driver come across certain instances where it becomes essential for him to apply the brakes or he has to bring the vehicle to standing/rest position. In such conditions, further movement of the vehicle becomes difficult and uneasy. In order to move the vehicle forward, the driver has to use his feet for braking and declutching and simultaneously needs to press the accelerator. For balancing the movements of all the three pedals with two feet is a troublesome operation and therefore it results in severe accidents. Usually, it happens that the vehicle on steep roads starts rolling back even though a forward gear is applied, which is a major cause of accident. To avoid such situation, the assistant has to get down from the vehicle and put some obstruction under the wheels (normally used are stones, wooden logs etc.), for preventing the vehicle to rollback and further the driver drives the vehicle in forward direction. This unwanted movement of rolling back of an automobile is a major concern because not only accidents are caused but also the stones, which are left on roads, can also cause accident.<br>
DEFICIENCIES OF PRIOR ART:<br>
1.	The driver cannot drive the vehicle with ease and free from tension while driving on steep roads as one hand of the driver is always engaged in operating the parking break.<br>
2.	That on steep road, even though a forward gear is applied, the vehicle starts rolling backwards and may cause accident.<br>
3<br><br>
3.	That the stones are kept under the wheels to prevent the backward movement of vehicle and are left untouched on the road itself, which further cause accident.<br>
4.	The conventional method is not only dangerous for the vehicles but also to the human life.<br>
5.	That while driving, if the driver misjudge while releasing the break, there are chances of vehicle jumping on to the front direction and bang on the vehicle, which is plying ahead of it.<br>
6.	That because of the sudden load the vehicle/engine of an automobile may stop operating and functioning.<br>
PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
With a view to overcome the deficiencies found in the prior art, the present invention is introduced. According to the present invention, a unique locking system for automobiles during its backward movement while plying on steep road. It does not allow the vehicle to move in backward direction when it actual needs to move forward, except at times when reverse gear is applied.<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention A unique locking system for automobiles during its backward movement while plying on steep road, comprising of a motor sensing mechanism which consists of a friction block and an ON/OFF operating device, installed on a disc break/break drum or any suitable place from where the motion could be sensed; a gear sensing mechanism is installed on the gearbox of an automobile and has a relay in its mechanism; both these mechanisms i.e. the motion sensing mechanism and gear sensing mechanism are connected to the controlling unit; this controlling<br>
4<br><br>
unit consists of a relay and is connected to the reverse motion locking unit, which has a unique characteristic in itself and can be of mechanical nature like ratchet mechanism, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electromechanical or any other device working on same principle and accordingly completes the whole construction.<br>
The invention is now described in the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows the construction and working of the system wherein the motion sensing mechanism (1) and the Gear Sensing mechanism (2) is connected to the Control Mechanism (3) which is further connected to the reverse motion locking mechanism (4).<br>
The motion sensing mechanism (1) consists of a friction block, which is fitted on to the ON/OFF mechanism. The whole mechanism consisting of friction block and ON/OFF mechanism is fitted on to the axle housing or any suitable place. The said friction block is placed either on the disc break, break drum or any other suitable place in an automobile from where the motion could be sensed. This friction drum is placed in such a manner that it moves in accordance with the movement of wheel i.e. if the wheel is moving forward (clockwise), then the friction block shall move forward and vice versa. This method of placing friction block is done with the view to activate signal i.e. if an automobile is moving forward, it will supply OFF signal whereas if moving backwards, it will supply ON signal. This ON signal is supplied to the Controller Unit for activating reverse motion locking unit. The essential function of motion sensing unit is to sense the movement of the vehicle i.e. it checks whether the vehicle is moving in forward direction or in backward direction. This motion sensing mechanism will get activated if an automobile is found to move in backward direction.<br>
The whole motion-sensing unit can be replaced either by optical sensor or any other kind of motion sensor.<br>
5<br><br>
A gear sensor mechanism (2) is installed on the gearbox which senses the gear in which an automobile is moving i.e. in forward direction or in backward direction. Normally, to active the reverse lights of an automobile the gear sensing mechanism is in the form that an OFF signal is sent to the controller unit if an automobile is engaged in the front gear and ON signal if it is engaged in reverse gear. In order to send the OFF signal in reverse gear position, a relay unit is used. The function of this relay unit is to change the signal condition supplied to the controlling unit and accordingly ON signal is sent if an automobile is in forward gear and OFF signal if it is in reverse gear position. This gear sensor mechanism will get activated when it senses that the vehicle is not in reverse gear.<br>
Importantly, this gear sensing mechanism continuously sends signal to the controller unit about the position of the gear shaft. The controller unit is deactivated as soon as the position of the gear shaft is in reverse gear, which is sensed by the sensing mechanism in the gearbox. The said mechanism can be replaced by a unit, which gives the exact result of that of relay.<br>
Both the mechanisms i.e. the motion sensing mechanism and gear sensing mechanism are connected to the Control Unit (3) with suitable mechanism. This control unit consist of a relay which will get activated only when it receives ON signal from both the mechanisms i.e. motion sensing and gear sensing mechanism. The main function of Control unit is to receive and collect information/signal from both the mechanisms i.e. motion sensing mechanism and the gear sensing mechanism for analysis and further to activate and control the reverse motion stopping/locking unit (4). The essential feature of the controlling unit in that it gets activated only when it receives ON signal from both the mechanism i.e. motion sensing mechanism and gear sensing mechanism.<br>
The general principle/logic of the system is that if both the mechanisms i.e. motion sensing mechanism and the gear sensing mechanism are active, then<br>
6<br><br>
only the control unit (3) will get activated automatically, which further activates the reverse motion locking unit (4). This reverse motion-locking unit actuates the motion of an automobile and accordingly stops/lock the motion of an automobile. If either of the mechanisms (1) and (2) are inactive, the reverse motion locking unit will remain inactive and accordingly reverse motion of vehicle is permitted.<br>
The reverse motion-locking unit can be of mechanical nature like ratchet mechanism, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electromagnetic or any other device working on same principle. It consists of a solenoid, which is connected to the controlling unit. This solenoid has a rod wherein at its tip a metallic tapered rectangular block is attached. The rod along with metallic tapered rectangular block moves in horizontal direction, IN &amp; OUT of the solenoid. This rod moves towards the disc wherein metal blocks are fitted, when the coil inside the solenoid gets energised. The coil gets energised only when ON signal from the Controlling Unit is passed. The whole solenoid mechanism is fitted in the housing, which is further fitted on to the axle. Also, small metal blocks at specific distance are fitted on the inner part of the wheel/rim. When the solenoid mechanism receives the ON signal from the controlling unit, these blocks provided on the wheels come in contact with the tapered rectangular block and thereby stops the backward motion.<br>
Importantly, this locking mechanism can be installed either to lock front wheels or on the rear wheels or both.<br>
The said locking system mechanism can be of hydraulic or pneumatic and is used depending upon the type of vehicle.<br>
In hydraulic locking system, a unit having a pressure pump is installed in the breaking unit. This pressure pump continuously develops pressure and a solenoid is connected to the oil sump. A pressure-controlling valve is fitted ahead of pressure pump and pressure controlling valve on the breaking unit. On receipt<br>
7<br><br>
of ON signal from the controlling unit, the solenoid gets activated and passes the pressure fluid to the wheel cylinder for applying the breaks. In order to deactivate the whole mechanism, a wheel cylinder is used, which has a play of about 5cm -10cm to move forward/backward. As soon as the vehicle moves in forward direction, the motion sensing mechanism will sense the motion and accordingly the whole locking system gets deactivated whereas;<br>
In pneumatic locking system, a tank filled with air at specific pressure is used. A solenoid valve is fitted in the breaking unit for ON/OFF supply of pressurised air to the breaks. This solenoid gets activated and passes the pressure air to the buster for applying the breaks with the help of a cam, which has 5cm-10cm of play, As soon as the vehicle moves in forward direction, the motion sensing mechanism will sense the motion and accordingly the whole locking system gets deactivated.<br>
