BICYCLE TRANSMISSION THAT SHIFTS WHEN A DRIVER IS IN A PREDETERMINED ROTATIONAL POSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to bicycle transmissions and, more particularly, to an internal bicycle transmission that shifts gears when a driving member is in a predetermined rotational position.<br>
Internal bicycle transmissions commonly have planet gear mechanisms, A planet gear mechanism comprises a gea^ ring, a sun gear, planet gears meshing with the gear ring and sun gear, and a carrier for supporting the planet gear. It is known that internal bicycle transmissions having such planet gear mechanisms are used to shift gears by selectively locking or unlocking any of the constituent elements of the planet gear mechanism with the aid of a clutch mechanism having lock pawls. The lock pawls are forcibly moved in^the unlocking direction by a clutch-actuating mechanism that has a receiving hole for accepting the tips of the lock pawls.<br>
When the lock pawls of the clutch mechanism are in a locked state and it is desired to change gears, a large force is needed to release the lock pawls at a time when the transmission is subjected to a driving force. Thus, the gear shifting operation is strenuous and difficult to perform unless the cyclist stops pedaling, thus increasing the complexity of the shifting operation,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application 64-18792 describes a front shifting device designed to facilitate gear shifting so that gears can be shifted during pedaling- Tliis front shifting device has a clutch pawl for switching the lock pawls between a locked position and an unlocked position. The clutch pawl is acwated by a clutch-actuating mechanism, and the lock pawls are forcibly actuated in the unlocking direction. However, the lock pawls are actuated indirectly via the clutch pawl rather than being actuated directly by the clutch-<br><br>
actuating mechanism. As a result, the mechanism for performing gear shifting is complicated, and the overall weight and cost of tlie transmission is increased,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tlie present invention is directed to an internal bicycle transmission that is easy to shift even while pedaling, wherein the transmission has a simpler structure than known transmissions. The invention can be applied to an internal transmission attached to the front cranjk arms, to an intemal transmission fomiing part of a wheel hub, or to any similar transmission.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a bicycle shifting device includes a driver, a slave, a power transmission mechanism coupled between the driver and the slave for communicating rotational power from the driver to the slave tlirough a plurality of power transmission paths* and a clutch for selecting one of the plurality of power transmission paths in the power transmission mechanism. A clutch actuating mechanism causes the clutch to select the one of the plurality of power transmission paths when the driver is at a predetermined rotational position. If desired, the predetermined position may be a position where a strong drive force ii not being applied to the driver. In that case it may be desirable to have the clutch actuating mechanism cause the clutch to select each of the plurality of power transmission paths only when the diiver is at the predetermined rotational position.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a bicycle that incorporates a particular embodiment of an internal bicycle transmission according to the present invention. The bicycle shown is a<br>
recreational bicycle comprising a frame 1 with a double loop type of frame unit 2 and a front fork 3; a handle component 4; a saddle 11; a drive component 5 equipped with a two-speed internal shifting device crank 18; a front wheel 6; a rear w^heel 7; front and rear brake devices 8 (only front one shown in figure); and a shift control element 9 for conveniently operating the internal shifting device crank 18.<br>
The handle component 4 includes a handle stem 14 that is fixed to the upper portion of the fii^nt fork 3 and a handlebar 15 that is fixed to the handle stem 14. Brake levers 16 and grips 17, which constitute part of the brake devices 8, are mounted at either end of the handlebar 15. The shift control element 9 is mounted on the right-side brake lever 16, and it is linked by a gear-shift cable (described below) to the internal shifting device crank 18.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the shift control element 9 comprises a main imit 20, which is formed integrally with a brake bracket pivotably supporting the right-side (front wheel) brake lever 16, and a control element 23 rotatably mounted on the main unit 20. The main unit 20 comprises a dial 22 for displaying the selected speed (one of two speeds; H and L), In addition, the outer casing 21a of a gear-shift cable 21 is secured on the main unit 20. The<br><br>
inner wire 21b of the gear-shift cable 21 i^ secured in the control element 23, and it is advanced and retracted inside the outer casing 21a by the rotation of the control element 23.<br>
The drive component 5 comprises the internal shifting device crank 18, which is mounted on the cylindrical bottom bracket component 2a of the frame unit 2 (Fig, 3); a chain 19 wrapped around the internal shifting d£:vice crank 18; and a rear hub 10 on which a hub cog is mounted. As shown in Fig5. 3 and 4, the internal shifting device crank 18 comprises a bottom bracket axle (driver) 31, a bottom bracket 32 that is mounted in the bottom bracket component 2a of the frame unit 2 and that is designed to rotatably support the bottom bracket axle 31, left and right crank arms 33a and 33b nonrotatably linked to the left and right ends of the bottom bracket axle 31, a shifting device component 34 provided with two shift ratios and disposed around the outside of the bottom bracket axle 31, and a sprocket (slave) 35 linked to the bottom bracket axle 31 via the shifting device component 34. The bottom bracket axle 31 is a hollow cylindrical member having roughly rectangular (in cross section) tapered surfaces 3 la at both ends, with the left and right crank arms 33a and 33b nonrotatably mounted on the tapered surfeces 31a. Tlie crank amis 33a and 33b are fixed with lock bolts 31b.<br>
The bottom bracket 32 comprises a main cylindrical bracket unit 41 for supporting the bottom bi-acket axle 31, a cylindrical bottomed casing 42 integrally formed at the right end (Fig- 3) of the main bracket unit 41, and a cylindrical nut 43 mounted at the left end of the main bracket unit 41. The bottom bracket 32 is mounted in the bottom bracket component 2a by tightening the main bracket unit 41, \yti\ch is inserted through the right end of the bottom bracket component 2a, with the cylindrical nut 43.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the casing 42 comprises a wall component 42a, a cylindrical component 42b integrally formed vidth the wall component 42a around the outside of the wall component 42a, and a projection 42c around the inside of the wall component 42a.. An annular discoid guide plate 44 is secured with bolts to the wall component 42a of the casing 42 as shown in Fig. 5 so that the casing 42 is nonrotatably secured with the guide plate 44 on the frame unit 2. A stopper 44a secured to the frame unit 2, a cable catch 44b projecting forward fi'om the stopper 44a» and spring-securing element 44c (Fig. 4) are formed along the circumference of the guide nlate 44. One end of the outer casing 21a of the gear-shift cable<br><br>
21 (the other end of which is secured to the main unit 20 of the shift control element 9) is "sccwed with the cable catch 44b. One end of a coil spring 86 for the rearward urging of a below-mentioned rotary plate 81 (Fig. 6) is secured on the spring-securing element 44c.<br>
Of the crank anns 33a and 33b, the crank arm 33a on the left side has the same structwe as a conventional crank arm. The crank arm 33b on the right side has a pan-shaped housing element 50 near its base end^ and a boss 51 is formed in the center of the housing element 50. Part of the shifting device component 34 and a reversing one-way clutch 52 are mounted inside the housing element 50. The one-way clutch 52 transmits solely the backward rotation of the crank arms 33a and 33b to the sprocket 35 via the shifting device component 34, A right-side hub cone 53 is mounted around the outside of the boss 51 while allowed to mm by a prescribed angle in the direction of rotation, and the one-way clutch 52 is linked to the shifdng device component 34 via the right-side hub cone 53. A cage 53a for disengaging the below-described one-way clutch 55 during reverse rotation is fixed to the surface on the left side of the right-side hub cone 53.<br>
The shifting device component 34 comprises a planet gear mechanism 60 having two power transmission paths (a direct-coupled transmission path and a downshifted transmission path)» a clutch mechanism 61 for selecting one of the two power transmission paths, and a clutch-actuating mechanism 62 designed to force the clutch mechanism 61 to perform selection procedures, thus allowing at least one of these selection procedures to be performed in alignment with the top dead center and bottom dead center of the crank arms 33a and 33b,<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the planet gear mechanism 60 comprises a sun gear 63 disposed inside the casing 42 and linked to the bottom bracket axle 31 via the one-way clutch 55, a gear ring 64 formed around the inside of the cylindrical component 42b of the casing 42, three planet gears 65 (only one is shown) meshing with the sun gear 63 and gear ring 64, and a earner 66 for rotatably supporting the three planet gears 65. The sun gear 63 is disposed coaxially with the bottom bracket axle 31 around the outside thereof, and it is linked to the bottom bracket axle 31 via the one-way clutch 55. The one-way clutch 55 transmits solely the forward rotation (clockwise rotation in Fig. 4) of the bottom bracket axle 31 to the sun gear 63. The three planet gears 65 are spaced at regular intervals in the circumferential direction<br><br>
and are provided with a large gear 65a and a hub cog 65b, which are aligned in the axial . direction. The large gear 65a meshes with the gear ring 64. and the hub cog 65b meshes with the sun gear 63. The planet gears 65 are rotatably supported by a cog axle 67 on the carrier 66.<br>
The carrier 66 is a roughly cylindrical member having in its outer circumferential portion three spaces for accommodating the three planet gears 65. The outer circumferential surface of the left end of the carrier 66 is rotatably supported in the casing 42 by a bearing component 69. The carrier 66 can thus rotate around the bottom bracket axle 31. Tlie sprocket 35 is nonrotatably mounted on the right end of the carrier 66. The one-way clutch 52 is mounted on the inner circumferential surface at the right end of the carrier 66, and the clutch mechanism 61 is mounted on the imier circumferential surface at the left end of the carrier 66.<br>
The clutch mechanism 61 transmits solely the forward rotation of the bottom bracket axle 31 in the "clutch-on" or engaged state to the carrier 66, and separates the carrier 66 and the bottom bracket axle 31 in the "clutch-off" or disengaged state. The clutch mechanism 61 comprises two lock pawls 70 mounted on the bottom bracket axle 31 while allowed to pivot between a linked state and a disengaged state, a spring member 71 for urging the two lock pawls 70 toward a linked state, and a lock tooth 72 formed on the inner circumferential surface of the carrier 66. The lock pawls 70 are disposed facing the inner circumferential portion at the left end of the carrier 66 and are spaced at regular intervals in the circumferential direction. The lock tooth 72 formed in the shape of a wave on the inner circumferential that faces the lock pawls 70 of the canier 66. As a result, the carrier 66 rotates backward via the one-way clutch 52 N^en the crank arms 33a and 33b rotate backward (counterclockwise direction in Fig. 4), and the carrier 66 rotates forward together with the bottom bracket axle 31 when the bottom bracket axle 31 rotates forward (clockwise direction in Fig. 4), with the clutch mechanism 61 in the "on" state.<br>
The clutch-actuating mechanism 62 is a mechanism for forcibly moving the lock pawls 70 of the clutch mechanism 61 from' a linked state to a separated state. As shown in Figs. 5-7, Ae clutch-actuating mechanism 62 comprises a cam plate 80 disposed such that it<br><br>
faces the left side of the carrier 66 across a gap, a facing roiary plate 81 disposed such that the wall component 42a of the casing 42 is sandwiched between the cam plate 80 and the rotary plate 81, three link pins 82 for Unking tlie cam plate 80 and the rotary plate 81, and three coiJ springs 83 for urging the cam plate 80 toward the cairier 66-<br>
The cam plate 80 is supported on the wall component 42a of the casing 42 by the three link pins 82 wliile allowed to move axially to the left and right. In addition, the inner circumferential portion of cam plate 80 is movably supported by the projection 42c of the casing 42, Cams 85 protruding toward tlie carrier 66 ait foraied at two locations separated by 180 degrees. The cams 85 comprise a flat surface 85a extending to the right in Fig. 5 and a sloping guide surface 85b foraied such tlial the outer circumference of the flat suifsce S5a is extended beyond its inner circumference in the direction of a reference surface 85c below the flat surface 85a. The cams 85 are designed to move the lock pawJs 70 of the clutch mechanism 61 from the linked state to the separated state by using the rotation of the bottom bracket axle 31 during lock release. More specificaUy&gt; the guide surfaces 85b of the cams 85 are designed to guide the lock pawls 70 along the inner circumferential surface of the cam plate 80 when the lock pawls 70 have been lowered from the linked state to the separated state by the rotation of the bottom bracket axle 31. These guide surfaces 85b are formed at positions in which the two lock pawls 70 are simultaneously lowered into a separated state when the crank aims 33a and 33b are in the vicinity of the top dead center and bottom dead center.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the rotary plate 81 is shaped as a notched ring, with three through holes 81a for accepiing the tiiree link pins 82 spaced at regular intervals in the circumferential direction. The rotaiy plate 81 is rotatably supported in the casing 42 through the intermediary of the three link pins 82 passing via the through holes 81a. Cam components 87 are formed on the left side in Fig* 6 in tlie areas where ]he through holes 81a are provided. The cam components 87 comprise a flat surface 87a protruding to the left and a slanted surface 87b sloping from the flat surface 87a in the circumferential direction toward a reference surface 87c below the flat surface 87a. A stopper plate 82a to which functions as a cam follower for the cam components 87 is mounted on the link pins 82 and is caused to move to the left and right by the rotation of the rotary plate 81, Tlie coil springs 83 are disposed in compressed<br><br>
itatc around the outsides of the link pins 82, thus urging the cam plate 80 to the right in Fig.<br>
A radially extending projection 81b, which is provided to one end of the rotary plate n, comprises a concavity 81c and a spring stopper 8Id, A stopper nut 89 secured to the inner ;able 21b of the gear-shift cable 21 is mounted in the concavity 81c. In addition, one end of he coil spring 86 (the other end of which is secured to the spring-securing element 44c of the juide plate 44) is secured to the spring stopper 8 Id. The rotary plate 81 is thus constantly irged clockwise in Fig. 6.<br>
The shifting device component 34 transmits motive power along one of the following wo power transmission paths: 1) a direct-coupled transmission path for transwiitting motive )pwer from the bottom bracket axle 31 directly to the sprocket 35 via the clutch mechanism 51 and carrier 66; and 2) a downshifted transmission path for transmitting motive power to he sprocket 35 via the sim gear 63, planet gears 65, and carrier 66.<br>
The rotary plate 81 is pulled by the inner cable 21a when the transmission is in tlie iirect-coupled state. Wlien this happens, the link pins 82 are on the left and the cam plate 80 ■etracts to the standby position on the left side when the stopper plate 82a rests on the flat iurfaces 87a of the cam components 87, as shown in Fig. 7. In this state, the lock pawls 70 of he bottom bracket axle 31 remain in a lixiked state, unimpeded by the cam plate SO. As a ■esult, the rotation of the bottom bracket axle 31 is transmitted directly to the carrier 66 via he lock pawls 70 of the clutch mechanism 61, and then on to the sprocket 35 from the carrier 56. The sprocket 35 therefore rotates at the same high speed as the bottom bracket axle 31.<br>
When, however, th^ shift control element 9 is moved to a lower speed, the inner cable l\h of the gear-shift cable 21 becomes loose, and the rotary plate 81 is pulled by the coil spring 86 and caused to rotate in the clockwise direction in Fig. 6. When this happens^ the cam plate 80 is urged by the coil springs 83 and pushed to the tight toward the operating position as shown in Figure 8 because the stopper plate 82a is disposed below the flat surface 87a.<br><br>
Rotating the bottom bracket axle 31 in this state causes the tips of the lock pawls 70 to ' be guided along the inner circumference when the lock pawls 70 reach the guide surfaces 85b of the cams B5 as a resuh of this rotation. When the guided lock pawls 70 have reached the inner circumferential surface of the cam plate 80. the cam plate 80 urged by the coil springs 83 is pushed farther to the right, and the lock pawls 70 enter the inner circumferential surfece of the cam plate 80, collapsing from the linked state to the separated state, as shown in Fig- 8. The rotation of the bottom bracket axle 31 is transmitted from the one-way clutch 55 to the carrier 66 via the sim gear 63 when the lock pawls 70 have been lowered into the separated state. The sprocket 35 therefore rotates at a lower speed.<br>
The timing for bringing down the lock pawls 70 is detemiined by the position in which the cams 85 are located, and in this embodiment it is synchronized with the positioning of the crank arras 33a and 33b in the vicinity of the top dead center or bottom dead center. The lock pawls 70 can therefore be smoothly lowered because virtually no motive power is transmitted by these pawls at this time.<br>
The shift ratio R - (Tl x T3)/((T1 x T3) + (T2 y^ T4)), where Tl is the number of teeth of the large gear 65a, T2 is the number of teeth of the hub cog 65b, T3 is tiie number of teeth of the sun gear 63, and T4 is the nimiber of teeth of the gear ring 64. Assuming that Tl - 24, T2 = 15, T3 = 51, and T4 « 90, and substituting these numerical values into the above equation, we obtain 0.4755 for the shift ratio R. hi other words, the sprocket 35 performs 0.4755 of a rotation every time the bottom bracket axle 31 makes one full turn.<br>
Here, the rotational speed of the sprocket 35 during downshifting is about V2 tliat maintained during direct coupling. Thus, in comparison with a case in which the planetary gears consists of a Single toothed component, greater downshifting can be achieved by configuring the planet gears 65 ftrom large gear 65a and a hub cog 65b, and arranging the components such that the large gear 65a meshes with the gear ring 64, and the hub cog 65b meshes with the svm gear 63.<br>
Rotating the crank amis 33a and 33b backward causes the bottom bracket axle 31 and the right-side hub cone 53 to rotate a prescribed angle relative to each other, and tiie cage 53a<br><br>
disengages the pawls of the one-way clutch 55. This is done in order to prevent a Situation in 'which the sun gear 63 rotated by the carrier 66 via the planet gears 65 during reverse rotation is rotated at a higher speed than tlie bottom bracket axle 31 and becomes locked by the two one-way clutches 52 and 55. As a result, no motive power is transmitted to the planet gear mechanism 60 via the clutch mechanism 61 or the one-way clutch 55 in any gear-shifting position. In this embodiment, motive power is transmitted to tlae carrier 66 via the one*.way clutch 52, and the sprocket 35 is rotated in reverse, As a result, braking can be performed by rotating the rear hub 10 backward, even when a coaster brake is mounted on the rear hub 10. It is, however, unnecessary to mount the one-way clutch 52 or cage 53a on a rear hub which does not have a coaster brake.<br>
As a result of the present invention, gears can be shifted in any state because the clutch mechanism 61 can be directly selected and actuated by the clutch-actuating mechanism 62 and because the gears can be selected and shifted ftom a higher speed step to a lower speed step when the arrangement is aligned with the top dead center or bottom dead center of the crank arms 33a and 33b. The gears can therefore be shifted with little exertion without any increase in weight or cost.<br>
Willie the above is a description of various embodiments of the present invention, finrtiier modifications may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the size, shape, location or orientation of the various components may be changed as desired. The ftmctions of one element may be performed by two, and vice versa.<br>
Although the described embodiment was directed to a front shifting device, the present invention can also be applied to a rear shifting device in which the driver is rotatably supported on the hub axle of a bicycle in order to mount a hub cog linked to the sprocket 35 with a chain 19, and in which the slave is mounted inside the rear hub 10 (which is a hub shell component of the rear wheel of the bicycle).<br>
Although the described embodiment showed the clutch mechanism being actuated by<br><br>
a cam, the structure of the clutch-actuating mechanism is not Jimiied to this cam alone. Although the described embodiment pertained to a case in which the present invention was applied to a two-speed shifting device, the number of speed steps is not limited to two and can be any number greater than two. Furthermore^ although the described embodiment showed two power transmission paths through a planet gear mechanism, tlie direct-coupled transmission path does not necessarily involve a planet gear mechanism and may comprise a directly coupled driver and slave.<br>
Thus, the scope of the invention should not be limited by the specific structures disclosed. Instead, the true scope of the invention should be determined by the following claims.<br><br><br><br>
1. A bicycle shifting device conjprising;<br>
a driver;<br>
a slave;<br>
a power transmission mechanism coupled between the driver and the slave for communicating rotational power from the driver to the slave tlirough a plurality of power transmission paths;<br>
