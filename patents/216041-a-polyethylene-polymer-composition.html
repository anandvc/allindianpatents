This invention relates to polyethylene compositions having a unique<br>
balance of properties. Preferred polyethylene compositions may be easily<br>
"processed" to produce plastic films having very good tear strength, impact<br>
strength and optical properties.<br>
BACK GROUND ART<br>
Linear low density polyethylene ("LLOPE") copolymers that are<br>
prepared by the copolymerization of ethylene with a higher alpha olefin,<br>
using 3 conventional Ziegler-Natta type catalyst system are known to<br>
contain three different polymer fractions (or "modes"), namely 1) a low<br>
molecular weight fraction which contains a high comonomer content: 2) a<br>
copolymer fraction of intermediate molecular weight and intermediate<br>
comonomer content and 3) a high molecular weight fraction which .<br>
contains little or no comonomer. The low molecular weight fraction is<br>
sometimes also described as being "highly branched" (due to the high<br>
comonomer content) and/or "grease" (due to the low molecular weight).<br>
The high molecular weight content is also sometimes described as<br>
"homopolymer". The "grease" traction often causes organoleptic problems<br>
and may even limit or restrict uses in the which the polymer in contact<br>
with food. The "homopotymer" fraction generally imparts a stiffness to the<br>
resin and melts at a higher temperature than the other fractions. In<br>
general, the non-uniformity of the molecular weight and the comonomer<br>
content is a distinguishing characteristic of conventional Ziegler resins. It<br>
In contrast, "homogeneous" polyethylene copolymers are generally<br>
characterized by having a narrow molecular weight distribution and a<br>
narrow composition distribution. The term "homogeneous" was proposed<br>
by one of us to describe such polymers in United States Patent (USP)<br>
3.645,992 (Elston), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by-<br>
reference.<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 2 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
2<br>
	As noted in Elston '992, homogeneous polymers have a distinct<br>
melting point due to the uniform polymer architecture. The homogeneous<br>
polymers disclosed in the Elston '992 patent were prepared with a<br>
vanadium catalyst system which is insufficiently active to permit<br>
Advances in catalyst technology now permit the production of<br>
homogeneous ethylene eopolymers at commercially viable rates. For<br>
example, She metallocenelaminoxane catalysts disclosed by Kamlnsky<br>
(USP 4,542,199) and improved by Welbom (USP 5,324,800); the '<br>
monocyclopentadienyl catalysts disclosed by Stevens et al. (USP i<br>
5.064,802) and Canich (USP 5,055,438); the ketimine catalysts disclosed<br>
by McMeeking et at. (USP 6,114,431); and the phosphinimine catalysts<br>
disclosed by Stephan at al (USP 6,063,879) are all highly active for the<br>
preparation of homogeneous copolymers.<br>
	A particularly important end use of LLDPE is the manufacture of<br>
films. Films prepared from homogeneous LLDPE generally have good<br>
optical properties, good organoleptic properties and excellent impact<br>
strength.<br>
	However, films prepared from homogeneous LLDPE generally have<br>
poor tear strength, particularly in the so-called "machine direction". In<br>
addition, homogeneous resins are difficult to 'process" (i.e. to convert to<br>
films). This poor processability is manifested by high energy demands<br>
required to extrude the resin (e.g. large current draws on the electric<br>
motors used to drive the extrudes) and/or poor melt strength-<br>
Attempts have been made to blend heterogeneous (Ziegler-Natta,<br>
or"Z/N") resins with homogeneous resins in order to produce a resin blend<br>
which is easier to convert to film and/or to produce film having higher<br>
impact strength and good tear properties. USP 5,530,065 (Farley, to<br>
Exxon) teaches that a trivial blend of a conventional heterogeneous Z/N<br>
resin and a metallocene resin has a balance of properties which are<br>
suitable for some film properties. Similarly, USP 5,844,045 and 5,869,575<br>
(Kolthamer, to Dow) also disclose that simple blends of a conventional<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
3<br>
heterogeneous Z/N resin and homogeneous resin prepared with a.<br>
monocyclopentadienyl catalyst are also suitable for preparing films.<br>
	However, it will also be appreciated that the simple blends of the<br>
above '065, '045 and '575 patents all contain the low molecular weight<br>
"grease" due to the use of the Z/N catalyst to prepare some of the blend<br>
composition. Moreover, the disclosures of the "065, 045 and "575 patents<br>
are silent with respect to the hexane extractables contents of the blends.<br>
	Thus, films prepared from conventional heterogeneous resins have<br>
comparatively poor Impact strength, optical properties and organoleptic<br>
properties â€” but do have very good tear strength. Conversely, films<br>
prepared from homogeneous resins have excellent impact strength, optical<br>
properties and organoleptic properties-- but poor tear strength. Previous<br>
attempts to utilize resin blends to eliminate this problem have not been<br>
completely successful. Simple blends of heterogeneous resins with<br>
homogeneous resins provide films with sub-optimal orcrsnoleptic<br>
properties (presumably because of the "grease" fraction or made in the<br>
conventional heterogeneous resin).<br>
	Another attempt to solve This problem Is by preparing blends of<br>
more than one homogeneous resin is disclosed in USP 5.382,630. and<br>
5,382,631 (Stehling etal, to EXXON). Stehling al. '631 teach blends<br>
which are characterized by the substantial absence of blend components<br>
having a higher molecular weight and a lower comonomer content than<br>
other blend components (e.g. the high molecular weight homopolymer of<br>
conventional heterogeneous resins. These blends are shown to be useful<br>
-for the preparation of structures having improved tear properties,<br>
However, the disclosure of this patent is silent on the subject of impact<br>
suffer a very large loss of dart impact strength where the amount of lower<br>
molecular weight higher density component is sufficient to enhance tear<br>
strength .One of us disclosed a dual reactor solution polymerization<br>
process to prepare a homogeneous copolymer composition which is useful<br>
for the preparation of films (Brown, USP 6,372,864). None of the inventive<br><br>

4<br>
copolymer compositions disclosed in Brown S64 contained the high<br>

	Thus, Films prepared from conventional heterogeneous resins have<br>
comparatively poor impact strength, optical properties and organoleptic I<br>
properties - but do have very good tear strength. Conversely, films <br>
prepared from homogeneous resins have excellent impact strength, optical<br>
properties and organoleptic properties - but poor tear strength. Previous<br>
attempts to utilize resin blends to eliminate this problem have not been<br>
completely successful- Simple blends of heterogeneous resins with<br>
homogeneous resins provide films with sub-optimal organoleptic<br>
properties and optical properties (presumably because of the "grease"<br>
fraction or made In the conventional heterogeneous resin), <br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
	We have now discovered a heterogenized/homogeneous polymer<br>
composition which may be used to prepare films having an improved<br>
balance of impact strength, tear strength and organoleptic propertis.<br>
	In addition the heterogenized/homogeneous polymer compositions<br>
of this invention are surprisingly easy to "process" in machinery used to |<br>
convert the compositions into films (in comparison to homogeneous<br>
resins.<br>
The heterogenized/homogeneous polymer compositions must be<br>
prepared using a "homogeneous catalyst" - i.e. a catalyst system that will<br>
produce homogeneous polymers (having a narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution and a narrow composition distribution) In a conventional<br>
polymerization reactor. In addition, the hetorogenized/homogeneous<br>
polymer compositions of this invention must contain at least one first<br>
copolymer fraction and a second high molecular weight/high density<br>
fraction. This second fraction is somewhat analogous to the<br>
"homopolymer" fraction of heterogeneous resins, In this sense, the<br>
compositions may be referred to as being "heterogenized". Thus, the<br>
polymer compositions of this Invention are made with "homogenous"<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
5<br>
components prepared with a "homogeneous" catalyst system but they<br>
must also contain a high molecular weight, high density component which<br>
is analogous to a "heterogeneous" resin.<br>
	Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
heterogenized/homogeneous polymer composition prepared with a<br>
homogeneous catalyst system, said composition comprising:<br>
	A) a first polymer fraction having a density of from 0.880 to<br>
0.945 grams per cubic centimeter as measured by ASTM D792: a melt<br>
index, (2, of from 0.1 to 200 grams per 10 minutes as determined by ASTM<br>
D1238,- less then 2 weight % hexane extractables: and a substantial<br>
absence of homopolyrner wherein said first polymer fraction comprises at<br>
least one homogeneous copolymer of ethylene and at least one C4to 10<br>
alpha olefin, and wherein each of said at least one homogeneous<br>
copolymer is characterized by having a molecular weight distribution.<br>
Mw/Mn, of less then three; and<br>
		B) a second polymer fraction having a higher molecular weight<br>
then said first fraction; a higher density then said first fraction; and a lower<br>
alpha olefin content then said first fraction, wherein said second polymer<br>
fraction comprises at least one second homogeneous polymer of ethylene.<br>
optionally with at least one C4to10 alpha olefin comonomer, and wherein<br>
each of said at least one second homogoneous polymer of elthylene is<br>
characterized by having a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, of less<br>
then 3.<br>
	As noted above, the second traction must have both of a higher<br>
molecular weight and a lower comonomer content than the first fraction.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it is extremely<br>
difficult to prepare such a polyrner composition by a simple mechanical<br>
blend of the two polymer fractions. Accordingly, if is highly preferred to<br>
prepare the present compositions by solution blending - especially via a<br>
solution polymerization process in which the fractions are blended in situ.<br>
It is particularly preferred to use two continuously stirred tank reactors<br>
(CSTRs) to prepare the compositions - although a single tube reactor<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
6<br>
(plug. flow reactor) or a combination of a tube reactor and a CSTR may<br>
also be suitably employed.<br>
	The compositions of this invention may be used to prepare a wide<br>
variety of goods including injection molded parts, rotomolded parts and<br>
film. Preferred compositions which are described in more detail below are<br>
especially suitable for the preparation of films. The film may be prepared<br>
by conventional "cast" or "blown bubble" techniques. Monolayer films or<br>
multilayer films (prepared by coextruslon of multiple layers of laminates)<br>
are possible. The resulting films may be used to package foods and I<br>
consumer goods in sealed packages, including sealed packages for<br>
Iiquid. The films are also suitable for preparing trash bags, "heavy duly<br>
packages" (for such goods as peat moss-and other gardening items<br>
including bark, fertilizer and decorative gravel - that are exposed to the<br>
outdoors in gardening centers); shrink films (which may be used in high<br>
performance packaging for poultry or cuts of meat); pallet wraps (to protect<br>
goods on pallets during shipping and/or outdoor storage); and stretch<br>
films.<br>
	The plastic parts and films prepared from the polymer compositions<br>
of this invention may include conventional additives such as antioxidants<br>
(e.g. hindered phenols and phosphates); UV stabilizers such as hindered<br>
amines; antiblocks (e.g. talc and silica); antistatic agents (e.g. low<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycol); processing aids (e.g.<br>
fluoropolymers and polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of from<br>
2.000 to 8,000); pigments and the like.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Part1. (Description of Catalysts<br>
	In general, any catalyst system which produces a "homogeneous"<br>
(as defined by Elston '922) ethylene capolymer may be used to prepare<br>
the composition of this invention. It is preferred to use a catalyst of a<br>
group 4 metal which provides an activity of at least 250,000 grams of<br>
polymer per gram of group 4 metal. Preferred catalysts contain at least<br>
one cyclopentadienyl ligand. Examples of such catalysts are disclosed in+<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
7<br>
the aforesaid Welbom '800. Stevens '802. Stephan '879 and McMeaking<br>
'481 patents.<br>
	A preferred catalyst used In the process of this invention is an<br>
organometallic complex of a group 3,4 or 5 metal which is characterized<br>
by having a cyclopentadienyl ligand (as defined in section 1.3 below) and<br>
a phosphinimine ligand(as defined in section1.2.1below)or a kitimide<br>
ligand (as defined in section 1.2.2 below],<br>
	Any such organometallic having a phosphinimine ligand which<br>
displays catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization may be employed.<br>
Preferred catalysts are defined by the formula:<br><br>
wherein M is a transition metal selected from 71, Hf and Zr (as described in<br>

or hafnium. It is especially preferred that the catalyst contain one<br>
phosphinimine ligand, one cyclopentadienyl ligand, and two "X" ligands<br>
(which are preferably both chloride),<br>

the Elements using lUPAC nomenclature). The preferred metals are from<br>
group 4, (e.g. titanium, hafnium or zirconium) with titanium being most<br>
Preferred.<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
8 '<br>
1.2.1 PhosphInlmine Ligand<br>
	A preferred catatysl contains a phosphinimlne ligand which is<br>
covslently bonded to the metal. This ligand is defined by the formula:<br><br>
	wherein each R1 is independently selected from the group consisting of a<br>
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals which are<br>
unsubstituted by or further substituted by a halogen atom, a C1-8 alkoxy<br>
radical, a C6 10 aryl aryloxy radical, an amido radical, a silyl radical of the<br>
formula:<br>
	Si-(R2)3<br>
	wherein each R2 is independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, a C1-8 or alkoxy radical, C6-10 or aryloxy radicals, and , a<br>
germanyl radical of the formula;<br>
	Ge-(R2)3<br>
wherein R2 is as defined above.<br>
	The preferred phosphinimlnes are those in which each R1 is a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical. A particularly preferred phosphinimine is tri-(tertiary<br>
butyl) phosphinimine (i.e. where each R1 is a tertiary butyl group).<br>
1.2.2 Ketirmide Ligads<br>
	As used herein, the term "ketimide ligand" refers to a ligand which;<br>
(a) is bonded to the transmission metal via a metal-nitroge atom bond;(b)<br>
has a single substituent on the nitrogen atom, (where this single<br>
Substituent is a carbon atom which is doubly bonded to the N atom); and<br>
(c) has two substituents (Sub 1 and Sub 2. described below) which are '<br>
bonded to the carbon atom.<br>
	Conditions a,b and c are illustrated below.<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
9<br><br>
	The substituents "Sub 1 and Sub 2" may be the same or different.<br>
Exemplary substituents include hydrocarbyls having from 1 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms; sllyl groups, amido groups and phosphido groups. For reasons of<br>
cost and convenience it is preferred that these substituents both be<br>
hydrocarbyls, especially simple alkyls and most preferably lertiary butyl.<br>
1.3 	Cycfopentadienvl Ligands i<br>
	Preferred catalysts are group 4 organometallic complexes which<br>
contain one phosphinimine ligand or ketimide ligand and one<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand.<br>
	As used herein, the term cyclopentadienyl ligand is meant to<br>
convey its broad meaning, namely a ligand having a five carbon ring which<br>
is bonded to the metal via eta-5 bonding. Thus, the term<br>
"cyclopentadienyl" includes unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, substituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl. unsubstituted Indenyl, substituted indenyt, unsubstituted<br>
fluorenyl and substituted fluorenyl. An exemplary list of substituents for a<br>
cyclopentadlenyl ligand includes the group consisting of C1-10 hydrocarbyl<br>
radical (which hydrocarbyl substituents are unsubstituted or further<br>
substituted); a halogen atom, C1-8 alkoxy radical, a C6-10aryl or aryioxy<br>
radical; an amido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to two<br>
C1-8 alkyl radicals; a phosphido radical which is unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; silyl radicals of the formula â€”Si-<br>
(R)3 wherein each R is independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, a C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical C6-10 arly or aryloxy radicals;<br>
germanyl radicals of the fomula Geâ€”(R)3 wherein R is as defined directly<br>
above.<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
10<br>
1.4	 Activatable Ligand X<br>
	The term "activatable llgand" refers to a llgand which may be<br>
activated by a cocafalyst (also referred to as an "activator"). to facilitate<br>
olefin polymerization. Exemplary activatable ligands are independently<br>
selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a<br>
C1-10 hydrocarbyl radical, a C1-10 alkoxy radical, a C5-10 aryl oxide radical:<br>
each of which said hydrocarbyl, alkoxy, and aryl oxide radicals may be<br>
unsubstituted by or further substituted by a halogen atom, a C1-8 alkyl<br>
radical, a C1-8 alkoxy radical, a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical, an amldo <br>
radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl<br>
radicals; a phosphldo radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to<br>
two C1-8 alkyl radicals.<br>
	The number of activatable llgands depends upon the valency of the<br>
metal and the valency of the activatable ligand. For example, a single<br>
divalent activatable ligand (such as butadiene) may be used with a group 4<br>
metal in the 4* oxidation slate. The preferred catalyst metals are group 4<br>
metals in their highest oxidation slate (i.e. 4') and the preferred activatable<br>
ligands are monoanionic (such as a halide - especially chloride or a alkyl -<br>
especially methyl). Thus, the preferred catalyst contain a phosphinimlne<br>
ligand, a cyclopentadienyl ligand and two chloride (or methyl) ligands<br>
bonded to the group 4 metal. In some instances, the metal of the catalyst<br>
component may not be in the highest oxidation state. For example, a I<br>
titanium (111) component would contain only one activable ligand. |<br>
1.5	 Summary Description of Preferred Catalyst<br>
	As previously noted, The most preferred catalyst is a group 4<br>
organometallic comptex in its highest oxidation state having a<br>

decribed in more deatail in section 2.1and 2.2 below.<br>
	2.1 	Alumoxane<br>
	The alumoxane may be of the formula:<br>
		(R4)2AIO(R4AIO)mAl(R4)2<br>
wherein each R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals and m is from 0 to 50, preferably R4 is a C1-8<br><br>
-WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
	12<br>
alkyl radical and m is from 5 to 30. Mathylalumoxane (or "MAO") in which<br>
each R is methyl is the preferred alumoxana.<br>
	Alumoxanes ara well known as cocatalysts, particularly for<br>
metallocene-type catalysts. Alumoxanes are also readily available articles<br>
	The use or an alumonxane cocatalyst generally requites a molar ratio<br>
of aluminum to the transition metal in the catalyst from 20:1 lo 1000:1.<br>
Preferred ratios are from 50:1 to 250:1.<br>
	Commercially available MAO typically contains free aluminum alkyl<br>
(e.g. trimethylaluminum or "TMA") which may reduce catalyst activity<br>
and/or broaden the molecular weight distribution of the polymer. If a<br>
narrow molecular weight distribution polymer is required, jt is preferred to<br>
treat such commercially available MAO with an additive which is capable<br>
of reading with the TMA. Alcohols are preferred (with hindered phenols<br>
being particularly preferred) for this purpose. I<br>
2.2 	"Ionic Activators' Cocatalysts '<br>
	So-called 'ionic activators" are also well known for metallocene<br>
catalysts. See, for example. USP 5.198,401 (Hlathcy and Tumer) and USP<br>
5.132,380 (Stevens and Neilhamer).<br>
	Whilst not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is thought by those<br>
skilled in the art that "ionic activators" initially cause the	 abstraction of one<br>
or more of the activatable ligands In a manner which ionizes the catalyst<br>
into a cation, then provides a bulky, labile, non-coordinating anion which<br>
stabilizes the catalyst in a cationic form. The bulky, non-coordinating<br>
anion permits olefin polymerization to proceed at the cationic catalyst<br>
center (presumably because the non-coordinating anioin is sufficiently<br>
labile to be displaced by monomer which coordinates to the catalyst.<br>

	(i) compounds of the formula [R5]'B(R7)4]'wherein B is a<br>
boron atom, R5- is a aromatic hydrocarbyl (e.g. triphenyl methyl cation) and<br>

radicals which are unsubstituted or substituted with from 3 to 5<br>

alkyl or alkoxy radical which is unsubstituted or ubstituied by a fluorine<br>
atom; and a silyl radical of the formula S-(R9)3; wherein each R9 is<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom and<br>
a C1-4 alkyl radical; and<br>
	(ii) compounds at the Fomula [(R8) ZH][B(R7)4] wherein B is a<br>

radicals, a phenyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to<br>
three C1-4 alkyl radicals, or one R8 taken together with the nitrogen atom<br>
may form an anillnium radical and R7 is as defined above; and<br>
	(iii) compounds of the formula B(R7)3 wherein R7 is as detined<br>
above.<br>
	In the above compound preferably R7 is a pentafluorophenly<br>
radical, and R5 is a Iriphenylmethyl cation, Z is a nitrogen atom and R8 is a<br>
C1-4 alkyl radical or R8 taken together with the nitrogen atom forms an<br>
anilinium radical which is substituted by two C1-4 alkyl radicals.<br>
	The"ionic activator "may abstract one or more activatabte ligands<br>
	so as to ionizing catalyst center into a cation but not to covalenlly bond<br>
with the catalyst to provide sufficient distance between the catalyst<br>
and the ionizig active to permit a polymerizable olefin to enter the<br>

	The heterogeneous/homogeneous copolymer compositions which<br>
may be prepared in accordance with the present invention are preferably<br>
U-DPE'S which typically comprise not less than 60, preferably not less<br>
than 75 weight % of ethylena and the balance one or more C*-Â«, alpha<br>

0.935 glce. The present invention might also be useful to prepare<br>
polyethylene having a density below 0,910 g/cc - the so-called very low<br>
and ultra low density polyetiiylenes.<br>
	Generally (he alpfra olefin may be present in an amount from about<br>
3 to 30 weight %. preferably from about 4 to 25 weight %.<br>
	The monomers are dissolved/dispersed in the solvent either prior to<br>
being fed to the first reactor (or for gaseous monomers the monomer may-<br>
be fed to the reactor SD that it will dissolve in the reaction mixture). Prior to<br>
mixing, the solvent and monomers are generally purified to remove<br>
potential catalyst poisons such as water, oxygen or metal impurities. The<br>
feedstock purification follows standard practices in the art, e.g. molecular<br>
sieves, alumina beds and oxygen removal catalysts are used for the<br>
purification of monomers. The solvent itself as well (e.g. methyl pentahe,<br>
cyctohexsne, hexann or toluene) is preferably treated in a similar manner.<br>
	Tha feedstock may be heated or cooled prior to feeding to the first<br>
reactor. Additional rnonomers and solvent may be added to the second<br>
reactor, and it may be heated or cooled.<br>
	Generally, the catalyst components may be premised in the solvent<br>
for the reaction orfed as separat stream to each reactor.In some<br>
Instances premixing it may be desirable to provide a reaction time for the<br>
catalyst components prior to entering the reaction. Such an in line<br>
mixing" technique is described in a number of patents in the name of<br>
DuPont Canada Inc (e.g. USP 5.589,555, issued December 31,1996).<br>
	The residence time in each reactor will depend on the design and<br>
the capacity of the reactor. Generally the reactors should be operated<br>
under conditions to achieve good mixing of the reactants. In addition, it is<br>
preferred that from 20 to 60 weight % of the final polymer is polymerized In<br>
the first reaclor, with the balance being polymerized in the second reactor.<br>
On leaving the reactor system the solvent is removed and the resulting<br>
polymer is finished in a conventional manner.<br>
	In a highly preferred embodiment, the first polymerization reactor<br>
has a smaller volume than the second polymerization reactor. In addition<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
17<br>
	the first polymerization reactor is preferably operated at a colder<br>
temperature than the second reactor.<br>
Preferred Polymer Compositions<br>
	Polyethylene resins are often converted to finished products by a<br>
melt extrusion process. Extrusion processes generally produce more<br>
"drawdown" of the polyethylene melt in the machine direction (MD) than<br>
the transverse direction (TD) due to the force which is required to "draw<br>
the melt through the extrusion die. This typically produces a finished<br>
plastic part with unbalanced mechanical properties which vary with the<br>
orientation or direction of measurement A common example of this<br>
phenomenon is illustrated by considering an injection molded plastic cup.<br>
These cups are usually fabricated by forcing the plastic melt through an<br>
Injection port at the base of the cup mold thus producing a flow from the<br>
base of the cup to the lip of the cup in a lengthwise direction. The finished<br>
plastic cup therefore has a "machine direction" along the length of the cup<br>
and is more prone to split or tear in this lengthwise direction (i.e. the cup is<br>
less prone to fail around the circumference or "transverse direction").<br>
An analogous phenomenon is observed with polyethylene films.<br>
That is, extiuded plastic films generally have poor "machine direction" tear<br>
strength in comparison to transverse directionh tear slrength.This may be<br>
referred to as a tear strength imbalance. It has been observed that this<br>
effect (i.e. MD vs. TD tear Imbalance) becomes more pronounced in films<br>
prepared from heterogeneous ethylene-butene copolymers as the<br>
molecular weight of the copolymer increases. That is, the relative MD vs.<br>
TD imbalance becomes more pronounced in films prepared from higher<br>
molecular weight heterogeneous copolymers. While not wishing to be<br>
bound by theory, it is postulated that this phenomenon is a result of the<br>
greater stress which is required to extrude the higher molecular weight<br>
copolymer (which in turn gives rise to a higher orientation of the polymer<br>
molecules and thereby causes a higher MD/TD imbalance).<br>
	This phenomenon has also been observed to become even more<br>
pronounced with homogeneous resins. While again not wishing to be<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
18<br>
bound by theory, it is believed that the uniform structure of a<br>
homogeneous resin causes the polymer molecules to be very uniformly<br>
oriented during melt extrusion. In any event, the MD tear of films prepared<br>
from homogeneous polymers is generally very poor. However, the impact<br>
strength of films prepared from homogeneous polymers is usually<br>
excellent.<br>
	As previously noted, It is Known to prepare homogeneous ethylene<br>
polymer compositions in which a fraction or blend component of the |<br>
composition contains a higher density but lower molecular weight then the<br>
other polymer fraction (e.g. me Stehting et al. '631 patent and the<br>
commercially available EXCEEDâ„¢ 1016 resin).<br>
	In contrast, the compositions of this invention must contain a<br>
second" polymer fraction which is both higher molecular weight and<br>
higher density (or alternatively stated, "less branched') than the first<br>
copolymer fraction. It is preferred that this high molecular weight/high<br>
density fraction be present in an amount of from 1 to 20 weight %,<br>
especially from 2 to 10 weight %, of the total polymer composition. It is<br>
also preferred that the high molecular weight/high density fraction has less<br>
than 5, especially less than 4, short branches per 1,000 carbon atoms. It<br>
is further preferred that the high molecular weight/high density fraction has<br>
a weight average molecular weight, Mw.of from 130.000 to 500,000,<br>
especially more than 150,000 to 500.000.<br>
	The "first" fraction of the polymer compositions of this invention<br>
contains at least one homogeneous copolymer. The first fraction may<br>
contain more than one homogenous copolymer but this is not necessary.<br>
	The heterogenrzed/homogenous compositions of this invention are<br>
especially suitable for the preparation or films. It is preferred that films<br>
prepared from a heterogenized/homegenous composition have an overall<br>
density or from 0.900 to 0.940 g/cc (especially from 0.90B to 0.920) and ar|<br>
overall melt index. I2 of from 0.3 to 20.<br><br>

EXAMPLES I<br>
Part 1. Comparative Examples<br>
	A sample of commercially available resin sold under the trademark<br>
EXCEEDâ„¢ f 1019CA by ExxonMobil Chemical was subjected to a gel<br>
permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis to determine molecular<br>
weight distribution and a temperature rising elation fractionation (TREF)1<br>
analysis. Trichlorobenzene was used as the mobile liquid phase for the<br>
TREF analysis. The GPC analysis is described in Part 2 below.<br>
	The EXCEEDâ„¢ 1018CA resin is reported to be an ethylene-hexene<br>
copolymer produced using ExxonMobil Chemicals' EXXPOLâ„¢ technology<br>
(which is believed to be a metallocena catalyst technology).<br>
	The TREF analysis of this resin showed two distinct elution peaks-<br>
The first peak - indicative of a homogeneous copolymer fraction â€”was<br>
observed at 80.7ÂºC. A second fraction having less comonomsr (high<br>
density fraction) was observed to elute at 93.1Â°C.<br>
	GPC analysis of the whole resin showed the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) to be about 101,000 and the molecular weigh!<br>
distribution to be about 2.1.<br>
	according to elution temperature (using a conventional TREF preparation<br>
technique with trichlorobenzene as the moblie liquid phase solvent). The<br>
high density fraction (or cut), which eluted at a temperature of from so to<br>
95Â°C, was observed to be about 8.5 weight % of the total polymer |<br>
composition. This fraction was analyzed to have a weight average I<br>
molecular weight of 72,000. Thus, this sample of EXCEEDâ„¢ 1018CA is<br>
consistent with the disclosure of ths aforesaid Stehling et al. '630 patent<br>
because the 'high density" fraction has a toner molecular weight than the<br>
conolymer fraction (i.e. 72,000 vs. 101,000). One mil films prepared from<br>
EXCEEDâ„¢ 1O1BCA (on a blown film line having a 60 mil die gap, using a<br>
2.5:1 blow up ratio) are reported by ExxonMobil Chemical to have (typical)<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
20<br>
dart impact strength of 740 grams, machine direction (MD) tear strength of<br>
260 gratis, and transverse direction (TD) tear strength of 340 grams.<br>
Comparative Example<br>
	An ethylene-octene copolymer having a density of 0.917 grams per<br>
cubic centimeter (g/cc) and a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of 18-<br>
was prepared in a solution polymerization process using a titanium<br>
catalyst having one cyclopentadienyl ligand, one tri(terllary butyl) <br>
phosphinimine ligand and two chloride ligands (referred to hereinafter as.<br>
CpTiNP(t-Bu)3Cl2) and an activator consisting of a commercially |<br>
available methyl aluminoxane ("MAO") at an A/Ti mole ratio of 100/1 and'<br>
triphenyimethylium tetra kispentafluorophenyl borate ("Ph3CB(C6F5)4") at a<br>
Bm mole ratio of 1.2/1.<br>
	The resulting copolymer did not contain a very high density/higher<br>
melting point fraction In any meaningful amount. ,<br>
	A blown film having an average thickness of 1 mil was prepared<br>
using a conventional extruder al a blow up ratio of 2.5/1 through a 3.5 mil<br>
die gap.<br>
	The resulting film had a dart impact of greater than 1,000 grams, a<br>
machine direction tear strength of 250 grams and a transverse direction<br>
tear strength of 340 grams.<br>
Part2 Inventive Polymerizations <br>
	The examples illustrate the continuous solution copolymerization of<br>
ethylene and octene at medium pressure. The Inventive examples used a<br>
first continuously stirred tank reactor ("CSTR") which operated at a<br>
relatively low temperature (see Table B.1). The first reactor pressure was<br>
about 14.5 Mega Pascals, and the second reactor pressure was<br>
marginally lower (to facilitate flow from the first to second reactor). The<br>
contents from this reactor flowed into a larger, second polymerization<br>
reactor which was also a CSTR. The volume of reactor 2 was 1.8 times<br>
larger than the volume of reactor 1.<br>
	The process was continuous In all "feed streams (i.e. solvent, which<br>
was methyl pentane; monomers and catalyst systems) and in the removal<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
21<br>
of product monomer were purified prior to addition to the reactor using<br>
conventional feed preparation systems (such as contact with various<br>
absorption media to remove impurities such as water, oxygen and polar<br>
contaminates).<br>
	Feeds (monomers, catalysts, activators) were pumped to the<br>
reactors as shown in Table B.1. Average residence times for the reactors<br>
were calculated by dividing average flow rates by reactor volume. The I<br>
residence time in each reactor for all of the inventive experiments was less<br>
than 1.5 minutes and the reactors were well mixed. While not wishing to<br>
be bound by theory, it is believed that the short residence time of the<br>
inventive polymerization reads to small temperature. catalyst and/or<br>
monomer concentration gradients which cause the formation of the high<br>
molecular weight/high density polymer component which is essential to the<br>
compositions of this invention.<br>
	The catalyst used in all experiments was a titanium (IV) complex I<br>
having one cyclopentadienyl ligand, two chloride ligands and one tri |<br>
(tertiary butyl) phosphinimine ligand (-CpTiNP(Bu)3Cl2"). The cocatalysls<br>
were a commercially available methylalumoxane ("MAO") and a<br>
commercially available borate ('Ph3CB(C6F5)4-). A hindered phenol (2,6<br>
di-tertiary butyl, 4-ethyl, phenol) was also used as shown in Table B.1.<br>
	The amount of catalyst added to each reactor(expressed as parts<br>
per million (ppm) by weight, based on the total mass of the reactor<br>
contents) as shown in Table B1. The MAO. borate and phenol were<br>
added in the amounts shown in Table B.I. The amount of MAO<br>
(expressed as moles of Al per mole of Ti (in the catalyst)), berate<br>
(expressed as moles of 8 per mol of Ti) and moles of phenol (expressed<br>
as moles of OH per mole of Al in the MAO) is shown in Table 8.1 where<br>
"R1" refers to reactor 1 and "R2" refers to reactor 2.<br>
	The ethylene concentration in reactor 1 ( R1") is expressed as<br>
weight %. An equivalent flow of ethylene was provided to each reactor.<br>
The total amount of octene used in both reactors is reported in â– <br>

22<br>
fraction of the oclene added to R1 is shown in Table B.1 (with the<br>
remaining octene being added to the second reactor *R2"), I<br>
	Hydrogen was added to the reactors in small amounts as shown in<br>
Table B.1 (expressed as ppm by weight).<br>
	(For clarification: Table B.1 shows that the first composition, was<br>
prepared using the following average conditions in reactor 1 (R1"); I<br>
catalyst concentration of 0.099 ppm;boron/Ti=1.1 (mol/mol): AUi-65A<br>
(mol/mol); OHAI=0.3 (mol/mol); ethylene concentration=9.2 weight %:<br>
80% of the total octene added toR1 and R2 was added to R1; the total<br>
oetenefethylene mole ratio was D.B5; the hydrogen concentration was 0.23<br>
ppm by weight in R1; the mean R1 reactor temperature was 139.8Â°C and<br>
the residence time was 1.0 minutes).<br>
	The composition of the monomer feeds and the position of the<br>
monomer feed port(s) relative to the catalyst feed port in the second<br>
reactor R2 was varied to examine the effect of these variables upon the<br>
microstructure of the heterogenized homogeneous compositions of this<br>
invention.<br>
	The feed ports to reactor 1 were not adjusted for any of the<br>
experiment .One feed port was used to add ethylene and octene In<br>
solvent and another feed port was used for all of the catalyst components<br>
added to R1.<br>
	The entry port into reactor R2 for the polymer solution from R1 was<br>
not changed for any of the experiments shown inTable B.1 â€” it was<br>
located on one side of the reactor about midpoint between the top and<br>
bottom. The first product (entry 1 in Table B.1) was prepared by feeding<br>
the fresh monomer and catalyst at the bottom of the reactor R2 through<br>
separate feed lines.<br>
	Product 2 was prepared by moving the fresh monomer feed to the<br>
side of reactor.<br>
	Product 3 to 6 were prepared using "split fresh monomer feed"i:e.<br>
through two nozztes on theside of the reactor. Cocatalyst flows and<br><br>

	TREF and GPC analysis of Products 1,4 and 6 was then<br>
completed. Product 1 was expected to be most "heterogenized" (due to<br>
the previously discussed locations of the fresh monomer feed and catalyst<br>
ports).<br>
	Product 1 had an Mw of 93,300; an Mn of 24,000; and an average<br>
of 15 short chain branches per 1,000 carbon atoms. 91.5 weight % of the<br>
composition eluted at the lower temperatures expected for homogeneous<br>
copolymers. However, 8.5 weight % of Product 1 eluted over a higher)<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
24<br>
temperature range of from 88 to 110Â°C. This fraction had an Mw of<br>
130,400 and only 3.9 branches per 1,000 carbon atoms -thus, it was<br>
higher molecular weight and lower comanomer content (higher density)<br>
than the remainder of the composition. These data are shown in Table<br>
B.2, together with analogous date for Product 4 and 6 (from the<br>
polymerization examples). In Table B.2, *SCB refers to the number of<br>
short chain branches per 1000 carbon atoms. A low SCB figure indicates<br>
a low amount of comonomer.<br>
	The term "heterogenized fraction" in Table B.2 refers to the high<br>
molecular weight, high density component which elutes at a temperature<br>
of the total heterogeneous/homogeneous composition. For clarity, the<br>
data in Table B.2 show that Product 1 contained 8.5 weight % of the high<br>
density/high molecular weight, low comonomer content material and<br>
Product 6 contained 5.9 weight %. '<br>
Part 3. Film Preparation<br>
	Films were prepared from compositions 1 to 6 which ware prepared<br>
in the polymerizations observed above. A comparative film was also made<br>
using the previously described commercially available EXCEEDâ„¢ 1018 I<br>
product The films were manufactured on a conventional blown film line<br>
which was fed by a single screw extruder having a 3.5 inch screw<br>
diameter. The extruder was driven by an electrical motor. Conventional<br>
additives (antioxldants and process aid) were added to all extrusions. The<br>
extrudate was forced through a circular die having a four inch diameter<br>
and a 35 mil die gap. A blow up ratio (BUR) of 25:1 was used to prepaid<br>
the film. Other processing conditions (output, head pressure and motor |<br>
toad) are shown in Table C.1. Referring to Table C1.it can be seen that I<br>
the electrical power demand required to drive the extruder is expressed as<br>
a current load on the motor (expressed in amps) to produce a given film<br>
output (expressed in pounds of film per hour). The electrical demand for<br>
the product from experiment 1-C was 54 amps for a 100 Ibs/hr throughput<br>
(in comparison to 36-39amps for the inventive composition). Thus, the<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
25<br>
comparative LLDPE of experiment 1-C has poor "processability" (as<br>
indicated by load or the electrical motor).<br>
	Physical properties of the films are shown inTableC.1!. The<br>
"hexane extractables" content of all films is very low. This is a very<br>
desirable feature of films mads from a homogeneous catalyst system.<br>
	The comparative film 1-C had a very high dart impact strength but<br>
tear properties. [Note that the "dart" impact strength of 1,226 g is<br>
significantly higher than the typical" value of 740 reported by the resin<br>
manufacturer â€” as discussed in Part 1 above. However, the MD and TD<br>
tear strength numbers shown in Table C.1 (255 g and 337 g) correspond<br>
very closeiy to the -typical- values (MD=260 g, TD=340 g) reported by the<br>
manufacturer of the EXCEEDâ„¢ 1018 resin.] All of the inventive<br>
compositions 2 to 6 have significantly improved tear strengths. Moreover,<br>
the films made from heterogeneous/homogeneous- resins 4 to 6 also<br>
exhibit very good impact strength, |<br>
	It will also be noted that the "haze" values of all of the films I<br>
prepared on this machine were not very impressive. Additional<br>
experimentation showed that the haze values could be greatly improved<br>
by blending some high pressure low density ("LD") resin or conventional<br>
(heterogeneous) linear low density resin with the inventive resins. Blends<br>
of up to 40 weight % of the LD or heterogeneous LLDPE resins may be<br>
used to improve haze results and amounts as low as 0.25 to 3.00 weight<br>
	For example, three blends of a high pressure, low density<br>
polyethylene "LD" (having a density of 0.921 g/cc and a melt index,|l2, of;<br>
The three blends contained 2 weight %, 3 weight % and 4 weight %<br>
(respectively) of the LD with the balance to 100 weight % being Product 4.<br>
These films had haze values of 5%. 6% and 5%, respectively. Three j<br>
further â– blended" films were then prepared on a larger blown film machine<br>
(having a screw extruder diameterof 3.5 inches) and tested for haze.<br>
These blends were made with Product 5 and contained only 1 weight %,<br><br>
WO 2004/041927 	PCT/CA2003/001585<br>
26<br>
0.75 weight% and 0,5 weight % of the above described LD. The haze<br>
values for these films were 3%, 4% and 4%, respectively.<br>
	Additional films were prepared at different film gauges (from 0.5 to<br>
2.5 mils) using different blow up ratios (from 2 to 3). These data are not<br>
included, but the tear strengths of all films were observed to be excellent.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
	The novel compositions of this invention are suitable for the &gt;<br>
preparation of a wide variety of plastic goods, especially film.<br>
