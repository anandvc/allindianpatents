				<td>IMPROVED POLYMERIC FLUID FLOW FITTING AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an improvement in polymeric fluid flow fittings, particularly and not exclusively to domestic polymeric,water fittings. This invention further relates to method of manufacture of such fittings.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A conventional polymeric fluid flow fitting is shown in Figure 1 in which the fluid flows from the inlet passage (8), through outlet passage (10) and out through discharge passage (11). In order to achieve this fluid pathway, the following method of manufacture is adopted. This method includes forming inlet passage (8), outlet passage (10) and discharge passage (11) in a body by placing a bottom core to form said inlet passage (8), placing another core that is inclined to bottom core to form said outlet passage (10) and opening (7) through which the core is removed, and lastly placing a core declining from outlet passage (10) to define discharge passage (11).<br>
Once the cores are removed, the opening (7) has to be plugged to define a fluid passageway in the body in which the fluid flows from inlet passage (8), through said outlet passage (10) and out through said discharge passage (11). A chamber (6) is formed by another permanent core introduced from the top and this chamber is threaded on the inside to receive a conventional fluid control means. A covering means is used to cover the top portion of the body because the body formed by this method has an unappealing top portion due to the structural requirements for moulding.<br>
There are many disadvantages to this method of manufacture. Firstly, in this method, the opening (7) has to be formed to remove the core and to achieve the intended fluid flow pathway, this opening (7) has to be plugged for fluid flow. Hence there is a need to manufacture ah additional part; i.e. the plug. Additional effort is also needed to carefully secure the plug so that there is no leakage. Secondly, this method limits the shape of the fluid flow fitting. A swan neck fluid flow fitting cannot be manufactured through this method due to the constraints of the removal of the core that defines the outlet passage (10). Thirdly, to hide the unappealing top portion, a covering means is used. This is also an additional part to manufacture and additional effort is required to place the covering means on top of the fluid flow fitting and by using a covering means, the shape of the fluid flow fitting is limited.    Fourthly, to<br>
assemble or to install this polymeric fluid flow fitting, a number of steps are required which this includes utilising a nut (30) and washer (31) to tighten the fluid flow fitting into a suitable hole in another body, said covering means is secured to hide the unappealing top portion of the fluid flow fitting, and lastly a fluid control means is screwed into the chamber (6). The assembly can be cumbersome during installation due to the number of steps and components involved. Also, as the covering means or the fluid control means is a separate component from the fluid flow fitting, they can be easily misplaced, and the assembly or installation cannot be complete. Also, insecure plugging of the opening (7) may lead to a leakage.<br>
It is therefore an objective of this invention to manufacture a fluid flow fitting through a method that does not require separate opening for the removal of the core that defines the outlet passage.<br>
It is a further objective of this invention to manufacture a fluid flow fitting that does not require plugging of an opening.<br>
It also an objective of this invention to manufacture a fluid flow fitting which does not require a covering means which may require mechanical assembly.<br>
It is a further objective of this invention to manufacture a fluid flow fitting which may not require a separate fluid control means.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

A fluid passage is defined in said outer body by allowing fluid to flow from said inlet passage, through said chamber, through said inner inlet, through said outlet passage encased in said outlet portion, through discharge passage encased in said discharge portion and out through said inner outlet encased in outer outlet.<br>
A third embodiment of the current invention also consists of an inner body and an outer body wherein said inner body also comprises of an outlet passage having an inner inlet at one end, a discharge passage connected at the other end of said outlet passage, a pointing downwardly inner outlet on the other end of said discharge passage opposite to said outlet passage and further comprises of an internally threaded ring on the upper portion of the inner body; and said outer body is moulded over said inner body to define an outlet portion and a discharge portion, said outlet portion being connected at one end to said discharge portion and said outlet portion is connected at the other end to a chamber, said chamber having a fluid control means being held in place in said chamber by a bonnet, said chamber is also connected to one end of an inlet passage. A fluid passage is defined in said outer body by allowing fluid to flow from said inlet passage, through said chamber, through said inner inlet, through said outlet passage encased in said outlet portion, through discharge passage encased in said discharge portion and out through said inner outlet encased in outer outlet.<br>
A chamber enclosing the fluid control means can also be manufactured with the fluid flow fitting. Hence, a third embodiment of the current invention consists of an inner body and an outer body, both moulded in polymeric material, wherein said inner body comprises an outlet passage having an inner inlet at one end, a discharge<br>
passage connected at the other end of said outlet passage and a pointing downwardly inner outlet on the other end of said discharge passage opposite to said.outlet passage; and said outer body is moulded over said inner body to define an outlet portion and a discharge portion, said outlet portion being connected at one end to said discharge portion and said outlet portion is connected at the other end to a chamber, said chamber having a fluid control means being held in place in said chamber by a bonnet, said chamber is also connected to one end of an inlet passage.

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Referring to Figure 3, the improved polymeric fluid flow fitting according to the current invention typically comprises of an inner body (1) consisting of an outlet passage (14), an inner inlet (11) at one end of said outlet passage (14), a bent discharge passage (16) at the other end of said outlet passage (14), a pointing downwardly inner outlet (17) [see Figures 4 and 5] on the other end of said discharge<br>
passage (16)  opposite to said outlet passage (14).    Inner body (1)  is made by polymeric moulding and its method of manufacture is herein described.<br>
A straight core and a bent core are used to form the outlet passage (14) and discharge passage (16) of inner body (1) respectively, said discharge passage (16) preferably pointing downwardly. Outlet passage (14) and discharge passage (16) is integrally formed by polymeric moulding over said straight core and bent core, said straight core being extracted through said inner inlet (11) and bent core extracted through inner outlet (17).<br>
The inner body (1) is used as the core to form several embodiments of the improved polymeric fluid flow fitting of the current invention. Embodiments of the improved fluid flow fitting of the current invention typically comprises of an outer body (2) which comprises of an outlet portion (24), a discharge portion (26) connected at one end of said outlet portion (24), said discharge portion (26) preferably pointing downwardly, and an outer outlet (27) on the other end of said discharge portion (26) [refer to Figures 4 and 5], The different types of embodiments and its method of manufacture are herein described in detail.<br>
The first embodiment of this fluid flow fitting is the simplest embodiment and is not shown in any of the drawings. Said outer body, has a straight inlet passage connected at the free end of said outlet portion. A straight core and said inner body is used to form the straight inlet passage integrally with outer body. Before said inner body is used to form said outer body, a first insert is placed in the inner inlet of said inner body and a second insert is placed in said inner outlet of said inner body. Once the polymeric moulding over the straight core and inner body is complete, the straight core is then extracted through first opening to define said inlet passage. The first insert in the inner inlet is then extracted through first opening and the second insert in inner outlet is removed through outer outlet. Hence, a fluid pathway of a fluid flow fitting of the first embodiment according to the current invention is defined by allowing fluid to flow from said inlet passage, through inner inlet, through outlet passage encased in said outlet portion, through discharge passage encased in discharge portion and out through inner outlet encased in outer outlet. The fluid control means for controlling flow of fluid in this instance can be separately located.<br>
For the second embodiment of the fluid flow fitting according to the current invention [refer to Figures 4 and 5], said outer body (2) comprises an outlet portion (24), a discharge portion (26) connected at one end of said outlet portion (24), an<br>
outer outlet (27) on said discharge portion (26), a chamber (3) connected at the other end of said outlet portion (24) and an inlet passage (22) connected to said chamber (3), said chamber (3) being adapted to receive fluid control means (4) for controlling flow of fluid between inlet passage (22) and said outlet passage (14) encased in outlet portion (24).<br>
Expanding on the second embodiment a fluid control means (4) is intended to be being held in place in said chamber (3) by a bonnet (5), said fluid control means (4) controls flow of fluid between said inlet passage (22) and said outlet passage (14). A handle (6) is attached on the uppermost top portion of fluid control means (4) as held in place by the bonnet (5) to engage and disengage said fluid control means (4).<br>
The outlet passage (14) encased in the outlet portion (24) for embodiment two can be inclined relative to the inlet passage (22). A method of manufacturing the second embodiment of the improved polymeric fluid flow fitting of the current invention is herein described.<br>
Similarly with the first embodiment of the current invention, inner body (1) is used to form the outlet portion (24) and discharge portion (26) of outer body (2) by polymeric moulding over inner body (1). Prior to the moulding, a first insert is placed in said inner inlet (11) of said inner body (1) and a second insert is placed in said inner outlet (17) of said inner body (1). A single piece core comprising of a motorised portion to define the chamber (3) and a straight portion connected at the lower end of the motorised portion to define the inlet passage (22) is used in conjunction with said inner body (1) to form said chamber (3) and inlet passage (22) integrally with inner body (2), said motorised portion having a larger diameter than said straight portion. The inner body (1) is simultaneously moulded with this single piece core to form the outer body (2) integrally with chamber (3) and inlet passage (22). The single piece core is extracted through second opening (23) to form said chamber (3) and inlet passage (22). The first insert is extracted through any adjacent opening. The second insert is extracted through outer outlet (27). Alternatively, two separate cores; one being a motorised core to define chamber (3) and the other being a straight core to define inlet passage (22), said motorised core having larger diameter than said straight core, is used in conjunction with inner body (1) to form said chamber (3) and inlet passage (22) integrally with inner body (2). The inner body (1) is simultaneously moulded with these two cores to form outer body (2) integrally with chamber (3) and inlet passage (22). The motorised core is extracted through the second opening (23) to form said chamber (3) and the straight core can be extracted through the second<br>
opening (23) or first opening (21) to define the inlet passage (22). Similarly, the first insert is extracted through any adjacent opening and the second insert is extracted through outer outlet (27).<br>
A method of manufacturing the third and preferred embodiment of the current invention is herein described. Referring to Figure 6, the inner body (1) of this preferred embodiment further includes an internally threaded ring (12) on the upper portion of the inner body (1). The internally threaded ring (12) is formed integrally with inner body (1) by placing a motorised core above the straight core used to form the outlet passage (14) and is polymerically moulded to form inner body (1) with an internal threaded ring (12). The bent core is removed through inner outlet (17) and straight core is removed through inner inlet (11). The motorized core is removed through the ring outlet (13), exposing the threads on the internal surface of the ring (12). Prior to moulding inner body (1) integrated with ring (12) to form outer body (2), the inner inlet (11) is plugged with a first insert and inner outlet (17) is plugged with a second insert.<br>
A single piece core comprising two portions, one portion having a larger diameter than the other, preferably having a diameter that is the same as the diameter of the ring outlet (13) so that the core is slidable within the ring outlet (13), said portion with larger diameter defines chamber (3), and portion with smaller diameter defines inlet passage (22) is used in conjunction with inner body (1) that is integrated with ring (12) to form said chamber (3) and inlet passage (22) integrally with inner body (2). Said single piece core is placed through the ring outlet (13) integrated with inner body (1) and is polymerically moulded to the outer body (2) integrally with chamber (3) and inlet passage (22). The single piece core is extracted through the ring outlet (13) to form chamber (3) and inlet passage (22). The first insert can be extracted through any adjacent opening, and the second insert is extracted through outer outlet (27). Alternatively a two piece core with one piece having a larger diameter than the other is used to form chamber (3) and inlet passage (22) of outer body (2), the diameter of said larger core being the same as that of the ring outlet (13) so that the core is slidable within the ring outlet (13). The larger piece is placed through the ring outlet (13) to form the chamber (3), and the smaller piece is placed underneath the larger piece to form the inlet passage (22) and is polymerically moulded to form chamber (3) and inlet passage (22) integrally with outer body (2). The larger piece core is removed through the ring outlet (13) and the smaller piece is removed through the (21), said first insert extracted through any adjacent opening and second insert extracted through outer outlet (27).   A handle (6) is attachable to the<br>
uppermost top portion of the fluid control means (4) as held in place by the bonnet (5) to engage and disengage said fluid control means (4).<br>
The fluid pathway of a fluid flow fitting of the second and third embodiment produced by any of the methods described is defined by allowing fluid to flow from said inlet passage (22), through chamber (3), through inner inlet (11) through outlet passage (14) encased in said outlet portion (24), through discharge passage (16) encased in said discharge portion (26) and out through said inner outlet (17) encased in outer outlet (27).<br>
