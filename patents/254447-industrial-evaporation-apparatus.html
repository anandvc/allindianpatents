INDUSTRIAL EVAPORATION APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel industrial evaporation apparatus.<br>
35 	More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus in which a liquid<br>
containing a material having a lower boiling point than that of the liquid is made to<br>
flow down along an external surface of a guide that does not themselves have a heat<br>
source, during which time the lower boiling point material is evaporated.<br>
10	Background Art<br>
	It is well-known that various industrial evaporation apparatuses are used to<br>
	remove volatile components and/or low boiling point components by evaporation<br>
	from a liquid and thus concentrating the liquid. For example, Kagaku Kogyo Binran<br>
	("Chemical Engineers' Handbook") 6th Edition (edited by the Society of Chemical<br>
15	 Engineers, Japan, 1999: Non-Patent Document 1) (see pages 403-405) describes<br>
	the following types of industrial evaporation apparatuses: a submerged combustion<br>
	type, a natural circulation immersed tube type, a natural circulation horizontal tube<br>
	type, a vertical short tube type, a vertical long tube climbing film type, a horizontal<br>
	tube falling film type, a vertical long tube falling film type, a forced circulation<br>
20	 horizontal tube type, a forced circulation vertical tube type, coil type, an agitated film<br>
	type, a centrifugal thin film type, a plate type, and a flash evaporation type. Of<br>
	these industrial evaporation apparatuses, for a system in which the liquid is made to<br>
	flow from the top downward, there are the horizontal tube falling film type, the vertical<br>
	long tube falling film type, the forced circulation horizontal tube type, the forced<br>
25	 circulation vertical tube type, and the agitated film type. With the exception of the<br>
	agitated film type, all of these are of the same form as a multi-tube cylindrical heat<br>
l<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	exchanger. For the agitated film type, scrapers are rotated over a cylindrical or<br>
	conical inner surface which is heated through an outer heat source, thus scraping a<br>
	liquid film off from the heat transfer surface as the liquid film is formed thereon,<br>
	whereby the liquid is concentrated through evaporation while making the evaporation<br>
5	 uniform and promoting heat transfer. Moreover, with the horizontal tube falling film<br>
	type or the forced circulation horizontal tube type, which are of the heat exchanger<br>
	type, the liquid is concentrated through evaporation while being made to flow in the<br>
	form of a liquid film over external surfaces of horizontally installed tubes; the tubes<br>
	themselves are heated through a heating medium such as steam flowing<br>
10	 therethrough.<br>
	In terms of the flow of the liquid, the industrial evaporation apparatuses<br>
	closest to the type of the present invention are the vertical long tube falling film type<br>
	and the forced circulation vertical tube type, but these are of a type in which the<br>
	liquid is concentrated through evaporation while descending in the form of a film<br>
15	 through vertically installed tubes, as opposed to the system of the present invention<br>
	in which the liquid is made to flow down along external surfaces of guides, and<br>
	moreover the tubes through which the liquid flows down are themselves heated by a<br>
	heating medium that flows over the outside (trunk portion) of each of the tubes,<br>
	unlike in the present invention in which the guides do not themselves have a heat<br>
20	 source.<br>
	Moreover, strand evaporators in which a melt of a polymer or the like is<br>
	extruded in the form of strands or filaments from a perforated plate into an<br>
	evaporation zone, and the polymer melt is concentrated through evaporation while<br>
	falling down freely are also known (See Patent Document 1: U.S. Patent No.<br>
25	 3110547; Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Publication No. 30-2164). However,<br>
	there are drawbacks with such a strand evaporator, for example, because the liquid<br>
2<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
to be concentrated is allowed to fall down freely, the residence time in the<br>
	evaporation zone is short, and hence the evaporating efficiency is poor, and<br>
	moreover the strands or filaments sway sideways in the evaporation zone and are<br>
	thus liable to fuse to one another, and hence continuous stable operation is difficult.<br>
5 	Apparatuses in which a polyamide, a polyester or the like is produced while making a<br>
	monomer mixture or prepolymer flow down along linear supports have also been<br>
	proposed (See, for example, Patent Document 3: U.S. Patent No. 3044993; Patent<br>
	Document 4: Japanese Patent Publication No. 48-8355, Patent Document 5:<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 53-17569; Patent Document 6:<br>
10 	Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 60-44527; Patent Document 7:<br>
	Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 61-207429). Furthermore, an<br>
	apparatus in which wire loops are installed in an evaporation zone, and a<br>
	high-viscosity polymer melt is concentrated through evaporation or has gas removed<br>
	therefrom while being made to flow down along the wire loops has been proposed,<br>
15	 and it has been stated that such an apparatus can be advantageously used for<br>
	subjecting a polycarbonate solution or melt in particular to concentration through<br>
	evaporation or gas removal (See Patent Document 8: International Publication WO<br>
20	02/051606); this method is substantially the same as a method and apparatus<br>
	already proposed by the present inventors in which a polycarbonate is produced by<br>
20	 polymerizing a molten polymerization starting material while making the molten<br>
	polymerization starting material flow down along wires or perforated sheet-shaped<br>
	guides (See Patent Document 9: International Publication WO 99/36457). However,<br>
	with such an apparatus having the wires or the perforated sheet-shaped guides,<br>
	there have been no specific disclosures or suggestions relating to the scale or use of<br>
25	 an apparatus which can carry out the evaporation operation stably for a prolonged<br>
	period of time on an industrial scale such that not less than 1 ton / hr of the liquid is<br>
3<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
subjected to the evaporation.<br>
Furthermore, with evaporation apparatuses known so far, there has been no<br>
	description of means for avoiding degeneration such as discoloration, gelation,<br>
	crosslinking, production of an ultra-high molecular weight, solidification, scorching or<br>
5 	carbonization due to some of the liquid residing in the apparatus for a prolonged<br>
	period of time. In particular, in the case of an apparatus for evaporating lower<br>
	boiling point material from a liquid having a relatively high viscosity, it has been<br>
	revealed for the first time through carrying out prolonged continuous operation that<br>
	such degeneration occurs, then the degenerated material progressively or suddenly<br>
10	 becomes mixed in the concentrated liquid, bringing about problems of discoloration<br>
	and contamination with solid foreign material, which are fatal for the concentrated<br>
	product such as polymer etc.<br>
However, it is clear that with the evaporation apparatuses known so far, no<br>
	consideration whatsoever has been given to such degeneration upon prolonged<br>
15	operation. For example, according to FIG. 1 in Patent Document 5, which relates to<br>
	an evaporation apparatus that uses linear supports, it is clear that there is much<br>
	so-called "dead space" where the polymer resides for a prolonged period of time and<br>
	is thus heated between a hole portion of a perforated plate and an internal sidewall<br>
	surface of a hollow body, and no means whatsoever has been adopted for reducing<br>
20	 this "dead space". Accordingly, the high-viscosity material fed in from a<br>
	high-viscosity material feeding port (7) resides for a prolonged period of time in the<br>
	"dead space" between the perforated plate (3) and the internal sidewall surface of<br>
	the hollow body, and hence the above problems occur inevitably. Moreover, even in<br>
	recently proposed by Patent Document 8, no means whatsoever has been adopted<br>
25	 for reducing "dead space" in a distributor pipe 3 (FIG. 2), or a feeding zone from<br>
	which feeding is carried out onto a perforated plate (FIG. 3a).<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
	It is an object of the present invention, in the case of an apparatus in which a<br>
	liquid containing material having a lower boiling point than that of the liquid is made<br>
5	 to flow down along an external surface of a guide that does not themselves have a<br>
	heat source, during which time the lower boiling point material is evaporated, to<br>
	provide a specific apparatus that can be operated stably for a prolonged period of<br>
	time on an industrial scale such that not less than 1 ton / hr of the liquid is subjected<br>
	to the evaporation, and furthermore to provide a specific industrial evaporation<br>

Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
15		The industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention is an<br>
	evaporation / concentration apparatus in which a large amount of a liquid can be<br>
	efficiently concentrated through evaporation stably for a prolonged period of time,<br>
	and in which not less than 1 ton / hr of the concentrated liquid can be produced,<br>
	without occurring degeneration of the liquid over a prolonged period of time. In<br>
20	 particular, the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention<br>
	achieves excellent effects in the concentration through evaporation of a liquid having<br>
	a relatively high viscosity. With the apparatuses known so far for concentrating<br>
	such liquids having the relatively high viscosity through evaporation, there have been<br>
	places where some of the liquid resides while being heated for a prolonged period of<br>
25	 time, whereupon this liquid undergoes degeneration such as discoloration, gelation,<br>
	crosslinking, production of an ultra-high molecular weight, solidification, scorching,<br>
9<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	carbonization or the like, and it has been found that the degenerated material mixes<br>
	in the concentrated liquid progressively or suddenly, causing a deterioration in color<br>
	and properties of the concentrated liquid. The industrial evaporation apparatus<br>
	according to the present invention is a continuous evaporation apparatus that does<br>
5	 not suffer from such drawbacks, and in particular achieves excellent effects as a<br>
	polymerization apparatus for a condensation polymer, a purifying apparatus for a<br>
	thermoplastic polymer, or an apparatus for separating and thus recovering the<br>
	polymer from a thermoplastic polymer solution and purifying the polymer. That is,<br>
	the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention is an<br>
10	 apparatus that enables a high-performance and high-purity polymer to be produced<br>
	with high productivity of not less than 1 ton / hr stably for a prolonged period of time<br>
	with no discoloration or contamination with foreign material caused by production of<br>
	thermally degenerated material. Furthermore, in the case that the evaporation<br>
	apparatus according to the present invention is used as a polymerization apparatus,<br>
15	 it can be made to be such that there is very little variation in molecular weight.<br>

	the liquid in the liquid feeding zone 3 can be fed onto a perforated plate 2 as<br>
	uniformly as possible. In the case that there is a liquid receiving port 1 in only one<br>
25	 place, the liquid receiving port 1 is preferably provided in a central portion of the top<br>
	of the liquid feeding zone 3. A flow path controlling member 20 having a function of<br>
11<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	making the liquid fed onto the perforated plate 2 from the liquid receiving port 1 flow<br>
	mainly from a peripheral portion toward a central portion of the perforated plate 2<br>
	must be provided in the liquid feeding zone 3. The flow path controlling member 20<br>
	has an effect of making the liquid flow from the peripheral portion toward the central<br>
5	 portion of the perforated plate 2, thus preventing the liquid from residing for a<br>
	prolonged period of time in a space between holes (e.g. 21) in the perforated plate 2<br>
	and an internal sidewall surface 22 of the liquid feeding zone 3. The liquid made to<br>
	flow mainly from the peripheral portion toward the central portion of the perforated<br>
	plate 2 is thus fed onto guides 4 from the holes arranged between the peripheral<br>
10	 portion and the central portion of the perforated plate 2.<br>
The flow path controlling member 20 may have any shape so long as the<br>
	effects of the flow path controlling member 20 can be achieved, but the outline of a<br>
	cross section of the flow path controlling member 20 is preferably similar figure to the<br>
	outline of a cross section of the perforated plate 2. As used herein, the term" the<br>
15	 cross section of the flow path controlling member 20" refers to a section obtained by<br>
	cutting through the flow path controlling member 20 in a transverse direction at the<br>
	place where this section exhibits the maximum area. A preferable range for the<br>
	spacing between the flow path controlling member 20 and the internal sidewall<br>
	surface 22 of the liquid feeding zone 3 varies according to the amount and viscosity<br>
20	 of the liquid to be processed and so on, but in the case the that the evaporation<br>
	apparatus is used as a polymerization apparatus, a polymer purifying apparatus or<br>
	the like with the liquid to be subjected to the evaporation having a relatively high<br>
	viscosity, a range of from 1 to 50 cm is generally preferable, with from 2 to 30 cm<br>
	being more preferable, and from 3 to 20 cm being yet more preferable. The spacing<br>
25	 between a top internal wall surface 23 of the liquid feeding zone 3 and the flow path<br>
	controlling member 20 may be any spacing, but is preferably made to be such that<br>
12<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
the residence time of the liquid in the liquid feeding zone 3 is as short as possible.<br>
	For this reason, this spacing is generally in a range of from 1 to 200 cm,<br>
	preferably from 2 to 170 cm, more preferably from 3 to 150 cm. The flow path<br>
	controlling member 20 can be made to be such that the spacing between the top<br>
5	 internal wall surface 23 of the liquid feeding zone 3 and the flow path controlling<br>
	member 20 is substantially the same from the liquid receiving port 1 to the internal<br>
	side wall surface 22 of the liquid feeding zone 3, but can also be made to be such<br>
	that this spacing gradually narrows, or conversely gradually widens. Moreover, the<br>
	spacing between the flow path controlling member 20 and the perforated plate 2 is<br>
10	 generally from 1 to 50 cm, preferably from 2 to 30 cm, more preferably from 3 to 20<br>
	cm. The flow path controlling member 20 can be made to be such that the spacing<br>
	between the perforated plate 2 and the flow path controlling member 20 is<br>
	substantially the same from the internal side wall surface 22 of the liquid feeding<br>
	zone 3 to the central portion of the perforated plate 2, or can also be made to be<br>
15	 such that this spacing gradually narrows, or conversely gradually widens, but is<br>
	preferably made to be such that the spacing is substantially the same, or gradually<br>
	narrows.<br>
	The flow path controlling member 20 obstructs the liquid fed in from the liquid<br>
	receiving port 1 from being led directly to the holes in the perforated plate 2, and<br>
20	 hence may also be thought of as being a kind of baffle. Note that in the case that<br>
	the perforated plate 2 has a large area, it is also preferable for some of the liquid fed<br>
	in to be made to take a short cut to the vicinity of the central portion of the perforated<br>
	plate 2 without passing the peripheral portion of the perforated plate 2, in which case<br>
	it is preferable to provide a hole in one place or a plurality of places in the vicinity of a<br>
25	 central portion of the flow path controlling member 20 or another suitable portion for<br>
	this purpose. So that "dead space" is not created in the liquid feeding zone 3, it is<br>
13<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	also preferable for the angle E (°) between the internal sidewall surface 22 of the<br>
	liquid feeding zone 3 and the perforated plate 2 to satisfy the following formula (6):<br>
100 ≤ E
	Here, in the case that the internal sidewall surface 22 is planar, E is an angle<br>
5	 between the internal sidewall surface 22 and the perforated plate 2 in a section taken<br>
	through a plane perpendicular to both the plane of the internal sidewall surface 22<br>
	and an upper surface of the perforated plate 2. Alternatively, in the case that the<br>
	internal sidewall surface 22 is a concave curved surface, E is an angle between the<br>
	upper surface of the perforated plate 2 and a tangent to the internal sidewall surface<br>
10	 22 at the point where the internal sidewall surface 22 starts to rise up in a section<br>
	taken through a plane perpendicular to both the concave surface of the internal<br>
	sidewall surface 22 and the upper surface of the perforated plate 2. Moreover, it is<br>
	also preferable to devise the evaporation apparatus such that the vicinity of the joint<br>
	between the top internal wall surface 23 and the internal sidewall surface 22 of the<br>
15	 liquid feeding zone 3 does not become "dead space". It is preferable to make an<br>
	angle between the top internal wall surface 23 and the internal sidewall surface 22<br>
	be greater than 90°, or 90° or close thereto, since in this case the vicinity of the joint<br>
	is concave and hence liquid does not stagnate here.<br>
	The internal sectional area A (m2) taken through a horizontal plane (plane<br>
20	 a-a1) of a side-wall casing 10 of an evaporation zone 5 must satisfy the following<br>
	formula (1):<br>
0.7≤ A≤ 300	(1).<br>
	Furthermore, a ratio between A (m2) and the internal sectional area B (m2)<br>
	taken through a horizontal plane (plane b-b') of a liquid discharge port 7 must satisfy<br>
25	 the following formula (2):<br>
20≤ A/B≤ 1000	(2).<br>
14<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
A/ B must satisfy the above formula (2) so that the liquid and polymer that<br>
	have been concentrated through evaporation, or the melt whose viscosity has been<br>
	increased without bringing about a reduction in the quality of the concentrated liquid<br>
	can be discharged.<br>
5 			Furthermore, a bottom-wall casing 11 constituting a bottom portion of the<br>
	evaporation zone 5 is connected at an internal angle C (°) to the side-wall casing 10<br>
	thereabove, and the angle C (°) must satisfy the following formula (3):<br>
110≤ C ≤165	(3).<br>
To keep down the equipment cost, C is preferably as close as possible to 90°,<br>
10	 but to move the concentrated liquid falling down from the lower ends of the guides 4,<br>
	and the melt whose viscosity has been increased without bringing about a reduction<br>
	in the quality of the concentrated liquid, to the liquid discharge port 7, C must satisfy<br>
	the above formula (3).<br>
Furthermore, the length h (cm) of each of the guides 4 must satisfy the<br>
15	 following formula (4):<br>
150≤h≤ 5000	(4).<br>
	It is undesirable for h to be shorter than 150 cm, since then the concentration<br>
	or polymerization cannot be carried out sufficiently. It is undesirable for h to be<br>
	longer than 5000 cm, since then the difference in the viscosity of the liquid between<br>
20	 the top and the bottom of each guide 4 becomes too great, thereby resulting in<br>
	tending to be much variation in the concentration degree or polymerization degree.<br>
Furthermore, the total external surface area S (m2) of the guides 4 must<br>
	satisfy the following formula (5):<br>
2≤ S≤ 50000	(5).<br>
25			If S is less than 2 m2, then the desired amount of the liquid subjected to the<br>
	evaporation of not less than 1 ton / hr or the desired production amount of the<br>
15<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
polymer produced cannot be attained. Moreover, to attain such a production<br>
	amount while keeping down the equipment cost, and to eliminate variation in<br>
	properties, S must be made to be not more than 50000 m2.<br>
	It has been discovered that the evaporation apparatus according to the<br>
5	 present invention satisfying the above various conditions not only solves the<br>
	problems of the evaporation apparatuses known so far, but moreover, surprisingly,<br>
	achieves excellent effects as described earlier, it being possible to produce a<br>
	high-quality and high-performance concentrated liquid or polymer with no<br>
	discoloration in an amount of not less than 1 ton / hr stably for a prolonged period of<br>
10	 time of not less than several thousand hours, for example hot less than 5,000 hours.<br>
	It is supposed that the reason why the industrial evaporation apparatus<br>
	according to the present invention exhibits such excellent effects is that, in addition<br>
	to the various reasons described above, a combined effect arises when the above<br>
	conditions are combined. For example, it is supposed that this is because guides 4<br>
15	 having a high surface area satisfying the formulae (4) and (5) are very effective for<br>
	efficient internal stirring and surface renewal of a large amount of liquid or<br>
	prepolymer or polymer fed in at a relatively low temperature, and hence evaporation<br>
	of the lower boiling point material can be carried out efficiently, which is useful for<br>
	obtaining a large amount of not less than 1 ton / hr of high-quality concentrated liquid<br>
20	 or polymer, and moreover the angle C satisfying the formula (3) makes it possible to<br>
	shorten the time taken for the large amount of the high-quality concentrated liquid or<br>
	polymer falling down from the guides 4 to be discharged from the discharge port 7,<br>
	and thus reduce the heat history.<br>
	Note that the performance of the evaporation apparatus on an industrial<br>
25	 scale can only be established through prolonged operation using large-scale<br>
	production equipment, and it goes without saying that the cost of the production<br>
16<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
equipment here is an important factor that must be taken into consideration.<br>
	Another advantageous effect of the present invention is that the equipment<br>
	cost-to-performance ratio for the evaporation apparatus according to the present<br>
	invention can be made lower than with the conventional evaporation apparatuses or<br>
5	 polymerization apparatuses.<br>
	Specified conditions and required ranges for dimensions, angles and so on<br>
	for the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention have been<br>
	described above, but more preferable ranges are as follows: A more preferable<br>
	range for the internal sectional area A (m2) taken through a horizontal plane of the<br>
10	 side-wall casing 10 of the evaporation zone 5 is 0.8≤A≤ 250, with 1 ≤ A ≤<br>
	200 being yet more preferable.<br>
Moreover, a more preferable range for the ratio between A (m2) and the<br>
	internal sectional area B (m2) taken through a horizontal plane of the liquid discharge<br>
	port 7 is 25 ≤A/B ≤900, with 30 ≤ A/B≤ 800 being yet more preferable.<br>
15 	Moreover, a more preferable range for the internal angle C (°) of the bottom-wall<br>
	casing 11 constituting the bottom portion of the evaporation zone 5 to the side-wall<br>
	casing 10 thereabove is 120 ≤ C≤ 165, with 135 ≤ C≤ 165 being yet more<br>
	preferable. Note that in the case of progressively increasing the concentration<br>
	degree or polymerization degree using a plurality of evaporation apparatuses, taking<br>
20	 the angles for the evaporation apparatuses to be C1, C2, C3 ... respectively, it is<br>
	preferable to make C1 ≤ C2 ≤ C3≤ ....<br>
	Moreover, the required length h (cm) of each of the guides 4 varies with<br>
	factors such as the amount, viscosity and temperature of the liquid to be processed,<br>
	the amount and boiling point of lower boiling point material, the pressure and<br>
25	 temperature in the evaporation zone, and the required concentration degree or<br>
	polymerization degree, but a more preferable range is 200 ≤ h ≤3000, with 400 
17<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	h ≤ 2500 being yet more preferable. Moreover, the required total external surface<br>
	area S (m2) of the guides 4 also varies with factors such as the above, but a more<br>
	preferable range is 10 ≤S ≤ 40000, with 15 ≤ S ≤30000 being yet more<br>
	preferable. The term "total external surface area of the guides" used in the present<br>
5	 invention means the total surface area of the guides with which the liquid contacts<br>
	when flowing down; for example, in the case of a guide such as a pipe, this means<br>
	the surface area of the outside of the pipe, the surface area of the inside surface of<br>
	the pipe over which the liquid does not flow down not being included.<br>
	In the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention,<br>
10	 the shape of the inside section taken through a horizontal plane of the side-wall<br>
	casing 10 of the evaporation zone 5 may be any shape, for example polygonal,<br>
	elliptical or circular. Operation is generally carried out with the evaporation zone 5<br>
	under a reduced pressure, and hence any shape is acceptable so long as this<br>
	reduced pressure can be withstood, but a circular shape or a shape close thereto is<br>
15	 preferable. The side-wall casing 10 of the evaporation zone 5 is thus preferably<br>
	cylindrical. In this case, it is preferable for a conical bottom-wall casing to be<br>
	provided at the bottom of the cylindrical side-wall casing 10, with a cylindrical liquid<br>
	discharge port 7 being provided in the lowermost portion of the bottom-wall cashing.<br>
	In the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention, in<br>
20	 the case that each of the side-wall and bottom-wall casings of the evaporation zone<br>
5	 comprises a cylindrical portion and a conical portion as described above, and the<br>
	liquid discharge port 7 for the concentrated liquid or polymer is cylindrical, taking the<br>
	cylindrical portion of the side-wall casing to have an inside diameter D (cm) and a<br>
	length L (cm), and taking the liquid discharge port 7 to have an inside diameter d<br>
25	 (cm), D, L and d preferably satisfy the following formulae (7), (8), (9) and (10):<br>
100 ≤D ≤ 1800	(7)<br>
18<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
5 ≤ D/d ≤ 50	(8)<br>
0.5 ≤L/D ≤ 30	(9)<br>
h-20≤ L ≤ h + 300	(10).<br>
	For the evaporation apparatus according to the present invention, a more<br>
5	 preferable range for D (cm) is 150 ≤ D ≤ 1500, with 200≤ D ≤ 1200 being yet<br>
	more preferable. Moreover, a more preferable range for D / d is 6 ≤ D/d ≤ 45,<br>
	with 7 ≤ D / d≤ 40 being yet more preferable. Moreover, a more preferable<br>
	range for L / D is 0.6 ≤ L / D ≤ 25, with 0.7 ≤ L / D ≤ 20 being yet more<br>
	preferable. Moreover, a more preferable range for L (cm) is h -10≤ L ≤ h +<br>
10	 250, with h ≤ L≤h + 200 being yet more preferable. If D, d and L do not<br>
	simultaneously satisfy all of the above relationships, then it becomes difficult to attain<br>
	the object of the present invention.<br>
	The precise reason why the evaporation apparatus according to present<br>
	invention enables production of a high-quality and high-performance concentrated<br>
15	 liquid or polymer having excellent mechanical properties with no discoloration stably<br>
	(in the case of producing a polymer, with very little variation in molecular weight etc.)<br>
	for a prolonged period of time on an industrial scale with a fast evaporation rate or<br>
	polymerization rate is not clear, but is thought to be as follows: That is, according to<br>
	the evaporation apparatus of the present invention, the starting material liquid is led<br>
20	 from the liquid receiving port 1 via the liquid feeding zone 3 and the perforated plate<br>
	2 to the guides 4, and is then concentrated, or has the polymerization degree thereof<br>
	increased, while flowing down along the guides 4. Effective internal stirring and<br>
	surface renewal of the liquid or molten prepolymer occur naturally as the liquid or<br>
	molten prepolymer flows down along the guides, and thus removal of lower boiling<br>
25	 point material is carried out effectively, whereby the concentration or polymerization<br>
proceeds at a fast rate. The viscosity increases as the concentration or<br>
19<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	polymerization proceeds, and hence the adhesion force of the liquid or melt to the<br>
	guides 4 increases, and thus the amount of the liquid or melt adhered to each guide<br>
	increases toward the bottom of the guide. This means that the residence time of<br>
	the liquid or molten prepolymer on the guide, i.e. the evaporation time or<br>
5	 polymerization reaction time, increases. Moreover, for the liquid or molten<br>
	prepolymer, which flows down under its own weight while being supported on the<br>
	guide, the surface area per unit weight is very high, and hence surface renewal is<br>
	carried out efficiently. Concentration through evaporation, or increase of molecular<br>
	weight in the latter half of polymerization, can thus be attained in a high viscosity<br>
10	 region easily, whereas this has been impossible with the conventional evaporation<br>
	apparatuses or mechanical agitation type polymerization apparatuses. This is one<br>
	of the excellent characteristic features of the evaporation apparatus according to the<br>
	present invention.<br>
The only reason that the amount of the liquid or melt adhered to the guides<br>
15	 increases in the latter half of the polymerization or the evaporation is because of the<br>
	increasing of the adhesive holding force, which corresponds to the increasing of<br>
	viscosity, and hence approximately the same amount of the liquid or melt having<br>
	approximately the same viscosity is supported at the same height on each of the<br>
	plurality of guides. On the other hand, the liquid or melt is continuously fed onto the<br>
20	 guides from the top thereof, and hence liquid having approximately the same<br>
	viscosity, or melt of increased polymerization degree having approximately the same<br>
	melt viscosity, continuously falls down into the bottom portion of the casing from the<br>
	lower ends of the guides. That is, liquid of approximately the same viscosity, or<br>
	polymer of approximately the same polymerization degree, produced while flowing<br>
25	 down the guides collects in the bottom portion of the bottom-wall casing 11, and<br>
	hence a concentrated liquid with very little variation in evaporation degree, or a<br>
20<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	polymer with very little variation in molecular weight, is continuously produced. This<br>
	is another one of the excellent characteristic features of the evaporation apparatus<br>
	according to the present invention. The concentrated liquid or polymer collected in<br>
	the bottom portion of the bottom-wall casing is continuously withdrawn through the<br>
5	 liquid discharge port 7 by a discharging pump 8, and in the case of a polymer, is<br>
	continuously pelletized via an ordinary extruder or the like. In this case, additives<br>
	and so on may be added in the extruder.<br>
The perforated plate 2 in the evaporation apparatus according to the present<br>
	invention is generally selected from flat plates, corrugated plates, and plates that are<br>
10	 thickened in a central portion thereof; the shape of the cross section of the<br>
	perforated plate 2 is generally selected from shapes such as circular, oval, triangular,<br>
	and polygonal. The shape of the cross section of each of the holes in the<br>
	perforated plate is generally selected from shapes such as circular, oval, triangular,<br>
	slit-shaped, polygonal, and star-shaped. The sectional area of the holes is<br>
15	 generally in a range of from 0.01 to 100 cm2, preferably from 0.05 to 10 cm2,<br>
	particularly preferably from 0.1 to 5 cm2. The spacing between holes, specifically<br>
	the distance between hole centers, is generally from 1 to 500 mm, preferably from 25<br>
	to 100 mm. The holes in the perforated plate may be holes that penetrate through<br>
	the perforated plate, or alternatively pipes may be provided in the perforated plate.<br>
20 	Moreover, the holes may be tapered.<br>
	The guides in the evaporation apparatus according to the present invention<br>
	do not themselves have a heat source such as a heating medium or an electrical<br>
	heater therein, and each of the guides is a member for which a ratio of the length in<br>
	a direction perpendicular to a horizontal section relative to the average length of the<br>
25	 outer periphery of such a horizontal section is very high. This ratio is generally in a<br>
	range of from 10 to 1,000,000, preferably from 50 to 100,000. The shape of the<br>
21<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	horizontal section is generally selected from shapes such as circular, oval, triangular,<br>
	square, polygonal, and star-shaped. The shape of this section may be constant, or<br>
	may vary, in the length direction. Moreover, each of the guides may be hollow. A<br>
	significantly characteristic feature of the present invention is that because the guides<br>
5 	do not themselves have a heat source, there is absolutely no risk of thermal<br>
	degeneration of the liquid on the surface of the guides.<br>
	Each of the guides may be a single wire, a single thin rod, a single thin pipe<br>
	made to be such that the liquid or the molten prepolymer cannot enter thereinto, or<br>
	the like, or a plurality of such guides may be combined using a method such as<br>
10	 twisting together. Moreover, the guides may form a mesh-like structure, or a<br>
	punching plate-like structure. The surface of each guide may be smooth, or may be<br>
	uneven, and may have projections or the like in places. Preferable guides are<br>
	cylindrical ones such as wires or thin rods, thin pipes as described above, mesh-like<br>
	guide structures, and punching plate-like guide structures.<br>
15		In the guide-contacting downflow type evaporation apparatus according to<br>
	the present invention, which enables production of a high-quality concentrated liquid<br>
	or polymer on an industrial scale (in terms of production amount, prolonged stable<br>
	production, etc.), a particularly preferable guide structure is one of a type in which a<br>
	plurality of guides each having the form of a wire or a thin rod or a thin pipe as<br>
20	 described above are joined together at suitable vertical intervals using transverse<br>
	supports from the top to the bottom of the guides. Examples are mesh-like guide<br>
	structures in which a plurality of guides each having the form of a wire or a thin rod or<br>
	a thin pipe as described above are fixed together using transverse supports from the<br>
	top to the bottom of the guides at suitable vertical intervals, for example intervals of<br>
25	 from 1 to 200 cm, a three-dimensional guide structure in which a plurality of such<br>
	mesh-like guide structures are arranged in front of and behind one another and<br>
22+<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	joined together using transverse supports at suitable vertical intervals, for example<br>
	intervals of from 1 to 200 cm, or a jungle-gym-like three-dimensional guide structure<br>
	in which a plurality of guides each having the form of a wire or a thin rod or a thin<br>
	pipe as described above are fixed together in front of and behind, and left and right<br>
5	 of, one another using transverse supports at suitable vertical intervals, for example<br>
	intervals of from 1 to 200 cm. The transverse supports are not only useful for<br>
	keeping the intervals between the guides approximately constant, but are also useful<br>
	for increasing the overall strength of flat or curved guides, or guides forming a<br>
	three-dimensional structure. The supports may be of the same material as the<br>
10	 guides, or a different material.<br>
In the present invention, in the case that each guide is cylindrical, or has the<br>
	form of a pipe made to be such that the liquid or molten prepolymer cannot enter<br>
	thereinto, with an outside diameter r (cm), r preferably satisfies the formula (12):<br>
0.1 ≤ r ≤ 1	(12).<br>
15	The guides in the present invention promote concentration through<br>
	evaporation or polymerization of the liquid or molten prepolymer as the liquid or<br>
	molten prepolymer flows down the guides, and also have a function of holding the<br>
	liquid or molten prepolymer for a certain period of time. This holding time is related<br>
	to the evaporation time or polymerization reaction time. As described above, as the<br>
20	 evaporation or polymerization proceeds, the viscosity of the liquid or melt<br>
	progressively increases, and hence the holding time and the amount held<br>
	progressively increase. For a given melt viscosity, the amount of the liquid or<br>
	molten prepolymer held by the guides varies with the external surface area of the<br>
	guides, i.e. in the case of cylindrical or pipe-shaped guides, with the outside<br>
25	 diameter.<br>
Moreover, the guides provided in the evaporation apparatus according to the<br>
23<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	present invention must be strong enough to support their own weight plus the weight<br>
	of the liquid or molten prepolymer or polymer being held. For this reason, the<br>
	thickness of the guides is important, and in the case of cylindrical or pipe-shaped<br>
	guides, the formula (12) is preferably satisfied. If r is less than 0.1, then prolonged<br>
5 	stable operation becomes difficult in terms of the strength, whereas if r is greater<br>
	than 1, then the guides themselves become very heavy, and hence there are<br>
	problems such as having to make the perforated plate very thick so as to hold the<br>
	guides in the evaporation apparatus. Moreover, there is an increase in parts where<br>
	the amount of the liquid or molten prepolymer or polymer held is too high, resulting in<br>
10	 problems such as variation in the concentration degree or the molecular weight<br>
	increasing. For such reasons, a more preferable range for r is 0.15 ≤ r ≤ 0.8,<br>
	with 0.2 ≤r ≤ 0.6 being yet more preferable.<br>
	A preferable material for the guides is one selected from metals such as<br>
	stainless steel, carbon steel, hastelloy, nickel, titanium, chromium, aluminum, and<br>
15	 other alloys, highly heat-resistant polymeric materials, and so on. Stainless steel is<br>
	particularly preferable. Moreover, the surfaces of the guides may be subjected to<br>
	any of various treatments as necessary such as plating, lining, passivation treatment,<br>
	acid washing, or washing with a solvent, phenol or the like.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the positional relationship between the<br>
20	 guides and the perforated plate or the positional relationship between the guides and<br>
	the holes in the perforated plate so long as the liquid or starting material molten<br>
	prepolymer or polymer can contact the guides and flow down the guides. The<br>
	guides and the perforated plate may be in contact with one another, or not in contact<br>
	with one another. Although there is no such limitation, it is preferable to provide the<br>
25	 guides in correspondence with the holes in the perforated plate. The reason for this<br>
	is that design may then be carried out such that the liquid or starting material molten<br>
24<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	prepolymer or polymer falling down from the perforated plate contacts the guides in<br>
	suitable positions.<br>
	Specific preferable examples of providing the guides in correspondence with<br>
	the holes in the perforated plate include: (1) a method in which the upper end of<br>
5	 each guide is fixed to the underside of the flow path controlling member or the like,<br>
	and the guides are provided such that each guide penetrates through the vicinity of a<br>
	central portion of a hole in the perforated plate; (2) a method in which the upper end<br>
	of each guide is fixed to a peripheral portion at an upper end of a hole in the<br>
	perforated plate, and the guides are provided such that each guide penetrates<br>
10	 through a hole in the perforated plate; and (3) a method in which the upper end of<br>
	each guide is fixed to the underside of the perforated plate.<br>
	Examples of methods for making the liquid or starting material molten<br>
	prepolymer or polymer pass through the perforated plate and flow down along the<br>
	guides are a method in which the liquid or starting material molten prepolymer or<br>
15	 polymer is allowed to flow down through its own weight or the liquid head, and a<br>
	method in which the liquid or starting material molten prepolymer or polymer has<br>
	pressure applied thereto using a pump or the like and is thus extruded from the<br>
	perforated plate. A preferable method is one in which a prescribed amount of the<br>
	liquid or starting material molten prepolymer or polymer is fed into the liquid feeding<br>
20	 zone of the evaporation apparatus under pressure using a feed pump, and then the<br>
	liquid or starting material molten prepolymer or polymer thus led onto the guides via<br>
	the perforated plate flows down along the guides under its own weight.<br>
The evaporation apparatus according to the present invention is an<br>
	apparatus for evaporating lower boiling point material from a liquid containing this<br>
25	 lower boiling point material, i.e. containing material having a lower boiling point than<br>
	that of the liquid. The liquid may be any liquid. The liquid may be at room<br>
25<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	temperature, but is generally fed into the evaporation apparatus from the liquid<br>
	receiving port in a heated state. Moreover, it is generally preferable for a jacket or<br>
	the like to be provided on an outer wall of the evaporation apparatus. If necessary,<br>
	heating is then carried out by passing steam, a heating medium or the like through<br>
5	 the jacket, thus heating or maintaining the temperature of the liquid feeding zone, the<br>
	flow path controlling member, the perforated plate, or the evaporation zone.<br>
	The evaporation apparatus according to the present invention is not only<br>
	used as an apparatus for concentrating a liquid, but also is particularly preferably<br>
	used as an evaporation apparatus for a liquid having a relatively high viscosity, for<br>
10	 example as a polymerization apparatus for a condensation polymer, a purifying<br>
	apparatus for a thermoplastic polymer containing low boiling point material such as<br>
	monomer, oligomer and by-produced material, or an apparatus for separating and<br>
	thus recovering the polymer from a thermoplastic polymer solution.<br>
	It is thus preferable to use the industrial evaporation apparatus according to<br>
15	 the present invention as a polymerization apparatus for a condensation polymer, in<br>
	the case that the liquid is a melt of a monomer or a mixture of a plurality of<br>
	monomers for producing a condensation polymer, and/or a prepolymer of the<br>
	condensation polymer, and/or the condensation polymer, and the low boiling point<br>
	material comprises a by-produced material and/or an oligomer produced through the<br>
20	 condensation polymerization, for removing the low boiling point material from the<br>
	melt by evaporation so as to increase the polymerization degree of the prepolymer of<br>
	the condensation polymer and/or the condensation polymer. Preferable examples<br>
	of the condensation polymer include polyesters such as aromatic-aliphatic polyesters<br>
	such as polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate and polybutylene<br>
25	 terephthalate, and various copolyesters, polyesters of hydroxycarboxylic acids such<br>
	as glycolic acid and lactic acid, and various copolyesters, aliphatic-aliphatic<br>
26<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	polyesters between an aliphatic diol and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, and various<br>
	copolyesters, and aromatic-aromatic polyesters such as polyarylates and liquid<br>
	crystal polyesters, and various copolyesters; polyamides such as aliphatic<br>
	polyamides such as nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 612 and nylon 12, and various<br>
5	 copolyamides, and aliphatic-aromatic polyamides such as nylon 6T, and various<br>
	copolyamides; polycarbonates such as aliphatic polycarbonates, aromatic<br>
	polycarbonates, and various copolycarbonates; and polyester polycarbonates. By<br>
	using the evaporation apparatus according to the present invention, a high-purity and<br>
	high-performance condensation polymer can be produced stably for a prolonged<br>
10	 period of time with no discoloration or gelated material or solid foreign material, and<br>
	with very little variation in molecular weight.<br>
	Alternatively, it is also preferable to use the industrial evaporation apparatus<br>
	according to the present invention, in the case that the liquid is a melt of a<br>
	thermoplastic polymer A, and the lower boiling point material comprises a monomer,<br>
15	 an oligomer, a by-produced material and so on contained in the polymer, as a<br>
	purifying apparatus for removing the lower boiling point material from the melt by<br>
	evaporation so as to increase the purity of the polymer. Preferable examples of the<br>
	thermoplastic polymer A include polystyrene-based polymers such as polystyrene,<br>
	high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and various copolymers; polyvinyl chloride-based<br>
20	 polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, and various copolymers; polyvinylidene<br>
	chloride-based polymers such as polyvinylidene chloride, and various copolymers;<br>
	acrylonitrile-based polymers such as AS resins, ABS resins, and various copolymers;<br>
	polyolefins such as polypropylene; polyacrylic ester-based polymers; polymethacrylic<br>
	ester-based polymers such as PMMA, and various copolymers; and thermoplastic<br>
25	 elastomers. According to the evaporation apparatus of the present invention,<br>
	impurities such as residual monomers contained in the thermoplastic polymer A can<br>
27<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	be removed efficiently at a relatively low temperature, and hence a high-purity and<br>
	high-performance thermoplastic polymer A can be obtained with no thermal<br>
	decomposition and no discoloration.<br>
	Alternatively, it is also preferable to use the industrial evaporation apparatus<br>
5	 according to the present invention, in the case that the liquid is a solution of a<br>
	thermoplastic polymer B, and the lower boiling point material comprises a solvent in<br>
	which the thermoplastic polymer is dissolved and/or a monomer, an oligomer, a<br>
	by-produced material and so on contained in the polymer solution, as a separation<br>
	recovery / purification apparatus for removing the lower boiling point material from<br>
10	 the solution by evaporation so as to separate and thus recover the thermoplastic<br>
	polymer from the solution and increase the purity of the thermoplastic polymer. A<br>
	preferable example of the solution of the thermoplastic polymer B is a solution of a<br>
	polymer such as SBR, BR or EPDM produced through solution polymerization using<br>
	a solution of an aromatic polycarbonate in a chlorinated solvent (e.g. methylene<br>
15	 chloride, chlorobenzene), a solvent (e.g. toluene, hexane), etc. Moreover, it is also<br>
	preferable to remove the solvent and so on from an aromatic polycarbonate melt<br>
	remaining a chlorinated solvent or an elastomer remaining a polymerization solvent.<br>
	According to the evaporation apparatus of the present invention, the solvent and<br>
	impurities can be removed efficiently at a relatively low temperature, and hence a<br>
20	 high-purity and high-performance thermoplastic polymer B can be obtained with no<br>
	thermal decomposition and no discoloration.<br>
	The industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention is<br>
	particularly suitable for removing lower boiling point material by evaporation from a<br>
	liquid having a relatively high viscosity. For example, it is particularly suitable for the<br>
25	 case of using the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention<br>
	as a polymerization apparatus for a condensation polymer. In the case of using the<br>
28<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	conventional polymerization apparatuses, there have been places where some of the<br>
	liquid resides while being heated for a prolonged period of time, whereupon this<br>
	liquid undergoes degeneration such as discoloration, gelation, crosslinking,<br>
	production of an ultra-high molecular weight polymer, solidification, scorching,<br>
5	 carbonization or the like, and hence it is has been impossible to avoid the drawback<br>
	of degenerated material mixing in the polymer progressively or suddenly. However,<br>
	according to the industrial evaporation apparatus of the present invention, there are<br>
	no such drawbacks, and moreover the industrial evaporation apparatus according to<br>
	the present invention exhibits excellent effects not exhibited by the conventional<br>
10	 polymerization apparatuses.<br>
	In other words, in the case, for example, of producing an aromatic<br>
	polycarbonate by polymerizing a molten prepolymer obtained from an aromatic<br>
	dihydroxy compound and a diaryl carbonate, the reaction temperature must generally<br>
	be in a range of from 200 to 350°C, and the viscosity increases dramatically in the<br>
15	 latter half of the polymerization in particular. An aromatic monohydroxy compound<br>
	produced through an equilibrium reaction must be withdrawn from the<br>
	ultra-high-viscosity material, and hence with the conventional polymerization<br>
	apparatuses, for example even if a horizontal twin-shaft agitation type<br>
	ultra-high-viscosity polymer reactor has been used, it has been necessary to carry<br>
20	 out the reaction for a prolonged period of time at a high temperature of not less than<br>
30	0°C and under a high vacuum with a pressure of not more than 133 Pa, and<br>
	moreover production of a high molecular weight material for sheets or the like has<br>
	been difficult.<br>
	However, according to the polymerization apparatus of the present invention,<br>
25	 efficient surface renewal occurs naturally accompanying internal stirring, and hence<br>
	the polymerization reaction can be carried out at a relatively low temperature. A<br>
29<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	preferable reaction temperature is thus from 100 to 290°C, more preferably from 150<br>
	to 270°C. It is a characteristic feature of the polymerization apparatus according to<br>
	the present invention that polymerization can be carried out adequately at a lower<br>
	temperature than in the case of the conventional mechanically agitated<br>
5	 polymerization apparatus, and this is also one reason why a high-quality aromatic<br>
	polycarbonate can be produced with no discoloration or deterioration in properties.<br>
	Furthermore, with the conventional polymerization apparatuses, there have been<br>
	drawbacks such as contamination with foreign materials, and leaking in of air or the<br>
	like through an agitator seal under a high vacuum. However, according to the<br>
10	 polymerization apparatus of the present invention, because there is no mechanical<br>
	agitation, there is no agitator seal, and hence there is very little leaking in of air or the<br>
	like or contamination with foreign materials, which is another reason why a<br>
	high-purity and high-performance aromatic polycarbonate can be produced. Such<br>
	excellent effects are also achieved with other condensation polymers, in particular<br>
15	 polyesters and polyamides. These excellent effects are particularly marked in the<br>
	case of producing polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate,<br>
	polybutylene terephthalate, nylon 6, or nylon 66.<br>
	In the case of producing a condensation polymer using the industrial<br>
	evaporation apparatus according to the present invention, as the polymerization<br>
20	 reaction proceeds, lower boiling point materials by-produced through an equilibrium<br>
	reaction are removed from the reaction system, whereby the reaction rate can be<br>
	increased. A method in which an inert gas that does not have an adverse effect on<br>
	the reaction such as nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide or a lower hydrocarbon<br>
	gas is introduced into the polymerization apparatus, and the lower boiling point<br>
25	 materials are entrained by this gas and thus removed, a method in which the<br>
	reaction is carried out under a reduced pressure, or the like is thus preferably used.<br>
30<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	Alternatively, a method in which these two methods are used together can also be<br>
	preferably used. In such a case, there is no need to introduce a large amount of the<br>
	inert gas into the polymerization apparatus, but rather just enough to maintain an<br>
	inert gas atmosphere inside the apparatus is sufficient.<br>
5	The reaction pressure in the case of producing a condensation polymer<br>
	using the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present invention varies<br>
	depending on the types of lower boiling point material by-produced, the type and<br>
	molecular weight of the polymer to be produced, the polymerization temperature, and<br>
	so on, but in the case, for example, of producing an aromatic polycarbonate from a<br>
10	 molten prepolymer produced from bisphenol A and diphenyl carbonate, in the case of<br>
	a number average molecular weight of not more than 5,000, the reaction pressure is<br>
	preferably in a range of from 400 to 3,000 Pa, and in the case of a number average<br>
	molecular weight of from 5,000 to 10,000, the reaction pressure is preferably in a<br>
	range of from 50 to 500 Pa. In the case of a number average molecular weight<br>
15	 equal to or greater than 10,000, the reaction pressure is preferably not more than<br>
	300 Pa, particularly preferably in a range of from 20 to 250 Pa.<br>
	In the case of producing a condensation polymer using the industrial<br>
	evaporation apparatus according to the present invention as a polymerization<br>
	apparatus, a polymer having the desired polymerization degree can be produced<br>
20	 using only one such evaporation apparatus, but depending on the polymerization<br>
	degree of the monomer melt or molten prepolymer used as the starting material, the<br>
	amount produced of the polymer, and so on, a system in which a plurality of such<br>
	evaporation apparatuses are linked together so that the polymerization degree is<br>
	progressively increased may be preferable. In this case, guides and reaction<br>
25	 conditions suitable for the polymerization degree of the prepolymer or polymer to be<br>
	produced are preferably adopted for each of the evaporation apparatuses individually.<br>
31<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	For example, in the case of a system in which a first guide-contacting downflow type<br>
	polymerization apparatus, a second guide-contacting downflow type polymerization<br>
	apparatus, a third guide-contacting downflow type polymerization apparatus, a fourth<br>
	guide-contacting downflow type polymerization apparatus and so on are used so that<br>
5	 the polymerization degree is progressively increased, taking the total external<br>
	surface areas of the guides possessed by the polymerization apparatuses to be S1,<br>
	S2, S3, S4 ... respectively, the system can be made to be such that S1 ≥ S2≥<br>
	S3 ≤ S4≤ .... Moreover, the polymerization temperature may be the same in<br>
	each of the polymerization apparatuses, or alternatively may be progressively<br>
10	 increased. The polymerization pressure may also be progressively reduced in the<br>
	polymerization apparatuses.<br>
	In this sense, in the case, for example, of progressively increasing the<br>
	polymerization degree using two polymerization apparatuses, i.e. a first<br>
	guide-contacting downflow type polymerization apparatus and a second<br>
15	 guide-contacting downflow type polymerization apparatus, it is preferable to use<br>
	guides such that the total external surface area S1 (m2) of the guides in the first<br>
	polymerization apparatus and the total external surface area S2 (m2) of the guides in<br>
	the second polymerization apparatus satisfy the following formula (13):<br>
1 ≤S1 /S2 ≤ 20	(13).<br>
20	If S1 / S2 is less than 1, then problems arise such as variation in the<br>
	molecular weight increasing so that prolonged stable production becomes difficult,<br>
	and it becoming difficult to obtain a prescribed production amount, whereas if S1 / S2<br>
	is greater than 20, then the flow rate of the molten prepolymer flowing down the<br>
	guides in the second polymerization apparatus becomes high, and as result<br>
25	 problems arise such as the residence time of the molten prepolymer becoming short<br>
	so that it becomes difficult to obtain a polymer of the required molecular weight. For<br>
32<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
such reasons, a more preferable range is 1.5 ≤ S1 / S2 ≤ 15.<br>
	According to the industrial evaporation apparatus or polymerization<br>
	equipment of the present invention, not less than 1 ton / hr of a concentrated liquid or<br>
	polymer can easily be produced. In the case of producing a condensation polymer<br>
5	 from a monomer melt or a molten prepolymer, the polymerization is carried out<br>
	through an ordinary polymerization reaction while discharging by-produced lower<br>
	boiling point materials out of the system, and hence it is necessary for the monomer<br>
	melt or molten prepolymer used as the starting material to be fed into the<br>
	polymerization apparatus or equipment in an amount greater than 1 ton / hr. The<br>
10	 amount of the monomer melt or molten prepolymer constituting the liquid fed into the<br>
	evaporation apparatus thus varies depending on the polymerization degree thereof<br>
	and the polymerization degree of the polymer to be produced, but is generally from<br>
10	 to 500 kg/hr greater than the amount of the polymer produced per 1 ton / hr of the<br>
	polymer produced, i.e. in a range of from 1.01 to 1.5 ton / hr per 1 ton / hr of the<br>
15	 polymer produced. Moreover, in the case of carrying out concentration through<br>
	evaporation or purification through evaporation on a thermoplastic polymer or liquid<br>
	containing lower boiling point material, the amount of the liquid fed in varies<br>
	depending on the lower boiling point material content and the required concentration<br>
	degree or purification degree, but is generally in a range of from 1.001 to 100 ton / hr,<br>
20	 preferably from 1.005 to 50 ton / hr, more preferably from 1.01 to 20 ton / hr.<br>
	So long as the industrial evaporation apparatus according to the present<br>
	invention satisfies the conditions described in the claims, and moreover has a<br>
	correspondingly suitable mechanical strength, the industrial evaporation apparatus<br>
	may be of any type, and may have adjoined thereto equipment having some other<br>
25	 function required for continuous operation. Moreover, according to the industrial<br>
	evaporation apparatus of the present invention, a plurality of such industrial<br>
33<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	evaporation apparatuses may be joined together, and furthermore equipment having<br>
	some function other than evaporation may be adjoined thereto.<br>
Examples<br>
5			Next, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to<br>
	Examples and Reference Examples.<br>
[Example 1]:<br>
	An industrial evaporation apparatus having a disk-shaped flow path<br>
	controlling member 20 of thickness approximately 2 cm and guides 4 as shown in<br>
10	 FIGS. 2 and 3. The disk-shaped flow path controlling member 20 was fixed<br>
	suspended from the top thereof such that the spacing from the top internal wall 23 of<br>
	the liquid feeding zone 3 was approximately 8 cm. Moreover, the spacing between<br>
	the internal sidewall surface 22 of the liquid feeding zone 3 and the flow path<br>
	controlling member 20 was approximately 9 cm, and the spacing between the<br>
15	 perforated plate 2 and the flow path controlling member 20 was approximately 8 cm.<br>
	Note that a peripheral portion of the disk-shaped flow path controlling member 20<br>
	was designed such that the vertical section thereof was a semicircle of radius<br>
	approximately 1 cm, and was thus devised such that the liquid would not stagnate<br>
	around this peripheral portion. Moreover, the section of the joint between the<br>
20	 internal sidewall surface22 of the liquid feeding zone 3 and the perforated plate 2<br>
	was designed to be concave on the inside as shown in FIG. 6, and an angle E for the<br>
	rising portion was approximately 170°. The material of the evaporation apparatus<br>
	was all stainless steel. The discharging pump 8 is preferably a gear pump in the<br>
	case that the concentrated liquid is of high viscosity, and is an ordinary liquid-feeding<br>
25	pump in the case that the viscosity is not so high. The industrial evaporation<br>
	apparatus had a cylindrical side-wall casing 10 and a conical bottom-wall casing 11,<br>
34<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	and was such that L = 1,000 cm, h = 900 cm, D = 500 cm, d = 40 cm, C = 155°, S =<br>
	250 m2, A= 19.625 m2, A/ B = 156.25, D /d = 12.5, L/ D = 2, and r = 0.3 cm. All of<br>
	the formulae (1) to (12) were satisfied. Care was taken such that, in the liquid<br>
	feeding zone 3, the liquid containing lower boiling point materials fed in from the<br>
5	 liquid receiving port 1 passes between the upper surface of the flow path controlling<br>
	member 20 and the top internal wall 23 of the liquid feeding zone 3, and between the<br>
	internal sidewall surface 22 of the liquid feeding zone 3 and the flow path controlling<br>
	member 20, and is then distributed uniformly from the holes (e.g. 21) in the<br>
	perforated plate 2 to the guides 4 while flowing mainly from the peripheral portion<br>
10 	toward the central portion of the perforated plate 2. An inert gas feeding port 9 was<br>
	provided in a lower portion of the evaporation apparatus, and an evaporated material<br>
	outlet 6 (generally connected to a gas condenser and a pressure-reducing<br>
	apparatus) for the lower boiling point materials was provided in an upper portion of<br>
	the evaporation apparatus. A jacket or a heating tube for a heating medium was<br>
15 	provided on the outside of the evaporation apparatus, so that the evaporation<br>
	apparatus could be maintained at a prescribed temperature using the heating<br>
	medium.<br>
[Reference Example 1]:<br>
	Using the industrial evaporation apparatus of Example 1 as a polymerization<br>
20	 apparatus for a condensation polymer, an aromatic polycarbonate was produced. A<br>
	molten prepolymer (number average molecular weight Mn = 4,000) for the aromatic<br>
	polycarbonate that had been produced from bisphenol A and diphenyl carbonate<br>
	(molar ratio of diphenyl carbonate to bisphenol A = 1.05) and was held at 260°C was<br>
	continuously fed into the liquid feeding zone 3 from the liquid receiving port 1 by a<br>
25	 feed pump. The molten prepolymer, which was continuously fed into the<br>
	evaporation zone 5 (polymerization reaction zone) from the holes in the perforated<br>
35<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	plate 2 while flowing from the peripheral portion toward the central portion of the<br>
	perforated plate 2, was subjected to polymerization while flowing down along the<br>
	guides 4. The polymerization reaction zone was held at 80 Pa via a vacuum vent 6.<br>
	Produced aromatic polycarbonate entering into the bottom portion 11 of the<br>
5	 polymerization apparatus from the bottom of the guides 4 was continuously<br>
	withdrawn at a flow rate of 5.5 ton / hr from the discharge port 7 by the discharging<br>
	pump 8 such that the amount of the aromatic polycarbonate in the bottom portion 11<br>
	was constant.<br>
The number average molecular weight Mn of the aromatic polycarbonate<br>
10 	withdrawn from an outlet 12 after 50 hours from commencement of operation was<br>
10	,500, and the aromatic polycarbonate had a good color (b* = 3.2). Moreover, the<br>
	tensile elongation was 98%. The values of Mn for the aromatic polycarbonate<br>
	withdrawn from the outlet 12 after 60 hours, 100 hours, 500 hours, 1,000 hours,<br>
	2,000 hours, 3,000 hours, 4,000 hours, and 5,000 hours from commencement of<br>
15	 operation were 10,500, 10,550, 10,500, 10,550, 10,500, 10,500, 10,550, and 10,500<br>
	respectively, and hence operation was stable.<br>
The aromatic polycarbonate produced as above had a content of alkali metal<br>
	and/or alkaline earth metal compounds of 0.04 to 0.05 ppm in terms of the metallic<br>
	elements, which was used as the catalyst.<br>
20<br>
[Example 2]:<br>
	Polymerization equipment for a condensation polymerization type polymer in<br>
	which two industrial evaporation apparatuses each having a flow path controlling<br>
	member 20 and guides 4 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 are arranged in series. An<br>
25	 aromatic polycarbonate was produced using this polymerization equipment (first<br>
	polymerization apparatus plus second polymerization apparatus). The material of<br>
36<br><br>
A0501 UP24_KAN<br>
	the evaporation apparatuses was all stainless steel. The discharging pump 8 for<br>
	each of the evaporation apparatuses was a gear pump. The first polymerization<br>
	apparatus, which was of a guide-contacting downflow type, had a cylindrical<br>
	side-wall casing 10 and a conical bottom-wall casing 11, and was such that L = 950<br>
5	 cm, h = 850 cm, D = 400 cm, d = 20 cm, C = 150°, S = 750 m2, A= 12.56 m2, A/ B =<br>
	400, D / d = 20, L / D = 2.375, and r = 0.3 cm. Note that the diameter of the cross<br>
	section of the flow path controlling member 20 was a little small, but this cross<br>
	section had the same shape as in Example 1, and the spacings between the flow<br>
	path controlling member 20 and the wall surfaces (23 and 22) of the liquid feeding<br>
10	 zone 3 and the spacing between the flow path controlling member 20 and the<br>
	perforated plate 2 were as in Example 1. Moreover, as in Example 1, the section of<br>
