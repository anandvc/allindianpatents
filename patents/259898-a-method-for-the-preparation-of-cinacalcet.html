BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
N-[l(R)-(l-naphthyl)ethyl]-N-[3-[3-(trifluoromethyl)	phenyl]propyl]-l-amine	(herein<br>
"Cinacalcet"    or "CNC") has a CAS number of 226256-56-0, a formula of C22H22F3N and the following structure:<br><br><br>
CH3 Formula (I)<br>
This molecule is the free base form of Cinacalcet hydrochloride (herein "CNC-HCl"). having a<br>
CAS number of 364782-34-3 and the following structure:<br><br>
.HCI	CH3<br>
Formula (VII) CNC-HCl is marketed as SENSIPAR™, and is the first drug in a class ofcompounds known as Calcimimetics to be approved by the FDA.<br>
Calcimimetics are a class of orally active, small molecules that decrease the secretion of PTH by activating calcium receptors. The secretion of PTH is normally regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor. Calcimimetic agents increase the sensitivity of this receptor to calcium, which inhibits the release of parathyroid hormone, and lowers parathyroid hormone levels within a lew hours. Calcimimetics are used to treat hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by the over-secretion of PTH that results when calcium receptors on parathyroid glands fail to respond properly to calcium in the bloodstream. Elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). an indicator of secondary hyperparathyroidism, are associated with altered metabolism of calcium and phosphorus, bone pain, fractures, and an increased risk for cardiovascular death. As a calcimimetic. CNC-HCl is approved for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Treatment with CNC-HCl lowers serum levels of PTH as vvel] as the calcium/phosphorus ion product, a) measure of the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the blood.<br>
US 6,011,068 disclose inorganic ion receptor activity, especially calcium receptor-active molecules, such as those having the general structure of Cinacalcet.<br>
US 6,211,244 disclose calcium receptor-active compounds related to Cinacalcet and methods of making such compounds. In accordance with the patent, Cinacalcet may be produced by reacting 1-acetyl naphthalene with 3-[3-(trifluoromethyI)phenyl|propyiamine in the presence of titanium isopropoxide to produce an imine corresponding to Cinacalcet, followed by treatment with methanolic sodium cyanoborohydride and resoiution of the racemic Cinacalcet base by chiral liquid chromatography, according to Scheme 1:<br><br><br>
CNC base racemic Scheme 1<br>
Similarly, using the process disclosed in US 6,211,244, as well as DRUGS OF THE FUTURE (2002)<br>
27   (9):   831   the   desired   Cinacalcet   enantiomer   may   be   produced   by   reacting   (R)-l-(l-<br>
naphthyl)ethylamine   with   3-| 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propionaldehyde   in   the   presence  of<br>
titanium isopropoxide to produce the imine that corresponds to Cinacalcet, followed by treatment<br>
with ethanotic sodium cyanoborohydride. according to the following Scheme 2:<br><br>
R - CNC base<br>
Scheme 2<br>
US  6,211.244 disclose an additional  process for the synthesis of Cinacalcct.  This  process<br>
involves treating 3-trirluoromethylcinnamonitrile. which can be prepared as disclosed in US<br>
4,966,988. with diisobutyl aluminum hydride, followed by treating the intermediate aluminum-<br>
imine complex with (R)-I-(l-naphthyI)ethyIamine, and reducing the intermediate  imine with<br>
ethanolic sodium cyanoborohydride. according, to the following Scheme 3:<br><br><br>
Scheme 3<br>
These three processes however, require the use of reagents such as titanium isopropoxide which<br>
is highly hygroscopic and expensive, as well as toxic, and ethanotic or methanolic sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride. which is highly toxic and flammable, and  not environmentally friendly,<br>
making the processes difficult to apply on industrial scale.<br>
Thus, an alternative process for the preparation of cinacalcet base and cinacalcet salt, which is<br>
more direct, higher yield, environmental friendly and applicable to industrial scale production is<br>
desirable.<br>
