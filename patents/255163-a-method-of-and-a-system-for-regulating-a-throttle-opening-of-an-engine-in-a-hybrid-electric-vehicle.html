PRESSURE CONTROL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
	[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/840,389, filed on August 25, 2006, the disclosure of which is<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present disclosure relates to hybrid vehicles, and more<br>
particularly to regulating the engine of a hybrid vehicle in a fuel cut-off mode such<br>
as during deceleration fuel cut-off (DFCO) or electric motoring of the engine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Hybrid vehicles are driven by multiple powerplants including, but<br>
not limited to an internal combustion engine and an electric machine. The<br>
electric machine functions as a motor/generator. In a generator mode, the<br>
electric machine is driven by the engine to generate electrical energy used to<br>
power electrical loads or charge batteries. In a motor mode, the electric machine<br>
supplements the engine, providing drive torque to drive the vehicle drivetrain.<br>
[0004]	In some instances, the fuel is cut-off to the engine during<br>
deceleration (referred to as deceleration fuel cut-off (DFCO)) or electric motoring<br>
of the engine. During these events, the engine is back driven, which induces<br>
reciprocal movement of the cylinders within the engine. As a result of the back<br>
1<br><br>
driving of the engine, the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) of an intake manifold<br>
of the engine is significantly reduced, resulting in reduced efficiency and other<br>
losses. More specifically, reduced MAP results in low pressure in the intake<br>
ports and in the combustion chamber (i.e., within the cylinder in the space above<br>
the piston).<br>
[0005]	If the pressure is too low, the oil can be drawn out of the engine<br>
crankcase through the piston rings, the valve guides disposed within the inlet<br>
ports, as well as through other paths. The piston rings can also flutter or vibrate<br>
depending on dynamic pressure differences between the crank case and the<br>
combustion chamber, which can be detrimental to the engine and may be<br>
perceptible by vehicle occupants.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] 	Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
regulating a throttle opening of an engine in a hybrid electric vehicle system. The<br>
method includes initiating a fuel-cut off operating mode of the engine, monitoring<br>
an engine speed during the fuel cut-off operating mode and regulating the throttle<br>
opening based on the engine speed during the fuel-cut off mode to maintain a<br>
manifold absolute pressure (MAP) of the engine above a threshold MAP. By<br>
maintaining the MAP above the threshold MAP, the above-described low<br>
pressure conditions are avoided. More specifically, the pressure is maintained<br>
sufficiently high to inhibit drawing out of the engine oil from the engine crankcase<br>
and to prevent flutter or vibration of the piston rings.<br>
2<br><br>
[0007] 	Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] 	The present disclosure will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0009] 	Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary hybrid<br>
vehicle system;<br>
[0010] 	Figure 2 is a graph illustrating exemplary manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP) traces based on the MAP control of the present disclosure;<br>
[0011] 	Figure 3 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary steps executed by<br>
the MAP control of the present disclosure; and<br>
[0012] 	Figure 4 is a functional block diagram of exemplary modules<br>
that execute the MAP control of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] 	The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
3<br><br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0014] 	As used herein, a fuel cut-off operating (FCO) mode refers to<br>
operation during which fuel is cut off to the engine such as during deceleration<br>
fuel cut-off (DFCO), electric motoring of the engine or other FCO modes.<br>
[0015] 	Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary hybrid vehicle 10<br>
includes an engine 12 and an electric machine 14, which drive a transmission 16.<br>
More specifically, the electric machine 14 supplements the engine 12 to produce<br>
drive torque to drive the transmission 16. In this manner, fuel efficiency is<br>
increased and emissions are reduced. The engine 12 and electric machine 14<br>
are coupled via a belt-alternator-starter (BAS) system 18. More specifically, the<br>
electric machine 14 operates as a starter (i.e., motor) and an alternator (i.e.,<br>
generator) and is coupled to the engine 12 through a belt and pulley system.<br>
The engine 12 and the electric machine 14 include pulleys 20, 22, respectively,<br>
that are coupled for rotation by a belt 24. The pulley 20 is coupled for rotation<br>
with a crankshaft 26 of the engine 12.<br>
[0016] 	In one mode, the engine 12 drives the electric machine 14 to<br>
generate power used to recharge an energy storage device (ESD) 28. In another<br>
mode, the electric machine 14 drives the engine 12 using energy from the ESD<br>
28. The ESD 28 can include, but is not limited to, a battery or a super-capacitor.<br>
Alternatively, the BAS system 18 can be replaced with a flywheel-alternator-<br>
4<br><br>
starter (FAS) system (not shown), which includes an electric machine operably<br>
disposed between the engine and the transmission or a chain or gear system<br>
that is implemented between the electric machine 14 and the crankshaft 26.<br>
[0017] 	The transmission 16 can include, but is not limited to, a manual<br>
transmission, an automatic transmission, a continuously variable transmission<br>
(CVT) and an automated manual transmission (AMT). Drive torque is transferred<br>
from the engine crankshaft 26 to the transmission 16 through a coupling device<br>
30. The coupling device 30 can include, but is not limited to, a friction clutch or a<br>
torque converter depending upon the type of transmission implemented. The<br>
transmission 16 multiplies the drive torque through one of a plurality of gear<br>
ratios to drive a driveshaft 32.<br>
[0018] 	A control module 34 regulates operation of the vehicle 10. The<br>
control module 34 controls fuel injection and spark to selectively activate and<br>
deactivate cylinders of the engine 12. More specifically, when the vehicle 10 is at<br>
rest, none of the cylinders of the engine 12 are firing (i.e., are deactivated) and<br>
the engine 12 is stopped. During vehicle launch (i.e., acceleration from rest), the<br>
electric machine 14 drives the crankshaft to spin-up the engine 12 to an idle RPM<br>
and to initiate vehicle acceleration. During periods where low drive torque is<br>
needed to drive the vehicle (i.e., a hybrid engine off (HEOff) mode), drive torque<br>
is provided by the electric machine 14. When in the HEOff mode, fuel and spark<br>
are cut-off to the cylinders of the engine. Further, opening and closing cycles of<br>
the intake and exhaust valves can be prevented to inhibit air flow processing<br>
within the cylinders.<br>
5<br><br>
[0019] 	An accelerator pedal 36 is provided. A pedal position sensor 36<br>
is sensitive to a position of the accelerator pedal 36 and generates a pedal<br>
position signal based thereon. A brake pedal 40 is provided. A brake pedal<br>
position sensor 42 is sensitive to a position of the brake pedal 40 and generates<br>
a pedal position signal based thereon. The control module 34 operates a brake<br>
system 43 based on the brake pedal position signal to adjust a pressure within<br>
the brake system, which in turn regulates a braking force of brakes (not shown).<br>
A speed sensor 44 is responsive to the rotational speed (RPMEM) of the electric<br>
machine 44. The speed sensor 44 generates a speed signal. The control<br>
module 34 operates the vehicle 10 based on the pedal position signals generated<br>
by the pedal position sensors 38, 42 and the speed signal generated by the<br>
speed sensor 44, as described in further detail below. The engine speed<br>
(RPMENG) can be determined based on the speed signal. More specifically,<br>
RPMEM can be multiplied by the known pulley ratio to provide RPMENG<br>
[0020] 	The manifold absolute pressure (MAP) control of the present<br>
disclosure regulates the position of the throttle while the engine is being operated<br>
in a fuel cut-off (FCO) mode. More specifically, during deceleration fuel and<br>
spark are cut-off, preferably on a cylinder by cylinder basis, and the electric<br>
machine 14 regeneratively brakes the vehicle to charge the ESD 28. The MAP<br>
control of the present disclosure monitors RPMENG and adjusts the throttle<br>
position to maintain the MAP above a threshold level. Fuel cut-off may also<br>
occur during electric motoring of the engine.<br>
6<br><br>
[0021] With particular reference to Figure 2, if the engine is operating in<br>
the FCO mode, MAP is monitored and is maintained above a threshold MAP<br>
(MAPTHR). More specifically, the MAP control regulates the throttle area (AIHR)<br>
based on engine RPM. A target or minimum MAP value is determined from a<br>
look-up table based on engine RPM. ATHR is determined from the minimum MAP<br>
value. More specifically, the MAP value is processed through a MAP-based<br>
torque model to calculate a desired torque (TDES)- In a toque-based system, TDES<br>
can be used for engine control, wherein the torque model accounts for fuel cut<br>
scenarios. For airflow-based systems, a desired air per cylinder (APC) is<br>
determined based on the MAP value by solving for APC using an inverse APC<br>
torque model. By dividing the desired APC by an intake period, a minimum mass<br>
air flow (MAF) needed to satisfy the desired MAP is determined. ATHR is then<br>
determined based on the minimum MAF.<br>
[0022] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
MAP control will be described in detail. In step 300, control determines whether<br>
the engine is being operated in the FCO mode. If the engine is not being<br>
operated in the FCO mode, control ends. If the engine is operating in the FCO<br>
mode, control monitors RPMENG in step 302. In step 304, control determines<br>
ATHR based on RPMENG. Control regulates the throttle based on ATHR in step 308<br>
and loops back to step 300.<br>
[0023] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
MAP control will be described in detail. The exemplary modules include an AIHR<br>
determining module 400, an AOFFSET determining module 402, a throttle control<br>
7<br><br>
module 404 and a FCO module 406. The ATHR determining module 400<br>
determines ATHR and outputs an ATHR value to the throttle control module 404.<br>
Similarly, the AOFFSET determining module 400 determines AOFFSET based on<br>
RPMENG AND outputs an AOFFSET value to the throttle control module 404.<br>
[0024] The FCO module 406 determines whether the engine is<br>
operating in the FCO mode and outputs an appropriate signal to the throttle<br>
control module 404. The throttle control module 404 regulates the throttle<br>
position based on ATHR and AOFFSET More specifically, if the engine is operating<br>
in the FCO mode, the throttle control module 404 generates throttle control<br>
signals based on ATHR and AOFFSET. If the engine is not operating in the FCO<br>
mode, the throttle control module 404 generates throttle control signals based on<br>
ATHR<br>
