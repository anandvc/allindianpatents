COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
HAIR CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>
HAIR CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
5  The invention is concerned with hair-conditioning<br>
compositions.  It is particularly concerned with hair conditioner compositions, which are applied to the hair after washing or shampooing and subsequent rinsing. More specifically, it is concerned with improving the deposition of 10  conditioning oil onto the tip region of hair, from hair<br>
conditioner compositions which contain dispersed hydrophobic conditioning oil droplets.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
15<br>
Hair conditioner compositions which provide conditioning to the hair are well known in the art.  Such compositions comprise one or more conditioning agents.  The purpose of the conditioning agent is to make the hair easier to comb when wet<br>
20  and more manageable when dry, e.g. less static and fly-away. They also make the hair feel softer.  Typically, these conditioning agents are either water-insoluble oily materials which act by spreading on the hair in the form of a film, or cationic surfactant materials or polymers, which adsorb onto<br>
25  the hair surface.<br>
Hair conditioners can be in the form of rinse-off conditioners (usually applied to the hair after shampooing as a liquid or mousse) or leave-on products such as hair oils or serums, 30  mousses and styling products.<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCTVEP03/04238<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
Typically, water-insoluble oily conditioning materials are dispersed in aqueous products in the form of small droplets or particles in order to facilitate the stability of the dispersion to phase separation and to enhance the deposition 5  of the oily material onto the hair.<br>
A preferred water-insoluble oily conditioning material is based on silicone polymers, preferably polydimethylsiloxanes, with or without various functionalising groups.  Non-silicone 10  conditioning oils include hydrocarbon oils and triglycerides.<br>
Although these cationic surfactants, cationic polymers and water-insoluble oily conditioning materials provide conditioning effects to the hair, it is desirable to improve 15  the conditioning effects obtainable from them.<br>
Natural oils secreted by the sebaceous gland at the base of the hair lead to hair being more hydrophobic near the root rather than near the tip.  This means that droplets of 20  hydrophobic conditioning oil deposited onto hair are more<br>
likely to spread and form films on the hair at the base of the hair rather than near the tip of the hair, and this is found in practice.<br>
25  Certain consumers find the effects arising from this effect to be undesirable in that it may lead to the. hair feeling greasy at the roots or heavy and dull.<br>
In attempts to overcome the problems in the prior art, it has 30  been considered desirable to target the deposition of the<br>
conditioning oil droplets onto the tip regions of the hair in<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>

preference to the basal regions, and much research has been carried.out in this field of work.  Although it would be desirable to make the surface of the oil droplets more hydrophilic, it had always been considered that the high 5  levels of cationic surfactant in rinse-off hair conditioner compositions would dominate the surface chemistry and hydrophilicity of the oil droplets.  Thus the conventional view is that irrespective of any additives added to the conditioning oil droplets, the conditioning surfactant would 10  control the droplet hydrophilicity and deposition.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, that by blending certain types of surface active block copolymers of a high molecular<br>
"        weight with conditioning oil emulsion droplets, enhanced<br>
15  deposition of the droplets onto the tip regions of hairs can be achieved.  Although not wishing to be bound by the scientific reasoning underlying this phenomenon, it seems that surface active polymer remains at the droplet surface, even in the presence of other surfactant molecules from the<br>
20  conditioner, making the droplets more hydrophilic than the droplets in conventional oil droplet-containing hair conditioner compositions.  This leads to improved deposition of the droplets towards the more hydrophilic tip region of the hair.<br>
25<br>
The present invention concerns the use of Poloxamers (CTFA designation) to enhance the deposition of hydrophobic conditioning oil onto the hair tip region from hair conditioner compositions, particularly from rinse-off<br>
3 0  conditioner- compositions.<br><br>

The mean molecular weight is suitably measured by determining the hydroxy1 number for the polymer then transforming this into molecular weight.  This corresponds to a number based mean molecular weight. 10<br>
Suitable EO/PO block copolymers according to formula I have the CTFA designation Poloxatner.<br>

In order for such an oil to exist in discrete droplets in the compositions according to the invention, it must be water-insoluble.  By water-insoluble is meant that the solubility in water at 25°C is 0.01% by weight or less. 10<br>
It is preferred if the conditioning oil is non-volatile, by which it is meant that the vapour pressure of the oil at 25°C is less than 10 Pa.<br>

It is preferred that the d(0.5) volume-based median particle diameter of the hydrophobic conditioning oil droplets in the composition is less than 100 micrometres, more preferably less than 40 micrometres, even more preferably less than 10 5  micrometres and most preferably less than 6 micrometres.<br>
Larger particle diameters lead to problems in stabilising the composition from separation of components. Practical difficulties in making emulsion droplets with a median diameter of 0.02 micrometres or less are known to those<br>
10  skilled in the art.  Thus it is preferred if the volume-based median diameter d(0.5) is greater than 0.02 micrometres, more preferably greater than 0.03 micrometres, even more preferably greater than 0.1 micrometres.  Preferred ranges of median diameter can be formed by combining any of the preferred<br>
15 minimum diameters with any of the preferred maximum diameters. Volume-based median droplet diameter d(0.5) may be measured by means of a laser light scattering technique, for example using a 2600D Particle Sizer from Malvern Instruments.<br>
20  The total amount of hydrophobic conditioning oil present in the composition is preferably from 0.1% to 10 % by weight of the total composition more preferably from 0.2% to 6%, most preferably 0.5% to 4 %.<br>
25  Silicone Conditioning oils<br>
Preferred hydrophobic conditioning oils for use in compositions according to the invention are silicones.<br>
3 0  Suitable silicones for use as conditioning oils include<br>
polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
which have the CTFA designation dimethicone.  Also suitable for use in compositions of the invention are polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxy1 end groups, which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol. 5<br>
It is preferred if the silicone oil also comprises a functionalised silicone.  Suitable functionalised silicones include, for example, amino-, carboxy-, betaine-, quaternary ammonium-, carbohydrate-, hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted 10  silicones. Preferably, the functionalised silicone contains multiple substitutions.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as regards hydroxyl-substituted silicones, a polyditnethylsiloxane merely having hydroxyl end<br>
15  groups (which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol) is not considered a functionalised silicone within the present invention.  However, a polydimethylsiloxane having hydroxyl substitutions along the polymer chain is considered a functionalised silicone.<br>
20  Preferred functionalised silicones are amino-functionalised silicones.  Suitable amino functionalised silicones are described in EP 455,185 (Helene Curtis) and include trimethylsilylamodimethicone as depicted below, and are sufficiently water insoluble so as to be useful in<br>
25  compositions of the invention:<br><br>
30  wherein x + y is a number from about 50 to about 500, and the weight percent amine functionality is in the range of from<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
about 0.03% to about 8% by weight of the molecule, and wherein R is an alkylene group having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Preferably, the number x + y is in the range of from about 100 to about 300, and the weight percent amine functionality is in 5  the range of from about 0.03% to 8% by weight of the molecule.<br>
As expressed here, the weight percent amine functionality is measured by titrating a sample of the amino-functionalised silicone against alcoholic hydrochloric acid to the 10  bromocresol green end point.  The weight percent amine is calculated using a molecular weight of 45 (corresponding to<br>
CH3- CH2-NH2)<br>
Suitably, the weight percent amine functionality measured and 15  calculated in this way is in the range from 0.03% to 8%, preferably from 0.5% to 4%.<br>
An example of a commercially available amino-functionalised silicone useful in the silicone component of the composition 20  of the invention is DC-8566 available from Dow Corning (INCI name: dimethyl,methyl (aminoethylaminoisobutyl) siloxane) . This has a weight percent amine functionality of about 1.4%.<br>

Suitable methods for measuring the kinematic viscosity of silicone oils are known to those skilled in the art, e.g. capillary viscometers.  For high viscosity silicones, a 25  constant stress rheometer can also be used to measure dynamic viscosity which is related to kinematic viscosity by the<br>
density of the silicone.  The viscosity should be measured at<br>
-1 low shear rates, typically less than 10 s  , such that the<br><br>

Particularly useful quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants for use in hair conditioners of the invention are cetyltrimethylammonium 10  chloride, available commercially, for example as GENAMIN CTAC, ex Hoechst Celanese and Arguad 16/29 supplied by Akzo Nobel, and behenyltrimethylammonium chloride (BTAC) such as Genamin KDM-P supplied by Clariant.<br>
15  Another suitable cationic conditioning surfactant is a<br>
dialkoylalkyl dime thyl ammonium halide. An ecample of such a compound has the CTFA designation dipalmi toye thyl dime thylammonium chloride.<br>
20  Further suitable cationic systems are primary, secondary, and<br>

Fatty Materials<br>
5<br>
Conditioner compositions of the invention preferably ^additionally comprise fatty materials.  The combined use of fatty materials and cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because 10  this leads to the formation of a structured lamellar or liquid crystal phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
By "fatty material" is meant a fatty alcohol, an alkoxylated fatty alcohol, a fatty acid or a mixture thereof. 15  Preferably, the alkyl chain of the fatty material is fully saturated.<br>
Representative fatty materials comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Examples of suitable fatty 20  alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof.  The use of these materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br>
25  Alkoxylated, (e.g. ethoxylated or propoxylated) fatty alcohols having from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain can be used in place of, or in addition to, the fatty alcohols themselves.  Suitable examples include ethylene glycol cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene (2) stearyl ether,<br>

10  The compositions of the present invention may also contain<br>
adjuvants suitable for hair care.  Generally such ingredients are included individually at a level of up to 2%, preferably up to 1 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
15  Among suitable hair care adjuvants, are natural hair root nutrients, such as amino acids and sugars.

2 0  acids may be added singly, in mixtures, or in the form of<br>
peptides, e.g. di- and tripeptides.  The amino acids may also be added in the form of a protein hydrolysate, such as a keratin or collagen hydrolysate.  Suitable sugars are glucose, dextrose and fructose.  These may be added singly or in the<br>
25  form of, e.g. fruit extracts.  A particularly preferred<br>
combination of natural hair root nutrients for inclusion in compositions of the invention is isoleucine and glucose.  A particularly preferred amino acid nutrient is arginine. Another suitable adjuvant is glycolic acid.<br><br>

Optional Ingredients<br>
Compositions of this invention may contain any other ingredient normally used in hair treatment formulations. 5  These other ingredients may include viscosity modifiers,<br>
preservatives, colouring agents, polyols such as glycerine and polypropylene glycol, chelating agents such as. EDTA, antioxidants, fragrances, antimicrobials and sunscreens. Each of these ingredients will be present in an amount effective to 10  accomplish its purpose.  Generally these optional ingredients are included individually at a level of up to 5% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Preparation of Compositions<br>
15<br>
One method for preparing compositions according to the<br>
invention is to add hydrophobic conditioning oil to the other<br>
components comprising the hair conditioner composition,<br>
followed by suitable mixing of the composition in order to<br>
20  ensure that the blend is dispersed as droplets of a suitable<br>
size.<br>
However it is preferred if the hydrophobic conditioning oil is first formed into an aqueous emulsion prior to incorporation 25  into the hair conditioner composition.  Thus another aspect of the invention is a method for preparing an aqueous hair conditioner composition comprising the steps of:<br>
i) preparing a solution comprising water and the surface active block, copolymer, 30      ii) adding a water-insoluble conditioning oil to the solution,<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>
-   25   -<br>
iii) forming the solution and the conditioning oil into an oil-in-water emulsion by high-shear mixing, iv) dispersing the oil-in-water emulsion comprising the block copolymer into a hair conditioner composition. 5  Another preferred method for preparing a hair conditioning<br>
composition according to the invention comprises the steps of:<br>
i) preparing an oil-in-water emulsion of a water-insoluble conditioning oil, 10<br>
ii) dispersing the surface active block copolymer into the emulsion,<br>
iii) dispersing said oil-in-water emulsion comprising the 15      block copolymer into a hair conditioner composition.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers for use in the preparation of the aqueous emulsion are well known in the art and include anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and nonionic surfactants,<br>
20  and mixtures thereof.  Examples of anionic surfactants used as emulsifiers for the conditioning oil particles are alkylarylsulphonates, e.g., sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, alkyl sulphates e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, alkyl ether sulphates, e.g., sodium lauryl ether sulphate nEO, where n is<br>
25  from 1 to 20, alkylphenol ether sulphates, e.g., octylphenol ether sulphate nEO where n is from 1 to 20, and sulphosuccinates, e.g., sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate.<br>
Examples of nonionic surfactants suitable for use as 3 0  emulsifiers for the conditioning oil droplets are alkylphenol ethoxylates, e.g., nonylphenol ethoxylate nEO, where n is from<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>
-   26   -<br>
" l...tQ...5.0 and alcohol ethoxylates, e.g., lauryl alcohol nEO, where n is from 1 to 50, ester ethoxylates, e.g., polyoxyethylene monostearate where the number of oxyethylene units is from 1 to 30. 5<br>
A preferred process for preparing oil-in-water emulsions of the droplets comprising the hydrophobic conditioning oil, which can then be incorporated in the hair treatment compositions, involves use of a mixer.  Depending upon the<br>
10  viscosity of the conditioning oil, a suitable mixer should be chosen so as to provide sufficient shear to give the required final particle size of the emulsion.  Examples of suitable benchtop mixers spanning the range of necessary shear are Heidolph RZR2100, Silverson L4R, Rannie mini-lab high pressure<br>
15  homogeniser and Ystral X10/20-750. Other mixers of similar specification are well known to those skilled in the art and can also be used in this application. Equally it is possible to manufacture oil-in-water emulsions of this description on larger scale mixers which offer similar shear regimes to those<br>
20  described above.<br>
It is also possible to produce suitable emulsions, for use in compositions according to the invention, by means of emulsion polymerisation of the silicone rather than by mechanical<br>
25  emulsification.  In this case a preferred process is to add the block copolymer to the emulsion after emulsion polymerisation before combining the blend of emulsion and block copolymer with the rest of the composition. Preferably, the mixer is also capable of controlling the<br>
30  temperature of the components during mixing, e.g. it comprises<br><br>
WO 03/094873<br><br>
PCT/EP03/04238<br><br>
-   27   -<br>
. a jacket through which a heat transfer fluid can be circulated.<br>
It is preferred if the aqueous phase of the emulsion contains 5  a polymeric thickening agent to prevent phase separation of the emulsion after preparation.  Preferred thickening agents are cross-linked polyacrylates, cellulosic polymers or derivatives of cellulosic polymers.<br>
10  Mousses<br>
Hair conditioner compositions in accordance with the invention may also take the form of aerosol foams (mousses) in which case a propellant may be included in the composition.  This 15  agent is responsible for expelling the other materials from the container and forming the hair mousse character.<br>
The propellant gas can be any liquefiable	gas conventionally<br>
used for aerosol containers.  Examples of	suitable propellants<br>
20  include dimethyl ether, propane, n-butane	and isobutane, used<br>
singly or in admixture.<br>
The amount of the propellant gases is governed by normal factors well known in the aerosol art.  For hair mousses, the 25  level of propellant is generally from 3 to 30, preferably from 5 to 15 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
Alternatively, the mousse may be generated mechanically without the need for a propellant by use of a suitable foam-30  generating container.<br><br>

Mode of Use<br>
The compositions of the invention are primarily intended for topical application to the hair and/or scalp and or skin of a 5  human subject as rinse-off treatments to improve hair fibre surface properties such as smoothness, softness, manageability, cuticle integrity, and shine.  In particular, compositions according to the invention are used for improving the deposition of conditioning oil onto the tip region of 10  hair.<br>
Thus another aspect of the invention is a method for enhancing deposition of water-insoluble conditioning oil from a hair-conditioner composition onto the hair tip region by applying 15  to the hair a composition according to the invention followed by rinsing with water.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is the use of a composition according to the invention for enhancing deposition of water-2 0  insoluble conditioning oil onto the tip region of hair.<br>
The invention is further demonstrated with reference to the following, non-limiting examples: Examples 25<br>

0.25g/5 cm switches of tip hair which had been cleaned with a 15  solution of 14% SLES 2BO and 2% cocoamidopropyl betaine in water followed by extensive rinsing, were used for this experiment. The test hair conditioner composition was diluted to 1 in 5 by weight with distilled water and stirred throughout with a magnetic stirrer.  5 switches were placed in one half of a petri 20  dish. 1.5 mis of diluted hair conditioner was placed along the<br><br>

length of the switches which were then agitated in the dish for 30 seconds, followed by a rinse for 30 seconds under tap water (12° French hard) at 40°C, with a flow rate set at 3-4 litres per minute.  The switches were then allowed to dry naturally at 5  25° C and a relative humidity of 45 to 60%.<br>
A control experiment was carried out without use of the conditioner, to obtain the background level of silicone present on the tip hair switches. 10<br>
The amount of silicone deposited on the hair samples was measured using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (measured in parts per million (ppm) of silicon).<br>
