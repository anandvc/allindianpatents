				<td>This invention relates to a device useful for the preparation of coffee-chicory extract in a single step.<br>
The device of the present invention may be used for the preparation of coffee-chicory extracts from blends of roasted and ground (R&amp;G) coffee and R&amp;G chicory wherein the chicory content varies from 10-40g%. The extracts containing 20-28g% soluble solids are used, after suitable dilution, in the preparation of coffee beverage either as black coffee or with milk and sugar. Apart from this, the extracts can also be used in the manufacture of confectioneries such as coffee toffees and carbonated coffee beverages.<br>
It is well known that coffee brew is generally prepared either by soaking R&amp;G coffee in hot water and filtering or passing hot water through R&amp;G coffee taken in a conventional filter. By these methods an aroma-rich coffee brew may be obtained but the efficiency of extraction is very low resulting in a dilute extract of 4-6째Brix. However, to obtain an extract with higher brix the quantity of R&amp;G coffee has to be more and water used for extraction less. This will amount to increased cost and may not be economically viable, as the efficiency of extraction will be poor. The use of R&amp;G coffee blended with finely powdered chicory in different proportions is also known wherein the extracts obtained separately are used to make such blends which possess<br><br>
more soluble solids than those from pure coffee. The coffee-chicory extracts are thicker (better body) provide less coffee aroma to the coffee beverage. These extracts possess a very short storage life of a few hours only after which they lose their aroma, become stale and also are prone to microbial spoilage.<br>
A few patents relevant but different to the present invention either use a multistage extraction of coffee volatiles first, non-volatiles next through pressure extraction followed by addition of chicory to the spent coffee and extracting again and finally compounding all the extracts to obtain a consolidated coffee-chicory extract. Reference may be made to UK Pat.No 583344,1981 Reference may be made to Japanese Pat No  156969,1977 wherein a two stage extraction process of extracting the volatiles at low temperature (50-80째C), adding chicory to the spent coffee and extracting with water at 100-120째C followed by combining the two extracts and adding a solution of furfuryl mercaptan to the extract to obtain coffee-chicory extract with boosted coffee flavor.<br>
The former patent ( UK No 1583344,1981) uses a three step extraction unit. Here the first extract containing the more volatile constituents of coffee and the coffee-chicory extract obtained through the third step are mixed<br><br>
together. Since this extract is diluted it is subjected to a concentration step, which causes loss of aroma in the extract. The pressure extraction in the second step also results in hydrolysis enabling more non-volatiles to be extracted which provide body but not aroma. In the second patent ( Japanese Pat.No 156969,1977), the first and second extraction at low and high temperatures respectively result in a dilute extract (coffee to water ratio being high) and also a flavor enhancer such as furfuryl mercaptan is added which affects the "'naturalness' of the coffee extract. An earlier work of Central Food Technological Research Institute (Ann.Report,1978-79,p.no 54) relates to the extraction of R&amp;G coffee using a battery of percolators (75-80째C) whereby extract concentration of 30% could be obtained.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for preparation of coffee- chicory extract in a single step.<br>
In figure 1 of drawing accompanying this specification a schematic diagram of an embodiment of device of present invention is shown.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful for the preparation of coffee-chicory extract in a single step characterized by a vertical jacketed column (1) consisting of two concentric cylinders of identical length, with a gap in between them, the said column at its top being provided with a lid covered inlet (3) and an outlet valve (9) at the bottom, a filter ring (10) being fixed by flanges &amp; wing nut (3,11) at the bottom portion (8) of the said jacketed column (1), the said outer cylinder of the said jacketed column (1) being provided with an inlet in the<br><br>
bottom portion, an outlet (4) and a vent valve (5,6) in the upper portion, the said inlet being connected to hot water/steam generation system (2,14,15,16), the said jacketed column being mounted on a stand (12,13).<br>
No equipment of the device is available for the single step extraction of coffee-chicory extract. Using the device of the present invention a concentrated coffee-chicory extractby a simplified process, without sacrificing the overall aroma and flavour quality of the extract, may be obtained. It is very much different from hitherto known processes in that it employs an extraction system which extracts maximum soluble solids under the conditions employed in a single operation.<br>
The process consists in roasting green coffee beans: arabica plantation, robusta cherry and arabica cherry, preparing blends of these roasted beans, grinding, mixing with chicory powder and then extracting the solubles in a single step. During roasting, the bulk density of the beans decreases from 0.4-0.7 to 0.28-0.36 g/ml due to a weight loss of 12 to 20%. The blend of roasted beans is powdered coarse and wetted with an aqueous liquid. The<br><br>
wet powder is allowed to be conditioned for 15-30 min at ambient temperature (27째C) when the bulk density increases to 0.42 to 0.48 g/ml. The wet R&amp;G coffee is then charged into the extraction system (Fig.l). The bed of coffee is kept hot (85-90째C) by passing steam (for 30-45 min) through the jacket or alternatively boiling water. Keeping the ball valve open at the bottom of the extractor, hot aqueous extraction liquid (85-95째C) is allowed to percolate through the bed until the first few drops of the extract are sighted in the receiver. Immediately, the ball valve is closed and a contact time of 15-30 min is allowed. The extract is then collected in the receiver. Once again hot aqueous extraction liquid is let into the percolator and after a similar contact time, the extract is collected in the receiver. The above operation is repeated once more until a total of 40-60% extract is collected. The extract has a fine coffee aroma. The extract is preserved with the addition of a preservative such as sodium benzoate and flushed with an inert gas such as carbon dioxide.<br>
In our co-pending patent application No 2.15 5/
 <br>
In the drawing accompanying the specification, figure 1 depicts an embodiment of the present invention useful for the preparation of coffee-chicory extract. The system can also be used for the preparation of pure coffee extract. The extraction system consists of a vertical fixed bed extractor column (1), hot water tank (2) and hot water circulation system. The column contains two concentric cylinders of identical lengths. The inner cylinder is rolled using 16 swg AISI 304 SS sheet and outer by 16 swg CR sheet. A gap of 25 mm between two columns provides space for easy circulation of hot water/steam. Both the cylinders are welded to SS flanges (3) at the top and bottom. MS collars of size 12.5 mm (4) are welded at top, bottom and middle of the extractor for hot water/steam inlet, outlet and for fixing the thermometer respectively. MS collar of size 6.2 mm (5) is welded at approximately one-third of the length of the column from the top for fixing an air vent valve (6). At the middle, a dial thermometer (7) (0-150째C) is fitted for measuring the temperature of water/steam in the jacket.<br>
A detachable swinging type extract collection disc (8) is fabricated and attached to the bottom of the extractor column. A SS ball valve, 12.5 mm, (9) is fitted at the bottom of the collection disc for easy collection and control of flow of coffee-chicory extract. A stepped groove on the collection flange<br><br>
facilitates provision for fixing 60 mesh filter ring (10) and dairy-type temperature resistant food grade rubber gasket for avoiding leakage of the extract. Collection flange is fixed rigidly to the bottom of extractor flange by 6 SS eye bolt and wing nut system (11). A strainer means placed at the bottom end of the column filters the liquid as it leaves the extractor. A clearing means prevents clogging of the strainer with particulate matter. Extraction liquid is passed through one end of the extractor maintained hot and the extract is collected at the other end.<br>
The above assembly is totally mounted on a split muff clamp (12) on a pipe tripod stand (13) with a provision for adjusting the height of the column and the collection point. Hot conditioning and hot extraction is taken care of by suitable design of hot water circulation system. This system consists of a hot water tank fitted with a suitable heating coil (14) with 12.5 mm inlet and outlet points. The bottom of the tank is connected to the suction side of the sealless, special purpose, temperature resistant pump (15) of capacity 60 LPM with a magnetic coupled fraction hp single phase motor with matching inlet and outlet ports. The outlet of the pump is connected to the bottom of the column through a gun metal non-return valve (16). The top discharge port<br><br>
of the extractor is connected to the inlet of the hot water tank.  Without this hot water circulation system, the extractor can also be operated with steam. The applicability of the device of the present invention is further<br>
illustrated in the following examples.  However this should not be<br>
tU*. zcssfta. construed to limits/of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A coffee blend (5 kg) consisting of roasted arabica plantation and robusta cherry in the ratio 4:1 was ground to a particle size of 800 \i and extracted with hot water (10.5 L; 90째C) after initial wetting and hot conditioning. A 5 L coffee extract was obtained with total soluble solids (TSS) of 17g% and pH 5.0. The extract had a good colour, bitterness and a rich coffee aroma.<br>
Example 2<br>
A coffee blend (5 kg) containing roasted beans of robusta cherry, arabica cherry and arabica plantation in the ratio of 5:3:2 was ground to a particle size of 800 ji and subjected to extraction with hot water (10.5L) according to the procedure described earlier. A 5 L coffee extract was obtained with a good colour, bitterness and a pleasant coffee aroma.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
R&amp;G coffee blend (any of the two given in examples 1 and 2) was mixed with R&amp;G chicory . The chicory content in the coffee-chicory mixture was 20% (w/w). This coffee-chicory blend was extracted with hot water (90째C; 11.5 L) and 5 L extract collected according to the procedure described earlier. The extract was slightly more acidic (pH 4.8) and total soluble solids varied from 24g%. The extracts possessed a dark brown colour, sourness and a mild/pleasant coffee aroma.<br>
