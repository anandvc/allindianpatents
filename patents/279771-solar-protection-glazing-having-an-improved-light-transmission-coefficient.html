SOLAR-PROTECTION GLAZING HAVING AN IMPROVED<br>
LIGHT TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENT<br>
The invention relates to glazing provided with thin-<br>
film multilayer coatings, one of the layers of which is<br>
a functional layer, that is to say it acts on solar<br>
radiation. The present invention relates more<br>
particularly to multilayer-coated glazing, especially<br>
that intended for thermal insulation and/or solar<br>
protection.<br>
The term "functional" layer is understood within the<br>
context of the present invention to mean the layer or<br>
layers of the multilayer coating that give the latter<br>
most of its thermal properties, as opposed to the other<br>
layers, which are generally made of a dielectric<br>
material and have the function of chemically or<br>
mechanically protecting said functional layers, or else<br>
another function, for example an optical function,<br>
adhesion function, etc.<br>
The solar-protection glazing according to the invention<br>
is . more particularly suitable for fitting into<br>
buildings: by limiting the amount of solar radiation<br>
energy transmitted, thanks to the thin layers, such<br>
glazing prevents the interior of rooms from being<br>
excessively heated in the summer and thus helps to<br>
limit the consumption of energy needed for air-<br>
conditioning them.<br>
The invention also relates to this type of glazing once<br>
it has been covered with said thin layers, in order to<br>
obtain a wall cladding panel, called more<br>
conventionally "curtain walling", which makes it<br>
possible, in combination with window glazing, to<br>
provide buildings . with exterior surfaces that are<br>
entirely glazed.<br>
Solar-protection functional multilayer-coated glazing<br>
 <br>
<br>
is subject to a number of constraints: firstly, the<br>
layers employed must filter out the solar radiation<br>
sufficiently, and especially the non-visible part of<br>
the solar, radiation lying between about 780 nm and<br>
2500 nm, usually called solar infrared (or solar IR) .<br>
Furthermore, this thermal performance must preserve the<br>
optical and aesthetic appearance of the glazing: in<br>
particular, it is desirable to be able to modulate the<br>
level of light transmission (TL) of the substrate.<br>
According to another important aspect, the functional<br>
layers must be sufficiently durable and, in particular,<br>
physically resistant, such as scratch 'resistant, and<br>
chemically resistant - they must in particular be<br>
moisture resistant. This is all the more important if,<br>
in the glazing once fitted, said functional layers are<br>
on one of the exterior faces of the glazing (as opposed<br>
to the "interior" faces turned towards the intermediate<br>
gas-filled, cavity of for example a double-glazing unit)<br>
or if the glazing is single glazing, i.e. comprising<br>
only a single glass sheet.<br>
There is another constraint that arises during the<br>
production of the glazing: when the latter consists at<br>
least partly of glass substrates, these usually have to<br>
undergo one or more heat treatments, which may be a<br>
bending operation if it is desired to shape them (to<br>
form a shop window), but which is often a toughening or<br>
annea'ling operation, especially in the building sector<br>
in which it is desired for the glazing to be more<br>
resistant and less hazardous in the event of impacts.<br>
The fact that the layers are deposited on the glass<br>
before its heat treatment frequently means that they<br>
are damaged and their properties, especially optical<br>
properties, are substantially modified. However,<br>
depositing the layers after the heat treatment of the<br>
glass proves to be complex and expensive.<br>
An example of solar-protection glazing for buildings is<br>
 <br>
<br>
given in patents EP-0 511 901 and EP-0 678 483: these<br>
refer to functional layers for filtering out solar<br>
radiation which are made of a nickel-chromium alloy,<br>
optionally nitrided, made of stainless steel or of<br>
tantalum, and which are placed between two dielectric<br>
layers of metal oxide such as SnO2, TiO2 or Ta2O5. Such<br>
glazing provides good solar protection, with<br>
satisfactory mechanical and chemical durability, but it<br>
is not truly "bendable" or "toughenable" within the<br>
meaning • described above, since the oxide layers<br>
surrounding the functional layer do not prevent it from<br>
being oxidized during the bending or toughening<br>
operation, said oxidation being accompanied by a<br>
substantial modification in the light transmission and<br>
in the general appearance of the glazing in its<br>
entirety.<br>
More recently Patent Application EP 1 218 307 has<br>
proposed a solar-protection multilayer coating, the<br>
functional layer of which comprises an optionally<br>
nitrided metal chosen from Nb, Ta and Zr, the<br>
functional layer being surmounted by protective layers<br>
based on aluminium, nitride or oxynitride or on silicon<br>
nitride or oxynitride. The multilayer coating according<br>
to . th'is application gives the glazing a solar-<br>
protection function enabling it to block out the solar<br>
IR of the incident solar radiation. Furthermore, this<br>
multilayer coating, proves to be resistant to the<br>
toughening operation and mechanically and chemically<br>
durable sufficiently to be used as face 2 of single<br>
glazing.However, the major drawback of the multilayer<br>
coating described in EP 1 218 307 is that the<br>
functional layer is relatively thick, so as to obtain<br>
the desired solar-protection effect, and consequently<br>
has a very low TL, Of the order of 10%, or even less.<br>
The object of the invention is thus to substantially<br>
increase the light transmission TL of such solar-<br>
protection glazing, without thereby such an increase<br>
 <br>
<br>
leading to an appreciable reduction in the thermal<br>
insulation properties of the glazing, which could<br>
result in excessive heat transfer between the interior<br>
and the exterior of the building or of the passenger<br>
compartment protected by said glazing.<br>
Glazing capable of meeting such an application is known<br>
in the field. Such glazing is coated with one or more<br>
thin functional layers of metallic silver Ag. Such<br>
glazing is for example described in the Patent<br>
Application EP 718 250. It is well known that<br>
incorporating one or more silver layers into the<br>
glazing enables the heat transfer through the glazing<br>
to be very greatly reduced, because of, the low<br>
emissivity of the Ag layers, i.e. their ability to<br>
reflect most of the thermal IR lying between 3 and<br>
50 microns. It is then possible to obtain, using well-<br>
known techniques and especially the addition of<br>
dielectric interference layers of suitable index and<br>
thickness, glazing that has a high light transmission<br>
but the heat transfer coefficient of which nevertheless<br>
remains very low.<br>
The solar-protection layers based on thin silver films<br>
thus appear to be very efficient in respect of thermal<br>
insulation but their mechanical and chemical durability<br>
is very limited, in particular when in contact with a<br>
wet atmosphere, and in particular prevents them from<br>
being used for single glazing. Furthermore, this<br>
solution is relatively expensive to implement in the<br>
case of double glazing.<br>
The invention therefore consists in the development of<br>
novel thin-film multilayer coatings that act on solar<br>
radiation, with a view to manufacturing improved solar-<br>
protection glazing. The intended improvement is in<br>
particular the establishment of a better compromise<br>
between durability, thermal properties, optical<br>
properties and solar-protection function, in particular<br>
 <br>
<br>
light transmission, and capability of withstanding heat<br>
treatment without being damaged when the substrate<br>
bearing the multilayer coating is of the glass type.<br>
'More precisely, the object of the present invention is<br>
therefore to provide glazing coated with thin layers<br>
that give it good solar-protection properties and a<br>
light transmission equal to or greater than 10% or even<br>
20%, but however still having an acceptable heat<br>
transfer coefficient, thanks in particular to a<br>
sufficiently low emissivity coefficient α, as defined<br>
according to the European standard prEN 410, said<br>
multilayer-doated glazing also being able to undergo a<br>
heat treatment as explained above.<br>
According to the- invention, such single or multiple<br>
glazing has been able to be obtained that has in<br>
particular:<br>
a light transmission equal to or greater than<br>
10% or greater than 20%, or even 30% or 40%;<br>
- an emissivity equal to or less than 50%,<br>
preferably,less than 40% or less than 30% or even 20%;<br>
resistance to heat treatment such as a bending<br>
or toughening operation, especially with the above<br>
properties being maintained, and chemical resistance,<br>
as described above; and<br>
 good chemical and mechanical durability.<br>
The subject of the invention thus firstly consists of a<br>
transparent glass substrate comprising at least one<br>
glass sheet provided with a thin-film multilayer<br>
eoating acting on solar radiation, having a light<br>
transmission equal to or greater than 10% or even<br>
greater than 20% and an emissivity equal to or less<br>
than 50%, or less than 40%, or even less than 30% or<br>
20% after a heat treatment, such as a bending or<br>
toughening treatment, said multilayer coating<br>
comprising:<br>
a functional layer based on niobium Nb with a<br>
 <br>
<br>
thickness of between about 5 nm and about 35 nm; and<br>
at least one layer of another material, chosen<br>
from the group formed by Ti, Mo, B, Al or an alloy<br>
comprising at least one of these elements, which is<br>
placed relative to the glass substrate above the<br>
functional . layer, said layer having a thickness of<br>
between about 1 nm and about 5 nm.<br>
According to a possible embodiment, the<br>
transparent glass substrate comprises . at least one<br>
glass sheet provided with a thin-film multilayer<br>
coating acting on solar radiation, having a light<br>
transmission equal to or greater than 20% and an<br>
emissivity equal to or less than 50%. after a heat<br>
treatment, such as a bending or toughening treatment,<br>
said multilayer coating comprising:<br>
a functional layer based on niobium Nb with a<br>
thickness of between about 5 nm and about 25 nm; and<br>
at least one layer of another material, chosen<br>
from the group formed by Ti, Mo, B, Al or an alloy<br>
comprising at least one of these elements, which is<br>
placed relative to the glass substrate above the<br>
functional layer, said layer having a thickness of<br>
between about 1 nm and about 5 nm.<br>
Preferably, a layer of said material chosen from the<br>
group formed by Ti, Mo, B, Al is placed above the<br>
functional layer and another layer of said material is<br>
placed beneath the functional layer.<br>
Typically, the functional layer based on niobium Nb has<br>
a thickness of between 8 nm and about 20 nm, for<br>
example of between 8 nm and 15 nm.<br>
Typically, the layer of material chosen from the group<br>
formed by Ti, Mo, B, Al has a thickness of between<br>
about 1 nm and about 3 nm.<br>
Preferably; said material is Ti.<br>
 <br>
<br>
According to the invention, the combination of the<br>
functional layer and of the layer or layers of said<br>
material is surrounded by at least one additional layer<br>
based on aluminium nitride, aluminium oxynitride,<br>
silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride, or based on a<br>
mixture of at least two of these compounds, the<br>
thickness of said additional layer- or layers being<br>
adju'sted in order to optimize the light transmission of<br>
the glazing.<br>
For example, said additional layer or layers are based<br>
on silicon nitride, and are placed above and below said<br>
combination respectively.<br>
According to one possible embodiment, the layer based<br>
on silicon nitride placed above said combination is<br>
thicker than the layer placed beneath the combination<br>
by at least a factor of 1.2, especially at least a<br>
factor of 1.5 to 1.8.<br>
The invention also relates to monolithic glazing or<br>
double glazing incorporating the substrate as described<br>
above, the multilayer coating of thin layers being<br>
placed on face 2 of the monolithic glazing or of the<br>
double glazing, or on face 3 of the double glazing, the<br>
faces of the substrate or substrates being numbered<br>
from the exterior to the interior of the building or of<br>
the passenger compartment that it equips.<br>
According to one embodiment, the monolithic glazing or<br>
double glazing is configured to have a light<br>
transmission TL of , greater than 10%, 20% or, even 30%,<br>
or even greater than 40%. The monolithic glazing or<br>
double glazing may also be configured to have an<br>
emissivity of less than 40%, or less than 30% or even<br>
less than 20%.<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to a wall<br>
cladding panel of the curtain-walling type,<br>
 <br>
<br>
incorporating at least one substrate as described above<br>
or to a side window, rear window or sunroof for an<br>
automobile, or another vehicle, formed by or<br>
incorporating said substrate.<br>
According to the invention, the functional layers of<br>
the invention make it possible for the substrate to<br>
 have a relatively high light transmission, while still<br>
maintaining an appreciable solar-protection effect,<br>
despite the relatively small thickness of the<br>
functional layer: the measurements made show in fact a<br>
good compromise between the level of light transmission<br>
TL and the heat transfer coefficient U of the<br>
multilayer-coated substrate, as measured by its<br>
emissivity a. In the present description, the<br>
emissivity is a normal emissivity as de'fined according<br>
to the standard prEN 410.<br>
The use of a very thin layer of a metal of the group<br>
Ti, Mo, B, Al, in particular Ti, makes it possible<br>
according to the invention to guarantee the<br>
toughenability of the multilayer coating without an<br>
 accompanying degradation in the functional properties<br>
thereof. In particular, the change in optical<br>
properties, especially the light transmission, caused<br>
by a toughening heat treatment, is low. Likewise, the<br>
emissivity of the functional layer remains low thanks<br>
to the addition of this additional thin metal layer.<br>
According to one possible embodiment of the invention,<br>
the thin layer of metal of the group Ti, Mo, B, Al is<br>
deposited at least on top of the Nb functional layer.<br>
Preferably, said layer is deposited on top of and<br>
beneath the Nb layer.<br>
In the present description, the terms "on top of" and<br>
"beneath" refer to the respective position of said<br>
layers relative to the glass substrate supporting the<br>
multilayer coating comprising said layers.<br>
 <br>
<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
preferable to deposit also an overlayer based on<br>
silicon or aluminium nitride (Si3N4 and A1N) or based on<br>
silicon or aluminium oxynitride (SiON and A1N0 in<br>
short, without judging the respective quantities of Si,<br>
O and N) . The thickness of such layers is adjusted so<br>
as to obtain an antireflection effect enabling the<br>
light transmission of the multilayer-coated glazing to<br>
be optimized. Such layers may also play, to a lesser<br>
extent, a role of protecting the functional layers of<br>
the invention. Without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention, it is also possible according to the<br>
invention to dope these layers with elements such as<br>
Zr, B, etc., so as to modify the colour of the glazing<br>
in transmission and/or in reflection, in accordance<br>
with the well-known techniques in the field.<br>
Preferably, the multilayer coating according to . the<br>
invention comprises, between the substrate and the<br>
functional layer, at least one underlayer made of a<br>
transparent dielectric, especially chosen, as in the<br>
case of. the overlayer, to be silicon nitride or<br>
oxynitride and/or aluminium nitride or oxynitride, or<br>
else; silicon oxide SiO2. In particular, its presence<br>
may make it possible for the optical appearance<br>
conferred on the carrier substrate by its multilayer<br>
coating to be varied more flexibly. Furthermore, in the<br>
case of heat treatment, said underlayer may constitute<br>
an additional barrier, in particular to oxygen and to<br>
alkali metals from the glass substrate, which species<br>
are liable to migrate due to the heat and degrade , the<br>
multilayer coating.<br>
A very preferred variant of the invention may for<br>
example consist in using both an overlayer and an<br>
underlayer based on silicon nitride.<br>
The thickness of the overlayer is preferably between 5<br>
 <br>
and 70 nm, especially between 40 and 60 nm. The<br>
thickness of the optional underlayer is preferably<br>
between 5 and 120 nm.<br>
When there is a single underlayer of the Si3N4 type, its<br>
thickness is for example between 30 and 50 nm.<br>
the underlayer and/or the overlayer may in fact form<br>
part of a superposition of dielectric layers. One or<br>
other layer may thus be combined with other layers of<br>
different refractive indices. Thus, the multilayer<br>
coating may comprise, between the substrate and the<br>
functional layer (or on top of the functional layer) an<br>
alternation of three, high index/low index/high index,<br>
layers, the "high index" layer (having an index of at<br>
least 1.8 to 2) or one of said layers possibly being<br>
the sublayer of the invention of the Si3N4 or A1N type<br>
and the "low index" layer (for example of index less<br>
than 1.7.) possibly being made of silicon oxide SiO2.<br>
More particularly, a very preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention consists of single or multiple glazing<br>
comprising a substrate on which is deposited a<br>
multilayer coating comprising a functional layer based<br>
on niobium with a Ti layer on either side thereof, the<br>
combination of the Ti/Nb/Ti layers itself being<br>
surmounted by an overlayer based on silicon nitride and<br>
by an underlayer also based on silicon nitride.<br>
The subject of the invention applies both to single or<br>
"monolithic" glazing, i.e.. consisting of a single<br>
substrate, and insulating multiple glazing of the<br>
double-glazing type. Preferably, whether in monolithic<br>
glazing or double glazing, the multilayer coatings are<br>
placed on face' 2 (conventionally, the faces of the<br>
panes/substrates of glazing are numbered from the<br>
outside to the inside of the passenger compartment/room<br>
equipped therewith) and protect against solar<br>
radiation. Without departing from the scope of the<br>
 <br>
<br>
invention, the multilayer coatings may also be<br>
deposited on face 3 of double glazing.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a multilayer-coated<br>
substrate at least partially opacified by covering of<br>
the lacquer or enamel type, with the purpose of<br>
producing curtail walling, where the opacifying<br>
covering is in direct contact with the multilayer<br>
coating. The multilayer coating may therefore be<br>
exactly the same both for window glazing and for<br>
curtain walling.<br>
Although the application more particularly intended by<br>
the invention is architectural glazing, it is clear<br>
that other applications can be envisaged, especially<br>
automotive glazing (apart from windscreens, which<br>
require a very high light transmission) , such as the<br>
side windows, sunroof and rear window.<br>
The invention and its advantages will be described in<br>
greater detail below by means of. the following non-<br>
limiting examples according to the invention and<br>
comparative examples. In all the examples and the<br>
description, the thicknesses are geometric thicknesses.<br>
All the substrates are made of clear glass 6 mm in<br>
thickness of the Planilux type sold by Saint-Gobain<br>
Vitrage.<br>
All the layers were deposited in a known manner by<br>
magnetron sputtering. The metal (Nb, Ti) layers were<br>
deposited from metal targets in an inert atmosphere<br>
(100%- Ar) , the silicon nitride Si3N4 layers were<br>
deposited from a suitable silicon target (the silicon<br>
being doped with 8% aluminium by weight) in a reactive<br>
atmosphere containing nitrogen (40% Ar/60% N2) . The<br>
Si3N4 layers therefore contain a little aluminium.<br>
 <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (according to EP 1 218 307)<br>
This example has an Nb functional layer, an Si3N4<br>
underlayer and an Si3N4 overlayer according to the<br>
following sequence:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (10 nm)/Nb' (35 nm)/Si3N4 (30 nm) .<br>
After the layers had been deposited, the substrate<br>
underwent the following heat treatment:<br>
heating at 620°C for 10 minutes followed by<br>
quenching. .<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (comparative example)<br>
In this example, the same functional layer and the<br>
other layers as in Example 1 were used, these being<br>
deposited on the same substrate but with modifications<br>
in the thicknesses of the Si3N4 underlayer and<br>
overlayer:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm)/Nb (10 nm)/Si3N4 (60 nm) .<br>
The substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
underwent the same heat treatment as described in<br>
 Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (according to the invention)<br>
This example uses the same sequence of layers as in<br>
Example- 2, deposited on the same substrate, but with a<br>
very thin metallic titanium layer deposited on top of<br>
the functional layer. The multilayer coating thus<br>
comprises the following succession of layers:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm)/Nb (10 nm)/Ti (about 1 nm)/Si3N4 (60 nm) .<br>
The substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
underwent the same heat treatment as described in<br>
Example 1 or Example 2.<br>
 <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 4 (comparative example)<br>
This example uses the same sequence of layers as in<br>
Example 2, deposited on the same substrate, but a very<br>
thin metallic titanium layer is deposited beneath the<br>
functional layer. The multilayer coating thus comprises<br>
the following succession of layers:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm) /Ti (about 1 nm)/Nb (-10 run) /Si3N4 (60 nm) .<br>
The -substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
undergoes the same heat treatment as described in<br>
Example 1 or 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 (according to the invention)<br>
This example uses the same sequence of layers as in<br>
Example 2, deposited oh the same substrate, but a very<br>
thin titanium metal, layer is deposited on top of and<br>
beneath the functional layer. The multilayer coating<br>
thus comprises the following succession of layers:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm)/Ti (≈ 1 nm) /Nb (10 nm)/Ti (≈ 1 nm)<br>
/Si3N4 (60 nm) .<br>
The substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
underwent . the same heat treatment as described in<br>
'Example 1 or 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 5b (according to the invention)<br>
This example uses the, same sequence of layers as in<br>
Example 2, deposited on the same substrate. The<br>
multilayer coating thus comprises the following<br>
succession of layers.:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm)/Ti (≈ 1 nm)/Nb (19 nm)/Ti (≈ 1 nm)<br>
/Si3N4 (50 nm).<br>
The substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
underwent the same heat treatment as described in<br>
Example 1 or 2.<br>
 <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 6 (comparative example)<br>
This example used the same sequence of layers as in<br>
Example 2, deposited on the same substrate, but a very<br>
thin NiCr layer is deposited on top of and beneath the<br>
functional layer. The multilayer coating thus comprises<br>
the following succession of layers:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm) /NiCr (≈1 nm) /Nb (10 ran) /NiCr (≈1 nm)<br>
/ Si3N4 (60 nm).<br>
The substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
underwent the same heat treatment as described in<br>
Example 1 or 2.<br>
Table 1 below gives the measured optical transmission<br>
TL values (the light transmission being in % under<br>
illuminant D65) and the emissivity a values, which are<br>
calculated according to the prEN 410 and NFEN 673<br>
standards, for Examples 1 to 6 above.<br>
The values are given twice, once before heat treatment<br>
and once after heat treatment. In the table 1, the<br>
relative rise Aa of the emissivity a value, after the<br>
quenching; is reported in percentage.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The values given in Table 1 show that Examples 3, 5. and<br>
5b according to the invention provide a much higher<br>
light transmission than the solar-protection glazing of<br>
the prior art, while still maintaining acceptable<br>
energy performance, after the heat treatment and<br>
toughening operation. The comparison of the emissivity<br>
values obtained after toughening for Example 4 with the<br>
values obtained for Examples 3, 5 and 5b show that the<br>
 best compromises are obtained when a Ti metal layer is<br>
deposited at least on top of the Nb functional layer.<br>
The results obtained for Example 2, which is not<br>
according to the present invention (since the<br>
multilayer coating is not provided with one or more Ti<br>
 <br>
<br>
metal layers), are much inferior after the toughening<br>
operation. These multilayer coatings are clearly not<br>
bend-able/ toughenable within the meaning of the<br>
invention. The heat treatment significantly degrades<br>
the thermal insulation properties: the emissivity<br>
values of such glazing thus appear to be much too high.<br>
The results obtained according to Example 6, in which<br>
the metal layer deposited on the functional layer is<br>
this time made of NiCr, are similar to those obtained<br>
for Example .2, i.e. in the absence of a layer.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 (according to the invention)<br>
For this example, a multiple glazing unit was<br>
constructed from the substrate of Example 5 (after the<br>
toughening operation). The multiple glazing unit was<br>
 assembled according to the conventional techniques in a<br>
6/12/6clear (100% air) configuration, i.e. in such a way<br>
that it is made up of two clear glass sheets 6 mm in<br>
thickness separated by a 12 mm thick air space. The<br>
multilayer coating was deposited on face 2 of the<br>
double glazing unit.<br>
The double glazing unit has a light transmission of 36%<br>
but a relatively low emissivity, about 37%, enabling<br>
most of the thermal IR radiation to be reflected. The<br>
energy insulation performance is thus very<br>
satisfactory, the heat transfer coefficient U having<br>
been measured to be 2.30 W.m-2.K-1. For comparison, the<br>
coefficient U is equal to 2.90 W.m-2.K-1 for a simple,<br>
i.e. not multilayer-coated, double glazing unit. Again<br>
for comparison, the low-E transparent glazing of the<br>
prior art, incorporating as functional layer a not<br>
easily toughenable silver layer, has a coefficient of<br>
around 1.8 W.m-2.K-1, but are very much less, durable,<br>
both in terms of chemical resistance and mechanical<br>
resistance.<br>
 <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 8 (according to the invention)<br>
In this example, the aim was to obtain a multiple<br>
glazing unit based on a substrate in which the layers<br>
of the multilayer coating have thicknesses suitable<br>
this time for maximizing the energy performance of the<br>
glazing.<br>
The . multilayer coating thus comprises the following<br>
succession of layers:<br>
glass/Si3N4 (40 nm) /Ti (≈ 1 nm)/Nb (20 nm) /Ti .(≈ 1 nm)<br>
/Si3N4 (54 nm) .<br>
The substrate coated with the multilayer coating then<br>
underwent the same heat treatment as described above.<br>
A multiple glazing unit was then manufactured from this<br>
substrate. In a manner similar to Example 7, the<br>
multiple glazing unit was assembled in a 6/12/6clear<br>
(100% air) configuration. The multilayer coating was<br>
deposited on face 2 of the double glazing unit.<br>
The double glazing unit thus has a light transmission<br>
of about 20%, lower than that of Example 5, but a much<br>
lower emissivity, about 18%, enabling the thermal<br>
radiation to be strongly reflected, and greatly<br>
improved energy insulation performance, the measured<br>
heat transfer coefficient U this time being equal to<br>
1.98 W.m-2.K-1.<br>
In conclusion, the solar-protection glazing according<br>
to the invention is very advantageous for fitting into<br>
buildings, without being excluded for applications in<br>
cars and all vehicles: namely side windows, rear window<br>
and sunroof, which may also have enamelled coatings.<br>
With a fixed multilayer coating, especially with the<br>
desired TL and thermal insulation values, it is thus<br>
 <br>
possible to manufacture solar-protection glazing<br>
providing' improved vision, but which can be<br>
bent/toughened/annealed, and having very good<br>
mechanical and chemical durability.<br>
Without departing from the scope of the invention, it<br>
is also possible to produce multilayer-coated curtain<br>
walling that is enamelled, rather than lacquered, this<br>
being industrially highly advantageous, enamelling<br>
taking" place during the toughening process whereas<br>
lacquering requires an additional manufacturing step.<br>
