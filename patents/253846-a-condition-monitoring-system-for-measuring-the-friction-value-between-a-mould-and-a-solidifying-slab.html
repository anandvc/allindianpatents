				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to measurement of the friction value between the<br>
mould and the solidifying slab in a process of continuous casting of steel. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a condition monitoring system for<br>
monitoring the friction level including the health of the oscillator in a continuous<br>
steel casting process. The invention further relates to a method of measuring the<br>
friction value between the mold and the solidifying slab in a system during the<br>
process of continuous casting of steel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Continuous casting is a process whereby molten metal is solidified into a<br>
"semifinished product" billet, bloom or slab. Prior to introduction of the<br>
continuous casting process, molten steel used to be poured into stationary<br>
moulds to form "ingots". However, "continuous casting" process achieves<br>
improved yield, quality, productivity and cost efficiency. Presently, continuous<br>
casting is the predominant process by which steel is produced in the world.<br>
In an integrated steel industry continuous casting of steel plays a great role for<br>
the productivity and quality of steel. During continuous casting operation of steel<br>
slab, liquid steel is continuously poured in to a tubular mould at one end and at<br>
the other end the solidified strand is withdrawn. The mould is continuously<br><br>
3<br>
cooled to solidify the steel. The mould is oscillated in a sinusoidal motion, so that<br>
the liquid steel will not stick to the mould. Due to the interaction between the<br>
mould and the steel, friction force between these two arises. Higher friction<br>
value leads to poor surface quality and also indicator of abnormalities like sticker<br>
during casting process. So it is very important to measure the friction value.<br>
In the continuous casting process, illustrated in Figure 1, molten metal is poured<br>
from a ladle (1) into a tundish (2) and then through a submerged entry nozzle<br>
(3) into a mould cavity (4). The mould (4) is water-cooled so that enough heat is<br>
extracted to solidify a shell (5) of sufficient thickness. The shell (5) is withdrawn<br>
from the bottom of the mould (4) at a "casting speed" that matches the inflow of<br>
metal, so that the process ideally operates at steady state. Below the mould (4),<br>
water is sprayed to further extract heat from the strand surface, and the strand<br>
(5) eventually becomes fully solid when it reaches the "'metallurgical length"'.<br>
Solidification begins in the mould (4), and continues through the different zones<br>
(6, 7) of cooling while the strand (5) is continuously withdrawn at the casting<br>
speed. Finally, the solidified strand (5) is straightened, cut, and then discharged<br>
for intermediate storage or hot charged for finished rolling.<br>
To start a cast, the bottom of the mould (4) is sealed by a steel dummy bar (13).<br>
This bar (13) prevents liquid metal from flowing out of the mould (4) and the<br>
solidifying shell (5) until a fully solidified strand section (5) is obtained. The liquid<br><br>
4<br>
poured into the mould (4) is partially solidified in the mould (4), producing a<br>
strand (5) with a solid outer shell and a liquid core. In this primary cooling area<br>
(6), once the steel shell (5) has a sufficient thickness, the partially solidified<br>
strand (5) will be withdrawn out of the mould (4) along with the dummy bar (13)<br>
at the casting speed. Liquid metal continues to pour into the (4) mould to<br>
replenish the withdrawn metal at an equal rate. Upon exiting the mould (4), the<br>
strand (5) enters a roller containment section (14) and a secondary cooling<br>
chamber (7) in which the solidifying strand (5) is sprayed with water, or a<br>
combination of water and air to promote solidification. Once the strand (5) is<br>
fully solidified and has passed through the straightener (14), the dummy bar is<br>
disconnected, removed and stored.<br>
The main function of the mould (4) is to establish a solid shell (5) sufficient in<br>
strength to support its liquid core upon entry into the secondary spray cooling<br>
zone (7). The mould (4) is basically an open-ended box structure, containing a<br>
water-cooled inner lining fabricated from a high purity copper alloy. Mould<br>
oscillation is necessary to minimize friction and sticking of the solidifying shell<br>
(5), and avoid shell tearing, and liquid steel breakouts, which can wreak havoc<br>
on equipment and machine downtime due to clean up and repairs. Friction<br>
between the shell (5) and mould (4) is reduced through the use of mould<br>
lubricants such as oils or powdered fluxes. Oscillation is achieved either<br>
hydraulically or via motor-driven cams or levers which support and reciprocate<br>
(or oscillate) the mould.<br><br>
5<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a condition monitoring<br>
system for monitoring the friction level including the health of an oscillator in a<br>
continuous steel casting process which eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a condition monitoring system for<br>
monitoring the friction level including the health of an oscillator in a continuous<br>
steel casting process which facilitates production of improved surface quality of<br>
the cast steel.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a method of measuring the friction<br>
value between a mould and a solidifying slab including monitoring the machine<br>
parameters in a process of continuous casting of steel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a condition monitoring system for steel slab caster<br>
which adapts multiple sensors for monitoring the friction level, by measuring the<br>
friction between the mould and the solidifying slab including monitoring the<br>
health of the oscillator for any abnormality in operation. This system adapts at<br>
least four numbers of Tri-Axial Accelerometers. Acceleration value is collected in<br>
the X, Y and Z direction using the tri-axial accelerometers which are placed at<br><br>
6<br>
the corners of the continuous casting mould table. The acceleration value is<br>
collected for both casting and no casting conditions adapting a data acquisition<br>
system. A process module is used to do the post processing of data to calculate<br>
the friction and analyze the data collected from the accelerometers for any<br>
abnormality in the machine health.<br>
The difference between the force during casting and force during no casting with<br>
the same frequency of oscillation gives the friction value which appears due to<br>
the interaction between mould and the solidifying strand. FFT of the collected<br>
data is done in the three directions to find if there is any fault in continuous<br>
casting machine that is problem with eccentric cam, worn bearing, non-<br>
sinusoidal nature of oscillation.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
A condition monitoring system for steel slab caster is developed adapting<br>
multiple sensors for monitoring the friction level, which has an improved effect<br>
on slab surface quality. This system can simultaneously measure the friction<br>
between the mould (4) and the solidifying slab (5) including monitoring the<br>
health of the oscillator (4) for to identify abnormality during the operation. This<br>
system adapts four numbers of Tri-Axial Accelerometers (9). Acceleration value is<br>
collected in the X, Y and Z direction using the tri-axial accelerometers (9) which<br>
are placed at the four corners of the continuous casting mould table (8). The<br>
acceleration value is collected for both casting and no casting conditions of the<br>
oscillator (4) using a data acquisition device (10). A process module is used for<br>
post processing of data in a computer apparatus (11) connected to a power<br>
source (12), to calculate the friction value and analyze the data collected from<br>
accelerometers (9) for any abnormality in the machine health.<br>
The inventive concept leading to the present invention constitutes that a<br>
difference between the force during casting and the force during no casting with<br>
the same frequency of oscillation gives the friction value which occurs due to the<br>
interaction between the mould (4) and the solidifying strand (5). A FFT of the<br>
collected data is carried-out in the 3 directions to find out if there is any defect in<br>
the continuous casting machine for example problem with eccentric cam, worn of<br>
bearing, non-sinusoidal nature of oscillation.<br><br>
8<br>
The new system is capable to measure the friction between the mould (4) and<br>
the solidifying strand (5) efficiently. This will help in evaluating the performance<br>
of different kind of lubricants based on the friction value obtained for them<br>
during casting. This system also will help in monitoring any abnormal behaviour<br>
of the casting machine.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the simplest model of an accelerometer is a mass-spring-<br>
damper device (9) that is attached to an enclosing casing (4). The applied<br>
acceleration of the casing causes the mass to move, and this motion can be used<br>
to determine the magnitude of the acceleration. Due to the movement of the<br>
mass the mechanical energy is converted into electrical signal from which the<br>
acceleration is calculated. In a tri-axial accelerometer device at least, 3 no of<br>
accelerometers are placed in the 3-axis of the space coordinate which can<br>
calculate acceleration in 3 directions.<br>
The specification of the accelerometers used for this system is given as under:<br><br>
Parameter	Min          Max	Units<br>
Range	-2              +2	g<br>
Operating Temp Range	-40           +85	°c<br>
Bandwidth	10	kHz<br><br>
9<br>
Figure 4 describes the steps carried out by the process module embedded in the<br>
computer apparatus (11).<br>
Step 1: Acceleration data is read from the accelerometer (9) online<br>
Casting speed data is read from operating table online<br>
Matching the casting speed with the cold force data is read from COLD FORCE<br>
(the force exerted with empty mould) look up table<br>
Step 2: Oscillation frequency is calculated from the casting speed by multiplying<br>
a constant A<br>
Step 3: Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis of the acceleration data is<br>
done and the Amplitude vs frequency plot is displayed<br>
Step 4: Angular velocity (GO) is calculated from the frequency of oscillation as<br>
Angular Velocity (ω) = 2nf<br>
Step 5: Displacement (d) of the mould table (8) is calculated as<br>
Displacement (d) = -a/ω2<br><br>
10<br>
The displacement of mould with time is displayed<br>
Step 6: HOT FORCE or the force on caster during casting is calculated by taking<br>
the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of the acceleration.<br>
Step 7: The friction value is calculated for the current casting speed by<br>
subtracting the COLD FORCE from HOT FORCE and the friction with time is<br>
displayed.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION:<br>
1.	On-line monitoring of mould oscillation is an important tool for the<br>
performance of casting and also improving machine reliability.<br>
2.	Various parameters can be optimized using this system to lower the<br>
