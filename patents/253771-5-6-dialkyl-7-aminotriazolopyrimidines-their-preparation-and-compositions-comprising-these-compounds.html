				<td>compositions comprising them and methods for controlling harmful fungi using the<br>
compounds I.<br>
The compounds of the formula I differ from those in the abovementioned publications<br>
by the specific embodiment of the substituent in the 6-position of the triazolopyrimidine<br>
skeleton, which is a haloalkyl group or an unsaturated aliphatic group.<br>
Compared to the known compounds, the compounds of the formula I are more<br>
effective against harmful fungi.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be obtained by different routes.<br>
Advantageously, the compounds according to the invention are obtained by converting<br>
substituted (3-ketoesters of the formula II with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole of the formula III to<br>
give 7-hydroxytriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV. The groups R1 and R2 in formulae<br>
II and IV are as defined for formula I and the group R in formula II is C1-C4-alkyl; for<br>
practical reasons, preference is given here to methyl, ethyl or propyl.<br><br>
The reaction of the substituted p-ketoesters of the formula II with the aminoazoles of<br>
the formula III can be carried out in the presence or absence of solvents. It is<br>
advantageous to use solvents to which the starting materials are substantially inert and<br>
in which they are completely or partially soluble. Suitable solvents are in particular<br>
alcohols, such as ethanol, propanols, butanols, glycols or glycol monoethers,<br>
diethylene glycols or their monoethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene,<br>
benzene or mesitylene, amides, such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide,<br>
dibutylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, lower alkanoic acids, such as formic acid,<br>
acetic acid, propionic acid, or bases, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxides, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides, alkali metal and alkaline earth<br>
metal hydrides, alkali metal amides, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates<br>
and also alkali metal bicarbonates, organometallic compounds, in particular alkali metal<br>
alkyls, alkylmagnesium halides and also alkali metal and alkaline earth metal alkoxides<br>
and dimethoxymagnesium, moreover organic bases, for example tertiary amines, such<br>
as trimethylamine, triethylamine, triisopropylethylamine, tributylamine and N-<br>
methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, substituted pyridines, such as<br>
collidine, lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and also bicyclic amines and mixtures<br>
of these solvents with water. Suitable catalysts are bases, such as those mentioned<br>
above, or acids, such as sulfonic acids or mineral acids. With particular preference, the<br>
reaction is carried out in the absence of a solvent or in chlorobenzene, xylene, dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide or N-methylpyrrolidone. Particularly preferred bases are tertiary amines, such<br><br>
as triisopropylamine, tributylamine, N-methylmorpho!ine or N-methylpiperidine. The<br>
temperatures are from 50 to 300°C, preferably from 50 to 180°C, if the reaction is<br>
carried out in solution [cf. EP-A 770 615; Adv. Het. Chem. 57 (1993), 81ffj.<br>
The bases are generally employed in catalytic amounts; however, they can also be<br>
employed in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvent.<br><br>
In most cases, the resulting condensates of the formula IV precipitate from the reaction<br>
solutions in pure form and, after washing with the same solvent or with water and<br>
subsequent drying they are reacted with halogenating agents, in particular chlorinating<br>
or brominating agents, to give the compounds of the formula V in which Hal is chlorine<br>
or bromine, in particular chlorine. The reaction is preferably carried out using<br>
chlorinating agents such as phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride or sulfuvyl<br>
chloride at from 50*0 to 150°C, preferably in excess phosphorus oxytrichloride at reflux<br>
temperature. After evaporation of excess phosphorus oxytrichloride, the residue is<br>
treated with ice-water, if appropriate with addition of a water-immiscible solvent. In<br>
most cases, the chlorinated product isolated from the dried organic phase, if<br>
appropriate after evaporation of the inert solvent, is very pure and is subsequently<br>
reacted with ammonia in inert solvents at from 100°C to 200°C to give the 7-amino-<br>
triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines. This reaction is preferably carried out using a 1- to 10-molar<br>
excess of ammonia, under a pressure of from 1 to 100 bar.<br>
The novel 7-aminoazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines are, if appropriate after evaporation of the<br>
solvent, isolated as crystalline compounds, by digestion in water.<br>
The β-ketoesters of the formula II can be prepared as described in Organic Synthesis<br>
Coll. Vol. 1, p. 248, and/or they are commercially available.<br>
Alternatively, the novel compounds of the formula I can be obtained by reacting<br>
substituted acyl cyanides of the formula VI in which R1 and R2 are as defined above<br>
with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole of the formula III.<br><br>
The reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of solvents. It is<br>
advantageous to use solvents to which the starting materials are substantially inert and<br>
in which they are completely or partially soluble. Suitable solvents are in particular<br>
alcohols, such as ethanol, propanols, butanols, glycols or glycol monoethers,<br>
diethylene glycols or their monoethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene,<br><br>
benzene or mesitylene, amides, such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide,<br>
dibutylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, lower alkanoic acids, such as formic acid,<br>
acetic acid, propionic acid, or bases, such as those mentioned above, and mixtures of<br>
these solvents with water. The reaction temperatures are from 50 to 300°C, preferably<br>
from 50 to 150°C, if the reaction is carried out in solution.<br>
Some of the substituted alky! cyanides of the formula VI required for preparing the<br>
7-aminoazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines are known, or they can be prepared by known methods<br>
from alkyl cyanides and carboxylic acid esters using strong bases, for example alkali<br>
metal hydrides, alkali metal alcoholates, alkali metal amides or metal alkyls (cf.: J.<br>
Amer. Chem. Soc. 73, (1951), p. 3766).<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R1 is C2-C12-haloalkenyl or C2-C12-haloalkynyl can<br>
be obtained advantageously by halogenating corresponding triazolopyrimidines of the<br>
formula VII:<br><br>
In the formula VII, R is C2-C12-alkenyl, C2-C12-alkynyl. where the carbon chains may<br>
carry one to three groups R3.<br>
The halogenation is usually carried out at temperatures of from 0°C to 200°C,<br>
preferably from 20°C to 110°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a free-<br>
radical initiator (for example dibenzoyl peroxide or azobisisobutyronitrile or under UV<br>
irradiation, for example with an Hg vapor lamp) or an acid [cf. Synthetic Reagents,<br>
volume 2, pp. 1-63, Wiley, New York (1974)].<br>
The reaction partners are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In<br>
terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an excess of halogenating agent,<br>
based on VII.<br>
Suitable halogenating agents are, for example, elemental halogens (for example Cl2,<br>
Br2, b), N-bromosuccinimide, N-chlorosuccinimide or dibromodimethylhydrantoin. The<br>
halogenating agents are generally employed in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if<br>
appropriate, as solvent.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the formula I, in which R1 is C2-C12-haloalkenyl or C2-C12-<br>
haloalkynyl can be obtained by ether cleavage of corresponding triazoiopyrimidines of<br>
the formula VIla:<br><br>
The present invention relates to 5,6-dialkyl-7-aminotriazolopyrimidines of the formula I<br><br>
in which the substituents are as defined below:<br>
R1 is C2-C12-alkenyl or C2-C12-alkynyl, where the carbon chains are unsubstituted or<br>
carry one to three identical or different groups Ra and/or Rb;<br>
Ra is halogen, cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, C1-C6-alkyithio, C3-C12-alkenyloxy and<br>
C3-C12-alkynyloxy,<br>
Rb is C1-C4-alkyl, cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-alkylthio, C3-<br>
C6-alkenyloxy and C3-C6-alkynyloxy<br>
where the carbon chains of the groups Ra for their part may be<br>
halogenated;<br>
R2 is C1-C12-alkyl, C2-C12-alkenyl or C2-C12-alkynyl, where the carbon chains may be<br>
substituted by one to three groups Rc:<br>
Rc is cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, NR11R12; or C3-C6-cycIoalkyl which may carry one<br>
to four identical or different groups C1-C4-alkyl, halogen, cyano, nitro,<br>
hydroxyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-alkylthio, C3-Cs-alkenyloxy or C3-C5-<br>
alkynyloxy<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes for preparing these compounds, to<br>
compositions comprising them and to their use for controlling phytopathogenic harmful<br>
fungi.<br>
5,6-Dialkyl-7-aminotriazolopyrimidines are proposed in a general manner in<br>
GB 1 148 629. Individual fungicidally active 5,6-dialkyl-7-aminotriazolopyrimidines are<br>
known from EP-A 141 317. However, in many cases their activity is unsatisfactory.<br>
Based on this, it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds having<br>
improved activity and/or a wider activity spectrum.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the definitions defined at the outset.<br>
Furthermore, we have found processes and intermediates for their preparation,<br><br><br>
In the formula VIla, RA is C1-C14-alkyl, C2-C12-alkenyl or C2-C12-alkynyl, where the<br>
groups RA are substituted by hydroxyl or alkoxycarbonyl groups. By heating the<br>
compounds VIla in the presence of mineral acids [HX], such as hydrochloric acid or<br>
hydrobromic acid, or nitric acid, the compounds I are obtained [cf. Organikum, 15th<br>
edition, p. 237 ff., VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1981].<br>
Some of the triazolopyrimidines of the formulae VII and Vila required for preparing the<br>
compounds I described above are known, or they can be prepared by known methods<br>
[cf. EP-A 141 317].<br>
If individual compounds I can not be obtained by the routes described above, they can<br>
be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.<br>
If the synthesis yields mixtures of isomers, a separation is generally not necessarily<br>
required since in some cases the individual isomers can be interconverted during work-<br>
up for use or during application (for example under the action of light, acids or bases).<br>
Such conversions may also take place after use, for example during the treatment of<br>
plants within the treated plants, or in the harmful fungus to be controlled.<br>

generally representative of the following substituents:<br>

preference is given to the following meanings of the substituents, in each case on their<br>
own or in combination:<br>
Preference is given to compounds I in which the group R1 has at most 9 carbon atoms.<br>
Likewise, preference is given to compounds of the formula I in which R1 is a straight-<br>
chain or mono-, di-, tri- or polybranched haloalkyl group.<br>
If R1 is haloalkyl, the halogenation is preferably at the terminal carbon. Preference is<br>
given to monohaloalky! groups.<br>

The compounds I are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by an outstanding<br>
effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, especially from the<br>
classes of the Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Oomycetes and Basidiomycetes, in<br>
particular from the class of the Oomycetes. Some are systemically effective and they<br>
can be used in plant protection as foliar fungicides, as fungicides for seed dressing and<br>
soil fungicides.<br>
They are particularly important in the control of a multitude of fungi on various<br>
cultivated plants, such as wheat, rye. barley, oats, rice, corn, grass, bananas, cotton,<br>
soya, coffee, sugar cane, vines, fruits and ornamental plants, and vegetables, such as<br>

variotii, in the protection of materials (e.g. wood, paper, paint dispersions, fibers or<br>
fabrics) and in the protection of stored products.<br>
The compounds I are employed by treating the fungi or the plants, seeds, materials or<br>
soil to be protected from fungal attack with a fungicidally effective amount of the active<br>
compounds. The application can be carried out both before and after the infection of<br>
the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>

In seed treatment, amounts of active compound of 1 to 1000 g/100 kg, preferably 5 to<br>
100 g/100 kg of seed are generally required.<br>
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active<br>
compound applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect.<br>
Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, for example, 0.001 g to<br>
2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active compound per cubic meter of treated<br>
material.<br>
The compounds I can be converted into the customary formulations, for example<br>
solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The<br><br>
application form depends on the particular purpose; in each case, it should ensure a<br>
fine and uniform distribution of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by extending the active<br>

with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each<br>
case 5%). This mixture is introduced into water by means of an emulsifying machine<br>
(Ultraturrax) and made into a homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an<br>
emulsion.<br>
E Suspensions (SC, OD)<br>
In an agitated ball mill, 20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are<br>
comminuted with addition of dispersants, wetters and water or an organic solvent to<br>

forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable<br>
products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended<br>
purposes; the intention is to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the<br>
active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance,<br>
wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such<br><br>
concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from<br>
0.01 to 1%.<br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br>
(ULV), by which it is possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of<br>
active compound, or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or<br>
bactericides may be added to the active compounds, if appropriate not until<br>
immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the agents<br>
according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can, in the use form as fungicides, also be<br>
present together with other active compounds, e.g. with herbicides, insecticides, growth<br>
regulators, fungicides or else with fertilizers. Mixing the compounds I or the<br>
compositions comprising them in the application form as fungicides with other<br>
fungicides results in many cases in an expansion of the fungicidal spectrum of activity<br>
being obtained.<br>

undersides of the leaves were inoculated with an aqueous sporangia suspension of<br>
Plasmopara viticola. The vines were then initially placed in a water-vapor-saturated<br><br>
chamber at 24°C for 48 hours and then in a greenhouse at temperatures between 20<br>
and 30°C for 5 days. After this time, the plants were once more placed in a humid<br>
chamber for 16 hours to promote the eruption of sporangiophores. The extent of the<br>
development of the infection on the undersides of the leaves was then determined<br>
visually.<br>
