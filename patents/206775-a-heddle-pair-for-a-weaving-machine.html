The present invention concerns paired heddjes for the production of thickened warp in woven fabrics.<br>
The invention concerns heddles which are installed in pairs, in order that weaving with a heavy warp is made possible. With a single heddle pair, respectively, one of the two heddles is so shaped, that the thread-eye is positioned in a rear row, and the second heddle is so shaped, that the thread-eye positions itself in a forward row. By the offset of the thread-eyes, out of the theoretical center of the shaft plane, the goal is attained that the passage for the warp, even at the broadest part of the heddle, that is, in the area of the thread-eye, is substantially increased.<br>
Such heddles, on their own, are very well known in practice and are correspondingly here displayed in Figs. 1, 2 and 9, regarding which figures, more will be explained in the following.<br>
Weaving machines today reach very high speeds of rotation, which have the result, that the loom shafts severely deform in operation because of the high dynamic loadings. This deformation reaches a degree, that the play, with which the heddles can arrange themselves orderly in a row on the heddle carrier rails of the loom shafts, disappears, and, indeed, is overstepped. The overstepping of the heddle play, brings about the result, that the heddles are stressed tension-wise. Heddles of modern design, which, constructively, principally have been conceived from the standpoint of symmetry, take on a shape, which, at least partially, is not appropriate for such structural loadings. Those heddles designated by the numbers 1, 8,32 and 34 exhibit a high degree of rigidity, as compared with heddles with the designation 2 and 9. The result of this is, that the heddles carrying the numbers 1, 8,32 and 34 very quickly tend to pull apart under tension.<br>
With consideration given to the above disadvantages, the purpose of the invention, thus, is to create a heddle, that is a pair of heddles, which, for both types of the heddle pairs can bring about a similar tensile strength, that is, a like modulus of elasticity. In achieving this purpose, care must be<br><br><br>
In accord with the invention, the said purpose thereof will be achieved in accord with statements especially found in Claim 1 of the present patent.<br>
In accord with the invention, the goal of achieving its purpose is reached, in that the area lying adjacent to the end-eyes of both heddles of the pair, which area is relatively rigid as to extension, is made spring-like resilient specifically by the shaping of the area between the end-eye and the main elongation of the heddle.<br>
What is proposed is, that each of the two heddles on that side, which runs between the thread-eye and the end-eye, the nearer it approaches the end-eye, or enters the area of the end-eye, advantageously, exhibits a change in shape such as a recess or an inwardly bowed section, and/or, besides this, the end-eye is designed to be open.<br>
In accord with a preferred embodied variant, is at least one of the two heddles, or both heddles, in the area respectively adjacent to the end-eye, an in the direction of the thread-eye, exhibits a bowing which imparts a spring-like characteristic to said area.<br>
Advantageous variants of embodiments of the heddles to be used pair-wise, are characterized in the subordinate claims.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the accompanying Figures, There is shown in:<br>
Figs. 1 and 2	each, a pair of heddles in accord with the state of the technology,<br>
Figs. 3 and 4	each, a pair of heddles made in accord with the invention,<br><br>
Figs. 5 to 3	each, a heddle, in accord with the invention, provided for application<br>
in pair-wise arranged heddles,<br>
Fig. 9	a further heddle pair, designed in accord with the state of the technology,<br>
Fig. 10	a heddle pair, constructed in accord with the invention, and<br>
Fig. 11	a single heddle, adaptable to be applied in a heddle pair<br>
built in accord with the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a heddle pair in accord with the state of the technology, showing the two heddles 1 and 2 with the two, centrally located and offset thread-eyes 4 and 6. Further to be seen are respectively a row hole 17 as well as stampings 18^1 &gt;pvhich are likewise known from the state of the technology. Analogously, Fig. 2 shows further a neddle pair in accord with the state of the technology, comprising heddles 8 and 9 with the thread-eyes placed midway between the ends. In operation, the heddle pairs, in accord with Figs. 1 and 2, have now made evident, that respectively the heddles 1 and 8, which exhibit a high rigidity where elongation is concerned, have a tendency toward rupturing, while other heddles, notably 2 and 9, respectively of the two pair, remain undamaged under severe loadings.<br>
The reason for this difference in operational behavior could very well be attributed to the fact that the two heddles, 2 and 9, in the area between the end-eyes and the extended intervening body of the heddle, exhibit a more resilience than do the two heddles, respectively, 1 and 8.<br>
On this basis, it is proposed, in accord with the invention, and as likewise shown in the Figs. 3 and 4, that respectively the two heddles of the heddle pair, are designed to be resilient in a spring-like way between the end-eyes and the central length of the heddle. This condition is achieved, as shown in Fig. 3, in the heddle 23, in that the recesses 11,1V are provided, similarly in Fig. 4, and in the heddle 28 the corresponding recesses are 14,14*. As previously mentioned and in accord with the invention, these recesses, namely 11,1T and 14,14', run from that side of the heddle which neihborsthe thread-eye 4.<br><br>
Analogous recesses are constructed on each of the two other heddles, 22 and 19, in that same area between the end-eyes and the extended intervening body of the heddle, where, in this case, the matter lies with the heddle 22 regarding the bowed sections 11" and 11'", in the case of the heddle 19, regarding the bowed sections 14" and 14"\ In other words, also these two heddles possess recesses in that same side, which runs on in proximity to the thread-eye 6. Thereby, the said spring-like resilience is imparted again to these two heddles 22 and 19 in the area between the end-eye and the elongated section of the heddle.<br>
In the Figs. 5 to 8, additional variants of heddles are presented, wherein respectively, always only one heddle of the pair is illustrated, since these can be dispensed with, in respect to the explanations regarding heddle presentations in Fig. 1 to 4 showing the heddle 2 to 9, as well as 22 and 19, because these heddles remain undamaged under high loads under any circumstances.   Ail heddles illustrated in Figs. 5 to 8, have the common characteristic, that that in every case, in the area between the end-eyes and the elongated section of the heddle, recesses, i.e. inwardly bowed sections are present, these being 12,12!, 13,13', 15,15' as well as 16,16\ which bow in from the same side of the heddle which runs in proximity to the thread-eye 4. The heddles shown in the Figs. 5 to 8, these being heddles 24,25,29 and 30 can now be combined with other heddles, for instance, 2 to 9 respectively, in order to make up a pair. In doing this, it is obvious, that for the combining into a pair, also another design of heddle can be used, which, more or less, analogously corresponds to the four shown in Figs. 5 to 8. It is in keeping with the invention, if both heddles of the heddle-pair are spring-like resilient or flexible in that area between the end-eyes and the elongated section of the heddle, in order to prevent damage at operations at a high load.<br>
While the heddles shown in the presentation of the Figs. 1 to 8, indicate end-eyes open on one side, the end-eyes of the illustrated heddles in Figs. 9 to 11 are closed. Thus, Fig. 9 shows a heddle pair 32, 34, each with closed end-eyes 36. Once again, the thread-eyes,<br>
41, 6' located in the middle of the heddle, are positioned offset to one another. Contrary to the heddle pair, which is which is depicted in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, both heddles here exhibit a high elongation rigidity, so that, upon a high loading, both heddles fracture under load.<br><br>
Accordingly, both heddles of the heddle-pair are to be modified to be in accord with the invention, as, for instance, is depicted in Fig. 10. The two heddles 38 and 40, with the middle located thread-eyes 4' and 6', both indicate in the areas approaching the end-eyes 36, respective recesses, i.e. inward bowed sections 37, 37' and 39,39* respectively, which bowing, once again, is made from that side in the heddle which is proximal to the respective thread-eyes 4' and 6'. Thereby, there arises, anew, the spring-like resiliency demanded by the invention between the end-eyes and the elongated part of the heddle.<br>
Fig. 11 finally shows a further variant of design of a heddle 42, possessing the recesses 43 and 43', respectively. In this figure, the second heddle for forming a pair is omitted, since principally, that heddle can be depicted as a mirror image pair partner.<br>
The recesses shown in Figs. 3 to 8, namely recesses similar to 10 and 11, bring about respectively heddles, which in the given area are substantially more resilient, a fact which reduces the tensions in the material to a level which can reliably prevent fracturing. Heddles, which do not possess a row hole 17, especially as shown in Figs. 1, 2, (which do) can, within the framework of the invention, obtain a shape with the same effect as those shown in accord with the recesses in Figs 5 to 8 where the recesses 12,13,15 and 16 , respectively, 12', 13', 15' and 16* can be seen. The effect in regard to an improvement of the resiliency of these heddles is the same, however, the shaping of these heddles is somewhat simplified on the grounds of other requirements.<br>
In the case of a heddle, which does not require the stamping 18, which is required in order to be used on the entry machine, as is shown in the Figs. 1 to 4, a shape in agreement with the Figs. 6 or 8 may be chosen, in which the recesses 13 or 13', and 16 or 161 impart to the heddle a certain ideal form.<br>
Obviously, the shaping of heddles in accord with the invention as proposed, is transferable to any kind of a heddle intended for a paired installation. This means, that all heddles lie within the limits of the invention, such as:<br>
- heddles showing distortion, which separates the heddles from one another,<br><br>
-	heddles with easily twisted thread-eyes,<br>
-	heddles which, in the area of the end-eyes, show squeezing, or<br>
-	heddles in which the end-eyes demonstrate by compression a greater breadth than the breadth of the heddle itself, etc.<br>
Further, the present invention is not limited to the examples shown in Figs. 1 to 11, but the invention encompasses fundamentally every kind of heddle to be used in paired arrangement and which are designed in accord with the invention<br><br>

Summary<br>
Heddles, intended for paired operation, are designed to be spring-like resilient in the area adjacent to the end-eyes (4, 6), in order to prevent breakage of the said heddles in operation by the high degree of dynamic loading. This spring-like resiliency is achieved, in that the heddle is so designed, that proximal to the end-eyes, or in the area thereof, a shape-change (14,14\ 14", 14'") such as a recess or an inwardly bowed section exists.<br></td>
