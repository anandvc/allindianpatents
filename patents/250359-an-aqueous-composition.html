				<td>AQUEOUS POLYMER DISPERSIONS WITH HIGH IJNSA 1 URATED FLOW PROMOTER CONTENT<br>
This invention relates to aqueous dispersions comprising polymer particles and flow promoters containing unsatuniled carbon-carbon bonds, as well as methods for making the dispersions. More particularly, high levels of the flow promoters are present in the polymer particles of the inventive dispersion. The dispersions are useful in a variety of coating applications.<br>
Unsaturated oils, such as the drying and semi-drying oils, have long been used in coatings due to their capacity to undergo "cure" reactions upon exposure to oxygen. While the oxidative cure behavior of these oils can contribute to desirable coatings performance properties, such as the development of film hardness, coatings based on these oils suffer from certain other limitations, most notably durability. By contrast, coatings based on aqueous dispersions of polymers formed from ethylenically unsaturated monomers can achieve superior durability, but in many applications other performance characteristics of such systems can benefit Irom the presence of materials that cure after the coating has been applied to a substrate. As a result of these complementary performance profiles there have been many efforts to combine the desirable performance attributes of curing oils, and their derivatives with aqueous dispersion polymers.<br>
U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0039095A1 discloses a film-forming composition comprising a continuous aqueous phase and a dispersed phase. The dispersed phase comprises (i) a particulate polymer or emulsified liquid prepolymer, and (ii) a coalescent aid comprising an ester having the formula RCOOX wherein R and X are independently hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl and at least one of R and X comprises at least two Linsaturaled carbon-carbon bonds.<br>
With this invention, we provide aqueous compositions comprising disperse polymer particles and high levels of unsaturated flow promoters that offer enhanced performance, particularly in coatings for porous or weathered substrates. Further, we discovered a process by which such compositions can be formed.<br>
One aspect of this invention is an aqueous composition comprising from 5 to 60% by weight dispersed particles, the particles comprising: (1) at least one copolymer A; and (2) Irom about 15 to 100% by weight, based on the weight of the copolymer, of at least one unsaturated flow promoter with a segmental polarity difference of no greater than 8 relative to the polymer; wherein copolymer A is formed by the polymerization of at least one ethylenically unsaturaled nonionic monomer and at least one monomer bearing a pendant<br><br>
functionality which can react with the unsaturated flow promoter upon drying and exposure to oxygen, wherein from about 75 to 100% by weight of the copolymer has a Mw of from about 1.000 to 100,000.<br>
One embodiment of this invention is where from about 5 to 100% by weight of the copolymer has a Mn of from 1,000 to 40,000.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is where the eopolymer comprises from 0.5 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of copolymer, at least one copolymerized monomer bearing pendant functionality which reacts with unsaturated flow promoter upon drying and exposure to oxygen.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is where the composition comprises from 0.1 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of unsaturated flow promoter, of at least one macromolecular organic compound having a hydrophobia cavity.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is where composition comprises from 0.1 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of unsaturated flow promoter, of at least one macromolecular organic compound having a hydrophobia eavity.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is where the pendant functionality is acetoacetale.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is where the composition further comprises at least one auto oxidation catalyst<br>
A second aspect of this invention is a composition, comprising:<br>
(a)	an aqueous dispersion of polymer particles, said particles comprising from<br>
75 to 100% by weight, based on the total weight of polymer, polymer having Mw of from<br>
I,QUO to 100,000;<br>
(b)	from I 5 to 100% by weight, based on the weight of said polymer, at least<br>
one unsaturated flow promoter, and<br>
(c)	from 0.1 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of flow promoter, at<br>
least one macromolecular organic compound having a hydrophobic cavity.<br>
One embodiment of this second aspect is where a, b, and c are maintained at a temperature of from 40 to W C for at least 15 minutes.<br>
A challenge in prnleclmg many porous or weathered substrates with sealants or coalings is achieving an adequate degree of penetration of protective components into the substrate. In (he absence of good penetration, a protective composition after it dries may fail to adhere to the substrate and/or to limit the penetration of moisture into the substrate. The aqueous dispersions of this invention are capable of penetrating deeply into porous substrates<br>
and providing superior substrate protection from moisture's harmful effects. It is a further benefit ol the dispersions of this invention that these objectives can be achieved in an environmentally friendly lashion.<br>
We were trying to find ways to overcome the problems of latex polymer flow into porous substrates such as wood and masonry to achieve acceptable coatings on such substrates. Normally, when aqueous coating formulations containing latex particles are applied to such substrates, the water carrier rapidly leaves the surface coating by either by evaporation or absorption into the channels of the substrate, or both. When the water rapidly leaves a latex coating, the latex particles coagulate form plugs of polymer that have very limited flow. With limited flow, the particles are unable to penetrate deep into the porous channels due to clogging at the substrate surface.   The result is a coating that has low durability.<br>
With this invention, we can add a high level of an unsaturated flow promoter that can be dissolved in the latex particles, thus capable of acting as a solvent for the polymer, decreasing the viscosity of the polymer to such a point as flow into substrate channels is achieved even as the water is rapidly leaving the coating. In this invention, after the flow promoter has facilitated polymer flow into the substrate, it then acts as a crosslmking agent for the polymer due to the unsaturation present in the flow promoter. Without this curing reaction, the low viscosity and low molecular weight of the polymer solution would leave a coating too tacky and insufficiently durable to be useful as a protective coating for wood or masonry.<br>
The term "pendant" means "attached to the polymer backbone and available for further reaction." The term "pendant" also includes attachment of such groups at the termini of a polymer chain.<br>
"Nonionic monomer" means that the copolymeri/ed monomer residue does not bear an ionic charge between pH=l-14.<br>
"(Meth)acrylic" denotes both the methacrylic and acrylic monomers described.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the term "Mn" refers to the number average molecular weight as determined by st/e exclusion chromatography ("SEC") using polystyrene narrow standard calibration such as lor example, HasiCal PS-2TM polystyrene standards supplied by Polymer Laboratories.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the term "Mw" refers to the weight average molecular weight as determined by SLC using polystyrene narrow standard calibration such as for example, EasiCal PS-2TM polystyrene standards supplied by Polymer Laboratories.<br>
"Tg" means the glass transition temperature determined by differential scanning ealorimetry ("DSC") using a heating rate of 10° C / minute, taking the mid-point in the heat How versus temperature transition as the Tg value.<br>
A volatile organic compound ("VOC") is an organic compound that has a boiling point below 28()°C at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the term "particle size" refers to the number average particle diameter as determined using a capillary hydrodynamic fractionation apparatus, such as the Matec CHDF-2000 apparatus (Matec Applied Sciences, MA) with ultraviolet detection at 200 nm. Particle size standards are provided by National Institute of Standards and Technology ("MIST") traceable polystyrene standards of 50 to 800 nm.<br>
Flow promoters suitable to the invention have a segmental polarity difference of no greater than 8 relative to the polymer. The segmental polarities (SP) were calculated as follows:<br>
MolVol<br>
Here, logm(K()l| wa,cr ) is the so-called log P value and MolVol is the molecular volume for the compound being studied. I -'or a compound M, K()j|.water is the ratio of the M concentrations in 1 octanol and in water<br>
Logio(K.0ji.W;,ter) was calculated using the KOWWIN program which is available, from among other places, from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website: http://www.cpa.gov/opptintr/exposurc/docs/episuitc.htm<br>
KOWIN is also the subject of a number of scientic papers, e.g., Benfenati et al., "Predicting logP of Pesticides Using Different Software, Chemosphere (2003), 53(9),  1155-64.<br>
KOWWIN calculates logm(K0,i water) as a sum of contributions from molecular fragments:ivioivol is calculated using the method described in Zhao, Y. H.; et al.,. .7. Org. Chem. 2003, 6,S\ 7368-7373<br>
The physical rationale tor using the scgmental polarity in this way is that Flory-Huggins theory and its derivatives show that the free energy of mixing of molecules with very different si/cs is better predicted by using the volume fractions (aka segment concentrations) of each species rather than the mole fractions of each. For a recent discussion, see Fornasiero, Fet al.. Macrotnolecules 2005, 38, 1364-1370<br>
Knii water for compound M is related to the free energies of M-octanol and M-water mixing. But K0|1 -water is expressed in terms of molar concentrations. We can put Koii water onto a segmcntal basis by dividing by the molecular volume, as is done in eq. 1.<br>
Shown below are two detailed examples for computing segmental polarity, one for a flow promoter and one for a polymer.<br>
A.  Flow Promoter: (in this example, a mono-ester with one unsaturation)<br>
I.         Start the KOWWIN program. Filter the SMILHS notation for the compound:<br>
rCCrCCCCX:=CCCCCC( '(XX:(=O)OCC(O)C      SMILES is an established notation for describing molecular structure.  A description, with enough guidelines to write a SMILES for almost any compound, was published in Weiningeret al., "SMILES. 2. Algorithm for Generation of Unique SMILES Notation,"/ Chem. ZnJ Comput. Sci. 1989, 29, 97-101, and also available at http://www.syrres.com/esc/docsmile.htm<br>
1.         With SMILES; obtain the result log KOW (]og|0(K0j,.water)) = 7.9507 and the molecular formula for the compound: C22H42O3. You will use the molecular formula to calculate the molecular volume.<br>
3.         From the Zhao et al. reference, use this formula for molecular volume: MolVol =• -5.92(Nmi:rm - I) t 7.24/V,, t- 20.58/V(. + 14.1 \N(I   Here, Natoms is the number of atoms in the molecule (67), N(- is the number of carbon atoms (22), NH is the number of hydrogen atoms (42). and No is the number of oxygen atoms (3). [If the flow promoter contains rings use a different formula - but this is described in the reference.  Also, if the How promoter contains atoms other than C, H, O use coefficients for these hetero atoms - but coefficients for many atoms are given in the reference. For the mono-ester with one unsaluration, MolVol =410.25<br>
4.	Calculate the segmental polarity (SP) as SP = 1000((log KOW) -<br>
0.229)/Molvol = 1000(7.9507    0.229)7410.25 = 18.82.<br>
5.	The calculated segmental polarity for this particular diester, where the OH<br>
functionality of the monoester has been esterified with an additional fatty acid, is 23.1.<br>
B: Polymer<br>
Segmental polarity for a polymer is the weighted average of the segmental polarities of the poly men/.eel monomers of which it is composed. However, because polymerized monomers are not chemically discrete molecules, an adjustment must be made in computing (he segmental polarity of a polymerized monomer.  For instance, the polymerized monomer of butyl acrylate is<br>
To compute the polymeri/ed monomer segmental polarity, the adjustment involves using a methyl-blocked monomer in the calculation. For butyl acrylate (for example), this would beAdding the blocking methyl groups turns the polymerized monomer mathematically into a chemically discrete molecule. Since loglO(Koil-water) is computed as a sum of contributions from the various lunctional groups, the adjustment further involves subtractingthe contributions from the iwo extra methyl groups to get loglO(Koil-water) for the polymeri/ed monomer unitHere is an example of how to get the segmcntal polarity for polymerized butylacrylate:Start the KOWWIN program.Fintcr the SMILES notation for methyl-blocked polymerized BA:<br>
CCC(C)C'(=O)OCCCCHit the Calculate button; obtain the result log KOW (logio(Koii.water)) = 3.2462<br>
and the molecular formula for the compound: C9H18O2.   In the KOWWIN program, as<br>
described in the references, it is established that a methyl group attached to an alkyl group<br>
contributes 0.5473 to the logK. Thus, the contribution of 2 methyl groups to the log K for<br>
methyl-blocked polymeri/ed BA is calculated as (2 x 0.5473 = 1.0946). Subtract two methyls<br>
to get the true molecular formula for polymerized BA:C7H12O2. This will be used in the<br>
molecular volume calculation.<br>
1.	From the Zhao et al. reference, use this formula for molecular volume:<br>
MolVoi ---. -5.92W,,,,,,,,, +1.24N,, + 2().58/V(. + 14.7 IN0	Here, Naloms is<br>
the number of atoms in the molecule (21), NC is the number of carbon atoms (7), NH is the<br>
number of hydrogen atoms (12), and NO is the number of oxygen atoms (2).  [This formula is<br>
slightly different from the one given for the oil above, because we must account for the extra<br>
bond in the polymerized monomer. For more details, see the reference. For polymerized<br>
butyl acrylate, MolVoi = 136.04.<br>
2.	Calculate the segmental polarity ("SP") as<br>
SP - 1000((log KOW) -109646 - ().229)/Molvol<br>
= 1000(3.2462 - 1.0946 - 0.229)7136.04 = 14.12.   The 1.0946 is subtracted to remove the effect of the blocking melhyl groups.<br>
Thus, the segmental polarity for butylacrylate homopolymer is 14.12. For a copolymer, the segmental polarity is the weighted average of the polymerized monomer segmental polarities. For example, a 50 BA / 50 MMA (SP = 8.90) copolymer has SP = 0.5*14.12 + 0.5*8.90 - 1 1.51. Segmental polarities for selected other polymers are shown in the table below:<br>

The particle size of Example 3 increases compared to Example 1 indicating the flow promoter has been added to the latex particles. Example 4 shows less flow promoter is present in the particles. Example 5 shows an increase in particle size which indicates that the stability of the latex particle is compromised in this sample<br>

Heat Age test:<br>
The test uses a filled 2 ounce glass jar of the material to be evaluated. The jar is placed in a 60°C Oven for 10 days. After 10 days a particle size measurement and a visual analysis on the sample is performed.<br>
Examples I and 2 arc the unmodified acrylic latex both of which show no stability problems in the heat age lest. Example 3 also shows very good heat aged stability and contains the flow promoter. Example 4 shows an incompatibility or phase separation with a clear oil layer on the surface.  Example 5 shows instability with the extreme viscosity build.<br>
Example 6: Preparation of Eow Molecular Weight Penetrating Acrylic Binder This example used the same procedure and materials as Example 3, except that soybean oil methyl ester was used in place of the propylene glycol monoester Archer RC. The final latex sample contained an oil layer at the top.

'Exterior Exposure Resistance of Semi-Transparent Stains<br>
Exterior Exposure Resistance is a measure of the ability of a stain to retain its original color and resist cracking, flaking, and peeling on decking boards after being subjected to natural outdoor exposure<br>
A decking board was sectioned into one foot sections. One coat of the test stains were applied to the board, each in a different section. The weight of stain applied was recorded. The boards were dried for 24 hours. The boards were then screwed down to an outdoor deck for exposure. The stains were typically evaluated after \-2 months, and then after 6, 12, 24 months<br>
Properties evaluated include: general appearance, tint retention, any loss of adhesion, cracking, flaking, or peeling.<br>

The results in Table 7.3 show that the stain prepared with the penetrating acrylic binder, Slain A, has very good color retention during outdoor exposure when compared to Commercial Stains I and 1. The stain prepared with the penetrating acrylic binder, Stain A also shows to have improved flaking resistance and better overall appearance compared to Commercial Stains 1 and 2.<br>
Cold Crack Adhesion Resistance of Exterior Semi-Transparent Stains<br>
('old Crack Adhesion Resistance is a measure of the ability of a stain to resist cracking and loss of adhesion on new copper quaternary pressure treated boards after being subjected to soaking in a continuous misting fog box and freezing and thawing cycles. This test is used to stimulate the type of freezing and thawing cycles that a stain applied to a wooden deck is subjected to in wet, colder climates.<br>
The cold crack adhesion resistance of the stains were evaluated according to the following test method described in the section.  A new copper quaternary pressure treated decking board was cut to a reasonable size and wiped down with a damp piece of cheese<br>
cloth   Two coats of each slain were applied in three inch sections, with a 4 hour dry time between coats. The side of the board used had the rings of the end grain facing down. The boards were dried at 24"C and 50% relative humidity for 72 hours, and then an initial wet adhesion was done on the lest areas.<br>
Using an Excel Adhesion Knife, 2 knife cuts through the test samples were made forming an X intersecting at about a 30" angle. A 1" x 1" piece of paper towel was placed over the X cut and dampened with about 2 mil of water and was let sit for 15 min. After 15 mins, paper towel was removed, water was blotted dry, and the X cut was allowed to dry for 10 mins.  Pcrmacel tape was applied over the X cut and rubbed to assure good contact. The tape was then pulled quickly at a 180° angle from the substrate. The % stain removed from the test area was rated.<br>
The board was then placed in a continuous misting fog box for 4 hours. This was the beginning of the 1s' cycle   Immediately after the board was removed from the fox box, it was placed in a freezer for 16 hours. The board was then removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw at 24°C and 50% relative humidity for 4 hours. That was the end of the 1st cycle.<br>
That procedure was done for a total of 10 cycles. The wet adhesion test was done alter the 3"', 5lh, 7lh, and 10th cycles. A scrape test was also done after each wet adhesion test.<br>
