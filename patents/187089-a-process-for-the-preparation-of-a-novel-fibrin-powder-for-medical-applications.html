				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel fibrin powder for medical applications. The fibrin powder finds potential use as a dressing aid in the treatment of various wounds of different nature, which include external injury, cut wounds, burn wounds and even ulcers in animals and human being. The fibrin powder, applied on a wound, not only prevents prevents any infection on the wound, but also stops further loss of electrolytes from the wound by acting as a haemostatic agent. Efficacy of wound-healing of the powder increases manifold when antiinfiamatory drugs, bactericides and even antibiotics such as terramicin,gentamicin and cephalaxin are incorporated into it.<br>
As reported by Styler ( Biochemistry, W.H.Freeman &amp; Co., New York,1988),fibrin monomers spontaneously assemble into ordered fibrous arrays called fibrin.Bleeding from any wound in an animal body stops automatically due to the natural process of blood clotting, which is caused by the conversion of fibrinogen, present in blood, into fibrous netlike fibrin in presence of thrombin, a proteolytic enzyme. It has also been confirmed by Bergel ( Deut. Med. Wochsch.,35, 663, 1909) and Piechotta et al ( Aesthetiic plast.surg,17,263,1983), that fibrin possesses good haemostatic and wound healing properties. Although the net like structure of natural fibrin film arrests the blood cells, which cannot come out, serum still oozes out along with electrolyte and thereby causes microbial infection. It is therefore necessary to dress the wound externally to accelerate the healing process. Management of deep wounds normally involves pouring ofantibiotic powder or fibrin powder followed by   a dressing by different materials like hand-aid, sys pur<br>
derm, nylon velour, polyester urethane, collagen sheet, fibrin sheet etc. Powder is sometimes poured into deep wounds like stab marks or leprosy ulcers as fillers without any covering of a sheet.<br>
The main drawback of antibiotic powder dressing is that the powder contains some carriers along with the actual antibiotic material and compatibility of this carrier material with the animal body is obviously one of the important criteria of great concern. Apart from these, keeping in mind the ever-growing concern for hygienic products, global attention has recently been shifting towards less-hazardous natural products.<br>
Raw blood is defibrinated by vigorous churning for the purpose of isolating<br>
various biochemicals like haemoglobin.The crude fibrin, separated from raw<br>
blood during the preocess of defibrination, does not produce good film. Even after<br>
drying, this fibrin cannot be used for wound dressing due to its britttle nature. This<br>
crude fibrin is either rejected usually as waste or used sometimes as plant-fertiliser.<br>
Laki ( Fibrinogen, Marcel Dekker,Inc, New York, 1968) mentioned that fibrin<br>
could be isolated from fibrinogen and be made in the form of sponge, film, powder,<br>
fibrin	glue etc.  Fibrinogen is isolated from blood   using centrifugation      in<br>
combination with either cryoprepcipitation or other precipitating agents like ethanol, ammomium sulfate or polyethylene glycol. Concentrated solution of isolated fibrinogen is diluted and mixed with thrombin in aqueous medium to form fibrin suspension. This mixture is dried and pulverized to produce natural fibrin powder, which is used   for dressing of wound.<br>
The main drawback of this system is that fibrin being a protein,is susceptible to decay by proteolytic attack.Thus shelf life of this natural fibrin powder is obviously very low,because crude protein is used as such in this process. For the same reason, it requires frequent changes of dressing and lingers the healing process, when used for wound dressing.<br>
Another drawback of this natural fibrin powder is that thrombin is not readily available and it adds to the cost of preparation of the film.<br>
Yet another limitation of this natural powder is that coupling of other drug is not possible for  the betterment of the functionality of the product.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel fibrin powder for medical applications, which obvitiioo the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to utilise the crude fibrin,which is otherwise discarded as waste, thereby generating wealth out of waste.<br>
Yet   another   objective of the present invention   is   to prepare   a   product which is capable   of   incorporating   drugs      like    bactericides    and      antibiotics    such      as terramicin, gentamicin, cephalexin for effecting better efficacy of the treatment. Still   another objective of the present invention is   to   prepare    modified   fibrin    with better longevity on wound,so that the number of dressings can be reduced. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for   the   preparation   of a novel fibrin powder for medical applications which comprises i) purifying, bleaching and masticating crude fibrin in a known manner to form a paste,<br>
ii) graft copolymerising the said fibrin present  in the paste, with an acrylic monomer<br>
in presence of redox initiator and    a known crosslinker at a temperature of around<br>
40-65°C over a period of 2-4 hrs.,<br>
iii) optionally  reacting with drugs  containing NH2 OH, COOH groups to    be  coupled<br>
to the graft copolymer, as formed in step (ii), then drying  the  resulting copolymer.<br>
iv) pulverizing   the   dried   copolymer, as   formed in step (iii), to a particle size of 75-<br>
750 microns,<br>
v) sterilising the powder, as formed in step (iv), by conventional gamma irradiation.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, 2-5% by weight, of a metallic salt of an<br>
organic acid on the weight of crude fibrin is used for purification of fibrin.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, 2-5% w/w uf crosslinking agents on the<br>
dry fibrin film is used for  the   graft copolymerisation.<br>
In  yet  another embodiment of the  present  invention, drugs containing -NH2, -OH, -<br>
COOH groups can be coupled to the graft copolymer.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the copolymer emulsion is dried to<br>
a moisture content of 8-10%.<br>
Crude fibrin obtained after defibrinating raw blood, is used as the starting material for the present invention. It is washed conventionally in 3-5 changes of plain water and 2-5% w/w, of a matallic salt of an organic acid, dissolved in 20-50 times of volumes of water, to remove blood clots. Washed fibrin is then suspended in 80-150%    w/v of water and is bleached with     10-30%    v/v,       of    a conventional<br>
bleaching agent at a pH in the  range of 7.5-10,   adjusted by a conventional alkali,<br>
over a period of 10-15 hrs.The colour of the fibrin, at this   stage, turns white.<br>
The   bleached   fibrin is then washed  conventionally   in  200-300%   w/v   of plain<br>
water  for 10-20 mins   and  thenground in a conventional way to form a paste. The<br>
ground paste is suspended in 6-10 times w/v of water and is polymerised with 20-<br>
40% by weight of an acrylic monomer on dry film weight in presence of 2-5 times<br>
w/w, of  redox initiator,2-5% w/w of crosslinking agents on the   dry fibrin film at<br>
a  temperature in the range of 40-60°C over a period of 30-180 mins.<br>
10% by weight of a drag containing -NH2, -OH, -COOH   groups on fibrin weight<br>
is optionally treated with the reaction mixture with constant stirring for preparing<br>
drag-coupled fibrin-polyacrylate graft copolymer. The reaction    is    continued for<br>
a further period of 20-40 mins.<br>
Completion of polymerisation reaction is ascertained    by conventional titration<br>
method.<br>
The   resulting   graft   copolymer,obtained   in   the   form   of emulsion,      is   dried<br>
conventionally at a temperature in the range of 40-70°C over a period of 3-8 hrs to<br>
8-10% moisture content. The dried copolymer is is treated with 3-5 times w/v of an<br>
organic solvent to extract the homopolymers    present in the sheet over a period<br>
of  2-5 hrs.<br>
The  resulting sheet is sterilised by exposing the  same  to   gamma irradiation in the<br>
range of 1-3 M rads and is   stored in 90-95% solution of an aqueous organic solvent.<br>
Thus  this  process of invention provides a  simple  new method  of utilising crude<br>
fibrin for making powder of better efficacy, stability and shelf-life.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
500 gms of crude fibrin containing blood clots was collected from the slaughter<br>
house   for  the  present  experiment. It was washed thoroughly under running water<br>
and then treated with 25gms of sodium acetate,dissolved   in 1 lit of water to remove<br>
the blood clots/blood stains from the fibrin.<br>
Blood clot free fibrin was then put in 750 ml of water in a plastic tub. pH of the bath<br>
was adjusted to 8.5 by adding a few drops of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution. 25<br>
ml of hydrogen peroxide was then added with   constant   stirring   for 10 hrs. after<br>
which colour of the fibrin turned to white.<br>
The     bleached  white  fibrin  was  removed  from   the   bleaching bath,  washed<br>
thoroughly  with  cold  running  water and ground with the help of mixer to form a<br>
paste.    10 gm of the above paste was suspended in  100 ml of water in a 500 ml<br>
conical flask fitted with a two necked adapter and 100 ml of water was added to it.<br>
0.25 gms of Sodium metabisulphite and an equal amount of potassium  persulphate<br>
were added to the  above mixture with  constant  stirring and the reaction mixture<br>
was heated   to a temperature of 55°C. Then 3 ml   of hydroxyethyl methacrylate<br>
was added drop by drop to   the     solution with stirring,which was continued for a<br>
further   period of 45 mins.Then 0.08 gm of glutaraldehyde was added to the bath<br>
with constant stirring for 5 mins. Temperature was maintained at 55°C throughout<br>
the reaction.<br>
After 60 mins, butylamine   titrartion confirmed the absence   of free hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate and hence completion of the polymerisation reaction.<br>
The resulting fibrin- polyhydroxyethyl   methacrylate graft copolymer was taken out<br>
from the flask and kept in 100 ml of plain water in a beaker. After a period of 1 hr,<br>
water was decanted and the wet copolymer was treated with   100  ml  of acetone for<br>
3 hrs with continuous shaking.<br>
The resulting material was dried at 55°C   for 3 hrs in a  hot air oven  and was then<br>
pulverized in a bone mill to a particle size of 750 microns.<br>
The powder was exposed to gamma irradation at 1.5 M rads.<br>
The fibrin-polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate graft copolymer powder was finally stored<br>
in polythene cover.<br>
EXAMPLE-2 250 gms of crude fibrin containing blood clots was collected from the slaughter house   for  the  present  experiment. It was washed thoroughly under running water and    then    treated   with   15gms    of    potassium   acetate,dissolved in 500 ml of water to remove the blood clots/blood stains from the fibrin.<br>
Blood clot free fibrin was then put in 500 ml of water in a plastic tub. pH of the bath was adjusted to 8 by adding a few drops of 0.1 N potassium hydroxide solution. 15 ml of sodium peroxide was then added with constant stirring for 8 hrs, after which colour of the fibrin turned to white.<br>
The     bleached  white   fibrin  was   removed   from    the bleaching  bath,  washed<br>
thoroughly with cold running   water and ground with the help of mixer to foim a<br>
paste.   10 gm of the above paste was suspended in   100 ml of water in a 500 ml<br>
conical flask fitted with a two necked adapter and   100 ml of water was added to it.<br>
pH was adjusted to 3 by using 0.1 N hydrochloric acid.<br>
0.2   gms   of Sodium bisulphite and an   equal   amount   o ammonium  persulphate<br>
were added to the  above mixture with constant stirring and the reaction mixture<br>
was    heated   to   a temperature of 65°C. Then 4 ml   of methyl   methacrylate was<br>
added drop by drop to the solution with    stirring,which was continued for a further<br>
period ol 45   mins. Then 0.1 gm of basic chromium sulphate, dissolved in 2 ml of<br>
water, was added to the bath with constant stirring for 5 mins.      Temperature    was<br>
maintained at 65°C throughout  the reaction.<br>
After  60  mins, butylamine    titrartion  confirmed  the absence     of   free  methyl<br>
methacrylate   and  hence completion of the polymerisation reaction.<br>
The resulting fibrin- polymethyl methacrylate graft copolymer was taken out from<br>
the flask and kept in 100 ml of plain water in a beaker. After a period of 1 hr, water<br>
was decanted and the wet copolymer was treated    with 100 ml of acetone for   3<br>
hrs with continuous shaking The resulting material was dried at 60°C for 3 hrs in a<br>
hot air oven   and then was pulverized in a bone mill   to     a particle size of 750<br>
microns.<br>
The   powder  was    exposed  to   gamma  irradation  at 2 M rads.<br>
The   fibrin-polymethyl methacrylate graft   copolymer powder was finally stored in polythene cover.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
1000 gms of crude fibrin containing blood clots was collected from the slaughter<br>
house   for  the  present  experiment. It was washed thoroughly under running water<br>
and then treated with 50 gms of sodium acetate,dissolved in 2 lit of water to remove<br>
the blood clots/blood stains from the fibrin.<br>
Blood clot free fibrin was then put in 1500 ml of water in  a plastic tub. pH of the<br>
bath was adjusted to 8 by adding a few drops of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
50  ml of sodium peroxide was then added  with  constant  stirring  for  8 hrs, after<br>
which colour of the fibrin turned to white.<br>
The     bleached  white   fibrin  was  removed  from    the    bleaching  bath,  washed<br>
thoroughly  with  cold  running    water and ground with the help of mixer to form a<br>
paste.<br>
10 gm of the above paste was suspended in 100 ml of water in a 500 ml conical flask fitted with a two necked adapter and 100 ml of water was added to it. 0.5 gms of Sodium metabisulphite and an equal amount of ammonium persulphate were added to the above mixture with constant stirring and the reaction mixture was heated to a temperature of 60°C. Then 10 ml of hydroxyethyl methacrylate was added drop by drop to the solution with stirring,which was continued for a further period of 45 mins. Then 0.16 ml of glutaraldehyde was added to the bath with constant stirring for 5 mins. Temperature was maintained at 60°C throughout the reaction.<br>
After   60   mins, the reaction mixture   was   cooled to   a   temperature   of 25°C and<br>
stirred for 30 mins.   Then    100   gms   of tetracycline was added to the   leaction<br>
mixture with   constant stirring and  the   temperature  was   maintained at 25°C.<br>
After 90 mins, butylamine titrartion confirmed the absence   of free hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate and hence completion of the polymerisation reaction.<br>
The   resulting   fibrin-   polyhydroxyethyl    methacrylate   graft   copolymer, coupled<br>
with tetracycline, was taken   out from the flask and kept in 100 ml of plain water in<br>
a beaker. After a period of 1 hr, water was decanted and   the wet copolymer was<br>
treated with 100 ml of acetone for   3 hrs with continuous shaking.<br>
The resulting material was dried at 40OC   for 5 hrs in a hot air oven   and then was<br>
pulverized in a bone mill   to    a particle size of 500 microns.The     powder     was<br>
exposed to   gamma  irradation  at 1 M rads.<br>
The    tetracycline   coupled    fibrin-polyhydroxyethyl   methacrylate graft copolymer<br>
powder was finally stored in polythene cover.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are the following.<br>
1.	Crude fibrin, which is usually discarded as waste, is used as the raw<br>
material,thereby   suggesting   an economical method for the disposal of the same.<br>
2.	Grafting of biocompatible polymers onto fibrin improves the function of the<br>
product.<br>
3.	Since a hydrophilic and biocompatible monomer is graft-copolymerised with<br>
fibrin, the powder absorbs the wound exudate readily to keep the wound clean and<br>
dry, thereby preventing any possible infection.<br>
4.	This novel powder can be applied to deep wounds, stab wounds and ulcers upon<br>
which a sheet cannot be applied.<br>
5.	The powder may be stored for a longer time<br>
6.	Polymerisation reaction takes place at comparatively lower temperature, thereby making the   temperature management much easier.<br>
7.	The powder is biocompatible and does not produce any   irritation on skin.<br>
8.	It   is very useful in veterinary surgery    for amputation of horn,tail etc.<br>
9.	Antibiotics like gentamicin and tetracylin could be coupled to the grafted<br>
composite through the hydroxyl functional groups introduced by<br>
polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate. These graft copolymers coupied with antibiotics<br>
can be used in the case of above said infected tissue repair.<br><br><br><br><br>
