				<td>PROCESSES FOR PREPARING<br>
(R)-8-CHLORO-1-METHYL-2,3,4,5-TETRAHYDRO-1H-3-BENZAZEPINE<br>
AND INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to processes and intermediates for the<br>
preparation of (R)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine, and solid forms<br>
thereof, which are serotonin-2C (5-HT2C) receptor agonists useful in the treatment of, for<br>
example, obesity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission plays an important role in numerous physiological<br>
processes both in health and in psychiatric disorders. For example, 5-HT has been implicated in<br>
the regulation of feeding behavior. 5-HT is believed to work by inducing a feeling of fullness or<br>
satiety so eating stops earlier and fewer calories are consumed. It has been shown that a<br>
stimulatory action of 5-HT on the 5-HT2C receptor plays an important role in the control of<br>
earing and in the anti-obesity effect of d-fenfluramine. As the 5-HT2C receptor is expressed in<br>
high density in the brain (notably in the limbic structures, extrapyramidal pathways, thalamus<br>
and hypothalamus i.e. PVN and DMH, and predominantly in the choroid plexus) and is<br>
expressed in low density or is absent in peripheral tissues, a selective 5-HT2c receptor agonist<br>
can be a more effective and safe anti-obesity agent. Also, 5-HT2c knockout mice are overweight<br>
with cognitive impairment and susceptibility to seizure. Thus, the 5-HT2C receptor is recognized<br>
as a well-accepted receptor target for the treatment of obesity, psychiatric, and other disorders.<br>
Lorcaserin hydrochloride (8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine<br>
hydrochloride) is an agonist of the 5-HT2c receptor and shows effectiveness at reducing obesity<br>
in animal models and humans. Patients enrolled in a 12-week Phase lib clinical trial achieved a<br>
highly statistically significant mean weight loss of 4.0, 5.7, and 7.9 pounds at daily doses of 10<br>
mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg (10 mg dosed twice daily), respectively, compared to 0.7 pounds for the<br>
placebo group. The proportion of patients completing the treatment period who achieved a 5%<br>
or greater weight loss from baseline were 13%, 20%, and 31% at daily doses of 10 mg, 15 mg,<br>
and 20 mg, respectively, compared with 2% in the placebo group. This data, showing<br>
statistically significant, progressive, and dose-dependant weight loss, coupled with the drug's<br>
favorable tolerability profile make locaserin hydrochloride an attractive new therapy for obesity,<br>
and accordingly, Phase HI clinical trials are underway. Various synthetic routes to locaserin<br><br>
hydrochloride, its related salts, enantiomers, crystalline forms, and intermediates, have been<br>
reported in WO 2005/019179, WO 2006/069363, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,953,787.<br>
In view of the growing demand for compounds for the treatment of disorders related to<br>
the 5-HT2C receptor, new and more efficient routes to 3-benzazepines, including locaserin<br>
hydrochloride, are needed. The processes and compounds described herein help meet these and<br>
other needs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The processes and intermediates of the present invention are useful in the preparation of<br>
therapeutic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of 5-HT2C associated disorders such as<br>
obesity and central nervous system diseases. Example processes and intermediates of the<br>
present invention are provided below in Schemes 1,2 and 3.<br><br>
I-J.<br><br>
In some embodiments, Lg is OH, halo, or other leaving group. As used herein, the term<br>
"leaving group" refers to a moiety that can be displaced by another moiety, such as by<br>
nucleophilic attack, during a chemical reaction. Leaving groups are well known in the art and<br>
include, for example, halo, hydroxy, -OR", and -OSi(Rb)3 wherein Ra can be C1-8 alkyl, C3-7<br>
cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocycloalkyl, and Rb can be C1-C8 alkyl. In some<br>
embodiments, Lg is OH. In further embodiments, Lg is halo such as fluoro, chloro, bromo, or<br>
iodo. In yet further embodiments, Lg is chloro.<br>
The term "coupling reagent," as used herein, is meant to refer to a reagent or<br>
combination of reagents that facilitates formation of an amide bond between the phenylacetic<br>
acid derivative compound of Formula 1-1 and the amine compound of Formula 1-2. Suitable<br>
coupling reagents include, for example, boron-containing acids, carbodiimides, and ketals.<br>
Further examples of coupling reagents include bases.<br>
Suitable boron-containing acids include, for example, boric acid (B(OH)3), boronic<br>
acids (e.g., boric acid wherein at least one OH group is replaced with an organic moiety), or<br>
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the boronic acid is an optionally substituted<br>
arylboronic acid such as phenylboronic acid or 2,5,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid. In some<br>
embodiments, the coupling reagent contains phenylboronic acid, boric acid, or mixture thereof.<br>
In yet further embodiments, the coupling reagent contains a halo-substituted arylboronic acid<br>
such as 2,5,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid. In some embodiments when the coupling reagent<br>
contains at least one boron-containing acid, Lg is OH.<br>
Suitable carbodiimides include any reagent containing a carbodiimide (N=C=N)<br>
functionality that can serve as a carboxyl activating group to facilitate amide bond formation.<br>
An example carbodiimide is l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride<br>
(EDC). Other suitable carbodiimides include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC),<br>
diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC),N-cyclohexyl-N'-(D-N-methylmorpholino)ethylcarbodiimide<br>
(CMC), and the like. In some embodiments when the coupling reagent contains at least one<br>
carbodiimide, Lg is OH.<br>
Suitable ketals can have the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are C1-6 alkyl. In some embodiments, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are<br>
independently selected from methyl and ethyl. In yet further embodiments, the ketal comprises<br>
2,2-dimethoxypropane. In some embodiments when the coupling reagent contains at least one<br>
ketal, Lg is OH.<br>
Suitable bases for use as a coupling reagent include any base effective for facilitating<br>
formation of an amide bond and which do not substantially interfere with the amide-forming<br>
reaction. Example bases include tertiary amines such as tri(C1-6)alkylamines. In some<br><br><br>
embodiments, the base is triethylamine.   In some embodiments when the coupling reagent<br>
contains a base, Lg is halo.<br>
The above process for preparing amides of Formula 1 -3 can further yield a<br>
dihydrooxazole compound of Formula 1-4:<br><br>
1-4<br>
or salt thereof. The dihydrooxazole compound of Formula 1-4 is related to the amide of<br>
Formula 1-3 by the loss of one water molecule. Accordingly, the dihydrooxazole compound of<br>
Formula 1-4 is typically formed under dehydrating reaction conditions, such as when the<br>
coupling reagent further acts as a dehydrating agent. Example coupling reagents capable of this<br>
dual coupling/dehydrating activity include, for example, carbodiimides and ketals. The<br>
dihydrooxazole compound of Formula 1-4 can be produced in variable amounts, but is usually<br>
observed as a minor product relative to the amide of Formula 1-3.<br>
The amide-forming process as described above can be carried out where the coupling<br>
reagent is provided in molar excess relative to either the phenylacetic acid derivative compound<br>
of Formula 1-1 or the amino compound of Formula 1-2. In some embodiments, the molar ratio<br>
of the phenylacetic acid derivative compound of Formula 1-1 to the coupling reagent is about<br>
1:1 to about 20:1, about 1:1 to about 10:1, or about 1:1 to about 5:1.<br>
The above amide-forming process can further be optionally carried out in the presence<br>
of a solvent such as an aromatic solvent or an alcohol solvent. Typical aromatic solvents<br>
include, for example, benzene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, toluene, o-xylene, p-xylene,<br>
m-xylene, xylenes, mixtures thereof and the like. Typical alcohol solvents include, for example,<br>
methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, glycols, glycerols,<br>
mixtures thereof and the like. In some embodiments, the solvent includes toluene. In further<br>
embodiments, the solvent includes methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol.<br>
The above amide-forming process can further be optionally carried out in the presence<br>
of an acid catalyst. In some embodiments, the acid catalyst comprises a sulfonic acid such as an<br>
optionally substituted arylsulfonic acid (e.g., p-toluenesulfonic acid).   Other suitable acid<br>
catalysts include sulfuric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, trifiuorornethansulfonic acid, hydrochloric<br>
acid, mixtures thereof and the like. In some embodiments, the acid catalyst is present when the<br>
coupling reagent includes a ketal.<br>
The above amide-forming process can be carried out at about room temperature or at an<br>
elevated temperature. In some embodiments, the elevated temperature is about 80 °C to about<br>
140 °C. In further embodiments, the temperature is room temperature when the coupling<br>
reagent includes a carbodiimide.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides processes for preparing an amide<br>
compound of Formula 1 -3 comprising reacting, in a solvent comprising toluene and at elevated<br>
temperature, a phenylacetic acid derivative compound of Formula 1-1, or salt thereof, with an<br>

acid. In further embodiments, the reacting is carried out in the presence of phenylboronic acid,<br>
boric acid, or mixture thereof. In yet further embodiments, the reacting is carried out in the<br>
presence of 2,5,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid.<br>

compound of Formula 1-3 and optionally a dihydrooxazole compound of Formula 1-4, or salt<br>
thereof, comprising reacting, in a solvent comprising isopropyl alcohol and at about room<br>
temperature, a phenylacetic acid derivative compound of Formula 1-1, or salt thereof, with an<br>
amine compound of Formula 1-2, or salt thereof, in the presence of l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC).<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention further provides processes for preparing an<br>

embodiments, the above process further comprises combining the 2,2-dimethoxypropane with<br>
the phenylacetic acid derivative compound of Formula 1-1 prior to reacting with the amine<br>
compound of Formula 1-2, or salt thereof. In some embodiments, the prior combining affords<br>
2-(4-chlorophenyl)aceb"c acid methyl ester which is then subject to reaction with the amine<br>
compound of Formula 1-2. In some embodiments, conversion to 2-(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid<br>
methyl ester is about 90% or greater. The prior combining of the phenylacetic acid derivative<br>

Method A (Boronic Acid)<br>
Toluene (50 mL) was charged to a 3-neck round-bottom (500 mL) flask fitted with a<br>
Dean-Stark condenser. 4-Chlorophenylacetic acid (51.2 g, 300 mmol) was added, followed by<br>
2,5,6-trifluorophenylboronic acid (30 mmol, 5.28 g) and l-aminopropan-2-ol (24.8 g, 330<br>
mmol). The reaction flask was heated at 120 °C for 23 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to<br>
room temperature, and then solvent was removed to afford the crude product as white solid.<br>
Then water (120 mL) was added to the crude product. The resulting product was filtered and<br>
dried in a vacuum oven overnight to yield 62.5 g of pure product as a white solid (91.5% yield).<br>

distilled off during the reaction. The reaction mixture was then charged with 30 mL (6.0<br><br>
volumes) of water while maintaining the internal temperature around 100 °C followed by<br>
cooling in an ice bath for 30 minutes to precipitate the product as a fine solid. Solids were<br>

Preparation of l-(4-chlorophenethyiamino)propan-2-ol (2-1) hydrochloride salt<br><br><br>
Method A<br>
A 150 mL round bottom flask equipped with a condenser was charged with 10 g (0.044<br>
mol, 1.0 eq) of 2-{4-chlorophenyl)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acetamide followed by 77 mL (0.154<br>
moles, 3.5 eq) of 2.0 M BH3/THF. Reaction contents foamed and were held for about 6 h at<br>
reflux until reaction completion exceeded 98% by LC/MS. Then 10 mL of methanol was added<br>
to the reaction mixture to quench excess borane with the first 4 mL of methanol resulting in<br>
fairly vigorous off-gassing. Solvent was distilled down to no less than about 20% of the initial<br>
volume and 100 mL of methanol was added followed by distillation down to an oil. The<br>
reaction vessel was then charged with 50 mL (5 volumes) of 37% HC1 to precipitate a white<br>
solid which was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C to yield 8.25 g of white powder<br>
product as the HC1 salt (75% yield).<br>
Method B<br>
To a 200 mL round bottom flask equipped with a condenser and a gas outlet leading to<br>
an aqueous sodium hypochlorite scrubber was charged 10 g (0.044 mol, 1.0 eq) of 2-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acetamide followed by 77 mL of THF resulting in a clear<br>
solution. To the mixture was added dropwise 15.4 mL of 10.0 M (0.154 moles, 3.5 eq) of<br>
borane methyl sulfide complex resulting in violent foaming. The reaction was held at reflux<br>
until 98% reaction completion was verified by LCMS (~ 6 hr). White solid started to precipitate<br>
about two hours after borane addition had been completed. The reaction was quenched with 10<br>
mL of methanol with the first 4 mL methanol resulting in vigorous off-gassing. The resulting<br>
mixture was then refluxed for ~1 h and then concentrated to about 20% of the original volume.<br>
Methanol (100 ml) was added, and the mixture was refluxed for ~1 h and then concentrated to a<br>
white solid residue. Cone. HC1 (37%, 5 mL) was added to the residue at 0 CC (exothermic).<br>
The resulting mixture was filtered, and the filtered white solid was dried at 70 °C in a vacuum<br>
oven to constant weight (-5-7 h) then at room temperature overnight to afford crude product as<br>
a white solid 11.5 g (-104 %). The solid was then partially dissolved in cone. HC1 (20 mL).<br>
The resulting mixture was filtered to yield 0.87 g of white solid after drying. After adding ~5<br>
mL water, the mother liquor precipitated additional white solid (7.87 g after drying) to give a<br>
combined yield of 8.74 g (80%).<br><br>

of the mixture of 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acetainide and 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)-5-<br>
methyl-4,5-dihydrooxazole produced in Example 2 followed by THF (10 mL) and 15.4 mL<br>
(15.4 mmol, 3.5 eq) of 1.0 M BH3/THF. The reaction mixture was held at reflux for about 16 h<br>
until reaction completion exceeded 98% by LC/MS. The resulting mixture was distilled down to<br>
an oil, to which was added 5 mL (5 volumes) of 1 N NaOH with stirring for 1 h. Then 5 mL (5<br>
volumes) of isopropyl acetate was added and the product isolated by extraction. The organic<br>
layer was washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to afford the product as a<br>

room temperature after 1 h. The mixture was then further cooled in an ice water bath to 10 °C,<br>
held between 10 °C and 15 °C for 1.5 h, cooled in a salt/ice water bath (between 0 °C and 3 °C),<br>
and held at this temperature for an additional 1.5 h. The resulting slurry was suction filtered in a<br>
Buchner funnel, and the filtered solid was washed with a 15 mL IPA rinse of the crystallization<br>
flask. The resulting cake was sucked dry on the filter plate and then vacuum dried at 60 °C<br>
overnight to yield 1.924 g of final product as a white solid HC1 salt (85.82% yield).<br>
Method B<br>
To a 15 mL 3-neck round bottom flask containing l-(4-chlorophene1hylammo)-propan-<br>
2-ol hydrochloride (1.254 g, 5.013 mmol) was added fliionyl chloride (-0.7 mL) (slowly) via<br>
syringe to suspend solids. The mixture was then heated in an oil bath to 50 °C. Additional<br>
thionyl chloride was then added for a total amount of 3.659 mL (50.13 mmol). The yellowish<br>
clear solution was heated to 62 °C in an oil bath and held at that temperature 2 h before being<br>
cooled to 17 °C in an ice water bath.  The resulting slurry was suction filtered through a<br>
Buchner funnel, and the filtered solid was washed with IPA. The cake was vacuum dried at 60<br>
°C (0.812 g, HPLC purity 99.87%). The mother liquor had a large amount of solid visible and<br>
was suction filtered in a Buchner funnel. The cake was washed with 10 mL of IPA and vacuum<br>
dried at 60 °C to yield an additional 0.124 g for a combined total of 0.936 g final product as the<br>
HC1 salt (69.52% yield).<br>

Example 6<br>
Alternate preparation of 2-chloro-N-(4-chIoropbenethyI)propan-l-amine (3-1)<br>
hydrochloride<br><br><br>
2-(4-Chlorophenyl)acetic acid (1.9 kg, 11.1 mol, 1.00 eq), toluene (1 L), phenylboronic<br>
acid (67 g, 549 mmo, 0.049 eq.), and boric acid (68 g, 1.10 mol. 0.099 eq) where charged to a 20<br>
L jacketed reactor in the specified order. After the resulting mixture had been heated with<br>
stirring to 40 °C, l-amino-2-propanol (908 g, 12.09 mol, 1.085 eq) and toluene (1 L) were<br>
added. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux while the water coproduct was removed<br>
in a Dean-Stark trap. Refluxing and water removal were continued until conversion of 2-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)acetic acid exceeded 98%. Such conversion is usually achieved with 8-12 hours<br>
of refluxing. Water coproduct removed in the Dean-Stark trap totaled 265 mL (14.72 mol).<br>
After the reaction mixture had been cooled to 60-70 °C, 5 wt% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2<br>
L) was added slowly while the reaction mixture was maintained at 60-70 DC. Water (10 mL)<br>
was then added slowly while the stirred reaction mixture was maintained at ^50 °C. The<br>
diluted reaction mixture was cooled to 30 °C and stirred at that temperature for 30 minutes. The<br>
resulting solid precipitate was filtered and vacuum dried for 48 hours at 50 °C to provide 2-(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acetamide (2.356 kg, 92.9 % yield not corrected for purity,<br>
90.12 % purity by HPLC peak area).<br>
Step 2<br>
2-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acetamide (5.0 g, 21.96 mmol, 1.00 eq),<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF, 7.5 mL), and sodiumborohydride (1.662 g, 43.9 mmol, 2.00 eq) were<br>
charged to a 100 mL round bottomed flask. The resulting stirred white suspension was cooled<br>
to -10 °C, and a solution of iodine (5.574 g, 21.96 mmol, 1.00 eq) in THF (10 mL) was added<br>
dropwise over 30 minutes while cooling of the reaction suspension was continued. Hydrogen<br><br>
gas evolved during the addition. After the addition, the dark brown reaction suspension was<br>
heated and stirred at 70 °C until 2-(4-chlorophenyI)-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)acetamide conversion<br>
was substantially complete. Such conversion was achieved in 3.5 hours at 70 °C. The reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and methanol (15 mL) was added sufficiently slowly to maintain<br>
the stirred reaction mixture at about 0 °C with external cooling. The methanol addition was<br>
initially accompanied by fairly vigorous evolution of gas. After the resulting mixture had been<br>
heated at 65 °C for 0.5 hr, solvents were evaporated under vacuum. To the residual white slurry<br>
was added 50 wt% aqueous NaOH (15 mL, 286 mmol, 13 eq) while the stirred product mixture<br>
was maintained at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was heated with stirring at 80 °C for 1.5 hr.<br>
After 0.5 hr of such heating, mild foaming stopped, and a mixture of two clear, homogenous<br>
layers was obtained. Toluene (20 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was heated and<br>
stirred at 50 °C to extract the product into toluene. The lower aqueous layer was drained, and<br>
the upper organic layer was washed with water (two 15 mL portions). The washed organic layer<br>
was evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 60 °C. Vacuum drying of the evaporation residue at<br>
60 °C was continued for 2 hr to yield intermediate l-(4-chlorophenethylamino)-propan-2-ol as<br>
an off-white solid (4.23 g, 90.1 % yield, 96.17 % purity by HPLC peak area). To the<br>
intermediate l-(4-chlorophenethylamino)propan-2-ol in a round bottomed flask was added<br>
toluene (20 mL). (One skilled in the art can achieve substantially the same water-free mixture<br>
of intermediate l-(4-chlorophenethylamino)propan-2-ol in toluene by azeotropic removal of<br>
water without evaporation of the majority of the toluene.)<br>
N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMA), 0.614 mL, 6.60 mmol, 0.301 eq) was added to the<br>
substantially water-free mixture of intermediate l-(4-chlorophenethylamino)propan-2-ol in<br>
toluene as it was stirred under nitrogen at 40-45 °C. Thionyl chloride (2.04 mL, 28.0 mmol,<br>
1.274 eq) was then added while the stirred mixture was maintained at 50-60 °C. The stirred<br>
reaction mixture was then heated at 62 °C for three hours. LC/MS analysis of the crude reaction<br>
mixture indicated that conversion of the intermediate l-(4-chIorophenethyl-amino)propan-2-ol<br>
was substantially complete after two hours. After the reaction mixture had been cooled to 0-5<br>
°C, isopropanol (5 mL) was added while the stirred product mixture was maintained at 0-5 °C.<br>
Stirring at that temperature was continued for 2-3 hours, and then toluene (5 mL) was added to<br>
the suspension. After the resulting mixture had been heated to 60 °C for 30 minutes, the solid<br>
product was recovered by filtration, washing with isopropanol (2 x 5 mL), and vacuum drying at<br>
72 °C overnight to provide off-white solid 2-chloro-N-(4-chlorophenethyl)propan-l-amine<br>
hydrochloride (4.38 g, 74.3% yield, 99.60% purity by HPLC peak area).<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of (R,S)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine (3-2)<br><br><br>
To a reactor equipped with an overhead surrer, jacket temperature control, a nitrogen<br>
inlet, and a caustic scrubber vent were charged, in the specified order, 2-chloro-N-(4-<br>
chlorophenethyl)propan-l-amine hydrochloride (1.00 Kg, 3.72 mol, 1.00 equiv.), aluminum<br>
chloride (0.745 Kg, 5.58 mol, 1.50 equiv.), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (2.88 Kg). The stirred<br>
reactor contents were heated to 125-130 °C, and stirring was continued at that temperature for<br>
14-18 h. At 60-70 "C, a dark colored solution was obtained. After reaction completion<br>
(
were cooled to 30-35 °C.<br>
To a second reactor, vented to a caustic scrubber, was charged purified water (1.60 L)<br>
and silica gel (0.160 Kg). The Friedel Crafts reaction mixture was transferred from the first<br>
reactor to the second reactor sufficiently slowly to maintain the stirred contents of the second<br>
reactor at 
and the filtered solids were subsequently washed with purified water (800 mL) preheated to 50-<br>
60 °C. The combined mother and wash liquor filtrates were cooled to 20-25 °C with vigorous<br>
agitation. Then the stirring was stopped, and the phases were allowed to separate at 20-25 °C.<br>
(Process volume peaked at this point at 5.68 L). Three phases separated after 1-2 h of standing.<br>
The lowest layer was drained to waste disposal. This dark layer consisted mostly of<br>
1,2-dichlorobenzene (1.64 Kg, 1.33 L) at pH 3-4. About 1% of the product was lost to this<br>
layer. The remaining two phases were allowed to stand without agitation for another 2-4'h. The<br>
lower layer was drained and saved (Layer A). This light colored phase (2.64 Kg, 2.00 L, pH 2-<br>
3) contained ~ 90% 8-chloro-l -methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine. The upper layer<br>
(2.24 Kg of a turbid waterphase at pH 0-1) contained ~ 1-4% 8-chloro-l -methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine and remained in the reactor for back-extraction.<br>
The reactor was charged with cyclohexane (1.10 Kg) and then 30% aqueous NaOH<br>
(2.44 Kg, 18.3 mol, 4.91 equiv.). The resulting mixture (5.60 L) was stirred vigorously for 30<br>
minutes at room temperature. The stirring was stopped, and the phases were allowed to separate<br>
for 25-40 minutes. If the pH of the lower (aqueous) phase was &gt;13, it was drained to waste<br>
disposal. Otherwise, more 30% aqueous NaOH was added, and this extraction was repeated. At<br>
pH 14, the aqueous phase contained 
benzazepine free base. The remaining upper (organic) phase from the reactor was drained and<br>
saved (Layer B). The reactor was rinsed with purified water and followed by a suitable organic<br>
solvent to remove residual salts. The lower, light-colored product phase (the middle of the<br>
original three phases, Layer A) and the upper phase (organic, Layer B) were returned to the<br><br><br>
reactor. To the stirred reactor contents was added 30% aqueous NaOH (1.60 Kg, 12.0 mol, 3.23<br>
eq.). The reactor contents were stirred vigorously for 0.5 h. The stirring was discontinued and<br>
the phases were allowed to separate over 15-30 min. The lower (aqueous) layer was drained to<br>
waste disposal. To the upper (organic) phase remaining in the reactor was added purified water<br>
(2.40 Kg). The reactor contents were stirred vigorously at 60-65 °C for 0.5 h. The stirring was<br>
discontinued, and the phases were allowed to separate at 60-65 °C over 1.5-2 h. The lower<br>
(aqueous) layer was drained to waste disposal. With a reactor jacket temperature of 55-60 °C,<br>
solvent from the upper (organic) layer was removed by vacuum distillation at pressures starting<br>
at 115-152 torr and falling to 40 torr. The crude product, 8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-<br>
lH-3-benzazepine as the free base, was obtained as a yellow to brown, oily distillation residue.<br>
Example 8<br>
Preparation of L-(+)-tartaric acid salt of (R)-8-chIoro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-<br>
benzazepine (3-3)<br>
The distillation residue (crude 8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-ben2azepine<br>
as the free base from Example 7 was dissolved in acetone (0.400 kg). The resulting solution<br>
was drained and weighed to assay the 8-chloro-l-memyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine<br>
content by HPLC. Results of the assay were used to calculate charges of acetone, L-tartaric<br>
acid, and water. The quantities indicated below are typical for achievement of the target 8-<br>
chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-te1rahydro-lH-3-benzazepine: acetone : L-tartaric acid : water mole<br>
ratio of 1.00 : 9.6: 0.25 : 3.6 prior to addition of seed crystals. More acetone (1.415 Kg) was<br>
added to the reactor and the stirred reactor contents were heated to 47-52 °C. To the resulting<br>
solution was added a solution of L-tartaric acid (0.1223 kg, 0.815 mol, 0.219 equiv.) in purified<br>
water (0.211 kg) at a steady rate over 5-15 minutes. A thin suspension formed during the<br>
addition but then redissolved when the mixture temperature was reestablished at 50 °C.<br>
Hemitartrate seed crystals (0.80 g) were added to the 50 °C solution to initiate nucleation.<br>
Nucleation was allowed to continue for 2-3 h with agitation at 47-52 CC. Acetone (0.473 kg)<br>
was added to the reactor while the stirred reactor contents were maintained at 50 °C. The<br>
resulting suspension was cooled to 0-5 °C slowly over 3-5 h. Stirring was continued at 0 °C for<br>
another 1 -3 h. The resulting white precipitate was collected on a medium to fine filter element<br>
and then washed with a mixture of acetone (0.900 kg) and purified water (0.054 kg). The<br>
enantiomeric excess (ee) of the wet cake was determined.<br>
If the ee was 
a mixture of acetone (1.90 kg) and purified water (0.400 kg) at 55-60°C for 0.5-1 h. If<br>
dissolution had not been achieved after one hour, then water (approximately 0.160 kg) was<br>
added until a clear solution was achieved. The resulting mixture was then cooled to 0-5 °C<br>
slowly over 2-3 h. Stirring at 0 °C was continued for another 3-5 h. The resulting white<br><br>
precipitate was collected on a medium to fine filter element and then washed with acetone<br>
(0.400kg)at0-°C.<br>
The washed solid product (296 g wet) was dried at 60-65 °C for 15-20 h. The yield of<br>
8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepinium hemitartrate, with about 99.7% ee<br>
and 7.5 wt. % water content, was 295 g (27.1% based on racemic 2-chloro-N-4-<br>
chlorophenethyl)propan-l-amine hydrochloride and corrected for product water content).<br>

specified order, 8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepinium hemitartrate (1.00<br>
kg containing 7.5 wt % water, 1.71 mol, 0.500 eq), potassium carbonate (0.508 kg, 3.68 mol,<br>
1.076 eq), ethyl acetate (2.68 kg), and purified water (2.68 kg). The resulting mixture was<br>
stirred at 20-25 °C for 30-40 min, and then the phases were allowed to separate over 0.5-1 h.<br>
The lower (aqueous) phase was drained to waste disposal. Purified water (2.68 kg) was added<br>
to the reactor, and the resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 10-20 min. The phases were<br>
allowed to separate over 1-1.5 h. The lower (aqueous) phase was drained to waste disposal.<br>
With the reactor contents at a temperature of 40-45 °C, the solvent was removed by vacuum<br>
distillation at pressures felling from 153 torr to 46 torr. The residue was cooled to 20-25 °C.<br>
Ethyl acetate (3.81 kg) was charged to the reactor, and the distillation residue was dissolved<br>
with stirring. The water content of the resulting solution was verified by Karl Fischer analysis<br>
to be 
through the filter with ethyl acetate (2.33 kg) previously verified by Karl Fischer analysis to<br>
have

a steady rate over at least 1.5-2 h while the stirred reactor contents were maintained at 0-5 °C.<br>
The resulting suspension was stirred at 0-5 °C for 2 hours. The resulting white precipitate was<br>
collected on a medium to fine filter element. The reactor and then the filtered solid product<br>
were washed with ethyl acetate (1.33 kg). The wet cake (ca. 867 g) was dried under reduced<br>
pressure and 33-37 °C for 20 h or until the cake temperature had been stable for 4 h, whichever<br>
occurred first. The resulting (R)-8-chloro-l-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-lH-3-benzazepine<br>
hemihydrate hydrochloride (3.7 wt. % water content, 14.7% chloride content, <br><br>
