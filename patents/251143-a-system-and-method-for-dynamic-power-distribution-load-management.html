FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention in general relates to a power supply management system. More particularly this invention relates to a system and method for current controlled dynamic power / electricity supply / distribution load management system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Currently the fuse or M.C.B are used at the consumer termination and these are simply overload protection devices which will work when, a overload or a short circuit occurs at the load point. This fuse will blow or MCB will trip just before creating any damage to the distribution network.<br>
There is no control over the amount of the Power / Electricity supplied to the consumer. At any time, the maximum power the consumer can draw is only sanctioned and cannot be controlled. Consumers are not supposed to draw more than the sanctioned power but invariably since there is no control consumer ends up with drawing power erratically depending upon his requirement. This creates unplanned overload on the distribution network. Power / Electricity supplier can only manage the balancing of load with the available resources by the means of disconnecting complete power supply to some consumer at some time. This causes many difficulties to the consumer.<br>
In the present circumstances, with the available technology, it is impossible to allot a specific amount of power in a day or in a month at any given time and hence dynamic load management is next to impossible.<br>
When any short circuit occurs at the load end, the disconnection of the load from the distribution network is possible only be means of blowing up the fuses or<br><br>
tripping of the M.C.B. While disconnecting the load from the distribution network during fault condition creates disturbances on the distribution network.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the invention is to invent a novel system and method which shall overcome all the setbacks mentioned in the prior art.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent and design a novel method and system wherein the load mangement with the available resources is achieved by dynamically setting the amount of power a consumer is permitted to draw at any given time.<br>
It is another object of this invention to design a novel method of a re-settable fast acting switch to manage the power distribution. In this, the switch is designed to protect the gadgets by controlling the maximum current and voltage that can be fed to the gadget connected to the switch. In other words, if the current and voltage exceeds the set value with Inverse Definite Minimum Time Characteristics, the switch will disconnect the load instantaneously.<br>
The invention relates to a system and method of Power / Electricity supply / distribution to manage the load, with the available resources effectively. The main function of the system is the flexibility and control, the Power / Electricity supplier has on the power connection given to the consumer. This gives flexibility to Power / Electricity supplier to control the maximum power that can be drawn by the consumer at any given time in consultation with the consumer. In this method, a switch is provided and at the consumer terminal in such a way that the amount of current the consumer can draw is set in the switch at any given time. If the consumer exceeds the set value, the switch will disconnect automatically and the power supply will be stopped. Further, if the consumer reduces his load by switching off some of the load connected to the switch, the<br><br>
switch will reconnect the supply to the consumer automatically. The switch is also set to permit the consumer to draw a defined amount of current for a defined time, not exceeding the limit. This means every consumer can be allotted with a maximum amount of Ampere/Hour he can utilize. If the consumer exceeds his quota automatically the switch will disconnect the power to the consumer and reconnects automatically after the reconnection command. The switch is also set to disconnect the load from the distribution network if the load draws more than the current set in the switch. The switch is also designed wherein the current / voltage tolerance can be set. The switch disconnects the power so fast that the load is protected from getting damaged due to fault conditions as well as the distribution network will not be disturbed.<br>
Further, if any consumer bypasses the switch automatically this information is forwarded to the distribution station, wherein information gets stored in any storing device such as a computer. This information is made available only to the authorized persons with proper password.<br>
The invention further provides a method wherein the switch can be turned on or turned off by means of SMS, Internet, Power line and wireless etc. The switch can be used as a prepaid connection by providing a SIM card.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for dynamic power distribution load management comprising the steps of:<br>
7<br>
(a)	providing a switch at the consumer terminal;<br>
(b)	setting the amount of current the consumer can draw at any given time in the said switch using software written programmable current setting with / without IDMT characteristics;<br>
(c)	disconnecting the power supply automatically by the said switch if the consumer exceeds the set value;<br>
(d)	reconnecting the power supply automatically once the consumer reduces the load by switching off some of the load connected to the switch; and<br><br>
(e) providing a device at the distribution station to store and monitor the information of the consumer bypassing the switch.<br>
The switch is set to disconnect the load from the distribution network if the load draws more than the current set in the said switch. The switch is adapted to set the current / voltage tolerance. The said information of the consumer bypassing the switch is made available only to the authorized persons with proper password at the device at the distribution station.<br>
The said switch is capable to be turned on or turned off by means of SMS, Internet, Power line, wireless or used as a SIM card using programmed microcontroller module in the system.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for dynamic power distribution load management comprising:<br>
(a)	a switch at the consumer terminal;<br>
(b)	a means for setting the amount of current the consumer can draw at any given time in the said switch;<br>
(c)	a means for disconnecting the power supply automatically by the said switch if the consumer exceeds the set value;<br>
(d)	a means for reconnecting the power supply automatically once the consumer reduces the load by switching off some of the load connected to the switch; and<br>
(e)	a device at the distribution station to store and monitor the information of the consumer bypassing the switch.<br>
First in the said system the bi-directional supply is converted to a unidirectional supply using four diodes, D1, D2, D3 and D4. The said switch is a semiconductor switch which is made up of MOSFET or IGBT or ESBT or another semi-conductor device which is made on and off as per the command given by the circuit. The said switch can also be an electromagnetic relay which is closed<br><br>
or opened by giving supply to a coil. A high frequency source consisting of C1 and L1 which is connected across the junction point of D1, D3 and D2, D4. The said high-frequency signal is tapped from L2. The supply line is connected to junction of D1 and D3 and the load terminal is connected to junction of D2 and D4. The neutral is directly connected to the load. The power supply is connected to the supply terminals between neutral and the junction point of D1 and D3 where as the consumer gets power from the junction of D2 and D4 and the neutral. The current passing through the switch M1 is continuously monitored and the information is recorded in the controller. When the switch M1 is closed the current passes through, D1, M1 and D4 to the load in the positive cycle and the current passes through D2, M1 and D3 in the negative cycle. If M1 is opened, the circuit gets opened and the current stops flowing. At the time of opening the switch, the current is diverted through C2 and D5. When M1 is switched on, the charge on the capacitor C2 discharges through resistor R1 and the high frequency source through L1 and C1 is connected across the junction point of D1, D2, D3 and D4. The high frequency source circulates current through D1, M1 and D4 in positive cycle and D2, M1 and D3 in negative cycle and the signal is sensed and continuously transmitted to distribution sub-station through power line using L3, C3. The switch is capable of to be turned on or turned off by means of SMS, Internet, Power line, wireless or can be used in conjunction with SIM card using programmed microcontroller module where the current passing through the switch M1 is continuously monitored and the said information is recorded in the said controller.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings shows the basic circuit diagram of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, has a bi-directional supply made as unidirectional using four diodes, D1 to D4. The semi-conductor switch which can be a Mosfet, IGBT, ESBT or any other semi-conductor device which can be made on and off as per the command given by the circuit. This can also be an electromagnetic relay which can be closed or opened by giving supply to the coil, a high frequency source consisting of C1 and L1 which is connected across the junction point of D1, D3 and D2, D4. The high-frequency signal is tapped from L2. The supply line is connected to junction of D1 and D3. The load terminal is connected to junction of D2 and D4. The neutral is directly connected to the load. The Power / Electricity supply connects their supply terminals between neutral and the junction point of D1 and D3. The consumer gets power from the junction of D2 and D4 and the neutral.<br><br>
When the switch M1 is closed the current passes through, D1, M1 and D4 to the load in the positive cycle and the current passes through D2, M1 and D3 in negative cycle; if M1 is opened, automatically the circuit gets opened and the current stops flowing. At the time of opening the switch, the current is diverted through C2 and D5 which will reduce the voltage transient. When M1 is switched on, the charge on the capacitor C2 will discharge through resistor R1. The high frequency source through L1 and C1 is connected across the junction point of D1, D2, D3 and D4. This high frequency source circulates current through D1, M1 and D4 in positive cycle and D2, M1 and D3 in negative cycle. This signal is sensed and continuously is transmitted to distribution sub-station through power line using L3, C3. If the consumer shorts the input and output terminals, automatically the signal stops and in the sub-station, it is recorded from what time the switch is bypassed and the period. This data is made available to only auditors who would retrieve the same through password. Thus the Power / Electricity supply will make sure that under no circumstances the consumer can bypass the switch to tap the power illegally.<br>
The switch is set for various requirements depending upon Power / Electricity supply after taking consumer into confidence. So this switch can be set to deliver the prescribed current in a prescribed time. For example it can be set to deliver 2.5 Amps from morning 6:00 A.M to 6.00 P.M, 5 Amps from 6 P.M to 11 P.M and 10 Amps from 11 P.M to 6 A.M. If the current exceeds the set value during the above time automatically the switch will open. If the current is brought down by switching off some of the loads, automatically the switch reconnects the power to the consumer. During this period, there is no voltage transient due to diverter. The switch is designed to become inactive during starting of some of the loads which draws in-rush currents, by setting the device through inverse definite minimum time characteristics to avoid nuisance tripping. The switch also can be set to deliver total current in a day or in a month as the requirement arises. This switch also can be set to disconnect the load if the consumer exceeds the allotted   power.     Many  more  settings  can   be  set  using  software  based<br><br>
programmed microcontroller by using state of the art technology, it is possible to make the switch on and off; via SMS, PLCC, Internet, RF, etc.<br>
The current passing through the switch M1 is continuously monitored. This information is recorded in the controller. The controller is programmed according to the requirement. Once the current exceeds the set value the switch is switched off. Switching On or Off of the semiconductor device is achieved by giving / withdrawing sufficient voltage to the gate of the mosfet. The required power supply to power the controller is generated inside the circuit drawing power from mains.<br>
Under short circuit, the conduction voltage of M1 is sensed and if exceeds the set value automatically the voltage applied to the gate is removed.<br>
The said switch can be fitted / connected to a current metering device with minor alterations. Further, means can be provided in the switch for storage of information for the usage by the consumer. Additionally, the switch can include means to communicate data thus stored to be sent to the power supplier by remote access.<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different details of the different examples can in a purposeful way be combined with one another.<br>
This invention is however, susceptible to modifications and alternate constructions from that disclosed above which are fully equivalent. Consequently, it is not the intention to limit this invention to the particular embodiment disclosed.<br><br>
