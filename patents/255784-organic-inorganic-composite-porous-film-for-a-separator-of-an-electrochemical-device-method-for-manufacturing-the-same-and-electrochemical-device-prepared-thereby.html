				<td>Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a novel organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
that can show excellent thermal safety and lithium ion conductivity and a high degree<br>
of swelling with electrolyte compared to conventional polyolefin-based separators, and<br>
an electrochemical device comprising the same, which ensures safety and has<br>
improved quality.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Recently, there is an increasing interest in energy storage technology. Batteries<br>
have been widely used as energy sources in portable phones, camcorders, notebook<br>
computers, PCs and electric cars, resulting in intensive research and development into<br>
them. In this regard, electrochemical devices are subjects of great interest. Particularly,<br>
development of rechargeable secondary batteries is the focus of attention.<br>
[3]	Secondary batteries are chemical batteries capable of repeated charge and<br>
discharge cycles by means of reversible interconversion between chemical energy and<br>
electric energy, and may be classified into Ni-MH secondary batteries and lithium<br>
secondary batteries. Lithium secondary batteries include lithium secondary metal<br>
batteries, lithium secondary ion batteries, lithium secondary polymer batteries, lithium<br>
secondary ion polymer batteries, etc.<br>
[4]	Because lithium secondary batteries have drive voltage and energy density higher<br>
than those of conventional batteries using aqueous electrolytes (such as Ni-MH<br>
batteries), they are produced commercially by many production companies. However,<br>
most lithium secondary batteries have different safety characteristics depending on<br>
several factors. Evaluation of and security in safety of batteries are very important<br>
matters to be considered. Therefore, safety of batteries is strictly restricted in terms of<br>
ignition and combustion in batteries by safety standards.<br>
[5]	Currently available lithium ion batteries and lithium ion polymer batteries use<br>
polyolefin-based separators in order to prevent short circuit between a cathode and an<br>
anode. However, because such polyolefin-based separators have a melting point of 200<br>
°C or less, they have a disadvantage in that they can be shrunk or molten to cause a<br>
change in volume when the temperature of a battery is increased by internal and/or<br><br>
external factors. Therefore, there is a great possibility of short-circuit between a<br>
cathode and an anode caused by shrinking or melting of separators, resulting in<br>
accidents such as explosion of a battery caused by emission of electric energy. As a<br>
result, it is necessary to provide a separator that does not cause heat shrinking at high<br>
temperature.<br>
[6]	To solve the above problems related with polyolefin-based separators, many<br>
attempts are made to develop an electrolyte using an inorganic material serving as a<br>
substitute for a conventional separator. Such electrolytes may be broadly classified into<br>
two types. The first type is a solid composite electrolyte obtained by using inorganic<br>
particles having lithium ion conductivity alone or by using inorganic particles having<br>
lithium ion conductivity mixed with a polymer matrix. See, Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
No. 2003-022707, ['Solid State fonics'-vol.158, n.3, p.275, (2003)], ['Journal of Power<br>
Sources'-vol.m, n.1, p.209, (2002)], ['Electrochimica Acta'-vol.48, n.14, p.2003,<br>
(2003)], etc. However, it is known that such composite electrolytes are not advisable,<br>
because they have low ion conductivity compared to liquid electrolytes and the in-<br>
terfacial resistance between the inorganic materials and the polymer is high while they<br>
are mixed.<br>
[7]	The second type is an electrolyte obtained by mixing inorganic particles having<br>
lithium ion conductivity or not with a gel polymer electrolyte formed of a polymer and<br>
liquid electrolyte. In this case, inorganic materials are introduced in a relatively small<br>
amount compared to the polymer and liquid electrolyte, and thus merely have a sup-<br>
plementary function to assist in lithium ion conduction made by the liquid electrolyte.<br>
[8]	However, because electrolytes prepared as described above have no pores therein<br>
or, if any, have pores with a size of several angstroms and low porosity, formed by in-<br>
troduction of an artificial plasticizer, the electrolytes cannot serve sufficiently as<br>
separator, resulting in degradation in the battery quality.<br>
Disclosure<br>
[9]	We have found that an organic/inorganic composite porous film, formed by using<br>
(1) inorganic particles and (2) a binder polymer, improves poor thermal safety of a<br>
conventional polyolefin-based separator. Additionally, we have found that because the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous film has a micropore structure formed by the<br>
inorganic particles present in the film, it provides an increased volume of space into<br>
which a liquid electrolyte infiltrates, resulting in improvements in lithium ion con-<br>
ductivity and degree of swelling with electrolyte. Therefore, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film can improve the quality and safety of an electrochemical device<br><br>
using the same as separator.<br>
[10]	Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film capable of improving the quality and safety of an elec-<br>
trochemical device, a method for manufacturing the same and an electrochemical<br>
device comprising the same.<br>
[11]	According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous film, which comprises (a) inorganic particles; and (b) a<br>
binder polymer coating layer formed partially or totally on the surface of the inorganic<br>
particles, wherein the inorganic particles are interconnected among themselves and are<br>
fixed by the binder polymer, and interstitial volumes among the inorganic particles<br>
form a micropore structure. There is also provided an electrochemical device<br>
(preferably, a lithium secondary battery) comprising the same.<br>
[12]	According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
for manufacturing an organic/inorganic composite porous film, which includes the<br>
steps of: (a) dissolving a binder polymer into a solvent to form a polymer solution; (b)<br>
adding inorganic particles to the polymer solution obtained from step (a) and mixing<br>
them; and (c) coating the mixture of inorganic particles with binder polymer obtained<br>
from step (b) on a substrate, followed by drying, and then detaching the substrate.<br>
[13]	Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
[14]	The present invention is characterized in that it provides a novel organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film, which serves sufficiently as separator to prevent electrical<br>
contact between a cathode and an anode of a battery and to pass ions therethrough and<br>
shows excellent thermal safety, lithium ion conductivity and degree of swelling with<br>
electrolyte.<br>
[15]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film is obtained by using inorganic<br>
particles and a binder polymer. The uniform and heat resistant micropore structure<br>
formed by the interstitial volumes among the inorganic particles permits the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous film to be used as separator. Additionally, if a polymer<br>
capable of being gelled when swelled with a liquid electrolyte is used as the binder<br>
polymer component, the organic/inorganic composite porous film can serve also as<br>
electrolyte.<br>
[16]	Particular characteristics of the organic/ inorganic composite porous film are as<br>
follows.<br>
[17]	(1) The organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present invention<br>
shows improved thermal safety by virtue of the inorganic particles present therein.<br><br>
[18]	In other words, although conventional polyolefin-based separators cause heat<br>
shrinking at high temperature because they have a melting point of 120-140 °C , the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous film comprising the inorganic particles and binder<br>
polymer does not cause heat shrinking due to the heat resistance of the inorganic<br>
particles. Therefore, an electrochemical device using the above organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film as separator causes no degradation in safety resulting from an<br>
internal short circuit between a cathode and an anode even under extreme conditions<br>
such as high temperature, overcharge, etc. As a result, such electrochemical devices<br>
have excellent safety characteristics compared to conventional batteries.<br>
[19]	(2) Conventional solid electrolytes formed by using inorganic particles and a<br>
binder polymer have no pore structure or, if any, have an irregular pore structure<br>
having a pore size of several angstroms. Therefore, they cannot serve sufficiently as<br>
spacer, through which lithium ions can pass, resulting in degradation in the quality of a<br>
battery. On the contrary, the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the<br>
present invention has uniform micropore structures formed by the interstitial volumes<br>
among the inorganic particles as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, and the micropore structures<br>
permit lithium ions to move smoothly therethrough. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
introduce a large amount of electrolyte through the micropore structures so that a high<br>
degree of swelling with electrolyte can be obtained, resulting in improvement in the<br>
quality of a battery.<br>
[20]	(3) It is possible to control the pore size and porosity of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film by varying the particle diameter of the inorganic particles and<br>
the mixing ratio of the inorganic particles with the polymer. The micropore structure is<br>
subsequently filled with a liquid electrolyte so that the interfacial resistance generating<br>
among the inorganic particles or between the inorganic particles and the binder<br>
polymer can be reduced significantly.<br>
[21]	(4) When the inorganic particles used in the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
film have a high dielectric constant and/or lithium ion conductivity, the inorganic<br>
particles can improve lithium ion conductivity as well as heat resistance, thereby con-<br>
tributing to improvement of battery quality.<br>
[22]	(5) When the binder polymer used in the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
is one showing a high degree of swelling with electrolyte, the electrolyte injected after<br>
assemblage of a battery can infiltrate into the polymer and the resultant polymer<br>
containing the electrolyte infiltrated therein has a capability of conducting electrolyte<br>
ions. Therefore, the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present<br><br>
invention can improve the quality of an electrochemical device compared to con-<br>
ventional organic/inorganic composite electrolytes. Additionally, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film provides advantages in that wettability with an electrolyte is<br>
improved compared to conventional hydrophobic polyolefin-based separators, and use<br>
of a polar electrolyte for battery is permitted.<br>
[23]	(6) Finally, if the binder polymer is one capable of being gelled when swelled with<br>
electrolyte, the polymer reacts with the electrolyte injected subsequently and is gelled,<br>
thereby forming a gel type organic/inorganic composite electrolyte. Such electrolytes<br>
are produced with ease compared to conventional gel-type electrolytes and show<br>
excellent ion conductivity and a high degree of swelling with electrolyte, thereby con-<br>
tributing to improve the quality of a battery.<br>
[24]	One component present in the organic/inorganic composite porous film according<br>
to the present invention is inorganic particles currently used in the art. The inorganic<br>
particles permit interstitial volumes to be formed among them, thereby serving to form<br>
micropores and to maintain the physical shape as spacer. Additionally, because the<br>
inorganic particles are characterized in that their physical properties are not changed<br>
even at a high temperature of 200 °C or higher, the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
film using the inorganic particles can have excellent heat resistance.<br>
[25]	There is no particular limitation in selection of inorganic particles, as long as they<br>
are electrochemically stable. In other words, there is no particular limitation in<br>
inorganic particles that may be used in the present invention, as long as they are not<br>
subjected to oxidation and/or reduction at the range of drive voltages (for example, 0-5<br>
V based on Li/Li+) of a battery, to which they are applied. Particularly, it is preferable<br>
to use inorganic particles having ion conductivity as high as possible, because such<br>
inorganic particles can improve ion conductivity and quality in an electrochemical<br>
device. Additionally, when inorganic particles having a high density are used, they<br>
have a difficulty in dispersion during a coating step and may increase the weight of a<br>
battery to be manufactured. Therefore, it is preferable to use inorganic particles having<br>
a density as low as possible. Further, when inorganic particles having a high dielectric<br>
constant are used, they can contribute to increase the dissociation degree of an<br>
electrolyte salt in a liquid electrolyte, such as a lithium salt, thereby improving the ion<br>
conductivity of the electrolyte.<br>
[26]	For these reasons, it is preferable to use inorganic particles having a high dielectric<br>
constant of 5 or more, preferably of 10 or more, inorganic particles having lithium con-<br>
ductivity or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[27]	Particular non-limiting examples of inorganic particles having a dielectric constant<br>
of 5 or more include BaTiO3 , Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), Pb 1-x Lax Zr1-y Tiy O3 (PLZT),<br><br>
PB(Mg3 Nb2/3 )O3 -PbTiO3 (PMN-PT), hafnia (HfO2), SrTiO3, SnO2, CeO2, MgO, NiO,<br><br>
CaO, ZnO, ZrO2 , Y2 O3 , Al2O3 , TiO2 , SiC or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[28]	As used herein, 'inorganic particles having lithium ion conductivity' are referred to<br>
as inorganic particles containing lithium elements and having a capability of<br>
conducting lithium ions without storing lithium. Inorganic particles having lithium ion<br>
conductivity can conduct and move lithium ions due to defects present in their<br>
structure, and thus can improve lithium ion conductivity and contribute to improve<br>
battery quality. Non-limiting examples of such inorganic particles having lithium ion<br>
conductivity include: lithim phosphate (Li3PO4 ), lithium titanium phosphate (LixTiy (PO<br><br>
4)3, 0<x lithium aluminum titanium phosphate></x><br>
y
<br>
-39P2O5, lithium lanthanum titanate (LixLayTiO3, 0<x lithium germanium></x><br>
thiophosphate (LixGeyPzSw , 0<x such as li3.25 ge0.25p0.75s4></x><br>
,lithium nitrides(LixNy, 0<x such as li3n sis2 type glass></x><br>
0<y such as li3po4 p2s5 type glass ysz></y><br>
7) such as LiI-Li2S-P2S5 , or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[29]	According to the present invention, inorganic particles having a relatively high<br>
dielectric constant are used instead of inorganic particles having no reactivity or<br>
having relatively low dielectric constant. Further, the present invention also provides a<br>
novel use of inorganic particles as separators.<br>
[30]	The above-described inorganic particles, mat have never been used as separators,<br>
for example Pb(Zr,Ti)O (PZT), Pb1-xLax Zr 1-y Tiy O3 (PLZT), Pb(Mg3 Nb 2/3)O3 -<br><br>
PbTiO3 (PMN-PT), hafnia (HfO2), etc., have a high dielectric constant of 100 or more.<br><br>
The inorganic particles also have piezoelectricity so that an electric potential can be<br>
generated between both surfaces by the charge formation, when they are drawn or<br>
compressed under the application of a certain pressure. Therefore, the inorganic<br>
particles can prevent internal short circuit between both electrodes, thereby con-<br>
tributing to improve the safety of a battery. Additionally, when such inorganic particles<br>
having a high dielectric constant are combined with inorganic particles having lithium<br>
ion conductivity, synergic effects can be obtained.<br>
[31]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present invention<br>
can form pores having a size of several micrometers by controlling the size of<br>
inorganic particles, content of inorganic particles and the mixing ratio of inorganic<br><br>
particles and binder polymer. It is also possible to control the pore size and porosity.<br>
[32]	Although there is no particular limitation in size of moronic particles, inorganic<br>
particles preferably have a size of 0.001-10 µm for the purpose of forming a film<br>
having a uniform thickness and providing a suitable porosity. When the size is less<br>
than 0.001 µm , inorganic particles have poor dispersibility so that physical properties<br>
of the organic/inorganic composite porous film cannot be controlled with ease. When<br>
the size is greater than 10 µm, the resultant organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
has an increased thickness under the same solid content, resulting in degradation in<br>
mechanical properties. Furthermore, such excessively large pores may increase a<br>
possibility of internal short circuit being generated during repeated charge/discharge<br>
cycles.<br>
[33]	The inorganic particles are present in the mixture of the inorganic particles with<br>
binder polymer forming the organic/inorganic composite porous film, preferably in an<br>
amount of 50-99 wt%, more particularly in an amount of 60-95 wt% based on 100<br>
wt% of the total weight of the mixture. When the content of the inorganic particles is<br>
less than 50 wt%, the binder polymer is present in such a large amount as to decrease<br>
the interstitial volume formed among the inorganic particles and thus to decrease the<br>
pore size and porosity, resulting in degradation in the quality of a battery. When the<br>
content of the inorganic particles is greater than 99 wt%, the polymer content is too<br>
low to provide sufficient adhesion among the inorganic particles, resulting in<br>
degradation in mechanical properties of a finally formed organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous film.<br>
[34]	Another component present i n the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention is a binder polymer currently used in the art. The<br>
binder polymer preferably has a glass transition temperature (T )g as low as possible,<br><br>
more preferably Tg of between -200 °C and 200 °C. Binder polymers having a low Tg<br><br>
as described above are preferable, because they can improve mechanical properties<br>
such as flexibility and elasticity of a finally formed film. The polymer serves as binder<br>
that interconnects and stably fixes the inorganic particles among themselves, and thus<br>
prevents degradation in mechanical properties of a finally formed organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film.<br>
[35]	When the binder polymer has ion conductivity, it can further improve the quality of<br>
an electrochemical device. However, it is not essential to use a binder polymer having<br>
ion conductivity. Therefore, the binder polymer preferably has a dielectric constant as<br>
high as possible. Because the dissociation degree of a salt in an electrolyte depends on<br><br>
the dielectric constant of a solvent used in the electrolyte, the polymer having a higher<br>
dielectric constant can increase the dissociation degree of a salt in the electrolyte used<br>
in the present invention. The dielectric constant of the polymer may range from 1.0 to<br>
100 (as measured at a frequency of 1 kHz), and is preferably 10 or more.<br>
[36]	In addition to the above-described functions, the binder polymer used in the<br>
present invention may be further characterized in that it is gelled when swelled with a<br>
liquid electrolyte, and thus shows a high degree of swelling. Therefore, it is preferable<br>
to use a polymer having a solubility parameter of between 15 and 45 MPa , more<br>
preferably of between 15 and 25 MPa1 , and between 30 and 45 MPa . Therefore, hy-<br>
drophilic polymers having a lot of polar groups are more preferable than hydrophobic<br>
polymers such as poly olefins. When the binder polymer has a solubility parameter of<br>
less than 15 Mpa or greater than 45 Mpa , it has difficulty in swelling with a con-<br>
ventional liquid electrolyte for battery.<br>
[37]	Non-limiting examples of the binder polymer that may be used in the present<br>
invention include polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride-co-trichloroethylene, polymethylmethacrylate, polyacrylonitrile,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate, polyethylene<br>
oxide, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, cya-<br>
noethylpullulan, cyanoethyl polyvinylalcohol, cyanoethylcellulose, cyanoethylsucrose,<br>
pullulan, carboxymetyl cellulose, acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer,<br>
polyimide or mixtures thereof. Other materials may be used alone or in combination,<br>
as long as they satisfy the above characteristics.<br>
[38]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film may further comprise additives other<br>
than the inorganic particles and binder polymer.<br>
[39]	When the organic/inorganic composite porous film is manufactured by using<br>
inorganic particles and a binder polymer, the film may be realized by three types of<br>
embodiments, but is not limited thereto.<br>
[40]	The first type is an organic/inorganic composite porous film formed by using a<br>
mixture of inorganic particles and binder polymer with no additional substrate. The<br>
second type is an organic/inorganic composite porous film formed by coating the<br>
mixture on a porous substrate having pores, wherein the film coated on the porous<br>
substrate includes an active layer obtained by coating the mixture of inorganic particles<br>
and binder polymer on the surface of the porous substrate or on a part of the pores in<br>
the substrate. The third type is an organic/inorganic composite porous film formed by<br>
coating the mixture on a cathode and/or an anode. The third type is a monolithic<br><br>
electrode and film.<br>
[41]	In the second embodiment of the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention, there is no particular limitation in the substrate<br>
coated with the mixture of inorganic particles and binder polymer, as long as it is a<br>
porous substrate having pores. However, it is preferable to use a heat resistant porous<br>
substrate having a melting point of 200 °C or higher. Such heat resistant porous<br>
substrates can improve the thermal safety of the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
film under external and/or internal thermal impacts. Non-limiting examples of the<br>
porous substrate having a melting point of 200 °C or higher that may be used include<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyester, polyacetal,<br>
polyamide, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyetherether ketone, polyether sulfone,<br>
polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene sulfidro, polyethylene naphthalene or mixtures<br>
thereof. However, other heat resistant engineering plastics may be used with no<br>
particular limitation.<br>
[42]	Although there is no particular limitation in thickness of the porous substrate, the<br>
porous substrate preferably has a thickness of between 1 µm and 100 µm, more<br>
preferably of between 5 µm and 50 µm . When the porous substrate has a thickness of<br>
less than 1 µm , it is difficult to maintain mechanical properties. When the porous<br>
substrate has a thickness of greater than 100 µm , it may function as resistance layer.<br>
[43]	Although there is no particular limitation in pore size and porosity of the porous<br>
substrate, the porous substrate preferably has a porosity of between 5% and 95%. The<br>
pore size (diameter) preferably ranges from 0.01µm to 50 µm, more preferably from 0.1<br>
µm to 20µm. When the pore size and porosity are less than 0.01 µm and 5%, re-<br>
spectively, the porous substrate may function as resistance layer. When the pore size<br>
and porosity are greater than 50 µm and 95%, respectively, it is difficult to maintain<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
[44]	The porous substrate may take the form of a membrane or fiber. When the porous<br>
substrate is fibrous, it may be a nonwoven web forming a porous web (preferably,<br>
spunbond type web comprising long fibers or melt blown type web).<br>
[45]	A spunbond process is performed continuously through a series of steps and<br>
provides long fibers formed by heating and melting, which is stretched, in turn, by hot<br>
air to form a web. A melt blown process performs spinning of a polymer capable of<br>
forming fibers through a spinneret having several hundreds of small orifices, and thus<br>
provides three-dimensional fibers having a spider-web structure resulting from inter-<br>
connection of microfibers having a diameter of 10 µm or less.<br><br>
[46]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film that may be formed in various types<br>
of embodiments according to the present invention is characterized in that the film<br>
comprises a micropore structure. First, the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
formed by using the mixture of inorganic particles and polymer alone has a micropore<br>
structure formed by interstitial volumes among the inorganic particles serving as<br>
support as well as spacer. Next, the organic/inorganic composite porous film formed<br>
by coating the mixture on a porous substrate has pore structures present both in the<br>
substrate and in the active layer due to the pores present in the porous substrate itself<br>
and interstitial volumes among the inorganic particles in the active layer formed on the<br>
substrate. Finally, the organic/inorganic composite porous film obtained by coating the<br>
mixture on the surface of an electrode has a uniform pore structure formed by in-<br>
terstitial volumes among the inorganic particles in the same manner as the pore<br>
structure formed by electrode active material particles in the electrode. Therefore, any<br>
embodiment of the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present<br>
invention has an increased volume of space, into which an electrolyte infiltrates, by<br>
virtue of such micropore structures. As a result, it is possible to increase dispersibility<br>
and conductivity of lithium ions, resulting in improvement in the quality of a battery.<br>
[47]	The pore size and porosity of the organic/inorganic composite porous film mainly<br>
depend on the size of inorganic particles. For example, when inorganic particles<br>
having a particle diameter of 1 µmor less are used, pores formed thereby also have a<br>
size of 1 µm or less. The pore structure is filled with an electrolyte injected sub-<br>
sequently and the electrolyte serves to conduct ions. Therefore, the size and porosity of<br>
the pores are important factors in controlling the ion conductivity of the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous film. Preferably, the pores size and porosity of the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present invention range from<br>
0.01 to 10 µm. and from 5 to 95%, respectively.<br>
[48]	There is no particular limitation in thickness of the organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous film according to the present invention. The thickness may be controlled<br>
depending on the quality of a battery. According to the present invention, the film<br>
preferably has a thickness of between 1 and 100 µm, more preferably of between 2 and<br>
30 µm. Control of the thickness of the film may contribute to improve the quality of a<br>
battery.<br>
[49]	There is no particular limitation in mixing ratio of inorganic particles to polymer in<br>
the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present invention. The<br>
mixing ratio can be controlled according to the thickness and structure of a film to be<br><br>
formed finally.<br>
[50]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film may be applied to a battery together<br>
with a microporous separator (for example, a polyolefin-based separator), depending<br>
on the characteristics of a finally formed battery.<br>
[51]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film may be manufactured by a con-<br>
ventional process known to one skilled in the art. One embodiment of a method for<br>
manufacturing the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present<br>
invention, includes the steps of: (a) dissolving a binder polymer into a solvent to form<br>
a polymer solution; (b) adding inorganic particles to the polymer solution obtained<br>
from step (a) and mixing them; and (c) coating the mixture obtained from step (b) on<br>
the surface of a substrate, followed by drying, and then detaching the substrate.<br>
[52]	Hereinafter, the method for manufacturing the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
film according to the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
[53]	(1) First, a binder polymer is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent to provide a<br>
polymer solution.<br>
[54]	It is preferable that the solvent has a solubility parameter similar to that of the<br>
binder polymer to be used and a low boiling point. Such solvents can be mixed<br>
uniformly with the polymer and can be removed easily after coating the polymer. Non-<br>
limiting examples of the solvent that may be used include acetone, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, N-mnethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),<br>
cyclohexane, water and mixtures thereof.<br>
[55]	(2) Next, inorganic particles are added to and dispersed in the polymer solution<br>
obtained from the preceding step to provide a mixture of inorganic particles with<br>
binder polymer.<br>
[55]	It is preferable to perform a step of pulverizing inorganic particles after adding the<br>
inorganic particles to the binder polymer solution. The time needed for pulverization is<br>
suitably 1-20 hours. The particle size of the pulverized particles ranges preferably from<br>
0.001 and 10 µm. Conventional pulverization methods, preferably a method using a ball<br>
mill may be used.<br>
[57]	Although there is no particular limitation in composition of the mixture containing<br>
inorganic particles and binder polymer, such composition can contribute to control the<br>
thickness, pore size and porosity of the organic/inorganic composite porous film to be<br>
formed finally.<br>
[58]	In other words, as the weight ratio (I/P) of the inorganic particles (I) to the polymer<br>
(P) increases, porosity of the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the<br><br>
present invention increases. Therefore, the thickness of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film increases under the same solid content (weight of the inorganic<br>
particles + weight of the binder polymer). Additionally, the pore size increases in<br>
proportion to the pore formation among the inorganic particles. When the size (particle<br>
diameter) of inorganic particles increases, interstitial distance among the inorganic<br>
particles also increases, thereby increasing the pore size.<br>
[59]	(3) The mixture of inorganic particles with binder polymer is coated on a substrate,<br>
followed by drying, and then the substrate is detached to provide the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film.<br>
[60]	Particular examples of the substrate that may be used include Teflon sheets or the<br>
like generally used in the art, but are not limited thereto.<br>
[61]	In order to coat the porous substrate with the mixture of inorganic particles and<br>
binder polymer, any methods known to one skilled in the art may be used. It is possible<br>
to use various processes including dip coating, die coating, roll coating, comma<br>
coating or combinations thereof.<br>
[62]	In this step, when the substrate is a porous substrate having pores or a preformed<br>
electrode, various types of organic/inorganic composite porous films can be obtained.<br>
The mixture of inorganic particles and polymer may be coated on the surface of porous<br>
substrate, on the surface of electrode, and on a part of the pores present in the<br>
substrate. In this step, the step of detaching a substrate may be omitted.<br>
[63]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present invention,<br>
obtained as described above, may be used as separator in an electrochemical device,<br>
preferably in a lithium secondary battery. Additionally, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film may be coated with a conventional polymer (for example, a<br>
polymer capable of being swelled with an electrolyte) on one surface or both surfaces<br>
so as to be used as separator.<br>
[64]	If the binder polymer used in the film is a polymer capable of being gelled when<br>
swelled with a liquid electrolyte, the polymer may react with the electrolyte injected<br>
after assembling a battery by using the separator, and thus be gelled to form a gel type<br>
organic/inorganic composite electrolyte.<br>
[65]	The gel type organic/inorganic composite electrolyte according to the present<br>
invention is prepared with ease compared to gel type polymer electrolytes according to<br>
die prior art, and has a large space to be filled with a liquid electrolyte due to its mi-<br>
croporous structure, thereby showing excellent ion conductivity and a high degree of<br>
swelling with electrolyte, resulting in improvement in the quality of a battery.<br><br>
[66]	Further, the present invention provides an electrochemical device comprising: (a) a<br>
cathode; (b) an anode; (c) the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to<br>
the present invention, interposed between the cathode and anode; and (d) an<br>
electrolyte.<br>
[67]	Such electrochemical devices include any devices in which electrochemical<br>
reactions occur and particular examples thereof include all kinds of primary batteries,<br>
secondary batteries, fuel cells, solar cells or capacitors. Particularly, the elec-<br>
trochemical device is a lithium secondary battery including a lithium secondary metal<br>
battery, lithium secondary ion battery, lithium secondary polymer battery or lithium<br>
secondary ion polymer battery.<br>
[68]	According to the present invention, the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
contained in the electrochemical device serves as separator. If the polymer used in the<br>
film is a polymer capable of being gelled when swelled with electrolyte, the film may<br>
serve also as electrolyte.<br>
[69]	In addition to the above organic/inorganic composite porous film, a microporous<br>
separator may also be used. Particular examples of the microporous separator that may<br>
be used includes currently used polyolefin-based separators or at least one porous<br>
substrate having a melting point of 200 °C , selected from the group consisting of<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyester, polyacetal,<br>
polyamide, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyetherether ketone, polyether sulfone,<br>
polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene sulfidro and polyethylene naphthalene.<br>
[70]	The electrochemical device may be manufactured by a conventional method<br>
known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment of the method for manufacturing<br>
the electrochemical device, the electrochemical device is assembled by using the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous film interposed between a cathode and an anode,<br>
and then an electrolyte is injected.<br>
[71]	The electrode that may be applied together with the organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous film according to the present invention may be formed by applying an electrode<br>
active material on a current collector according to a method known to one skilled in<br>
the art. Particularly, cathode active materials may include any conventional cathode<br>
active materials currently used in a cathode of a conventional electrochemical device.<br>
Particular non-limiting examples of the cathode active material include lithium in-<br>
tercalation materials such as lithium manganese oxides, lithium cobalt oxides, lithium<br>
nickel oxides, lithium iron oxides or composite oxides thereof. Additionally, anode<br>
active materials may include any conventional anode active materials currently used in<br><br>
an anode of a conventional electrochemical device. Particular non-limiting examples<br>
of the anode active material include lithium intercalation materials such as lithium<br>
metal, lithium alloys, carbon, petroleum coke, activated carbon, graphite or other car-<br>
bonaceous materials. Non-limiting examples of a cathode current collector include foil<br>
formed of aluminum, nickel or a combination thereof. Non-limiting examples of an<br>
anode current collector include foil formed of copper, gold, nickel, copper alloys or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
[72]	The electrolyte that may be used in the present invention includes a salt<br>
represented by the formula of A B , wherein A represents an alkali metal cation<br>
selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na+, K+ and combinations thereof, and B<br>
represents an anion selected from the group consisting of PF6- , BF4- , Cl-, Br-, I, ClO4- ,<br><br>
AsF6 -, CH3CO2-, CF3SO3-, N(CF3SO2)2-, C(CF2SO2)3- and combinations thereof, the<br><br>
salt being dissolved or dissociated in an organic solvent selected from the group<br>
consisting of propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate<br>
(DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), dipropyl carbonate (DPC), dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, diethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), gamma-butyrolactone<br>
(GBL) and mixtures thereof. However, the electrolyte that may be used in the present<br>
invention is not limited to the above examples.<br>
[73]	More particularly, the electrolyte may be injected in a suitable step during the man-<br>
ufacturing process of an electrochemical device, according to the manufacturing<br>
process and desired properties of a final product. In other words, electrolyte may be<br>
injected, before an electrochemical device is assembled or in a final step during the<br>
assemblage of an electrochemical device.<br>
[74]	Processes that may be used for applying the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
film to a battery include not only a conventional winding process but also a lamination<br>
(stacking) and folding process of a separator and electrode.<br>
[75]	When the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the present<br>
invention is applied to a lamination process, it is possible to significantly improve the<br>
thermal safety of a battery, because a battery formed by a lamination and folding<br>
process generally shows more severe heat shrinking of a separator compared to a<br>
battery formed by a winding process. Additionally, when a lamination process is used,<br>
there is an advantage in that a battery can be assembled with ease by virtue of excellent<br>
adhesion of the polymer present in the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention. In this case, the adhesion can be controlled<br><br>
depending on the content of inorganic particles and polymer, and properties of the<br>
polymer. More particularly, as the polarity of the polymer increases and as the glass<br>
transition temperature (T g) or melting point (Tm ) of the polymer decreases, higher<br><br>
adhesion between the organic/inorganic composite porous film and electrode can be<br>
obtained.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[84]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention. It is to be understood that the following examples are illustrative only and<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
[85]	Reference Example. Variations in ion conductivity depending on<br>
content of inorganic particles<br><br>
[86]	The organic/inorganic composite system according to the present invention was<br>
observed to determine variations in ion conductivity depending on the content of<br>
inorganic particles.<br>
[87]	The organic/inorganic composite film according to the present invention was<br>
dipped into the electrolyte formed of ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate/diethyl<br>
carbonate (EC/PC/DEC= 30:20:50 on the basis of wt%) containing 1M lithium hex-<br>
afluorophosphate (LiPF6 ) dissolved therein. The film, into which the electrolyte is im-<br><br>
pregnated, was measured for ion conductivity by using Metrohm 712 instrument at a<br>
temperature of 25 °C.<br>
[88]	As shown in FIG. 7, as the content of inorganic particles increases, ion con-<br>
ductivity also increases. Particularly, when 50 wt% or more of inorganic particles are<br>
used, ion conductivity increases significantly.<br>

50 °C for about 12 hours or more to form a polymer solution. To the polymer solution<br>
obtained as described above, BaTiO powder having a particle diameter of about 400<br>
nm was added with the concentration of 20 wt% on the total solid content basis, and<br>
then dispersed to form a mixed solution (BaTiO 3/PVDF-HFP= 80:20 (weight ratio)).<br><br>
Then, the mixed solution obtained as described above was coated on a Teflon sheet by<br>
using a doctor blade coating method. After coating, THF was dried and the Teflon<br>
sheet was detached to obtain a final organic/inorganic composite porous film (see,<br>
FIG. 1). The final film had a thickness of about 30 µm. After measuring with a<br>

and lithium secondary battery comprising the same, except that LiTi2 (PO4)3 and<br><br>
PVDF-HFP were used in a weight ratio of 10:90. After measuring the LiTi2(PO4)3 /<br><br>
PVdF-HFP with a porosimeter, the final organic/inorganic composite porous film had<br>
a pore size of 0.01 µm or less and a porosity of about 5%.<br>
[124]	Comparative Example 4. Manufacture of porous film using<br>
plasticizer<br>
[125]	Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was selected as plasticizer and used along with PVdF-<br>
HFP in a ratio of 30:70 (on the wt% basis) and THF as solvent to form a porous film.<br>

same. After measuring the porous PVdF-HFP film with a porosimeter, the porous film<br>
had a pore size of 0.01 µm or less and a porosity of about 30% (see, FIG. 4).<br>
[126]	Experimental Example 1. Surface analysis of organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film<br>
[127]	The following test was performed to analyze the surface of an organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film according to the present invention.<br>
[128]	The sample used in this test was PVdF-HFP/BaTiO obtained according to<br>
Example 1. As controls, a PP/PE/PP separator according to Comparative Example 1<br>
and the porous film using a plasticizer according to Comparative Example 4 were<br>
used.<br>
[129]	When analyzed by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), the PP/PE/PP<br>
separator according to Comparative Example 1 and the porous film according to<br>
Comparative Example 4 showed a conventional microporous structure (see, FIGs. 3<br>
and 4). More particularly, the porous film according to Comparative Example 4 had a<br>
dense pore structure formed independently from the inorganic particles present on the<br>
surface of the film. It is thought that the dense pore structure is formed by artificial<br>
extraction of the plasticizer.<br>
[130]	On the contrary, the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the<br><br>
present invention showed a micropore structure formed by the inorganic particles as<br>
main component of the film (for example, inorganic particles with a high dielectric<br>
constant and/or lithium ion conductivity). Additionally, it could be seen that the<br>
polymer was coated on the surface of the inorganic particles (see, FIG. 2).<br>
[131]	Experimental Example 2. Evaluation of heat shrinkage of organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous film<br>
[132]	The following experiment was performed to compare the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film with a conventional separator.<br>
[133]	The organic/inorganic composite porous film (PVdF-CTFE/BaTiO ) according to<br>
Example 1 was used as sample. A conventional PP/PE/PP separator and PE separator<br>
were used as controls.<br>
[134]	Each of the test samples was checked for its heat shrinkage after stored at a high<br>
temperature of 150 °C for 1 hour. The test samples provided different results after the<br>
lapse of 1 hour at 150 °C. The PP/PE/PP separator as control was shrunk due to high<br>
temperature to leave only the outer shape thereof. Similarly, the PE separator was<br>
shrunk to about 1/10 of its original size. On the contrary, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film according to the present invention showed good results with no<br>
heat shrinkage (see, FIG. 5)<br>
[135]	As can be seen from the foregoing, the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention has excellent thermal safety.<br>
[136]	Experimental Example 3. Evaluation for safety of lithium<br>
secondary battery<br>
[137]	The following test was performed to evaluate the safety of each lithium secondary<br>
battery comprising the organic/inorganic composite porous film according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
[138]	Lithium secondary batteries according to Examples 1-9 were used as samples. As<br>
controls, used were the battery using a currently used PP/PE/PP separator according to<br>
Comparative Example 1, the battery using the BaTiO3/PVdF-HFP film (weight ratio=<br><br>
20:80 on the wt% basis) as separator according to Comparative Example 2, and the<br>
battery using the LiTi2(PO4)3/PVdF-HFP film (weight ratio= 10:90 on the wt% basis)<br><br>
as separator according to Comparative Example 3.<br>
[139]	3-1. Hot box test<br>
[140]	Each battery was stored at high temperatures of 150 °C and 160 °C for 1 hour and<br>
then checked. The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
[141]	After storing at high temperatures, the battery using a currently used PP/PE/PP<br><br>
separator according to Comparative Example 1 caused explosion when stored at 160<br>
°C for 1 hour. This indicates that polyolefin-based separators cause extreme heat<br>
shrinking, melting and breakage when stored at high temperature, resulting in internal<br>
short circuit between both electrodes (i.e., a cathode and an anode) of a battery. On the<br>
contrary, lithium secondary batteries comprising an organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous film according to the present invention showed such a safe state as to prevent<br>
firing and burning even at a high temperature of 160 °C (see, Table 1).<br>
[142]	Therefore, it can be seen that the lithium secondary battery comprising an organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous film according to the present invention has excellent<br>
thermal safety.<br>
[143] <br>
[144]	3-2. Overcharge test<br>
[145]	Each battery was charged under the conditions of 6V/1A and 10V/1A and then<br>
checked. The results are shown in the following Table 2.<br>
[146]	After checking, the battery using a currently used PP/PE/PP separator according to<br>
Comparative Example 1 exploded (see, FIG. 6). This indicates that the polyolefin-<br>
based separator is shrunk by overcharge of the battery to cause short circuit between<br>
electrodes, resulting in degradation in safety of the battery. On the contrary, each<br>
lithium secondary battery comprising an organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention showed excellent safety under overcharge<br>
conditions (see, Table 2 and FIG. 6).<br>
[147]	[Table 2]<br><br><br><br>
[148]	Experimental Example 4. Evaluation for quality of lithium se<br>
condary battery<br>
[149]	The following tests were performed in order to determine the charge/discharge<br>
capacity of each lithium secondary battery comprising an organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous film according to the present invention.<br>
[150]	Lithium secondary batteries according to Examples 1-9 were used as samples. As<br>
controls, used were the battery using a currently used PP/PE/PP separator according to<br>
Comparative Example 1, the battery using the BaTiO3/PVdF-HFP film (weight ratio=<br>
20:80 on the wt% basis) as separator according to Comparative Example 2, the battery<br>
using the LiTi2 (PO4)3/PVdF-HFP film (weight ratio= 10:90 on the wt% basis) as<br><br>
separator according to Comparative Example 3, and the battery using the porous<br>
PVdF-HFP film obtained by using a plasticizer as separator according to Comparative<br>
Example 4.<br>
[151]	Each battery having a capacity of 760 mAh was subjected to cycling at a discharge<br>
rate of 0.5C, 1C and 2C. The following Table 3 shows the discharge capacity of each<br>
battery, the capacity being expressed on the basis of C-rate characteristics.<br>
[152]	After performing the test, the battery according to Comparative Examples 2 using,<br>
as separator, an organic/inorganic composite porous film that includes a mixture<br>
containing inorganic particles with a high dielectric constant and a binder polymer in a<br>
ratio of 20:80 (on the wt% basis) and the battery according to Comparative Examples 3<br>
using, as separator, an organic/inorganic composite porous film that includes a mixture<br>
containing inorganic particles with lithium ion conductivity and a binder polymer in a<br>
ratio of 10:90 (on the wt% basis), showed a significant drop in capacity depending on<br>
discharge rates, as compared to the batteries using, as separators, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film obtained from the above Examples according to the present<br>
invention and a conventional polyolefin-based separator (see, Table 3). This indicates<br><br>
that such relatively low amount of inorganic particles compared to the polymer may<br>
decrease the pore size and porosity in the pore structure formed by interstitial volume<br>
among the inorganic particles, resulting in degradation in the quality of a battery. Ad-<br>
ditionally, the battery using the porous film having a pore structure artificially formed<br>
by using a plasticizer as separator according to Comparative Example 4 also showed a<br>
significant drop in capacity depending on discharge rates in the same manner as the<br>
batteries according to Comparative Examples 2 and 3.<br>
[153]	On the contrary, lithium secondary batteries comprising the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous film according to the present invention showed C-rate characteristics<br>
comparable to those of the battery using a conventional polyolefin-based separator<br>
under a discharge rate of up to 2C (see, Table 3).<br>
[154] <br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[155]	As can be seen from the foregoing, the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention comprises inorganic particles and a binder polymer,<br>
wherein the inorganic particles are interconnected among themselves and fixed by the<br>
binder polymer and interstitial volumes among the inorganic particles form a heat<br>
resistant micropore structure. Therefore, it is possible to increase the space to be filled<br>
with an electrolyte, and thus to improve a degree of swelling with electrolyte and<br>
lithium ion conductivity. As a result, the organic/inorganic composite porous film<br>
according to the present invention contributes to improve the thermal safety and<br>
quality of a lithium secondary battery using the same as separator.<br>
[156]	While this invention has beqn described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the drawings. On the<br>
contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and variations within the spirit<br><br>
