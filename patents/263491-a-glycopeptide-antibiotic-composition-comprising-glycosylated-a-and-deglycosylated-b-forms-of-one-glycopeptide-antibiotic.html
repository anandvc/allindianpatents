				<td>The present invention relates to a glycopeptide antibiotic composition comprising glycosylated (A) and deglycosylated (B) forms of one glycopeptide antibiotic.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a glycopeptide composition with improved antibiotic activity, use thereof as a pharmaceutical, and a method for producing a glycopeptide composition with improved antibiotic activity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Glycopeptide antibiotics can be classified in four groups based on their chemical structure:<br>
Group I (or the vancomycin type) has aliphatic amino acids at positions 1 and 3; Group II (or the avoparcin type) has aromatic amino acid residues at positions 1 and 3; Group III (or the ristocetin type) is similar to group II but for an ether linkage joining the aromatic amino acids at positions 1 and 3; and<br>
Group IV (or the Tdcoplaain type) has the same amino add arrangement as group HI plus a fatty add residue attached to the amino sugar. (Yao, R.C. and Crandall, L.W., Glycopeptides, Classification, Occurrence, and Discovery in Glycopeptide antibiotics, ed. Nagarajan, R., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y, N.Y., Chapter 1, pp. 1-27 (1994)).<br>
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Actinoplanes teicomyeeticus and was discovered during a scientific research program aiming to find new molecules of microbial origin mat inhibited bacterial cell wall synthesis. (Goldstein, B. et al, Teicoplanin in Glyoopeptide Antibiotics, ed. Nagarajan, R., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y, NX, Chapter 8, pp. 273-307 (1994)). ft was first described m 1978 and ten years later it was introduced into clinical practice in Italy. (Parenti, F. et al, J. Chemotherapy, Vol 12, pp. 5-14, (2000)).<br>
Teicoplanin shares many chemical and microbiological characteristics with vancomycin, but it possesses higher activity against many Gram-positive bacteria and is less nephrotoxic. (Parenti, supra; Janknegt, R., (1991), Teicoplanin in Perspective, Pharmaceutisch Weekblad Scientific Edition, 13:153-160).<br>
The molecular structure of Teicoplanin is depicted in Figure 1. like all glycopeptide antibiotics, Teicoplanin contains a core linear heptapeptide, in which five of the seven amino adds are common to all the members ofits group. The remaining two (positions 1 and 3) are linked together by an ether bond, (Yao,supra). Three sugar moieties are attached to the aryl<br>
groups of amino acids 7,6 and 4, namely a D-mannose, an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and an<br>
N-acyl-D-glucosamine, respectively. These sugars have no biological activity in vitro, but have been found to impart different pharmacokinetic properties. (Reynolds P. E., Eur. J. Clin. MicrobioL Infect. Dis., Vol. 8, No. 11, pp. 943-950, (1989)).<br>
Teicoplanin comprises different components, including five closely related molecules denoted Teicoplanin A2-1 (TA2-1) to Teicoplanin A2-5 (TA2-5), which differ only in the nature of the acyl moiety (Cio and Cu fatty acids); RS-1 to RS-4; a more polar component Teicoplanin A3-1 (TA3-1), which lacks the N-acyl-D-glucosamine residue and Teicoplanin TA3-2, which also lacks the D-mannose group. Substitution of the sugar residues with hydrogens results hi the core aglycone, which is considered as a Teicoplanin A3 component. The molecular structures of the different components are shown in Figure 2 herein.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,239,751 to Coronelli et al. describe isolation of different Teicoplanin components. Also illustrated in Table IV therein is that TA3 has a lower antibiotic activity than TA2.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,994,555 to Panzone et al. describes recovery of Teicoplanin from aqueous solutions from fermentation broths. Panzone et al. further describes "[a]s employed in its biological application Teicoplanin essentially consists of factor A2 (T-A2) accompanied by minor amount of factor A3 (T-A3)". (Column 2, lines 51-53).<br>
Coronelli et al.: 'Teicoplanin: Chemical, Physico-chemical and Biological Aspects", in Farmaco, Edizione Scientifica (1987), 42 (10), 767-86, state that a typical teicoplanin production batch contains no more than 12% TA3-1 and about 10% water.<br>
Malabarba et al.: "Teicoplanin, Antibiotics from Actinoplanes Teichomyceticus nov. sp, Journal of Antibiotics 1984 Japan, vol. 37, no. 9,1984,988-999, states that they, starting from teicoplanin, prepared a crude material (intermediate composition) which contained 74% TA3-1 and 16% TA3-2 (HPLC).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It has been unexpectedly discovered that a positive synergistic effect of increased antibiotic activity of a Teicoplanin composition can be obtained by using a proper ratio of the amounts of TA2 and TA3 in the composition. It is known in the art that relatively pure TA3 has lower antibiotic activity than TA2. Contrary to the teaching in the art, it was found that within a certain window of %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2), it was possible to make a Teicoplanin composition with improved antibiotic activity due to a synergistic effect of TA2 and TA3 in the composition. By adding increasing amounts of TA3 to get an increased TA3:TA2 ratio, the antibiotic activity can greatiy be unproved. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is contemplated that this synergistic effect is common the group of glycopeptide antibiotics that share a common mode of action, i.e. inhibit a late stage in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis (cf. Reynolds in Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. November 1989, p. 943-950).<br>

The term TA2 is a standard short name for Teicoplanin A2. Herein, this term comprises Teicoplanin having three carbohydrate moieties, such as the five closely related molecules denoted Teicoplanin A2-1 (TA2-1) to Teicoplanin A2-5 (TA2-5) and RS-1 to RS-4. Also, the term TA2 comprises derivatives thereof, such as derivatives that have been altered in the substituent R (see Figure 1). Examples on R are given in the prior art and are known to the skilled person. Examples on molecular structures of different TA2 components are shown in Figure 1 and 2 herein. Specifically, the term TA2 denotes herein the Teicoplanin components selected from the group consisting of Teicoplanin A2-1 (TA2-1) to Teicoplanin A2-5 (TA2-5) and RS-1 to RS-4, or the term denotes the sum of two or more Teicoplanin components with three carbohydrate moieties, such as the sum. of the 2, 3,4,5,6, 7 or more of the most predominant Teicoplanins (with three carbohydrate moieties) in the composition. More preferably the term TA2 denotes herein the Teicoplanin components selected from the group consisting of Teicoplanin A2-1 (TA2-1) to Teicoplanin A2-5 (TA2-5), such as only the Teicoplanin component TA2-2, or the sum of these, i.e. the Teicoplanin A2 group (A2-1 + A2-2 + A2-3 + A2-4 + A2-5). More specifically, TA2 represents the sum: A2-1 + A2-2 + A2-3 + A2-4 + A2-5.<br>
The term TA3 is a standard short name for Teieoplanin A3. Herein, this term comprises Teicoplanin components having two (e.g. TA3-1), one (e.g. TA3-2) or no carbohydrate moieties (e.g. Teicoplanin aglycone), either individually or in combination (e.g. the amount of all Teicoplanins having two or less carbohydrate moieties or the sum of TA3-1<br>
and TA3-2). Specifically, the term TA3 denotes herein only the Teicoplanin component<br>
TA3-1. The molecular structures of TA3-1 and TA3-2 are shown in Figures 1 and 2 herein.<br>
The specific amounts of TA3 and TA2 (or other glycopeptides, derivatives thereof and deglycosylated moieties of these) in a composition can be determined by any suitable means; for example by known analytical techniques such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Briefly, such an HPLC analysis comprises the following steps: (i) having a suitable sample solution of a specified amount of the composition, (ii) performing the HPLC test with a suitable amount of the sample solution according to suitable standard operating conditions, and measuring the peak area of TA2 and the peak area of TA3 by a suitable automatic integration method. A suitable HPLC-analysis protocol is provided in Example 1 herein.<br>
As used herein, "glycopeptide composition", such as "Teicoplanin composition" is inclusive of any salt forms, solvates (including hydrates), and derivatives. Derivatives include esters and/or ethers of any or all of the free hydroxy or phenol groups of the Teicoplanin component. Other derivatives may include alkyiated, acylated, or acetylated amino group of the sugar moiety. Detailed description of such salt forms, derivatives, etc. are provided herein.<br>
As mentioned, it was found that within a certain window of %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2), it was possible to make a Teicoplanin composition with improved antibiotic activity due to a positive synergistic effect of TA2 and TA3 in the composition. Figure 3 illustrates an example of the improvement in antibiotic activity of a Teicoplanin composition. The commercial Teicoplanin product TARGOCID was used as a reference composition. Based on a standard in the art known HPLC analysis of TARGOCIti it was determined that TARGOCID has a %(mg TA3-l)/(mg TA3-1 + TA2) of around 6.5%. (TARGOCID is a commercial Teicoplanin product from Aventis Pharma, and the determined ratio of 6.5% complies with the Official Japanese Monograph for Teicoplanin (JP Ministry of Health), which states that a teicoplanin composition must comprise not less than 80.0% A2 components (A2-1 to A2-5), not more than 15.0% A3 components (A3-1), and "other" not more than 5.0%, calculated as disclosed in the monograph). The data of Figure 3 shows that by the addition of TA3-1 to various compositions it was possible to make a Teicoplanin composition with, higher antibiotic activity than TARGOCID. As shown, the graphs include a point for the commercially available TARGOCID. The graphs further include graphs of two Teicoplanin materials wherein the amount of TA3-1 was added in varying amounts to<br>
show the synergistic effect. The TA2-2 graph illustrates the addition of TA3-1 to purified<br>
TA2-2. Again a positive synergistic effect result. More specifically, within the range of %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) from about 6.75% to ahout 60% the tested compositions had a clearly higher antibiotic activity than TARGOCID.<br>
The Teicoplanin composition may comprise about 18 weight percent to about 40 weight percent TA3 based on the total of weight of TA3 and TA2 as measured by HPLC analysis. In one embodiment, the Teicoplanin composition comprises %(milligram (nig) TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 20 % to about 40%, measured by HPLC analysis, more specifically the Teicoplanin composition comprises %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 23 % to about 40%, measured by HPLC analysis, even more specifically the Teicoplanin composition comprises %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 24 % to about 40% and yet more specifically the Teicoplanin composition comprises %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) hi the range from about 25 % to about 40%. Other examples of ranges applicable for the ratio of the deglycosylated glycopeptide in the compositions as defined herein have a value selected from about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14%, about 15%, about 16%, about 17%, about 18%, about 19%, about 20%, about 21%, about 22%, about 23%, about 24%, about 25%, about 26%, about 27%; about 28%; about 29%, about 30%; about 31%; about 32%; about 33%; about 34%; about 35%; about 45%; about 50%; about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, or about 80%, all values described herein can be combined freely to form ranges.<br>
The Teicoplanin composition can comprise more than about 600 mg dry matter of active TA2 and TA3 components per gram (g) of dry matter of the composition, specifically more than about 700 mg dry matter,of active TA2 and TA3 components, and more specifically more than about 800 mg dry matter of active TA2 and TA3 components.<br>
Preparation of the Teicoplanin composition can be made in a relatively large amount in. order to provide the Teicoplanin composition as a so-called bulk product. Such a bulk product can be used to make several individual pharmaceutical Teicoplanin compositions. Accordingly, the Teicoplanin composition can have a total weight of the composition of at least about 100 g, more specifically of at least about 500 g. The individual pharmaceutical composition can have a content of about Img to about 1000 mg of Teicoplanin.<br>
As explained above, the commercial Teicoplanin pharmaceutical composition TARGOCID has been used as a reference in experimental examples described herein. Based on the TA2 and TA3 identified synergistic effects, the present inventors were routinely able<br>
to prepare compositions with a better antibiotic activity than TARGOCID, which was determined to have a %(mg TA3-l)/(mg TA3-1 + TA2) of 6.5% as measured by HPLC-analysis.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment a Teicoplanin composition as described herein, has a higher antibiotic activity than a corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5% where the antibiotic activity is measured by a microbiological agar diffusion assay using Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 as test strain and the measured potential potency (IU per mg TA2 + TA3/g composition) is used to calculate the antibiotic activity.<br>
The logic behind the potential potency (tU per mg TA2 + TA3) unit may be illustrated by looking at Table 3 herein. Here it can be seen that the antibiotic potency is measured for the composition as such (lU/mg composition). Since the amounts of TA2 and TA3 of the composition also is known it is possible to calculate the potential potency (IU per mg TA2 + TA3) as shown in Table 3.<br>
The potential potency of the Teicoplanin composition, as described herein, can be at least about 5 IU higher than the corresponding Teicoplanin composition mat has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5%, more specifically it is at least about 30 IU higher than the corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5%, even more specifically it is at least about 50 IU higher than the corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5%, yet more specifically it is at least about 100 IU higher than the corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5%, and still yet more specifically it is at least about 150 IU higher than the corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(ing TA3 +    -TA2) of 6.5%. Under some circumstances it may be difficult to get more than 1000 IU higher activity.<br>
The term "corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5%," should be understood as a standard reference composition in the sense that, beside the specific TA3 + TA2 amounts, it should comprise the same components, salt and etc. as the Teicoplanin composition which is evaluated hi relation to its a better antibiotic activity.<br>
Any and all of the glycopeptides, deglycosylated glycopeptides and derivatives of these, such as Teicoplanin components, may be converted into salts, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and derivatives, such as esters and ethers, and other chemical equivalents,<br>
which, within a glycopeptide composition, such as a Teicoplanin composition, as described<br>
herein, are all covered by the present invention. The salts and derivatives can be prepared by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art Salts like sodium and potassium salts, for example, may be prepared by treating the glycopeptides, deglycosylated glycopeptides and derivatives of these, such as Teicoplanin components, with suitable sodium or potassium bases.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include metal salts such as sodium salt, potassium salt, secium salt and the like; or alkaline earth metals such as calcium salt, magnesium salt and the like.<br>
Esters and ethers may be prepared by the methods given in the literature, for example, in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 388-389,395-396 (1992). Suitable esters and ethers include Q-Ci2 straight or branched chain alkyl, Ca-Cu cycloalkyl, and/or Ce-Cae aryl. "Aryl" as used herein means a compound having the ring structure characteristic of benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and the like, for example phenyl (CeH) or naphthyl (CioH?). The alkyl or aryl group may be unsubstituted or substituted with hydroxyl, Ce-Cae aryl, Ca-Ce cycloalkyl, Ci-Cu alkyl, halogen (i.e., F, Cl, Br, I), Ci-Ciz alkoxy, Ci-Cn alkyltbio, Ci-Cnperfluoroalkyl, Cs-Caeperfluoroaryl, pyridyl, cyano, nitro, amino, Ci-Cu alkylamino, Ci-Ci2 aminoalkyl, acyl, amido, and/or carbamoyl. The amino group of the sugar moiety can be alkylated, acylated, or acetylated, e.g. with acid chlorides by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art. Suitable alkyl and acyl groups comprise those groups described above for ester and ether.<br>
Chemical equivalents may be stable complexes with metal ions, e.g. transition, metals like La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd 3+, which are typical for tetramic acid derivatives and may be prepared by the methods given in the literature (K. Tanaka et. al., Chem. Pharm. Bull!, Vol. 27,1901 (1979); K. Matsuo, Chem. Pharm. Bull., Vol. 28,2494, (1980)).<br>
The double bonds of the alkyl side chain (R) may be reduced by the methods given in the literature, for example in P. N. Rylander, "Hydrogenation Methods", Academic Press, New York Cb.pt. 2, (1985), or may be hydrohalogenated by methods described by H. 0. House in "Modern Synthetic Reactions", W. A. Benjymin, Inc., New York, pp 446-452, (1972). Hydroxylated derivatives may be produced by reaction of the double bonds with reagents such as OsC^ as described in the literature, e.g. Chem. Rev. Vol. 80,187 (1980).<br>
Derivatives may also be formed by conversion of the double bonds into epoxides by oxidation, e.g. with MCPBA, as described in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 826 (1992).<br>

Glycopeptide compositions, such as Teicoplanin compositions, are useful for the treatment of a microorganism infection in a patient, such as an infection with Gram-positive bacteria, in particular staphylococcal bacteria including metbicillin-resistant strains. Other Gram-positive bacterial infections that may be treated with the compositions described herein include those caused by streptococci, enterococci, and the like. The term "patient" relates to an animal, such as a mammal, including a human patient In one embodiment, it is a human.<br>
i<br>
patient A pharmaceutical composition, as described herein, can be administered to animals, such as mammals, including humans, as pharmaceuticals on their own, in. mixtures with another active ingredient, and in the form of pharmaceutical compositions that permit parenteral administration.<br>

Accordingly, on average, the daily dose of a glycopeptide composition, such as a Teicoplanin pharmaceutical composition, in a patient may be from about 0.05 mg / kilogram (kg) weight to about 50 mg / kg weight, more preferably from about 1 mg / kg weight to about 20 mg / kg weight.<br>
A method for rngkrog a Teicoplanin composition with improved antibiotic activity comprises:<br>
(i)       making two or more Teicoplanin compositions comprising different %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 5 % to about 60%, measured by HPLC analysis;<br>
(ii)      analyzing the antibiotic activity of the compositions; (iii)     identifying a composition where there is a synergistic effect of TA2 and TA3<br>
and which have a desired improved antibiotic activity.<br>
The global idea behind this method relates to the herein-identified synergistic effect of TA2 and!A3.<br>
In step (i) is made two or more Teicoplanin composirion(s) comprising different %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 7.5 % to about 50%, more specifically in step (i) is made two or more Teicoplanin composition(s) comprising different %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 15 % to about 40%, even more specifically in step (i) is made two or more Teicoplanin composition(s) comprising different %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 20 % to about 40%, and yet more specifically in step (i) is made two or more Teicoplanin composition^) comprising different %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) in the range from about 21 % to about 40%, In one embodiment, four or more of the different Teicoplanin compositions are made hi step (i).<br>
In another embodiment the identified composition of step (iii), has a higher antibiotic activity than a corresponding Teicoplanin composition that has a %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of 6.5%, wherein the antibiotic activity is measured by a microbiological agar diffusion assay using Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 as test strain and the measured potential potency (IU per mg TA2 + TA3/g composition) is used to calculate Ihe antibiotic activity. The assay and potential potency can be made as described above.<br>
The method for making a Teicoplanin composition can further comprises:<br>
(iv)     making a Teicoplanin pharmaceutical composition, comprising an effective<br>
amount of Teicoplanin components or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of the pharmaceutical composition is a % that corresponds to the % of the identified composition of step (iii).<br>
The term "corresponds" hi this step (iv) should be understood quite broadly in the sense that the specific %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2) of the pharmaceutical composition may vary some with respect to the identified composition of step (iii). The % of the identified composition may be the optimal % with respect to antibiotic activity. However, the skilled person may choose to slightly modify this in a specific Teicoplanin composition for different reasons such as, for example, production economy.<br>
The Teicoplanin pharmaceutical composition of step (iv) above can be a Teicoplanin composition having the characteristic of a Teicoplanin composition of the first aspect and related embodiments of the present invention as described previously.<br>
A separate aspect of the invention relates to a Teicoplanin composition as described herein that has been obtained fay a method for making a Teicoplanin composition as described herein. It can be determined by one of ordinary skill hi the art without undue experimentation different strategies for making Teicoplanin compositions comprising different %(mg TA3)/(mg TA3 + TA2). One exemplary method is to purify TA3 from a commercial Teicoplanin composition and use this purified TA3 to enrich a Teicoplanin composition of interest to make a composition with increased amounts of TA3.<br>
In another example, TA2 may be transformed by hydrolysis into TA3, where the N-acyl-D-glucosamine group with the fatty acid tail is removed from the glycopeptide base structure (see Figure 1 herein). In an exemplary embodiment, the hydrolysis is performed with the crude Teicoplanin product obtained from a fermentation process. The hydrolysis can be acidic, basic or enzymatic, such as carried out by means of acid treatment (presently preferred under mild conditions) and enzymes. Another exemplary way to obtain a Teicoplanin composition as described herein would be to adjust the fermentation conditions hi a way that will give higher TA3 amounts in the fermentation product.<br>
Accordingly, a separate aspect of the invention relates to a method for producing a Teicoplanin composition comprising TA2 and TA3, which is enriched with TA3 (compared to starting material), the method comprising hydrolysis of a composition containing TA2, such as a composition comprising TA2 and TA3 (such as a composition (starting material)<br><br>
having a ratio TA3/(TA2-KTA3) (w/w) of more than about 0.01; about 0.03; about 0.05; about<br>
0.07; about 0.08; about 0.09; about 0.10; or even more than about 0.11 or about 0.12), e.g. by treatment with an acid or an enzyme. The end product can be targeted to have a ratio lower than about 80%. The hydrolysis can be performed on a crude Teicoplanin composition obtained from fermentation, without separation of the Teicoplanin components TA2 and/or TA3. The hydrolysis can be carried out under mild conditions, such as under conditions where pH is higher than 0, such as higher than about 1, or about 2, or even higher than about 3. When the hydrolysis is carried out as an acidic hydrolysis, it is presently contemplated mat the hydrolysis is carried out at a pH value between 0 and about 5, or by using hydrochloric acid at a concentration between about 0.1 N and 1N. The Teicoplanin can be dissolved in a polar organic solvent (such as an alcohol) or a mixture herewith with water during the hydrolysis. An optional step of the method for producing the Teicoplanin composition comprises mixing of a composition comprising TA3 and/or TA2 with the hydrolysis product, in order to obtain a standardized Teicoplanin composition. The added composition itself may be produced by hydrolysis or by fermentation. Advantageously, the hydrolysis of TA2 into TA3 should be partially complete (e.g. not full hydrolysis of all TA2), in order to directly obtain a Teicoplanin composition having a desired ratio TA3/(TA2+TA3).<br>
Li a further aspect, a Teicoplanin composition is obtainable by the methods described above. The obtainable composition can have a ratio TA3/(TA2+TA3) (w/w) of less than about 0.95 (such as less than about 0.9; about 0.8; about 0.7; about 0.6; about 0.5; about 0,4 or even less than about 0,35) and a ratio TA3/(TA2+TA3) (w/w) of more than 0.05 (such as more than 0.07; 0.08,0.09; 0.10; 0.11; 0.12; 0.13; 0.14; 0.15; 0.16; 0.17; 0.18; 0.19; 0.20; 0.21; 0.22; 0,23 or even more than 0.25). The above ratios are also applicable for other compositions of the invention, calculated as B/(A+B) (w/w). In one embodiment, the ratio TA3/(TA2+TA3) (w/w) in the Teicoplanin composition is higher than 5% but lower than 90%; and the ratio TA3/(TA2+TA3) (w/w) is different from 6.5% (e.g. outside the range 6.25% to 6.75%, or outside the range 6% to 7%) as well as different from 10% (e.g. outside the range 9.75% to 10.25%, or outside the range 9.5% to 10,5%) as well as different from 15 to 20 percent (e.g. outside the range 14,75% to 20.25%, or outside the range 14.5% to 20.5 %). TA3 can specifically be TA3-1 and/or TA2 can be the sum: (TA2-1 + TA2-2 + TA2-3 + TA2-4 + TA2-5),<br>

Purification of Teicoplanin A3-1.<br>
To prepare a crude product with increased content of TA3-1 (Alpharma produced), Teicoplanin TA2 in 50% ethanol solution was converted by acid hydrolysis (1M HC1 was added, resulting pH=0.6) at elevated temperatures to a crude mixture of TA2 and TA3 (including TA3-2 and the T-aglycone) and freeze dried.<br>
To prepare pure TA3-1, the material from Xinchang Pharma was purified by preparative reversed phase C18 HPLC. The resulting solution was purified by normal phase HPLC to remove excess salt and dried to form a powder. The identity of the components was. confirmed by flow injection analysis liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (FIA-LC-MS).<br>
Purification of Teicoplanin A2-2.<br>
Pure TA2-2 component was prepared by utilizing the same methods as for TA3-1.<br>
Procedure for the HPLC analysis for the determination of activity.<br>
The HPLC method routinely used in the down stream process laboratory is as follows:<br>
Column:         Waters Xterra® RP18,3.5 [an, 4.6 x 150 mm Precolumn:    Waters Xterra® KP18 Guard column, 5 urn, 3.9 x 20 mm Column oven: 28°C<br><br>
Buffer:	0.2 % ammonium formate, pH 7.0<br>
4.0 g ammonium formate was dissolved in approximately 2 liters (1) of Milli-Q water. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 withNHj. and the total volume was adjusted to accurately 2.01 with Milli-Q water. The buffer was filtered through a 0.45 um filter before use.<br>
Mobile phase: Eluent A:       90 % buffer<br>
10 % acetonitrile (ACM) Eluent B:       35% buffer 65%ACN<br>
The mobile phase gradient for the HPLC analysis is presented in Table 2 with time in minutes (min) and flow hi milliliters per minute (ml/min).<br>
Table 2.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
refers to a linear gradient and 11 refers to a delayed step gradient The detection of the components was made using a UV detector at 280 nanometers (nm).<br>
HPLC Standard: TARGOCID, 0.210 g/1.<br>
Ten to 200 ul, corresponding to 2.1-42 |4,g Teicoplanin A2, was injected for a 5-point calibration curve, recorded in the beginning of the sequence and after every SO* sample. Variance in the response (- the total area of the five TA2 components) up to -+/- 3 % was accepted. Variance in retention time up to 10 % was also accepted.<br>
Preparation of downstream samples.<br>
Liquid samples were diluted with 25 mM HEPES-buffer, pH 7, until approximately 0.25 - 2 g/1 and 20pl of the diluted sample were injected. Solutions used for potency determinations were prepared and 20ul directly injected.<br>
Powders were weighed, approximately 25 mg, into a 25 ml measuring flask and dissolved hi 25 mM HEPES-buffer, pH 7 and 20 ul were injected.<br>
Preparation of HEPES-buffer: 2.98 g HEPES was dissolved in approximately 450 ml<br>
of Milli-Q water. pH was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH. The total volume was adjusted to accurately 500 ml with Milli-Q water.<br>
The chromatograms were automatically integrated in. range of 3 to 13 minutes by "valley to valley baseline" in the Waters Millenium software and the areas of the defined peaks TA3-1, TA2-1, TA2-2, TA2-3, TA2-4 and TA2-5 were recorded. All mass calculations (mg activity/g powder) were performed automatically by the software utilizing the calibration curve for TA2 and the sequence information about the weight of the samples and the dilutions. The combined area of the five TA2 components was used for calculations of the content of mg TA2/g powder. To calculate the content of TA3-1 the area of that peak was multiplied by a factor of 0.83 to compensate for the lower molecular weight of TA3-1. The percentage distribution of TA3-1 and TA2 was manually calculated by dividing the respective mass of TA3-1 and TA2 respectively by the total mass, i.e. mg(TA3-l) / mg(TA3-1 + TA2).<br>
Procedure for the Determination of Microbiological Potency by Agar Diffusion<br>
Potency of Teicoplanin TA2, TA3-1 alone or in combination was determined by agar diffusion assays. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect of pure and spiked products was investigated through the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by a modified "MIC" test in micro titer trays.<br>
The potency test is carried out according to the assay described below. The assay method generally corresponds to USP 25 and PLEur 4th ed., but differs from bom with respect to test strain and from the USP with respect to agar holes (ponds) as preferred to cylinders. The test is carried out as a 2,2 design as described in section  of the USP.<br>
Materials and specific equipment:<br>
Media:	Antibiotic nutrient agar (Difco) art: 0001-01-8.<br>
Buffer:	0.2M phosphate buffer, pH 8.0<br>
Test organism:	Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 or BacUlus subtilis ATCC<br>
6633.<br>
Antibiotic standard:	Working standard calibrated against the USP standard and<br>
Ph.Eur. standard.	Alternatively USP or Ph JEur. ref. standard.<br>
Large plates:	Glass with aluminium frame (28.5 x 28.5 cm).<br>
Stock solutions of standards and samples were prepared to approximately 900 lU/ml. The Teicoplanin standard contained approximately 25.0 mg in 4.0 ml water and buffer ad<br>
25.0 ml. The samples of Teicoplanin compositions contained approximately 25.0 mg in 4.0ml<br>
water and buffer ad 25.0 ml. The amount of sample was adjusted according to the actual amount of standard weighed. Finally, the standard and sample were diluted with buffer to the following concentrations:<br>
2-point assay:<br>
Solution 1 High:	approx. 400 lU/ml<br>
Solution 2 Low:	approx. 100 lU/ml<br>
The standard or sample was applied to the plates in accordance with an 8 x 8 Latin square design. Immediately after application, place the plates in the incubator at 34,0°C ± 2°C, for 16-18 hours.<br>
The results are analyzed by reading the zone diameters carefully with a lOx magnification and a precision of 0.1 mm. Statistical evaluation: for calculation and validation, follow the guidelines set out in Ph. Eur. and USP, using a computer program for all calculations.<br>
m the spiking experiments, the amount of the investigated sample (amount of powder weighed) was reduced and replaced by a corresponding amount of spiking material or stock solutions were mixed in defined ratios.<br>
Determination of MIC values and Results.<br>
Pure TA3-1, (Teicoplanin Material B 96% TA2-X, 4% TA3-1) and mixtures thereof were used. The test strain used was S, aureus ATCC 6538 in final concentrations of 5xl05/ml and 5xl04/ml respectively. The test was carried out in micro titer trays as a modification of an ordinary MIC test. Instead of using two-fold dilutions, 0.40-1.20 ug/ml with 0.20 ul divisions and 1.0-4.0 ul/ml with 1.0 ul divisions was used. The trays were incubated at 37°C. The wells were examined after 24 hours and any visible growth was noted. The "MIC" value was defined as the lowest Teicoplanin concentration that did not show visible growth.<br>
A series of spiking experiments with different levels of TA3-1 were performed and the potency of the resulting mixtures was determined by agar diffusion. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
TA2 is the total content of TA2-1 to TA2-5, and TA3 is the content of TA3-1.<br>
All spiking experiments clearly revealed a syneigistic effect of TA3-1 in the potency tests by agar diffusion. In order to strengthen the evidence some experiments were performed with a modified antimicrobial analysis of Teicoplanin, spiked with different amounts of TA3-1. It was carried out in. liquid medium in contrast to the agar diffusion tests and determined the MIC values. The results are summarized in Table 4, ("MIC"-values of Teicoplanin and /or TA3-1 on S.aureus ATCC6538).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results from this study indicate a much lower potency of TA3-1 (570 KJ/mg powder) than that of TA2-2 (807 lU/mg). Just adding the effect of the content of A3-1 in high potency products would thus not by itself explain the higher potency. The only reasonable explanation would be that TA3 in combination with TA2 in the appropriate amounts adds a synergistic effect.<br>
.   In this study different amounts of TA3 were added to a range of different Teicoplanhi products, including the purified TA2-2 single component, with variable microbial potencies alone. Replacing from 5 to 25 % of Teicoplanin sample with the corresponding amount of TA3-1 invariably increased the microbial potency of the sample, measured hi lU/mg powder. The data also proved that the potential (= the actual quality of the Teicoplanin in the powder) increased when active TA2 was replaced by low active TA3-1, indicating a synergistic effect between TA2 and TA3. The results can be visualized in a graphic plot as shown in Figure 3 herein. Figure 3 contains the data from the standard, the Richet compositions, material C compositions, and the TA2 compositions.<br>
Comparing the potential potencies (lU/mg TA2+TA3-1) in Figure 3, a synergistic effect of TA3-1 with the other Teicoplanin components is visible in the plot. Even products with high potency are improved when some of the TA2 is replaced with TA3-1. As also can be seen from Figure 3 the synergistic effect seems to occur when the ratio of TA3-1 to total TA2 + TA3-1 is above 5 % and to increase steadily as the amount of TA3-1 increased.<br>
The results from the MC determination supported the findings by agar diffusion assays. The antimicrobial effect of TA3-1 alone on S. aureus was much lower than that of Teicoplanin.<br>

Materials: (Table Removed)<br>
The following teicoplanin sources are used.<br><br><br><br>
For analysis a working standard is used, which has been calibrated against WHO<br>
international standard.<br>

Methods Experiment setup<br>
Three experiments were performed on solutions of Targocid and TA3-1 alone or mixed at different ratios aiming at the following TA3%: Series 1:0; 20; 25; 30; 35 and 60% Series 2:10; 15; 20; 25; 40 and 80% Series 3:15; 30; 35; 40; 50 and 100%<br>
HPLC determination of activity<br>
The HPLC-analysis for determination of activity is equal to the method described in example 1. The content mg/g powder of the five TA2 components (=TA2) and TA3-1 respectively were analyzed, and TA3-1% was calculated as (mTA3-l)/mTA2 + mTA3-l), where "m" is defined as mg active compound/mg powder.<br>
Bioassays<br>
Potency of teicoplanin TA2, TA3-1 alone or hi combinations was determined by agar diffusion assays as described in example 1. Modified MlC-values in microtitre trays were determined as described in example 1.<br>
Results<br>
Fig 5 shows a graph summary of the potency results KJ/mg powder against the mass TA3-1% from all the spiking experiments. This graph shows an increased potency by agar<br>
diffusion until up to 40 % TA3-1, after which the potency decreased. When the TA3-1% was<br>
above 70% the potency had decreased to the level as Targocid alone or below.<br>
Fig 6 shows a graph summary of the MIC values [ig powder/ml solution against the mass TA3-1% from all the spiking experiments. The MIC values keep the same levels until approximately 60% of Targocid has been replaced by TA3-1. At higher TA3-1% the MIC-values start to increase to end with a MIC value of pure TA3-1, which is 4-5 times higher than for Targocid alone.<br>
The results from this study indicate amuch lower potency of TA3-1 alone than that of Targocid. Replacing up to about 40% of TA2 with the corresponding amount of TA3-1 invariably increased the microbial potency of the sample, measured in lU/mg powder, and not until about 70% TA3-1 the potency was found less than for Targocid alone. Just adding the effect of the content of A3-1 would thus not by itself explain the higher potency. The only reasonable explanation would be that TA3-1 adds a synergistic effect.<br>
The results from the MIC determination supported the findings by agar diffusion assays. The antimicrobial effect of TA3-1 alone on S.aureus was 4-5 lower than that of teicoplanin TA2. Still up to about 60% of Targocid could be replaced with TA3-1 without any increase in MIC values. Even though a decrease in MIC values could not be found at increasing amounts of TA3-1, the unexpectedly stable MIC-values up to 60% can only be explained by a synergistic effect between TA2 and TA3-1.<br>
Through this study evidence for the proposed synergy effect between Teicoplanin A2 and A3 is provided. The mechanism of this synergy is yet unclear, but both agar diffusion and MIC determinations of pure and spiked samples have shown there is a true synergistic effect between TA3 and TA2.<br>
