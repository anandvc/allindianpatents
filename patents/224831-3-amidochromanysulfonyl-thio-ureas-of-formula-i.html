The present invention relates to 3-amiclochromany!sulfonyl(thio)ureas of the formula I<br><br>
which are valuable pharmaceutically active compounds for the treatment of disturbances of the cardiovascular system, in particular for the treatment of arrhythmias, for preventing sudden cardiac death or for influencing a reduced contractility of the heart, and to processes for their preparation, and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them.<br>
For certain benzenesulfonylureas a hypoglycemic action has been described. The prototype of such hypoglycemic sulfonylureas is glibenclamide which is used therapeutically as an agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and which in research serves as a highly regarded tool for investigating so-called ATP-sensitive potassium channels. In addition to its hypoglycemic action, glibenclamide also has other actions which it has not yet been possible to employ therapeutically but which are all attributed to the blocking of precisely these ATP-sensitive potassium channels. These actions include, in particular, an antifibrillatory action on the heart. However, a simultaneous lowering of blood sugar would be undesirable or even dangerous during treatment of ventricular fibrillation or its preliminary stages, since it may deteriorate the condition of the patient further. EP-A-612 724 discloses benzenesulfonylureas which have actions on the cardiovascular system. German patent application 19546736.1 and<br><br>
EP-A-779288 describe chromanylsulfonyl(thio)ureas which have an action on the cardiovascular system and in which an amido group is linked with the 4-position of the chroman system via a methylene or ethylene group. However, the properties of these compounds are still not satisfactory in various respects, and there continues to be a need for compounds with a favorable property profile which are suitable in particular for the treatment of arrhythmic disturbances of the heart and their consequences.<br>
EP-A-325 964 describes chroman compounds as aj-adrenergic antagonists having an action against depression, metabolic disturbances, glaucoma, migraines and high blood pressure. However, no compounds with substitution by sulfonylurea or sulfonylthiourea groupings are described and neither are such compounds suggested.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that chromanylsulfoi iyl(thi&amp;)ureas of the formula I having an amido group in the 3-position of the chroman system have a pronounced action on the cardiovascular system. The present invention thus relates to compounds of the formula I<br><br>

Also with respect to all preferred compounds of the formula I the present invention relates to all their stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio, and to their physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I which comprise the reaction steps described below.<br>
(a) 3-Amidochromanylsulfonyl(thio)ureas of the formula I in which R{3) has a meaning other than hydrogen can be prepared by reacting chromanylsulfonamides of the formula III<br><br><br>
or salts thereof of the formula IV<br><br>
with R(3)-substitutecl isocyanates of the formula V or R(3)-substituted isothiocyanates of the formula VI<br><br>
to give substituted chromanylsulfonylureas of the formula la<br><br><br>
The radicals R(1), R(2a), R(2b), R(2c) and A in the formulae la, lb, III and IV have the abovementioned meanings here, R(3) here in the formulae la and lb and in the formulae V and VI is alky! having 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms. Possible cations M in the salts of the formula IV are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal ions, for example the sodium or the potassium ion, or suitable ammonium ions which do not react with the reaction partners in an undesirable manner, in particular, for example, tetraalkylammonium ions or trialkylbenzylammonium ions.<br>
As an equivalent to the R(3)-substituted isocyanates of the formula V, R(3)-substituted carbamic acid esters, R(3)-substituted carbamic acid halides or R(3)-substituted ureas can be employed.<br>
(b) Chromanyisulfonylureas of the formula la can be prepared from chromanylsulfonamides of the formula III or salts thereof of the formula IV with R(3)-substituted trichloroacetamides of the formula VII<br><br>
in which R(3) is alkyl having 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms, in the presence of a base in an inert solvent at temperatures of 25 to ISCC, in accordance with Synthesis 1987, 734-735.<br>
Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, hydrides, amides or alcoholates such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, calcium hydride, sodium amide, potassium amide, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, potassium methylate or potassium ethylate. Suitable inert solvents are ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diglyme, ketones such as acetone or butanone, nitriles such as acetonitrile, nitro compounds such as nitromethane, esters such as othui arptatp amiHfi.s sunh as<br><br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sulfones such as sulfolane and hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene. Furthermore, mixtures of these solvents with one another are also suitable.<br>
(c) Chromanylsulfonyl(thio)ureas of the formula I in which R(3) is hydrogen can be prepared by reaction of chromanylsulfonamides of the formula III or of salts thereof of the formula IV with trialkylsilyl iso(thio)cyanates, for example trimethylsilyl iso(thio)cyanate, or with silicon tetraiso(thio)cyanate and cleavage (for example hydrolysis) of the primary silicon-substituted chromanylsulfonyl(thio)ureas. Using trialkylsilyl isocyanates or silicon tetraisocyanate, compounds of the formula Ic<br><br>
It is furthermore possible to convert chromanylsulfonamides of the formula III or salts thereof of the formula IV into chromanylsulfonylureas of the formula Ic by reaction with halocyanogens and hydrolysis of the N-cyanosulfonamides primarily formed with mineral acids at temperatures<br><br>
ofOtolOOX.<br>
Chromanylsulfonylthioureas of the formula Id can also be obtained by reaction of chromanylsulfonamides of the formula III or salts thereof of the formula IV with benzoyl isothiocyanate and reaction of the intermediate benzoyl-substituted chromanylsulfonylthioureas with an aqueous mineral acid. Similar processes are described in J. Med. Chem. 35 (1992), 1137-1144. Another variant for the preparation of the compounds of the formula Id comprises reacting the abovementioned N-cyanosulfonamides with hydrogen sulfide.<br>
(d)	Chromanylsulfonylureas of the formula I in which Z is oxygen can be<br>
prepared from chromanylsulfonyl halides, for example of the formula VIII<br><br>
in which R(1), R(2a), R(2b), R(2c) and A have the abovementioned meanings, with R(3)-substituted ureas or R(3)-substituted bis(trialkylsilyl)ureas. Furthermore, sulfonic acid chlorides of the formula VIII can be reacted with parabanic acid to give chromanylsulfonylparabanic acids, hydrolysis of which with mineral acids gives corresponding chromanylsulfonylureas of the formula I in which Z is oxygen.<br>
(e)	Chromanylsulfonyl(thio)ureas of the formula I can also be prepared by<br>
reaction of amines of the formula R(3)-NH2, in which R(3) has the<br>
abovementioned meanings, with chromanylsulfonyl isocyanates of the<br>
formula IX<br><br><br>
in which R(1), R(2a), R(2b), R(2c) and A in the formulae IX and X have the abovementioned meanings. As well as with the iso(thio)cyanates of the formulae IX and X, an amine of the formula R(3)-NH2 can be reacted with a chromanylsulfonylcarbamic acid ester or -carbamic acid halide or a chromanylsulfonylurea of the formula la In which R(3) here is hydrogen, to give a compound of the formula I in which Z is oxygen. Similarly, an amine of the formula R(3)-NH2 can be reacted with a chromanylsulfonylcarbamic acid thioester or -carbamic acid thiohalide to give a compound of the formula I in which Z is sulfur.<br>
The sulfonyl isocyanates of the formula IX can be obtained from the sulfamoylchromans of the formula III by customary methods, for example with phosgene. The preparation of the sulfonyl isothiocyanates of the formula X can be carried out by reaction of a corresponding sulfonic acid amide of the formula III with an alkali metal hydroxide and carbon disulfide in an organic solvent such as DMF, DMSO or N-methylpyrrolidone. The resulting di-alkali metal salt of the sulfonyldithiocarbamic acid can be reacted with a slight excess of phosgene or of a phosgene substitute such as triphosgene, with a chloroformic acid ester (2 equivalents) or with thionyl chloride in an inert solvent. The resulting solution of the sulfonyl isothiocyanate can be reacted directly with the corresponding amines or<br><br>
ammonia.<br>
(f)	Substituted chromanylsulfonylureas of the formula I in which Z is oxygen can be prepared by a conversion reaction from chromanylsulfonylthioureas of the formula I in which Z is sulfur. The desulfurization, that is the replacement of the sulfur atom in the correspondingly substituted chromanylsulfonylthiourea by an oxygen atom, can be carried out, for example, with the aid of oxides or salts of heavy metals, or by using oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide or nitrous acid. A thiourea can also be desulfurized by treatment with chlorinating agents such as phosgene or phosphorus pentachloride. Chloroformic acid amidines or carbodiimides are obtained as intermediate compounds and can be converted into the corresponding substituted chromanylsulfonylureas, for example, by hydrolysis or by adding on water.<br>
(g)	Correspondingly substituted chromanylsulfenyl- or sulfinylureas can be oxidized to chromanylsulfonylureas of the formula I in which Z is oxygen with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide or nitrous acid.<br>
The starting compounds for the synthesis processes mentioned for the chromanylsulfonyl(thio)ureas of the formula I can be prepared by methods known per se such as are described in the literature (for example in the standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of organic chemistry], Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart; Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York; and in the abovementioned patent applications), and under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. Variants which are known per se but which are not mentioned in more detail here can also be utilized for these reactions. If desired, the starting substances can also be formed in situ, so that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture but are further reacted immediately.<br>
3-Amidochromans of the formula XVI can be prepared, for example, in<br><br>
accordance with the synthesis process shown in Equation 1, in which the substituents have the meanings given above or explained below.<br><br><br>
The oximes of the formula XI known from the literature, which are described, for example, in Heterocydes 38 (1994), 305-318, can be reacted with sulfonic acid chlorides, for example p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, with the addition of tertiary bases such as, for example, pyridine or a trialkylamine, in the presence or absence of an inert solvent at temperatures of 0 to lOO'C, preferably 0 to ICC, to give oxime sulfonates, for example to give the oxime tosylates of the formula XII. Suitable inert solvents here are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or glycol ether, ketones such as acetone or butanone, nitriles such as acetonitrile, amides such as dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, sulfoxides such as DMSO, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane or carbon tetrachloride, and hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylenes. Furthermore, mixtures of these solvents with one another are also suitable.<br>
The oxime sulfonates, for example of the formula XII, can be rearranged into amino-ketones, i.e. into the 3-amino-4-chromanones, by the action of bases in a solvent. These products are in general isolated in the form of acid addition salts, for example in the form of the hydrochlorides of the formula XIII (J. Med. Chem. 12 (1969), 277). Suitable bases for this rearrangement are, for example, the alkali metal salts of alcohols such as, for example, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, sodium isopropylate, potassium methylate, potassium ethylate or potassium tert-butylate, and also tertiary amine bases such as pyridine or trialkylamines. Possible solvents are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and tert-butanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, and hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene. The rearrangement is in general carried out at temperatures from 10 to 100"*C, preferably at 20 to 60°C.<br>
The amino-ketones can, after conversion of the acid addition salts, i.e., for example, of the hydrochlorides of the formula XIII, with bases into the free amines be acylated to give the amides of the formula XIV, in which R(4)<br><br>
can be the phenyl radical described in the abovementioned definition of A it being possible for the group R(4)-C(=0) to remain then in the molecule, or in which the group R(4)-C(=0) has the function of a protective group which is split off again in the subsequent course of the synthesis.<br>
In the latter case R(4) is, for example, alky! having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or trihalogenomethyl, for example trifluoromethyl. Suitable acylating agents here for the amino groups are, for example, the alkyl esters, the halides (such as, for example, chlorides or bromides) or the anhydrides of carboxylic acids. The acylation can be carried out in particular with compounds of the formula R(4)-C(=0)-Y, in which - as shown in Equation 1 - the radical R(4) is, for example, an alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a trihalogenomethyl radical, or is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to three Identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl having 1 or 2 carbon atoms and alkoxy having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, and Y is a leaving group such as, for example, halogen, {C'-C)-a\kox:y, trihalogenoacetoxy or {C-C)-alkylcarbonyloxy.<br>
The syntheses of the compounds of the formula XIV can be carried out with the addition of tertiary bases such as, for example, pyridine or trialkyiamines, and in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, it also being possible for a catalyst such as, for example, dimethylaminopyridine, to be present. The reaction is in general carried out at temperatures from about 0 to 160X, preferably from 20 to 100X. Suitable inert solvents are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol monomethyl or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (methylglycol or ethylglycol), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diglyme, ketones such as acetone or butanone, nitrites such as acetonitrile, amides such as dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, sulfoxides such as DMSO, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane or carbon tetrachloride, and hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylenes. Furthermore, mixtures of these solvents with one another are also<br><br>
suitable.<br>
The chromanones of the formula XIV can be reduced to the corresponding chromanols of the formula XV by methods known per se, for example with alkali metal borohydrides such as sodium or potassium borohydride, in alcohols such as methanol or ethanol (Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1972, 3183).<br>
The chromanones of the formula XIV, and also the chromanols of the formula XV, can be reduced to the amidochromanes of the formula XVI, for example by catalytic hydrogenation. Suitable catalysts for this hydrogenation are, for example, metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru or Raney nickel, it being possible for the first four mentioned also to be in the form of metal oxides. Pd, Pt and Raney nickel are preferred. Suitable solvents for the hydrogenation are, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, or acids, acetic acid being preferred. To accelerate the reaction, a catalytic amount of a strong acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, perchloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid, can be added during the hydrogenation. The hydrogenation is in general carried out at 10 to SOC, preferably at 15 to 30'C, and under a hydrogen pressure of 0 to 100 atmospheres gauge, preferably under 0 to 5 atmospheres gauge (i.e. under an hydrogen excess pressure of 0 to 100 atmospheres, preferably 0 to 5 atmospheres) (J. Med. Chem, 15 (1972), 863-865). If acetic acid is used as the solvent, the yields can be increased by addition of anhydrides of (Ci-C4)-alkylcarboxylic acids such as, for example, acetic anhydride. The chromanols of the formula XV can also be converted into the amidochromans of the formula XVI by further reduction methods such as are described, for example, in Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, 1989, pages 27 -28.<br>
The following steps in the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I are shown in Equation 11.<br><br><br>
R(4) is phenyl vsch is unsubstituted or substituted by up to three identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl having 1 or 2 carlxn atoms and alko) having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, or all having 1 to 4 cartxxi atoms or trihalogenomethyl, and R(5) has all the abovementioned meanings of Aor is alkyl having 1 to 4 cartxxi atoms or trihalogenomethyl<br><br>
If the acyl group R(4)-C(=0) in the compounds of the formula XVI functions as a protective group, It can be split off again by acids or bases, the aminochromans of the formula XVII being formed. By cleavage with acids, for example with aqueous acids or with acids in inert organic solvents, the associated acid addition salt, for example the hydrochloride of the formula XVIIa, can be formed. Acids which are suitable for the cleavage are, for example, sulfuric acid, hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids such as orthophosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid, or other customary acids with which amides can be cleaved, for example organic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids such as, for example, acetic acid, salicylic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or iaurylsulfuric acid. The cleavage of the acylated amine of the formula XVI with bases can likewise be carried out in aqueous or inert organic solvents. Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides or alcoholates such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, potassium methylate or potassium ethylate.<br>
The amines of the formula XVII have one or two chiral centers on the ring carbon atoms. If they are present as mixtures of stereoisomeric forms, for example as racemates, and if stereochemically uniform compounds of the formula I are to be prepared, separation of the stereoisomers can be carried out, for example, at the stage of the amines of the formula XVII. If the amines of the formula XVII have two or more chiral centers, they can be obtained in the synthesis as mixtures of racemates, from which individual racemates can be isolated in the pure form, for example by recrystallization from inert solvents. Resulting racemates can, if desired, be separated mechanically or chemically into their enantiomers by methods known per se. Thus, diastereomers can be formed from the racemate by reaction with an optically active separating agent. Suitable separating agents for basic compounds are, for example, optically active acids such as the R or R,R and S or S,S forms of tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, mandeiic<br><br>
acid, maleic acid or lactic acid. The various forms of the diastereomers can be separated in a manner known per se, for example by fractional crystallization, and the enantiomers can be liberated from the diastereomers in a manner known per se. Separations of enantiomers are furthermore achieved by chromatography on optically active support materials. A particularly simple process for the preparation of optically uniform compounds, with appropriate substitution, comprises, for example, resolving the amines of the formula XVII into the enantiomers by crystallization or recrystallization of the salts with optically active acids such as, for example, (+)- or {-)-mandellc acid and converting these enantiomers into the end compounds of the formula I, which are then in turn enantiomerically pure. To prepare stereochemically uniform compounds of the formula I, for example pure enantiomers, however, separations can also be carried out by the methods mentioned or other customary methods at other stages of the synthesis.<br>
The compounds of the formula XVII, i.e. also stereochemically uniform forms, can be acylated to give the amides of the formulae XVIa or XVI. Suitable acylating agents here for introducing the group A-C(=0), in which A is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to three identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl having 1 or 2 carbon atoms and alkoxy having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, and which can remain in the molecule, are, for example, the alkyl esters, the halides (such as, for example, chlorides or bromides) or the anhydrides of benzoic acids. In particular, the acylation can be carried out with compounds of the formula A-C(=0)-Y, in which A is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to three identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl having 1 or 2 carbon atoms and alkoxy having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, and Y is a leaving group such as, for example, halogen, (Ci-C4)-alkoxy, trihalogenoacetoxy or (Ci-C4)-alkylcarbonyloxy. This acylation can in turn be carried out with the addition of tertiary bases such as, for example, pyridine or trialkylamines, and in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, it also being possible for a catalyst such as, for example,<br><br>
dimethylaminopyridine, to be present. The reaction is in general carried out at temperatures of about 0 to ISOX, preferably 20 to 100°C. Suitable inert solvents are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol monomethyl or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (methyl glycol or ethyl glycol), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diglyme, ketones such as acetone or butanone, nitrites such as acetonitrile, amides such as dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, sulfoxides such as DMSO, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane or carbon tetrachloride, or hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylenes. Mixtures of these solvents with one another are furthermore also suitable.<br><br><br><br>
meanings, by reaction with carbonic acid halides such as phosgene or triphosgene, in the presence of tertiary alkylamines or pyridine and inert solvents in a manner known per se. Suitable inert solvents are, for example, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diglyma, ketones such as acetone or butanone, niiriles such as acetonitrile, nitro compounds such as nitromethane, esters such as ethyl acetate, amides such as dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, sulfoxides such as DMSO, sulfones such as sulfolane, or hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylenes. Furthermore, mixtures of these solvents with one another are also suitable. In another route, the amines of the formula XVII are first converted in a manner known per se into reactive carbonic acid derivatives, for example into carbonic acid esters (urethanes) such as can be synthesized from chloroformic acid alkyl esters and amines of the formula XVII in the presence of suitable tertiary alkylamines or pyridines. Furthermore, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole and analogous reactive derivatives can also be employed as isocyanate equivalents (H. A. Staab, Synthesen mit heterocyclischen Amiden (Azoliden) [Syntheses with heterocyclic amides (azolides)], Angewandte Chemie 74 (1962), 407 - 423).<br>
The isocyanates of the formula XVIII or the urethanes or the intermediate stages obtained from amines of the formula XVII and, for example, N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole can then be coupled with a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
in the presence or absence of inert solvents at temperatures of 100 to 170°C (Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 598 (1956), 203), and give the corresponding compounds of the formula XVIa in which A is one of the heterocyclic radicals.<br>
The sulfonamides of the formula Ilia can be prepared from the acylated amines of the formulae XVI and XVIa under suitable reaction conditions known per se in a manner known per se (cf. Equation II). Variants which are known per se but are not mentioned here can also be utilized for this reaction. The syntheses of the sulfonamides can be brought to completion in one, two or more steps. Processes in which the acylated amines of the formula XVI or XVIa are converted into the 6-chromanylsulfonic acids or derivatives thereof, for example sulfonic acid halides of the formula Villa, by electrophilic reagents in the presence or absence of inert solvents at temperatures of -ICC to 120°C, preferably 0 to 1G0°C, are particularly preferred. For this conversion, for example, it is possible to carry out<br><br>
sulfonations with sulfuric acids or oleum, naiogenosuironations witn halogenosulfonic acids such as chlorosulfonic acid, reactions with sulfuryj halides in the presence of anhydrous metal halides, or reactions with thionyl halides in the presence of anhydrous metal halides with subsequent oxidations carried out in a known manner to give sulfonic acid chlorides. If sulfonic acids are the primary reaction products, these can be converted into sulfonic acid halides, for example of the formula Villa, by means of acid halides such as, for example, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, phosphorus oxychlorides, thionyl halides or oxalyl halides, in a manner known per se, either directly or after treatment with tertiary amines such as, for example, pyridine or trialkylamines, or with alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides or with reagents which form these basic compounds in situ. The conversion of the sulfonic acid dehvatives into sulfonamides of the formula Ilia is carried out in a manner known from the literature, sulfonic acid chlorides preferably being reacted with aqueous ammonia in inert solvents at temperatures of 0 to lOOC.<br>
For synthesis of the compounds of the formula I, corresponding sulfonamides of the formula Ilia in which the group R(5)-C(=0) has the function of a protective group can also be prepared from the acylated amines of the formula XVI. As shown in Equation II, the group R(5) contained in the formulae Villa and ilia can have the abovementioned meanings of A, but - in the same way as R(4) - can also be, for example, alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or trihalogenomethyl. If R(5) in the formula Ilia has the meanings of A, the compounds of the formula III are present. If R(5) in the formula Villa has the meanings of A, the compounds of the formula VIII are present.<br>
The protective group can be split off from the compounds of the formula Ilia which contain a protective group, after introduction of the sulfonamide group, by means of acids or bases as is explained above for splitting off the protective group from the compounds of the formula XVI. The sulfamoylchromans of the formula III can then be prepared from the sulfonamide-substituted amines thus prepared, as explained above for the<br><br>
introduction of the group A-C(=0) into the compounds of the formulae XIII or XVII. One or the other of the processes mentioned and their embodiments may be less suitable for the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I, or at least necessitate measures to protect reactive groups, depending on the nature of the radicals R(1), R(2a), R(2b), R(2c), R(3), A and Z. However, such relatively rarely occurring cases can easily be recognized by the skilled person, and there are no difficulties in successfully applying another of the synthesis routes described in such cases.<br>
The compounds of the formula I influence the action potential of cells, in particular of myocardial cells. They have a normalizing action on an impaired action potential such as exists, for example, during ischemias, and are therefore suitable, for example, for the treatment and prophylaxis of disturbances of the cardiovascular system, in particular of arrhythmias and their consequences. The activity of the compounds of the formula I can be demonstrated, for example, in the model described below, in which the duration of the action potential of the papillary muscle of the guinea pig is determined.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts can therefore be used, by themselves, as mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical formulations, as medicaments in animals, preferably in mammals, and in particular in humans. Mammals in which the compounds of the formula I can be used or tested are, for example, monkeys, dogs, mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, cats and larger stock animals such as, for example, cattle and pigs. The present invention also relates to the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts for use as medicaments and to pharmaceutical formulations which comprise, as the active constituent, an effective dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, in addition to customary, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and auxiliaries. The pharmaceutical formulations can be intended for enteral or parenteral use, and usually comprise 0.5 to 90<br><br>
percent by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se. For this, the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts can be brought into a suitable dosage form and administration form together with one or more solid or liquid carriers and/or auxiliaries and, if desired, in combination with other medicaments, for example medicaments having a cardiovascular action such as, for example, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors, and this form can then be used as a medicament in human or veterinary medicine.<br>
Possible carriers are organic or Inorganic substances which are suitable, for example, for enteral (for example oral) administration or for parenteral administration (for example intravenous injection of infusion) or for topical application and which do not react with the compounds of the formula I, for example water, vegetable oils, waxes, alcohols such as ethanol, propanediol or benzyl alcohols, glycerol, polyols, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatin, carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, stearic acid and salts thereof such as magnesium stearate, talc, lanolin or Vaseline. Drug forms such as tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, syrups, juices or drops, and furthermore suspensions or emulsions are used in particular for oral and rectal use. Ointments, creams, pastes, lotions, gels, sprays, foams, aerosols, solutions or powders are used in particular for topical application. Solvents which can be used for solutions are, for example, water or alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol or 1,2-propanediol, or mixtures thereof with one another or with water. Implants, for example, are also possible further drug forms. The compounds of the formula I can also be lyophilized and the resulting lyophilizates can be used, for example, for the preparation of injection preparations. Liposomal formulations are also possible, in particular, for topical use. The pharmaceutical formulations can comprise auxiliaries<br><br>
such as lubricants, preservatives, disintegrating agents, thickeners, stabilizers and/or wetting agents, agents for achieving a depot effect, emulsifiers, salts (for example for influencing the osmotic pressure), buffer substances, dyestuffs, flavorings and/or aroma substances. If desired, they can also comprise one or more other active compounds and/or, for example, one or more vitamins.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts are valuable therapeutics which are suitable for use on humans or mammals not only as antiarrhythmics but also for the treatment and prophylaxis in other disturbances of the cardiovascular system, for cardiac insufficiency, ischemias or heart transplants, or for cerebral vascular diseases. They are used in particular as antiarrhythmics for the treatment of disturbances in cardiac rhythm of the most diverse origin and for preventing arrhythmia-related sudden cardiac death. Examples of arrhythmic disturbances of the heart are supraventricular dysrhythmias such as, for example, atrial tachycardias, atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular dysrhythmias, or ventricular dysrhythmias such as ventricular extrasystoles, but in particular life-threatening ventricular tachycardias or the particularly dangerous ventricular fibrillation. They are particularly suitable for those cases where arrhythmias are the consequence of a constriction of a coronary vessel such as occur, for example, with angina pectoris or during an acute cardiac infarction or as a chronic consequence of a cardiac infarction. They are therefore particularly suitable for preventing sudden cardiac death in postinfarction patients. Other syndromes where such dysrhythmias and/or sudden arrhythmia-related cardiac deaths play a role are, for example, cardiac insufficiency or cardiac hypertrophy as a consequence of a chronically increased blood pressure.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are furthermore capable of positively influencing a reduced contractility of the heart and a weakened cardiac power. These conditions can be disease-related reductions in cardiac contractility such as, for example, in the case of cardiac<br><br>
insufficiency, or also acute cases such as cardiac failure under the effects of shock. Under the influence of the compounds of the formula I during a heart transplant the heart can also resume its capacity faster and more reliably after the operation has taken place. The same applies to operations on the heart which necessitate temporarily stopping cardiac activity by means of cardioplegic solutions.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts for the treatment and prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned and the use for the preparation of medicaments for use in these syndromes.<br>
The dosages which are necessary, for example, for the treatment of disturbances in cardiac rhythm with the compounds of the formula I depend on whether treatment is acute or prophylactic, and depend on the particular individual case. A dose which lies in the range from about at least 0.01 mg, preferably 0.1 mg, in particular 1 mg, to not more than 100 mg, preferably 10 mg (in each case per kg of bodyweight and day) is usually sufficient if prophylaxis is being undertaken. A dose range from 1 to 10 mg per kg and day is particularly suitable. The dose can be administered here in the form of an individual oral or parenteral dose, or can be divided into several, in particular, for example, two, three or four individual doses. If acute cases of disturbances in cardiac rhythm are being treated, for example on an intensive care ward, parenteral administration, for example by injection or infusion, may be advantageous. A preferred dose range in critical situations can then be 10 to 100 mg per kg and day, and can be administered, for example, as a continuous infusion.<br>
The compounds of the formula I inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels of cells. As well as being employed as pharmaceutically active compounds in human and veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula I can also be employed as a scientific tool or as an aid for biochemical investigations in which such an influence on ion channels is intended, and<br><br>
for diagnostic purposes. The compounds of the formula I and their salts can furthermore be used as intermediate products for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>

Example 1:<br>
3-(5-Chloro-2-methoxybenzamido)-6-(methylaminocarbonylaminosulfonyl)-7-methoxychroman<br><br>
1.71 g (4 mmol) of 3-(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamido)-6-sulfamoyl-7-methoxychroman were heated at 80°C for 30 minutes in 10 ml of dry DMSO after addition of 0.4 g (10 mmol) of freshly powdered sodium hydroxide and 1.05 g (6 mmol) of N-methyltrichloroacetamide. The cooled reaction mixture was introduced into ice-water, clarified with active charcoal and acidified to pH 1. The precipitate was filtered off with suction, dried and recrystallized twice from ethanol. The product had a melting point of 256-257°C.<br><br>
Preparation of the starting compound 3-(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamido)-6-sulfamoyl-7-methoxychroman<br><br>
15.1 g (70 mmol) of 3-amino-7-methoxychroman hydrochloride (Eur. J. Med. Chem. 11 (1976), 251 - 256) were dissolved in 80 ml of pyridine, and 14.8 g of 2-methoxy-5-chlorobenzoyl chloride were added at CC. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours and at SO'C for 1 hour. The cooled reacticn mixture was partitioned between water and methylene chloride. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with methylene chloride. The combined organic phases were washed with 2 N hydrochloric acid, water and bicarbonate solution. After drying and evaporation of the organic phase, the residue was dissolved in a little toluene and the product was precipitated with excess diethyl ether. 3-(5-Chioro-2-methoxybenzamido)-7-methoxychroman of melting point 92-93°C was obtained.<br>
20 g of 3-(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamido)-7-methoxychroman were introduced in portions into 35 ml of chlorosulfonic acid, cooled to -10°C, while stirring. The mixture was allowed to come to room temperature and a further 5 ml of chlorosulfonic acid were added. After 1 hour, the mixture was stirred cautiously into ice-water. The resulting precipitate was filtered off with suction and, after washing with water, introduced into a mixture, cooled to -20°C, of 200 ml of acetone and 120 ml of concentrated aqueous ammonia. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After standing overnight, the solution was concentrated at 30°C in vacuo. Concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the residue, while cooling with ice. The resulting precipitate was filtered off with suction and<br><br>
recrystallized from glacial acetic acid/methanol. The resulting 3-(5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamiclo)-6-sulfamoyl-7-methoxychroman had a melting point of210-212°C.<br>

Pharmacological data<br>
The therapeutic properties of the compounds of the formula I were demonstrated in the following models:<br>
Test 1: Duration of the action potential of the papillary muscle of the guinea pig<br>
(a) Introduction<br>
ATP deficiency states such as are observed in the cardiac muscle cell during ischemia lead to a shortening of the duration of the action potential.<br><br>
They are regarded as one of the causes of so-called re-entry arrhythmias, which can cause sudden cardiac death. The opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels as a result of the fall in ATP is regarded as the cause of this.<br>
(b) Method<br>
A standard microelectrode technique was employed to measure the action potential. For this, guinea pigs of both sexes were sacrificed by a blow to the head, the hearts were removed and the papillary muscles were separated out and suspended in an organ bath. The organ bath was flushed with Ringer's solution (0.9 % NaCI, 0.048 % KCI, 0.024 % CaClj, 0.02 % NaHCOs and 0.1 % glucose) and gassed with a mixture of 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide at a temperature of SSC. The muscle was stimulated via an electrode with rectangular pulses of 1 V and 1 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz. The action potential was derived through a glass microelectrode which was inserted intracellularly and filled with 3 M KCI solution, and recorded. The substances to be tested were added to the Ringer's solution in a concentration of 2 x 10" mol per liter or 2x10' mol per liter. The action potential was amplified with a Hugo Sachs amplifier and shown on an oscilloscope. The duration of the action potential in milliseconds (ms) was determined at a degree of repolarization of 95 % (APD95). Shortenings of the action potential were induced by addition of a solution of the potassium channel opener HOE 234 (Rilmakalim) (W. Linz, E. Klaus, U. Albus, R.H.A. Becker, D. Mania, H.C. Englert, B.A. Sch6lkens, Arzneimittelforschung/Drug Research, Volume 42 (II), 1992, 1180-1185), a concentration of HOE 234 in the bath solution of 1 pg/ml being established. The test substances were added to the bath solution as stock solutions in propanediol. The values stated are based on measurements 30 minutes after the addition. As a control, the APD95 value was determined in the presence of HOE 234 and in the absence of the test substance.<br><br><br>
The measurement values (mean values from n experiments) are followed by the corresponding blank values in parentheses. The blank values are the APD95 values which were measured at the start of the experiment without HOE 234 and test substance in the Ringer's solution. The values obtained show the normalizing effect of the compounds according to the invention on a shortened duration of the action potential.<br>
Test 2: Membrane potential on isolated p cells<br>
(a) Introduction<br>
The action mechanism of hypoglycemic sulfonylureas understood in principle. The 3 cells of the pancreas are the target organ of sulfonylureas, where they bring about a release of the hypoglycemic hormone insulin by influencing the electrical potential of the cell membrane. A hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, for example glibenclamide, has the effect of depolarizing the cell membrane, which leads to an increased inflow of calcium ions and, as a consequence thereof, to release of insulin. The extent AU of this depolanzation of the cell membrane caused by the substances according to the invention was determined on insulin-secreting RINmSF cells, a<br><br>
pancreas tumor cell line. The acitivlty of a compound in this model predicts the extent of the hypoglycemic potential of this compound.<br>
(b) Method<br>
Cell cultures of RINmSF cells: RINmSF cells were cultured at S/'C in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Flow) to which 11 mM glucose, 10 % (volume/volume) fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and 50 [igtm\ of gentamycin were added. The cells were sown on Petri dishes every 2 to 3 days and kept at a temperature of STC in a moistened atmosphere of 95 % Oj and 5 % CO2. For the investigations, the cells were isolated by incubation (about 3 minutes) in a Ca"- free medium which comprised 0.25 % trypsin.<br>
Measurement method: Isolated RINm5F cells were introduced into a Plexiglas chamber on an inverse microscope which was equipped with a differential interference contrast lens. Under visual control (400-fold magnification), a fire-polished micropipette with an opening diameter of about 1 pm was placed on the cell with the aid of a micromanipulator. By applying a slight reduced pressure to the inside of the patch pipette, a high electrical seal was initially established between the glass and the cell membrane. By increasing the reduced pressure, the membrane patch under the volumetric pipette was then broken open. In this whole cell configuration, the cell potential was recorded with the aid of a patch clamp amplifier (L/M EPC 7, List, Darmstadt) and the whole cell current was measured by applying a voltage ramp. The patch pipette was filled with KCI solution which comprised (in mmol per liter): 140 KCI, 10 NaCI, 1.1 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 1 Mg-ATP, and 10 HEPES, and had a pH of 7.2. The bath contained NaCI solution which comprised (in mmol per liter): 140 NaCI. 4.7 KCI, 1.1 MgClz, 2 CaClz and 10 HEPES, and had a pH of 7.4. Stock solutions (concentration 100 mmol/l) of the test substances in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and corresponding dilutions in NaCI solution were prepared. DMSO alone had no effect on the cell potential. To stabilize the cell potential, diazoxide (100 |jmol/l), an opener of ATP-<br><br>
sensitive K* channels, was added to the bath solution in all experiments. All experiments were carried out at 34 ± 1 "C.<br>
(c) Results<br>
The following values AU (changes in the cell potentials caused by the addition of the test substances) were measured. The control values in parentheses are the cell potentials U before the addition of the test substances. For comparison the values obtained in this test with glibenclamide, a typical hypoglycemic benzenesulfonylurea, are given. The values obtained show that the compounds according to the invention exhibit no or only a low hypoglycemic activity.<br><br>
