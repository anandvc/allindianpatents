5     The  present  invention  concerns  a  current measurement  circuit comprising  a mutually  coupled  transformer  and  an  integration circuit which integrates the signal of the mutually coupled transformer.<br>
10     The  use   of mutually coupled  transformers  (otherwise  known as   inductively  coupled   transformers)   for  measuring   currents possesses  certain  advantages  in  comparison   with  other measuring devices. In particuler, in the field of electricity metering,  the  use  of a mutually coupled  transformer avoids<br>
15     the problems  of saturation  by dc currents which arise  with iron-core   transformers   and   enables   the  measurement  of  the current   separately   from   other  measurements,   for  example measurements  of the current on  the  other phases  of a multiphase   network.   However,   mutually   coupled   transformers<br>
2 0     present a particular problem  in  that  the  signal  supplied  by   the transformer   is   the  derivative   of  the   measured  current.   Thus, the  use  of a mutually coupled  transformer requires  an integration circuit to process  the  signal.<br>
2	5     A  measurement circuit including  a mutually coupled<br>
transformer and  an integration circuit are described  in  the paieni application EP 0 403  330. The iniegravion circuit of this application   is  particularly  adapted  to  suppress   low  frequency signals and parasitic dc signals which can be produced at the<br>
3	0     output  of  conventional  integration  circuits.<br>
It is  often  the case that signals representing a measurement of current are  converted  by an  analogue digital converter  for later processing.  A known technique for improving  the 3 5     resolution of an  analogue digital converter uses a dither signal added  to the measured signal before conversion  by  the<br>
3<br><br>
converter. This dither signal can be a random signal or a periodic signal,    for example a triangular signal or a signal having the form of a ramp. Using this technique the value of the measured signal can be determined  by an analysis of the 5     converted values of the signal with a resolution finer than that normally possible with the available quantisation steps  of the converter.  The principals  of the dither technique have  been known for a long time and examples of measurement and communication  systems  which use a dither signal for 10     improving  the performance  of a converter are  described  in US 4 187 466, EP 0 181 719 and EP 0 613 256. The patent EP 0 181  719 in particular describes the principles of a system which  adds  a triangular dither signal to the current signal before   conversion.<br>
15<br>
It is  thus desirable  to have  a system for measuring currents which  combines  the  advantages  associated  with  a  mutually coupled  transformer with those associated with the use  of a dither signal.  The  generation of a dither signal  can present<br>
2	0     problems  in  relation  to the cost  of components  and  the<br>
complexity of the system which  generates  it. The present invention  aims  to provide a  system which  provides  the advantages  of the  two techniques  but which  avoids  the problems  of complexity and  duplication of components.<br>
25<br>
To this end, the present invention is characterized in that the measurement circuit further comprises a dither circuit which adds a substantially rectangular signal to the signal from the transformer before the input of the integration circuit in order 30 that the integration circuit provides a signal representing the measured current perturbed by a substantially triangular dither   signal.<br>
In general, a square wave or rectangular signal is not<br>
3	5     appropriate as a dither signal but it may be easily generated in<br>
an electronic circuit, for example  at the output of a<br>
A<br><br>
microprocessor.  The present invention provides  a circuit in which a current signal modulated by a triangular dither signal is produced and which can be sent to an analogue to digital converter, but which avoids duplication of components due to 5     the fact that the integration circuit performs both the functions of integration of the signal from the mutually coupled transformer and of creation of a dither signal.<br>
As described above, the value of the measured signal by the 10     transformer may  then be calculated  after conversion by  the steps of signal processing with a resolution finer than that possible with only an analogue to digital converter.<br>
The  integration circuit may be a digital or analogue integrator 15     of a conventional type. However, preferably, a circuit similar to that of EP 0 403 330 is used, which comprises an amplifier having an associated gain resistance and a feedback loop, the feedback  loop comprising  a  feedback  capacitor,  the  integration circuit further comprising  a  second  integrator mounted  at  the<br>
2	0     output of the  amplifier,  upstream of the feedback loop.<br>
_        By  these  means,  the integration circuit suppresses  low frequencies  and parasite dc  signals which can arise in conventional   analogue  circuits.   Preferably,   the  integration 15     ciricuit can further comprise means for correction of the phase delays in the integratd signal, in particular the delay introduced  by  the gain lesistancc  of the integrator, comprising :.       a passive filter mounted  upstream of the amplifier. Where  the current measurent circuit forms part of the input circuit of an<br>
3	0     electricity  meter,  including  a voltage measurement circuit,   the<br>
passive filter can be dimensioned in order that all the phase delays  between  the  voltage  and current paths  are corrected  by this filter,  the voltage in the network being measured directly without changing its phase. Thus, the voltage channel is free 3 5     from constraints regarding the use of components used for correction of phase, which is advantageous if the voltage<br>
5<br><br>
channel is also used for communication of data.<br>
As discussed above, a square wave or rectangular signal is easily generated by  an electronic circuit.  In one embodiment, 5     the rectangular signal can be generated using a pulse width modulated signal (PWM), provided at an output of a microprocessor, which signal is passed via a switching means comprising at least one latch in order to divide the average frequency of the PWM signal and to create the square wave.<br>
10<br>
The use of a dither signal having the form of a simple triangular waveform can  cause problems  associated  with  the relation  between  the amplitude of the  signal and  the quantisation  steps  of the converter.  In  particular,  a problem<br>
15     arises if the amplitude of the dither signal is not equal to an integral   number  of quantisation  steps  of  the  converter.   In order to  overcome these problems,  the  dither circuit preferably   supplies   a  rectangular  signal   which   is  further modulated by a modulation signal. This signal is then<br>
2 0     integrated  in  order to  become  a modulated  triangular  signal.<br>
The use of a signal having this form overcomes the problems associated with the differences between the amplitude of the non-modulated  triangular signal and  the  quantisation  levels  of<br>
2	5     the converter. In effect, the modulation  signal introduces a<br>
component to the converted values which is dependant on  the differences  between  the  amplitude  of the  triangular signal   and the quantisation steps of the converter and which can be suppressed  after conversion  in  the  same processing  operation<br>
3	0     that suppresses the dither signal, for example, by using a<br>
decimation   filter.<br>
Preferably, the modulation signal is  also generated using the PWM signal of the microprocessor. In one embodiment, the 3 5     two limits of the modulation signal may be generated using two integrating circuits which integrate the PWM signal (and<br><br>
its inverse) in order to create each limit. However, it is possible to further reduce the number of components used. Preferably, the dither circuit comprises an integrator which integrates the pulse width modulated signal in order to create a triangular signal representing one limit of the modulation signal, this signal being supplied to switching means in order to create a substantially rectangular signal having only one limit which varies as per the signal from the integrator, the dither circuit further comprising a filter which filters low frequency components from the signal so as to provide a rectangular signal which is symetrically modulated. Considering the rectangular modulated signal before the filtering step, this signal comprises a frequency component corresponding to the frequency of the rectangular signal and a low frequency component corresponding to the triangular signal which modulates one of the two limits of the rectangular signal. The filter thus eliminates low frequency components and the signal assumes a symetrical shape, i.e. such that the two limits of the signal are equally modulated.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a current measurement device comprising a mutual inductance transformer and an integration circuit which integrates the signal from said transformer characterised in that said measurement device comprises a dither circuit said dither circuit comprising means for generating a substantially rectangular signal and means for adding substantially rectangular signal to the signal from said transformer before the input of said integration circuit in order that said integration circuit provides a signal representing the measured current perturbed by a substantially triangular dither signal<br>
'2 1 JUN 2002 DUPLICATE<br><br>
The invention will be best understood in  the light of the following<br>
description of one embodiment of the invention, which is given by way of an<br>
illustrative and non-limiting example, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of an input circuit for an electricity meter<br>
comprising a current measurement circuit as per the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the steps of creation of the dither signal added to the current<br>
signal measured by the circuit of Figure 1.<br>
As is shown in Figure 1, the input circuit for an electricity meter as per the<br>
embodiment comprises a current measurement circuit including a dither<br>
circuit 1 and an	<br>
I<br><br>
integrating circuit 2, which integrates the signal from an inductance   transformer  3   (mutually   coupled   transformer) combined with a square wave supplied by the dither circuit, a voltage measurement circuit 4 and an analogue to digital 5     converter   5.<br>
The dither circuit 1 comprises a latch 6 which receives the PWM signal of a microprocessor associated with this circuit. The latch divides the average frequency of the PWM signal in<br>
10     order to create a square wave. The modulation signal is produced by the switch 8 which cuts the reference voltage Vref in response to the PWM signal of the microprocessor, so as to produce, after filtering by the resistance and capacitor 9 and  11  and addition of the reference voltage Vref by the<br>
15     resistances 9,  10 and  12, the modulated Vref signal. This signal<br>
is modulated in a triangular form at the frequency of the PWM<br>
cycle and having a depth of modulation which is dependant on<br>
the   relation	R12<br>
R9 + R10<br>
20<br>
This signal is then cut by the second switch 7 in response ,to the. square wave produced by the PWM signal passed via the latch  6  so as to provide an assymetrically modulated square wave signal. The capacitor 13 serves to equalise the rise and<br>
2	5     fail times of the modulation signal.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, this signal, modulated at its upper limiit, is treated by a symetrising circuit comprising a capacitor 15, which  eliminates  the  low  frequencies  which render the<br>
3	0     modulated square wave assymetric  so as  to generate a<br>
trapezoidally  modulated  square  wave,  and resistances   16,   17 and a capacitor  18 which function io compensate for the distortion of the trapezoidal signal output from the capacitor 15. In effect, the symetrising circuit comprising the 3 5     components 15 to 18 constitutes a pass band filter, which passes the frequency of the square wave and its first<br><br>
harmonics  and  which  excludes  the frequences  which  distort -the symetrical form of the signal. Referring to Figure 2 a square wave signal modulated and symetric is  thus produced.<br>
As  shown in Figure  1   the current measurement circuit further comprises a mutual inductance transformer 3,  the signal of which represents the derivative of the current which passes  in the phase Fl of an a.c. network. This signal is supplied to the integrator circuit 2  and after to the  analogue-digital converter 5. The integration circuit 2 comprises an amplifier 20 having a feedback loop formed of a capacitor 21  and a resistance 22 which control the integration of the signal of the  transformer. The circuit further comprises a coupling capacitor 23 connected at the output of the  amplifier upstream of the feedback loop,  which changes the characteristics of the circuit in order to suppress low frequencies and dc signals, and a gain limiting  resistance 24  which  prevents  the  saturation  of the amplifier.  A voltage divider 24, 25  is connected at the  output of the circuit upstream of the converter 5. In effect, these elements  of the circuit correspond to the circuit described  in EP 0 403 330 which supplies a signal corresponding to the integral of the  signal of the transformer without parasitic effects and distortions of the signal.<br>
The current measurement circuit forms part of an input circuit of an electricity meter which further comprises a voltage measurement circuit 4,  comprising  a  voltage  divider comprised .of two resistances 26, 27. The input circuit of the present invention is different from that of the circuit of EP 0 403 330 in that there is no phase correcting element in the voltage signal path, the capacitor 28 functioning only to attenuate undesired high frequencies.  1 hat is,  the phase correction elements  are formed by the capacitor 29 and the resistance 30 which function in combination with the resistances 22 and 31 to correct the phase in the current path so that the current and voltage paths are in phase at the input of the analogue to<br><br>
digital converter. The current path further comprises  a capacitor  32  which  attenuates  undesired high  frequencies.  The capacitors 28 and 32 are optional and may be omitted in other embodiments.<br>
5<br>
The signal from the dither circuit is added to the signal received  from  the transformer 3  and supplied  to the integration circuit at the point 33. The combination of the signals is then integrated in order to create a signal<br>
10     representing  the  image  of the  current measured  by  the<br>
transformer dithered by a dither signal having the form of a triangular  waveform modulated  by  a  trapezoid.  The  amplitude of the waveform and of the modulation signal are chosen to create a dither signal comprising a triangular signal 30 having<br>
15     an  amplitude  corresponding  to  several  quantisation  steps   of the converter modulated at each  limit  by  an  amplitude corresponding to at least half a quantisation step. The signal is then supplied to the input of the analogue to digital converter. As described in  the introduction above, the use  of a signal<br>
2 0     having  this  form  improves  the  resolution of the  signal  by  the converter.  After the step of conversion the dither signal can be removed  using  a digital decimation  filter or other known means, for example, by the conversion of the anlogue dither signal to a digital signal and the subtraction of this signal from the  signal representing the combined values of the current and dither signal. The current and voltage signal thus calculated can be used in a calculation of the energy consumed etc.<br><br><br>
