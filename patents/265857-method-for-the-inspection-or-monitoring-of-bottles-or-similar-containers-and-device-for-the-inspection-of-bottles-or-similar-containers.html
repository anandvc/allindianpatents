				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method in accordance with generic term in patent claim 1 as well<br>
as to a device for the inspection of bottles or similar containers, in particular to a full bottle or<br>
a full container inspection device in accordance with generic term 22 or 32. An inspection<br>
device is the subject of the claim 36.<br>
The task of the invention is it to document a method, which facilitates a reliable inspection of<br>
containers filled with a liquid or a liquid filling substance (also full bottles or full containers)<br>
for possible presence of solids or foreign bodies with high output (inspected containers per<br>
unit of time). A method has been developed to find a solution to this task according to the<br>
patent claim 1. An inspection device is the subject of the patent claim 20 or 30.<br>
In the invention, the inspection of the containers takes place by means image recording and<br>
image evaluation and/or - analysis, and namely in the form that a reference image is<br>
generated of each container in a reference position or reference orientation of the container<br>
and this reference image is then compared with at least another image, also comparison- or<br>
monitoring image, which was generated by the same container in a position deviating from<br>
reference orientation or orientation in the area, whereby the image plane of the container<br>
area illustrated thereby in the processed or compared images (reference image and at least<br>
a further image of the respective container) or in containers deviating from this is identical or<br>
essentially identical. In the simplest case, the deviating container orientation in the area is<br>
achieved during the image recording by maintaining the same image plane in a manner that<br>
the container concerned is swivelled around an axis from its reference orientation, which is<br><br>
parallel or essentially parallel to the optical axis of the optoelectric sensors generating the<br>
reference image, as well as parallel or essentially parallel to the optical axis of the<br>
optoelectric sensor generating at least one monitoring image.<br>
The image areas of the respective containers recorded by the optoelectric sensors and/or<br>
used during the image processing are preferably identical or practically identical, so that<br>
during the evaluation of the reference image and of at least monitoring image, defects of the<br>
respective container, like blisters and/or inclusions in the container wall, burrs, grooves,<br>
scratch etc. are eliminated as insignificant image components for monitoring and/or remain<br>
unconsidered during the evaluation of the images.<br>
Further developments of the invention are the subject of the subclaims. The invention is<br>
described in detail in the following paragraphs using the figures with an embodiment.<br>
Fig. 1 Schematic representation of an inspection device in top view;<br>
Fig. 2 Individual representation of one of the transport components and/or a slide of the<br>
transport system of the inspection device of the Figure 1, together with a bottle;<br>
Fig. 3 Different process steps of the method according to invention for the inspection of<br>
bottles or similar containers made of a transparent material.<br>
In the figures, 1 is an inspection device (full bottle inspection device) for inspection of bottles<br>
2, which are manufactured from a transparent material, for example from glass or a<br>
transparent synthetic material, e.g. PET and are filled with a transparent filling material (e.g.<br>
beer, drinking- or mineral water, wine etc.). The examination and/or inspection of the bottles<br>
2 takes place for the solid or foreign matter present in the filling material, and namely visually<br>
by means of image recording and image processing or - analysis with a suitable image-<br>
detecting and image-processing system using optoelectric sensors.<br>
The bottles 2 to be examined are supplied to the inspection device 1 upright, i.e. with their<br>
bottle axis oriented in vertical direction, by means of an outside conveyor formed by a<br>
conveyer belt 3.<br>
Thereby, the bottles 2 to be examined arrive by means of a bottle intake 6 formed by a<br>
single-piece worm conveyor 4 and an intake star 5 at a transport system 7 of the inspection<br>
devicel, with which the bottles 2 are moved on an inspection section of this device. After the<br>
inspection, the bottles 2 are transferred again by means of a conveyor star 9 forming a bottle<br>
discharge to the conveyer belt 3, on which the bottles 2 are transported upright. Such bottles<br><br>
2, in which during the inspection foreign matter was found, are removed in an appropriate<br>
way on the conveyor 3.<br>
The transport system 7 consists, in the represented embodiment, of a horizontal and in top<br>
view oval guide 10, at which in uniform distances several movable slides 11 are provided<br>
along the guide 10 in a conveying direction A. Each slide 11 exhibits a gripping arm 12 for<br>
grabbing or holding a bottle 2 in the area of their bottle mouth 2.1 sealed with a plug 13, so<br>
that each bottle held at the bottle intake 6 by a gripping arm 12 is moved suspending on this<br>
gripping arm with the transport system 7 along the inspection section. Each gripping arm 12<br>
can be lifted and lowered e.g. by suitable cams for pick-up and settling the bottles 2 by a<br>
stroke, as this is suggested in the Figure 2 with the double arrow B, as well as at the same<br>
time also around a horizontal axis 21.1. That is, it can be swivelled in the represented<br>
embodiment around a horizontal axis parallel to the transportation direction A, as this is<br>
suggested in the Figure 3 also with the double arrow C.<br>
For moving the slides 11 and the gripping arms 12 provided at these along the closed oval<br>
path formed by the guide 10, all slides 11 are joined with a common flexible element, for<br>
example, a toothed belt 14, which is guided as closed loop, running parallel to the guide 10<br>
and arranged in a horizontal plane across two toothed belt wheels 15 and 16, by which a<br>
toothed belt wheel, i.e. for example the toothed belt wheel 16 is driven synchronously with<br>
the transportation star 5 and 9, so that the slides 11 are moved along the guide 10 in the<br>
transportation direction A and also a trouble-free transfer of each bottle 2 from the<br>
transportation star 5 to a gripping arm 12 as well as from a gripping arm 12 to the<br>
transportation star 9 is ensured.<br>
In the area of the deflecting- or toothed belt wheel 16 for the toothed belts 14 running within<br>
the guide 10, the bottle intake 6 and the bottle discharge 8 are provided, so that the larger<br>
part of the transportation distance of the transport system 7 is available as inspection<br>
section.<br>
Three optoelectric sensors in the form of a camera 17, 18 and 19 are provided at the<br>
transport- or inspection section formed by the transport system 7 in the represented<br>
embodiment, which are a part of an image recording and processing- or analysis system,<br>
which in addition to the cameras 17-19 also exhibit a computer-aided electronic system 20<br>
formed by the computer for image processing and/or image analysis.<br>
The important process steps of the inspection method carried out with the inspection device<br>
1 are represented in the positions a - e of the Figure 3. The bottles 2 supplied by means of<br><br>
the conveyer belt 3 and/or the outside conveyor are seized in each case by a gripping arm<br>
12 at the container intake 6 and are moved past the first camera 17 with their bottle axis<br>
oriented in vertical direction, with which a first image or reference image of the respective<br>
bottle 2 (position a of the Figure 3) is generated. Thereby, the camera 17 is so adjusted<br>
and/or oriented that it records, according to experience regarding possible present foreign<br>
matter, very critical image area 17.1 of the respective bottle 2 i.e. a image area 17.1, which<br>
in particular also includes the plug 13 opposite bottle base 2.2, at which according to<br>
experience, solid or foreign matter primarily settles, as long as they are present in a bottle 2.<br>
In case of further movement of the respective bottle 2 with the transport system 7, then for<br>
example ..shaking" takes place by means of repeated swivelling of the gripping arm 12 and<br>
concomitantly the bottle 2 around the gripping arm swivelling axis 12.1, and namely from the<br>
vertical orientation in an angle for example up to 80° or more (e.g. up to 100°) to the left and<br>
to the right, in order to loosen the foreign matter present and sticking in respective bottle 2<br>
at the inner surface of the bottle 2 (position b of the Figure 3).<br>
Subsequently, the respective bottle is moved into inclined position, so that the bottle axis<br>
with the vertical one contains an angle smaller than 90°, which opens downwards, the bottle<br>
with its base 2.2 points diagonally downwards (position C of the Figure 3). In this position, in<br>
which solid or foreign matter is available so long, till they drop or deposit in the angular area<br>
formed between the bottle base and the peripheral wall of the bottle 2, each bottle 2 is<br>
moved past the camera 18 for generating a further image or a first monitoring image. The<br>
camera 18 is so adjusted that it records an image area 18.1 of the respective bottle 2, which<br>
is identical to the image area 17.1. Due to the swivelled position of the bottles 2 moved past<br>
the camera 18, then the image area 18.1 is also accordingly rotated, with reference to the<br>
respective bottle and/or its axis, but identical to the image area 17.1. The rotation of the<br>
image area 18.1 is compensated for example by software during image processing.<br>
Subsequently, the respective bottle 2 is swivelled into an inclination opposite to the<br>
inclination of the position C, so that the bottle axis encompasses with the vertical one again<br>
an angle less than 90°, which opens downwards, the bottle with its base 2.2 points<br>
diagonally downwards (position D of the Figure 3). In this position, each bottle 2 is moved<br>
past the camera 19 for generating a further image or a second monitoring image. The<br>
camera 19 is so adjusted that it records from the respective bottle 2 an image area 19.1,<br>
which is once again identical to the image area 17.1. Due to the swivelled position of bottles<br>
2 moved past the camera 19, then the image area 19.1 is also accordingly rotated, with<br>
reference to the respective bottle and/or its axis however identical to the image area 17.1, so<br>
that for the evaluation of images of identical image areas 17.1, 18.1 and 19.1.<br><br>
The analysis of each bottle 2 with reference to solid or foreign matter present in the bottle<br>
takes place in the electronic system 20 from the comparison of the images generated by the<br>
cameras 17, 18 and19. The method of analysis on the comparison of images is based on the<br>
knowledge that foreign matter present in a bottle 2 exhibit, particularly also after swivelling<br>
or shaking (position b of the Figure 3) at least partly in the second and/or third image<br>
generated by the camera 18 and/or 19, a different position than in the image produced by<br>
the camera 17 or 18, while however defects in the respective bottle 2, e.g. blisters,<br>
inclusions, scratches, burrs etc. in or on the bottle wall in the images of the cameras 17-19<br>
are in form and position practically identical and thus as for the inspection and/or the<br>
monitoring result unimportant features during the image processing or image analysis<br>
remains unconsidered. It is important for this in this embodiment of the invention that the<br>
respective bottle 2 is swivelled for the two monitoring images only around a single axis,<br>
which is the optical axis of the cameras 17 -19 or is oriented parallel to their optical axis and<br>
runs for example vertical or radial to the bottle axis.<br>
After passing the camera 19, each bottle 2 is tilted back again into its vertical position<br>
(position e of the Figure 3) and transfer by means of bottle discharge device 8 to the outer<br>
conveyor and/or the outer conveyer belt 3.<br>
The image areas 17.1, 18.1 and 19.1 are for example selected in such a way that they<br>
record a range of approximately 30 - 35 mm over the bottle base 2.2 radial to the bottle axis<br>
in each case the total bottle diameters and in the direction of the bottle axis. In order to<br>
achieve a high quality during inspection, the cameras 17, 18 and 19 are so selected that<br>
they exhibit a camera or a image resolution of at least 0.15 mm per pixel or more, so that<br>
solids or foreign matter with a size of 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm can be recorded easily in<br>
transparent liquids contained in the bottles 2 and the error rate during the inspection is at<br>
maximum only 0.5 -1%.<br>
The image evaluation can take place then for example in such a way that foreign matter is<br>
found to be present, only if the evaluation of the image of the camera 18 and the camera 19<br>
shows foreign matter (AND-function), or if already the image of the camera 18 or the camera<br>
of 19 shows foreign matter (OR-function).<br>
Further characteristics of the inspection device 1 are e.g. that the slides 11 are guided with<br>
rollers at the guide 10 and that the carriage guide 10 is designed as self-cleaning, dry-<br>
running, lubrication-free and insensitive to dirt, in particular also in the manner that the<br>
contaminations caused by the system and/or by possible bursting bottles 2 cannot enter into<br><br>
the guide. It is ensured by swivelling the grip arms 12 around axes 12.1 parallel to the<br>
transportation direction A that a swivelling of the grip arms 12 is possible even in a very tight<br>
sequence of the slides 11 in transportation direction A. The cameras 17, 18 and 19 are<br>
provided in each case in plan view on the inspection devicel off-centre in relation to the<br>
carriage guide 10, for example the cameras 17 and 19 outside the loop formed by the<br>
carriage guide 10 and the camera 18 within this loop. Each camera 17, 18, 19 is assigned in<br>
each case a suitable lighting device.<br>
The invention was described above with an embodiment. It is clear that numerous changes<br>
as well as modifications are possible, without thereby deviating from the basic concept of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is for example possible to dispense with shaking or swivelling of the<br>
bottles 2 corresponding to the position b of the Figure 3 in modification of the above-<br>
described operating sequence and/or to provide only two cameras in place of three cameras,<br>
for example only the cameras 17 and 19, of which the camera 17 serves again for the<br>
generation of the reference image and the camera 19 for the actual recording of foreign<br>
matter or foreign particles in the filled bottles 2, i.e. for the generation of the monitoring<br>
image.<br>
The invention was described above in such a way that exclusively transparent containers<br>
filled with transparent filling materials in the presented invention should be examined. The<br>
present invention is however not limited to such applications. Rather also the inspection of<br>
non-transparent or translucent containers and/or the inspection of non-transparent or<br>
translucent liquids fall into the protection area of the present invention.<br>
Since with such applications mentioned earlier, inspection devices operating on optical path<br>
do not lead to meaningful results, methods are provided according to the invention, which<br>
are in a position to penetrate the non-transparent or translucent components yielding an<br>
image. In these methods, it can concern for example those, which work with transmitters for<br>
radiation within the range of the infrared radiation, or also the x-rays.<br>
For example, the area matrix sensors are provided as reception components for<br>
electromagnetic radiation, which serve in the long run for the generation of an image of the<br>
object to be examined, which can be evaluated in a desired manner.<br>
A characteristic of the inspection device 1 is also still in the fact that the pre-table 21 of the<br>
inspection device 1 forming the bottle intake 6 and the bottle discharge 8 and exhibiting the<br>
suitable components is so developed that the single-piece worm conveyor 4 and the two<br>
transportation stars 5 and 9 can be removed and/or avoided, so that the bottles 2 can be<br><br>
directed on the conveyor belt 3 or on the external conveyor formed by this conveyor belt at<br>
the inspection device 1, so that a unit exhibiting the inspection device 1 can practically be<br>
operated without retrofitting periods also without the inspection device 1 and/or by avoiding<br>
the inspection devicel.<br>
A further characteristic of the present invention is in the fact that an inspection device was<br>
developed, in which the bottles 2 are held at flexible components, for example toothed belt<br>
14 and moved past the inspection stations by means of an essentially linear movement.<br>
Through this procedure, the present inspection device is adopted to the respective spatial<br>
conditions with low structural expenditure. Likewise the treatment section, and thus also the<br>
treatment- or inspection time can be extended or shortened at will. Additionally, almost as<br>
many as desired treatment- or inspection stations can be arranged on the treatment section.<br>
Thereby, it is planned that the guide (10) of the flexible component runs at least on partial<br>
sections in curve-form and/or circular form and/or arc-form and/or in straight-line, in order to<br>
be able to adapt the treatment section fast and economically to the set requirements.<br><br><br><br>
