				<td>APPARATUS FOR RECEIVING AND DISTRIBUTING CASH<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and systems for receiving and distributing cash. In particular, the present invention provides a novel apparatus for the inflow and outflow of a variety of cash.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of automated cash systems such as automated teller machines (ATM) and other automated cash handling systems has become prevalent in the last several years. These systems arc used for the deposit and withdrawal of cash, by tellers in banks, and to deposit and distribute currency in a retail setting.<br>
A customer using an ATM will typically have a card or token with an identifying numerical sequence thereon that is inserted into the ATM, permitting the customer to deposit or withdraw funds from a bank account without interacting with a human teller. One substantial advantage of the ATM is the capability to transact bank business outside normal banking hours. A typical ATM will include a mechanism to dispense cash notes stored within the ATM in response to a customer's request. In order to maintain an accurate record of the customer's account, many ATMs also include a mechanism to detect and count cash notes dispensed. However, many ATMs do not include a mechanism to count and confirm deposited cash. In addition, many ATMs do not include mechanisms to recycle and dispense deposited cash.<br>
Other types of automated banking machines are used to count and dispense cash. These machines are often used by tellers or customer service representatives in banking and other transaction environments. Other automated distribution systems are used in retail settings (e.g., to give change to customers making purchases with cash).<br>
Automated cash machines are typically used in retail and bank settings where space is at a premium. Most currently available systems are large and take up considerable space. What is needed is a cost-effective, small profile system with cash recycling capabilities.<br>

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and systems for receiving and distributing cash. In particular, the present invention provides a novel apparatus for the inflow and outflow of a variety of cash. Currently available systems for the inflow and outflow of cash have several disadvantages relative to the systems of the present invention.<br>
For example, the Cross International HT 8000 (Cross International Technologies) is able to accept multiple denominations of notes but recycle only one denomination of notes and is relatively expensive ($50,000).<br>
THE FACT - Asp (Fujitsu ICL Financial Services Division) is able to accept six denominations of coins and three denominations of notes but is only able to recycle two note denominations. Diebold markets the CashSource Plus 400P. This is primarily a cash dispenser, where the merchants may refill the unit themselves with in-store-cash.<br>
CashGuard makes a product that recycles notes and coins. However, the user must sort the notes into different slots in the machine by hand. The users may also feed in only one coin at the time, as opposed to inputting a batch of coins that are automatically separated and sorted. De La Rue makes the TwinSafe II system. This unit recycles notes up to 8 different denominations, but is not capable of handling coins.<br>
In contrast, the cash handling system of the present invention is able to accept and recycle multiple denominations of cash (e.g., notes and coins), as well as currencies from multiple countries. The apparatus is much easier to use, due to the combination of both coin<br>
and note recycling, and through the countertop operation procedure. Novel design features result in an apparatus that is less than 30% of the size of currently available apparatus. Such an apparatus is uniquely suited for a variety of retail, public, and banking settings.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides automated cash handling apparatuses, systems, and methods for the intake and output of cash documents (e.g., notes and coins), hi some preferred embodiments, the apparatus is smaller than those currently available. In other embodiments, the apparatus contains a single cash transport belt system driven by a single motor, providing the advantage of using the same slot for the input and output of cash. In still other embodiments, the apparatus includes a single magnetic sensor controlled by an integrated software program. In yet other embodiments, the apparatus includes foam rubber drums for changing the direction of notes. The automated cash handling systems and methods of the present invention thus provide multiple points of novelty as well as advantages in efficiency of use.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A.        Cash Handling Apparatus<br>
Figures 1 -4 show the cash handling unit (also referred to as a note processing unit) of the present invention. Referring to Figure 1, an apparatus 100 of the present invention is a generally cylindrical or pipe-shaped apparatus. The apparatus comprises a slot 110 for the inflow and outflow of notes and a transport belt component 115 (not shown in its entirety, refer to Figure 2 below for a schematic depiction). The apparatus further comprises a note detection component (not shown in Figure 1) configured to confirm the integrity and value of deposited notes. The apparatus additionally comprises a note direction changer component (not shown in Figure 1) configured to direct notes into, out of, or past one or more note storage components (not shown in Figure 1). In further preferred embodiments, the apparatus 100 further comprises a coin recycling unit 120 for providing inflow and outflow of coins from the apparatus 100. The apparatus 100 further comprises an upper surface 125, which in preferred embodiments can be a countertop as described in more detail below.<br>
Figure 2 provides a detailed view of preferred embodiments of the apparatus of the present invention. The cash handling apparatus 100 of the present invention comprises a<br>
single transport belt component 200 for the transport of notes. The transport belt component 200 provides a single track 205 for the transport of notes. The transport belt component 200 comprises five coacting belts 210, 215, 221, 222 and 223. Notes are held between the belts 210, 215, 221, 222 and 223 as they are moved along the belt transport component 200. The belts 210, 215, 221, 222, and 223 are comprised of any suitable material, including but not limited, to rubber. The transport belt component 200 is controlled by a plurality of crowned wheelftelt pulleys (e.g., 230, 231,232,233,234, and 235) and is driven by a wheel 240. The transport belt components and pulleys also form what is referred to as a note sorting device.<br>
Figure 3 shows a side view of the motor and wheel assembly of an apparatus of the present invention. The wheel 240 (i.e., a driving belt pulley), which is preferably steel or plastic, contains a shaft 300 (preferably steel or plastic). A motor 310 turns the shaft 300, which turns the wheel 240, thus driving the movement of the transport belt  215. The present invention is not limited to the use of any particular motor. Any suable motor may be utilized, including but not limited to, those manufactured by Sonceboz and Mabuchi The crowned wheel/belt pulley 315 contains a shaft 320 to allow for the crowned wheel to turn. As can also be seen, a wheel 272 (preferably made of rubber) is turned by the shaft 271, which is driven by the motor 273.<br>
Referring back to Figure 2, the crowned whceltoelt pulleys (e.g. 230,231' 232, 233, 234, and 235) direct the transport belt component 200. The belts 221,222, and 223 also turn on crowned wheel/belt pulley assemblies (e.g., 235). The belts 221, 222 and 223 also serve to direct the belt transport component 200.<br>
Still referring back to Figure 2, notes are deposited through the single  opening 250 and travel along the transport belt component 200 to a detection component 255 An example of a note 260 between the two coacting belts 210 and 215 is shown in Figure 2. The present invention is not limited to any particular detection component- Any suitable detection component may be utilized in the apparatus of the present invention In some embodiments, the detection component 255 is a magnetic sensor (e.g., including but not limited to, magnetic sensors similar to those described in U.S. Patents 5,960 ,103 and 6,047,886; each of which is herein incorporated by reference). In some embodioments, the magnetic sensor is controlled by computer software and a computer processor In some preferred embodiments, the computer processor and software are integrated with the cash<br>
handling apparatus via an integrated circuit board (i.e., the same software controls the apparatus also controls the magnetic sensor).<br>
In other embodiments, the detection component is similar to the bill testing arrangement described in U.S. Patents 5,975,273 and 5,533,627 (herein incorporated by reference) are utilized to determine the authenticity and value of deposited notes. In still other embodiments, the detection component is similar to the sensor unit described in U.S. Patent 6,074,081 (herein incorporated by reference). In yet other embodiments, the detection component is similar to the illumination device and sensor described in U.S. Patent 6,061,121 (herein incorporated by reference). In still further embodiments, the detection component is similar to the detector described in U.S. Patents 6,101,266 and 5,923,413 (herein incorporated by reference) or the document sensor described in U.S. patent 6,241,244 (herein incorporated by reference).<br>
Counterfeit notes are returned to the user. In some embodiments, the user is also given a confirmation (e.g., on a user interface terminal or via a printed receipt) of the amount of cash to be deposited.<br>
Following confirmation of the integrity (e.g., whether or not the note is counterfeit) and value of the deposited notes, notes are directed further down the transport belt to one of a plurality (e.g., 4) of storage components 265. One of the storage components will now be described in more detail. Notes are directed into a storage component 265 via a note direction changer component 270. In some embodiments, the note direction changer component 270 comprises a wheel 271 (made of rubber in some preferred embodiments) and a shaft 272 driven by a motor 273. The direction of notes is changed by turning the currency around the wheel 271. To deposit notes into the storage component 265, the wheel 271 is turned in the opposite direction of the main belt 210.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the note direction changer component described above. Indeed, the present invention encompasses any component configured to direct cash (e.g., notes and coins) into and out of storage component 265, including but not limited to, the path selector mechanism described in U.S, patent 5,680,935 and the gate mechanisms described in U.S. Patents 6,109,522 and 6,170,818 (each of which is herein incorporated by reference).<br>
In some embodiments, the storage component 265 comprises first 266 and second 267 film storage drums and note storage drum 268. As notes are transported into the storage<br>
component 265, they are encased between first 276 and second 277 sheets of plastic film or foil or any other suitable material. The first 276 and second 277 sheets of plastic film are spooled on the first 266 and second 267 film storage drums, respectively. The plastic film 273 encasing the notes is wound around the shaft 269 in the note storage drum 268 until the drum is full. Each film storage drum 266 and 267 contains a shaft (e.g., comprised of steel) 280 driven by a wiotor 285 (See Figure 3). In some embodiments, the note storage drum 268 is capable of holding at least 100 notes. Each note storage drum 268 holds one or more types of notes. In some embodiments, greater than one of the drums 268 holds the same type of cash. For example, a more commonly deposited denomination may be contained on two or more drums and a less commonly deposited denomination or type of cash may be contained on only one drum. The amount of notes and note identifying information (e.g., value and issuing country) stored on each note storage drum is stored in memory by the integrated software element.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the storage components described above. Indeed, the present invention contemplates a variety of storage components, including but not limited to, the drums, cassettes and other storage components described in U.S. Patents 5,064,074, 5,628,258, 5,533,627 and PCT publication WO 00/31694; each of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention is configured to recycle deposited cash from all of the storage components 265. When a user wishes to withdraw cash or change is given, the amount to be dispersed is relayed to the cash handling apparatus (e.g., via a user interface terminal and keypad or automated). Cash is removed from one or more (depending on the value and identity of the cash to be dispersed) storage components 265 using the motor (also referred to genetically as drive components) 285 connected to the storage component 265 and the motor 273 connected to the currency direction changer component (also referred to a rotating note direction changer) 270. The motor 285 is reversed and notes are spooled out of the drum 265. In embodiments utilizing the cash direction changer wheel 271 shown in Figure 2, the wheel 271 is reversed (i.e., it is turned in the opposite direction of the main belt) by the shaft 272 and the motor 273. Cash is spooled out of the plastic film/foil 273 and onto the belt component 205. Cash is then transported along belt 215 and out the opening 250. In some embodiments, the user is then provided with a receipt indicating the value of the dispensed cash.<br>
The cash handling apparatus of the present invention is also configured for the in-and outfeed of coins. Figure 4 shows a view of the coin recycling unit (also referred to as a coin processing unit) 120 of the apparatus. All coins 405 are deposited in the coin receiving unit 410 in the cover 412. In preferred embodiments, the coin receiving unit 410 is generally cup-shaped. The bottom of the coin receiving unit 410 has therein an opening 407. An upper rotating planar member, preferably an upper rotating planar disk 415 forms a floor for the coin receiving unit 410 and rotates about an axis (not shown). The upper rotating disk 415 has therein a"hole 420 therein for receiving coins. In preferred embodiments, the hole 420 is generally, but not limited to a circular shape. Coins are separated by gliding one at the time into the hole 420 in the rotating disk 415. The upper rotating disk 415 is preferably designed so that only one coin at a time is removed from the opening 407 in the coin receiving unit 410. The coin is then transported by the upper rotating disk 415 past a sensor 422 that identifies the coins and causes the coins to be sorted. In preferred embodiments, the sensor 422 is a magnetic sensor and the coin is transported along its horizontal plane to the sensor 422. The coin is then transported by the rotating disk 415 to a position directly above one of a plurality of storage compartments e.g., 426, 427,428,429, 430, and 431. An apparatus of the present invention may comprise one or more storage compartments. Preferably, the coin is also kept in a horizontal orientation for this step.<br>
The apparatus further comprises a lower rotating disk 435 having an upper surface 440 and having therein a cutout 445. In preferred embodiments, the upper rotating disk 415 and lower rotating disk 435 rotate about the same axis. In preferred embodiments, the cutout 445 is generally circular in shape. The lower rotating disk 435, the upper surface 440 of which functions as a floor for the hole 420 in the upper rotating disk 415, rotates so that the cutout aligns with the hole 420 in the upper rotating disk 415 to open a passage to a preselected (i.e., by the coin detection component) storage compartment, 426,427,428, 429,430, or 431. The upper rotating disk 415 and lower rotating disk 435 then rotate into new positions, ready to receive or feed out new coins.<br>
In order to outfeed coins, the coins are lifted by a motor (also referred to as a drive component, not shown) from a storage compartment (also referred to as a coin storage component), 426,427,428,429,430, or 431, through the cutout 445 in the lower rotating disk 435 and placed into the hole 420 in the upper rotating disk 415. Preferably, the hole<br>
420 is configured so as to accept only a single coin. The upper rotating disk 415 then rotates, with the coin positioned in the hole 420, until the coin is deposited in the coin outfeed tube 425 . In preferred embodiments, all of the coins that are to be outfed during a particular transaction are accumulated into the outfeed tube 425 prior to deposit into the coin receiving unit 410. A motor (not shown) caused the coin(s) to be transported out into the coin receiving unit 410. In preferred embodiments, the coin processing component of the apparatus communicates with the note processing component.<br>
The cash handling apparatus of the present invention is configured for the deposit and recycling of a variety of currencies and denominations (i.e., processing of at least 4 note denominations and at least 5 coin denominations, including notes and coins from different countries). Unique design features including a single transport belt component 215, single magnetic sensor component 255, note direction changer 270 and a single opening 250, minimize the size of the apparatus. An additional design feature that minimizes size and complexity of operation is that the note processing component of the apparatus of the present invention operates in only two dimensions. This allows the cash to remain perpendicular to the sides and panels of the device without changing planes more than once. Furthermore, the apparatus of the present invention utilizes a single driving motor for the transport belt component. These unique features combine to result in cash handling systems that are useful in a variety of settings where the deposit and recycling of cash is performed.<br>
It will be further understood that additional apparatuses or systems of the present invention include a plurality of the individual units described above. Thus, in some embodiments, of the present invention apparatuses are provided that comprise at least one, or preferably two or more, individual cash handling units. These apparatuses can be arranged in a variety of configurations. For example, the individual units can be arranged side by side, or they can be physically separate, for example arranged at each checkout counter in a store. In preferred embodiments, the individual units are networked so as to be in communication with one another to act a single device or system.<br>
Of course, the coin processing unit and the note processing unit can be preferably be provided as a single unit (i.e., a cash processing unit), or optionally, as separate units. When the note and coin processing units are present in the same cash processing unit, the cash processing unit preferably comprises at least first and second opening, the first opening for the inflow of notes into the unit and the second opening for inflow of coins into the unit.<br>
The note processing unit and coin processing unit are preferably configured as described in more detail above. In preferred embodiments, the first opening is utilized for both the input and output of notes, while the second opening is used for both the input and output of coins. In some preferred embodiments, the cash processing unit is configured to process at least four different note denominations and at least five different coin denominations. The denominations can be denominations of the same or different countries. In other preferred embodiments, the complete cash processing unit is less than eight cubic feet in volume.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, the apparatus of the present invention may be installed in a countertop of a gasoline station, bank, grocery store or any other retail outlet or other setting where handling of cash is required. The apparatus of the present invention is not limited to use in particular countertop settings. Indeed, countertop is defined broadly herein to include any physical barrier between a customer or other user utilizing an apparatus of the present invention and the storage components of the apparatus. In preferred embodiments, notes and coins are fed through the countertop through the single openings for notes and coins. The notes and coins are then automatically sorted by the apparatus into different denominations and stored below the countertop in the note and coin storage components. The stored notes and coins are then recycled for outflow cash and fed through the single note and coin openings, across the countertop, to the customer. In particularly preferred embodiments, the great majority of the components of the note and coin processing units (e.g., the note and coin storage components, the note and coin detection components, the transport belt components, and coin sorting components) are located beneath the plane formed by the countertop. Indeed, in particularly preferred embodiments, the components above of the plane of the countertop occupy a volume of less than 300 cubic inches. In further preferred embodiments, the placement of note and coin input/output slots are configured for the convenience of the user. In these embodiments, the note and coin input/output slots are located than ten inches apart. In still further preferred embodiments, the accumulated distance that a user's hand has to travel in order to feed in a coin, receive an outcoming coin, feed in a note, and receive an outcoming note is less than thirty inches. In some embodiments, the countertop system is positioned so that it can be utilized in a self-service manner by customers. These embodiments are referred to as an apparatus or system configured to provide self service cash transactions.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the note processing apparatuses and systems of the present invention further comprise a magnetic card reader or other suitable identification device. It is preferred that the magnetic card reader is coupled with a processor that provides access to and communication with existing banking systems so that user's accounts may be credited or debited as appropriate when a transfer of notes occurs. As described in more detail below, the cash handling apparatuses and systems of the present invention may be used in conjunction with transport units and systems. When such a transport system is utilized, it is contemplated that the cash transfer transaction that occurs between the cash handling apparatus or system and the transfer unit is accounted for using a bankcard or other suitable device in conjunction with the identification device (e.g., magnetic card reader) and processor located on the cash handling apparatus or system.<br>
As can be seen, the apparatuses and systems of the present invention find a variety of uses. In particularly preferred embodiments, the apparatuses and systems provide for the reuse or recycling of money that is input into the system. In other words, money input into to the system by one user is stored and then is redistributed to another user of the system. It will be noted that the note processing systems of the present invention are compatible with automated teller machines (ATMs, also referred to generically as apparatuses configured to provide self-service cash transactions), and can be used in conjunction with ATM machines.<br>
The coin recycling unit of the present invention also has many unique features (although it should be noted the present invention does not require the presence each of these particular features). The unit features a single component, the upper rotating disk 415, that 1) separates coins from a batch of coins one by one; 2) transports the coins past a detection device; 3) transports coins to coin storage unit; 4) separates coins one by one during coin outfeed; and 5) transports the coins to an outfeed component. Furthermore, the coin recycling unit exhibits a great economy of space as the coins move less than 4 inches (vertical height) from infeed to storage to outfeed. The coin recycling unit is also different from previously described coin handling systems in that separation and transportation of coins is accomplished by rotating parts. Furthermore, the coin recycling unit of the present invention is different from prior art systems in that the coins are maintained in a horizontal orientation during coin separation, transportation, and storage. Additionally, separation and transport are performed with horizontally oriented components. Finaliy, the coin recycling unit of the present invention is unique in that the coins are stored in tube-shaped receptacles<br><br>
and are slacked upon each other. This is in contrast to other coin handling systems wherein the coins are stored in box and fed out through the bottom of the storage box.<br>
B.       The Apparatus in Use<br>
The cash handling systems of the present invention find use in a variety of commercial (e.g., retail) and banking settings. The following examples are illustrative and are not meant to limit the present invention. One skilled in the art recognizes that systems such as those of the present invention find utility in additional settings requiring the handling and recycling of currency.<br>
The cash handling systems of the present invention find particular utility in countries where a variety of currencies are utilized. For example, the capability of the apparatus of the present invention to recycle cash of multiple countries make it particularly suited for use in European Union (EU) countries where both the Euro and the currencies of the particular country are accepted. One can envision a customer entering a retail setting (e.g., a grocery store) in a EU country (e.g., Germany) and paying for a purchase in multiple denominations of Euros, Deutsch Marks, or a combination. The Euros and/or Deutsch Marks are input into an apparatus of the present invention. Depending on the customer's and business's preference, the apparatus provides change in multiple denominations of Deutsch Marks, Euros, or a combination. Alternatively, in a non EU country (e.g., in an Asian country), the customer pays for an receives change in the multiple denominations of the same currency. In some embodiments, the apparatus is run by an employee of the business. Alternatively, the entire transaction is automated, thus saving the added expense of hiring a cashier.<br>
In some embodiments, the apparatus of the present invention finds use in self service retail settings such as gasoline fueling stations. For example, many such stations comprise user serviced terminals attached to gasoline pumps for purchasing fuel. Such stations typically are used only for credit or debit card purchases. However, the apparatus of the present invention allows customers to purchase fuel with cash (e.g., notes or coins) of multiple denominations and receive change in multiple denominations.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention additionally finds use in bank settings (e.g., as an ATM or operated by a bank teller). In particular, the apparatus finds utility in banks in EU countries. Customers in such countries may desire to deposit and obtain funds in multiple currencies. For example, a bank customer in England may wish to obtain cash in<br>
Pounds and Euros. The customer can withdraw and deposit both Pounds and Euros into a bank account (e.g., via a teller operating an apparatus of the present invention or via an ATM). The apparatus of the present invention allows the teller (or ATM) to use a single cash handling apparatus for multiple cash deposits and withdraws, thus decreasing the added expense of purchasing multiple cash handling apparatuses for different currencies.<br>
In additional embodiments, the cash handling system of the present invention finds use in an international airport in cash exchange applications. Travelers arriving from another country enter cash (e.g., from their home country or Euros in an EU country or a combination) and receive cash of the destination country or Euros in an EU country, or a combination. The automated nature of the apparatus of the present invention, as well as its capability to input and output multiple currencies, make it particularly suited for such an application.<br>
C.       Transport Apparatus and Systems<br>
ATM and other cash management machines/systems currently available fall short of offering a complete cash handling system, which contains the cash in a closed circuit from the customer through the value chain all the way back to availability for the customer again. The systems presently available represent fragmented approaches to the cash cycle. The negative implications following from this include, inter alia, several severe security risks (robbery, fraud, counterfeit notes, etc), and poor cost efficiency.<br>
The present invention represents a novel and flexible approach to cash management, offering a potential user of the system options ranging from an in-shop apparatus for the inflow and outflow of a variety of currency, possibly and probably typically including a closed transportation system, which eliminates the risk of robbery, both in the retail shop environment and from the shop to the ATM or another apparatus - up to a complete system involving a complete cash cycle which comprises retail operators, security companies, commercial banks and the central banks/national currency institutions acting on behalf of the central banks.<br>
The present invention solves these problems by providing a novel apparatus for the inflow and outflow of a variety of currency (described in detail above), and a novel set of apparatuses for handling of a complete cash cycle. The present invention can be tailored to meet the customer's needs - ranging from a single apparatus for the inflow and outflow of a<br>
variety of cunrency to a comprehensive cash management system ("a complete cash cycle") - a system which handles the cash (currency) from the consumer in a retail setting through different channels until the cash again is available for the consumer. The process may carried out without ever dispersing the cash to a human handler - thus eliminating several risk factors present in current cash management systems.<br>
Accordingly, in still further embodiments, the present invention provides apparatus and systems for the transport of cash (especially notes) between cash processing devices such as those described above and other cash processing systems such as ATMs. The invention provides, in addition to a novel apparatus for the inflow and outflow of a variety of currency, a transportation unit which physically interfaces (e.g., connects) connects to the note processing unit described in detail above. The currency which is being withdrawn from or fed into the note processing unit is registered both by the note processing unit and the transportation unit by note detection devices (described above) and the information is stored in a processor. The transportation unit can subsequently, and according to the customer's needs, be brought either directly to a bank for registration or to a separate ATM or note processing unit which is compatible with the transportation unit, or to another apparatus, for inflow or outflow of currency. Preferably, the (transportation unit or the ATM or the apparatus) will identify worn out notes, which can be singled out and brought to the central bank's counting office for recycling.<br>
The current cash handling cycle can typically be described as follows. A customer pays in cash to a clerk, which deposits the currency in the shop's cash register. At the end of the day, the cash is balanced by the clerk, the store manager conducts the final operation with regard to balancing the cash, and the cash generated throughout the day is brought manually to a bank, a night safe etc., either by a store associate or a security company. The cash then undergoes numerous operations involving several manual operations (e.g., by a security company or a bank) before it is refilled into cash transportation boxes, manually refilled into ATMs or brought directly to a store. This cycle typically involves approximately 20 operations, and approximately three days are required for the completion of the cycle.<br>
In contrast, the novel apparatus(es) and cash handling/management system described herein involves 4-5 manual operations, without ever disclosing the cash to a human, and the duration of the cycle/process is negligible. This is because the clerk or the security associate<br>
etc. just needs to bring the transportation box to the nearest "separate ATM" to deposit or withdraw currency, according to the individual needs.<br>
The advantages following from such a system compared to the current cycle are numerous (although it will be noted that the present invention is in no way limited to these advantages). The security aspects are clear: Cash is never disclosed, which significantly reduces or evenxliminates the risk of robbery; the risk of internal irregularities is eliminated - again because the cash is never disclosed; there is no manual counting of cash; the system handles worn notes; the system detects false notes; the physical cycle is significantly reduced both with regard to the number of operations and the time required; the system is very easy to use; the system can handle different currencies; the system always provides the correct cash back; and the system always provides the correct payment.<br>
