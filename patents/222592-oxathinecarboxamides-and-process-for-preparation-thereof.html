				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   oxathiinecarboxamides   and   process   for preparation thereof.<br>
It is already known that numerous carboxanilides have fungicidal properties (compare, for example, EP-A 0 545 099, EP-A 0 591 699, DE-A 16 17 921, JP-A 2001-302605 and JP-A 8-176112). Thus, the oxathiinecarboxamides N-(4'-fIuoro-l,l'-biphenyl-2-y])-2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-l,4-oxathiine-3-carboxamide, N-(3'-fluoro-l,l'-biphenyl-2-yl)-2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-l,4-oxathiine-3-carboxamide, N-(2'-fluoro-l,l'-biphenyl-2-yl)-2-methyI-5,6-dihydro-l,4-oxathiine-3-carboxamide, N-(3'-chloro-1, l'-biphenyl-2-yl)-2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-1,4-oxathiine-3-carboxamide and N-(3'-methyl-l,1'-bipheny]-2-yl)-2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-l,4-oxathiine-3-carboxamide are already known from EP-A 0 545 099. The activity of these substances is good; however, in some cases, for example at low application rates, it is unsatisfactory.<br>

n         represents 3,4 or 5 and<br>
R5 represents identical or different radicals from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, cyano, nitro, C1-C8-alkyl, C1-C8-alkoxy, C1-C8-alkylthio, C1-C6-haloalkyl, C1-C6-haloalkoxy or C1-C6-haloalkylthio having in each case 1 to 13 fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine atoms.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that oxathiinecarboxamides of the formula (I) are obtained when<br>
a)        carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula (II)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
G        halogen, hydroxyl or C1-C6-alkoxy,<br>
are reacted with aniline derivatives of the formula (EQ)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R, R1 and m are as defined above,<br>
if appropriate in the presence of a catalyst, if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent, or b)        carboxamide derivatives of the formula (IV)<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R1 and m are as defined above,<br>
are reacted with boronic acid derivatives of the formula (V)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>

are reacted with phenyl derivatives of the formula (VII) Br<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R is as defined above<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, if appropriate in the presence of a an acid binder<br>
and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent,<br>
or<br>
d)       carboxamide derivatives of the formula (IV)<br><br><br>

Finally, it has been found that the novel oxathiinecarboxamides of the formula (I) have very good microbicidal properties and can be used for controlling unwanted micro-organisms both in crop protection and in the protection of materials.<br>

The active compounds according to the invention also have very good fortifying action in plants. Accordingly, they can be used for mobilizing the defences of the plant against attack by unwanted micro-organisms.<br>
In the present context, plant-fortifying (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants such that, when the treated plants are subsequently inoculated with unwanted micro-organisms, they show substantial resistance against these micro-<br>
	organisms.<br>
In the present case, unwanted micro-organisms are to be understood as meaning<br>
phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Accordingly, the substances according<br>
to the invention can be used to protect plants for a certain period after the treatment<br>
        against attack by the pathogens mentioned. The period for which protection is<br>
provided generally extends over 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the<br>
treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations<br>
	required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of<br>
plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
Le A 35 608-Foreign countries<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
	At certain concentrations and application rates, the active compounds according to<br>
the invention can also be used as herbicides, for influencing plant growth and for controlling animal pests. They can also be used as intermediates and precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
	The active compounds according to the invention can be used to treat all plants and<br>
parts of plants. By plants are understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or<br>
	combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the<br>
plant varieties which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds<br>
	and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and<br>
vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and the parts of plants with the active compounds<br>
	according to the invention is carried out directly or by action on their surroundings,<br>
habitat or storage space, according to customary treatment methods, for example by<br>
dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, spreading-on and, in the<br>
case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating. 30<br>
Le A 35 608-Foreign countries<br>
In the protection of materials, the compounds according to the invention can be employed for protecting industrial materials against infection with, and destruction by, undesired micro-organisms.<br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial materials which are intended to be protected by active compounds according to the invention from microbial change or destruction can be adhesives, sizes, paper and board, textiles, leather, wood, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other<br>
	materials which can be infected with, or destroyed by, micro-organisms. Parts of<br>
production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which may be impaired by the proliferation of micro-organisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the materials to be protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned within the scope of the present invention are preferably adhesives, sizes, paper and board,<br>
	leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer liquids, particularly<br>
preferably wood.<br>
Micro-organisms capable of degrading or changing the industrial materials which<br>
may be mentioned are, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime<br>
	organisms. The active compounds according to the invention preferably act against<br>
fungi, in particular moulds, wood-discolouring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes), and against slime organisms and algae.<br>
Micro-organisms of the following genera may be mentioned as examples: <br>
Alternaria, such as Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger,<br>
Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>
Coniophora, such as Coniophora puetana,<br>

Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli,<br>
Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and<br>
	Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Depending on  their particular physical  and/or chemical  properties,  the active<br>
compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions,<br>
emulsions,    suspensions,    powders,    foams,    pastes,    granules,    aerosols    and<br>
	microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds,<br>
and ULV cool and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under<br>
	pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is<br>
emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such<br>
as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous<br>
        extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at<br>
standard   temperature   and   under   atmospheric   pressure,   for   example   aerosol<br>
propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous 30 earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or<br>

else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for 5 example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
	It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
        The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 percent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such or in their<br>
formulations, also in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides,<br>
       nematicides or insecticides, to broaden, for example, the activity spectrum or to<br>
prevent development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are obtained,<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators, is also possible.<br>
	In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have<br>
very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic activity spectrum in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi, (for example against Candida species, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata), and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger and<br>
	Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The list of these fungi by no means limits the mycotic spectrum covered, but is only for illustration.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or <br>
the use<br>
        forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. Application is carried out in a<br>
customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting, dusting, foaming, spreading, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low volume method, or to inject the active compound 30 preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. It is also possible to treat the seeds of the plants.<br><br>
Le A 35 608-Foreign countries<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind<br>
of application. For the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound application<br>
rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and<br>
	1000 g/ha. For seed dressing, the active compound application rates are generally<br>
between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For the treatment of the soil, the active compound application rates are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
	As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts with<br>
active compounds according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetical<br>
	engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically<br>
Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably,  plants  of the  plant cultivars  which  are  in  each  case<br>
	commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br>
cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having new properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, varieties, bio- or genotypes.<br>
	Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used<br>
	according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest<br><br>
Le A 35 608-Foreign countries<br>
yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
	The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
                tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and<br>
	microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or<br>
viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits<br>
	and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton<br>
and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryHA, CryHIA, CrymB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb<br>
         and CryEF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants").<br>
Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to<br>
fungi, bacteria and viruses  by systemic acquired resistance  (SAR),  systemin,<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins<br>
and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased<br>
	tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example<br>
imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be<br><br>
Le A 35 608-Forcign countries<br>
present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD CARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), 5 StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucoton® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
	MI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for<br>
example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which<br>
	plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred 20 ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds and mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention is         illustrated by the examples below.<br><br>

Example 1<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
332 mg of 4'-chloro-2'-fluoro-l,r-biphenyl-2-amine and 268 mg of 2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-l,4-oxathiine-3-carbonyl chloride are added dropwise to a suspension of 207 mg of potassium carbonate in 25 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is stirred for  h. For work-up, ml of water are added to the reaction solution and the mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are dried with sodium sulphate and concentrated. The residue is chromatographed on silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 2:1).<br>
This gives 220 mg (39 %) of N-(4'-chloro-2'-fluoro-l,l-biphenyl-2-yl)-2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-l,4-oxathiine-3-carboxamide of logP (pH 2.3) = 3.61.<br>

The logP values given in the Preparation Examples were determined in accordance with EEC Directive 79/831 Annex V.A8 by HPLC (High Performance Liquid 5         Chromatography) using a reversed-phase column (C 18). Temperature: 43°C.<br>
Mobile phases for the determination in the acidic range: 0.1% aqueous phosphoric acid, acetonitrile; linear gradients from 10% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile.<br>
       Calibration was carried out using unbranched alkan-2-ones (having 3 to 16 carbon<br>
atoms) with known logP values (determination of the logP values by the retention times using linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).<br>
The lambda max values were determined in the maxima of the chromatographic signals      using     the     UV      spectra     from     200     nm     to     400      nm.<br><br>
