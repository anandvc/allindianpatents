				<td> The   present  invention   relates   to   dialkyl-halogenophenyl-substituted ketoenols compounds and process thereof.<br>
The invention relates to new phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols, a plurality of processes and intermediates for their preparation and their use as pesticides and herbicides.<br>
It has already been disclosed that certain phenyl-substituted cyclic ketoenols are effective as insecticides, acaricides and/or herbicides.<br>
Pharmaceutical properties of 3-acyl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones have previously been described (S. Suzuki et al. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 15 1120 (1967)). Furthermore, N-phenylpyrrolidine-2,4-diones have been synthesized by R. Schmierer and H. Mildenberger (Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985, 1095). A biological activity of these compounds has not been described.<br>
EP-A-0 262 399 and GB-A-2 266 888 disclose compounds (3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-diones) of similar structure, of which, however, no herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action has been disclosed. Unsubstituted, bicyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-355 599 and EP-A-415 211) and substituted monocyclic 3-aryl-pyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) with herbicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal action are known.<br>
Polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and lH-aryl-pyrrolidine-dione derivatives (EP-A-456 063, EP-A-521 334, EP-A-596 298, EP-A-613 884, DE 4 440 594, EP-A-613 885, WO 94/01 997 and WO 95/01 358) are furthermore known.<br>
It is known that certain substituted Δ3-dihydrofuran-2-one derivatives have herbici¬dal properties (cf. DE-A-4 014 420). The synthesis of the tetronic acid derivatives used as starting compounds (e.g. 3-(2-methyl-phenyl)-4-hydroxy-5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-Δ3- dihydrofuran-2-one) is likewise described in DE-A-4 014 420. Compounds of similar structure without details of an insecticidal and/or acaricidal activity are known from the publication Campbell et al., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, 1985, (8) 1567-76. Furthermore, 3-aryl-Δ3-dihydrofuranone derivatives having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are disclosed in EP-A-528 156, but the action described there is not always adequate. 3-Aryl-<br><br>
4-hydroxy-A3-dihydrofuranone derivatives are disclosed in EP-A-647 637. Thiotetronic acids are disclosed in WO 95/26345.<br>
The literature further discloses certain 3H-pyrazol-3-one derivatives, for example 1,2-diethyl-1,2-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4-phenyl-3H-pyrazol-3-one or {[5-oxo-l,2-di-phenyl-4-(p-su]phophenyl)-3-pyrazolin-3-yl]-oxy} [lacuna] disodium salt or p-(3-hydroxy-5-oxo-l,2-diphenyl-3-pyrazolin-4-yl)-benzenesulphonic acid (cf. J. Heterocycl. Chem., 25(5), 1301-1305, 1988 or J. Heterocycl. Chem., 25(5), 1307-1310, 1988 or Zh. Obshch. Khim., 34(7), 2397-2402, 1964). A biological action of these compounds, however, is not described.<br>
It is furthermore known that the trisodium salt of 4,4',4"-(5-hydroxy-3-oxo-lH-pyrazole-l,2,4(3H)-triyl)-tris-benzenesulphonic acid has pharmacological properties (cf. Farmakol. Toksikol. (Moscow), 38(2), 180-186, 1976). Its use in plant protection, however, is not known.<br>
In addition, EP-A-508 126 and WO 92/16 510 describe 4-arylpyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties.<br>
Certain phenyl-pyrone derivatives unsubstituted in the phenyl ring have already been disclosed (cf. A.M. Chirazi, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, Arch. Pharm. 309, 558 (1976) and K.-H. Boltze and K. Heidenbluth, Chem. Ber. 91, 2849), a possible utility for these compounds as pesticides not being indicated. Phenyl-pyrone derivatives substituted in the phenyl ring and having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal properties are described in EP-A-588 137.<br>
Certain 5-phenyl-l,3-thiazine derivatives unsubstituted in the phenyl ring have already been described (cf. E. Ziegler and E. Steiner, Monatsh. 95, 147 (1964), R. Ketcham, T. Kappe and E. Ziegler, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 10, 223 (1973)), a possible application as pesticides not being indicated for these compounds. 5-Phenyl-l, ii-thiazine derivatives substituted in the phenyl ring and having herbicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal action are described in WO 94/14 785.<br>
The activity and spectrum of action of these compounds, however, is not always<br>
completely satisfactory, in particular at low application rates and concentrations.<br>
The plant, tolerance of these compounds, in particular with respect to crop plants, is not always adequate. New compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The compounds are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks, and on paths and squares with or without tree plantings. Equally, the compounds can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial cultures, for example afforestations, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hopfields, on lawns, turf and pasture-land, and for the selective combating of weeds in annual cultures.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are very highly suitable for the selective control of monocotyledon weeds in dicotyledon crops pre- and post-emergence. They can be employed to very good effect for the control of grass weeds, for example in cotton or sugar beet.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents and/or foam-forming agents.<br>
In the case of the use of water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as auxiliary solvents. As liquid solvents, there are suitable in the main aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone,<br><br>
strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, as well as water.<br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates, as solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents there are suitable: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifters, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates as well as albumen hydrolysis products; as dispersing agents there are suitable: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Further additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound according to the invention can be present in its commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizing agents, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances or herbicides.

Brushtails<br>
such as Lepisma saccharina.<br>
Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non-living materials, preferably such as plastics, adhesives, sizes, paper and card, leather, wood and wood-processing products and paints.<br>
Very particularly preferably, the materials to be protected from insect attack are wood and wood-processing products.<br>
Wood and wood-processing products which can be protected by the agent according to the invention or mixtures containing the latter are, for example, to be understood as meaning: construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, vehicles made of wood, boxes, palettes, containers, telegraph poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiner's work or wood products which, quite generally, are used in building or joinery<br><br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, e.g. by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water-repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate colorants and pigments as well as further processing aids.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and wood materials contain the active compound according to the invention in a concentration from 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed is dependent on the nature and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. In use, the optimum amount to employ can in each case be determined by test series. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
The solvent and/or diluent used is an organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oleaginous poorly volatile organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents employed are preferably oily or oleaginous solvents having an evaporation number of over 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Poorly volatile, water-insoluble, oily and oleaginous solvents of this type used are appropriate mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or mineral oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Advantageously, mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C, petroleum or aromatics of boiling range from 160 to 280°C, turpentine and the like are used.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic poorly volatile oily or oleaginous solvents having an evaporation number of over 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be partially replaced by readily or moderately volatile organic chemical solvents, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of over 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide-fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, a part of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture or an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced. Preferably, aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like are used.<br>
Organic chemical binders used in the context of the present invention are the plastic resins and/or binding drying oils which are water-dilutable soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, e.g. polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene-coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as a binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. The binders used can also be bitumen or bituminous substances up to 10% by weight. Additionally, dyes, pigments, water-repellent agents, odour corrigents and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like known per se can be employed.<br>
According to the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil is preferably contained in the composition or in the concentrate as organic chemical binder. According to the invention, alkyd resins<br><br>
having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used.<br>
The binder mentioned can be completely or partially replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones such as benzophenone, ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
A possible solvent or diluent is, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Particularly effective wood protection is achieved by large-scale impregnation processes, e.g. vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can optionally also contain further insecticides and optionally also one or more fungicides.<br>
Possible additional mixture components are preferably the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are explicit constituents of the present application.<br>
