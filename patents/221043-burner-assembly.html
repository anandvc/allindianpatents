TITLE "BURNER ASSEMBLY "<br>
APPLICANT<br>
THERMAX LIMITED, HAVING REGISTERED OFFICE AT D-13, MIDC INDUSTRIAL AREA, CHINCHWAD, PUNE-411 019, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, AN INDIAN COMPANY<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
INTRODUCTION   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to improvements in the design and construction of fired heaters, such as Steam Generators, Hot Water Boilers, Thermal Oil Heaters, Air Heaters, Hot Gas Generators or any other fluid heaters and also other equipment involving combustion such as Direct Fired Vapor Absorption Heat Pumps.  In this invention these fired heaters are made compact by use of   an innovative approach.  It is a common knowledge that use   of high velocity in the convection section of a heat transfer equipment will result in increased heat transfer coefficient which in turn will reduce heat transfer surface area. It is also known that if combustion chamber pressure is increased, it results in reduced flame dimensions. However, there is at, greaff penalty/of high pressure drop when combustion chamber pressure and mm gas velocities are increased.  In this invention,  it is envisaged that by combining previously known methods of generating high pressure atr without use of external motive power, fired heaters could be made compact, by an order of magnitude change in their dimensions.<br>
There is also provided   a sTart up system) for the above invention. A new burner assembly" for the said improved configuration of fired heaters is also proposed.<br>
Use of a turbo charger / turbo compressor   is recommended in a novel manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Conventionally, all the fired heaters such as Steam Generators, Thermal Oii heaters, Air Heaters, etc. have the following major components related   to the process of heat transfer:<br><br>
a)  Burner for combustion of fuel;.<br>
b)	Heat transfer surfaces, both in radiation and convection section. The radiation heat transfer surface is generally a flame enclosure, which also acts as a combustion chamber.<br>
c)	Fan or blower to take care of pressure drop (hydraulic resistance) of this system comprising burner as well as gas passage through heat transfer surfaces. (In case of natural draught system, the pressure drop is matched with the draft created by the stack).<br>
There are practical limitations in desjgjiing^these^ systems, due to the fact that high velocity in the convective section results in higher pressure drop and calls for high fan power. One is therefore forced to work out an optimal balance between fan power and velocity to be used in these fired heaters.<br>
It is a well-known fact, that higher velocity in the convoctive section would give high heat transfer coefficient in the convection section. It is also known that higher the pressure in the combustion chamber, smaller will be the flame dimensions. It is however not practical to operate the combustion chambers beyond about 200-500 mm. fe^as one has to pay penajty in the fan power, which increases the operating costs. This is generally a practice followed in designing fired heaters with a few exception, where high fan power is tolerated to gain advantage of reduced size of the heater if space is not available.<br>
Thus, having arrived at a maximum allowable pressure drop in the system, one is forced to accept the size of furnace depending on flame<br><br>
dimensions and maximum possible velocity for the convection zone. The maximum velocity depends on available head.<br>
The Turbo Charger / Turbo Compressor has been in use for many years and it is mainly used for boosting combustion air pressure and quantities for Internal Combustion Engines (such as Diesel Engines). By use of Turbo Charger, Diesel Engines power is enhanced as a result of pumping more air into combustion chamber, which in turn, allows higher quantities of fuel to be fired for the same engine size. The Turbo Charger consists of a turbine section and compressor section, running on the same shaft. The turbine section receives flue gases from the engine prior to exhaust, and the power generated   due to drop in temperature   and pressure of the flue gases is used solely for the purpose of compressing incoming combustion air.<br>
In the current invention, it is envisaged that a Turbo Charger / Turbo<br>
Compressor be used in place of a fan for creating high pressure combustion<br>
air using residual temperature and pressure in the exhaust gases for<br>
generating power required for the compressor. Thus, it is envisaged that, a<br>
Turbo Charger can be gainfully used on the fired heaters which   will result in<br>
substantial reduction in the size of fired heater.	I<br>
On Internal Combustion Engines, the Turbo Charger   need not be operative right from the beginning.   The Engine can be started without Turbo Charger and it can run in a normal natural aspiration mode. Only when sufficient gas quantity and pressure is developed, Turbo Charger can be brought on-line. Thus, the start up system for IC Engines, has been well established. When the Turbo Charger is used on a fired heater, an innovative approach for start up is required.  In the absence of a fan, there is no way<br><br>
of firing the burner when Turbo Charger is not in operation. The current invention also describes the new start-up system.<br>
A combustion system consists of fuel fired burner.  In a conventionally fired system, heaters operate at an air pressure which does not exceed   approx. 500 mm. wc, and the burner designs are well established to operate under these pressure conditions. When a Turbo Charger is used, the combustion chamber will have to operate   at a much higher pressure requiring different configuration of the burner. If ihe new fired heater with Turbo Charger  is to be made compact, one need a compatible burner system. Therefore a new burner  assembly is introduced for operating combustion chamber at much  elevated pressure. It is suggested to make the fired heater-Turbo Charger   Start-up System, suitable for firing    multiple fuels like HSD, LDO, FO, LSHS etc. apart   from gaseous fuels like natural gas, LPG, Biogas, etc.<br>
Thus this invention in one aspect relates \o improved heat transfer equipment.<br>
In   another aspect, this invention also relates to new start up system for use in the improved heat transfer equipment.<br>
In   a third aspect it relates to novel way of using Turbo charger /Turbo compressor system.<br>
In   a fourth aspect, this invention relates to a new burner assembly for use in the improved heat transfer equipment and other heat transfer equipment.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR AT AND DRAW BACKS.<br>
It is already known to have heat transfer equipment of the common type, which are based on convective and radiative heat transfer.<br>
Connective-   cum   -  radiative   heat  transfer  equipments,   though   used   commercially   have characteristics /limitations/disadvantages of which a few are mentioned herein.<br>
a)	these require large size equipment and components which increases the initial cost of equipment, installation and space<br>
b)	the heat transfer co-efficient is limited depending upon the flue gas conditions, particularly limited by velocity of the products of combustion (flue gases) in convective sections used for heat recovery.<br>
c)	there is certain electrical power equipment for the combustion air fan.<br>
d)	certain amount of excess air level is required which has bearing on the overall efficiency.<br>
e)	the furnace has to be of a larger size in view of the large dimensions of length and diameter of the flame.<br>
f)	flexibility of adopting to various Applications is limited due to several constrains.<br>
Further Discussions on prior art.<br>
The applicant is aware of US Patents (1) 5192204 (2) 4424973 and observe as follows.<br>
(1)	US Patent 5192204 - This Patent relates to an atomizing multi-fuel burner and more particularly to a dual atomizing multi-fuel burner. An industrial multi-fuel burner units includes a central liquid fuel dispersion nozzle having conical outward directed liquid fuel sprayers. A primary mixer air outlet pipe of pressurized air is annularly disposed about the liquid fuel dispersion nozzle. These features are not present in the applicant's invention. There are further differences like provision of deflector vanes in the US Patent. The construction and operation of the US Patent is entirely different from the applicant's invention.<br>
(2)	US Patent 4429793 - This Patent relates to a power gas burner of the gun type. There is used a blower of turbo compressor type. Fuel gas is supplied through a eductor tube. The discharge end of the eductor is open and is located on the axis of the air tube in the throat of a ventury. These features clearly differentiate the US Patent from the applicant's invention.<br>
Neither alone or any combination of the two US patents can destroy the novelty and<br>
inventive character of the applicant's invention.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS :-<br>
The invention will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings which iUustrate the broad concept with reference to a particular Application only and is not be considered as limited thereof.<br>
In the drawings, Figure A shows the block diagram for heat transfer equipment based on newly invented   technology.<br>
Figure B shows   the new burner used in ths equipment.<br>
Figure C shows the new startup system developed for initial cranking of the turbo charger / turbo compressor.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS :-<br>
Figure A pertains to the total system of the newly invented heat transfer equipment wherein startup system (1) the details of which are shown in Fig.C and described in the following paragraphs uses the external air source(2)<br><br>
for cranking the turbo compressor (6) initially. The external air source (2) is utilized for less than 60 seconds .only. The air generated by the compressor(6a)<br>
is available   for burning fuel in the newly invented burner (14) the details of which are shown in Fig. B ar&gt;d described in the following paragraphs. After achieving sufficient pressure at ihejzir inlet duct of the burner, which is sensed by the pressure sw'tch (9)rthe pilot burner (3) is fired with the help of ignition spark in pilot gas path through ignition transformer (4). The fuel solenoid valve (10) .is switched on and the fuel starts burning in the combustion chamber (8). The energy released by the fuel further increases the speed of the turbo compressor (s) and allows it to run in stable, self sustained condition. The startup system (1) is switched off after achieving stable speed. The fuel firinQ rate &gt;s further increased. With the increase in fuel firing rate, the turbo compressor (6) achieves higher speed and correspondingly more air is made available for combustion. At full firing rate the rated speed of theturbO compressor (6) is achieved. The compressor (6a) of the turbo compressor (6) sucks fresh air through the air filter (7) and delivers it to the burner (14) at rated pressure and flow through the ducting (5): The burner (14) produces a very short flame within the combustion chamber (8). A small part "of the neat is transferred to the outside fluid (15) around the combustion chamber (8). The products of combustion produced are driven through first compact heat exchanger (11) and heat is transferred through convective heat transfer to the fluid outside (16?. Sizing of the first exchanger (11) is based on high velocity flue gases to achieve high heat transfer coefficient and suitable conditions of pressure and temperature at the entry of the turbine (6b) of the turbo compressor (6). The enthalpy of the flue gases available at the entry of the turbine (6b) is sufficient   to rotate the turbine and in turn the compressor (6a) to make the system self sustainable, without any external electrically driven fan. The flue gases coming out   of the turbine (6b) are then passed through<br><br>
intermediate ducting (13) to second compact heat exchanger (12). The remaining heat energy is further transfer to the fluid outside (15).   Sizing of the second heat exchanger (12) -is based on high velocity of the flue gases to achieve high heat transfer coefficient and achieve optimum utilization of the heat content in the flue gases before being exhausted to the stack (16). The external fluid (15) can be same or different for heat exchangers (11) &amp;(12) by suitable provisions as necessary.<br>
Figure B pertains to the newly invented burner as a part of the total system indicated in Figure A. The burner (14) consists of housing (17), burner red and nozzle assembly (18), pilot burner (3), ignition transformer (4), air inlet duct (5). primary     air difluser assembly (19), secondary air mixing assembly (20), view port (21) and flame detection device (22). The flame produced by burner is accommodated in   combustion chamber (8).<br>
The housing (1.7) is designed to with stand the high pressure of the combustion air. it is mounted of the wails of the heat transfer equipment (23). The burner rod   and nozzle assembly (18)   is of air / steam atomized  type. A gas fired pilot burner (3) is used for initial ignition of the main fuel. The pilot gas is ignited with help of an ignition transformer (4). The air required for combustion of the main fuel is received from the compressor (6a) of the turbo compressor (6) through the air inlet duct (5). The primary air diffuser assembly (19) produces strong turbulence to achieve thorough mixing of the primary air and the main fuel. The secondary air mixing assembly (20) consists of a number of   small opening at an appropriate angle which forces secondary air at high velocity to the flame. This particular arrangement completes the combustion instantly and within a small space: This arrangement helps in confining the flame within the combustion chamber (8).The combustion<br><br>
chamber is further connected to the %st compact heat exchanger (11). The flame detection device (22) senses the flame and gives signal to the control system to continue the process. The flame can also be viewed through the view port (21) provided on the housing (17) of the burner.<br>
Figure C pertains to the details of the new startup system as a part of the total system as indicated in Figure A. The startup system (1) consists of external air supply (2), fuel supply pipe (24), startup burner (25), suction port (26), butterfly damper (27) and mixing chamber assembly (28).<br>
A small quantity of air at high pressure of approximately 5 barg., is supplied by external air supply assembly (2). Due to the suction created by the device such as an eductor, almost double the quantity of air is sucked from the atmosphere through the suction port (26) and butterfly damper (27). The total air combined from external source (2) and suction port (26) is sufficient as combustion air for burning the startup fuel supplied through the fuel supply pipe'(24) of the startup burner (25). The products of combustion from the startup burner (25) are passed onto the mixing chamber assembly (28) at high temperature around 650°C. The mixing chamber assembly is connected between the first compact heat exchanger (11) and turbo compressor (6). The energy content of the products of combustion is sufficient for initial cranking of the turbine (6b) of turbo compressor(6). With the initial rotation, of the turbine (6b) and subsequently the compressor (6a), air is sucked by the compressor (6a) through air filter (7) and is delivered to the main burner (14) through air ducting (5). The quantity of air sucked by the compressor (6a) is sufficient for initiating the combustion in the main burner (14)., the speed of turbo compressor (6) increases and attains a stable condition where its operation becomes self sustainable. The startup procedure is completed at this point and the fuel supply<br><br>
to the start up burner (25) is switched off. External air supply (2) is switched off and butterfly damper (27) at the suction port (26) is closed.<br>

COMPARISON OF THE DATA PRESENTED IN	TABLE	1  &amp; 2	AND	<br>
CONCLUSIONS.						<br>
From the data available and observations on flame size / shape, heat transfer surface area, combustion air pressure etc. it is concluded that the claims made in the present invention have been verified practically and that it is possible to reduce furnace dimensions/ heat transfer area by an order of magnitude by using this new; concept without the need of externally; powered r; combustion air fan.<br><br>
These are only typical results and similar enhancement is possibia for other   arrangements/configurations/applications.<br>
DETAILED   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Conventionally, the heat transfer equipments used for the applications such as steam generator, hot water generator, thermic fluid heater, eir heater, hot gas generator, direct fired vapor absorption heat pumps etc. make use of radiative as well as convective heat transfer. The combustion equipment used in the system is a conventional burner which produces a substantially larga flame. The combustion chamber (furnace) is designed to accommodate the flame produced by the conventional burner. The electrically, driven fan is used to supply combustion   air through the burner and drive the products of combustion through combustion chamber and convective heat transfer surfaces. The size of combustion chamber is quite large due to limitation imposed by flame dimensions. The convective heat transfer surface and overall heat transfer equipment is quite large due to limitations imposed by power requirement for fanThe conventional burners require about 20-25% excess air for completing the combustion of fuel. The heat transfer surface area requirement is quite high due to comparatively low heat transfer coefficients.<br>
The attention was directed towards realizing more heat transfer per unit area under a given set of conditions by an improved process as compared to known process.<br>
In order to achieve the above objectives,  it was decided to enhance the convective heat transfer by increasing the velocity of products of<br><br>
combustion over the heat transfer surface. The velocity of products of combustion (flue gas) was increased to a level of 50 to 200 m/sec as compared to much lower level of velocity in conventional systems. The combustion air pressure was increased to overcome the resultant hydraulic resistance in the heat transfer equipment and also to achieve reduction in flame size,<br>
This resulted in the reduction of the heat transfer area ?nd nenc? in the size of the heat transfer equipment like steam generators,  hot water generators, thermic fluid heaters, air heaters, hot gas generators, direct fired vapor absorption heat pumps etc.<br>
Usage of higher flue gas velocities increases the   heat flux / heat transfer   coefficient several times. This results in substantial reduction in the heat transfer area and hence the size of the heat transfer equipment could be reduced several times.<br>
I	The increase in flue gas velocity also increases   the hydraulic<br>
resistance in the flue gas path considerably compared to conventional, radiative and convective heat transfer equipments. Air at substantially higher pressure is required to overcome this resistance. This is catered to by using a Turbo charger/ turbo compressor in the flue gas'path. The high pressure air also' considerably improves the combustion characteristics of fuels. The use of turbo charger / turbo compressor also eliminates the need for electrically driven fan which otherwise is a compulsory component in the conventional heat transfer equipments.<br>
In a turbo charger/turbo compressor, the turbine utilizes energy from the flue gases to drive the compressor mounted on the same shaft. The total enthalpy loss of flue gases to provide motive energy to the turbine uf turbo<br><br>
charger / turbo compressor is regained as enthalpy rise of the compressed air generated by the compressor of turbo charger / turbo compressor which in turn is delivered as combustion air to the system. Thus there is no loss of energy external to the system. Further heat is recovered from the flue gases at the outlet of the turbine of the turbo charger/ turbo compressor to reduce the flue gas temperature to a level comparable to any conventional heat transfer equipment.<br>
To realize the objective of compact   heat transfer equipment, it was also necessary to develop a new burner system which can accept combustion air at high pressure and also considerably reduce the flame dimensions. A new burner system was designed to accomplish these objectives.<br>
To accomplish the start up of the above mentioned equipment, a new hitherto unknown mechanism is used. The turbo charger / turbo compressor used in the system is cranked initially with the help of external air source for a period of less than 60 seconds. Within   this period, the operation of turbo charger / turbo compressor becomes self sustaining and the external air source is removed.<br><br><br>
