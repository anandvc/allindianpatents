				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of soluble polyanilmes by microemulsion technique. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of aqueous soluble polyanilmes by microemulsion technique in its conducting form. The polyanilmes prepared by the process of this inventin is in its conducting form, known as the emeraldme salt form. The emeraldine salt form of polyanilmes are usually insoluble in aqueous and most of the common organic solvents.<br>
Polyanilmes can be defined as materials composed of structural repeating units formed by two aniline molecules. These units can be either in reduced(amine) state or in an oxidised(imine) form. The most important type of polyaniline is emeraldine in which the participation of both reduced and oxidised states are equal. The unprotonated polyaniline, called emeraldine base is an electric insulator. The electric conductivity observed in polyaniline is associated with the protonated form, called emeraldine salt [W.S. Huang, B.D. Humphrey and A.G. MacDiarmid, J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans., 1, 82, 2385 (1986); A.G. MacDiarmid, J.C. Chiang, A.F. Richter and A.J. Epsteom, Synth. Met., 18, 285, (1987); A. Roy, G.E. Asturias, D.L. Kershner, A.F. Richter and A.G. MacDiarmid, Synth. Met., 29, 141, (1989)].<br>
Controlled   oxidative  polymerisation  of  aniline  in   the<br>
presence of acids yields polyaniline in its emeraldine salt  form<br>
[Macromol.,  26,  3254,  (1993)]. Emeraldine salt   form can be<br><br>
converted into emeraldine base by increasing the pH and can be reconverted by the same or different acid, to make it conductive [Yasuhisa Maeda, Ai Katsuta, Kunio Nagasaki and Masashi Kamiyama, J. Electrochem. Soc., 142, (1995), 2261, E. M. Genies and C. Tsintavis, J. Electroanal. Chem., 111, (1980), 111]. It is known that polyanilines, especially in the emeraldine salt form, are insoluble in aqueous solvents and most common organic solvents. It is intractable and very difficult to process [E.M. Genies, A. Boyle, M. Lapkowski and C. Tsintavis, Synth. Met., 36 (1990), 139] .<br>
The polyaniline family of compounds is considered as most attractive polymer material, due to their environmental stability, their well-behaved electrochemistry, electrochromism, moderately high conductivity on doping, low cost of raw materials and ease of synthesis. It can exist in several molecular forms, differing in chemical composition, structure and electrical conductivity. All these forms can be interconverted into each other by chemical or electrochemical oxidation [T. Kabayashi, H. Yoneyama and H. Tamura, J. Electronal. Chem., 161, (1984), 419].<br>
The synthesis of soluble polyaniline is of great interest since the formation of a soluble material is essential in order to facilitate post-synthesis processing.<br>
There are three possible methods for improving the processibility of polyaniline polymers :<br><br>
(1)- Formation of the polymer salt using an acid functionalised by a large non-polar substituent (counterion induced processibility),<br>
(2)	Prefunctionalisation of the starting monomer with a suitable group prior to polymerisation and<br>
(3)	Preparation of polyaniline dispersions. However the Polyaniline dispersions reported so far precipite rapidly.<br>
The present invention provides a process to overcome the drawback of insolubility of polyaniline, in its conducting form, namely the emeraldine salt,  in aqueous systems.<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide a process for the preparation of aqueous soluble polyaniline using microemulsion technique.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the synthesised soluble emeraldine salt is a very clear green solution which can be diluted to any extent.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of soluble polyaniline with increased storage stability.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of aqueous soluble polyanilines by microemulsion technique which comprises; polymerising of aniline or substituted anilines in an organic solvent in presence of mineral acid or<br><br>
sulphonic acid, and conventional oxidising agent as herein described at a temperature in the range of 0 to 60°C, in the presence of conventional surfactant and/or a co surfactant as herein described for a period ranging from 2 to 24 hours to obtain the product.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the substituted anilines used may be chosen from N-methyl aniline, N-ethyl aniline, 2-bromoaniline, 2-methyl aniline, 2,6-dimethyl aniline, 6-methyl aniline, 2-methoxy aniline, 2-ethoxy aniline, 2-methoxy-6-methyl aniline.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the organic solvent used to prepare the solution of aniline or substituted aniline may be selected from xylene, ethyl benzene and toluene and the like.<br>
In still another embodiment, the acid used is selected from mineral acids like hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulphonic acids like toluene sulphonic acid, methane sulphonic acid and the like.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the oxidising agent used may be selected from hydrogen peroxide, ammonium persulphate, potassium persulphate, potassium bromate, potassium iodate, sodium iodate, potassium dichromate, potassium permanganate, peracids and the like.<br><br>
In another embodiment of invention, the surfactant used may be selected from cetyl pyridinium chloride, cetyl pyridinium bromide, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, sodium dodecyl sulphate, benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, benzyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and the like.<br>

2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, the substituted anilines used are chosen from N-methyl aniline, N-ethyl aniline, 2-bromoaniline, 2-methyl aniline, 2,6-dimethyl aniline, 6-methyl aniline, 2-methoxy aniline, 2-ethoxy aniline, 2-methoxy-6-methyl aniline.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein, the organic solvent used to prepare the solution of aniline or substituted aniline solution is selected from xylene, ethyl benzene and toluene.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein, the mineral acid used is selected from hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid &amp; sulphonic acid such as toluene sulphonic acid, methane sulphonic acid.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein, the oxidising agent such as<br>
hydrogen peroxide, ammonium persulphate, potassium persulphate, potassium<br>
bromate, potassium iodate, sodium iodate, potassium dichromate, potassium<br>
permanganate, peracids are used.<br>
6.
