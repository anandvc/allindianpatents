IMIDAZOLE COUMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE AS ADENOSINE DEAMINASE INHIBITORS<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to novel imidazole compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their production and to a pharmaceutical composition containing the same.<br>
back round Art<br>
Adenosine (Ado) is an endogenous purine nucleoside released by cells as part of the normal metabolic machinery. Ado has wide variety of. biological activities, namely potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, protective effects in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemia, anticonvulsant effects and modulation effects of platelet aggregation, lipolysis, glycogenesis, blood flow and neurotransmission. Ado shows the biological activities by binding to its receptors anchored in the cell membrane.. Therefore, it is the beneficial treatment for many diseases to perform the pharmacological elevation of extracellular Ado concentrations.<br>
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) catalyzes an essentially irreversible deamination of adenosine or deoxyadenosine to inosine or deoxyinosine, respectively. In the last 10 years, ADA, which was considered to be cytosolic, has been found on the cell surface of many cells. Thus, blocking ADA activity with specific inhibitor is the potent way to elevate Ado concentrations in biological systems and the beneficial treatment for many diseases.<br>
Some compounds have known to have inhibitory activity of ADA (J. Med. Chem. 27, 274-278, 1984; iJbid. 31, 390-393, 1988; ibid. 34, 1187-1192, 1991; IJbid. 35, 4180-4184, 1992; ibid. 37, 305-308, 1994; ibid.  37&gt; 3844-3849, 1994; and WO98/02166).<br>
Known imidazole compounds with pharmaceutical activity other<br><br>
than ADA inhibitory activity are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,451,478 and W097/26883.<br>
Furthermore, some imidazole derivatives having ADA inhibitory activity have been reported, for example, as described in Drug Developement Reseach 28, 253-258, 1993.<br>

Adenosine Deaminase ADA Enzyme Assay Test Compound:<br>
l-(l-Hydroxy»4-phenyl-2-butyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (Example 1)<br>
Test method:<br>
The reaction velocity (V) is measured by a change in absorbance at 265 nm (A265) resulting from the deamination of adenosine. Human ADA was expressed and purified from ADA-deficient bacterial strain. Reaction mixtures in a total volume of 200 nl contained 25 mU/ml of ADA and varying concentrations of adenosine and test compounds in 10 mM phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). The reaction was started by addition of ADA to a mixture of adenosine and test compound. The reaction was followed at room temperature by recording decrease in A265 for 5 minutes in SPECTRAmax 250 (Molecular Devices, USA) to' automatically calculate Vmax. The inhibition constant (Ki) values of test compounds were determined by Dixon plot.<br>

BALB/c mice (male, 7 weeks old) were injected i.v. with 0.1 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in a total volume of 0.2 ml saline. Heparinized blood samples were taken one hour after LPS injection and plasma was collected by centrifugation. TNF-a (inflammatory<br><br>
cytokine) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) amounts in plasma were assayed by ELISA. Test compounds were administered 3 0 minutes before LPS injection.<br><br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The following Preparation and Examples are given for the purpose of illustrating the present invention in detail, but are not to be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Prpparation 1<br>
A mixture of methyl 4-imidazolecarboxylate (5.0 g) and ammonium chloride (539 mg) in aqueous 28% NH3 solution (75 ml) was heated at<br>
100°C in a steel sealed tube for 5.5 hours.  After cooling, the<br>
reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was stirred in a mixed solvent of acetone, ethanol and water (5:5:1, total 25 ml). The resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with the same mixed solvent, and dried in vacuo to give 4-imidazolecarboxamide (4.63 g) as a white solid.<br>
mp: 211-214°C<br>
IR (KBr): 3500-2600, 1652 cm'1<br>
NMR (DMSO-d6,  δ):     7.06 (1H, br s), 7.34 (1H, br s), 7.58 (1H, S), 7.69 (1H, s)<br>
MASS:' 112 (M+H) +<br><br>
Preparation 2<br>
Triethylamine (583 mg) was added dropwise to a stirred mixture of ethyl (R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrate (1.0 g) and methanesulfonyl chloride (660 mg) in dichloromethane (10 ml) at ice-bath temperature. After 40 minutes, the reaction mixture was partitioned between dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was washed with brine,<br>
dried over magnesium sulfate , and concentrated in vacuo to give ethyl (R)-2-methylsulfonyloxy-4-phenylbutyrate (1.37 g) as an oil. This material was used immediately without further purification. NaH (60% in mineral oil, 192 mg) was added to a solution of 4-imidazolecarboxamide (534 mg) in DMF (8 ml) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 0 minutes. The methanesulfonate prepared above was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 3 hours at 60°C.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to 10°C in an ice bath, and the insoluble material was filtered and washed thoroughly with methylene chloride.

of ethyl 2-(4-carbamoyl~l-Lmidazciyi)-4-phenylbutyrate (obtained in Preparation 2) (391 mg) in methanol (20 mi) under an nitrogen atmosphere. After the addition was completed, the reaction mixture<br><br>
was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Water was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for several minutes and then evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned between chloroform and water. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave 1-(l-hydroxy-4-phenyl-2-butyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (347 mg) as a white solid, mp: 127.0-129.5°C<br>
