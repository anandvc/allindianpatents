				<td>Method for increasing the In-Vitro Biological Potency of a Non-Glycosylated<br>
Interferon-Beta, conjugate so produced and compositions with such conjugate<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention is in the fields of protein biochemistry and the<br>
pharmaceutical and medical sciences. In particular, the invention provides<br>
methods for the production of conjugates between water-soluble polymers<br>
(e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) and derivatives thereof) and cytokines (e.g.,<br>
interferon-beta), which conjugates have increased potency compared to<br>
polymer conjugates of the same cytokine synthesized by standard methods.<br>
The invention also provides conjugates produced by such methods,<br>
compositions comprising such conjugates, kits comprising such conjugates<br>
and compositions and methods of use of the conjugates and compositions in<br>
preventing, diagnosing and treating- a variety of medical and veterinary<br>
conditions. The invention also provides methods of determining the site(s) of<br>
attachment of polymers by reductive alkylation under certain conditions.<br>
Related Art<br>
[0002]	The following description of related art includes interpretations of the<br>
present inventors that are not, themselves, in the prior art. Cytokines are<br>
secreted regulatory proteins that control the survival, growth, differentiation,<br>
and/or effector function of cells in endocrine, paracrine or autocrine fashion<br>
(reviewed in Nicola, N.A. (1994) in: Guidebook to Cytokines and Their<br>
Receptors, Nicola, N.A., ed., pp. 1-7, Oxford University Press, New York).<br>
Because of their potency, specificity, small size and relative ease of<br>
production in recombinant organisms, cytokines have many potential<br>
applications as therapeutic agents.<br>
[0003]	Two key factors have hindered the development of cytokines, in<br>
particular, and recombinant proteins, in general, as therapeutic agents - their<br>
generally short half-lives in the circulation and their potential antigenicity and<br>
immunogenicity. As used herein and generally in the art, the term<br><br>
"antigenicity" refers to the ability of a molecule to bind to preexisting<br>
antibodies, while the term "immunogenicity" refers to the ability of the<br>
molecule to evoke an immune response in vivo, whether that response involves<br>
the formation of antibodies (a "humoral response") or the stimulation of<br>
cellular immune responses.<br>
[0004]	For the administration of recombinant therapeutic proteins, intravenous<br>
(i.v.) administration is often desirable in order to achieve the highest<br>
circulating activities and to minimize problems of bioavailability and<br>
degradation. However, the half-lives of small proteins following i.v.<br>
administration are usually extremely short (see examples in Mordenti, J.,<br>
et al, (1991) Pharm Res 8:1351-1359; Kuwabara, T., et al, (1995) Phann Res<br>
72:1466-1469). Proteins with hydrodynamic radii exceeding that of serum<br>
albumin, which has a Stokes radius of about 36 Å and a molecular weight of<br>
about 66,000 Daltons (66 kDa), are generally retained in the bloodstream by<br>
healthy kidneys. However, smaller proteins, including cytokines such as<br>
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), interleukin-2 ("IL-2"),<br>
interferon-alpha ("IFN-alpha") and interferon-gamma ("IFN-gamma"), are<br>
cleared rapidly from the bloodstream by glomerular filtration (Brenner, B.M.,<br>
et al., (1978) Am J Physiol 234:F455-F460; Venkatachalam, M.A. et al,<br>
(1978) Circ Res 43:337-347; Wilson, G., (1979) J Gen Physiol 74:495-509;<br>
Knauf, MX, etal., (1988) J Biol Chem 263:15064-15070; Kita, Y., et al.,<br>
(1990) Drug Des Deliv 6:157-167; Rostaing, L., et al., (1998), J Am Soc<br>
Nephrol 9:2344-2348). As a result, the maintenance of therapeutically useful<br>
concentrations of small recombinant proteins in the circulation is problematic<br>
following injection. Therefore, higher concentrations of such proteins and<br>
more frequent injections typically must be administered. The resulting dose<br>
regimens increase the cost of therapy, decrease the likelihood of patient<br>
compliance and increase the risk of adverse events, e.g., immune reactions.<br>
Both cellular and humoral immune responses can reduce the circulating<br>
concentrations of injected recombinant proteins to an extent that may preclude<br>
the administration of an effective dose or may lead to treatment-limiting<br><br>
events including accelerated clearance, neutralization of efficacy and<br>
anaphylaxis (Ragnhammar, P., et a., (1994) Blood 54:4078-4087; Wadhwa,<br>
M., et al., (1999) Clin Cancer Res 5:1353-1361; Hjelm Skog, A.-L., et al.,<br>
(2001) Clin Cancer Res 7:1163-1170; Li, J., et al., (2001) Blood 98:3241-<br>
3248; Basser, R.L., et al., (2002) Blood 99:2599-2602; Schellekens, H., (2002)<br>
Clin Ther 24:1720-1740).<br>
[0005J	Modification of recombinant proteins by the covalent attachment of<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG") has been investigated extensively as a means of<br>
addressing the shortcomings discussed above (reviewed in Sherman, M.R.,<br>
et al., (1997) in: Poly(ethylene glycol): Chemistry and Biological<br>
Applications, Harris, J.M., et al., eds., pp. 155-169, American Chemical<br>
Society, Washington, D.C, Roberts, M.J., et al., (2002) Adv Drug Deliv Rev<br>
54:459-476). The attachment of PEG to proteins has been shown to stabilize<br>
the proteins, improve their bioavailability and/or reduce their immunogenicity<br>
in vivo. (The covalent attachment of PEG to a protein or other substrate is<br>
referred to herein, and is known in the art, as "PEGylation.") In addition,<br>
PEGylation can increase the hydrodynamic radius of proteins significantly.<br>
When a small protein such as a cytokine is coupled to a single long strand of<br>
PEG (e.g., having a molecular weight of at least about 18 kDa), the resultant<br>
conjugate has a hydrodynamic radius exceeding that of serum albumin and its<br>
clearance from the circulation via the renal glomeruli is retarded dramatically.<br>
The combined effects of PEGylation- reduced proteolysis, reduced immune<br>
recognition and reduced rates of renal clearance - confer substantial advan-<br>
tages on PEGylated proteins as therapeutic agents.<br>
[0006]	Since the 1970s, attempts have been made to use the covalent<br>
attachment of polymers to improve the safety and efficacy of various proteins<br>
for pharmaceutical use (see, e.g., Davis, F.F., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,179,337). Some examples include the coupling of PEG or polyethylene<br>
oxide) ("PEO") to adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) for use in the treatment<br>
of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (Davis, S., et al., (1981) Clin<br>
Exp Immunol 46:649-652; Hershfield, M.S., et al., (1987) N Engl J Med<br><br>
316:589-596), to superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) for the treatment of<br>
inflammatory conditions (Saifer, M., et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,006,333 and<br>
5,080,891) and to urate oxidase (EC 1.7.3.3) for the elimination of excess uric<br>
acid from the blood and urine (Kelly, S.J., et al., (2001) J Am Soc Nephrol<br>
72:1001-1009; Williams, L.D., et al., PCT Publication No. WO 00/07629 A3<br>
and U.S. Patent No. 6,576,235; Sherman, M.R., et al., PCT Publication No.<br>
WO 01/59078 A2).<br>
[0007]	PEOs and PEGs are polymers composed of covalently linked ethylene<br>
oxide units. These polymers have the following general structure:<br>
R1-(OCH2CH2)n-R2<br>
where R2 may be a hydroxyl group (or a reactive derivative thereof) and R1<br>
may be hydrogen, as in dihydroxyPEG ("PEG diol"), a methyl group, as in<br>
monomethoxyPEG ("mPEG"), or another lower alkyl group, e.g., as in iso-<br>
propoxyPEG or t-butoxyPEG. The parameter n in the general structure of<br>
PEG indicates the number of ethylene oxide units in the polymer and is<br>
referred to herein and in the art as the "degree of polymerization." Polymers<br>
of the same general structure, in which R1 is a C1-7 alkyl group, have also been<br>
referred to as oxirane derivatives (Yasukohchi, T., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,455,639). PEGs and PEOs can be linear, branched (Fuke, I., et al. (1994)<br>
J Control Release 30:27-34) or star-shaped (Merrill, E.W., (1993) J Biomater<br>
Sci Polym Ed 5:1-11). PEGs and PEOs are amphipathic, i.e., they are soluble<br>
in water and in certain organic solvents and they can adhere to lipid-containing<br>
materials, including enveloped viruses and the membranes of animal and<br>
bacterial cells. Certain random or block or alternating copolymers of ethylene<br>
oxide (OCH2CH2) and propylene oxide, which has the following structure:<br><br>
have properties that are sufficiently similar to those of PEG that these<br>
copolymers are thought to be suitable replacements for PEG in certain<br>
applications (see, e.g., Hiratani, H., U.S. Patent No. 4,609,546 and Saifer, M.,<br>
et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,283,317). The term "polyalkylene oxides" and the<br><br>
abbreviation "PAOs" are used herein to refer to such copolymers, as well as to<br>
PEG or PEO and poly(oxyethylene-oxymethylene) copolymers (Pitt, C.G.,<br>
et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,476,653). As used herein, the term "polyalkylene<br>
glycols" and the abbreviation "PAGs" are used to refer generically to<br>
polymers suitable for use in the conjugates of the invention, particularly PEGs,<br>
more particularly PEGs containing a single reactive group ("monofunctionally<br>
activated PEGs").<br>
[0008]	The covalent attachment of PEG or other polyalkylene oxides to a<br>
protein requires the conversion of at least one end group of the polymer into a<br>
reactive functional group. This process is frequently referred to as<br>
"activation" and the product is called "activated PEG" or activated<br>
polyalkylene oxide. MonomethoxyPEGs, in which an oxygen at one end is<br>
capped with an unreactive., chemically stable methyl group (to produce a<br>
"methoxyl group") and on the other end with a functional group that is<br>
reactive towards amino groups on a protein molecule, are used most<br>
commonly for such approaches. So-called "branched" mPEGs, which contain<br>
two or moTe methoxyl groups distal to a single activated functional group, are<br>
used less commonly. An example of branched PEG is di-mPEG-lysine, in<br>
which PEG is coupled to both amino groups, and the carboxyl group of lysine<br>
is most often activated by esterification with N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
(Martinez, A., et al., U.S. Patent No 5,643,575; Greenwald, R.B., et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,919,455; Harris, J.M., et a/., U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462).<br>
[0009]	Commonly, the activated polymers are reacted with a bioactive<br>
compound having nucleophilic functional groups that serve as attachment<br>
sites. One nucleophilic functional group that is used commonly as an<br>
attachment site is the epsilon amino group of lysine residues. Solvent-<br>
accessible alpha-amino .groups, carboxylic acid groups, guanidino groups,<br>
imidazole groups, suitably activated carbonyl groups, oxidized carbohydrate<br>
moieties and thiol groups have also been used as attachment sites.<br>
[0010]	The hydroxyl group of PEG has been activated with cyanuric chloride<br>
prior to its attachment to proteins (Abuchowski, A., et al., (1977) J Biol Chem<br><br>
252:3582-3586; Abuchowski, A., et al., (1981) Cancer Treat Rep 65:1077-<br>
1081). The use of this method has disadvantages, however, such as the<br>
toxicity of cyanuric chloride and its non-specific reactivity for proteins having<br>
functional groups other than amines, such as solvent-accessible cysteine or<br>
tyrosine residues that may be essential for function. In order to overcome<br>
these and other disadvantages, alternative activated PEGs have been<br>
introduced, such as succiriimidyl succinate derivatives of PEG ("SS-PEG")<br>
(Abuchowski, A., et al, (1984) Cancer Biochem Biophys 7:175-186),<br>
succiriimidyl carbonate derivatives of PAG ("SC-PAG") (Saifer, M., et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,006,333) and aldehyde derivatives of PEG (Royer, G.P.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,002,531).<br>
[0011]	Commonly, several (e.g., 5 to 10) strands of one or more PAGs, e.g.,<br>
one or more PEGs with a molecular weight of about 5 kDa to about 10 kDa,<br>
are coupled to the target protein via primary amino groups (the epsilon amino<br>
groups of lysine residues and, possibly, the alpha amino group of the amino-<br>
terminal ("N-terminal") amino acid). More recently, conjugates have been<br>
synthesized containing a single strand of mPEG of higher molecular weight,<br>
e.g., 12 kDa, 20 kDa or 30 kDa. Direct correlations have been demonstrated<br>
between the plasma half-lives of the conjugates and an increasing molecular<br>
weight and/or increasing number of strands of PEG coupled (Knauf, M.J.,<br>
et al., supra; Katre, N.V. (1990) J Immunol 144:209-213; Clark, R., et al.,<br>
(1996) J Biol Chan 277:21969-21977; Bowen, S., et al., (1999) Exp Hematol<br>
27:425-432; Leong, S.R., et al., (2001) Cytokine 76:106-119). On the other<br>
hand, as the number of strands of PEG coupled to each molecule of protein is<br>
increased, so is the probability that an amino group in an essential region of<br>
the protein will be modified and hence the biological function of the protein<br>
will be impaired, particularly if it is a receptor-binding protein. For larger<br>
proteins that contain many amino groups, and for enzymes with substrates of<br>
low molecular weight, the tradeoff between increased duration of action and<br>
decreased specific activity may be acceptable, since it produces a net increase<br>
in the biological activity of the PEG-containing conjugates in vivo. For<br><br>
smaller proteins that function via interactions with cell-surface receptors, such<br>
as cytokines, however, a relatively high degree of substitution has been<br>
reported to decrease the functional activity to the point of negating the<br>
advantage of an extended half-life in the bloodstream (Clark, R., et al., supra).<br>
[0012]	Thus, polymer conjugation is a well-established technology for<br>
prolonging the bioactivity and decreasing the immunoreactivity of therapeutic<br>
proteins such as enzymes (see, e.g., U.S. Provisional Appl. No. 60/436,020,<br>
filed December 26, 2002, and U.S. Provisional Appl. Nos. 60/479,913 and<br>
60/479,914, both filed on June 20, 2003, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). A class of therapeutic<br>
proteins that would benefit especially from such decreased immunoreactivity<br>
are the interferon-betas, particularly interferon-beta-1b ("IFN-β-1b;"<br>
SEQ ID NO.1) (The IFNB Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (1996) Neurology<br>
47:889-894). However, the conjugation of polymers to regulatory proteins<br>
that function by binding specifically to cell-surface receptors usually:<br>
(1) interferes with such binding; (2) markedly diminishes the signal<br>
transduction potencies of cytokine agonists; and (3) markedly diminishes the<br>
competitive potencies of cytokine antagonists. Published examples of such<br>
conjugates with diminished receptor-binding activity include polymer<br>
conjugates of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ("G-CSF") (Kinstler, O.,<br>
et al., PCT Publication No. WO 96/11953; Bowen, S., et al., supra); human<br>
growth hormone ("hGH") (Clark, R., et al, supra); hGH antagonists (Ross,<br>
R.J.M., et al., (2001) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 8(5:1716-1723; and WN-alpha<br>
(Bailon, P., et al., (2001) Bioconjug Chem 72:195-202; Wylie, D.C., et al.,<br>
(2001) Phann Res 75:1354-1360; and Wang, Y.-S., et al., (2002) Adv Drug<br>
Deliv Rev 54:547-570), among others. In an extreme case, the coupling of<br>
polymers to interleukin-15 ("IL-15") converted this IL-2-like growth factor<br>
into an inhibitor of cellular proliferation (Pettit, D.K., et al., (1997) J Biol<br>
Chem 272:2312-2318). While not intending to be bound by theory, the<br>
mechanism for such undesirable effects of PEGylation may involve steric<br><br>
hindrance of receptor interactions by the bulky PEG groups, charge<br>
neutralization, or both.<br>
[0013]	Thus, there exists a need for methods for producing PAG-containing<br>
(e.g., PEG- and/or PEO-containing) conjugates, particularly conjugates<br>
between such water-soluble polymers and receptor-binding proteins, with<br>
preservation of substantial bioactivity (e.g., at least about 40%), nearly<br>
complete bioactivity {e.g., at least about 80%) or essentially complete<br>
bioactivity (e.g., at least about 90%). Such conjugates will have the benefits<br>
provided by the polymer component of increased solubility, stability and<br>
bioavailability in vivo and will exhibit substantially increased potency or<br>
utility, compared to conventional polymer conjugates, in an animal into which<br>
the conjugates have been introduced for prophylactic, therapeutic, or diagnostic<br>
purposes.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014]	The present invention addresses the needs identified above, and<br>
provides methods for the preparation of conjugates of water-soluble polymers,<br>
e.g., poly(ethylene glycol), and derivatives thereof, with bioactive<br>
components, especially receptor-binding proteins, particularly therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic bioactive components such as cytokines including interferon-beta,<br>
and most particularly interferon-beta-1b. The invention also provides<br>
conjugates produced by such methods. Compared to the corresponding<br>
unconjugated bioactive components, the conjugates of the invention have<br>
increased stability {i.e., longer shelf life and longer half-lives in vivo). In<br>
addition, compared to conjugates of the same bioactive component prepared<br>
with polymer chains that are attached randomly to solvent-accessible sites<br>
along the polypeptide chains, the conjugates of the invention have increased<br>
receptor-binding activity, which can be measured or employed in vitro, and<br>
increased potency, which can be measured either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides compositions comprising such<br><br>
conjugates, kits containing such conjugates and compositions and methods of<br>
use of the conjugates and compositions in a variety of therapeutic and<br>
diagnostic regimens.<br>
[0015]	In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for enhancing the<br>
potency of a cytokine. Certain methods according to this aspect of the<br>
invention comprise, for example, selectively coupling one or more synthetic<br>
water-soluble polymers to the amino-terminal amino acid of the cytokine,<br>
wherein the amino-terminal amino acid is located remotely from one or more<br>
receptor-binding domains of the cytokine. Related methods provided by the<br>
invention for enhancing the potency of a cytokine comprise, for example,<br>
selectively coupling one or more synthetic water-soluble polymers at or near<br>
one or more glycosylation sites of the cytokine, wherein the one or more<br>
glycosylation sites is/are located remotely from one or more receptor-binding<br>
domains of the cytokine.<br>
[0016]	Suitable polymers for use in these methods of the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, one or more polyalkylene glycols (including, but not<br>
limited to, one or more poly(ethylene glycols), one or more monomethoxy-<br>
poly(ethylene glycols) and one or more monohydroxypoly(ethylene glycols)),<br>
one or more polyalkylene oxides, one or more polyoxiranes, one or more<br>
polyolefinic alcohols, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, one or more polycarboxylates,<br>
one or more poly(vinylpyrrolidones), one or more poly(oxyethylene-<br>
oxymethyleues), one or more poly(amino acids), one or more polyacryloyl-<br>
morpholines, one or more copolymers of one or more amides and one or more<br>
alkylene oxides, one or more dextrans and one or more hyaluronic acids.<br>
Polymers suitable for use in the methods of the invention typically have<br>
molecular weights of between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa, inclusive, or<br>
more particularly molecular weights of between about 8 kDa and about<br>
14 kDa, inclusive; between about 10 kDa and about 30 kDa, inclusive;<br>
between about 18 kDa and about 22 kDa, inclusive; or of about 20 kDa or<br>
about 30 kDa.<br><br>
[0017]	A variety of cytokines and analogs that mimic (i.e., agonize) or<br>

mediated by their specific cell-surface receptors are suitable for use in<br>
preparing the present conjugates. These include cytokines having a four helix<br>
bundle structure (including but not limited to granulocyte colony-stimulating<br>
factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte-<br>
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor<br>
(LEF), erythropoietin (Epo), thrombopoietin (Tpo), stem cell factor (SCF), Flt3<br>

(IFN-α), interferon beta (IFN-β) (particularly IFN-P-lb), consensus interferon<br>
and muteins, variants, analogs and derivatives thereof) and cytokines having a<br>
β-sheet or β-barrel structure (including but not limited to tumor necrosis factor<br>
alpha (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-1, IL-12 (p40 subunit), IL-16, epidermal growth<br>
factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth<br>
factor (bFGF), acidic FGF, FGF-4 and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF;<br>

[0018]	Particularly preferred cytokines suitable for use in accordance with the<br>
present invention include IL-2; IFN-α; IFN-β; IGF-1; EGF and bFGF. Also<br>
particularly suitable for use are competitive antagonists of the foregoing<br>
cytokines as well as muteins, variants and derivatives of these cytokines.<br>
[0019]	In certain embodiments, the one or more polymers is/are covalently<br>
coupled (particularly via a secondary amine linkage) to the alpha amino group<br>
of the amino-terminal amino acid on the cytokine. In other embodiments, the<br>
one or more polymers is/are covalently coupled to a chemically reactive side<br>
chain group (e.g., a hydroxyl group, a sulfhydryl group, a guanidino group, an<br>
imidazole group, an amino group, a carboxyl group or an aldehyde derivative)<br>
of the amino-terminal amino acid on the cytokine. In additional embodiments,<br>
the coupling of the polymer to the cytokine at the amino-terminal amino acid<br>
or at or near one or more glycosylation sites mimics the beneficial effects of<br>
glycosylation of the cytokine. In related embodiments, the coupling of the<br><br>
polymer to the cytokine at or near one or more glycosylation sites on the<br>
cytokine mimics the beneficial effects of hyperglycosylation of the cytokine,<br>
wherein "hyperglycosylation" indicates the covalent attachment of simple or<br>
complex carbohydrate moieties in addition to those present in the native<br>
structure.<br>
[0020]	The invention also provides conjugates produced by the methods of the<br>
invention. Conjugates of the invention comprise a selected cytokine or a<br>
selected antagonist thereof (such as those described above) coupled to one or<br>
more synthetic water-soluble polymers (such as those described above),<br>
wherein the one or more polymers is/are coupled to the amino-terminal amino<br>
acid of the cytokine and wherein the amino-terminal amino acid is located<br>
remotely from one or more receptor-binding domains of the selected cytokine.<br>
Additionally, conjugates of the invention comprise a selected cytokine or a<br>
selected antagonist thereof (such as those described above) coupled to one or<br>
more synthetic water-soluble polymers (such as those described above),<br>
wherein the one or more polymers is coupled to one or more glycosylation<br>
sites of the selected cytokine and wherein the one or more glycosylation sites<br>
is/are located remotely from one or more receptor-binding domains of the<br>
cytokine. For polymer conjugates of agonists of the invention, it is preferable<br>
that the site(s) of polymer attachment be remote from all of the receptor-<br>
binding domains. For polymer conjugates of certain antagonists of the<br>
invention, it may be preferable that the site(s) of polymer attachment be<br>
remote from certain receptor-binding domains that are essential for binding to<br>
occur, but not necessarily remote from all of the receptor-binding domains that<br>
are essential for signal transduction by agonists. The invention also provides<br>
compositions, particularly pharmaceutical compositions, comprising one or<br>
more of the conjugates of the invention and one or more additional<br>
components, such as one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable diluents,<br>
excipients or carriers. The invention also provides kits comprising one or<br>
more of the conjugates, compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the invention.<br><br>
[0021]	The invention also provides methods of preventing, diagnosing, or<br>
treating a physical disorder in an animal (e.g., a mammal such as a human)<br>
suffering from or predisposed to the physical disorder. Such methods may<br>
comprise, for example, administering to the animal an effective amount of one<br>
or more of the conjugates, compositions or pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
the present invention. Physical disorders suitably treated or prevented<br>
according to such methods of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>

cancer, a testicular cancer, a lung cancer, a leukemia, a lymphoma, a colon<br>
cancer, a gastrointestinal cancer, a pancreatic cancer, a bladder cancer, a<br>
kidney cancer, a bone cancer, a neurological cancer, a head and neck cancer, a<br>
skin cancer, a sarcoma, a carcinoma, an adenoma and a myeloma); infectious<br>
diseases (e.g., bacterial diseases, fungal diseases, parasitic diseases and viral<br>
diseases (such as a viral hepatitis, a disease caused by a cardiotropic virus,<br>
HIV/AIDS, and the like)); and genetic disorders (e.g., anemia, neutropenia,<br>
thrombocytopenia, hemophilia, dwarfism and severe combined<br>
immunodeficiency disease ("SCID"); autoimmune disorders (e.g., psoriasis,<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis) and neurodegenerative<br>
disorders (e.g., various forms and stages of multiple sclerosis ("MS") such as<br>
relapsing-remitting MS, primary progressive MS and secondary<br>
progressive MS; Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease; Alzheimer's Disease; and the<br>
like).<br>
[0022]	In related embodiments, the invention also provides methods for<br>
determining the amount of a polymer that is attached to the amino terminus of<br>
a protein having an N-terminal serine residue, in a polymer-protein conjugate<br>
synthesized by reductive alkylation. Methods according to this aspect of the<br>
invention comprise, for example, (a) reacting the conjugate with a sufficient<br>
quantity of an oxidizing agent for a sufficient time to cleave the polymer from<br>
the serine residue of the protein; and (b) measuring the increase in the portion<br>
of unconjugated protein in the preparation. Proteins suitable for use in<br>
accordance with such methods include, but are not limited to, cytokines<br><br>
(including interferon-beta (particularly interferon-beta-1b, which preferably<br>
has the amino acid sequence specified in SEQ ID NO:1) and megakaryocyte<br>
growth and development factor). The oxidizing agent used in certain such<br>
methods of the invention may be a periodate including, but not limited to,<br>
sodium metaperiodate, potassium metaperiodate, lithium metaperiodate,<br>
calcium periodate, barium periodate and periodic acid. Suitable methods for<br>
measuring the increase in the portion of unconjugated protein in the<br>
preparation include any variety of art-known methods of protein and peptide<br>
analysis, including, for example, size-exclusion chromatography, reversed<br>
phase chromatography, gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis,<br>
ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, light scattering and mass spectroscopy.<br>
[0023]	In additional related embodiments, the invention provides methods for<br>
the selective oxidative cleavage of an N-terminal serine residue of a bioactive<br>
protein without oxidizing functionally essential amino acid residues of said<br>
bioactive protein. Certain such methods of the invention comprise, for<br>
example, (a) adjusting the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution of the<br>
bioactive protein to a pH of between about 5 and about 10, more preferably a<br>
pH of between about 7 and about 8; (b) mixing the solution of bioactive<br>
protein with about 0.1 moles to about 10 moles, or more preferably with about<br>
0.5 moles to about 5 moles, of a periodate per mole of bioactive protein; and<br>
(c) incubating said mixture for at least one hour, preferably at a temperature of<br>
between about 2°C and about 40°C. Proteins suitable for use in accordance<br>
with such methods include, but are not limited to, cytokines (including<br>
interferon-beta (particularly interferon-beta-1b, winch preferably has the<br>
amino acid sequence specified in SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
[0024]	In additional embodiments, the invention provides methods for<br>
increasing the biological potency of a preparation of mterferon-beta,<br>
particularly a preparation of interferon-beta-1b, comprising removal of one or<br>
more inhibitory components of an interferon-beta (or interferon-beta-1b)<br>
preparation. According to this aspect of the invention, the one or more<br>
inhibitory components can be removed from the preparations by a variety of<br><br>
art-known methods of protein and peptide processing, purification and/or<br>
analysis, including but not limited to one or more chromatographic methods<br>
such as size-exclusion chromatography, reversed phase chromatography,<br>
hydrophobic interaction chromatography and affinity chromatography. The<br>
determination of the biological potency of a given preparation of interferon-<br>
beta {i.e., whether the potency is increased, decreased or unaffected, relative to<br>
a stock solution of interferon- beta) can be accomplished by any number of in<br>
vitro or in vivo assays that will be familiar to the ordinarily skilled artisan. For<br>
example, a cell culture assay that responds to interferon-beta can be used to<br>
determine the biological potency of interferon-beta preparations. Non-<br>
limiting examples of suitable such cell culture assays include antiproliferative<br>
assays, antiviral assays, signal transduction assays and gene activation assays,<br>
examples of which are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0025]	Other preferred embodiments of the present invention will be apparent<br>
to one of ordinary skill in light of the following drawings and description of<br>
the invention, and of the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0026]	Figures 1 through 8 display molecular models of various cytokines and<br>
growth factors created with RasMol software (Sayle, R.A., et al., (1995)<br>
Trends Biochem Sci 20:374-376) based on crystallographic data. Each of the<br>
models is represented in "ribbon" or "cartoon" format, except for certain<br>
residues of particular interest, which are shown in "ball-and-stick" format.<br>
These formats are options selected using RasMol software. The dark parts of<br>
the ribbons represent domains of the cytokines and growth factors that are<br>
reported to be involved in binding to their receptors. For each structure, the<br>
accession code in the Protein Data Bank ("PDB") is indicated (see Laskowski,<br>
R.A., (2001) Nucleic Acids Res 29:221-222; Peitsch, M.C., (2002)<br>
Bioinformatics 18:934-938; Schein, C.H., (2002) Curr Pham Des 5:2113-<br>
2129).<br><br>
[0027]	Figure 1a shows a model of interferon-alpha-2a, in which the four<br>
lysine residues (Lys 31, Lys L21, Lys 131 and Lys 134) that are reported to be<br>
the primary sites of PEGylation in Roche's PEG-interferon product,<br>
PEGASYS®, are shown in "ball-and-stick" format (based on data of Bailon, P.,<br>
et al., supra). The regions involved in binding to its receptors ("Rinding<br>
Sites 1 and 2") are identified. All four of the lysine residues that are reported<br>
to be PEGylated in Pegasys are in the region of Binding Site 1. (PDB code<br>
1ITF)<br>
[0028]	Figure lb shows a model of interferon-alpha-2b, in which the residues<br>
that are reported to be the major sites of PEGylation in Schering-Plough's<br>
PEG-INTRON® (His 34, Lys 31, Lys 121, Tyr 129 and Lys 131) are shown in<br>
"ball-and-stick" format (based on data of Wylie, D.C., et al., supra). These<br>
amino acid residues are in the region of Binding Site 1.<br>
[0029]	Figure 1c shows a model of interferon-alpha-2b, in which the amino-<br>
terminal cysteine residue ("Cys 1"), a target of PEGylation according to the<br>
present invention, is shown in "ball-and-stick" format. Cys 1 is remote from<br>
Binding Sites 1 and 2.<br>
[0030]	Figure 1d shows the same model of interferon-alpha-2b as that shown<br>
in Figure 1c, to which a single strand of 20-kDa PEG has been attached at the<br>
N-terminal cysteine residue ("Cys I"). The structure of PEG was generated<br>
using an adaptation of the program described by Lee, L.S., et al., (1999)<br>
Bioconjug Chem 70:973-981) and is rendered to the same scale as is the<br>
protein.<br>
[0031]	Figure 2 shows a molecular model of human interferon-beta-1a (see<br>
SEQ ID NO:2), in which several lysine residues that are within or adjacent to<br>
the receptor-binding domains are indicated (Lys 19, Lys 33, Lys 99 and<br>
Lys 134). In addition, the glycosylation site (Asn 80) and the N-terminal<br>
methionine residue ("Met 1") are shown in "ball-and-stick" format (based on<br>
data of Karpusas, M., et al., (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:11813-<br>
11818; Karpusas, M., et al., (1998) Cell Mol Life Sci 54:1203-1216; Runkel,<br>
L., et al., (2000) Biochemistry 39:2538-2551). Met 1 is remote from Binding<br><br>
Sites 1 and 2, whereas several lysine residues are located within the receptor-<br>
binding domains. (PDB code 1AUI) The structure of interferon-beta-1b (see<br>
SEQ ID NO:1) differs from that of interferon-beta-1a in lacking the<br>
N-terminal methionine residue and carbohydrate moiety, as well as having a<br>
serine residue substituted for the unpaired cysteine residue (Cys 17 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:2).<br>
[0032]	Figure 3 shows a molecular model of human granulocyte-macrophage<br>
colony-stimulating factor ("GM-CSF") in which three lysine residues (Lys 72,<br>
Lys 107 and Lys 111) that are within the receptor-binding domains, as; well as<br>
the first amino acid residue near the amino terminus that is visualized in the<br>
crystal structure ("Arg4"), are shown in "ball-and-stick" format (based on<br>
data of Rozwarski, D.A., et al., (1996) Proteins 26:304-313). The amino-<br>
terminal region of GM-CSF is remote from Binding Sites 1 and 2. (PDB code<br>
2GMF)<br>
[0033]	Figure 4 shows a molecular model of human interleukin-2, in which<br>
the amino acid residues that are reported to be involved with each of three<br>
receptors {alpha, beta and gamma) are represented in "ball-and-stick" format,<br>
as are several lysine residues that are within or close to the receptor-binding<br>
domains. The closest amino acid residue to the amino terminus that is<br>
visualized in the crystal structure is serine 6 ("Ser 6"), which is remote from<br>
the receptor-binding domains (based on data of Bamborough, P., et al., (1994)<br>
Structure 2:839-851; Pettit, D.K., et al, supra). (PDB code 3INK)<br>
[0034]	Figure 5 shows a molecular model of human epidermal growth factor<br>
("EGF") in "cartoon" formal, except for the residues that are implicated in<br>
receptor binding and the two lysine residues (Lys 28 and Lys 48) that are<br>
adjacent to receptor-binding regions. The intra-chain disulfide bonds are<br>
shown as dashed lines. The closest amino acid residue to the amino terminus<br>
that is visualized in the crystal structure on which this model is based is<br>
cysteine 6 ("Cys 6") (based on data of Carpenter, G., et al., (1990) J Biol<br>
Chem 255:7709-7712; Lu, H.-S., et al., (2001) J Biol Chem 27(5:34913-<br>
34917). The flexible portion of the amino terminus of EGF (residues 1-5) that<br><br>
is not visualized in the crystal structure does not appear to be in a. receptor-<br>
binding region. (PDB code 1JL9)<br>
[0035]	Figure 6 shows a molecular model of basic fibroblast growth factor<br>
("bFGF") in "cartoon" format in which the residues involved in binding to the<br>
receptors and to heparin are identified by presentation in "ball-and-stick"<br>
format (based on data of Schlessinger, J., et al., (2000) Mol Cell 6:743-750).<br>
The first 12 amino acid residues from the amino terminus have not been<br>
implicated in receptor binding. (PDB code 1FQ9)<br>
[0036]	Figure 7 shows a molecular model of insulin-like growth factor-1<br>
("IGF-1") in "cartoon" format, except for the residues involved in receptor<br>
binding (23-25 and 28-37), and glutamic acid residue 3 ("Glu 3"), which is the<br>
closest amino acid residue to the amino terminus that is visualized in the<br>
crystal structure. Two of the lysine residues are identified, one of which<br>
(Lys 27) is adjacent to the receptor-binding domain, and the other of which is<br>
remote from the receptor-binding domain (based on data of Brzozowski, A.M.,<br>
et al., (2002) Biochemistry 47:9389-9397). The amino terminus of IGF-1 is<br>
remote from the receptor-binding domains. (PDB code lGZR)<br>
[0037]	Figure 8 shows a molecular model of an interferon-gamma ("IFN-<br>
gamma"), which is a homodimer. To clarify the interactions between the two<br>
polypeptide chains, one of the monomers ("Chain A") is shown in "ribbon"<br>
format and the other ("Chain B") is shown in "backbone" format. Lysine<br>
residues (shown in light "ball and stick" format) occur along the polypeptide<br>
chain, including the regions that are involved in the interface between the<br>
monomers or are adjacent to amino acid residues that are involved in receptor<br>
binding. The amino-terminal region of IFN-gamma is remote from the<br>
dimerization interface, but glutamine 1 (Gin 1) has been implicated in receptor<br>
binding. (Thiel, D.J., et al, (2000) Structure 5:927-936; PDB code 1FG9)<br>
[0038]	Figure 9 shows the fractionation of unPEGylated interferon-alpha-2b<br>
("IFN"), monoPEGylated interferon-alpha-2b ("PEG1-IFN") and diPEGylated<br>
interferon alpha-Do ("PEG2-IFN") by cation-exchange chromatography of a<br><br>
reaction mixture containing IFN, 20-kDa mPEG-aldehyde and a reducing<br>
agent.<br>
[0039]	Figure 10 shows size-exclusion chromatographic analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture fractionated as shown in Figure 9 and of selected fractions<br>
collected from the ion-exchange column for which results are shown in<br>
Figure 9.<br>
[0040]	Figure 11 shows the fractionation by cation-exchange chromatography<br>
of a reaction mixture containing human IL-2, 20-kDa mPEG-aldehyde and a<br>
reducing agent. Under the indicated elution conditions, the residual<br>
unPEGylated IL-2 was not eluted from the column, unlike the results for<br>
interferon-alpha-2b shown in Figure 9.<br>
[0041]	Figure 12 shows a size-exclusion chromatographic analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture fractionated as shown in Figure 11 and of selected fractions<br>
eluted from that column.<br>
[0042]	Figure 13 shows electrophoretic analyses of a reaction mixture of<br>
PEGylated interleukin-2 ("PEG-IL^") and of a fraction from the cation-<br>
exchange column for which the chromatogram is shown in Figure 11.<br>
[0043]	Figure 14 depicts the resolution by size-exclusion HPLC of<br>
interferon--1b ("IFN") from its conjugates formed by reductive alkylation<br>
with 20 kDa mPEG aldehyde at various input concentrations ("1x," "2x" or<br>
"4x"), with sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) as the reducing agent.<br>
Conjugates containing one strand of PEG ("PEG1-IFN") or two strands<br>
("PEG2-IFN") are resolved from IFN to which PEG was not coupled under<br>
these conditions ("Mock PEGylated IFN").<br>
[0044]	Figure 15 demonstrates the oxidative cleavage by sodium periodate of<br>
about 90% of PEG1-IFN- synthesized by reductive alkylation under various<br>
conditions. Size-exclusion HPLC in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate<br>
("SDS") resolved the residual PEG 1-IFN-β from the cleavage products,<br>
including formaldehyde and IFN in which the N-terminal serine was cleaved<br>
to an aldehyde ("IFN Aldehyde").<br><br>
[0050]	Figure 21 demonstrates the synthesis of PEG1-IFN-β by the reaction<br>
of 20-kDa PEG-carbazate with the aldehyde derivative of [FN-β. The<br>
increasing proportion of the conjugate detected after incubation of the protein<br>
with 0.125 mM NaIIO4 at room temperature for 0.5, 1 or 2 hours indicates that<br>
complete conversion of the N-terminal serine to an aldehyde requires more<br>
than 1 hour under these conditions. PEG1-IFN-β was incompletely resolved<br>
from 20-kDa PEG-carbazate on this size-exclusion column.<br>
[0051]	Figure 22 demonstrates the greater antiproliferative potency on human<br>
Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Daudi cells) of dilutions of PEG1-IFN-β, which was<br>
purified by reversed phase chromatography (Fraction 51, characterized in<br>
Figures 17-19), than that of dilutions of the stock solution of IFN-β. The<br>
concentration of purified PEGi-IFN-P required to inhibit 50% of the<br>
inhabitable growth of these cells was about 40 pg/mL, which was about one<br>
sixth of that required for the stock solution of IFN-β. The concentration of<br>
purified Mock PEGylated IFN-β (Fraction 53 from the reversed phase<br>
chromatogram shown in Figure 17) required to inhibit 50% of the inhabitable<br>
growth of these cells was about 80pg/mL, which is about one third of that<br>
required for the stock solution of IFN-β.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0052]	Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br>
have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials<br>
similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or<br>
testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0053]	About: As used herein when referring to any numerical value, the<br>
term "about" means a value of ±10% of the stared value (e.g., "about 5O°C"<br><br>
[0045]	Figure 16 depicts the resolution by reversed phase chromatography of<br>
PEG1-EFN-β from Mock PEGylated IFN-β, unbound PEG, unbound SDS and<br>
minor components of the reaction mixture.<br>
[0046]	Figure 17 depicts results of analytical reversed phase ("RP")<br>
chromatography of a PEGylation reaction mixture and fractions from a<br>
preparative RP column that were enriched in PEG1-IFN-β (Fraction 51) or in<br>
Mock PEGylated IFN-β (Fraction 53), respectively.<br>
[0047]	Figure 18 depicts results of electrophoretic analyses of a PEGylation<br>
reaction mixture and fractions from a preparative RP column that are enriched<br>
either in PEG1-IFN-β (Fraction 51) or in conjugates containing more than one<br>
strand of PEG (Fraction 49). The gel was stained for protein with a<br>
fluorescent dye and photographed with ultraviolet illumination. The intensity<br>
of the stain was measured with Kodak ID imaging software.<br>
[0048]	Figure 19 depicts results of electrophoretic analyses of the same<br>
samples as in Figure 18, except that the gel was stained for PEG with a reagent<br>
containing BaCl2, I2 and KI. The intensity of the stain in a photograph of the<br>
gel was measured as in Figure 18. A peak of residual free 20-kDa. PEG is<br>
detectable in the reaction mixture.<br>
[0049]	Figure 20 depicts reversed phase chromatograms of samples of<br>
IFN-β-lb that were either untreated (top curve) or incubated with 0.5 mM<br>
NaIO4, which cleaved the N-terminal serine residues of both the major and<br>
minor components to aldehyde derivatives (middle curve), or oxidized with<br>
NaIO4 and reacted with 9-fluorenylmethyl carbazate ("Fmoc-carbazate"). The<br>
minor component ("Peak A") contains an oxidized methionine residue. The<br>
similar increases in the retention times of both Peak A and the major<br>
component after oxidation reflect the cleavage of the N-terminal serine<br>
residues in each peak to an aldehyde. No increase in the percentage of Peak A<br>
was detected after incubation with NaIO4 under these conditions. The<br>
formation of Fmoc conjugates from the oxidized forms of Peak A and the<br>
main component is indicated by the increases in their retention times and<br>
absorbances after reaction with Fmoc-carbazate.<br><br>
encompasses a range of temperatures from 45°C to 55°C, inclusive:; similarly,<br>
"about 100 mM" encompasses a range of concentrations from 90 mM to<br>
110 mM, inclusive).<br>
[0054]	Amino Acid Residue: As used herein, the term "amino acid residue"<br>
refers to a specific amino acid, usually dehydrated as a result of its<br>
involvement in two peptide bonds, in a polypeptide backbone or side chain,<br>
but also when the amino acid is involved in one peptide bond, as occurs at<br>
each end of a linear polypeptide chain. The amino acid residues are referred<br>
to by the three-letter codes or single-letter codes that are common in the art.<br>
[0055]	Antagonist: As used herein, the term "antagonist" refers to a<br>
compound, molecule, moiety or complex that reduces, substantially reduces or<br>
completely inhibits the biological and/or physiological effects of a given<br>
cytokine on a cell, tissue or organism that are mediated through the receptors<br>
for the given cytokine. Antagonists may carry out such effects in a variety of<br>
ways, including but not limited to competing with the agonist for binding<br>
site(s) or receptor(s) on the cell surface; interacting with the agonist in such a<br>
way as to reduce, substantially reduce or completely inhibit the ability of the<br>
agonist to bind to cell surface receptors; binding to and inducing a<br>
conformational change in cell surface receptors such that the receptors assume<br>
a structure to which the agonist can no longer bind (or can bind only with<br>
reduced or substantially reduced affinity and/or efficiency); inducing a<br>
physiological change (e.g., increase in intracellular signaling complexes;<br>
increase in transcriptional inhibitors; reduction in cell surface ligand receptor<br>
expression; etc.) in cells, tissues or organisms such that the binding of the<br>
agonist, or the physiological signal induced by the agonist upon binding to the<br>
cell, is reduced, substantially reduced or completely inhibited; and other<br>
mechanisms by which antagonists may carry out their activities, that will be<br>
familiar to the ordinarily skilled artisan. As the ordinarily skilled artisan will<br>
understand, an antagonist may have a similar structure to the ligand that it<br>
antagonizes (e.g., the antagonist may be a mutein, variant, fragment or<br>
derivative of the agonist), or may have a wholly unrelated structure.<br><br>
[0056]	Bioactive Component: As used herein, the term "bioactive<br>
component" refers to a compound, molecule, moiety or complex that has a<br>
particular biological activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo upon a cell, tissue,<br>
organ or organism, and that is capable of being bound to one or more<br>
polyalkylene glycols to form the conjugates of the invention. Preferred<br>
bioactive components include, but are not limited to, proteins and polypeptides<br>
such as those that are described herein.<br>
[0057]	Bound: As used herein, the term "bound" refers to binding or<br>
attachment that may be covalent, e.g., by chemically coupling, or non-<br>
covalent, e.g., ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds,<br>
etc. Covalent bonds can be, for example, ester, ether, phosphoester, thioester,<br>
thioether, urethane, amide, amine, peptide, imide, hydrazone, hydrazide,<br>
carbon-sulfur bonds, carbon-phosphorus bonds, and the like. The term<br>
"bound" is broader than and includes terms such as "coupled," "conjugated"<br>
and "attached."<br>
[0058]	Conjugate/conjugation: As used herein, "conjugate" refers to the<br>
product of covalent attachment of a polymer, e.g., PEG or PEO., to a bioactive<br>
component, e.g., a protein or glycoprotein. "Conjugation" refers to the<br>
formation of a conjugate as defined in the previous sentence. Any method<br>
normally used by those skilled in the art of conjugation of polymers to<br>
biologically active materials can be used in the present invention.<br>
[0059]	Coupled: The term "coupled", as used herein, refers to attachment by<br>
covalent bonds or by strong non-covalent interactions, typically and preferably<br>
to attachment by covalent bonds. Any method normally used by those skilled<br>
in the art for the coupling of biologically active materials can be used in the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0060]	Cytokine: As used herein, the term "cytokine" is defined as a secreted<br>
regulatory protein that controls the survival, growth, differentiation, and/or<br>
effector function of cells, in endocrine, paracrine or autocrine fashion<br>
(reviewed in Nicola, N.A., supra; Kossiakoff, A.A., et al., (1999) Adv Protein<br>
Chem 52:67-108). According to this definition, cytokines include<br><br>
interleukins, colony-stimulating factors, growth factors, and other peptide<br>
factors produced by a variety of cells, including but not limited to those<br>
specifically disclosed or exemplified herein. Like their close relatives, the<br>
polypeptide hormones and growth factors, cytokines initiate their regulatory<br>
functions by binding to specific receptor proteins on the surface of their target<br>
cells.<br>
[0061]	Disease, disorder, condition: As used herein, the terms "disease" or<br>
"disorder" refer to any adverse condition of a human or animal including<br>
tumors, cancer, allergies, addiction, autoimmunity, infection, poisoning or<br>
impairment of optimal mental or bodily function. "Conditions" as used herein<br>
includes diseases and disorders but also refers to physiologic states. For<br>
example, fertility is a physiologic state but not a disease or disorder.<br>
Compositions of the invention suitable for preventing pregnancy by<br>
decreasing fertility would therefore be described as a treatment of a condition<br>
(fertility), but not a treatment of a disorder or disease. Other conditions are<br>
understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0062]	Effective Amount: As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers<br>
to an amount of a given conjugate or composition that is necessary or<br>
sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. An effective amount of a given<br>
conjugate or composition of the present invention would be the amount that<br>
achieves this selected result, and such an amount can be determined as a<br>
matter of routine by a person skilled in the art, using assays that are known in<br>
the art and/or that are described herein, without the need for undue<br>
experimentation. For example, an effective amount for treating an inunune<br>
system deficiency could be that amount necessary to cause activation of the<br>
immune system, resulting in the development of an antigen-specific immune<br>
response upon exposure to an antigen. The term is also synonymous with<br>
"sufficient amount." The effective amount for any particular application can<br>
vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the<br>
particular composition being administered, the route of administration, the size<br>
of the subject, and/or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary<br><br>
skill in the art can determine empirically the effective amount of a particular<br>
conjugate or composition of the present invention without necessitating undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
[0063]	One, a, or an: When the terms "one," "a," or "an" are used in this<br>
disclosure, they mean "at least one" or "one or more," unless otherwise<br>
indicated.<br>
[0064]	PEG: As used herein, "PEG" includes all polymers of ethylene oxide,<br>
whether linear or branched or multi-armed and whether end-capped or<br>
hydroxyl terminated. "PEG" includes those polymers that are known in the art<br>
as poly(ethylene glycol), methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) or mPEG or<br>
poly(ethylene glycol)-monomethyl ether, a!koxypoly(ethylene glycol),<br>
poly(ethylene oxide) or PEO, a-methyl-co-hydroxy-poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl)<br>
and polyoxirane, among other names that are used in the art for polymers of<br>
ethylene oxide.<br>
[0065]	PEGylation, PEGylated and Mock PEGylated: As used herein,<br>
"PEGylation" refers to any process for the covalent coupling of PEG to a<br>
bioactive target molecule, especially a receptor-binding protein. The<br>
conjugate produced thereby is referred to as being "PEGylated." As used<br>
herein, "Mock PEGylated" refers to the portion of the protein in a PEGylation<br>
reaction mixture to which no PEG has been covalently attached. Nevertheless,<br>
the Mock PEGylated product may have been altered during the reaction or<br>
subsequent purification steps, e.g., as a consequence of exposure to the<br>
reducing agent during PEGylation by reductive alkylation and/or by having<br>
one or more inhibitory agents, compounds, etc., removed during the<br>
processing and/or purification steps.<br>
[0066]	Polypeptide: As used herein, the term "polypeptide" refers to a<br>
molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linearly linked by amide<br>
bonds (also known as peptide bonds). It indicates a molecular chain of amino<br>
acids and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides,<br>
dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides and proteins are included within the<br>
definition of polypeptide. This term is also intended to refer to the products of<br><br>
post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, for example, glycosylation,<br>
hyperglycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and the like. A polypeptide<br>
may be derived from a natural biological source or produced by recombinant<br>
DNA technology, but is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic<br>
acid sequence. It may be generated in any manner, including by chemical<br>
synthesis.<br>
[0067]	Protein and glycoprotein: As used herein, the term protein refers to a<br>
polypeptide generally of a size of above about 10 or more, 20 or more, 25 or<br>
more, 50 or more, 75 or more, 100 or more, 200 or more, 500 or more, 1,000<br>
or more, or 2,000 or more amino acids. Proteins generally have a defined<br>
three-dimensional structure, although they do not necessarily have such<br>
structure, and are often referred to as folded, as opposed to peptides and<br>
polypeptides, which often do not possess a defined three-dimensional<br>
structure, but rather can adopt a large number of different conformations, and<br>
are referred to as unfolded. Peptides may, however, also have a defined three-<br>
dimensional structure. As used herein, the term glycoprotein refers to a<br>
protein coupled to at least one carbohydrate moiety that is attached to the<br>
protein via an oxygen-containing or a nitrogen-containing side chain of an<br>
amino acid residue, e.g., a serine residue or an asparagine residue.<br>
[0068]	Remote: As used herein, the term "remote" (as in "remote N-terminal<br>
amino acid" or "remote glycosylation site") refers to a structure in which the<br>
location of one or more attachment sites for one or more polymers on a protein<br>
is/are distal to or spatially removed from one or more receptor binding regions<br>
or domains of the protein, as assessed by molecular modeling. Conjugation of<br>
a polymer at such a remote attachment site (usually the N-terminal amino acid<br>
(for receptor-binding proteins that are therefore referred to as "remote<br>
N-terminal" or "RN" receptor-binding proteins) or one or more carbohydrate<br>
moieties or glycosylation sites on a glycoprotein (for receptor-binding proteins<br>
that are therefore referred to as "remote glycosylation" or "RG" receptor-<br>
binding proteins)) does not cause substantial steric hindrance of the binding of<br>
the protein to its receptor(s). Hence, an amino-terminal amino acid or a<br><br>
glycosylation site on a cytokine is said to be "located remotely from one or<br>
more receptor-binding domains" of the cytokine when conjugation (e.g.,<br>
covalent attachment) of a water-soluble polymer to the amino-terminal amino<br>
acid or glycosylation site, respectively, does not interfere substantially with<br>
the ability of the cytokine to bind to its receptor(s), particularly to cell -surface<br>
receptors. It is recognized, of course, that a given cytokine may contain more<br>
than one receptor-binding domain. In such situations, an amino-terminal<br>
amino acid or glycosylation site of a cytokine can be located remotely from<br>
one such domain or from more than one of such domains, and still be<br>
considered to be "located remotely from one or more receptor-binding<br>
domains," so long as conjugation of the amino-terminal amino acid or<br>
glycosylation site does not interfere substantially with the binding of the<br>
cytokine to its receptor(s) via one or more of the receptor-binding domains.<br>
Whether or not the conjugation interferes substantially with the ability of a<br>
protein to bind to its receptor(s) can be readily determined using art-known<br>
assays of ligand-receptor binding that will be familiar to the ordinarily skilled<br>
artisan.<br>
[0069]	As shown in Figure Id of this specification, PEG is a highly extended<br>
and flexible polymer that occupies a large volume in solution relative to a<br>
protein of similar molecular weight. Although the amino acid residue to<br>
which PEG is attached may be remote from one or more receptor-binding<br>
sites, portions of the polymer could, nevertheless, interfere, to some extent,<br>
with receptor binding. The probability of such interference increases with the<br>
molecular weight and hence the volume occupied by the polymer in solution.<br>
In any case, targeted attachment of PEG to one or more site(s) remote from the<br>
receptor-binding region(s) will interfere less with the function of the cytokine<br>
than random PEGylation.<br>
[0070]	Methods of assessing ligand-receptor binding include, without<br>
limitation, competitive binding assays, radioreceptor binding assays, cell-<br>
based assays, surface plasmon resonance measurements, dynamic light<br>
scattering, ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration.<br><br>
[0071]	Substantial, substantially: As used herein, conjugation of a protein is<br>
said not to interfere "substantially" with the ability of the protein to bind to its<br>
receptor(s) if the rate and/or amount of binding of a conjugated protein to a<br>
receptor is not less than about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 65%, about<br>
70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%,<br>
about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about<br>
99% or about 100% or more, of the binding rate and/or amount of the<br>
corresponding cytokine that has not been conjugated.<br>
[0072]	Treatment: As used herein, the terms "treatment," "treat," "treated"<br>
or "treating" refer to prophylaxis and/or therapy. When used with respect to<br>
an infectious disease, for example, the term may refer to a prophylactic<br>
treatment that increases the resistance of a subject to infection with a pathogen<br>
or, in other words, decreases the likelihood that the subject will become<br>
infected with the pathogen or will show signs of illness attributable to the<br>
infection, as well as a treatment after the subject has become infected in order<br>
to fight the infection, e.g., to reduce or eliminate the infection or to prevent it<br>
from becoming worse.<br>
Overview<br>
[0073]	The present invention provides methods for the synthesis of polymer<br>
conjugates of receptor-binding proteins that retain unexpectedly high receptor-<br>
binding activity relative to polymer conjugates of the same receptor-binding<br>
protein in which one or more polymers are attached randomly. Through the<br>
use of x-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance-based structural<br>
analyses, mutational analysis and molecular modeling software, the present<br>
inventors have identified target sites for PEGylation of cytokines that are<br>
involved or are not involved in binding to their receptors. As a class of<br>
proteins, these cytokines are referred to herein as receptor-binding proteins.<br>
By selection of a synthetic strategy that targets polymer attachment to the<br>
region(s) of receptor-binding proteins that are not involved in receptor<br>
interactions, certain undesirable steric hindrances are avoided and the resultant<br><br>
polymer conjugates retain unusually high potency. Those receptor-binding<br>
proteins that have an amino-terminal residue that is remote from one or more<br>
of their receptor-binding regions or domains are defined herein as "remote<br>
N-terminal" or "RN" receptor-binding proteins; they include all cytokines or<br>
antagonists thereof that have their amino-terminal amino acid located remotely<br>
from the receptor-binding site or sites of the protein.<br>
[0074]	In additional embodiments of the invention, conjugates are produced<br>
comprising one or more synthetic polymers (e.g., one or more poly(ethylene<br>
glycols)) covalently coupled to cytokines that have natural glycosylation sites<br>
that are remote from one or more of their receptor-binding regions or domains.<br>
According to this aspect of the invention, the bioactive components {e.g.,<br>
cytokines) of the conjugates will display well-preserved receptor-binding<br>
activities when synthetic polymers are coupled in the region of the<br>
glycosylation site(s). This subset of receptor-binding proteins is referred to<br>
herein as "RG" receptor-binding proteins. When a hydrophilic or amphipathic<br>
polymer is coupled selectively at or near such a "remote glycosylation" site,<br>
especially when the target protein is a non-glycosylated form of a protein that<br>
is naturally glycosylated, the polymer can mimic the favorable, effects of the<br>
naturally occurring carbohydrate, e.g., on aggregation, stability and/or<br>
solubility. Hence attachment of the polymer at or near a glycosylation site is<br>
referred to herein as "pseudoglycosylation." Thus, the present invention<br>
provides methods for the synthesis of conjugates in which the site-selective<br>
coupling of a synthetic polymer effectively replaces the naturally occurring<br>
carbohydrate moieties. The resultant pseudoglycosylation contributes to<br>
improved solubility, decreased aggregation and retarded clearance from the<br>
bloodstream, compared to other nonglycosylated forms of the protein. This<br>
approach therefore is particularly advantageous for preparing conjugates and<br>
compositions of proteins that are produced by recombinant DNA technology<br>
in prokaryotic host cells (e.g., bacteria such as Escherichia coli), since<br>
prokaryotic organisms generally do not glycosylate proteins that they express.<br><br>
[0075]	Analogously, selective PEGylation of the carbohydrate moiety of a<br>
glycoprotein can result in "pseudohyperglycosylatiori" of the glycoprotein.<br>
This process was described, for example, by C. Bona et al., in PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 96/40731, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety. This approach therefore is particularly<br>
advantageous for preparing conjugates and compositions of proteins that are<br>
produced by recombinant DNA technology in eukaryotic host cells (e.g., in<br>
yeasts, plant cells and animal cells (including mammalian and insect cells),<br>
since eukaryotic organisms generally do glycosylate proteins that they express,<br>
if those proteins include naturally occurring glycosylation signals or<br>
glycosylation signals introduced by recombinant DNA technology. Such<br>
pseudoglycosylated and pseudohyperglycosylated RG receptor-binding<br>
proteins are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0076]	The invention thus also encompasses polymer conjugates of "RN"<br>
receptor-binding proteins that retain substantial, nearly complete or essentially<br>
complete receptor-binding activity and pseudoglycosylated or pseudo-<br>
hyperglycosylated "RG" receptor-binding proteins that retain substantial,<br>
nearly complete or essentially complete receptor-binding activity. As used<br>
herein, a cytokine is said to "retain substantial, nearly complete or essentially<br>
complete receptor-binding activity" when conjugated with one or more water-<br>
soluble polymers according to the present invention, if the conjugation of the<br>
cytokine does not interfere substantially with the ability of the protein to bind<br>
to its receptor(s), i.e., if the rate and/or amount of binding of the conjugated<br>
protein to its corresponding receptor(s) is not less than about 40%, about 50%,<br>
about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about<br>
90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%,<br>
about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100% or more, of the binding rate<br>
and/or amount of an unconjugated form of the corresponding protein. Also<br>
included within the scope of the present invention are polymer conjugates of<br>
those receptor-binding proteins that are classified as both "RN" and "RG"<br><br>
receptor-binding proteins. Two examples of the latter proteins are interferon<br>
beta (particularly interferon-beta-1b) and IL-2.<br>
[0077]	In additional embodiments, the invention provides methods for the<br>
synthesis of polymer conjugates of receptor-binding proteins that retain<br>
unexpectedly high receptor-binding activity relative to polymer conjugates of<br>
the same receptor-binding protein in which one or more polymers are attached<br>
randomly. The invention also provides conjugates produced by such methods,<br>
and compositions comprising one or more of these conjugates of the invention<br>
that may further comprise one or more additional components or reagents,<br>
such as one or more buffer salts, one or more carbohydrate excipients, one or<br>
more carrier proteins, one or more enzymes, one or more detergents, one or<br>
more nucleic acid molecules, one or more polymers such as unconjugated<br>
PEG or polyalkylene glycol, and the like. The invention also provides kits<br>
comprising the conjugates and/or compositions of the invention.<br>
[0078]	The invention also provides pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions<br>
comprising the conjugates of the invention and at least one cxcipient or carrier<br>
that is acceptable for pharmaceutical or veterinary use. The invention also<br>
provides methods of treating or preventing a variety of physical disorders<br>
using such compositions, comprising administering an effective amount of one<br>
or more of the conjugates or compositions of the present invention to an<br>
animal suffering from or predisposed to a physical disorder or condition.<br>
[0079]	Further, the invention provides stabilized receptor-binding proteins and<br>
methods for their production for use in industrial cell culture, whereby<br>
unexpectedly high potencies are obtained as a result of the combined effects of<br>
substantial retention of bioacttvity and increased duration of action in<br>
industrial use. The unusually high potencies of the conjugates of the present<br>
invention may be reflected in unusually high biomass production, unusually<br>
high levels of expression of recombinant proteins and other improvements in<br>
efficiencies of bioprocessing.<br>
[0080]	In additional embodiments, the invention provides alternative methods<br>
for increasing the biological potency of a preparation of interferon-beta,<br><br>
particularly a preparation of interferon-beta-1b. Methods according to this<br>
aspect of the invention may comprise, for example, removal of one or more<br>
inhibitory components from a preparation of interferon-beta (or interferon-<br>
beta-1b). According to this aspect of the invention, the one or more inhibitory<br>
components can be removed from the preparations by a variety of art-known<br>
methods of protein and peptide processing, purification and/or analysis,<br>
including but not limited to one or more chromatographic methods such as<br>
size-exclusion chromatography, reversed phase chromatography, hydrophobic<br>
interaction chromatography and affinity chromatography. As a practical<br>
matter, the determination of the biological potency of a given preparation of<br>
interferon-beta (i.e., whether the biological potency is increased, decreased or<br>
unaffected, relative to a stock solution of a cytokine such as interferon-beta)<br>
can be accomplished by any number of in vifro or in vivo assays that will be<br>
familiar to the ordinarily skilled artisan. For example, a cell culture assay that<br>
responds to interferon-beta can be used to determine the biological potency of<br>
interferon-beta preparations. Non-limiting examples of suitable such cell<br>
. culture assays include antiproliferative assays, antiviral assays, signal<br>
transduction assays and gene activation assays, examples of which are well-<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0081]	In related embodiments, the invention also provides methods for<br>
determining the amount of a polymer that is attached to the amino terminus of<br>
a protein having an N-terminal serine residue, in a polymer-protein conjugate<br>
synthesized by reductive alkylation. Methods according to this aspect of the<br>
invention comprise, for example, (a) reacting the conjugate with a sufficient<br>
quantity of an oxidizing agent for a sufficient time to cleave the polymer from<br>
the serine residue of the protein; and (b) measuring the increase in the portion<br>
of unconjugated protein in the preparation. Proteins suitable for use in<br>
accordance with such methods include, but are not limited to, cytokines<br>
(including interferon-beta (particularly interferon-beta-1b, which preferably<br>
has the amino acid sequence specified in SEQ ED NO.1) and megakaryocyte<br>
growth and development factor (Guerra, P.I., et al., (1998) Pharm Res<br><br>
75:1822-1827, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety). The oxidizing agent used in certain such methods of the<br>
invention may be a periodate including, but not limited to, sodium<br>
metaperiodate, potassium metaperiodate, lithium metaperiodate, calcium<br>
periodate, barium periodate and periodic acid. Suitable methods for<br>
measuring the increase in the portion of unconjugated protein in the<br>
preparation include any variety of art-known methods of protein and peptide<br>
analysis, including, for example, size-exclusion chromatography, reversed<br>
phase chromatography, gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis,<br>
ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, light scattering and mass spectroscopy.<br>
[0082]	In additional related embodiments, the invention provides methods for<br>
the selective oxidative cleavage of an N-terminal serine residue of a bioactive<br>
protein without oxidizing functionally essential amino acid residues of said<br>
bioactive protein. Certain such methods of the invention comprise, for<br>
example, (a) adjusting the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution of the<br>
bioactive protein to a pH of between about 5 and about 10, more preferably a<br>
pH of between about 7 and about 8; (b) mixing the solution of bioactive<br>
protein with about 0.1 moles to about 10 moles, or more preferably with about<br>
0.5 moles to about 5 moles, of a periodate per mole of bioactive protein; and<br>
(c) incubating said mixture for at least one hour, preferably at a temperature of<br>
between about 2°C and about 40°C. Proteins suitable for use in accordance<br>
with such methods include, but are not limited to, cytokines (including<br>
interferon-beta (particularly mterferon-beta-1b, which preferably has the<br>
amino acid sequence specified in SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
Methods<br>
[0083]	The present inventors have discovered that targeting of polymers to the<br>
amino-terminal amino acid of an "RN" receptor-binding protein or to the<br>
vicinity of the glycosylation site of an "RG" receptor-binding protein assures<br>
that the polymer is attached at a site that is remote from one or more of the<br>
receptor-binding regions or domains of the protein, thereby minimizing steric<br><br>
hindrance of receptor interactions by the attached polymer molecules.<br>
Consequently, a higher percentage of the receptor-binding activity can be<br>
preserved by conjugating proteins according to the methods of the present<br>
invention than would occur if the polymer were attached within or proximal to<br>
a portion of the molecule that is involved in binding to its receptor(s). This<br>
principle, which can result in unexpectedly high retention of receptor binding<br>
activity, can be demonstrated for receptor-binding proteins that are selected<br>
from among basic fibroblast growth factor ("bFGF" or "FGF-2"), epidermal<br>
growth factor ("EGF"), insulin-like growth factor-1 ("IGF-l"), interferon-<br>
alpha ("IFN-alpha"), interferon-6eta ("IFN-beta," including but not limited to<br>
IFN-beta-1b), granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor<br>
("GM-CSF"), monocyte colony stimulating factor ("M-CSF"), Flt3 ligand,<br>
stem cell factor ("SCF"), interleukins 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13 and 15,<br>
transforming growth factor-beta ("TGF-beta"), human growth hormone<br>
("hGH"), prolactin, placental lactogenic hormone, ciliary neurotrophic factor<br>
("CNTF"), leptin and structural analogs of these receptor-binding-proteins that<br>
mimic the actions of these proteins or that are receptor-binding antagonists<br>
thereof. In contrast, the selective attachment of a large polymer to the amino<br>
terminus of IFN-gamma is not predicted to preserve most of the activity of this<br>
cytokine, since such coupling is expected to interfere with binding of the<br>
active dimer to its receptors (based on data of Walter, M.R., et al., (1995)<br>
Nature 376:230-235).<br>
[0084]	In a related such embodiment of the invention, polymers are coupled to<br>
the amino-terminal residue of muteins of receptor-binding proteins that<br>
function as competitive antagonists of the natural protein by binding to one or<br>
more of the same receptor(s) without initiating signal transduction. Examples<br>
are polymer conjugates of an hGH antagonist that contains the point mutation<br>
G120R (Sundstrom, M., et al., (1996) J Biol Chem 277:32197-32203) and an<br>
antagonist of prolactin that contains the point mutation G129R (Goffin, V.,<br>
etai, (1997) J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia 2:1-11; Chen, W.Y., et al.,<br>
(1999) Clin Cancer Res 5:3583-3593; Chen, W.Y., PCT Publication No. WO<br><br>
99/58142 Al). Other antagonists of receptor-binding proteins can be<br>
produced by selective point mutations, truncations or deletions (see e.g.,<br>
Tchelet, A., et al, (1997) Mol Cell Endocrinol 750:141-152; Peterson, F.C.,<br>
(1998) Identification of Motifs Associated with the Lactogenic and<br>
Somatotropic Actions of Human Growth Hormone, Ph.D. Dissertation, Ohio<br>
State University, UMI # 9822357).<br>
[0085]	In additional embodiments of the invention, for "RG" receptor-binding<br>
proteins, the methods of the present invention result in the attachment of one<br>
or more synthetic polymers in proximity to the natural site of attachment of<br>
carbohydrate moieties of those receptor-binding proteins that are<br>
glycoproteins. This results in "pseudoglycosylation" of these receptor-binding<br>
proteins (for example, when they have been expressed by recombinant DNA<br>
technology in E. coli or other prokaryotic cells that do not perform post-<br>
translational glycosylation) or results in "pseudohyperglycosylation" of their<br>
glycoprotein forms (for example, for naturally produced glycoproteins or for<br>
glycoproteins produced by eukaryotic host cells [e.g., yeasts, plant cells and<br>
animal cells (including mammalian and insect cells), that do perform post-<br>
translational glycosylation). Examples are polymer conjugates of interferons<br>
alpha and beta, as well as of erythropoietin ("Epo") and interleukin-2. The<br>
attachment of synthetic polymers at or near the sites of natural glycosylation<br>
can be performed by any method that is known in the art, including the<br>
mutational method of R.J. Goodson, et al, ((1990) Biotechnology 5:343-346)<br>
and the method of R.S. Larson, et al., ((2001) Bioconjug Chem 72:861-869),<br>
which involves prior oxidation of the carbohydrate; the disclosures of these<br>
references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
[00861	Amino-terminal modification of certain proteins has been disclosed<br>
previously (see, e.g. Dixon, H.B.F., (1984) J Protein Chem 3:99-108). For<br>
example, N-terminal modification of proteins has been reported to stabilize<br>
certain proteins against the action of aminopeptidases (Guerra, P.I., et al,<br>
supra), to improve the solubility of the protein (Hinds, K., et al, (2000)<br>
Bioconjug Chem 77:195-201), to decrease the charge on the N-terminal amino<br><br>
group, or to improve the homogeneity of the resulting conjugates (Kinstler, O.,<br>
et al. European Patent Application No. EP 0 822 199 A2; Kinstler, O., et al.,<br>
(2002) Adv Drug Deliv Rev .54:477-485), among others. An alternative<br>
method for coupling polymers to the alpha amino group of an N-terminal<br>
cysteine or histidine residue, by an adaptation of a procedure known in the art<br>
as "native chemical ligation." has been disclosed (Roberts, M.J., et al., PCT<br>

No. 2003/0105224 Al, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entireties). However, the existence of the "RN" and "RG"<br>
subclasses of receptor-binding proteins, generally applicable methods for<br>
selecting members of those classes, and the preparation and use of polymer<br>
conjugates of such receptor-binding proteins as a way to preserve<br>
unexpectedly high functional activity of "RN" receptor-binding proteins, have<br>
not been recognized or described previously.<br>
[0087]	Hence, there is an advantage to determining whether or not a given<br>
cytokine has an N-terminus and/or glycosylation site(s) that are remote from<br>
the receptor-binding site(s) of the ligand. The ability to predict whether a<br>
given cytokine is an "RN" or an "RG" ligand, prior to conjugation of the<br>
ligand with a polymer, substantially decreases the experimentation required to<br>
produce polymer-ligand conjugates (e.g., cytokines or antagonists thereof<br>
conjugated with polymers, e.g., PEGs) in which the antigenicity and<br>
immunogenicity of the conjugate is reduced relative to the antigenicity and<br>
immunogenicity of the unconjugated ligand, while not substantially decreasing<br>
the receptor-binding and physiological activities of the conjugated ligand.<br>
[0088]	Accordingly, in additional embodiments, the present invention<br>
provides methods for identifying and selecting receptor-binding protein<br>
ligands {e.g., cytokines and antagonists thereof) that have an N-terminus<br>
and/or glycosylation site(s) that are remote from the receptor-binding sites of<br>
the protein ligands {i.e., methods for identifying and selecting for "RN" or<br>
"RG" proteins). In certain such embodiments of the invention, the optimum<br>
location for conjugation of one or more polymers {e.g., one or more PEGs) can<br><br>
be determined using molecular modeling, e.g., by viewing the 3-dimensional<br>
structure of the protein (cytokine or antagonist thereof) using molecular<br>
modeling software to predict the location(s) at which one or more polymers<br>
can be attached to the protein without a substantial loss in biological or<br>
receptor-binding activity of the protein (see also Schein, C.H., supra). An<br>
analogous approach has been demonstrated, for example, for conjugation of<br>
PEG to G-CSF in an attempt to improve its resistance to proteolytic digestion<br>
(see published U.S. Application No. 2001/0016191 A1 of T.D. Osslund, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).<br>
Suitable molecular modeling software for use in the present invention, such as<br>
RASMOL (Sayle et al., supra) and other programs used in generating the<br>
database of macromolecular structures deposited at the Protein Data Bank<br>
(PDB; see Laskowski, R.A., supra), is well-known in the art and will be<br>
familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. Using such molecular modeling<br>
software, the three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide, e.g., a cytokine or<br>
antagonist thereof, can be predicted or determined with a high degree of<br>
confidence, based on crystal [ographic analyses of the ligands and their<br>
receptors. In this way, one of ordinary skill can readily determine which<br>
ligands are "RN" or "RG" ligands that are suitable for use in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0089]	To practice the present invention, one convenient route for covalently<br>
coupling a water-soluble polymer to the alpha amino group of the N-terminal<br>
amino acid residue of a protein is by reductive alkylation of Schiff's bases<br>
formed with polymers bearing a single aldehyde group, e.g. as claimed by<br>
G.P. Royer (U.S. Patent No. 4,002,531), but not as claimed by J.M. Harris,<br>
et al., (U.S. Patent No. 5,252,714), since the latter inventors claim only<br>
polymers derivatized at both ends with aldehyde groups, which are cross-<br>
linking agents and are therefore ill-suited to the synthesis of long-acting<br>
receptor-binding proteins that retain substantial receptor-binding activity.<br>
[00901	Directing the reductive alkylation of Schiffs bases of PBG-<br>
monoaldehydes toward the alpha amino group of the N-terminal amino acid of<br><br>
a receptor-binding protein and away from the epsilon amino groups of its<br>
lysine residues can be accomplished by a variety of methods, based on the<br>
disclosures in J.T. Edsall in Chapters 4 and 5 of Proteins Amino Acids and<br>
Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions ((1943), Reinhold Publishing Corporation,<br>
New York), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety. The acidic dissociation constant ("pKa") of an alpha amino group of<br>
an N-terminal amino acid of a polypeptide is expected to be below 7.6,<br>
whereas the pKa values of the epsilon amino groups of lysine residues in<br>
polypeptides are expected to be approximately 9.5. Edsall ((1943, supra)<br>
clearly stated that aldehydes will combine with the amino group of an amino<br>
acid "only on the alkaline side of its isoelectric point."<br>
[0091]	Hence, based on the present disclosure and information that is readily<br>
available in the art, the ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that (1) the<br>
selective reaction of aldehydes with the alpha amino group of a protein will be<br>
favored by a range of pH that is below 9.5 (approximately the pKa of the<br>
epsilon amino groups in the protein); (2) the rate of reaction of aldehydes with<br>
epsilon amino groups will decrease if the pH of the reaction is lowered toward<br>
7.6 (approximately the pKa of the alpha amino group of the protein); (3) the<br>
rate of reaction of aldehydes with the alpha amino group will decrease less<br>
than that of the epsilon amino groups as the reaction pH is lowered toward 7.6,<br>
and (4) the selectivity for the reaction of an aldehyde with the alpha amino<br>
group will be improved somewhat by lowering the pH toward 6.6. Since the<br>
latter value is approximately one pH unit below the pKa of the alpha amino<br>
group and three pH units below the pKa of the epsilon amino groups,<br>
approximately 10% of the alpha amino groups and approximately 0.1% of the<br>
epsilon amino groups will be in their reactive, unprotonated state. Thus at pH<br>
6.6, the fraction of unprotonated alpha amino groups is 100-fold higher than<br>
the fraction of unprotonated epsilon amino groups. Therefore, very little<br>
increase in selectivity will be obtained by lowering the pH of the reaction<br>
further, e.g., to 5.6, where, theoretically, 1% of the alpha amino groups and<br>
0.01% of the epsilon amino groups would be in their reactive, unprotonated<br>
state. Thus, in certain embodiments of the invention, protein ligands<br><br>
(particularly "RN" or "RG" ligands, including cytokines and antagonists<br>
thereof) are conjugated with one or more polymers by forming a mixture<br>
between the ligand(s) and the one or more reactive polymers at a pH of about<br>
5.6 to about 7.6; at a pH of about 5.6 to about 7.0; at a pH of about 6.0 to<br>
about 7.0; at a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.0; at a pH of about 6.6 to about 7.6;<br>
at a pH of about 6.6 to about 7.0; or at a pH of about 6.6. The present methods<br>
thus differ significantly from those known in the art, in which coupling of<br>
polymers to alpha amino groups on the N-terminal amino acid residues of<br>
ligands is carried out at a pH of about 5 (Kinstler, O., et al., (2002) supra; EP<br>
0 822 199 A2; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,824,784 and 5,985,265; Roberts, M.J., et al,<br>
(2002), supra; Delgado, C, et al., U.S. Application Publication No.<br>
2002/0127244 Al), while coupling of polymers to epsilon amino groups of<br>
lysine residues in the ligand polypeptide backbone is carried out at a pH of 8.0<br>
(Kinstler, O., et al., EP 0 822 199 A2; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,824,784 and<br>
5,985,265). In the same way, the present methods also are significantly<br>
distinct from enzymatic methods that have been used for coupling alkylarnine<br>
derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) to certain proteins using transglutaminase,<br>
which is carried out at a pH of 7.5 (Sato, H., (2002) Adv Drug Deliv Rev<br>
54:487-504).<br>
[0092]	Reduction of the resultant Schiffs bases with mild reducing agents,<br>
such as sodium cyanoborohydride or pyridine borane (Cabacungan, J.C., et al.,<br>
(1982) Anal Biochem 124:212-21$), forms secondary amine bonds that<br>
preserve the positive charge of the N-terminal alpha amino group of the<br>
protein at physiological pH. Such bonds that retain the same charge as the<br>
native protein are more likely to preserve its biological activity than<br>
alternative linkage chemistries that neutralize the charge, e.g., by the<br>
formation of amide bonds (Burg, J., et al, PCT Publication No. WO 02/49673<br>
A2; Kinstler, O., et al., European Patent Application No. EP 0 822 199 A2;<br>
Kinstler, O., et al., (1996) Pharm Res, 75:996-1002; Kita, Y., et al. supra) or<br>
urethane bonds (Gilbert, C.W., et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,042,822; Grace, ML,<br>
et al., (2001) J Interferon Cytokine Res 27:1103-1115; Youngster, S., et al.,<br>
(2002) Curr Pharm Des 8:2139-2157).<br><br>
[0093]	Alternative approaches to selective coupling of polymers to N-terminal<br>
amino acid residues are known to those skilled in the art. Included are<br>
methods for coupling hydrazide, hydrazine, semicarbazide or other amine-<br>
containing polymers to N-terminal serine or threonine residues that have been<br>
oxidatively cleaved to aldehydes with periodate (Dixon, H.B.F., supra;<br>
Geoghegan, K.F., U.S. Patent No. 5,362,852; Gaertner, H.F., et al., (1996)<br>
Bioconjug Chem 7:38-44; Drummond, R.J., et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,423,685).<br>
Suitable Polymers<br>
[0094]	In certain embodiments of the invention, it is desirable to minimize the<br>
formation of intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links by polymers such<br>
as PEG during the reaction in which the polymer is coupled to the bioactive<br>
component to produce the conjugates of the invention. This can be<br>
accomplished by using polymers that are activated at only one end (referred to<br>
herein as "monofunctionally activated PEGs" or "monofunctionally activated<br>
PAGs") or polymer preparations in which the percentage of bifunctionally<br>
activated (referred to in the case of linear PEGs as "bis-activated PEG diols")<br>
or multi-functionally activated polymers is less than about 30%, or more<br>
preferably less than about 10% or most preferably less than about 2% (w/w).<br>
The use of activated polymers that are entirely or nearly entirely<br>
monofunctional can minimize the formation of all of the following:<br>
intramolecular cross links within individual protein molecules, "dumbbell"<br>
structures, in which one strand of polymer connects two protein molecules,<br>
and larger aggregates or gels.<br>
[0095]	Activated forms of polymers that are suitable for use in the methods<br>
and compositions of this invention can include any linear or branched,<br>
monofunctionally activated forms of polymers that are known in the art. For<br>
example, included are those with molecular weights (excluding the mass of the<br>
activating group) in the range of about 1 kDa to about 100kDa. Suitable<br>
ranges of molecular weights include but are not limited to about 5 kDa to<br>
about 30 kDa; about 8 kDa to about 14 kDa; about 10 kDa to about 20 kDa;<br>
about 18 kDa to about 60 kDa; about 18 kDa to about 22 kDa; about 12 kDa to<br><br>
about 30 kDa, about 5 kDa, about 10 kDa, about 20 kDa or about 30 kDa. In<br>
the case of linear PEGs, molecular weights of about 10 kDa, about 20 kDa or<br>
about 30 kDa correspond to degrees of polymerization (n) of about 230, about<br>
450 or about 680 monomelic units of ethylene oxide, respectively. It should<br>
be noted that long before the existence of the "RN" and "RG" classes of<br>
receptor-binding proteins was recognized, the advantages of coupling<br>
therapeutic proteins to polymers having relatively high molecular weights (i.e.,<br>
&gt;20-30 kDa) were first disclosed (Saifer, M, et al, PCT Publication No. WO<br>
89/01033 Al, published Feb. 9, 1989, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety).<br>
[0096]	In other embodiments of the invention, conjugates of receptor-binding<br>
proteins with unusually high percentages of retained bioactivity can be<br>
prepared for use in vitro e.g., in cell culture, by coupling monofunctionally<br>
activated polymers of about 1 kDa, about 2 kDa or about 5 kDa, according to<br>
the methods of this invention. For such in vitro applications, this lower range<br>
of molecular weights may be preferred.<br>
[0097]	Optionally, a linear polymer can have a reactive group at one end or<br>
both ends, thereby creating a "reactive polymer." In certain embodiments of<br>
this invention, it can be desirable to use the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of<br>
the monopropionic acid derivative of PEG, as disclosed in J.M. Harris, et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,672,662, which is incorporated herein fully by reference, or<br>
other N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated PEG-monocarboxylic acids. In certain<br>
other embodiments, it can be desirable to use either the monosuccimmidyl<br>
carbonate derivatives of PEG ("SC-PEG"). as described in M. Saifer, et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,006,333; 5,080,891; 5,283,317 and 5,468,478, or the mono-<br>
p-nitrophenyl carbonate derivative of PEG, as disclosed in S.J. Kelly, et al.,<br>
supra; in L.D. Williams, et al. PCT Publication No. WO 00/07629 A2, L.D.<br>
Williams, et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,576,235 and in MR. Sherman, et al., PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 01/59078 A2. Moreover, other types of reactive groups<br>
can be used to synthesize polymer conjugates of proteins: These derivatives<br>
include, but are not limited to, monoaldehyde derivatives of PEGs (Royer,<br><br>
G.P., U.S. Patent No. 4,002,531; Harris, J.M., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,252,714), monoamine, mono-tribromophenyl carbonate, monocarbonyl-<br>
imidazole, mono-trichlorophenyl carbonate, mono-trifiuorophenyl carbonate,<br>
monohydrazide, monohydrazine, monosemicarbazide, monocarbazate, mono-<br>
thiosemicarbazide, monoiodoacetamide, monomaleimide, mono-orthopyridyl<br>
disulfide, mono-oxime, mono-phenylglyoxal, mono-thiazolidine-2-thione,<br>
monothioester, monothiol, monotriazine and monovinylsulfone derivatives of<br>
PEGs. In additional embodiments, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors,<br>
polypeptide hormones and antagonists thereof can be coupled to one or more<br>
polymers as described in commonly owned, co-pending U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 10/669,597, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
Bioactive Components<br>
[0098]	As noted above, the conjugates of the invention comprise one PAG or<br>
PAO, and particularly one strand of PEG, covalently attached to one or more<br>
bioactive components. Bioactive components to which one or more polymers<br>
(or strands thereof) have been covalently attached are referred to herein<br>
variously and equivalently as "conjugated bioactive components" or "modified<br>
bioactive components." These terms are to be distinguished herein from<br>
"unconjugated bioactive components," "initial bioactive components" or<br>
"unmodified bioactive components," all of which terms refer to bioactive<br>
components that have not had polymers covaleatly attached thereto. It is to be<br>
understood, however, that an "unconjugated," "unmodified" or "initial"<br>
bioactive component may contain other, non-polymer conjugations or<br>
modifications when compared to a wild-type or native molecule, and would<br>
still be considered to be "unconjugated," "unmodified" or "initial" in<br>
accordance with the present invention, since the bioactive component would<br>
be "unconjugated," "unmodified" or "initial" with respect to the attachment of<br>
polymers, as is the case for bioactive components that are referred to herein as<br>
"Mock PEGylated."<br><br>
[0099]	The term "stabilizing" a bioactive component (or "methods of<br>
stabilization" or "stabilized bioactive component") indicates that a bioactive<br>
component has been stabilized according to the methods of this invention (i.e.,<br>
a bioactive component to which a polymer has been covalently attached<br>
according to the methods of the invention). Such stabilized bioactive<br>
components will exhibit certain altered biochemical and biophysical<br>
characteristics when compared to a bioactive component that has not been<br>
stabilized (i.e., a bioactive component to which a polymer has not been<br>
covalently attached). Included among such altered biochemical and<br>
biophysical parameters, particularly for receptor-binding proteins, may be<br>
decreased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and particularly the<br>
maintenance of the activity of a receptor-binding protein during incubation<br>
under certain harsh environmental or experimental conditions. In certain<br>
embodiments of the invention, the altered biochemical and biophysical<br>
parameters may include, for example, an increased half-life in the circulation<br>
in vivo, increased bioavailability, increased duration of action in vitro, and the<br>
like.<br>
[00100]	Any receptor-binding protein (typically a cytokine) having biological<br>
(i.e., physiological, biochemical or pharmaceutical) activity associated with<br>
portions of the molecule that are remote from its amino terminus or from a<br>
naturally occurring or mutationally-introduced glycosylation site can be<br>
suitably used as an initial component in the present invention. Such bioactive<br>
components include, but are not limited to, peptides, polypeptides, proteins<br>
and the like. Bioactive components also include fragments, muteins and<br>
derivatives of such peptides, polypeptides, proteins and the like, particularly<br>
such fragments, muteins and derivatives having biological (i.e., physiological,<br>
biochemical or pharmaceutical) activity.<br>
[00101]	Suitable peptides, polypeptides and proteins, glycoproteins and the like<br>
that are useful as bioactive components in the present invention include any<br>
peptide, polypeptide or protein, etc., having one or more than one available<br>
amino group, thiol group or other group that is remote from the receptor-<br><br>
binding region or regions of the bioactive component and to which polymers<br>
can be selectively attached. Such peptides, polypeptides, proteins,<br>
glycoproteins and the like include cytokines, which may have any of a variety<br>
of structures (Nicola, N.A., supra; Schein, C.H., supra).<br>
[00102]	For example, suitable peptides, polypeptides and proteins of interest<br>
include, but are not limited to the class of cytokines having structures<br>
comprising four α-helical bundles (both long-chain and short-chain<br>
subclasses) (for review, see Schein, C.H., supra). A variety of such four-<br>
helical bundle proteins are suitable for use in the present invention, including<br>
but not limited to interleukins, e.g., IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9,<br>
IL-10, IL-11, IL-12 (p35 subunit), IL-13, lL-15 and lL-17; colony-stimulating<br>
factors, e.g., macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-<br>
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Rozwarski, D.A., et al.,<br>
(1996) Proteins 25:304-313); interferons, e.g., IFN-α, IFN-β (including but<br>
not limited to IFN-β-1b) and consensus IFN; leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF);<br>
erythropoietin (Epo); thrombopoietin (Tpo); megakaryocyte growth and<br>
development factor (MGDF): stem cell factor (SCF), also known in the art as<br>
Steel Factor (Morrissey, P.J., et al., (1994) Cell Immunol 757:118-131;<br>
McNiece, I.K., et al., (1995) J Leukoc Biol 55:14-22); oncostatin M (OSM);<br>
phospholipase-activating protein (PLAP); neurotrophic factors; and peptide<br>
mimetics thereof. Although prolactin and growth hormone are classical<br>
hormones, which circulate widely in the body, unlike the cytokines, which are<br>
usually produced near their target cells, prolactin and growth hormone belong<br>
to the same structural class as the cytokines with four α-helical bundles<br>
(Nicola, N.A., supra; Goffin, V., et al., supra) and they are similarly suitable<br>
targets for polymer coupling and for production of the present conjugates in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
[00103]	Receptor-binding proteins of the long chain β-sheet or β-barrel<br>
structural classes (for review, see Schein, C.H., supra) are also suitable for use<br>
in preparing the conjugates and compositions of the present invention. These<br>
include, but are not limited to: the tumor necrosis factor family of cytokines,<br><br>
e.g., TNF-α, TNF-β and Fas ligands, which display β-jelly roll structures; the<br>
IL-1 (including IL-1a and IL-1) and FGF (including basic fibroblast growth<br>
factor (bFGF), acidic FGF, FGF-4 and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF;<br>
FGF-7)) families, which show a beta-trefoil fold (Schein, C.H., supra;<br>
Schlessinger, J., et al., supra); IL-12; IL-16; Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF;<br>
Lu, H.-S., et al., supra); and the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs),<br>
transforming growth factors (including transforming growth factor-a and<br>
transforming growth factor- (TGF-β)) and nerve growth factors, which adopt<br>
cystine-knot structures.<br>
[00104]	An additional structural class of proteins that are advantageously used<br>
in the conjugates and compositions of the present invention is that of the<br>
disulfide-rich mixed /β cytokines and growth factors (for review, see Schein,<br>
C.H., supra), including but not limited to: the EGF family, which has a beta-<br>
meander structure; IL-8; RANTES; neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2);<br>
stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α); the monocyte chemoattractant<br>
proteins (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3); the eotaxins (e.g., eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2<br>
and eotaxin-3); myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1 (MPIF-1); neurotactin,<br>
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF); growth-related oncogene/<br>
melanoma growth stimulatory activity (GRO-α/MGSA); somatomedins; and<br>
insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (e.g., IGF-1 and IGF-2). A related<br>
structural class of proteins of use in the conjugates and compositions of the<br>
present invention is cytokines with mosaic structures, which includes growth<br>
factors such as IL-12 and hepatocyte growth factor (Nicola, N.A., supra).<br>
[00105]	Other proteins of interest include, but are not limited to: growth<br>
hormones (particularly human growth hormone (hGH; see Tchelet, A., et al.,<br>
(1997) Mol Cell Endocrinol 130:141-152) and antagonists thereof (see, e.g.,<br>
Sundstrom, M., et al., (1996) J Biol Chem 277:32197-32203), prolactin and<br>
antagonists thereof, chorionic gonadotropin, follicle-stimulating hormone,<br>
thyroid-stimulating hormone, pigmentary hormones, hypothalamic releasing<br>
factors, antidiuretic hormones and receptor-binding antagonists of cytokines<br>
and growth factors of all of the above structural classes. Many such proteins<br><br>
exist in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms. The non-glycosylated<br>
forms may result from their production using recombinant DNA techniques in<br>
prokaryotes or using chemical synthesis. Such non-glycosylated products are<br>
among the peptides and proteins that are suitable bioactive components of the<br>
present invention. Finally, although some antibodies function as receptor-<br>
binding agonists or antagonists (see, e.g., Morris, J.C., et at., (2000) Ann<br>
Rheum Dis 59 (Suppl I):1109-1114), such immunoglobulins are not suitable<br>
candidates for N-terminal polymer coupling within the scope of this invention,<br>
i.e., they are not RN receptor-binding proteins, since the amino-terminal<br>
regions of both the light and heavy chains participate in antigen recognition.<br>
[00106]	Of particular use as bioactive components for use in preparing the<br>
polymer conjugates of the present invention are mterferon-alpha, interferon-<br>
beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, hGH, prolactin, insulin, lUF-1, EGF, bFGF and<br>
erythropoietin (Epo). Also of particular use are muteins and fragments of such<br>
bioactive components, particularly those capable of binding to the receptors<br>
for the corresponding wild-type or intact polypeptide, whether or not this<br>
binding induces a biological or physiological effect. In certain such<br>
embodiments, muteins and fragments, of the bioactive components can act as<br>
antagonists for the corresponding ligands, which reduce, substantially reduce<br>
or completely inhibit the binding of ligands to their receptors and/or the<br>
activity of the ligands on their target cells, tissues and/or organisms. Other<br>
antagonists, which may or may not be structural analogues, muteins, variants<br>
or derivatives of the ligands of interest, are also suitable for preparation of the<br>
conjugates in accordance with the present invention. As a practical matter,<br>
whether or not a given mutein, fragment, variant, derivative or antagonist<br>
antagonizes the biological and/or physiological effects of a given ligand can<br>
be determined, without undue experimentation, using assays for the<br>
biological/physiological effects of the ligand itself, a variety of which are<br>
well-known in the art and/or described herein.<br>
[00107]	The structures (primary, secondary, tertiary and, where applicable,<br>
quaternary) for these and other polypeptides of interest that are<br><br>
advantageously used in accordance with the present invention are well-known<br>
in the art and will be familiar to one of ordinary skill, particularly in view of<br>
the structures provided herein and in the references cited herein, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
Conjugates<br>
[00108]	The present invention provides stable conjugates of bioactive<br>
components, particularly of cytokines, for use in a variety of applications.<br>
Such conjugates of the invention have a number of advantages over those<br>
previously known in the art, as shown by the following non-limiting and<br>
exemplary comparisons of art-known conjugates:<br>
[001091	H. Hiratani (European Patent No. EP0 098 110 B1 and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,609,546) discloses conjugates of copolymers of ethylene oxide and<br>
propylene oxide ("PEG-PPG," a member of the general class of PAGs) with<br>
proteins, including interferons and interleukins, wherein no preference for<br>
avoiding regions of the proteins involved in receptor binding is disclosed. In<br>
these references, interferons alpha, beta and gamma were considered to be<br>
equivalent targets for coupling, of PAG, unlike in the present invention<br>
wherein interferon-gamma is not considered to be a suitable target for<br>
N-terminal coupling because the amino terminus is within the receptor-<br>
binding region of this cytokine. In addition, Hiratani discloses conjugates<br>
synthesized only with PAGs of I kDa to 10 kDa, whereas the methods of the<br>
present invention prefer the coupling of water-soluble, synthetic polymers<br>
with molecular weights exceeding 10 kDa for therapeutic applications.<br>
Analogously, N.V. Katre ((1990) supra) discloses that coupling larger<br>
numbers of strands of 5-kDa mPEG to human recombinant interleukin-2<br>
increases the life-times of the resultant conjugates in the bloodstreams of mice<br>
and rabbits. However, this reference did not disclose or recognize the<br>
advantage of coupling a smaller number of longer strands of PEG or of<br>
coupling a single strand of high molecular weight PEG to the amino terminus<br>
of IL-2, as provided by the present invention.<br><br>
[00110]	G. Shaw (U.S. Patent No. 4,904,584 and PCT Publication No.<br>
WO 89/05824 A2) discloses methods for inducing site-selective attachment of<br>
amine-reactive polymers by introducing, replacing or deleting lysine residues<br>
in the target protein, especially Epo, G-CSF and IL-2. However, unlike the<br>
disclosure of the present invention, these references do not disclose that<br>
amine-reactive polymers can react with any amine in the target protein other<br>
than the epsilon amino groups of lysine residues, clearly distinguishing these<br>
disclosures from the present invention.<br>
[00111]	D.E. Nitecki et al., (U.S. Patent No. 4,902,502) disclose multiply<br>
PEGylated IL-2 conjugates that were prepared from various chloroformate<br>
derivatives of PEG that were intended to react with the epsilon amino groups<br>
of lysine residues. In contrast to the present methods, however, this reference<br>
discloses no method to avoid PEGylation of" lysine residues in regions of the<br>
IL-2 protein that are involved in receptor binding, nor any awareness that<br>
avoidance of such sites is advantageous.<br>
[00112]	N. Katre, et al., (U.S. Patent No, 5,206,344) disclose PEG-IL-2 conju-<br>
gates in which PEG is coupled to the epsilon amino groups of lysine residues,<br>
to the unpaired sulfhydryl group of the naturally occurring cysteine residue at<br>
position 125 (counting from the amino terminus) or to the sulfhydryl group of<br>
a cysteine residue that has been mutationally introduced between the first and<br>
twentieth residues from the amino terminus of IL-2. Included among the<br>
muteins that are disclosed in the '344 patent is "des-ala-1" IL-2, i.e., a mutein<br>
in which the amino-terminal alanine is deleted and not PEGylated. In contrast<br>
to the present: disclosure, however, the '344 patent does not disclose any<br>
method for avoiding coupling PEG to amino acid residues that are involved in<br>
binding to receptors, nor any recognition that such an approach would be<br>
advantageous. Consistent with this notion, and in contrast to the present<br>
invention, the broad range of points of attachment proposed in the '344 patent<br>
does not suggest that coupling PEG to the amino terminus of IL-2 would be<br>
especially advantageous.<br><br>

Monkarsh, et al., (1997) in Harris, J.M., et al., eds., Poly(ethylene glycol):<br>
Chemistry and Biological Applications, pp. 207-216, American Chemical<br>
Society, Washington, D.C., disclose that reacting interferon-alpha-2a with a<br>
three-fold molar excess of an activated PEG with a molecular weight of 5,300<br>
Daltons produces eleven positional isomers of monoPEG-interferon,<br>
corresponding to the eleven lysine residues in interferon-alpha-2a. No PEG-<br>
interferon in which the PEG is coupled to the alpha amino group at the amino<br>
terminus of the interferon was reported. The eleven positional isomers<br>
reported in these references displayed antiviral activities in cell cultures that<br>
ranged from 6% to 40% of that of the unmodified interferon and<br>
antiproliferative activities in cell cultures that ranged from 9% to 29% of that<br>
of the unmodified interferon. Such results clearly demonstrate that the random<br>
PEGylation of lysine residues practiced by these investigators interfered with<br>
the functions of interferon-alpha-2a mediated by its receptors, in contrast to<br>
conjugates prepared by the methods of the present invention. In addition,<br>
unlike the conjugates of the present invention, there was no N-terminally<br>
PEGylated interferon in the conjugates reported in these references.<br>
[00114]	O. Nishimura et al., (U.S. Patent Statutory Invention Registration No.<br>
H1662) disclose conjugates of interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma and IL-2<br>
that are prepared by reductive alkylation of activated "polyethylene glycol<br>
methyl ether aldehydes" with sodium cyanoborohydride at pH 7.0 (for the<br>
interferon conjugates) or pH 7.15 (for the IL-2 conjugates). The conjugates<br>
prepared by such methods, however, were reported to have lost up to 95% of<br>
the bioactivity of the unmodified proteins, apparently due to the presence of<br>
multiple sites of polymer attachment, all of which were reported to be on the<br>
epsilon amino groups of lysine residues (cf., Figures 1 and 4 of the present<br>
invention).<br>
[00115]	D.K. Pettit, et al., (1997) J Biol Chan 272:2312-2318, disclose<br>
polymer conjugates of interleukin-15 ("IL-15"). The conjugated IL-15<br>
reported in this reference, however, not only lost its IL-2-like growth-<br><br>
promoting capacity as a result of coupling polymers to lysine residues in<br>
regions of the protein that are involved in receptor binding, but it also showed<br>
antagonism rather than agonism. These authors conclude that selective<br>
inhibition of binding of IL-15 to one of several cell surface receptors can be a<br>
consequence of polymer conjugation and that such inhibition can not only<br>
decrease receptor binding, but can reverse the biological effect of the protein.<br>
By avoiding the coupling of polymers to portions of the receptor-binding<br>
protein that are involved in interactions with their receptors, the present<br>
invention avoids this undesirable consequence of polymer coupling.<br>
[00116]	J. Hakimi, et al., (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,792,834 and 5,834,594) disclose<br>
urethane-linked PEG conjugates of proteins, including interferon-alpha. IL-2,<br>
interleukin-1 ("IL-1") and an antagonist of the IL-1-receptor, which were<br>
reportedly prepared in order to decrease the immunogenicity, increase the<br>
solubility and increase the biological half-life of the respective proteins. In<br>
these references, PEG was coupled to "various free amino groups," with no<br>
reference to N-terminal PEGylation and no disclosure that the N-terrninal<br>
alpha amino groups could or should be PEGylated. These patents also state<br>
that the conjugate disclosed therein "has at least a portion" of the original<br>
biological activity of the starting protein, thus indicating possible loss of<br>
substantial bioactivity. This result would be consistent with the use of the<br>
untargeted PEGylation methods disclosed therein. In contrast to the present<br>
invention, these patents do not disclose any attempt to improve the retention of<br>
bioactivity of their conjugates by altering the selectivity of the PEGylation<br>
processes disclosed therein.<br>
[00117]	O.B. Kinstler, et al., (European Patent Application No.<br>
EP 0 822 199 A2) disclose a. process for reacting poly(ethylene glycol) with<br>
the alpha amino group of the amino acid at the amino terminus of a<br>
polypeptide, especially consensus interferon and G-CSF, which are two of the<br>
proteins manufactured by Arngen, Inc., the assignee of this patent application.<br>
This publication indicates that "a pH sufficiently acidic to selectively activate<br>
the alpha amino group" is a necessary feature of the disclosed process. In<br><br>
contrast, by the present invention it has been discovered that lowering the pH<br>
decreases the reactivity of amino groups with PEG aldehydes and that the<br>
alpha amino group is more reactive when it is not protonated, i.e., at a pH<br>
above its pKa. Thus, the present inventors find that no pH is "sufficiently<br>
acidic to selectively activate the alpha amino group" of any of the RN<br>
cytokine conjugates of the present invention. The explanations of the pH<br>
dependence of the reactivity of N-terminal alpha amino groups with aldehydes<br>
given by J.T. Edsall (supra) and by R.S. Larsen et al., ((2001) Bioconjug<br>
Chem 72:861-869) are more compatible with the experience of the present<br>
inventors. Furthermore, Kinstler et al. report the use of N-terminal<br>
PEGylation of polypeptides for increased homogeneity of the resulting<br>
conjugates and protection of the amino terminus from degradation by<br>
proteinases, but do not disclose that N-terminal PEGylation can preserve a<br>
greater fraction of the receptor-binding activity of certain receptor-binding<br>
proteins (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 96/11953; European Patent No.<br>
EP 0 733 067 B1, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,770,577, 5,824,784 and 5,985,265,<br>
,all of Kinstler, O.B., et al).<br>
[00118]	The European application of Kinstler et al. (EP0 822 199 A2) also<br>
generalizes the benefits of N-terminal PEGylation to all polypeptides, which<br>
has not been the experience of the present inventors. Specifically, since the<br>
amino termini of antibody molecules occur proximal to the antigen-combming<br>
region of the antibody proteins (Chapman, A.P. (2002) Adv Drug Deliv Rev<br>
54:531-545), N-terminal PEGylation of antibodies is unexpectedly deleterious<br>
to bioactiviry, compared to random PEGylation of lysine residues, as disclosed<br>
by Larsen, R.S., et al., supra. Similarly, N-terminal PEGylation of receptor-<br>
binding proteins that are not "RN" receptor-binding proteins, e.g., interferon-<br>
gamma (see Figure 8), is expected to be more inhibitory of interactions with<br>
receptors than random PEGylation of the lysine residues of such receptor-<br>
binding proteins.<br>
[00119]	Thus, as noted above, the methods of the present invention are<br>
distinguished from those disclosed by Kinstler et al. in the publications cited<br><br>
herein, in that the conjugates of the present invention are prepared by<br>
conjugating one or more cytokines or antagonists thereof that are selected as<br>
RN receptor-binding proteins with one or more polymers by forming a<br>
mixture between the ligand(s) and the one or more polymers at a pH of about<br>
5.6 to about 7.6; at a pH of about 5.6 to about 7.0; at a pH of about 6.0 to<br>
about 7.0; at a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.0: at a pH of about 6.6 to about 7.6;<br>
at a pH of about 6.6 to about 7.0; or at a pH of about 6.6. In contrast, the<br>
methods of Kinstler et al. rely on conjugation of ligands at a pH below 5.5,<br>
which pH range the present inventors have found to be suboptimal or inferior<br>
for preparing preparations of ligands selectively conjugated with polymers at<br>
remote N-terminal amino acids and/or at remote glycosylation sites.<br>
[00120]	Pepinsky, B., et al., (PCT Publication No. WO 00/23114 and U.S.<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0021765 Al) disclose polymer<br>
conjugates of glycosylated interferon-beta-1a that are more active than<br>
nonglycosylated interferon-beta-1b in an antiviral assay. When Pepinsky<br>
etal. coupled 5-fcDa or 20-kDa mPEG to the amino terminus of IFN-β-1a by<br>
reductive alkylation, no effect of PEGylation on the antiviral potency was<br>
observed, whereas the coupling of PEGs of higher molecular weight decreased<br>
or eliminated the potency. This reference also discloses that polyalkylene<br>
glycol can be coupled to the interferon-beta-1a via a variety of coupling<br>
groups at various sites, including the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus<br>
and the carbohydrate moiety of the glycosylated protein. The methods<br>
disclosed in this publication., however, are stated not to be generalizable:<br>
"[t]hese studies indicate that, despite the conservation in sequence between<br>
interferon-beta-1a and interferon-beta-1b, they are distinct biochemical<br>
entities and therefore much of what is known about interferon--beta-1b cannot<br>
be applied to interferon-beta-1a, and vice versa." In contrast, the present<br>
invention discloses the common features embodied in "RN" and "RG"<br>
receptor-binding proteins, as defined herein. According to the present<br>
invention, both interferon-beta-1a and interferon-beta-1b are "RN" receptor-<br>
binding proteins. In addition, interferon-beta-1b is an "RG" receptor-binding<br><br>
protein. Accordingly, in contrast to the methods of WO 00/23114, the<br>
methods of the present invention are useful for preparing stable, bioactive<br>
conjugates of both interferon-beta-1b and interferon-beta-1a.<br>
[001211	Z. Wei, et al., (U.S. Patent No. 6,077,939), disclose methods for<br>
coupling water-soluble polymers (especially PEG) to the N-terminal alpha<br>
carbon atom of a polypeptide (especially erythropoietin), wherein the amine at<br>
the alpha carbon of the N-terminal amino acid is first transaminated to an<br>
alpha carbonyl group that is then reacted with a PEG derivative to form an<br>
oxime or a hydrazone bond. Since the disclosed objective of this reference<br>
was to develop a method that would be applicable to proteins in general, no<br>
consideration was given to the preservation of receptor-binding activity that<br>
can result from the choice of the amino terminus as the site of PEGylation of<br>
certain receptor-binding proteins. Thus, in contrast to the disclosure of Wei,<br>
et al., the present invention does not require the removal of the N-terminal<br>
alpha amino group, but, in contrast, can preserve the charge of the N-terminal<br>
alpha amino group at neutral pH through the formation of a secondary anune<br>
linkage between the protein and the polymer.<br>
[00122]	C.W. Gilbert et al, (U.S. Patent No. 6,042,822; European Patent No.<br>
EP 1 039 922 B1) disclose the desirability of a mixture of positional isomers<br>
of PEG-interferon-alpha2b wherein an especially desirable isomer has PEG<br>
coupled to a histidine residue of interferon-alpha-2b, especially histidine-34,<br>
and demonstrate that the PEG linkage to histidine-34 is unstable. Since<br>
histidine-34 lies on the surface of interferon-alpha-2b in a region that must<br>
come into intimate contact with an interferon receptor in order to trigger signal<br>
transduction (see Figure 1b of the present specification), the instability of the<br>
linkage between PEG and histidine-34 disclosed in these references appears to<br>
be critical to the function of the PEG-interferon conjugate disclosed therein.<br>
Substantially pure histidine-linked protein polymer conjugates were described<br>
by S. Lee et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,985,263. In contrast, the present invention<br>
demonstrates that one preferred conjugate is a PEG-interferon conjugate<br><br>
wherein the PEG is stably linked at a site that is remote from the receptor-<br>
binding domains of the interferon component.<br>
[00123]	P. Bailon, et al., ((2001) Bioconjug Chem 72:195-202), disclose that<br>
interferon-alpha-2a that is PEGylated with one molecule of 40-kDa di-mPEG-<br>
lysine per molecule of interferon is comprised of four major positional<br>
isomers. This reference discloses that nearly all of the PEG was attached by<br>
amide bonds to lysines 31, 121, 131 or 134, each of which is within or<br>
adjacent to the receptor-binding domains of interferon-alpha-2a (residues 29-<br>
35 and 123-140, according to Bailon et al.; see. Figure 1a of the present<br>
specification). N-terminal PEGylation was not reported by Bailon et al.<br>
Antiviral activity of the isolated mixture of positional isomers of PEG-<br>
interferon against Vesicular Stomatitis Virus infection of Madin-Darby bovine<br>
kidney cells in vitro was reported to be 7% of that of the unconjugated<br>
interferon-alpha-2a that was tested. The substantial loss of bioactivity that<br>
was observed for these PEG-interferon conjugates that do not include<br>
N-terminally PEGylated interferon thus clearly distinguishes the conjugates of<br>
Bailon et al. from those of the present invention<br>
[00124]	R.B. Pepinsky et al., ((2001) J Pharmacol Exp Ther 297:1059-1066),<br>
disclose synthesis of a conjugate from (1) glycosylated interferon-beta-1a<br>
having an N-terminal methionine residue and (2) a 20-kDa PEG-aldehyde.<br>
The conjugate, which is referred to in the reference as being monoPEGylated<br>
at the N-terminal methionine, is said to retain full bioactivity in an antiviral<br>
assay. While these authors disclose that their choice of the N-terminal site for<br>
PEGylation of glycosylated interferon-beta-1a was dictated by the availability<br>
of site-selective PEGylation reagents and molecular modeling., they<br>
acknowledge that "some effects are product specific." Moreover, and in<br>
contrast to the present invention, the observations reported therein were not<br>
generalized to include the class of receptor-binding proteins that are defined<br>
herein as "RN" receptor-binding proteins.<br>
[00125]	J. Burg, et al., (PCT Publication No. WO 01/02017 A2) disclose the<br>
production of alkoxyPEG conjugates of erythropoietin glycoproteins, wherein<br><br>
one to three strands of a methoxyPEG was/were reacted with sulfhydryl<br>
groups that were introduced chemically by modification of epsilon amino<br>
groups of lysine residues on the surface of the glycoprotein. In contrast to the<br>
present invention, however, this reference does not disclose any attempt to<br>
couple PEG to the free alpha amino group of the N-terminal amino acid of<br>
erythropoietin or to avoid modifying lysine residues in regions of the<br>
erythropoietin glycoprotein that are essential for interactions with<br>
erythropoietin receptors.<br>
[00126]	J. Burg, et al, (PCT Publication No. WO 02/49673 A2) disclose the<br>
synthesis of N-terrninally amide-linked PEG conjugates of natural and mutein<br>
erythropoietin glycoproteins by a process that employs selectively cleavable<br>
N-terminal peptide extensions that are cleaved before PEGylation and after<br>
reversible citraconylation of all epsilon amino groups of the lysine residues of<br>
the glycoprotein. The disclosed rationale for the multi-step process in this<br>
reference was to make the PEGylation process selective for the free alpha<br>
amino group of the N-terminal amino acid in order to produce homogeneous<br>
monoPEGylated conjugates, thereby avoiding the need to separate<br>
monoPEGylated conjugates from multiply PEGylated derivatives. This<br>
method differs from that of the present invention in a number of important<br>
respects, including but not limited to: (1) the approach of Burg et al. is limited<br>
to erythropoietin glycoproteins to which alkoxyPEG is linked via amide<br>
bonds, while the present invention is applicable to a variety of bioactive<br>
components conjugated using a variety of synthetic polymers; (2) the present<br>
invention applies to both glycosylated and nonglycosylated "RN" and "RG"<br>
receptor-binding proteins, whereas Burg et al. disclose only the conjugation of<br>
glycoproteins; (3) the present invention encompasses both alkoxyPEGs, such<br>
as mPEG, and monofunctionally-activated hydroxyPEGs, whereas Burg et al.<br>
disclose only the use of alkoxyPEGs; and (4) in the present invention,<br>
secondary amine linkages between the polymer and the protein are preferred<br>
over the amide linkages used by Burg et al., since the former are more stable<br>
and conserve the positive charge on the amino group. In analogous work from<br><br>
the same group, J. Burg, et al., (U.S. Patent No. 6,340,742) disclose the<br>
production of amide-linked conjugates of erythropoietin glycoproteins,<br>
wherein one to three strands of alkoxyPEG is/are linked to one to three amino<br>
groups of the protein. In contrast to the present invention, however, this<br>
reference reports no preference for the alpha amino group of the N-terminal<br>
amino acid or for amino groups that are not in regions that are involved in<br>
interactions with receptors.<br>
[00127]	C. Delgado et al., (U.S. Patent No. 6,384,195) disclose conjugates of<br>
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor that are prepared using a<br>
reactive polymer that is represented as tresyl monomethoxyPEG and is<br>
referred to therein as "TMPEG." This reference indicates that when TMPEG<br>
is contacted with recombinant human GM-CSF, "[t]he modified material<br>
contains species with no activity and with higher activity than unmodified<br>
material." As one of ordinary skill will readily recognize, species with no<br>
activity are undesirable in a mixture of polymer-bioactive component<br>
conjugates, particularly in compositions for therapeutic use that comprise such<br>
conjugates, since they can contribute to the risks of administering the<br>
conjugate to a patient in need of such administration without contributing to<br>
the beneficial effects. As noted herein, the present invention overcomes this<br>
limitation in the art at least in part by avoiding modification of GM-CSF and<br>
other receptor-binding proteins at sites on the proteins that are involved in its<br>
receptor-binding activity, thereby reducing or eliminating the synthesis of<br>
species with no activity. The present invention also provides methods for the<br>
fractionation and purification of conjugates that have different sizes, different<br>
charges and/or different extents of shielding of charges on the protein by the<br>
polymer (see Figures 9-12).<br>
[00128]	It is noteworthy that U.S. Patent No. 6,384,195 does not mention the<br>
N-terminal PEGylation of GM-CSF and therefore does not recognize the<br>
advantages of the methods of the present invention. Finally, U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,384,195 indicates a preference for conjugates in which more than one PEG<br>
is coupled to each molecule of GM-CSF, without any consideration of where<br><br>
on the GM-CSF molecule those PEG molecules are attached (other than being<br>
coupled to lysine residues). By stating a preference for conjugates with up to<br>
six PEG molecules per GM-CSF, the reference thus states a preference for<br>
conjugates in which PEG might be attached to all possible lysine residues,<br>
thereby ensuring that PEG will be attached in positions that sterically hinder<br>
close approach of the protein to its cell-surface receptors (see Figure 3 of the<br>
present specification). By contrast, the present invention indicates the<br>
undesirability of coupling PEG to lysine residues, except when those lysine<br>
residues are remote from the domains of the receptor-binding protein that are<br>
essential for interactions with the receptors and hence for signal transduction<br>
(in the case of agonists) or in order to competitively inhibit signal transduction<br>
(in the case of antagonists).<br>
[00129]	T. Nakamura, et al., (PCT Publication No. WO 02/32957 A1) discloses<br>
that increasing the molecular weight of PEG that is coupled to the epsilon<br>
amino group of the lysine residue at position 52 of erythropoietin glycoprotein<br>
increases the erythropoietic effect of the conjugate in vivo while decreasing<br>
the affinity of the conjugate for erythropoietin receptors. In contrast to the<br>
present invention, however, this reference does not disclose the coupling of<br>
PEG at the amino terminus or near a glycosylation site, nor does it recognize<br>
any advantage to doing so.<br>
[00130]	Hence, the present invention provides conjugates of bioactive<br>
components coupled to synthetic polymers that have distinct structural and<br>
functional advantages to those that have been previously disclosed.<br>
Compositions<br><br>
[00131]	The invention provides conjugates or complexes comprising one or<br>
more bioactive components, suitably one or more cytokines, coupled to one or<br>
more stabilizing polymers such as one or more PEGs. Typically, such<br>
conjugates are produced by the methods of the present invention described<br>
herein; however, conjugates having the structures and activities described<br>
herein, regardless of the methods used to produce such conjugates, are<br>
considered equivalent to those produced by the present methods and are<br>
therefore encompassed by the present invention. In related aspects, the<br>
invention also provides compositions comprising one or more such conjugates<br>
or complexes. Compositions according to this aspect of the invention will<br>
comprise one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, ten, etc.) of the above-<br>
described conjugates or complexes of the invention. In certain such aspects,<br>
the compositions may comprise one or more additional components, such as<br>
one or more buffer salts, one or more chaotropic agents, one or more<br>
detergents, one or more proteins (e.g., albumin or one or more enzymes), one<br>
or more unbound polymers, one or more osmotically active agents and the<br>
like. The compositions of this aspect of the invention may be in any form,<br>
including solid (e.g., dry powder) or solution (particularly in the form of a<br>
physiologically compatible buffered salt solution comprising one or more of<br>
the conjugates of the invention).<br>
A. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[00132]	Certain compositions of the invention arc particularly formulated for<br>
use as pharmaceutical compositions for use in prophylactic, diagnostic or<br>
therapeutic applications. Such compositions will typically comprise one or<br>
more of the conjugates, complexes or compositions of the invention and one<br>
or more pharniaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The term<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient," as used herein, refers to a<br>
non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or<br>
formulation auxiliary of any type that is capable of being tolerated by a<br>
recipient animal, including a human or other mammal, into which the<br><br>
pharmaceutical composition is introduced, without adverse effects resulting<br>
from its addition.<br>
[00133]	The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be<br>
administered to a recipient via any suitable mode of administration, such as<br>
orally, rectally, parenterally, intrasystemically, vaginally, intraperitoneally,<br>
topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), buccally, as<br>
an oral or nasal spray or by inhalation. The term "parenteral" as used herein<br>
refers to modes of administration that include intravenous, intra-arterial,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracistemal, subcutaneous and intra-articular<br>
injection and infusion.<br>
[00134]	Pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention for<br>
parenteral injection can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous<br>
or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as<br>
sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions<br>
prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents,<br>
solvents or vehicles include Avater, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol and the<br>
. like, propylene glycol, poly(ethylene glycol)), carboxymethylcellulose and<br>
suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable<br>
organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for<br>
example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance<br>
of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of<br>
surfactants.<br>
[00135]	Such pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also<br>
contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents<br>
and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be<br>
ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for<br>
example, paraben, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the<br>
like. It may also be desirable to include osmotic agents such as sugars, sodium<br>
chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical<br>
form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption,<br>
such as aluminum monostearate, hydrogels and gelatin.<br><br>
[00136]	In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drugs, it is desirable<br>
to slow the absorption from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This<br>
may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or<br>
amorphous material with poor solubility in aqueous body fluids. The rate of<br>
absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn,<br>
may depend upon its physical form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a<br>
parenterally administered drug form can be accomplished by dissolving or<br>
suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
[00137]	Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated<br>
matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as poliylactide-<br>
polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to carrier polymer and the<br>
nature of the particular carrier polymer employed, the rate of drug release can<br>
be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include<br>
biocompatible poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or<br>
microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00138]	The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the<br>
form of sterile solid compositions that can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile<br>
water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[00139]	Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets,<br>
pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active<br>
compounds are mixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient<br>
or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or<br>
extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid,<br>
b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and gum acacia., c) humectants such as<br>
glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato<br>
or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,<br>
e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) accelerators of absorption, such<br>
as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br><br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) adsorbents such as kaolin and<br>
bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, solid PEGs, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case<br>
of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering<br>
agents.<br>
[00140]	Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft- and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose (milk<br>
sugar) as well as high molecular weight PEGs and the like.<br>
[00141]	The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules<br>
can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric or chronomodulating<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.<br>
They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of such a<br>
composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in<br>
a certain part of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric<br>
substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in micro-<br>
encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned<br>
excipients.<br>
[00142]	Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may<br>
contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or<br>
other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl<br>
benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in<br>
particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils),<br>
glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, PEGs and fatty acid esters of sorbitan,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00143]	In addition to inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include<br>
adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents,<br>
sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.<br><br>
[00144]	Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain<br>
suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
[00145]	Topical administration includes administration to the skin or mucosa,<br>
including surfaces of the lung and eye. Compositions for topical<br>
administration, including those for inhalation, may be prepared as a dry<br>
powder which may be pressurized or non-pressurized. In non-pressurized<br>
powder compositions, the active ingredients in finely divided form may be<br>
used in admixture with a larger-sized pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier<br>
comprising particles having a size, for example, of up to 100 micrometers in<br>
diameter. Suitable inert carriers include sugars such as lactose and sucrose.<br>
Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have<br>
an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometer.<br>
[00146]	Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition may be pressurized and<br>
contain a compressed gas, such as nitrogen or a liquefied gas propellant. The<br>
liquefied propellant medium and indeed the total composition may be<br>
preferably such that the active ingredients do not dissolve therein to any<br>
substantial extent. The pressurized composition may also contain a surface-<br>
active agent. The surface-active agent may be a liquid or solid non-ionic<br>
surface-active agent or may be a solid anionic surface-active agent, it is<br>
preferable to use the solid anionic surface-active agent in the form of a<br>
sodium salt.<br>
[00147]	A further form of topical administration is to the eye. In this mode of<br>
administration, the conjugates or compositions of the invention are delivered<br>
in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle, such that the active<br>
compounds are maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient<br>
time period to allow the compounds to penetrate the conjunctiva or the corneal<br>
and internal regions of the eye, as for example the anterior chamber, posterior<br>
chamber, vitreous body, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea, iris/ciliary,<br><br>
lens, choroid/retina and sclera. The pharmaceuticaliy acceptable ophthalmic<br>
vehicle may, for example, be an ointment, vegetable oil or an encapsulating<br>
material.<br>
[00148]	Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositories that can be prepared by mixing the conjugates or compositions<br>
of the invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as<br>
cocoa butter, PEG or a suppository wax, which are solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal<br>
cavity and release the drugs.<br>
[00149]	The pharmaceutical compositions used in the present therapeutic<br>
methods may also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in<br>
the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid<br>
substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic,<br>
physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming<br>
liposomes can be used. In addition to one or more of the conjugates or<br>
compositions of the invention, the present pharmaceutical compositions in<br>
liposome form can also contain one or more stabilizers, preservatives,<br>
excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and the<br>
phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form<br>
liposomes are known in the art (see, e.g., Zalipsky, S., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,395,619). Liposomes that comprise phospholipids that are conjugated to<br>
PEG, most commonly phosphatidyl ethanolamine coupled to monomethoxy-<br>
PEG, have advantageous properties, including prolonged lifetimes in the blood<br>
circulation of mammals (Fisher, D., U.S. Patent No. 6,132,763).<br>
B. Uses<br>
[00150]	As noted elsewhere herein, the methods, conjugates and compositions<br>
of the present invention are advantageously used in methods for maintaining<br>
or enhancing the bioactivity of the biological components without interfering<br>
with the ability of the biological components to bind to their receptors.<br><br>
Certain such methods of the invention may entail delivering one or more of<br>
the conjugates and compositions to cells, tissues, organs or organisms- In<br>
particular, the invention provides controlled delivery of the one or more<br>
components of the conjugates, complexes or compositions to cells, tissues,<br>
organs or organisms, thereby providing the user with the ability to regulate,<br>
temporally and spatially, the amount of a particular component that is released<br>
for activity on the cells, tissues, organs or organisms.<br>
[00151]	In general, such methods of the invention involve one or more<br>
activities. For example, one such method of the invention comprises:<br>
(a) preparing one or more conjugates or compositions of the invention as<br>
detailed herein; and (b) contacting one or more cells, tissues, organs or<br>
organisms with the one or more conjugates or compositions, under conditions<br>
favoring the binding of the one or more conjugates or compositions of the<br>
invention to the cells, tissues, organs or organisms. Once the bioactive<br>
components of the conjugates and/or compositions of the invention have been<br>
bound by (or, in some cases, internalized by) the cells, tissues, organs or<br>
-organisms, the components proceed to carry out their intended biological<br>
functions. For example, peptide components may bind to receptors or other<br>
components on or within the cells, tissues, organs or organisms; to participate<br>
in metabolic reactions within the cells, tissues, organs or organisms; to carry<br>
out, upregulate or activate, or downregulate or inhibit, one or more enzymatic<br>
activities within the cells, tissues, organs or organisms; to provide a missing<br>
structural component to the cells, tissues, organs or organisms; to provide one<br>
or more nutritional needs; to the cells, tissues, organs or organisms; to inhibit,<br>
treat, reverse or otherwise ameliorate one or more processes or symptoms of a<br>
disease or physical disorder; and the like.<br>
[00152]	In additional embodiments, the conjugates and compositions of the<br>
invention can be used in industrial cell culture, due to the unexpectedly high<br>
potencies of the bioactive components of the conjugates that are obtained as a<br>
result of the combined effects of substantial retention of their bioactivity and<br>
increased duration of action even under the conditions of industrial use. These<br><br>
unexpectedly high potencies of the present conjugates can lead to unusually<br>
high biomass production, unusually high levels of expression of recombinant<br>
proteins, and other improvements in efficiencies of bioprocessing.<br>
C. Dose Regimens<br>
[00153]	The conjugates, complexes or compositions of the invention can be<br>
administered in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo to cells, tissues, organs or organisms to<br>
deliver thereto one or more bioactive components (i.e., one or more cytokines<br>
or antagonists thereof). One of ordinary skill will appreciate that effective<br>
amounts of a given active compound, conjugate, complex or composition can<br>
be determined empirically and may be employed in pure form or, where such<br>
forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable formulation or prodrug form. The<br>
compounds, conjugates, complexes or compositions of the invention may be<br>
administered to an animal (including a mammal, such as a human) patient in<br>
need thereof as veterinary or pharmaceutical compositions in combination<br>
with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The therapeutically<br>
effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of<br>
factors including the type and degree of the cellular response to be achieved;<br>
the identity and/or activity of the specific compound(s), conjugate(s),<br>
complex(es) or composition(s) employed; the age, body weight or surface<br>
area, general health, gender and diet of the patient; the time of administration,<br>
route of administration, and rate of excretion of the active compound(s); the<br>
duration of the treatment; other drugs used in combination or coincidental with<br>
the specific compound(s), conjugate(s), complex(es) or composition(s); and<br>
like factors that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical<br>
and medical arts. For example, it is well within the ordinary skill of the art to<br>
start doses of a given compound, conjugate, complex or composition of the<br>
invention at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic<br>
effect and to gradually increase the dosages until the desired effect is<br>
achieved.<br><br>
[00154]	Dose regimens may also be arranged in a patient-specific manner to<br>
provide a predetermined concentration of a given active compound in the<br>
blood, as determined by techniques accepted and routine in the art, e.g. size-<br>
exclusion, ion-exchange or reversed-phase high performance liquid<br>
chromatography ("HPLC"), bioassays or immunoassays. Thus, patient dose<br>
regimens may be adjusted to achieve relatively constant blood levels, as<br>
measured by HPLC or immunoassays, according to methods that are routine<br>
and familiar to those of ordinary skill in the medical, pharmaceutical and/or<br>
pharmacological arts.<br>
D. Diagnostic and Therapeutic Uses<br>
[00155]	A diagnostic use of a conjugate of the invention might be for locating<br>
cells or tissues having unusually high binding capacity for the cytokine, e.g., a<br>
cancer, within the body of an animal, especially a human, by administration of<br>
a conjugate or composition of the invention, in which the conjugate (or one or<br>
more components, i.e., the bioactive component and/or the synthetic polymer)<br>
is labeled or comprises one or more detectable labels so as to enable detection,<br>
e.g., by optical, radiometric, fluorescent or resonant detection according to art-<br>
known methods. For example, the majority of non-small cell lung cancers<br>
express unusually high concentration of receptors for epidermal growth factor<br>
(Bunn, P.A., et al., (2002) Semin Oncol 29(Suppl 14):38-44). Hence, in<br>
another aspect of the invention, the conjugates and compositions of the<br>
invention may be used in diagnostic or therapeutic methods, for example in<br>
diagnosing, treating or preventing a variety of physical disorders in an animal,<br>
particularly a mammal such as a human, predisposed to or suffering from such<br>
a disorder. In such approaches, the goal of the therapy is to delay or prevent<br>
the development of the disorder, and/or to cure, induce a remission or maintain<br>
a remission of the disorder, and/or to decrease or minimize the side effects of<br>
other therapeutic regimens.<br>
[00156]	Hence, the conjugates, complexes and compositions of the present<br>
invention may be used for protection, suppression or treatment of physical<br><br>
disorders, such as infections or diseases. The term "protection" from a<br>
physical disorder, as used herein, encompasses "prevention," "suppression"<br>
and "treatment." "Prevention" involves the administration of a complex or<br>
composition of the invention prior to the induction of the disease or physical<br>
disorder, while "suppression" involves the administration of the conjugate or<br>
composition prior to the clinical appearance of the disease; hence,<br>
"prevention" and "suppression" of a physical disorder typically are undertaken<br>
in an animal that is predisposed to or susceptible to the disorder, but that is not<br>
yet suffering therefrom. "Treatment" of a physical disorder, however,<br>
involves administration of the therapeutic conjugate or composition of the<br>
invention after the appearance of the disease. It will be understood that in<br>
human and veterinary medicine, it is not always possible to distinguish<br>
between "preventing" and "suppressing" a physical disorder. In many cases,<br>
the ultimate inductive event or events may be unknown or latent, and neither<br>
the patient nor the physician may be aware of the inductive event until well<br>
after its occurrence. Therefore, it is common to use the term "prophylaxis," as<br>
distinct from "treatment," to encompass both "preventing" and "suppressing"<br>
as defined herein. The term "protection," used in accordance with the<br>
methods of the present invention, therefore is meant to include "prophylaxis."<br>
Methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise one or more<br>
steps that allow the clinician 1o achieve the above-described therapeutic goals.<br>
One such method of the invention may comprise, for example: (a) identifying<br>
an animal (preferably a mammal, such as a human) suffering from or<br>
predisposed to a physical disorder; and (b) administering to the animal an<br>
effective amount of one or more of the conjugates, complexes or compositions<br>
of the present invention as described herein, such that the administration of the<br>
conjugate, complex or composition prevents, delays or diagnoses the<br>
development of, or cures or induces remission of, the physical disorder in the<br>
animal.<br>
[00157]	As used herein, an animal that is "predisposed to" a physical disorder<br>
is defined as an animal that does not exhibit a plurality of overt physical<br><br>
symptoms of the disorder but that is genetically, physiologically or otherwise<br>
at risk for developing the disorder. In the present methods, the identification<br>
of an animal (such as a mammal, including a human) that is predisposed to, at<br>
risk for, or suffering from a given physical disorder may be accomplished<br>
according to standard art-known methods that will be familiar to the ordinarily<br>
skilled clinician, including, for example, radiological assays, biochemical<br>
assays (e.g., assays of the relative levels of particular peptides, proteins,<br>
electrolytes, etc., in a sample obtained from an animal), surgical methods,<br>
genetic screening, family history, physical palpation, pathological or<br>
histological tests {e.g-, microscopic evaluation of tissue or bodily fluid<br>
samples or smears, immunological assays, etc.), testing of bodily fluids (e.g.,<br>
blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, semen and the like),<br>
imaging, (e.g., radiologic, fluorescent, optical, resonant (e.g., using nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance ("NMR") or electron spin resonance ("ESR")), etc. Once<br>
an animal has been identified by one or more such methods, the animal may<br>
be aggressively and/or proactively treated to prevent, suppress, delay or cure<br>
the physical disorder.<br>
[00158]	Physical disorders that can be prevented, diagnosed or treated with the<br>
conjugates, complexes, compositions and methods of the present invention<br>
include any physical disorders for which the bioactive component (typically,<br>
the cytokine or antagonist thereof) of the conjugates or compositions may be<br>
used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment. Such disorders include, but are<br>
not limited to, a variety of cancers (e.g., breast cancers, uterine cancers,<br>
ovarian cancers, prostate cancers, testicular cancers, leukemias, lymphomas,<br>
lung cancers, neurological cancers, skin cancers, head and neck cancers, bone<br>
cancers, colon and other gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatic cancers, bladder<br>
cancers, kidney cancers and other carcinomas, sarcomas, adenomas and<br>
myelomas); iatrogenic diseases; infectious diseases (e.g., bacterial diseases,<br>
fungal diseases, viral diseases (including hepatitis, diseases caused by<br>
cardiotropic viruses, HIV/AIDS, and the like), parasitic diseases, and the like);<br>
genetic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular<br><br>
dystrophy, Gaucher's disease, Pompe's disease, severe combined<br>
immunodeficiency disorder, dwarfism and the like), anemia, neutropenia,<br>
thrombocytopenia, hemophilia and other blood disorders; neurodegenerative<br>
disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis ("MS," including but not limited to<br>
relapsing-remitting MS, primary progressive MS, secondary progressive MS,<br>
and the like), Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Alzheimer's disease, and the like);<br>
enzymatic disorders (e.g., gout, uremia, hypercholesterolemia, and the like);<br>
disorders of uncertain or multifocal etiology (e.g., cardiovascular disease,<br>
hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease and the like); autoimmune<br>
disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,<br>
and the like) and other disorders of medical importance that will be readily<br>
familiar to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The conjugates, complexes,<br>
compositions and methods of the present invention may also be used in the<br>
prevention of disease progression, such as in chemoprevention or" the<br>
progression of a premalignant lesion to a malignant lesion.<br>
[00159)	The therapeutic methods of the invention thus use one or more<br>
conjugates, complexes or compositions of the invention, or one or more of the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, that may be administered to an<br>
animal in need thereof by a variety of routes of administration, including<br>
orally, rectally, parenterally (including intravenously, intra-arterially,<br>
intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intracisternally, subcutaneously and intra-<br>
articular injection and infusion), intrasystemically, vaginally, intraperitoneally,<br>
topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), buccally, as<br>
an oral or nasal spray or by inhalation. By the invention, an effective amount<br>
of the conjugates, complexes or compositions can be administered in vitro, ex<br>
vivo or in vivo to cells or to animals suffering from or predisposed to a<br>
particular disorder, thereby preventing, delaying, diagnosing or treating the<br>
disorder in the animal. As used herein, "an effective amount of a conjugate<br>
(or complex or composition)" refers to an amount such that the conjugate (or<br>
complex or composition) carries out the biological activity of the bioactive<br>
component (i.e., the cytokine or antagonist thereof) of the conjugate, complex<br><br>
or composition, thereby preventing, delaying, diagnosing, treating or curing<br>
the physical disorder in the animal to which the conjugate, complex or<br>
composition of the invention has been administered- One of ordinary skill will<br>
appreciate that effective amounts of the conjugates, complexes or<br>
compositions of the invention can be determined empirically, according to<br>
standard methods well-known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical<br>
and medical arts; see, e.g., Beers, M.H., et al., eds. (1999) Merck Manual of<br>
Diagnosis &amp; Therapy, 17th edition, Merck and Co., Rahway, NJ; Hardman,<br>
J.G., et al., eds. (2001) Goodman and Gilman 's The Pharmacological Basis of<br>
Therapeutics, 10th edition, McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New<br>
York; Speight, T.M., et al., eds. (1997) Avery's Drug Treatment, 4th edition,<br>
Adis International, Auckland, New Zealand; Katzung, B.G. (2000) Basic &amp;<br>
Clinical Pharmacology, 8th edition, Lange Medical Books/McGraw-Hill, New<br>
York; which references and references cited therein are incorporated entirely<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[00160]	It will be understood that, when administered to a human patient, the<br>
total daily, weekly or monthly dosage of the conjugates, complexes and<br>
compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending<br>
physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. For example,<br>
satisfactory results are obtained by administration of certain of the conjugates,<br>
complexes or compositions of the invention at appropriate dosages depending<br>
on the specific bioactive compound used, which dosages will be readily<br>
familiar to the ordinarily skilled artisan or which may be readily determined<br>
empirically using only routine experimentation. According to this aspect of<br>
the invention, the conjugates, complexes or compositions can be administered<br>
once or, in divided doses, e.g., once or twice per day, or once or twice per<br>
week, or once or twice per month, etc. Appropriate dose regimens for various<br>
modes of administration (e.g., parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intra-<br>
ocular, intranasal, etc.) can also be readily determined empirically, using only<br>
routine experimentation, or will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled<br><br>
artisan, depending on the identity of the bioactive component (i.e., the<br>
cytokine or antagonist thereof) of the conjugate, complex or composition.<br>
[00161]	In additional applications, the conjugates, complexes and compositions<br>
of the invention may be used to specifically target a diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
agent to a cell, tissue, organ or organism that expresses a receptor for, binds,<br>
incorporates or otherwise can take up, the bioactive component (i.e., the<br>
cytokine or antagonist thereof) of the conjugate, complex or composition.<br>
Methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise, for example,<br>
contacting the cell, tissue, organ or organism with one or more conjugates,<br>
complexes or compositions of the invention, which additionally comprise one<br>
or more diagnostic or therapeutic agents, such that the conjugate, complex or<br>
composition is bound to or taken up by the cell, tissue, organ or organism,<br>
thereby delivering the diagnostic or therapeutic agent to the cell, tissue, organ<br>
or organism. The diagnostic or therapeutic agent used in accordance with this<br>
aspect of the invention may be, but is not limited to, at least one agent selected<br>
from a nucleic acid, an organic compound, a protein or peptide, an antibody,<br>
an enzyme, a glycoprotein, a lipoprotein, an element, a lipid, a saccharide, an<br>
isotope, a carbohydrate, an imaging agent, a detectable probe, or any<br>
combination thereof, which may be detectably labeled as described herein. A<br>
therapeutic agent used in this aspect of the present invention may have a<br>
therapeutic effect on the target cell (or tissue, organ or organism), the effect<br>
being selected from, but not limited to, correcting a defective gene or protein,<br>
a drug action, a toxic effect, a growth stimulating effect, a growth inhibiting<br>
effect, a metabolic effect, a catabolic affect, an anabolic effect, an antiviral<br>
effect, an antifungal effect, an antibacterial effect, a hormonal effect, a<br>
neurohumoral effect, a cell differentiation stimulatory effect, a cell<br>
differentiation inhibitory effect, a neuromodulatory effect, an anti-neoplastic<br>
effect, an anti-tumor effect, an insulin stimulating or inhibiting effect, a bone<br>
marrow stimulating effect, a pluripotent stem cell stimulating effect, an<br>
immune system stimulating effect, and any other known therapeutic effect that<br>
may be provided by a therapeutic agent delivered to a cell (or tissue, organ or<br><br>
organism) via a delivery system according to this aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[00162]	Such additional therapeutic agents may be selected from, but are not<br>
limited to, known and new compounds and compositions including autibiotics,<br>
steroids, cytotoxic agents, vasoactive drugs, antibodies and other therapeutic<br>
agents. Non-limiting examples of such agents include antibiotics and other<br>
drugs used in the treatment of bacterial shock, such as gentamycin,<br>
tobramycin, nafcillin, parenteral cephalosporins, etc.; adrenal corticosteroids<br>
and analogs thereof, such as dexamethasone, mitigate the cellular injury<br>
caused by endotoxins; vasoactive drugs, such as an alpha adrenergic receptor<br>
blocking agent (e.g., phenoxybenzamine), a beta adrenergic receptor agonist<br>
(e.g., isoproterenol), and dopamine.<br>
[00163]	The conjugates, complexes and compositions of the invention may also<br>
be used for diagnosis of disease and to monitor therapeutic response. In<br>
certain such methods, the conjugates, complexes or compositions of the<br>
invention may comprise one or more detectable labels (such as those described<br>
elsewhere herein). In specific such methods, these detectably labeled<br>
conjugates, complexes or compositions of the invention may be used to detect<br>
cells, tissues, organs or organisms expressing receptors for, or otherwise<br>
taking up, the bioactive component (i.e., cytokine or antagonist thereof) of the<br>
conjugates, complexes or compositions. In one example of such a method, the<br>
cell, tissue, organ or organism is contacted with one or more of the conjugates,<br>
complexes or compositions of the invention under conditions that favor the<br>
binding or uptake of the conjugate by the cell, tissue or organism (e.g., by<br>
binding of the conjugate to a cell-surface receptor or by piriocytosis or<br>
diffusion of the conjugate into the cell), and then detecting the conjugate<br>
bound to or incorporated into the cell using detection means specific to the<br>
label used (e.g., fluorescence detection for fluorescently labeled conjugates;<br>
magnetic resonance imaging for magnetically labeled conjugates;<br>
radioimaging for radiolabeled conjugates; etc.). Other uses of such detectably<br>
labeled conjugates may include, for example, imaging a cell, tissue, organ or<br><br>
organism, or the internal structure of an animal (including a human), by<br>
administering an effective amount of a labeled form of one or more of the<br>
conjugates of the invention and measuring detectable radiation associated with<br>
the cell, tissue, organ or organism (or animal). Methods of detecting various<br>
types of labels and their uses in diagnostic and therapeutic imaging are well<br>
known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, and are described elsewhere herein.<br>
[00164]	In another aspect, the conjugates and compositions of the invention<br>
may be used in methods to modulate the concentration or activity of a specific<br>
receptor for the bioactive component of the conjugate on the surface of a cell<br>
that expresses such a receptor. By "modulating" the activity of a given<br>
receptor is meant that the conjugate, upon binding to the receptor, either<br>
activates or inhibits the physiological activity (e.g., the intracellular signaling<br>
cascade) mediated through that receptor. While not intending to be bound by<br>
any particular mechanistic explanation for the regulatory activity of the<br>
conjugates of the present invention, such conjugates can antagonize the<br>
physiological activity of a cellular receptor by binding to the receptor via the<br>
bioactive component of the conjugate, thereby blocking the binding of the<br>
natural agonist (e.g., the unconjugated bioactive component) and preventing<br>
activation of the receptor by the natural agonist, while not inducing a<br>
substantial activation of the physiological activity of the receptor itself.<br>
Methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise one or more<br>
steps, for example contacting the cell (which may be done in vitro or in vivo)<br>
with one or more of the conjugates of the invention, under conditions such that<br>
the conjugate (i.e., the bioactive component portion of the conjugate) binds to<br>
a receptor for the bioactive component on the cell surface but does not<br>
substantially activate the receptor. Such methods will be useful in a variety of<br>
diagnostic, and therapeutic applications, as the ordinarily skilled artisan will<br>
readily appreciate.<br><br>
Kits<br>
[00165]	The invention also provides kits comprising the conjugates and/or<br>
compositions of the invention. Such kits typically comprise a carrier, such as<br>
a box, carton, tube or the like, having in close confinement therein one or<br>
more containers, such as vials, tubes, ampoules, bottles, syringes and the like,<br>
wherein a first container contains one or more of the conjugates and/or<br>
compositions of the present invention. The kits encompassed by this aspect of<br>
the present invention may further comprise one or more additional<br>
components (e.g., reagents and compounds) necessary for carrying out one or<br>
more particular applications of the conjugates and compositions of the present<br>
invention, such as one or more components useful for the diagnosis, treatment<br>
or prevention of a particular disease or physical disorder (e.g., one or more<br>
additional therapeutic compounds or compositions, one or more diagnostic<br>
reagents, one or more carriers or excipients, and the like), one or more<br>
additional conjugates or compositions of the invention, and the like.<br>
[00166]	It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant arts<br>
that other suitable modifications and adaptations to the methods and<br>
applications described herein may be made without departing from the scope<br>
of the invention or any embodiment thereof. Having now described the<br>
present invention in detail, the same will be more clearly understood by<br>
reference to the following examples, which are included herewith for purposes<br>
of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: PEG-Interferon-alpha Conjugates<br>
[00167]	Interferon-alpha is a commercially important medicinal protein with a<br>
world market in the year 2001 exceeding U.S. $2 billion, primarily for the<br>
treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus ("HCV") infections. In the<br>
United States, between three and four million people are infected with chronic<br><br>
hepatitis C and about 10,000 HCV-related deaths occur each year (Chander,<br>
G., et al., (2002) Hepatology 36:5135-5144). In attempting to improve the<br>
usefulness of IFN-alpha, both of the companies that are primarily responsible<br>
for its development and marketing (Schering-Plough Corp. and F. Hoffrnann-<br>
La Roche AG) have developed and commercially launched conjugates of IFN-<br>
alpha with monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol) or "mPEG." In each case,<br>
mPEG is linked to each molecule of interferon-alpha at only one point of<br>
attachment. In each case, the product contains a mixture of positional isomers<br>
with markedly reduced receptor-binding activity, compared to the unmodified<br>
interferon. In each case, the increased bioavailability and duration of action of<br>
the conjugate in vivo more than compensates for the decreased bioactivity in<br>
vitro that results from PEG conjugation, as measured by improved clinical<br>
effectiveness of one injection of the conjugate per week, compared to three<br>
injections of the unmodified protein per week, for the treatment of chronic<br>
infection with HCV (Manns, M.P., et al., (2№\)Lancet 358:958-965).<br>
[00168]	In the PEG-interferon-alpha-2a conjugate of F. Hoffmann-La Roche,<br>
two strands of 20-kDa mPEG are coupled to a single lysine linker (so-called<br>
"branched PEG") that is linked primarily to one of Lys 31, Lys 121, Lys 131<br>
or Lys 134 (Bailon, P., et al., supra), all of which are within or adjacent to a<br>
receptor-binding domain of interferon-alpha-2a (see Binding Site 1 in<br>
Figure la).<br>
[00169]	In the PEG-mterferon-alpha-2b conjugate of Schering-Plough Corp., a<br>
single strand of 12-kDa mPEG is coupled predominantly to a histidine residue<br>
at position 34 (His 34; Wylie, D.C., et al., supra; Gilbert, C.W., et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,042,822; Wang, Y.-S., et al., supra), which is in a region that is<br>
important for binding to a receptor (see Figure 1b). Other sites of PEG<br>
attachment in the product of Schering-Plough (Lys 121, Tyr 129 and Lys 131)<br>
are also seen to be in or near Binding Site 1 (Figure 1b).<br>
[00170]	In contrast to these two commercial products, the conjugate of the<br>
present invention has a single strand of water soluble, synthetic polymer,<br>
preferably PEG or mPEG, linked to the N-terminal amino acid residue, which<br><br>
is remote from the receptor-binding regions of the protein (see the spatial<br>
relationship between Cys-1 and the Binding Sites in Figures lc and Id),<br>
demonstrating that interferon-alpha is an "RN" cytokine. Figures 9 and 10<br>
show cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatograms, respectively, of an<br>
exemplary PEG-interferon-alpha conjugate of the present invention. The<br>
reaction mixture contained interferon-alpha-2b in which an additional<br>
methionine residue was present at the amino terminus, preceding Cys-1, which<br>
is the first residue of the natural sequence. The reactive PEG was 20-kDa<br>
PEG-aldehyde, which was present at a concentration of 0.2 mM. The<br>
reducing agent was sodium cyanoborohydride, at a final concentration of<br>
14 mM. Progress of the reaction was monitored periodically by size-exclusion<br>
chromatography during incubation at 4°C. Although IFN-alpha was<br>
sufficiently soluble to be PEGylated under the conditions described, other<br>
cytokines, e.g., IFN-beta, are less soluble and may need to be PEGylated in<br>
the presence of a surfactant, as described for IFN-alpha by C.W. Gilbert et at.,<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 5,711,944) and for interferons alpha and beta by R.B.<br>
Greenwald, et al., (U.S. Patent No. 5,738,846).<br>
[00171]	The cation-exchange column used for the fractionation shown in<br>
Figure 9 was ToyoPearl MD-G SP (1 x 6.8 cm; Tosoh Biosep, Montgomery-<br>
ville, PA), developed with a linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium<br>
acetate buffer, pH 4.6, at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/minute. The size-exclusion<br>
column used to obtain the data in Figure 10 was SUPERDEX® 200 (HR 10/30;<br>
Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), eluted at 0.5 mL/minute in 20 mM<br>
sodium acetate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.6. Other suitable ion-<br>
exchange and size-exclusion chromatographic media and fractionation<br>
conditions are known to those skilled in the art. Amino-terminal amino acid<br>
analysis by automated Edman degradation of the purified monoPEG-lFN-<br>
alpha-2b of this invention demonstrated that &gt;90% of the PEG was attached to<br>
the N-tenninal residue. The analysis was performed by Commonwealth<br>
Biotechnologies, Inc. (Richmond, VA).<br><br>
Example 2: PEG-Interleukin-2 Conjugates<br>
[00172]	InterIeukin-2 ("IL-2') is a cytokine that displays immunomodulatory<br>
activity against certain cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and malignant<br>
melanoma. However, clinical efficacy is poor, with the result that only a small<br>
fraction of patients experience partial or complete responses (Weinreich,<br>
DM., et al., (2002) J Immunother 25:185-187). IL-2 has a short half-life in<br>
the bloodstream, which is implicated in its low rate of induction of remission<br>
in cancer patients. Attempts to make IL-2 more useful by random PEGylation<br>
of lysine residues have not been optimal (Chen, S.A., et al., (2000)<br>
J Pharmacol Exp Ther 293:248-259). Attempts to selectively attach PEG to<br>
IL-2 at its glycosylate site (Goodson, R.J., et al., supra) or at a non-essential<br>
cysteine (Cys 125) or to muteins of iL-2 containing cysteine between residues<br>
1 and 20 (Katre, N., et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,206,344) have not led to<br>
clinically useful products.<br>
[00173]	Figure 4 shows the distribution of lysine residues with respect to the<br>
receptor-binding regions of IL-2, showing that many of the surface-accessible<br>
lysine residues are in regions that are involved in receptor binding. In fact,<br>
Lys-35 and Lys-43 have been identified as required for interaction with the<br>
alpha-receptor for EL-2, suggesting a mechanism for the inactivation of IL-2<br>
by PEGylation of lysine residues. Figure 4 also shows that the N-termvnai<br>
region of IL-2 is remote from the receptor-binding regions of the protein,<br>
demonstrating that IL-2 has the structure of an "RN" cytokine. Our<br>
conclusion that IL-2 is an "RN" cytokine is compatible with the observations<br>
of H. Sato, et al., ((2000) Bioconjug Chem 17:502-509), who employed<br>
enzymatic transghitamination to couple one or two strands of 10-kDa mPEG<br>
to one or two of the glutamine residues ("Q") in the sequence AQQIVM that<br>
those authors introduced into an IL-2 mutein as an N-terminal extension. Sato<br>
et al. reported that their conjugate that was PEGylated near the amino<br>
terminus by transglutamination of their mutein retained more bioactivity than<br>
a conjugate prepared by random PEGylation of lysines in the IL-2 mutein. For<br><br>
a review of analogous approaches to PEGylation of other proteins, see Sato,<br>
H., (2002) supra. Based on the spatial separation of the amino terminus of<br>
IL-2 from the receptor-binding regions of the protein, as shown in Figure 4,<br>
one can understand that the glycosylation site at residue Thr-3 (not shown)<br>
renders IL-2 an "RG" receptor-binding protein, as defined herein. Thus, IL-2<br>
is both an RN cytokine and an RG cytokine.<br>
[00174]	Figures 11 and 12 show cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromato-<br>
grams, respectively, of an exemplary PEG-IL-2 conjugate of the present<br>
invention, which was PEGylated by N-terminally selective, reductive<br>
alkylation, as in Example 1. The conditions used for fractionation were the<br>
same as those described for Figures 9 and 10, respectively. Figure 13 shows a<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the same conjugate in the<br>
presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate ("SDS-PAGE"), before and after its<br>
purification by ion-exchange chromatography, as shown in Figure 11. The gel<br>
contained a gradient of 4-12% total acrylamide in Bis-Tris buffer (Catalog #<br>
NP0335, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The samples, each containing about 1-<br>
2 mcg protein, were heated at 90°C for 10 minutes prior to analysis. The gel<br>
was run at a constant voltage of 117-120 for about 135 minutes, with cooling.<br>
One portion of the gel was stained with Sypro® Ruby protein gel stain<br>
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OP.) and the other portion was stained for PEG by<br>
an adaptation of the methods of C.E. Childs ((1975) Microchem J 20:190-192)<br>
and B. Skoog ((1979) Vox Sang J7:345-349). Amino-terminal amino acid<br>
analysis by automated Edman degradation of the purified monoPEG-IL-2 in<br>
each of the two peaks in Figure 11 demonstrated that &gt;90% of the PEG was<br>
attached to the N-terminal residue. The analysis was performed by<br>
Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. (Richmond, VA).<br>
Example 3: Members and Non-members of the Class of "RN"<br>
Receptor-Binding Proteins<br>
[00175]	Figures 2, 3 and 5-8 show the surface distributions of lysine residues of<br>
the receptor-binding proteins interferon-beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony-<br>
stimulating factor ("GM-CSF"), epidermal growth factor ("EGF"), basic<br><br>
fibroblast growth factor ("bFGF," which is also known in the art as "FGF-2"),<br>
insulin-like growth factor-1("IGF-1") and intetferon-gamma ("IFN-gamma")<br>
relative to their receptor-binding regions, as well as showing which of these<br>
proteins are "RN" cytokines and growth factors. In addition, Figure 2 shows<br>
that interferon-beta is an "RG" cytokine.<br>
[00176]	Figure 2 shows lysine residues distributed throughout the regions of<br>
Binding Site 1 and Binding Site 2 of interferon-beta, whereas the amino<br>
terminus of the polypeptide chain is remote from the receptor-binding regions<br>
of the protein, demonstrating that IFN-beta is an RN cytokine.<br>
[00177]	Figure 3 shows lysine residues distributed throughout the regions of<br>
Binding Site 1, which binds the alpha receptor, and Binding Site 2, which<br>
binds the beta receptor, of GM-CSF, whereas the amino terminus, of the<br>
polypeptide chain is remote from the receptor-binding regions of the protein,<br>
demonstrating that GM-CSF is an RN cytokine.<br>
[00178]	Figure 5 shows lysine residues distributed along the polypeptide chain<br>
of epidermal growth factor ("EGF"), including lysine residues that are in or<br>
near receptor-binding regions of the protein, whereas the amino terminus of<br>
the polypeptide chain is more remote from the receptor-binding regions of the<br>
protein.<br>
[00179]	Figure 6 shows that several lysine residues of basic fibroblast growth<br>
factor ("bFGF") are implicated, in binding to receptors or to heparin, both of<br>
which are necessary for signal transduction by bFGF (Schlessinger, J., et al.,<br>
supra). The amino terminus of bFGF is remote from the heparin-binding<br>
region of bFGF and may be sufficiently remote from receptor binding sites to<br>
render bFGF an RN growth factor.<br>
[00180]	Figure 7 shows that several lysine residues of insulin-like growth<br>
factor-1 ("IGF-1") are within or adjacent to the receptor-binding regions of the<br>
polypeptide, whereas the amino terminus of IGF-1 is remote from the<br>
receptor-binding domains, demonstrating that IGF-1 is an RN growth factor.<br>
[00181]	Figure 8 shows that interferon-gamma ("IFN-gamma") exists as a<br>
homodimer in which the two polypeptide chains have extensive interactions.<br><br>
Several lysine residues of each polypeptide are adjacent to amino acid residues<br>
of IFN-gamma that have been implicated in binding to receptors or are in the<br>
dimerization interface. The "ball-and-stick" format of amino acid residue<br>
Gln-1 is intended to reflect the evidence for the functional importance of this<br>
N-terminal residue. (The crystal structure on which this figure is based<br>
included an additional methionine residue, labeled "Met 0," that it is not<br>
present in the natural protein.) Since the N-terminal residues of IFN-gamma<br>
are remote from the dimerization interface, N-terminal PEGylation could<br>
avoid the inhibitory effects of lysine PEGylation on homodimerization of IFN-<br>
gamma. On the other hand, the interactions of the dimer with its receptors are<br>
likely to be inhibited by coupling polymers to the amino terminus, particularly<br>
when long strands of polymer are attached.<br>
[00182]	IFN-gamma, IL-10 and stem cell factor are examples of cytokines that<br>
function as homodimers (Walter, M.R., et al., supra; Josephson, K.., et al.,<br>
(2000) J Biol Chem 275:13552-13557; McNiece, I.K., et al., supra). Dimer-<br>
ization of receptor-binding proteins presents special issues for the<br>
characterization of their N-terminally monoPEGylated conjugates, since<br>
different possible molecular structures can be present in preparations of<br>
conjugates with similar or identical size and shape. For example, a dimer that<br>
consists of one diPEGylated monomer and one unPEGylated monomer<br>
(PEG2-protein1 + protein1) would be difficult or impossible to distinguish<br>
from a dimer that consist of two N-terminally PEGylated monomers (PEG1-<br>
protein1)2 by most size based analyses of the dimeric conjugate (e.g., size-<br>
exclusion chromatography or evaluation of the sedimentation coefficient, light<br>
scattering or diffusion coefficient), yet the receptor-binding potency of these<br>
two conjugates, each containing an average of one PEG per protein monomer,<br>
might be quite different.<br>
[00183]	For the long-chain beta-sheet receptor-binding proteins that form<br>
homotrimers, e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha ("TNF-alpha"), the number of<br>
isomers of PEG3-protein3 trimers is even larger than for the receptor-binding<br>
proteins that occur in solution as homodimers. Since chemical modification of<br><br>
TNF close to the amino terminus has been shown to inactivate this cytokine<br>
(Utsumi, T., et al., (1992) Mol Immunol 29:77-81), TNF-alpha is not likely to<br>
retain substantial activity when PEGylated with reagents and under conditions<br>
that are selective for the N-terminal residue.<br>
[00184]	For the characterization of conjugates of cytokines that function as<br>
oligomers, a combination of analytical methods is required. Amino-terminal<br>
sequence analysis can detect the presence of monomers with free N-terminal<br>
alpha amino groups and electrophoretic analysis of dissociated monomers<br>
(e.g. SDS-PAGE or capillary electrophoresis) can reveal the presence of<br>
unPEGylated and multiply-PEGylated monomers of the receptor-binding<br>
proteins. Without such evidence, the synthesis of monoPEGylated conjugates<br>
of such homodimer- and homotrimer-forming proteins cannot be demonstrated<br>
unequivocally.<br>
[00185]	These examples, especially as graphically illustrated by Figures 1-8,<br>
provide a readily visualized basis for understanding the potential role of steric<br>
hindrance of protein-receptor interactions by PEGylation of receptor-binding<br>
proteins within or adjacent to receptor-binding domains of these bioactive<br>
components. The large volume that is occupied by the highly extended and<br>
flexible PEG strands (see Figure 1d) also would sterically hinder the<br>
association of monomers of certain receptor-binding proteins into functional<br>
homodimers or homotrimers, if the PEG were coupled in regions that are<br>
reported to be required for interactions between the monomers. Thus, the<br>
targeting of PEGylation to sites that are remote from receptor-binding regions<br>
of receptor-binding proteins decreases the likelihood that PEGylation will<br>
interfere with the intermolecular interactions that are required for their<br>
function. By proceeding in accordance with the method of this invention,<br>
more of the benefits that are expected from PEGylation of receptor-binding<br>
proteins can be realized. The resulting conjugates combine the expected<br>
benefits of improved solubility, increased bioavailability, greater stability and<br>
decreased immunogenicity with an unexpectedly high retention of bioactivity.<br><br>
Example 4: PEGylation of Interferon--1b by Reductive Alkylation<br>
[00186]	In one series of embodiments, conjugates of interferon--1b<br>
("IFN-β-1b;" SEQ ID NO:1) with monomethoxyPEG ("mPEG") were<br>
synthesized by reductive alkylation with 20-kDa or 30-kDa mPEG-aldehyde,<br>
using borane-pyridine complex as the reducing agent (Cabacungan, J.C, et al,<br>
supra). Interferon-β-1b, free of carrier proteins and at a concentration of<br>
about 1.9 mg/mL in a solution containing approximately 3 mg/mL SDS, was<br>
obtained from Chiron Corporation (Emeryville, CA). This protein is referred<br>
to as "BETASERON®" in the formulation that is marketed by Berlex<br>
Laboratories, a U.S. subsidiary of Schering AG, and as "BETAFERON®" in the<br>
formulation that is marketed directly by Schering. Borane-pyridine complex<br>
(Aldrich 17,975-2, Milwaukee, WI) was diluted to 450 mM borane in 60%<br>
(v/v) aqueous acetonitrile. 20-kDa mPEG H-propionaldehyde ("PEG-<br>
aldehyde;" NOF Corporation, Tokyo) was dissolved in 1 mM HCl at a<br>
concentration of 30 mg/mL. After dissolution, 0.1 niL of the PEG-aldehyde<br>
solution was added to 0.7 mL of IFN-β-1b solution and mixed. Addition of<br>
0.05 mL of 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.6, gave the reaction mixture a final<br>
pH of 5. To another reaction mixture containing 0.1 mL of PEG-aldehyde<br>
solution and 0.7 mL of IFN-P-lb solution, 0.05 mL of a mixture of 200 mM<br>
acetic acid, 200 mM Na2HPO4 and 68 mM NaOH was added to give a final<br>
pH of 6.4. To three 0.85-rnL aliquots of each of these mixtures, 0.1 mL of<br>
either water, 1.5 M NaCl or 10 mg/mL SDS was added. The diluted borane-<br>
pyridine complex was then added to each reaction mixture to give a final<br>
concentration of 23 mM borane. Each of the resultant reaction mixtures was<br>
divided into two tubes that were incubated for 2 days at either 4°C or room<br>
temperature. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by size-<br>
exclusion HPLC in 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.3, containing 0.3 mg/mL<br>
SDS, at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min on a Superose™ 12 column (Amersham<br>
Biosciences HR 10/30; Piscataway, NJ). The absorbance of the eluate was<br>
monitored at 214 ran. With an input ratio of approximately 2 moles of PEG<br><br>
per mole of protein, the predominant species was monoPEGylated interferon-<br>
β-1b (PEG-EFN-β-1b). the yield of PEG1-IFN-β-1b was between 65% and<br>
72% under all of the tested incubation conditions (at pH 5 or pH 6.4; at 4°C or<br>
room temperature; in the presence or absence of NaCl or additional SDS).<br>
[00187]	In other experiments,. NaBEH3CN was used as the reducing agent and<br>
the samples were analyzed by size-exclusion HPLC on a Superdex 200 HR<br>
30/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mM acetate, 150 mM NaCl,<br>
pH 4.6, containing 1 mg/mL SDS, at a flow rate of 0.5mL/min. The results of<br>
one such experiment are shown in Figure 14. The input concentrations of<br>
20-kDa mPEG were approximately 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM and 0.4 mM (designated<br>
"1x," "2x" and "4x" in Figure 14, respectively) and the reaction mixtures were<br>
incubated at room temperature for 3 days. The control sample (bottom<br>
tracing) was incubated with only the reducing agent. When the same samples<br>
were chromatographed under the same conditions except for the omission of<br>
SDS from the elution buffer, the unPEGylated EFN-β-1b was not detected in<br>
the eluate. Similar results were obtained when 30-fcDa mPEG<br>
n-propionaldehyde was substituted for 20-kDa mPEG n-propionaldehyde in<br>
the methods of this Example 4. Similar results were also obtained when<br>
10-kDa mPEG n-propionaldehyde was substituted for 20-kDa mPEG<br>
n-propionaldehyde. Alternatively, mPEG-acetaldehydes or b'ltyraldehydes<br>
can be employed. Selective N-terminal PEGylation of IFN-beta by the<br>
method of this example produces conjugates of enhanced bioactivity whether<br>
the N-terminal amino acid is serine, as in IFN-β-1b, methionine, as in<br>
IFN-β-1a, or another amino acid.<br>
Example 5: Determination of the Extent of N-terminal PEGylation by<br>
Oxidative Cleavage<br>
[00188]	The fraction of PEG coupled to the alpha amino group of the<br>
N-terminal serine residue of a protein, rather than the epsilon amino groups of<br>
accessible lysine residues, was assessed by a novel method involving<br>
oxidative cleavage of the alkylated serine residue. A reaction mixture in<br><br>
which PEG1-IFN-β-1b was the predominant species (approximately 70% of<br>
the total protein) was dialyzed against 1 mg/mL SDS in acetate buffer, pH 4.6.<br>
The pH was then adjusted to 7.4 by the addition of 10 mM Na3PO4. Portions<br>
of this solution were incubated at 4°C for up to 20 hours in the absence of<br>
sodium periodate or with final concentrations of 0.1 through 10 mM NaIO4.<br>
Following incubation, the reaction mixtures were chromatographed on a<br>
Superose™6 column in 10 mM acetate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH4.6,<br>
containing 1 mg/mL SDS. Similar results with respect to the recovery of<br>
monoPEGylated IFN-β-1b were obtained on a Superose 12 column, with the<br>
advantage that the Superose 12 column permitted resolution of the unmodified<br>
IFN-β-lb from the "salt peak." A graph of the areas under the peaks of<br>
absorbance at 214 nm corresponding to PEG1-IFN-β-1b versus periodate<br>
concentration showed a steep decrease in the area up to about 1 mM periodate<br>
and a nearly constant level of residual PEG1-IFN-β-1b between about 1 mM<br>
and 10 mM periodate. Similar analyses after treatment with ≥3 mM periodate<br>
for 0.2, 2 or 7 hours indicated that the oxidative cleavage of the serine-linked<br>
PEG was substantially complete within 2 hours. The residual PEG conjugates<br>
contained only lysine-linked PEG, which linkage was stable to treatment with<br>
up to at least 10 mM periodate. The fraction of the conjugates that survived<br>
oxidation with periodate was similar to the fraction estimated by Edman<br>
degradation to be PEGylated at sites other than the amino terminal. Similar<br>
results are obtained when the distribution of conjugates that are stable or<br>
unstable to the oxidative procedures described in this example is assessed by a<br>
variety of analytical methods, including, but not limited to reversed phase<br>
chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, ultracentri-<br>
fugation, mass spectroscopy, light scattering or ultrafiltration.<br>
[00189]	Interferon-β-1b was coupled to 20-kDa PEG-aldehyde with borane-<br>
pyridine complex as the reducing agent under various conditions, as described<br>
in Example 4. The monoPEGylated IFN-β-1b was purified by<br>
chromatography on a Superose 12 column in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,<br>
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mg/mL SDS, at a flow rate of<br><br>
0.5 mL/min. Portions of the purified PEG1-EFN-β-1b conjugates were<br>
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in the absence or presence of 3 mM<br>
sodium periodate. Figure 15 shows chromatograms of the untreated and<br>
oxidatively cleaved samples of PEG1-IFN-β-1b on a Superose 12 column in<br>
10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.3, containing 0.3 mg/mL SDS, run at<br>
0.5 mL/min. These data indicate that approximately 90% of the PEG in PEG1-<br>
IFN-β-1b synthesized at pH 6.4 was coupled to the N-terminal serine. This<br>
result was not altered significantly by performing the coupling after the<br>
addition of either 150 mM NaCl (lower curves) or 1 mg/mL SDS (upper<br>
curves) to the reaction mixtures or by performing the coupling reactions at<br>
pH 5 (results not shown). Similar results are obtained when<br>
monohydroxyPEG n-propionaldehydes are substituted for mPEG jz-propion-<br>
aldehydes or when PEG aldehydes other than n-propionaldehyde are<br>
employed. Likewise, the method of this example measures the extent of<br>
N-terminal reductively alkylated proteins other than IFN-β-1b, wherein such<br>
proteins have an N-terminal serine or threonine residue. Similarly, oxidative<br>
cleavage of polymers linked by reductive alkylation to N-terminal serine or<br>
threonine residues is achieved using periodates other than sodium periodate,<br>
including, but not limited to: sodium metaperiodate (referred to elsewhere<br>
herein and known in the art as sodium periodate), potassium metaperiodate,<br>
lithium metaperiodate, calcium periodate, barium periodate and periodic acid.<br>
[00190]	Polymer conjugates synthesized by reductive alkylation of other<br>
cytokines to which the method of this Example 5 are applicable include<br>
interleukin-1-alpha (Geoghegan, K.F., et al., supra) and megakaryocyte<br>
growth and development factor (Guerra, P.I., et al., supra).<br>
Example 6: Purification of Coujugates and Removal of Free PEG and<br>
SDS by Reversed Phase Chromatography<br>
[00191]	Reversed phase ("RP") chromatography was used by S. Hershenson<br>
et al. (U.S. Patent No. 4,894,330), to purify IFN-β-1b after its expression in<br>
bacterial cell culture. The present inventors adapted the methods of<br><br>
Hershenson et al. to separate the individual PEGylated species synthesized as<br>
described in Example 4 from the unmodified protein. This procedure also<br>
resolved the free PEG and most of the SDS from the protein peaks. Figure 16<br>
shows an analytical chromatogram on a Jupiter™ C4 300A column (15 cm x<br>
4.6 mm; Phenomenex; Torrance, CA) with a gradient of 20% acetonitrile plus<br>
0.04% trifluoroacetic acid to 80% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
One-tenth milliliter of the reaction mixture was loaded and 0.5 mL fractions<br>
were collected at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A peak of DFN-β-1b that was<br>
unmodified except by exposure to the PEGylation reagents ("Mock<br>
PEGylated") and peaks of PEG conjugates containing one or more strands of<br>
PEG per molecule of protein were detected by monitoring the absorbance at<br>
280 nm {solid curve). In this experiment, the column was maintained at 40°C.<br>
Qualitatively similar results, but with different retention times, were obtained<br>
by chromatography at room temperature.<br>
[00192]	The results of assays of SDS in the collected fractions are shown by<br>
the open triangles. A stock solution of the SDS assay reagent contained<br>
1 mg/mL of a carbocyanine dye, Stains-All (Sigma, # E-9379; 3,3'-diethyl-9-<br>
methyl-4,5,4',5'-dibenzothiacarbocyanine), in 50% (v/v) aqueous isopropanol<br>
(Rusconi, F., et al., (2001) Anal Biochem 295:31-37). The working reagent<br>
was prepared just before use by mixing 2 mL of the stock solution plus 2 mL<br>
of N,N-dirnethylforrnarnide and 41 mL of water. Addition of SDS to this<br>
reagent caused spectral changes that are specific to SDS and resulted in a<br>
decrease in the absorbance peak at 510-515 nm and the appearance of an<br>
absorbance peak at 439 nm. The changes in absorbance at 439 nm upon<br>
addition of 2 mcL of each fraction from the RP chromatography column to<br>
250 mcL of the working reagent in a 96-well plate were monitored in a<br>
SpectraMax 250 Plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
[00193]	The results of an assay for PEG in the collected fractions are shown by<br>
the filled circles in Figure 16. The PEG assay reagent was prepared<br>
immediately before use by mixing 1 volume of 20% (w/v) barium chloride in<br>
1 N HCl with 4 volumes of 4 mg/mL iodine in 1% (w/v) potassium iodide.<br><br>
From each fraction of the RP chromatography column (and the PEG<br>
standards), a 10 mcL aliquot was added to 90 mcL of water in the wells of a<br>
96-well plate, followed by 100 mcL of PEG assay reagent. After the samples<br>
and reagent were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes, the<br>
absorbance at 508 run was measured in a SpectraMax plate reader. The graphs<br>
in Figure 16 demonstrate that RP chromatography under these conditions<br>
separated the Mock PEGylated protein from conjugates containing one or<br>
more strands of 20-kDa PEG, while resolving the unbound PEG and SDS<br>
from the conjugates. Similar results were obtained with conjugates containing<br>
PEGs of other molecular weights (e.g., 10-kDa or 30-kDa PEG) and other<br>
acid-stable linkages between the PEG and the IFN-β-1b.<br>
Example 7: Chromatographic and Electrophoretic Analyses of Purified<br>
Fractions from Preparative Reversed Phase HPLC<br>
[00194]	Reversed phase chromatography under conditions similar to those<br>
described in Example 6 was performed on larger samples (0.3 or 0.5 mL) of<br>
PEGylation reaction mixtures on the same Jupiter C4 column with a modified<br>
gradient. When larger samples were loaded, resolution among the various<br>
forms of interferon (Mock PEGylated, PEGi-DFN-β-1b or conjugates with<br>
more than one strand of PEG) was not as clear as thai: shown in Figure 16.<br>
Nevertheless, fractions that were highly enriched either in Mock PEGylated or<br>
in monoPEGylated protein were obtained, as shown by rechromatography of<br>
small aliquots of the partially purified fractions on the same RP column<br>
(Figure 17). The chromatograms were analyzed using EZChrom Elite<br>
software (Scientific Software, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). From this analysis, the<br>
preparation shown in the upper curve (Fraction 53 from the preparative RP<br>
column) contained about 70-80% Mock PEGylated IFN-β-1b, while the<br>
preparation shown in the middle curve (Fraction 51) contained about 99%<br>
PEG1-IFN-β-1b. The bottom curve in Figure 17 shows a chromatogram of the<br>
reaction mixture from which the fractions were derived, in which about 19%<br>
of the absorbance was associated with the Mock PEGylated protein, about<br>
61% with the peak of PEG1-IFN, about 12% with the peak labeled PEG2-IFN,<br><br>
and 5-6% with forms that eluted earlier than PEG2-IFN. Qualitatively similar<br>
results are obtained when reversed phase columns from other manufacturers<br>
are used.<br>
[00195]	The same reaction mixture (analyzed by RP chromatography in<br>
Figure 17) and two fractions of PEG-interferon purified by RP<br>
chromatography were analyzed by polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis in the<br>
presence of SDS ("SDS-PAGE"). The results are shown in Figures 18 and 19.<br>
Replicate samples were incubated with a reducing agent (Invitrogen,<br>
#NP0004; Carlsbad, CA.) or without reducing agent for 10 minutes either at<br>
ambient temperature or at 102°C and electrophoresed for 140 minutes at<br>
120 V through a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, # NP0321B). The tracings<br>
shown in Figures 18 and 19 were from the samples that were neither reduced<br>
nor heated. The proteins in the gel were stained with SYPRO Ruby Stain<br>
(Molecular Probes # S-12000, Eugene, OR), illuminated at 302 nm and<br>
photographed using an Orange/Red visible light filter (Molecular Probes, #<br>
S-6655) (Figure 18). The digital images were analyzed using ID Imaging<br>
Analysis software from Kodak (Rochester, NY) The horizontal axis<br>
represents migration distance relative to the dye front (100 units) and the<br>
vertical axis represents the relative intensity of the fluorescent protein stain.<br>
The baseline values for the various lanes have been shifted vertically to clarify<br>
the presentation of the results. The bottom tracing represents a mixture of<br>
standard proteins (Mark12™, # LC5677 from Invitrogen), in which the peaks<br>
numbered 1 through 9 are identified as proteins having the following<br>
molecular weights (all in kDa): 200, 116, 97.1, 66.3, 55.4, 36.5, 31.0, 21.5<br>
and 14.4. The second tracing from the bottom shows the electrophoretic<br>
analysis of the reaction mixture. In this mixture, the percentages of protein<br>
stain associated with each form of IFN-β-1b were: 14% Mock PEGylated;<br>
64% PEG1-IFN; 20% PEG2-IFN and about 2% of forms larger than<br>
PEG2-IFN. The third tracing from the bottom shows a fraction from the RP<br>
chromatographic column that contained 33 + 1% PEG1-IFN; 64 ±1%<br>
PEG2-IFN and about 6% of forms larger than PEG2-IFN. The top curve shows<br><br>
a fraction containing 95 ± 1% PEGi-IFN, about 2% of Mock PEGylated IFN<br>
and about 2% of forms larger than PEG2-IFN. The percentages indicated<br>
above are the mean and standard deviation of results of four replicate analyses<br>
of each sample. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with PEGs of<br>
10kDa and 30kDa.<br>
[00196]	Figure 19 displays the results from SDS-PAGE analyses, as described<br>
for Figure 18, except the gel was stained for PEG using 20% (w/v) BaCl2 in<br>
1 N HCl combined with 4 volumes of 4 mg/mL I2 in 1% (w/v) KI. The bottom<br>
tracing represents a mixture of pre-stained standard proteins (SeeBlue<br>
Plus2™, Invitrogen # LC5625), in which the peaks numbered 1 through 9<br>
identify the proteins with the following apparent molecular weights (in kDa):<br>
204, 111, 68.8, 51.5, 40.2, 28.9, 20.7, 14.9 and c. 6. Quantitative analysis of<br>
the PEG-stained gel indicates that about 99% of the PEG in Fraction 51 from<br>
the RP column (top curve) is associated with PEG1-IFN, while the fraction<br>
enriched in the diPEG conjugate (second curve from top) contained 25 ± 1%<br>
of PEGi-IFN and about 3% of forms larger than PEG2-IFN, in addition to<br>
about 71% of PEG2-IFN. In estimating the relative quantities of the various<br>
forms of IFN-β-1b stained for PEG, the area under the PEG2-IFN peak was<br>
divided by 2. In the reaction mixture (second curve from bottom), about 50%<br>
of PEG stain was associated with unbound PEG, about 35% with PEGi-IFN,<br>
about 14% with PEG2-IFN and about 1% with forms larger than PEG2-IFN.<br>
Example 8: Selective N-terminal Oxidation of Inter feron-β-1b and<br>
Coupling to a Low Molecular Weight Carbazate<br>
[00197]	An alternative method of coupling mPEG to the amino terminus of<br>
IFN-β-1b was used to increase the apparent selectivity for this attachment site<br>
to about 100% from the value of about 90% obtained by reductive alkylation,<br>
as described in Examples 4 and 5. The first step in this method of PEGylation<br>
is based on a similar principle to the oxidative cleavage of reductively<br>
alkylated PEG-IFN-β-1b described in Example 5. This approach takes<br>
advantage of the unique sensitivity of an N-terminal serine or threonine<br>
residue to be cleaved to an aldehyde by periodate, as reported by H.B.F. Dixon<br><br>
(supra) and by K.F. Geoghegan et al., ((1992) Bioconjug Chem 3:138-146;<br>
Geoghegan, K.F., U.S. Patent No. 5,362,852; Drummond, R.J., et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,423,685). When the N-terminal serine residue of IFN-β-1b was<br>
maximally oxidized, e.g., after treatment with 3 mM NaIO4 for 2 hours at<br>
room temperature, the resulting peak of protein absorbance appeared broad<br>
upon preliminary size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column.<br>
Subsequent analysis on a Superose 12 column in 10mM acetate, 150mM<br>
NaCl, pH 4.6, containing 0.3 mg/mL SDS, clearly resolved the oxidized<br>
protein into two forms that were inferred to be monomers and dimers of the<br>
protein. The identities of these two peaks were confirmed by SDS-PAGE,<br>
performed as described in Example 7.<br>
[00198]	Analyses by reversed phase chromatography further documented the<br>
discovery that preferential oxidation of the N-terminal serine was achieved<br>
with minimal oxidation of at least one essential methionine residue. L.S. Lin<br>
et al., ((1996) Pharm Biotechnol .9:275-301) and L.Lin ((1998) Dev Biol<br>
Stand 96:97-104) showed that RP chromatography resolved preparations of<br>
IFN-β-1b into a major component ("Peak B") and a minor component that<br>
eluted earlier ("Peak A"). Lin ((1998) supra) further demonstrated that<br>
Peak A contained IFN-β-1b in which a functionally active methionine (Met 61<br>
of BETASERON) was oxidized to a sulfoxide. The present inventors have<br>
discovered conditions under which nearly complete oxidation of the<br>
N-terminal serine can be achieved with minimal oxidation of Met 61, as<br>
reflected in the percentage of Peak A in RP chromatograms. Oxidation of<br>
Met 61, as measured by RP chromatography, was used as a surrogate marker<br>
for oxidation of the other methionine residues of IFN-β-1 (Met 35 and<br>
Met 116 of BETASERON).<br>
[00199]	Studies of the extent of oxidation of Met 61 as a function of the pH and<br>
time of incubation with 0.25 mM NaIO4 at 4°C are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><br>
[00200]	The demonstration of aldehyde formation by N-terminal oxidation of<br>
IFN-β-1b was facilitated by its conjugation to 9-fluorenylmethyl carbazate<br>
("Fmoc-carbazate," also known in the art as "Fmoc-hydrazide") (Fluka 46917;<br>
Zhang, R.-E., et al., (1991) Anal Biochem 795:160-167). The distinctive<br>
absorbance spectra of Fmoc-carbazate adducts of JFN-β-1b enabled their<br>
discrimination from the corresponding unconjugated forms of the protein<br>
without the use of a fluorescence detector. Interferon-β-1b was oxidized by<br>
treatment with various concentrations of NaIO4 at pH 7.8 for various periods<br>
of time (0.5 to 2 hours at room temperature or up to several days in the cold).<br>
In the experiments shown in. Figure 20, the protein was incubated for 1 hour at<br>
room temperature with 0.5 rtiM NaIO4). The reaction was terminated by the<br>
addition of glycerol. After 30 minutes at room temperature, the pH was<br>
reduced by the addition of acetic acid to a final concentration of 19 mM. To<br>
each mL of resultant mixture, 182 mcL of 15 mM Frnoc carbazate in methanol<br>
was added to give a final concentration of 2.3 mM Fmoc-carbazate. This<br>
reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 4-8°C prior to analysis by<br>
reversed phase chromatography.<br>
[00201]	Figure 20 illustrates the effects on RP chromatographic behavior of<br>
incubation of IFN-β-1b with 0.5 mM NaIO4 for 1 hour at room temperature<br>
and of coupling of the products of oxidation to Fmoc-carbazate. A<br>
comparison of the results for the control sample (upper curve) with those for<br><br>
the oxidized sample (middle curve with open circles) shows that the retention<br>
times of both the main component and of Peak A (reflecting the presence of<br>
about 5% of IFN-β-1b with an oxidized methionine residue) are increased by<br>
0.2 to 0.3 minutes by oxidation. As measured by the percentage of Peak A,<br>
compared to Peak A', less than 1% oxidation of methionine was detected after<br>
incubation with NaIO4 under these conditions.<br>
[00202]	The results of bioassays that are described in Example 11 provide<br>
additional evidence that controlled oxidation (e.g., for up to 2 hours in the<br>
cold) with 0.1 to 0.3 mM periodate preserved the integrity of the amino acid<br>
residues of the protein that are essential for bioactivity.<br>
[00203]	As shown in the lower curve with filled triangles in Figure 20,<br>
evidence for the formation of Fmoc adducts was provided by the shift to<br>
longer retention times for both the major component and Peak A' (the<br>
N-terminal aldehyde derivative of Peak A). Furthermore, there was a 50%<br>
increase in the ratio of absorbance at 278 run to that at 214 nm for the shifted<br>
peaks. For both forms of the protein, the increases in retention times due to<br>
formation of the corresponding N-terminal aldehydes (0.2-0.3 minutes) were<br>
much smaller than the increases resulting from formation of the corresponding<br>
Fmoc derivatives (1.0-1.2 minutes).<br>
Example 9: Synthesis of PEG-carbazate Adducts of N-Terminally<br>
Oxidized Interferon-β-1b<br>
[002041	Interferon-β-1b, selectively oxidized at the amino terminus as<br>
described in Example 8, was also coupled to a carbazate derivative of PEG, by<br>
an adaptation of methods described by R.J. Drummond et al. (PCT Publication<br>
No WO 99/45026; U.S. Patent No. 6,423,685) and by S. Zalipsky et al., (PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 92/16555 Al and in. Harris, J.M, et al., eds., (1997)<br>
Chemistry and Biological Applications of Poly (ethylene glycol), pp. 318-341,<br>
Washington, D.C., American Chemical Society). PEG-carbazate was<br>
synthesized by the reaction of hydrazine with a β-nitrophenyl carbonate<br>
derivative of 20-kDa PEG ("NPC-PEG" from NOF Corporation). After<br>
incubation of the protein at room temperature in the absence of periodate or in<br><br>
the presence of 0.125 mM NaIO4 for 0.5, 1 or 2 hours, the samples were<br>
diluted with 4 volumes of 20-kDa PEG-carbazate in 10mM acetate buffer,<br>
150 mM NaCl, pH 4.6, containing 1 mg/mL SDS, and incubated for 1 day at<br>
room temperature. The samples were analyzed by size-exclusion<br>
chromatography on a Superose 12 column in 10mM Tris, 150mM NaCl,<br>
pH 8.3, containing 0.3 mg/mL SDS. As shown in Figure 21, oxidation of the<br>
protein for up to 2 hours prior to reaction with PEG-carbazate resulted in a<br>
progressive decrease in the concentration of the unmodified protein (eluted at<br>
a retention time of about 25 minutes) and a progressive increase in the<br>
proportion of absorbance associated with the PEG1-IFN-β-1 conjugate<br>
(eluted at a retention time of about 20 minutes). Yields of PEGi-IFN-β-1<br>
exceeding 80% have been obtained by this method. Similar results were<br>
obtained using monocarbazate derivatives of 10-kDa or 30-kDa PEG.<br>
Example 10: Bioassay of MonoPEGylated Interferou-β-1b, Purified by<br>
Reversed Phase HPLC<br>
[ 00205]	The use of human Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells (ATCC #CCl,-231,<br>
Manassas, VA) for antiproliferative assays of interferon-β-1a and various<br>
muteins was described by L. Runkel et al. ((2000) Biochemishy 39:2538-<br>
2551). Figure 22 depicts the results of assays of the antiproliferative activities<br>
on Daudi cells of untreated IFN-β-1b and an N-terminally monoPEGylated<br>
conjugate that was partially purified by RP chromatography. The cells were<br>
grown in supplemented RPMI1640 medium (Gibco #11875-093, Grand<br>
Island, NY) with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific #3000, Santa<br>
Ana, CA). One hundred thousand cells were inoculated into 250 mcL of<br>
medium in each well of a 48-well plate and allowed to grow at 37°C with 5%<br>
CO2 for 4 hours prior to being mixed with an equal volume of pre-warmed<br>
medium or dilutions of EFN-β-Ib or a PEG conjugate in medium. During<br>
3 days, the number of ceils diluted only with medium increased to<br>
590 +/- 24% (s.d.) of the number at time zero, based on cell counts with a<br>
Coulter counter (Model Zl, Miami, FL). Under conditions of maximal growth<br><br>
inhibition by IFN-β-1b or its PEG conjugates, the number of cells increased to<br>
283 +/- 8% of the number at time zero. Thus the maximal percent of growth<br>
inhibition observed in this experiment was 48%. The data in Figure 22 for<br>
various concentrations of two preparations of IFN-β-1b are expressed as a<br>
percent of the inhibitable cell growth.<br>
[00206]	Figure 22 shows the results from a study using dilutions of the stock<br>
solution of IFN-β-1b and of fractions from the preparative reversed phase<br>
chromatographic experiment described in Example 7 that contained either<br>
nearly pure monoPEG conjugate, as shown in Figures 17-19 (Fraction 51), or<br>
nearly pure Mock PEGylated IFN-β-1b (Fraction 53 of the column shown in<br>
Figure 17). The samples were diluted, in triplicate, to 1 mcg/mL in medium<br>
supplemented with fetal calf serum and sterilized by filtration through a<br>
0.2-micrometer filter. From each of the initial dilutions, a 32 ng/mL dilution<br>
and subsequent serial dilutions were made. From the data in Figure 22, the<br>
concentration of each preparation required for inhibition of 50% of the<br>
inhibitable cell growth ("IC50") was calculated. The results showed that the<br>
mono-PEGylated IFN-3-1b (ICso - c. 40 pg/mL) was approximately 6 times as<br>
potent as the unmodified IFN-β-1b (IC50 = c. 250 pg/mL). The mean<br>
increases in antiproliferative potencies of conjugates with PEGs of various<br>
sizes, tested in a series of experiments similar to that shown in Figure 22, had<br>
a range of about 2.5-fold (for 10 kDa PEG) to about 5-fold (for 30 kDa PEG).<br>
[00207]	Surprisingly, the Mock PEGylated preparation shown in Figure 22 had<br>
an IC50 of about 80 pg/mL, which was intermediate between those of the stock<br>
solution of EFN-β-1b and the mono PEGylated preparation. While not<br>
intending to be bound by theory or any particular mechanistic explanation, it is<br>
plausible that the enhanced antiproliferative potency of the Mock PEGylated<br>
preparation reflects the removal during reversed phase chromatography of<br>
some inhibitory material that is present in the stock IFN-β-1b solution. This<br>
interpretation is consistent with the results of size-exclusion chromatography<br>
on a column of Superoseo in a buffer containing SDS (as described in<br>
Example 4), which revealed an absorbance peak at both 214 nm and 280 nm<br>
that eluted between the elution positions of IFN-β-1b and the "salt peak."<br><br>
Bioassay experiments similar to those shown in Figure 22 were performed on<br>
Fraction 49 from the RP column, which contained a mixture of PEG2- and<br>
PEGt-IFN-β-1 (see Figures 18 and 19). As in the case of the Mock<br>
PEGylated sample, the multiply PEGylated sample had antiproliferative<br>
potency that was greater than that of the stock solution of IFN-β-1b, but less<br>
than that of the monoPEGylated conjugate. In other experiments, the increase<br>
in potency observed with monoPEGylated IFN-β-1 ranged from six-fold to<br>
ten-fold. Similar increases in potency were observed with the carbazate<br>
adducts described in Example 9, employing PEGs of 10, 20 and 30 kDa.<br>
[00208]	The antiproliferative potencies on Daudi cells obtained with the<br>
conjugates of this invention can be compared with the reported specific<br>
activities of three pharmaceutical forms of interferon-β measured in an<br>
antiviral assay. According to the respective package inserts, the activities are<br>
32 x 106 IU/mg for Berlex's BETASERON® (EFN-β-Lb), 200 x 106 IU/mg for<br>
AVONEX® (Biogen's formulation of EFN-β-1a) and 270 x 106 IU/mg for<br>
REBIF® (Serono's formulation of IFN-β-1a). Accordingly, the increase of at<br>
least six-fold in the potency of monoPEGylated BETASERON in the<br>
antiproliferative assay illustrated in Figure 22 indicates that N-terminal<br>
PEGylation of BETASERON by the methods of this invention has increased its<br>
potency to the range expected for the commercially available glycosylated<br>
preparations, AVONEX and REBIF.<br>
[00209]	Previously, the solubility of nonglycosylated interferon-β (expressed in<br>
Escherichia coli), has been enhanced by the use of acidic solutions (Hanisch,<br>
W.H. et al, U.S. Patent: No. 4,462,940) or by the addition of SDS (Thomson,<br>
J.W., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,440). Without intending to be bound by theory,<br>
one mechanism by which PEGylation may increase the antiproliferative<br>
efficacy of IFN-β-1b measured in vitro is by decreasing its tendency to self-<br>
associate in the culture medium. Accordingly, the observation that the sample<br>
enriched in PEG2-IFN-β-lb was less effective than PEG1-IFN-β-1b indicates<br>
that the positive effects of decreased aggregation may be overcome by the<br>
negative effect of excessive PEGylation on the ability of this cytokine to bind<br><br>
to its receptors and/or to initiate the signal transduction responsible for its<br>
antiproliferative activity.<br>
Example 11: Bioassays of Selectively Oxidized Interferon-β-1b<br>
[00210]	Assays of the antiproliferative activity on Daudi cells of IFN-β-1<br>
oxidized to various extents were performed as described in Example 10. The<br>
tested samples included the stock solution of TFN-β-1b and samples that had<br>
been treated for several days at 4°C with 0.1, 0.3 or 3 mM periodate. The<br>
samples were diluted as described in Example 10 and mixed with an equal<br>
volume of Daudi cell suspension, 4 hours after inoculation of the cells. The<br>
cells were grown for 2 days at 37°C with 5% CO2 and then counted with a<br>
Coulter counter. The antiproliferative activity of IFN-β-1b was unaffected or<br>
increased by treatment with 0.075-0.5 mM NaIO4 under the conditions tested.<br>
Similar results were obtained in 3-day antiproliferative assays, as described in<br>
Example 10. Antiproliferative potency was further enhanced by conjugation<br>
of the selectively oxidized IFN-β-1b with PEG-carbazate, as described in<br>
Example 9. Similar results to those obtained with PEG-carbazate are obtained<br>
with products of conjugation of selectively oxidized DFN-β-1b to PEG-<br>
hydrazide. In contrast, the antiproliferative effect on Daudi cells was<br>
suppressed or completely abolished by treatment of IFN-β-1b with higher<br>
concentrations of periodate, e.g. 1-3 mM. These high concentrations ot NaIO4<br>
induced dimerization of the protein, which was detected by size-exclusion<br>
HPLC on a Superose 12 column, as described in Example 5, and oxidation of<br>
methionine, as detected by reversed phase chromatography, as described in<br>
Example 6 (results not shown).<br>
[00211]	Bioactivities of the conjugates of this invention can be measured by<br>
art-known antiproliferative and antiviral assays based on various cell lines or<br>
primary cultures, wherein the cells bear cell-surface receptors for IFN-beta.<br>
Alternatively, one can monitor responses to IFN-beta that include the<br>
induction of neopterin (Pepinsky. R.B., et al., supra), β2-microglobulin<br>
(Pepinsky, R.B., et al., supra), or 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (Bruchelt,<br><br>
G., et al., (1992) Eur J. Clin Chem Clin Biochem 50:521-528) or reporter<br>
proteins operatively linked to the promoters of proteins that are inducible by<br>
IFN-beta. Additional methods for assaying the bioactivity of polymer<br>
conjugates of IFN-beta include signal transduction assays and gene activation<br>
assays (e.g., Pungor, E., et al., (1998) J Interferon Cytokine Res 18:1025-<br>
1030).<br>
[00212]	This invention is described with reference to certain embodiments and<br>
certain examples thereof. The methods of this invention are similarly<br>
applicable to certain receptor-binding peptides and proteins other than<br>
cytokines or their antagonists and to other conjugation reagents. Therefore,<br>
the scope of this invention is not limited to the embodiments described, but is<br>
