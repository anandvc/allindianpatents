				<td>A STABLE COMPOSITION COMPRISING EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR AS AN ACTIVE INGRDIENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a stable composition comprising epidermal growth factor (hereinafter referred to as "EOF') as an active ingredient. More specifically, the present invention relates to a stable composition which comprises EGF having a biological activity and a carboxyvinyl polymer capable of being significantly increased stability of EGF in an aqueous solution as a base.<br>
EGF(known as urogastrone) is a polypeptide having a molecular weight of 6045 which consists of 53 amino acid residues and includes three of disulfide bonds. EGF is known as a wound healing agent for the skin and cornea and a gastric ulcer healing agent because it represents a good activity for stimulating mitosis of various cells including epidermal and messenchymal cells and growth thereof and controlling secretion of gastric acid. (US Patent No. 140998 ; Carpenter, Experimental Cell Research, 164:1-10, 1986).<br>
Although EGF shows a good activity for simulating differentiation of epidermal cells in vitro, it is very difficult that topical formulation containing EGF is developed to treat wounds of the skin and cornea for the reason that EGF has only a little effect in treating wounds when it is clinically applied to wounds,<br>
EGF is biologically unstable and physicochemically non-homogenous so that its healing effects are not sufficient and its decomposition products<br><br>
may induce allergic reactions. Accordingly EGF cannot exhibit sufficient effects for treating wounds in an application to a living body. EGF is very unstable at the room temperature, particularly in the presence of moisture. Although a lag time is required about 8 to 12 hours for DNA synthesis on wounds, EGF has a very short half-life of about 1 hour not to get the desired effects. Furthermore, EGF is physicochemically denatured at the room temperature and even in the state of cold storage when it is stored for a long time. When EGF is applied on the skin, EGF loses biological activity resulting from denaturation, decomposition, condensation and precipitation of EGF due to proteolytic enzymes to exist in wounds (Manning et al., Pharmaceutical Res., 6:903-917. 1989).<br>
In order to overcome biological unstableness of EGF and provide its desired wound healing effect, it is reported that EGF is continuously applied on wounds during initial few days of treatment which are most important time for wounds healing so as to constantly maintain an effective level of EGF (Frankline et al.../ Lab. Clin. Med., 108:103-108, 1986). In this regard, some sustained EGF-releasing formulations have been studied, which can continuously provide EGF to wounds.<br>
As a result. US Patent No. 4,944,948 discloses the EGF/liposome gel formulations which continuously provide EGF to wounds using neutral phospholipids, negative-charged phospholipids and cholesterol; and EP Publication No. 312208 discloses the aqueous formulation being able to continuously release EGF which comprises pharmaceuticaHy acceptable various water-soluble or water-swellable polymer as a base. However, although the above-mentioned prior arts disclose the formulations which can<br><br>
continuously release EGF for 12 hours or more, they are unsuitable for producing in industrial fields because these formulations are unstable in long-term storage. Therefore, it has been required that a biological activity of EGF is maintained for a long time and a physicochemical stability thereof such as purity and homogeneity as well in order to provide EGF sufficient wounds healing effect as a medicine.<br>
As a method to maintain physicochemical stability of EGF and inhibit a decrease of EGF activity, EP Publication No. 205051 provides the pharmaceutical composition in the form of a cream for dermal and ophthalmic use, which comprises 0.0001 - 0.005% (w/w) of EGF, 1 - 10 % (w/w) of surfactants, 5-45 % (w/w) of fatty substances and 0.3 - 0.8 % (w/w) of preservatives. EP Publication No. 267015 and US Patent No. 4717717 provides the compositions containing EGF stabilized by an addition of a water-soluble cellulose derivative to EGF. Also EP Publication No. 398615 and US Patent No. 5130298 provide the methods for stabilizing EGF by mixing EGF with a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation such as zinc which is capable of preventing the degradation of EGF in aqueous solution since EGF is ionically bound with zinc.<br>
However, although the above-mentioned stabilizers are added, the stability of EGF is maintained for about two months at 4 "C. Therefore, when the topical formulation of EGF for the skin is clinically applied to wounds, they are unsuitable for utilizing in industrial fields since they have a little healing effect for wounds and the reduced stability of the formulation.<br>
Accordingly, it is very desirable to develop the formulated preparation of EGF useful for treating incurable pathology and so on such as dermal ulcer<br><br>
or corneal injure in the state of no special treating agent, which sufficiently exhibit the wound-healing effects, has a protected EGF against a loss of biological activity and quickly delivers EGF from the carrier to wounds when it is applied.<br>
Thus, the present inventors have conducted numerous studies to develop the topical preparation of EGF which has a sufficient wound-healing effect and a good stability. As a result, we have found that the topical preparation comprising EGF as an active ingredient and acidic polymer such as carboxyvinyl polymer as a base can exhibit the desired good wound-healing effect and significant stability as compared with the prior arts using a base such as cellulose based polymer or neutral polymer.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a biologically and physicochemically stable composition containing EGF, which comprises EGF as an active ingredient and a carboxyvinyl polymer as a base.<br>

EGF as an active ingredient may be isolated from natural sources or produced using recombinant DNA techniques. The content of EGF in the composition is within the range of 0.001 to l,000//g/g on the basis of the total weight of the preparation, preferably in the range of 0.1 to 100#g/g such that EGF is pharmacologically effective. The pH of the composition according to the present invention is preferably in the range of 4 to 8, more preferably in the<br><br>
range of 5 to 7 in order to keep EGF dissolved without denaturation.<br>
A carboxyvinyl polymer which is used as a base in the present invention is a homopolymer having molecular weight of 1 x 106 to 4 x 106. The carboxyvinyl polymer, which is a cross-linked product of acrylic acid and aryl sucrose, is an acidic polymer indicating pH of 2.5 to 3.0 when it is dispersed in 1% aqueous solution. It has the wide range of viscosity even in a low concentration of less than 1% so that it is widely used as a base to suspension for oral, lotion, cream and gel preparation. Furthermore, the carboxyvinyl polymer contains carboxylic residue in the ratio of 56.0 to 68.0% regardless of a kind of polymer including Carbomer 934, Carbomer 934P, Carbomer 940, Carbomer 941 or Carbomer 947P. The content of carboxyvinyl polymer is within the range of 0.001 to 50 wt% on the basis of the total weight of the composition, preferably 0.005 to 25wt%, more preferably 0.01 to 10wt%.<br>
The composition according to the present invention may further contain pharmaceutically acceptable additives, for example stabilizer, excipient isotropic agent, moisturizing agent, pH controlling agent and so on.<br>
The present inventors have conducted the stability test comparing the EGF preparation containing the carboxyvinyl polymer according to the present invention with EGF preparations containing another polymers as a base for six months at 4°C and 25 "C. In this case, EGF dissolved in lOmM phosphate buffer is used as a control and the content of EGF is analyzed with ELISA method. As a result EGF preparation containing the carboxyvinyl polymer as a base according to the present invention shows a significant stabilization in the various concentration as compared with EGF preparations containing<br><br>
another base as well as EGF dissolved in phosphate buffer. From this result, it is identified that EGF in EGF preparation according to the present invention is stabilized by the addition of the carboxyvinyl polymer regardless of contents thereof and then the polymer may be used as a base controlling its viscosity optionally and be added as a stabilizer depending on the purpose for use.<br>
The composition containing EGF according to the present invention is useful in eye formulations, topical formulations for a skin such as cream, ointment, gel, patch and so on, and the composition may be used by coating or spreading on the cotton plane surface gauze, and the composition can be stored in a lyophilize form and then dissolved in a suitable solvent when it is used if necessary. Furthermore, the topical formulation for the skin may be useful in cosmetic formulation.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is discloses a stable composition which comprises a biologically active epidermal growth factor (hereinafter referred to as "EGF") as an active ingredient and a carboxyvinyl polymer as a stabilizer of EGF, wherein the content of EGF is within the range of 0.001 to 1,000 //g/g on the basis of a total weight of the composition, and the content of carboxyvinyl polymer is within the range of 0.001 to 50(w/w)% on the basis: of a total weight of the composition.<br>

Experiment 1<br>
Stability test of eyedrop formulation<br>
The stability of eyedrop formulation containing Carbomer prepared in Example 1 was tested as compared with the carboxyl methyl cellulose-containing formulation prepared in Example 2 which was known to stabilize EOF. The test was conducted to estimate EOF contents of each formulation with the lapse of time(2, 4, 8 and 18 weeks) under storage at 4°C and 25 °C. The sample of Example 2 dissolved in lOmM phosphate buffer was used to standard sample and the content of EOF was estimated by ELISA Method of Quantikine EOF ELISA kit(R&amp;D, U.S.A).<br>
Table 1 shows the result regarding the stability of EGF-containing eyedrop formulation as compared with standard sample at 4°C and Table 2 shows the result regarding the stability of EGF-containing eyedrop formulation as compared with standard sample at 25 °C.<br>
As can be seen from the below Table 1, EOF content in phosphate buffer was decreased by about 10% in 8 weeks at 4°C while EOF contents in Carbomer and carboxyl methyl cellulose were not changed until 8 weeks. However, in storage of 18 weeks at 4 °C condition, EGF contents in phosphate buffer and Carbomer formulation were not changed but EGF content in the carboxyl methyl cellulose was decreased to 87.3% in 18 weeks.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen from the below Table 2, when the same formulations were stored at 25 °C, the content of EGF in phosphate buffer sample was decreased by about 20% in 2 weeks and the content of EGF was continuously decreased after 4 weeks in the case of carboxyl methyl cellulose. However, the content of EGF in the formulation of Example 1 was little changed until 8 weeks. Also, when the formulation of Example 1 was stored for 18 weeks at the room temperature, the content of EGF was decreased by about 13% only. Therefore, it was identified that EGF stability was significantly increased even under storage at the room temperature in case of formulation containing Carbomer<br>

Experiment 2<br>
Stability test of topical gel formulation<br>
The stability of topical gel formulation prepared in Example 4 was tested as compared with the topical formulation containing Poloxamer being widely used as a base for topical formulation which is a neutral polymer and is known to contribute to stabilization of protein resulting from lowering dielectric constant in an aqueous solution. The test was conducted to estimate EOF content of each formulation in storage in 18 weeks at 4°C and 25 °C. The sample dissolved in lOmM phosphate buffer was used to standard sample and the content of EOF was estimated by ELISA Method of Quantikine EOF ELISA kit(R&amp;D, U.S.A).<br>
Table 3 and 4 show the stability of each topical gel formulation at 4 °C and 25 °C respectively. As can be seen from the below Table 3, EOF content of the formulations containing Carbomer or Poloxamer was not changed until 8 weeks in cold storage. However, in storage for 18 weeks, EOF content of<br>
Poloxamer-containing formulation was decreased by about 10%. As can be seen from the below Table 4, EGF content of 1% Carbomer-containing formulation was little changed until 18 weeks while EGF content of Poloxamer-containing formulation or phosphate buffer formulation was decreased by about 20% in 8 weeks and then continuously decreased until 18 weeks. The degree of decrease was further large in the case of Poloxamer-containing formulation As seen from the eyedrop formulation, when a polymer was used as a base, the content of EGF was further decreased rather than phosphate buffer as time passed because the polymer might further promote the degradation of EGF in long-term storage. In conclusion, it was identified that the stability of EGF in formulation could be improved by using Carbomer as a base necessarily.<br>
