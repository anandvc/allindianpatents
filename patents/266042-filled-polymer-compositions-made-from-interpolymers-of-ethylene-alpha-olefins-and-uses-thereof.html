FILLED POLYMER COMPOSITIONS MADE FROM INTERPOLYMERS OF ETHYLENE/o-OLEFINS AND USES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
f 1]       The invention relates to filled polymer compositions comprising an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer and filler, methods of making the filled polymer compositions and products made therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [2]       Composites of filled thermoplastic compositions with sound deadening properties are well known for use in automotive applications. The thermoplastic compositions typically comprise a polymer, a plasticizer and a filler. A number of patents have been granted for such highly filled thermoplastic compositions as represented by U.S. Patents. No. 4,191,798; 4,222,924; 4,263,196; 4,379,190; 4,403,007; 4,430,468; 4,434,258; and 4,438,228. Different systems of polymers, plasticizers and fillers have been proposed for sound deadening applications in automotive flooring. For example, the above-mentioned patents disclose the use of ethylene interpolymers such as ethylene/vinyl ester, ethylene/unsaturated mono- or di-carboxylic acids, or esters of unsaturated acids, etc. Blends of such ethylene interpolymers with other elastomers and polymers have also been proposed in these applications. Further, various filled polyethylene copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, ethylene-propylene-diene compositions are used for applications in wire and cable.<br>
[3]       Notwithstanding the proposal of many different polymer based filled compositions for use in sound-deadening composites and other applications, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) has been most widely used on a commercial basis. There is practical limit for addition of fillers such as the more commonly employed medium-density fillers, e.g., CaCO3, bauxite, gypsum, etc. As the filler levels rise above a certain point, other properties suffer, such as melt index (as it drops, extruder pressures mount rapidly), softness (the "hand" becomes much stiffer), and elongation (which drops alarmingly). Ultimately, it is not possible to compound binary EVA/CaC03 blends as the mixture will no longer "flux" in a Banbury Mixer (the charge merely stirs—the resin will not "work" as the blades turn, no power rise ensues, the mixture on discharge is still discrete EVA pellets in a powdery Whiting mass). If one were to use a very dense filler, such as BaSO4, slightly more filler can be added to binary EVA blends. However, there is a demand for improved materials which meet a number of balanced properties such as impact strength, tensile, elongation, flex modulus, heat resistance and specific gravity. In addition, where the sound-deadening composition or composite is used in<br><br>
certain applications such as automotive flooring, a number of other requirements have been specified by automobile manufacturers. For example, automotive materials or parts must satisfy requirements of resistance to cold, mildew, fogging and flammability. [4]       Thus, there is a need for other materials that have improved noise, vibration and harshness dampening properties, increased heat resistance, and low modulus for use in flooring for automotive, cable and wire and roofing members.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [5]       The aforementioned needs are met by various aspects of the invention.

[52]     "Interpolymer" means a polymer prepared by the polymerization of at least two different types of monomers. The generic term "interpolymer" includes the term "copolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from two different monomers) as well as the term "terpolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from three different types of monomers). It also encompasses polymers made by polymerizing four or more types of monomers.<br><br>
[53]     The term "ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer" generally refers to polymers comprising ethylene and an a -olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms. Preferably, ethylene comprises the majority mole fraction of the whole polymer, i.e., ethylene comprises at least about 50 mole percent of the whole polymer. More preferably ethylene comprises at least about 60 mole percent, at least about 70 mole percent, or at least about 80 mole percent, with the substantial remainder of the whole polymer comprising at least one other comonomer that is preferably an a-olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms. For many ethylene/octene copolymers, the preferred composition comprises an ethylene content greater than about 80 mole percent of the whole polymer and an octene content of from about 10 to about 15, preferably from about 15 to about 20 mole percent of the whole polymer. In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers do not include those produced in low yields or in a minor amount or as a by-product of a chemical process. While the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers can be blended with one or more polymers, the as-produced ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are substantially pure and often comprise a major component of the reaction product of a polymerization process.<br>
[54]     The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise ethylene and one or more copolymerizable a-olefin comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties. That is, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are block interpolymers, preferably multi-block interpolymers or copolymers. The terms "interpolymer" and copolymer" are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymer can be represented by the following formula:<br>
(AB)„ where n is at least 1, preferably an integer greater than I, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, or higher, "A" represents a hard block or segment and "B" represents a soft block or segment. Preferably, As and Bs are linked in a substantially linear fashion, as opposed to a substantially branched or substantially star-shaped fashion. In other embodiments, A blocks and B blocks are randomly distributed along the polymer chain. In other words, the block copolymers usually do not have a structure as follows.<br>
AAA—AA-BBB—BB In still other embodiments, the block copolymers do not usually have a third type of block, which comprises different comonomer(s). In yet other embodiments, each of block A and block B has monomers or comonomers substantially randomly distributed within the block.<br><br>
In other words, neither block A nor block B comprises two or more sub-segments (or sub-blocks) of distinct composition, such as a tip segment, which has a substantially different composition than the rest of the block.<br>
[55]     The multi-block polymers typically comprise various amounts of "hard" and "soft" segments. "Hard" segments refer to blocks of polymerized units in which ethylene is present in an amount greater than about 95 weight percent, and preferably greater than about 98 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In other words, the comonomer content (content of monomers other than ethylene) in the hard segments is less than about 5 weight percent, and preferably less than about 2 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the hard segments comprises all or substantially all ethylene. "Soft" segments, on the other hand, refer to blocks of polymerized units in which the comonomer content (content of monomers other than ethylene) is greater than about 5 weight percent, preferably greater than about 8 weight percent, greater than about 10 weight percent, or greater than about 15 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the comonomer content in the soft segments can be greater than about 20 weight percent, greater than about 25 weight percent, greater than about 30 weight percent, greater than about 35 weight percent, greater than about 40 weight percent, greater than about 45 weight percent, greater than about 50 weight percent, or greater than about 60 weight percent.<br>
[56]     The soft segments can often be present in a block interpolymer from about 1 weight percent to about 99 weight percent of the total weight of the block interpolymer, preferably from about 5 weight percent to about 95 weight percent, from about 10 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, from about 15 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, from about 20 weight percent to about 80 weight percent, from about 25 weight percent to about 75 weight percent, from about 30 weight percent to about 70 weight percent, from about 35 weight percent to about 65 weight percent, from about 40 weight percent to about 60 weight percent, or from about 45 weight percent to about 55 weight percent of the total weight of the block interpolymer. Conversely, the hard segments can be present in similar ranges. The soft segment weight percentage and the hard segment weight percentage can be calculated based on data obtained from DSC or NMR. Such methods and calculations are disclosed in a<br>

[57]     The term "crystalline" if employed, refers to a polymer that possesses a first order transition or crystalline melting point (Tm) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline". The term "amorphous" refers to a polymer lacking a crystalline melting point as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique.<br>
[58]     The term "multi-block copolymer" or "segmented copolymer" refers to a polymer containing two or more chemically distinct regions or segments (referred to as "blocks") preferably joined in a linear manner, that is, a polymer having chemically differentiated units which are joined end-to-end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In a preferred embodiment, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystallinity, the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity (isotactic or syndiotactic), regio-regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or any other chemical or physical property. The multi-block copolymers are characterized by unique distributions of both polydispersity index (PDI or Mw/Mn), block length distribution, and/or block number distribution due to the unique process for making the copolymers. More specifically, when produced in a continuous process, the polymers desirably possess PDI from 1.7 to 2.9, preferably from 1.8 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, and most preferably from 1.8 to 2.1. When produced in a batch or semi-batch process, the polymers possess PDI from 1.0 to 2.9, preferably from 1.3 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.4 to 2.0, and most preferably from 1.4 to 1.8.<br>
[59]     In the following description, all numbers disclosed herein are approximate values, regardless whether the word "about" or "approximate" is used in connection therewith. They may vary by 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, or, sometimes, 10 to 20 percent. Whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, RL and an upper limit, RU, is disclosed, any number falling within the range is specifically disclosed. In particular, the following numbers within the range are specifically disclosed: R=RL+k*(RU-RL), wherein k is a variable ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent with a 1 percent increment, i.e., k is 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent,..., 50 percent, 51 percent, 52 percent,..., 95 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent,<br><br>
98 percent, 99 percent, or 100 percent. Moreover, any numerical range defined by two R numbers as defined in the above is also specifically disclosed.<br>
Filled Polymer Compositions [60]     Provided herein are filled polymer compositions that have the desired noise, vibration and harshness improvement properties. The filled polymer compositions provided herein comprise:<br>
A.	a polymer which is an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, and<br>
B.	a filler.<br>
[61]     In certain embodiments, the compositions further comprise: C. a plasticizer and optionally D. an additive. The filled polymer compositions provided herein possess unique physical properties, such as higher heat resistance, better flexibility, and improvement in heat resistance-low modulus balance that make them suitable for use in variety of applications in noise vibration and harshness improvement, in automotive flooring and rooftops, in cable and wire.<br>
[62]     Furthermore, compared to traditional polyolefin copolymers and blends, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers and blends provided herein exhibit higher crystallization temperatures. The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer compositions provided herein exhibit higher green strength at relatively higher temperature compared with traditional random copolymer compositions, which will allow higher set-up temperatures, shorter set-up time and thus allow faster production rate in injection molding, calendaring, thermoforming, and other similar types of operations. The higher crystallization temperature of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers will yield lower shrinkage relative to the random copolymers. Component A: Polymer Ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers [63]     The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers used in embodiments of the invention (also referred to as "inventive interpolymer" or "inventive polymer") comprise ethylene and one or more copolymerizable a-olefin comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (block interpolymer), preferably a multi-block copolymer. The ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymers are characterized by one or more of the aspects described as follows.<br>
f64]     In one aspect, the ethv!ene/a-o!efin interpolvmers used in embodiments of the invention have a Mw/Mn from about 1.7 to about 3.5 and at least one melting point, Tm, in<br><br><br>
[65]     Such melting point/density relationship is illustrated in Figure 1. Unlike the traditional random copolymers of ethylene/a-olefins whose melting points decrease with decreasing densities, the inventive interpolymers (represented by diamonds) exhibit melting points substantially independent of the density, particularly when density is between about 0.87 g/cc to about 0.95 g/cc. For example, the melting point of such polymers are in the range of about 110 °C to about 130 °C when density ranges from 0.875 g/cc to about 0.945 g/cc. In some embodiments, the melting point of such polymers are in the range of about 115 °C to about 125 °C when density ranges from 0.875 g/cc to about 0.945 g/cc. [66]     In another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise, in polymerized form, ethylene and one or more a-olefins and are characterized by a AT, in degree Celsius, defined as the temperature for the tallest Differential Scanning Calorimetry ("DSC") peak minus the temperature for the tallest Crystallization Analysis Fractionation ("CRYSTAF") peak and a heat of fusion in J/g, AH, and AT and AH satisfy the following relationships:<br><br>
for AH up to 130 J/g. Moreover, AT is equal to or greater than 48 °C for AH greater than 130 J/g. The CRYSTAF peak is determined using at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer (that is, the peak must represent at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer), and if less than 5 percent of the polymer has an identifiable CRYSTAF peak, then the CRYSTAF temperature is 30°C, and AH is the numerical value of the heat of fusion in J/g. More preferably, the highest CRYSTAF peak contains at least 10 percent of the cumulative polymer. Figure 2 shows plotted data for inventive polymers as well as comparative examples. Integrated peak areas and peak temperatures are calculated by the computerized drawing program supplied by the instrument maker. The diagonal line shown for the random ethylene octene comparative polymers corresponds to the equation AT = -0.1299 (AH) + 62.81.<br><br>
[67]     In yet another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C when fractionated using Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation ("TREF"), characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein the comparable random ethylene interpolymer contains the same comonomer(s), and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the block interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the block interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the block interpolymer.<br>
[68]     In still another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are characterized by an elastic recovery, Re, in percent at 300 percent strain and 1 cycle measured on a compression-molded film of an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, and has a density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Re and d satisfy the following relationship when ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is substantially free of a cross-linked phase:<br>
Re &gt;1481-1629(d); and preferably<br>
Re &gt;1491-1629(d); and more preferably<br>
Re &gt;1501-1629(d); and even more preferably<br>
Re&gt;1511-1629(d). [69]     Figure 3 shows the effect of density on elastic recovery for unoriented films made from certain inventive interpolymers and traditional random copolymers. For the same density, the inventive interpolymers have substantially higher elastic recoveries. [70]     In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a tensile strength above 10 MPa, preferably a tensile strength &gt; 11 MPa, more preferably a tensile strength &gt; 13MPa and/or an elongation at break of at least 600 percent, more preferably at least 700 percent, highly preferably at least 800 percent, and most highly preferably at least 900 percent at a crosshead separation rate of 11 cm/minute.<br>
[71]     In other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have (1) a storage modulus ratio, G'(25°C)/G'(100°C), 0f from 1 to 50, preferably from 1 to 20, more preferably from 1 to 10; and/or (2) a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent, especially less than 60 percent, less than 50 percent, or less than 40 percent, down to a compression set of 0 percent.<br><br>
[72]     In still other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefm interpolymers have a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, less than 70 percent, less than 60 percent, or less than 50 percent. Preferably, the 70°C compression set of the interpolymers is less than 40 percent, less than 30 percent, less than 20 percent, and may go down to about 0 percent. [73]     In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a heat of fusion of less than 85 J/g and/or a pellet blocking strength of equal to or less than 100 pounds/foot2 (4800 Pa), preferably equal to or less than 50 lbs/ft (2400 Pa), especially equal to or less than 5 lbs/ft2 (240 Pa), and as low as 0 lbs/ft2 (0 Pa).<br>
[74]     In other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise, in polymerized form, at least 50 mole percent ethylene and have a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent or less than 60 percent, most preferably less than 40 to 50 percent and down to close zero percent.<br>
[75]     In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymers possess a PDI fitting a Schultz-Flory distribution rather than a Poisson distribution. The copolymers are further characterized as having both a polydisperse block distribution and a polydisperse distribution of block sizes and possessing a most probable distribution of block lengths. Preferred multi-block copolymers are those containing 4 or more blocks or segments including terminal blocks. More preferably, the copolymers include at least 5, 10 or 20 blocks or segments including terminal blocks.<br>
[76]     Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") spectroscopy preferred. Moreover, for polymers or blends of polymers having relatively broad TREF curves, the polymer desirably is first fractionated using TREF into fractions each having an eluted temperature range of 10°C or less. That is, each eluted fraction has a collection temperature window of 10°C or less. Using this technique, said block interpolymers have at least one such fraction having a higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding fraction of the comparable interpolymer.<br>
[77]     In another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks (i.e., at least two blocks) or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a peak (but not just a molecular fraction) which elutes between 40°C and 130°C (but without<br><br>
collecting and/or isolating individual fractions), characterized in that said peak, has a comonomer content estimated by infra-red spectroscopy when expanded using a full width/half maximum (FWHM) area calculation, has an average molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer peak at the same elution temperature and expanded using a full width/half maximum (FWHM) area calculation, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer has the same comonomer(s) and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. The full width/half maximum (FWHM) calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH3/CH2] from the ATREF infra-red detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Ti and T2, where Ti and T2 are points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve.   A calibration curve for comonomer content is made using random ethylene/a-olefin copolymers, plotting comonomer content from NMR versus FWHM area ratio of the TREF peak. For this infra-red method, the calibration curve is generated for the same comonomer type of interest. The comonomer content of TREF peak of the inventive polymer can be determined by referencing this calibration curve using its FWHM methyl: methylene area ratio [CH3/CH2] of the TREF peak.<br>
[78 J     Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy preferred. Using this technique, said blocked interpolymers has higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding comparable interpolymer.<br>
[79]     Preferably, for interpolymers of ethylene and 1-octene, the block interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br><br>
[80]     Figure 4 graphically depicts an embodiment of the block interpolymers of ethylene and 1-octene where a plot of the comonomer content versus TREF elution temperature for several comparable ethylene/1-octene interpolymers (random copolymers) are fit to a line representing (- 0.2013) T + 20.07 (solid line). The line for the equation (- 0.2013) T + 21.07 is depicted by a dotted line. Also depicted are the comonomer contents for fractions of several block ethylene/1-octene interpolymers of the invention (multi-block copolymers). All of the block interpolymer fractions have significantly higher 1-octene content than either line at equivalent elution temperatures. This result is characteristic of the inventive interpolymer and is believed to be due to the presence of differentiated blocks within the polymer chains, having both crystalline and amorphous nature.<br>
[81]     Figure 5 graphically displays the TREF curve and comonomer contents of polymer fractions for Example 5 and comparative F to be discussed below. The peak eluting from 40 to 130°C, preferably from 60°C to 95°C for both polymers is fractionated into three parts, each part eluting over a temperature range of less than 10°C. Actual data for Example 5 is represented by triangles. The skilled artisan can appreciate that an appropriate calibration curve may be constructed for interpolymers containing different comonomers and a line used as a comparison fitted to the TREF values obtained from comparative interpolymers of the same monomers, preferably random copolymers made using a metallocene or other homogeneous catalyst composition. Inventive interpolymers are characterized by a molar comonomer content greater than the value determined from the calibration curve at the same TREF elution temperature, preferably at least 5 percent greater, more preferably at least 10 percent greater.<br>
[82]     In addition to the above aspects and properties described herein, the inventive polymers can be characterized by one or more additional characteristics. In one aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10, 15, 20 or 25 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein said comparable random ethylene<br><br>
interpolymer comprises the same comonomer(s), preferably it is the same comonomer(s), and a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer.<br>
[83]     Preferably, the above interpolymers are interpolymers of ethylene and at least one a-olefin, especially those interpolymers having a whole polymer density from about 0.855 to about 0.935 g/cm3, and more especially for polymers having more than about 1 mole percent comonomer, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.1356) T + 13.89, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.1356) T+ 14.93, and most preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013)T + 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak ATREF elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C. [84]     Preferably, for the above interpolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin especially those interpolymers having a whole polymer density from about 0.855 to about 0.935 g/cm , and more especially for polymers having more than about 1 mole percent comonomer, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C. [85]     In still another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that every fraction having a comonomer content of at least about 6 mole percent, has a melting point greater than about 100°C. For those fractions having a comonomer content from about 3 mole percent to about 6 mole percent, every fraction has a DSC melting point of about 110°C or higher. More preferably, said polymer fractions, having at least 1 mol percent comonomer, has a DSC melting point that corresponds to the equation:<br>
Tm &gt; (-5.5926)(mol percent comonomer in the fraction) + 135.90.<br><br>
[86]     In yet another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that every fraction that has an ATREF elution temperature greater than or equal to about 76°C, has a melt enthalpy (heat of fusion) as measured by DSC, corresponding to the equation:<br>
Heat of fusion (J/gm) 
Heat of fusion (J/gm) 
[90]     The detector when used with an ATREF instrument provides both a concentration (CH2) and composition (CH3) signal response of the eluted polymer during the TREF process. A polymer specific calibration can be created by measuring the area ratio of the CH3 to CH2 for polymers with known comonomer content (preferably measured by NMR). The comonomer content of an ATREF peak of a polymer can be estimated by applying a the reference calibration of the ratio of the areas for the individual CH3 and CH2 response (i.e. area ratio CH3/CH2 versus comonomer content).<br><br>
[91]     The area of the peaks can be calculated using a full width/half maximum (FWHM) calculation after applying the appropriate baselines to integrate the individual signal responses from the TREF chromatogram. The full width/half maximum calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH3/CH2] from the ATREF infra-red detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Tl and T2, where Tl and T2 are points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve.<br>
[92]     The application of infra-red spectroscopy to measure the comonomer content of polymers in this ATREF-infra-red method is, in principle, similar to that of GPC/FTIR systems as described in the following references: Markovich, Ronald P.; Hazlitt, Lonnie G.; Smith, Linley; "Development of gel-permeation chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for characterization of ethylene-based polyolefin copolymers". Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering (1991), 65, 98-100.; and Deslauriers, P.J.; Rohlfing, D.C.; Shieh, E.T.; "Quantifying short chain branching microstructures in ethylene-1-olefin copolymers using size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SEC-FTIR)", Polymer (2002), 43, 59-170., both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
[93]     In other embodiments, the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is characterized by an average block index, ABI, which is greater than zero and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. The average block index, ABI, is the weight average of the block index ("BI") for each of the polymer fractions obtained in preparative TREF from 20°C and 110°C, with an increment of 5°C :<br><br><br>
where Tx is the preparative ATREF elution temperature for the ith fraction (preferably expressed in Kelvin), Px is the ethylene mole fraction for the ith fraction, which can be measured by NMR or IR as described above. PAB is the ethylene mole fraction of the whole ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer (before fractionation), which also can be measured by NMR or IR. TA and PA are the ATREF elution temperature and the ethylene mole fraction for pure "hard segments" (which refer to the crystalline segments of the interpolymer). As a first order approximation, the TA and PA values are set to those for high density polyethylene homopolymer, if the actual values for the "hard segments" are not available. For calculations performed herein, TA is 372°K, PA is 1.<br>
[95]     T^B is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of PAB. TAB can be calculated from the following equation:<br>
Ln PAB = O/TAB + P<br>
where a and P are two constants which can be determined by calibration using a number of known random ethylene copolymers. It should be noted that a and p may vary from instrument to instrument. Moreover, one would need to create their own calibration curve with the polymer composition of interest and also in a similar molecular weight range as the fractions. There is a slight molecular weight effect. If the calibration curve is obtained from similar molecular weight ranges, such effect would be essentially negligible. In some embodiments, random ethylene copolymers satisfy the following relationship:<br>

Txo is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of Px- TXo can be calculated from LnPx = a/Txo + P-Conversely, Pxo is the ethylene mole fraction for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ATREF temperature of Tx, which can be calculated from Ln Pxo = al/Tx + p.<br>
[96]     Once the block index (BI) for each preparative TREF fraction is obtained, the weight average block index, ABI, for the whole polymer can be calculated. In some embodiments, ABI is greater than zero but less than about 0.3 or from about 0.1 to about 0.3. In other embodiments, ABI is greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0. Preferably, ABI should be in the range of from about 0.4 to about 0.7, from about 0.5 to about 0.7, or from about 0.6 to about 0.9. In some embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.9, from about 0.3 to about 0.8, or from about 0.3 to about 0.7, from about 0.3 to about 0.6, from about 0.3 to about 0.5, or from about 0.3 to about 0.4. ln other embodiments, ABi is in the range ot<br><br>
from about 0.4 to about 1.0, from about 0.5 to about 1.0, or from about 0.6 to about 1.0, from about 0.7 to about 1.0, from about 0.8 to about 1.0, or from about 0.9 to about 1.0. [97]     Another characteristic of the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is that the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer comprises at least one polymer fraction which can be obtained by preparative TREF, wherein the fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. In some embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.6 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.7 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.8 and up to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.9 and up to about 1.0. In other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. In still other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.5, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.5. In yet other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.9, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.8, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.7, or greater than about 0.5 and up to about 0.6. [98]     For copolymers of ethylene and an a-olefin, the inventive polymers preferably possess (1) a PDI of at least 1.3, more preferably at least 1.5, at least 1.7, or at least 2.0, and most preferably at least 2.6, up to a maximum value of 5.0, more preferably up to a maximum of 3.5, and especially up to a maximum of 2.7; (2) a heat of fusion of 80 J/g or less; (3) an ethylene content of at least 50 weight percent; (4) a glass transition temperature, Tg&gt; of less than -25°C, more preferably less than -30°C, and/or (5) one and only one Tm. [99]     Further, the inventive polymers can have, alone or in combination with any other properties disclosed herein, a storage modulus, G', such that log (G') is greater than or equal to 400 kPa, preferably greater than or equal to 1.0 MPa, at a temperature of 100°C. Moreover, the inventive polymers possess a relatively flat storage modulus as a function of temperature in the range from 0 to 100°C (illustrated in Figure 6) that is characteristic of block copolymers, and heretofore unknown for an olefin copolymer, especially a copolymer of ethylene and one or more C3-8 aliphatic a-olefins. (By the term "relatively flat" in this context is meant that log G' (in Pascals) decreases by less than one order of magnitude between 50 and 100°C, preferably between 0 and 100°C).<br><br>
[100]   The inventive interpolymers may be further characterized by a thermomechanical analysis penetration depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 90°C as well as a flexural modulus of from 3 kpsi (20 MPa) to 13 kpsi (90 MPa). Alternatively, the inventive interpolymers can have a thermomechanical analysis penetration depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 104°C as well as a flexural modulus of at least 3 kpsi (20 MPa). They may be characterized as having an abrasion resistance (or volume loss) of less than 90 mm3. Figure 7 shows the TMA (1 mm) versus flex modulus for the inventive polymers, as compared to other known polymers. The inventive polymers have significantly better flexibility-heat resistance balance than the other polymers.<br>
[101]   Additionally, the ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymers can have a melt index, I2, from 0.01 to 2000 g/10 minutes, preferably from 0.01 to 1000 g/10 minutes, more preferably from 0.01 to 500 g/10 minutes, and especially from 0.01 to 100 g/10 minutes. In certain embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a melt index, I2, from 0.01 to 10 g/10 minutes, from 0.5 to 50 g/10 minutes, from 1 to 30 g/10 minutes, from 1 to 6 g/10 minutes or from 0.3 to 10 g/10 minutes. In certain embodiments, the melt index for the ethylene/a-olefm polymers is lg/10 minutes, 3 g/10 minutes or 5 g/10 minutes.<br>
[102]   The polymers can have molecular weights, MW) from 1,000 g/mole to 5,000,000 g/mole, preferably from 1000 g/mole to 1,000,000, more preferably from 10,000 g/mole to 500,000 g/mole, and especially from 10,000 g/mole to 300,000 g/mole. The density of the inventive polymers can be from 0.80 to 0.99 g/cm3 and preferably for ethylene containing polymers from 0.85 g/cm to 0.97 g/cm . In certain embodiments, the density of the ethylene/a-olefin polymers ranges from 0.860 to 0.925 g/cm3 or 0.867 to 0.910 g/cm3. [103]   The process of making the polymers has been disclosed in the following patent applications: U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/553,906, filed March 17, 2004; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,937, filed March 17, 2005; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,939, filed March 17, 2005; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/5662938, filed March 17, 2005; PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008916, filed March 17, 2005; PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008915, filed March 17, 2005; and PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008917, filed March 17, 2005, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. For example, one such method comprises contacting ethylene and optionally one or more addition polymerizable monomers other than ethylene under addition polvmerization conditions with a catalyst composition comprising: the admixture or reaction product resulting from combining:<br><br>
(A)	a first olefin polymerization catalyst having a high comonomer incorporation<br>
index,<br>
(B)	a second olefin polymerization catalyst having a comonomer incorporation index<br>
less than 90 percent, preferably less than 50 percent, most preferably less than 5 percent of<br>
the comonomer incorporation index of catalyst (A), and<br>
(C)	a chain shuttling agent.<br>
[104]   Representative catalysts and chain shuttling agent are as follows.<br>
Catalyst (Al) is [N-(2,6-di(l-methylethyl)phenyl)amido)(2-isopropylphenyl)(a-naphthalen-2-diyl(6-pyridin-2-diyl)methane)]hafhium dimethyl, prepared according to the teachings of WO 03/40195,2003US0204017, USSN 10/429,024, filed May 2, 2003, and WO 04/24740.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[114]   Shuttling Agents The shuttling agents employed include diethylzinc, di(i-butyl)zinc, di(n-hexyl)zinc, triethylaluminum, trioctylaluminum, triethylgallium, i-butylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxane), i-butylaluxninum bis(di(trimethylsilyl)amide)) n-octylaluminum di(pyridine-2-methoxide), bis(n-octadecyl)i-butylaluminum, i-butylaluminum bis(di(n-pentyl)amide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,6-di-t-butylphenoxide, n-octylaluminum di(ethyl(l-naphthyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(t-butyldimethylsiloxide), ethylaluminum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycIoheptaneamide), n-octylaluminumbis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxide, ethylzinc (2,6-diphenylphenoxide), and ethylzinc (t-butoxide). [115]   Preferably, the foregoing process takes the form of a continuous solution process for forming block copolymers, especially multi-block copolymers, preferably linear multi-block copolymers of two or more monomers, more especially ethylene and a C3.20 olefin or cycloolefm, and most especially ethylene and a C4-20 a-olefin, using multiple catalysts that are incapable of interconversion. That is, the catalysts are chemically distinct. Under continuous solution polymerization conditions, the process is ideally suited for polymerization 01 mixtures of monomers as high monother conversions underclass<br><br>
polymerization conditions, shuttling from the chain shuttling agent to the catalyst becomes advantaged compared to chain growth, and multi-block copolymers, especially linear multi-block copolymers are formed in high efficiency.<br>
[116]   The inventive interpolymers may be differentiated from conventional, random copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. In particular, compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the inventive interpolymers have better (higher) heat resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher high-temperature tensile strength, and/or higher high-temperature torsion storage modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Compared to a random copolymer containing the same monomers and monomer content, the inventive interpolymers have lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification) temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.<br>
[117]   The inventive interpolymers also exhibit a unique crystallization and branching distribution relationship. That is, the inventive interpolymers have a relatively large difference between the tallest peak temperature measured using CRYSTAF and DSC as a function of heat of fusion, especially as compared to random copolymers containing the same monomers and monomer level or physical blends of polymers, such as a blend of a high density polymer and a lower density copolymer, at equivalent overall density. It is believed that this unique feature of the inventive interpolymers is due to the unique distribution of the comonomer in blocks within the polymer backbone. In particular, the inventive interpolymers may comprise alternating blocks of differing comonomer content (including homopolymer blocks). The inventive interpolymers may also comprise a distribution in number and/or block size of polymer blocks of differing density or comonomer content, which is a Schultz-Flory type of distribution. In addition, the inventive interpolymers also have a unique peak melting point and crystallization temperature profile that is substantially independent of polymer density, modulus, and morphology. In a preferred embodiment, the microcrystalline order of the polymers demonstrates characteristic spherulites and lamellae<br><br>
that are distinguishable from random or block copolymers, even at PDI values that are less than 1.7, or even less than 1.5, down to less than 1.3.<br>
[118]   Moreover, the, inventive interpolymers may be prepared using techniques to influence the degree or level of blockiness. That is the amount of comonomer and length of each polymer block or segment can be altered by controlling the ratio and type of catalysts and shuttling agent as well as the temperature of the polymerization, and other polymerization variables. A surprising benefit of this phenomenon is the discovery that as the degree of blockiness is increased, the optical properties, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties of the resulting polymer are improved. In particular, haze decreases while clarity, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties increase as the average number of blocks in the polymer increases. By selecting shuttling agents and catalyst combinations having the desired chain transferring ability (high rates of shuttling with low levels of chain termination) other forms of polymer termination are effectively suppressed. Accordingly, little if any p-hydride elimination is observed in the polymerization of ethylene/ a-olefin comonomer mixtures according to embodiments of the invention, and the resulting crystalline blocks are highly, or substantially completely, linear, possessing little or no long chain branching.<br>
[119]   Polymers with highly crystalline chain ends can be selectively prepared in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In elastomer applications, reducing the relative quantity of polymer that terminates with an amorphous block reduces the intermolecular dilutive effect on crystalline regions. This result can be obtained by choosing chain shuttling agents and catalysts having an appropriate response to hydrogen or other chain terminating agents. Specifically, if the catalyst which produces highly crystalline polymer is more susceptible to chain termination (such as by use of hydrogen) than the catalyst responsible for producing the less crystalline polymer segment (such as through higher comonomer incorporation, regio-error, or atactic polymer formation), then the highly crystalline polymer segments will preferentially populate the terminal portions of the polymer. Not only are the resulting terminated groups crystalline, but upon termination, the highly crystalline polymer forming catalyst site is once again available for reinitiation of polymer formation. The initially formed polymer is therefore another highly crystalline polymer segment. Accordingly, both ends of the resulting multi-block copolymer are preferentially highly crystalline. [120]   The ethylene a-olefin interpolymers used in the embodiments of the invention are preferably interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C3-C20 a-olefm. Copolymers ot<br><br>
ethylene and a C3-C2O a-olefin are especially preferred. The interpolymers may further<br>
comprise C4-C18 diolefin and/or alkenylbenzene. Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful<br>
for polymerizing with ethylene include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, alkenylbenzenes. etc. Examples of such comonomers include C3-C20 ct -olefins such as propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene,<br>
1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and the like. 1-Butene and 1-octene are especially preferred. Other suitable monomers include styrene, halo-or alkyl-substituted styrenes, vinylbenzocyclobutane, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and naphthenics (e.g., cyclopentene, cyclohexene and cyclooctene).<br>
[121]   While ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are preferred polymers, other ethylene/olefin polymers may also be used. Olefins as used herein refer to a family of unsaturated hydrocarbon-based compounds with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Depending on the selection of catalysts, any olefin may be used in embodiments of the invention. Preferably, suitable olefins are C3-C20 aliphatic and aromatic compounds containing vinylic<br>
unsaturation, as well as cyclic compounds, such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene, and norbornene, including but not limited to, norbornene substituted in the 5 and 6 position with C1-C20 hydrocarbyl or cyclohydrocarbyl groups. Also included are mixtures of such olefins as well as mixtures of such olefins with C4-C40 diolefin compounds.<br>
[122]   Examples of olefin monomers include, but are not limited to propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene, l-eicosenes 3-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 4,6-dimethyl- 1-heptene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclohexane, norbornadiene, ethylidene norbornene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclooctene, C4-C40 dienes, including but not limited to 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, other C4-C40 a-olefins, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments, the a-olefin is propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or a combination thereof. Although any hydrocarbon containing a vinyl group potentially may be used in embodiments of the invention, practical issues such as monomer availability, cost,<br><br><br>
styrene, p-methyl styrene, t-butylstyrene, and the like. In particular, interpolymers comprising ethylene and styrene can be prepared by following the teachings herein. Optionally, copolymers comprising ethylene, styrene and a C3-C2O alpha olefin, optionally comprising a C4-C20 diene, having improved properties can be prepared.<br>
[124]   Suitable non-conjugated diene monomers can be a straight chain, branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, straight chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,6-octadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, branched chain acyclic dienes, such as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl- 1,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene, single ring alicyclic dienes, such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene; 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-cyclododecadiene, and multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes, such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo-(2,2,l)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbornene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene, 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbomene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and norbornadiene. Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB), and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). The especially preferred dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) and 1,4-hexadiene (HD).<br>
[125]   One class of desirable polymers that can be made in accordance with embodiments of the invention are elastomeric interpolymers of ethylene, a C3-C20 <x-olefin especially></x-olefin>
propylene, and optionally one or more diene monomers. Preferred a-olefins for use in this embodiment of the present invention are designated by the formula CH2=CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable a-olefms include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, and 1-octene. A particularly preferred a-olefin is propylene. The propylene based polymers are generally referred to in the art as EP or EPDM polymers. Suitable dienes for use in preparing such polymers, especially multi-block EPDM type polymers include conjugated or non-conjugated, straight or branched chain-, cyclic- or polycyclic- dienes comprising from 4 to 20 carbons. Preferred dienes include 1,4-pentadiene, 1.4-hexadiene. 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, and 5-butylidene-2-norbornene. A particularly preferred diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene.<br><br>
[126]   Because the diene containing polymers comprise alternating segments or blocks containing greater or lesser quantities of the diene (including none) and a-olefin (including none), the total quantity of diene and a-olefin may be reduced without loss of subsequent polymer properties. That is, because the diene and a-olefin monomers are preferentially incorporated into one type of block of the polymer rather than uniformly or randomly throughout the polymer, they are more efficiently utilized and subsequently the crosslink density of the polymer can be better controlled. Such crosslinkable elastomers and the cured products have advantaged properties, including higher tensile strength and better elastic recovery.<br>
[127]   In some embodiments, the inventive interpolymers made with two catalysts incorporating differing quantities of comonomer have a weight ratio of blocks formed thereby from 95:5 to 5:95. The elastomeric polymers desirably have an ethylene content of from 20 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 80 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Further preferably, the multi-block elastomeric polymers have an ethylene content of from 60 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 40 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Preferred polymers are high molecular weight polymers, having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to about 2,500,000, preferably from 20,000 to 500,000, more preferably from 20,000 to 350,000, and a polydispersity less than 3.5, more preferably less than 3.0, and a Mooney viscosity (ML (1+4) 125°C.) from 1 to 250. More preferably, such polymers have an ethylene content from 65 to 75 percent, a diene content from 0 to 6 percent, and an a-olefin content from 20 to 35 percent. [128]   The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers can be functionalized by incorporating at least one functional group in its polymer structure. Exemplary functional groups may include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acids, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acid anhydrides, salts thereof and esters thereof. Such functional groups may be grafted to an ethylene/ a -olefin interpolymer, or it may be copolymerized with ethylene and an optional additional comonomer to form an interpolymer of ethylene, the functional comonomer and optionally other comonomer(s). Means for grafting functional groups onto polyethylene are described for example in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,762,890, 4,927,888, and 4,950,541, the disclosures of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. One particularly useful functional group is malic anhydride.<br><br>
[129]   The amount of the functional group present in the functional interpolymer can vary. The functional group can typically be present in a copolymer-type functionalized interpolymer in an amount of at least about 1.0 weight percent, preferably at least about 5 weight percent, and more preferably at least about 7 weight percent. The functional group will typically be present in a copolymer-type functionalized interpolymer in an amount less than about 40 weight percent, preferably less than about 30 weight percent, and more preferably less than about 25 weight percent.<br>
[130]   In certain embodiments, the filled compositions provided herein comprise a blend of ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers of differing molecular weight and/or overall density. The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is present in an amount ranging from about 5% up to about 70% by total weight of the filled polymer composition. In certain embodiments, the amount of ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer ranges from about 5% up to about 60%, from about 10% up to about 50%, from about 15% up to about 40%, from about 20% up to about 30% by total weight of the filled polymer composition. In certain embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is present in about 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 12%, 10%, or 5% by total weight of the composition.<br>
Other polymers [131]   In certain embodiments, the polymer for use in the filled polymer compositions provided herein is a blend of an ethylene/ a -olefin interpolymer and other polymers known in the art for use in the filled polymer compositions for improvement of noise, vibration and harshness and for use in the wire, cable and roofing applications. Such polymers (also referred to as "other polymers" or "second polymer(s)") include, but are not limited to polyolefin resins; such as polyethylene and polypropylene; ethylene copolymers, such as ethylene-propylene copolymer and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate); terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and a nonconjugated diene (EPMD); polyvinyl chloride (PVC); mixed polymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate (EVA); styrene-butadiene mixed polymers (SBR); and mixtures of these materials with thermoplastic polymers, such as polystyrene and polyolefins; metallocene copolymers, substantially linear olefin polymers described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,272,236 and 5,278,272, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The amount of other polymers in the filled polymer compositions provided herein can range from about 0% up to about 70%, about 5% up to about 60%, about 10% up to about 50%, about 15% up to about 45%, about 20% up to about 40%, about 30% up to about 40% of the total weight polymer present in the composition. In certain embodiments, me amount oi me ouiei<br><br>
polymers in the composition is about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 60% or 70% of the total weight of the polymer.<br>
Component B: Filler [132]   A filler is used in the filled polymer compositions, for example, to provide mass which contributes to sound-deadening or other desirable properties. The filled polymer compositions provided herein are able to maintain desirable fabrication characteristics with high filler levels. The attainment of filler loadings of approximately 50 percent by volume, and above, while maintaining adequate mechanical properties is favorable to the formulation of economical compositions, and results in compositions particularly useful for sound management applications. Further, the compositions provided herein, in certain embodiments, can maintain desirable mechanical properties over a wide range of filler levels. [133]   Fillers which are useful in the compositions include, but are not limited to calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, talc, carbon black or graphite, flyash, cement dust, clay, feldspar, nepheline, silica or glass, fumed silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, glass fibers, nano-clays, zinc oxide, aluminum silicate, calcium silicate, titanium dioxide, titanates, glass microspheres and chalk. In certain embodiments, the filler is selected from calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. In certain embodiments, the filler is selected from aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. [134]   Ignition resistant fillers which can be used in the compositions include antimony oxide, decabromobiphenyl oxide, alumina trihydrate, magnesium hydroxide, borates, and halogenated compounds. Other miscellaneous fillers suitable for use in the compositions include wood fibers/flours/chips, ground rice hulls, cotton, starch, glass fibers, synthetic fibers (e.g., polyolefin fibers), and carbon fibers. Hydrated alumina can also be used as a filler to obtain blends which are flame retardant.<br>
[135]   The amount of the filler depends upon the filler density; the higher the filler density, the more of it which can be added to the formulation without appreciably affecting the volume fraction of that filler. The level of filler in a blend composition may be described by weight or volume. The volume percent of the filler may be estimated by the equation:<br>
vol %F =[(wt %F IpF) x 100%]/[(wt % F /p F)+S(wt %,• /p,)] Where vol % F is equal to the volume percent of the filler in the final composition, wt % F is equal to the weight percent of the filler; pF is the density of the filler measured in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3); wt %, is the weight percent of the ith component; p/ is the density of the ith component measured in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cmJ).<br><br>
[136]   Accordingly, the level of the filler is discussed herein in terms of weight percent filler, based on the total weight of the composition. Particle size of the filler has some effect on the amount of filler used in the compositions. Fine particle size fillers generally have a tendency to result in higher blend viscosities, and they are also more expensive. The use of fine filler, especially at high filler loading, results in a smoother extrudate surface when molten blend is extruded through a die orifice. The attendant benefits of using fine particle size filler in filled polymer compositions are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,196, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In the exemplary compositions provided herein, calcium carbonate used has a particle size between about 3.2 micron and about 8 micron.<br>
[137]   In certain embodiments, the use of many types of fillers or combination thereof is possible without altering the properties of the filled polymer compositions. For example, inclusion of alumina trihydrate (ATH, AI2O3.3H2O) is highly desirable when flame-retardant or low-smoke-tendency compositions are desired. Heavy fillers, such as powdered iron or lead, or oxides or shavings of them, can be employed when ultra-dense compositions are desired. Similarly, minerals having low density, such as magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium sulfate, silica, fly ash, and cement dust, or organic fillers such as yams, wood flour, nut shells, rice hulls, cornmeal, clay, and the like, can be employed when light-density compositions are needed. Finally, fillers with varied aspect ratios, such as talc, mica, from highly acicular (wollastonite, for example) to round (glass beads, for example) can also be employed to alter relationships such as tensile strength or elongation.<br>
[138]   The filler is present in an amount ranging from about 30% up to about 95% by total weight of the filled polymer compositions provided herein. In certain embodiments, the filler is present in an amount ranging from about 40% up to about 90%, from about 45% up to about 85%, from about 50% up to about 85%, from about 60% up to about 81% by total weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is present in about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 81%, 85%, 90% or 95% by total weight of the composition.<br>
Component C [139]   It may further be useful to employ any one or combination of plasticizing substances in the compositions provided herein. The plasticizer, when present in the compositions provided herein, can be selected from one of several groups. 1 he iirst group is a group<br><br>
known as processing oils. Three types of processing oils are known-paraffmic, aromatic, and naphthenic. Processing oils are also subdivided by viscosity range. "Thin" oils can be as low as 100-500 SUS (Saybolt Universal Seconds) at 100°F. (38 °C.) "Heavy" oils can be as high as 6000 SUS at 100 ° F. Processing oils, especially naphthenic and paraffmic oils with viscosity of from about 100 to 6000 SUS at 100°F are used in certain embodiments. [140]   The second group of plasticizers that are effective, when used in the compositions provided herein, is a group that comprises epoxidized oils such as epoxidized soybean oil and epoxidized linseed oil.<br>
[141]   The third group of plasticizers that can be used in the compositions herein, are polyesters which, in general are liquid condensation products of a polybasic acid and a polyol. The term "liquid" as used herein means pourable at room temperature. The acid component is most often a saturated aliphatic dibasic acid, or an aromatic dibasic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, phthalic acid, sebacic acid, and glutaric acid, or mixtures of these acids are commonly used. The polyol can be an aliphatic polyol or a poly-oxyalkylene polyol, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4- and 1,3-butane glycol, diethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol. In some embodiments, polyester compositions comprise an acid component of which greater than 50% by weight are aliphatic polyol, such as aliphatic glycol. Plasticizers based on adipic or azelaic acid, and propylene glycol or the 1,3- or 1,4- butane glycol can also be used herein. The molecular weight of these plasticizers can vary from a low of a few hundred up to a high of about 10,000. The molecular weight of commercial products is seldom specified; however, typically in the trade, the molecular weight range of the product is classified as low, medium, or high. A suitable range for the compositions herein can be medium.<br>
[142]   Mixtures of polyester or epoxidized oils with hydrocarbon oils are also effective plasticizers in certain of the compositions. One objective of using such a mixture is to couple the high efficiency of the relatively high cost polyester or epoxidized oil with the low cost of the hydrocarbon oil. The cost/performance of a compound plasticized with such a mixture can be improved significantly for a given application because properties can be tailored more precisely, or filler levels can be increased.<br>
[143]   Where a mixture of the polyester plasticizer and a hydrocarbon oil is employed, the relative proportions of the two components can be varied over a wide range depending upon performance objectives. Mixtures comprising 50% or less of the polyester are preferred for economic reasons, and most preferred are those comprising 20% or iess oi me polyester.<br><br>
[144]   A fourth group of plasticizers, polyethers and polyether esters, are also effective for the compositions provided herein. In general, polyethers are oligomers or polymers of alkylene oxides, polymers of ethylene or propylene oxide are the most common types available commercially. Polyethers can be prepared by polymerization of aldehydes using various types of catalysts, or by acid or base catalyzed polymerization of an alkylene oxide, for example. Polyethers can be terminated by hydroxyl groups to form the diol (glycol) or, in the case of adducts of alkylene oxides with glycerol, for example, the triol, and so forth. The hydroxyl terminated polyether can also be reacted with an acid, fatty acids such as lauric and stearic acids are common examples of the compounds are the mono-and diesters of polyethylene or polypropylene glycol. The molecular weight of polyethers may range up to those typical of high polymers.<br>
[145]   In certain embodiments, the polyethers are those consisting of polyols based on random and/or block copolymers of ethylene oxides and propylene oxides. The copolymer polyols provide better performance in terms of efficiency in compositions comprising very high levels of filler.<br>
[146]   Mixture of the polyether or the polyether ester plasticizers with either a polyester plasticizer or a hydrocarbon processing oil can also be used in the compositions provided. The advantage of polyether/polyester combination is the lower cost since the polyethers are cheaper than the polyesters. Combinations of polyether and processing oil are also cheaper because of the lower cost of the oil.<br>
[147]   The reactive portions of the two components in a polyether/polyester combination will be adjusted according to the efficiency of the system based on property requirements and cost. Those based on polyester primarily will not be as stiff and will be more expensive, for example, than those based primarily on a polyether or polyether ester. [148]   Where a mixture of the polyether or polyether ester and a hydrocarbon oil is employed, the relative proportions used will again depend on cost and property requirements. Since the polyethers are more expensive than the processing oils, mixtures comprising 50% or less of the polyethers are preferred.<br>
[149]   In certain embodiments, the plasticizer is selected from the group consisting of phthalate esters, trimellitate esters, benzoates, aliphatic diesters (including adipates azelates and sebacates), epoxy compounds, phosphate esters, glutarates, polymeric plasticizers (polyesters of glycols and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids) and oils. In certain embodiments, the<br><br>
plasticizer used in the compositions herein is a mixture of paraffinic process oil and stearic acid.<br>
[150]   As referred to above, a mixture of processing oil, on the one hand, and epoxidized oil or polyester or poiyether or polyether ester, or any combination thereof, on the other hand, can also be used very effectively as the plasticizer for the compositions provided herein. In fact, such a two- or more component plasticizer system, comprising from about 50 to about 95 percent by total weight of processing oil, gives higher tensile elongation than can be obtained using either plasticizer alone at the same level. Maximum elongation can be achieved using a mixture of processing oil and polyester or polyether or polyether ester or any combination thereof containing from about 50 to about 80 percent by total weight of processing oil.<br>
[151]   The amount of plasticizer in the composition varies from about 0% up to about 15% or about 10% by total weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the plasticizer is present in from about 1% up to about 9%, 2% up to about 8%, 3% up to about 8%, 4% up to about 6% by total weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the plasticizer is present in about 2%, 3%, 4%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 6.5%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10% by total weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the plasticizer present is less than 1% by total weight of the composition.<br>
Component D: Additives [152]   Optionally, the filled polymer compositions provided herein can comprise at least one additive for the purposes of improving and/or controlling the processibility, appearance, physical, chemical, and/or mechanical properties of the composition. However, an additive does not function as a filler as described above. In some embodiments, the filled polymer compositions may include one or more of the additives described herein. In other embodiments, the filled polymer compositions may be substantially or completely free of one or more of the additives described herein.<br>
[153]   Any polymer additive known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be used in the filled polymer compositions provided herein. Various additives for use in the filled polymer compositions are listed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,787,593; 5,973,049; 6,319,969; 3,904,456; 4,191,798; 4,24,2395; 4,263,196; 4,438,228; 6,254,956 and 6,262,161, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Non-limiting examples of suitable additives include anti-blocking agents, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, colorants or pigments, cross-linking agents, flame retardants, antistatic agents, and combinations thereof.  I he lotal<br><br>
amount of the additives can range from about greater than 0 to about 80%, from about 0.001 % to about 70%, from about 0.01 % to about 60%, from about 0.1 % to about 50%, from about 1 % to about 40%, or from about 10 % to about 50% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition . Some polymer additives have been described in Zweifel Hans et aL, "Plastics Additives Handbook" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [154]   In formulating the filled polymer composition, it is preferable that each of the additives are compatible with the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer used herein so that the additives do not phase separate from the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, particularly in molten state. In general, the compatibility of an additive with the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer increases with a decrease in the difference between their solubility parameters such as Hildebrand solubility parameters.   Some Hildebrand solubility parameters are tabulated for solvents in: Barton, A. F. M., Handbook of Solubility and Other Cohesion Parameters, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL (1991); for monomers and representative polymers in Polymer Handbook, 3rd Ed.? J. Brandrup &amp; E. H. Immergut, Eds. John Wiley, NY, pages 519-557 (1989); and for many commercially available polymers in Barton, A. F. M., Handbook of Polymer-Liquid Interaction Parameters and Solubility Parameters, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL (1990), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Hildebrand solubility parameter for a copolymer may be calculated using a volume fraction weighting of the individual Hildebrand solubility parameters for each monomer containing the copolymer, as described for binary copolymers in Barton A. F. M., Handbook of Solubility Parameters and Other Cohesion Parameters, CRC Press, Boca Raton, page 12 (1990).   The magnitude of the Hildebrand solubility parameter for polymeric materials is also known to be weakly dependent upon the molecular weight of the polymer, as noted in Barton, pages 446-448.   Therefore, there will be a preferred molecular weight range for a given ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, and adhesive strength may be additionally controlled by manipulating the molecular weight of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer or the additives. In some embodiments, the absolute difference in Hildebrand solubility parameter between the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer and an additive such as the antioxidant falls within the range of greater than 0 to about 10 MPa1/2, about 0.1 to about 5 MPal/2, about 0.5 to about 4.0 MPaI/2, or about 1 to about 3.0 MPa1/2.<br>
[155]   The antioxidant or a stabilizer for use in the filled polymer composition herein includes any antioxidant known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Non-limiting<br><br>
examples of suitable antioxidants include amine-based antioxidants such as alkyl diphenylamines, phenyl-a- naphthylamine, alkyl or aralkyl substituted phenyl-a-naphthylamine, alkylated p-phenylene diamines, tetramethyl-diaminodiphenylamine and the like; and hindered phenol compounds such as 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol; 1,3,5-trimethyl-254,6-tris(3,,5'-di-t-butyl-4,-hydroxybenzyl)benzene;tetrakis[(methylene(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]methane (e.g., IRGANOX™ 1010, from Ciba Geigy, New York); octadecyl-3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxycinnamate (e.g., IRGANOX     1076, commercially available from Ciba Geigy) and combinations thereof. Where used, the amount of the antioxidant in the filled polymer composition can be from about greater than 0 to about 10 wt%, from about 0.1 to about 5 wt%, or from about 0.5 to about 2 wt% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition.<br>
[156]   In certain embodiments, the filled polymer compositions disclosed herein comprise an UV stabilizer that may prevent or reduce the degradation of the filled polymer compositions by UV radiations.   Any UV stabilizer known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be used herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable UV stabilizers include benzophenones, benzotriazoles, aryl esters, oxanilides, acrylic esters, formamidine carbon black, hindered amines, nickel quenchers, hindered amines, phenolic antioxidants, metallic salts, zinc compounds and combinations thereof. Where used, the amount of the UV stabilizer in the composition can be from about greater than 0 to about 10 wt%, from about 0.1 to about 5 wt%, or from about 0.5 to about 2 wt% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition. [157]   Optionally, the filled polymer compositions provided herein comprise an antiblocking agent. The anti-blocking agent can be used to prevent the undesirable adhesion between touching layers of articles comprising the polymer composition particularly under moderate pressure and heat during storage, manufacture or use. Any anti-blocking agent known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the filled polymer compositions provided herein. Non-limiting examples of anti-blocking agents include minerals (e.g., clays, chalk, and calcium carbonate), synthetic silica gel (e.g., SYLOBLOC® from Grace Davison, Columbia, MD), natural silica (e.g., SUPER FLOSS® from Celite Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA), talc (e.g., OPTIBLOC® from Luzenac, Centennial, CO), zeolites (e.g., SIPERNAT® from Degussa, Parsippany, NJ), aluminosilicates (e.g., SILTON® from Mizusawa Industrial Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), limestone (e.g., CARBOREX® from Omya, Atlanta, GA), spherical polymeric particles (e.g., EPOSTAR®, poly(methyl methacrylate) particles from Nippon Shokubai, Tokyo, Japan and TOSPEARL^, silicone<br><br>
particles from GE Silicones, Wilton, CT), waxes, amides {e.g. erucamide, oleamide, stearamide, behenamide, ethylene-bis-stearamide, ethylene-bis-oleamide, stearyl erucamide and other slip agents), molecular sieves, and combinations thereof. The mineral particles can lower blocking by creating a physical gap between articles, while the organic anti-blocking agents can migrate to the surface to limit surface adhesion. Where used, the amount of the anti-blocking agent in the filled polymer compositions can be from about greater than 0 to about 3 wt%, from about 0.0001 to about 2 wt%, from about 0.001 to about 1 wt%, or from about 0.001 to about 0.5 wt% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition. Some anti-blocking agents have been described in Zweifel Hans et a/., "Plastics Additives Handbook" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 7, pages 585-600 (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[158]   In further embodiments, the filled polymer compositions provided herein optionally comprise a colorant or pigment that can change the look of the filled polymer composition to human eyes.

[159]   Optionally, the filled polymer compositions proposed herein can comprise a lubricant. In general, the lubricant can be used, inter alia, to modify the rheology of the molten filled polymer compositions, to improve the surface finish of molded articles, and/or to facilitate the dispersion of fillers or pigments. Any lubricant known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the filled polymer compositions disclosed herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable lubricants include fatty alcohols and their dicarboxylic acid esters, fatty acid esters of short-chain alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid amides, metal soaps, oligomeric fatty acid esters, fatty acid esters of long-chain alcohols, moltan waxes, polyethylene waxes, polypropylene waxes, natural and synthetic paraffin waxes, fluoropolymers and combinations thereof. Where used, the amount of the lubricant in the filled polymer composition can be from about greater than 0 to about 5 wt%, from about 0.1 to about 4 wt%, or from about 0.1 to about 3 wt% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition. Some suitable lubricants have been disclosed in Zweifel Hans et al., "Plastics Additives Handbook" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 5, pages 511-552 (2001), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[160]   Optionally, the filled polymer compositions provided herein can comprise an antistatic agent. Generally, the antistatic agent can increase the conductivity of the filled polymer compositions and can prevent static charge accumulation. Any antistatic agent known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the filled polymer compositions provided herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable antistatic agents include conductive fillers (e.g., carbon black, metal particles and other conductive particles), fatty acid esters (e.g., glycerol monostearate), ethoxylated alkylamines, diethanolamides, ethoxylated alcohols, alkylsulfonates, alkylphosphates, quaternary ammonium salts, alkylbetaines and combinations thereof. Where used, the amount of the antistatic agent in the filled polymer composition can be from about greater than 0 to about 5 wt%, from about 0.01 to about 3 wt%, or from about 0.1 to about 2 wt% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition. Some suitable antistatic agents have been disclosed in Zweifel Hans et aL, "Plastics Additives Handbook," Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 10, pages 627-646 (2001), both of which are incorporated herein by reference. [161]   In further embodiments, the filled polymer compositions provided herein optionally comprise a cross-linking agent that can be used to increase the cross-iniKing aeiiMiy oi ihc<br><br>
filled polymer compositions. Any cross-linking agent known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be added to the filled polymer compositions herein. Non-limiting examples of suitable cross-linking agents include organic peroxides (e.g., alkyl peroxides, aryl peroxides, peroxyesters, peroxycarbonates, diacylperoxides, peroxy-ketals, and cyclic peroxides) and silanes (e.g., vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyl-triethoxysilane, vinyltris(2-methoxyethoxy)silane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, vinyl-methyldimethoxysilane, and 3-<br>
methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). Where used, the amount of the cross-linking agent in the filled polymer composition can be from about greater than 0 to about 20 wt%, from about 0.1 to about 15 wt%, or from about 1 to about 10 wt% of the total weight of the filled polymer composition . Some suitable cross-linking agents have been disclosed in Zweifel Hans et aL, "Plastics Additives Handbook" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio, 5th edition, Chapter 14, pages 725-812 (2001), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[162]   The cross-linking of the filled polymer compositions can also be initiated by any radiation means known in the art, including, but not limited to, electron-beam irradiation, beta irradiation, gamma irradiation, corona irradiation, and UV radiation with or without cross-linking catalyst. U.S. Patent Application No. 10/086,057 (published as US2002/0132923 Al) and U.S. Patent No. 6,803,014 disclose electron-beam irradiation methods that can be used in certain embodiments.<br>
[163]   Irradiation may be accomplished by the use of high energy, ionizing electrons, ultra violet rays, X-rays, gamma rays, beta particles and the like and combination thereof. Preferably, electrons are employed up to 70 megarads dosages. The irradiation source can be any electron beam generator operating in a range from about 150 kilovolts to about 6 megavolts with a power output capable of supplying the desired dosage. The voltage can be adjusted to appropriate levels which may be, for example, 100,000, 300,000,1,000,000 or 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 or 6,000,000 or higher or lower. Many other ways for irradiating polymeric materials are known in the art. The irradiation is usually carried out at a dosage between about 3 megarads to about 35 megarads, preferably between about 8 to about 20 megarads. Further, the irradiation can be carried out conveniently at room temperature, although higher and lower temperatures, for example 0° C to about 60° C, may also be employed. Preferably, the irradiation is carried out after shaping or fabrication of the article. Also, in a preferred embodiment, the ethylene interpolymer which has been incorporated with a pro-rad additive is irradiated with electron beam radiation at about 8 to aboui 20 megaraas.<br><br>
[164]   Crosslinking can be promoted with a crosslinking catalyst, and any catalyst that will provide this function can be used. Suitable catalysts generally include organic bases, carboxylic acids, and organometallic compounds including organic titanates and complexes or carboxylates of lead, cobalt, iron, nickel, zinc and tin. Dibutyltindilaurate, dioctyltinmaleate, dibutyltindiacetate, dibutyltindioctoate, stannous acetate, stannous octoate, lead naphthenate, zinc caprylate, cobalt naphthenate; and the like. Tin carboxylate, especially dibutyltindilaurate and dioctyltinmaleate, are particularly effective for this invention. The catalyst (or mixture of catalysts) is present in a catalytic amount, typically between about 0.015 and about 0.035 phr.<br>
[165]   Representative pro-rad additives include, but are not limited to, azo compounds, organic peroxides and polyfunctional vinyl or allyl compounds such as, for example, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, pentaerthritol tetramethacrylate, glutaraldehyde, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl maleate, dipropargyl maleate, dipropargyl monoallyl cyanurate, dicumyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate, benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl peroctoate, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butyl peroxy)hexane, lauryl peroxide, tert-butyl peracetate, azobisisobutyl nitrite and the like and combination thereof. Preferred pro-rad additives for use in the present invention are compounds which have poly-functional (i.e. at least two) moieties such as C=C, C=N or C=0.<br>
[166]   At least one pro-rad additive can be introduced to the ethylene interpolyrner by any method known in the art. However, preferably the pro-rad additive(s) is introduced via a masterbatch concentrate containing the same or different base resin as the ethylene interpolyrner. Preferably, the pro-rad additive concentration for the masterbatch is relatively high e.g., about 25 weight percent (based on the total weight of the concentrate). [167]   The at least one pro-rad additive is introduced to the ethylene polymer in any effective amount. Preferably, the at least one pro-rad additive introduction amount is from about 0.001 to about 5 weight percent, more preferably from about 0.005 to about 2.5 weight percent and most preferably from about 0.015 to about 1 weight percent (based on the total weight of the ethylene interpolyrner.<br>
[168]   In addition to electron-beam irradiation, crosslinking can also be effected by UV irradiation. U.S. Patent No. 6,709,742 discloses a cross-linking method by UV irradiation which can be used in embodiments of the invention. The method comprises mixing a photoinitiator, with or without a photocrosslinker, with a polymer before, during, or after a<br><br>
fiber is formed and then exposing the fiber with the photoinitiator to sufficient UV radiation to crosslink the polymer to the desired level. The photoinitiators used in the practice of the invention are aromatic ketones, e.g., benzophenones or monoacetals of 1,2-diketones. The primary photoreaction of the monacetals is the homolytic cleavage of the a-bond to give acyl and dialkoxyalkyl radicals. This type of a-cleavage is known as a Norrish Type I reaction which is more fully described in W. Horspool and D. Armesto, Organic Photochemistry: A Comprehensive Treatment Ellis Horwood Limited, Chichester, England, 1992; J. Kopecky, Organic Photochemistry: A Visual Approach. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, NY 1992; N.J. Turro, et al., Ace. Chem. Res., 1972, 5, 92; and J.T. Banks, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 2473. The synthesis of monoacetals of aromatic 1,2 diketones, Ar-CO-C(OR)2-Ar' is described in USP 4,190,602 and Ger. Offen. 2,337,813. The preferred compound from this class is 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, C6H5-CO-C(OCH3)2-C6H5, which is commercially available from Ciba-Geigy as Irgacure 651. Examples of other aromatic ketones useful in the practice of this invention as photoinitiators are Irgacure 184, 369, 819, 907 and 2959, all available from Ciba-Geigy.<br>
[169]   In one embodiment of the invention, the photoinitiator is used in combination with a photocrosslinker. Any photocrosslinker that will upon the generation of free radicals, link two or more polyolefm backbones together through the formation of covalent bonds with the backbones can be used in this invention. Preferably these photocrosslinkers are polyfunctional, i.e., they contain two or more sites that upon activation will form a covalent bond with a site on the backbone of the copolymer. Representative photocrosslinkers include, but are not limited to polyfunctional vinyl or allyl compounds such as, for example, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, pentaerthritol tetramethacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl maleate, dipropargyl maleate, dipropargyl monoallyl cyanurate and the like. Preferred photocrosslinkers for use in the present invention are compounds which have polyfunctional (i.e. at least two) moieties. Particularly preferred photocrosslinkers are triallycyanurate (TAC) and triallylisocyanurate (TAIC).<br>
[170]   Certain compounds act as both a photoinitiator and a photocrosslinker in the practice of this invention. These compounds are characterized by the ability to generate two or more reactive species (e.g., free radicals, carbenes, nitrenes, etc.) upon exposure to UV-light and to subsequently covalently bond with two polymer chains. Any compound that can preform these two functions can be used in the practice of this invention, and representative compounds include the sulfonyl azides described in USP 6,211,302 and 6,284,842.<br><br>
[171]   In another embodiment of this invention, the copolymer is subjected to secondary crosslinking, i.e., crosslinking other than and in addition to photocrosslinking. In this embodiment, the photoinitiator is used either in combination with a nonphotocrosslinker, e.g., a silane, or the copolymer is subjected to a secondary crosslinking procedure, e.g, exposure to E-beam radiation. Representative examples of silane crosslinkers are described in USP 5,824,718, and crosslinking through exposure to E-beam radiation is described in USP 5,525,257 and 5,324,576. The use of a photocrosslinker in this embodiment is optional [172]   At least one photoadditive, i.e., photoinitiator and optional photocrosslinker, can be introduced to the copolymer by any method known in the art. However, preferably the photoadditive(s) is (are) introduced via a masterbatch concentrate containing the same or different base resin as the copolymer. Preferably ,the photoadditive concentration for the masterbatch is relatively high e.g., about 25 weight percent (based on the total weight of the concentrate).<br>
[173] The at least one photoadditive is introduced to the copolymer in any effective amount. Preferably, the at least one photoadditive introduction amount is from about 0.001 to about 5, more preferably from about 0.005 to about 2,5 and most preferably from about 0.015 to about 1 wt % (based on the total weight of the copolymer).<br>
[174]   The photoinitiator(s) and optional photocrosslinker(s) can be added during different stages of the fiber or film manufacturing process. If photoadditives can withstand the extrusion temperature, a polyolefin resin can be mixed with additives before being fed into the extruder, e.g., via a masterbatch addition. Alternatively, additives can be introduced into the extruder just prior the slot die, but in this case the efficient mixing of components before extrusion is important. In another approach, polyolefin fibers can be drawn without photoadditives, and a photoinitiator and/or photocrosslinker can be applied to the extruded fiber via a kiss-roll, spray, dipping into a solution with additives, or by using other industrial methods for post-treatment. The resulting fiber with photoadditive(s) is then cured via electromagnetic radiation in a continuous or batch process. The photo additives can be blended with the polyolefin using conventional compounding equipment, including single and twin-screw extruders.<br>
[175]   The power of the electromagnetic radiation and the irradiation time are chosen so as to allow efficient crosslinking without polymer degradation and/or dimensional defects. The preferred process is described in EP 0 490 854 Bl. Photoadditive(s) with sufficient thermal stability is (are) premixed with a polyolefin resin, extruded into a fiber, and irradiated in a<br><br>
continuous process using one energy source or several units linked in a series. There are several advantages to using a continuous process compared with a batch process to cure a fiber or sheet of a knitted fabric which are collected onto a spool. [176]   Irradiation may be accomplished by the use of UV-radiation. Preferably, UV-radiation is employed up to the intensity of 100 J/cm . The irradiation source can be any UV-light generator operating in a range from about 50 watts to about 25000 watts with a power output capable of supplying the desired dosage. The wattage can be adjusted to appropriate levels which may be, for example, 1000 watts or 4800 watts or 6000 watts or higher or lower. Many other apparati for UV-irradiating polymeric materials are known in the art. The irradiation is usually carried out at a dosage between about 3 J/cm to about 500 J/scm ',<br>
•y	fpreferably between about 5 J/cm to about 100 J/cm . Further, the irradiation can be carried out conveniently at room temperature, although higher and lower temperatures, for example 0°C to about 60°C, may also be employed. The photocrosslinking process is faster at higher temperatures. Preferably, the irradiation is carried out after shaping or fabrication of the article. In a preferred embodiment, the copolymer which has been incorporated with a photoadditive is irradiated with UV-radiation at about 10 J/cm to about 50 J/cm .<br>
Preparation of the Filled Polymer Compositions [177]   The filled polymer compositions provided herein comprise an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, a filler and optionally plasticizer and other additives. The blending of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer with the filler and additives can be done by any known method that can result in a substantially homogeneous distribution of the components in the compositions. Non-limiting examples of suitable blending methods include melt blending, solvent blending, and the like.<br>
[178]   Physical blending devices that provide dispersive mixing, distributive mixing, or a combination of dispersive and distributive mixing can be useful in preparing homogenous blends. Both batch and continuous methods of physical blending can be used. Non-limiting examples of batch methods include those methods using BRABENDER® mixing equipments (e.g., BRABENDER PREP CENTER®, available from C. W. Brabender Instruments, Inc., South Hackensack, N.J.) or BANBURY® internal mixing and roll milling (available from Farrel Company, Ansonia, Conn.) equipment. Non-limiting examples of continuous methods include single screw extruding, twin screw extruding, disk extruding, reciprocating single screw extruding, and pin barrel single screw extruding.<br><br>
[179]   A commercial sized batch-type Banbury or equivalent intensive mixer is entirely suitable for preparing the compositions provided herein. A Farrel continuous mixer ("FCM") is also a good mixing device. In either instance, dry ingredients are charged in routine fashion. It is convenient in most cases to inject the plasticizer component directly into the mixing chamber of either unit as per widely used practice with this type of equipment. When more than one plasticizer is used, and where any one of the plasticizers is present in a small amount (less than about 10 weight percent of the total plasticizer mixture), the plasticizers should be preblended before addition to the other ingredients of the present invention. This will facilitate uniform distribution of each plasticizer component in the final compression and thus ensure that optimum properties are obtained. If desired, the copolymer and the plasticizer(s) can be precompounded as a "Master batch" in a suitable intensive mixing device (e.g., Banbury mixer or screw extruder). This "Masterbatch" can then be compounded with the filler and the other remaining ingredients to produce the final composition. A mix cycle of, for example, about 3 minutes is generally adequate for the Banbury mixer at an operating temperature usually between, for example, 325° and 375°K The operating rate for the FCM unit generally will fall within ranges predicted by literature prepared by the Farrel Company, Ansonia, Conn. Again, temperatures between 325 ° and 375 °F are effective. In both cases, a very low plasticizer level, say about 2-3%, may require higher temperatures, while plasticizer levels above about 7% may mix well at lower mixer temperatures. Other devices for compounding of viscous mixes (MI of 0.1 to 20) should be entirely satisfactory. [180]   Once blends are mixed, routine commercial practices may be used, such as underwater melt cutting plus drying or use of sheeting plus chopping methods, to produce a final pelletized product.<br>
Applications of the Filled Polymer Compositions [181]   In general, there are three ways in which sound can be minimized or "managed." The sound waves can be blocked, the vibrations can be damped, or the noise can be absorbed. To manage sound in these various ways, articles with different characteristics are required. [182]   The compositions provided herein are amenable to a wide range of fabricating techniques for the production of economic sound management articles. They may be manipulated, by adjusting the amounts and types of components, such that they are easily molded. The compositions disclosed herein can be fabricated into films, including blown films, sheets, moldings, foam sheet, foam plank, expandable and foamable particles, moldable foam beads, and injection molded articles by conventional processes.  The<br><br>
compositions can also be used in the manufacture of fibers, foams and lattices, as well as adhesive and sealant formulations.<br>
[183]   The compositions provided herein can be formed into articles by any suitable means known in the art and may be employed in any application in which the desired properties are useful. Included in the available means for forming the compositions disclosed herein are virtually any types of molding, extruding, calendering or casting. In certain embodiments, the filled polymer compositions provided herein can be used in sheeting field, particularly for low-cost, noise, vibration and harshness improving applications.<br>
[184] In certain embodiments, the filled polymer compositions provided herein can readily be extruded onto a substrate, such as an automotive carpet, or can be extruded or calendared as unsupported film or sheet. Depending on the equipment used, and the compounding techniques employed, it is possible to extrude wide ranges of film thickness, from below 20 mils to above 100 mils. This, then provides industry with an opportunity to vary the amount of sound deadening to be attained by varying film thickness, density of blends, ratio of filler load to binder, and similar techniques well known in the art.<br>
[185]   The sound-deadening sheet produced may be used in various ways including, but not limited to, extruded sheet to be used as a moldable sound barrier in sound deadening applications including transport systems such as automobiles, motor cycles, buses, tractors, trains, trams, aeroplanes, and the like, automotive door and truck liners, rear seat strainers, wheel well covers, carpet under layments, molded dash insulators, dash mats, construction, wallpapers/coverings, and paper/textiles industries, small and large appliances, including dishwashers, refrigerators, air conditioners, and the like, household items like blender housings, power tools, lawn and garden items like leaf blowers, snow blowers, small engines like outboard motors, jet ski's, and the like. Additional applications are apparent one of skill in the art and include devices for modifying the sound of a drum, loudspeaker systems, composite sound walls, acoustically damped disc drive systems, mufflers, thermoformable acoustical mat compositions, sound damping units for vacuum cleaning machines, systems for reducing drag and noise of underwater vehicles, automotive headliners having improved sound management characteristics, sound damped automotive enclosures such as oil pans, high heat, sound damping metal-polymer laminates, molded carpet assemblies with sound deadening backing, vibration-damping constrained-layer constructions, conveyor belts and material transfer systems, sound insulation moldable carpets, non-squeal disc brake pads, and the like. Further applications include coatings for wires and cables in a variety of electronic,<br><br>
telecommunications and similar areas in which cable or wire coatings are desirable. In sheet form, the filled polymer compositions can be used as drapes or hanging to shield or to surround a noisy piece of factory equipment such as a loom, a forging press, etc. In laminated sheet form (including coextruded structures), the filled compositions provided herein, faced with another material, can be used to achieve both a decorative and a functional use, such as dividing panels in an open-format office.<br>
[186]   In general, extrusion is a process by which a polymer is propelled continuously along a screw through regions of high temperature and pressure where it is melted and compacted, and finally forced through a die. The extruder can be a single screw extruder, a multiple screw extruder, a disk extruder or a ram extruder. The die can be a film die, blown film die, sheet die, pipe die, tubing die or profile extrusion die. The extrusion of polymers has been described in C. Rauwendaal, "Polymer Extrusion", Hanser Publishers, New York, NY (1986); and M.J. Stevens, "Extruder Principals and Operation" Ellsevier Applied Science Publishers, New York, NY (1985), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>

EXAMPLES Testing Methods<br>
[188]   In the examples that follow, the following analytical techniques are employed: GPC Method for Samples 1*4 and A-C<br>
[189]   An automated liquid-handling robot equipped with a heated needle set to 160°C is used to add enough 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol to each dried polymer sample to give a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. A small glass stir rod is placed into each tube and the samples are heated to 160°C for 2 hours on a heated, orbital-shaker rotating at 250 rpm. The concentrated polymer solution is then diluted to 1 mg/ml using the automated liquid-handling robot and the heated needle set to 160°C.<br><br>
[190]   A Symyx Rapid GPC system is used to determine the molecular weight data for each sample. A Gilson 350 pump set at 2.0 ml/min flow rate is used to pump helium-purged 1,2-dichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol as the mobile phase through three Plgel 10 micrometer (\xm) Mixed B 300mm x 7.5mm columns placed in series and heated to 160°C. A Polymer Labs ELS 1000 Detector is used with the Evaporator set to 250°C, the Nebulizer set to 165°C, and the nitrogen flow rate set to 1.8 SLM at a pressure of 60-80 psi (400-600 kPa) N2. The polymer samples are heated to 160°C and each sample injected into a 250 |il loop using the liquid-handling robot and a heated needle. Serial analysis of the polymer samples using two switched loops and overlapping injections are used. The sample data is collected and analyzed using Symyx Epoch™ software. Peaks are manually integrated and the molecular weight information reported uncorrected against a polystyrene standard calibration curve.<br>
Standard CRYSTAF Method [191]   Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain. The samples are dissolved in 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene at 160°C (0.66 mg/mL) for 1 hr and stabilized at 95 °C for 45 minutes. The sampling temperatures range from 95 to 30°C at a cooling rate of 0.2°C/min. An infrared detector is used to measure the polymer solution concentrations. The cumulative soluble concentration is measured as the polymer crystallizes while the temperature is decreased. The analytical derivative of the cumulative profile reflects the short chain branching distribution of the polymer. [192]   The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included in the CRYSTAF Software (Version 2001 .b, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain). The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW/dT curve and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. To calculate the CRYSTAF curve, the preferred processing parameters are with a temperature limit of 70°C and with smoothing parameters above the temperature limit of 0.1, and below the temperature limit of 0.3.<br>
DSC Standard Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C) [193]   Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using a TAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml/min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at about 175°C and then air-cooied to room temperature (25UC). 3-10 mg oi material is then cut<br><br>
into a 6 mm diameter disk, accurately weighed, placed in a light aluminum pan (ca 50 mg), and then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180°C and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thermal history. The sample is then cooled to -40°C at 10°C/min cooling rate and held at -40°C for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150 °C at 10°C/min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded. [194]   The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate (W/g) with respect to the linear baseline drawn between -30°C and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between -30°C and the end of melting using a linear baseline.<br>
GPC Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C) [195]   The gel permeation chromatographic system consists of either a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-210 or a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-220 instrument. The column and carousel compartments are operated at 140 °C. Three Polymer Laboratories 10-micron Mixed-B columns are used. The solvent is 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene. The samples are prepared at a concentration of 0.1 grains of polymer in 50 milliliters of solvent containing 200 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Samples are prepared by agitating lightly for 2 hours at 160°C. The injection volume used is 100 microliters and the flow rate is 1.0 ml/minute. [196]   Calibration of the GPC column set is performed with 21 narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 8,400,000, arranged in 6 "cocktail" mixtures with at least a decade of separation between individual molecular weights. The standards are purchased from Polymer Laboratories (Shropshire, UK). The polystyrene standards are prepared at 0.025 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights equal to or greater than 1,000,000, and 0.05 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights less than 1,000,000. The polystyrene standards are dissolved at 80°C with gentle agitation for 30 minutes. The narrow standards mixtures are run first and in order of decreasing highest molecular weight component to minimize degradation. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation (as described in Williams and Ward, J. Polym. ScL<br>
Polym. Let., 6, 621 (1968)):   Mpo|yethylene = 0.431(Mpo]yStyrene).<br>
[197]   Polyethylene equivalent molecular weight calculations are performed using Viscotek TriSEC software Version 3.0.<br><br>
Compression Set<br>
[198]   Compression set is measured according to ASTM D 395. The sample is prepared by stacking 25.4 mm diameter round discs of 3.2 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.25 mm thickness until a total thickness of 12.7 mm is reached. The discs are cut from 12.7 cm x 12.7 cm compression molded plaques molded with a hot press under the following conditions: zero pressure for 3 min at 190°C, followed by 86 MPa for 2 min at 190°C, followed by cooling inside the press with cold running water at 86 MPa.<br>
Density [199]   Samples for density measurement are prepared according to ASTM D 1928. Measurements are made within one hour of sample pressing using ASTM D792, Method B.<br>
Flexurai/Secant Modulus/ Storage Modulus [200]   Samples are compression molded using ASTM D 1928. Flexural and 2 percent secant moduli are measured according to ASTM D-790. Storage modulus is measured according to ASTM D 5026-01 or equivalent technique.<br>
Optical properties [201] Films of 0.4 mm thickness are compression molded using a hot press (Carver Model #4095-4PR1001R). The pellets are placed between polytetrafluoroethylene sheets, heated at 190 °C at 55 psi (380 kPa) for 3 min, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 min, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 min. The film is then cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for 1 min. The compression molded films are used for optical measurements, tensile behavior, recovery, and stress relaxation.<br>
[202]   Clarity is measured using BYK Gardner Haze-gard as specified in ASTM D 1746. [203]   45° gloss is measured using BYK Gardner Glossmeter Microgloss 45° as specified in ASTM D-2457<br>
[204]   Internal haze is measured using BYK Gardner Haze-gard based on ASTM D 1003 Procedure A. Mineral oil is applied to the film surface to remove surface scratches. [205]   Mechanical Properties - Tensile, Hysteresis, and Tear [206]   Stress-strain behavior in uniaxial tension is measured using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens. Samples are stretched with an Instron at 500 % min"1 at 21°C. Tensile strength and elongation at break are reported from an average of 5 specimens. [207]    100% and 300% Hysteresis is determined from cyclic loading to 100% and 300% strains using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens with an Instron™ instrument. The sample is loaded and unloaded at 267 % min"1 for 3 cycles at 21°C. Cyclic experiments at<br><br>
300% and 80°C are conducted using an environmental chamber. In the 80 °C experiment, the sample is allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes at the test temperature before testing. In the 21 °C, 300% strain cyclic experiment, the retractive stress at 150% strain from the first unloading cycle is recorded. Percent recovery for all experiments are calculated from the first unloading cycle using the strain at which the load returned to the base line. The percent recovery is defined as: <br>
[208]   where Ef is the strain taken for cyclic loading and 6S is the strain where the load returns to the baseline during the 1st unloading cycle.<br>
[209]   Stress relaxation is measured at 50 percent strain and 37 °C for 12 hours using an Instron™ instrument equipped with an environmental chamber. The gauge geometry was 76 mm x 25 mm x 0.4 mm. After equilibrating at 37°C for 45 min in the environmental chamber, the sample was stretched to 50% strain at 333% min"1. Stress was recorded as a function of time for 12 hours. The percent stress relaxation after 12 hours was calculated using the formula: <br>
[210]   where Lo is the load at 50% strain at 0 time and Ln is the load at 50 percent strain after 12 hours.<br>
[211]   Tensile notched tear experiments are carried out on samples having a density of 0.88 g/cc or less using an Instron™ instrument. The geometry consists of a gauge section of 76 mm x 13 mm x 0.4 mm with a 2 mm notch cut into the sample at half the specimen length. The sample is stretched at 508 mm min"1 at 21 °C until it breaks. The tear energy is calculated as the area under the stress-elongation curve up to strain at maximum load. An average of at least 3 specimens are reported.<br>
TMA [212]   Thermal Mechanical Analysis (Penetration Temperature) is conducted on 30mm diameter x 3.3 mm thick, compression molded discs, formed at 180°C and 10 MPa molding pressure for 5 minutes and then air quenched. The instrument used is a TMA 7, brand available from Perkin-Elmer. In the test, a probe with 1.5 mm radius tip (P/NN519-0416) is applied to the surface of the sample disc with IN force. The temperature is raised at 5°C/min<br><br>
from 25°C. The probe penetration distance is measured as a function of temperature. The experiment ends when the probe has penetrated 1 mm into the sample.<br>
DMA [213]   Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is measured on compression molded disks formed in a hot press at 180°C at 10 MPa pressure for 5 minutes and then water cooled in the press at 90°C / min. Testing is conducted using an ARES controlled strain rheometer (TA instruments) equipped with dual cantilever fixtures for torsion testing. [214]   A 1.5mm plaque is pressed and cut in a bar of dimensions 32x12mm. The sample is clamped at both ends between fixtures separated by 10mm (grip separation AL) and subjected to successive temperature steps from -100°C to 200°C (5°C per step). At each temperature the torsion modulus G' is measured at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s, the strain amplitude being maintained between 0.1 percent and 4 percent to ensure that the torque is sufficient and that the measurement remains in the linear regime.<br>
[215]   An initial static force of 10 g is maintained (auto-tension mode) to prevent slack in the sample when thermal expansion occurs. As a consequence, the grip separation AL increases with the temperature, particularly above the melting or softening point of the polymer sample. The test stops at the maximum temperature or when the gap between the fixtures reaches 65 mm.<br>
Melt Index [216]   Melt index, or fc, is measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/2.16 kg. Melt index, or Iio is also measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/10 kg.<br>
ATREF [217]   Analytical temperature rising elution fractionation (ATREF) analysis is conducted according to the method described in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,081 and Wilde, L.; Ryle, T.R.; Knobeloch, D.C.; Peat, I.R.; Determination of Branching Distributions in Polyethylene and Ethylene Copolymers, J. Polym. Sci., 20, 441-455 (1982), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The composition to be analyzed is dissolved in trichlorobenzene and allowed to crystallize in a column containing an inert support (stainless steel shot) by slowly reducing the temperature to 20°C at a cooling rate of 0.1°C/min. The column is equipped with an infrared detector. An ATREF chromatogram curve is then generated by eluting the crystallized polymer sample from the column by slowly increasing<br><br>
the temperature of the eluting solvent (trichlorobenzene) from 20 to 120°C at a rate of 1.5°C/min.<br>
UC NMR Analysis [218]   The samples are prepared by adding approximately 3g of a 50/50 mixture of tetrachloroethane-d2/orthodichlorobenzene to 0.4 g sample in a 10 mm NMR tube. The samples are dissolved and homogenized by heating the tube and its contents to 150°C. The data are collected using a JEOL Eclipse™ 400MHz spectrometer or a Varian Unity Plus™ 400MHz spectrometer, corresponding to a l3C resonance frequency of 100.5 MHz. The data are acquired using 4000 transients per data file with a 6 second pulse repetition delay. To achieve minimum signal-to-noise for quantitative analysis, multiple data files are added together. The spectral width is 25,000 Hz with a minimum file size of 32K data points. The samples are analyzed at 130 °C in a 10 mm broad band probe. The comonomer incorporation is determined using Randall's triad method (Randall, J.C.; JMS-Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., C29, 201-317 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Polymer Fractionation by TREF [219]   Large-scale TREF fractionation is carried by dissolving 15-20 g of polymer in 2 liters of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB)by stirring for 4 hours at 160°C. The polymer solution is forced by 15 psig (100 kPa) nitrogen onto a 3 inch by 4 foot (7.6 cm x 12 cm) steel column packed with a 60:40 (v:v) mix of 30-40 mesh (600-425 nm) spherical, technical quality glass beads (available from Potters Industries, HC 30 Box 20, Brownwood, TX, 76801) and stainless steel, 0.028" (0.7mm) diameter cut wire shot (available from Pellets, Inc. 63 Industrial Drive, North Tonawanda, NY, 14120). The column is immersed in a thermally controlled oil jacket, set initially to 160 °C. The column is first cooled ballistically to 125 °C, then slow cooled to 20 °C at 0.04 °C per minute and held for one hour. Fresh TCB is introduced at about 65 ml/min while the temperature is increased at 0.167 °C per minute. [220]   Approximately 2000 ml portions of eluant from the preparative TREF column are collected in a 16 station, heated fraction collector. The polymer is concentrated in each fraction using a rotary evaporator until about 50 to 100 ml of the polymer solution remains. The concentrated solutions are allowed to stand overnight before adding excess methanol, filtering, and rinsing (approx. 300-500 ml of methanol including the final rinse). The filtration step is performed on a 3 position vacuum assisted filtering station using 5.0 jj.m polytetrafluoroethylene coated filter paper (available from Osmonics Inc., Cat#<br><br>
Z50WP04750). The filtrated fractions are dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and weighed on an analytical balance before further testing.<br>
Melt Strength [22J]   Melt Strength (MS) is measured by using a capillary rheometer fitted with a 2.1 mm diameter, 20:1 die with an entrance angle of approximately 45 degrees. After equilibrating the samples at 190°C for 10 minutes, the piston is run at a speed of 1 inch/minute (2.54 cm/minute). The standard test temperature is 190°C. The sample is drawn uniaxially to a set of accelerating nips located 100 mm below the die with an acceleration of 2.4 mm/sec2. The required tensile force is recorded as a function of the take-up speed of the nip rolls. The maximum tensile force attained during the test is defined as the melt strength. In the case of polymer melt exhibiting draw resonance, the tensile force before the onset of draw resonance was taken as melt strength. The melt strength is recorded in centiNewtons ("cN").<br>
Catalysts [222]   The term "overnight", if used, refers to a time of approximately 16-18 hours, the term "room temperature", refers to a temperature of 20-25 °C, and the term "mixed alkanes" refers to a commercially obtained mixture of Ce-9 aliphatic hydrocarbons available under the trade designation Isopar E®, from ExxonMobil Chemical Company. In the event the name of a compound herein does not conform to the structural representation thereof, the structural representation shall control. The synthesis of all metal complexes and the preparation of all screening experiments were carried out in a dry nitrogen atmosphere using dry box techniques. All solvents used were HPLC grade and were dried before their use. [223]   MMAO refers to modified methylalumoxane, a triisobutylaluminum modified methylalumoxane available commercially from Akzo-Noble Corporation.<br>
The preparation of catalyst (Bl) is conducted as follows.<br>
;	a) Preparation of (1 -methvlethviy2-hvdroxv-3,5-di('t-butvnphenvnmethvlimine<br>
[224]   3,5-Di-t-butylsalicylaldehyde (3.00 g) is added to 10 mL of isopropylamine. The solution rapidly turns bright yellow. After stirring at ambient temperature for 3 hours, volatiles are removed under vacuum to yield a bright yellow, crystalline solid (97 percent yield).<br>
b) Preparation of U2-bis-(3.5-di-t-butylphenylene')(l-rN-('l-methvlethyl)immino&gt;)methvI)(2-oxovn zirconium dibenzyl<br>
[225]   A solution of (1 -methylethyl)(2-hydroxy-3,5-di(t-butyl)phenyl)imine (605 mg, 2,2 mmol) in 5 mL toluene is slowly added to a solution of Zr(CH2Ph)4 (500 mg, 1.1 mmol) in 50<br><br>
mL toluene. The resulting dark yellow solution is stirred for 30 min. Solvent is removed under reduced pressure to yield the desired product as a reddish-brown solid. The preparation of catalyst (B2) is conducted as follows.<br>
a)	Preparation of (1 -(2-methvlcvclohexvnethyl)(2-oxovl-3,S-di(t-butvl)phenvnimine [226]   2-Methylcyclohexylamine (8.44 mL, 64.0 mmol) is dissolved in methanol (90 mL), and di-t-butylsalicaldehyde (10.00 g, 42.67 mmol) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for three hours and then cooled to -25°C for 12 hrs.

General High Throughput Parallel Polymerization Conditions [231]   Polymerizations are conducted using a high throughput, parallel polymerization reactor (PPR) available from Symyx technologies, Inc. and operated substantially according to USP's 6,248,540, 6,030,917, 6,362,309, 6,306,658, and 6,316,663. Ethylene copolymerizations are conducted at 130°C and 200 psi (1.4 MPa) with ethylene on demand using 1.2 equivalents of cocatalyst 1 based on total catalyst used (1.1 equivalents when MMAO is present). A series of polymerizations are conducted in a parallel pressure reactor (PPR) contained of 48 individual reactor cells in a 6 x 8 array that are fitted with a pre-weighed glass tube. The working volume in each reactor cell is 6000 \xL. Each cell is temperature and pressure controlled with stirring provided by individual stirring paddles. The monomer gas and quench gas are plumbed directly into the PPR unit and controlled by automatic valves. Liquid reagents are robotically added to each reactor cell by syringes and the reservoir solvent is mixed alkanes. The order of addition is mixed alkanes solvent (4 ml), ethylene, 1-octene comonomer (1 ml), cocatalyst 1 or cocatalyst 1/MMAO mixture, shuttling agent, and catalyst or catalyst mixture. When a mixture of cocatalyst 1 and MMAO or a mixture of two catalysts is used, the reagents are premixed in a small vial immediately prior to addition to the reactor. When a reagent is omitted in an experiment, the above order of addition is otherwise maintained. Polymerizations are conducted for approximately 1-2 minutes, until predetermined ethylene consumptions are reached. After quenching with CO, the reactors are cooled and the glass tubes are unloaded. The tubes are transferred to a centrifuge/vacuum drying unit, and dried for 12 hours at 60 °C. The tubes containing dried polymer are weighed and the difference between this weight and the tare weight gives the net yield of polymer. Results are contained in Table 1. In Table 1 and elsewhere in the application, comparative compounds are indicated by an asterisk (*). [232]   Examples 1-4 demonstrate the synthesis of linear block copolymers by the present invention as evidenced by the formation of a very narrow MWD, essentially monomodal copolymer when DEZ is present and a bimodal. broad molecular weight distribution product<br><br>
(a mixture of separately produced polymers) in the absence of DEZ. Due to the fact that Catalyst (Al) is known to incorporate more octene than Catalyst (Bl), the different blocks or segments of the resulting copolymers of the invention are distinguishable based on branching or density.<br>
  i<br>
[233]   It may be seen the polymers produced according to the invention have a relatively<br>
narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn) and larger block-copolymer content (trimer, tetramer, or<br>
larger) than polymers prepared in the absence of the shuttling agent.<br>
[234]   Further characterizing data for the polymers of Table 1 are determined by reference to<br>
the figures. More specifically DSC and ATREF results show the following:<br>

fusion of 143.0 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 81.8 °C<br>
with a peak area of 34.7 percent as well as a lower crystalline peak at 52.4 °C. The<br>
separation between the two peaks is consistent with the presence of a high crystalline and a<br>
low crystalline polymer. The difference between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 43.5°C.<br>
Examples 5-19, Comparatives D-F, Continuous Solution Polymerization, Catalyst A1/B2 + DEZ<br>
[242]   Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled autoclave reactor equipped with an internal stirrer. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (Isopar™ E available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company), ethylene at 2.70 lbs/hour (1.22 kg/hour), 1-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are supplied to a 3.8 L reactor equipped with a jacket for temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and pressure to the reactor. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst and cocatalyst 1 injection lines and the reactor agitator. These flows are measured by Micro-Motion mass flow meters and controlled by control valves or by the manual adjustment of needle valves. The remaining solvent is combined with 1-octene, ethylene, and hydrogen (where used) and fed to the reactor. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen to the reactor as needed. The temperature of the solvent/monomer solution is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor,   ihis stream eniers uie Douom ui mc lcdUur.  ihc caialy^i ^oiupui^;/. ^luuu^ ^;c<br><br>
metered using pumps and mass flow meters and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent and introduced into the bottom of the reactor. The reactor is run liquid-full at 500 psig (3.45 MPa) with vigorous stirring. Product is removed through exit lines at the top of the reactor. All exit lines from the reactor are steam traced and insulated. Polymerization is stopped by the addition of a small amount of water into the exit line along with any stabilizers or other additives and passing the mixture through a static mixer. The product stream is then heated by passing through a heat exchanger before devolatilization. The polymer product is recovered by extrusion using a devolatilizing extruder and water cooled pelletizer. Process details and results are contained in Table 2.

[260]   The DSC curve for the polymer of comparative E shows a peak with a 124.0 °C melting point (Tm) with a heat of fusion of 179.3 J/g. The corresponding CRYSTAF curve shows the tallest peak at 79.3°C with a peak area of 94.6 percent. Both of these values are consistent with a resin that is high in density.

The separation between the two peaks is consistent with the presence of both a high crystalline and a low crystalline polymer. The delta between the DSC Tm and the Tcrystaf is 47.2°C.<br>
Physical Property Testing [262]   Polymer samples are evaluated for physical properties such as high temperature resistance properties, as evidenced by TMA temperature testing, pellet blocking strength, high temperature recovery, high temperature compression set and storage modulus ratio, G,(25°C)/G'(100°C). Several commercially available polymers are included in the tests: Comparative G* is a substantially linear ethylene/1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY®, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative H* is an elastomeric, substantially linear ethylene/ 1-octene copolymer (AFFINITY®EG8100, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative I is a substantially linear ethylene/1 -octene copolymer (AFFINITY®PL1840, available from The Dow Chemical Company), Comparative J is a hydrogenated styrene/butadiene/styrene triblock copolymer (KRATON™ G1652, available from KRATON Polymers), Comparative K is a thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV, a polyolefin blend containing dispersed therein a crosslinked elastomer). Results are presented in Table 4.<br><br><br>
[263]   In Table 4, Comparative F (which is a physical blend of the two polymers resulting from simultaneous polymerizations using catalyst Al and Bl) has a 1 mm penetration temperature of about 70°C, while Examples 5-9 have a 1 mm penetration temperature of 100°C or greater. Further, examples 10-19 all have a 1 mm penetration temperature of greater than 85°C, with most having 1 mm TMA temperature of greater than 90°C or even greater than 100°C. This shows that the novel polymers have better dimensional stability at higher temperatures compared to a physical blend. Comparative J (a commercial SEBS) has a good 1 mm TMA temperature of about 107°C, but it has very poor (high temperature 70°C) compression set of about 100 percent and it also failed to recover (sample broke) during a high temperature (80°C) 300 percent strain recovery. Thus the exemplified polymers have a unique combination of properties unavailable even in some commercially available, high performance thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
[?M]   ^iiflriv T?hle 4 shows a low (good) storage modulus ratio, G,(25°C)/G'(100°C), for the inventive polymers of 6 or less, whereas a physical blend (Comparative F) has a storage<br><br>
modulus ratio of 9 and a random ethylene/octene copolymer (Comparative G) of similar density has a storage modulus ratio an order of magnitude greater (89). It is desirable that the storage modulus ratio of a polymer be as close to 1 as possible. Such polymers will be relatively unaffected by temperature, and fabricated articles made from such polymers can be usefully employed over a broad temperature range. This feature of low storage modulus ratio and temperature independence is particularly useful in elastomer applications such as in pressure sensitive adhesive formulations.<br>
[265]   The data in Table 4 also demonstrate that the polymers of the invention possess improved pellet blocking strength. In particular, Example 5 has a pellet blocking strength of 0 MPa, meaning it is free flowing under the conditions tested, compared to Comparatives F and G which show considerable blocking. Blocking strength is important since bulk shipment of polymers having large blocking strengths can result in product clumping or sticking together upon storage or shipping, resulting in poor handling properties. [266]   High temperature (70°C) compression set for the inventive polymers is generally good, meaning generally less than about 80 percent, preferably less than about 70 percent and especially less than about 60 percent. In contrast, Comparatives F, G, H and J all have a 70°C compression set of 100 percent (the maximum possible value, indicating no recovery). Good high temperature compression set (low numerical values) is especially needed for applications such as gaskets, window profiles, o-rings, and the like.<br><br><br><br>
[267]   Table 5 shows results for mechanical properties for the new polymers as well as for various comparison polymers at ambient temperatures. It may be seen that the inventive polymers have very good abrasion resistance when tested according to ISO 4649, generally showing a volume loss of less than about 90 mm3, preferably less than about 80 mm3, and especially less than about 50 mm3. In this test, higher numbers indicate higher volume loss and consequently lower abrasion resistance. [268]   Tear strength as measured by tensile notched tear strength of the inventive polymers is generally 1000 mJ or higher, as shown in Table 5. Tear strength for the inventive polymers can be as high as 3000 mJ, or even as high as 5000 mJ. Comparative polymers generally have tear strengths no higher than 750 mJ.<br>
[269]   Table 5 also shows that the polymers of the invention have better retractive stress at 150 percent strain (demonstrated by higher retractive stress values) than some of the comparative samples. Comparative Examples F, G and H have retractive stress value at 150 percent strain of 400 kPa or less, while the inventive polymers have retractive stress values at 150 percent strain of 500 kPa (Ex. 11) to as high as about 1100 kPa (Ex. 17). Polymers having higher than 150 percent retractive stress values would be quite useful for elastic applications, such as elastic fibers and fabrics, especially nonwoven fabrics. Other applications include diaper, hygiene, and medical garment waistband applications, such as tabs and elastic bands.<br>
[270]   Table 5 also shows that stress relaxation (at 50 percent strain) is also improved (less) for the inventive polymers as compared to, for example, Comparative G. Lower stress relaxation means that the polymer retains its force better in applications such as diapers and other garments where retention of elastic properties over long time periods at body temperatures is desired.<br><br><br>
[271]   The optical properties reported in Table 6 are based on compression molded films substantially lacking in orientation. Optical properties of the polymers may be varied over wide ranges, due to variation in crystallite size, resulting from variation in the quantity of chain shuttling agent employed in the polymerization.<br>
Extractions of Multi-Block Copolymers [272]   Extraction studies of the polymers of examples 5, 7 and Comparative E are conducted. In the experiments, the polymer sample is weighed into a glass fritted extraction thimble and fitted into a Kumagawa type extractor. The extractor with sample is purged with nitrogen, and a 500mL round bottom flask is charged with 350 mL of diethyl ether. The flask is then fitted to the extractor. The ether is heated while being stirred. Time is noted when the ether begins to condense into the thimble, and the extraction is allowed to proceed under nitrogen for 24 hours. At this time, heating is stopped and the solution is allowed to cool. Any ether remaining in the extractor is returned to the flask. The ether in the flask is evaporated under vacuum at ambient temperature, and the resulting solids are purged dry with nitrogen. Any residue is transferred to a weighed bottle using successive washes of hexane. The combined hexane washes are then evaporated with another nitrogen purge, and the residue dried under<br><br>
vacuum overnight at 40°C. Any remaining ether in the extractor is purged dry with nitrogen.<br>
[273]   A second clean round bottom flask charged with 350 mL of hexane is then connected to the extractor. The hexane is heated to reflux with stirring and maintained at reflux for 24 hours after hexane is first noticed condensing into the thimble. Heating is then stopped and the flask is allowed to cool. Any hexane remaining in the extractor is transferred back to the flask. The hexane is removed by evaporation under vacuum at ambient temperature, and any residue remaining in the flask is transferred to a weighed bottle using successive hexane washes. The hexane in the flask is evaporated by a nitrogen purge, and the residue is vacuum dried overnight at 40°C. [274]   The polymer sample remaining in the thimble after the extractions is transferred from the thimble to a weighed bottle and vacuum dried overnight at 40°C. Results are contained in Table 7.<br><br>
Additional Polymer Examples 19 A-F, Continuous Solution Polymerization, Catalyst A1/B2 + DEZ<br>
[275]   Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled well-mixed reactor. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (Isopar™ E available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company), ethylene, 1-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are combined and fed to a 27 gallon reactor. The feeds to the reactor are measured by mass-flow controllers. The temperature of the feed stream is controlled by use of a glycol cooled heat exchanger before entering the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters. The reactor is run liquid-full at approximately 550 psig pressure. Upon exiting the reactor, water and additive are injected in the polymer solution. The water hydrolyzes the catalysts, and terminates the polymerization reactions. The post reactor solution is then heated in preparation for a two-stage devolatization. The solvent<br><br>
and unreacted monomers are removed during the devolatization process. The polymer melt is pumped to a die for underwater pellet cutting.<br>

Filled Polymer Composition Examples<br>
[277]   Certain filled polymer compositions were prepared using a Banbury mixer. The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer was added to the heated chamber and mixed for 2 minutes at 50 -75 rpm followed by yA the dry ingredients plus pigment and mixed for 3 minutes. The remainder of the dry ingredients and oil were added and the batch mixed at 30 - 50 rpm for an additional 8 -12 minutes. The batch temperature remained below 135°C. The compound was dropped from the mixer and further processed by calendaring a thin sheet (approx 3 mm) on a cool, two roll mill through a single pass. The milled sheets were collected such that the sheet was not stressed during removal from the rolls. The final sheets were allowed to cool between cardboard sheets and subsequently used for physical and mechanical property testing or compression-molded into sheet by heating at 190 °C without pressure for 2 minutes, then at 88.9 kN force for 2 minutes, followed by cooling at 10 °C for 4 minutes at 88.9 kN force. [278]   Alternatively, the filled polymer compositions were prepared using a Haake Rheomix 300 rheometer. The temperature of the sample bowl was set at 190 °C and the rotor speed was 40 rpm. To the sample bowl was added each component separately. The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer was added first to establish a melt bank, and then the inorganic filler was added at a slow rate so that the powdery filler was incorporated into the polymer melt bank gradually. After all the components were added, the mixing was continued for about five minutes or until a stable torque has been established. Samples for further testing and evaluation were compression molded a Garver automatic press at 190 °C under 44.45 kN force for 3 minutes. The molten materials were subsequently quenched with the press equilibrated at room temperature using an electronic cooling bath. [279]   The filler contents, hardness, heat resistance and flexural modulus of calcium carbonate filled polymer compositions provided herein and comparative control examples are compared. These data are shown in Table 8.<br><br><br><br>
[280]   The filled polymer compositions provided herein (Examples 20- 23 in Table 8) showed relatively higher flexibility-heat resistance index and softness-heat resistance index. High hardness-normalized temperature resistance is desired for applications requiring heat resistance and soft touch or flexibility.<br>
[281]   The softness-Heat resistance index comparison for the new filled polymer compositions provided herein (Examples 20- 23 in Table 8) and for filled AFFINITY® EG8200 at various filler content level are illustrated in Figure 8.
