				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ACTIVE ENERGY CURABLE INK COMPOSITION<br>
FOR MULTICOAT PRINTING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an active energy curable ink<br>
composition for multicoat printing such as multi-color printing.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An active energy curable solvent-less composition has a<br>
small effect on environment because solvent is not used, and allows<br>
high productivity in a curing step using an active energy ray.<br>
Therefore research and development are made for applications thereof<br>
to coating and printing on various substrates.<br>
However with respect to an active energy curable<br>
composition, its component involved in the curing reaction, for<br>
example, a reactive diluent is a relatively low molecular weight<br>
compound and its crosslinking density becomes high as compared with<br>
a solvent-based curable composition in which generally a high<br>
molecular weight resin is dissolved in a solvent, and therefore because<br>
of such a higher crosslinking density, post-processability thereof is<br>
inferior and a range of its applications is limited.<br>
Since an active energy curable composition has such<br>
unsolved problems, at present, solvent-based compositions are widely<br>
used in a field where post-processing is required, for example, in a field<br>
where bending and pressing are carried out after printing or coating.<br><br>
Patent publication JP5-86152A discloses an active energy<br>
polymerizable coating composition comprising a polyfunctional<br>
urethane (meth)acrylate having an aromatic ring structure as a<br>
polyisocyanate component, a polyfunctional polyester (meth)acrylate, a<br>
polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate which is a highly hydrophilic<br>
reactive diluent, and a photopolymerization initiator, and it is disclosed<br>
therein that a coating film being excellent in scratch resistance,<br>
weather resistance and processability can be obtained.<br>
However since this composition disclosed in JP5-86152A<br>
has an aromatic ring structure, there is a case where yellowing arises<br>
when exposing to heat or ultraviolet rays. Such yellowing must be<br>
eliminated or reduced as far as possible in a field of printing inks<br>
where a color tone is very important. Further since the reactive<br>
diluent is highly hydrophilic (surface tension: more than 39 mN/m),<br>
the composition cannot be used for offset printing which is a main<br>
printing method of an active energy curable ink.<br>
In order to obtain a highly clear design by printing,<br>
multicoat printing of many inks is necessary. When only uncured<br>
inks such as an oily ink are coated, a color ink is coated on an<br>
uncured ink and the overlapped inks are mixed and there arises a<br>
problem with lowering of brilliancy by color mixing (subtractive color<br>
mixture effect). In addition, in order to avoid mixing of the inks at the<br>
interlayer portion between the inks, it is necessary to adjust or change<br>
ink conditions such as a viscosity, etc. for every printing machine unit.<br>
Also in printing of uncured inks, particularly in printing thereof on<br>
non-absorptive substrates such as metal and plastic, a step for curing<br>
of the inks by heating is necessary after the printing, that is, it is<br><br>
necessary to blow hot air several minutes onto the printed article being<br>
in an uncured state in an oven.<br>
On the other hand, in an active energy curable ink, an<br>
active energy ray is irradiated in every printing machine unit for curing<br>
of the ink, and a next ink is printed after the curing by irradiation of<br>
the active energy ray. Therefore there is no mixing of inks, no<br>
adjustment of ink conditions is necessary and also drying by heating in<br>
an oven is not necessary for curing.<br>
However in order to secure a specific printing speed,<br>
existing active energy curable: inks contain a large amount of reactive<br>
diluent having four or more functional groups for increasing a curing<br>
speed and a crosslinking density is increased, thus hardening an ink<br>
layer. Therefore such inks cannot be used in printing for applications<br>
where processing is necessary after the printing. For the same reason,<br>
separation between the multicoat ink layers easily arises, and attention<br>
need be paid to handling of printed article.<br>
Such active energy curable ink compositions used for<br>
multi-color printing contain an active energy curable resin and a<br>
reactive diluent in addition to a pigment. With respect to the active<br>
energy curable resin, there are known a system using epoxy acrylate, a<br>
system using urethane acrylate, a system using polyester acrylate and<br>
a system using polyether acrylate.<br>
An epoxy acrylate prepolymer is excellent in surface<br>
curability, heat resistance, chemical resistance, hardness, electrical<br>
properties, weather resistance and adhesion to a substrate, but has a<br>
relatively high viscosity and contains hydroxyl group in its molecule.<br>
Therefore there is a problem with water resistance and suitability for<br><br>
damping water in offset printing.<br>
A urethane acrylate prepolymer has good toughness,<br>
flexibility and elongation and is excellent in chemical resistance,<br>
adhesion to a substrate, low temperature characteristics and light<br>
resistance, but has a high viscosity and there is a problem with<br>
handling thereof (printability) and also yellowing may occur.<br>
A polyester acrylate prepolymer has a low viscosity and a<br>
relatively high hardness and the polyester portion can take various<br>
structures, which makes it possible to exhibit various properties.<br>
However this prepolymer is inferior in surface curability and has a<br>
problem with chemical resistance.<br>
A polyether acrylate prepolymer has good flexibility and<br>
elongation, is excellent in adhesion to a substrate and low temperature<br>
characteristics and has a relatively low viscosity, but there is a<br>
problem with toughness, chemical resistance and light resistance.<br>
As mentioned above, the respective active energy curable<br>
prepolymers have merits and demerits, and the problems of ink<br>
composition for multicoat printing cannot be solved only by<br>
combination of those prepolymers.<br>
On the other hand, in order to achieve curing rapidly and<br>
obtain a highly hard printing film, compounds having four or more<br>
functional groups are used alone or in combination thereof as a<br>
reactive diluent.<br>
However when a reactive diluent having four or more<br>
functional groups is used, excellent characteristics can be exhibited in<br>
the case of curing (printing) of one color ink, but in the case of<br>
multi-color printing, an accumulated amount of irradiated energy is<br><br>
increased and the first ink film is subjected to excessive irradiation<br>
and becomes very high in a crosslinking density, which results in the<br>
coating film having inferior processability.<br>
It is considered to use a reactive diluent having a small<br>
number of functional groups, but when printing (irradiation) at a usual<br>
operation speed of printer for multi-color printing, initial curing<br>
becomes insufficient and a mechanical strength of an obtained ink film<br>
is decreased.<br>
Patent Publication JP7-292304A discloses an ink<br>
composition for multi-color printing, and a urethane acrylate is used<br>
alone as an active energy curable resin and overcoatability is intended<br>
to be improved by using various modified urethane acrylates.<br>
However it cannot be said that these compositions stand multicoat<br>
printing and multi-color printing of three or more colors, do not cause<br>
yellowing and are excellent in post-processability. So far an active<br>
energy curable ink composition for printing which can be used for<br>
multicoat printing such as multi-color printing without problems has<br>
not been found.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an active<br>
energy curable ink composition for multicoat printing which gives a<br>
mechanical strength for actual use even in a small amount of<br>
irradiation energy, is excellent in adhesion to a metallic or plastic<br>
substrate and overcoatability (multi-color printability), is free from<br>
yellowing and has a proper mechanical strength and flexibility for<br>
post-processing.<br><br>
The present inventors have made intensive studies and<br>
found that all of the mentioned problems can be solved by combination<br>
use of a specific urethane compound and a functional<br>
group-containing resin giving a specific range of an acid value as a<br>
binder resin, by introducing a radically polymerizable double bond to<br>
at least one of them, and by using, as a reactive diluent, only a<br>
(hydrophobic) compound having not more than three radically<br>
polymerizable double bonds and having a low surface tension. Thus<br>
the present invention was completed.<br>
Namely, the present invention relates to an active energy<br>
curable ink composition for multicoat printing which comprises (A) a<br>
urethane compound comprising a reaction product of a polyol<br>
component with a polyisocyanate component having no aromatic ring<br>
structure, (B) a resin having an acid value of 5 to 100 mgKOH/g and<br>
(C) a reactive diluent having radically polymerizable double bond, in<br>
which at least one of the compound (A) and the resin (B) has a<br>
radically polymerizable double bond, and only a compound having 1 to<br>
3 radically polymerizable double bonds and having a surface tension of<br>
not more than 39 mN/m (at 20°C) is used as the reactive diluent (C).<br>
In the present invention, a radically polymerizable double<br>
bond is required as a crosslinking site for the urethane compound (A)<br>
and the resin (B). The radically polymerizable double bond may be<br>
introduced to any one of the urethane compound (A) and the resin (B)<br>
or to both of them.<br>
The acid value of the resin (B) is within a range of 5 to 100<br>
mgKOH/g. By adjusting the acid value within this range, suitability<br>
for damping water at offset printing and resistance to sterilizing<br><br>
treatment (treatment in retort) at high temperature under pressure are<br>
improved.<br>
In the present invention, an aromatic ring structure is not<br>
contained in the polyisocyanate component of the urethane compound<br>
and also in the polyol component, which is preferred from the<br>
viewpoint of prevention of yellowing.<br>
A preferred example of a functional group giving an acid<br>
value of the resin (B) is carboxyl group because an intermolecular force<br>
between the functional group and the urethane bond of the urethane<br>
compound is not so strong as in a bond between atoms and<br>
processability is hardly influenced.<br>
To the active energy curable ink composition of the present<br>
invention may be further mixed an active energy curing catalyst. The<br>
mixing of an active energy curing catalyst can decrease an amount of<br>
irradiation energy and makes it possible to adjust a degree of curing.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The active energy curable ink composition of the present<br>
invention for multicoat printing comprises:<br>
(A)	a urethane compound comprising a reaction product of a polyol<br>
component with a polyisocyanate component having no aromatic ring<br>
structure,<br>
(B)	a resin having an acid value of 5 to 100 mgKOH/g and<br>
(C)	a reactive diluent having radically polymerizable double bond,<br>
and is characterized in that:<br>
(i) at least one of the compound (A) and the resin (B) has a radically<br>
polymerizable double bond and<br><br>
(ii) only a compound having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable double<br>
bonds and having a surface tension of not more than 39 mN/m (at<br>
20°C) is used as the reactive diluent (C).<br>
Namely, when focusing on the urethane compound (A) and<br>
the resin (B) having an acid value, the present invention encompasses<br>
the following embodiments.<br>
(1)	The active energy curable composition comprising:<br>
(A1) a urethane compound having no radically polymerizable double<br>
bond (a compound non-curable with active energy ray),<br>
(B2) a resin having a radically polymerizable double bond and having<br>
an acid value (a resin curable with active energy ray), and<br>
(C) a hydrophobic reactive diluent having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable<br>
double bonds.<br>
(2)	The active energy curable composition comprising:<br>
(A2) a urethane compound having a radically polymerizable double<br>
bond (a compound curable with active energy ray),<br>
(B1) a resin having no radically polymerizable double bond and having<br>
an acid value (a resin non-curable with active energy ray), and<br>
(C) a hydrophobic reactive diluent having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable<br>
double bonds.<br>
(3)	The active energy curable composition comprising:<br>
(A2) a urethane compound having a radically polymerizable double<br>
bond (a compound curable with active energy ray),<br>
(B2) a resin having a radically polymerizable double bond and having<br>
an acid value (a resin curable with active energy ray), and<br>
(C) a hydrophobic reactive diluent having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable<br>
double bonds.<br><br>
In addition to those embodiments, it is possible to use other<br>
active energy curable resin together, but a reactive diluent having not<br>
less than 4 radically polymerizable double bonds and a hydrophilic<br>
reactive diluent are not used.<br>
For example, in the case where any one of the urethane<br>
bond and the group giving an acid value (for example, carboxyl) is not<br>
present, namely in the case of sole use of the urethane compound (A2)<br>
having a radically polymerizable double bond or in the case of sole use<br>
of the resin (B2) having a radically polymerizable double bond, when<br>
curing by using only a reactive diluent having 1 to 3 radically<br>
polymerizable double bonds, the curing is insufficient and adhesion to<br>
a substrate is inferior. Therefore in order to increase a crosslinking<br>
density, if a reactive diluent having not less than 4 double bonds is<br>
mixed, curability is enhanced but adhesion to a substrate is lowered<br>
and post-processability (for example, bending resistance) is lowered.<br>
Also when neither of the urethane compound (A) nor the<br>
resin (B) has a radically polymerizable double bond, namely in the case<br>
of using only the urethane compound (A1) and the resin (B1), it is a<br>
matter of course that the composition is lack in curability. Further<br>
when other active energy curable resin such as a polyether acrylate<br>
prepolymer or an epoxy acrylate prepolymer is mixed to the urethane<br>
compound (A1) and the resin (B1) and the curing is carried out by<br>
using only the reactive diluent having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable<br>
double bonds, the composition is lack in curability and necessary<br>
mechanical properties and adhesion cannot be obtained because the<br>
urethane compound (A1) and the resin (B1) which are not involved in<br>
the reaction are contained.<br><br>
In the above-mentioned embodiments (1) to (3), if the whole<br>
or a part of reactive diluent having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable<br>
double bonds is replaced by a reactive diluent having not less than 4<br>
double bonds, curability of an obtained composition is enhanced as<br>
compared with the composition of the present invention but the<br>
obtained composition is cured excessively, post-processability is<br>
inferior and adhesion to a substrate is lowered.<br>
Next, each component of the composition of the present<br>
invention is explained below.<br>
The urethane compound (A1) which is not curable with<br>
active energy and has no radically polymerizable double bond is a<br>
reaction product of a polyol component with a polyisocyanate<br>
component having no aromatic ring structure.<br>
Examples of the polyol component are, for instance, polyols<br>
having no aromatic ring structure such as ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol,	1,3-butanediol,	1,4-butanediol,	1,5-pentanediol,<br>
2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,9-nonanediol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol,<br>

having no aromatic ring structure such as succinic anhydride, succinic<br><br>
acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic	anhydride,	hexahydrophthalic	acid,<br>
hexahydrophthalic anhydride, himic acid, himic acid anhydride, maleic<br>
acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid and itaconic acid; polyether<br>
polyols having no aromatic ring structure such as polypropylene glycol,<br>
polytetramethylene glycol and polyhexamethylene glycol; and polyols<br>
having an aromatic ring structure such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F,<br>
propylene oxide addition product of bisphenol A, propylene oxide<br>
addition product of bisphenol F and polycarbonatediol. Among them,<br>
it is desirable to use polyols having no aromatic ring structure in order<br>
to further control yellowing.<br>
As the polyisocyanate component, there are used ones<br>
having no aromatic ring structure. Examples thereof are, for instance,<br>
1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate,<br>
2,6-diisocyanate	dimercaptoate,<br>
4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylisocyanate),<br>
methylcyclohexane-2,4-diisocyanate,<br>
methylcyclohexane-2,6-diisocyanate,	1,3-(isocyanatomethyl)<br>
cyclohexane, l,4-(isocyanatomethyl) cyclohexane, isophorone<br>
diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate and a combination<br>
of two or more thereof.	Among them, preferred are<br>
4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylisocyanate),<br>
methylcyclohexane-2,4-diisocyanate,<br>
methylcyclohexane-2,6-diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate and a<br>
combination of two or more thereof since yellowing is reduced.<br>
Preferred combinations of the polyol component and the<br>
polyisocyanate component are, for example, as follows.<br><br>
(Polyol component)<br>
(1)	Pentaerythritol<br>
2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropyl-2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropionate<br>
(2)	Polyester polyol comprising adipic acid and 1,6-hexanediol (average<br>
molecular weight: 300 to 5,000)<br>
(3)	Polypropylene glycol (average molecular weight: 300 to 5,000)<br>
(4)	Polytetramethylene glycol (average molecular weight: 300 to 4,000)<br>
(Polyisocyanate component)<br><br>
(1)	A mixture of methylcyclohexane-2,4-diisocyanate with<br>
methylcyclohexane-2,6-diisocyanate<br>
(2)	Isophorone diisocyanate<br>
(3)	4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylisocyanate)<br>
Preferred are urethane compounds obtained by reacting<br>
isophorone diisocyanate with a polyester polyol (average molecular<br>
weight: 300 to 5,000) comprising adipic acid and 1,6-hexanediol or<br>
polytetramethylene glycol (average molecular weight: 300 to 4,000)<br>
from the viewpoint of excellent balance of processability and hardness<br>
of the ink layer.<br>
As the urethane compound (A1) which is not curable with<br>
active energy, there can be used commercially available compounds.<br>
In the case of commercially available compounds containing a solvent,<br>
it is desirable to use them after removing the solvent.<br>
Examples of the active energy curable urethane compound<br>
(A2) having a radically polymerizable double bond are, for instance,<br>
compounds prepared by modifying the active energy non-curable<br>
urethane compound (Al) with a hydroxyl-containing (meth)aerylate.<br>
Also among urethane acrylate prepolymers known as an<br><br>
active energy curable material, there can be used prepolymers<br>
comprising a polyisocyanate component having no aromatic ring<br>
structures. As general purpose urethane acrylate prepolymers, there<br>
are reaction products of polyether polyol, polyisocyanate having no<br>
aromatic ring structure and hydroxyl-containing (meth)acrylate.<br>
Those reaction products have a radically polymerizable double bond<br>
derived from the hydroxyl-containing (meth)acrylate at an end thereof.<br>
Examples of the urethane acrylate prepolymer are, for<br>
instance, ones disclosed in JP5-9247A, JP10-30012A, etc. which<br>
include a reaction product of polyether polyol, polyisocyanate and<br>
hydroxyl-containing (meth)acrylate. Among them, from the viewpoint<br>
of excellent retort resistance and resistance to yellowing, preferred are<br>
urethane acrylate prepolymers which are prepared by reacting one or a<br>
plurality of (meth)acrylates having hydroxyl in a molecule thereof such<br>
as 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and 4-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate<br>
with a urethane compound which is obtained by reacting a polyester<br>
polyol (average molecular weight: 300 to 5,000) comprising adipic acid<br>
and 1,6-hexanediol or polytetramethylene glycol (average molecular<br>
weight: 300 to 4,000) with isophorone diisocyanate.<br>
In the present invention, commercially available urethane<br>
acrylate prepolymers can also be used.<br>
Preferred as the active energy non-curable resin (B1) having<br>
no radically polymerizable double bond and having a specific acid<br>
value are polyesters obtained by reacting a polybasic acid with a polyol.<br>
Also there can be used polyesters obtained by further reacting fat and<br>
oil or fatty acids.<br>
Examples of the polybasic acid are, for instance, one or a<br><br>
mixture of adipic acid, phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid,<br>
terephthalic acid, succinic anhydride, azelaic acid, sebacic acid,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride, himic<br>
acid anhydride, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, itaconic acid,<br>
trimellitic anhydride, methylcyclohexenetricarboxylic anhydride,<br>
pyromellitic anhydride and the like.<br>
Examples of the polyol component are, for instance,<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>
1,5-pentanediol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,3-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol,<br>
1,9-nonanediol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>

2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropy]-2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropionate,<br>
trishydroxymethylaminomethane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol<br>
and the like. Those polyol components may be used alone or in a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
Those polyesters may be synthesized in the presence of oil,<br>
fat, monovalent saturated organic acid, monovalent saturated alcohol<br>
or the like, as case demands. Examples of oil are, for instance,<br>
linseed oil, tung oil, dehydrated castor oil, soybean oil, safflower oil,<br>
rice-bran oil, tall oil, castor oil, palm oil, coconut oil and the like.<br>
Examples of fat are, for instance, fatty acid of linseed oil, fatty acid of<br>
tung oil, fatty acid of castor oil, fatty acid of soybean oil, fatty acid of<br>
safflower oil, fatty acid of rice-bran oil, fatty acid of tall oil, fatty acid of<br>
palm oil, fatty acid of coconut oil and the like. Examples of<br><br>
monovalent saturated organic acid are, for instance, nonanoic acid,<br>
octanoic acid, undecanoic acid, lauric acid, tridecanoic acid, myristic<br>
acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid,<br>
isostearic acid and the like. Examples of monovalent saturated<br>
alcohol are, for instance, octyl alcohol, decanol, lauryl alcohol, cetyl<br>
alcohol, stearyl alcohol, isostearyl alcohol, glycol esters, phenyl glycol<br>
and the like.<br>
Among them, from the viewpoint of good balance of strength<br>
of an ink layer and processability, particularly preferred are polyesters<br>
obtained by reacting a polybasic acid such as phthalic anhydride,<br>
isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride or<br>
trimellitic anhydride with a polyol such as propylene glycol, butylene<br>
glycol, hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, octanediol, nonanediol, butyl ethyl<br>
propanediol, hydrogenated bisphenol A, hydrogenated bisphenol F or<br>
trimethylolpropane.<br>
As the active energy curable resin (B2) having a radically<br>
polymerizable double bond and having a specific acid value, there can<br>
be used polyester acrylate prepolymers known as an active energy<br>
curable material. Those prepolymers can be obtained by introducing<br>
a radically polymerizable double bond to the active energy non-curable<br>
resin (B1) having no radically polymerizable double bond and having a<br>
specific acid value by reacting an unsaturated organic acid with the<br>
resin (B1).<br>
The polyester acrylate prepolymers known as an active<br>
energy curable material are those obtained by reacting a (meth)acrylic<br>
acid with a polyester of a polybasic acid and polyol which is used in the<br>
active energy non-curable resin (B1) having no radically polymerizable<br><br>
double bond and having a specific acid value. Preferred are polyester<br>
acrylate prepolymers obtained by reacting a (meth)acrylic acid with a<br>
polyester prepared by reacting a polybasic acid such as phthalic<br>
anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride or trimellitic anhydride with a polyol such as propylene<br>
glycol, butylene glycol, hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, octanediol,<br>
nonanediol, butyl ethyl propanediol, hydrogenated bisphenol A,<br>
hydrogenated bisphenol F or trimethylolpropane. Also there can be<br>
used commercially available polyester acrylate prepolymers<br>
Examples of the functional group giving an acid value to the<br>
active energy non-curable resin (B1) and the active energy curable<br>
resin (B2) are carboxyl group, phosphoric acid group, sulfonic acid<br>
group and the like. Among them, carboxyl group is preferred since<br>
storage stability of the ink composition is good. The introduction of<br>
the acid value can be carried out by adjusting the adding amounts of<br>
polybasic acid, polyol and (meth)acrylic acid in the esterification<br>
reaction.<br>
It is necessary that the acid value is 5 to 100 mgKOH/g. If<br>
the acid value is lower than 5 mgKOH/g, the amount of functional<br>
groups generating an intermolecular force with the urethane bond of<br>
the urethane compound (A) is decreased and a mechanical strength<br>
and hardness of the ink layer are lowered. If the acid value exceeds<br>
100 mgKOH/g, hydrophilic property is increased excessively and water<br>
resistance and resistance to boiling water (resistance to treatment in<br>
retort) are lowered. A preferred acid value is not less than 10<br>
mgKOH/g, further not less than 15 mgKOH/g, and not more than 80<br>
mgKOH/g, further not more than 60 mgKOH/g.<br><br>
It is necessary that the reactive diluent (C) used in the<br>
present invention has 1 to 3 radically polymerizable double bonds and<br>
has a surface tension of not more than 39 mN/m (at 20°C).<br>
When the number of radically polymerizable double bonds<br>
is not more than 3, as mentioned above, excessive curing (crosslinking)<br>
does not arise and post-processability becomes good. The number of<br>
bonds is preferably 2 to 3, particularly 3.<br>
Also when the surface tension (at 20°C) is not more than 39<br>
mN/m, the ink composition can be made hydrophobic (lipophilic), and<br>
in the case of offset printing using water, bleeding of ink can be<br>
avoided. The surface tension is preferably not more than 39 mN/m,<br>
further not more than 38 mN/m, and a lower limit thereof is usually<br>
28 mN/m, further 29 mN/m.<br>
Examples of the reactive diluent satisfying those<br>
requirements are, for instance, as follows.<br>

products.<br>
Those reactive diluents may be used alone or in a<br>
combination of two or more thereof in consideration of balance of<br>
diluting property and reactivity (curability). It is preferable to select<br>
the reactive diluent from the above-mentioned ones having 1 to 3<br>
radically polymerizable double bonds.<br>
More specifically preferred are one or two or more of<br>
compounds having a surface tension of not more than 39 mN/m (at<br>
20°C) among 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexylcarbitol<br>

radically polymerizable double bond); 2-ethyl-2-butylpropanediol<br>
(meth)acrylate,	dimethyloldicyclopentane	di(meth)acrylate,<br>

their ethylene oxide-modified products, propylene oxide-modified<br>
products and caprolactone-modified products (those having two<br>
radically polymerizable double bonds); and trimethylolpropane<br>
tri(meth)acrylate, and their ethylene oxide-modified products,<br>
propylene oxide-modified products and caprolactone-modified products<br>
(those having three radically polymerizable double bonds). Those<br>
compounds are preferred from the viewpoint of excellent active energy<br>
curability and also from the viewpoint of suitability for damping water<br>
at offset printing.<br>
Next, the proportions of the urethane compound (A), the<br>
resin (B) having a specific acid value and the reactive diluent (C) having<br>
radically polymerizable double bond are explained below.<br>
Irrespective of which of the compound (A) and the resin (B)<br>
has a radically polymerizable double bond, it is preferable to blend the<br>
urethane compound (A) and the resin (B) so that a mole ratio of the<br>
urethane bond to the functional group giving an acid value (number of<br>
moles of urethane bond/number of moles of functional group giving an<br>
acid value) is within a range of 0.5 to 5. When the mole ratio is within<br>
this range, an intermolecular force between the urethane bond and the<br><br>
functional group giving an acid value can be obtained particularly<br>
efficiently. The mole ratio of the urethane bond to the functional<br>
group giving an acid value is preferably not less than 1 and not more<br>
than 4.<br>
As mentioned above, the radically polymerizable double<br>
bond giving active energy curability may be contained in either of the<br>
urethane compound (A) or the resin (B) or in both of them. In any<br>
cases, the double bonds should be contained in such an amount that a<br>
minimum hardness and mechanical strength can be imparted to the<br>
coating film. The amount varies depending on kind and combination<br>
of the resins, an amount of the reactive diluent (C) and the number of<br>
radically polymerizable double bonds contained, and is optionally<br>
selected in the respective embodiments.<br>
It is preferable that the amount of the reactive diluent (C) is<br>
not less than 5 parts by mass, further not less than 10 parts by mass<br>
and not more than 1,000 parts by mass, further not more than 200<br>
parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the sum of urethane<br>
compound (A2) and/or resin (B2) having a radically polymerizable<br>
double bond. If the amount of the reactive diluent (C) is too large,<br>
there is a tendency that active energy curability is lowered, and if the<br>
amount is too small, there is a tendency that flowability of the ink is<br>
lowered and printing is difficult to be carried out.<br>
To the active energy curable ink composition of the present<br>
invention may be blended, for example, an active energy curing<br>
catalyst, photosensitizer and the like.<br>
Examples of the active energy curing catalyst are, for<br>
instance, benzoins such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin<br><br>
butyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether and alkyl ethers thereof;<br>
acetophenones	such	as	acetophenone,<br>

2,4-dimethylthioxanthone,	2,4-diethylthioxanthone,<br>
2-chlorothioxanthone and 2,4-diisopropylthioxanthone; and the like.<br>
Among them, preferred are benzoins, particularly benzoin<br>
from the viewpoint of good photo-reactivity.<br>
Also tertiary amines such as triethanolamine, benzoic acid<br>
and a curing accelerator may be used in combination with the curing<br>
catalyst.<br>

The active energy curable ink composition of the present<br>
invention can be prepared by mixing the urethane compound (A), the<br>
resin (B), the reactive diluent (C) and as case demands, additives such<br>
as a pigment and photo-initiator and then milling and stirring the<br>
mixture while adjusting a tack value within a proper range.<br>
Because the liquid reactive diluent is contained in the ink<br>
composition of the present invention, a solvent is not necessary<br>
particularly. However depending on applications, a solvent which<br>
does not react with the components (A), (B) and (C) may be used. By<br>
using no solvent, there can be exhibited effects such as saving of<br>
resources, energy saving and control of pollution of atmosphere.<br>
The active energy curable ink composition of the present<br>
invention is, after printing, subjected to irradiation of active energy ray<br>
for curing to make an ink film. There can be used electromagnetic<br>
wave such as ultraviolet rays, visible light and infrared rays and<br>
electron beam as an active energy ray. Among them, ultraviolet rays<br>
are preferred since a curing rate is high, equipment for irradiation of<br>
active energy ray which is generally used can be used, and<br>
characteristics of a cured film are good.<br>
A substrate to be printed is not limited particularly.<br>
Examples thereof are metallic substrates, plastic substrates and the<br>
like.<br>
Examples of the metallic substrate are metals such as steel,<br>
stainless steel and aluminum; various plated metals; metals pre-coated<br>
or laminated with various plastics; and the like. Examples of the<br>
plastic substrate are, for instance, films, sheets and boards of<br><br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyester,<br>
acrylic resin, urethane resin and surface-treated films, sheets and<br>
boards thereof. Also there can be used acrylic resin-coated and<br>
urethane resin-coated papers as a substrate.<br>
The ink composition of the present invention can be applied<br>
to offset printing, gravure printing, flexographic printing, silk screen<br>
printing and the like. The ink composition is suitable and useful<br>
particularly for offset printing; since high quality of printed articles can<br>
be obtained at high speed at low cost as compared with other printing<br>
methods.<br>
The ink composition of the present invention is suitable as a<br>
printing ink, particularly as a printing ink for multi-color printing, and<br>
is excellent as an ink composition for multicoat printing (multi-color<br>
printing) for articles which are subjected to pressing, drawing,<br>
punching, bending, and the like after the printing.<br>
Examples of products requiring post-processing after<br>
multicoat printing (multi-color printing) are, for instance, metallic<br>
packages such as beverage cans, decorated cans for confectionery, etc.<br>
and cans for foods; transparent plastic cases for packaging cosmetics;<br>
products made by softening printed articles by heating and adhering<br>
them to curved articles (for example, dummy cans for vending<br>
machine); packages for cells, toothbrush, etc. made by heat-molding to<br>
the shapes thereof; heat-shrinkable film used for labels of plastic<br>
bottles; and the like. By using the ink composition of the present<br>
invention, inks of 2 to 6 colors can be printed continuously.<br>
Then multi-color offset printing by active energy curing<br>
method is explained below.<br><br>
In usual printing, an ink image is transferred and printed<br>
from a printing plate directly on an article to be printed. On the other<br>
hand, the multi-color offset printing by active energy curing method is<br>
a method of once transferring an image of a printed plate to a blanket<br>
and then printing on an article to be printed, and the printed ink is<br>
irradiated with active energy ray to form a cured ink layer. By<br>
repeating these procedures continuously, a multicoated article can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The offset printing is featured by being capable of printing a<br>
precise image on various articles vividly, being capable of reproducing<br>
gradation having soft tone, thus being suitable for multi-color printing,<br>
and being capable of printing at high speed.<br>
To the printing plate which is important for forming an<br>
image is continuously supplied damping water from a damping water<br>
circulation system. A pH value of the damping water is adjusted to be<br>
constant by adding alcohol and surfactant thereto. The damping<br>
water has functions of regulating transfer of ink to a printing area and<br>
a non-printing area, preventing ink from adhering to the non-printing<br>
area, washing the non-printing area and printing area, and<br>
maintaining the temperature of the plate constant. Generally<br>
speaking, hydrophilic materials cannot be used as starting materials<br>
for the ink for offset printing. An offset printing ink which has inferior<br>
suitability for the damping water absorbs the damping water by<br>
contact thereto and is emulsified. The emulsified ink loses flowability,<br>
thereby causing problems that printing cannot be carried out and the<br>
emulsified ink dissolved in the damping water adheres to the<br>
non-printing area and stains a printed article.<br><br>
In the active energy curable composition of the present<br>
invention, since a monofunctional, bifunctional or trifunctional<br>
compound (having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable double bonds) is used<br>
as the reactive diluent, an initial mechanical strength by the curing<br>
reaction is not so high, but the intermolecular force between the<br>
urethane bond and the functional group giving an acid value<br>
compensates for insufficiency of the mechanical strength and sufficient<br>
properties of the ink film can be obtained. Also even if an<br>
accumulated amount of irradiated energy is increased, there arises no<br>
excessive curing (crosslinking) because the number of functional<br>
groups is small, and proper mechanical properties can be maintained<br>
by the intermolecular force between the urethane bond and the<br>
functional group giving an acid value.<br>
Further the intermolecular force between the urethane bond<br>
and the functional group giving an acid value imparts flexibility to the<br>
ink film and gives affinity (adhesion) between the multi-color ink films.<br>
Therefore no back trapping arises, and good adhesion to a substrate,<br>
interlayer adhesion and following ability for mechanical processing<br>
after the printing can be obtained, resulting in good finishing.<br>
In the multi-color printing ink composition of the present<br>
invention, the reactive diluent having few functional groups is used,<br>
thereby preventing the ink film from being cured excessively.<br>
Therefore the ink composition can be used for any of ink layers.<br>
However depending on purposes and applications, components of the<br>
ink composition and amounts thereof may be changed for each ink<br>
layer in consideration of an accumulated amount of irradiated energy<br>
and kind of color pigment to be used.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Then the present invention is explained by means of<br>
examples, but is not limited to them. In the examples, "part"<br>
represents a part by mass.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE 1<br>
(Preparation of polyurethane having no radically polymerizable double<br>
bond)<br>
A solvent of Polyurethane 520 (polyurethane which is<br>
available from Arakawa Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. and comprises<br>
an aliphatic polyisocyanate component and a polyol component having<br>
no aromatic ring structure) was distilled off at 100°C under reduced<br>
pressure of 15 to 40 kPa, to obtain a urethane compound (Ala). To 60<br>
parts of this urethane compoxmd (Ala) was added, as a reactive diluent,<br>
40 parts of trimethylolpropanepropoxy triacrylate (Aronix M-310<br>
available from Toa Gosei Co., Ltd.) having a surface tension of 39<br>
mN/m at 20°C to prepare a liquid component (Ala).<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE 2<br>
(Preparation of polyurethane having radically polymerizable double<br>
bond)<br>
55.5 Parts of adipic acid was reacted with 44.5 parts of<br>
1,4-tetramethylene glycol until generation of water ceased, and a<br>
polyester polyol (average molecular weight: 800) was obtained. 42.1<br>
Parts of this polyester polyol, 37.4 parts of isophorone diisocyanate<br>
and 20.5 parts of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate were reacted at 90°C for five<br>
hours, and urethane acrylate (A2a) having NCO content of less than<br><br>
0.1 % was obtained. To 60 parts of this urethane acrylate (A2a) was<br>
added 40 parts of Aronix M-310 as a reactive diluent to prepare a<br>
liquid component (A2a).<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE 3<br>
(Preparation of polyester having no radically polymerizable double<br>
bond)<br>
48 Parts of phthalic anhydride, 37 parts of bisphenol A and<br>
15 parts of 1,6-hexanediol were subjected to esterification reaction at<br>
230°C to synthesize polyester (B1a). The obtained polyester contained<br>
carboxyl group and had an acid value of 50 mgKOH/g. To 60 parts of<br>
this polyester (Bla) was added 40 parts of Aronix M-310 as a reactive<br>
diluent to prepare a liquid component (B1a).<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE 4<br>
(Preparation of polyester having radically polymerizable double bond)<br>
42 Parts of phthalic anhydride, 36 parts of bisphenol A and<br>
19 parts of 1,6-hexanediol were subjected to esterification reaction at<br>
230°C until generation of water ceased. Then while blowing air at<br>
100° to 130°C, 3 parts of acrylic acid was introduced to the reaction<br>
system and the esterification reaction was continued until generation<br>
of water ceased, to obtain polyester acrylate (B2a). The obtained<br>
polyester acrylate contained carboxyl group and radically<br>
polymerizable double bond derived from the acrylic acid, and had an<br>
acid value of 10 mgKOH/g. To 60 parts of this polyester acrylate<br>
 (B2a) was added 40 parts of Aronix M-310 as a reactive diluent to<br>
prepare a liquid component (B2a).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A white ink having a tack value of 15 was prepared by<br>
mixing the following components in amounts mentioned below and<br>
then milling and stirring the mixture by using a three-roll mill.<br>
Components	Amount<br>
Urethane compound (A1a.)	25 parts<br>
Resin (B2a)	25 parts<br>
Titanium oxide (white pigment)	40 parts<br>
Ultraviolet curing catalyst 1	3 parts<br>
Ultraviolet curing catalyst 2	3 parts<br>
Hydroquinone (polymerization inhibitor)	0.5 part<br>
Aronix M-310	Amount for obtaining<br>
a tack value of 15<br>
In the above preparation, TIPAQUE CR-58 available from<br>
Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd. was used as a titanium oxide, and<br>
KAYACURE DETX-S and KAYACURE DMBI, both of which were<br>
available from Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. were used as the ultraviolet<br>
curing catalyst 1 and ultraviolet curing catalyst 2, respectively.<br>
The tack means a restoring force of the ink film in a<br>
predetermined width between the two rotating rollers which is<br>
generated by shearing of the ink layer on the surfaces of the rollers.<br>
The tack value is measured with a rotary tack meter designed for<br>
measuring the tack (JIS K5700).<br>
This white ink was printed in a coating thickness of 1.5 µm<br><br>
by offset printing on a steel, panel (200 µm thick) pre-coated with<br>
polyester to make an uncured panel. Then the following tests were<br>
carried out by using this uncured panel. The results are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
(Curability test 1: Set to touch)<br>
The uncured panel is subjected to irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
rays at a peak illumination of 1,000 mW/cm2 with an ultraviolet<br>
emitter (Model UVC-2519 with 160 W/cm metal halide lamp available<br>
from Ushio Inc.). A conveyor speed for feeding the panel into the<br>
emitter is changed, and whether or not the intended surface condition<br>
(film surface does not feel wet) is obtained is evaluated for each<br>
conveyor speed by touching the film surface with a finger. The surface<br>
condition is evaluated in the following five conveyor speeds. When the<br>
feeling of wet disappears at higher conveyor speed, curability is good.<br>
5: not less than 80 m/min<br>
4: not less than 70 m/min and less than 80 m/min<br>
3: not less than 60 m/min and less than 70 m/min<br>
2: not less than 50 m/min and less than 60 m/min<br>
1: less than 50 m/min<br>
(Curability test 2: Pencil hardness)<br>
The uncured panel is subjected to irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
rays at a peak illumination of 1,000 mW/cm2 at an accumulated<br>
amount of ultraviolet rays of 50 mJ/cm2 with an ultraviolet emitter<br>
(Model UVC-2519 with 160 W/cm metal halide lamp available from<br>
Ushio Inc.). A surface hardness of the obtained cured film is<br>
measured according to scratch hardness test (pencil hardness method)<br>
of JIS K5600.<br><br>
(Adhesion test 1: Adhesion to a substrate)<br>
The uncured panel is subjected to irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
rays at a peak illumination of 1,000 mW/cm2 at an accumulated<br>
amount of ultraviolet rays of 100 mJ/cm2 with an ultraviolet emitter<br>
(Model UVC-2519 with 160 W/cm metal halide lamp available from<br>
Ushio Inc.). With respect to adhesion to a substrate of the obtained<br>
cured film, a peeling test is carried out according to JIS K5600<br>
(cross-cut method).<br>
(Adhesion test 2: Overcoatability)<br>
The uncured panel is subjected to irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
rays at a peak illumination of 1,000 mW/cm2 at an accumulated<br>
amount of ultraviolet rays of 100 mJ/cm2 with an ultraviolet emitter<br>
(Model UVC-2519 with 160 W/cm metal halide lamp available from<br>
Ushio Inc.). The same white ink is printed on the obtained cured film<br>
in a thickness of 1.5 µm and is subjected to irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
rays under the same irradiation conditions to obtain a recoated cured<br>
film. Then an adhesive tape is adhered to the obtained recoated cured<br>
film and peeled off to evaluate an intercoat adhesion between the cured<br>
film layers. The evaluation is carried out by the following criteria.<br>
A: There is no peeling.<br>
B: There is partly recognized an intercoat adhesion failure.<br>
C: Film layers are completely separated from each other.<br>
(Bending resistance test: Processability)<br>
The uncured panel is subjected to irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
rays at a peak illumination, of 1,000 mW/cm2 at an accumulated<br>
amount of ultraviolet rays of 100 mJ/cm2 with an ultraviolet emitter<br>
(Model UVC-2519 with 160 W/cm metal halide lamp available from<br><br>
Ushio Inc.). A bending resistance test (cylindrical mandrel method) is<br>
carried out using the obtained cured panel according to JIS K5600,<br>
and a diameter of mandrel in which cracking arises on the cured film<br>
is investigated. The evaluation is carried out under the following<br>
criteria.<br>
A: Not more than 4 mm of mandrel diameter<br>
B: 5 to 8 mm of mandrel diameter<br>
C: More than 8mm of mandrel diameter<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the active energy curable ink composition of<br>
the present invention, since the number of radically polymerizable<br>
double bonds of the reactive diluent is not more than three, shrinkage<br>
at curing can be reduced, thereby making it possible to enhance<br>
adhesion to a substrate and overcoatability.<br><br>
On the other hand, by combination use of the urethane<br>
compound (A) and the resin (B) having an acid value, an intermolecular<br>
force between the urethane bond of the urethane compound (A) and<br>
the functional group of the resin (B) giving an acid value can<br>
compensate for reduction of a mechanical strength attributable to a<br>
decrease of crosslinking density which is caused as a result of making<br>
the number of radically polymerizable double bonds of the reactive<br>
diluent not more than three. This intermolecular force is much<br>
flexible as compared with solidification by crosslinking reaction, and<br>
therefore flexibility (bending resistance) required for post-processing<br>
can be improved.<br>
Further the presence of these functional groups can<br>
enhance not only adhesion to a substrate but also adhesion between<br>
the coating films in multicoat printing.<br>
Also since a polyisocyanate having an aromatic ring<br>
structure which has been usually used as a polyisocyanate component<br>
of urethane acrylate of conventional active energy curable ink<br>
composition is not used in the present invention, yellowing can be<br>
minimized and a brilliant printed article can be provided.<br>
Also since a hydrophobic (surface tension: not more than 39<br>
mN/m) reactive diluent is used, the composition can be used as an ink<br>
for offset printing and also as a general purpose ink.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	An active energy curable ink composition for multicoat printing<br>
which comprises (A) a urethane compound comprising a reaction product of a polyol<br>
component such as herein described with a polyisocyanate component such as herein<br>
described having no aromatic ring structure, (B) a resin such as herein described<br>
having an acid value of 5 to 100 mgKOH/g and (C) a reactive diluent such as herein<br>
described having radically polymerizable double bond, wherein at least one of the<br>
compound (A) and the resin (B) has a radically polymerizable double bond, and only<br>
a compound having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable double bonds and having a surface<br>
tension of not more than 39 mN/m (at 20°C) is used as the reactive diluent (C).<br>
2.	The ink composition as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said urethane<br>
compound (A) does not have an aromatic ring structure.<br>
3.	The ink composition as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein said resin<br>
(B) having an acid value is polyester such as herein described.<br>
4.	The ink composition as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3, wherein a<br>
functional group giving the acid value of the resin (B) is carboxyl.<br>
5.	The ink composition as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, wherein said<br>
urethane compound (A) has a radically polymerizable double bond.<br>
6.	The ink composition as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, wherein said<br>
resin (B) has a radically polymerizable double bond.<br>
7.	The ink composition as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6, which<br>
optionally comprises an active energy curing catalyst such as herein described.<br><br>
The invention discloses an active energy curable ink composition for multicoat<br>
printing which comprises (A) a urethane compound comprising a reaction product of<br>
a polyol component such as herein described with a polyisocyanate component such<br>
as herein described having no aromatic ring structure, (B) a resin such as herein<br>
described having an acid value of 5 to 100 mgKOH/g and (C) a reactive diluent such<br>
as herein described having radically polymerizable double bond, wherein at least one<br>
of the compound (A) and the resin (B) has a radically polymerizable double bond,<br>
and only a compound having 1 to 3 radically polymerizable double bonds and having<br>
a surface tension of not more than 39 mN/m (at 20°C) is used as the reactive diluent<br>
(C).<br></td>
