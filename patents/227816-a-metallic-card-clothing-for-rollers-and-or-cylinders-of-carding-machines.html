				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to metallic card clothing for rollers and/or cylinders<br>
of cleaners, carding machines, which rollers or cylinders have a higher<br>
circumferential speed than rollers arranged upstream in the fiber flow direction,<br>
the card clothing having teeth with a positive front angle of =0°.<br>
The rollers in question are e.g. licker-ins, strippers or transfer rollers on carding<br>
machines, and the cylinders of a carding machine. Said rollers or cylinders<br>
actively take over raw fiber material with the front edge of thefront angle of the<br>
teeth of the corresponding metallic card clothing.<br>
The problem in such card clothings is that positive front angles are needed for<br>
ensuring an easy fiber take-over. This, however, tends to make the tooth tip<br>
leaner, which makes said card clothings more sensitive during assembly and also<br>
during resharpening. Moreover, impurities or dirt in the raw fiber material may<br>
be impaled more easily.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a metallic card<br>
clothing of the above-indicated type which eliminates the drawbacks observed in<br>
the prior art while maintaining good take-over properties.<br>
The object is achieved in a metallic card clothing of the above-indicated typed in<br>
that the teeth have a head angle which is &gt;85°, preferably &gt; 87°, the length of<br>
the head surface extending at said angle from the tooth tip to the tooth back<br>
being at least 12% of the length of the tooth pitch.<br>
The advantages resulting from such a tool shape are that a<br>
clogging of the card clothings is prevented on the one hand and<br>
that although the card clothing still shows the aggressiveness or<br>
activity needed for carding, it is obtuse to contamination.<br>
Furthermore, the teeth of the metallic card clothing are more<br>
stable and less sensitive during assembly and resharpening.<br>
Moreover, in the case of soiled raw fiber materials, such as<br>
cotton, and impaling of foreign matter is prevented. As a result,<br>
the card clothing need not be cleaned so often. On the whole, it<br>
has been found that apart from the advantages to be expected the<br>
carding quality is also improved.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the head angle of the tooth<br>
is 90 . This has the effect that even after a regrinding of the<br>
card clothing the same conditions prevail on all teeth, which in<br>
turn improves the carding quality.<br>
Morever, it is particularly preferred when the length of the head<br>
surface is at least 25% of the tooth pitch.<br>
It is further preferred when the length of the head surface is at<br>
least three times, preferably five times. the width thereof.<br>
Finally, it has been found to be advantageous when the length of<br>
the head surface is greater than or equal to half the tooth<br>
height, measured from the tooth base to the tooth tip. This<br>
yields a relatively low card clothing which surprisingly creates<br>
favorable carding conditions. It is particularly preferred when<br>
the length of the head surface corresponds to the tooth height.<br>
Finally, it is also advantageous when the tooth back adjacent to<br>
the head surface encloses an angle between 20 and 30°,<br>
preferably 25°, with the subsequent tooth front. This opening<br>
angle between tooth back and ....................................<br>
tooth front tends to be smaller than in the prior-at card clothings. It is however<br>
adequate for ensuring an easy take-over of the fibers from the roller arranged<br>
upstream in the work direction.<br>
The above-described metallic card clothing is particularly well suited for cylinders<br>
of cotton carding machines so-called high-performance carding machines having<br>
a circumferential cylinder speed of more than 1500 m/min and a cylinder metallic<br>
card clothing having a total height of less than 3 mm and a base width of less<br>
than 0.7 mm. Therefore particular protection is sought for such a cotton carding<br>
machine equipped with a metallic card clothing according to the invention.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be explained in more detail with<br>
reference to a drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a carding machine in a side view;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the tooth geometry of a metallic card clothing according to a first<br>
embodiment;<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the illustration of Fig. 2 along line III-III;<br>
Fig. 4 shows the geometry of a metallic card clothing according to a further<br>
embodiment; and<br>
Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken along line V-V of Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration showing a carding machine comprising a<br>
cylinder, feed rollers 2, a licker-in 3 and strippers 4. The.......................................<br>
circumferential rotational direction of the rollers is shown in Fig. 1 by<br>
corresponding arrows.<br>
The card clothing described in the following refers to such rollers or<br>
sylinders that actively take over fibers from rollers arranged upstream in<br>
the work direction. These are by way of example the licker-in 3, the<br>
strippers 4 and, particularly, cylinder 1 in the illustration shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 2 only shows in sections a sawtooth wire of a metallic card clothing,<br>
as is provided for the cylinder shown in Fig. 1. This is a sawtooth wire<br>
having a total height of 2 mm and a tooth pitch, measured from the tooth<br>
tip 5 to the next one 5', of 1.7 mm. The front angle a of the tooth front 6<br>
measured relative to the vertical is 40º in the illustrated embodiment. In<br>
contrast to the formerly known metallic card clothings, the tooth back 7<br>
does not directly follow the tooth tip. Rather, a head surface 8 is first<br>
provided. The angle of the head surface surface ß, again measured<br>
relative to the vertical, is 87° in the embodiment shown in Fig.2. The<br>
length L of the head surface 8 is 0.5 mm, its width B (cf. Fig.3) is 0.07<br>
mm. The tooth height H, measured from the tooth base to the tooth tip<br>
5, is slightly less than 0.5 mm.<br>
The angle ? enclosed by the tooth front 6 and the tooth back 7 is 24° in<br>
the illustrated embodiment.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 show a further variant of a sawtooth wire for an inventive<br>
metallic card clothing. Identical and similar components are provided<br>
with the same reference numerals as in the preceding embodiment.<br>
In contrast to the former embodiment, the distance between tooth tip 5<br>
and neighbouring tooth tip 5' is just 1.5 mm. The front angle a is just<br>
30°. The angle ? enclosed between tooth front 6 and tooth back 7 is 25°<br>
in this embodiment.<br>
Operation and function of the above-described embodiments shall now<br>
be explained in more detail in the following.<br>
The two embodiments do not fundamentally differ from each other. The<br>
sawtooth wire shwon in Fig.2 has, however, a larger front angle which is<br>
in principle favorable for a more active fiber take-over. Of importance to<br>
the two variants is, however, that at a relatively small tooth height a long<br>
head surface is provided that is almost not inclined and therefore gives<br>
the tooth tip and the whole card clothing an enhanced stability. Apart<br>
from these advantages, however, it should be emphasized that the tooth<br>
geometry is virtually not changed even after regrinding of the card<br>
clothing, so that virtually the same conditions prevail on all teeth on the<br>
one hand and the carding quality does not change even after grinding of<br>
the card clothings on the other hand.<br>
The card clothings are mounted in the conventional way.<br>
