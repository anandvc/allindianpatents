				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CYCLIC THIOETHERS AND INTERMEDIATES<br>
THEREOF<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing cyclic<br>
thioethers, and more particularly, to novel compounds for producing cyclic thioethers,<br>
production processes therefor and methods of use.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
The following processes are known as processes for synthesizing cyclic<br>
thioethers.<br>
W. E. Parham et al. in J. Org. Chem., 41,2628 (1976) disclose a process for<br>
synthesizing cyclic thioethers by reacting thiourea with 1-bromo-2-<br>
(bromomethyl)benzene and hydrolysis thereof to obtain (2-bromophenyl)methanethiol,<br>
and then following lithium-halogen exchange of (2-bromophenyl)methanethiol with<br>
butyl lithium, reacting the resulting product with a ketone (G represents NMe or CH2) to<br>
obtain mercapto alcohol followed finally by a dehydration reaction with sulfuric acid.<br><br>
(In the above formula, Bu represents n-butyl, and G represents &gt;CH2 or &gt;NCH3.)<br>
Japanese Patent Application (Kokai) No. Hei 10-182649 discloses a process<br>
for synthesizing a cyclic thioether by converting the hydroxyl group of (2-<br>
bromophenyl)methanol to a leaving group with a sulfonyl halide such as<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, and after converting to an<br><br>
acetylthio group, removing the acetyl group by hydrolyzing to obtain (2-<br>
bromophenyl)methanethiol, and then carrying out a lithium-halogen exchange by<br>
reacting with butyl lithium, followed by reacting with a ketone to obtain a<br>
mercaptoalcohol compound followed by a dehydration reaction.<br>
(In the above formula, Ac represents acetyl, Bu represents n-butyl, tBu represents tert-<br>
butyl, and R represents methyl or p-tolyl.)<br>
Hirokazu Kubota et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 46, 242 (1998) disclose a<br>
process for synthesizing a cyclic thioether by reacting (2-bromophenyl)methanethiol or<br>
2-(2-bromophenyl)ethanethiol with butyl lithium to carry out a lithium-halogen<br>
exchange, followed by reaction of the resulting product with a ketone to obtain a<br>
mercapto alcohol and finally carrying out a dehydration reaction with trifluoroacetic<br>
acid. <br>
(In the above formula, Bu represents n-butyl, Et represents ethyl, and m represents 1 or<br>
2.)<br>
The (2-bromophenyl)methanethiol used as the starting material in the process of<br>
Hirokazu Kubota et al. is known to be synthesized by reacting 1-bromo-2-<br>
(bromomethyl)benzene with thiourea or derivatives thereof followed by hydrolysis<br>
(Overberger et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 78, 666 (1956) and T. Annalisa et al., Farmaco,<br>
45, 617 (1990)), and the process requires at least two steps.<br>
These processes have the disadvantages of requiring two equivalents of<br>
organic lithium reagent (resulting in high costs), having a large number of steps and<br>
having a low synthetic yield, and none of the processes are suited for industrial<br>
production of cyclic thioethers from the viewpoint of economic feasibility.<br>
As a result of conducting extensive studies for the purpose of overcoming<br>
these disadvantages and establishing an industrial process for the production of cyclic<br>
thioethers, the inventors of the present invention found that cyclic thioethers can be<br>
obtained, by going through the compounds of the general formulae (3) and (5), in fewer<br>
steps and less expensively than the known processes, thereby leading to completion of<br>
the present invention.<br>

(wherein, Ar, Gl, Rl, R2, X1 and X2 have the same meanings as defined above).<br>
The first step is a step, wherein a compound (3) is produced by reacting a<br>
halogenated aryl compound (1) with a thiol compound (2) in an inert solvent in the<br>
presence of a base.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the inert solvent to be used, provided that<br>

Furthermore, in the case where an optically active cyclic sulfoxide compound<br>
(7) is desired in the present step, either (a) optical resolution is carried out on a racemic<br>
cyclic sulfoxide compound (7), or (b) an optically active form is obtained by<br>
asymmetric oxidation of compound (6) directly,<br>
(a-1) In the case of carrying out optical resolution by diastereomeric salt formation,<br>
after removal of the amino protecting group from the racemic cyclic sulfoxide<br>
compound (7) if it is present, a salt is formed using a suitable optically active carboxylic<br>
acid for the optical resolution reagent followed by separation crystallization to obtain an<br>
optically active salt of cyclic sulfoxide compound (7).<br>
Removal of the amino protecting group in the first stage of the reaction can be<br>
carried out in accordance with known methods, and can be removed by, for example, by<br>
treating with acid or base in an inert solvent.<br>

dimethoxycamphoryl)sulfonyl]oxaziridine reported by F. A. Davis et al. is particularly<br>

material compound, reaction reagents and solvent used, it is normally from 10 minutes<br>
to 3 days and preferably from 2 hours to 1 day.<br>
The fifth step is a step, wherein the compound (9) is produced by removing<br>
the amino protecting group from the cyclic sulfoxide compound (7) if present, and<br>
reacting the resulting compound with compound (8).<br>
Removal of the amino protecting group (R2) is carried out according to the<br>
procedure for removal of the amino protecting group of the fourth step.<br>
The reaction between the compound obtained in the first stage reaction and<br>
compound (8) is carried out in an inert solvent and in the presence of base.<br>

alkaline metal hydrogencarbonates. Furthermore, the addition of a catalytic amount of<br>
an alkaline metal iodide such as potassium iodide or sodium iodide is useful for the<br>
purpose of accelerating the reaction.<br>
The reaction temperature can be, for example, 0 to 150°C, and preferably 20<br>
to 120°C.<br>
While the reaction time varies depending mainly on the reaction temperature,<br>
raw material compound, reaction reagents or inert solvent used, it is usually from 30<br>
minutes to 48 hours and preferably from 1 hour to 12 hours.<br>
After the reaction, the desired compound is recovered from the reaction<br>
mixture in accordance with ordinary methods.<br>
For example, after adding water to the reaction mixture and extracting with an<br>
immiscible solvent such as toluene, the extract is washed with water and so forth and<br>
then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, etc. to obtain the desired compound after<br>
distilling off the solvent.<br>
The resulting compound can be separated and purified by ordinary methods<br>
such as re-crystallization, re-precipitation or silica gel chromatography if necessary.<br>
Moreover, compound (9) can be easily derivatised to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt by treating in accordance with ordinary methods using an acid (examples<br>
of which include an inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid or<br>
phosphoric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, fumaric acid or succinic acid,<br>
and preferably hydrogen chloride or fumaric acid) if desired.<br>

and the organic layer was sequentially washed with 500 ml of 5% aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution and 500 ml of water. After drying the organic layer with<br>
magnesium sulfate, the solvent was distilled off to obtain 300 ml of residue, which was<br>

at -70°C. After stirring for 15 minutes at the same temperature, a solution of 74.9 g<br>
(438 mmol) of N-ethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone in 300 ml of toluene was dropped in<br>
over the course of 1 hour or more while maintaining at -70°C. After stirring for 1<br>
hour at the same temperature, the temperature was raised to about -20°C followed by<br>
the sequential addition of 500 ml of 20% aqueous ammonium chloride solution and<br>
350 ml of toluene. The aqueous layer was separated, and the organic layer was<br>

the organic layer under reduced pressure, 200 ml of toluene and 1000 ml of heptane<br>
were added to the residue followed by stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. After<br>
cooling to 0 to 5°C and stirring for an additional 30 minutes, the precipitated crystals<br>
were filtered out. The resulting crystals were dried for 15 hours under reduced<br>

aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was dropped in until the pH reached 13 to 14<br>
followed by stirring for 30 minutes after heating to 40°C. After cooling to 10°C or<br>

additionally stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. After cooling to 0 to 5°C and<br>
additionally stirring for 30 minutes, the precipitated crystals were filtered out. The<br>
resulting crystals were then dried for 15 hours at 50°C under reduced pressure to obtain<br>
