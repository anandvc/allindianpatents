				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to communication terminals and methods for<br>
modulating and demodulating data for transmission/reception and, more<br>
particularly, to a communication terminal and a method for detecting a<br>
characteristic of a communication medium, changing a communication parameter<br>
for modulation/demodulation so as to cause the communication parameter to<br>
follow the state of the communication medium, and transmitting/receiving<br>
modulated/demodulated data based on the communication parameter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In general, in the case of a system where the characteristic of a communication<br>
medium is fluctuated with time (for example, a wireless communication system<br>
where multipath fading occurs or a power-line communication system influenced<br>
by group delay), the communication-medium characteristic is significantly<br>
fluctuated depending on a positional relation between a transmission terminal<br>
and a reception terminal. Therefore, in a communication system using a multi-<br>
carrier transmission scheme in which a communication parameter, such as a sub-<br>
carrier for use and a modulation scheme, is selected for communication<br>
depending on the communication-medium characteristic, the communication-<br>
medium characteristic is detected between the transmission terminal and the<br>
reception terminal for selecting a communication parameter. In this specification,<br><br>
a series of processes of detecting a communication-medium characteristic and<br>
selecting a communication parameter is hereinafter referred to as a<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme. In this communication-<br>
medium-characteristic detecting scheme, the quality of a communication medium<br>
on each sub-carrier is evaluated. Therefore, the communication-medium-<br>
characteristic detecting scheme is also referred to channel estimation.<br>
Particularly, in a communication system using a multi-carrier transmission<br>
scheme, when the communication parameter is changed for each sub-carrier<br>
depending on the state of the communication medium for each sub-carrier, a<br>
deteriorated sub-carrier may be controlled so as not to be used for the purpose<br>
of preventing data from being transmitted on that deteriorated sub-carrier (for<br>
example, in Discrete Multi Tone (DMT) scheme). In such a communication<br>
scheme, a special evaluation-series packet using all sub-carrier is employed for<br>
communication-medium estimation, thereby estimating all sub-carriers and<br>
performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme (channel<br>
estimation) (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-158675).<br>
Such a conventional method of executing the communication-medium-<br>
characteristic detecting scheme significantly depends on a characteristic unique<br>
to the communication medium (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
2000-184061).<br><br>
In a known scheme for making the method as less depend on the characteristic<br>
unique to the communication medium as possible, the communication-medium-<br>
characteristic detecting scheme is performed in predetermined cycles or upon <br>
estimation that the communication-medium characteristic is deteriorated when<br>
the number of packet retransmissions exceeds a predetermined number (for<br>
example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-158675).<br>
In another scheme, a transmission speed, an error rate, and a reception signai<br>
intensity are measured for determining a transmission scheme (for example,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-209537).<br>
Further, there is an HSDPA communication system as a technique to achieve<br>
high peak transmission speed, low delay, and high throughput (e.g. •<br>
KR20030017349).<br>
FIG. 12 is a sequence diagram showing a conventional scheme for determining a<br>
timing of performing the communicatton-medium-characteristic detecting scheme<br>
independently of the characteristic unique to the communication medium. In<br>
FIG. 12, a transmission terminal 9000 transmits an evaluation-series packet 9001<br>
for detecting a communication-medium characteristic to a reception terminal<br>
9100 in order to determine a communication parameter for defining a<br><br>
scheme of modulating data to be transmitted to the reception<br>
terminal 9100. The reception terminal 9100 uses the<br>
evaluation-series packet 9 901 from the transmission terminal 9000<br>
to detect a communication-medium characteristic for each<br>
sub-carrier, and then transmits an evaluation-result packet 9002<br>
containing information regarding the detected<br>
communication-medium characteristic to the transmission terminal<br>
9000. Based on the evaluation-result packet 9002, the<br>
transmission terminal 9000 ascertains the communication quality<br>
for each sub-carrier, and determines a communication parameter<br>
for each sub-carrier. The transmission terminal 9000 then uses<br>
the determined communication parameter to modulate data, and then<br>
transmits a data sequence 9D03 including a plurality of packets<br>
to the reception terminal 9100. As illustrated in PIG. 12, it<br>
is assumed herein that packet, losses occur-when the data sequence<br>
9003 is transmitted. When such packet losses occur, the<br>
transmission terminal 9000 ratransmits the lost packets. Unless<br>
the number of retransmissions exceeds a predetermined value, the<br>
transmission terminal 900O transmits the data sequence without<br>
performing a communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme until the next: cycle of performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme. When the<br>
next cycle of performing the ccmmunication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme arrives, the transmission terminal 9000 transmits<br>
an evaluation-series packet 9904. Then, as described above, the<br><br>
transmission terminal 9000 uses an, evaluation-result packet 9005<br>
from the reception terminal 9100 to determine a communication<br>
parameter for each sub-carrier for modulation based on the<br>
communication parameter, and then transmits a data sequence 9006.<br>
As illustrated in FiG. 12, it is assumed herein that packet<br>
losses occur when the data sequence 9006 is transmitted. When<br>
such packet losses occur, the transmission terminal 9000<br>
retransmits lost packets. When the number of retransmissions<br>
exceeds the predetermined number, the transmission terminal 9000<br>
determines that the state of the communication medium is<br>
deteriorated, and then transmits an ©evaluation-series packet 9007<br>
for detecting the communication-medium characteristic The<br>
reception terminal returns an evaluation-result packet 9008 to<br>
the transmission terminal 9000. Based on the evaluation-result<br>
packet 9008, the transmission terminal 9000 determines a<br>
communication parameter for modulation based on the communication<br>
parameter and transmission of the following packets.<br>
As such, in the conventional communication systems, the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
performed cyclically or when the number of retransmissions of the<br>
packets exceeds the predetermined number, thereby determining a<br>
communication parameter so as to follow the current state of the<br>
communication medium.<br>
PIG. 13 is a graph showing a relation between a communication<br>
rate and a state of the communication medium in a conventional<br><br>
case where the communication-medium-characteristio detecting<br>
scheme is cyclically performed. Here, the communication rate is<br>
a communication speed calculated by the set communication<br>
parameter.<br>
In FIG, 13. times T1011 and T1012 represent times of starting<br>
the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme. As<br>
illustrated in PIG. 13, ija the method of cyclically performing<br>
the communication -medium characteristic detecting scheme, the<br>
communication parameter determined at the previous time T1011 is<br>
used during a period until the next time T1012 arrives even if<br>
the state of the comraunicat ion medium is fluctuated. During this<br>
period, a svh-carrior or a modulating scheme adapted to<br>
fluctuations in the state of the communication medium cannot be<br>
used. Therefore, packets transmitted from the transmission<br>
terminal cannot normally arrive at the reception terminal, thereby<br>
disadvantageously decreasing a throughput. For example, in a<br>
section p1 illustrated in FIG- 13, communication is tried at a<br>
high communication rate even through the state of the communication<br>
medium is deteriorated, thereby increasing losses of the packets<br>
to be transmitted and decreeing the throughput. Also, there is<br>
another problem in which a period from the time when the state<br>
of the communication medium is fluctuated to the time when the<br>
communication parameter is changed is long.<br>
One way of solving these problems is to shorten the cycle<br>
of performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br><br>
scheme so as to follow fluctuations of the state of the communication<br>
medium. In the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme, the reception terminal evaluates a reception CINR (Carrier<br>
to Interference and Noise power Ratio) for each sub-carrier. In<br>
order to improve the accuracy in CINR evaluation, the transmission<br>
terminal transmits an evaluation-series packet having a long data<br>
length (the number of symbols). Therefore, as the number of time<br>
of performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme is increased, the. temporal proportion of the<br>
evaluation-series packet is increased in the communication system.<br>
For this reason, even if fluctuations in the state of the<br>
communication medium is followed by shortening the cycle, the<br>
throughput in the entire system is not improved.<br>
FIG. 14 is a graph showing a relation between a communication<br>
rate and the state of the communication medium in a conventional<br><br>
case where the' communicatlon-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme is performed when the number of packet retransmissions<br>
exceeds a predetermined value. In FIG. 14, times T1013 and T1015<br>
represent times when the cycle of detecting the<br>
communication-medium characteristic arrives. Time T1014<br>
represents a time when the communicatlon-medium-characterlstic<br>
detecting scheme is performed because the number of packet<br>
retransmissions exceeds a predetermined value. As illustrated<br>
in FIG. 14, in the method of performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme when the<br><br>
number of packet retransmissions exceeds a predetermined value,<br>
if the state of the communication medium is deteriorated, a<br>
modulation parameter is changed so as to follow the deterioration,<br>
thereby decreasing the communication rate. However. even if the<br>
state of the communication medium is changed from a deteriorated<br>
state to an improved state, communication is performed by using<br>
the communication parameter adapted to the deteriorated state of<br>
the communication medium (refer to a section P2 in FIG. 14).<br>
Therefore, this poses a problem in which, even if the state of<br>
the communication medium is improved, the throughput is not<br>
improved.<br>
As such, conventional problems include a decrease in<br>
throughput in the entire communication system because the<br>
communication parameter cannot follow the state of the<br>
communication medium particularly when the state of the<br>
communication medium is changed from a deteriorated state to an<br>
improved state, and a long timie period from the time when the state<br>
of the communication medium is fluctuated to the time when the<br>
communication parameter is changed. These problem could further<br>
pose a problem, for example, la which a user cannot continuously<br>
view video streams of satisfactory quality during a period until<br>
the communication parameter is changed to an adequate one because<br>
the state of the communication medium is deteriorated.<br><br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a communication terminal and a method for modulating and<br>
demodulating data by detecting a characteristic of a communication<br>
medium and following the state of the communication medium for<br>
modulating and demodulating data for transmission and reception,<br>
wherein a communication parameter is allowed to follow even a change<br>
in the state of the communication medium from a deteriorated state<br>
to an improved state.<br>

state of the communication medium is deteriorated but also the<br>
state is improved. Also, the information element is extracted<br>
based on the information obtained during a normal procedure in<br>
packet transmission and. reception. Therefore, the present<br>
invention allows a communication parameter to be selected so as<br>
to follow the state of the communication medium for communication<br>
without decreasing the -throughput in the entire communication<br>
system.	<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the structure of a<br>
communication terminal 100 according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 1, a communication terminal 100<br>
Includes an access control unit 101, a transmission buffer 102,<br>
a reception buffer 103, an error-correction processing unit 104,<br>
and a modulating/demodulating unit 105. The communication<br>
terminal 100 uses a multi-carrier transmission scheme to modulate<br>
or demodulate a packet containing data to be transmitted to or<br>
received from an upper-layer or a control packet with a lower-layer<br>
(hereinafter simply referred to as a packet) for transmission or<br>
reception. Hereinafter, as a typical example, description is made<br>
to transmission or reception of a packet containing data to be<br>
transmitted to or received from an upper layer. However, the<br>
description can also be applied to transmission or reception of<br>
a control packet or the like with a lower layer. The communication<br>
/<br>
terminal 100 transmits aJpacket to another communication terminal<br>
according to an access scheiule described in a schedule packet<br>
transmitted from a control terminal (not shown) on a network. A<br>
communication medium between these communication terminals may<br>
be wired or wireless.<br>
The access control unit 101 controls an access to the<br>
communication medium from the communication terminal 100. For<br>
performing a communicatioa-medium-characteristic detecting<br><br>
scheme, the access control unit 101 causes an evaluation-series<br>
packet to be transmitted to the modulating/demodulating unit 105.<br>
In response to this, based on an evaluation-result packet returned<br>
from the communication terminal at the receiving side, the access<br>
control unit 101- ascertains a communication-medium characteristic<br>
for each sub-carrier, determines a communication parameter for<br>
each sub-carrier, and instincts the modulating/demodulating unit<br>
105 to use the communication parameter for modulation or<br>
demodulation. The communication parameter includes Information<br>
about which sub-carrier is to be used, an index of modulation with<br>
the sub-carrier to be used, and information about a modulating<br>
scheme with the sub-carrier to be used.<br>
The transmission buffor 102 Includes one or more transmission<br>
queues 102a each for each of destination communication terminals<br>
as communication counterparts (or for each packet type) for storing<br>
transmission packets.<br>
The reception buffer 103 includes one or more reception<br>
queues 103a each for each of transmission-source communication<br>
terminals (or for each packet type) for storing received packets.<br>
The error-correction processing unit 104 performs error<br>
correction on a reception packet, and then stores the<br>
error-corrected packet in one of the reception queue 103a.<br>
The modulating/demodulating unit 105 demodulates a packet<br>
received through the communication medium based on the<br>
communication parameter provided by the access control unit 101,<br><br>
obtains a reception packet stored in one of the reception queue<br>
103a for transfer to the upper layer through the upper interface.<br>
The access control unit 101 calculates, for each of the<br>
transmission-counterpart terminals, the number of packets to be<br>
transmitted (hereinafter referred to as the number of transmission<br>
packets) for each timing for packet: transmission, and then causes<br>
the number of transmission packets to be stored in the transmission<br>
buffer 102.<br>
The access control unit 101 counts, for each of the<br>
transmission counterpart terminals, the number of retransmissions<br>
of a packet (hereinafter referred to as the number of packet<br>
retransmissions) for each timing of receiving a notification from<br>
the terminal at the receiving side that apacket failed to be normally<br>
received or for each timing of retransmitting a packet, and then<br>
causes the number of packet retransmissions to be stored in the<br>
transmission buffer l02.<br><br>
The access control unit 101 retains a first timer for counting<br>
a predetermined cycle for performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme. When<br>
notified by the first timer that the predetermined cycle for<br>
performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme arrives, the access control unit 101 perforins the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme with this<br>
notification being taken as a trigger. Hereinafter, the<br>
predetermined cycle for performing the<br><br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is referred<br>
to as a basic cycle.<br>
Also, the access control unit 101 retains a second timer<br>
for counting a predetermined cycle which is shorter than the basic<br>
cycle for analyzing fluctuations of information elements (which<br>
will be described further below). When notified by the second<br>
timer that the predetermined cycle for analyzing fluctuations of<br>
the information elements arrives, the access control unit 101<br>
starts analyzing fluctuations of the information elements.<br>
Hereinafter, the predetermined cycle for analyzing fluctuations<br>
of the information elements is referred to as a fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle. Note that the fluctuation analyzing cycle may<br>
be synchronized with a sampling cycle of an analog signal.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing the operation of the access<br>
control unit 101 in a f luotuation analyzing-cycle. With reference<br>
to FIG. 2, the operation of the access control unit in a fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle is described below. Note that packet<br>
transmission/reception is performed concurrently with the<br><br>
operation shown in FIG. 2 Therefore, the number of transmission<br>
packets and the number of packet retransmissions are stored<br>
concurrently with the operation shown in FIG. 2.<br>
The procedure shown it, FIG. 2 starts with a notification<br>
from the second timer of starting a fluctuation analyzing cycle<br>
as a trigger.<br>
First, the access control unit 101 performs a process of<br><br>
extracting and storing an information element (step S100) - Here,<br>
the information element is a piece of information reflecting the<br>
state of the communication medium, and can be obtained as a result<br>
of packet transmission. The information element according to the<br>
first embodiment are a piece of information indicative of packet<br>
transmission efficiency. In order to reduce a processing load<br>
on the communication terminal, the information element is<br>
preferably a piece of information that can be easily calculated.<br>
In the first embodiment, as the information elements, a ratio of<br>
occurrence of packet retransmission and an average number of<br>
packets not yet transmitted are used for indicating the packet<br>
transmission efficiency. Note that the information elements<br>
described herein are merely an example, and are not meant to be<br>
restrictive as long as they are pieces of information indicative<br>
of the packet transmission efficiency. -<br>
Specifically, in stej.S100, the access control unit 101<br>
calculates a ratio of occurrence of retransmission based on a total<br>
number of transmission packets and a total number of packet<br>
retransmissions at the tome of starting a fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle, and then causes the calculated ratio to be stored in the<br>
transmission buffer 102. For example, the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmissions is calculated by (the total number of packet<br>
retransmission)/(the total number of transmission packets + the<br>
total number of packet retransmission).<br>
Also, in step S100, the access control unit 101 counts and<br><br>
the number of packets not yet transmitted that are contained in<br>
the transmission queues 102a for each communication counterpart<br>
and, based on the summed results, calculates an average number<br>
of packets not yet transmitted, and then causes the calculated<br>
number to be stored in the transmission buffer 102. For example,<br>
the average number of packets not yet transmitted is calculated<br>
by (an average number of packets not yet transmitted at the time<br>
of starting the previous fluctuation analyzing cycle + the number<br>
of packets not yet transmitted at the time of starting the current<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle )/2. Tine average number of packets<br>
not yet transmitted is a numerical value indicating the degree<br>
of a load imposed on packet transmission depending on the state<br>
of the communication medium. As the average number of packets<br>
not yet transmitted is larger, the load is larger.<br>
Next, the access control unit 101 determines whether data<br><br>
having an amount enough to estimate the state of the communication<br>
medium has been transmitted in a data sequence for transmitting<br>
a group of transmission packets from the transmitting side to the<br>
receiving side. This determination is made depending on whether<br>
the number of transmission packets stored in the transmission<br>
buffer 102 is equal to or larger than a predetermined minimum number<br>
of packets (step S101). If the number of transmission packets<br>
is not larger than the minimum number of packets, the access control<br>
unit 101 goes to an operation in step S106. On the other hand,<br>
if the number of transmission packets is equal to or larger than<br><br>
the predetermined minimum number of packets, the access control<br>
unit 101 goes to an operation in step S102.<br>
In step S102, the access control unit 101 calculates, as<br>
a difference value in ratio of occurrence of retransmission, an<br>
absolute value of a difference between a ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission in the current fluctuation analyzing cycle (first<br>
information element) and a Minimum value of ratios of occurrence<br>
of retransmission previously calculated (hereinafter referred to<br>
as a minimum ratio of occurrence of retransmission) (second<br>
information element), and then determines whether the calculated<br>
difference value in ratio of occurrence of retransmission is<br>
smaller than a predetermined threshold of the difference value<br>
in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission. Note that the minimum<br>
ratio of occurrence of retransmission is not yet set in the first<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle and therefore is 0. In any of the<br>
following fluctuation analyxing cycles, the value set in step S106,<br>
which will be described further below, is used as the minimum ratio<br>
of occurrence of retransmission.<br>
If the difference value in ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission is not smaller than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission, the access<br>
control unit 101 goes to an operation in step S105. On the other<br>
hand, if the difference value in ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission is smaller than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission, the access<br><br>
control unit 101 goes to an operation in step S103.<br>
In step S103, the access control unit 101 calculates a<br>
transmission-speed settling value, and then determines whether the<br>
calculated transmission-speed setting value is smaller than a<br>
threshold of the transmiss:.on-speed setting value. Specifically,<br>
the access control unit 101 calculates, for each sub-carrier, an<br>
amount of data that can be transmitted per one symbol block (in<br>
units of bits) based on the communication parameter set in the<br>
modulating/demodulating unit 105, and then sums the calculated<br>
amounts of data for calculating the transmission-speed setting<br>
value.<br>
If the calculated transmission-speed setting value is not<br>
smaller than the threshold of the transmission- speed setting value,<br>
the access control unit 101 goes to the operation in step S106.<br>
On the other hand, if the-calculated transmission-speed setting<br>
value is smaller than the threshold of the transmission-speed<br>
setting value, the access control unit 101 goes to an operation<br>
in step S104.<br>
In step S104, the access control unit 101 divides an absolute<br>
value of a difference between an average number of packets not<br>
yet transmitted that is calculated in the current fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle (first information element) and an average number<br>
of packets not yet transmitted that was calculated in the previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle (second information element) by the<br>
average number of packets not yet transmitted, thereby calculating<br><br>
an average difference in the number of packets not yet transmitted,<br>
and then determines whether the calculated average difference in<br>
the number of packets not yet transmitted is larger than a<br>
predetermined threshold of the average difference in the number<br>
of such packets. Note that as long as a difference from an average<br>
number of packets not yet transmitted that was calculated in any<br>
of previous fluctuation analysing cycles is calculated, the<br>
difference is not restricted to the difference from the average<br>
number of packets not yet transmitted that was calculated in the<br>
immediately previous fluctuation analyzing cycle.<br>
If the average difference in the number of packets not yet<br>
transmitted is not larger than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the number of such packets, the access control unit 101<br>
goes to the operation in step S106. If the average difference<br>
in the number of packets not yet transmitted is larger than the<br>
threshold of the difference value in the number of such packets,<br>
the access control unit 103 goes to an operation in step S105.<br>
In step S105, the access control unit 101 determines that<br>
the communication-medium characteristic detecting scheme is to<br>
be performed, transmits an evaluation-series packet to the<br>
communication terminal at the receiving side, and then, based on<br>
an evaluation-result packet: returned in response, resets the<br>
communication parameter. After the operation in step S105. the<br>
access control unit 101 goes to the operation in step S106. Note<br>
that, once the communicaticn-medium-characteristic detecting<br><br>
scheme is performed, the fluctuation analyzing cycle may be<br>
restarted after the completion of the scheme, or the fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle may arrive without changing its cycle.<br>
In step S106, the access control unit 101 restores a minimum<br>
value among the previous ratios of occurrence of retransmission<br>
in the transmission buffer 102 as a minimum ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission.<br>
The operations in steps S100 through S106 are performed from<br>
the start of the fluctuation analyzing cycle and the end thereof.<br>
After the operations in steps S100 through S106 are completed,<br>
the access control unit 101 waits until the time of starting the<br>
next fluctuation analyzing cycle arrives to start the operation<br>
shown in FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 3 is a sequence diagram for describing an example of<br>
timings of performing the communication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme when the state of the communication medium is<br>
changed from a deteriorated state to an improved state.<br>
Hereinafter, with reference to FIG. 3, description is made to the<br>
example of timings of performing the<br>
communication-medium-characterlstic detecting scheme when the<br>
state of the communication medium is changed from a deteriorated<br>
state to an improved state.<br>
Firstly, it is assumed that, when a time T300 for starting<br>
a fluctuation analyzing cycle arrives, a transmission terminal<br>
(whichhereinaf ter means a commanication terminal at a transmitting<br><br>
side) has already transmitted a plurality of packets as a date<br>
sequence 301 to a reception terminal (which hereinafter means a<br>
communication terminal at a receiving side). At the time of<br>
transmitting the packets, the access control unit 101 causes the<br>
number of transmission packets and the number of packet<br>
retransmissions to be stored in the transmission buffer 102. When<br>
the time T300 arrives, the transmission terminal calculates a ratio<br>
of occurrence of retransmission and an average number of packets<br>
not yet transmitted as information elements, and then causes the<br>
calculated values to be stored in the transmission buffer 102 (refer<br>
to step S100 in FIG. 2).<br>
Here, between the time T300 and a time T302 for starting<br>
the next fluctuation analyzing cycle, it is assumed that no large<br>
fluctuations occur in the state of the communication medium. In<br>
this case, a ratio of packet,losses in the data sequence 301 is<br>
not significantly fluctuated. When the time T302 arrives, the<br>
transmission terminal calculates a ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission and an average number of packets not yet transmitted,<br>
and then causes the calculated values to be stored in the<br>
transmission buffer 102 (refer to step S100 in FIG. 2). With the<br>
ratio of packet losses being not significantly fluctuated, the<br>
difference value in ratio of occurrence of retransmission is<br>
smaller than the threshold of the difference value in ratio of<br>
occurrence of retransmission (refer to a flow to YES in step S102<br>
of FIG. 2). At this time, if the transmission-speed setting value<br><br>
Is equal to or larger than the threshold of the transmission-speed<br>
setting value (refer to a flow to NO in step S103 of FIG. 2), the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is not<br>
performed after the time T300. This is to prevent an unnecessary<br>
execution of the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme under circumstances where a certain speed and a certain<br>
success rate are guaranteed. Then, the access control unit 101<br>
updates the minimum ratio of occurrence of retransmission (refer<br>
to step S106 in FIG. 2).<br>
Next, it is assumed that the state of the communication medium<br>
is greatly improved after the time T302. In this case, a ratio<br>
of packet losses from the transmission terminal to the reception<br>
terminal is decreased (refer to a data sequence 303 in FIG. 3).<br>
Therefore, after the difference value in the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission calculated by the access control unit 101 in<br>
step S102 after a time T304 for starting the fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle is increased to be equal to or larger than the threshold<br>
of the ratio of occurren6e of retransmission. If the difference<br>
value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission is equal to<br>
or larger than the threshold of the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission, the access control unit 101 performs the process<br>
of step S106.<br>
Therefore, the transmission terminal transmits an<br>
evaluation-series packet 305 to the reception terminal. In<br>
response, the reception terminal detects a communication-medium<br><br>
characteristic for each sub-carrier, and then returns an<br>
evaluation-result packet 306 containing the detection results to<br>
the transmission terminal. Upon reception of the<br>
evaluation-result packet 306, the transmission terminal resets<br>
the communication parameter based on the evaluation results, and<br>
then restarts data transmission.<br>
Conventionally, the communication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme is performed only when the number of<br>
retransmissions excess a threshold. In the present invention,<br>
it is determined whether the state of the communication medium<br>
is changed from a deteriorated state to an improved state by<br>
determining whether the difference value in the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission is equal to or larger than the threshold of the<br>
difference value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission,<br>
thereby automatically performing the<br>
communication-medium-Characteristic detecting scheme.<br>
Therefore, the communication parameter can be determined so as<br>
to follow the changes in the communication-medium characteristic.<br>
FIG. 4 is a sequential diagram for describing another example<br>
of the timings of performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme when the<br>
state of the communication medium is changed from a deteriorated<br>
state to an Improved state. Hereinafter, with reference to FIG.<br>
4, description is made to the other example of timings of performing<br>
the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme when<br><br>
the state of the communication medium is changed from a deteriorated<br>
state to an improved state.<br>
In FIG. 4, firstly, in a deteriorated state of the<br>
communication medium, it is assumed that the state of the<br>
communication medium is not significantly fluctuated after the<br>
communication parameter is net. In this case, the state of a load<br>
on the communication medium is not changed, and therefore the<br>
numbers of packets not yet transmitted in transmission queues 401<br>
and 403 are not significantly changed. Therefore, a difference<br>
between an average number of packets not yet transmitted at a time<br>
T400 for starting a fluctuation analyzing cycle and an average<br>
number of packets not yet transmitted at a time T402 for starting<br>
another fluctuation analyzing cycle is smaller than the threshold<br>
of the number of packets not: yet transmitted. Therefore, in the<br>
fluctuation analyzing, cycle, starting at the time T402, the<br>
communication-mediim-character is tic detecting scheme is not<br>
performed (refer to a flow to NO in step S104 of FIG. 2).<br>
Then, it is assumed that, after a while, the state of the<br>
communication medium is gradually improved from a deteriorated<br>
state. In this case, although the communication parameter is set<br>
so that the communication rate is low, packet losses are decreased<br>
due to the improvement of the state of the communication medium.<br>
Therefore, packets become easy to pass and, as shown in transmission<br>
queues 405 and 407, the number of packets not yet transmitted is<br>
decreased. In such a case, at: a time T406 for starting a fluctuation<br><br>
analyzing cycle, the number of packets not yet transmitted in the<br>
transmission queue 407 is decreased compared with the number of<br>
packets not yet transmitted in the transmission queue 405 at the<br>
time T404 for starting the previous fluctuation analyzing cycle.<br>
Therefore, the difference from the average number of packets not<br>
yet transmitted can be larger than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the number of such packets. Also, since the state of<br>
the communication medium is originally assumed to be deteriorated,<br>
the transmission-speed setting value is smaller than the threshold<br>
of the transmission-speed setting value. For this reason, the<br>
operation goes to a flow tc YES in step S103 and then YES in step<br>
S104 of FIG. 2, and thus the communication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme is performed. Therefore, the transmission<br>
terminal transmits an evaluation- series packet 408 for detecting<br>
a communication-medium characteristic to the reception terminal.<br>
Using the evaluation-series packet 408, the reception terminal<br>
detects a communication-medium characteristic, and then notifies<br>
the transmission terminal of the detection results as an<br>
evaluation-result packet 409. Upon reception of the<br>
evaluation-result packet 409, the transmission terminal resets<br>
the communication parameter based on the evaluation results, and<br>
then restarts data transmission. With this, even when the state<br>
of the communication medium is changed from a deteriorated state<br>
to an improved state, the transmission terminal can automatically<br>
perform a communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme.<br><br>
thereby determining the communication parameter so as to follow<br>
the changes of the communication-medium characteristic.<br>
Even after the communication parameter is updated, the state<br>
of the communication medium is continuously fluctuated.<br>
Therefore, in -synchronization with the fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycles, the operation of FIG. 2 is performed. Even when the state<br>
of the communication medium is significantly deteriorated, the<br>
ratio of occurrence of retransmission is significantly fluctuated<br>
similarly with the case where the state of the communication medium<br>
is improved. Thus, the difference value in the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission is larger than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission, and therefore<br>
the operation goes to a flow to NO in step S102 of PIG. 2, thereby<br>
performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme.	<br>
FIG. 5 is a graph showing a relation between the state of<br>
the communication medium and a communication rate when the<br>
communication terminals according to the first embodiment are used.<br>
i<br>
Hereinafter, with referelnoe to FIG. 5, description is made to the<br>
relation between the state of the communication medium and the<br>
communication rate when the communication terminals according to<br>
the first embodiment are used.<br>
In FIG. 5, the vertical axis indicates values of the state<br>
of the communication medium or values of the communication rate.<br>
The value which is more positive on the vertical axis indicates<br><br>
a more satisfactory state of the communication medium and a higher<br>
transmission-speed setting value. A bold solid line indicates<br>
changes in the state of the communication medium. A bold dotted<br>
line indicates changes in the communication rate. A thin dotted<br>
line indicates-the threshold of the transmission-speed setting<br>
value. The horizontal axis indicates time. Times for starting<br>
a fluctuation analyzing cycle are represented by times SI through<br>
S10. In FIG. 5. sections denoted as CB1 through CE5 indicate period<br>
during which the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme is performed.<br>
In FIG. 5, when the basic cycle of the<br>
communication-medium- characteristic detecting scheme starts, the<br>
communication-medium- characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
performed in the section CE1. With this, the communication<br>
parameter is set. In FIG, 5,the communication rate derived from<br><br>
the set communication parameter is initially assumed to be larger<br>
than the threshold of the transmission-speed setting value.<br>
Therefore, the procedure goes to a flow to NO in step S103 of FIG.<br>
2, thereby not performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme.<br>
FIG. 5 shows that the state of the communication medium<br>
becomes suddenly deteriorated around the time S3. In such a case,<br>
a difference between the ratio of occurrence of retransmission<br>
and the minimum ratio of occurrence of retransmission at the time<br>
S3 is large. Here, it is assumed that the difference value in<br><br>
the ratio of occurrence of retransmission becomes larger than the<br>
threshold of the difference value in the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission. In this case, the procedure goes to a flow to<br>
NO in step S102 of FIG. 2. Therefore, the<br>
communication-medium-chariicteristlc detecting scheme is<br>
performed in the section CE2 (step S105). With this, it is detected<br>
that the state of the communication medium is changed from a<br>
satisfactory state to a deteriorated state, and, based on the state<br>
of the communication medium at the start of the section CE2 (at<br>
the time of transmitting an evaluation-series packet), the<br>
communication parameter is set. With this, the communication<br>
parameter is set so as to ifollow the deteriorated state of the<br>
communication medium.<br>
From the time S4 to the time S5. the state of the communication<br>
medium is kept in a low state. Therefore; packets stored around<br>
the time T3 and yet not transmitted are not decreased. Thus, the<br>
procedure goes to a flow to NO in step S104 of FIG. 2, thereby<br>
not performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme.	<br>
Thereafter, around the time S6, the state of the<br>
communication medium demonstrates a tendency for improvement. In<br>
such a case, even if the communication rate is set low, packet<br>
losses due to influences of noise on the communication medium tend<br>
to be decreased. Therefore, the storedpackets not yet transmitted<br>
starts decreasing. Therefore, the procedure goes to a flow to<br><br>
YES in step S104 of the operation shown in FIG. 2 and performed<br>
at the time T6 for starting sampling. With this, in the section<br>
CE3, the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
performed, the communication parameter is updated, and the<br>
communication rate is increased. An example of such a flow of<br>
the procedure is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
If the state of the communication medium demonstrates a<br>
tendency for improvement around the time S6, for example, the<br>
difference value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission may<br>
become larger than the threshold of the difference value in the<br>
ratio of occurrence of retrainsmisslon. With this, the procedure<br>
may go to a flow to NO in step S102, thereby performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme. A<br>
typical case in which the procedure goes to a flow to NO in step<br>
S102 is the case where the state of the communication medium is<br>
suddenly improved. An example of such a flow of the procedure<br>
is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Also at the time S7, the state of the communication medium<br>
demonstrates a tendency for improvement. Therefore, the<br>
procedure goes to a flow to YES in step S104 or a flow to NO in<br>
step S102, thereby performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme in the<br>
section CE4, updating the communication parameter, and Increasing<br>
the communication rate.<br>
Then, at the time S8 and thereafter, the state of the<br><br>
detected. Therefore, in the communication terminal according to<br>
the first embodiment, even If the state of the communication medium<br>
is changed from a deteriorated state to an improved state, the<br>
communication parameter can be made so as to suitably follow the<br>
state of the communication medium. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
provide a communication terminal allowing an improvement in<br>
throughput in the entire communication system and a reduction in<br>
time taken from the time when the state of the communication medium<br>
is fluctuated to the time when the communication parameter is<br>
changed.<br>
Here, in the first embodiment, the information element, such<br>
as the ratio of occurrence of retransmission or the number of packets<br>
not yet transmitted, is calculated at the start of the fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle (refer to step S100 in FIG. 2). Alternatively,<br>
such calculation is perfornned, in a step of comparing a difference<br>
value with a threshold(step S102 or S104 in FIG. 2). Also, the<br>
access control unit 101 may calculate each of the information<br>
elements (the ratio of occurrence of retransmission and the number<br>
of packets not yet transmitted) whenever it obtains information<br>
(for example, a total number of packet retransmissions, a total<br>
number of transmission packets, and the number of packets not yet<br>
transmitted) for calculating the information element to store the<br>
calculated element in the transmission buffer 102, and whenever<br>
the operation in step S100, S102. or S104 is performed, may extract<br>
the stored information element.<br><br>
Also, in the first embodiment, in order to calculate a<br>
difference value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission,<br>
an absolute value of a difference between the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission calculated in the current fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle and a minimum ratio of occurrence of retransmission is<br>
calculated. Alternatively, an absolute value of a difference<br>
between the ratio of occurrence of retransmission calculated in<br>
the current fluctuation analyzing cycle and a ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission calculated in the previous fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle may be taken as the difference value in the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission. Also, instead of the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission calculated in the immediately-previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle, a ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission calculated in any one of previous fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycles can be used for ascertaining a fluctuation in<br>
the packet transmission efficiency.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment, the access control<br>
unit 101 compares the difference value in the ratio of occurrence<br>
of retransmission with its threshold (step S102), and then compares<br>
the average difference in the number of packets not yet transmitted<br>
with its threshold (step S104). Alternatively, the access control<br>
unit 101 may compare the aversige difference in the number of packets<br>
not yet transmitted with its threshold, and then may compare the<br>
difference value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission with<br>
its threshold.<br><br>
Still further, the transmission-speed setting value is<br>
compared with its threshold (step S103). Alternatively, this<br>
process may be omitted.<br>
Still further, in the first embodiment, the amount of data<br>
that that can be transmitted per one symbol block is used as the<br>
transmission-speed setting value. Alternatively, the number of<br>
sub-carriers in use may be used as the transmission-speed setting<br>
value.<br>
Still further, the process in step S101 of determining<br>
whether the number of packets is equal to or larger than the minimum<br>
number of packets is not an indispensable process.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
In a second embodiment, the structure of a communication<br>
terminal is similar to that according to the first embodiment.<br>
Therefore, FIG. 1 is also, referred to for description. However,<br>
in the first embodiment, whether to perform the<br>
coramunication-medlum-characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
determined by the communication terminal at the transmitting side.<br>
In the second embodiment, whether to perform the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
determined by the communication terminal at the receiving side,<br>
which requests the communication terminal at the transmitting side<br>
to perform the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme. In the communication terminal at the receiving side<br>
according to the second embodiment, the functions of the access<br><br>
control unit 101 and the modulating/demodulating unit 105 are<br>
different from those according to the first embodiment.<br>
Hereinafter in the second embodiment, unless otherwise mentioned,<br>
the access control unit 101 and the modulating/demodulating unit<br>
105 are assumed- to refer to the access control unit 101' and the<br>
modulating/demodulating unit 105 of the communication terminal<br>
at the receiving side.<br>
The modulating/demodulating unit 105 demodulates a packet<br>
received via the communication medium, and causes the<br>
error-correction performing unit 104 to perform error correction.<br>
At this time, the modulating/demodulating unit 105 causes a bit<br>
length of the received packet (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
received-packet bit length) to be stored in the reception buffer<br>
103. Also, the modulating/demodulating unit 105 obtains the<br>
number of bits requiring error correction(hereinafter referred<br>
to as the number of error-correction bits) from the<br>
error-correction processing unit 105, and then causes the number<br><br>
to be stored in the reception buffer 103. Furthermore, the<br><br>
modulating/demodulating. unit 105 calculates a total<br>
received-packet bit length so far, and then causes the total to<br>
be stored in the reception buffer 103. Based on the state of storage<br>
in the reception queues 103a, the access control unit 101 counts<br>
the number of received packets for each transmission terminal,<br>
and then causes the number to be stored in the reception buffer<br>
103.<br><br>
As with the access control unit 101 in the communication<br>
terminal at the transmitting side, the access control unit 101<br>
retains a timer for counting a fluctuation analyzing cycle.<br>
However, basically, the fluctuation analyzing cycle at the<br>
receiving side- and the fluctuation analyzing cycle' at the<br>
transmitting side are not synchronized with each other.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing an operation of the access<br>
control unit 101 in the communication terminal 100 according to<br>
the second embodiment of the present Invention. Hereinafter, with<br>
reference to FIG. 6, the operation of the access control unit 101<br>
in a fluctuation analyzing cycle is described. Note that packet<br>
reception and demodulation is performed concurrently with the<br>
operation shown in FIG. 6. Therefore, the received-packet bit<br>
length, the total received-packet bit length, the number of<br>
error-correction bits,and the total number of error-correction<br>
bits are stored concurrently with the operation shown in FIG. 6.<br>
The procedure shown in FIG. 6 starts with a notification<br>
from the timer of starting a fluctuation analyzing cycle as a<br>
trigger.	<br>
First, the access control unit 101 performs a process of<br>
extracting and storing an information element (step S200). Here,<br>
the information element is a piece of information reflecting the<br>
state of the communication medium, and can be obtained as a result<br>
of packet transmission. The information element according to the<br>
second embodiment is a piece of information indicative of packet<br><br>
reception quality. In order to reduce a processing load on the<br>
communication terminal, the information element is preferably a<br>
piece of information that can be easily calculated. In the second<br>
embodiment, as the information element, an error correction rate<br>
is used for indicating the packet reception quality. Note that<br>
the information element described herein is merely an example,<br>
and is not meant to be restrictive as long as it is a piece of<br>
information indicative of the packet reception quality.<br>
Specifically, in step S200, the access control unit 101<br>
calculates an error correction rate based on the total<br>
reception-packet bit length and the total number of<br>
error-correction bits at the time of starting a fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle, and then causes the calculated rate to be stored<br>
in the reception buffer 103. For example, the error correction<br>
rate is calculated by (the total number of error-correction<br>
bits)/(total reception-packet bit length).<br>
Next, the access control unit 101 determines whether the<br>
number of received packets in equal to or larger than a predetermined<br>
minimum number of packets (step S201). If the number of received<br>
packets is not equal to or larger than the predetermined minimum<br>
number of packets, the access control unit 101 goes to an operation<br>
in step S204. On the other hand, the number of received packets<br>
is equal to or larger than the predetermined minimum number of<br>
packets, the access control unit 101 goes to an operation in step<br>
S202.<br><br>
In step S202, the access control unit 101 calculates an<br>
absolute value of a difference between the error, correction rate<br>
calculated in the current fluctuation analyzing cycle (first<br>
information element) and a minimum value among previous error<br>
correction rates (second information element: hereinafter<br>
referred to as a minimum error correction rate) as a difference<br>
value in the error correction rate to determine whether the<br>
difference value in the error correction rate is equal to or larger<br>
than a predetermined threshold of the difference value in the error<br>
correction rate. Here, the minimum error correction rate is not<br>
set in the first fluctuation analyzing cycle, and therefore is<br>
0. In any of the following fluctuation analyzing cycles, the value<br>
set in step S204, which will be described further below, is used<br>
as the minimum error correction rate.<br>
If the difference value in the error correction rate is not<br>
equal to or larger than a predetermined threshold of the difference<br>
value in the error correction rate, the access control unit 101<br>
goes to an operation in stop S204. On the other hand, if the<br>
difference value in the error correction rate is equal to or larger<br>
than a predetermined threshold of the difference value in the error<br>
correction rate, the access control unit 101 goes to an operation<br>
in step S203.<br>
In step S203, the access control unit 101 determines that<br>
the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is to<br>
be performed, and then transmits an evaluation-series request<br><br>
packet to the communication terminal at the transmitting side.<br>
In response, the communication terminal at the transmitting side<br>
transmits an evaluation-series packet. Then, the communication<br>
terminal at the receiving side transmits an evaluation-result<br>
packet to the communication terminal at the transmitting side.<br>
With this, the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme is performed. After the operation in step S203, the access<br>
control unit 101 goes to the operation in step S204.<br>
In step S204, the access control unit 101 restores a minimum<br>
value among previous error correction rates in the reception buffer<br>
103 as the minimum error correction rate.<br>
The operations in steps S200 through S204 are performed from<br>
the start of the fluctuation analyzing cycle and the end thereof.<br>
After the operations in stops S200 through S204 are completed,<br>
the access control unit.101 waits until the time of starting the<br>
next fluctuation analyzing cycle arrives to start the operation<br>
shown in FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 7 is a sequence diagram for describing an example of<br>
timings of performing the communication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme when the state of the communication medium is<br>
changed from a deteriorated state to an improved state.<br>
Hereinafter, with reference to FIG. 7, description is made to the<br>
example of timings of performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme when the<br>
state of the communication medium is changed from a deteriorated<br><br>
state to an improved state.<br>
Firstly, it is assumed that, when a time T800 for starting<br>
a fluctuation analyzing cycle arrives, the transmission terminal<br>
has already transmitted a plurality of packets as a date sequence<br>
801.<br>
Next, It is assumed that the state of the communication medium<br>
is improved at a time T802 for starting another fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle and thereafter. In this case, the error correction<br>
rate is decreased, and thertifore the difference value in the error<br>
correction rate can be equal to or larger than the threshold of<br>
the difference value in the error correction rate. At a time T804<br>
for starting still another fluctuation analyzing cycle, upon<br>
determination that the difference value in the error correction<br>
rate is equal to or larger than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the error correction rate (refer to a flow to YES in step<br>
S202 of FIG/ 6), the reception terminal transmits an<br>
evaluation-series request packet 805 to the transmission terminal.<br>
In response, the transmission terminal returns an<br>
evaluation-series packet 806 to the reception terminal. Based<br>
on the evaluation-series packet 806, the reception terminal<br>
calculates an index of modulation for each sub-carrier, stores<br>
the calculated indexes in an evaluation-result packet 807, and<br>
then transmits the packet to the transmission terminal. Based<br>
on the evaluation-result packet 807, the transmission terminal<br>
changes the communication parameter. With this, the process of<br><br>
performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme is completed,	After the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
performed, the reception terminal compares the minimum error<br>
correction rate of the data sequence 802 and the minimum error<br>
correction rate, and then updates the minimum error correction<br>
rate to the error rate that is smaller of the above two.<br>
As such, the communication terminal according to the second<br>
embodiment compares the difference in an information element<br>
indicative of the packet reception quality, such as the error<br>
correction rate, with a predetermined threshold value. Therefore,<br>
the communication terminal can detects whether the reception<br>
quality is changed to a predetermined degree or more. In the<br>
communication terminal according to the second embodiment, in<br>
addition to the phenomenon that the communication-medium<br><br>
characteristic is deterrorated, a phenomenon that the<br>
communication-medium characteristic is improved can also be<br>
detected. Therefore, in the communication terminal according to<br>
the second embodiment, even if the state of the communication medium<br>
is changed from a deteriorated state to an improved state, the<br>
communication parameter can be made so as to suitably follow the<br>
state of the communication medium. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
provide a communication terminal allowing an improvement in<br>
throughput in the entire communication system and a reduction in<br>
time taken from the time when the state of the communication medium<br><br>
is fluctuated to the time when the communication parameter is<br>
changed.<br>
Here, in the second embodiment, the information element,<br>
such as the error correction rate, is calculated at the start of<br>
the fluctuation analyzing cycle (refer to step S200 in FIG.- 6) -<br>
Alternatively, such calculation is performed in a step of comparing<br>
a difference value with a threshold (step S202 in FIG. 6).<br>
Also, the access control unit 101 may calculate the error<br>
correction rate whenever it performs an error correcting process<br>
on the received packet. In this case, the calculated error<br>
correction may be stored in the reception buffer 103, and when<br>
the process in FIG. 6 is performed, the access control unit 101<br>
extracts the latest error correction rate stored and the minimum<br>
error correction rate to calculate an absolute value of a difference<br>
therebetween, thereby calculating the difference value in the error<br>
correction rate.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment, in order to calculate<br>
a difference value in error correction rate, an absolute value<br>
t<br>
of a difference between the error correction rate calculated in<br>
the current fluctuation analyzing cycle and a minimum ratio of<br>
occurrence of retransmission is calculated. Alternatively, an<br>
absolute value of a difference between the error correction rate<br>
calculated in the current fluctuation analyzing cycle and an error<br>
correction rate calculated in the previous fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle may be taken as the difference value in the error correction<br><br>
rate. Also, the error correction rate calculated in the previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle is not restricted to an error<br>
correction rate calculated in the immediately-previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle as long as it is an error correction<br>
rate calculated in any one of previous fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycles.<br>
Still further, also in the second embodiment, as shown in<br>
the first embodiment, whether the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme may be<br>
performed at the transmission terminal side for performing the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme as<br>
required.<br>
Still further, in the first and second embodiments, the<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycles are constant, but may be variable.<br>
If the fluctuation analyzing,cycles are constant and a plurality<br>
of terminals are present on the network, there is a high possibility<br>
that times for starting a fluctuation analyzing cycle may be<br>
overlapped each other. Consequently, the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme may<br>
possibly be performed by the plurality of communication terminals<br>
at the same time. Therefore, the fluctuation analyzing cycles<br>
are changed in a random manner or the fluctuation analyzing cycle<br>
for each communication terminal is updated by a specific algorithm,<br>
thereby preventing sucih a possibility that the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is<br><br>
performed by the plurality of communication terminals at the same<br>
time. Also. if the communication parameter is little changed even<br>
with the execution of the coHununication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme, that is, if the communication speed is little<br>
changed, the fluctuation analyzing cycle may be changed to be<br>
extended. With the fluctuation analyzing cycle being extended,<br>
the number of calculation of the information element and the number<br>
of determinations are reduced, thereby decreasing a processing<br>
load on the communication terminal required for calculation and<br>
determination of the information element.<br><br>
Still further, in the first or second embodiment, the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme may be<br>
performed on condition that the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission or the error correction rate is continuously within<br>
a predetermined value range for a predetermined period. In the<br>
case where the state of communication medium is in a satisfactory<br>
state to some extent from the start, the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission or the error correction rate can be approximated<br>
to 0. Therefore, in the first or second embodiment, if the state<br>
is further improved, a difference in the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission or in the error correction rate cannot be used for<br>
estimating the state of the communication medium. In order to<br>
cope with this problem, as an modification of the first or second<br>
embodiment, the coramunicaticn-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme may be performed when the ratio of occurrence of<br><br>
retransmission or the error correction rate is continuously within<br>
a predetermined range for a predetermined period. With this, the<br>
communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is<br>
performed even when the state of the communication medium is in<br>
a satisfactory state to some extent, thereby allowing the<br>
communication parameter to be more suitably set.<br>
Still further, for multi-carrier transmission, timings of<br>
performing the communication-medium-characteristic detecting<br>
scheme may be determined by estimating the state of the<br>
communication medium based on fluctuations of a difference in an<br>
information element, such as an intensity of electric power in<br>
the entire occupied frequency or a level of a received signal for<br>
correcting a preamble.<br>
(Third Embodiment)<br>
In a third embodiment, the structure of a communication<br>
terminal is similar to that according to the first embodiment.<br>
Therefore, FIG. 1 is also referred to.<br>
/	.	■<br>
In a communication system, such as a wireless LAN or a<br>
power-line communication, interference among transmission<br>
packets cannot be detected. Therefore, normally, a reception<br>
terminal returns information indicative of a success or failure<br>
of packet transmission as an ACK packet. With this, interference<br>
among transmission packets is detected.<br>
FIG. 8 is a sequence diagram showing a flow of processing<br>
between a transmission terminal and a reception terminal according<br><br>
to the third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in<br>
FIG. 8, the transmission terminal transmits a data packet 1301<br>
to the reception terminal. Based on the state of reception of<br>
the data packet 1301, the reception terminal obtains characteristic<br>
information, contains the characteristic information in an ACK<br>
packet 1302, and then transmits the ACK packet to the transmission<br>
terminal. The transmission terminal then obtains the<br>
characteristic information from the received ACK packet 1302 to<br>
determine whether to perform the<br>
communication-medium-charaoteristic detecting scheme. Here, as<br>
the characteristic information, the number of error correction<br>
bits indicating a size of the reception packet required for error<br>
correction is used. Also, a CINR (Carrier to Interference and<br>
Noise power Ratio) value is uised, which is obtained by the reception<br>
terminal regarding a part of a transmitted -data packet as an<br>
evaluation series. As such the characteristic Information is<br><br>
information indicative of packet reception quality obtained as<br>
a result of evaluating i:he characteristic of the communication<br>
medium.	<br>
The CINR value has a theoretical correlation with a bit error<br>
rate. Therefore, fluctuations in the state of the communication<br>
medium can be estimated with an increase or decrease in the CINR<br>
value. PIG. 9A is an illustration showing one example of a data<br>
packet format of a data packet partially containing a portion<br>
assumed to be an evaluation se tries. As shown in FIG. 9A, the entire<br><br>
packet header may be taken as an evaluation series. FIG. 9B is<br>
an illustration showing another example of the data packet format<br>
of a data packet partially containing a portion assumed to be an<br>
evaluation series. As shown in FIG. 9B, an evaluation series may<br>
be present between a packet header and data body.<br>
A data pattern of the evaluation series in the third<br>
embodiment is similar to a data pattern contained in the<br>
evaluation-series packet transmitted with each basic cycle, and<br>
can be commonly used between the transmission terminal and the<br>
reception terminal. As with the convention technologies, which<br>
sub-carrier is used is predetermined for each portion of data in<br>
the evaluation series. Therefore, the reception terminal can<br>
evaluate the CINR for each sub-carrier as to the evaluation series<br>
transmitted from the transmission terminal4 The reception<br>
terminal causes a total value of CINRs for the respective<br>
sub-carriers as a CINK value to be contained in an ACK packet for<br>
transmission to the transmission terminal. With this, the<br><br>
transmission terminal can detect the state of the communication<br><br>
medium.	<br>
However, the evaluation series in the third embodiment is<br>
small in size so as not to decrease the throughput compared with<br>
the evaluation series transmitted with each basic cycle. This<br>
is because, the use of an evaluation series of approximately the<br>
same size as that of the evaluation series transmitted with each<br>
basic cycle, the throughput is decreased.<br><br>
If the evaluation series is short, merely an instantaneous<br>
CINR while the state of the communication medium can be obtained<br>
and evaluated. On the other hand, if the evaluation series is<br>
long, CINRs can be obtained over a long period of time, and therefore<br>
an average value of the CINRs for a certain period of time can<br>
be obtained. If the communication-medium characteristic is<br>
locally observed, the CINR cannot be accurately evaluated for a<br>
certain period of time only with evaluation of an instantaneous<br>
CINR because the characteristic is unstably fluctuated.<br>
Therefore, compared with the case where the evaluation series is<br>
long, the accuracy of the CINR is low when the evaluation series<br>
is short. Hereinafter, an evaluation series transmitted with each<br>
basic cycle is referred to as a normal evaluation series, while<br>
an evaluation series having a small size to be contained in a<br>
transmission packet is referred to as a simple evaluation series.<br>
The inventors usfed data of 128 symbols per sub-carrier as<br>
a normal evaluation series, while using data of 4 symbols per<br>
sub-carrier as a simple evaluation series. Therefore, the simple<br>
evaluation series is data having a short length so as to be contained<br>
in a packet header as shown in FIG. 9A, and therefore does not<br>
decrease the throughput. Also, if this data is contained in a<br>
manner as shown in FIG. 9B, this does not lead to a decrease in<br>
throughput.<br>
As will be described further below, according to the third<br>
embodiment, the simple evaluation series contained in a<br><br>
transmission packet is smaller in size than the evaluation series<br>
transmitted with each basic cycle. Therefore, the CINR that can<br>
be obtained by the reception terminal through the simple evaluation<br>
series is low in accuracy. Therefore, such a CINR with low accuracy<br>
is contained in an ACK packet. and is then transmitted to the<br>
transmission terminal. However, the transmission terminal sums<br>
CINRs with low accuracy from ACK packets to obtain an average value<br>
as an information element, and uses a difference in the average<br>
value of CINRs to detect a fluctuation of the communication-medium<br>
characteristic. Therefore, even though the transmission terminal<br>
uses the CINRs with a low accuracy, a fluctuation in<br>
communication-medium characteristic can be detected.<br>
A packet header portion is a portion transmitted at the lowest<br>
communication speed and through the most redundant modulation<br>
scheme so as to be detected by all terminal in the communication<br>
system: Therefore, as shown in PIG. 9A, when the packet header<br>
portion is regarded as the evaluation series, CINR detection can<br>
be achieved with relatively high accuracy. Particularly for DMT,<br>
an average power of sub-carriers in the packet header portion is<br>
constant, and therefore then packet: header is suitable for being<br>
regarded as an evaluation aeries.<br>
Here, the CINR value is characteristic value indicative of<br>
an average value of CINRs for all sub-carriers. In the third<br>
embodiment, as the CINR value, a total number of bits that can<br>
be transmitted per symbol block is used, which is calculated by<br><br>
evaluating a CINR for each sub-carrier. That is, an amount of<br>
data that can be transmitted per symbol block is used.<br>
Also, as the characteristic information, an SINR (Signal<br>
to Interference pulse Noise Ratio) value may be used instead of<br>
the CINR value. Furthermore, as the characteristic information,<br>
a received signal intensity indicative of a reception intensity<br>
of the received packet may be used.<br>
The transmission teirminal receives an ACK packet from the<br>
reception terminal to obtain the embedded characteristic<br>
Information. The access control unit 101 of the transmission<br>
terminal sums the number of error bits and the CINR values, which<br>
are the obtained characteristic information, whenever receiving<br>
an ACK packet. Also, the access control unit 101 sums transmission<br>
data lengths and the number of transmissions. The access control<br>
unit 101 stores a total number of correction bits, a total CINR<br>
value, a total transmission data length, and the number of<br>
transmissions in the transmission buffer 102 in a format in which<br>
they are associated with the transmission queue 102a for each<br><br>
destination.	<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart showing the operation of the access<br>
control unit 101 of the transmission terminal according to the<br>
third embodiment in a fluctuation analyzing cycle. In the third<br>
embodiment, unless otherwise mentioned, the access control unit<br>
101 is assumed to refer to the access control unit 101 in the<br>
transmission terminal. Also, packet reception and demodulation<br><br>
are performed concurrently with the operation shown in PIG. 10.<br>
Therefore, the total number of correction bits, the total CINR<br>
value, the total transmission data length, and the number of<br>
transmissions are stored concurrently with the operation shown<br>
in FIG. 10.<br>
The procedure shown in FIG. 10 starts with a notification<br>
from the second timer of starting a fluctuation analyzing cycle<br>
as a trigger.<br>
First, a process of extracting and storing an information<br>
element is performed (step S300). Here, the access control unit<br>
101 divides the total number of correction bits by the total<br>
transmission data length to calculate an error correction rate.<br>
Also, the access control unit 101 divides the total CINR value<br>
by the number of transmissions to calculate an average value of<br>
the CINR values (hereinafter ,»an average CINR value). Furthermore,<br>
as with the f irs^t embodiment the access control unit 101 calculates<br>
a ratio of occurrence of retransmission. The access control unit<br>
101 takes the error correction rate, the average CINR value, and<br>
the ratio of occurrence of re transmission as information elements.<br>
As such, the information elements are pieces of information<br>
reflecting the state of the communication medium, and can be<br>
obtained as a result of packet transmission. The information<br>
elements according to the third embodiment are pieces of<br>
information indicative of packet: transmission efficiency or<br>
reception quality. In order to reduce a processing load on the<br><br>
communication terminal, the information elements are preferably<br>
pieces of information that can be easily calculated.<br>
As described above, the simple evaluation series is shorter<br>
than the normal evaluation series transmitted with each basic cycle.<br>
Therefore, with one evaluation, only the CINR value with a low<br>
accuracy can be obtained. However, by summing and averaging the<br>
CINR values, a CINR value with a high accuracy can be resultantly<br>
obtained.<br>
Next, the access control unit 101 determines in a manner<br>
similar to that of the first embodiment whether the number of<br>
transmission packets is equal to or larger than a predetermined<br>
minimum number of packets (step S301). If the number of<br>
transmission packets is not equal to or larger than the<br>
predetermined minimum number of packets, the access control unit<br>
101 goes to an operation in step S307. On the other hand, if the<br>
number of transmission packets is equal to or larger than the<br>
predetermined minimum number of packets, the access control unit<br>
101 goes to an operation in step S302. Here, as with the first<br>
embodiment, it is assumed that the access control unit 101 stores,<br>
for each timing of transmitting a packet, the number of packets<br>
In the transmission buffer 102.<br>
In step S302, as with the first embodiment, the access control<br>
unit 101 determines whether the difference value in the ratio of<br>
occurrence of retransmission is smaller than a threshold of the<br>
difference value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission.<br><br>
If the value is not smaller than the threshold of the difference<br>
value in the ratio of occurrence of retransmission, the access<br>
control unit 101 goes to an operation in step S306. IF the value<br>
is smaller than the threshold of the difference value in the ratio<br>
of occurrence of retransmission, the access control unit 101 goes<br>
to an operation in step £303.<br>
In step S303, as with the first embodiment, the access control<br>
unit 101 determines whether the transmission-speed setting value<br>
is smaller than a threshold of the transmission-speed setting value.<br>
If the value is not smaller than the threshold of the<br>
transmission-speed setting value, the access control unit 101 goes<br>
to the operation in step S307. On the other hand, if the value<br>
is smaller than the threshold of the transmission-setting value,<br>
the access control unit 1)1 goes to an operation in step S304.<br>
In step S304, the access control unit 101 calculates an<br>
absolute value of a difference between the error correction rate<br>
calculated in the current: fluctuation analyzing cycle (first<br>
information element) and an error correction rate calculated in<br>
the previous fluctuation analyzing cycle (second information<br>
element) as a difference value in the error correction rate, and<br>
then determines whether the difference value in the error<br>
correction rate is equal to or larger than a threshold of the<br>
difference value in the error correction rate. Note that, as long<br>
as a difference from an error correction rate that was calculated<br>
in any of previous fluctuation analyzing cycles is calculated,<br><br>
the difference is not restricted to the difference from the error<br>
correction rate that was calculated in the immediately-previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle.<br>
If the difference value in the error correction rate is equal<br>
to or larger than the threshold of the difference value in the<br>
error correction rate, the access control unit 101 goes to the<br>
operation in step S306. On the other hand, if the difference value<br>
in the error correction rate is not equal to or larger than the<br>
threshold of the difference value in the error correction rate,<br>
the access control unit 101 goes to an operation in step S305.<br>
In step S305, the access control unit 101 calculates an<br>
absolute value of a difference between an average CINR value<br>
calculated in the current fluctuation analyzing cycle (first<br>
information element) and an average CINR value calculated in the<br>
previous fluctuation analyzing cycle (second information element)<br>
as an average CINR dif ferencer value, and then determines whether<br>
the average CINR difference value is equal to or larger than a<br><br>
threshold of the CINR difference value. Note that, as long as<br>
a difference from an average CINR value calculated in any of previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycles is calculated, the difference is not<br>
restricted to the difference from the average CINR value was<br>
calculated in the immediately-previous fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle.<br>
If the average CINR difference value not is equal to or larger<br>
than the threshold of the CINR difference value, the access control<br><br>
unit 101 goes to the operation in step S307. On the other hand,<br>
if the average CINR difference value is equal to or larger than<br>
the threshold of the CINR difference value, the access control<br>
unit 101 goes to the operation in step S306.<br>
In step S306, the access control unit 101 determines that<br>
the communlcation-medium characteristlc detecting scheme is to<br>
be performed, transmits an evaluation-series packet to the<br>
communication terminal at the receiving side and, based on an<br>
evaluation-result packet returned in response, resets the<br>
communication parameter. Then, the access control unit 101 goes<br>
to the operation in step S307.<br>
In step S307, the access control unit 101 updates a minimum<br>
value of the ratio of occurrence of retransmission.<br>
The operations in step S300 through S307 are performed during<br>
the fluctuation analyzing cycle. Upon completion of the<br>
processing, the access control unit 101 waits until the time of<br>
starting the next fluctuation analyzing cycle arrives to start<br>
the operation shown in FIG. 10.<br>
As such, according to the third embodiment, the transmission<br>
terminal causes a simple evaluation series, which does not lead<br>
to a reduction in throughput, to be contained in a packet for<br>
transmission to the reception terminal. Based on the simple<br>
evaluation series contained in the received packet, the reception<br>
terminal obtains a CINR value as the characteristic information<br>
of the communication medium. Also, the reception terminal obtains<br><br>
the number of error correction bits of the received packet as the<br>
characteristic information of the communication medium. The<br>
reception terminal causes the characteristic information (CINR<br>
value, the number of error correction bits) to be contained in<br>
an ACK packet for transmission to the transmission terminal. Based<br>
on the CINR value and the number of error correction bits, which<br>
is the characteristic information contained in the ACK packet,<br>
the transmission terminal calculates an error correction rate and<br>
an average CINR value, which are information elements. Also, the<br>
transmission terminal calculates a ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission as an information element. The transmission<br>
terminal then compares a difference in each of the information<br>
elements (the error correction rate, the average CINR value, and<br>
the ratio of occurrence of retransmission) with a predetermined<br>
threshold. Therefore the transmission terminal can detect<br>
whether a fluctuation has occurred to a predetermined degree or<br>
more in packet transmission efficiency or reception quality. In<br>
conventional technology, the fact that the number of<br>
retransmissions is increased merely tells a phenomenon that the<br>
communication-medium characteristic is deteriorated. In the<br>
communication terminal according to the third embodiment, in<br>
addition to the phenomenon that the communication-medium<br>
characteristic is deteriorated, a phenomenon that the<br>
communication-medium characteristic is improved can also be<br>
detected. Therefore, in the communication terminal according to<br><br>
the third embodiment, even if the state of the communication medium<br>
is changed from a deteriorated state to an improved state, the<br>
communication parameter can be made so as to suitably follow the<br>
state of the communication medium. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
provide a communication terminal allowing an improvement in<br>
throughput in the entire communication system and a reduction in<br>
time taken from the time when the state of the communication medium<br>
is fluctuated to the time when the communication parameter is<br>
changed.<br>
Also, in the reception terminal, the number of error<br>
correction bits and the CINR are information that is easy to obtain.<br>
Therefore, a processing load on the reception terminal is not<br>
increased. In addition, the characteristic information (the<br>
number or error correction bits and the CINR) is contained in an<br>
ACK packet, which is always required to be transmitted, or a short<br>
evaluation series (simple evaluation series) is contained in a<br>
part of a transmission packet. Therefore, the processing<br>
according to the third embodiment does not increase the throughput.<br>
Furthermore, the throughput is not increased because of the<br>
transmission of the evaluation-series request packet from the<br>
reception terminal.<br>
Furthermore, in the third embodiment, an average CINR value<br>
and an error correction rate calculated based on the CINRs and<br>
the number of error correction bits are used as the information<br>
elements. Therefore, it can be expected that fluctuations in the<br><br>
state of the communication medium is more accurately detected.<br>
Also, it can be expected that the communication parameter can be<br>
caused to follow fluctuations in the state of the communication<br>
medium more accurately.<br>
Still further, in the third embodiment, the access control<br>
unit 101 calculates, as the difference value in the error correction<br>
rate, an absolute value of a difference between the error correction<br>
rate calculated in the current fluctuation analyzing cycle and<br>
the error correction rate calculated in. the previous fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle. Alternatively, an absolute value of a difference<br>
between the error correction rate calculated in the current<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle and a minimum error correction value<br>
until the previous fluctuation analyzing cycle may be calculated<br>
as the difference value in the error correction rate. In this<br>
case, the minimum value is updated in step S307 of FIG. 10.<br>
Still further, in the third embodiment, the access control<br>
unit 101 calculates, as the average CINR difference value, an<br>
absolute value of a difference between the average CINR value<br>
calculated in the current fluctuation analyzing cycle and the<br>
average CINR value calculated in the previous fluctuation analyzing<br>
cycle. Alternatively, an absolute value of a difference between<br>
the average CINR value calculated in the current fluctuation<br>
analyzing cycle and a minimum average CINR value until the previous<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle may be calculated as the average CINR<br>
difference value. In this case, the minimum value is updated in<br><br>
step S307 of FIG. 10.<br>
Still further, the access control unit 101 may calculate<br>
and retain a CINR value at the time of receiving the<br>
evaluation-series packet, and then may calculate an absolute value<br>
of a difference- between the average CINR value calculated in the<br>
current fluctuation analyzing cycle and a CINR value obtained at<br>
the previous time of performing the<br>
communication-medium-characterlstic detecting scheme as the<br>
average CINR difference value. This is because, if the accuracy<br>
of the average CINR value is high, the CINR value obtained through<br>
the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme and the<br>
average CINR value can be compared to detect fluctuations in the<br>
communication-medium characteristic.<br>
Here, whenever storing the information required for<br>
calculating the inf ormatdon elements (the average CINR value, the<br>
error correction rate, and the ratio of occurrence of<br>
retransmission), the access i control unit 101 may calculate the<br>
information elements for storage. In this case, the access control<br>
unit 101 extracts the Stored information elements with each<br>
fluctuation analyzing cycle to determine whether the<br>
communication-medlum-charaoteristic detecting scheme is to be<br>
performed.<br>
Also, when the SINR value and the reception signal intensity<br>
are used as the characteristic information, the access control<br>
unit 101 may extract an average SINR value or an average reception<br><br>
signal intensity, compare its difference with a threshold, and<br>
then determine whether the communication-medium-characteristic<br>
detecting scheme is to be performed.<br>
Still further, the order of steps S301, S302, S303. S304,<br>
and S305 in FIG. 10 may be partially interchanged.<br>
Particularly, either one of steps S304 and S305 may be<br>
performed first of these two.<br>
Still further, step S302 is typically to detect a<br>
deterioration in the state of the communication medium. Therefore,<br>
if detection of improvement In the state of the communication medium,<br>
the operation in step S304 or S305 is performed prior to the operation<br>
in step S302.<br>
Still further, step S303 is to prevent the communication<br>
rate from being fixed to a low rate, and also to suppress the<br>
frequency of unnecessary performance of the<br>
communication-medium characteristic detecting scheme at a high,<br>
to a degree, communication rate. Alternatively, the threshold<br>
of the difference in the1 correction rate and the threshold of the<br>
difference in the CINR value are set to be small, and the operation<br>
in step S303 may be omitted.<br>
Still further, the process in step S301 for determining<br>
whether the number of packets is equal to or larger than the minimum<br>
number of packets,is not necessarily required.<br>
Still further, the threshold of the difference in the error<br>
correction rate may be changed according to the current<br><br>
transmission-speed setting value. The communication parameter<br>
set under the circumstances where the state of the communication<br>
medium is deteriorated is different from the communication<br>
parameter set under the circumstances where the state of the<br>
communication medium is satisfactory in a width of fluctuations<br>
in the error correction rate due to fluctuations in the state of<br>
the communication medium. The communication parameter set under<br>
the circumstances where the state of the communication medium is<br>
deteriorated is always error-resistant, highly-redundant<br>
communication parameter. Therefore, if the communication<br>
parameter has been set under the circumstances where the state<br>
of the communication medium is deteriorated, even if the state<br>
of the communication medium is improved, the difference in<br>
fluctuations in the error correction rate is small compared with<br>
the communication parameter set under the circumstances where the<br><br>
state of the communication. medium is satisfactory. Therefore,<br>
if the transmission-speed setting value is high, the threshold<br>
of the difference in the error correction rate is changed to be<br>
high, and if the transmission-speed setting value is low, the<br>
threshold of the difference in the error correction rate is changed<br>
to be low.<br>
According to the first through third embodiments, even if<br>
the communication-medium-characteristic detecting scheme is not<br>
being performed, the communication parameter can be set with each<br>
basic cycle so as to follow the state of the communication medium.<br><br>
However, in the first through third embodiments, the threshold<br>
of the transmission-speed setting threshold is provided.<br>
Therefore, even if the state of the communication medium is<br>
continuously satisfactory for a long period, it is not possible<br>
to cause the communication parameter to follow that state of the<br>
communication medium. This is a reason for performing the<br>
communicatlon-medium-characterlstic detecting scheme with each<br>
basic cycle.<br>
Note that the above-described embodiments also can be<br>
realized by causing a computer to implement a program which is<br>
able to cause the CPU to implement the above-described process<br>
procedures stored in a storage device (e.g., a ROM, a RAM, a hard<br>
disk, etc.) In such a case, the program may be implemented after<br>
it is stored into the storage device via a recording medium, or<br>
may be implemented diretrtly from the recording medium. The term<br><br>
»	'; -I<br>
"recording medium" as described herein refers to a ROM, a RAM,<br>
a semiconductor memory, such as a flash memory, a magnetic disc<br>
memory, such as a flexible disc, a hard disk, etc., an optical<br>
disc, such as a CD-ROM, a DVD, or a blue-ray disc (BD), etc., or<br>
a memory card. The term "recording medium" as described herein<br>
also refers to a communication medium including a telephone line,<br>
a carrier path, etc.<br>
Note that the access control unit 101 may be realized as<br>
a large-scale integrated (LSI) circuit. This functional blocks<br>
may be implemented as a single chip which includes a part or all<br><br>
of it. The LSI circuit may be selected from the group consisting<br>
of integrated circuits of various degrees of integration, e.g. ,<br>
an IC, a system LSI, a super LSI, an ultra LSI, etc. Further,<br>
a technique used for realizing circuit integration as described<br>
above is not limited to an LSI technique, and the integrated circuit<br>
as described above may be realized using a specialized circuit<br>
or a general-purpose processor. It is also possible to use a field<br>
programmable gate array (1PP6A), which can be programmed after<br>
manufacture, or a reconfigurable processor which is structured<br>
such that connections of circuit cells thereof and its settings<br>
can be reconfigured. Furthermore, in the event of introduction<br>
of anew circuit integration technique, in place of the LSI technique,<br>
due to the advance of semiconductor technology or other relevant<br>
technologies, the above-described functional blocks may be<br>
integrated using such as new technique. It is conceivable that<br>
biotechnology or the like is applied to integration of the<br>
functional blocks.<br>
Described below is an example of applying the above<br>
embodiments to an actual network system. FIG. 11 is an illustration<br>
showing the entire system configuration when the communication<br>
terminal according to the present invention is applied to<br>
high-speed power line transmission. As shown in FIG. 11, the<br>
communication terminal of the present invention is provided as<br>
an interface between a multimedia apparatus, such as a digital<br>
television (DTV), a personal computer (PC), a DVD recorder, etc. ,<br><br>
and a power line. The multimedia apparatus may be connected to<br>
the communication terminal of the present invention via an IEEE<br>
1394 interface, a USB interface, or an Ethernet interface. With<br>
this structure, a communication network system is structured so<br>
as to transmit digital data, such as multimedia data, at high speed<br>
via the power line as a communication medium. Accordingly, unlike<br>
in the case of a conventional wired LAN, it is possible to use<br>
a power line previously installed at home, an office, etc., as<br>
a network line without providing a network cable anew. Therefore,<br>
convenience of such a system is considerably high with respect<br>
to cost and ease of installation.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 11, the communication terminal<br>
of the present invention Is provided as an adaptor for adapting<br>
a signal interface of an existing multimedia apparatus to a power<br>
line communication interface. However, the communication<br><br>
terminal of the present invention may be included in a multimedia<br>
apparatus, such as a personal computer, a DVD recorder, a digital<br>
television, a home server system, etc. This allows data to be<br>
transmitted between multimedia apparatuses via their power cords.<br>
In this case, it is possible to eliminate a wire for connecting<br>
an adaptor to the power lino, and an IEEE-1394 cable or a USB cable,<br>
thereby simplifying system wiring.<br>
Further, in a communication network system using the power<br>
line, connection to the Internet, a wireless LAN, or a conventional<br>
wired LAN can be made via a router and/or a hub, and therefore<br><br>
there is no difficulty in extending a LAN system which employs<br>
the communication network system of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, communication data transmitted through the<br>
power line via power line transmission is not intercepted unless<br>
interception is conducted via direct connection to the power line,<br>
and therefore there is substantially no data leakage by<br>
interception which is a disadvantage of a wireless LAN.<br>
Accordingly, the power line transmission is advantageous from the<br>
viewpoint of security. . It goes without saying that the data<br>
transmitted through the power line can be protected by employing<br>
security architecture for Internet protocol (IPsec), encrypting<br>
content itself, or employing other digital rights management (DRM)<br>
techniques.<br>

19.	A communication apparatus for modulating and demodulating a packet based<br>
on a communication parameter determined according to a communication-<br>
medium characteristic, comprising:<br>
an extracting unit configured to extract, during every occurrence of a<br>
predetermined cycle, an informat on element indicative of packet transmission<br>
efficiency, wherein the extracting unit extracts an average number of packets<br>
not yet transmitted as the information element indicative of the packet<br>
transmission efficiency;<br>
a calculating unit configured to calculate, during every occurrence of<br>
said cycle, a difference between a first information element extracted by<br>
the extracting unit and a second information element previously extracted<br>
by the extracting unit; and<br>
a detecting-scheme performance determining unit configured to<br>
determine whether or not to perform a scheme of detecting the<br>
communication medium characteristic based on the difference between<br>
the first information element and the second information element<br>
calculated by the calculating unit.<br>
20.	A method of determining timings of performing a scheme of detecting a<br>
communication-medium characteristic for determining a communication<br>
parameter for use in modulation and demodulation of a packet, comprising:<br><br>
extracting, during every occurrence of a predetermined cycle, an<br>
information element indicative of packet transmission efficiency, wherein<br>
said extracting extracts an average number of packets not yet transmitted<br>
as the information element indicative of the packet transmission<br>
efficiency;<br>
calculating, during every occurrence of said cycle, a difference<br>
between a first information element extracted in said extracting and a<br>
second information element previously extracted in said extracting; and<br>
determining whether or not to perform a scheme of detecting the<br>
communication medium characteristic based on the difference between<br>
the first information element and the second information element<br>
calculated in said calculating.<br><br>
The present invention is a communication terminal (100) which modulates<br>
and demodulates a packet for transmission and reception based on a<br>
communication parameter for modulation and demodulation determined<br>
according to a communication-medium characteristic. The communication<br>
terminal (100) according to the present invention includes: information-<br>
element extracting means (101) which extracts, with each predetermined<br>
cycle, information indicative of either one of transmission efficiency and<br>
reception quality of the packet, as an information element; difference<br>
calculating means (101) whiqh calculates, with each said cycle, a difference<br>
between a first information element extracted by the information-element<br>
extracting means (101) and a second information element previously<br>
extracted by the information-element extracting means (101); and detecting-<br>
scheme performance determining means (101) which determines, based on<br>
the difference between the first information element and the second<br>
information element calculated bv the difference calculating means (101),<br>
with each said cycle, whether a scheme of detecting the communication-<br>
medium characteristic for changing the communication parameter is to be<br>
performed.</td>
