				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an auto-resetting passenger alarm system for trains, wherein the system is a multi-orifice alarm system with automatic resetting capability after pulling of alarm chain by the passenger in distress.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Alarm chain pulling system (ACP system) is provided in all passenger carrying trains to enable passengers to stop the train in case of emergency on the running train. This equipment is essential safety equipment for trains. There is a chain for actuation which is pulled by passengers through handles suspended inside coaches. The chain pull actuates a micro valve which actuates another valve to cause leakage of brake pipe air pressure through a choke of predetermined size, normally of 3mm diameter. This controlled leakage is detected by devices installed in the Locomotives and braking is actuated at the discretion of the driver.<br>
There is a flag on the coach which normally remains in the horizontal position and becomes vertical on actuation of ACP leakage by chain. This increases its visibility and helps in detection of affected coach by the railway crew.<br>
A limitation of the existing passenger alarm (ACP) system provided on trains in India is that the passengers who are in distress in a coach, do not get any visible or audible feedback indication on pulling the emergency chain in the coach. The passengers in the affected coach are therefore, not certain whether there is distress call has received attention of the train driver which increases panic amongst passengers till the train actually comes to a halt.<br>
Another limitation of the existing ACP system is that the system is not capable of stopping the train independently. The system works in conjunction with additional equipment placed in the locomotives and action by the driver. This causes considerably delay in stopping the train and time is a critical factor for passengers safely in emergencies.<br>
Still another drawback of the existing ACP system is that the system requires to be reset manually by train from the end of affected coach, before restarting the train and causes additional delays and difficulties to the locomotive crew.<br>
Further drawback of the above system is that system become completely non-functional on being intentionally blanked off when the train is passing through areas with law and order problems where miscreants often unauthorisedly stop the train using the ACP system.<br>
Still further drawback of the above system is that indication of flag to mark the affected coach is not discrete as the marker flag always remains in view partly.<br>
Yet further drawback of the above system is that these are chances of train, parting and coupler failures under limiting conditions when the system is used with chokes of more than 7 min which is necessary for complete braking of the train.<br>
Still further drawback of the above system is that it has a single orifice for leakage due to which breaking is initiated in affected coach immediately, in a single stop which causes higher coupler forces under limiting conditions.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an improved passenger alarm system for trains.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved alarm system which has auto-resetting capability after preset time delay by which the flag showing emergency in an affected compartment, automatically retracts back to its housing compartment and initiated in such a coach also stops.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide improved alarm system which is a multi-orifice system which has the advantage that the first orifice of 3mm initiates a low level leakage immediately after first<br>
pull whereas after 20 to 25 seconds, the other orifice of 8mm enhances leakage to bring train quickly to a half.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an alarm system which has a horn of at least 120 db which blows whenever any passenger pulls the chain which gives feedback and implicit assurance to the passenger in distress that his distress call is getting communicated to guard/driver of the train so that passenger will not feel it necessary to pull the alarm chain again. The sound of horn is loud enough to attract the other railway employees and other passengers of the train or any other train near it. The horn sound stops automatically when the alarm chain is released by the passenger in distress.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an alarm system which has a distinctly visible flag which is painted with fluorescent paint to make its detection easy thereby enabling faster identification of the affected compartment, particularly at night; thereby saving time to provide help to passenger in distress.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an alarm system wherein, even if the system is blanked by driver by setting the resetting delay at below 10 seconds, the horn and low level leakage indication to driver still remains available. Though train braking in such cases is not initiated by the system but the driver does get an indication and may stop the train at his discretion, considering the situation. Thus it provides safety to passenger even after blanking when train is passing through an area infested with anti-social elements.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an alarm system which does not require any system on the locomotive or any action by the driver to initiate two stage braking of the present system. The system of the present invention is completely stand alone system located on the coach.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated with accompanying drawings which are illustrative embodiment of the invention and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention. In the accompanying figures:-<br>
Fig 1: shows the layout of overall assembly of passengw-alarm system of<br>
present invention.<br>
Fig 2: shows the main sub-assembles of passenger alarm system. Fig 3: shows the inter connection of sub-assembles of passenger alarm<br>
system.<br>
Referring to fig 2, the housing (44) comprises three directional control valves (26,31,35), a timer valve (32), actuation rod assembly (61), flag compartment (49) and air reservoir (34) of minimum capacity lOOOcc with opening for piston rod (29). The valve (35) is operated by cam (38) which is mounted on actuation shaft (41). When any passenger pulls the alarm chain in any compartment of train, the chain pulls the lever (40) on actuation rod (41). Lever (40) rotates the actuation rod (41) which rotates the cam (38) to actuation position. It also winds the spring (39) which brings rod (41) back to original position as soon as the alarm chain is released by the passenger. In actuation position, cam (38) presses the roller actuation of valve (35), thereby shifting it to actuation position.<br>
Referring to figure 3, the system comprises, besides three direction control valves (35, 31,26) and a timer valve (32), a flow control valve (45), a double acting cylinder (28) with a flag (30) attached to the end of piston rod (29). There are two chokes (42, 43) with orifice of 3mm and 8mm respectively. The direction control valve (35) is a roller operated 3/2 spring return valve which is connected at one end at port (2) of valve (26)<br>
to incoming air pipe (48) at point (25). Incoming air pipe brake pipe (3) is connected to brake pipe (37) through cut-out cock (36). The valve is connected at the other end port (15) to said horn (27) and at port (5) of valve (31). The valve (35) is operated by cam (38) which is mounted on actuation shaft (41) which rotates the shaft. The rotation of shaft results in rotation of cam (38) mounted on the shaft and brings it to actuation position. The cam (38) presses the roller actuator of valve (35). The valve (31) is a double pilot 5/2 valve which is connective at one end to valve at pilot port and at other end at pilot port (10) to the timer valve (32) at its port (17). Valve (31) is connected at port (8) and (9) to port (11) and (12) of the double acting cylinder (28). This connection is interchanged i.e. port (8) of valve (31) to port (12) of cylinder (28) and port (9) of valve (31) to port (11) of cylinder (28) when pilot pressure is applied to port (5) of valve (31). Valve (31) is connected to incoming air pipe through port (6) at point (23) on the incoming pipe. Port (7) of valve (31) is exhaust.<br>
The double acting cylinder (28) is connected to valve (31) as explained above and its piston rod (29) extends out when air pressure is applied at<br>
its port (11) through valve (31). The piston rod retracts when air pressure is withdrawn from port (11) and applied to port (12) through valve (31). Flag (30) is connected to the end of piston rod (29). Its rests inside the compartment (49) of the box (44). It comes out and becomes fully visible when the piston rod (29) extends out.<br>
Valve (32) is a timer valve with flow control knob (33). It is connected to port (8) of valve (31) at pilot port (10). It is connected to point (22) of incoming air pipe at port (20). On the out going side, it is connected to pilot port (10) of valve (31) at port (17) and to port (46), flow control valve (45) and also to inlet (21) of reservoir (34) at port (19). Port (18) of valve (32) is exliaust. Flow control valve (45) is connected on the other side at port (47) to pilot port (1) of valve (26).<br>
Valve (26) is a 3/2 pitet operated spring return valve which is connected on one side to point (25) of incoming air pipe at port (2) and on the other side to choke (43) at port (4). The pilot port (1) is connected to port (47) of flow control valve (45).<br>
The reservoir (34) has only one inlet cum outlet port (21) connected to port (19) of the valve (32).<br>
METHOD OF WORKING<br>
1.       Actuation sequence:<br>
The system is actuated when any passenger pulls the alarm chain in emergency. Sequence of operation which follows is given below:<br>
i. Chain pulls the lever (40) on actuation rod assembly (41) in the housing.<br>
ii. Lever (40) rotates and the rod (41) also rotates with it which rotates cam (38) to actuation position. It also winds the spring (39) which brings rod (41) back to original position as soon as the alarm chain is released by the passenger.<br>
iii. In actuation position, cam (38) presses the roller actuator of valve (35). This shifts the valve (35) to actuation position and air pressure from point (25) on incoming air pipe goes through port (12) of valve (35) to port (15) which is connected to valve (31) at port (5). This shifts the valve (31) to actuation position. Also, air<br>
from port (15) of valve (35) goes to horn (27) which blows with 120 db intensity. This sound assures to the passengers in distress that the system is responding. The horn sound stops whenever the alarm chain is released as the actuation shaft (41) returns to initial position due to return spring (39) which causes spring return valve (35) to come back to normal position. This sound is loud enough to be heard by guard/driver of the train. Other railway employees on other trains and at stations. Also attention of other passenger on the train also gets attracted. This works as additional channel of emergency communication between train crew and passenger, iv. Valve (31) on being actuated by pilot pressure at port (5), supplies pressurized air from its incoming pressure port (6) to out going port (8) which supplies pressure to port (11) of the cylinder (28) and causes extension of piston rod (29). This brings flag (30) outside its chamber (49) and makes its visible outside to make it easy to identify the affected coach. This flag is painted with fluorescent paint to make its detection easy at night.<br>
v. Also, air from port (8) of valve (31) goes to choke (42) which starts a leakage through its 3mm port. This sends a signal of leakage to train engine which can be detected by equipment placed on locomotive to draw attention of driver and cut off power of the locomotive.<br>
vi. Air from port (8) of valve (31) also goes to pilot port (10) of timer valve (32) to initiate the tinier sequence. The timer valve (32) starts counting of time from the first pull of chain. It fills the reservoir (34) at controlled rate. Air pressure also goes to pilot port (1) of valve (26) through flow control valve (45). The rate of rise of pressure at port (1) of valve (26) can be controlled by adjusting the flow control valve (45). Also, rate of filing of reservoir (34) can be controlled by adjusting flow control knob (33) provided in the timer valve (32).<br>
vii. Valve (45) is so adjusted as to achieve operation time delay of 20 to 45 seconds for valve (26). This is the time taken for pilot pressure to rise at port (1) of valve (26). Exact delay is adjusted to suit locomotive systems response. Thus, valve (26) operates after preset delay after initial chain pull. Operation of the valve (26) creates a<br>
leakage through a larger choke (43). As the time delay is matched with locomotive systems response time, this second stage large leakage is initiated to cause full braking from coach. At the same time, locomotive systems are able to cut power to avoid excess pull on the inter coach coupling.<br>
viii. Leakage of brake pipe (37) pressure through choke (43) brings the train to a complete halt automatically and quickly without waiting for the driver to apply the brakes from the locomotive.<br>
ix. During this time, the reservoir (34) connected to valve (32) continues to get filled at controlled rate depending upon adjustment of knob (33).<br>
Detection of distress Coach by Train Crew:<br>
i. The flag (30) remains extended on the distress coach after chain pull due to extensions of cylinder rod (29). The flag is painted with fluorescent paint to improve visibility at night.<br>
ii. Crew can approach the distressed coach and attend to the affected passenger.<br>
Automatic resetting of the system:<br>
i. After reservoir (34) is filled to required pressure, the timer valve (32) actuates and supplies air pressure to its port (17) which goes to pilot port (10) of valve (31) and puts it back to initial state, its port (9) is connected to air pressure. This leads to application of air pressure to connected port (12) of double acting cylinder (28). At the same time, port (8) of valve (31) is connected to exhaust which removes air pressure from port (11) of cylinder (28). This leads to retraction of piston rod (29) and flag (30). This automatic retraction occurs after time delay which can be set at 1 to 30 minutes using flow control knob (33). A suitable timing may be selected to permit driver and guard of train to come and detect the affected coach.<br>
ii. Operation of valve (31) to initial position also causes leakage through choke (42) to stop as port (8) of valve (31) is now connected to exhaust.<br>
iii. Also, pilot pressure at port (10) of timer valve (32) is withdrawn as connected port (8) of valve (31) is connected to exhaust, the timer valve (32) resets and connects to port (19) to exhaust. This causes emptying of reservoir (34) and also withdraws pressure from port of valve (26). This leads to return of valve (26) to normal position and its port (4) gets connected to exhaust thereby stopping leakage rom choke (43).<br>
iv. Thus, after preset delay, the system automatically resets to original position i.e. leakage of choke (42) and (43) stops, flag (30) retracts and the reservoir (34) empties which makes and system ready for re-operation. Also as all leakage have disappeared, the driver can recharge the brake system on reaching locomotive and start the train. The crew does not have to reset the alarm system. This operation is fully automatic.<br>
