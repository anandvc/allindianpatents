				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to an on-board processing unit for a global positioning<br>
system (GPS) based truck dispatch system (TDS) for tracking on-line movement of vehicles<br>
like earth moving equipment inside opencast coal mines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Opencast mining starts with the drilling of large diameter (150 mm) blast holes into the<br>
overburden rocks. Blasting is done with the help of site-mixed slurry explosives for proper<br>
fragmentation of the overburden. The fragmented material is loaded on rear dumpers with<br>
the help of hydraulic / electrical excavators and is clumped in already mined-out areas.<br>
Later, trees are planted on these dump yards. Coal, which is exposed after removal of<br>
overburden, is also drilled and blasted. Blasted coal is loaded by front-end loaders onto<br>
bottom-dump coal haulers for transportation from the face to the crushing plants. Since<br>
coal, as present naturally in different seams, has widely varying properties, they are mined<br>
separately in pre-determined proportions to optimize the yield and quality of clean coal.<br>
In the process of coal mining, two main sub processes viz. removal of over burden and<br>
retrieval of coal are predominant. But most of the effort goes in the removal of over<br>
burden and this has a dominant influence on the productivity. In the process of over<br>
burden removal, two of the equipment viz. rear dumper and excavator play a leading role.<br>
After the schedule of blasting in an specific zone of the mine has been prepared, the<br>
excavator loads the over burden into rear dumpers and each rear dumpers goes practically<br>
through four different machine states i.e. waiting (near loading zone), loading full and<br>
empty (at dumping zone). This sequence of machine states of a rear dumpers constitutes<br>
one trip. Now it may be understood that to monitor the productivity automatically, one has<br>
to monitor the movement of rear dumpers around the corresponding excavator i.e. loading<br>
zone to dumping zone and back to loading zone.<br>
In order to expedite the over burden removal process, real time locations of<br>
mining equipment (especially dumper and excavator) and their status are<br>
required as input to the central base station software so that optimum<br>
schedules can be generated to achieve minimum possible idle time for each<br>
of these mining equipment. Global positioning system technology is<br>
considered to be one of the best technique to obtain such real time locations<br>
of moving mine equipment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Te main object of the present invention is to provide on-line tracking of<br>
mobile equipment like earth moving equipment inside mines using global<br>
positioning system (GPS), especially designed for harsh environment (IP66)<br>
and suitable for mounting on mobile equipment.<br>
This object is achieved in the present invention by providing an on-board<br>
processing unit comprising a single board embedded controller card. Using<br>
GPS technique locations of moving mine equipment and status / production<br>
related information can be captured through on-board sensors and machine<br>
electronics interface. To collect these dynamic information, high-end single<br>
board micro-controller card with multi serial ports and multi digital and<br>
analog input / output port was required to develop application software.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an on-board processing unit for a GPS<br>
based truck dispatch system, said on-board processing unit comprising a<br>
single board embedded controller card housed in an enclosure capable of<br>
withstanding harsh environmental conditions, a DC/DC converter for<br>
deriving power from the battery of vehicles, movement of which is being<br>
tracked; a radio unit for RF data communication with a base unit ; a GPS<br>
module for capturing real time geo-coordinates through a receiver ; a built-in<br>
fast frequency shift keying (FFSK) interface coupled to said radio unit for<br>
RF communication ; a built-in device driver for capturing payload data from<br>
payload monitoring system of said vehicle ; and a graphical touch screen<br>
(GTS) port as a simple RS 232 C 3 wire interface for tracking on-line<br>
movement of vehicles.<br>

accompanying drawing in which<br>
Figure 1 shows a system block diagram for the on-board processing<br>
unit of the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The on-board processing unit of the present Invention as shown in Figure 1, comprises a<br>
single board embedded controller card 3. The controller card 3 is housed in an enclosure.<br>
The enclosure should be capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions like the<br>
one available in an opencast mines. The enclosure is of IP 66 grade with mil grade<br>
connectors to field connections.<br>
The unit comprises a DC / DC converter power supply unit 1 for deriving 9 - 12 V DC<br>
power from the 24 V battery of the vehicle. A radio unit 2 is provided like a Motorolla radio<br>
unit for R.F communication: The unit is further provided with a GPS module 4=<br>
The hardware items used in the on-board processing unit of the present invention,<br>
described later in detail, are used for capturing real time geo-coordinates through GPS<br>
receiver. The radio modem provides RF data communication. Device drivers are provided<br>
for graphical touch screen (GTS) display, capturing real time engine parameters and<br>
payload parameters and customized data acquisition system. These can be integrated to<br>
provide remote vehicle tracking and status information.<br>
The following description will serve as a hardware reference document for the on-board<br>
processing unit board. Hardware configuration and interface connector details are<br>
provided in this section. All devices use 8-bit interface only. Please note that information<br>
provided herein pertains only to the on-board processing unit board and not for the entire<br>
enclosure.<br>
Power supply<br>
The board works off 9V - 12V DC power supply. The board will require a maximum of 200<br>
mA continuous current with no loads connected to the outputs. The supply is internally<br>
regulated to provide 5V supply to the board.<br>
Overview<br>
The basic board is built around the 80C188XL processor, which offers an 8-bit bus, and<br>
1MB of address space. Of the 8 serial ports provided 2 are used internally on board, one<br>
for fast frequency shift keying interface to the radio device, and one for the global<br>
processing system device. All other serial ports are brought outside the enclosure.<br>
None of the features provided offer hardware configuration except the fast frequency shift-<br>
keying interface..<br>
All external connections are brought out on two layered screw terminals. The signal names<br>
are printed on the PCB. All the terminals are numbers - the numbering is row wise and the<br>
top (higher) terminals are numbered first.<br>
System Memory Map<br>
The 80188 processor can address a maximum of 1MB of memory. Of these 512K is<br>
provided for RAM and 512K for system flash. This flash is in turn divided into the file<br>
system area and program flash area. All the other peripherals are 10 mapped onto the<br>
processor.<br>
Serial Ports<br>
8 serials ports are realized with 2 Quad UART devices. These 10 map and connections of<br>
these serial ports are given in the following Table:<br>
Table 1 shows the details of I/O map for serial ports<br>
The host port is primarily used for program maintenance and trouble shooting while<br>
operation and for debugging while program development.<br>
FFSK Pert<br>
The fast frequency shift keying port is internally connected to the fast frequency shift<br>
keying portion of the board. The asynchronous serial data is first synchronized with the<br>
fast frequency shift keying encoder and then brought out on the terminals.<br>
The selections offered are: Baud rate, which can be 1200, 2400 or 4800 and the data<br>
format. The data format includes number of stop bits to be provided, parity even or odd<br>
and the data length and are settable via jumpers.<br>
GTS Port<br>
The graphical touch screen (GTS) port is a simple RS232C 3 wire interface.<br>
GPS Port<br>
The global positioning system (GPS) port is directly connected to the global positioning<br>
system device. The global positioning system device is setup for the following serial<br>
settings:<br>
9600 baud, 1 stop bit, No Parity, 8 bit data.<br>
The connections are available on the special 2 mm pitch connector compatible to the global<br>
positioning system module.<br>
Scada and Spare Ports<br>
These ports are configured for 2 wire RS485/422 connectivity with built in line drivers. Pull<br>
up resistors are provided on board on the output lines. Transmit control is achieved via the<br>
corresponding DTR lines.<br>
PMS Port<br>
The payload monitoring system port is provided for interface to payload management<br>
systems. Additional to the Rx and Tx lines, the RTS and CTS lines are brought out on the<br>
terminals.<br>
EMS Port<br>
The engine monitoring system port is configured for RS485, 4 wire interface with internal<br>
pull ups. Line driver is built into the board.<br>
Digital Inputs &amp; Outputs<br>
The on-board processing unit board offers 8 optically isolated digital inputs and 8 optically<br>
isolated digital outputs. The inputs and outputs are mapped through the unused 10 pins<br>
on the UART devices. Hence direct operation of the inputs/outputs is not recommended.<br>
The provided DIO driver should be used for the same.<br>
Analog Inputs<br>
8 Optically isolated analog input channels are provided on the on-board processing unit<br>
board. These inputs should as specified below:<br>
1. 4-20mA<br>
2. Source should be able to provide at least 2V at 4 mA and should not exceed<br>
20V at 20mA.<br>
3. The inputs are loop powered.<br>
4. No series connections of loads is possible.<br>
The inputs are conditioned and fed into a 100 Ksps analog to digital converter with a<br>
parallel interface to the microprocessor. Start conversion and end of conversion signals are<br>
fed into the microprocessor directly. Since the interface is a special multiplexed parallel<br>
interface, only the Analogy IO driver provided with the BIOS/INTOS should be used to read<br>
the inputs.<br>
The software development kit consists of the following:<br>
o Development Tools<br>
¦ TurboC Compiler<br>
¦ Startup files and libraries<br>
¦ Downloading and debugging tools<br>
o Basic interface operating system in library version<br>
The BIOS<br>
The on-board processing unit card is with a basic BIOS which initializes the hardware and<br>
then waits for a host command for 5 seconds (configurable). If no command byte arrives<br>
from the host during this period, the BIOS continues to load the application program at<br>
address (HEX)F000:0000.<br>
Program Development<br>
The program development cycle is depicted in below:<br>
• Edit Code<br>
• Compile and Link<br>
• Convert to Target<br>
• Download / Debug<br>
• Compile and Link<br>
• Any Text<br>
• Editor<br>
• TurboC<br>
• Compiler<br>
• Exe2Prm/CNVT<br>
• ST3Link,Host<br>
• Watch, Wa04ex<br>
• Setflash/ sendfish<br>
As mentioned before, program development is done in C with compilation with the Turbo C<br>
compiler. Both the IDE or the command line compiler/linker can be used.<br>
The settings of the compiler and linker are important for proper functioning of programs at<br>
the target. These are listed below:<br>
• Directory Settings: Add the \include directory to the include path.<br>
• Library directory should be set to \ clib<br>
• Compiler settings:<br>
&gt; Large memory model<br>
&gt; C Calling Convention, 186 Instruction set, No Floating point<br>
&gt; Byte alignment, default unsigned, Generate under bars<br>
&gt; Test Stack off<br>
&gt; Initialize segments On, Case sensitive link ON<br>
&gt; Default libraries off, Graphics library off<br>
&gt; All projects should include the file \clib\OBPUin.obj.<br>
The stack required by the program can be set by the following declaration outside the<br>
main():<br>
extern unsigned_stklen = 4096.<br>
This declares 4K words of stack. Please note that since stack checking is disabled, it is up<br>
to the programmer to ensure that the amount of stack of required is declared.<br>
Memory models other than Large are not supported by the toolkit.<br>
After the application program is loaded, the operating system hands over control to the<br>
application programs main() function. After this, the operation system only provides the<br>
various services, but is not \n control. Hence, the application should never return i.e. the<br>
main program should not return.<br>
If a return statement is executed from main, then the system will behave unpredictably.<br>
Target Conversion<br>
Once the program has been edited and complied/linked, the Turbo C compiler creates a<br>
dos executable file. This executable should now be converted into a format that can run<br>
on the target kit (i.e. on-board processing unit). This is done by the program EXE2PRM<br>
that is in the \bin directory and is used for converting the EXE file into a PRM file. The<br>
syntax for using this utility is as follows:<br>
Exe2prm <exe file><prmfile><target address><br>
The first parameter is the name of the executable file that is to be converted. Note that no<br>
extension is to be provided.<br>
The second parameter is the name of the prm file that is to be created.<br>
Note that no extension is to be provided.<br>
The target address is the paragraph in hex where the program is to be loaded.<br>
Note that all programs that are to be flashed should be targeted to (hex) 100. A batch file<br>
CN.bat has been provided in the \bin directory to do this.<br>
The syntax for usage is;<br>
Cn <br>
Downloading to Target OBPU - The Host Utility<br>
The next step after the creation of the prm file is to download it to the kit and execute it.<br>
The ST3LINK program is provided for this purpose. A batch HOST is also provided which<br>
basically invokes ST3LINK along with the COM port that is to be used and the bin directory<br>
path. When Host is invoked, it issues the following prompt:<br>
On-board processing unit. Reference Manual Ver 1.0<br>
&gt;<br>
The user can type various commands. By pressing ? followed by enter, the system<br>
shows a help screen. The main commands are described here:<br>
I <hex address><hex byte><br>
This commands reads inputs from the port address specified and shows the vaiue in hex.<br>
0 <hex address><hex byte><br>
This command outputs the hex byte to the hex address specified.<br>
L <br>
This command downloads the prm file specified and executes it on the target. Note that<br>
the file extension is not to be specified.<br>
The F command has been provided for backward compatibility - its use is not<br>
recommended.<br>
For both the L and F commands, the prm should be relocated for (hex) 100.<br>
D <br>
This command downloads the prm file and executes it. This command does not require<br>
the prm file to be targeted to (hex) 100 - the target address can be anything within the<br>
RAM area. However, this command has the following limitations:<br>
a. it does not allow programs larger than 32K to be downloaded<br>
b. it works in half duplex and hence program downloading is slower<br>
X <br>
This command executes a series of host commands stored in the text file<br>.<br>
For example, if one wishes to test a new device attached on the expansion bus and it takes<br>
a few inputs and outputs to complete a single test, a script file can be made with the<br>
commands and executed in one stroke.<br>
W<br>
This command waits for a key press. Normally, this command is used in a script file.<br>
Program Debugging<br>
A debugging utility is provided for printing error messages and variable values to the host<br>
screen as well as receive input from the host keyboard to control program flow.<br>
This utility has two parts:<br>
One which is linked into the user program to be debugged<br>
One which runs on the host<br>
The user program should do the following to enable debugging:<br>
1. The dbgutil.obj and dbgtil.obj modules should be linked into the user program.<br>
2. Dbgutil.h and uart041.h should be included in user program<br>
3. Dbgprint() should be called at program entry<br>
4. Dbgprintf() and dbggetch() can be used to send and receive from the host<br>
5. The program should not use the primary serial port for any other purpose i.e. it<br>
should not call the Seriallnit() and the other serial port functions.<br>
On the host side, the Watch04 program is provided in the \bin directory.<br>
This program can be evoked by typing:<br>
Watch04 <br>
Where <comport> can be 0 for C0M1 and 1 for COM2.<br>
The prompt<br>
is displayed.<br>
All characters typed are sent to on-board processing unit and all received characters are<br>
printed on the monitor. Pressing Q will end the program.<br>
Note that the Host program works at 57Kbaud and the watch program works at 115K.<br>
Utilities<br>
Several utilities have been provided. These are:<br>
1. Filechk : in the \utils directory. This is used for file system maintenance.<br>
2. sendflsh : for flashing an application program for automatic running after power on.<br>
3. Sendboot: for changing the BIOS with a later version.<br>
4. Formboot: for making a boot image from a prm file.<br>
All these programs are implemented in a combo fashion: i.e. a prm file is first downloaded<br>
using Host followed by execution of the tool on the PC.<br>
File System Utility<br>
The filechk.prm program is the part of the program that is executed on the kit (i.e. on-<br>
board- processing unit) This is to be downloaded before the PC counterpart is started.<br>
On the PC, run WA04ex <comport>, where <comport> can be 0 or 1.<br>
The commands currently supported are:<br>
&gt; Format - for formatting the file system, all data is lost<br>
&gt; Mem - to determine the amount of memory left in the file system<br>
&gt; Dir - to see the directory of files<br>
&gt; Copy - to copy files<br>
&gt; Del -to delete files<br>
Other commands are not supported in the current version.<br>
Flashing Application Program<br>
During program development, the system is booted in the debug mode i.e. a serial byte is<br>
sent within 5 seconds (configurable) after power on. The downloaded program is directly<br>
stored in RAM and executed. However, after the final program is ready, the system should<br>
be made to start automatically into the application program after power on,<br>
The flashing utility consists of the setflobp.prm file, which is to be downloaded via host.<br>
Start host and type:<br>
I <pathtobin>\setflcrd<br>
to download the file. The system displays:<br>
Waiting for PC<br>
The user can now execute sndflobp with the following parameters:<br>
Sndflobp <comport><prm file><br>
Here,<br><comport> can be 0 or 1<br> is the program to be flashed. Note that the extension is to be specified.<br>
The program reports successful flashing or failure as the case may be.<br>
On the next power cycling, the kit i.e. on-board processing unit will start this prm file i.e. it<br>
will transfer from the Flash to the RAM (instead of downloading into RAM) and run the<br>
program.<br>
Note: An application to be flashed should be relocated for (hex) 100 with the on utility. It<br>
should not be 62K in size, including data and code. If the program is more than 64K, then<br>
the boot bios will be lost and the board cannot be serviced without externaiiy programminq<br>
the flash with the basic boot.<br>
Changing the Boot Bios<br>
If the BIOS is to be upgraded or changed, then the sndbtobp utility can be used. Note that<br>
such a BIOS should not be more than 2K in size. Moreover, the bios PRM file should be<br>
converted to a BIN file using the formboot utility Similar to the application flashing utility,<br>
the setflobp program is downloaded first. Thereafter, the sndbtobp program should be run<br>
on the PC as given below:<br>
Sendboot <comport><binfile><br>
The bin file should be specified along with the extension. The system will now boot with<br>
the new code after power cyciina or application or reset.<br>
Converting PRM file to Boot file<br>
The bios program is basically compiled and converted to a PRM file. However, more boot<br>
information is to be added and this information is board specific. The formboot utility<br>
handles this function. The usage is:<br>
Formboot <br>
The prm file should be specified along with the extension. The program creates a bin<br>
tmpl.bin, which can then be renamed as required. Note that any file with the tmpl.bin<br>
wiii be overwritten.<br>
The invention can be used especially for vehicle tracking &amp; remote data acquisition on<br>
mobile equipment used in mining industry or transport industry. This technology can be<br>
