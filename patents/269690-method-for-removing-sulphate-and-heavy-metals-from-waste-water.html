Method for removing sulfate and heavy metals from waste water<br>
The invention relates to a method for processing waste waters<br>
containing sulfate and heavy metals. Such waste waters are<br>
produced in large amounts, in particular, in mining during<br>
transport, refining and extraction of metal ores.<br>
Conventionally, sulfate is precipitated out of such waste<br>
waters as calcium sulfate by pH reduction and addition of a<br>
precipitant such as milk of lime, and removed from the waste<br>
water using sedimentation tanks or filter stages. Owing to the<br>
heavy metal content of the waste waters, the sulfate sludges<br>
must be treated as special waste and stored in special<br>
landfills at high expense. US 5,587,079 discloses a method in<br>
which the heavy metals are precipitated out by introducing<br>
hydrogen sulfide and are separated off. Some of the sulfate-<br>
containing water is fed to a bioreactor in which sulfate is<br>
converted to H2S using sulfate-reducing bacteria, which H2S is<br>
used for the precipitation of heavy metals. Excess sulfate is<br>
converted to H2S in the bioreactor, wherein this is reacted to<br>
form metal sulfides. A disadvantage of this method is,<br>
especially, that the total amount of waste water must be passed<br>
through the bioreactor in order to separate off all of the<br>
sulfate contained therein. This requires not only a very large<br>
bioreactor having corresponding operating and service<br>
expenditure, but in addition further method steps and<br>
corresponding apparatuses for reacting the hydrogen sulfide<br>
generated to form metal sulfides. A further disadvantage is<br>
that in the case of large amounts of sulfate, a correspondingly<br>
large amount cf metal sulfides is formed which are in addition<br>
to the metal sulfides which are precipitated out of the waste<br>
water containing heavy metals. Therefore, in total a very large<br>
amount of metal sulfides is produced which, in the lack of<br>
possibilities for reutilization lead to considerable problems<br><br>
of disposal and/or landfill. For instance, there is the risk,<br>
for example, that on<br><br>
contact with acidic water, hydrogen sulfide is expelled from<br>
the sulfides.<br>
In the light of this the object of the invention is to propose<br>
an alternative processing method for waste water containing<br>
sulfate and heavy metals, by which method, in particular said<br>
disadvantages can be avoided.<br>
This object is achieved according to claim 1 by a method in<br>
which, in a first treatment stage, hydrogen sulfide is passed<br>
through the waste water. In this process heavy metals present<br>
in the waste water, such as copper, iron or manganese, are<br>
precipitated cut as sulfides and removed from the waste water<br>
before, in a second treatment stage, calcium sulfate is<br>
precipitated out of the waste water by addition of a<br>
precipitant. This procedure has the advantage that the<br>
separation of the sulfate from the waste water can proceed<br>
essentially only in a single step, if appropriate with<br>
downstream connection of filtering for separating off residual<br>
water. In contrast, separating off sulfate in the known method<br>
requires at least two steps, namely passing virtually all of<br>
the amount of waste water through the bioreactor and subsequent<br>
reaction to form metal sulfides, which obviously requires the<br>
use of corresponding salts, that is an additional expenditure<br>
on chemicals. In contrast to metal sulfides, precipitated<br>
calcium sulfate (gypsum) can be utilized in the construction<br>
industry as additive for production of bricks or as binder. It<br>
is further advantageous that in the proposed method only a<br>
relatively small bioreactor is required since it serves<br>
exclusively for generating the amount of hydrogen sulfide<br>
required for precipitating out the heavy metals present in the<br>
waste water.<br>
The respective amount of hydrogen sulfide required may be<br>
controlled in a simple manner by the amount of calcium sulfate<br><br>
fed to the third treatment stage, namely in such a manner that<br>
stoichiometric fractions of sulfides and heavy metal ions are<br>
present. In order, for example, in the case of fluctuating<br>
heavy<br><br>
metal content, to reduce the expenditure on analysis, an<br>
excess of hydrogen sulfide, in particular 20 mol%, can be<br>
employed, compared with the stoichiometric amount. In the case<br>
of lower heavy metal contents, unused hydrogen sulfide can, for<br>
example, be temporarily stored, in order to be reused when<br>
required.<br>
The precipitant used is preferably calcium aluminate. The use<br>
of sodium aluminate is also conceivable.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawing which shows a flow<br>
diagram of a method according to the invention.<br>
For the waste water treatment method in question, essentially<br>
in total three treatment stages are required which are<br>
characterized by I-III in the drawing. A waste water to be<br>
purified is first fed to the treatment stage I. This comprises<br>
a reactor 1 for treating the waste water with hydrogen sulfide.<br>
The reactor 1 is charged with waste water via a line 2. Via a<br>
line 3, hydrogen sulfide is fed to the reactor 1 at a position<br>
lying in its bottom region. In order to distribute the hydrogen<br>
sulfide as finely as possible in the waste water, a circulation<br>
appliance is present. This comprises a circulation line 5 which<br>
branches off in the lid region of the reactor and opens out<br>
into the reactor 1 at a lower position, in which circulation<br>
line a pump 6 is arranged. This circulates the waste water at<br>
high velocity, wherein strong turbulence occurs within the<br>
reactor 1, which turbulence promotes mixing of the reactants.<br>
Heavy metal sulfides formed by introducing hydrogen sulfide are<br>
conducted upward by the flow of the waste water and pass via an<br>
outlet 7 arranged in the region adjacent to the lid into a<br>
filter unit 8 which is arranged downstream of the reactor 1.<br>
Here, the heavy metal sulfides are filtered out of the waste<br>
water. In the bottom region of the filter unit 8, primary<br>
sludge containing heavy metal sulfide is taken off via a line 9<br><br>
and subjected to a filtration, for example using a plate filter<br>
press 10. The filtrate and/or waste water purified of heavy<br>
metal sulfides is withdrawn from the filter unit 8 via a line<br>
12 and fed to the treatment stage II.<br>
The treatment stage II comprises a settling container 13 having<br>
a funnel- or wedge-shaped bottom 14. At a position close to the<br>
top 15 of the settling container 13, the line 12 coming from<br>
the filter unit 8 opens out into the settling container 13.<br>
From a storage container 16, calcium aluminate as precipitant<br>
is introduced into the settling container 13. To accelerate the<br>
precipitation process, a stirrer appliance 17 is present in the<br>
settling container 13, which stirrer appliance is driven by a<br>
motor 18. The precipitated calcium sulfate, when the stirrer<br>
appliance 17 is still, collects at the bottom 14 of the<br>
settling container 13 and is taken off as secondary sludge via<br>
a line 19 whereas waste water essentially freed from sulfate is<br>
withdrawn via a line 20 which is arranged close to the top 15.<br>
A part of the secondary sludge is fed to the treatment stage<br>
III via a line 22 which branches off from the line 19.<br>
The treatment stage III is formed essentially by a bioreactor<br>
23 in which sulfate is converted to hydrogen sulfide in a<br>
manner known per se using sulfate-reducing bacteria. In order<br>
that this conversion can take place, anoxic conditions are<br>
maintained in the bioreactor 23. Reaction of the sulfate to<br>
form hydrogen sulfide reguires an electron donor or a carbon<br>
source. This is fed to the bioreactor 23 in the form of<br>
organically polluted waste water 24 via a storage container 25<br>
and a line 26. Hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide form as<br>
reaction products of the microbiological metabolic processes.<br>
The reactor 1 of treatment stage I is charged with this gas<br>
mixture via the line 3. By means of the reactions in the<br>
bioreactor 23, solids especially of organic nature are formed<br>
which, via a line 27 which opens out in a region close to the<br>
bottom of the bioreactor 23,<br><br>
are fed to a filter unit, for instance likewise a filter plate<br>
10. The filtrate can if appropriate be recirculated to the<br>
bioreactor 23.<br><br>
