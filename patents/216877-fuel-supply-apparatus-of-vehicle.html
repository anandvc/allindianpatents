The vapor bleeding hole 12D is open downward by<br>
an opening portion 12Da, in the pump bottom portion<br>
12E of the electric fuel pump P, a partition wall 14<br>
formed substantially in a U shape and protruding<br>
downward from the pump bottom portion 12E is provided<br>
around the opening portion 12Da, and an opening portion<br>
14A of the partition wall 14 is open sideward.<br>
Further, the fuel suction passage 12C protruding<br>
downward is provided in the pump bottom portion 12E,<br>
and an engagement step portion 12Ca facing downward<br>
is provided in an outer periphery of the fuel suction<br>
passage 12C. Further, a supporting boss 15 protruding<br>
downward is provided in the pump bottom portion 12E,<br>
and the supporting boss 15 has an engagement stepportion<br>
15a which is disposed in a side of the fuel suction<br>
passage 12C and faces downward.<br>
The engagement step portions 12Ca and 15a are<br>
formed so that the protruding heights from the pump<br>
bottom portion 12E are the same.<br>
Reference numeral 16 denotes a rubber plate formed<br>
in a thick disc shape and arranged so as to face to<br>
the pump bottom portion 12E. The rubber plate 16 is<br>
formed in a disc shape which is substantially the same<br>
as the shape of the pump bottom portion 12E.<br>
Further, a recess portion 16B extending downward<br>
from an upper surface 16A of the rubber plate 16 is<br>
recessed in this rubber plate 16. The recess portion<br>
16B surrounds an outer periphery of the partition wall<br>
14, and a bottom portion 16Ba of the recess portion<br>
16B is arranged so as to face to the opening portion<br>
12Da of the vapor bleeding hole 12D, and the recess<br>
portion 16B is open sideward by an opening portion 16Bb<br>
(the opening portion 16Bb of the recess portion 16B<br>
and the opening portion 14A of the partition wall 14<br>
are open in the same direction).<br>
Further, an escape hole 16D is provided in the<br>
rubber plate 16 so as to extend from the upper surface<br>
16A toward a lower surface 16C, and the escape hole<br>
16D is formed in a shape capable of passing the fuel<br>
intake passage 12C and the supporting boss 15 through.<br>
The filter F is formed by a fuel flow passage boss<br>
17 inserted to a outer periphery of the fuel suction<br>
passage 12C and a mesh-like filter portion (not shown) .<br>
A collar portion 17A extending sideward is formed in<br>
an upper end of the fuel flow passage boss 17, and a<br>
filter mounting hole 17B ispierced in the collarportion<br>
17A.<br>
Further, the bottom plate 11A formed so as to be<br>
bent in a horizontal direction from a lower end of the<br>
supporting bracket 11 is formed in a shape facing<br>
substantially the whole of the pump bottom portion 12E<br>
of the electric fuel pump P, and an escape hole 11Aa<br>
capable of passing at least the fuel suction passage<br>
12C through is formed in the bottom plate 11A.<br>
Further, the electric fuel pump P is mounted to<br>
the supporting bracket 11 in accordance with the<br>
following manner.<br>
First, the filter F is attached to the electric<br>
fuel pump P.<br>
This is achievedby inserting the fuel flowpassage<br>
boss 17 of the filter F to the fuel suction passage<br>
12C protruding from the pump bottom portion 12E of the<br>
electric fuel pump P, whereby the collar portion 17A<br>
is brought into contact with the engagement step portion<br>
12Ca of the fuel flow passage boss 17 and the engagement<br>
step portion 15a of the supporting boss 15, and at this<br>
time, the filter mounting hole 17B of the collar portion<br>
17A is inserted to and arranged in the supporting boss<br>
15 .<br>
Then, in this state, a push nut 18 is arranged<br>
so as to be fitted toward the supporting boss 15, whereby<br>
the filter F is attached to the electric fuel pump P.<br>
Next, the rubber plate 16 is attached toward the<br>
pump bottom portion 12E of the electric pump P.<br>
That is, an escape hole 16Da of the rubber plate<br>
16 passes the fuel flow passage boss 17 of the filter<br>
F, the fuel suction passage 12C and the outer periphery<br>
of the supporting boss 15 through, and the upper surface<br>
16A of the rubber plate 16 is brought into contact with<br>
the pump bottom portion 12E. On the other hand, the<br>
recess portion 16B open toward the upper surface 16A<br>
of the rubber plate 16 is arranged so as to surround<br>
the outer periphery of the partition wall 14 protruding<br>
from the pump bottom portion 12E, and at this time,<br>
the bottom portion 16Ba of the recess portion 16B closes<br>
the lower opening of the partition wall 14 and is<br>
arranged so as to face to the opening portion 12Da of<br>
the vapor bleeding hole 12D.<br>
Accordingly, the filter F and the rubber plate<br>
16 are arranged in the pump bottom portion 12E of the<br>
electric fuel pump P, the lower surface 16C of the rubber<br>
plate 16 is arranged on the bottom plate 11A of the<br>
supporting bracket 11 in this state, and the electric<br>
fuel pump P is fastened to the supporting bracket 11<br>
by the fastening band 12F after being set to this state.<br>
In accordance with the conventional fuel supply<br>
apparatus of the vehicle, when the supporting bracket<br>
11 or the electric fuel pump P vibrates under operation<br>
of the engine or under operation of the electric fuel<br>
pump , a vibration in a vertical direction of the electric<br>
fuel pump P is absorbed by the rubber plate 16.<br>
Further, the impeller 12B rotates within the pump<br>
chamber 12A, whereby the vapor is generated within the<br>
pump chamber 12A. The vapor is discharged toward the<br>
exterior from the opening portion 12Da of the vapor<br>
bleeding hole 12D together with a part of the fuel which<br>
is pressure increased within the pump chamber 12A, and<br>
the fuel containing the vapor once collides against<br>
the bottom portion 16Ba of the recess portion 16B in<br>
the rubber plate 16, thereafter changes its flowing<br>
direction sideward, and is discharged side ward from<br>
the opening portion 14A of the partition wall 14.<br>
Accordingly, the pressure increased fuel<br>
containing the vapor does not collide against the<br>
filtering portion of the filter F to break or deform<br>
the filtering portion.<br>
In accordance with the conventional fuel supply<br>
apparatus mentioned above, since the recess portion<br>
16B surrounding the partition wall 14 and facing to<br>
the vapor bleeding hole 12D is required in the rubber<br>
plate 16, it is necessary to form the rubber plate 16<br>
in a shape covering substantially the whole of the pump<br>
bottom portion 12E in the electric fuel pump P.<br>
Accordingly, a diameter of the rubber plate 16 is<br>
increased, and it is impossible to achieve a reduction<br>
in cost of the parts.<br>
That is, when the diameter of the rubber plate<br>
16 is increased, a metal mold of the rubber plate 16<br>
becomes expensive and a material cost is increased.<br>
In particular, in the case that the gasoline fuel<br>
containing an alcohol is used, it is necessary to use<br>
a rubber material containing a fluorine, whereby an<br>
increase of the material cost is significantly large.<br>
Further, the fuel injected from the opening<br>
portion 12Da of the vapor bleeding hole 12D directly<br>
collides against the bottom portion 16Ba of the recess<br>
portion 16B in the rubber plate 16, and a deterioration<br>
of the rubber is promoted. Accordingly, this is not<br>
preferabie.<br>
Further, since the shape of the bottom plate 11A<br>
supporting one side of the rubber plate 16 is increased<br>
due to a large diameter of the rubber plate 16, the<br>
weight of the supporting bracket 11 is increased.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A fuel supply apparatus of a vehicle in accordance<br>
with the present invention is made by taking the problems<br>
mentioned above into consideration, and a main object<br>
of the present invention is to provide a fuel supply<br>
apparatus of a vehicle which can achieve a function<br>
of absorbing vibration between an electric fuel pump<br>
and a supporting bracket and a function of changing<br>
sideward a fuel flow containing vapor discharged from<br>

pump chamber and a vapor bleeding hole are open to the pump bottom portion, and which is attached<br>
to the supporting bracket; and<br>
a filter connected to the fuel suction passage of the electric fuel pump,<br>
wherein the fuel supply apparatus is characterized in that the filter is provided with a fuel<br>
flow passage boss inserted to and arranged in the fuel suction passage, and a collar portion extending<br>
sideward from the upper end of the fuel flow passage boss, the collar portion is provided with a filter<br>
mounting hole and a vapor bleeding hole opposing surface portion, the filter is attached to the electric<br>
fuel pump by arranging the fuel flow passage boss of the filter so as to insert to the fuel suction<br>
passage of the electric fuel pump, arranging the filter mounting hole so as to insert to a supporting<br>
boss protruding downward from the pump bottom portion, arranging the vapor bleeding hole<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A description will be given below of one embodiment<br>
of a fuel supply apparatus of a vehicle in accordance<br>
with the present invention with reference to Figs. 1<br>
and 2 .<br>
Fig. 1 is a vertical cross sectional view of a<br>
main portion near a bottom portion of an electric fuel<br>
pump attached to a supporting bracket, and Fig. 2 is<br>
a horizontal cross sectional view along a line C-C in<br>
Fig . 1 .<br>
In this case, since the same structure as the<br>
conventional one is used for an electric fuel pump P,<br>
the same reference symbols are attached, and a<br>
description thereof will be omitted.<br>
A filter F has a fuel flow passage boss 1 arranged<br>
so as to be inserted to a fuel suction passage 12C,<br>
is provided with a filtering portion (not shown)<br>
filtering the fuel in a lower portion of the fuel flow<br>
passage boss 1, and is provided with a flat collar<br>
portion 1A in the upper end of the fuel flow passage<br>
boss 1 .<br>
The collar portion 1A has a filter mounting hole<br>
1B and a vapor bleeding hole opposing surface portion<br>
1C, and the filter mounting hole 1B is pierced so as<br>
to pass through the collar portion 1A and is inserted<br>
to a supporting boss 15 protruding from a pump bottom<br>
portion 12E.<br>
Further, the vapor bleeding hole opposing surface<br>
portion 1C is formed in a shape closing a lower opening<br>
of a U-shaped partition wall 14 open downward from the<br>
pump bottom portion 12E.<br>
Reference numeral 2 denotes a tubular insulator<br>
made of a rubber material. The tubular insulator 2<br>
is constituted by a large diameter portion 2A and a<br>
small diameter portion 2B. Among them, the large<br>
diameter portion 2A is formed in a shape partly facing<br>
to the pump bottom portion 12E and is formed in a<br>
cylindrical shape or a rectangular column shape, and<br>
the small diameter portion 2B is formed in a cylindrical<br>
shape. For example, a diameter of the large diameter<br>
portion 2A is 10 mm, and a diameter of the small diameter<br>
portion 2B is 4 mm (however, the diameters are not<br>
limited to these numerals).<br>
The upper end of the supporting bracket 3 is fixed<br>
to an illustrated lidbody 10, and the lower end thereof<br>
is bent sideward, whereby a bottom plate 3A is formed.<br>
The bottom plate 3A is formed in a fork shape,<br>
faces to a part of the pump bottom portion 12E in the<br>
electric fuel pump P, and on which the insulator 2 can<br>
be arranged.<br>
Further, two insulator mounting holes 3B are<br>
pierced on the bottom plate.<br>
Then, the filter F is attached to the electric<br>
fuel pump P in the following manner.<br>
The fuel flow passage boss 1 of the filter F is<br>
arranged so as to be inserted to the fuel suction passage<br>
12C, and the upper surface of the collar portion 1A<br>
of the filter F is arranged so as to be brought into<br>
contact with an engagement step portion 12Ca of the<br>
fuel flow passage boss 1 and an engagement step portion<br>
15A of the supporting boss 15.<br>
In a contact state of the collar portion 1A, the<br>
supporting boss 15 is arranged so as to be inserted<br>
to the filter mounting hole 1B, and the vapor bleeding<br>
hole opposing surface portion 1C is arranged so as to<br>
close a lower opening of the parti tion wall 14 protruding<br>
downward from the pump bottom portion 12E.<br>
This means that the vapor bleeding hole opposing<br>
surface portion 1C is arranged so as to oppose to an<br>
opening portion 12Da of a vapor bleeding hole 12D open<br>
to the inner side of the partition wall 14.<br>
Further, a push nut 18 is arranged so as to be<br>
fitted to the supporting boss 15 protruding downward<br>
with passing through the collar portion 1A, whereby<br>
the filter F is attached toward the pump bottom portion<br>
12E of the electric fuel pump P.<br>
On the other hand, the insulator 2 is arranged<br>
in the bottom plate 3A of the supporting bracket 3,<br>
a small diameter portion 2B of each of two insulators<br>
2 is arrangedsoas tobe insertedto eachof the insulator<br>
mounting holes 3B pierced in the bottom plates 3A,<br>
whereby the insulator 2 (particularly the large<br>
diameter portion 2A) is supported to each of the bottom<br>
plates 3A.<br>
Then, the electric fuel pump P to which the filter<br>
F is attached is mounted to the supporting bracket 3,<br>
the pump bottom plate 12E of the electric fuel pump<br>
P is arranged so as to face onto the bottom plate 3A,<br>
and is fastened to the supporting bracket 3 by a<br>
fastening band 12F shown in Fig. 3 in this state.<br>
In the fastening state mentioned above, the upper<br>
surface of the large diameter portion 2A in the insulator<br>
2 is arranged near the pump bottom portion 12E or<br>
arranged in contact therewith.<br>
In accordance with the fuel supply apparatus of<br>
the present invention having the structure mentioned<br>
above, as soon as the electric fuel pump P is driven,<br>
the foreign materials are removed from the fuel within<br>
the fuel tank T by the filtering portion of the filter<br>
F, this fuel is sucked into the pump chamber 12A via<br>
the inner side of the fuel flow passage boss 1 and the<br>
fuel suction passage 12C, and the fuel which pressure<br>
is increased in the pump chamber 12A is supplied to<br>
the engine via the fuel discharge passage 12G, the<br>
strainer S and the discharge pipe 13.<br>
In this case, the vapor generated within the pump<br>
chamber 12A is injected downward from the opening<br>
portion 12Da of the vapor bleeding hole 12D together<br>
with the fuel, and the fuel containing the vapor collides<br>
against the vapor bleeding hole opposing surface<br>
portion 1C of the filter F, thereafter changes a flow<br>
direction thereof outward, and is discharged leftward<br>
from the opening portion 14A of the partition wall 14<br>
open leftward.<br>
Accordingly, the pressure increased fuel<br>
containing the vapor does not collide against the<br>
filtering portion arranged below the fuel flow passage<br>
boss 1 of the filter F to damage and deform the filtering<br>
portion.<br>
On the other hand, during the operation of the<br>
engine, the electric fuel pump P and the supporting<br>
bracket 3 sometimes vibrate, however, a longitudinal<br>
vibration of the electric fuel pump P can be absorbed<br>
by the insulator 2.<br>
In the structure mentioned above, attention will<br>
be paid to the following points.<br>
That is, the filter mounting hole 1B and the vapor<br>
bleeding hole opposing surface portion 1C are provided<br>
in the collar portion 1A of the filter F, whereby it<br>
is possible to achieve a function of attaching the filter<br>
F to the electric fuel pump P and a function of changing<br>
the flowing direction of the fuel containing the vapor.<br>
Further, since the collar portion 1A provided with<br>
the filter mounting hole 1B and the vapor bleeding hole<br>
opposing surface portion 1C can be integrally injection<br>
molded by using a synthetic resin material at a time<br>
of forming the filter F, a manufacturing cost of the<br>
filter F is not increased.<br>
Further, in the structure mentioned above, since<br>
the filter F is provided with the function of changing<br>
the flowing direction of the vapor, the insulator 2<br>
is provided only with the vibration proofing function.<br>
Accordingly, it is sufficient that the insulator 2 is<br>
formed in a shape partly brought into contact with the<br>
pump bottom portion 12E, and it is possible to achieve<br>
to make the shape of the insulator 2 remarkably compact.<br>
Accordingly, even in case of manufacturing the<br>
insulator 2 by using an expensive rubber material, the<br>
manufacturing cost of the insulator 2 is not largely<br>
increased due to a little use amount of the material.<br>
Further, since the insulator 2 is made compact<br>
in the structure mentioned above, it is possible to<br>
make the shape of the bottom plate 3A of the supporting<br>
bracket 3 supporting the insulator 2 small, whereby<br>
it is possible to largely reduce the weight of the<br>
supporting bracket 3 and it is possible to reduce the<br>
manufacturing cost of the supporting bracket 3 by the<br>
press molding.<br>
As described above, in accordance with the fuel<br>
supply apparatus of the vehicle of the present invention,<br>
the filter is provided with the fuel flow passage boss<br>
inserted to and arranged in the fuel suction passage,<br>
and the collar portion extending sideward from the upper<br>
end of the fuel flow passage boss, the collar portion<br>
is provided with the filter mounting hole and the vapor<br>
bleeding hole opposing surface portion, the filter is<br>
attached to the electric fuel pump by arranging the<br>
fuel flow passage boss of the filter so as to insert<br>
to the fuel suction passage of the electric fuel pump,<br>
arranging the filter mounting hole so as to insert to<br>
the supporting boss protruding downward from the pump<br>
bottom portion, arranging the vapor bleeding hole<br>
opposing surface portion so as to oppose to the opening<br>
portion of the vapor bleeding hole, and fitting the<br>
push nut to the supporting boss protruding from the<br>
filter mounting hole of the collar portion, the<br>
insulator mounting hole is pierced in the bottom plate<br>
of the supporting bracket, the tubular insulator made<br>
of the elastic member is arranges so as to be inserted<br>
to the insulator mounting hole, and the insulator is<br>
arranged between the bottom plate of the supporting<br>
bracket and the pump bottom portion of the electric<br>
fuel pump. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve the<br>
function of attaching the filter to the electric fuel<br>
pump and the function of changing the flow direction<br>
of the vapor without making the size of the filter large<br>
and increasing the manufacturing cost.<br>
Further, since the insulator may be formed in the<br>
small shape to be arranged so as to partly face to the<br>
pump bottom portion of the electric fuel pump, it is<br>
possible to inhibit a wide increase of the manufacturing<br>
cost even in case of manufacturing the insulator by<br>
the expensive rubber material.<br>
Further, since the insulator is made compact, it<br>
is possible to make the shape of the bottom plate of<br>
the supporting bracket supporting the insulator<br>
compact, whereby it is possible to achieve a weight<br>
reduction of the whole of the fuel supply apparatus<br>
and it is possible to reduce the manufacturing cost<br>
of the supporting bracket in accordance with the press<br>
molding.<br>
