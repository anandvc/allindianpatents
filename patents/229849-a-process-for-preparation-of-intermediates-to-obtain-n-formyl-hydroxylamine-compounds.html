Case 4-32890A/891/892/USN<br>
CHEMICAL PROCESS<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention is directed to a process for preparing certain antibacterial N-formyl hydroxyiamine compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
PDF is a metallopeptidase found in prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria. Protein synthesis in prokaryotic organisms begins with N-formyi methionine (fMet). After initiation of protein synthesis, the formyl group is removed by the enzyme PDF; this activity is essential for maturation of proteins. It has been shown that PDF is required for bacterial growth. See Chang et al., J. Bacterial., Vol. 171, pp. 4071-4072 (1989); Meinnel et al,J. BacterioL, Vol. 176, No. 23, pp. 7387-7390 (1994); and Mazel et al. EMBO J., Vol. 13, No. 4, pp. 914-923 (1994). Since protein synthesis in eukaryotic organisms does not depend on fMet for initiation, agents that will inhibit PDF are attractive candidates for development of new anti-microbial and anti-bacterial drugs.<br><br>

To prepare the starting material of the above-decrlbed process, i.e., formula (XI), the corresponding alkyl ester can be hydrolyzed as described by Stetter and Kuhlmann, Synthesis, pp. 29-30 (1979).<br>
For example, in a preferred preparation, a compound of formula (XVII)<br><br>

Contacting the compound of formula (XII') with a biphasic mixture of an aqueous mineral acid and an organic solvent to form the compound of formula (X1). The active (S) antibacterial agents can then be prepared using Steps 3-8 as described above.<br>
Pressure is not known to be critical for carrying out the various steps 1 - 8 and 1' -2' of the invention. Generally, depending on the particular step, a temperature of about -10Â°C to about 150Â°Cf preferably about 0Â°C to about 80Â°C, is typically employed. Typically about atmospheric pressure is used for convenience; however, variations to atmospheric pressure are not known to be detrimental. Oxygen is not known to be detrimental to the process, therefore for convenience, the various steps can be performed under ambient air, although an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, can be used If desired. For convenience,<br><br>
equimolar amounts of reactants are typically used; however, molar ratios can vary from about 1-2 equivalents, relative to the other reactant. The pH for most steps is typically about 2 pH to about 12 pH, although, as mentioned below, the pH for Step 2 must be very acidic. ThB solvent to be used for the various steps will depend on the nature of the reactants and other conditions and can be, e.g., ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, toluene, dichloromethane dioxane, methylene chloride, toluene, acetone, methylethylketone, THF, DMF, alcohols and the like; however, the solvents for Steps 1 and 2 are listed below.<br>
For Step 1, a typical temperature is about 10Â°C to about 90Â°C. Preferably in Step 1 , the reaction mixture is initially heated to about 5Q*C to about 90Â°C, and then cooled to crystallize the desired compound, e.g., at a temperature of about 10Â°C to about 40Â°C. The amount of resolving agent, i.e., (R)-ct-methylbenzylamine, employed is typically about 0 J molar equivalents to about 1.5 molar equivalents relative to formula (XI). The solvent for Step 1 is a mixture of an ester or an alkyl nftrile and an alcohol. Examples of esters include, e.g., alkyl acetates, such as isopropyl acetate, f-butyl acetate, ethyl acetate and the like. Examples of alkyl nitriles include, e.g., acetonitrile and the like. Examples of alcohols include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like. The ratio of ester or alkyl nitrile to alcohol can vary from about 90:10 to about 10:90, preferably about 75:25 to about 25:75, and most preferably about 50:50, the preceding ratios being based on volume:volume. The most preferred solvent is a mixture of ethyl acetate:2-propanol (50:50, voI:vol).<br>
For Step 2, a typical temperature is about 10Â°C to about 30Â°C, preferably about 20Â°C to about 25Â°C. Due to the presence of the acid, the pH for Step 2 is acidic and is typically about a pH of 1 or less. The solvent for step 2 is a mixture of an aqueous mineral acid and an organic solvent which forms a biphasic solvent comprising and aqueous and organic phases. The ratio (volume:votume) of aqueous mineral acid:organic solvent can vary widely, e.g., 90:10-10:90, more typically 60:40-40:60. The desired compound of formula (X) can be recovered from the organic phase using conventional purification and/or separation techniques known in the art such as distillation, filtration and the like. To increase yield, multiple extractions from the aqueous phase can be performed with the organic layers combined and then washed with an aqueous inorganic salt solution, such as a 10-40% by weight aqueous solution of sodium chloride. Strong mineral acids are typically used for Step 2, e.g., HCi, H2S04 and the like. The strength of the acid is strong enough for forming the desired compound, typically about 1 N to about 6 N, with about 2 N being preferred. The<br><br>
organic solvent can be ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, toluene, dichloromethane dioxane, methylene chloride, toluene, acetone, methyiethylketone, THF, DMF and the like.<br>
In U.S. Serial No.. 10/171,706, General Procedure A describes forming the compound of formula (XIII) by treatment of the compound of formula (XIV) with LiOH and H202. Another aspect of present process eliminates the need for using H202, thereby resulting in a process that is much safer, particularly upon scale-up.<br>
In Step i, the alkoxide of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol can be formed in situ by contacting p-methoxybenzyl alcohol with an organic base such as LiHMDS, NaHMDS, and the like. The solvent for Step I can be, for example, diethyl ether, DMF, NMP, THF and the like. The temperature for Step i is not known to be critical and can vary from about 10Â°C to about 40Â°C and, for convenience, is typically preferred at RT, e.g., about 20Â°C to about 25Â°C.<br>
For Step ii, the strong organic acid can be formic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. The acid typically solubilizes the compound of formula (XV), and therefore serves as the solvent for the reaction. The amount of acid is, therefore sufficient to solubilize and deprotect the compound of formula (XV). The temperature for Step ii is not known to be critical and can vary from about 10Â°C to about 40Â°C and, for convenience, is typically preferred at RT, e.g., about 20Â°C to about 25Â°C.<br>
For both Steps i and ii, the desired products can be purified and concentrated using conventional techniques known in the art. For example, a mixture of ethyl acetate and aqueous acid or base can be added to the reaction mixture to form a biphasic solution wherein the desired product will be In the organic phase. After separation of the organic phase, it can, If desired, be subject to multiple extractions with the same or different solutions. Typical acids for this use are strong mineral acids such as HCI, H2S04, and the like, and typical bases are sodium carbonate, and the like. Removal of the solvent can be accomplished using conventional techniques, e.g., distillation under reduced pressure. Further purification of the desired product can also be preformed, e.g., using chromatography such as flash chromatography, HPLC, and the like.<br>

in the presence of hydrogen gas and a palladium on carbon catalyst in a suitable solvent to form a compound of formula (XXVII)<br><br>
Insofar as the production of starting materials Is not particularly described, the compounds are known or may be prepared analogously to methods known in the art or as disclosed in the examples hereinafter. In U.S. Serial No. 10/171,706, General Procedure A describes forming the compound of formula XXVII.<br>
Furthermore, another aspect of the present invention provides a novel process for preparing active anti-bacterial compounds of formula (IX) by treatment the compounds of formula (VIII) with hydrogen at sub-atmospheric partial pressures in the presence of a palladium catalyst in ethanol. The present process minimizes production of by-product thereby resulting in a process that is environmentally benign. The reaction may be carried out by sparging a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen at 1 atm total pressure in a reaction mixture containing compound of formula (VIII), ethanol and a palladium catalyst, e.g., palladium on carbon. The desired hydrogen partial pressure is attained by varying the relative flow rate of nitrogen and hydrogen. A reasonable reaction time is required, i.e., the reaction is allowed to proceed until the desired product is formed.<br>
More specifically, another aspect of the present invention is directed to a process for preparing a compound of formula (IX)<br><br>
wherein<br>
X is -CHr, -S-, -CH(OH)-, -CH(OR)-, -CH(SHK -CH(SR)-, -CFr, -ON(OR)- or -CH(F)-; Rt is aryl or heteroaryl, preferably<br><br>
each of R2, R4and R6 independently is hydrogen or alkyl, or (R2 or R3) collectively form a C^Crcycloalkyi, preferably R2t R3, R5 are hydrogen and R4is n-butyl;<br>
n is 0-3, preferably 1. Comprising a step:<br>
Converting the compound of formula (XXV)<br>
wherein <br>
Y is a hydroxy-protecting group, preferably benzyl,<br>
to the compound of formula (IX) by removing the hydroxyl-protecting group by contacting the compound of formula (XXV) with molecular hydrogen at hydrogen partial pressures below 1 atm, preferably about 0.1 atm to about 0.24atm T white maintaining a total pressure of about 1atm in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as 5% Pd/C, in a suitable solvent, preferably ethanol, at about 10 to about 30 Â°C, typically about 20Â°C.<br>
When the debenzylation with molecular hydrogen is carried out at typical conditions (e.g., hydrogen partial pressures Â£ 1 atm) hydrogenolysis of the N-0 bond in the pyridine N-oxide moiety occurs to a significant extent (i.e. yields &gt; 1%), resulting In production of a byproduct (designated as "des-oxy C10") in substantial amounts.<br><br>
Because des-oxy C10 is difficult to separate from the reaction mixture by crystallization, it is highly desirable to eliminate or at least limit its production to very small . amounts.<br>
A means has been found to conduct the debenzylation very selectively, i.e., with des-oxy C10 yields of under 1%, by performing the reaction at hydrogen partial pressures below 1 atm. The examples 14 and 15 describe the experimental methods and results in detail.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is selective O-debenzylation in the presence of pyridine N-oxides via hydrogen transfer using formic acid/4-methylmorphoIine.<br>
The penultimate step of a synthesis of the compound of formula {IX) comprises a catalytic removal of hydroxy-protectng group by contacting the compound of formula (XXV) with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C. The compound of formula (XXV) , may include a pyridine N-oxide group; when the removal of hydroxy-protecting group is carried out at typical conditions (e.g., hydrogen partial pressures at or above 1atm) hydrogenolysis of the N-0 bond in the pyridine N-oxide occures to a significant extent, resulting in production of by product in significant amounts.The latter is difficult to separate.<br>
The deprotection can be carried out selectively via hydrogen transfer instead of using molecular hydrogen. A means has been found to conduct deprotection very selectively with a hydrogen transfer reagent comprising 4-methylmorpholine and formic add. Preferably 1.6 eq of 4-methylmorpholine and 1.4 eq of formic acid in the presene of a catalyst. Such chemical transformatin occurs at elevated temperatures, preferably reaction mixture is being heated at about 45Â°C for about 25Â±10 min.<br>

Example 14: Debenzvlation at hydrogen pressure of 0.24 atm:<br>
A means to operate at subatmospheric H2 partial pressures while maintaining a total pressure of 1 atmospheric was achieved (thus obviating solvent evaporation and leaks) by performing the reaction using H2 diluted with N2). The apparatus comprises two calibrated<br><br>
mass flow controllers, one for N2 and the other for H2f which allow for a controlled flow rate of each gas based on an inputted set point. By varying the relative flow rates of the two gases, any H2 partial pressure can be achieved. A 250-mL jacketed vessel equipped with a gassing agitator is charged with 8 g of C9, 62 g (~80 mL) of 200-proof ethanol, and 1.3 g of 5% Pd/C catalyst (Degussa, E1070 NO 5% Pd, water content 66.2 of wt %, Lot # 6JLG30), or 0.44 g of catalyst on a dry basis. The headspace is purged of air by flowing N2 through both mass flow controllers at about 30 cm3/min. The reactor is kept open to the atmospheric, giving a pressure of 1 atm in the vessel. The reaction is started by setting flow rates of 28 and 9 cm3/min, respectively, on the N2 and H2 mass flow controllers, giving a H2 partial pressure of 0.24 atm. A 700 rpm agitation rate is used, and the reaction temperature is 20Â°C. The lower hydrogen concentration in the liquid-phase gives a slower reaction, with the time required for 100% C9 conversion being about 3 h vs. 17 h for the 1-atm H2 partial pressure case. A significant des-oxy C10 selectivity advantage is observed at 0.24 H2 partial pressure. For example, a 0.99% des-oxy C10 yield is obtained at 97.6% C9 conversion, giving a selectivity of 1.01% vs. a des-oxy C10 yield of 6.07% at 99.8% C9 conversion, giving a selectivity of 6.1%, in the 1-atm case.<br>
Example 15: Debenzvlation at a hydrogen partial pressures of 0.1 atm:<br>
A 250-mL jacketed vessel equipped with a gassing agitator is charged with 8 g of C9,62 g (-80 mL) of 200-proof ethanol, and 1.4 g of 5% Pd/C catalyst (Degussa, E1070 NO 5% Pd, water content 68.05 of wt %, Lot # CC1 -2215), or 0.45 g of catalyst on a dry basis. The headspace is purged of air by flowing N2 through both mass flow controllers at about 30 cm3/min. The reactor is kept open to the atmospheric, giving a pressure of 1 atm in the vessel. The reaction is started by setting flow rates of 28 and 3 cm3/min, respectively, on the N2 and H2 mass flow controllers, giving a H2 partial pressure of 0.1 atm. A slower reaction is obtained relative to the 0.24 H2 partial pressure case (4.5 vs. 3 h)t but the reaction is not unreasonably long for a production process. Even more favorable des-oxy C10 selectivities are obtained at 0.1 atm H2 partial pressure, viz, 0.78% des-oxy C10 yield at 99.8% C9 conversion, giving a des-oxy C10 selectivity of 0.78% vs. a 0.99% des-oxy C10 yield at 97.6% C9 conversion, giving a selectivity of 1.01%, for the 0.24-atm H2 partial pressure case.<br><br><br><br>
