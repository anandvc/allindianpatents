				<td>This invention is general relates to cleaning/refining technology for petroleum products and in particular relates to machine for conditioning of diesel oil.<br>
There are varieties of impurities found in diesel oil being sold in the market. Among them very coarse and fine solid particles  free water and sludge are common. Presently known methods of conditioning of diesel are either cumbersome or not effective. This is due to the fact that micro-scopes droplets of water and soild dust evade the hitherto known methods employed for purification of diesel.<br>
In order to overcome the above said technical problem, the invention purpose the use of coalescing technology in which the small water droplets are made into big drops which can be easily separated from the diesel oil. This is required to free the diesel oil from water and solid substances so that the wear and tear of the equipment using diesel oil are drastically reduced, and further the life of the filters on the engine is considerably enhanced in addition to reducing corrosion of diesel machine parts. Consequently this invention results in substantial savings<br>
This invention has the primary objective of designing and developing a diesel oil conditioning machine which will overcome the aforesaid technical problems feted by the manufecturers and users of diesel oil.<br>
It is another object of the invention that the machine can be advantageously   to clean and transfer diesel oil from one tank to another and also to measure precisely the quantity of diesel oil transferred.<br>
It is another object of invention that the machine can be effectively and advantageously be used for cleaning storage tanks containing high-speed diesel oil..<br>
The diesel oil conditioning machine comprises coalescer/separater vessel, a prefilter vessel being connected to the said coalescer vessel, a gear pump having a suction strainer at its inlet, the filter vessels being fitted with a drain valve and a pressure gauge, the pump being driven by an electric motor and flow meter/totaliser being provided at the outlet of the plant to measure the flow rate/volume of the oil passed. This machine is suitable for purification of high-speed diesel oil used in I.C. Engines and other applications. The machine invented by us will have sweeping and varied used in many industries and precisely in any industry using high speed diesel oil for power generation. Engine drives and fluid boilers.<br>
Other advantages of this invention will be apparent from ensuing description of the invention with reference to the drawing accompanying the specification wherein:<br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrate in block diagram of the diesel oil-conditioning machine.<br>
The embodiment of the invention shown in the accompanying drawings comprises a gear pump, a prefilter vessel and coalescer/separater vessel. The gear pump has a suction strainer at its inlet and a filter vessels being provided with drain valve and pressure gauges The pump is driven by an electric motor. In order to measure the quantity of diesel transferred fi-om one tank to another suitable measuring instruments are provided in the embodiment under description a flow meter/totaliser is provided at the outlet of the plant to measure the flow rate of the oil passed. Anticipated result is the flow rate for high-speed diesel is 1200 L.P.H. The free water content in conditioned oil 15 p.p.m or less.<br>
It is clear from the illustration given in the accompmyiag drawii^ that the inlet stage of the machine, there is provided a strainer is provided for initial cleaning of the diesel oil. From the strainer the input line is connected to a gear pump, so as to increase the rate of flow of diesel inside the machine. A pressure gauge is connected at the output terminal of the pump. A pre-filter is connected to gauge. The pre-filter us connected to a fine filter arrai^ement. This fine filter contains, both coalescer and a separator. The output from the fine filter is conditioned diesel oil fit for public consumption. A totaliser attached at the output end registers the total quantity of consumption at every operation of the diesel oil-conditioning pump.<br>
