The present invention relates to a blade for wind turbines, in which biade, on the<br>
periphery layer of the cross section of the blade, a number of pre-fabricated<br>
strips are arranged.<br>
The present application has been divided out of Indian Patent Application No.<br>
63/KOLNP/2004. (hereinafter referred to as "parent application")<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wind turbine blades are today manufactured comprising a bearing central inner<br>
beam, commonly of a hollow, square cross-section and made from a glass fibre<br>
and resin composite, surrounded with two shells forming the upper and the lower<br>
outer surface of the blade and determining the aerodynamic properties thereof.<br>
The shells may be of a single layer or at least along a part of the circumference<br>
be a sadwich constructs comprising two parallel layers of glass fibres and<br>
resin having 3 space in between filed with e.g. a polyurethane foam. The use of<br>
a wooden material to reinforce the inner side of a single layer shell or to fill the<br>
space of a sandwich construction is well known, it is realised that the forces and<br>
torque increase steeply with the increasing length of blades and that the strength<br>
and stiffness of the inner beam must be steeply increased as well for the known<br>
blades, as the shells only contribute minor to the overall toad bearing properties<br>
of the blade. In order for the shell to bear a substantial part of the forces of the<br>
inner bearn, the above discussed structures that are reinforced with wooden<br>
material require for larger dimensions of blades a thickness of the wooden layer<br><br><br>
3<br>
that would increase the weight of the blade significantly, thus causing increased<br>
stresses to the blade.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a blade for a wind turbine which has<br>
properties of laminated products, i.e. high strength in comparison with the<br>
amount of material and lower production costs compared to solid products, but<br>
where the strength compared to the costs of manufacturing the blade is highly<br>
increased compared to prior art blades.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention of the "parent" application discloses a blade for a wind turbine,<br>
wherein at feast a third of the total length, measured from tip to hub, of said<br>
blade comprises a layer along an outer periphery of the cross-section of said<br>
blade, characterised in that the layer is at least partly constituted by a number of<br>
prefabricated strips arranged in a sequence along the outer periphery, and at<br>
least some of the pre-fabricated strips are fibrous composite material puftrusions.<br>
The present invention provides a bfa.de for a wind turbine, wherein at least a third<br>
of the total length, measured from tip to hub, of said bfade comprises a layer<br>
along an outer periphery of the cross-section of said blade, characterised in that<br>
the layer is at least partly constituted by a number of pre-fabricated strips<br>
arranged in a sequence along the outer periphery, said pre-fabrfcated strips<br><br><br>
4<br>
being arranged side by side so that connections between the adjacent strips are<br>
oriented substantially orthogonal to the surface of the layer in a plane orthogonal<br>
to the length of the blade.<br>
The present invention also provides a blade for a wind turbine wherein at least a<br>
third of the total length, measured from tip to hub, of said blade comprises a<br>
layer along an outer periphery of the cross-section of said blade, characterised in<br>
that the layer is at least partly constituted by a number of prefabricated strips<br>
arranged in a sequence along the outer periphery, wherein<br>
	at least some of the strips have elongated strip cross-sections in a plane<br>
orthogonal to the length of the blade ;<br>
	at least some of said strips are arranged with a short side of the strip<br>
cross-section along the outer periphery of the cross-section of the blade ; and/or<br>
	at least some of said strips are arranged with a long side of the strip<br>
cross-section substantially orthogonal to the outer periphery of the cross-section<br>
of the blade.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for manufacturing a<br>
prefabricated strip for a blade of a wind turbine, satd blade comprising a layer<br>
material arranged along an outer periphery of the cross-section of the blade, said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
	assembling at least two individual materials to constitute the pre-<br>
fabricated strip ;<br><br>
5<br>
	selecting at least one of said at least two individual materials among<br>
fibrous composite materials ;<br>
	inserting the assembled at least two individual materials into a container<br>
such as a bag ;<br>
	evacuating the container, infusing a curing resin, and allowing the resin to<br>
cure; and<br>
	taking out from the container the assembled and cured strip thus<br>
fabricated.<br>
The present invention in addition provides a method for manufacturing a shell for<br>
a blade of 3 wind turbine, said shell comprising a layer material arranged along<br>
an outer periphery of the cross-section of the shell, said layer comprising<br>
prefabricated strips, said method comprising the following steps :<br>
	applying a surface material, preferably gel coat, to a mould for the blade ;<br>
	optionally applying a metal mesh, a glass fibre mesh and any transfer<br>
media ;<br>
	providing at least two individual materials to constitute the pre-fabricated<br>
strips ;<br>
	selecting at least one of said at least two individual materials among<br>
fibrous composite materials :<br>
	positioning said at least two individual materials onto the other applied<br>
materials ;<br><br>
6<br>
	inserting the thus applied individual materials and other materials into a<br>
container:<br>
	evacuating the container, infusing a curing resin, and allowing the resin to<br>
cure; and<br>
	de-moulding from the mould the shell thus fabricated.<br>
Thus, the object is obtained by a blade, which blade over a substantial<br>
longitudinal part comprises a layer along an outer periphery of the cross-section<br>
of the blade, said layer being constituted by a plurality of pre-fabricated strips<br>
arranged in a sequence along the outer periphery of the blade.<br>
By the term "a substantial longitudinal part" is understood a part extending over<br>
at least a third of the total length of the blade from tip to bub, preferably over at<br>
least half of the total length of the blade. According to a preferred embodiment,<br>
60-85% of the total length, such as about 70%, comprises such layer.<br>
Thereby, the optimal material properties may be obtained by combining different<br>
types of strips, such as pultruded fibrous composite strips comprising different<br>
fibres, such as carbon fibres, glass fibres and/or natural fibres, wooden strips,<br>
composite strips formed as ho flow tubes etc. Each of the types of strips are<br>
much simpler, and thus cheaper, to manufacture than to form a whole blade, and<br>
the strips may be jointed by suitable methods, such as by injection of resin or by<br>
vacuum infusion of resin.<br><br>
7<br>
According to the instant invention, a wind turbine blade may be obtained, which<br>
reduces the forces and torque on the inner beam. Furthermore, the resistance<br>
against tension and compression forces in a layer near the outer periphery of the<br>
shell provides the blade with an improved structural efficiency with respect to an<br>
edge-wise bending mode.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, at least some of the pre-fabricated<br>
strips are made from pultruded fibrous composite material, such as carbon-resin.<br>
Thereby, a construction is obtained with an excellent stiffness, but which is not<br>
prone to buckling. Thus, the inner structure of the blade may be made of a<br>
lighter construction, e.g. by replacing the commonly used inner beam of a square<br>
cross section with two lighter webs at the leading edge and the travelling edge,<br>
respectively.<br>
The periphery layer may. in a preferred embodiment, be assembled by injection<br>
of resin or by vacuum infusion of resin. Use of resin infusion leads to a speedy,<br>
healthy and safe manufacturing process, leaving no or only very few voids in the<br>
resin. A limitation of the number of voids reduces subsequent finishing, A very<br>
little amount of the fibres in the blade is actually infused. The resin is mainly a<br>
glue rather thari a matrix. This results in a structure being more tolerant to any<br>
possible voids.<br><br>
8<br>
According to one. preferred embodiment, the blade over a substantial<br>
longitudinal part comprises a layer along the outer periphery of its cross-section,<br>
wherein the layer at least partly is constituted by strips of a wooden material and<br>
strips of a fibrous composite material In an alternating sequence along the outer<br>
periphery.<br>
Thereby, the excellent stiffness of fibrous composite materials and the high<br>
resistance against buckling of wooden materials is combined to achieve a shell<br>
with suitable properties in a cost-effective manner.<br>
An especially advantageous embodiment comprises at least some strips made<br>
from a wooden material, preferably plywood used as the wooden material, and<br>
natural fibre pultrusions, preferably carbon fibre pultrusions, as the fibrous<br>
composite material The advantages obtained by this embodiment are that the<br>
materials are compatible and both are having low thermal expansion coefficients.<br>
Both types of material work at similar low range of strains resulting in the<br>
possibility of stiffer blades as compared to the weight of the blades. Also, natural<br>
fibres may be prone to buckling, and although wood is bulky, wood is not prone<br>
to buckling, thus also for this reason, the two types of material are very<br>
complementary.<br><br>
9<br>
The strips may in general be made from wood, laminated wood, pultrusions from<br>
any fibre man-made or natural with any resin, thermoset, thermoplastic, man-<br>
made or naturally derived, foam plastics, lightweight core materials in any<br>
proportion, At least some of the pre-fabricated strips are advantageously formed<br>
from a fibrous composite material. The fibres of the fibrous material may be any<br>
known fibre having suitable properties to reinforce the wood composite, such as<br>
carbon fibres, glass fibres, Kevlar fibres, natural fibres, e.g. from hemp of flax,<br>
coir fibres, etc. or any combination thereof, As exampfe, carbon has a higher<br>
strain to failure than wood. Carbon acts as stiffening additive but wood fails first<br>
This has been taken advantage of in coupon testing to prove strength of carbon<br>
and wood separately. Adding carbon and thus the possibility of using thinner<br>
skins may reduce skin buckling margins Carbon fibres are relatively expensive :<br>
however, wood is cheap and can cover the area of the blade incurring very low<br>
costs. Wood itself, however, produces thick inefficient skins in highly stressed<br>
blades. Carbon fibres combined with wood may produce thinner skins, which are<br>
structurally efficient and satisfying. Also, wood is highly defect tolerant The<br>
percentage of the total cross-sectional area of the shell comprised of fibrous<br>
composite material is preferably within the range of 3% io 30% in the p^rt of the<br>
blade having highest content of the fibrous material, more preferred within the<br>
range of 6% to 20%.<br><br>
10<br>
Likewise, the of the total cross-sectional area of the shell comprised of fibres is<br>
preferably within the range of 2% to 20%, more preferred within the range of 4%<br>
to 15%.<br>
in a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least some of<br>
the strips are constituted by hollow tubes formed from a fibrous composite<br>
material. Thereby, material and weight is saved while advantageous structural<br>
properties are preserved.<br>
At least some of the strips of the fibrous composite material are preferably<br>
pultrusions, i.e. strips made by putrouding mixture of fibres and a matrix material<br>
that is cured after pultrusion, such as a processable resin, e.g. vinyl ester.<br>
Thereby, a strip having straight fibres and a low void content is obtained. Also, a<br>
low content of resin may be obtained leading to little shrinkage and rapid curing.<br>
It is thus advantageous that the pultrusions have a pultrusion direction<br>
substantially aligned with a longitudinal direction of the blade in which direction<br>
the properties of the fibres are required. However, pultrusion terminating joints<br>
are stress raisers, so particular attention is being given to these in structural<br>
element testing.<br><br>
11<br>
The fibrous composite material comprises advantageously a fibre volume<br>
fraction of 50% to 90%, preferably from 60% to 80%. In particular, the fibrous<br>
composite material may comprise a carbon fibre volume fraction of 50% to 90%,<br>
preferably from 60% to 80%.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment at least some of the pre-fabricated strips<br>
are made from a wooden material as wooden material are low in costs, have<br>
light weight, and the material properties of the wooden material may be<br>
completed to form the required blade material properties by combining with strips<br>
of other material types, such as fibrous composite materials. The wooden<br>
material may be stripe of wood, which if necessary are glued together in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the blade.<br>
A preferred embodiment employs plywood, in particular unidirectional plywood<br>
as the wooden material because of the homogeneous material properties.<br>
Another type of wooden material that may be employee! is comprised by wooden<br>
fibres held in a cured resin. Wood is seeing same direct stresses, so it is<br>
possible to use new joint patterns and glues using established design allowables,<br>
and stiil being confident of the structure of the wooden material.<br>
The layer is, according to one embodiment at least partly constituted by strips of<br>
a wooden material and stripe of a fibrous composite material in a sequence<br>
along the outer periphery. The sequence may preferably be an alternating<br><br>
12<br>
sequence of strips of a wooden material and strips of a fibrous composite<br>
material The alternating sequence preferably ranges over only a part of the<br>
complete periphery of the blade.<br>
It is advantageous that the layer discussed is part of a sandwich construction as<br>
discussed previously, i.e. is enclosed in an outer shell and an inner shell made<br>
from a fibrous composite material such as glass fibre web held by a cured<br>
synthetic resin.<br>

The invention may incorporate a lightning protection system comprising two<br>
possibly replacesble lightning attractors, preferably close to the tip. One of the<br>
lightning attractors are placed on the windward side, and the other lightning<br>
attraclor is placed on the leeward side. Both are connected to a width of<br>
aluminium mesh or similar material extending over the fibre reinforced area<br>
under the surface layer of gel coat of the blade, and are passed down to the root<br>
of the blade, where it is earthed.<br>
A radio frequency, e.g. a radar signal, absorption medium may optionally be<br>
infused with the rest of the structure. It is also possible to embed optical fibres in<br>
the blade, either additional to the reinforcing fibres or as a substitute to the<br>
reinforcing fibres. Optical fibres may be used to measure loads on and within the<br>
surface of the blade during operation of the wind turbine.<br>
Alternatively, resistance measurement of carbon fibres may be used to measure<br>
loads on or within the surface of the blade. Also, the carbon fibres used for<br>
measuring such loads may be one or more of the reinforcing fibres or may be<br>
carbon fibres additional to the reinforcing fibres and dedicated to measuring<br>
these loads.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The blade shown in cross-section in Fig. 1 has a layer comprised of 40 x 40<br>
millimetre strips of birch plywood 1 in alternating sequence wrth 6 x 40 millimetre<br>
strips of a carbon fibre puitrusion 2. The layer 1, 2 stretches along the central<br>
part of the blade between two C-beams 3,4 of a, fass fibre web and synthetic resin<br>
composite denoted the LE (leading edge) Web 3 and the TE (travelling edge)<br>
Web 4 and replacing the central inner beam discussed previously. The layer 1, 2<br><br>
17<br>
is sandwiched between an inner layer 5 and an outer layer 6 of glass epoxy<br>
skins that carry shear stress and promote the transverse stiffness of the blade.<br>
The space defined between the upper and lower shell thus constituted by the<br>
birch plywood 1 and the carbon fibre pultrusion 2, and the LE Web 3 and the TE<br>
Web 4 is lilted with a balsa wood core 7.<br>
The blade shown in Figs, 2a, 2b and 2c are similar to the one shown in Fig. 1;<br>
with the exception that the reinforcement of carbon fibre pultrusions 2 are<br>
situated near the areas of contact between the upper and the lower shell and the<br>
LE Web 3 and the TE Web 4, where the stress concentration is highest. In the<br>
embodiment shown, double web is used instead of a single web. This is to give<br>
sufficient buckling margin on the skins during compression. Also, the leading<br>
web reduces the leading edge joint shear load, alfowing a smaller leading edge<br>
joint area. This is advantageous during manufacturing of the blade.<br>
The technology is advantageous In that the addition of fibre pultrusions to a<br>
wood construction promotes the stiffness of the construction. The carbon fibre<br>
pultrusions are not used ail along the blade length but only in the middle 70%<br>
where required by the stresses. The btade skin cross section may be up to 10%<br>
by area of carbon fibre puitrusion in the more highly stressed regions, dispersed<br>
throughout the wood composite in the shown embodiment The skins are<br>
typically 60% of the thickness of the biade skins comprised purely by wood,<br><br>
18<br>
which reduces weight and improves the structural efficiency in the critical<br>
edgewise bending mode. The outer and inner glass epoxy skins are<br>
manufactured with glass fibres oriented plus and minus 45 degrees to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the blade.<br>
Pultrusions have the advantage of guaranteeing straight fibres and low void<br>
content in the carbon fibre composite itself. Furthermore, puitrusions have the<br>
advantage of speeding the blade infusion process as the fine carbon fibres<br>
would otherwise need significantly more time to infuse. The pultrusion has a high<br>
fibre volume fraction, about 70%, with a medium strength but highly processabfe<br>
resin, as example vinyl ester. Preferably, when manufacturing the blade, the<br>
resin is supplied with "peelply" on the two long sides, which is removed to<br>
produce a dean textured surface ensuring a good bond.<br>
The manufacturing process of a shell of a blade shown in Fig, 3 comprises the<br>
steps of applying a gei coat (not shown) to a mould 8 followed by a transfer<br>
media 9 such as a transfer mesh, 45 degrees glass fibre web 10 and epoxy (not<br>
shown) to the mould to create the outer glass epoxy skin. Hereafter the wood<br>
and pultrusion strips 1, 2 are positioned and a metal mesh 11 such as an<br>
aluminium mesh for the lightning protection is then applied. The shell is then<br>
wrapped in a container, in the process shown a vacuum bag 12, which is<br>
evacuated by exterior means 13. Then, resin is injected from a resin reservoir 14<br>
through resin channels 15 formed between adjacent strips, from which the resin<br><br>
19<br>
spreads throughout the construction driven by the vacuum. A general resin used<br>
for infusion is Prime 20 from SP Systems. After curing of the resin, an inner<br>
glass epoxy skin 16 is manufactured on top of the wood and pultruston strips 1,<br>
2.<br><br>
