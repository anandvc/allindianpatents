THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
TITLE:<br>
A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INITIATION AND AUTHENTICATION OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS AND SECURITY DOCUMENTS.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for initiation and authentication of negotiable instruments. Particularly, the present invention relates to the field of initiation and authentication of negotiable instruments and various security documents such as currency bills, pay-commands, demand drafts, certificates, cheques, traveler cheques, stamp papers, licenses, identity cards, packaging papers &amp; labels and various other documents that are required to be protected from potential counterfeiting.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Attempts have been made to develop methods and apparatus for initiating and authenticating negotiable instruments and security documents such as currency bills, pay-commands, demand drafts, certificates, cheques, traveler cheques, stamp papers, licenses, identity cards, packaging papers &amp; labels and other important documents which are required to be protected from counterfeiting.<br><br>
Several devices are known in the art for determining the denomination and authenticity of currency bills. Such devices commonly test different properties of a presented note and based on the properties sensed, give an indication of the denomination and/or authenticity of the presented note.<br>
The following are the methods known in the art for authenticating negotiable instruments.<br>
i)	watermarking<br>
ii)	embedding UV flakes<br>
iii)	printing UV invisible inks<br>
iv)	printing magnetic inks<br>
v)	printing magnetic invisible inks<br>
vi)	embedding metal threads<br>
vii)	designing with high resolution and multicolor artwork.<br>
viii)	Using numbering patterns.<br>
The European patent document No. EP1307840A1 discloses a system and method for authenticating documents and content thereof. A counterfeit resistant document recording medium is provided, having thereon a predefined unique document identifier and at least one security feature. The recording medium is thereafter imprinted with<br><br>
document content, which typically varies between documents. The document content is stored in a database, indexed by an associated document identifier. The document may then be authenticated by checking the security feature and comparing the stored document content with perceived document content.<br>
The international patent publication No. WO03046815A1 discloses an apparatus and a method for automatically identifying and validating a document, for validating the identity of a bearer of a document, for verifying that the bearer has authorization to participate in an activity represented by the document, and for comparing information on the document against information databases to determine if there are known concerns about the document or its bearer. A document type is narrowed by initially determining the size of the document, and is then identified from amongst a group of documents by looking for colors or other characteristics at specific locations on the document only until the document is identified. The order in which document locations are looked at is dependent upon a history of the types of documents that have been identified. An identified document is verified by first looking up reference information about the document type and using that information to read specific contents and check only specific security and other features utilized on the document. The contents of a document are checked against a database to verify its contents, and other databases are checked for stolen documents, known valid documents, and prohibited travel or entry. Biometrics in databases, on documents and directly from the document bearer are compared to verify the bearer.<br><br>
The U.S Patent application publication No.20020087463 discloses a method for processing a negotiable instrument which involves entering at least one negotiable instrument identifier into a terminal; transmitting at least one negotiable instrument identifier from the terminal to a host computer; receiving, at the terminal, a sign from the host computer, wherein the sign indicates an authorization status of the negotiable instrument; and automatically printing a mark on a document using a printer in communication with the terminal, wherein the mark corresponds with the sign so as to indicate the authorization status of the negotiable instrument.<br>
However, the above prior art methods and devices have the drawback of being capable of easily duplicated due to the development in technology and sophisticated technical analysis available today. By mimicking the properties of a negotiable instrument that are tested by prior art, it is often possible to have counterfeits accepted.<br>
Thus there exists a need for developing methods and apparatus for initiating and authenticating negotiable instruments which would overcome the drawbacks associated with the prior art and find solution to the problem of counterfeiting of negotiable instruments.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVETION<br>
The objects and advantages of the present invention are set out herein below:<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for initiation and authentication of negotiable instruments wherein the negotiable instruments are passed through a closed loop system for accurate identification of only authentic negotiable instrument and thereby not allowing counterfeit negotiable instruments to be authenticated negotiable instruments.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for initiation and authentication of negotiable instruments wherein a physical dynamic status is imparted to the negotiable instruments every time the negotiable instruments is presented for transaction and thereby enabling circulation of negotiable instrument through a highly secure channel.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the best mode for practicing the invention are described herein:<br>
The present invention discloses a method and apparatus for initiation and authentication of negotiable instruments. Particularly, the present invention relates to the field of initiation and authentication of negotiable instruments and various security documents such as currency bills, demand drafts, university certificates, cheques, traveler cheques, stamp papers, licenses, identity cards, pass ports, packaging papers &amp; labels and documents which are required to be protected from potential counterfeiting.<br>
The negotiable instruments may also include currency bills, pay-commands, passports, driving licenses, identity cards, alien residence cards, etc.<br>
In this application, the term negotiable instrument is used herein for the purposes of illustration only. The term negotiable instruments with reference   to   this   invention   also   refers   to   security   documents,<br><br>
packaging labels and all documents which are required to be protected from counterfeiting.<br>
Preferably, each negotiable instrument according to the present invention comprises a unique identification parameter.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the unique identification parameter may be a serial number printed in currency bills.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the unique identification parameter may be an image such as photograph printed in passports.<br>
Alternatively, the negotiable instruments may have any other number or plurality of images or symbols, barcode, bitmap image which uniquely identifies each negotiable instrument.<br>
If no unique identification parameter is available in the negotiable instrument, then a new unique identification parameter will be generated by a host computing device according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to the drawings Fig.1 &amp; 2 and particularly to Fig.2, there is shown a process flow diagram wherein a method of initiating a negotiable instrument is illustrated and in the embodiment shown, the following steps are performed.<br><br>
The first stage of the initiation process is the acceptance of the design of a negotiable instrument for processing by the method according to the present invention. For acceptance of the negotiable instrument for processing, the following design parameters are required to be present in the negotiable instrument.<br>
«     a predetermined space for printing a plurality of security features;<br>
(ii)    clearly printed start mark hereinafter referred to as zero co¬ordinate; and<br>
(iii)    predetermined tolerance limits for the zero co-ordinate.<br>
Only when the above parameters are present in the negotiable instrument, the negotiable instrument is accepted for processing by the method according to the present invention.<br>
In this application, zero co-ordinate refers to the beginning or starting location of which co-ordinates will be stored in the database and will be referred to as and when required.<br>
Further references of the security features will be with respect to starting location co-ordinates.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the acceptance of the negotiable instrument is done manually.<br><br>
Alternatively, acceptance may also be carried out using automated devices the use of which may be obvious to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Once the design is accepted, the accepted design pertaining to the space, position and its tolerance along with the image of the negotiable instrument is stored in a host computing device.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the zero co-ordinate and the unique identification parameter of the negotiable instrument are scanned by a scanning and printing device hereinafter referred to as S &amp; P device.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the S &amp; P device referred to herein may be operative to scan and print data on the space provided in the negotiable instrument.<br>
Other exemplary embodiments of the S &amp; P device may include individual devices for scanning and printing the implementation of which in combined form is also contemplated by this invention and which may be considered obvious to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The S &amp; P device may also have utilities and attachments such as electronic photographic camera (digital) and input and output devices which is also contemplated by this invention.<br>
After scanning of the zero co-ordinate within predetermined tolerance limits, by the S &amp; P device, the host computing device orders the S &amp; P device  to   print  the  unique  identification   parameter,   a   randomly<br><br>
generated matching parameter for unique identification parameter of every negotiable instrument and security feature with reference to the zero co-ordinate in the space identified in the negotiable instrument.<br>
A quality control check is performed wherein the host computing device orders the S &amp; P device to rescan the negotiable instrument to ascertain the correctness and quality of printing of the unique identification parameter, the randomly generated matching parameter and the security feature in the space identified on the negotiable instrument thus forming a closed loop system as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The scanned data is encrypted and sent to host computing device for decision wherein the printing operation is decided to be successful by the host computing device if the unique identification parameter, the randomly generated matching parameter and the security feature are printed to predetermined accuracy. After successful printing operation, the host computing device orders the S &amp; P device to deliver the negotiable instrument for circulation and thus the initiation process is said to be complete for the negotiable instrument as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The host computing device decides that the printing operation is unsuccessful if the unique identification parameter, the randomly generated matching parameter and the security feature are not printed to predetermined accuracy. In this case, the host computing device database is updated and the S &amp; P device re-prints the unique<br><br>
identification parameter, the randomly generated matching parameter and the security feature in a new position of which data is also updated.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, such re¬printing is allowed for a predetermined number of times. If the number of times of re-printing exceeds the limit, then the negotiable instrument is barred followed by shredding or incineration or any other predefined business rule for barring the negotiable instrument. Furthermore, the host computing device database is updated accordingly.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, initiation may be carried out to a batch of negotiable instruments.<br>
Alternatively, initiation may be carried out continuously in conjunction with the mass production line of negotiable instruments.<br>
Referring to Fig 3, in the embodiment shown and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the initiated negotiable instruments are allowed for circulation wherein the present invention proposes a method and apparatus for authentication of negotiable instruments during circulation wherein the initiated negotiable instruments bearing the unique identification parameter, the matching parameter and initial security feature are tracked in a closed loop for authenticity for every time the negotiable instrument is presented for transaction.<br><br>
The term transaction used herein in this application possesses a meaning which is particular to the type of negotiable instrument.<br>
For example, for negotiable instruments such as currency bills, the transaction represents buying or selling of goods in exchange of money at which time, authenticity of the currency bills may be required to be verified.<br>
For example, for documents such as university certificates, the transaction represents submission of the certificate for employment or registration in employment exchange at which time, the authenticity of the certificate may be required to be checked.<br>
Once the negotiable instruments start circulating, the authentication of the negotiable instruments are carried out by the method and apparatus proposed by the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the S &amp; P device is used to scan the data of the negotiable instrument after a handshaking protocol with the host computing device, encrypt the scanned data and forward the encrypted data to the host computing device.<br>
The validity of the negotiable instrument is decided by comparing the data scanned, encrypted and forwarded by the S &amp; P device with the corresponding initiated data stored in the host computing device. Once the data forwarded by the S &amp; P device matches with the initiated data,<br><br>
then the host computing device confirms the validity of the negotiable instrument and orders the S &amp; P device to append the randomly generated security feature to the negotiable instrument and the accuracy of printing of new security feature is checked. This process is called re-initiation.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, security feature may have any shape and size and may be printed using a magnetic or non-magnetic ink which may be visible or invisible but within the capability limits of scanning of S &amp; P Device.<br>
On execution of printing of security feature by the S &amp; P device, the negotiable instrument is allowed for recirculation.<br>
A new security feature is printed every time the negotiable instrument is circulated. Thus, the new security feature represents the current changed (dynamised) status of the negotiable instrument.<br>
According to the present invention, the new security feature is printed in the space allotted in the negotiable instrument.<br>
The security features may be in any form either visible or invisible which may be obvious to a person skilled in the art.<br>
New security feature are printed for a predetermined number of times on a negotiable instrument. Once the space allotted in the negotiable<br><br>
instrument gets exhausted, then the negotiable instrument is barred for further circulation.<br>
It may be obvious to a person skilled in the art to have an arrangement wherein a warning message is issued well before exhaustion of the allotted space thereby indicating the user for replacement of the negotiable instrument through authorised channels.<br>
If the host computing device decides invalidity for the negotiable instrument, then the negotiable instrument is barred for re-circulation and is subjected to predetermined appropriate action.<br>
The host computing device database is updated irrespective of whether or not the negotiable instrument is valid.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the ink used to print the security feature on the negotiable instrument is a permanent ink.<br>
The apparatus for initiation and authetication of negotiable instruments comprises a host computing device, a device for scanning and printing (S &amp; P device) connected to the host computing device via an internet line or any other means which is capable of establishing communication between the host computing device and the S &amp; P device.<br><br>
The host computing device in coordination with the S &amp; P device initiates the negotiable instruments by the method proposed by the present invention. The initiated negotiable instruments are allowed to circulate.<br>
Furthermore, while the negotiable instruments are in circulation, in order to prevent counterfeit negotiable instruments from being circulated the host computing device in co-ordination with the S &amp; P device keeps the record of the negotiable instruments by the method according to the present invention.<br>
Thus, while there have been shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the present invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the methods described may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Substitutions of elements from one described embodiment to another are also fully intended and contemplated. It is possible to introduce variations, in the whole or its parts, in the shape, materials   and   disposal,   provided   that   said   variations   do   not<br><br>
