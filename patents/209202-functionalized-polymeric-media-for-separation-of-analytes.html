TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
FUNCTIONALIZED POLYMERIC MEDL\ FOR SEPARATION OF ANALYTES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to separation of a variety of analytes that are polar, nonpolar or ionic using ftinctionalized polymeric media. The specification discloses functionalization of polymeric media and use thereof. The functionalization of polymer particles is conducted to impart desirable surface properties for separation applications such as liquid chromatography and solid phase extractions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chromatographic and solid phase extractive separation of analytes are conducted by contacting mixtures of analyte solutions with solid materials also known as bonded phases/sorbent. Adsorption/desorption (partitions) of analytes on bonded phase leads to the separation of mixtures. (Practical HPLC Method Development, L.R. Snyder, J. J. Kirkland, and LL." Glajch, John Wiley and Sons, 1997; Solid Phase Extraction for Sample Preparation, M. Zief, and R. Kisel, J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, 1988). The publications and other materials used herein to illuminate the background of the invention or provide additional details respecting the practice, are incorporated by reference, and for convenience are respectively grouped in the appended List of References. Supports are modified to impart the properties that enable separation by various mechanisms such as reversed phase and ion exchange. It is known to make reversed phase bonded phases using silica particles. Due to several drawbacks associated with silica such as instability at acidic and basic conditions, polymers are being considered. Some of the difficulties associated with crosslinked copolymer resins include swelling in the solvents and reduced mechanical strength (F. Nevejam, and M. Verzele, J. Chromatography 350:145 (1985)). Accordingly, it is often necessary to employ highly crosslinked but porous polymer particles in which adsorption sites are accessible to analytes. Necessary selectivity of nonfunctional polymer phases is achieved by varying solvents that make up the mobile phase while silica based bonded phases are modified with a combination of polar and nonpolar characteristics that provide desired selectivity.   Therefore, proper functionalized polymeric materials and<br><br>
methods to use these are needed that can lead to desired selectivity and sepfaration capability.<br>
It is well known in the prior art to use crosslinked copolymers of monovinylidene and polyvinylidene monomers to produce functionalized polymers.    For example, conversion of such polymers to ion exchange resin by sulfonation is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,366,007.  In performing these functionalizations, the polymer backbone is reacted and thus changes properties of those beads that become hydrophilic, making them susceptible to cracking or shattering.    In addition, controlled functionalization through a bulk reaction such as sulfonation is difficult.   Conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic chromatographic media is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,030,352.   These chromatographic media are obtained by applying various thin hydrophilic coatings to the surface of hydrophobic polymer substrates (e.g., polystyrene-DVB).    The process includes adsorption of solute having hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains on the substrate   by   hydrophobic-hydrophobic   interactions   with   the   hydrophilic   domain extending outwardly away from the surface.   The molecules are then crosslinked in place.  These coating materials may further be derivatized to produce various materials useful in separations.    Such coating is limited to a thin film on the surface of the hydrophobic support and thus capacity is limited. Also, hydrophobicity of the support is diminished and may not be sufficient to adsorb hydrophobic analytes.   Meitzner and Oline in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,220 disclose microreticulated copolymers formed by copolymerization  of monoethylenically unsaturated  monomers  and  polyvinylidene monomers in the presence of certain compounds to obtain a specific void volume and surface area that is used for absorbing an organic material from a fluid mixture containing organic materials.   Bouvier et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,882,521 disclose a method for removing an organic solute from a solution using a water wettable copolymer of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers having 12-30 mole percent of hydrophilic monomer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention differs substantially from the prior art as it does not involve crosslinked copolymerization of two monovinylidene and polyvinylidene monomers and functionalization of a polymer backbone.     It uses a novel approach of surface<br><br>
functionalization of preformed rigid particles using different functional monomers to produce fiinctionalized beads. Furthermore, the disclosed functionalization method significantly reduces the number of reactions and the consumption of reactants and solvents that are needed as compared with other polymer backbone functionalization methods. For example, to make a strong anion exchange medium with a quaternary amine functionality, three stage reactions (bromination or chlorination followed by amination followed by quatemization) are needed. Accordingly, by functionalization of preformed rigid particles that are homopolymers of polyvinylidene monomers, physical properties of the polymer backbone are not affected but critical properties are imparted to the surface that allow useful chromatographic and solid phase extraction separation and eliminate the disadvantages associated with the copolymers. By using the disclosed preparation, highly crosslinked preformed rigid particles prepared by polymerization of polyvinylidene monomers can be functionalized without altering the physical properties of particles (such as mechanical strength and nonswelling). The invention discloses functionalization to impart hydrophilic, cation and anion exchange properties. According to the present invention, preformed rigid porous or^ nonporous particles of highly crosslinked homopolymer of polyvinylidene compounds are functionalized using the residual vinyl groups, onto which monovinyl compounds are covalently bonded through polymerization. Accordingly, the preformed particles containing residual vinyl groups are suspended and derivatized in a solution of a monovinyl compound having desired properties such as being hydrophilic or useful as an anion or cation exchanger. As such, the present invention enables high functionalization by long chain polymerization of desired monovinyl compounds on the surface of rigid particles that have high residual vinyl groups.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, significantly different and interesting separation properties have surprisingly been found in the functionalized polymers. These properties lead to liquid chromatographic and solid phase extractive separation of polar, nonpolar and ionic analytes by adsorption and ion exchange mechanisms.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for separation of a variety of analytes that are polar, nonpolar or ionic using functionalized polymeric media. More particularly, the present invention relates to the functionalization of preformed highly crosslinked polymeric particles to impart desired properties such as hydrophilicity and anion and cation exchange capability. Furthermore, the present invention relates to liquid chromatographic and solid phase extraction separation of a variety of analytes.<br>
The preformed rigid particles that can be functionalized include porous or nonporous polymeric beads prepared by conventional processes such as suspension polymerization. The highly crosslinked polymeric beads prepared using polyvinylidene compounds such as divinylbenzene and trivinylbenzene are preferred due to their high mechanical strength and nonswelling characteristics. In addition, polymerization of divinylbenzene and its self crosslinking leads to sufficient residual vinyl (double) bonds on the surface that are used for surface functionalization using mono vinyl compounds. As such, preformed polymeric beads having a large number of residual double bonds are preferred as  they can lead to a high degree of functionalization.     Furthermore,<br><br>
microporous particles are preferred that can provide high functionality due to a large surface area and access to functional moieties.<br>
The functionalization by postpolymerization of monoethylenically unsaturated compounds (monovinyl compounds) with residual vinyl groups is carried out by free radical initiation. The monomers are selected from a class of compounds that have active moieties such as being polar or cation exchangers or anion exchangers. After polymerization, long chains of polymer containing such active moieties are attached to the surface and the long polymeric chains are extended outwardly away from the polymer bead surface. This configuration does not alter the physical or chemical properties such as mechanical strength, swelling, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the polymeric backbone of the beads. For example, by controlled postpolymerization (functionalization) with monomers containing active moieties, pockets of active sites are created in the pores along the long polymer chains but retaining hydrophobic pockets on the polymer backbone of the beads. It is found out that these properties can lead to efficient separation of polar analytes as described in the Examples.<br>
The postpolymerization conditions are chosen such that a high functionalization of microporous beads is achieved while maintaining microporosity that allows diffusion of analytes into and out of the pores to achieve the desired separation and analyte recovery.<br>
As described in the Examples, microporous polymeric beads can be prepared<br>
using conventional suspension polymerization. The residual vinyl group or unsaturation<br>
was determined by a mercury acetate titration method (Das M. N., Anal. Chem. 26:1086<br>
(1954)). Accordingly, microporous poly(divinylben2ene) beads were prepared and used<br>
to produce flinctionalized polymeric particles. Polymer beads prepared by<br>
homopolymerization of polyvinylidene compounds that have sufficient residual vinyl<br>
groups can be used. Suitable polyvinylidene compounds include divinylbenzene,<br>
trivinylbenzene, divinylpyridine, divinyltoluene, divinylnaphthalene, ethyleneglycol<br>
^    dimethylacrylate,     and    N,N-methylene-diacrylamide.	Polymer    beads     from<br>
divinylbenzene are preferred due to their high mechanical strength and residual vinyl groups. The polymer bead can have a diameter in the range of 3 to about 100 :m, preferably about 5-50 :m; pore diameter of about 60 A to 1000 A, preferably 100 A-300 A (measured by mercury porosimetry) and surface area of about 70-150 m /g (measured<br><br>
by mercury porosimetry) and surface area about 150-800 m /g (measured by nitrogen adsorption).<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a separating material for separation of various analytes. The separation material is prepared by functionalization of polymeric beads by postpolymerization of monovinyl compounds with residual vinyl groups using free radical polymerization under anaerobic conditions. Suitable free radical catalysts include benzoyl peroxide, tert-butylbenzoate, caproyl peroxide, azodiisobutyronitrile, and azodiisobutyramide.<br>
In one embodiment, the separation material is produced to impart polar properties<br>
to the polymeric beads. Suitable monovinyl compounds for functionalization include N-<br>
methyl-N-vinylacetamide,	aminostyrene,	methylacrylate,	ethylacrylate,<br>
hydroxyethylacrylate, hydroxymethylacrylate, and N-vinylcaprolactam. A preferred monovinyl compound is N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide. The polymer can be functionalized to achieve 0.5-3 mmol of N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide per gram of functionalized polymer. The preferred functionalization that provides good retention of "polar compounds is 1.0 to 2.0 mmol of N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide per gram of functionalized polymers. As illustrated in the Examples, increasing the functionalization from 0.5 mmol to 1.5 mmol increases the retention and the separation capability of polar analytes.<br>
In another embodiment, the separation material is produced to impart ionic<br>
properties to the polymeric beads so the beads can be utilized for anion and cation<br>
exchange separation of analytes. Suitable monovinyl compounds suitable for<br>
functionalization	include	N-(4-vinylbenzyl)-N,N-dimethylamine,<br>
vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride, 4-vinylbenzoic acid, styrene sulfonic acid (also called N-vinylbenzene sulfonic acid), and methacrylic acid. In addition, polymer bead postpolymerized using glycidylmethacrylate with residual vinyl groups can be further reacted with ethylenediamine, diethylamine, polyethylemeimine, hydroxypropyl sulfonic acid, hydroxylbenzene sulfonic acid or hydroxybenzoic acid to form ionic functional sites on the postpolymerized polymer to yield functional polymers.<br>
In another aspect of this invention the functionalized polymers are used for separation of analyte by liquid chromatography and solid phase extraction. The functionalized polymers are useful in a number of ways as illustrated in the Examples.<br><br>
For example, recovery of polar organic analytes such as acetaminophen, niacinamide and resorcinal is substantially higher on the functionalized polymers due to the presence of polar groups than is their recovery on the nonfunctionalized DVB polymer or on octadecyl modified silica (Cig-bonded silica). Also, the functionalized polymer is shown to have high adsorption capacity. As shown in the Examples, for nonfunctionalized DVB and Cig recovery is lower for a highly concentrated solution of acetaminophen (0.1 mg/mL) than for a less concentrated solution (0.01 mg/mL), whereas the functionalized DVB recovery remains high (quantitative) at both concentration levels. Also, it was discovered that when the functionalized polymers are packed in a liquid chromatographic column and used for separation, organic acids as well as isomers (cis and trans) of organic acids can be separated using a pure aqueous mobile phase.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that when using a functionalized polymer having ionic characteristics, analytes can be separated by a combination of ion exchange and reversed phase mechanisms. As such, a better separation of ionic and hydrophobic analyte can be achieved. As illustrated in the Examples, an acidic analyte such as sulindac that possesses a carboxylic acid group is retained on an ionic functionalized polymer as well as on other polymers (nonionic and nonfunctionalized) and Cig. However, the analyte is washed from the nonionic materials with the first methanol wash, while no analyte was washed from an ionic functionalized polymer with the first methanol wash. After washing with an acid such as 1 N hydrochloric acid followed by methanol (acidified), the analyte was recovered quantitatively. This provides a very effective method for separation of acidic analytes from hydrophobic analytes.<br>
The present invention is further detailed in the following Examples, which are offered by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Standard techniques well known in the art or the techniques specifically described below are utilized.<br>

)	overnight at 80EC.  The product was filtered on dynel cloth, washed 2X with 200 mL<br>
deionized water, and one time with 200 mL of methanol.    The product was dried<br><br>
overnight in a vacuum oven at 80EC. Cation exchange capacity was 0.9 meq/g. FT-IR of the polymer product showed an acid carbonyl peak at 1750 cm'^<br>
Example 14 The retention efficiencies of polar, water soluble analytes were determined using a small HPLC column (4.6 X 50 mm) packed with approximately 0.25-0.30 g of DVB or functionalized DVB polymers. First the column was washed with 5 mL methanol followed by 10 mL of deionized water. Then 200 :L of acetaminophen solution (1.0 mg/mL in water) was injected and the chromatographic run was continued using water for 55 minutes. At 55 minutes the mobile phase was changed to methanol. Retention efficiency was determined from peak area prior to 55 minutes (when pure water is run) and after 55 minutes (when pure methanol is used for elution). Results are shown in Figures 1-6. The functionalized DVB (Example 5) shows high retention of acetaminophen as acetaminophen did not leach during the water wash but eluted after 55 minutes with methanol. As shown in Figure 1, with nonfunctionalized DVB most of the acetaminophen was leached with water, and showed poor retention. By increasing the ftinctionalization level of N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide (%N from 0.7-2.0) acetaminophen is retained and recovered quantitatively (Figures 1-5). Similar retention behavior was observed with aminostyrene ftinctionalized polymers (Figure 6).<br>
Example 15 Recovery of analytes by solid phase extraction (SPE) with functionalized polymer was determined using SPE columns (1 mL) packed with 20 mg of DVB or ftinctionalized DVB (from Example 5) that retains/absorbs analyte by a reversed phase mechanism. These columns were used for extraction and recovery of various analytes from dilute solutions. The SPE columns were placed on a positive pressure processor (the device forces liquid to go through the column by using pressurized air or nitrogen). . The SPE column was conditioned by passing 1 mL methanol followed by 1 mL of deionized water. Then 1 mL of analyte feed solution (0.01-0.1 mg/mL) in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 5.0-8.0) was passed through the column at a flow rate of 2-3 mL/minute. After washing the column with 1 mL of deionized water, analyte was eluted from the column with methanol (500 :L).  The concentration of analyte in the starting<br><br>
feed solution and in the eluted solution was determinea oy nign perionnaiiuc nquiu chromatography and was used to compute recovery of analyte. The results are summarized in Table 1. The results show that functionalized DVB showed a high recovery of polar analytes. Also, by increasing the acetaminophen concentration from 0.01-0.1 mg/mL, no loss in acetaminophen was observed indicating a high adsorption capacity.<br><br><br><br>
Example 16 Separation efficiency of organic acids was evaluated by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) using DVB and flinctionalized DVB (Example 5) packed columns (4,6 X 150 mm). Columns were slurry packed (3,8 g in 22 mL chloroform-isopropanol, 85:15 mixture) at 4500 psi. Potassium phosphate, pH 3.0 buffer (20 mM) - was used as a mobile phase, A 60 :L mixture of tartaric acid, malonic acid and succinic acid containing 10 :g, 25 :g, and 375 :g respectively was injected and chromatographic peaks were recorded at 210 nm. Similar injections of individual components of the mixture were made to determine retention times of each of the components.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 7, the retention times of tartaric acid, malonic acid, and succinic acid are 1.8, 2.6, and 10.2 minutes, respectively. The results show poor separation of tartaric acid and malonic acid with nonfiinctionalized DVB. Functional ization with N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide onto the surface of the polymer resulted in an improved separation medium as the separation efficiency of all three components improved significantly (Figure 8). Also, retention time of all three components increased significantly. The separation can be attributed to branching of long chain N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide containing polar amide moieties that is extended away from the polar surface. It was also discovered that a functionalized DVB (Example 5) can separate cis-trans acids. A mixture of the cis form of 1,2-ethylenedicarboxylic acid (maleic acid) and the trans form of 1,2-ethylenedicarboxylic acid (fumaric acid) was separated with flinctionalized DVB using 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 3.0 buffer as a mobile phase (Figure 9), whereas both components co-eluted with nonfiinctionalized DVB (Figure 10).<br>
Example 17<br>
Recovery of analytes by solid phase extraction (SPE) with flinctionalized polymer was determined using SPE columns (1 mL) packed with 20 mg DVB or a strong anion exchange (quat) fiznctionalized DVB (from Example 11) that retained analyte by ionic interaction and also by a reversed phase mechanism. It was demonstrated that acidic analyte can be separated by mixed interactions. The SPE columns were placed on a positive pressure processor. The SPE columns were conditioned by passing 1 mL methanol, followed by 0.1 N NaOH, and 1 mL of deionized water. Then 1 mL of acidic analyte feed solution (0.05 mg/mL) in 0.01 N NaOH was passed through the column at a flow rate of 2-3 mL/minute. First the column was washed with 1 mL methanol to remove other hydrophobic analytes while the acidic analyte was retained on the column. Then the column was washed with 1 N HCl to convert the ionic analyte to an acid form and to disturb ionic interactions whereby the acidic analyte was retained by a reversed phase mechanism. Finally, the acidic analyte was eluted with 1 mL acidified methanol (90:10, methanol: IN HCl). The concentrations of acidic analyte in the first methanol wash and the final methanol eluate were determined by HPLC to calculate the recoveries (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, functionalized DVB (Example 11) that has anion exchange sites retains the acidic analyte by an ionic as well as a reverse phase<br><br>
mechanism. Thus, analyte is not washed off with the first methanol wash but is eluted with the final acidified methanol when no ionic interaction exists. For functionalized DVB (Example 5), nonfunctionalized DVB and Cig, analyte is washed off with the first methanol wash and shows no separation capability of acidic and hydrophobic analytes. Similarly, recovery of salicylic acid with functionalized DVB (Example 5), nonfunctionalized DVB and Cig is very poor as salicylic acid is not retained on the columns.<br><br><br><br>
