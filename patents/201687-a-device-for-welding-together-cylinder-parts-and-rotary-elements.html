				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for welding together cylindrical parts and rotary elements, comprising an electrode shaft, positioning and fastening means for the elements to be welded together and a hollow shaft surrounding the electrode shaft.<br>
When cylindrical workpieces are welded, the contact surfaces generally have one of two types of shape. With cylindrical parts cut perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis, the ends meet and the abutting surface forms a circle. With this type of attachment by welding, a rotary friction welding process is involved, which is easily mechanized. When the cylinders meet at an angle, however, the abutting surface forms a geometrical shape which is dependent on the diameters of the cylinders and the angle at which the centrelines of the cylinders meet.<br>
When there are several such cylinders branching off from a main cylinder, as in the case of pipe manifolds, and especially if they are close together, conventional welding from the outside becomes difficult. Such arrangements may be found, for example, in multiway valves, filter bodies, pipe junctions and similar components. When pipe junctions are welded, especially T-junctions, the limited height of the rabbet in the base cylinder and the size of conventional welding nozzles cause frequent problems.<br>
The above mentioned problems can be eliminated by approaching the welding position from the inside of the junction cylinder. Then the limited height of the rabbet or a second junction in the<br>
2<br><br>
vicinity on  the  outside  no  longer constitute obstacles.     The welding nozzle  is  at  the height  of the  seam,   while the   workpiece (or the  welding nozzle)   turns  around  its  own  axis.<br>
A second  area of problems  is constituted by long workpieces, whose  rotation  cannot  be   simply provided.     A typical  example of  this  is   if  distribution chambers  are to  be made  from a  pipe, wherein several pipe  junctions  are  attached to a long pipe.<br>
The  coaxial  alignment  of the  cylinders  in  respect  to  each other is  of  extreme  importance.     To  assure the  quality  of  the weld  seam,   it  is  necessary to  protect  the  workpieces to  be  welded together  from the oxygen  in the  air by enclosing  the workpieces in a chamber filled with  a protective gas.     In order to  minimize the  amount of  the protective gas  and the  fill  time,   the chamber must  be  as  small  as possible.     However,   the  small  size  of  the chamber in  turn  causes problems  when  inserting  the workpiece in the holder located  in  the  chamber.     Because  of  the   small   size of  the   chamber  it  is not  possible to  simultaneously work with one' s hands  in the chamber  and  to look  into  the chamber.<br>
The  object of the   invention  is based on  providing  a device by means of  which the  above  described problems  can be   removed and the consumption of  protective gas  in particular can be   reduced, even  if  the  size of  the workpieces to  be   welded together varies.<br>
This  object  is attained by means of   the characteristics<br>
recited in the following eat  claim  1.     Advantageous  embodiments<br>
of  the   invention are  recited  in the dependent claims.<br>
An  exemplary embodiment  of   the  invention will  be explained<br><br>
in greater detail  in  what  follows,    with reference  to  the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
-   3  -<br><br>
Fig. 1 represents a device in accordance with the invention viewed from the side, wherein the portion above the centerline is shown in longitudinal section.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in greater detail an example of the protective chamber as provided in a device in accordance with Fig. 1, and of the fastening cassette housed in the protective chamber and intended for the workpieces to be welded together, and<br>
Fig.3 schematically represents a combination of the protective chamber and the fastening cassette corresponding to Fig. 2, viewed from the front, i.e. in the axial direction of the device.<br>
Part of the device represented in Fig. 1 is a pipe shaft 8 which is seated rotatably in respect to the frame 12 in bearings 10.  The support shaft 1 of the welding electrode 2 is a long shaft, which extends through the pipe shaft 8 concentrically in respect to the pipe shaft 8.  An insulation material pipe 9, which is used as the bearing between these elements, is provided between the electrode shaft 1 and the pipe shaft 8.  Thus, the electrode shaft 1 and the pipe shaft 8 are rotatable in respect to each other, and the electrode shaft 1 can moreover be moved in the axial direction.<br>
The pipe shaft 8 is surrounded by a sleeve elements 6, which turns along with it, in which protective gas channels 7 are formed and which terminates at a widening forming a connecting head 4.  The sleeve 6 extends over only a portion of the length of the pipe shaft 8.  Next to the connecting head 4, the sleeve 6 is enclosed by a non rotatable frame sleeve 11 with the function of a structural housing which is fastened on the frame 12 to<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
prevent  the  rotation of  the   latter.     This   frame   sleeve   11 with  the function of  a structural housing has  the  required connectors  for the protective gas,   the cooling gas  and the compressed  air required for the closing cylinder of the  protective chamber  3.     Rotatable connectors for providing  the required gas connections  to the channels  7 provided  in  the  sleeve 6   and  which end at  the connecting head 4  are  located between the sleeves 6 and  11.     Only one  channel   7   is  represented  in Pig.   1,   but   there are of  course  several  of  these,   which  are  suitably distributed on the  circumference of  the   sleeve 11   and of  the connecting head  4.<br>
A threaded bushing  5  with  an  interior thread  is  provided on the connecting head  4,   to which   the protective chamber  3 can be  connected by means  of   a threaded connector.     The  positioning and  fastening means  inform of  fastening  cassette  31  for the parts A, B  to  be welded together are  fastened on the  threaded bushing  5   of  the connecting head  4.     This   is  only schematically indicated  in Fig.l.     An  exemplary embodiment   is   shown more detailed  in  Fig.   2,   wherein the bottom  section  32 of the  protective chamber  3  is provided with   a projecting  neck  38,   which is surrounded by a threaded  sleeve   37,   by means  of  which  the  chamber 3 can be fastened on the threaded bushing 5.     The upper section 33 of  the chamber  3 can  be  closed by means of   the rod  35  of the piston of  a cylinder  34.     The  upper  section  33  is guided on vertical  guides 48,   whose  upper ends  are  fastened on the cylinder  34.     By means  of   seals   36   it is   assured that   the closed  chamber  3  is tight.<br>
-   5   -<br><br>
The    fastening<br>
cassette   31  intended for  the  workpieces to  be  welded together  is pushed into  the chamber  3,   guided by guides   39  located on the bottom of  the  chamber.     The   guides  39  extend parallel  with  the axial  direction of  the  electrode  shaft   1,   wherein the  cassette slides  in  the  axial  direction  of  the electrode   shaft  into   its intended position.     Grooves  40  for the  guides  39  are  formed at the edges  of the  bottom of   the positioning  and fastening means inform of  fastening cassette  31.     The workpieces to be welded together  are  correctly positioned in  respect  to  the welding electrode   2.     A stop  41,   which   can be  fixed in place  or axially adjustable,   is provided  at  the end of the  guides  39  for the axial positioning taking  place in  the  axial  direction.     A  spring loaded pressure  element  50   is  arranged on the ceilling of  the chamber which,   when the upper  section of  the  chamber has  been lowered,   meets  the  rear  edge of  the positioning and fastening means  inform of  fastening  cassette  31,   its upper  and  rear  side, keeping the  positioning and  fastening means   inform of fastening cassette  31  fixed  in  its place.<br>
In   the case  represented,   arms  42,   which  can be pivoted around  a hinge   shaft with   an  axle  43,   are   a part of  the  positioning and fastening means inform of  fastening cassette  31,   which arms have  a spring loaded  arresting element  45   at their ends,   which grasps the  cassette behind the  upper  edge  of  its  front   46.   Sleeves 44  project  from the arresting   element   45,   which sleeves  contain springs  which have been pressed between the  bottom of the  sleeve 44  and  the ends of the  arms   42.     If the  arresting  element  45  in<br>
-  6   -<br><br>
Fig.2 is pulled to the right against the force of the springs, the arms 42 can be pivoted upward around the hinge shaft with an axle 43.<br>
The workpieces to be welded are placed into the cassette 31 while it is outside of the chamber 3. There are typically two cassettes 31 per chamber 3 so that, while a first cassette 31 is in the chamber 3, the other cassette 31 can be filled with parts to be welded. A regulating screw 47 determines the position of the parts, and the downward pivoted arms 42 arrest the parts to be welded in place. Since the protective chamber 3, as well as the fastening cassette 31, can be interchanged, their dimensions can be reduced to a minimum for the respective workpiece size, which reduces the protective gas consumption to a minimum.<br>
The drive mechanism 19 drives a driving wheel 15, which Can be arrested with the control spindles 14 and 17 in such a way that it selectively rotates either a driving wheel 13 acting on the hollow shaft 8, or a drive wheel 16 rotatably seated on the hollow shaft 8, which grips the electrode shaft 1 via an insulation material flange 19. If one of the driving wheels 13 and 16 is activated, the other remains unrotatably arrested on the frame 12' . In the illustrated case, the control spindle 14 switches the rotary drive to the hollow shaft 8 and arrests the<br>
-  7  -<br><br><br>
electrode shaft 1 so it cannot be rotated.  In this case the connecting head 4 and the chamber 3 with the fastening cassette fastened on it rotate together with the pipe shaft 8.  The parts A, B to be welded together rotate in respect to the welding electrode 2.  Since the gas connections have been attached to the rotatable connecting head 4, they can be connected by means of hoses 53 to the chamber 3, as represented in Fig. 2.<br>
If a geometric shape formed by two cylinders is welded, the welding electrode 2 must follow the curved shape of the connecting, place.  This is achieved by means of a threaded shaft 30, driven by a motor 29, which displaces a horizontal guide 28, 			which in turn displaces the aggregation constituted by a cylinder<br>
25 and an arm 26.  The arm 26 adheres to the electrode shaft 1,<br>
whose long rapid movement can be produced by means of the<br>
cylinder 25, which moves the arm 26 and a horizontal guide 27<br>
			in respect to the horizontal guide 28.  The purpose of the rapid<br>
movement is to move the electrode 2 into the working position<br>
and away from it, while the precision movement of following the<br>
curved shape of the connecting place taking place during welding<br>
is produced by means of the motor 29.  The precision displacement<br>
motor 29 is program controlled to perform its displacement movement<br>
as a function of the rotating movement of the pipe shaft 8.<br>
The welding current is brought to the welding spot from<br>
a current source 22, which is connected to a slide ring 21<br>
fastened on the shaft 1 by means of an electric cable.  The<br>
ground cable is connected to a slide ring 24, which is located<br>
on a flange 23.  An electrical connection 49 exists from the<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
flange   23  to the protective  chamber  3  and  on to  the fastening cassette   32  fastened therein.     The insulating bearing  sleeve  9 and the  insulating flange   18  assure  that   the voltage  applied to the  shaft  1   is  not transmitted to  other parts  of  the   device. The  invention  is not   limited to  the   above  examplary embodiment.     In particular,   the  construction and  shaping  of the protective chamber  3  and  of  the  positioning and fastening means  inform of   fastening cassette  31  connected therewith   can vary in many ways.     It   is  essential that   both  are   fastened by means  of. the  same  gripper elements  5  to the  connecting head  4, wherein they  are together   interchangeable   with   such  chambers and positioning and fastening  means which   are matched  in shape and  size  to  the   respective pipe   elements which are to be  welded together.<br>
