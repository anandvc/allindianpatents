COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A DISPENSING SYSTEM"<br>
SEAQUIST CLOSURES FOREIGN, INC., a Delaware corporation of 475 West Terra Cotta, Crystal Lake, Illinois 60014, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a system for dispensing a product from a container.   The system is especially suitable for use as part of, or as a dispensing closure for, a flexible container which is squeezable. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS POSED BY THE PRIOR ART<br>
There are a wide variety of packages which include (1) a squeezable container, (2) a dispensing system extending as a unitary part of, or attachment to, the container, and (3) a product contained within the container.   One type of such a package employs a single dispensing valve for discharging a single stream of product (which may be a liquid, cream, or particulate product).   See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,839,614.   The package includes a flexible, resilient, slit-type valve.   The valve is normally closed and can withstand the weight of the product when the container is completely inverted, so that the product will not leak out unless the container is squeezed.<br>
With some types of products, such as glue, hair coloring, condiments, and the like, it may be desirable to provide a dispensing system which can more accurately control the discharge of the product.   In particular, it may be desirable to more precisely control the location of the deposit of the product and to provide a dispensing system for affording such control while at the same time permitting the user to clearly observe the product deposition location.  It would also be advantageous if such an improved dispensing system could also more accurately control the direction in which the product is dispensed while at the same time providing a clear indication to the user as to the specific direction in which the product will be, or is being, dispensed.<br><br><br>
Although a relatively long, narrow, tapered nozzle might be employed to facilitate the dispensing of a product in a way that would enable the user to more accurately control the product dispensing location and product dispensing direction, the use of such a long nozzle can create other problems Specifically, the product within a long nozzle may continue to flow from the nozzle even after the desired amount of product has been dispensed.<br>
For example, consider the situation when a relatively high viscosity product is being dispensed from an inverted, squeezable container through a relatively long nozzle.  The long nozzle must be initially filled with fluid product as the container is inverted.  The user, after inverting the container, is unable to tell exactly when the product will be discharged from the tip of the nozzle.  With a relatively high viscosity product, the user will have to squeeze the container somewhat just to fill the nozzle, and the user thus cannot be sure when the nozzle has been filled and when the first drop of product will be discharging from the nozzle.<br>
Further, when the user sees that the desired amount of product has been dispensed from the tip of the nozzle and deposited on the receiving surface, the user would typically stop squeezing the container.   However, the amount of product within the nozzle may continue to flow out of the nozzle before the user can invert the container or otherwise move the system away from the dispensing location.  Thus, such a system lacks the desired capability to precisely control the termination of the product flow from the nozzle.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved dispensing system which could overcome, or at least minimize, the above-described product dispensing control problems.<br>
It would also be desirable to provide an internal system for positively preventing flow of the product through the system regardless of the orientation of the container and regardless of whether or not the container was being squeezed or otherwise pressurized.   Such an internal seal system<br><br>
should be easily actuatable to open the flow path when desired to accommodate the dispensing of the product and should be readily actuatable to close the flow path when desired so as to prevent inadvertent leakage of the product when the container is being shipped or stored where it might be subjected to external impact forces which could increase the pressure within the container or otherwise cause discharge of some amount of the product.<br>
It would also be beneficial if an improved dispensing system could function without the need for a hinged lid which would have to be initially moved to an open position to permit dispensing and which, in the open position, could obscure a portion of the product dispensing stream or product discharge location from the user's view.   It would also be desirable if such an improved dispensing system would not employ any other type of separate lid, overcap, or plug which would require removal prior to dispensing and which could become lost or misplaced.<br>
It would also be advantageous if such an improved system could accommodate bottles, containers, or packages which have a variety of shapes and that are constructed from a variety of materials.<br>
Further, it would be desirable if such an improved system could accommodate efficient, high-quality, large-volume manufacturing techniques with a reduced product reject rate to produce a system with consistent operating characteristics.<br>
The present invention provides an improved dispensing system which can accommodate designs having the above-discussed benefits and features. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a system for dispensing a product from a container in a way that can be better controlled by the user.   The system can accommodate the discharge of liquids, creams, or particulate matter, including powders.   The user can more easily ascertain the location where the product will be deposited.  The user can readily control the direction of<br><br>
product flow.  Further, the starting and stopping of the product flow can be more precisely controlled.<br>
The dispensing system is adapted for use in dispensing a product from a container having an opening.  The dispensing system may be formed as a unitary part of an end of such a container, or the system may be a separate assembly that is permanently or releasably attached to the container.<br>
The dispensing system includes a spout for communicating with the container opening.  The dispensing system defines (1) at least one aperture, (2) a distal seal surface located distally of the discharge aperture, and (3) a proximal seal surface located on the exterior of the spout proximally of the discharge aperture.<br>
The dispensing system includes a nozzle assembly which is mounted on the spout.  The nozzle assembly is movable along the spout between a retracted, closed position, and an extended, open position.   The nozzle assembly includes a nozzle having (1) a dispensing passage around at least a portion of the spout, (2) a proximal seal surface for sealingly engaging the spout proximal seal surface, and (3) a distal seal surface located outwardly of the nozzle proximal seal surface for sealingly engaging the spout distal seal surface when the nozzle assembly is in the retracted, closed position.<br>
The nozzle assembly also includes a resiliently flexible valve.   The valve is sealingly disposed across the nozzle dispensing passage at a location distally of the spout distal seal surface.  The valve has an initially closed dispensing orifice which opens in response to a pressure differential acting across the valve.<br>
A presently preferred form of the dispensing system has the valve mounted adjacent the distal tip of the nozzle.  Preferably, the valve is self-sealing and is biased to close when the pressure differential across the open valve drops below a predetermined amount.  Alternatively, the dispensing system can employ a valve which, once opened, remains opened even if the pressure differential across the valve drops to zero.  Further, the dispensing<br><br>
structure of the present invention can accommodate different types of valves, as well as different sizes of valves.<br>
Numerous other advantages and features of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention, from the claims, and from the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, this specification and the accompanying drawings disclose only some specific forms as examples of the invention.   The invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments so described, however.   The scope of the invention is pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
For ease of description, most of the figures illustrating the invention show the dispensing system in the typical orientation that it would have at the top of a container when the container is stored upright on its base, and terms such as upper, lower, horizontal, etc., are used with reference to this position.  It will be understood, however, that the dispensing system of this invention may be manufactured, stored, transported, used, and sold in an orientation other than the position described.<br>
The dispensing system of this invention is suitable for use with a variety of conventional or special containers having various designs, the<br><br><br>
details of which, although not illustrated or described, would be apparent to those having skill in the art and an understanding of such containers.   The container per se forms no part of the present invention.<br>
The first embodiment of the dispensing system of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1-11 in the form of a dispensing closure 30 for a container (not illustrated).  As can be seen in FIG. 6, the closure 30 has a body 32 which includes a hollow, generally cylindrical base or skirt 34, an annular shoulder 36 extending radially inwardly from the top of the skirt 34, and a reduced diameter spout 38 extending upwardly from the inner portion of the shoulder 36.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 6, the interior of the skirt 34 defines an internal, female thread 40.   The skirt 34 is adapted to receive the upper end of a container mouth or neck (not illustrated).   The skirt thread 40 is adapted to matingly engage a thread on the container mouth or neck.<br>
Alternatively, the closure skirt 34 could be provided with some other container connecting means, such as a snap-fit bead or groove (not illustrated) in place of the thread 40 for engaging a mating groove or bead (not illustrated), respectively, in the container neck.   The closure body 32 could also be permanently fixed to the container by means of induction melting, ultrasonic melting, gluing, or the like, depending on the materials used for the closure body 32 and the container.   The closure body 32 could also be formed as a unitary part, or extension, of the container.<br>
The closure body skirt 34 may have any suitable configuration.   The container could have an upwardly projecting neck or other portion for being received within the particular configuration of the closure body 32, and the main part of the container may have a different cross-sectional shape than the container neck and closure body skirt 34.<br>
The closure 30 is adapted to be used with a container having a mouth or other opening to provide access to the container interior and to a product contained therein.   The product may be, for example, a liquid comestible<br><br>
product.  The product could also be any other liquid, solid, or gaseous material, including, but not limited to, a powder, a cream, a food product, a personal care product, an industrial or household cleaning product, or other chemical compositions (e.g., compositions for use in activities involving manufacturing, commercial or household maintenance, construction, agriculture, etc.).<br>
The container would typically be a squeezable container having a flexible wall or walls which can be grasped by the user and squeezed or compressed to increase the internal pressure within the container so as to force the product out of the container and through the closure 30.  The container wall typically has sufficient, inherent resiliency so that when the squeezing forces are removed, the container wall returns to its normal, unstressed shape.   Such a squeezable wall structure is preferred in many applications but may not be necessary or preferred in other applications.   For example, in some applications it may be desirable to employ a generally rigid container and to pressurize the container interior at selected times with a piston or other pressurizing system.<br>
An annular, "crab's claw" seal 42 projects downwardly from the underside of the body shoulder 36 as can be seen in FIGS. 4 and 6.   The seal 42 is adapted to sealingly engage the upper, annular edge of the container (not illustrated) on which the closure 30 is mounted.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the spout 38 has a generally circular, transverse cross section everywhere along its length, and the diameter of the base 34 is greater than the largest diameter of the spout 38.   The spout 38 has an internal discharge passage 44 (FIG. 6) for communicating with the container interior.   The spout 38 also has a distal end that includes at least one discharge aperture 46 (FIGS. 5 and 6) that opens externally from the spout discharge passage 44.  Preferably, there are three such apertures 46 with a strut 48 between each pair of adjacent apertures 46.  Three such struts 48 which are arranged equidistantly around the end of the spout 38.  The<br><br>
distal ends of each strut 48 support a disk 50 (FIGS. 5 and 6) located distally of the three apertures 46.   The disk 50 has an arcuate, peripheral, distal edge 52 which merges with a generally cylindrical, peripheral surface 54 which functions as a distal seal surface located distally of the discharge apertures 46.   The size, shape, and number of apertures 46 and struts 48 may vary.   The profile of the disk surfaces 52 and 54 may vary.<br>
The spout 38 also has an exterior, proximal seal surface 56 (FIG. 6) located proximally of the discharge apertures 46.  The proximal seal surface 56 is preferably cylindrical.  The upper end of the proximal seal surface 56 terminates at the discharge apertures 46 in an annular bead 57 (FIG. 6).<br>
Below the seal surface 56 is an external, male thread 58 (FIG. 6 around the base of the spout 38.  Multiple lead threads may be employed.  A cam surface could also be employed in place of a thread per se.<br>
The dispensing closure body 32 is preferably molded from a thermoplastic material such as polypropylene to form a generally rigid, hard, plastic structure.  The particular material from which the body 32 is molded forms no part of the present invention.<br>
The dispensing closure 30 also includes a nozzle assembly, which in the first embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, comprises a twist tip or nozzle 60, a valve 70, and a retention cap 80.   The nozzle 60 is adapted to be mounted on the spout 38.  The nozzle 60 includes an internal, female thread 84 (FIG. 6) for engaging the spout thread 58.  If the spout 38 employs a cam instead of the thread 58 per se. then the nozzle 60 would have a suitable cam follower.<br>
The inside of the nozzle 60 defines an internal dispensing passage 86 (FIG. 6) which is adapted to receive, and extend around, at least a portion of the spout 38 as shown in FIG. 4.   The nozzle 60 can be rotated in threaded engagement on the spout 38 to effect axial movement of the nozzle 60 along the spout 38 between a lowered or retracted, closed position (FIGS. 1, 2, and 4) and an elevated or extended, open position (FIGS. 7-9).<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 6, the dispensing passage 86 of the nozzle 60 has a larger diameter lower portion 88 containing the thread 84.  The nozzle 60 has a reduced diameter intermediate portion defining a proximal seal surface 90.  At the bottom of the nozzle proximal seal surface 90 is an annular bead 92 (FIG. 6.<br>
The upper end of the nozzle 60 preferably has a further reduced diameter upper portion defining a generally cylindrical distal seal surface 96 (FIG. 6) located outwardly of the nozzle proximal seal surface 90.  The nozzle distal seal surface 96 and nozzle proximal seal surface 90 together define at least part of the nozzle dispensing passage 86.<br>
The nozzle 60 terminates at its upper, distal end in a dispensing opening 98 (FIG. 6).  The nozzle 60 defines an annular seat 100 (FIG. 6) around the nozzle dispensing opening.   The external surface of the nozzle 60 includes an annular bead 102 (FIG. 6) adjacent the seat 100.<br>
In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the valve 70 has the configuration and operating characteristics of a commercially available valve design substantially as disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 5,676,289 with reference to the valve 46 disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 5,676,289.   The operation of such a type of valve is further described with reference to the similar valve that is designated by reference number 3d in the U.S. Patent No. 5,409,144.   The descriptions of those two patents are incorporated herein by reference thereto to the extent pertinent and to the extent not inconsistent herewith.<br>
The valve 70 is flexible and changes configuration between (1) a closed, rest position (shown in an upright package in FIG. 9 and shown in an inverted package in FIG. 10) and (2) an active, open position (shown in an inverted package in FIG. 11).  The valve 70 includes a flexible, central portion, face, or head portion 130 (FIG. 10) which has an unactuated, concave configuration (when viewed from the exterior) and has two, mutually perpendicular, intersecting, dispensing slits 132 of equal length which<br><br>
together define a closed dispensing orifice.  The intersecting slits 132 define four, generally sector-shaped, flaps or petals in the concave, central, head portion 130.   The flaps open outwardly from the intersection point of the slits 132, in response to increasing container pressure of sufficient magnitude, in the well-known manner described in the U.S. Patent No. 5,409,144.<br>
The valve 70 includes a skirt or sleeve 134 which extends from the valve central wall or head portion 130.   At the outer end of the sleeve 134, there is a thin, annular flange 138 which extends peripherally from the sleeve 134 in a reverse angled orientation.  The thin flange 138 merges with an enlarged, much thicker, peripheral flange 140 which has a generally dovetail-shaped, transverse cross section (as viewed in FIG. 10).<br>
To accommodate the seating of the valve 70 in the nozzle 60, the frustoconical configuration of the nozzle annular seat 100 has the same angle as the angle of the adjacent surface of the valve flange dovetail configuration.<br>
The other (outer) surface of the valve flange 140 is clamped by the retention cap 80 (FIGS. 9 and 10).   The retention cap 80 defines a central opening 150 (FIGS. 6 and 10) surrounded by an annular clamping surface 152 (FIGS. 6 and 10) for engaging the outer surface of the valve flange 140 at an angle which matches the angle of the outer surface of the valve flange dovetail configuration (FIG. 6).<br>
The retention cap 80 includes a skirt 156 (FIG. 6), the lower portion of which has an inwardly projecting bead 158 (FIG. 6) for snap-fit engagement with the bead 102 of the nozzle 60 (FIGS. 4 and 6) to clamp the valve 70 tightly in the nozzle assembly.   This arrangement securely clamps and holds the valve 70 without requiring special internal support structures or bearing members adjacent the interior surface of the valve cylindrical sleeve 134.   This permits the region adjacent the interior surface of the valve cylindrical sleeve 134 to be substantially open, free, and clear so as to accommodate movement of the valve sleeve 134 as described hereinafter.<br><br>
damage and/or to keep out dust and dirt.   Such a lid may be hinged to the nozzle assembly with a conventional or special snap-action hinge, or the lid may simply be tethered to the nozzle assembly.   The lid may also include an inwardly extending plug or member for being received in the concave region of the valve 70 as a means for further sealing the valve 70 during shipping and handling when the package could be subjected to exterior forces that could cause internal, transient pressure increases that might otherwise open the valve.<br>
In still another contemplated modification, a releasable liner or removable label (not illustrated) could be initially attached across the top of the nozzle assembly.  After such a removable liner has been removed by the user, it could be saved by the user and later re-applied to the top of the closure (e.g.,  when the user subsequently wants to stow the package in luggage while traveling).  This would prevent damage to the valve and/or prevent ingress of dust and dirt.<br>
It will be readily apparent from the foregoing detailed description of the invention and from the illustrations thereof that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts or principles of this invention.<br>
