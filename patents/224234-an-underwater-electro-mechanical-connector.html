				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an inter-module underwater electro-mechanical<br>
connector for applications like towed array sonar, towed bodies, static underwater<br>
systems, underwater remotely operated vehicles, oil exploration and seismic systems.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Underwater electrical connectors are used in both static and dynamic systems for<br>
signal data as well as power transmission. Electro-mechanical connectors are electrical<br>
connectors which can withstand axial loads also. Since the connectors have to operate at<br>
different depths in the ocean, they have to withstand external hydrostatic pressure. In<br>
towed array sonar application, these are used to terminate fluid filled modules wherein<br>
the connector back shells have to withstand the same external pressure transmitted<br>
through the fill fluid.<br>
One of the electro-mechanical connector known in art, as per US patent no.<br>
4880390, is a pressure-compensated inter-module towed array connector, which<br>
comprises a pair of headers or coupling halves which couple a pair of module hoses<br>
together, wherein the hoses house the electrical and other conductors and also contain an<br>
insulating fill fluid. The electrical conductors terminate in connectors which interface at<br>
their mating faces.<br>
A disadvantage of the above connector is that there is always a loss of fill fluid<br>
through the contact face, each time the mating / de mating process is carried out, which<br>
necessitates refilling of fluid, each time the connector is assembled and also wetting of<br>
the surface due to loss of fluid makes the assembly inconvenient to handle.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above connector is that complete filling of the fluid<br>
at the mating surface is not possible due to inherent fluid filling design problems due to<br>
which there is a pressure differential which in turn reduces the reliability of the<br>
connector.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above connector is that during deployment of the<br>
connector for underwater applications in ocean, large temperature variations across the<br>
depth of the ocean result in variations in the volume of the fill fluid getting filled inside<br>
the connector at different depths, which creates a differential pressure which in turn<br>
reduces the reliability of the connector.<br>
Another connector known in the prior art, as per US patent no. 4346954,<br>
comprises of male and female sections wherein each connector section includes a light<br>
weight bulk head member which is sealed. One of the bulk head member includes a pair<br>
of miniature check valves which are oppositely directed and the other includes a fill port<br>
for filling fluid so that the external pressure is balanced by the internal pressure.<br>
A disadvantage of the above connector is that the check valves malfunction<br>
resulting in differential pressure at the contact surface which adversely affects the<br>
reliability of the connector.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above connector is that loss of fill fluid takes place<br>
through the contact face, each time the mating / de mating process is carried out which<br>
necessitates refilling of the fluid and also wetting of the connector due to fluid loss makes<br>
the connector inconvenient to handle.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above connector is that complete filling of the<br>
fluid at the mating surface is not possible due to inherent fluid filling design problems<br>
due to which there is a pressure differential which in turn reduces the reliability of the<br>
connector.<br>
The disadvantage of the above connector is that the axial load transfer is member to which are attached a plurality of high strength ropes which connected to unequal loading, cause premature failure of the connector.<br>
Connector known in the prior art, as per US patent 3,997,230, the surfaces of the coupling members at the outside ends, have a plurality of when adjacent sections are joined, these conductor tracks are pressed a result of the forces exerted by flexible plastic spacers which about shoulders of the coupling members and the connector, urging the<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an underwater electro-mechanical connector with streamlined exterior profile for reduced flow noise generation.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an underwater electro-mechanical connector which is self aligning.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an underwater electro-mechanical connector which has built-in polarization.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an underwater electro-mechanical connector with an improved performance reliability.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an underwater electro mechanical connector comprising of a plug shell assembly coupled to a receptacle shell assembly by a coupling ring, said plug shell assembly comprising a plug shell characterised in that is housing pin contact insert assembly and secured to plug back shell and the receptacle shell assembly comprising a receptacle shell housing a socket contact insert assembly and secured to a receptacle back shell and wherein both the plug and receptacle shell assemblies have back shell interfaces for termination of tensile load carrying members and wherein further plug shell assembly has diametrical sealing with receptacle shell assembly through sealing rings said coupling ring having internal threads matching with external threads of plug back shell for engaging the contacts.<br>
The present invention provides an underwater electro mechanical electrical connector which overcomes the disadvantages and limitations of the prior art. The connector of the present invention has got a dry pin-socket interface and hence no filling of fluid is required during assembly. The present invention utilizes an arrangement whereby the insert assembly is positively held in position with the help of back shell tightening. The insert is polarized and locked in position using projecting keys and a collar on the insert assembly. This design totally prevents use of any insert fixing screw or penetration on the insert assembly. The smooth exterior surface of<br><br>
the insert assembly is also used for diametrical sealing against the fill fluid from the module assembly.<br>

The axial load due to towing is transferred from plug back shell to receptacle back shell through the coupling ring or vice versa. The design ensures that under operating conditions, no axial load act on the insert assembly. The insert assembly when secured inside the plug and receptacle shells have diametrical sealing with the inside of the shell surface to withstand internal fluid pressure. The insert assembly has got rear face potting to prevent fluid ingress through the surface of the pigtail wires. The new insert assembly design also ensures sealing of fill fluid leaking between the sheath and conductors of individual wires.<br>
