"CYCLOCARBAMATE       DERIVATIVES       AS       PROGESTERONE       RECEPTOR MODULATORS"<br>
AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORPORATION, of Five Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07840, United States of America and LIGAND PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., of 10275 Science Center Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
V<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to compounds that antagonists of the progesterone receptor, their preparation and utility.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Intracellular receptors (IR) form a class of structurally related gene regulators known as "ligand dependent transcription factors" (R. M. Evans, Science, 240, 889, 1988). The steroid receptor family is a subset of the IR family, including progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).<br>
The natural hormone, or ligand, for the PR is the steroid progesterone, but synthetic compounds, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or levonorgestrel, have been made which also serve as ligands. Once a ligand is present in the fluid surrounding a cell, it passes through the membrane via passive diffusion, and binds to the IR to create a receptor/ligand complex. This complex binds to specific gene promoters present in the cell's DNA. Once bound to the DNA the complex modulates the production of mRNA and protein encoded by that gene.<br>
A compound that binds to an IR and mimics the action of the natural hormone is termed an agonist, whilst a compound which inhibits the effect of the hormone is an antagonist.<br>
PR antagonists may be used in contraception. In this context they may be administered alone (Ulmann, et al, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 261, 248, 1995), in combination with a PR agonist (Kekkonen, et al, Fertility and Sterility, 60, 610, 1993) or in combination with a partial ER antagonist such as tamoxifen (WO 96/19997 Al<br>
July 4, 1996).<br>
-2  ~<br><br>
PR antagonists may also be useful for the treatment of hormone dependent breast cancers (Horwitz, et al, Horm. Cancer, 283, pub: Birkhaeuser, Boston, Mass., ed. Vedeckis) as well as uterine and ovarian cancers. PR antagonists may also be useful for the treatment of non-malignant chronic conditions such as fibroids (Murphy, et al, J. Clin. Endo. Metab., 76, 513, 1993) and endometriosis (Kettel, et al, Fertility and Sterility, 56,402, 1991).<br>
PR antagonists may also be useful in hormone replacement therapy for post menopausal patients in combination with a partial ER antagonist such as tamoxifen (US 5719136).<br>
PR antagonists, such as mifepristone and onapristone, have been shown to be effective in a model of hormone dependent prostate cancer, which may indicate their utility in the treatment of this condition in men (Michna, et al, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 761, 224,1995).<br>
The compounds of this invention have been shown to act as competitive inhibitors of progesterone binding to the PR and act as antagonists in functional models, either/or in-vitro and in-vivo. These compounds may be used for contraception, in the treatment of fibroids, endometriosis, breast, uterine, ovarian and prostate cancer, and post menopausal hormone replacement therapy.<br>
Compounds of the prior art are described by Jones, et al, (U.S. Patent No. 5,688,810) is the PR antagonist dihydroquinoline 1.<br><br><br><br>
Jones, et al, described the enol ether 2 (U.S. Patent No. 5,693,646) as a PR ligand.<br><br>
2<br>
Jones, et al, described compound 3 (U.S. Patent No. 5,696,127) as a PR ligand.<br><br>
Zhi, et al, described lactones 4, 5 and 6 as PR antagonists (J. Med. Chem., 41, 291,1998).<br><br><br>
.4-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Zhi, et al, described the ether 7 as a PR antagonist (J. Med. Chem., 41, 291,<br>
1998).<br><br><br><br>
Combs, et al., disclosed the amide 8 as a ligand for the PR (J. Med. Chem., 38, \SS0,1995).<br><br><br><br><br>
Hamann, et al, described the PR antagonist 10 (Ann. N. Y. Acad. Set, 761, 383, 1995).<br>
OCH3<br><br><br><br><br>
Kurihari, et. al, described the PR ligand 12 (J. Antibiotics, SO, 360,1997).<br><br>
-6        <br><br><br>
12<br>
Narr et al. (German Patent, DE 3633861, CA 109:22973) claimed that imidazobenzoxazinones, e.g. A, as cardotonics; Benzoxazin-2-ones, such as brofoxine (B), being active as an anxiolytic was reported by Hartmann et al. (Proc. West. Pharmacol. Soc. 21, 51-55 (1978)); More recently, a number of patents (e.g. Young et al. WO95/20389; Christ et al. W098/14436) claimed quinazolin-2-ones and benzoxazin-2-ones such as compound CI and C2 as inhibitors of HTV reverse transcriptase.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds in the present invention contain a pendent aromatic substituent. The aromatic substituents proved to be critical for the resultant compounds being active as progesterone receptor modulators and have broad structural diversity which may consist of aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl 01 substituted heteroaryl group.<br>

The invention also includes methods of treatment which comprise administering to a mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more compounds as described above as antagonists of the progesterone receptor.<br>
The progesterone receptor antagonists of this invention, used alone or in combination, can be utilized in methods of contraception and the treatment and/or prevention of benign and malignant neoplastic disease. Specific uses of the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of invention include the treatment and/or prevention of uterine myometrial fibroids, endometriosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy; carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the endometrium, ovary, breast, colon, prostate, pituitary, meningioma and other hormone-dependent tumors. Additional uses of the present progesterone receptor antagonists include the synchronization of the estrus in livestock.<br>
When the compounds are employed for the above utilities, they may be combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, for example, solvents, diluents and the like, and may be administered orally in such forms as tablets, capsules, dispersible powders, granules, or suspensions containing, for example, from about 0.05 to 5% of suspending agent, syrups containing, for example, from about 10 to 50% of sugar, and elixirs containing, for example, from about 20 to 50% ethanol, and the like, or parenterally in the form of sterile injectable solutions or suspensions containing from about 0.05 to 5% suspending agent in an isotonic medium. Such pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from about 25 to about 90% of the active ingredient in combination with the carrier, more usually between about 5% and 60% by weight.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.5<br><br><br>
to about 500 mg/kg of animal body weight, preferably given in divided doses two to four times a day, or in a sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1 to 100 mg, preferably from about 2 to 80 mg. Dosage forms suitable for internal use comprise from about 0.5 to 500 mg of the active compound in intimate admixture with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
These active compounds may be administered orally as well as by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. Solid carriers include starch, lactose, dicalcium phosphate, macrocrystalline cellulose, sucrose and kaolin, while liquid carriers include sterile water, polyethylene glycols, non-ionic surfactants and edible oils such as corn, peanut and sesame oils, as are appropriate to the nature of the active ingredient and the particular form of administration desired. Adjuvents customarily employed in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions may be advantageously included, such as flavoring agents, coloring agents, preserving agents, and antioxidants, for example, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, BHT and BHA.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical compositions from the standpoint of ease of preparation and administration are solid compositions, particularly tablets and hard-filled or liquid-filled capsules. Oral administration of the compounds is preferred.<br>
These active compounds may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds as a free base or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid, polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical forms .suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringe ability exits. It must be stable under conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacterial and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oil.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be prepared following the Schemes illustrated below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As demonstrated in Scheme I, the compounds of this invention are generally prepared by employing the suitable coupling reaction as a final step. An appropriately substituted ortho-amino benzoic acid or its derivatives such as ethyl ester (X = Br, I, C1, or a latent coupling precursor such as alkoxy group which can be converted into<br><br><br>
OTf group suitable in the coupling reaction.) was treated with a suitable organo metallic reagent, e.g. Grignard reagent, in appropriate nonprotic solvents which include but not limited to THF or ether to give ortho-amino carbinol 2 under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen at -78 °C to room temperature. Ring closure of carbinol 2 to yield benzoxazin-2-ones 3 is commonly effected by a condensing agent such as carbonyldiimidazole, phosgene, dimethylcarbonate, or diethylcarbonate in a suitable nonprotic  solvent such as THF  at temperatures ranging  from  room temperature to 65 °C. The arylation of benzoxazin-2-ones 3 to yield 4 can be effected by various coupling reactions including Suzuki, Stille reactions. These reactions are commonly performed in the presence of transition metallic catalyst, e.g., palladium or nickel     complex     often     with     phosphino     ligands,     e.g.,     Ph3P,      1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene, l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane or palladium salt such as palladium acetate. Under this catalytic condition, an appropriately substituted nucleophilic reagent, e.g., aryl boronic acid, arylstannane, or aryl zinc compound, is coupled with benzoxazinones 3 to give 4.   If a base is needed in the reaction, the commonly used bases include but not limited to sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium phosphate, barium carbonate,   potassium acetate, or cesium fluoride.   The most commonly used solvents in these reactions include benzene, DMF, isopropanol, toluene, ethanol, DME, ether, acetone or a mixture of any one of these solvent and water.  The coupling reaction is generally executed under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon at temperatures ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent or solvent system or mixture.<br>
Benzoxazinones 3 can be converted into a nucleophile such as boronic acid which can be coupled with an appropriate electrophile, e.g., aryl bromide or aryl iodide, to yield 4 employing the coupling reaction condition as described above. The transformation of 3 into 5 can be effected by treating 3 with an organo metallic reagent, e.g., n-BuLi, in a nonprotic solvent such as THF or ether followed by quenching the reaction solution with a suitable electrophile such as trimethyl borate,<br><br>
triisopropyl borate, bishexalkyl tin reagent, or zinc chloride at temperatures ranging from-78 °C to reflux temperature under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen.<br><br><br>
Scheme la illustrates an alternative approach leading to the benzoxazinones 3. Thus, an appropriate aniline 1 is protected with a suitable alkoxy carbonyl protective group including but not limited to allyloxy carbonyl, t-butoxy carbonyl, benzoxy carbonyl, ethoxy carbonyl, or methoxy carbonyl in a suitable solvent such as THF, acetonitrile, with or without presence of a base either as a catalyst or as an acid scavenger.    The protected aniline is then treated with a suitable organo metallic reagent such as organo lithium agent or Grignard reagent in the same fashion as to prepare compound 2 to give the carbinol 6.  The treatment of 6 with a suitable base such as potassium t-butoxide, n-butyl lithium, potassium hydroxide in an appropriate solvent such as toluene, THF, alcohol under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon at the temperature ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the relevant solvent to afford benzoxazinones 3.<br><br><br>
Scheme II describes the procedures to prepare benzoxazinones bearing two different substituents at position-4.   The Weinreb amide 8 can be prepared from an appropriately   substituted   isatoic   anhydride   7   when   treated   with   N-,   O-dimethylhydroxyl-amine hydrochloride salt in a protic solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol at reflux under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen. Coupling of amide 8 with an aryl electrophile such as aryl boronic acid or arylstannane to give 9 can be effected by employing a typical coupling reaction such as Suzuki, Stille coupling procedure in  a similar fashion as  described  for the preparation of benzoxazinones 4.  Treatment of Weinreb amide 9 with organo metallic compounds, e.g., alkyllithium, alkynyllithium, aryllithium, or their Grignard counterpart in a nonprotic solvent such as THF or ether under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen at -78 ° to room temperature affords amino ketone 10. Conversion of ketone 10 to carbinol 11 can be effected by treatment of 10 with an organo metallic reagent such as alkyl, alkynyl, or aryl Grignard compound in a nonprotic solvent such as THF or ether under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen at -78 °C to room temperature. Conversion of ketone 10 to carbinol 11 can also be effected by reduction of ketone group of 10 to the carbinol moiety of 11 using an appropriate reducing reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent such as  THF,  ether,  or anhydrous  alcohol  under an inert atmosphere  in  the temperature ranging from 0 °C to the boiling point of the solvent.  Ring closure of carbinol 11 to produce the compounds of this invention can be accomplished with condensing agents such as carbonyldiimidazole, phosgene, dimethylcarbonate, or diethylcarbonate in a suitable nonprotic solvent such as THF at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 65 °C.<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, ortho-amino ketone 10 can be prepared by treatment of ortho-amino benzonitrile 14 with an organo metallic compound such as organo lithium reagent or Gringard reagent in a suitable solvent such as THF or ether under an inert<br><br>
atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen at temperatures ranging from -78 °C to room temperature as illustrated in Scheme III. Benzonitrile 14 can be readily prepared from an appropriately substituted benzonitrile such as. bromobenzonitrile 13 using a suitable coupling reaction such as Stille or Suzuki protocol carried out in a similar fashion as described for the preparation of the Weinreb amide 9.<br>
Scheme III<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme IV depicts an approach to prepare benzoxazinones with a low perfluoroalkyl substituent at position-4, e.g. R6 is trifluorormethyl group. An appropriately substituted chloroaniline 15 was protected with a suitable protective reagent such as pivaloyl chloride or di-tert-butyl pyrocarbonate to give protected aniline 16 in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile, acetone, THF, methylene chloride, or a mixture of solvent such as methylene chloride and water under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 70 °C. A suitable base such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, or potassium carbonate may be needed when the reaction produces an acid as a side-product such as<br><br>
hydrochloride.     Treatment of 16 with an appropriate alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium or .s-butyllithium followed by reaction with a low perfluorocarboxy derivatives,  e.g.,  trifluoroacetyl  chloride,   l-(trifluoroacetyl)-imidazole,  or  ethyl trifluoroacetate in a nonprotic solvent such as ether or THF under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen at -78 °C to ambient temperature gives the protective ortho-amino ketones.    Subsequent removal of the protecting group can be effected by reaction of protected amino ketones with a suitable acid such as TFA, 3N aqueous hydrochloride solution in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride or water at 0 °C to boiling point of the solvent to afford ortho-amino ketone 17. The preparation of 6-chlorobenzoxazinones 19 from 17 can be accomplished in the same fashion as described for the synthesis of benzoxazinone 12 from ketone 10. Coupling of 19 with an aryl group to yield the compounds of this invention, 12 as shown in scheme IV can be effected by a nickel complex catalyzed coupling reaction. The palladium catalysts proved not to be an efficient catalyst in this coupling process. The coupling reaction of 19 with an appropriate aryl boronic acid can be accomplished in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium phosphate and a catalyst of nickel (0 or II) complex, e.g. a nickel complex of dppe, dppf, or triphenylphosphine. The most commonly used solvents in the reaction include dioxane or THF.  The coupling reaction is generally executed under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon at temperatures ranging from ambient temperature to 95 °C.<br><br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme V, the compounds 6 or 12 can be further derivatized at position-1 via numerous approaches leading to a variety of novel cyclocarbamate derivatives including 1-alkyl, 1-substituted alkyl, 1-carbonyl, 1-substituted carbonyl, 1-carboxy, substituted 1-carboxy derivatives. For examples, alkyl or substituted alkyl derivatives 20 can be formed by treatment of carbamate 12 or 6 with a suitable base<br><br>
such as sodium hydride in suitable solvent such as DMF under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen followed by addition of an appropriate electrophile such as alkyl or substituted alkyl bromide, iodide, or triflate. Such a transformation of 12 or 6 at position-1 can also be effected using biphasic conditions as indicated in scheme V in which alkylation is executed using a biphasic catalyst such as tributylarnmonium bromide in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile. Another example of this type of modification includes, but is not limited to, the one depicted in scheme V where heating 12 or 6 with triethyl orthoformate affords 1-substituted derivatives of compound 12 or 6.<br><br><br>
The acylation or carboxylation of the compound 12 or 6 at position-1 to give compound 21 can be readily effected by treatment of 12 or 6 with a suitable acylating or carboxylating reagent such as di-t-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a suitable basic catalyst such as DMAP in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrife under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen. The animation of position-1 of compound 12 or 6 to give 22 can be accomplished using a suitable animating reagent such as chloroamine in the presence of a suitable base, such as sodium hydride, in a suitable solvent, such as THF or diethyl ether, following literature procedures (Metlesics et al. J. Org. Chem. 30,1311(1965).)<br>

2.	PRE-luciferase assay in CV-1 cells<br>
The object of this assay is to determine a compound's progestational or antiprogestational potency based on its effect on PRE-luciferase reporter activity in CV-1 cells co-transfected with human PR and PRE-luciferase plasmids. The materials methods used in the assay are as follows.<br>
a-        Medium: The growth medium was as follows: DMEM (BioWhittaker) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 100U/m) penicillin, ] 00mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM GlutaMax (GIBCO, BRL). The experimental medium was as follows: DMEM (BioWhittaker), phenol red-free, containing 10% (v/v) charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, l00U/ml penicillin, l00mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM GlutaMax (GIBCO, BRL).<br>
b.   Cell culture, transfection, treatment, and luciferase assay<br>
Stock CV-1 cells are maintained in growth medium. Co-transfection is done using 1.2xl07 cells, 5 mg pLEM plasmid with hPR-B inserted at Sphl and BamHl sites, 10 mg pGL3 plasmid with two PREs upstream of the luciferase sequence, and 50 mg sonicated calf thymus DNA as carrier DNA in 250 ml.<br>
-87 -<br><br>
Electroporation is earned out at 260 V and 1,000 mF in a Biorad Gene Pulser H. After electroporation, cells are resuspended in growth medium and plated in 96-well plate at 40,000 cells/well in 200 ul. Following overnight incubation, the medium is changed to experimental medium. Cells are then treated with reference or test compounds in experimental medium. Compounds are tested for antiprogestational activity in the presence of 3 nM progesterone. Twenty-four hr. after treatment, the medium is discarded, cells are washed three times with D-PBS (GIBCO, BRL). Fifty ul of cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) is added to each well and the plates are shaken for 15 min in a Titer Plate Shaker (Lab Line Instrument, Inc.). Luciferase activity is measured using luciferase reagents from Promega.<br>
c.	Analysis of Results:<br>

and 2 mM GlutaMax (GIBCO, BRL).<br>
c.	Cell culture<br>
Stock T47 D cells are maintained in growth medium. For BrdU incorporation assay, cells are plated in 96-well plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware) at 10,000 cells/well in growth medium. After overnight incubation, the medium is changed to treatment medium and cells are cultured for an additional 24 hr before treatment. Stock compounds are dissolved in appropriate vehicle (100% ethanol or 50% ethanol/50% DMSO), subsequently diluted in treatment medium and added to the cells. Progestin and antiprogestin reference compounds are run in full dose-response curves. The final concentration of vehicle is 0.1%. In control wells, cells receive vehicle only. Antiprogestins are tested in the presence of 0.03 nM trimegestone, the reference progestin agonist. Twenty-four hours after treatment, the medium is discarded and cells are labeled with 10 mM BrdU (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL) in treatment medium for 4 hr.<br>
d. Cell Proliferation Assay At the end of BrdU labeling, the medium is removed and BrdU incorporation is measured using a cell proliferation ELISA kit (#RPN 250, Amersham Life Science) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells are fixed in an ethanol containing fixative for 30 min, followed by incubation in a blocking buffer for 30 min to reduce background. Peroxidase-labeled anti-BrdU antibody is added to the wells and incubated for 60 min. The cells are rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with 3,3'5,5'-terramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for 10-20 min depending upon the potency of tested compounds. Then 25 µl of 1 M sulfuric acid is<br>

4. T47D cell alkaline phosphatase assay The purpose of this assay is to identify progestins or antiprogestins by determining a compound's effect on alkaline phosphatase activity in T47D cells. The materials and methods used in this assay are as follows.<br>
a.	Culture medium: DMEM:F12 (1:1) (GIBCO, BRL)<br>
supplemented with 5% (v/v) charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (not heat-inactivated),<br>
lOOU/ml penicillin, 100 \ig/m\ streptomycin, and 2 mM GlutaMax (GIBCO, BRL).<br>

n. 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.8 containing 4 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate<br>
(Sigma).<br>
c.     Cell Culture and Treatment:<br>
Frozen T47D cells were thawed in a 37°C water bath and diluted to 280,000 cells/ml in culture medium. To each well in a 96-well plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware), 180 p.1 of diluted cell suspension was added. Twenty (il of reference or test compounds diluted in the culture medium was then added to each well. When testing for progestin antagonist activity, reference antiprogestins or test compounds were added in the presence of 1 nM progesterone. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO^umidified atmosphere for 24 hr.<br>
d. Alkaline Phosphatase Enzyme Assay:<br><br>

At the end of treatment, the medium was removed from the plate and fifty µ1 of assay buffer I was added to each well. The plates were shaken in a titer plate shaker for 15 min. Then 150 µl of assay buffer II was added to each well. Optical density measurements were taken at 5 min intervals for 30 min at a test wavelength of 405 nM.<br>
e.	Analysis of Results: Analysis of dose-response data<br>
For reference and test compounds, a dose response curve<br>
is generated for dose (X-axis) vs. the rate of enzyme reaction (slope) (Y-axis). Square root-transformed data are used for analysis of variance and nonlinear dose response curve fitting for both agonist and antagonist modes. Huber weighting is used to downweight the effects of outliers. EC50 or IC50 values are calculated from the retransformed values. JMP software (SAS Institute, Inc.) is used for both one-way analysis of variance and non-linear dose response analyses in both single dose and dose response studies.<br>

B.       In-vivo Biology<br>
The primary in-vivo assay is the rat decidualization model which may be used to determine progestational effects of both agonists and antagonists. The secondary in-vivo assay is the rat ovulation inhibition model which is under development and hence the protocol is un-available.<br>
1.  Rat decidualization assay The objective of this procedure is used to evaluate the effect of progestins and antiprogestins on rat uterine decidualization and compare the relative potencies of various test compounds. The materials and methods used in this assay are as follows.<br>
a.	Methods: Test compounds are dissolved in 100% ethanol<br>
and mixed with corn oil (vehicle). Stock solutions of the test compounds in oil<br>
(MazolaTM) are then prepared by heating (-80 °C) the mixture to evaporate ethanol.<br>
Test compounds are subsequently diluted with 100% com oil or 10% ethanol in com<br>
oil prior to the treatment of animals. No difference in decidual response was found<br>
when these two vehicles were compared.<br>
b.	Animals (RACUC protocol #5002)<br><br><br>
Ovariectomized mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (~60-day old and 230g) are obtained from Taconic (Taconic Farms, NY) following surgery. Ovariectomy is performed at least 10 days prior to treatment to reduce circulating sex steroids. Animals are housed under 12 hr light/dark cycle and given standard rat chow and water ad libitum.<br>
c. Treatment<br>
Rats are weighed and randomly assigned to groups of 4 or 5 before treatment. Test compounds in 0.2 ml vehicle are administered by subcutaneous injection in the nape of the neck or by gavage using 0.5 ml. The animals are treated once daily for seven days. For testing antiprogestins, animals are given the test compounds and a EC50 dose of progesterone (5.6 mg/kg) during the first three days of treatment. Following decidual stimulation, animals continue to receive progesterone until necropsy four days later.<br>
d.	Dosing<br>
Doses are prepared based upon mg/kg mean group body weight. In all studies, a control group receiving vehicle is included. Determination of dose-response curves is carried out using doses with half log increases (e.g. 0.1,0.3, 1.0,3.0 mg/kg...).<br>
e.	Decidual induction<br>
Approximately 24 hr after the third injection, decidualization is induced in one of the uterine horns by scratching the antimesometrial luminal epithelium with a blunt 21 G needle. The contralateral horn is not scratched and serves as an unstimulated control. Approximately 24 hr following the final treatment, rats are sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and body weight measured. Uteri are removed and trimmed of fat. Decidualized (D-hom) and control (C-horn) uterine horns are weighed separately.<br>
f.	Analysis of Results:<br>
The increase in weight of the decidualized uterine hom is calculated by D-hom/C-hom and logarithmic transformation is used to maximize<br><br>
normality and homogeneity of variance. The Huber M-estimator is used to down weight the outlying transformed observations for both dose-response curve fitting and one-way analysis of variance. JMP software (SAS Institute, Inc.) is used for both one¬way ANOVA and non-linear dose-response analyses, g. Reference Compounds: All progestin reference compounds were run in full dose-response curves and the EC50 for uterine wet weight were calculated.<br>
