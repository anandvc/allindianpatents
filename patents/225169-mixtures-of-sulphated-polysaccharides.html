				<td>The present invention relates to mixtures of sulphated polysaccharides.<br>
The present invention relates to mixtures of polysaccharides derived from heparin, their method of preparation and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Heparin is a mixture of sulphated mucopolysaccharides of animal origin which is used in particular for its anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties.<br>
Heparin nevertheless has disadvantages which limit the conditions of its use. In particular, its high anticoagulant activity (anti-IIa activity) can cause haemorrhages.<br>
Low-molecular-weight heparins obtained by basic depolymerization of heparin esters have been proposed (EP40144); however, these products still have a high anti-IIa activity.<br>
EP 0027089 describes oligosaccharides and fractions containing them having an anti-Xa activity higher than heparin, obtained by depolymerisation of heparin or heparinic fractions by nitrous acid or by an enzymatic process, and by treatment of the depolymerisation mixture to separate at least the major part of the oligosacchridic chains, advantageously by contact with ATIII, elimination of the unselected products and recovery of the selected products.<br>
The invention relates to mixtures of polysaccharides derived from heparin possessing a more selective activity towards activated factor X (factor Xa) and activated factor II (factor Ila) than heparin.<br>
The subject of the present invention is more particularly the mixtures of sulphated polysaccharides possessing the general structure of the constituent<br><br>
polysaccharides of heparin and exhibiting the following characteristics:<br>
-	they have a mean molecular weight of 1500<br>
to 3000 daltons, an anti-Xa activity of 100 to<br>
150 IU/mg, an anti-IIa activity of 0 to 10 IU/mg and an anti-Xa activity/anti-IIa activity ratio greater than<br>
10,<br>
-	the constituent polysaccharides of the<br>
mixtures contain 2 to 26 saccharide units and have a<br>
4,5-unsaturated glucuronic acid 2-0-sulphate unit at<br>
one of their ends,<br>
in the form of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal salt.<br>
As alkali or alkaline-earth metal salt, the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts are preferred.<br>
The mean molecular weight is determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography using two columns in series, for example those marketed under the name TSK G3 000 XL and TSK G2 000 XL. The detection is carried out by refractometry. The eluent used is lithium nitrate and the flow rate is 0.6 ml/min. The system is calibrated with standards prepared by fractionation of enoxaparin (AVENTIS) by chromatography on agarose-polyacrylamide gel (IBF). This preparation is carried out according to the technique described by Barrowcliffe et al., Thromb. Res., 12, 27-36 (1977-78) or D.A. Lane et al. , Thromb. Res., 12, 257-271<br><br>
 (1977-78) . The results are calculated with the GPC6 software (Perkin Elmer).<br>
The anti-Xa activity is measured by the amidolytic method on a chromogenic substrate described by Teien et al., Thromb. Res., 10, 399-410 (1977), with, as standard, the first international standard for low-molecular weight heparins.<br>
The anti-IIa activity is measured by the technique described by Anderson L.O. et al., Thromb. Res., 15, 531-541 (1979), with, as standard, the first international standard for low-molecular weight heparins.<br>
Preferably, the mixtures as described above exhibit an anti-Xa activity of between 125 and 150 IU/mg.<br>
Most particularly, the mixtures as described above exhibit an anti-Xa activity of between 140 and 150 IU/mg and have a mean molecular weight of between 2000 and 3000 daltons.<br>
Preferably, the mixtures according to the invention have an anti-IIa activity of 0 to 5 IU/mg.<br>
Still more preferably, the mixtures have an anti-Xa activity/anti-IIa activity ratio greater than 2 5.<br>
The mixtures of oligosaccharides according to the invention may be prepared by depolymerization of a quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin in organic medium, by means of a strong organic base<br><br>
with a pka greater than 20 or of sodium imidazolate, conversion of the quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of the depolymerized heparin to a sodium salt, saponification of the ester and optionally purification.<br>
The quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin is preferably the benzethonium, cetylpyridinium or cetyltrimethylammonium salt.<br>
The depolymerization is generally carried out in an inert organic solvent such as a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane), tetrahydrofuran, anisole, at a temperature of -20°C to 40°C.<br>
As strong organic base with a pka greater than 20, it is possible to use 1,5,7-triaza-bicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene, 2-tert-butylimino-2-diethylamino-1, 3-dimethylperhydro--l, 3 , 2-diaza-phosphorine, the bases of the family of guanidine and phosphazenes.<br>
The bases of the guanidine family are preferably those of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1 is hydrogen or alkyl, R2, R3, R4 and R5, which are identical or different, each represent an alkyl radical.<br><br>
More particularly, R1 is hydrogen and R2, R3, R4 and R5 are methyl radicals.<br>
The strong organic bases related to the phosphazene family are defined for example according to R. Schwesinger et al. , Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 26, 1167-1169 (1987), R. Schwesinger et al., Angew. Chem. 105, 1420  (1993) .<br>
Among the bases of the phosphazene family, those of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which the radicals R1 to R7 are identical or<br>
different and represent alkyl radicals are preferably<br>
used.<br>
In the preceding formulae, the alkyl radicals contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the form of a straight or branched chain.<br>
Advantageously, the strong organic base with a pka greater than 20 or sodium imidazolate/quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin mol ratio is between 0.2 and 5 and preferably between 1 and 4.<br>
More particularly, the degree of esterification of the quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin is between 50 and 100% and preferably between 70 and 90%. This degree of<br><br>
esterification corresponds to the molar percentage of esterification of the uronic acids of the heparin.<br>
The conversion of the quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of the depolymerized heparin to a sodium salt is generally carried out by treating the reaction medium with an alcoholic solution of sodium acetate and preferably with a 10% solution of sodium acetate in methanol (weight/volume), at a temperature of between 15 and 2 5°C. The equivalent by weight of acetate added is preferably 3 times greater than the mass of quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin used in the depolymerization reaction.<br>
The saponification is generally carried out by means of an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide, in an aqueous medium, at a temperature of between 0 and 2 0°C and preferably between 0 and 10°C. 1 to 5 molar equivalents of alkali metal hydroxide will be generally used. Preferably, the saponification will be carried out in the presence of 2 to 3 molar equivalents of alkali metal hydroxide.<br>
The final product may be optionally purified by any known method of purifying depolymerized heparins and in particular according to the method described in patent EP 0037319. Preferably, the purification is carried out by means of hydrogen peroxide, in an aqueous medium, at a temperature of 10 to 50°C.<br><br>
Preferably, this operation is carried out between 20 and 40°C.<br>
The quaternary ammonium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme:<br>
a)	conversion of the heparin in the form of a sodium salt by means of benzethonium chloride in order to obtain benzethonium heparinate,<br>
b)	esterification of the benzethonium salt obtained above by means of benzyl chloride and treatment with an alcoholic solution of sodium acetate in order to obtain the sodium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin,<br>
c)	transalification of the sodium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin to a quaternary ammonium salt and preferably to a benzethonium, cetylpyridinium or cetyltrimethylammonium salt.<br>
The reaction of step a) is carried out in an aqueous medium, by the action of benzethonium chloride in excess, on heparin in the form of a sodium salt, at a temperature in the region of 15 to 25°C. Advantageously, the benzethonium chloride/heparin in the form of a sodium salt molar ratio is between 2 and 3 and more particularly 2.5.<br>
The starting heparin in the form of a sodium salt used is preferably a pig heparin. The latter may be purified beforehand in order to reduce its dermatan<br><br>
sulphate level according to the method described in patent FR2663639.<br>
The esterification of step b) is preferably carried out in a chlorinated organic solvent (for example chloroform or methylene chloride), at a temperature of between 25 and 45°C and preferably between 30 and 40°C. The ester in the form of a sodium salt is then recovered by precipitation by means of sodium acetate at 10% by weight/volume in an alcohol such as methanol. 1 to 1.2 volumes of alcohol are generally used per volume of reaction medium. The quantity of benzyl chloride and the reaction time are adjusted in order to obtain a degree of esterification of between 50 and 100% and preferably between 70 and 90%. Preferably, 0.5 to 1.5 parts by weight of benzyl chloride are used for 1 part by weight of benzethonium salt of heparin. Likewise, preferably the reaction time will be between 10 and 35 hours.<br>
The transalification step c) is carried out by means of a quaternary ammonium chloride and preferably by means of benzethonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride or cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, in an aqueous medium, at a temperature of between 10 and 25°C. Advantageously, the quaternary ammonium chloride/sodium salt of the benzyl ester of heparin mol ratio is between 2 and 3.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, in the form of a sodium salt, may be converted to another<br><br>
salt of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal salt. The passage from one salt to another is optionally achieved using the method described in patent US4168377.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are not toxic and may thus be used as medicaments.<br>
The mixtures of the present invention may be used as antithrombotic agents. In particular, they are useful for the prevention of venous thromboses, arterial thrombotic accidents, in particular in the case of myocardial infarction. They are also useful in the prevention and treatment of the proliferation of the smooth muscle cells, angiogenesis, and as neuroprotective agents for atherosclerosis and for arteriosclerosis.<br>
The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active ingredient, a mixture of polysaccharides according to the invention, optionally in combination with one or more inert excipients.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are for example solutions which can be injected by the subcutaneous or intravenous route. They are also useful by the pulmonary route  (inhalation) .<br>
The dosage may vary according to the age, weight and state of health of the patient. For an adult, it is in general between 2 0 and 100 mg per day by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route.<br><br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
