DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OPTICALLY ACTIVE CYCLOPROPANE COMPOUND AND ASYMMETRIC COPPER COMPLEX FOR USE IN THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing an optically active cyclopropane compound and an asymmetric copper complex for use in the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Optically active cyclopropane compounds whose representative examples are (+)-trans-2,2-d1methyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester and (+)-trans-3,3-d1methyl-2-<br>
(benzyloxymethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester are important compounds as synthetic intermediates of pesticides and Pharmaceuticals such as synthesized pyrethroid insecticides. As the process for producing the optically active cyclopropane compound, methods for carrying out asymmetric cyclopropanation of a prochiral olefin using an asymmetric copper complex prepared from an optically active bisoxazoline compound and a copper compound as a catalyst have been known (e.g. JP 11-171874 A, Tetrahedron Lett., 32, 7373 (1991) and Tetrahedron, 57,<br><br>
6083 (2001)). However, these methods were not always enough for the selectivity of (+)-trans-isomer of the desirable cyclopropane compound when a diazoacetic acid lower alkyl ester such as ethyl diazoacetate was used, and it was needed to use a particular diazoacetic acid ester such as diazoacetic acid (2,6-d1-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl) ester to improve the selectivity.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
According to the process of the present invention, an optically active trans cyclopropane compound can be obtained efficiently from a diazoacetic acid lower alkyl ester which is an industrially advantageous and a prochiral olefin by using a novel asymmetric copper complex prepared from the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound represented by the formula (1) described below and a copper compound.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a process for producing an optically active cyclopropane compound represented by the formula (4):<br><br>
wherein R3, R4, R5 and R6 are the same or different, and<br><br>
represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl group,<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl group, a substituted<br>
or unsubstituted aryl group,<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group or<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxycarbonyl group;<br>
provided that, when R3 and R5 are the same, R4 and R6 are<br>
different from each other; and<br>
R7 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
which comprises reacting a prochiral olefin represented by<br>
the formula (2):<br><br>
wherein R3, R4, R5, and R6 are as described above,<br>
with a diazoacetic acid ester represented by the formula<br>
(3):<br>
N,CHCO,R7	(3)<br>
wherein R7 is as defined above,<br>
in the presence of an asymmetric copper complex prepared from an optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound represented by the formula (1):<br><br><br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a Cl-6 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, R2 represents a Cl-6 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, and n represents an integer of 0 to 3;<br>
provided that, when R1 represents a Cl-6 alkyl group, two Rxs which are bonded to the same carbon atom may be bonded together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded to form a ring; and * represents an asymmetric carbon atom; and a copper compound.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Present Invention<br>
First, the asymmetric copper complex prepared from the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound represented by the formula (1) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the optically active bisoxazoline compound (1)) and the copper compound will be illustrated.<br>
In the optically active bisoxazoline compound (1), examples of the alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms<br><br>
represented by R1 or R2 include straight or branched chain alkyl groups such as a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-pentyl, and n-hexyl group.<br>
As the unsubstituted aralkyl groups represented by R1 or R2, C7-16 aralkyl groups which are Cl-6 alkyl groups substituted with a aryl group such as a phenyl and naphthyl group are exemplified. As the substituents of the substituted aralkyl groups, at least one group selected from alkyl groups and alkoxy groups is exemplified. Examples of the alkyl groups and the alkoxy groups include Cl-6 alkyl groups and Cl-6 alkoxy groups respectively. Specific examples thereof include a benzyl, 2-methylbenzyl, 3-methylbenzyl, 4-methylbenzyl, 2-methoxybenzyl, 3-methoxybenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 1-naphthylmethyl, and 2 -naphthylmethyl group.<br>
As the substituents of the substituted phenyl groups represented by R1 or R2, at least one group selected from alkyl groups and alkoxy groups is exemplified. Examples of the alkyl groups and the alkoxy groups include Cl-6 alkyl groups and Cl-6 alkoxy groups respectively. Specific examples thereof include a 4-methylphenyl and 3-methoxyphenyl group.<br>
As the substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl groups represented by R1, C7-16 aralkyl groups which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from Cl-<br><br>
6 alkyl groups and Cl-6 alkoxy groups are exemplified. Examples of the substituted or unsubstituted phenyl groups include phenyl groups which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from Cl-6 alkyl groups and Cl-6 alkoxy groups.<br>
As the substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl groups represented by R2, C7-16 aralkyl groups which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from Cl-6 alkyl groups and Cl-6 alkoxy groups are exemplified. Examples of the substituted or unsubstituted phenyl groups include phenyl groups which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from the Cl-6 alkyl groups and the Cl-6 alkoxy groups. R2 is preferably a t-butyl group.<br>
Examples of the Cl-6 alkyl of the Cl-6 alkyl groups and the Cl-6 alkoxy groups which are substituents of the substituted aralkyl groups or the substituted phenyl groups described above include straight chain or branched chain alkyl groups such as a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, n-pentyl, and n-hexyl group like the above.<br>
When two Rxs represent Cl-6 alkyl groups, as the ring formed by bonding two Rxs which are bonded to the same carbon atom together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, a cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane,<br><br>
cyclohexane, and cycloheptane ring are exemplified.<br>
In the formula of the optically active bisoxazoline compound (1), n represents an integer of 0 to 3. For example, when n is 0, it represents a cyclopropylidenebisoxazoline compound.<br>

16.1 mg (0-055 mmol) of 1,l-bis[2-[(4S)-(tert-butyl)-<br>
oxazoline]]cyclopropane.<br>
Yield: 66% (based on ethyl diazoacetate)<br>
trans-isomer/cis-isomer ratio: 84/16<br>
Optically purity: trans-isomer 93%e.e. ((+)-isomer), cis-<br>
isomer 6%e.e. ((+)-isomer)<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the process of the present invention, it is possible to produce an optically active transcyclopropane compound efficiently from a diazoacetic acid lower alkyl ester which is industrially advantageous and a prochiral olefin by using the novel asymmetric copper complex prepared from the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound and the copper compound.<br>
In the process for producing (+)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate and (+)-trans-3,3-dimethyl-2-(benzyloxymethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate, it is superior to (+)-trans selectivity and it is industrially advantageous.<br><br>

a C7-15 aralkyl group which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from a Cl-6 alkyl group and a Cl-6 alkoxy group, or<br>
a phenyl group which may be substituted with at least<br><br>
one substituent selected from a Cl-6 alkyl group and a Cl-6 alkoxy group.<br>
8.	The process according to claim 1, wherein the optically active bisoxazoline compound is 1,l-bis[2-(4S)- (tert-butyl)-oxazoline]]cyclopropane.<br>
9.	An asymmetric copper complex obtained by bringing the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound according to claim 1 or 7 into contact with a copper compound.<br>
10.	An asymmetric copper complex solution obtained by bringing the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound according to claim 1 into contact with a copper compound in the presence of a solvent.<br>
11.	The asymmetric copper complex according to claim 9, wherein the copper compound is a monovalent or divalent copper trifluoromethanesulfonate.<br>
