COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br><br>
ADVANCED ARRAY TECHNOLOGIES S.A., a Belgian company of Chemin des Pierres , 4, B-5020 Malonne, Belgium,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
METHOD FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND/OR THE QUANTIFICATION OF A TARGET COMPOUND OBTAINED FROM A BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE UPON  CHIPS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
[0OOl]       The present invention is related to a method for the identification and/or the quantification of a target  compound obtained from a biological  sample by binding to a capture molecule fixed upon chips. [0002]       The present invention is also related to an identification and/or quantification apparatus based upon said method,  that allows the identification and/or the quantification of positive locations of bounded target compounds upon said chips.<br>
Background on the invention and state of the art [0003]       Biological  assays  are  mainly  based  upon interaction specificity between two biological molecules such two strands of nucleic acid molecules, an antigen and an antibody or a ligand and its receptor. The present challenge of biological assays is to perform simultaneously the multiple detection of molecules present in a sample. Miniaturisation and development of arrays upon the surface of "biochips" are tools that allow multiplex reactions in a microscopic  format,  said detection being made with  a limited volume of sample for the screening and/or the<br><br>
identification of multiple possible target compounds. These arrays are formed of discrete regions, containing a specific capture molecule used for the binding of the target compound. These discrete regions, as small as a few micrometers,  allow the  fixation  of  several  thousands<br>
capture molecules per cm2 surface (WO 95/11995) . [0004] However, the detection of bounded target compounds is difficult, since their amount is very small due to said miniaturisation (few fentomoles or even few attomoles) . Therefore, only extremely sensitive methods are adequate for such detection.<br>
[0005]       It has been proposed a labelling of a target compound like DNA with fluorescent molecules after their possible genetic amplification. When an RNA molecule has to be detected, it is first transformed into a cDNA, before its possible amplification.  If direct labelling of the target  compound  is  not  possible,  a  double  reaction (sandwich reaction) can be performed. However, the amount of fluorescent molecules is so low that it is necessary to develop specific array scanners for the detection and/or the  quantification  of  the  bounded  compound upon  the "hybridisation chips".  Said expensive specific scanners comprise a laser scanner for excitation of the fluorescent molecules, a pinhole for decreasing the noise fluorescent background,  and  a  photomultiplier  for  increasing  the sensitivity of the detection.<br>
[0006] Alternative detection methods that present a high sensitivity are described in the documents US-5,821,060 and WO95/04160 and are based upon the detection using expensive devices such as mass spectrometers.<br>
[0007] It has also been proposed methods based upon the precipitation of specific products  resulting of  a<br><br>
colorimetric  labelling  (US  5,270,167,   US  4,731,325, EP-A-0301141)  or the  result  of  an  enzymatic  activity (EP-A-0393868, WO 86/02733,  EP-A-00G3810). However,  said methods are either characterized by a low sensitivity or are not adequate for_ the detection of a target compound upon "hybridisation chips", because the precipitate will occur at a certain distance of the reaction binding and its location can not be easily correlated with a specific bounded target compound. In addition,. the -density of the precipitate of such enzymatic reactions is not enough opaque for allowing a detection by light absorption. [0008]        It has also been proposed to improve the detection by fixing a soluble product obtained from the enzymatic reaction with a metal before its precipitation. However, as the result of said enzymatic reaction is a soluble product,  there is  no  correlation between  the location of the precipitate and the detection of a specific bounded target compound.<br>
Aims of the invention<br>
[0009]       The present invention aims to provide a new<br>
identification and/or quantification method of one or more<br>
target compounds present  (possibly simultaneously)  in a<br>
biological sample and that will not present the drawbacks<br>
of the state of the art.<br>
[0010] The present invention aims to provide such a method that is simple and not expensive, that allows the detection of said target compounds by using fixed capture molecules upon arrays of the surface of a solid support.<br>
[0011] A last aim of the present invention is to provide also a simple and non-expensive apparatus based upon said method, that improves the identification and/or the quantification of bounded target compounds upon "hybridisation chips".<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0012]       The present invention is related to a method for identification and/or quantification of at least one target compound present in a biological sample by its binding upon a capture molecule fixed upon arrays of a solid support (hereafter called "hybridisation chips"), the binding of said target compound upon its corresponding capture molecule resulting in the formation of a metal precipitate at the location of said capture molecule. [0013]       Advantageously,  said method comprises  the steps of:<br>
- putting into contact the target compound with a capture molecule in order to allow a specific binding between said target compound with a (corresponding) capture molecule, said capture molecule being fixed upon a surface of a solid support according to an array comprising at least a density of 20 discrete regions per<br>
cm2, each of said discrete regions being fixed with one species of capture molecules,<br>
-	performing a reaction, preferably a (chemical or biochemical) catalytic reaction, leading to a formation of a precipitate at the location of said binding,<br>
-	determining the possible presence of a precipitate in a discrete region preferably by the use of a scanner, and<br>
-	correlating the presence of the precipitate(s) at the discrete region(s) (precipitate pattern) with the identification and/or a quantification of said target compound in the biological sample.<br>
[0014]       The "hybridisation chips" according to the invention are any kind of solid support that allow the formation of arrays of capture molecules (specific pattern) upon one or more of its surfaces. Said solid support can be<br><br>
made of glasses, filters, electronic device, polymeric or metallic materials, etc. Preferably, said arrays contain specific locations (advantageously presented according to a specific pattern), each of them containing normally only    one species of capture molecule.<br>
[0015]       The  fixation  of  DNA  strands  on proteins thereafter  specifically  attached  to  sites  specific locations on a substrate,  is described in the document US-5,561,0 71. It is also known that capture chemicals can be linked to microtubes that are then spatially arranged in order to produce an array, as described in the document GB-3 319 838,  or  to  obtain  the  direct  synthesis  of oligonucleotides   on   specific   surfaces   by   using photolithographic techniques as described in the documents EP-0476014,    US-5,510,270,    US-5,445,934,    W097/29212, US-5,605,662, US-5,632,957 and W094/22889.<br>
[0016] All these methods for the fixation of capture molecules on the surface of a solid support in order to obtain the above-described arrays are compatible with the present invention.<br>
[0 017]       The biological target compounds according to the invention may be present in a biological (or possibly a non-biological) sample such as clinical samples extracted from blood, urine,  faeces,  saliva, pus, serum, tissues, fermentation  solutions  or  culture  media.  Said  target compounds are preferably isolated purified, cleaved, copied and/or amplified if necessary by known methods by the person skilled in the art before their detection and/or quantification upon the "hybridisation chips". [0018]        Preferably, the formation of a precipitate at the location of the binding is obtained with the fixation of a metallic compound upon the bounded target compound or by the result of a reduction of a metal in the presence of an enzyme. Advantageously, a reduction of silver in the<br><br>
presence of colloidal gold allows the formation of a precipitate at a distance not exceeding few micrometers from the bounded target compound to its capture molecule. [0019]       According  to the  invention,  the  specific locations on the array are smaller than 1000 μm  in length. These  locations  or  spots have  preferably  a  diameter comprised between 10 and 500 μm and are separated by distance of similar order of magnitude, so that the array of the solid support comprises between 100 and 250,000<br>
spots upon the surface of 1 cm2. However,  it  is also possible to prepare spots smaller as 1 μm   or less upon which the capture molecules are fixed. The formation of said  spots  or  locations  would  be  obtained  by known microelectronic or photolitographic processes and devices that allow the fixation of said capture molecules on the surface of the solid support either by a covalent linkage or  a  non-covalent  adsorption.  The  covalent  linkage technique is preferred in order to control specifically the sites of capture molecules fixation and avoid possible drawbacks that may result with several capture molecules (like nucleic acids or antibodies) that can be desorbed during incubation or washing step.<br>
[0020]       One  of  the  preferred  embodiment  is  the fixation of biological molecules like proteins, peptides or nucleic acid sequences by linkage of amino groups on activated glass bearing aldehyde moiety. The incorporation of an amine group in the nucleic acid chain is easily obtained using aminated nucleotide during their synthesis. Aminated amino acids can be fixed upon the surface of a solid  support  like  glass  bearing  aldehyde  groups  as described by Schena et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93, pp. 10614-10619 (1996)) or as described in the document US-5,605,662 and the publication of Krensky et al. (Nucleic<br><br>
Acids Research,  15, pp. 2891-2909  (1987)).  The linkage between an amino and a carboxyl group is obtained by the presence of a coupling agent like carbodiimide compounds as described by Joos et al. (Anal. Biochem. , 247, pp. 96-101 (1997)). Thiol modified oligonucleotides can be used also to obtain a reaction with amino groups upon the surface of a solid support in the presence of cross-linking molecules (Thrisey et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 24, pp. 3031-3039 (1996)). Similarly, oligonucleotides can be fixed to a gel like polyacrylamide bearing hydroxyl and aldehyde groups as described in the document US-5,552,270 and W098/28444. [0021]       The binding (or recognition) of the target compound  upon  their  corresponding  specific  capture molecules  is  a spontaneous non-covalent  reaction when performed in optimal conditions. It involves non-covalent chemical  bindings.  The  medium  composition  and  other physical and chemical factors affect the rate and the strength of the binding. For example for nucleotide strand recognition, low stringency and high temperature lower the rate and the strength of the binding between the two complementary strands. However, they also very much lower the non specific binding between two strands (which are not perfectly  complementary) .  When  several  sequences  are similar, the specificity of the binding can be enhanced by addition of a small amount of non-labelled molecules, which will compete with their complementary sequence, but much more with the other ones, thus lowering the level of cross-reactions.<br>
[0022]       The optimisation of the binding conditions is also necessary for antigen/antibody or ligand/receptors recognition, but they are usually rather specific. [0023]       A preferred embodiment of this invention is to take party of the amplification given by the catalytic<br><br>
reduction of Ag+ in the contact of other metals like gold. Gold nanoparticules are currently available and they can be easily fixed to molecules like protein. For example, streptavidin coated gold particles are available on the market.<br>
[0024]       According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, one uses .a labelled target molecule, which is then recognised by a conjugate.  This labelled molecule (biotin, haptens, ...) can be considered as a first member of the binding pair. For DNA, the labelling is easily done by incorporation of biotinylated nucleotides during their amplification. For the RNA, biotinylated nucleotides are used  for  their  copy  in  cDNA  or  thereafter  in  the amplification  step.  Amplification  of  the  nucleotide sequences is a common practice since the target molecules are often present in very low concentrations. Proteins are easily labelled using NHS-biotin or other reactions. Once the biotinylated molecules are captured, a streptavidin-gold complex, which is the second member of the binding pair, is added and the streptavidin specifically recognises biotin, so that the complex is fixed at the location where the target is fixed. If haptens are used as label, an antibody-gold complex will be used. Then a reactive mixture<br>
containing Ag+ and a reducing agent is added on the.surface and Ag layers will precipitate on the gold particles leading to the formation of crystal particles. [0025]       Direct labelling of the target molecules with gold  is  possible  by  using  gold-labelled  antigens, antibodies or nucleotides.<br>
[0026] An alternative is to avoid any labelling of the target molecule, and then a second nucleotide sequence is used which is labelled. They then formed a sandwich hybridisation or a  sandwich reaction with the capture<br><br>
molecule fixing the target and the labelled nucleotide sequence, which allows the detection to go on. Like above, the labelled nucleotide sequence is able to catalyse itself the precipitation of the metal or it does it through a second complex.<br>
[0027] The Ag precipitation corresponds to the location of the binding of biotinylated nucleotide sequence. As said location is well defined, it is possible to identify the presence of said precipitate (specific spot of the array).<br>
10028]       The  precipitate  has  the  form  of  small crystals that reach with time a diameter of about 1μm. The formation  of  these  small  crystals  represents  a  real amplification of the signal since they originated from the presence of gold particles a few nm in diameter. [0029]       Unexpectedly,  within  a  given  range  of labelled nucleotide sequences present on the surface, a concentration curve could be obtained between the gold-labelled nucleotide sequence concentration and the amount of precipitate on the surface. One constraint of the array is that the detection signal has to be correlated with the location where it originates.<br>
[0030]       Because of its granular form, the precipitate advantageously modifies the reflection of the light. It also leads  to a strong diffusion of the light  (spot detected), which is recordable by known detection means. Such diffusion assays are typically detected and recorded from the reflection of a light beam with photodiodes. One unexpected observation is that this assay for the presence of silver crystals was found unexpectedly very sensitive. [0031]       The fact that the silver precipitate appears as a black surface allows the use of a scanner (absorption of the light through the transparent surface of the array) . The presence of insoluble precipitate will absorb the<br><br>
light,   which   is   then   detected   and   recorded.    The   advantage<br>
of the  scanner is that  only a small portion of  the  array  is<br>
detected   at   one   time   so   that   a   much  better   resolution   can<br>
be   obtained.   Either  the   illumination  beam  or   the   detection<br>
surface  is   focalised and the signal  is  recorded  so that   the<br>
image    of    the    array   can   be   reconstituted.    The    detection<br>
means     (detector)     can    be    a    CCD    or    CMOS    camera,     which<br>
measures  the  overall  array.   The  resolution of   the  detection<br>
is  then dependent on the number of pixels  of  the  camera.   On<br>
the   other   end,    the   detector   can   be   constituted   of   photo-<br>
diodes   arranged   into   a   line   and   the   image   is    scanned   by<br>
moving   in   front  of   this'line.   Scanners  with   a   sensitivity<br>
of    11    μm    for    a    pixel    can    be    constructed,     which    are<br>
sufficient   to analyse  spots of  50  μm in diameter or bigger.<br>
[0032]	A   full    illumination    of    the    array   combined<br>
with a  recording of  the  light  transmitted   is   also  possible<br>
(faster than the scanner,   but seems  to be  less   sensitive) .<br>
[0033]	As   a  metal,    silver   is   able   to   reflect   light<br>
by   itself.    Even   if   the   efficiency   of   this   reflection   is low,    it   exists   and   can   be   used   in   order   to   localise   the silver   precipitate    (spots).    Because   if   its   metal   nature, other  methods   like  variations   of   an  electromagnetic   field or electric  conductance are  also possible.<br>
[0034]	Another     aspect     of     the     present      invention<br>
concerns    a    diagnostic   and/or   quantification   apparatus    of one    or    more    identical    or    different    target     compound (s) obtained   from a  sample,   said apparatus comprising:<br>
-	a  detection  and/or  quantification  device   of   precipitates (spots)     upon   the   surface    of    a    solid    support    resulting from     the     binding     of     a     target     compound     upon      its corresponding capture molecule  above-described,<br>
-	possibly a  reading device  of  information (s)   recorded upon said solid  support   (such as barcodes) ,   and<br><br>
- a computer programmed to:<br>
-	possibly recognise the discrete regions bearing capture molecules,<br>
-	collect  the  results  obtained  from  said  detection device,  possibly correlated with the information(s) obtained from said reading device, and<br>
-	carry out a diagnostic and/or quantification of said target compound(s).<br>
[0035]       Hence,   detection  resolution,   and  more particularly the reliability of the final quantification depends largely on the characteristics of the detection device. Especially, when the detection device includes a CCD camera,  the reliability depends on its number of pixels.  The number of pixels thus limits the  allowed sensitivity  of  the  quantification.  Typically,  it  is possible to obtain with a CCD a resolution of 10 μm  for a pixel, which are sufficient to analyse spots of 100 fim   in diameter or bigger. However, such quantification is limited by the number of pixels, by the resolution of each pixel and the fact that the sensitivity is given by only one view point.  One view point  depends on the  three following patterns : the position of the lecture element like CCD camera, the position of the object to be detected and the position of the lightening of the object.<br>
[0036] In order to respond to said objectives, the present invention is also related to a method (preferably dedicated to the detection and/or the quantification of a precipitate according to the invention, but not only to such precipitate) for the quantification of a volume of a precipitate (preferably containing metal crystals) upon a defined surface of a solid support, said defined surface of a solid support being defined by an array of at least 4, at least 10, at least 16, at least 2 0 or more discrete regions<br><br>
[<br><br>
per  cm2,  each  discrete  region  possibly  comprising  a precipitate. According to the invention images of said defined  surface  comprising  one  or  more  precipitates correspond to different  views,  said  images  containing analogue  informations  being  taken  by  one  or  several camera (s)  and  upon  illumination  by  one  or  several illuminant source(s) being spatially arranged relatively to each other according  to  a predetermined pattern,-  the corresponding image analogue informations of said defined surface comprising said precipitate(s) being transformed and converted into digital form or set of digital forms and compared to a first and to a second reference standard to determine  the  volume  of  the  precipitate (s)  to  be quantified.<br>
[0037] The first reference standard corresponds to the digital form or set of digital forms obtained from analogue informations contained in images taken on said surface without precipitate.<br>
[00383       The second reference standard corresponds to the digital form or set of digital forms obtained from analogue informations contained in images taken on said surface comprising precipitates of known volume. [0039]       The term "volume" should be understood to mean the  volume  for which  it  is  desired  to  obtain dimensional-type information.  In the present invention, said volume results from a chemical or biochemical reaction following a binding between a target compound and its corresponding compound. Therefore, said obtained volume is the expression of said chemical or biochemical reaction following a binding between a target compound and its corresponding capture compound.<br>
[0040]       The term "image" should be understood to mean a group of pixels which is an illustration of a measure of<br><br>
said volume and which may be directly transmitted to and registered upon a monitor such as a screen or a printer. [0041]       The present invention is also related to an apparatus comprising means for implementing said method, preferably comprising one or several sensor(s)  provided with  cameras  and  with  one  and/or  several  illuminant source(s) which are spatially arranged relatively to each other according to a predetermined pattern and which are associated with an analogue information" acquisition system, the information being measured by using said sensors and being converted into digital form by a processing unit. [0042]       Preferably the transformation and conversion are made by a processing unit on board of the camera or in a computer.<br>
[0043] The cameras are preferably mono, infrared, colour, special adjacent range CCD or CMOS cameras or similar lecture technologies.<br>
[0044]       The illuminant source is preferably an infra¬red light having a wavelength similar to the dimension of the metal crystals contained in the precipitate (s)  and which is advantageously produced by using a single diode or diodes having the same spectral distribution. [0045]       The  illuminant  sources  are  advantageously regularly spaced around the solid support, each of said    sources  corresponding to a  light  spot,  which  can  be automatically switched on simultaneously or successively. [0046]       The images are preferably obtained either by transparency, by reflection or by a combination thereof. [0047]       As illustrated in the enclosed drawings, the apparatus and method may comprise the use of one camera and one illuminant source, placed above the solid support, said camera and said illuminant source being movable in the three dimensions in space.<br><br>
[0048]       The apparatus and method may comprise also the use of two or more cameras oppositely arranged in a plane and placed above the solid support and one or more illuminant sources placed under the solid support. [0049]       The apparatus and method may comprise also the use of three or more cameras arranged according to a triangular plane or another regular or irregular pattern and placed above  the  solid  support  and one or more illuminant sources placed under the solid support. [0050]       The apparatus and method may comprise the use of one camera placed above the solid support, a first illuminant source placed above the solid support and under said camera, a second illuminant source placed under the solid support,  the two illuminant sources being placed almost symmetrically according to the position of the solid support.<br>
[0051]       Alternative  preferred  embodiments  of  the present invention are based upon the use of one or more illuminant source(s) and one or more camera(s) which may be used according to the method of the present invention, either in combination or consecutively,  said illuminant source(s) and/or said camera(s) can be maintained fixed during the lecture or can be moved according to a preferred translation or rotation movement along or around the solid support comprising the specific volume of a precipitate. [0052]       It is also possible by using one or more illuminant source (s) and/or one or more camera (s) to allow the movement of the solid support comprising a specific volume of a precipitate.<br>
[0053] Other embodiments that may be used according to the invention are apparatus comprising (i) either one camera and several illuminant sources with the different illuminant sources arranged from each other according to different symmetric or non-symmetric patterns, (ii) or one<br><br>
illuminant source and several cameras, said cameras being arranged from each other according to different symmetric or non-symmetric patterns, (iii) or a combination thereof. The illuminant is an infra-red light having a wavelength similar to the dimension of the crystals contained in the precipitate.<br>
[0054]       The person skilled in the art is also able to provide means for performing the various steps of the present invention, especially the transformation and the conversion of the major volume into digital form or a set of digital forms by using known means or methods such as the ones present in the software and computer technologies. [0055]       The present invention is also related to a computer program product  (software),  comprising program code means for performing all or part of the step of the method according to the invention, when said program is run on a computer.<br>
[0056] The present invention is related to a computer program product comprising program code means stored on a computer readable medium for performing the method according to the invention, when said program product is run on a computer.<br>
[0057] Said means are able to collect the results obtained from said detection and/or quantification device and possibly the information(s) obtained by said reading device, and said means are able to carry out a diagnostic and/or quantification of a specific target compound resulting from the analysis of said results, possibly correlated to the read information(s).<br>
[0058] Said means of this computer program product are able to obtain a discrimination between the spots and a possible detected background noise, for instance by the identification of homogeneous parts of an image after having been merged into two classes used as training sets.<br><br>
1<br>
This discrimination can be enhanced by post-classification contextual filters techniques.<br>
[0059] Said means are also able to identify the contour of the spot itself, which will be superposed to the '  original image and will allow the measure of intensity level of the counted pixels identified in the spot. [0060] The quantification means allow an integration of all pixels intensity present in the spot or a recording the overall level of intensity of the homogeneous parts of the spot.<br>
[0061] Furthermore, these means allow a statistical comparative analysis between the spots of each sample and a control or reference standard (standard target compound) or between two or more spots (preferably with a correlation with the recorded information of the solid support). Image correlation could be obtained between the spot image and said standard target compound spot image in order to discriminate spots that are statistically different in one test compared to another.<br>
[0062]        The  recorded  signal(s)  by  the  detection device and the reading device can be read, processed as electronically  computerised  data,  analysed  by  said appropriate computer program product (software). [0063]        According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the array bears fixed oligonucleotide capture nucleotide sequences so as to allow a detection, amplification and possibility quantification of nucleic acid sequences upon a same solid support. In an alternative form of execution, the array comprises fixed PCR primers in order to obtain the production of amplicons and fixation of amplicons  upon  the  surface  according  to  the  method described by Rasmussen et al.  (Anal. Biochem. , 198, pp. 138-205 (1991)) , which allows thereafter their detection.<br><br>
[0064] The array according to this invention is used in a diagnostic kit, in a diagnostic and/or quantification apparatus which allows automatic lecture, possibly after a previous treatment, such as purification, cleaving, copying and/or genetic amplification.<br>
[00653 Preferably, the detection and/or quantification apparatus according to the invention is a system that combines multiple steps or substeps within an integrated system as an automatic nucleic acid diagnostic system (the steps of purification of the nucleic acid sequences in a sample, of amplification (through known genetic amplification methods), the diagnostic and possibly the quantification).<br>
[0066] Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in the following non-limiting examples in reference to the figures.<br>
Short description of the drawings<br>
[0067] The figure 1 compares the detection of target molecules obtained on arrays composed of DNA capture nucleotide sequences covalently fixed on glass and used to detect 3 concentrations of biotinylated target DNA either in fluorescence or after silver concentration. [0068] The figures 2 to 7 represent the spatail arrangement of some elements in various embodiments of the apparatus for performing the detection and/or the quantification method according to the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Detection of DNA on biochips<br>
[0069] In this experiment, target DNA labelled is detected by direct hybridisation on capture nucleotide sequences bound to the array. Capture nucleotide sequences were covalently bound on glass and direct hybridisation<br><br>
performed with complementary biotinylated DNA. The positive hybridisation was detected with silver precipitate catalysed by the nanogold particles linked to streptavidin.<br>
Binding of capture nucleotide sequences on glass [0070] Activated glass bearing aldehyde groups were purchased from CEL Associates (USA) . Aminated capture nucleotide sequences for CMV DNA were constructed by PCR amplification of the DNA using aminated primer as described by Zammatteo et al. (Anal. Biochem. , 253, pp. 180-189 (1997)). The primers were purchased from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) . Quantification of the amplicons was done by their absorption at 260 nm.<br>
10071]	For the grafting on    gla.ss,     a solution of<br>
aminated amplicons at 0.2 μm in MES 0.1 M pH.6.5 was first heated at 100 °C for 5 min and then spotted by a robot using 250 nm  diameter pins (Genetix, UK) . After incubation<br>
of 1 h at 20 °C, they were washed with SDS solution at 0.1% and then two times with water. They were then incubated with NaBH4 at 2.5 mg/ml solution for 5 min then washed in<br>
water and heated at 95 °c for 3 min before being dried.<br>
Hybridisation of the target molecule<br>
[0072]       The  target   molecule  was  obtained  by<br>
amplification by PCR in the presence of biotinylated dUTP at 1 mM (Alexandre et al. , Biotechniques, 25, pp. 676-683<br>
(1998)). Plasmids containing the sequence of CMV virus were used for the PCR. After amplification, the PCR products were purified using a kit of high pure PCR product purification (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) and quantified by ethidium bromide staining after separation on a 2% agarose gel.<br><br>
[0073] For the hybridisation, various concentrations 0.67, 6.7 and 67 fm in 5 /il of biotinylated target DNA were added in a SSC 2X Denhard solution containing 2 0 μg of Salmon DNA. A drop of this solution (5 μl)   was added on the<br>
array and incubated for 2 h at 65 °C in a wet atmosphere. The array was then washed 4 times with a maleic acid buffer 10 mM pH 7.5, containing NaCl 15 mM and Tween 0.1%.<br>
Silver precipitation on the array • after silver precipitation<br>
[0074] The array was first incubated for 45 min with 0.8 ml of a streptavidin-colloidal gold (Sigma) diluted 1,000 times in a maleic buffer 150 mM pH 7.4 containing NaCl 100 mM and 0.1% dry milk ponder. The arrays were then washed 5 times 2 min in the maleic acid buffer 10 mM pH 7.4 containing 15 mM NaCl and Tween 0.1%. A "silver enhancement reagent" (4 0 Μ1) from Sigma was added onto the array and changed after 10 and then 5 min. After washing in the maleic buffer, the array was dried.<br>
Detection and analysis of the array<br>
[0075] The array was scanned and the digitalised image was treated with form recognition software in order to delimitate and identify the spots. The level of the pixels of each spot was integrated and a value given to each spot. The values were corrected for the background obtained in three places where no capture nucleotide sequences have been fixed.<br>
Example 2<br>
Detection of  proteins   on  biochips<br>
Fixation  of   antibodies   on  the  array<br><br>
[0075]       The glass of the  array was activated as described here above in order to obtain aldehyde groups on the surface. The antibodies used in this experiment were raised against bovine serum albumin for positive control and non specific IgG for negative control. The antibodies at 10 μg/ml   in PBS solution were spotted using the 250 fim diameter pins directly on the glass. The amino groups of the antibodies could react with the aldehyde present on the glass.  The  reaction  was  performed  for  lh  at  room temperature. The glasses were washed with a PBS buffer.<br>
Detection of bovine serum albumin by ELISA on the array [0077]       A solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 10 fig/ml   in PBS containing 0.1% casein was added on the array and incubated for 3 0 min. The array was then washed 3 times  with  PBS  containing  0.1% Tween  20  and  then incubated with a solution of biotinylated anti-BSA at 2 0 fig/ml   in PBS containing 0.1% casein. The incubation was performed  for 3 0 min.  A streptavidin-Gold complex at 1 fig/ml   was then incubated for 3 0 min in a PBS solution containing 0.1% casein. The presence of gold served as a center for silver reduction. The silver precipitation was performed with a "silver enhancement reagent" from Sigma with a change of the solution after 10 min and then again after 5 min. The glasses were then scanned and the data analysed as presented in the example here above.<br>
