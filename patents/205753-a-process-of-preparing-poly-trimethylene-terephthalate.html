*A PROCESS OF PREPARING POLY (TRIMETHYLENE<br>
TEREPHTHALATE)"<br>
E.I DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, of Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes   the  nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
PRIORITY This application claims priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60/150,580, filed August 25,1999.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) from 1,3-propanediol and a C1-C4 dialkyl terephthajate in which the levels of units from di( 1,3-propylene glycol) ("DPG") in the poly(trimethylene terephthalate) are reduced.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Preparation of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (3GT) polyester resins by (a) the transesterification of a  C1-C4 dialkyl ester of terephthalic acid with 1,3-propanediol, or by the esterification of terephthalic acid with 1,3-propanediol, followed by (b) polycondensation is well known in the art.<br>
Generally, in the transesterification reaction, a  C1-C4 dialkyl ester of terephthalic acid and 1,3-propanediol are reacted in the presence of a transesterification catalyst at elevated temperature and atmospheric pressure to form bis-(3-hydroxypropyl)terephthalate monomer, along with small amounts of oligomer and  C1-C4 monoalcohol byproduct. In the esterification reaction, terephthalic acid (TPA) and 1,3-propanediol are reacted in the optional presence of an esterification catalyst at elevated temperature and at atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure to form bis-(3-hydroxypropyl)terephthalate monomer, along with small amounts of oligomer and water byproduct. The bis-(3-hydroxypropyl)terephthalate monomer and any oligomer can then be polymerized at higher temperature under reduced pressure in The presence of a polycondensation catalyst to form the desired resin.<br>
During the process for the preparation of 3GT (transesterification, esterification and polycondensation reactions), di(l,3-propylene glycol) can be formed from intermolecular dehydration of 1,3-propanediol. This di(l ,3-propylene glycol) can be incorporated into the 3GT polymer chain which affects the properties of the resulting polymer, with respect to, for example, melting temperature, glass transition temperature, crystallinity, density, dyeablity, processability, etc. The effects of the analogous impurity, diethylene glycol (DEG), on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)<br><br>
polymer properties are well documented in the literature. For commercial grade PET the DEG levels are usually around 2-4 mol %.<br>
Processes for the preparation of polyesters, including 3GT, have been disclosed in many patents. Some disclose use of tin and titanium catalysts.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 2,465,319 mentions many types of catalysts including tin. Research Disclosure 28368 (November 1987) discloses preparation of poly(alkylene 2,6-napthalenedicarboxylate) polyesters using titanium alkoxides and dibutyl tin dilaurate, etc.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,350,871 and 3,671,379, and UK Patent Specification No. 1,075,689, Example 1, show preparation of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) from dimethyl terephthalate and trimethylene glycol using a catalyst prepared by dissolving 2.5 grams of sodium in 300 ml of n-butanol, adding 37 grams of tetrabutyl titanate, and diluting to 500 ml with n-butanol. Titanium dioxide jsjadded as a delusterant.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,166,896 describes dibutyl tin oxide as a catalyst. U.S. Patent No. 4,611,049 describes a process for producing an aromatic polyester using an organometallic catalyst selected from the group consisting of organotitanium compounds and organotin compounds, and at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of organic sulfonic acids and aliphatic carboxylic acids. Tetrabutyl titanate, tetraisopropyl titanate, dibutyl tin oxide and butylhydroxytin oxide are preferred.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,340,909 describes preparation of poly( 1,3-propylene terephthalate) using tin and titanium catalysts. Catalysts mentioned include tetrabutyl titanate, tetraisopropyl titanate, butylstannoic acid, butyltin tris (2-ethylhexoate), stannous octoate, dibutyltin tris(2-ethoIhexoate), stannous octoate, dibutyltin oxide and methylene bis(methyltin oxide). Tetrabutyl titanate is used in both control and demonstration examples.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,663,281 describes a process for preparing polyester polymers. At column 6 it states that (trans)esterification reactions from 1,4-butanediol using tetrabutyl titanate are satisfactory, but risk forming undesirable by-products, whereas with 1,3-propylene glycol the risk of forming undesirable by-products using tetraalkyl titanates as catalyst is not as great and, thus, "more traditional" catalysts such as tetrabutyl titanate and antimony oxide can be used. Monobutyl tin oxide is used to catalyze 1,4-butanediol reactions.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5798433 discloses a method of synthesizing polypropylene terephthalate using 30-200 ppm titanium in me form of an inorganic esterification catalyst containing at least-50 mole % TiO2 precipitate, blocking the esterification catalyst after esterification by adding 10-100 ppm phosphorus in the form of a<br><br>
phosphorus-oxygen compound, and then performing precondensation and polycondensation in the presence of 100-300 ppm antimony. Table 1 shows a comparative example using titanium tetrabutylate as an esterification catalyst with antimony triacetate as a polycondensation catalyst.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,872,204 describes preparation of poly( 1,3-propylene terephthalate) using ethylene glycol titanate as an esterification catalyst and polymerizing the resultant monomer in the presence of antimony acetate. At column 2 it is stated that ethylene glycol titanate does not hydrate, whereas tetrabutyl titanate does. The examples show use of ethylene glycol titanate, whereas comparative example 1 may have been directed to use of tetrabutyl titanate (compare column 12, lines 46 and 63).<br>
None of these references mention DPG formation, specify DPG levels, nor cite the impact of DPG content on polymer end use properties, and none disclose methods to minimize DPG generation during the polymer preparation processes.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,865,424 described preparation of polyesters containing low levels of diethylene glycol wherein the reaction is carried out without a titanium catalyst.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,043,335 describes preparation of polyethylene and polybutylene terephthalates (which are stated to not have high levels of undesirable by¬products) using a catalyst composition comprising a combination of a titanium-based compound, a zirconium-based compound and a phosphate-forming compound.<br>
WO 98/23662 states that the condensation polymerization of polytrimethylene terephthalate "usually generates as much as about 4 mole percent of the bis(3-hydroxypropyl) ether which, in effect, becomes a comonomer and is incorporated into the polyester chain."<br>
EP 1 016 692 and 1 016 741 describe polyester resin and fibers produced with no more than 2 weight % bis(3-hydroxypropyl) ether (DPG derived repeating unit). These documents describe use of metal catalysts such as titanium alkoxides (e.g., titanium tetrabutoxide or titanium tetraisopropoxide), antimony acetate or antimony trioxide. The preferred ester exchange catalysts are stated to be calcium acetate, magnesium acetate, zinc acetate and titanium acetate. In addition, they describe titanium, tin or antimony polycondensation catalysts, preferring titanium tetrabutoxide.<br>
All of the aforementioned documents are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br>

The invention is also directed to poly(trimethylene terephthalate) produced by the process.<br>
Other and further objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will appear more fully from the following description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) from 1,3-propanediol ("PDO") and a C1-C4 dialkyl terephthalate in which the levels of units from di(l,3-propylene glycol) ("DPG") (also known as "bis(3-hydroxypropyl) ether" or "BPE") are reduced. Such units have also been referred to as "copolymerized BPE". These units in the poly( trim ethylene terephthalate) polymer actually have the formula<br>
-(OCH2CH2CH2OCH2CH2CH20)-, but are called "DPG" herein for convenience.<br><br>
The most preferred polymer is poly(trimethylene terephthalate). Also preferred are blends and copolymers of poly(trimethylene terephthalate). The polymer of the invention contains preferably about 80% or more of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) in mole percentage. It may be modified with up to 20 mole percent of polyesters made from other diols or diacids. The other diacids include isophthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 1,3-cyclohexane iicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, 1,12-dodecane lioic acid, and the derivatives thereof such as the dimethyl, diethyl, or dipropyl esters )f these dicarboxylic acids. The other diols include ethylene glycol, 1,4-butane diol, 1,2-propanediol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,3-butane diol, 1,5-pentane diol, i,6-hexane diol, 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol, and the longer chain diols ind polyols made by the reaction product of diols or polyols with alkylene oxides.<br>
The 3GT polymers of the invention have less than 2 mole % DPG, and most preferably less than 1 mole %.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the polymers of the invention are in the range of 0.4-2.0 dl/g, preferably in the range of 0.6-2.0 dl/g and most preferably in the range of 0.7-2.0 dl/g.<br>
To achieve the object of the present invention, 3GT polyester is prepared itilizing specific ratios of reactants and in the presence of specific catalyst(s).<br>
The mole ratio (PDO: C\ to C4 dialkyl esters of terephthalic acid) of starting naterials is 1.9:1 or less, preferably 1.8:1 or less, and is preferably 1.2:1 or higher, nost preferably 1.4:1 or higher. Operation at higher molar ratios than 1.9:1 leads to ncreased amounts of DPG formed. Generally, in this embodiment iis(3-hydroxypropyI)terephthalate monomer is prepared using 10-100 ppm titanate atalyst (as titanium metal), by weight of the poly(trimethylene terephthalate).<br>
Of the various C\ to C4 dialkyl esters of terephthalic acid, dimethyl srephthalate (DMT) is preferred.<br>
The preferred titanium compounds are organic titanate compounds. Titanium etrahydrocarbyloxides, also referred to as tetraalkyl titanates herein, are presently most referred organic titanium compounds because they are readily available and effective, examples of suitable titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxide compounds include those xpressed by the general formula Ti(OR)4 where each R is individually selected from n alkyl or aryl radical containing from 1 to about 30, preferably 2 to about 18, and lost preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms per radical and each R can be the same or ifferent. Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides in which the hydrocarboxyl group contains from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms per radical which is a linear or branched alkyl radical re most preferred because they are relatively inexpensive, more readily available, and<br><br>
effective in forming the solution. Suitable titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides include, but are not limited to, titanium tetraethoxide, titanium tetrapropoxide, titanium tetraisopropoxide (also known as "tetraisopropyl titanate"), titanium tetra-n-butoxide, titanium tetrahexoxide, titanium terra 2-ethylhexoxide, titanium tetraoctoxide, and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides suitable for use in the present invention can be produced by, for example, mixing titanium tetrachloride and an alcohol in the presence of a base, such as ammonia, to form the titanium tetracarbyloxide or tetraalkyl titanate. The alcohol can be ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, or isobutanol. Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides thus produced can be recovered by first removing by product ammonium chloride by any means known to one skilled in the art such as filtration followed by distilling the titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides from the reaction mixture. This process can be carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 0 to about 150°C. Titanates having longer alkyl groups can also be produced by transesterification of those having R groups up to C4 with alcohols having more than 4 carbon atoms per molecule.<br>
The prefened transesterification catalyst in the process of the present invention is tetraisopropyl titanate (TPT). Tetraisopropyl titanate is commercially available as TYZOR® TPT from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A. ("DuPont").<br>
After the initial stage of the 3GT preparation process, di(l,3-propylene glycol) formation, the second step, polycondensation (step c) to finished polymer is carried out in the presence of any of the customarily employed polycondensation catalysts. Organic titanates are preferred. Tetraisopropyl titanate is most preferred.<br>
Polycondensation is preferably carried out using 10-100 ppm titanate catalyst (as titanium metal), by weight of the poly(trimethylene terephthalate).<br>
It is believed that the use of tetraisopropyl titanate (TPT) as both the transesterification catalyst and polycondensation catalyst leads to shortened reaction times versus the use of tetrabutyl titanate (TBT).<br>
The transesterification is customarily carried out at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range of from 150-250°C. A preferred temperature range is from 200-220°C.<br>
The polycondensation reaction is customarily carried out at reduced pressures (below 1.0 mmHg) and at temperatures of from 230-280°C. Temperatures from 240-260°C are preferred.<br><br>
Additives known in the art such as antioxidants, UV stabilizers, pigments (e.g., TiO2, etc.), flame retardants, antistats, dyes, and compounds that enhance the process, etc., may be used with this invention.<br>
Use of a phosphate or a phosphate-forming compound, such as described in EP 1 016 741, EP 1 016 692 and U.S. Patent No. 5,798,433, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, is not desirable with this invention.<br>
Use of a promoter (organic sulfonic acids and aliphatic carboxylic acids) such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,611,049, incorporated herein by reference, is unnecessary, and probably undesirable with this invention.<br>
Use of an aromatic organosphosphite and hindered phenol such as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,043,335, incorporated herein by reference, is also unnecessary.<br>
The polyesters of this invention have excellent crystallinity. The lower levels of DPG result in higher strength. These polyesters are useful in many of the end uses described in the art, particularly in fibers and yams where they provide excellent strength. They are also useful in engineering resins, films and nonwovens, etc.<br>

tightly and placing the flask on a Vortex-Genie vibrator and shaking for 30 seconds, (e) making a new solution when new digestion standard is added to the dispensette bottle.<br>
Test specimens were 1 +/- 0.1 g of polymer. With DPG levels above 2% proportionally less sample was used. The specimen was weighed to the fourth decimal, and then transferred to a reaction flask, and 3 or 4 boileezers were added. Then, 2.00 ml of Digestion Standard was added from an automatic pipet.<br>
The Reaction Flask was fit with the condenser, making sure that the ground glass joints fit tightly, and cold water flowed through the condenser jacket. The heating mantle Place around the flask, and the flask was heated at a low reflux (2-3 drops/min) for 20 +/-1 min. The Variac control reflux rate was 2-3 drops/min. The flask and condenser were removed from the heating mantle. As soon as the boiling stopped, the inside of the condenser was washed with 10 ml of 2-Propanol. The first portion of the 2-Propanol was added slowly with shaking. As soon as solid started to form in the flask, the rest of the 2-Propanol was added as rapidly as possible. The condenser was removed from the flask, and stopped with a Teflon Stopper and shaken on Vortex Shaker for a minimum of 15 seconds. The solution in the digestion flask was transferred to the centrifuge tube. The centrifuge tube was placed in the freezer [or 10 minutes, and then was centrifuged for 5 minutes or until the solid separated. The centrifuge tube was removed from the centrifuge and the clear portion of sample was transferred into the auto sample vial using a disposable pipete and then capped.<br>
The Gas Chromatograph was set up according to the manufacturer's operation manual instructions, using the following conditions. The Gas Chromatograph had an injector temperature, range of 250 ± 50 °C, a detector temperature, range of 300 ± 50 °C, and a carrier gas flow, approximately 30 ml/min. The oven temperature was 190°C for 5 minutes, then was raised to 210°C at 10 degrees/minute and held for 8 minutes. The Range was 10 and the attenuation was 2.<br>
The Integrator parameters were set in accordance with the instrument operating manual and the observed gas chromatographic curve.<br>
1.	Report unidentified peaks, no<br>
2.	Unidentified peak factor - 0.000000<br>
3.	Noise Level, set to the minimum allowed value &gt; 100<br>
4.	Sample ID - DPG<br>
5.	Subtract blank baseline - no<br>
6.	Peak reject value -1000<br>
7.	Signal to noise ratio - 5<br>
8.	Tangen peak height - 10<br>
9.	Initial peak width - 2<br><br>
The chromatographic column was conditioned before use. The column was installed in the chromatograph with the temperature at 30°C and was allowed to equilibrate for about 15 minutes. The oven temperature was increased to 225°C. The recorder was started and let to scan until a smooth and straight line was obtained. Then, the oven was set to the initial column temperature.<br>
Manual calibration was performed using the 1.25% standard solution to calibrate the method. The response factor was calculated from the last two standard<br>
solutions run using the following formula to calculate a new response factor:<br>
1.25<br>

This new Slope Factor was entered into the GC and a standard sample was run.<br>
Once the Gas Chromatograph was set up, calibrated and conditioned, approximately 1 ml of each specimen or standard was transferred to an automatic sampler vial using a disposable pipet for each specimen. The vials were placed in the sampler and the analysis was started.   Specimens were automatically run and calculated as % DPG. Then, the results were divided by sample weight.<br>
For manual DPG calculations, the DPG/BA ratio was calculated for each specimen to the nearest 0.01 unit, using the following equation:<br>
r = j/h where: r = the ratio, j = the integrated area for DPG, and h = the integrated area for BA. The DPG for each specimen was calculated to the nearest 0.01 weight %, using the following equation:<br>
P=RxF/W<br><br>
where: P = DPG, weight %, R = DPG/BA ratio, F = slope factor and W = specimen weight.<br>
The precision was C.V. 
The intrinsic viscosity was determined using a 0.4% by weight/volume solution (weight of polymer per unit volume of solution) of the polymer in 50/50 trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane using a Viscotek RTM Model Y-900 differential viscometer, at a temperature of 19°C. The viscometer is calibrated with samples of known viscosity.<br>

Table 1<br><br>
	DMT or TPA	Mole Ratio<br>
(PDO/DMT or<br>
TPA)	Catalyst	DPG Content<br>
Example 1	DMT	1.4	Tyzor® TPT	0.04%<br>
Example 2	DMT	1.8	Tyzor® TPT	0.14%<br>
Example 3	DMT	1.4	Tyzor® TPT	0.42%<br>
Comp. Expl. 1	DMT	2	Tyzor® TPT	4.0%<br>
Comp. Expl. 2	DMT	1.4	Dibutylphosphate titanium complex	3.6%<br>
In Example 1, the process of the invention required 90 minutes at 210°C for transesterification, followed by 120 minutes (at 250°C and 0.2 mm Hg) to yield a significantly higher intrinsic viscosity of 0.76 dl/g. In Example 2, with the same temperature, time and pressure conditions as in Example 1, with a higher, but yet acceptable (1.8:1), PDO:DMT ratio yielded a intrinsic viscosity of 0.96 dl/g. Example 3, a scale up of Example 1, required longer times than the smaller scale Example 1, but still yielded higher intrinsic viscosity.<br>
Comparative Example 2, with the mixed mono and dibutylphosphate titanium complex required 3.5 hours for transesterification and 7.5 hours for polycondensation to an intrinsic viscosity of 0.664 dl/g. DPG level was an unacceptably high 3.6%. The process had a longer reaction time.<br>
As illustrated in Example 3 versus Comparative Example 1, the mole ratio of 3G/DMT during the transesterification reaction leads to a large difference in the amount of DPG present in the polymer product. The higher mole ratio of 3G/DMT leads to a higher amount of DPG in the final polymer.<br>
As illustrated in Example 3 versus Comparative Example 2, the type of transesterification catalyst has been found to have a great impact on DPG generation in DMT based 3GT polymer processes. Both Tyzor® TPT and the mixed butylphosphate<br><br>
itanium complex are titanium complexes, but with different ligands attached to the itanium atom. Use of Tyzor® TPT as catalyst can significantly reduce the level of )PG in DMT based 3GT polymer, compared to using the mixed butylphosphate itanium complex as catalyst.<br>
