COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION-10 )<br>
INHALER CUM LIQUID DISPENSING CONTAINER<br>
ARIF ABDULGANI KAGZI<br>
17, AL FAROOQUE SOCIETY, JEEVRAJ PARK<br>
AHMEDABAD-380051<br>
GUJARAT<br>
INDIA<br>
The following Specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner  in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
TECHANICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is related to an inhaler cum liquid dispensing container. More particularly multi component container that combines the features of a conventional inhaler with liquid application dispenser.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
The existing practice is of having separate inhaler for slow controlled dispensing of volatile materials, drugs etc and roll-ons that are used for dispensing liquids of various viscosities. During ailments like cough, cold, nasal congestion etc the patient is likely to suffer from headaches. The patient at such times applies various medications packed in a separate container made of plastic, glass, metal etc. Since there are two separate containers being used, they are inconvenient to carry on by the person of the patient. Whereas the present invention being compact is convenient to carry in the pockets of the clothes of the patient.<br>
The conventional container may be made of glass and when such a container is dropped there are chances of breakage. In the present invention since no glass is used,<br>
There is chances of breakage.. While applying medicines on the head region or such affected areas the patient uses their fingers which need to be cleaned after the application with water cloth etc. In the present invention the roll on dispenser offers a clean and hygienic way of application of the medicines on the affected areas as the medicines can be directly applied by rolling the ball<br><br>
over the affected area. The existing practice having two separate containers the cost of the total packaging is high. The present invention attempts to offer a cost effective single unit of packaging two different medicines.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to make available two different forms<br>
of substance in a single container which are volatile substances in an inhaler<br>
and a liquid in the roll on portion<br>
Further objective of the invention is to offer convenient by providing a<br>
single pack for packing two forms of substance<br>
Further objective of the invention is to offer a cost effective solution when a<br>
single container is used<br>
Further objective of the invention is to offer a pack which is easy to carry by<br>
any person while traveling<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention consists of two sections. One section consists of an inhaler (1)<br>
and the other section consists of a Roll On dispenser. The Roll On dispenser consists of a chamber (5) that contains the liquid to be dispensed. This container is closed with a casing that contains a ball (3) that is freely rotating. During application the container is inverted so that the ball is in contact with the area where the liquid is to be applied. The ball is rubbed over the skin and this motion rotates the ball. The ball is coated with the liquid and this liquid is transferred to the skin (or any surface it comes in contact with.)<br>
The second section consists of a chamber having holes at one end and closed at the other end. The chamber contains a piece made of such<br><br>
, porous material which is impregnated with volatile material. During inhalation the volatile material passes through the holes into the nostrils of the person who is using the device.<br>
The Roll On fits into the central piece which acts as a cap to the Roll On dispenser. The inhaler is fitted to the central piece (4) at one end and closed by a cap (2)at the other end.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the multiple components are made out of plastic granules and manufactured using the injection molding process and finished and assembled manually or by using machines or tools as may be required.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides An inhaler cum liquid dispensing container comprising a bottom container having closed bottom with open top with external thread; a liquid dispenser nozzle fitted to the said open top by means of screwing or press fit; central cap means provided to the said bottom container having at one end internal thread matching with that of external thread of said open top; the said central cap means at other end having extension portion having external threads; an inhaler is screwed to the said extension portion of central cap means by providing bottom extension skirt portion with internal threads matching with that of external threads of said central cap means; and the inhaler is having at top portion number of small holes for inhaling provided with a closure means.<br>
This point describes very briefly the various components of the invention.<br>
Fig -1. shows the front view of the invention in assembled and closed<br>
condition.<br>
Fig -2 shows the Inhaler and the Inhaler cap.<br><br>
  Fig -3 shows the Bottom container with the Roll On dispenser Fig -4 shows the central piece of the invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Inhaling cum liquid dispensing container is made up of a Bottom container, Roll On dispenser, Central piece, Inhaler and Inhaler cap.<br>
Though the present invention describes a Roll On dispenser, the dispenser for liquid but could be in any form other than a Roll On such that the liquid can be contained and dispensed in quantities required.<br>
The components are made of plastic or metal or wood or paperboard or any such material suitable and can be of any shape and size. The components may be manufactured by the plastic molding process or any such manufacturing process that may be necessary to be used. In the present embodiment of the invention all the components are made of plastic.<br>
As shown in fig 1 the bottom portion is a hollow container that contains the liquid to be dispensed. The Roll On dispenser is fitted into the Bottom container. Though the present invention proposes a press type fit of Roll On dispenser into the Bottom container the same may be achieved by any other system like snap fit screw fit etc and could be of any dimension or shape. The Bottom container including the Roll On dispenser fits into the central piece. The present invention proposes a screw fit, where in there are threads on the outside of the Bottom container that fits into the threads in the Central piece. The inhaler is hollow from inside. A porous piece made of felt or such porous material is placed. The top of the inhaler has holes which act as a passage for the volatile substance. The holes could be of any shape and dimension or in any number.<br><br>
The inhaler is closed by an inhaler cap which could be a screw on type or a press fit type or a snap on type of closure system or any other system of closure. The Inhaler along with the Inhaler cap is fitted into the central piece. The inhaler, inhaler cap and the central piece can be of any dimension or shape.<br>
The present invention has given the advantage of combining the usage of two different<br>
devices and dispensing systems ( inhaler and roll on dispenser) into one offering convenience to the consumer in terms of usage and in an hygienic manner.<br><br>
I CLAIM:-<br>
1.	An inhaler cum liquid dispensing container comprising a bottom container having closed bottom with open top with external thread; a liquid dispenser nozzle fitted to the said open top by means of screwing or press fit; central cap means provided to the said bottom container having at one end internal thread matching with that of external thread of said open top; the said central cap means at other end having extension portion having external threads; an inhaler is screwed to the said extension portion of central cap means by providing bottom extension skirt portion with internal threads matching with that of external threads of said central cap means; and the inhaler is having at  top portion number of small holes for inhaling provided with a closure means.<br>
2.	An inhaler cum liquid dispensing container as claimed in claim 1 where in said liquid dispenser nozzle is having ball roll on means.<br>
3.	an inhaler cum liquid dispenser container as claimed in claims 1 and 2 where in the said bottom container, the said central cap means and the said inhaler is made out of plastic granules and manufactured using injection moulding process.<br>
4.	An inhaler cum liquid dispenser container as herein described substantially with reference to figures of accompanying drawing.<br>
