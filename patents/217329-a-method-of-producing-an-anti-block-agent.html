				<td>FILED OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process of producing an antiblock agent and the use of such in plastic film production. More specifically, the present invention relates to antiblock talc, a process for the preparation of such and its use as an additive in the production of polyolefin film. The invention also relates to a composition and use of said composition in polyolefin film.<br>
Polyolefin film produced according to the process of the present invention are useful in a broad range of packaging and film covering application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polyolefin films are used extensively for packaging and in film covering applications. The use of polyolefin films continues to increases as new market opportunities become available in areas where paper was traditionally used. The versatility of the film provides potentially infinite growth prospects for the product in the future. However, there is an inherent shortcoming in the use of plastic films that may retard its market acceptance and growth, it sticks. When plastic film is produced or used in various applications, there is a tendency for contacting layers of the film to stick together or "block" making separation of the film, opening of bags made from the film, or finding the end of the film on plastic rolls difficult. The present invention relates to polyolefin resin compositions that are specifically designed to have satisfactory antiblocking capability.<br>
Antiblock agents are materials that are added to polyolefin resins to roughen their surface and thereby prevent layers of the plastic film from sticking, hence the term antiblocking agent" is applied to such materials. Although, inorganic minerals, such as for example, diatomaceous earth, synthetic silica and talc are known to reduce blocking when added to polyolefin film resin composition, each has both advantages and critical disadvantages.<br>
One comparative advantage of diatomaceous earth is that it is known to be a<br>
moderately effective antiblocking agent, when used as an antiblocking agent.<br>
However, it is also known that diatomaceous earth adversely affects the films<br>
physical    properties,    such    as    film    clarity,    film	haze,    and    is    very<br>
abrasive and       moderately   expensive      and	may      pose      a   serious<br>
health threat. Synthetic silicates are known to be effective as an antiblock, however a significant disadvantage of silica is that it is very expensive. Talc, on the other hand, has found increasing use as an effective antiblock agent over_diatomaceous earth and synthetic silica because of a significant cost advantage over bothj However, one major disadvantage when talc is added to polyolefin film resins, is that it aggressively adsorbs other film additives, such as antioxidants, slip agents)and processing aid. The absence, or reduced level of these additives in polyolefin resin compositions during production, routinely cause processing problems and raise serious film quality concerns.<br>
For example, antioxidants are added to improve film stability, slip agents are present in the resin to improve film converting While processing aids are employed to improve film quality, and to provide lubrication during film extrusion by eliminating melt fracture.   Melt fracture is a measure of film surface uniformity, appearance and strength. Of the three additives mentioned here, processing aids are most adversely affected by the presence of antiblock agents. Although it is well known that all antiblock agents adsorb processing aids, talc antiblock agents adsorb greater levels of processing aids than either diatomaceous earth or synthetic silica antiblocks. Consequently, when resin compositions are produced having additives that include j antiblock talc, it is necessary to increase the dosage of processing aids. The increased dosage' adversely effects the over all production economics of the plastic film,.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is a new generation of talc antiblock agents that adsorb less process aids than either synthetic silica or diatomaceous earth.   <br>

Example 3       Melt fracture and die pressure performance of antiblocks<br>
Die pressure and percent melt fracture were determined for ABT® 2500 talc, ABT-G siloxane coated talc, and DE antiblocks, using tape die extrusions Percent melt fracture and die pressure data for these antiblocks throughout a one hour tape extrusion are listed below <br>
Table 3<br>
RATE OF CONDITIONING<br>
Benchmark Antiblocks   (Formula Removed)   <br>
A decrease in melt fracture of 30 percentage points and a die pressure reduction of 120psi was seen when ABT®2500 talc was treated with an amine functionalized siloxane (ABT-G)<br>
Example 4 - Commercial Talc Antiblocks<br>
In this example, commercially available MICROBLOC ® talc, POLYBLOC™ talc, and MICROTUFF® AG 101 talc antiblocks were compared with the antiblocks used in Example 3 Measurements were taken throughout a one hour tape extrusion    Percent melt fracture is found in Table 4 and die pressure data in Table 5 Table 4 RATE OF CONDITIONING/COMMERCIAL TALCS<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
MICROBLOC®, POLYBLOC™, and MICROTUFF® are trademarks of and are commercially available through Minerals Technologies Inc. - The Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10174.<br>
The siloxane coated talc (ABT-G) had a lower percentage melt fracture than the commercially available talc antiblocks. Table 5 RATE OF CONDITIONING/COMMERCIAL TALCS<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
The siloxane coated talc (ABT-G) had lower die pressure than the commercially<br>
available talc antiblocks.<br>
Example 5. - Siioxane Coated Talc Antiblocks<br>
ABT 2500® talc in addition to being coated with the amine functional silicone fluid (ABT-G)/(Genese Polymers, GP-4), was coated with an aminomodified propyltrimethoxy silane (OSI, Silquest® A-1130 silane), and a bis-(trimethoxysilylpropyl) amine (OSI, Silquesf® A-1170 silane). Tape die extrusions were used to determine melt fracture and die pressure.<br>
Tape die extrusion results are listed in Table 6 and Table 7. Table 6<br>
RATE OF CONDITIONING   Percent Melt Fracture   (Formula Removed)  <br>
SILQUEST®A-1170 and the polyacrylate coated products show lower melt fracture than the uncoated talc and performs similarly to siioxane coated (ABT-G) talc.<br>
Table 7<br>
RATE OF CONDITIONING   Die Pressure (psi)  (Formula Removed)  <br>
ABr 2500 talc coated with SILQUEST®A-1170 and the polyacrylate show reduced die pressures when comared with the uncoated ABT®2500 talc.<br>
Example 6. - Polyether Coated Talc Antiblocks<br>
This example shows the effect of polyethers as coatings for low PA talc antiblocks. ABT® 2500 talc was coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a PEG product functionalized with polar carboxylate groups, and a PEG product functionalized with less polar stearate groups. Melt fracture data is found in Table 8 and die pressure results are found in Table 9. <br>
Table 8 RATE OF CONDITIONING/POLYETHER COATINGS<br>
All three ether coated talcs had lower melt fractures than the uncoated ABT® 2500 talc. Table 9 RATE OF CONDITIONING/POLYETHER COATING  <br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
All three ether coated talcs had lower die pressures than the uncoated talc.<br>
Example 7. - Carbon Based Polymer Coated Talc Antiblocks<br>
Functionalized polyolefins and paraffins were examined for melt fracture and die pressure with respect to PA demand. The polyolefins included a maleic acid/olefin copolymer and a maleic acid/ styrene copolymer. A low molecular weight paraffin (mineral oil) and a high molecular weight paraffin (paraffin wax) were also evaluated as talc coating. The molecular weight of the paraffin is from about 80 to about 1400 a.m.u., wherein the preferred molecular weight is from about 200 to about 600 a.m.u. Melt fracture results are in Table 10 and die pressure results in Table 11.<br>

RATE OF CONDITIONING   Percent Melt Fracture <br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
All four of the talc samples coated with a carbon based polymer had lower melt fracture than the uncoated ABT®2500 talc. Paraffin wax showed a melt fracture of 15 percent after one hour. Table 11<br>
