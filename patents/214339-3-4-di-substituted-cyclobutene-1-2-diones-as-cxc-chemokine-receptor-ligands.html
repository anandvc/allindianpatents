-lELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted cyclobutenedione ;ompounds, phannaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and the use of he compounds and formulations in treating CXC chemokine-mediated diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of ;ells to attract macrophages, T-cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and jndothelial cells to sites of inflammation and tumor growth. There are two main ilasses of chemokines, the CXC-chemokines and the CO- chemokines. The class lepends on whether the first two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid CXC-chemokines) or are adjacent (CC-chemokines). The CXC-chemokines include iterleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-1 (NAP-1), neutrophil-activating rotein-2 {NAP-2), GROa, GROp, GROy, ENA-78, GCP-2, lP-10, MIG and PF4. CC hemokines include RANTES, MIP -1a, MlP-2p, monocyte chemotactic protein-t VICP-1), MCP-2, MCP-3 and eotaxin. Individual members of the chemokine families re known to be bound by at least one chemokine receptor, with CXC-chemokines enerally bound by members of the CXCR class of receptors, and CC-chemokines by lembers of the CCR class of receptors. For example, IL-8 is bound by the CXCR-1 nd CXCR-2 receptors.<br>
Since CXC-chemokines promote the accumulation and activation of sutrophils, these chemokines have been implicated in a wide range of acute and ironic inflammatory disorders including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Baggiolini t al., FEBS Lett 307, 97 (1992); Miller et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 12. 17 (1992);<br><br>
i<br>
Oppenheim et al., Annu. Fev. Immunol. 9,617 (1991); Seitz et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87, 463 (1991); Miller et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 146,427 (1992); Donnely et al.. Lancet 341,643(1993).<br>
ELRCXC chemokines including IL-8. GROa, GROp, GROy, NAP-2, and ENA-78 (Strieter et al. 1995 JBC 270 p. 27348-57) have also been Implicated in the induction of tumor angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth). All of these chemokines are believed to exert their actions by binding to the 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor CXCR2 (also known as IL-8RB), while IL-8 also binds CXCR1 (also known as IL-8RA). Thus, their angiogenic activity is due to their binding to and activation of CXCR2, and possible CXCR1 for IL-8, expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in surrounding vessels.<br>
Many different types of tumors have been shown to produce ELRCXC chemokines and their production has been correlated with a more aggressive phenotype (inoue et al. 2000 Clin Cancer Res 6 p. 2104-2119) and poor prognosis (Yoneda et. al. 1998 J Nat Cancer Inst 90 p. 447-454). Chemokines are potent chemotactic factors and the ELRCXC chemokines have been shown to Induce EC chemotaxis. Thus, these chemokines probably induce chemotaxis of endothelial cells toward their site of production in the tumor. This may be a critical step in the induction of angiogenesis by the tumor. Inhibitors of CXCR2 or dual inhibitors of CXCR2 and CXCR1 will inhibit the angiogenic activity of the ELRCXC chemokines and therefore block the growth of the tumor. This anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated for antibodies to IL-8 (Arenberg et al. 1996 J Clin Invest 97 p. 2792-2802), ENA-78 (Arenberg et al. 1998 J Clin Invest 102 p. 465-72). and GROa (Haghnegahdar et al. J. Leukoc Biology 2000 67 p. 53-62).<br>
Many tumor ceils have also been shown to express CXCR2 and thus tumor cells may also stimulate their own growth when they secrete ELRCXC chemokines. Thus, along with decreasing angiogenesis, inhibitors of CXCR2 may directly inhibit the growth of tumor cells.<br>
Hence, the CXC-chemoklne receptors represent promising targets for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents.<br>
There remains a need for compounds that are capable of modulating activity at CXC-chemokine receptors. For example, condittons associated with an increase in S^IL-8 production (which Is responsible for chemntavie of nentmnhii and T_/«OII enhcAte<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal composition can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or<br><br>
emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably the compound Is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage fomri. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>
The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 0.01 mg to about 750 mg, more preferably from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg, and most preferably from about 0.01 mg to about 250 mg, according to the particular appjication.<br>
The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 0.04 mg/day to about 4000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method treating cancer, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof, concurrently or sequentially, a therapeutically effective amount of (a) a compound of formula (I) or lA and (b) an atineoplastic agent, microtubule affecting agent or anti-angiogenesis agent.<br>

USA 94:10560-10564; Muhlradt (1997) Cancer Res. 57:3344-3346; Nicolaou (1997) Nature 387:268-272; Vasquez (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:973-985; Panda (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271:29807-29812.<br>
Particularly preferred agents are compounds with paditaxel-like activity. These include, but are not limited to paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives (paditaxel-like compounds) and analogues. Paclitaxel and its derivatives are available commercially. In addition, methods of making paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives and analogues are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,569,729; 5.565,478; 5.530,020; 5,527,924; 5,508,447; 5,489,589; 5,488,116; 5,484,809; 5,478,854; 5,478,736; 5,475,120; 5,468,769; 5,461,169; 5.440.057; 5,422,364; 5,411.984; 5,405.972; and 5.296,506).<br>
More specifically, the term "paclitaxel" as used herein refers to the drug commercially available as Taxol® (NSC number 125973). Taxol® inhibits eukaryotic cell replication by enhancing polymerization of tubulin moieties into stabilized microtubule bundles that are unable to reorganize into the proper structures for mitosis. Of the many available chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel has generated interest because of its efficacy in clinical trials against drug-refractory tumors, including ovarian and mammary gland tumors (Hawkins (1992) Oncology, 6: 17-23, Honwitz (1992) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 13:134-146, Rowinsky (1990) J. Natl. Cane. Inst. 82:1247-1259).<br><br>
■	Additional microtubule affecting agents can be assessed using one of many<br>
such assays known In the art, e.g., a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paclitaxel analogs in combination with a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis (see Lopes (1997) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 41:37-47).<br>
Generally, activity of a test compound is determined by contacting a cell with that compound and determining whether or not the cell cycle is disrupted, in particular, through the Inhibition of a mitotic event. Such inhibition may be mediated by disruption of the mitotic apparatus, e.g., disruption of normal spindle formation. Cells in which mitosis is interrupted may be characterized by altered morphology (e.g., microtubule compaction, increased chromosome number, etc.).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, compounds with possible tubulin polymerization activity are screened in vitro. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are screened against cultured WR21 cells (derived from line 69-2 wap-ras mice) for inhibition of proliferation and/or for altered cellular morphology, in particular for microtubule compaction. In vivo screening of positive-testing compounds can then be performed using nude mice bearing the WR21 tumor cells. Detailed protocols for this screening method are described by Porter (1995) Lab. Anim. ScL, 45(2):145-150.<br>
Other methods of screening compounds for desired activity are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically such assays involve assays for inhibition of microtubule assembly and/or disassembly. Assays for microtubule assembly are described, for example, by Gaskin et al. (1974) J. Molec. Biol., 89: 737-758. U.S. Patent No. 5,569,720 also provides in vitro and in vivo assays for compounds with paclitaxel-like activity.<br>
Methods for the safe and effective administration of the above-mentioned microtubule affecting agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the "Physicians" Desk Reference" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742, USA); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of formula (I) or lA and the chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation therapy will be regulated<br><br>
according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the disease being treated. A dosage regimen of the compound of formula (I) or lA can be oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day, preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, more preferably 50 to 600 mg/day, in two to four (preferably two) divided doses, to block tumor growth. Intermlttant therapy (e.g., one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks) may also be used.<br>
The chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be administered according to therapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled In the art that the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be varied depending on the disease being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy on that disease. Also, in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be varied in view of the observed effects of the administered therapeutic agents (i.e., antineoplastic agent or radiation) on the patient, and in view of the observed responses of the disease to the administered therapeutic agents.<br>
In the methods of this invention, a compound of formula (I) or lA is administered concurrently or sequentially with a chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation. Thus, it is not necessary that, for example, the chemotherapeutic agent and the compound of formula (I) or lA, or the radiation and the compound of formula (I) or lA, should be administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously. The advantage of a simultaneous or essentially simultaneous administration is well within the detemnination of the skilled clinician.<br>
Also, in general, the compound of formula (I) or lA and the chemotherapeutic agent do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. For example, the compound of formula (I) or lA may be administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered intravenously. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the<br><br>
art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician .<br>
The particular choice of a compound of formula (I) or lA, and chemo-therapeutic agent and/or radiation will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgement of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.<br>
The compound of formula (I) or lA, and chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the proliferative disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation to be administered in conjunction (i.e., within a single treatment protocol) with the compound of formula (I) or lA .<br>
If the compound of formula (I) or lA, and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation are not administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, then the Initial order of administration of the compound of formula (I) and lA, and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, may not be important. Thus, the compound of fonmula (I) or lA may be administered first, followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation; or the chemo-therapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first, followed by the administration of the compound of formula (I) or lA. This altemate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.<br>
For example, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first, especially If it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continued with the administration of the compound of formula (I) or lA followed, where determined advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on until the treatment protocol Is complete.<br>
Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physidan can modify each protocol for the administration of a component (therapeutic agent-i.e., the compound of formula (I) or lA. chemotherapeutic agent or radiation) of the treatment according to the individual patient"s needs, as the treatment proceeds.<br><br>
The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radio-logical studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.<br>

Compounds of formula (I) or lA may be produced by processes known to those skilled in the art in the following reaction schemes and in the preparations and examples below.<br>
A general procedure for the preparation of compounds of formula I or lA is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The remaining partner required for the synthesis of the final target is prepared by condensing an aryl amine with the commercially available diethyisquarate to give the aminoethoxysquarate product. Subsequent condensation of this intermediate with the aminobenzamide prepared earlier provides the desired chemokine antagonist (Scheme 1).<br>
Scheme 2<br>
Alternatively, the aminobenzamide of Scheme 1 is first condensed with commercially available diethyisquarate to give an alternate monoethoxy intermediate. Condensation of this Intermediate with an amine gives the desired chemokine antagonist.<br>

Benztriazole compounds of Formula (I) or lA are prepared by stirring nitrophenylenediamines with sodium nitrite in acetic acid at 60°C to afford the nitrobenzotriazole intermediate (Scheme 3). Reduction of the nitro group in the presence of palladium catalyst and hydrogen atmosphere provides the amine compound. Subsequent condensation of this intermediate with the aminooethoxysquarate prepared eariier (Scheme 1) provides the desired chemokine antagonist.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
Condensation of nitrophenylenediamines with anhydrides or activated acids at reflux (Scheme 4) affords benzimidazole intermediates which after reduction with hydrogen gas and palladium catalyst and condensation with the aminoethoxysquarate previously prepared (Scheme 1) affords benzimidazole chemokine antagonists.<br><br>
