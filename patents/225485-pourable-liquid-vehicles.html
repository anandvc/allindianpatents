Application Serial No. 60/153,260, filed September 11,1999.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a pourable liquid vehicle.<br>
Concentrated levels of polyoxyalkylene block copolymers are useful in vehicles<br>
incorporated into products that are designed to deliver compositions, materials and substances to<br>
moistened surfaces and aqueous environment Acquiring moisture during use, the vehicle<br>
becomes sufficiently transformed from a liquid to a gel-like form that provides the a benefit to the<br>
user. For example, mucosal surfaces of the body contain sufficient water to allow the pourable<br>
liquid vehicle comprising concentrated polyoxyalkylene block copolymers to be effectively<br>
delivered to the desired site wherein the accompanying compositions, materials and substances<br>
tenaciously adhere to the moistened surfaces and resist dissolution or erosion by water or<br>
biological fluid. Such uses include, but are not limited to the delivery of personal health care<br>
compositions, formulations and compounds including, but not limited to, Pharmaceuticals (OTC<br>
and prescription), nutrients and the like.<br>
In the discipline of pharmaceutical compositions there are a wide variety of dosage<br>
forms. Examples include tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups, liquid-filled capsules, suspensions,<br>
coated tablets or capsules for administration by mouth; gels, rinses, dentifrices, lozenges, sprays,<br>
medicated lollipops, liquid filled capsules for intra-oral administration; gels, suspensions or<br>
solutions for intra-ocular or intra-aural administration; suppositories and douches or enemas for<br>
intra-rectal or vaginal administration; and creams, ointments, gels, lotions and patches for topical<br>
application on the skin and scalp; and liquid suspension or solutions for injection by syringe,<br>
nasal gels, solutions, or suspensions for application into the nose with special applications or<br>
sprayers.<br>
The majority of these compositions are in the physical form of a fluid having a viscosity<br>
ranging from pourable liquids to stiff gels. Pourable liquids are often preferred since they are in<br>
The majority of these compositions are in the physical form of a fluid having a viscosity<br>
ranging from pourable liquids to stiff gels. Pourable liquids are often preferred since they are in<br>
the best form to be administered. For example, only liquids, or perhaps low viscosity gels, can be<br>
injected through a syringe, or poured from a bottle into a medicine cup, or drawn up into a<br>
syringe or medicine dropper, or squeezed from a dropper bottle into the eye or ear, or atomized<br>
into the nasal cavities, fa addition to the compatibility with pharmaceutical administration<br>
devices and with the mode of introduction into the body, it is often desirable for the composition<br>
to easily spread after application without the aid of manual action or devices. The eye drop<br>
compositions, for example, need to spread over the surface of the eye, as do swallowed liquids<br>
intended to coat the throat, esophagus, or stomach. This is similarly true of rectal enemas or<br>
vaginal douche compositions.<br>
In many cases, however, pharmaceutical dosage forms in form of pourable liquids are not<br>
necessarily desirable since once administered, such pourable liquids are easily removed from the<br>
intended treatment site. In such circumstances the therapeutic advantage of the composition may<br>
be significantly diminished or even lost completely. It is appropriate, therefore, to surmise mat<br>
for the purpose of being retained at the targeted site, it may be desirable for a particular<br>
pharmaceutical composition to be more viscous, even in the form of a gel mat is not readily<br>
flowable. It is, however, difficult or even impossible to administer such a viscous composition to<br>
its intended site to do the most good. For example, serious injury could occur when attempting to<br>
spread a gel on the surface of one's eye using a finger or more elaborate applicators. More<br>
problematic is coating the stomach lining, as this site is simply not accessible using simple self-<br>
administer applicators.<br>
There is, therefore, a need for pharmaceutical compositions mat are "smart"; that is,<br>
capable of being administered in a pourable liquid that are converted or transformed after<br>
administration into a vehicle having sufficient viscosity to essentially remain at the targeted site.<br>
Such compositions require a built-in chemical or physical triggering mechanism(s) that respond<br>
to conditions after application in or on a surface including the body.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attempts to develop such compositions have been ongoing for a significant period of<br>
time. Examples of such compositions include intra-ocular dosage forms as disclosed in Edsman,<br>
K., Carlfors, J., Petersson, R., Rheological Evaluation of Poloxamer as an in situ Gel for<br>
Ophthalmic Use. European Journal of Pharmaceutics Vol. 6 pp. 105-112 (1998) herein<br>
incorporated by reference. Compositions such as these are broadly described as primarily<br>
aqueous solutions of block co-polymer surfactants, other wise referred to as "poloxamers", that<br>
are commonly known in the art. When formulated in water as somewhat concentrated solutions,<br>
or with water and co-solvents, the poloxamer solution remains as a pourable liquid. The most<br>
commonly reported example of this type of system consists of poloxamer 407 at concentrations<br>
ranging from about 10% to 35% by weight of the composition in water. These compositions are<br>
administered at room temperature as liquids. They form a gel upon reaching body temperature.<br>
The trigger for converting these compositions to a gel, therefore, is body heat.<br>
In situ gelation of pharmaceutical compositions based on poloxamer that are biologically<br>
triggered are known in the art. For example Kim, C.K., Lee, S.W., Choi, H.G., Lee, M.K., Gao,<br>
Z.G., Kim, I.S., and Park, KM.: Trials of In Situ Gelling and Muqoadhcsjve Acetaminophen<br>
Liquid Suppository in Human Subjects. International Journal of Pharmaceutics vol. 174, pp. 201-<br>
207 (1998) incorporated herein by reference. Kim et al. discloses liquid suppositories for<br>
enhancing absorption of the pain and fever relieving drug acetaminophen.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,256,396, issued October 26, 1993, to Colgate Palmohve Company,<br>
incorporated herein by reference, describes similar compositions containing poloxamer 407 and<br>
water at specified concentrations. Other products utilizing bio-triggers include those comprising<br>
poloxamer 407 at ranges preferably 12% to 17%. When combined with pharraaceutically active<br>
agents, these compositions are injected into the gingival space between the root of a tooth and the<br>
gum.<br>
Poloxamers represent a large family of polymers that vary in molecular weight as well as<br>
in the percentage or portion of the block copolymer mat is considered hydrophobia<br>
Compositions comprising other poloxamers from this family having similar liquid/gelling<br>
characteristics are somewhat predictable, lacking only in the understanding of the required<br>
concentration of poloxamer. While there is a large number of uses for such compositions, they<br>
all rely on the same general mechanism of temperature-induced gelation of aqueous poloxamer<br>
dispersions. Compositions known in the art are found to be inadequate, however, as the gel<br>
structure readily dissolves in aqueous environments.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention covers pourable liquid vehicles used to deliver compositions,<br>
materials and substances to moistened surfaces and aqueous. The benefits of compositions<br>
formulated with such pourable liquid vehicles include retention of the compositions, materials<br>
and substances on the moistened surface. This in turn allow for effective delivery of a desired<br>
compositions, materials and substances in the vehicle that acts on targeted surface, resisting<br>
erosion or run-off even in an aqueous environment. Such pourable liquid vehicles have a number<br>
of utilities for delivery of all kinds of materials including but not limited to cleaning and treating<br>
surfaces of objects as well as biological or living organisms, including living creatures.<br>
Another object of this invention is to utilize such pourable liquid vehicles to deliver<br>
health care compositions and materials and substances to living creatures, particularly mammals,<br>
and roost particularly humans. Even another object of the present invention is to develop a<br>
method for effective delivery of health care compositions, materials and substances.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
Terms useful herein are defined below. Additionally, terms used in the art, as well as<br>
general concepts, are further described in Schramm, The Language of Colloid and Interface<br>
Science. American Chemical Society, (1993), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The term "pourable liquid" as used herein means the physical state of the compositions<br>
of the present invention prior to formation of a gel.<br>
The term "moistened surface" as used herein means any living or non-living surface<br>
having sufficient moisture in or on it to trigger rapid conversion of a pourable liquid to a gel.<br>
The term "in situ gelation" as used herein means the conversion of a pourable liquid to a<br>
gel at a designated site or surface.<br>
As used herein, the term "gel" describes the substance resulting from the combination of<br>
the pourable liquid and water, or bodily fluid containing mostly water. The gel is sufficiently<br>
viscous to remain at the site applied to, or ultimately targeted for, over a period of time sufficient<br>
for the compositions, materials and substances in the gel to bring about a desired result at the site<br>
they are delivered to.<br>
The term "triggering device" as used herein means an stimulus external to the<br>
composition that induces the conversion of a pourable liquid to a gel.<br>
The term "shear" as used herein is the rate of deformation of a fluid when subjected to a<br>
mechanical shearing stress. In simple fluid shear, successive layers of fluid move relative to each<br>
other such that the displacement of any one layer is proportional to its distance from a reference<br>
layer. The relative displacement of any two layers divided by their distance of separation from<br>
each other is termed the "shear" or the "shear strain". The rate of change with tone of the shear<br>
is termed the "shear rate".<br>
A certain applied force is needed to produce deformation in a fluid. For a plane area<br>
around some point in the fluid and in the limit of decreasing area the component of deforming<br>
forces per unit area that acts parallel to the plane is the "shear stress".<br>
The "viscosity" of a viscous material, also called viscosity index, is defined as the ratio<br>
of the shear stress applied into the material, divided by the rate of shear which remits. Materials<br>
of a higher viscosity have a higher resistance to flow, or to forces which can induce flow, than a<br>
lower viscosity material. All viscosities listed herein are at a shear rate of about 50 per second<br>
unless otherwise indicated. All of the rheologic characteristics given herein can be measured in a<br>
controlled rate or a controlled stress rotational viscometer capable of some operation in a<br>
controlled rate mode, for Example Haake RS ISO by Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany;<br>
Cammed CSL 500 Controlled Stress Rheometer by TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware; and<br>
Rheometric SR5, by Rheometric Scientific, Piscataway, NJ.<br>
Specifically, when subject to constant shearing rate of about 50 per second at normal<br>
ambient temperature (approx. 25°C), the present liquid compositions have a viscosity of less than<br>
aboyt 7 pascal seconds, preferably less than about 2 pascal seconds, more preferably less than<br>
about 1 pascal seconds.<br>
The value of a composition's triggered viscosity ratio ("T") is useful in determining the<br>
degree to which a composition exhibits the above described gelling characteristic. The formula<br>
and procedure for determining the triggered viscosity ratio is set forth below.<br>
It is desirable for the compositions of the present invention to exhibit a triggered<br>
viscosity ratio of at least about 1.3, preferably at least about 2, more preferably at least about 5,<br>
and most preferably at least about 10 wherein the triggered viscosity is defined by the following<br>
formula or ratio:<br>
T=hs/hc<br>
where hs= viscosity of the gel and<br>
where hc= viscosity of the pourable liquid<br>
The pourable liquid vehicle of the present invention must be selected and formulated so<br>
that the contacting and mixing said vehicles to a mucosal surface of the body, or with some other<br>
fluid in the body, triggers the conversion of the pourable liquid vehicle to a more viscous gel-like<br>
mixture. Examples of these fluids are saliva, gastric fluid, intestinal fluid, extracellular fluid<br>
present under the skin at the site of a subcutaneous injection, or in muscle tissue at the site of an<br>
intramuscular injection, cerebrospinal fluid, vaginal fluid, fluid exudate from an open wound or<br>
ulcer, tear fluid, rectal fluid, or any other bodily fluid of an animal which contains in large<br>
measure water. In other words, after the pourable liquid vehicle contacts with the bodily fluid,<br>
the viscosity of the pourable liquid vehicle becomes greater than the viscosity of either the<br>
pourable liquid vehicle itself prior to mixing, or the bodily fluid alone.<br>
The triggered viscosity ratio of a pourable liquid vehicle can be determined by one<br>
skilled in the art using appropriate viscosity measuring instruments, and is exemplified by the<br>
following method. First, the viscosity of the pourable liquid vehicle (hc is determined in a<br>
rheometer using a shear rate of 50 per second at 25°C. For the determination of h6 1 ml of the<br>
pourable liquid vehicle is placed onto the plate of a Haake RS150 rheometer. The temperature is<br>
controlled in the range of typical room temperature, about 25oC. A cover is used on the<br>
measuring system and a solvent-saturated atmosphere provided to prevent evaporation of water,<br>
cthanol, or other volatile components from the sample during the test A 35 mm diameter parallel<br>
plate measuring system is lowered onto the sample, leaving a gap of about 1 millimeter, and an<br>
equilibration shearing of approximately 10 per second is applied for 10 seconds. Then, a<br>
constant shearing rate of 50 per second is applied for 30 seconds. The viscosity hc is read from<br>
the instrument at the 30 second time point.<br>
For the determination of hs, two dilutions of the pourable liquid vehicle are made with<br>
water. The first dilution is made to contain 75% by weight of the pourable liquid vehicle, and<br>
25% by weight of additional water. The second dilution is made to contain 50% by weight of<br>
pourable liquid vehicle and 50% by weight of additional water. The pourable liquid vehicle and<br>
water are combined in a vial and a tight seal applied to prevent evaporation of components. The<br>
vial contents are mixed in an unusual manner, by repeated centrifugation. This is necessary since<br>
some of the combinations are very viscous gels. Specifically, the vials are centrifuged (using for<br>
example a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge, available from Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) 20<br>
minutes at 3000 RPM and 25°C for at least four separate centrifuge runs. After each run the vials<br>
are inverted. Additional runs are conducted in the centrifuge to ensure complete mixing. 1 ml of<br>
the gelled sample is then loaded onto the plate of the same rheometer used for the measurement<br>
of %, except that the temperature is controlled at the normal body temperature of a human, 37oC.<br>
An identical rheometer measurement program is used as for determination of hf. The triggered<br>
viscosity factor for both the 25% and 50% dilution of the sample is calculated from % and T|, as<br>
described by the formula above. These two dilutions have been found to be useful for measuring<br>
the gelling functionality of the pourable liquid vehicles of the invention in a standardize method,<br>
because some of the pourable liquid vehicles may require a greater or lesser amount of water in<br>
order to trigger the gelling character. The use of other water dilutions for determination of hc,<br>
ranging from about 5% up to about 70%, would also be expected to provide a demonstration of<br>
the unique, gelling character of the invention, but the diluiton which yields a maximal value of T<br>
vines depending upon the exact pourableTiquid vehicle being tested.<br>
All percentages of the components comprising the invention are herein refer to the their<br>
weight in of the pourable liquid vehicle as a whole.<br>
The present invention is a pourabk liquid vehicle comprising:<br>
(a) from about 26% to about 100% polyoxyalkylene block copolymer;<br>
(b) from about 0% to about 70% glycol; and<br>
(c) from about 0% to about 50% water;<br>
wherein said vehicle is used to deliver compositions, materials and substances to moistened<br>
surfaces and aqueous environments said vehicle has a viscosity value hc less than or equal to 7<br>
pascal-seconds and the value T greater man or equal to about 1.3.<br>
Polvoxvalkvlene Block Copolvmcr<br>
Polyoxyalkylene block copolymer herein referred to as "poloxamers" are nonionic block<br>
copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide corresponding to the following structure:<br><br>
wherein x, y, and x' have a value wherein said vehicle has a viscosity value hc less than or equal<br>
to 7 pascal-seconds and the value T greater than or equal to about 1.3. Preferable<br>
polyoxyalkylene block copolymors useful in the present invention include wherein x has a value<br>
from about 1 to about 130, y has a value from about 1 to about 72 and x' has a value from about 0<br>
to about 130, wherein the average molecular weight of said copolymer is from about 3000 to<br>
about 15,000. More preferred is where x equals 37, y equals 58 and x' equals 37 and has a<br>
average molecular weight of 6500. Most preferred is wherein x equals 100, y equals 70 and x'<br>
equals 100 and has an average molecular weight of about 12,600;<br>
The poly(oxyethylene) segment is hydrophilic and the poly(oxypropylene) segment is<br>
hydrophobic. The level of the poloxamers useful in the present invention ranges from about 26%<br>
to about 100%, preferably from about 27.8% to about 95%, more preferably 30% to about 90%<br>
by weight of the pourabk liquid vehicle. In other words, providing the poloxamcr has the critical<br>
viscosities above, it can be used itself or when combined with other compositions, materials and<br>
substances.<br>
A family of poloxamers are available and vary in the number of blocks, the overall<br>
average molecular weight, and in the percentage of the molecule which is hydrophilic. A block<br>
refers to a single polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene segment. Di-block and tri-block<br>
polymers have been described. In the case of tri-block copolymers, the blocks can be arranged in<br>
the format of one polyoxypropylene block surrounded by 2 polyoxyethylene blocks, that being<br>
the most common poloxamer structure, or alternatively as one polyoxyethylene block surrounded<br>
by 2 polyoxypropylene blocks, the latter sometimes referred to as a reverse poloxamer.<br>
Poloxamers are available under the trade names of Lutrol, Monolan, or Pluronic. The chemical<br>
structure, synthesis, and properties have been described [(poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(propylene<br>
oxide)] block copolymer surfactants, Paschalis Alexandridis, Current Opinions in Colloid and<br>
Interface Science. Vol 2, pp. 478-489 (1997) herein incorporated by reference.<br>
For applications in the health care area, compositions embodying the present invention<br>
utilize a specific group of pharmaceutically acceptable block copolymers or poloxamers. These<br>
poloxamers are selected from the group consisting of Pluronic F127, P105, F108 and mixtures<br>
thereof, all available from BASF Corp.<br>
Glycols<br>
In addition to the poloxamers, it is desirable in some of the pourable liquid vehicles of<br>
the present invention to combine glycols with the poloxamers for controlling the viscosity of the<br>
pourable liquid vehicles. These glycols permit the pourable liquid vehicle to remain pourable<br>
while containing very high levels of the poloxamer so that administration is convenient, or so that<br>
the composition can readily pass through the bore of a syringe or other dosing apparatus.<br>
Additionally, these glycols provide solvent capacity for pharmaceutical actives or other<br>
composition components. The level of glycols in the present invention is from about 0% to about<br>
70%, preferably from about from about 10% to about 70% and most preferably from about 7% to<br>
about 62% of the pourable liquid vehicle.<br>
Glycols are low molecular weight mono- and polyols and are selected from the group<br>
consisting of monosaccharides such as glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose); disaccharides such<br>
as sucrose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose and other sugars, ribose, glycerin, sorbitol, xylitol, inositol,<br>
propylene glycol, galactose, mannose, xylose, rhamnose, glutaraldehyde, invert sugars, ethanol,<br>
honey, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and mixtures thereof. Preferred glycolsare selected<br>
from the group consisting of ethanol, glycerol and propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Absolute ethanol is available from Aaper Alcohol &amp; Chemical Co., Shelbyville, KY<br>
Water<br>
In addition to the poloxamers, and, or the glycol, it is desirable in some of the pourable<br>
liquid vehicles of the present invention to include water. Water is useful at a level from about<br>
0% to about 50%, preferably abort 1% to about 46%, most preferably from about 2% to about<br>
41% of the pourable liquid vehicle.<br>
Preferred Embodiments<br>
Preferred embodiments of ibe present invention utilizing the combination of poloxamers,<br>
polyols and water include the following:<br>
1. from about 26% to about 65% Pluronic F127, from about 22% to about 38% ethanol<br>
and from about 8% to about 45% water.<br>
2. from about 52% to about 60% Pluronic F108, from about 20% to about 25% ethanol<br>
and from about 17% to about 27% water.<br>
3. from about 25% to about 50% Pluronic P105, from about 45% to about 65%<br>
propylene glycol and from about 5% to about 20% water.<br>
4. from about 37% to about 77% Pluronic P105, from about 12% to about 28% ethanol,<br>
and from about 10% to about 45% water<br>
5. from about 26% to about 49% Pluronic F127, from about 2% to about 12% ethanol,<br>
from about 30% to about 68% propylene glycol, and from about about 7% to about<br>
40% water.<br>
