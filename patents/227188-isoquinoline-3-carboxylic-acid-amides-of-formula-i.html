lsoquinoline-3-carboxylic Acid Amides and their Use as Pharmaceuticals<br>
The present invention relates to novel isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid amides having a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonistic activity, their preparation, their use as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br><br>
wherein R, and R2, independently, are hydrogen, (CM)alkyl, halogen, hydroxy, (C^Jalkoxy, di(CM)alkylamino, (C^alkylthio, cyano or trifluoromethyl, R3 is hydrogen or (Ci^alkyl and n is 1 or 2, in free base or acid addition salt form.<br>
Halogen denotes fluorine, bromine, chlorine or iodine.<br>
Any alkyl, alkoxy or alkylthio groups are branched or straight chain groups. They are preferably methyl, methoxy or methylthio groups, n is preferably 2.<br>
On account of the asymmetrical carbon atom(s) present in the compounds of formula I and their salts, the compounds may exist in optically active form or in form of mixtures of optical isomers, e.g. in form of racemic mixtures. All optical isomers and their mixtures including the racemic mixtures are part of the present invention.<br>
(S)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl-amino and (S)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-3-yl-amino compounds are preferred.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of the compounds of formula I and their salts, comprising the step or reacting a compound of formula II<br><br><br>
wherein R3 and n are as defined above, and recovering the resulting compound of formula I in free base or acid addition salt form.<br>
The reaction can be effected according to conventional methods, e.g. as described in the examples.<br>
Working up the reaction mixtures according to the above processes and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures.<br>
Acid addition salts may be produced from the free bases in known manner, and vice versa.<br>
Compounds of formula I in optically pure form can be obtained from the corresponding racemates according to well-known procedures. Alternatively, optically pure starting materials can be used.<br>
The starting compounds of formula II may be obtained by conventional methods e.g. by nxidation of compounds of formula IV or V<br><br><br>
wherein Rt and R2 are as defined above, according to conventional methods.<br>
The starting materials of formula III, IV and V are known or may be obtained from known compounds, e.g. as described in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter referred to as agents of the invention, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro and in animals, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.<br>
In particular, the agents of the invention are <x7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists.></x7>
In functional assays, the agents of the invention display high affinity at the a7 nAChR as shown in the following tests:<br>
a)	A functional assay for affinity at a7 nAChR is carried out with a rat pituitary cell line stably expressing the a7 nAChR. As a read out, the calcium influx upon stimulation of the receptor is used. In this assay, agents of the invention exhibit pEC50 values of about 5 to about 8.<br>
b)	To assess the selectivity of the agents of the invention, a similar functional assay is carried out using a human epithelial cell line stably expressing the neuronal oc4|32 nAChR subtype. In this assay, agents of the invention display no or little activity at the a4(32 nAChR.<br>
c)	To assess the selectivity of the compounds of the invention, similar functional assays as described under a) are carried out with a human epithelial cell line stably expressing the<br><br>
ganglionic nACHR subtype or a cell line endogenously expressing the muscle type of nicotinic receptors. In these assays, agents of the invention display no or little activity on the ganglionic and muscle type of nicotinic receptor subtypes.<br>
In the model of mice showing sensory gating deficit (DBA/2-mice) described by S. Leonard et al. in Schizophrenia Bulletin 22,431-445 (1996), the agents of the invention induce significant sensory gating at concentrations of about 10 to about 40 ^M.<br>
The agents of the invention are therefore useful for the treatment of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, mania, depression and anxiety, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other intellectual impairment disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), cognitive dysfunctions and memory deficits; Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, furthermore for the treatment of pain, epilepsy and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. The usefulness in inflammatory disorders is based on the finding that a-7 agonists reduce TNF release from macrophages, as reported in Wang et al., Nature,2002:421, 384. The usefulness of a7 nAChR agonists in neurodegeneration is also documented in the literature, e.g. in Wang et al., J. bid. Chem. 275, 5626-5632 (2000).<br>
For the above-mentioned indications, the appropriate dosage will of course vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 1 to about 500, preferably from about 5 to about 300 mg of an agent of the invention conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in sustained release form.<br>
The agent of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions.<br><br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides an agent of the invention, for use as a pharmaceutical, e.g. for the treatment of any condition mentioned above.<br>
The present invention furthermore provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be manufactured in conventional manner. Unit dosage forms contain, for example, from about 0.25 to about 150, preferably from about 1 to about 25 mg of a compound according to the invention.<br>
Moreover the present invention provides the use of an agent of the invention, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any condition mentioned above.<br>
In still a further aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment of any condition mentioned above, in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering to such subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the invention.<br>
