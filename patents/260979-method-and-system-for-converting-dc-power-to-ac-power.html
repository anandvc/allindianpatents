METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONVERTING DC POWER TO AC<br>
POWER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to power inverters, and<br>
more particularly relates to methods and systems for converting DC power to<br>
AC power.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical and drive<br>
systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles, such as<br>
hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles<br>
typically use an electric motor, perhaps in combination with another<br>
actuator, to drive the wheels.<br>
[0003] Many of the electrical components, including the electric motors,<br>
used in such vehicles receive electrical power from alternating current (AC)<br>
power supplies. However, the power sources (i.e., batteries) used in such<br>
applications provide only direct current (DC) power. Thus, devices known<br>
as power inverters are used to convert the DC power to AC power, which<br>
often utilize several of switches, or transistors, operated at various intervals<br>
to convert the DC power to AC power.<br>
[0004] In recent years, "z-source" inverters have been developed which<br>
have several advantages over conventional power inverters. For example,<br>
due to the impedance source (e.g., including one or more inductors) included<br>
therein, z-source inverters have the ability to produce an output voltage that<br>
is greater than or less than the voltage of the DC power provided. However,<br>
conventional methods, such as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), used to<br><br>
control the switches within the inverters cause a ripple current to pass<br>
through the inductors with a relatively low frequency. As a result, very<br>
large and expensive inductors must be used in such power inverters, as the<br>
required size of the inductors is proportional to the frequency of the ripple<br>
current.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method and system for<br>
converting DC power to AC power that allows for the use of smaller and<br>
less expensive inductors. Furthermore, other desirable features and<br>
characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical<br>
field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] In one embodiment, a method for converting direct current (DC)<br>
power to alternating current (AC) power is provided. A first phase of the<br>
AC power is generated based on a first carrier signal. A second phase of the<br>
AC power is generated based on a second carrier signal.<br>
[0007] In another embodiment, a method for operating a multi-phase<br>
motor through a power inverter having a pair of switches for each phase of<br>
the motor is provided. A first carrier signal is generated, and a first<br>
modulation signal is generated. The first carrier signal and the first<br>
modulation signal jointly determine a first waveform. A first pair of the<br>
switches in the power inverter is operated based on the first waveform. A<br>
second carrier signal is generated, and a second modulation signal is<br>
generated. The second carrier signal and the first modulation signal jointly<br>
determine a second waveform. A second pair of the switches in the power<br>
inverter is operated based on the second waveform.<br>
[0008] In a further embodiment, an automotive drive system is provided.<br>
The automotive drive system includes a direct current (DC) power supply,<br><br>
an electric motor, a power inverter, and a processor. The DC power supply<br>
is coupled to the electric motor. The power inverter includes first and<br>
second pairs of switches and is coupled to the electric motor and the DC<br>
power supply to receive DC power from the DC power supply and provide<br>
alternating current (AC) power to the electric motor. The processor is in<br>
operable communication with the electric motor, the DC power supply, and<br>
the power inverter. The processor is configured to generate a first carrier<br>
signal, operate the first pair of switches in the power inverter based on the<br>
first carrier signal, generate a second carrier signal, and operate the second<br>
pair of switches in the power inverter based on the second carrier signal.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0017] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed<br>
or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background,<br>
brief summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0018] The following description refers to elements or features being<br>
"connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly stated<br>
otherwise, "connected" means that one element/feature is directly joined to<br>
(or directly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means<br>
that one element/feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or<br>
indirectly communicates with) another element/feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. However, it should be understood that although two elements<br>
may be described below, in one embodiment, as being "connected," in<br>
alternative embodiments similar elements may be "coupled," and vice versa.<br>
Thus, although the schematic diagrams shown herein depict example<br>
arrangements of elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features,<br>
or components may be present in an actual embodiment. It should also be<br>
understood that FIGS. 1-7 are merely illustrative and may not be drawn to<br>
scale.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 to FIG. 7 illustrate a method and system for converting<br>
direct current (DC) power to (AC) power. A first phase of the AC power is<br>
generated based on a first carrier signal. A second phase of the AC power is<br>
generated based on a second carrier signal. In one embodiment, the<br>
generating of the first phase comprises operating a first set of switches in a<br>
power inverter based on the first carrier signal, and the generating of the<br><br>
second phase comprises operating a second set of switches in the power<br>
inverter based on the second carrier signal.<br>
[0020] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 10, or "automobile," according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10 includes a chassis<br>
12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control system (or<br>
electronic control unit (ECU)) 18. The body 14 is arranged on the chassis<br>
12 and substantially encloses the other components of the automobile 10.<br>
The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly form a frame. The wheels 16<br>
are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12 near a respective corner of the<br>
body 14.<br>
[0021] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The vehicle 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines (or actuators), such as, for<br>
example, a gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle"<br>
(FFV) engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous<br>
compound (e.g., hydrogen and/or natural gas) fueled engine, or a fuel cell, a<br>
combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an electric motor.<br>
[0022] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the<br>
automobile 10 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly<br>
(or powertrain) 20, a battery 22, a power inverter (or inverter) 24, and a<br>
radiator 26. The actuator assembly 20 includes an internal combustion<br>
engine 28 and an electric motor/generator (or motor) system (or assembly)<br>
30. The electric motor system 30, in one embodiment, includes one or more<br>
sinusoidally-wound, three-phase alternating current (AC) motor/generators<br>
(or motors) (e.g., permanent magnet or induction) such as commonly used in<br>
automotive vehicles (e.g., traction drive control systems, and the like). As<br>
will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, each of the electric motors<br><br>
includes a stator assembly (including conductive coils), a rotor assembly<br>
(including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). The<br>
stator assembly and/or the rotor assembly within the electric motors may<br>
include multiple (e.g., sixteen) electromagnetic poles, as is commonly<br>
understood.<br>
[0023] Still referring to FIG. 1, and as described in greater detail below,<br>
the combustion engine 28 and the electric motor system 30 are integrated<br>
such that both are mechanically coupled to at least some of the wheels 16<br>
through one or more drive shafts 32. The radiator 26 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail,<br>
includes multiple cooling channels therethough that contain a cooling fluid<br>
(i.e., coolant) such as water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze) and is<br>
coupled to the engine 28 and the inverter 24. Referring again to FIG. 1, in<br>
the depicted embodiment, the inverter 24 receives and shares coolant with<br>
the electric motor 30. The radiator 26 may be similarly connected to the<br>
inverter 24 and/or the electric motor 30.<br>
[0024] The electronic control system 18 is in operable communication<br>
with the actuator assembly 20, the battery 22, and the inverter 24. Although<br>
not shown in detail, the electronic control system 18 includes various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module and a vehicle controller, and at least one<br>
processor and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in<br>
another computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and<br>
methods as described below.<br>
[0025] Referring to FIG. 2, a voltage source inverter system (or electric<br>
drive system) 34 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The voltage source inverter system 34 includes a<br>
controller 36, the inverter 24 coupled to an output of the controller 36, the<br>
motor 30 coupled to a first output of the inverter 24, and a modulator 38<br>
having an input coupled to a second output of the inverter 24 and having an<br><br>
output coupled to an input of the controller 36. The controller 36 and the<br>
modulator 38 may be integral with the electronic control system 18 shown in<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
[0026] FIG. 3 illustrates the inverter 24 of FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater<br>
detail. The inverter 24 includes a three-phase circuit coupled to the motor<br>
30. More specifically, the inverter 24 includes a switch network having a<br>
first input coupled to a voltage source Vdc (e.g., the battery 22) and an output<br>
coupled to the motor 30. Although a single voltage source is shown, a<br>
distributed direct current (DC) link with two series sources may be used.<br>
[0027] The switch network comprises three pairs (a, b, and c) of series<br>
switches with antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch)<br>
corresponding to each of the phases. Each of the pairs of series switches<br>
comprises a first switch, or transistor, (i.e., a "high" switch) 40, 42, and 44<br>
having a first terminal coupled to a positive electrode of the voltage source<br>
22 and a second switch (i.e., a "low" switch) 46, 48, and 50 having a<br>
second terminal coupled to a negative electrode of the voltage source 22 and<br>
having a first terminal coupled to a second terminal of the respective first<br>
switch 40, 42, and 44.<br>
[0028] In one embodiment, the inverter 24 is a "z-source" inverter, as is<br>
commonly understood, and includes an impedance source 52 coupled<br>
between the battery 22 and the first, second, and third pairs of switches,<br>
which includes an inductive component (or at least one inductor) and a<br>
capacitive component (or at least one capacitor). In the depicted<br>
embodiment, the inductive component includes a split inductor having a first<br>
inductive portion 54 and a second inductive portion 56, each of which has<br>
first and second sides. The first inductive portion 54 is connected between<br>
the first switches 40, 42, and 44 and the positive electrode of the battery 22.<br>
The second inductive portion 56 is connected between the second switches<br>
46, 48, and 50 and the negative terminal of the battery 22.<br><br>
[0029] The capacitive component includes a first capacitor 58 and a<br>
second capacitor 60 connected in an "X" configuration to the first and<br>
second inductive portions 54 and 56. That is, the first capacitor 58 has a<br>
first terminal connected to the first side of the first inductive portion 54 and a<br>
second terminal connected to the second side of the second inductive portion<br>
56. The second capacitor 60 has a first terminal connected to the second<br>
side of the first inductive portion 54 and a second terminal connected to the<br>
first side of the second inductive portion 56. In the depicted embodiment,<br>
the inverter 24 also includes an additional switch 62, which may be similar<br>
to the switches 40 - 50, and is used to allow a higher voltage to be<br>
maintained on inverter side of the DC bus.<br>
[0030] In accordance with aspects of this particular invention, during<br>
operation, still referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle 10 is operated by providing<br>
power to the wheels 16 with the combustion engine 28 and the electric motor<br>
assembly 30 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion engine 28<br>
and the electric motor assembly 30 simultaneously. In order to power the<br>
electric motor assembly 30, DC power is provided from the battery 22 to the<br>
inverter 24, which converts the DC power into AC power, before the power<br>
is sent to the electric motor 30. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the<br>
art, the conversion of DC power to AC power is substantially performed by<br>
operating (i.e., repeatedly switching) the switches 40 - 50 within the inverter<br>
24 at a "switching frequency," such as, for example, 12 kilohertz (kHz).<br>
[0031] Referring again to FIG. 2, generally, the controller 36 produces<br>
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals for controlling the switching action<br>
of the inverter 24. In a preferred embodiment, the controller 36 preferably<br>
produces continuous PWM (CPWM) signals where each upper and lower<br>
switch conducts for a portion of each switching cycle of the inverter 24. The<br>
inverter 24 then converts the PWM signals to a modulated voltage waveform<br>
for operating the motor 30.<br><br>
[0032] FIG. 4 graphically illustrates the PWM signals generated by the<br>
controller 36 (and/or the modulator 38) for operation of the switches 40-50,<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown,<br>
three separate carrier signals and three separate modulation signals are<br>
generated, each for a respective pair of the switches (a, b, and c) shown in<br>
FIG. 3. In particular, the controller 36 (and/or modulator 38) generates a<br>
first carrier signal 64, a first modulation signal 66, a second carrier signal<br>
68, a second modulation signal 70, a third carrier signal 72, and a third<br>
modulation signal 74. In one embodiment, the controller 36 also generates a<br>
high shoot-through modulation signal 76 and a low shoot-through modulation<br>
signal 78.<br>
[0033] As will be described in greater detail below, each set of a carrier<br>
signal and a modulation signal, along with the shoot-through modulation<br>
signals 76 and 78, may be combined to generate a "high" waveform 80 and<br>
a "low" waveform 82. It should be noted that the waveforms 80 and 82<br>
shown in FIG. 4 correspond to the first carrier signal 64 and the first<br>
modulation signal 66. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the<br>
three separate sets of carrier signals and modulations signals increases the<br>
frequency of the ripple current flowing through the inductive component<br>
within the inverter 24, as indicated by the ripple current 84 also represented<br>
in FIG. 4.<br>
[0034] For sake of clarity, each of FIGS. 5, 6, and 7 graphically<br>
illustrate only one set of the carrier and modulation signals in addition to the<br>
shoot-through modulation signals 76 and 78, along with the associated<br>
waveforms. FIG. 5 shows the first carrier signal 64 and the first modulation<br>
signal 66. As is apparent in FIG. 5, the high waveform 80 is in a "high" or<br>
"on" state when the first modulation signal 66 has an amplitude that is<br>
greater than the first carrier signal 64 and/or whenever the first carrier signal<br>
64 passes beyond the shoot-through carrier signals 76 and 78. The high<br>
waveform 80 shown in FIG. 5 is used to control the first, or high, switch 40<br><br>
in the first pair (a) of switches in the inverter 24. The low waveform 82 is<br>
in a high or on state when the first modulation signal 66 has an amplitude<br>
that is less than the first carrier signal 64 and/or whenever the first carrier<br>
signal 64 passes beyond the shoot-through carrier signals 76 and 78. The<br>
low waveform 82 shown in FIG. 5 is used to control the second, or low,<br>
switch 46 in the first pair (a) of switches in the inverter 24.<br>
[0035] FIG. 6 shows the second carrier signal 68 and the second<br>
modulation signal 70. In a manner similar to that described above, a high<br>
waveform 86 and a low waveform 88 are formed from the second carrier<br>
signal 68 and the second modulation signal 70, along with the shoot-through<br>
carrier signals 76 and 78. The high waveform 86 shown in FIG. 6 is used to<br>
control the first switch 42 in the second pair (b) of switches in the inverter<br>
24, and the low waveform 88 shown in FIG. 6 is used to control the second<br>
switch 48 in the second pair (b) of switches in the inverter 24.<br>
[0036] FIG. 7 shows the third carrier signal 72 and the third modulation<br>
signal 74. In a manner similar to that described above, a high waveform 90<br>
and a low waveform 92 are formed from the third carrier signal 72 and the<br>
third modulation signal 74, along with the shoot-through carrier signals 76<br>
and 78. The high waveform 90 shown in FIG. 7 is used to control the first<br>
switch 44 in the third pair (c) of switches in the inverter 24, and the low<br>
waveform 92 shown in FIG. 7 is used to control the second switch 50 in the<br>
third pair (c) of switches in the inverter 24.<br>
[0037] As is commonly understood, the waveforms 80, 82, 86, 88, 90,<br>
and 92, as well as the corresponding operation of the switches, determine the<br>
output voltages of the different legs of the inverter 24, and thus the voltages<br>
applied across the windings within the motor 30. As such, the operation of<br>
the each of the pairs of switches (a, b, and c) generates a respective phase of<br>
the AC power sent to the motor 30.<br>
[0038] One advantage of the method and system described above is that<br>
because of the separate and interleaved carrier signals that are used to<br><br>
operate each pair of switches (or each phase of the motor), the ripple current<br>
frequency in the inductive component in the inverter is increased. In one<br>
embodiment utilizing a three-phase motor, the frequency of the ripple current<br>
is tripled (e.g., to 72 kHz) compared to using a single carrier signal for all<br>
three phases (24 kHz or twice the carrier frequency of 12 kHz). Therefore,<br>
the size of the inductive component within the inverter may be reduced (e.g.,<br>
to 1/3 of its size when a single carrier signal is used).<br>
[0039] Other embodiments may utilize the method and system described<br>
above in implementations other than automobiles, such as watercraft and<br>
aircraft. The electric motor and the power inverter may have different<br>
numbers of phases, such as two or four. Other forms of power sources may<br>
be used, such as current sources and loads including diode rectifiers,<br>
thyristor converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors, and/or any combination<br>
thereof.<br>
[0040] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast<br>
number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>
