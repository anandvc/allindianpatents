				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
POLYURETHANE FOAM COMPOSITION AND POLYURETHANE FOAM OBTAINED FROM<br>
THE COMPOSITION AND USE THEREOF [TECHNICAL FIELD] <br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a polyurethane foam composition containing a plant-derived polyol, a polyurethane foam obtained from the composition and the use thereof. More particularly, the present invention directs to a plant-derived polyurethane foam composition capable of providing a polyurethane foam that attains hardness and ball rebound suitable for a cushioning material used for a seat cushion for vehicles and the like and excellent durability in a balanced manner, a plant-derived polyol suitable for the composition, a plant-derived polyurethane foam obtained from the composition and the use thereof. [BACKGROUND ART] <br>
[0002]<br>
From the viewpoint of reducing environmental burdens in recent years, plant-derived resins obtained from plant resources have been demanded instead of petroleum-derived resins produced using petroleum resources as raw materials. That is, since plant-derived resins are made from raw materials obtained from plants, which absorb carbon dioxide in the air to grow by<br><br>
photosynthesis, no net increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide results even if carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere on incineration of the used resin, namely such resins correspond to so-called carbon-neutral materials. Therefore, plant-derived resins draw attention as materials contributing to reducing environmental burdens.<br>
 [0003]<br>
Meanwhile, a flexible polyurethane foam, which is one of resin articles, is widely used for a seat cushion for vehicles such as automobiles and in other applications owing to the excellent cushioning property.  The seat cushion is required to provide a comfortable cushioning feeling to sit on, that is, an appropriate hardness and ball rebound so as to neither too hard nor too soft.  Further, it is also required to have excellent durability such that small changes are merely caused in elasticity, hardness and thickness of the seat cushion even after long-term use. [0004]<br>
As polyol components used as raw materials of polyurethane foams, there have been known so far a polyether polyol and a polyester polyol derived from petroleum as representative examples, and further it has also been known to use castor oil, which is derived from a plant, and a castor oil-based polyol, which is a castor oil derivative.  For example, Patent Document 1<br><br>
discloses that castor oil is reacted with an aromatic diisocyanate to form a prepolymer and then the prepolymer is reacted with water to form a polyurethane foam.  Patent Document 2 discloses a method for producing polyurethane foams by using a castor oil derivative such as hydrogenated castor oil as an additive. Meanwhile, Patent Document 3 discloses the use of an ester group-containing condensate having an average molecular weight of 900 to 4500 produced from ricinoleic acid, which is a main component of a castor oil fatty acid, and a monohydric or polyhydric alcohol, as an internal release agent in producing a flexible polyurethane molded article which may be fine porous. Patent Document 4 discloses the use of a polyester polyol comprising a carboxylic acid unit (A) and a polyhydric alcohol unit (B), wherein the carboxylic acid unit (A) at least partially contains a unit (a) of an oxycarboxylic acid oligomer in which a hydroxy-containing carboxylic acid such as a castor oil fatty acid is condensed to form a dimer or a higher oligomer, as a component of a urethane-based paint composition. [0005]<br>
However, the polyurethane foam described in Patent Document 1 is a hard polyurethane foam, and this method cannot provide a polyurethane foam having appropriate hardness and ball rebound, particularly a flexible polyurethane foam having suitable properties for a cushioning material used for a seat cushion for<br><br>
vehicles. Further, in the process described in Patent Document 2, the castor oil-based polyol is used as an additive and the amount added is 0 .1 to 15% by weight with respect to a polyhydroxy compound. Particularly, in Examples, the content of the castor oil-based polyol is only 5% of the whole polyol component, and the document describes effects only for curability and a low compression set, while there is no description for the effect that the polyurethane foam in which a resin structure is formed from the castor oil-based polyol exhibits appropriate hardness, ball rebound and durability in a balanced manner. Moreover, in Patent Documents 3 and 4, a castor oil-based polyol having a higher molecular weight is used compared to that used in Patent Documents 1 and 2. However, in Patent Document 3, the castor oil-based polyol is used only as an internal release agent, and, Patent Document 4 discloses only a paint composition. Any proceses described in these Patent Documents cannot provide a plant-derived polyurethane foam having properties demanded in market as described above. Thus, there has not been known a plant-derived polyurethane foam that is produced by using a plant-derived polyol as the polyol component and attains appropriate hardness and ball rebound and excellent durability in a balanced manner.<br>

[0030]<br>
A polyurethane foam having appropriate ball rebound, elongation percentage and hardness suitable for a cushioning material can be formed by using a plant-derived polyester polyol having the above range of condensation ratio of a<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid having 15 or more carbon atoms to a polyhydric alcohol. The "polyol having a structure in which, for example, 3 to 30 mol of the hydroxycarboxylic acid are condensed with 1 mol of a polyhydric alcohol" includes also a polyol obtained by condensing 3 to 30 mol of the hydroxycarboxylic acid with 1 mol of the polyhydric alcohol (for a mixture of two or more polyhydric alcohols, as the total). <br>
[0031]<br>
There may also be used a polyol in which a hydroxycarboxylic acid having 15 or more carbon atoms is condensed with a fat/oil having a hydroxyl group such as castor oil so as to have a structure in which 3 to 30 mol of the hydroxycarboxylic acid are condensed with 1 mol of a polyhydric alcohol. <br>
[0032]<br>
As the polyhydric alcohol, there may be mentioned a diol having 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and 1,4-cyclohexanediol; a triol having 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as trimethylolpropane and glycerin; a tetraol such as diglycerin and pentaerythritol; a hexaol such as dipentaerythritol; sugars such as glucose, sorbitol, dextorose, fructose and sucrose, and derivatives thereof; and phenols having two or more hydroxyl groups such as bisphenol A.

In particular, a fatty acid having 15 to 20 carbon atoms is preferred. Among these, more preferred are a saturated or unsaturated hydroxy-containing fatty acid isolated from a natural fat/oil such as castor oil, Dimorphotheca oil, Lesquerella oil and Lesquerella densipila seed oil; and a hydrogenated derivative of such an unsaturated fatty acid.  Particularly preferred is a fatty acid containing ricinoleic acid or 12-hydroxystearic acid as a main component.

[0034]<br>
When the hydroxycarboxylic acid is condensed with the<br>

Of these methods, the former is preferably used.<br>
 [0035]<br>
As the lactone, there may be mentioned a ß-lactone such as ß-propiolactone, a δ-lactone such as -kutyrolacton, a δ-lactone such as δ-valerolactone, an -lactone such as  -caprolactone. ß-Propiolactone and  -caprolactone are preferred.<br>
 [0036]<br>
As the hydroxycarboxylic acid having a primary hydroxyl group, there may be mentioned a ring-opened product of the above lactone, such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid.<br>
For the plant-derived polyol (A), wide variety of plant-derived raw materials may be used besides the above-mentioned raw materials. There may be mentioned, for example, glucose, which is mainly obtained from starch, lactic acid, which is a derivative of the glucose, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, succinic acid, 1,4-butanediol, a mixture or derivative thereof and the like.  Further, there may be also used cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are obtained from wood, and a<br><br>
derivative thereof; sebacic acid, which is a derivative of a castor oil fatty acid, and a derivative thereof; and the like. <br>
[0037]<br>
In the present invention, the acid value of the plant-derived polyol (A) is preferably 0.1 to 10 mgKOH/g, more preferably 0.3 to 8 mgKOH/g, and particularly preferably 0.5 to 5 mgKOH/g. The hydroxyl value is preferably 20 to 160 mgKOH/g, more preferably 30 to 100 mgKOH/g, and particularly preferably 40 to 80 mgKOH/g. [0038] (B) Low-monol polyol<br>
The low-monol polyol (B) used in the present invention is a polyol commonly used for production of polyurethane foams, and it has no other particular limitations as long as its overall degree of unsaturation is 0.050 meq/g or less, preferably 0.040 meq/g or less, and more preferably 0.030 meq/g or less. The lower limit of the overall degree of unsaturation is not particularly limited, for example, 0.001 meq/g. A modified product of the low-monol polyol (B) may be also used. These low-monol polyols (B) may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more. [0039]<br>
Preferred low-monol polyol (B) include a polyether polyol having an overall degree of unsaturation within the above range (hereinafter, also referred to as "polyether polyol (Bl)"), a<br><br>
modified product thereof and the like.  These low-monol polyols may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
 [0040] (Polyether polyol (Bl))<br>
As the polyether polyol (Bl), there may be mentioned an oligomer or a polymer that is obtained by performing ring-opening polymerization of an alkylene oxide with an active hydrogen-containing compound as a starting material, usually, in the presence of a catalyst, and that has an overall degree of unsaturation within the above range. <br>
[0041]<br>
In general, it is known that when ring-opening polymerization of an alkylene oxide with a starting material is performed in the presence of a catalyst during producing a polyether polyol, a monol having an unsaturated group at the terminal of the molecular fragment is generated as a byproduct with the increase in molecular weight of the polyether polyol. The monol content is typically represented as an overall degree of unsaturation of a polyether polyol, and the smaller value indicates the lower content of the monol. <br>
[0042]<br>
The monol in the polyether polyol, because it has a lower molecular weight than the polyether polyol which is a main component, causes a much wider molecular weight distribution and<br>
a reduced average functionality to the polyether polyol. When such a polyether polyol having a high content of monol is used for producing a polyurethane foam, the resultant polyurethane foam suffers from deterioration of various properties such as increase in hysteresis loss, decrease in hardness, deterioration of expandability, reduction of durability and reduction of curability. Here, the durability specifically refers to a wet heat compression set, which is an index representing a degree of decrease in thickness over long-term use as a cushion, and the like. [0043]<br>
Further, as the monol content in a polyether polyol increases, more lattice defects are formed in the polyurethane foam obtained from this polyether polyol to decrease the crosslinking density, resulting in a tendency of increasing the swelling degree of the polyurethane foam in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide.  In general, regarding the relationship between the swelling degree and the crosslinking density, there is used the Flory-Rehner's equation in "Principle of Polymer Chemistry", Cornell University Press (1953), written by P. J. Flory, while the relationship between the monol content and the swelling degree in polar organic solvents is disclosed in "A Raw Materials System Concept for Wider Ranging Demands of Flexible Polyurethane Molded Foam" Polyurethane Expo 2002<br><br>
Conference Proceedings (2002) , pp. 75-82, written by Osaka et al. and the like.<br>
[0044]<br>
Therefore, the content of the monol, which causes the deterioration of various properties of the polyurethane foam as mentioned above, is preferably smaller.<br>
(Catalyst)<br>
There can be produced a polyether polyol (Bl) having a low overall degree of unsaturation as mentioned above, that is, a low-monol content, for example, at least by using at least one compound selected from a compound having a nitrogen-phosphorus double bond, cesium hydroxide and rubidium hydroxide, as a catalyst. When the above compound is used as a catalyst, the amount of the monol generated as a byproduct can be reduced, as compared to the case where a conventional publicly-known alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide is used as a catalyst, resulting in improvement of various properties of the obtained polyurethane foam.  For example, when an alkali metal hydroxide was used as a catalyst, it was difficult to attain appropriate hardness and ball rebound and excellent durability in a balanced manner. In contrast, these properties can be attained well when the above compound is used as a catalyst. The excellent effects of the low-monol polyol are particularly apparent when used together with a plant-derived polyol, which typically contains<br><br>
impurities and is often inferior in performance compared to a<br>
polyol of petroleum origin. [0045]<br>
The compound having a nitrogen-phosphorus double bond, although not particularly limited to, includes compounds described in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. Hll-106500, 2000-297131 and 2001-106780, among which a phosphazenium compound is preferred. [0046] (Active hydrogen-containing compound)<br>

[0086]<br>
As the additives, there may be mentioned the additives described in "Polyurethane" 8th printing, Maki Shoten (1964) , pp. 134-137, edited by Nobutaka Matsudaira and Tetsuro Maeda, "Functional Polyurethane" 1st printing, CMC Inc. (1989), pp. 54-68, edited by Hitoshi Matsuo, Noriaki Kunii and Kiyosi Tanabe, and the like.<br>
[0087]<br>
[Polyurethane foam]<br>
As the process for producing the polyurethane foam of the present invention, there may be adopted conventional publicly-known production methods as appropriate without any<br>
particular limitation. Specifically, there may be adopted any of a slab foaming process, a hot cure mold foaming process and a cold cure mold foaming process. In producing a seat pad for vehicles such as automobiles, a cold cure mold foaming process is preferred. <br>
[0088]<br>
As the process for producing the polyurethane foam by a cold cure mold foaming process, a publicly-known cold cure mold process may be adopted. For example, a polyurethane foam having a given shape may be obtained as follows: a resin premix is prepared by premixing the specific polyol and/or the specific polymer polyol, water, the catalyst, the surfactant, and optionally the other polyols and the other auxiliaries, and then this resin premix and the polyisocyanate are blended, typically using a high-pressure foaming machine or a low-pressure foaming machine, so that the given NCO index is obtained, followed by injecting this mixture into a mold and performing reaction, foaming and curing. [0089]<br>
The curing time is typically 30 sec to 30 min, the mold temperature is usually from room temperature to approximately 80°C, and the curing temperature is preferably from room temperature to approximately 150°C.  Further, after curing, the cured material may be heated at a temperature range of 80 to 180°C to such an extent that the objective and effects of the present<br><br>
invention are not impaired. [0090]<br>
The resin premix is typically mixed with the polyisocyanate using a high-pressure foaming machine or a low-pressure foaming machine. When a hydrolizable compound such as an organotin catalyst is used as a catalyst, in order to prevent the organotin catalyst from contacting with water, it is preferred that water and the organotin catalyst are injected each other through different paths into the foaming machine and mixed in the mixing head of the foaming machine. The viscosity of the resin premix used is preferably 2500 mPa-s or less considering the ease in mixing in the foaming machine and the moldability of a foam. [0091]<br>
In this way, there can be obtained a plant-derived polyurethane foam that contributes reducing environmental burdens and attains appropriate hardness and ball rebound and excellent durability in a balanced manner. The appropriate ranges for hardness and ball rebound and the range for excellent durability of a polyurethane foam typically depend on the application. <br>
[0092]<br>
For example, for a foam used in a seat cushion for vehicles such as automobiles, in which the core density is typically in the range of 40 to 75 kg/m3, the appropriate range for hardness,<br><br>
as represented by 25% ILD, is preferably 140 to 280 N/314cm2 and more preferably 200 to 260 N/314cm2. The appropriate range for ball rebound is preferably 45 to 75% and more preferably 55 to 70%. The range for excellent durability, as represented by the wet heat compression set, is preferably 14% or less and more preferably 12% or less. <br>
[0093]<br>
For a foam used in a seat back for vehicles such as automobiles, in which the core density is typically in the range of 23 to 45 kg/m3, the appropriate range for hardness, as represented by 25% ILD, is preferably 60 to 180 N/314cm2 and more preferably 80 to 160 N/314cm2.  The appropriate range for ball rebound is preferably 30 to 60% and more preferably 35 to 55%. The range for excellent durability, as represented by the wet heat compression set, is preferably 24% or less and more preferably 22% or less.<br>
 [0094]<br>
The term "to attain the appropriate ranges for hardness and ball rebound and the range for excellent durability in a balanced manner" means that the desired ranges are simultaneously satisfied for all the three properties: hardness, ball rebound and durability. <br>
[0095]<br>
The polyurethane foam of the present invention can be<br>
suitably used as a cushioning material. Particularly, it can be suitably used as a seat pad in a seat cushion or a seat back for vehicles such as automobiles.<br>
[0096]<br>

[Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7]<br>
Flexible polyurethane foams were produced using the polyether polyols and the polymer polyols, which were synthesized in Synthesis Examples, by the cold cure mold foaming process. Assuming that the flexible polyurethane foam is used for a seat cushion for vehicles such as automobiles, the core density was set in the range of 57.5 to 58.8 kg/m3. There were used the following polyisocyanate, crosslinking agent, cell opener, surfactant and catalyst:<br>
 [0126]<br>
Polyisocyanate 1: Cosmonate TM-20 (produced by Mitsui Chemicals Polyurehtanes, Inc.; a mixture consisting of 80 parts of a mixture of 2,4-toluylene diisocyanate and 2,6-toluylene diisocyanate in a mass ratio of 80:20 and 20 parts of<br><br>
polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanate); [0127]<br>
Crosslinking agent 1: Actcol KL-210 (produced by Mitsui Chemicals Polyurethanes, Inc.; hydroxyl value: 850 mgKOH/g);<br>
Cell opener 1: Actcol EP-505S (produced by Mitsui Chemicals Polyurethanes, Inc.; hydroxyl value: 52 mgKOH/g);<br>
Surfactant 1: Silicon-based surfactant L-5366 (produced by Nippon Unicar Company Limited); and <br>
[0128]<br>
Catalyst 1: Amine catalyst Minico R-9000 (produced by Katsuzai Chemicals Corp.; l-isobutyl-2-methylimidazole). (Formulations and results of evaluation for foaming)<br>
A resin premix was prepared by mixing the components listed in Table 4. The polyisocyanate was mixed with the resin premix in an amount equivalent to the NCO index listed in Table 4, and the mixture was immediately injected into a mold which had an inside dimension of 300 mm * 300 mm * 100 mm and of which the temperature was adjusted to 60°C in advance, and the mixture was foamed after closing the cover.  Thermal curing was performed at 100°C in a hot air oven for 5 min to obtain a flexible polyurethane foam by the cold cure mold foaming process. The properties of the obtained flexible polyurethane foams are shown in Tables 4 and 5.<br><br>

 [0131]<br>
As is seen in Tables 4 and 5, the flexible polyurethane foams obtained in Examples 1 to 7 are excellent in any of hardness, ball rebound, wet heat compression set and elongation percentage, as compared to those of Comparative Examples 1 to 7 . Particularly, for the flexible polyurethane foams obtained in Examples 1 to 7, three properties that are hardness, ball rebound and wet heat compression set are simultaneously within the ranges suitable for the application to a seat cushion for vehicles such as automobiles. That is, it is proved that the plant-derived polyurethane foam of the present invention can exhibit durability and appropriate hardness and ball rebound in a balanced manner and has suitable properties for a plant-derived cushioning material that can contribute to reducing environmental burdens. <br>
[0132]<br>
Further, the polyurethane foam obtained in Comparative Example 7 exhibits even poorer balance among the appropriate hardness and ball rebound and the durability. This is because the content of the plant-derived polyol in the composition increases upto 30% by mass compared with that in Comparative Example 1. In contrast, for the flexible polyurethane foam<br><br>
obtained in Example 7, even when the content of the plant-derived polyol in the composition is increased up to 30% by mass compared to that in Example 1, the three properties that are hardness, ball rebound and wet heat compression set are simultaneously within the ranges suitable for the application to a seat cushion for vehicles such as automobiles. That is, the plant-derived polyurethane foam of the present invention can attain durability and appropriate hardness and ball rebound in a balanced manner even when the amount of the plant-derived polyols is increased, and hence it is useful as a cushioning material with greater contribution to reducing environmental burdens.<br>
[Industrial Applicability] [0133]<br>
The polyurethane foam composition of the present invention can provide a plant-derived polyurethane foam that contributes to reducing environmental burdens and attains appropriate hardness and ball rebound and excellent durability in a balanced manner, and is useful for a cushioning material and the like.  Particularly, the polyurethane foam composition can be suitably used as a seat pad of a vehicle seat cushion or of a vehicle seat back in automobiles and the like.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
