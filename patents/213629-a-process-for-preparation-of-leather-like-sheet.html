				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of leather like sheet.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
leather like sheet using fabric and solid wastes generated during leather<br>
manufacture. The process of the invention has enormous potential application in<br>
leather processing industry for utilizing some of the solid wastes for making value<br>
added sheet and the sheet prepared thereby is envisaged to have application<br>
potential as excellent raw material in variety of consumer product industries.<br>
Significant quantities of solid wastes are generated during leather processing. As<br>
reported by Muralidharan et.al (Leather Research Industry Get-together Pre<br>
prints, pp 1-8, 1996 ) for every one gm. of hide processed, only 0.5 gm. of<br>
finished leather is obtained, which implies nearly 50% of leather forming material<br>
emanates as wastes. These wastes include raw hide trimmings, hair, fleshings,<br>
tanned leather trimmings, shavings and buffing dust. While raw hide trimmings<br>
and fleshings are being used for preparation of glue and gelatin, the tanned<br>
trimmings and shavings have been in use for manufacture of leather boards,<br>
which find application as base material in footwear and leather goods industries<br>
for making select group of products, because of the constraints exhibited in terms<br>
of flexibility. Buffing dust, a waste generated during cleansing of flesh side of<br>
leather, is primarily dumped as waste, thereby creating a major disposal problem<br>
of severe environmental concern. It is also sometimes used as fuel for boilers<br>
after conversion to briquettes, whereby it leads to formation of chromium (VI),<br>
which is a carcinogen. Hence, there exists a restriction for burning buffing dust.<br>
Consequently the disposal of buffing dust has remained an unresolved<br>
technological and environmental problem.<br>
On the other hand, there is a growing demand for leather in the consumer market<br>
for its elegance. But the supply does not commensurate with the demand. Being<br>
a natural material, leather has limitations with reference to its availability. This<br>
limitation in terms of the demand-supply gap on the one hand and the high price<br>
of leather on the other hand has prompted the consumer product industry to<br>
explore possibilities of using different materials, which are similar at least<br>
visually.<br>
Thus various efforts on producing leather like materials or synthetic leather<br>
through different approaches have been gaining significant recognition, thereby<br>
making visible impact on the consumer products industry. Most of these<br>
approaches involve coagulation of a polymeric matrix on fabrics and then printing<br>
them to various designs including the grain patterns, which are exhibited by<br>
genuine leather. These materials resemble leather because most of the leathers<br>
are finished using polymeric film forming materials on the surface of the leathers.<br>
Typically finishing involves, as reported in Leather Finishing Manual, Pp 34,<br>
prepared by Indofil Chemicals Ltd, formation of multi layer film on the surface of<br>
the leather using film forming polymer, which may optionally be used along with<br>
pigments, plasticisers and feel modifiers. The said ingredients are mixed in<br>
suitable proportions and then applied on the leather surface by spraying or<br>
brushing, thereby facilitating the formation of film thereon. The design of the<br>
coating film may be modified by embossing or plating. It is also a practice to<br>
apply a curing agent on top of the multi layer film in order to enhance the<br>
durability of the finish.<br>
While the major advantage of the leather like materials is that they are cheaper<br>
compared to leather, they are constrained by the absence of 'leathery' property<br>
because of the absence of collagen us materials in them.<br>
No prior art is available on the use of any collagenous material for making leather<br>
like sheet.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
preparation of leather like sheet, which obviates the limitations as stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a cost effective product<br>
for fabrication of consumer articles with elegant appearance of leather.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a profitable method of<br>
solid waste disposal generated during leather manufacture.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of leather<br>
like sheet which comprises :<br>
(i) coating a fabric surface with a film forming polymer by conventional coating<br>
method ,<br>
(ii) topping the above said coated fabric with tanned collagen us powder of<br>
particle size not exceeding 80 mesh,<br>
(iii) drying the above fabric obtained in step (ii), at a temperature not exceeding<br>
80°C for a period of at least 10 minutes and removing unfixed powder by known<br>
method,<br>
(iv) repeating the steps (i) to (iii) for at least four times followed by conventional<br>
finishing of the surface to obtain leather like sheet.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the film forming polymer used may be<br>
selected from poly acrylate, polyurethane, polybutadiene.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the method for coating of film<br>
forming polymer may be selected from spraying, brushing.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the fabric used may be<br>
selected from knitted, woven.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the film forming polymer used may be at<br>
least 5 ml per square ft.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention the film forming polymer may be<br>
used as aqueous emulsion of concentration of at least 50 % v/v.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the method used for topping<br>
by tanned collagen us powder may be selected from sprinkling, spreading<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the collagen us powder<br>
used may be selected from buffing dust, leather powder either individually or in<br>
combination.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the method used for<br>
removal of unfixed collagen us powder may be selected from brushing .shaking.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a leather like sheet, prepared by the<br>
above process.<br>
The process of the present invention is described below in detail.<br>
A fabric surface is coated with at least 5 ml of film forming polymer, which is used<br>
either as such or as aqueous emulsion of concentration not less than 50% v/v,<br>
for every sq.ft of fabric by conventional method. The coated fabric surface is<br>
then topped with 3-6 gms of tanned collagen us powder of particle size not<br>
exceeding 80 mesh, per sq. ft of the fabric by known method. The resulting<br>
material is dried by known method at a temperature not exceeding 80°C for a<br>
period of not less than 10 minutes and the unfixed particles are removed<br>
conventionally. The above steps are repeated for not less than four times.<br>
Finally, the coated fabric is finished by conventional method of leather finishing to<br>
obtain leather like sheet.<br>
Novelty as well as non-obviousness of the present invention lies in the fixing of<br>
tanned collagen us powder of particle size restricted to a maximum of 80 mesh<br>
on fabric surface with the help of film forming polymer in such a way as to form a<br>
continuous coating thereon, resulting in a value added leather like sheet thereby<br>
suggesting a method of gainful utilization of solid waste.<br>
The invention is described in detail with reference to the examples given below<br>
which should not however be construed to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
50ml of acrylic binder was mixed with 50 ml of water and applied on 10 sq.ft of a<br>
knitted fabric by brushing. 30 gms of buffing dust, collected after screening<br>
through 80 mesh screen was then sprinkled and rubbed manually on the fabric.<br>
The composite was then air dried for a period of 30 minutes at 35 °C. The<br>
unfixed buffing dust was removed by shaking. The process of binder application<br>
and subsequent buffing dust adhesion continued for 5 times. Then the buffing<br>
dust coated fabric was finished in the following way.<br>
The finishing coat was prepared in a beaker using the following composition.<br>
Three full cross-coats of the above finishing mixture were sprayed on the buffing<br>
dust coated side of the fabric manually with intermittent drying.<br>
The coated fabrics were then sprayed manually with topcoat of following<br>
composition.<br>
Lacquer emulsion<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Finally, the coated fabric was subjected to air drying followed by plain plating at<br>
80°C. The resulting leather like sheet was stored for making products.<br>
Example 2<br>
100ml of polyurethane binder was sprayed on 20 sq.ft of a knitted fabric. 120<br>
gms of leather powder collected after screening through 80 mesh screen was<br>
then spread and rubbed on the fabric. The composite was then dried for a period<br>
of 10 minutes in hot air room at 80° C. The unfixed leather powder was then<br>
removed by brushing. The process of binder application and subsequent leather<br>
powder adhesion continued for 4 times. Then the leather powder coated fabric<br>
was finished in the following way.<br>
The finishing coat was prepared in a beaker using the following composition.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Four full cross-coats of the above finishing mixture were sprayed on the buffing<br>
dust coated side of the fabric manually with intermittent drying.<br>
The coated fabrics were then sprayed manually with topcoat of following<br>
Finally, the finished coated fabrics were subjected to air-drying followed by<br>
printing with goat grain at 75°C. The resulting leather like sheet was stored for<br>
making products.<br>
Example 3<br>
100 ml of Butadiene binder were mixed with 100ml of water and sprayed on <br>
sq.ft of a woven fabric. 80 gms of collagen us powder containing both buffing<br>
dust and leather powder was then sprinkled and rubbed on the fabric. The<br>
composite was then dried for a period of 20 minutes in hot air room at 50 ° C. Th<br>
unfixed collagen us powder was then removed by brushing. The process of<br>
binder application and subsequent collagen us powder adhesion continued for <br>
times. Then the coated fabric was finished in the following way.<br>
The finishing coat was prepared in a beaker using the following composition.<br>
Three full cross-coats of the above finishing mixture were sprayed on the buffing<br>
dust coated side of the fabric manually with intermittent drying.<br>
The coated fabrics were then sprayed manually with topcoat of following<br>
composition.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
finally, the finished coated fabrics were subjected to air-drying followed by<br>
printing with cow grain print at 80°C. The resulting leather like sheet was stored<br>
for making products.<br>
The leather like sheets prepared as per examples 1,2 and 3 were subjected to<br>
physical characteristics evaluation similar to that for leather meant for similar<br>
purpose. The values obtained for the leather like sheets of the present are given<br>
below . corresponding data for conventional nappa leather are also cited in the<br>
following table since the leather like sheets prepared are envisaged to be used<br>
for making products which are usually made from nappa leather.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Presently promerics , rexins etc. are considered as synthetic leather materials<br>
which are prepared by depositing polymers on the fabrics surface and printed<br>
with different designs to appear like leather. But so far as feel and other physical<br>
characteristics are concerned they are far from leather . But in the present<br>
invention , the caliginous powder (leather powder) is applied on the fabric using<br>
binders to produce a leather like feel and appearance . The product of the<br>
present invention is thus much closer to leather because of the use of collagen<br>
use matter on the fabric . Apart from the product resembling leather in<br>
organoleptic and strength properties . The process provides a lucrative and<br>
viable solution for disposal of solid waste generated during leather<br>
manufacturing.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are the following<br>
1. The process methodology is simple and cost effective.<br>
2. The technology while providing a process for preparation of<br>
leather like sheets solves one of the major solid waste disposal<br>
problem of leather processing industry.<br>
3. The process has high degree of reproducibility.<br>
