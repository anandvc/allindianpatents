Pipe having Improved High Temperature Resistance<br>
The present invention relates to a pipe with improved high temperature<br>
resistance made of a polyethylene composition comprising a polyethylene<br>
resin produced by a polymerisation process in the presence of a single-site<br>
catalyst (SSC), and to a process for the production of such a pipe.<br>
Pipes, in particular pressure pipes, are used in various applications like the<br>
transport of drinking water, sewage, different industrial applications, gas<br>
and more.<br>
Based on the polymer strength, polyethylene pipes for pressurised systems<br>
can be classified in different categories, such as PE63, PE80 or PE100. The<br>
higher the number, the longer the service life under high pressure.<br>
However, polyethylene has a limited pressure resistance at elevated<br>
temperature. Especially, it is difficult to combine good pressure resistance<br>
at higher temperatures with a high flexibility of the piping materials.<br>
The classic tool to improve the pressure resistance of a pipe at elevated<br>
temperature is to cross-link the material. However, the inferior purity of<br>
cross-linked resins can be an obstacle for their use in pipes which are in<br>
contact with drinking water and/or food. Furthermore, the recycling of<br>
cross-linked material is difficult. Thus, thermoplastic solutions would be<br>
preferred if the technical performance, such as pressure resistance at<br>
elevated temperatures, can be sufficiently improved. Many attempts to<br>
design such materials have been made.<br>
Presently, the best polyethylene pressure pipes are prepared in a multistage<br>
process with Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The densities of such polyethylene<br>
resins are high in order to reach a high pressure resistance. However, high<br><br>
density gives a high stiffness, which is a drawback e.g. when installing the<br>
pipes.<br>
There has also been an intensive research on polyolefin resins produced<br>
with metallocene or "single-site" catalysts, but still the introduction of such<br>
resin into the market is low. The main areas where single site resins have<br>
been introduced are film or extrusion coating, as disclosed e.g. in WO<br>
03/066699. The films disclosed in this document have excellent mechanical<br>
properties and outstanding sealability.<br>
However, it is known that the catalytic activity of single-site catalysts is<br>
moderate and the highest activity is reached in the medium to low density<br>
regions.<br>
Furthermore, pressure pipe resins prepared by single-site catalysts of the<br>
state of the art, as described e.g. in WO 02/34829, have traditionally a<br>
density higher than 940 kg/m3. The consequence is that the flexibility of<br>
the pipes is rather low.<br>
Still further, for the production of pressure pipes it is necessary that the<br>
polyethylene compositions used have a suitable melt flow rate and<br>
molecular weight distribution, in order to ensure a good processability of<br>
the composition during the extrusion process.<br>
Hence, the object of the present invention is to provide a pipe having<br>
improved pressure resistance at elevated temperature by simultaneously<br>
improving the flexibility of the pipe.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that such a pipe can be produced by<br>
using a polyethylene composition comprising a base resin which has been<br>
produced using a single site catalyst, which has a density below 940 kg/m3<br>
and a MFR5 of at least 0.2 g/10min.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a pipe made of a polyethylene<br>
composition comprising a polyethylene base resin, which comprises<br>
a.	an ethylene copolymer as fraction (A), and<br>
b.	an ethylene homo- or copolymer as fraction (B),<br>
with fraction (A) having a lower molecular weight than fraction (B),<br>
wherein the polyethylene base resin is obtainable in a polymerisation<br>
process in which a single-site catalyst (SSC) is used in the polymerisation<br>
of at least one of fractions (A) and (B), the base resin having<br>
(i) a density of below 940 kg/m3,<br>
and<br>
(ii) a MFR5 at 190 °C / 5.00 kg of at least 0.20 g/10 min, and<br>
the polyethylene composition having a time to failure of at least 250 h<br>
measured according to ISO 1167 at 95°C and 4.3 MPa.<br>
As demonstrated below, the invention enables preparation of more flexible<br>
pipes still meeting the requirements for high pressure resistance at elevated<br>
temperatures.<br>
Hence, for example, the enhanced flexibility of the pipes of the invention<br>
allow for an easier bending thereof and thus an easier coiling into a roll.<br>
This offers the advantage that installing the pipes is much simplified.<br>
The term "base resin" denotes the entirety of polymeric components in the<br>
polyethylene composition of the pipe according to the invention, usually<br>
making up at least 90 wt% of the total composition. Preferably, the base<br>
resin is consisting of fractions (A) and (B), optionally further comprising a<br>
prepolymer fraction in an amount of up to 20 wt%, preferably up to 10<br>
wt%, more preferably up to 5 wt% of the total base resin.<br><br>
The density of the base resin, lies in the medium range, i.e. below 940<br>
kg/m3, preferably below 939 kg/m3, more preferably in the range of 910 to<br>
below 940 kg/m3, even more preferably in the range of 915 to below 940<br>
kg/m3, and most preferably in the range of 920 to below 939 kg/m3,<br>
measured according to ISO 1183.<br>
Despite a 5 to 10 kg/m3 units lower density of the base resin compared to<br>
conventional resins, the pipes of the invention fulfill high temperature<br>
requirements.<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) and the flow rate ratio (FRR) are important<br>
properties of the polyethylene base resin, because MFR and FRR are<br>
indications of the flowability and thus processability of the polymer. The<br>
higher the melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer.<br>
In the present invention the polyethylene base resin should have an MFR5<br>
of at least 0.20 g/10 min, preferably of at least 0.5 g/10 min, and most<br>
preferably of at least 1.3 g/10 min. The MFR5 of the polyethylene base<br>
resin is usually below 7.0 g/10 min, more preferably is 3.5 g/10min or<br>
lower, and most preferably is 1.5 g/10min or lower.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the polyethylene base resin has an MFR2<br>
from 0.06 to 10 g/10 min, more preferred from 0.1 to 5.0 g/10 min, still<br>
more preferred from 0.1 to 1.0 g/10 min, and most preferred from 0.1 to 0.5<br>
g/10 min.<br>
Moreover, for pipe applications a good processability of the polyethylene<br>
composition is important. High molecular weight is needed for meeting the<br>
requirement of good pressure resistance at elevated temperatures and low<br>
creep, however, processing of such high molecular weight resins is more<br>
difficult. Improved processability is reached by the multimodal design of<br><br>
the base resin. This means at least one lower molecular weight fraction (A)<br>
giving easier processability and one fraction with a higher molecular<br>
weight (B) contributing to mechanical strength, are present in the<br>
composition used for pipes of the invention.<br>
Usually, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights for the<br>
fractions, is referred to a "multimodal". The prefix "multi" relates to the<br>
number of different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of.<br>
Thus, for example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is called<br>
"bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or will at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for<br>
the individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process,<br>
utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each<br>
reactor, the polymer fractions produced in different reactors will each have<br>
their own molecular weight distribution and weight average molecular<br>
weight. When the molecular weight distribution curve of such a polymer is<br>
recorded, the individual curves from these fractions are superimposed into<br>
the molecular weight distribution curve for total resulting polymer product,<br>
usually yielding a curve with two or more distinct maxima.<br>
The polyethylene base resin of the present invention is a multimodal-, or<br>
more preferred a bimodal, polyethylene base resin, comprising fractions<br><br>
(A) and (B) as defined above, wherein fraction (A) has a lower molecular,<br>
weight than fraction (B).<br>
In the preferred embodiment in which the base resins consists of fractions<br>
(A) and (B), optionally a prepolymer fraction in an amount as defined<br>
above may be present.<br>
The term'molecular weight where used herein denotes the weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw.<br>
The polyethylene base resin of the present invention preferably has a<br>
molecular weight distribution (MWD) of 5 to 25, more preferably of 5 to<br>
20, and most preferably of 5 to 15.<br>
It is preferred that ethylene copolymer (A) has a density of below 945<br>
kg/m3, more preferably below 940 kg/m3. The preferred density range for<br>
ethylene copolymer (A) is from 920 to below 945 kg/m3, more preferred<br>
from 925 to below 940 kg/m3.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention fraction (A) is an ethylene copolymer<br>
and fraction (B) can be an ethylene homo- or copolymer. However, it is<br>
preferred that fraction (B) is an ethylene copolymer.<br>
The used comonomers of both fractions maybe equal or different.<br>
As comonomers various alpha-olefins with C4 to C2o carbon atoms may be<br>
used, but the comonomers are preferably a C4-C20 alkene selected from the<br>
group of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl- 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-<br>
octene, 1-decene and 1-eicosene. In particular preferred embodiment, the<br>
comonomeris 1-butene and/or 1-hexene.<br><br>
The polyethylene base resin of the present invention may also comprise a<br>
terpolymer, which means that at least on of the fractions (A) and (B)<br>
consists of ethylene and two different comonomer units.<br>
Preferably, fraction (B) is an ethylene copolymer, and the comonomer used<br>
is an alpha-olefin with 4, more preferably 6, or more carbon atoms, more<br>
preferably is 1-hexene or 1-octene.<br>
The amount of the comonomer used in fraction (A) preferably is between<br>
0.1 to 3.0 mol-%, more preferably 0.2 to 2.0 mol-%, even more preferably<br>
0.5 to 1.5mol-%.<br>
The amount of the comonomer used in fraction (B) preferably is between<br>
0.1 to 2.0 mol-%, more preferably 0.1 to 1.5 mol-%, even more preferably<br>
0.2 to 1.0 mol-%.<br>
Moreover, the melt flow rate MFR2 (190°C/2.16 kg) of fraction (A)<br>
preferably is between 10 to 300 g/10 min, more preferably between 10 to<br>
200 g/10 min, and most preferably between 50 to 140 g/10 min.<br>
It is previously known that in order to produce multimodal, in particular<br>
bimodal, olefin polymers, such as the polyethylene base resin of the present<br>
invention, two or more reactors or zones connected in series as described in<br>
EP 517 868, which is hereby incorporated by way of reference in its<br>
entirety, can be used.<br>
According to the present invention, the main polymerisation stages are<br>
preferably carried out as a combination of slurry polymerisation/gas-phase<br>
polymerisation. The slurry polymerisation is preferably performed in a so-<br>
called loop reactor.<br><br>
Optionally and advantageously, the main polymerisation stages may be<br>
preceded by a pre-polymerisation, in which case a prepolymer in the<br>
amount as described above, most preferably in an amount of 1 to 5% by<br>
weight of the total amount of polymers is produced. The pre-polymer may<br>
be an ethylene homo- or copolymer.<br>
If a pre-polymerisation takes place, in this case all of the catalyst is<br>
preferably charged into the first prepolymerisation reactor and the pre-<br>
polymerisation is performed as slurry polymerisation. Such a polymeri-<br>
sation leads to less fine particles being produced in the following reactors<br>
and to a more homogeneous product being obtained in the end. Generally,<br>
this technique results in a multimodal polymer mixture through<br>
polymerisation with the aid of a catalyst, in the present invention with the<br>
aid of a single site catalyst.<br>
The single-site catalyst used in the examples of the present invention has<br>
been disclosed in EP 1 462 464, example 5, catalyst 3.<br>
In the process of the invention for producing the base resin of the polymer<br>
composition of the invention, at least fraction (A) or fraction (B) are<br>
produced in a polymerisation reaction in the presence of a single-site<br>
catalyst. For example, fraction (A), or alternatively (B), may be produced<br>
in the presence of a single-site catalyst and fraction (B), or alternatively<br>
(A), may be produced in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
It is, however, preferred that both fractions (A) and (B) are prepared in the<br>
presence of a single-site catalyst.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that fraction (A) and fraction (B) are<br>
polymerised in the presence of the same single-site catalyst.<br><br>
In the production of a polyethylene base resin of the present invention it is<br>
preferred that fraction (A) is produced in a loop reactor under certain<br>
conditions with respect to hydrogen, monomer and comonomer<br>
concentration, temperature, pressure, and so forth.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that fraction (B) is produced in a gas-phase<br>
reactor.<br>
Still further, preferably, after the polymerisation fraction (A) including the<br>
catalyst is transferred to the reactor, preferably a gas-phase reactor, where<br>
fraction (B) is produced under different conditions.<br>
The resulting end product consists of an intimate mixture of the polymers<br>
from the two main reactors, the different molecular-weight-distribution<br>
curves of these polymers together forming a molecular-weight-distribution<br>
curve having a broad maximum or two maxima, i.e. the end product is a<br>
bimodal polymer mixture.<br>
Owing to the flexibility with respect to reaction conditions thus obtained, it<br>
is most preferred that the polymerization is carried out in a pre-<br>
polymerization reactor/a loop reactor/ a gas-phase reactor. Preferably, the<br>
polymerization conditions in the preferred three-step method are chosen so<br>
that fraction (A) is produced in one step, preferably the second reactor,<br>
whereas fraction (B) is produced in another step, preferably the third<br>
reactor. The order of these steps may, however, be reversed.<br>
In the present invention it is preferred that the pre-polymerisation operates<br>
at a temperature between 40 to 70 °C, more preferred between 50 to 65 °C<br>
and preferably at a pressure of 50 to 70 bar, more preferably of 55 to 65<br>
bar.<br><br>
In the second reactor the polymerisation temperature is preferably between<br>
60 to 100 °C, more preferably between 70 to 90 °C, and preferably at a<br>
pressure of 40 to 70 bar, more preferably of 50 to 60 bar.<br>
In the third reactor the temperature is preferably between 60 to 105 °C,<br>
more preferably between 70 and 90 °C and preferably at a pressure of<br>
10 to 40 bar, more preferably of 15 to 20 bar.<br>
The weight ratio between both fractions (A) and (B) produced in the second<br>
and third reactor is preferably from 60 : 40 to 40 : 60, more preferably from<br>
55 : 45 to 45 : 55.<br>
The polyethylene composition the pipe of the invention is made of may<br>
also comprise additives like process aids, antioxidants, pigments, UV-<br>
stabilizers and the like. Usually, the amount at those additives is 10 wt% or<br>
lower, based on the total composition.<br>
The pipe of the present invention may be prepared in any conventional<br>
manner, preferably by extrusion of the polyolefin composition in an<br>
extruder. This is a technique well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The pipe of the present invention shows good stress resistance as well as a<br>
high flexibility.<br>
The shear thinning index (SHI) is the ratio of the viscosity of the<br>
polyethylene base resin at different shear stresses and may serve as a<br>
measure of the broadness of the molecular weight distribution. In the<br>
present invention, the shear stresses at 2.7 kPa and 210 kPa as well as 5<br>
kPa and 300 kPa are used for the determination of SHI of the polyethylene<br>
base resin. The definition and measurement conditions are described in<br>
detail on page 8, line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br><br>
The polyethylene base resin has preferably an SHIp^jo) of below 20, more<br>
preferably of below 15, and most preferably of below 10. It is preferred the<br>
range of SHI(2.7/2io) is from 1 to below 20.<br>
It is also preferred that the SHI(5/3oo) is below 35, more preferred below 30<br>
and most preferred below 25. The preferred range of the SHI(5/3oo&gt; is<br>
between 5 to below 35.<br>
Additionally, the viscosity at shear stress of 0.05 kPa (etao.05) of tne<br>
polyethylene base resin is preferably at least 15,000 Pa s , more preferably<br>
at least 18,000 Pa s, and most preferably at least 20,000 Pa s.<br>
Furthermore, the viscosity at shear stress of 0.05 kPa (etao.05) of the<br>
polyethylene base resin is preferably less than 80,000 Pa s.<br>
The Charpy impact test at low temperature assesses impact toughness and<br>
therefore provides a way to evaluate resistance to rapid crack propagation<br>
(RCP).<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the polyethylene<br>
composition of the pipe has a Charpy impact strength at 0°C of at least 8<br>
kJ/m2, most preferably of at least 10 kJ/m2, measured according to ISO 179.<br>
The rapid crack propagation resistance of the polyethylene composition<br>
according to the present invention is determined by a method called S4<br>
(Small Scale Steady State), which has been developed at Imperial College,<br>
London, and is described in ISO 13477:1977 (E). The pipes of the present<br>
invention preferably reach a critical temperature, i.e. RCP-S4 value, of<br>
+ 2°C or lower, more preferably of+lqC or lower.<br><br>
The slow crack propagation resistance is determined according to ISO<br>
13479:1997 in terms of the number of hours the notched pipe withstands a<br>
certain pressure at a certain temperature before failure.<br>
Additionally, the time to failure of the polyethylene composition at 95 °C<br>
and 4.3 MPa according to ISO 1167 preferably is at least 250 h, more<br>
preferably at least 300 h, most preferably at least 350 h. .<br>
The fiexural modulus of the polyethylene composition is preferably below<br>
700 MPa, more preferably below 650 MPa, and most preferably below 600<br>
MPa, measured according to ISO 178. It is preferred that the fiexural<br>
modulus of the polyethylene composition is 300 MPa or higher, more<br>
preferably is 400 MPa or higher.<br>
The modulus of elasticity of the pipe of the present invention has been<br>
determined according to ISO 527. The polymer composition according to<br>
the present invention has preferably a modulus of elasticity from 400 to<br>
900 MPa, more preferably from 425 to 850 MPa and most preferably from<br>
450 to 800 MPa.<br>
Methods and Examples<br>
Melt flow rate (MFR)<br>
The MFR is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10min.<br>
For polyethylene resins, a temperature of 190 °C is applied. The MFR is<br>
determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2; ISO 1133), 5 kg<br>
(MFR5; ISO 1133) or 21.6 kg MFR21 (ISO 1133). The flow rate ratio, FRR<br>
is the ratio between MFRweighti and MFRweight2, i.e. FRR21/5 means the ratio<br>
between MFR2] and MFR5.<br><br>
Molecular weight<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn, wherein MB is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by<br>
based on ISO 1014-4:2003. A Waters 150CV plus instrument was used with<br>
column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and<br>
trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was<br>
calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the<br>
Mark Rowings constant K: 9.54 *10"s and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92 *<br>
10"4 and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the<br>
broadness of the distribution, since each is influenced by opposite end of<br>

Rapid crack propagation (S4)<br>
The rapid crack propagation (RCP) resistance of a pipe is determined<br>
according to ISO 13477 (E). According to the RCP-S4 method a pipe is<br>
tested which has an axial length not below 7 pipe diameters. The outer<br>
diameter of the pipe is about 110 mm or greater and its wall thickness<br>
about 10 mm or greater. When determining the RCP properties of a pipe in<br>
connection with the present invention the outer diameter and the wall<br>
thickness have been selected to be 110 mm and 10 mm respectively. While<br>
the exterior of the pipe is at ambient pressure (atmospheric pressure), the<br>
pipe is pressurized internally and the internal pressure in the pipe is kept<br>
constant at a pressure of 0.5 MPa positive pressure. The pipe and the<br>
equipment surrounding it are thermostated to a predetermined temperature.<br>
A number of discs have been mounted on a shaft inside the pipe to prevent<br>
decompression during the test. A knife projectile is shot, with well-defined<br>
forms, towards the pipe close to its end in the so-called initiating zone in<br><br>
order to start a rapidly running axial crack. The initiating zone is provided<br>
with an abutment for avoiding unnecessary deformation to the pipe. The<br>
test equipment is adjusted in such a manner that crack initiation takes place<br>
in the material involved and a number of tests are effected at varying<br>
temperatures. The axial crack length in the measuring zone, having a total<br>
length of 4.5 diameters, is measured for each test and is plotted against the<br>
set test temperature. If the crack length exceeds 4 diameters the crack is<br>
assessed to propagate. If the pipe passes the test at a given temperature, the<br>
temperature is lowered successively until a temperature (TCntjcai) is reached,<br>
at which the pipe no longer passes the test.<br>
Pressure test on un-notched pipes<br>
The pressure test on un-notched 32 mm pipes is carried out according to<br>
ISO 1167 3 at 4.3 MPa and 95 °C. The time to failure is determined in<br>
hours.<br>
Pressure test on notched pipes<br>
The pressure test on notched 110 mm pipes is carried out according to ISO<br>
13479.<br>
Charpy Notch impact test<br>
The impact strength is determined as Charpy Impact Strength according to<br>
ISO 179-1 non-instrumented or IS0179-2 instrumented.<br>
Flexural modulus<br>
The flexural modulus is determined according to ISO 178 at a constant<br>
speed of 2 mm/min.<br><br>
E-modulus<br>
The modulus of elasticity is determined according to ISO 527-2 (test<br>
speciniel?. IB), at a constant speed of 1 mm/min.<br>
Rheological parameters<br>
Rheological parameters such as Shear Thinning Index SHI and viscosity are<br>
determined by using a rheometer, preferably a Physica MCR 300<br>
Rheometer from Anton Paar. The definition and measurement conditions<br>
are described in detail on page 8, line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO<br>
00/22040.<br>
Examples<br>
Example I<br>
Into a 50 dm3 loop reactor 32 kg/h propane and 8.3 g/h hydrogen were<br>
added. The operating temperature was 60°C and operating pressure 61 bar.<br>
The slurry was taken out of the reactor and transferred into a 500 dm3 loop<br>
reactor. The reactor was operated at 85 °C and 58 bar. pressure. The single<br>
site catalyst prepared as disclosed in EP 1 462 464, Example 5, catalyst 3<br>
was continuously fed at a rate of 29 g/min into the loop reactor. Additional<br>
ethylene, 1-butene, propane diluent and hydrogen were continuously<br>
introduced into the reactor so that the rate of polymer production was 35<br>
kg/h and the MFR2 of the polymer was 110 g/10min and the density of<br>
polymer was 939 kg/m3.<br>
The slurry was continuously withdrawn from the reactor to a flash stage<br>
where hydrocarbons were removed from the polymer. The polymer was<br>
then transferred into a gas phase reactor where the polymerisation was<br>
continued. The reactor was operated at 80°C temperature and 20 bar<br><br>
pressure. Ethylene, hydrogen and 1-hexene were fed into the reactor to<br>
obtain such conditions that the rate of polymer production was 34 kg/h,<br>
MFR5 of the polymer was 1.4 g/10min, MFR2 of the polymer was<br>
0.45 g/10min and the density 936 kg/m3. The productivity of the catalyst<br>
was 2.4 kg/g catalyst.<br>
The ratio between polymer amounts produced in the slurry (reactor 2) and<br>
gas phase (reactor 3) reactors was 51:49.<br>
The polymer was then compounded in with 1500 ppm Calcium stearate and<br>
3000 ppm B225. The properties of the compounded resin are given in Table<br>
1, where also the reaction conditions for the production of the base resin<br>
are shown.<br>
The compounded material was extruded into pipes having an external<br>
diameter of about 110 mm and thickness of about 10 mm and 32 mm' and a<br>
thickness of 3 mm respectively. The pressure test result of the pipe is given<br>
in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A pipe resin was produced by means of a three-step process in a pre-<br>
polymerisation loop-reactor followed by first a loop-reactor and then a gas<br>
phase-reactor, as described in Example 1. The split was 2:38:60. No<br>
comonomer was used in the prepolymerisation reactor, while 1-butene was<br>
used as comonomer in the production of the low and of the high molecular<br>
weight fraction produced in the loop and gas-phase reactor, respectively, in<br>
the amounts as indicated in Table 1 such that the 1-butene comonomer<br>
content of the total resulting polymer was 2.9 % by weight. A Ziegler-Natta<br>
type catalyst as disclosed in EP 688 794 was used. The properties of the<br>
resin are listed in Table 1.<br><br>
The base resin produced was compounded in the same ways as in Example<br>
1 and the compounded material was then extruded into pipes having an<br>
external diameter of about 110 mm and thickness of about 10 mm and a<br>
diameter of 32 mm and a thickness of 3 mm respectively. The result of the<br>
pressure testing is also given in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
