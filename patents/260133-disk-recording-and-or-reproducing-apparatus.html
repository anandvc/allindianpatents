				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DISK RECORDING AND/OR REPRODUCING APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a disk recording<br>
and/or reproducing apparatus including cartridge drop<br>
preventive means for preventing a disk cartridge from<br>
being dropped by momentum from a cartridge holder during<br>
ejection.<br>
Background Art<br>
There is known a disk apparatus having cartridge<br>
drop preventive means. The apparatus includes a pull<br>
plate that traverses a cartridge insertion path and is<br>
guided so as to be moved in parallel with a cartridge<br>
insertion direction. An inserted cartridge is abutted<br>
against the pull plate. The apparatus further includes a<br>
fitting holding member that fits elastically into<br>
recessed portions of the cartridge on both sides of the<br>
pull plate. The cartridge is held in position by this<br>
fitting holding member relative to the pull plate.<br>
During ejection, the pull plate is stopped at a<br>
predetermined position by a stopper. (See, for example,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-189043 (paragraphs<br>
0056 through 0068, and the like).)<br>
Another known art is a disk cartridge that uses a<br>
spring to urge a shutter in a closing direction. The<br>
disk cartridge includes holding recessed portions<br>
disposed on a bottom surface of a case main body thereof.<br>
The holding recessed portions are engaged with, and held<br>
by, capturing bodies included in a disk drive. A closure<br>
reaction of the shutter spring during ejection operation<br>
is used to prevent the case main body from jumping out<br>
of a loading port of the disk drive. (See, for example,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-173223 (paragraphs<br>
0006 through 0009, 0013 through 0016, and the like).)<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-189043 (paragraphs<br>
0056 through 0068, and the like) uses the pull plate,<br>
the fitting holding member, the stopper, a lever member,<br>
and the like. This has presented the following problems:<br>
specifically, an increased number of parts used; a<br>
complicated structure; and an increased cost.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-173223 (paragraphs<br>
0006 through 0009, 0013 through 0016, and the like)<br>
includes the holding recessed portions disposed on the<br>
bottom surface of the case main body of the disk<br>
cartridge and the holding recessed portions are engaged<br>
with, and held by, the capturing bodies included in the<br>
disk drive. This has led to a problem, in which the<br>
capturing bodies cause the disk cartridge to raise, or<br>
the like.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus<br>
including cartridge drop preventive means that is<br>
capable of positively preventing, with a simple<br>
structure, the disk cartridge from being dropped and<br>
without raising the problem of a raised disk cartridge<br>
or the like.<br>
The disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus,<br>
to which the present invention is applied, includes a<br>
cartridge holder, a chassis, recording and/or<br>
reproducing means, an eject lever, urge means, and<br>
cartridge drop preventive means. A disk cartridge is<br>
inserted in, and held by, the cartridge holder. The<br>
chassis supports the cartridge holder movably between a<br>
cartridge insertion/removal position and a<br>
recording/reproducing position. The recording and/or<br>
reproducing means is disposed in the chassis and records<br>
and/or reproduces the disk cartridge. The eject lever is<br>
disposed in the chassis movably in an insertion/removal<br>
direction of the disk cartridge and movably in a<br>
direction toward or away from the chassis. The eject<br>
lever is moved by being pushed by the disk cartridge<br>
inserted into the cartridge holder. The urge means gives<br>
the eject lever a moving force in a disk cartridge<br>
unloading direction and an urging force in a direction<br>
of approaching the chassis. The cartridge drop<br>
preventive means gives a braking force to the disk<br>
cartridge being unloaded by the urge means, thereby<br>
preventing the disk cartridge from dropping off from the<br>
cartridge holder.<br>
In the present invention, the cartridge drop<br>
preventive means is formed from a spring member disposed<br>
on a first side surface plate of the cartridge holder.<br>
The spring member makes a sliding contact with a first<br>
side surface of the disk cartridge during unloading of<br>
the disk cartridge so as to give the disk cartridge a<br>
braking force.<br>
In particular, the cartridge drop preventive means<br>
is formed to include an elastic flap portion and a<br>
protruded portion. The elastic flap portion extends<br>
toward a cartridge insertion port in the cartridge<br>
holder. The protruded portion is disposed on a leading<br>
end portion of the elastic flap portion and makes a<br>
sliding contact with the first side surface of the disk<br>
cartridge during unloading of the disk cartridge. Still<br>
another arrangement is made to keep the protruded<br>
portion disposed on the leading end of the elastic flap<br>
portion in a noncontact state relative to the first side<br>
surface of the disk cartridge when storage of the disk<br>
cartridge in the cartridge holder is completed.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means is disposed on<br>
a first side surface plate opposing a second side<br>
surface plate of the cartridge holder, on which a<br>
shutter lock release member is disposed.<br>
Further, the cartridge drop preventive means is<br>
formed by cutting and raising the first side surface of<br>
the cartridge holder.<br>

Operation.<br>
(1) General construction of the apparatus and<br>
construction of the cartridge drop preventive means<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing the disk<br>
recording and/or reproducing apparatus, to which the<br>
present invention is applied. Fig. 2 is a plan view as<br>
viewed from a backside. Fig. 3 is an exploded<br>
perspective view. A disk recording and/or reproducing<br>
apparatus 101 includes a cartridge holder 102, a chassis<br>
103, recording and/or reproducing means 104, an eject<br>
lever 105, urge means 106, eject lever lock means 107,<br>
lock release means 108, and cartridge drop preventive<br>
means 221. A disk cartridge 1 is inserted in, and held<br>
by, the cartridge holder 102. The chassis 103 supports<br>
the cartridge holder 102 movably between a cartridge<br>
insertion/removal position and a recording/reproducing<br>
position. The recording and/or reproducing means 104 is<br>
disposed in the chassis 103 and records and/or<br>
reproduces the disk cartridge 1. The eject lever 105 is<br>
disposed in the chassis 103 rotationally movably<br>
(hereinafter referred to simply as "rotatably") in an<br>
insertion/removal direction of the disk cartridge 1 and<br>
movably in a direction toward or away from the chassis<br>
103. The eject lever 105 is rotated by being pushed by<br>
the disk cartridge 1 inserted into the cartridge holder<br>
102. The urge means 106 gives the eject lever 105 a<br>
rotational force in a disk cartridge unloading direction<br>
and an urging force in a direction of approaching the<br>
chassis 103. The eject lever lock means 107 locks the<br>
eject lever 105, which has been rotated by the insertion<br>
of the disk cartridge 1, onto the chassis 103. The lock<br>
release means 108 releases a lock of the eject lever 105<br>
by the eject lever lock means 107 when the cartridge<br>
holder 102 is rotated from the recording/reproducing<br>
position to the cartridge insertion/removal position.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means 221 is formed<br>
from a flat spring member disposed on a first side<br>
surface plate 102b of the cartridge holder 102. The flat<br>
spring member makes a sliding contact with a first side<br>
surface 3b of the disk cartridge 102 during unloading of<br>
the disk cartridge so as to give the disk cartridge 1 a<br>
braking force.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means 221 includes<br>
an elastic flap portion 222 and a protruded portion 223.<br>
The elastic flap portion 222 extends toward a cartridge<br>
insertion port 102k in the cartridge holder 102. The<br>
protruded portion 223 is disposed on a leading end<br>
portion of the elastic flap portion 222 and contacts the<br>
first side surface 3b of the disk cartridge 1 during<br>
unloading of the disk cartridge.<br>
Referring to Figs. 29A and 29B, the protruded<br>
portion 223 fits into a recessed portion 61 disposed in<br>
the first side surface 3b of the disk cartridge 1 for<br>
releasing a first side pressure and is kept in a<br>
noncontact condition with respect to the first side<br>
surface 3b when storage of the disk cartridge 1 in the<br>
cartridge holder 102 is completed.<br>
A second side surface plate 102c opposing the<br>
first side surface plate 102b of the cartridge holder<br>
102 including the cartridge drop preventive means 221<br>
includes a shutter lock release member 116.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means 221 is formed<br>
by cutting and raising the first side surface plate 102b<br>
of the cartridge holder 102, or by providing a window<br>
portion in the first side surface plate 102b of the<br>
cartridge holder 102 and the attaching the cartridge<br>
drop preventive means 221 made of a flat spring so as to<br>
face the window portion.<br>
(2) Construction of the disk cartridge<br>
Fig. 9 is a perspective view showing the disk<br>
cartridge 1 as viewed from an upper half side. Fig. 10<br>
is a perspective view showing the disk cartridge 1 as<br>
viewed from a lower half side. Fig. 11 is a perspective<br>
view showing a condition, in which a shutter member is<br>
slid to expose an opening portion for recording and/or<br>
reproducing.<br>
The disk cartridge 1 includes a disk-shaped<br>
recording medium 2, a cartridge main body 3, a shutter<br>
member 4, a shutter movement restriction member 5, an<br>
urge member 6, and a deformation preventive portion 7.<br>
The cartridge main body 3 accommodates the disk-shaped<br>
recording medium 2 rotatably within a circular disk<br>
storage portion and includes a recording and/or<br>
reproducing opening portion 34 that allows part of the<br>
disk-shaped recording medium 2 to face an outside. The<br>
shutter member 4 is mounted in the cartridge main body 3<br>
movably between a position of closing the recording<br>
and/or reproducing opening portion 34 and a position of<br>
opening the recording and/or reproducing opening portion<br>
34. The shutter movement restriction member 5 (see Fig.<br>
14) restricts the shutter member 4 from moving in a<br>
direction of opening the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34 by being engaged with a movement<br>
restriction portion 3e disposed in the cartridge main<br>
body 3 when the shutter member 4 is located at the<br>
position of closing the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34. The urge member 6 urges the shutter<br>
movement restriction member 5 in a direction of being<br>
engaged with the movement restriction portion 3e<br>
disposed in the cartridge main body 3. The deformation<br>
preventive portion 7 prevents the urge member 6 from<br>
being deformed by an external force.<br>
The urge member 6 includes an extension flap 6a<br>
and an elastic displacement flap 6c. The extension flap<br>
6a is extended from one side of the shutter member 4.<br>
The elastic displacement flap 6c is formed by folding<br>
back the extension flap 6a via a fold back portion 6b<br>
disposed at a leading end portion of the extension flap<br>
6a so as to overlap an inside of the extension flap 6a.<br>
The deformation preventive portion 7 is disposed<br>
on a back of the leading end portion of the urge member<br>
6. The deformation preventive portion 7 supports the<br>
urge member 6 from the back, thereby preventing the urge<br>
member 6 from being deformed by an external force.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, in a condition, in which the<br>
shutter member 4 closes the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34, the urge member 6 makes a leading<br>
end portion of the elastic displacement flap 6c press a<br>
pressed portion 57 disposed on the side of one end of<br>
the shutter movement restriction member 5. The urge<br>
member 6 thereby rotates the shutter movement<br>
restriction member 5 about a mounting shaft 8 in a<br>
clockwise direction. An engagement portion 58 disposed<br>
on the side of the other end of the shutter movement<br>
restriction member 5 is thus located at an engageable<br>
position relative to the movement restriction portion 3e<br>
disposed in the cartridge main body 3. When it is<br>
attempted in this condition to move the shutter member 4<br>
in the direction of opening the recording and/or<br>
reproducing opening portion 34, the engagement portion<br>
58 disposed on the side of the other end of the shutter<br>
movement restriction member 5 is engaged with the<br>
movement restriction portion 3e disposed in the<br>
cartridge main body 3, thereby preventing the shutter<br>
member 4 from moving. When the pressed portion 57 is<br>
pressed, in opposition to an urging force of the elastic<br>
displacement flap 6c, by a protruded portion 117 of the<br>
shutter lock release member 116 disposed on the second<br>
side surface plate 102c of the cartridge holder 102 to<br>
be described next, the shutter movement restriction<br>
member 5 rotates about the mounting shaft 8 in a<br>
counterclockwise direction as shown in Fig. 13. The<br>
engagement portion 58 is thereby escaped to a position,<br>
at which engagement with the movement restriction<br>
portion 3e is disabled. The shutter member 4 is thus<br>
allowed to move in the direction of opening the<br>
recording and/or reproducing opening portion 34.<br>
Each of the disk-shaped recording medium 2, the<br>
cartridge main body 3, the shutter member 4, the shutter<br>
movement restriction member 5, the urge member 6, and<br>
the deformation preventive portion 7 will be described<br>
in detail.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, the disk-shaped recording<br>
medium 2 is formed by mounting a chucking hub 22 at a<br>
center of an optical disk 21 on which gaming software or<br>
the like is recorded. The optical disk 21 is formed to<br>
have a small diameter of about 50 mm. The chucking hub<br>
22 is formed from a stainless steel or other magnetic<br>
metal attracted by a magnet.<br>
The cartridge main body 3 is formed by making<br>
peripheral walls 31a, 32a of upper and lower halves 31,<br>
32 abut against each other. Referring to Fig. 12,<br>
arcuate ribs 31b, 32b constituting the disk storage<br>
portion are disposed on an inside of the peripheral<br>
walls 31a, 32a.<br>
Reference is made to Fig. 11. The cartridge main<br>
body 3 includes a front surface 3a (a side surface on<br>
the side of an insertion end to the disk recording<br>
and/or reproducing apparatus to be described later),<br>
right and left side surfaces (hereinafter referred to as<br>
first and second side surfaces) 3b, 3c, and a back<br>
surface 3d. The front surface 3a is formed into an<br>
arcuate surface (a semicircular surface) having<br>
substantially the same radius of curvature as the<br>
optical disk 21. The first and second side surfaces 3b,<br>
3c, each continuing to the front surface 3a, are formed<br>
into flat surfaces that run in parallel with each other.<br>
The back surface 3d opposing the front surface 3a and<br>
continuing to the first and second side surfaces 3b, 3c<br>
is formed into a mildly continuing curved surface.<br>
The lower half 32 includes a driving opening<br>
portion 33 disposed at a center thereof. The driving<br>
opening portion 33 allows the hub 22 of the disk-shaped<br>
recording medium 2 to face the outside. The lower half<br>
32 also includes the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34 disposed over an area covering from a<br>
point near the driving opening portion 33 to the second<br>
side surface 3c. The recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34 allows an information recording<br>
surface of the optical disk 21 to face the outside.<br>
The hub 22 of the disk-shaped recording medium 2<br>
is magnetically clamped onto a disk table 170 of the<br>
disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus 101 via the<br>
driving opening portion 33. An optical pickup 152 of the<br>
disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus 101 records<br>
and/or reproduces information relative to the optical<br>
disk 21 of the disk-shaped recording medium 2 via the<br>
recording and/or reproducing opening portion 34.<br>
The disk cartridge 1 also includes a recessed step<br>
portion (hereinafter referred to as a first dent<br>
portion) 35 disposed in an area covering from an outer<br>
surface 32c of the lower half 32 to the peripheral wall<br>
of the second side surface 3c. The first dent portion 35<br>
has the following functions. Specifically, the first<br>
dent portion 35 ensures that the shutter member 4 to be<br>
described next is mounted so as not to protrude from the<br>
outer surface 32b of the lower half 32 and the second<br>
side surface 3c; or more specifically, the first dent<br>
portion 35 ensures that the shutter member 4 is mounted<br>
flush with the outer surface 32c of the lower half 32<br>
and an outer surface of the peripheral wall on the side<br>
of the second side surface 3c. Further, the first dent<br>
portion 35 restricts a movement range of the shutter<br>
member 4.<br>
An end portion of the first dent portion 35 on the<br>
side of the driving opening portion 33 is formed as a<br>
second dent portion 36 that is even deeper than the<br>
first dent portion 35. A folded portion 44a disposed at<br>
a leading end of an opening open/close portion 44 of the<br>
shutter member 4 to be described next is inserted into<br>
the second dent portion 36. The second dent portion 36<br>
is closed at a position upward of the folded portion 4a<br>
by a shutter guide plate 37 mounted to the lower half 32.<br>
Further, the shutter guide plate 37 prevents the folded<br>
portion 44a at the leading end of the opening open/close<br>
portion 44 from curving upward. The shutter guide plate<br>
37 is also mounted in the lower half 32 in a condition,<br>
in which the shutter guide plate 37 remains flush with<br>
the outer surface of the lower half 32.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, the upper half 31 includes a<br>
guide groove 38 that extends in a moving direction of<br>
the shutter member 4. The guide groove 38 is disposed in<br>
the peripheral wall 31a on the side of the second side<br>
surface 3c. In addition, the peripheral wall 32a on the<br>
side of the second side surface 3c of the lower half 32<br>
is removed. This arrangement forms an opening portion 39<br>
for shutter member guiding in a space formed with the<br>
peripheral wall 31a on the side of the second side<br>
surface 3c of the upper half 31.<br>
Further, an area from the second side surface 3c<br>
to the front surface 3a of the cartridge main body 3<br>
includes a shutter lock release member guide groove 40.<br>
The shutter lock release member guide groove 40<br>
continues into the opening portion 39 for shutter member<br>
guiding. In addition, the other side surface of the<br>
cartridge main body 3, that is, the first side surface<br>
3b includes a function enhancement groove 41 and the<br>
side pressure releasing recessed portion 61. The side<br>
pressure releasing recessed portion 61 functions as<br>
follows. Specifically, when storage of the disk<br>
cartridge 1 in the cartridge holder 102 is completed,<br>
the protruded portion 223 of the cartridge drop<br>
preventive means 221 fits into the recessed portion 61<br>
and is kept in a noncontact condition with respect to<br>
the first side surface 3b of the cartridge main body 3.<br>
The side pressure releasing recessed portion 61 thereby<br>
releases a side pressure by the cartridge drop<br>
preventive means 221 on the cartridge holder 102.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, an outer surface of the<br>
lower half 32 on the side of the front surface 3a<br>
includes a pair of positioning holes 42, 43.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, the shutter member 4<br>
includes the flat plate-like opening open/close portion<br>
44 and an assembly portion 45. The opening open/close<br>
portion 44 closes the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34. The assembly portion 45 is used for<br>
assembling the shutter member 4 to the cartridge main<br>
body 3 so that the shutter member 4 is movable between<br>
the position of opening the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34 and the position of closing the<br>
recording and/or reproducing opening portion 34 with the<br>
opening open/close portion 44 overlapped with the first<br>
dent portion 35 of the lower half 32.<br>
The assembly portion 45 includes a first movement<br>
guide flap 46 and a second movement guide flap 47. The<br>
first movement guide flap 46 is formed by bending the<br>
side of one end of the opening open/close portion 44<br>
substantially at a right angle. The second movement<br>
guide flap 47 is formed by bending a leading end portion<br>
of the first movement guide flap 46 substantially at a<br>
right angle so as to run in the same direction as the<br>
opening open/close portion 44.<br>
The first movement guide flap 46 includes an<br>
opening portion 48 for pressing operation at a central<br>
portion thereof. The pressed portion 57 of the shutter<br>
movement restriction member 5 to be next described in<br>
detail faces this opening portion 48. The first movement<br>
guide flap 46 also includes third and fourth movement<br>
guide flaps 49, 50 disposed on both sides in the shutter<br>
movement direction and at substantially a central<br>
portion in a thickness direction of the cartridge main<br>
body 3. The third and fourth movement guide flaps 49, 50<br>
run substantially in parallel with the second movement<br>
guide flap 47. The third and fourth movement guide flaps<br>
49, 50 also include lock tabs 51a, 51b at leading end<br>
portions thereof, respectively. The lock tabs 51a, 51b<br>
extend in a direction of leaving away from the opening<br>
open/close portion 44. There is disposed a boss-shaped<br>
shaft portion 52 on a lower surface of the fourth<br>
movement guide flap 50. The shaft portion 52 allows the<br>
shutter movement restriction member 5 to be mounted<br>
rotatably. An end portion of the opening open/close<br>
portion 44 opposite to the assembly portion 45 includes<br>
the folded portion 44a for upward curving prevention.<br>
The shutter member 4 is formed by bending a metal plate<br>
blanked to a predetermined shape.<br>
Referring to Fig. 16, the shutter member 4 is<br>
slidably mounted on the side of the second side surface<br>
3c of the cartridge main body 3 as detailed in the<br>
following. Specifically, the first movement guide flap<br>
46 is aligned with the shutter Rick release member guide<br>
groove 40 in the second side surface 3c of the cartridge<br>
main body 3. The second movement guide flap 47 is then<br>
inserted into the guide groove 38 included in the upper<br>
half 31. The third and fourth movement guide flaps 49,<br>
50 are inserted into the cartridge main body 3 through<br>
the opening portion 39 for guiding the shutter member.<br>
The lock tab 51a disposed on the leading end of the<br>
third movement guide flap 49 is then engaged with a<br>
groove 32e included in a bottom surface of the<br>
peripheral wall 31a of the upper half 31. The lock tab<br>
51b disposed on the leading end of the fourth movement<br>
guide flap 50 is engaged with an inner surface 32f of<br>
the peripheral wall 31a of the upper half 31.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, when the shutter member 4 is<br>
slid toward the side of the front surface 3a of the<br>
cartridge main body 3, the opening open/close portion 44<br>
closes the recording and/or reproducing opening portion<br>
34. Referring this time to Fig. 11, when the shutter<br>
member 4 is slid toward the side of the front surface 3a<br>
of the cartridge main body 3, the opening open/close<br>
portion 44 opens the recording and/or reproducing<br>
opening portion 34.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 14 and 15. The<br>
shutter movement restriction member 5 includes a flat<br>
plate-like main body portion 56, the pressed portion 57,<br>
and the engagement portion 58. The main body portion 56<br>
includes a bearing hole 55 located at a central portion<br>
thereof. The pressed portion 57 is located at one end<br>
portion of the main body portion 56. The engagement<br>
portion 58 is located at the other end portion of the<br>
main body portion 56. The shutter movement restriction<br>
member 5 further includes a protruded portion 59 for<br>
inhibiting rotation disposed on the end portion thereof,<br>
in which the pressed portion 57 of the main body 56 is<br>
provided. The pressed portion 57 and the engagement<br>
portion 58 are formed by bending one end portion and the<br>
other end portion of the main body portion 56<br>
substantially at a right angle in the same direction.<br>
The shutter movement restriction member 5 is formed by<br>
bending a metal plate blanked to a predetermined shape.<br>
The shutter movement restriction member 5 is<br>
rotatably mounted in the fourth movement guide flap 50<br>
by inserting the boss-shaped shaft portion 52 on the<br>
fourth movement guide flap 50 of the shutter member 4 in<br>
the bearing hole 55. When the shutter movement<br>
restriction member 5 is rotated until the protruded<br>
portion 59 for inhibiting rotation abuts on the inner<br>
surface of the first movement guide flap 46 of the<br>
shutter member 4, the pressed portion 56 faces the<br>
opening portion 48 for pressing operation disposed at<br>
the central portion of the first movement guide flap 46<br>
of the shutter member 4 as shown in Fig. 11. At the same<br>
time, referring to Fig. 12, the engagement portion 58<br>
becomes engageable with the movement restriction portion<br>
3e disposed on the cartridge main body 3, thus<br>
inhibiting the shutter member 4 from moving.<br>
As described earlier, the urge member 6 includes<br>
the extension flap 6a and the elastic displacement flap<br>
6c. The extension flap 6a is extended from one side of<br>
the shutter member 4. The elastic displacement flap 6c<br>
is formed by folding back the extension flap 6a via the<br>
fold back portion 6b disposed at the leading end portion<br>
of the extension flap 6a. (See Fig. 14.)<br>
The extension flap 6a is formed by being curved so<br>
as to advance into the cartridge main body 3 through the<br>
opening portion 39 for guiding the shutter member when<br>
the shutter member 4 is assembled in the cartridge main<br>
body 3. The elastic displacement flap 6c is folded back<br>
in a curved condition so as to overlap the inner surface<br>
of the extension flap 6c. The leading end portion of the<br>
elastic displacement flap 6c is to press the pressed<br>
portion 57 disposed on the side of one end of the<br>
shutter movement restriction member 5, thus causing the<br>
pressed portion 57 to face the opening portion 48 for<br>
pressing operation disposed at the central portion of<br>
the first movement guide flap 46 of the shutter member 4.<br>
The extension flap 6a makes the elastic displacement<br>
flap 6c long, thereby allowing spring constant of the<br>
urge member 6 to be adjusted.<br>
Fig. 17 is a view showing a disk cartridge<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
disk cartridge 1A adopts what is called a shutter-less<br>
structure having no shutter member 4. The shutter-less<br>
disk cartridge 1A includes a function enhancement groove<br>
41 and a first side pressure releasing recessed portion<br>
61. The function enhancement groove 41 is disposed in a<br>
first side surface 3b of a cartridge main body 3. The<br>
side pressure releasing recessed portion 61 functions as<br>
follows. Specifically, when storage of the disk<br>
cartridge 1 in a cartridge holder 102 is completed, a<br>
protruded portion 223 of a cartridge drop preventive<br>
means 221 fits into the recessed portion 61 and is kept<br>
in a noncontact condition with respect to the first side<br>
surface 3b of the cartridge main body 3 of the disk<br>
cartridge 1. The side pressure releasing recessed<br>
portion 61 thereby releases a side pressure by the<br>
cartridge drop preventive means 221 on the cartridge<br>
holder 102. It should be noted herein that the function<br>
enhancement groove 41 is formed closer to the side of an<br>
insertion end as compared with the first side pressure<br>
releasing recessed portion 61. In addition, a second<br>
side surface 3c includes a second side pressure<br>
releasing recessed portion 62. The second side pressure<br>
releasing recessed portion 62 functions as follows.<br>
Specifically, when storage of the disk cartridge 1 in<br>
the cartridge holder 102 is completed, a protruded<br>
portion 117 at a leading end of a shutter lock release<br>
member 116 disposed on a second side surface plate 102c<br>
of a cartridge holder 102 to be described next fits into<br>
the recessed portion 62 and is kept in a noncontact<br>
condition with respect to the second side surface 3c of<br>
the cartridge main body 3 of the disk cartridge 1. The<br>
second side pressure releasing recessed portion 62<br>
thereby removes a side pressure by the shutter lock<br>
release member 116 on the cartridge holder 102. This<br>
embodiment is identical to the disk cartridge 1<br>
including the shutter member 4 described heretofore in<br>
the rest of the structures and the same description is<br>
not repeated.<br>
(3) Construction of the cartridge holder<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the cartridge holder 102<br>
includes an upper surface plate (top surface plate) 102a,<br>
the right and left side surface plates (hereinafter<br>
referred to as the first and second side surface plates)<br>
102b, 102c, a pair of right and left cartridge support<br>
portions 102d, 102e, and receiving surface portions 102f,<br>
102g. The upper surface plate 102a is substantially a<br>
square. The first and second side surface plates 102b,<br>
102c are formed by bending right and left side portions<br>
of the upper surface plate 102a downwardly substantially<br>
at a right angle. The cartridge support portions 102d,<br>
102e are formed by bending lower ends of the first and<br>
second side surface plates 102b, 102c inwardly<br>
substantially at a right angle. The cartridge support<br>
portions 102d, 102e support right and left side portions<br>
on the lower surface of the disk cartridge 1 inserted in<br>
the cartridge holder 102. The receiving surface portions<br>
102f, 102g are formed by bending front ends of the<br>
cartridge support portions 102d, 102e downwardly. The<br>
upper surface plate 102a, the first and second side<br>
surface plates 102b, 102c, the pair of right and left<br>
cartridge support portions 102d, 102e, and the like<br>
constitute an insertion port 102k of the disk cartridge<br>
1 and a storage portion that continues thereto. A bridge<br>
plate 102m is attached at a position closer to the<br>
insertion port of the pair of right and left cartridge<br>
support portions 102d, 102e. The bridge plate 102m is<br>
attached so as to cross over the cartridge support<br>
portions 102d, 102e. The bridge plate 102m serves as<br>
reinforcement for preventing the pair of cartridge<br>
support portions 102d, 102e from being easily deformed.<br>
The bridge plate 102m also functions to prevent the disk<br>
cartridge 1 from jumping out from a space between the<br>
pair of cartridge support portions 102d, 102e.<br>
The upper surface plate 102a has a hexagonal<br>
opening portion 111 blanked at a center thereof. The<br>
opening portion 111 is for reducing weight of the<br>
cartridge holder 102.<br>
A pair of right and left, or first and second flat<br>
springs 112, 113 is disposed on both sides of the<br>
opening portion 111. The first and second flat springs<br>
112, 113 are bent so as to advance into the storage<br>
portion from the insertion port 102k. The first and<br>
second flat springs 112, 113 are as such designed to<br>
press an upper surface of the disk cartridge 1 inserted<br>
into the storage portion, thereby pressing the disk<br>
cartridge 1 against the cartridge support portions 102d,<br>
102e. In addition, a pair of right and left, or third<br>
and fourth flat springs 114, 115 is disposed on the side<br>
of a front end of the opening portion 111. The third and<br>
fourth flat springs 114, 115 are bent upwardly toward an<br>
upper side of the upper surface plate 102a. The third<br>
and fourth flat springs 114, 115 are designed to permit<br>
easy insertion, assembly, or a related task performed<br>
for the cartridge holder 102 relative to a cartridge<br>
holder storage portion or the like of an electronic<br>
apparatus. The first through fourth flat springs 112 to<br>
115 are formed by blanking part of the upper surface<br>
plate 102a of the disk cartridge 1.<br>
The recessed lock release means mounting portion<br>
102h is formed in the following space. The space is<br>
specifically between the second flat spring 113 and the<br>
second side surface plate 102c of the cartridge holder<br>
102, and between the arcuate front surface 3a of the<br>
disk cartridge 1 inserted in the cartridge holder 102<br>
and the second side surface plate 102c of the cartridge<br>
holder 102. The space is what is called a dead space.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, two cylindrical boss-shaped<br>
protrusions 102n are formed on the second side surface<br>
plate 102c of the cartridge holder 102 facing the lock<br>
release means mounting portion 102h. The lock release<br>
means 108 is mounted through the following mounting<br>
steps in the substantially triangular dead space formed<br>
by the disk cartridge 1 inserted in the cartridge holder<br>
102, and the arcuate front surface 3a and the side<br>
surface 3c of the cartridge main body 3. Specifically,<br>
the boss-shaped protrusions 102n are inserted in<br>
protrusion fitting holes 108g in the mounting portion<br>
108a. An overlapping portion 108b is overlapped with the<br>
upper surface of the lock release means mounting portion<br>
102h. The elastic flap portion 108c and the eject lever<br>
operating portion 108d are then inserted in the<br>
cartridge holder 102 and leading end portions of the<br>
boss-shaped protrusions 102n are then caulked to enlarge<br>
diameters thereof.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the second side surface plate<br>
102c of the cartridge holder 102 is mounted with the<br>
shutter lock release member 116 for releasing locking of<br>
the shutter member 4 by the shutter movement restriction<br>
member 5 of the disk cartridge 1.<br>
The lock release member 116 is formed from a flat<br>
spring. Like the mounting portion 108a of the lock<br>
release means 108, the lock release member 116 is<br>
immovably attached to the second side surface plate 102c<br>
of the cartridge holder 102. The side on one end portion<br>
of the lock release member 116 in a length direction is<br>
secured by the boss-shaped protrusions 102n disposed on<br>
the second side surface plate 102c of the cartridge<br>
holder 102. The lock release member 116 extends along<br>
the second side surface plate 102c of the cartridge<br>
holder 102 up to a point near the cartridge insertion<br>
port. A protruded portion 117 having substantially a V<br>
shape in a plan view is disposed on a leading end<br>
portion of the lock release member 116. The protruded<br>
portion 117 advances into the cartridge holder 102<br>
through a cutout window 118 provided in the second side<br>
surface plate 102c of the cartridge holder 102.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13, when the disk cartridge 1 is<br>
inserted into the cartridge holder 102 a predetermined<br>
amount, the protruded portion 117 at the leading end of<br>
the shutter Rick release member 116 presses the pressed<br>
portion 57 of the shutter movement restriction member 5,<br>
thus unlocking the shutter member 4.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means 221 is<br>
disposed on the first side surface plate 102b of the<br>
cartridge holder 102. As previously touched upon, when<br>
storage of the disk cartridge 1 in the cartridge holder<br>
102 is completed, the protruded portion 223 disposed at<br>
the leading end portion of the cartridge drop preventive<br>
means 221 fits into the recessed portion 61 for<br>
releasing the first side pressure disposed in the first<br>
side surface 3b of the disk cartridge and is kept in a<br>
noncontact condition with respect to the first side<br>

mesh with a third gear 183 rotatably mounted through a<br>
shaft 182 on the lower surface of the chassis 103.<br>
The third gear 183 includes a second gear 184<br>
disposed on a lower end portion thereof and mounted<br>
coaxially therewith. The second gear 184 has a larger<br>
diameter than the third gear 183. The second gear 184 is<br>
rotatably driven by the sled motor 153 through a first<br>
gear 185 to be described next.<br>
Referring to Fig. 19, the sled motor 153 includes<br>
a stator board 191, a bearing portion 191a, a bearing<br>
192, a wiring board 194, an iron core coil 195, and a<br>
rotor assembly 197. The stator board 191 is a synthetic<br>
resin outsert-molded in a stator board forming hole for<br>
the sled motor (hereinafter referred to as a second<br>
stator board forming hole) provided in the chassis 103.<br>
The bearing portion 191a is a tubular element integrally<br>
molded on an upper surface of the stator board 191. The<br>
bearing 192 is mounted in an inner periphery of the<br>
bearing portion 191a. The wiring board 194 is placed and<br>
held on the stator board 191 with the tubular bearing<br>
portion 191a inserted in a central hole 193. The iron<br>
core coil 195 is mounted on an outer peripheral portion<br>
of the tubular bearing portion 191a. The rotor assembly<br>
197 is rotatably mounted with a leading end of a<br>
rotational central shaft 196 inserted in the bearing 192.<br>
A rotor magnet 198 paired with the iron core coil 195 is<br>
mounted on an inner peripheral surface of the rotor<br>
assembly 167. In addition, the first gear 185 is mounted<br>
on the lower surface of the rotor assembly.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2. When the sled<br>
motor 153 rotates the lead screw 175 through the first<br>
gear 185, the second gear 184, the third gear 183, and<br>
the worm gear 181, the carrier rack 172 is guided by the<br>
guide portion 176 and moved in the pickup disposition<br>
hole 143. The carrier rack 172 thereby moves the<br>
objective lens driving apparatus 171 in the radial<br>
direction of the disk-shaped recording medium 2 of the<br>
disk-shaped recording medium 2.<br>
(6) Construction of the eject lever<br>
When the disk cartridge 1 is inserted, the eject<br>
lever 105 is pushed by the front surface 3a of the<br>
cartridge main body 3, rotating by counteracting the<br>
urging force of the urge means 106 to be described next.<br>
The eject lever 105 is then locked by the eject lever<br>
lock means 107 to be described later so as not to be<br>
rotated backward. After recording and/or reproducing has<br>
been completed, the lock release means 108 described<br>
earlier releases locking of the eject lever 105 by the<br>
eject lever lock means 107. This causes the eject lever<br>
105 to be rotated backward by the urging force of the<br>
urge means 106, which unloads the disk cartridge 1 from<br>
the cartridge holder 102.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the eject lever 105 includes<br>
a substantially V-shaped flat plate-like main portion<br>
105a, a pressed portion 105c, a bearing hole 105d, and<br>
an operated portion 105e. The flat plate-like main<br>
portion 105a is to be overlapped with the upper surface<br>
of the chassis 103. The pressed portion 105c is disposed<br>
on the side of one end of the flat plate-like main<br>
portion 105a via an arm portion 105b. The pressed<br>
portion 105c is pressed by the front surface 3a of the<br>
cartridge main body 3. The bearing hole 105d is disposed<br>
on the side of the other end of the flat plate-like main<br>
portion 105a. The operated portion 105e is disposed at a<br>
position substantially symmetrical with respect to the<br>
pressed portion 105c across the bearing hole 105d. The<br>
operated portion 105e is operated for releasing locking<br>
by the eject lever operating portion 108d of the lock<br>
release means 108.<br>
The eject lever 105 is mounted on the upper<br>
surface of the chassis 103 rotatably by a shaft 105f. A<br>
central portion of the front surface 3a of the cartridge<br>
main body 3 of the disk cartridge 1 inserted into the<br>
cartridge holder 102 is to abut against the pressed<br>
portion 105c. In addition, the eject lever 105 is<br>
mounted on the upper surface of the chassis 103 such<br>
that the flat plate-like main portion 105a is raised by<br>
the shaft 105f to a position, at which locking by the<br>
eject lever lock means 107 can be released.<br>
The eject lever 105 is constructed as described in<br>
the foregoing. When the disk cartridge 1 is inserted in<br>
the cartridge holder 102 in the cartridge<br>
insertion/removal position (in a condition, in which the<br>
cartridge holder 102 is inclined at a predetermined<br>
inclined angle Q relative to the chassis 103) as shown<br>
in Fig. 20, the front surface 3a of the cartridge main<br>
body 3 presses the pressed portion 105c, causing the<br>
eject lever 105 to counteract the urging force of the<br>
urge means 106 to be described next and rotate as shown<br>
in Fig. 21. When the disk cartridge 1 is entirely<br>
accommodated in the cartridge holder 102, the eject<br>
lever lock means 107 to be described next engages an<br>
outer side surface 105j of the pressed portion 105e,<br>
thus locking the eject lever 105 so as not to be rotated<br>
backward as shown in Fig. 22. In this condition, the<br>
cartridge holder 102 is kept in a condition of not being<br>
able to rotate backward even if the cartridge holder 102<br>
is rotated to the recording/reproducing position. When<br>
the cartridge holder 102 is rotated from the<br>
recording/reproducing position to the cartridge<br>
insertion/removal position after recording and/or<br>
reproducing has been completed, the lock release means<br>
108 releases locking of the eject lever 105 by the eject<br>
lever lock means 107 as shown in Figs. 8A, 8B, and 8C.<br>
Accordingly, the eject lever 105 is rotated backward by<br>
the urging force of the urge means 106, thus unloading<br>
the disk cartridge 1 from the cartridge holder 102.<br>
(7) Construction of the urge means and the eject lever<br>
lock means<br>
The urge means 106 gives the eject lever 105 a<br>
rotational force in the disk cartridge unloading<br>
direction. The urge means 106 also gives an urging force<br>
to pull the eject lever 105 in a direction of<br>
approaching the chassis 103.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 6A through 6C, 7A<br>
through 1C, and 8A through 8C. A coil spring is used for<br>
the urge means 106. The urge means 106 is disposed on<br>
the side of the lower surface of the chassis 103. One<br>
end of the urge means 106 is hooked onto a first spring<br>
latch portion 201 disposed in the chassis 103. The other<br>
end of the urge means 106 is hooked onto a second spring<br>
latch portion 202 disposed in the eject lever 105. The<br>
second spring latch portion 202 protrudes downwardly to<br>
the side of the lower surface of the chassis 103 through<br>
a cutout hole portion 203 included in the chassis 103.<br>
When the eject lever 105 is rotated by<br>
counteracting the urge means 106 to a position, in which<br>
the disk cartridge 1 is entirely accommodated in the<br>
cartridge holder 102, the eject lever lock means 107<br>
engages the outer side surface 105j of the flat platelike<br>
main portion 105a of the eject lever 105, thus<br>
locking the eject lever 105 so as not to be rotated<br>
backward.<br>
The eject lever lock means 107 is formed by<br>
disposing a boss-shaped protruded portion on the upper<br>
surface of the chassis 103. When the flat plate-like<br>
main portion 105a of the eject lever 105 is lifted off<br>
the chassis 103 by counteracting the urging force of the<br>
urge means 106, the eject lever lock means 107 is<br>
designed to be disengaged from the outer side surface<br>
105j . The eject lever 105, as disengaged from the eject<br>
lever lock means 107, rotates with the flat plate-like<br>
main portion 105a thereof riding on the eject lever lock<br>
means 107. The disk cartridge 1 is thereby unloaded from<br>
the cartridge holder 102. The lock release means 108<br>
functions to bring the outer side surface 105j of the<br>
flat plate-like main portion 105a of the eject lever 105<br>
into a position, in which the outer side surface 105j is<br>
lifted off the chassis 103, by overcoming the urging<br>
force of the urge means 106.<br>
(8) Construction of the lock release means<br>
The lock release means 108 is formed from a flat<br>
spring separately from the cartridge holder 102. The<br>
lock release means 108 is mounted to the cartridge<br>
holder 102.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1, 4, and 5, the lock release<br>
means 108 includes the mounting portion (an immovably<br>
attaching portion) 108a, the overlapping portion 108b,<br>
the elastic flap portion 108c, and the eject lever<br>
operating portion 108d. More specifically, the mounting<br>
portion 108a is secured (immovably attached) to a side<br>
surface of the cartridge holder 102. The overlapping<br>
portion 108b continues from the mounting portion 108a in<br>
a condition bent substantially at a right angle<br>
therewith and overlaps an upper surface of the lock<br>
release means mounting portion 102h formed by indenting<br>
the upper surface 102a of the cartridge holder 102. The<br>
elastic flap portion 108c continues continues from the<br>
overlapping portion 108b in a condition bent at an acute<br>
angle 01 (approximately 80°) relative thereto. The<br>
elastic flap portion 108c then enters the cartridge<br>
holder 102 through a cutout window portion 102i provided<br>
in the upper surface 102a of the cartridge holder 102<br>
and extends toward the side of the chassis 103. The<br>
eject lever operating portion 108d continues from the<br>
elastic flap portion 108c in a condition bent at an<br>
obtuse angle 02 (approximately 160°) relative thereto.<br>
The eject lever operating portion 108d includes an<br>
inclined surface portion 108e and an engagement portion<br>
108f. The inclined surface portion 108e is pressed by a<br>
side surface 105m of the operated portion 105e of the<br>
eject lever 105 to be described later in detail so as to<br>
deflect the elastic flap portion 108c. The engagement<br>
portion 108f engages a lower surface 105n of the<br>
operated portion 105e when the elastic flap portion 108c<br>
makes a return motion as the inclined surface portion<br>
108e is released from pressure by the side surface 105m<br>
of the operated portion 105e.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the elastic flap portion 186c<br>
is what is called preloaded by being bent at<br>
substantially a right angle by being pressed by an<br>
elastic flap positioning portion 102j disposed on a<br>
lower surface of the lock release means mounting portion<br>
102h. The elastic flap portion is also positioned at a<br>
predefined position. The lock release means 108 is<br>
formed by bending a flat spring stock blanked to a<br>
predetermined shape.<br>
Referring to Figs. 6A through 6C, the eject lever<br>
operating portion 108d is moved in an escaping direction<br>
(the direction of an arrow A) when the cartridge holder<br>
102 is moved from the cartridge insertion/removal<br>
position to the recording/reproducing position. At this<br>
time, the inclined surface portion 108e is pressed by<br>
the side surface 105m of the operated portion 105e of<br>
the eject lever 105 to be described in detail later.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 7A through 1C. When the<br>
cartridge holder 102 moves to the cartridge<br>
recording/reproducing position, the pressure on the<br>
inclined surface portion 108e by the side surface 105m<br>
of the operated portion 105e is released, causing the<br>
elastic flap portion 108c to make a return motion, that<br>
is, to return elastically. The engagement portion 108f<br>
then engages the lower surface 105n of the operated<br>
portion 105e.<br>
The operation of moving the cartridge holder 102<br>
from the cartridge insertion/removal position to the<br>
recording/reproducing position after recording and/or<br>
reproducing has been completed is performed as follows.<br>
Specifically, referring to Figs. 8A through 8C, the<br>
eject lever 105 is raised via the lower surface 105n of<br>
the operated portion 105e of the eject lever 105,<br>
leaving an upper surface of the chassis 103. Locking of<br>
the eject lever 105 by the eject lever lock means 107 is<br>
then released. The eject lever 105 is now rotated by the<br>
urging force of the urge means 106, pushing the disk<br>
cartridge 1 out of the cartridge holder 102.<br>
The lock release means 108 is disposed in an idle<br>
space as a substantially triangular dead space formed by<br>
the arcuate front surface 3a of the cartridge main body<br>
3 of the disk cartridge 1 inserted in the cartridge<br>
holder 102, and one side surface and a front surface of<br>
the cartridge holder 102. In addition, the cartridge<br>
holder 102 is rotatably mounted to the chassis 103. When<br>
the cartridge holder 102 is rotationally moved from the<br>
cartridge insertion/removal position to the<br>
recording/reproducing position, locking of the eject<br>
lever 105 by the eject lever lock means 107 is released.<br>
(9) Other arrangements<br>
In the exemplary case described in the foregoing,<br>
the eject lever 105 is designed to be rotationally moved.<br>
An arrangement may nonetheless be possible, in which the<br>
eject lever 105 makes a linear motion.<br>
Figs. 23 through 25 are views showing an<br>
electronic apparatus 301, such as a gaming machine or<br>
the like, mounted with the disk recording and/or<br>
reproducing apparatus 101 according to the present<br>
invention. The electronic apparatus 301 is formed into a<br>
flat, horizontally long rectangle. Referring to Fig. 23,<br>
a display portion 303, such as liquid crystal or the<br>
like, is disposed at a central portion on the side of a<br>
front surface 302a of an outer housing 302 of the<br>
electronic apparatus 301. A plurality of control keys<br>
304 is disposed on both sides of the electronic<br>
apparatus 301. Referring to Fig. 24, a lid portion 305<br>
that can be rotatably opened or closed is disposed at a<br>
central portion on the side of a back surface 302b of<br>
the outer housing 302 of the electronic apparatus 301.<br>
Referring to Fig. 25, the cartridge holder 102 of the<br>
disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus 101 is<br>
mounted on the lid portion 305. The chassis 103 of the<br>
disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus 101 is<br>
mounted on the side of the outer housing 302. It is<br>
designed that opening the lid portion 305 will rotate<br>
and bring the cartridge holder 102 to the cartridge<br>
insertion/removal position.<br>
(10) Operation<br>
Operation of the disk recording and/or reproducing<br>
apparatus 101 will be described below in each of the<br>
following two cases: in one, in which the disk cartridge<br>
1 with the shutter is used and in the other, in which<br>
the shutter-less disk cartridge 1A is used.<br>
When the disk cartridge 1 having the shutter is<br>
used:<br>
When the lid portion 305 of the electronic<br>
apparatus 301 is opened, the cartridge holder 102<br>
follows the movement of the lid portion 305 to be<br>
rotated and moved to the cartridge insertion/removal<br>
position. The disk cartridge 1 is inserted into the<br>
cartridge holder 102 positioned at the cartridge<br>
insertion/removal position as shown in Figs. 26A and 26B.<br>
At this time, the protruded portion 223 of the cartridge<br>
drop preventive means 221 makes a sliding contact with<br>
the first side surface 3b of the cartridge main body 3<br>
of the disk cartridge 1. At the same time, the protruded<br>
portion 117 at the leading end of the shutter lock<br>
release member 116 makes a sliding contact with the<br>
outer surface of the first movement guide flap 49 of the<br>
shutter member 4. A substantially even side pressure is<br>
thus applied to the first side surface 3b and the second<br>
side surface 3c of the cartridge main body 3 of the disk<br>
cartridge 1.<br>
When the disk cartridge 1 is inserted into the<br>
cartridge holder 102 a predetermined amount, the<br>
protruded portion 117 of the shutter lock release member<br>
116 fits into the opening portion 48 for pressing<br>
operation disposed in the first movement guide flap 49<br>
as shown in Figs. 27A and 27B. The protruded portion 117<br>
of the shutter lock release member 116 thereby presses<br>
the pressed portion 57 of the shutter movement<br>
restriction member 5 of the disk cartridge 1, thus<br>
unlocking the shutter member 4. At the same time, a<br>
shutter movement inhibiting protruded portion 63<br>
disposed on an inner surface of the second side surface<br>
plate 102c of the cartridge holder 102 abuts against one<br>
end portion of the shutter member 4, thus inhibiting the<br>
shutter member 4 from moving. At this time, in the first<br>
side surface 3b, the protruded portion 223 of the<br>
cartridge drop preventive means 221 disposed in the<br>
cartridge holder 102 fits in the function enhancement<br>
groove 41 included in the disk cartridge.<br>
When the disk cartridge 1 is further inserted, the<br>
cartridge main body 3 only is inserted into the<br>
cartridge holder 102 with the shutter member 4 remaining<br>
stationary, thus opening the recording and/or<br>
reproducing opening portion 34 of the disk cartridge 1.<br>
In the meantime, the eject lever 105 is pressed and<br>
rotated allowing the urge means 106 to accumulate the<br>
urging force.<br>
When the disk cartridge I is entirely accommodated<br>
in the cartridge holder 102, the eject lever 105 is<br>
locked to be incapable of rotating backward by the eject<br>
lever lock means 107. The protruded portion 223 of the<br>
cartridge drop preventive means 221 fits into the<br>
recessed portion 61 for releasing the first side<br>
pressure disposed in the first side surface 3b of the<br>
cartridge main body 3 of the disk cartridge 1, thereby<br>
releasing the side pressure.<br>
The cartridge holder 102 is then moved from the<br>
cartridge insertion/removal position to the<br>
recording/reproducing position for performing recording<br>
and/or reproducing. The cartridge holder 102 is moved<br>
from the cartridge insertion/removal position to the<br>
recording/reproducing position as follows. Specifically,<br>
the side surface 105m of the operated portion 105e of<br>
the eject lever 105 contacts the inclined surface<br>
portion 108e of the lock release means 108, causing the<br>
elastic flap portion 108c to flex in what is called an<br>
escaping direction. When an end portion of the inclined<br>
surface portion 108e moves to the position of the<br>
operated portion 105e of the eject lever 105, the<br>
contact between the inclined surface portion 108e and<br>
the side surface 105m of the operated portion 105e of<br>
the eject lever 105 is released. The elastic flap<br>
portion 108c then returns elastically and the engagement<br>
portion 108f engages the lower surface 105n of the<br>
operated portion 105e of the eject lever 105.<br>
Moving the cartridge holder 102 to the cartridge<br>
insertion/removal position after recording and/or<br>
reproducing of the disk cartridge 1 has been completed<br>
results in the following sequence of operations.<br>
Specifically, referring to Figs. 8A through 8C, the<br>
engagement portion 108f raises the lower surface 105n of<br>
the operated portion 105e of the eject lever 105, thus<br>
releasing locking of the eject lever 105 by the eject<br>
lever lock means 107. Contrary to the foregoing steps<br>
followed during insertion of the disk cartridge, the<br>
disk cartridge 1 is ejected out of the cartridge holder<br>
102 through the steps depicted in Figs. 29A and 29B,<br>
Figs. 28A and 28B, Figs. 27A and 27B, and Figs. 26A and<br>
26B. When a disk cartridge ejection sequence is started<br>
by the eject lever, a state as shown in Figs. 29A and<br>
29B, in which the protruded portion 223 of the cartridge<br>
drop preventive means 221 fits in the recessed portion<br>
61 for releasing the first side pressure, is shifted to<br>
a state as shown in Figs. 28A and 28B. Referring to Figs.<br>
28A and 28B, when the disk cartridge is ejected out by<br>
the eject lever, the protruded portion 223 makes a<br>
sliding contact with the first side surface 3b. This<br>
sliding contact prevents the disk cartridge from being<br>
unloaded. When unloading of the disk cartridge further<br>
continues, the protruded portion 223 fits in the<br>
function enhancement groove 41 disposed in the first<br>
side surface 3b as shown in Figs. 27A and 27B. This<br>
fitting of the protruded portion 223 in the function<br>
enhancement groove 41 further prevents the disk<br>
cartridge from being unloaded. Referring now to Figs.<br>
26A and 26B, the protruded portion 223 of the cartridge<br>
drop preventive means 221 thereafter makes another<br>
sliding contact with the first side surface 3b of the<br>
cartridge main body 3 of the disk cartridge 1. At the<br>
same time, the protruded portion 117 at the leading end<br>
of the shutter lock release member 116 makes a sliding<br>
contact with the outer surface of the first movement<br>
guide flap 49 of the shutter member 4. A substantially<br>
even side pressure (frictional resistance) is thus<br>
applied to the first side surface 3b and the second side<br>
surface 3c of the cartridge main body 3 of the disk<br>
cartridge 1. The disk cartridge 1 is thereby prevented<br>
from jumping out of the cartridge holder 102.<br>
With the shutter-less disk cartridge 1A, when the<br>
disk cartridge 1 is inserted in the cartridge holder 102<br>
at the cartridge insertion/removal position, the<br>
protruded portion 223 of the cartridge drop preventive<br>
means 221 makes a sliding contact with the first side<br>
surface 3b of the cartridge main body 3 of the disk<br>
cartridge 1A as shown in Fig. 30. At the same time, the<br>
protruded portion 117 at the leading end of the shutter<br>
lock release member 116 makes a sliding contact with the<br>
second side surface 3c of the cartridge main body 3. A<br>
substantially even side pressure is thus applied to the<br>
first side surface 3b and the second side surface 3c of<br>
the cartridge main body 3 of the disk cartridge 1.<br>
When the disk cartridge 1 is entirely accommodated<br>
in the cartridge holder 102, the protruded portion 223<br>
of the cartridge drop preventive means 221 fits into the<br>
recessed portion 61 for releasing the first side<br>
pressure disposed in the first side surface 3b of the<br>
cartridge main body 3 of the disk cartridge 1, thereby<br>
releasing the side pressure.' At the same time, the<br>
protruded portion 117 at the leading end of the shutter<br>
lock release member 116 fits into the recessed portion<br>
62 for releasing the second side pressure disposed in<br>
the second side surface 3c of the cartridge main body 3,<br>
thus releasing the side pressure. Other operations are<br>
identical to the case of the disk cartridge 1 with the<br>
shutter and the same description is not repeated.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
A sliding resistance, that is, a side pressure is<br>
applied during ejection to the first side surface of the<br>
disk cartridge using the cartridge drop preventive means,<br>
thereby preventing the disk cartridge from jumping out<br>
of the cartridge holder. In particular, the cartridge<br>
drop preventive means is formed to include the elastic<br>
flap portion and the protruded portion disposed at the<br>
leading end portion of the elastic flap portion. The<br>
protruded portion can therefore be pressed up against<br>
the first side surface of the disk cartridge with an<br>
adequate side pressure by the elastic flap portion.<br>
When storage of the disk cartridge in the<br>
cartridge holder is completed, the protruded portion at<br>
of the shutter lock release member is kept in a<br>
noncontact condition with respect to the first side<br>
surface of the disk cartridge. The disk cartridge is<br>
thereby released from the side pressure of the cartridge<br>
drop preventive means.<br>
It is also possible to balance between the side<br>
pressures applied to both sides of the cartridge holder<br>
using the side pressure of the cartridge drop preventive<br>
means disposed on the first side surface plate of the<br>
cartridge holder and the side pressure of the shutter<br>
lock release member disposed on the second side surface<br>
of the cartridge holder.<br>
The cartridge drop preventive means is formed by<br>
cutting and raising the first side surface plate of the<br>
cartridge holder. This helps suppress an increase in the<br>
number of parts used.<br><br><br><br><br>
