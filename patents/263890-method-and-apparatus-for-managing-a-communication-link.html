				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING A<br>
COMMUNICATION LINK<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[0001] In any communication system, high levels of noise may result in<br>
data loss or significant degradation of the quality of data such that<br>
the resulting data is unusable. For example, in video or voice<br>
applications, noise may cause video data to be unviewable and<br>
voice data to be inaudible. Further in the prior art, data traffic that<br>
experiences significant noise conditions may require boosting signal<br>
strength, which reduces system capacity, or retries, which expends<br>
limited network resources.<br>
[0002] Current methods of detecting noisy communication links are overly<br>
simplistic given the complex and varying nature of noise<br>
encountered. For example, current methods of detecting noise do<br>
not take into account the Gaussian distribution of noise and its<br>
accompanying unpredictability.<br>
[0003] Accordingly, there is a need not met in the prior art, for a method<br>
and apparatus of monitoring noise on a communication link.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0008] The following representative descriptions of the present invention<br>
generally relate to exemplary embodiments and the inventor's<br>
conception of the best mode, and are not intended to limit the<br>
applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather,<br>
the following description is intended to provide convenient<br>
illustrations for implementing various embodiments of the invention.<br>
As will become apparent, changes may be made in the function<br>
and/or arrangement of any of the elements described in the<br>
disclosed exemplary embodiments without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br>
[0009] For clarity of explanation, the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are presented, in part, as comprising individual functional blocks.<br>
The functions represented by these blocks may be provided<br>
through the use of either shared or dedicated hardware, including,<br>
but not limited to, hardware capable of executing software. The<br>
3<br><br>
present invention is not limited to implementation by any particular<br>
set of elements (hardware or software), and the description herein<br>
is merely representational of one embodiment.<br>
[0010] Software blocks that perform embodiments of the present invention<br>
can be part of computer program modules comprising computer<br>
instructions, such control algorithms that are stored in a computer-<br>
readable medium such as memory. Computer instructions can<br>
instruct processors to perform any methods described below. In<br>
other embodiments, additional modules could be provided as<br>
needed.<br>
[0011] A detailed description of an exemplary application is provided as a<br>
specific enabling disclosure that may be generalized to any<br>
application of the disclosed system, device and method for<br>
monitoring noise on a communication link in accordance with<br>
various embodiments of the present invention. In an embodiment,<br>
the invention provides a method and apparatus to derive statistical<br>
characteristics of a noise source and adjust communication link<br>
alarming and removal thresholds.<br>
[0012] In an embodiment, data, as used herein in this document, may refer<br>
to any type of numeric, voice, video, audio-visual, or script data, or<br>
any type of source or object code, or any other suitable information<br>
in any appropriate format that may be communicated from one point<br>
to another.<br>
4<br><br>
[0013] Physical 'link' or 'span' refers to any communication wire, cable,<br>
fiber, line, conduit, passage, or pathway operable to carry or<br>
communicate information or data in any appropriate format. In an<br>
embodiment, 'communication link,' as used herein this document,<br>
may refer to logical communication channels that operate over<br>
physical links, for example control links, software channels, and the<br>
like. Unless stated otherwise, 'link,' 'communication link' and<br>
'plurality of communication links," and the like, refer to the logical<br>
channels operated by software and not to the physical link itself. In<br>
an embodiment, a communication link has a corresponding physical<br>
link.<br>
[0014] FIG. 1 representatively illustrates a simplified block diagram of a<br>
communication system 100 in accordance with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 100<br>
may include a plurality of cell sites 108, a plurality of mobile stations<br>
102, a central office site 110, a plurality of base transceiver stations<br>
104, a plurality of cell site elements 106, and a network<br>
management system 116. Additionally, communication system 100<br>
may include one or more aggregation nodes 112, a plurality of base<br>
station controllers 114, a mobile switching center 118 coupled a<br>
public switched telephone network (PSTN) and/or a packet<br>
switched network such as an Internet Protocol (IP) network, and the<br>
like.<br>
5<br><br>
[0015] Communication system 100 may be configured to represent a 2.5G<br>
architecture applicable to a Global System for Mobile (GSM)<br>
environment in accordance with a particular embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In another embodiment, a 2.5G architecture is<br>
offered for purposes of example and may alternatively be<br>
substituted with any suitable networking system or arrangement<br>
that provides a communicative platform for communication system<br>
100. For example, the present invention may be used in<br>
conjunction with a first generation or 3G network, where first<br>
generation or 3G equivalent networking equipment is provided in<br>
the architecture. Communication system 100 may be used in a<br>
host of communication environments such as in conjunction with<br>
any time division multiple access (TDMA) element, code division<br>
multiple access (CDMA) element or protocol for example, whereby<br>
signals from end users, subscriber units, or mobile stations 102<br>
may be multiplexed.<br>
[0016] In an embodiment, communication system 100 may operate to<br>
monitor a group of physical links and/or their corresponding<br>
communication links that may distribute traffic as a collective entity.<br>
Communication system 100 may further provide an alert signal to a<br>
suitable next destination (e.g. a network manager or system<br>
administrator) when configurable tolerances of noise occur or<br>
subside on a given physical link and/or communication link that is<br>
being monitored. Communication system 100 may further provide<br>
6<br><br>
an alert message to a network manager or system operator that<br>
warns of the error condition. The network manager or system<br>
administrator may respond to the alert message by simply noting<br>
the condition, or by removing or restoring one or more noisy<br>
communication links from/to traffic scheduling when configurable<br>
tolerances of noise occur/subside. In order to make such traffic<br>
management determinations, communication system 100 may use<br>
current traffic utilization characteristics associated with the physical<br>
links and/or communication links and/or activity parameters<br>
associated with the links in order to assist in making link removal,<br>
restoration, or modification decisions.<br>
[0017] In an embodiment, where only a single communication link<br>
associated with a data exchange remains, communication system<br>
100 may allow the final link to be left operational. Notifications of<br>
link additions/removals may be directed to nodes that may then<br>
adjust the total throughput (i.e. reduce the allowed number of voice,<br>
video, or data calls, redistribute information to other web servers or<br>
other links to handle transactions, etc.) across the network. In<br>
another embodiment, where only a single communication link<br>
remains, communication system 100 may remove the final<br>
communication link. Removing the final link may force all new<br>
bearer traffic to another BTS or mobile station for better "quality"<br>
instead of allow traffic, even with less throughput to suffer degraded<br>
performance.<br>
7<br><br>
[0018] Mobile station 102 may be an entity, such as a client, subscriber,<br>
end user, or customer that seeks to initiate a communication<br>
session or data exchange in communication system 100 via any<br>
suitable network. Mobile station 102 may operate to use any<br>
suitable device for communications in communication system 100.<br>
Mobile station 102 may further represent a communications<br>
interface for an end user of communication system 100. Mobile<br>
station 102 may be a cellular or other wireless telephone, an<br>
electronic notebook, a computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA),<br>
or any other device, component, or object capable of initiating a<br>
data exchange facilitated by communication system 100. Mobile<br>
station 102 may also be inclusive of any suitable interface to the<br>
human user or to a computer, such as a display, microphone,<br>
keyboard, or other terminal equipment. Mobile station 102 may<br>
alternatively be any device or object that seeks to initiate a<br>
communication on behalf of another entity or element, such as a<br>
program, a database, or any other component, device, element, or<br>
object capable of initiating a voice or a data exchange within<br>
communication system 100.<br>
[0019] Base transceiver stations 104 are communicative interfaces that<br>
may comprise radio transmission/reception devices, components,<br>
or objects, and antennas. Base transceiver stations 104 may be<br>
coupled to any communications device or element, such as mobile<br>
station 102 for example. Base transceiver stations 104 may also be<br>
8<br><br>
coupled to base station controllers 114 (via one or more<br>
intermediate elements) that use a landline (such as a T1/E1 line,<br>
Ethernet, OCn fiberoptic, and the like) interface. A non-limiting<br>
example of this may be backhaul communication link 120. In<br>
another embodiment, base transceiver stations 104 may operate as<br>
a series of complex radio modems where appropriate. Base<br>
transceiver stations 104 may also perform transcoding and rate<br>
adaptation functions in accordance with particular needs.<br>
[0020] In operation, communication system 100 may include multiple cell<br>
sites 108 that communicate with mobile stations 102 using base<br>
transceiver stations 104 and cell site element 106. Central office<br>
site 110 may use aggregation node 112 and base station controllers<br>
114 for communicating with cell site 108. One or more network<br>
management systems 116 may be coupled to either cell site 108<br>
and central office site 110 (or both as desired), whereby mobile<br>
switching center 118 provides an interface between base station<br>
controllers 114 (of central office site 110) and PSTN, packet<br>
switched network, and/or any other suitable communication<br>
network. Base transceiver stations 104 may be coupled to cell site<br>
element 106 by an Ethernet link or any other suitable<br>
communication link or element operable to facilitate data<br>
exchanges. A backhaul communication link 120 between cell site<br>
element 106 and aggregation node 112 (or between BTS 104 and<br>
9<br><br>
aggregation node 112) may also include a suitable physical link<br>
(e.g. T1/E1 line, T3/E3 line, OCn fiberoptic, and the like).<br>
[0021] Base station controllers 114 may operate as management<br>
components for a radio interface. This may be done through<br>
remote commands to a corresponding base transceiver station (e.g.<br>
base transceiver station 104) within communication system 100.<br>
One base station controller 114 may manage more than one base<br>
transceiver station 104. Some of the responsibilities of base station<br>
controllers 114 may include management of radio channels and<br>
assisting in handover scenarios.<br>
[0022] In operation, layer two based traffic may be communicated by each<br>
base transceiver station 104 (using a logical channel, i.e.<br>
communication link, over a physical link) to cell site element 106 of<br>
cell site 108. Cell site element 106 may multiplex payloads together<br>
from the layer two based traffic that have a common destination.<br>
This may be done, for example and without limitation, using one or<br>
more Digital Access Cross-connect Switches (DACS). The<br>
multiplexed payloads as well as any payloads extracted from the<br>
network management system (e.g. IP or Ethernet traffic) may be<br>
communicated across a communication link to aggregation node<br>
112 within central office site 110. Aggregation node 112 may also<br>
include a DACS to demultiplex the payloads for delivery to an<br>
appropriate base station controller 114 or network management<br>
10<br><br>
system 116 and to translate from one physical link to another (i.e.<br>
from T1 to OCn or T3, and the like).<br>
[0023] Mobile switching center 118 may operate as an interface between<br>
PSTN and base station controllers 114, and potentially between<br>
multiple other mobile switching centers in a network and base<br>
station controller 114. Mobile switching center 118 represents a<br>
location that generally houses communication switches and<br>
computers and ensures that its cell sites in a given geographical<br>
area are properly connected. Cell sites refer generally to the<br>
transmission and reception equipment or components that connect<br>
elements such as mobile station 102 to a network. By controlling<br>
transmission power and radio frequencies, mobile switching center<br>
118 may monitor the movement and the transfer of a wireless<br>
communication from one cell to another cell and from one<br>
frequency or channel to another frequency or channel. In a given<br>
communication environment, communication system 100 may<br>
include multiple mobile switching centers 118 that are operable to<br>
facilitate communications between base station controllers 114 and<br>
PSTN. Mobile switching center 118 may also generally handle<br>
connection, tracking, status, billing information, and other user<br>
information for communications in a designated area where<br>
appropriate.<br>
[0024] PSTN represents a worldwide telephone system that is operable to<br>
conduct or facilitate communications. PSTN may be any land line<br>
it<br><br>
telephone network operable to facilitate communications between<br>
two entities, such as two persons, a person and a computer, two<br>
computers, or in any other environment in which data is exchanged<br>
for purposes of communication. According to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, PSTN may operate in a wireless domain,<br>
facilitating data exchanges between mobile station 102 and any<br>
other suitable entity within or external to communication system<br>
100.<br>
[0025] Packet switched network may be a series of points or nodes of<br>
interconnected communication paths for receiving and transmitting<br>
packets of information that propagate through communication<br>
system 100. Packet switched network offers a communications<br>
interface between mobile stations 102 and any other suitable<br>
network equipment. Packet switched network may be any local<br>
area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area<br>
network (WAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), virtual private<br>
network (VPN), or any other appropriate architecture or system that<br>
facilitates communications in a network environment. Packet<br>
switched network implements a transmission control<br>
protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) communication language<br>
protocol in a particular embodiment of the present invention.<br>
However, packet switched network may alternatively implement any<br>
other suitable communications protocol (e.g. frame relay, X.25,<br>
12<br><br>
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), etc.) for transmitting and<br>
receiving data packets within communication system 100.<br>
[0026] Aggregation node 112 and cell site element 106 are network<br>
elements that may share one or more of the same functionalities<br>
and/or capabilities. For purposes of example and teaching only, a<br>
noise monitoring module 115 may be described as being positioned<br>
in at least one of aggregation node 112 and/or cell site element<br>
106. In another embodiment, noise monitoring module 115 may be<br>
distributed between cell site element 106 and aggregation node<br>
112. In yet another embodiment, noise monitoring module 115 may<br>
be integrated with BTS 104, where BTS 104 does not include a<br>
separate cell site element. In this embodiment, the features of cell<br>
site 108 and cell site element 106 may be integrated with BTS 104.<br>
[0027] Alternatively, such a capability may be provided in any other<br>
suitable location of communication system 100 or provided<br>
separately as its own distinct structure, device, component, module,<br>
element or object. It is also critical to note that the use of the terms<br>
'aggregation node' and 'cell site element' herein in this document<br>
only connotes an example representation of one or more elements<br>
associated with base transceiver station 104 and base station<br>
controller 114. These terms have been chosen arbitrarily and<br>
offered for purposes of teaching only and do not necessarily imply<br>
any particular architecture or configuration. Moreover, the terms<br>
cell site element' and 'aggregation node' are intended to<br>
13<br><br>
encompass any network element operable to facilitate a data<br>
exchange in a network environment. Accordingly, cell site element<br>
106 and aggregation node 112 may be routers, switches, bridges,<br>
gateways, load-balancers, interfaces, or any other suitable module,<br>
device, component, element or object operable to effectuate one or<br>
more of the operations, tasks, or functionalities associated with<br>
monitoring noise data as implied, described, provided, or offered<br>
herein.<br>
[0028] In an embodiment, noise monitoring module 115 in cell site element<br>
106 and/or aggregation node 112 or BTS 104 may monitor an<br>
element (e.g. a controller chip) that controls the backhaul<br>
communication link 120. Cell site element 106 and/or aggregation<br>
node 112 may monitor various errors being reported there and, in a<br>
particular embodiment, monitor line code violations, path code<br>
violations, bi-polar violations, or excessive zeros that occur.<br>
Alternatively, cell site element 106 and/or aggregation node 112 or<br>
BTS 104 may monitor any other suitable errors or noise parameters<br>
in accordance with particular needs (link alarms or higher level<br>
application indicators such as dropped packets, retransmission<br>
requests, and the like). When the physical link and/or the<br>
communication link becomes noisy, a warning signal may be<br>
communicated over the communication link to an administrator or a<br>
network operator such that he is made aware of the possible<br>
deterioration in quality of data. The alert signal may also be<br>
14<br><br>
communicated to an administration module (that may be provided in<br>
any suitable location within communication system 100) that reports<br>
or consolidates such information to be reviewed by an<br>
administrator, network operator, or any other suitable entity.<br>
Considerable flexibility is provided to an end user or network<br>
administrator in configuring any number of parameters that result in<br>
a notification or removal operation being implemented. For<br>
example, a network administrator may configure a given time<br>
interval where the number of errors is being detected. Additionally,<br>
a network administrator or system operator may decide to set a<br>
parameter based on a percentage of information or data being<br>
received. Considerable versatility and flexibility is granted by the<br>
architecture of the present invention in that any noise criteria (e.g.<br>
noise data associated with time, percentage error, error number,<br>
throughput, etc.) may be implemented by communication system<br>
100.<br>
[0029] At cell site element 106 and/or aggregation node 112 or BTS 104,<br>
an alert notification may be generated that indicates a particular<br>
severity in noise associated with a physical link or error associated<br>
with a communication link. The alert notification (via a configuration<br>
command) may be converted into an appropriate signal to be sent<br>
via a simple network management protocol (SNMP) to a suitable<br>
application that may consolidate monitoring functions of a network.<br>
Alternatively, this signal or notification may be sent to any suitable<br>
15<br><br>
entity, module, element, or object operable to authorize or<br>
otherwise control managerial functions or administration parameters<br>
associated with a network or a communication link. A<br>
corresponding element may, in turn, filter elements (as it may be<br>
configured to do) or pass the alert notification up to a higher level of<br>
management. Additionally, the alert notification may trigger a<br>
suitable protocol for networking equipment or gear to execute some<br>
action based on the signal. Such alert notifications may be passed<br>
on to suitable maintenance, control, and fault mechanisms that<br>
identify and process the signal such that the error condition or noise<br>
parameter may be addressed. The alert notification may also flag<br>
the logging of error messages to a console or controller. The<br>
protocol may be applicable to any type of layer one medium that<br>
allows for the gathering or reporting of physical layer statistics<br>
associated with error conditions or noise. For cyclic redundancy<br>
check (CRC) errors, a path code violation counter may be<br>
incremented. One or more counters may be provided to cell site<br>
element 106 and/or aggregation node 112 in order to achieve this<br>
operation.<br>
[0030] In operation of an example embodiment, a method for detecting<br>
errors may be effectuated by monitoring noise at the physical layer<br>
of each network interface and/or error over the corresponding<br>
communication link. This can be achieved, for example, by<br>
monitorina the bit errors rates and network CRC errors.<br>
16<br><br>
Communication system 100 provides considerable flexibility in that<br>
noise tolerance levels can be configured based on any number of<br>
parameters, such as layer one error threshold including a number of<br>
errors per sample period, sample period, number of samples, or<br>
percent of errored samples for example.<br>
[0031] A periodic timer included within cell site element 106 and/or<br>
aggregation node 112 or BTS 104 (or provided at any other suitable<br>
location) may monitor the physical layer according to the current<br>
settings or designations associated with error tolerances and initiate<br>
the appropriate action when tolerances are exceeded (e.g. cause<br>
alert notifications, notify a higher layer of actions that were [or that<br>
should be] taken, etc.). A higher layer timer monitor element may<br>
also be provided to monitor the number of links and network<br>
utilization, and to adjust the tolerances of the links, as needed,<br>
based on current system conditions or particular networking needs.<br>
[0032] Such a configuration allows noise associated with multiple network<br>
links to be managed collectively as a group, rather than as separate<br>
entities. In another embodiment, individual communication links<br>
may be managed individually within bundle of communication links.<br>
The architecture of communication system 100 may further allow<br>
tolerable loss to be designated or otherwise selected based on the<br>
particular customer's network environment, system performance<br>
characteristics, or particular data transmission needs. For example,<br>
the integrity of real-time voice data requires more sensitive (i.e.<br>
17<br><br>
lower threshold) system configuration as compared to higher<br>
thresholds associated with simple data traffic.<br>
[0033] Cell site element 106 and/or aggregation node 112 or BTS 104 may<br>
include a noise monitoring module 115, in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention that implements one or more<br>
noise monitoring tasks as described herein. Noise monitoring<br>
module 115 may include any suitable hardware, software,<br>
algorithms, objects, or elements operable to facilitate the<br>
functionality or operations thereof.<br>
[0034] Noise monitoring module 115 may monitor the link quality of<br>
individual communication links (i.e. logical links) within a multilink<br>
bundle, for example and without limitation backhaul communication<br>
link 120. Noise monitoring module 115 may provide the ability to<br>
issue a warning or an alert on reaching a certain level of noise, and<br>
further remove the communication link based on a second level of<br>
noise. Conversely, once the level of noise improves to a certain<br>
level of quality, the communication link may be restored to service,<br>
which may be accompanied by an indication of improved<br>
communication quality to be communicated to any appropriate<br>
source or location.<br>
[0035] In an example embodiment, noise monitoring module 115 may<br>
include two monitoring aspects. The first is a link warning element<br>
that may include a monitor that provides the capability to issue a<br>
warning when the communication link surpasses a configured level<br>
18<br><br>
of noise. A notification may then be given when the link noise level<br>
improves to a second configured level of noise. The second is a<br>
link removal element that may include a monitor that provides the<br>
capability to remove a communication link from service in the<br>
bundle and, further, to issue an error when the communication link<br>
surpasses a configured level of noise. The communication link may<br>
be restored and a notice issued when the link noise level improves<br>
below a second configured level of noise. Both warning and<br>
removal types of monitors may include two thresholds and/or<br>
durations. The first threshold and duration may operate to cause<br>
the error condition. The second threshold and duration may<br>
operate to clear the error condition.<br>
[0036] When only one active communication link remains in the multilink<br>
bundle, an optional attempt may be made to maintain this<br>
communication link in service by issuing an alert rather than<br>
removing the communication link from service when the link<br>
removal level of noise is reached. The T1 standard error rate may<br>
be in effect, where appropriate, in order to remove the final link from<br>
service. In another embodiment, the last communication link in a<br>
multilink bundle may be removed with traffic being redirected to<br>
another BTS 104. For example and without limitation, the last<br>
communication link in the multilink bundle may dropped with the<br>
traffic data being directed to an available BTS 104 having a higher<br>
or highest quality signal (low BER, and the like).<br>
19<br><br>
[0037] In general, noisy communication links may be removed based on<br>
the Bit Error Ratio (BER) of individual or multiple physical links.<br>
Such a BER may be reflected by Line Code Violation (LCV) or Path<br>
Code Violation (PCV) errors. An LCV is an occurrence of either a<br>
Bi-Polar Violation (BPV) or an Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) Error.<br>
Additionally, noise monitoring module 115 may implement or<br>
involve any other suitable violation or error condition or<br>
characteristic. In an embodiment, BER in one or both directions<br>
over physical link may be monitored for exceeding the various noise<br>
thresholds.<br>
[0038] Two options may be included within noise monitoring module 115,<br>
one for link warning and one for link removal operations. These two<br>
options may also be configured independently of each other where<br>
appropriate. Either or both may be used in a configuration in<br>
accordance with particular needs. Each option may be entered in<br>
two forms: the error condition and the clear condition.<br>
[0039] Both the warning and the removal conditions may cause a<br>
notification to be generated upon the threshold being exceeded for<br>
the sample duration. In addition, notification messages may be<br>
generated when their clear thresholds are reached for the clear<br>
sample duration. For the removal/restore conditions, if it is the last<br>
communication link in a multilink bundle, different remove<br>
notifications and severities may be presented in order to indicate<br>
the thresholds were surpassed, but no removal/restore occurred,<br>
20<br><br>
Once a warn or remove noise level has been exceeded, and the<br>
associated notification generated, the notification may not occur<br>
again until its corresponding clear level has been reached and the<br>
clear notification is issued. The notification may be marked with a<br>
timestamp provided by any suitable protocol such as an input<br>
output supervision (IOS) protocol for example.<br>
[0040] FIG.'s 2A and 2B representatively illustrate a flow diagram with<br>
exemplary steps associated with a method of the invention in<br>
accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In step 202, at least one of a plurality of physical links<br>
and a plurality of communication links are monitored that are<br>
associated with a plurality of data communications. The plurality of<br>
communication links may correspond to the plurality of physical<br>
links. These may be, for example and without limitation, a plurality<br>
of physical links and communication links making up a bundle of<br>
backhaul communication links 120. In step 206, it is determined if a<br>
first time interval has elapsed. If not, monitoring of the plurality of<br>
physical links and/or communication links continues. If so, a<br>
statistical quantity of a noise element is calculated for a selected<br>
one or more of at least one of the plurality of physical links or the<br>
plurality of communication links in step 208. For example, in an<br>
embodiment, a statistical quantity may be calculated for each<br>
communication link in a multilink bundle.<br>
21<br><br>
[0041] In an embodiment, noise element can be the BER or any parameter<br>
discussed above used to derive BER. In another embodiment,<br>
noise element may be a time interval associated with one or more<br>
of the plurality of physical links. In yet another embodiment, noise<br>
element may be a percentage of errors or a number of errors<br>
associated with one or more of plurality of physical links or the<br>
plurality of communication links.<br>
[0042] First time interval may be any interval set by a system<br>
administrator, user, and the like, for example and without limitation<br>
thirty minutes, and the like. In an embodiment, plurality of physical<br>
links and/or the plurality of communication links are monitored with<br>
the statistical quantity calculated using data gathered over first time<br>
interval. In an embodiment, statistical quantity may be a standard<br>
deviation of noise element as measured on selected one or more of<br>
at least one of the plurality of physical links or the plurality of<br>
communication links. In an embodiment, standard deviation may<br>
be one, two or more standard deviations of noise element as<br>
needed for any particular system architecture or monitoring criteria.<br>
[0043] In an embodiment, in step 206, statistical quantity is updated by<br>
averaging with a statistical quantity calculated over a previous first<br>
time interval. For example, the standard deviation of noise element<br>
as measured over one of first time interval may be averaged with<br>
the standard deviation of noise element measured over a previous<br>
first time interval. In another embodiment, the standard deviation of<br>
22<br><br>
noise element as measured over one of first time interval may be<br>
averaged with one or more standard deviations as measured over<br>
multiple previous first time intervals respectively. In yet another<br>
embodiment, statistical quantity may include a weighted average of<br>
each of a standard deviation of noise element at two or more of first<br>
time intervals respectively.<br>
[0044] In step 210, noise element is measured at a second time interval.<br>
Second time interval may be any interval set by a system<br>
administrator, user, and the like, for example and without limitation,<br>
ten seconds. In step 212, a first noise threshold is calculated based<br>
on a user threshold and the statistical quantity calculated above. In<br>
an embodiment, user threshold may be a threshold of noise<br>
element set by a user or system administrator, which may represent<br>
a level where noise element is deemed to unacceptably interfere<br>
with one or more of plurality of communication links.<br>
[0045] In an embodiment of step 212, first noise threshold may be<br>
calculated by subtracting statistical quantity from user threshold. In<br>
one embodiment, first noise threshold may be a user threshold<br>
minus a standard deviation of noise element (or an average or<br>
weighted average of standard deviations as described above). It is<br>
clear that unlike the prior art, first noise threshold is not fixed, but<br>
changes depending on statistical quantity. Further, first noise<br>
threshold may be updated and changed based on a more<br>
reDresentative samole of noise element that is beina encountered in<br>
23<br><br>
selected one or more of plurality of communication links. This is<br>
because first noise threshold is a function of a standard deviation of<br>
noise element actually measured over one or more communication<br>
links.<br>
[0046] In step 214 it is determined if noise element measured at second<br>
time interval has exceeded first noise threshold calculated in step<br>
212. If not, statistical quantity continues to update as described<br>
above and noise element is continually measured at second time<br>
interval as per the return arrow. If noise element does exceed first<br>
noise threshold, then an alert notification is communicated by noise<br>
monitoring module per step 216. In an embodiment, alert<br>
notification may be communicated to network management system,<br>
mobile switching center, a system administrator, and the like, as<br>
described above.<br>
[0047] In step 218 it is determined if noise element as measured at second<br>
time interval has dropped below first noise threshold. If so, a stable<br>
traffic pattern notification may be communicated to network<br>
management system, mobile switching center, a system<br>
administrator, and the like per step 220. If not, in an embodiment of<br>
step 221, second noise threshold may be calculated by subtracting<br>
statistical quantity from a second user threshold. In one<br>
embodiment, second noise threshold may be a second user<br>
threshold minus a standard deviation of noise element (or an<br>
average or weiqhted average of standard deviations as described<br>
24<br><br>
above). It is clear that unlike the prior art, second noise threshold is<br>
not fixed, but changes depending on statistical quantity. Further,<br>
second noise threshold may be updated and change based on a<br>
more representative sample of noise element that is being<br>
encountered in selected one or more of plurality of communication<br>
links. This is because second noise threshold is a function of a<br>
standard deviation of noise element actually measured over one or<br>
more communication links.<br>
[0048] In step 222 it is determined if noise element has exceeded second<br>
noise threshold. In an embodiment, second noise threshold may be<br>
calculated by subtracting statistical quantity from a second user<br>
threshold. In one embodiment, second noise threshold may be a<br>
second user threshold minus a standard deviation of noise element.<br>
Analogous to user threshold above, second user threshold may be<br>
a threshold of noise element set by a user or system administrator,<br>
which may represent a level where noise element is deemed to<br>
unacceptably interfere with one or more of plurality of<br>
communication links such that the one or more of the plurality of<br>
communication links affected must be removed from service.<br>
[0049] If noise element has not exceeded second noise threshold in step<br>
222, then the monitoring of noise element continues per the return<br>
arrow. If noise element has exceeded second noise threshold in<br>
step 222, then it is determined if the affected link is the last link in a<br>
multi-link bundle in step 224. If so, in optional step 226, the last link<br>
25<br><br>
is not removed from service per step 226. Step 226 may be<br>
optional depending on the preferences of a system administrator as<br>
to whether it is best to preserve the last communication link or to<br>
transfer traffic to different BTS. If the affected link is not the last<br>
link, then it is removed from service and a second alert notification<br>
may be communicated to network management system, mobile<br>
switching center, a system administrator, and the like, notifying of<br>
the removal of the affected one or more communication links per<br>
step 228.<br>
[0050] In step 230, it is determined if noise element has dropped below<br>
second noise threshold. If not, monitoring is continued per the<br>
return arrow. If so, the one or more affected communication links<br>
previously removed from service are restored and a restoration alert<br>
notification may be communicated to network management system,<br>
mobile switching center, a system administrator, and the like, per<br>
step 232.<br>
[0051] Some of the steps illustrated in FIG.2 may be changed or deleted<br>
where appropriate and additional steps may also be added to the<br>
flowchart. These changes may be based on specific<br>
communication system architectures or particular networking<br>
arrangements or configurations and do not depart from the scope or<br>
the teachings of the present invention.<br>
[0052] In addition, although the preceding description offers a noise<br>
monitorina module to be implemented with particular devices (e.a<br>
26<br><br>
aggregation node 112 or cell site element 106), the noise<br>
monitoring module provided may be embodied in a fabricated<br>
module that is designed specifically for effectuating the monitoring<br>
techniques as provided above. Moreover, such a module may be<br>
compatible with any appropriate protocol and communication links<br>
other than T1/E1 links, which were offered for purposes of teaching<br>
and example only.<br>
[0053] Additionally, although some example embodiments provided above<br>
may reference voice data, communication system 100 may<br>
cooperate with any other type of data in which monitoring protocols<br>
are applicable. For example, normative or standard data, video<br>
data, and audio-visual data may benefit from the teachings of the<br>
present invention. Communication system 100 is adaptable in that it<br>
may be used in conjunction with any information that is sought to be<br>
compressed in a communications environment.<br>
