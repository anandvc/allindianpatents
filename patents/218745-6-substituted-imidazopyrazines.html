The compounds according to the invention can be synthesised from corresponding starting compounds, for example according to the reaction schemes given below. The synthesis is carried out in a manner known to the expert, for example as described in more detail in the following examples.<br><br>
14<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of formula 1 can be prepared as outlined in the reaction schemes 1 and 2, which illustrate processes known to the expert and which use known starting materials. The particular method for the synthesis and reaction sequence of the compounds of formula 1 is chosen having regard to the specific nature of the substituents and their position. One of the processes for producing the compounds of formula 1 consists in condensing a 3, 5-disubstituted 2- aminopyrazine II with an alpha-halocarbonylcompound III (scheme 1). The required 3, 5-disubstituted 2-aminopyrazines II are obtained by a substitution reaction of a 5-substituted 2-amino-3-bromopyrazine I, containing any desired substituent R3, with ArCH2XH (X = O or NH), analogously to known procedures (see, for example, EP 204285). Scheme 1.<br><br>
Another process (scheme 2) for producing the compounds of formula 1 consists in carrying out a substitution reaction starting with an appropriate substituted imidazo [1,2-a] pyrazine (IV or V). It is thus possible, for example, starting from compounds of formula IV, to prepare compounds of formula 1 where R2 = CH2OH (e. g. by Vilsmeier reaction and subsequent reduction) or where R2 = Br or CI (by bromination or chlorination). Further derivatization of compounds of formula 1, where R2 = Br or CI, can be accomplished for example by metal-catalysed carbonylation to get compounds of formula 1 where R2 = alkoxycarbonyl or by using the Sonogashira reaction to get compounds of formula 1 where R2 = propynyl. A substitution of R3 can be carried out likewise, for example by palladium-catalysed carbonylation of compounds V as described in more detail in the examples. If compounds, where R3 = - CO-NR31 R32, are desired, an appropriate derivatization can be performed in a manner known per se (conversion of an ester or carboxylic acid into an amide). Scheme 2.<br><br><br><br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention in greater detail without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula 1 whose preparation is not described explicitly can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques. The abbreviation min stands for minute (s), h for hour (s). The compounds under the scope of formula 1 named expressly as examples, and any salts of these compounds, are preferred subject matter of the invention.<br><br>

The organic phase is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give 6-bromo-8-(2-ethyl-6-methyl-benzylamino)-2, 3-dimethyl-imidazo [1, 2-a] pyrazine as a colourless oil. The resulting oil thus obtained is dissolved in 80 ml of absolute ethanol and 16 ml of triethylamine and transferred to an autoclave. After addition of 0. 5 g (2.2 mmol) of palladium (II) acetate and 1.64 g (6.2 mmol) of triphenylphosphine, the reaction mixture is carbonylated (10 bar carbon monoxide pressure, 100 °C) for 14 h. The reaction mixture is cooled down, filtered and evaporated to leave an orange coloured oil which is dissolved in dichloromethane and extracted with water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated. Purification of the residue by crystallization from ethyl acetate/ n-heptane yields 7.2 g (89 %) of the title compound as a colourless solid (m. p. 144 °C).<br>

Commercial utility<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 and their salts have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular, they exhibit marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm¬blooded animals, in particular humans. In this connection, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high selectivity of action, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of significant side effects and a large therapeutic range.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" in this connection is understood as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and lesions (such as, for example, gastric ulcer, peptic ulcer, including peptic ulcer bleeding, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, hyperacidic or medicament-related functional dyspepsia), which can be caused, for example, by microorganisms (e. g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e. g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics, such as NSAIDs and COX-inhibitors), chemicals (e. g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations. "Gastric and intestinal protection" is understood to include, according to general knowledge, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the symptoms of which include, but are not limited to, heartburn and/or acid regurgitation.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be clearly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these<br>
20<br><br>
properties, the compounds of the formula 1 and their pharmacologically acceptable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
A further subject of the invention are therefore the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases. The invention likewise includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
A further subject of the invention are medicaments which comprise one or more compounds of the formula 1 and/or their pharmacologically acceptable salts.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries or excipients in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches (e. g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and it being possible to obtain a pharmaceutical administration form exactly adapted to the active compound and/or to the desired onset and/or duration of action (e. g. a sustained-release form or an enteric form) by means of the appropriate selection of the auxiliaries and excipients.<br>
The auxiliaries and excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations are known to the person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound excipients, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or, in particular, permeation promoters and complexing agents (e. g. cyclodextrins).<br>
21<br><br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously. In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active compound (s) in the case of oral administration in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of several, preferably 1 to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of a parenteral treatment, similar or (in particular in the case of the intravenous administration of the active compounds), as a rule, lower doses can be used. The establishment of the optimal dose and manner of administration of the active compounds necessary in each case can easily be carried out by any person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their salts are to be used for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more pharmacologically active constituents of other groups of medicaments, for example : tranquillizers (for example from the group of the benzodiazepines, for example diazepam), spasmolytics (for example, bietamiverine or camylofine), anticholinergics (for example, oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local anesthetics, (for example, tetracaine or procaine), and, if appropriate, also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
To be emphasized in this connection is in particular the combination of the compounds according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 blockers (e. g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors (e. g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or further with so called peripheral anticholinergics (e. g. pirenzepine, telenzepine) and with gastrin antagonists with the aim of increasing the principal action in an additive or super-additive sense and/or of eliminating or of decreasing the side effects, or further the combination with antibacterially active substances (such as, for example, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, nitroimidazoles or alternatively bismuth salts) for the control of Helicobacter pylori. Suitable antibacterial co-components which may be mentioned are, for example, meziocillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, imipenem, gentamycin, amikacin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin and combinations thereof (for example clarithromycin + metronidazole).<br>
22<br><br>
In view of their excellent gastric and intestinal protection action, the compounds of formula 1 are suited for a free or fixed combination with those medicaments (e. g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics, such as NSAIDs), which are known to have a certain ulcerogenic potency. In addition, the compounds of formula 1 are suited for a free or fixed combination with motility-modifying drugs.<br>
Pharmacology<br>
The excellent gastric protective action and the gastric acid secretion-inhibiting action of the compounds according to the invention can be demonstrated in investigations on animal experimental models. The compounds according to the invention investigated in the model mentioned below have been provided with numbers which correspond to the numbers of these compounds in the examples.<br>
Testing of the secretion»inhibiting action on the perfused rat stomach<br>
In Table A which follows, the influence of the compounds according to the invention on the pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion of the perfused rat stomach after intraduodenal administration in vivo is shown. Table A<br><br>
Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rat, female, 200-250 g ; 1.5 g/kg i. m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and another via the pylorus such that the ends of the tubes just projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outward into the right abdominal wall through a side opening.<br>
23<br><br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml), warm (37°C) physiological NaCI solution was continuously passed through the stomach (0.5 ml/min, pH 6.8-6.9; Braun-Unita I). The pH (pH meter 632, glass electrode EA 147;  = 5 mm, Metrohm) and, by titration with a freshly prepared 0.01 N NaOH solution to pH 7 (Dosimat 665 Metrohm), the secreted HCI were determined in the effluent in each case collected at an interval of 15 minutes.<br>
The gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous infusion of 1 ug/kg (= 1. 65 ml/h) of i. v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation (i. e. after determination of 2 preliminary fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intraduodenally in a 2.5 ml/kg liquid volume 60 min after the start of the continuous pentagastrin infusion.<br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37. 8-38°C by infrared irradiation and heat pads (automatic, stepless control by means of a rectal temperature sensor).<br>
