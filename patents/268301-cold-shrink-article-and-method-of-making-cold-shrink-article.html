COLD-SHRINK ARTICLE AND METHOD OF MAKING<br>
COLD-SHRINK ARTICLE<br>
FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to cold-shrink articles for use in various applications. In particular, the present invention relates to cold-shrink articles formed from a composition including a fluorelastomer and an epichlorohydrin.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cold-shrink articles are used in a variety of different applications such as, for example, splicing together lengths of wire or cable and protecting, sealing, and/or insulating substrates from adverse environmental conditions. Examples of industries that use cold-shrink articles include the automobile, aerospace, power, telecommunication, chemical, and defense industries.<br>
A conventional cold-shrink article typically comprises a tubular member or other molded product that is capable of being expanded and mounted in an expanded state on a removable support core. The support core is typically hollow to allow the support core to be fed over a substrate. The support core is typically designed to collapse on demand and allow shrinkage of the cold-shrink article into contact with a substrate positioned inside the support core. For a given application, a cold-shrink article is typically selected that, when released from the core in the absence of a substrate, will shrink from the expanded state on the core to a relaxed state having an irmer diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the intended substrate. When deployed on the substrate, such sizing prevents the cold-shrink article from fully relaxing from the expanded state, which ensures a snug engagement between the cold-shrink article and the substrate. Once the cold-shrink article is conveyed onto the substrate, the cold-shrink article remains in a partially expanded state over the life of its engagement with the substrate.<br>
It is known to form cold-shrink articles from elastomeric compositions that include an elastomer to facilitate expansion and contraction of the article without breakage or cracking. Examples of known elastomers employed in cold-shrink articles include EPDM rubber or silicone rubber.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although known cold-shrink articles generally perform satisfactorily at low temperatures such as, for example, room temperature, it is desirable to increase the<br><br>
stability of cold-shrink articles at the elevated temperatures that may be in certain settings. In addition, it is desirable to increase the resistance of cold-shrink articles to degradation when exposed to acidic substances, caustic substances, or hydrocarbon fluids.<br>
A need exists for cold-shrink articles that may stably be used in elevated temperature environments and/or environments where exposure to acidic chemicals, caustic chemicals, or hydrocarbon fluids may occur.<br>
The present invention includes various elastomeric compositions that resist tearing at elevated temperatures. The elastomeric compositions include a fluoroelastomer and an eplichlorohydrin. In some embodiments, the elastomeric compositions include a pigment, an energy-beam absorbent, and/or a filler material.<br>
The present invention further includes cold-shrink articles including an elastomeric member formed from the elastomeric compositions. In one embodiment, the elastomeric member does not tear while being held for seven days at a temperature of 150°C in a 200% radially expanded state. In one embodiment, the elastomeric member includes an energy-beam induced identifier on an external surface of the elastomeric member.<br>
The present invention further includes methods for forming cold-shrink articles from the elastomeric compositions. In one embodiment, the cold-shrink articles are cured in an oxygen-free and/or water-free atmosphere. In another embodiment, the cold-shrink articles are irradiated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention includes elastomeric compositions that incorporate at least a fluorelastomer and an epichlorohydrin and includes cold-shrink articles formed from the elastomeric compositions. The term "epichloroydrin", as used herein, refers to any substance containing epichlroydrin, including any polymer containing epichlorohydrin monomers such as, for example, homopolymers, copolymer, terpolymers, and tetrapolymers that contain epichlorohydrin. The term "cold shrink", as used herein, is defined as the capability of an article (or a portion of an article) to shrink from an expanded state toward a relaxed, or a partially expanded, state at room temperature conditions (e.g., about 20°C - 25°C) and in the absence of heating. In some embodiments, cold-shrink articles of the present invention include an elastomeric member formed from an elastomeric composition that exhibits an improved chemical resistance and improved tear properties in expanded states at elevated temperatures.<br>
Elastomers are included in the elastomeric compositions of cold-shrink articles to allow the cold-shrink articles to expand from a relaxed state to an expanded state, while also allowing the articles to cold-shrink back toward the relaxed state. A mixture of fluoroelastomer and epichlorohydrin is included in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention. Some embodiments of cold-shrink articles of the present invention may be exposed, in an expanded state, to temperatures of at least about 150°C for an extended period of time without exhibiting, upon unaided visual inspection by a human eye, any splitting, tearing, or breakage.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all concentrations herein are expressed in parts by weight per hundred parts by weight rubber (phr), v^th the rubber defined to be the total weight of both fluoroelastomer and epichlorohydrin. Thus, as used herein, the phr of a particular component represents the parts by weight of the component relative to 100 total parts by weight of fluoroelastomer and epichlorohydrin.<br>
A wide range of concentrations of epichlorohydrin and fluoroelastomer may be included in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention. For example, in some<br><br>
embodiments, the concentration of fluoroelastomer in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention may range from about 10 parts or greater by weight of fluoroelastomer to about 60 parts or less by weight of fluoroelastomer, per 100 total parts by weight of fluoroelastomer and epichlorohydrin, and the concentration of epichlorohydrin in the elastomeric compositions may range from about 40 parts or greater by weight of epichlorohydrin to about 90 parts or less by weight of epichlorohydrin, per 100 total parts by weight of fluoroelastomer and epichlorohydrin. As used herein, in the context of polymers containing epichlorohydrin (e.g., homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and tetrapolymers that contain epichlorohydrin), parts by weight of epichlorohydrin refers to the total weight of the polymer containing the epichlorohydrin.<br>

Examples of suitable fluorinated elastomeric terpolymers include terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride. In some embodiments, the fluoroelastomer may be modified with iodine or another material to facilitate cross-linking of the fluoroelastomer.<br>
Examples of suitable epichlorohydrins for use in the elastomeric compositions of the present invention include homopolymers of epichlorohydrin, copolymers containing epichlorohydrin, terpolymers containing epichlorohydrin, and elastomeric polymers derived from epichlorohydrin and three or more different monomers.

The elastomeric composition of the present invention may be prepared by blending together the fluoroelastomer and the epichlorohydrin in an appropriate mixing apparatus. For example, the components of the elastomeric composition, including the fluoroelastomer and the epichlorohydrin, may generally be combined in any order in an appropriate mixing apparatus at a component temperature of about 60°C.<br>
Additional optional materials may also be included with the fluoroelastomer and the epichlorohydrin prior to mixing. If cross-linking agents or cross-linking co-agents are to be incorporated in the elastomeric composition, the components including the fluorelastomer and the epichlorohydrin may be blended together in a first mixing step as described above. The cross-linking agents and/or cross-linking co-agents may then be blended into the elastomeric composition in a second mixing step at a lower temperature than the first mixing temperature, such as between about 50°C and about 100°C, to prevent premature cross-linking.<br>
The elastomeric composition may then be formed into a cold-shrink article by any suitable process such as, for example, extrusion or molding. In some embodiments, the elastomeric composition of the cold-shrink article is cured, using a suitable curing process, to affect cross-linking of the elastomeric composition. Some examples of suitable curing processes include, for example, elevated temperature and pressure conditions (e.g., autoclaving), irradiation, or any other suitable curing process known in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, the cold-shrink article may be autoclaved in an oxygen-free and/or water-free atmosphere, with the oxygen-free and/or water-free atmosphere being<br><br>
'Used in place of steam. As used herein, unless otherwise stated, the term "oxygen-free atmosphere" refers to an atmosphere of a set volume of gas that includes less than about one volume percent oxygen, based on the total volume of the gas in the atmosphere, and the term "water-free atmosphere" refers to an atmosphere of a set volume of gas that includes less than about 0.1 volume percent water vapor, based on the total volume of the gas in the atmosphere. Examples of oxygen free-atmospheres include atmospheres including greater than about 99% by volume of nitrogen gas, argon gas, helium gas, xenon gas, neon gas, any other suitable inert gas, and combinations of any of these in any proportion. For example, tubing of the present invention may be autoclave-cured in a mold. As used herein, the term "tubing" refers to a hollow cylinder open on both ends. In one embodiment, the tubing is first formed (e.g., by extrusion) and then placed inside spiral grooves of an aluminum mold. The mold is placed in a heated press and subjected to a temperature of about 185°C and a pressure ranging from about 5-14 megapascals (Mpa) (about 75-200 psi). One end of the tubing is connected to a pressurized nitrogen gas supply containing about 99.5% nitrogen gas by volume. The mold may be purged for about two minutes with the pressurized nitrogen gas supply at a flow rate of about 40 cubic ft of the pressurized nitrogen gas. Any other purge time and flow rate sufficient to reduce oxygen and/or moisture to acceptable levels may also be used. After the initial purging, the mold is sealed off, and the pressure inside the mold may be maintained at about 200 pounds per square inch (psi) for about 20 minutes. The mold is then released and the pressure in the mold is allowed to return to atmospheric pressure. The tubing may then be removed from the mold and cooled.<br>
In another embodiment, the cold-shrink articles may be irradiated after being formed to cure the cold-shrink articles. Such curing may be accomplished, for example, by individually sealing the cold-shrink articles in polyethylene bags and subjecting the bags (and the contents of the bags) to an irradiation dosage of less than about 15 Mrads from a 4.5 MeV electron beam machine (commercially available from Radiation Dynamics Inc. of Edgewood, NY). In some embodiments, the elastomeric compositions employed in the cold-shrink articles to be irradiated may include an electron-beam sensitizer, such as triallyl isocyanurate (e.g., the TAIC DLC-A product commercially available from Natrochem Inc. of Savannah, GA).<br><br>
The elastomeric compositions of the present invention may be formed into cold-shrink articles of any shape or geometric configuration known in the art. Some non-exhaustive examples of cold-shrink articles include tubing, plaques, and multiple-branched structures (i.e., tube-like structures with multiple entrances and/or exits).<br>
Cold-shrink articles of the present invention (formed from elastomeric compositions of the present invention) may exhibit various advantageous mechanical properties in various combinations under various environmental conditions (e.g., room temperature or 150°C). In some embodiments, cold-shrink articles of the present invention such as tubing and plaques may exhibit an elongation at break of at least about 450% at room temperature and/or an elongation at break of at least about 250% at 150°C, when tested pursuant to the procedures of the Property Analysis and Characterization Procedure section of this document. Some embodiments of the cold-shrink articles of the present invention such as tubing and plaques may exhibit a percent permanent set of less than about 35% at lOO°C, when tested pursuant to the procedures of the Property Analysis and Characterization Procedure section. Furthermore, some embodiments of tubing and plaques formed from compositions of the present invention may exhibit a percent permanent set of less than about 25% at 100°C. In some embodiments, plaques formed from compositions of the present invention may exhibit a percent permanent set of less than about 20% at lOO°C.<br>
Various embodiments of the cold-shrink articles of the present invention resist tearing or splitting at elevated temperatures. For example, some embodiments of the cold-shrink articles of the present invention resist tearing when maintained in an expanded state for an extended period of time (e.g, seven days in a 200%) radially-expanded state) at an elevated temperature of about 150°C.<br>
Various embodiments of the cold-shrink articles of the present invention exhibit chemical resistance to substances such as, for example, diesel fuel and hydraulic fluid. Some embodiments of the cold-shrink articles of the present invention exhibit a percent weight increase of less than about 25% when immersed in diesel fuel at about 49°C for 24 hours and/or a percent weight increase of less than about 10% when immersed in hydraulic fluid at about 71°C for 24 hours.<br><br>
I<br>
A tubular cold-shrink article 10 of the present invention is depicted in FIG. 1 in an initial relaxed state prior to any expansion. The cold-shrink article 10 includes a radial wall 11, an inner surface 14, and an outer surface 16.<br>
When cold-shrink article 10 is in the initial relaxed state, the radial wall 11 has a longitudinal length A, an inner diameter B, an outer diameter C, and a layer thickness D. The longitudinal length A and the inner diameter B may vary based upon individual needs of a given application, such as for example, the dimensions of a substrate about which the cold-shrink article 10 will be placed. The outer diameter C is generally determined by the inner diameter B and the layer thickness D, where the layer thickness D is ordinarily substantially uniform both around a circumference E and along the length A of the cold-shrink article 10. The layer thickness D is desirably thin enough to allow the cold-shrink article 10 to readily expand from the initial relaxed state upon application of expansion forces.<br>
Examples of suitable layer thickness D range from as low as about 0.060 inches to as high as about 0.25 inches. Examples of suitable inner diameter B range from as low as about 0.2 inches to as high as about 3 inches.<br>
Various stages of a method for deploying the cold-shrink article 10 are depicted in FIGS. 2-5, The cold-shrink article 10 is depicted in an expanded state on the core 18 in FIG. 2. A substrate 20 is shown in FIG. 3 to be inserted into the core 18, which supports the expanded form of the cold-shrink article 10. The cold-shrink article 10 partially deployed from the core 18 onto the substrate 20 is depicted in FIG. 4. The cold-shrink article 10 fully deployed on the substrate 20 is depicted in FIG. 5. The cold-shrink article 10 may protect substrate 20 and/or may identify the substrate 20, which may, for example, comprise a wire, a cable, a fluid-carrying pipe, or a conduit.<br>
To deploy the cold-shrink article 10 on the substrate 20, the cold-shrink article 10 is first cross-sectionally (or radially) expanded from the initial relaxed state to the expanded state and oriented on the core 18, as depicted in FIG. 2. As used herein, the terms "expanded", "expansion", "expanded state", and the like, refer to a cross-sectional expansion that increases inner diameter B and outer diameter C, as opposed to a longitudinal expansion that increases longitudinal length A. though such a longitudinal expansion is permissible. The cold-shrink article 10 may be expanded and placed onto the core 18 in any conventional manner. The core 18 may generally have any structure that is<br><br>
suitable for retaining the cold-shrink article 10 in the expanded state.   For example, the core 18 may be a rigid, hollow, plastic tube.<br>
When the cold-shrink article 10 is in the expanded state, as best depicted in FIG. 2, the radial wall 11 has a longitudinal length A', an inner diameter B', an outer diameter C' and a wall thickness D' Due to the expansion, the inner diameter B' and the outer diameter C are larger than the inner diameter B and the outer diameter C, respectively. Suitable expansion of the cold-shrink article 10 may generally range from about 150% to about 400%, where the expansion is characterized in terms of the percent expansion of the inner diameter B relative to the inner diameter B'. Particularly suitable expansion of the cold-shrink article 10 may generally range from about 200% to about 300%.<br>
The substrate 20 may be inserted within the core 18 holding the expanded form of the cold-shrink article 10, as depicted in FIG. 3. In some embodiments, the substrate 20 may be centered within the hollow portion of the core 18 using guide fmgers (not shown) contained within the core 18. After the substrate 20 is inserted within the core 18, the cold-shrink article 10 is conveyed from the core 18 onto the substrate 20, as depicted in FIG. 4. The conveyance may be accomplished in a variety of manners, such as by sliding the cold-shrink article 10 from the core 18 onto the substrate 20, or by collapsing and removing the core 18 and thereby allowing the cold-shrink article 10 to encompass and come into engagement with the substrate 20.<br>
When the cold-shrink article 10 is removed from the core 18, the cold-shrink article 10 cold shrinks from the expanded state toward (but not necessarily all the way to) the initial relaxed state. Whether or not the cold-shrink article 10 reaches the relaxed state depends on the diameter of the substrate 20. The substrate 20 may have a diameter that allows the cold-shrink article 10 to substantially return to the initial relaxed state and substantially regain the inner diameter B and the outer diameter C, as best depicted in FIG. 4. The inner diameter B of cold-shrink article 10 in the initial relaxed state may be slightly smaller than the exterior diameter of the substrate 20, which prevents the cold-shrink article 10 from fully shrinking back to the initial relaxed state, and thereby provides a snug and secure fit and engagement of the cold-shrink article 10 onto peripheral surfaces of the substrate 20. When the cold-shrink article 10 is fully deployed on the substrate 20. the inner surface 14 of the cold-shrink article 10 extends around, faces, and is typically in contact with the outer surface 22 of the substrate 20, as shovm in FIG. 5.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the outer surface 16 of the cold-shnnk article w may include identifiers in the form of optional indicia 24, which may provide, for example, information relating to the cold-shrink article 10 and/or the substrate 20. The indicia 24 may be a single mark or a plurality of marks, and may include a variety of textual (i.e., alphanumeric) or graphical characters, symbols, and the like. The indicia 24 may also be or include machine-readable indicia, such as bar codes. Also, the indicia 24 may have a surface texture that is different from the texture of portions of the outer surface 16 other than the indicia 24.<br>
The indicia 24 may be formed using any suitable process including, for example, ink application to the outer surface 16 and/or focused energy beam marking of the outer surface 16. A focused energy beam refers to a directionally focused stimulated emission of radiation, such as a laser beam. The indicia 24, in the form of energy-beam induced indicia, may be formed, for example, by expanding the cold-shrink article 10 from the initial relaxed state, marking the outer surface 16 by application of energy from a focused energy beam, and allowing the cold-shrink article 10 to cold shrink back toward the initial relaxed state.<br>
To facilitate formation of energy-beam induced indicia, the elastomeric compositions of the present invention may include an energy beam absorbent. Such energy beam absorbents, upon heating by a focused energy beam, may be employed to provide the indicia 24 with a different color than the color of the outer surface 16 other than the indicia. In this way, the color of the indicia 24 may contrast with the color of the outer surface 16 so the indicia are prominent and legible. If a high visual legibility of the indicia 24 is desired, both a pigment and an energy beam absorbent may be included in the elastomeric composition to provide a high contrast between the base color of the outer surface 16 and the contrasting color of the indicia 24. For further discussion regarding energy-beam induced identifiers and methods for marking cold-shrink articles, see Application No. 10/806,811 filed on March 23,2004 and entitled "Cold-Shrink Marker Sleeve."<br>
In some embodiments, indicia 24 are legible to an unaided eye of an individual with 20/20 vision located at least about 36 centimeters away from indicia 24 when the cold-shrink article 10 is in an expanded state or a relaxed state.<br><br>
Information pertaining to the cold-shrink article 10 and/or the substrate 20 may also be conveyed to a user by a base color of the outer surface 16 of the cold-shrink article 10. For example, a blue base color of the outer surface 16 may convey different information to a user than a yellow or black base color. In some embodiments, the cold-shrink article 10 may include both the indicia 24 and an information-conveying base color of the outer surface 16.<br>
Cold-shrink articles of the present invention may include a plurality of elastomeric members. A branched cold-shrink article 30 of the present invention, in a relaxed state prior to expansion, is depicted in FIG. 6. The cold-shrink article 30 may include a plurality of hollow, elastomeric portions (or members) 32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D that each have the inner surface 14 and the outer surface 16. The respective inner surfaces 14 define elongate cavities (not shown) through each of the elastomeric portions 32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D that are in communication with each other.<br>
When the hollow elastomeric portions 32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D are stretched to the expanded state, cores 18 may be inserted within the expanded portions 32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D, as depicted in FIG. 7, to maintain the portions 32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D in the expanded state. The cold-shrink article 30 (portions 32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D) may be deployed on one or more substrates 20 from the expanded states on the cores 18 pursuant to the methods described above in relation to deployment of the cold-shrink article 10.<br>
Cold-shrink articles of the present invention may include corrugations that allow the cold-shrink articles to exhibit a longitudinal length in a non-corrugated relaxed state that is substantially longer than the longitudinal length of the cold-shrink articles when positioned on a removable core in an expanded, corrugated state. A cold-shrink article 40, which is partially deployed from the core 18 onto the outer surface 22 of the substrate 20, is depicted in FIG. 8. When in the expanded state on the core 18, the cold-shrink article 40 includes a multitude of corrugations 42. As illustrated by the cold-shrunk portion 44, after release from the core 18, unsupported corrugated portions of the cold-shrink article 40 extend longitudinally and the corrugations formerly present in the unsupported portions effectively disappear as the cold-shrunk portion 44 approaches the initial relaxed state. PROPERTY ANALYSIS AND CHARACTERIZATION PROCEDURES<br>
Various analytical techniques may be used to characterize the properties of cold-shrink articles of the present invention.  Details about these analytical techniques follow.<br><br>
As used'herein, "ASTM D412" refers to ASTM D412 - 98a (Reapproved 2002) entitled<br>
"Standard   Test  Methods  for  Vulcanized  Rubber  and  Thermoplastic  Elastomers  -<br>
Tension", which was published in January 2003 and is available from the American<br>
Society for Testing and Materials International of West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.<br>
I.	Mechanical Property Tests<br>
A.        Elongation at Break and Stress at Break<br>
Determinations of the stress at break and percent elongation at break for dumbbells formed from the elastomeric compositions of the present invention are performed pursuant to the procedures of Test Method A of ASTM D412 using a tensiTECH III tensile tester commercially available from Tech Pro of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.<br>
A method described below similar to Test Method B of ASTM D412 may be used to determine the elongation at break for ring samples cut from tubing formed from elastomeric compositions of the present invention. According to the method employed herein, ring samples, having a longitudinal width of about 3/8 of an inch, are cut from the tubing, and the ring samples are placed in a tensile testing apparatus. Each end of each ring sample is secured to a jaw between two 0.124 inch-diameter pins attached to each jaw. The jaws of the tensile tester apparatus are then pulled in opposite directions at a rate of about 20 inches/minute and the strain and break loads are recorded. Unless otherwise stated herein, the elongation at break and stress at break tests are performed in a temperature-controlled box at a temperature of about 150°C, with the test samples conditioned for about 6 ±2 minutes at 150°C before conducting the tests.<br><br><br><br>
To determine the percent permanent set for plaques, dumbbell test specimens are cut from plaques pursuant to the procedures of Test Method A of ASTM D-412. Parallel bench marks separated by a distance of an inch are placed at the approximate center of each dumbell. The dumbbells are placed in a set fixture and stretched until the distance between the bench marks equals 2 inches, which correlates to 100% strain. The loaded set fixture is then placed in a 100°C oven for 3 hours. After 3 hours, the fixtures are removed from the oven and the stretched dumbbells are allowed to cool at room temperature (2FC ± 2°C) for 1 hour. The stretched dumbbells are removed from the set fixture and placed on a smooth wooden or cardboard surface. The distance between the parallel bench marks is measured after waiting 30±2 minutes. The percent permanent set is determined using the formula provided above with the original length equaling 1 inch, the test length equaling 2 inches, and the relaxed length equaling the final distance between the bench marks after cooling.<br>
To determine the percent permanent set for tubing, ring samples having a length of 3/8 of an inch are cut from the tubing and the initial diameters of the ring samples are measured. The ring samples are then inserted over a steel mandrel having a diameter about twice the internal diameter of the tubing ring samples, which causes the ring samples to radially stretch about 100% in diameter. An end of the mandrel is equipped with a conical shape to facilitate inserting &amp; removing the mandrel from the ring samples. While stretched on the mandrel, the ring samples are placed in a 100°C oven for 3 hours. After expiration of the 3-hour period, the mandrel and stretched ring samples are removed from the oven and allowed to cool at room temperature (2IT ± 2T ) for 1 hour. The ring samples are then removed from the mandrel and placed on a smooth wooden or cardboard surface. The internal diameters of the ring samples are measured after passage of 30±2 minutes, and the following formula is used to compute the percent permanent set of the<br><br><br>
Tubing split tests are conducted to illustrate the tear properties of the cold-shrink articles over time. The test is conducted using tubing samples prepared from elastomeric compositions of the present invention pursuant to the methods described above. Samples of tubing having a length of about 3 to 4 inches are cut and placed over steel mandrels, which have a diameter about three times the internal diameter of the tubing samples. As such, the tubing samples are expanded radially by about 200%. While retained in a state of about 200% radial expansion, the samples are placed in a 150°C oven for seven days. After expiration of the seven-day period, the elongated samples are visually inspected for signs of tearing. Tubing samples are deemed to have failed the split test if any tearing or splitting is visually observed by an unaided human eye.<br>
II.	Fluid Resistance Tests<br>
The fluid resistance of cold-shrink articles of the present invention is determined by cutting dumbbell test specimens (pursuant to the methods of Test Method A of ASTM D412) from plaques formed from compositions of the present invention. The test specimens are weighed individually and then immersed in either hydraulic fluid or diesel fuel in wide test tubes. The test tubes containing the diesel fuel are placed in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of about 49°C for 24 hours and the test tubes containing the hydraulic fluid were placed in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of about 71°C for 24 hours. The test specimens are then removed from test tubes, padded dry with filter paper, and weighed individually. The respective percent absorptions of diesel fuel and hydraulic fluid for the test specimens are then computed using the initial weights and the final weights of the dumbbell test specimens.<br>
III.	Laser Marking Test<br>
The visual legibility of the indicia is qualitatively determined for cold-shrink articles pursuant to the following procedure. Tubing without indicia, having a 1.0 mm outer diameter, is expanded onto a core with a 2.0 cm diameter. The expanded tubing is then laser marked to form indicia by a Nd:YAG laser system. The Nd:YAG laser system is commercially availably under the trade name "Hi-Mark" No. 400 from GSI Lumonics, Inc. of Kanata, Ontario, Canada. The laser settings for the Nd:YAG laser system include a power setting of 64.8 watts, a rate of marking 5.1 cm/minute, and a frequency of 6 wave peaks per second. The set distance of the laser system head to the outer surface of the tubing is 18.3 cm (7.2 inches). The indicia is marked so the indicia, with the tubing in the<br><br>
-expanded state, exhibits a type-face height in a circumferential direction about the tubing<br>
of 2.0 mm.<br>
After marking, the tubing is removed from the core and allowed to substantially cold shrink back toward the relaxed state. The indicia on the tubing substantially in the relaxed state is then visually observed by an unaided human eye. The marking is determined to be acceptable if the indicia (exhibiting a type-face height of 2.0 mm) on the tubing is visually legible by an unaided human eye (i.e., about 20/20 vision) from a distance of at least about 36 cm (about 14 inches).<br>

Examples 1-3 concern cold-shrink articles of the present invention in the form of tubing and plaques. The component concentrations of the elastomeric compositions used to form the cold-shrink articles of Examples 1-3 are provided in Table 1. The elastomeric compositions of Examples 1 -3 were prepared by combining the first fourteen components provided in Table 1 in a first mixing step, and then mixing these components in a<br><br>
 Banburry mixer at between about 20 and 40 revolution-per-minute for about 20 minutes at a temperature of about 60°C. The compositions were then further mixed in a 2-roll mixing mill heated to about 50°C for about 5 minutes. The TAIC DLC-A listed in Table 1 was then added to each composition in a second mixing step and the compositions were mixed for an additional 5 minutes. The compositions were then sheeted out in conventional fashion and cooled to the ambient temperature (22-24°C).<br><br>
T3000L and DAI-EL G-801. Physical Properties Tests for Examples 1-3<br>
The elastomeric compositions of Examples 1 -3 were extruded into tubing having an internal diameter of about 0.25 inches and a wall thickness of about 0.18 cm using a VA-inch extruder with a L/D ratio of 20. The extrusions were done at a barrel temperature of about 60°C and a die temperature between about SO^'C and 60^*0. The resulting tubing was cured in an oxygen-free atmosphere. The percent permanent set at lOO'^C, split resistance at 150°C for 7 days, stress at break at 150°C, and percent elongation at break at 150°C for the tubing of the compositions of Examples 1-3 were determined. The results of these tests are included in Table 2.<br>
In addition, plaques were prepared by placing the compositions of Examples ]-3 into molds and compression molding and curing the plaques at about ISS'^C under a pressure of about 5-10 Mpa for 15 minutes.    This yielded plaques that were about 15 cm<br><br>
long, about 10 cm long, and about 0.18 cm thick. The stress at break at room temperature, percent elongation at break at room temperature, and percent permanent set at 1 OO^C test results for dumbbells cut from the plaques also are included in Table 2. The percent elongation and break and percent permanent set tests for the dumbbell samples were performed at room temperature.<br><br>
The data provided in Table 2 illustrates the expansion capabilities, durability, and tear performance at elevated temperatures of cold-shrink articles formed from the elastomeric compositions of Examples 1-3. The tubing samples of Examples 1-3 each exhibited a percent permanent set of less than 30%, with tubing samples of Examples 1 and 2 exhibiting percent permanent sets of less than 25%. In addition, all six tubing samples formed from each of the compositions of Examples 1 and 2 passed the extended split test provided in the Property Analysis and Characterization Procedures section of this document.<br>
The dumbbell samples cut from plaques formed from the elastomeric samples of Examples 1-3 each exhibited a percent permanent set of less than 25% and a percent elongation at break at room temperature substantially greater than 250%.<br>
In addition, the tubing samples of Examples 1-3 all marked well with a YAG laser and passed the laser marking test, when tested pursuant to the laser-marking procedures including  in the Property Analysis  and Characterization Procedures  section  of this document. Example 4<br><br>
The chemical resistance of dumbbell samples cut from plaques, formed from a composition similar to the composition of Example 1 and prepared by a procedure like that used for the composition of Example 1, was tested pursuant to the fluid resistance test procedures described above in Property Analysis and Characterization Procedures section of this document. The composition of Example 4 was generally the same as the composition of Example 1, except the Example 4 composition included 20 phr (weight basis) of AEROSIL® R974 based on the total weight of T3000L and DAI-EL G800 and did not include any Armoslip CP. The plaques were prepared pursuant to the method used to prepare the plaques of Example 1. After the dumbbell samples were subjected to the chemical resistance tests, the elongation at break and strain at break of the dumbbell samples was assessed at room temperature to determine the affects the chemicals had on the mechanical properties of the dumbbells. The results of these chemical resistance, stress at break, and elongation at break tests are included in Table 3.<br><br>
The data provided in Table 3 illustrates the chemical resistance of cold-shrink articles formed from the compositions of the present invention. As shown in Table 3, the dumbbell samples exhibited a percent weight increase in 49°C diesel fuel of 6.69% (substantially below the 25 % percent maximum threshold required by Military Spec, SC-X15111B, September 27, 1984) and a percent weight increase in 7PC hydraulic fluid of 1.31 % (substantially below the 10% weight increase maximum threshold required by Military Spec, SC-X15111B, September 27, 1984).<br>
In addition, as shown in Table 3, the strain at break and the elongation at break for the dumbbell samples immersed in the diesel fuel and the hydraulic fluid did not change<br><br>
substantially as compared to the control sample.   The dumbbell samples immersed in diesel fuel and hydraulic fluid each exhibited an elongation at break at room temperature of greater than 450%. Examples 5 &amp; 6<br>
Examples 5 and 6 concern cold-shrink articles formed from elastomeric compositions including carbon black. The component concentrations of the elastomeric composition used to form the cold-shrink articles of Examples 5 and 6 are provided in Table 4. The elastomeric composition of Examples 5 and 6 were prepared pursuant to the mixing procedures provided above for the compositions employed in Examples 1-3.<br><br>
DAI-EL G-801. Mechanical Properties and Chemical Resistance of Examples 5 and 6<br>
Plaques and tubing were formed from the compositions of both Examples 5 and 6 pursuant to the procedures provided for the cold-shrink articles of Examples 1-3. Percent permanent set at 100°C, stress at break at 150°C, elongation at break at 150°C, extended split test at 150°C results for the tubing of Examples 5 and 6 are included in Table 5. In addition, the stress at break at room temperature, elongation at break at room temperature, diesel fuel absorption at 49°C, and hydraulic fluid absorption at 71°C test results for the plaques of Examples 5 and 6 are included in Table 5.<br><br><br>
The data provided in Table 5 further illustrates the expansion capabilities, durability, and tear performance of cold-shrink articles formed from the elastomeric compositions of Examples 1-3. The tubing samples of Examples 5-6 each passed the extended split test; each exhibited a percent elongation at break at 150°C greater than 250%; and each exhibited a percent permanent set of less than 30%, with the tubing samples of Example 6 exhibiting a percent permanent set of less than 25%. The dumbbell samples cut from plaques formed from the elastomeric compositions of Examples 5 and 6 each exhibited a percent permanent set substantially less than 25%) and a percent elongation at break at room temperature substantially greater than 250%.<br>
