				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a distribution system for a telephone and television signal paid for by electronic card,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modular telephone management systems are nowadays known that manage billing of telephone and television services. The introduction of new services in the public telephone market with the appearance of public residence telephones, of the type known as public residence telephones, hospital applications such as television control UCTV and automatic card dispensers DATT, together with the need of a decentralized management of the terminals require the use of a telephone management system which satisfies the needs created by the development of these applications.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention concerns a television and telephone signal distribution system for installation in residence centres, such as hospitals, allowing the user to employ electronic cards of different types as a means of payment, and allowing automatic determination and billing of the amount demanded by the payee in agreement with the service acquired by the user by codification of the information relevant to pricing in the same service signal.<br>
More specifically, the invention refers to a television and telephone signal distribution system in which the functions of card purchase, pricing of television channels, control and billing of telephone and television service,<br><br>
-IB-translation of signals associated to pricing and fraud prevention are integrated.<br>
The sphere of application of the invention, although it has been designed specifically for use with television systems, is not limited to this but could extend to other automatic devices, such as coffee machines, transportation ticket vending machines, and the like.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a distribution system for a telephone and television signal paid for by electronic card, of the type installed in public residential centres, such as hospitals, for distributing a television signal to be paid or freely broadcast and a telephone signal, which allows pricing of the different channels and services by modulating the amplitude of said signal and encoding in the same information associated to the charge corresponding to each service, characterized in that it is composed of a block for the function of reception which encompasses functions of reception and encoding of the signal for pricing, a block for the user function which comprises a telephone set, a Television Control Unit UCTV, a Power Control Unit UCA and a headphone jack, a block for the Control Function made up by a Modular telephone Maintenance Centre CMTM, a block for the pricing Function incorporating an impulse translator to read the signal price and a block for the Issuing Function composed of an automatic card dispenser (DATT).<br><br>
2<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The system of the invention consists basically of five functional blocks, to wit:<br>
1) A reception function block which carries out signal reception, including possible decoding of the same, and which encodes in said signal information relating to the pricing of the television channels served. Said block incorporates, as a specific device, an Antenna Unit UANT to carry out these functions;<br>
2) A user functions block which includes a telephone set, a television control unit UCTV, a power control unit UCA and a headphone jack;<br>
3) A control function block composed of the specific equipment known as Modular Telephone Maintenance Centre CMTM;<br>
4) A telephone exchange pricing function block in which is installed, if required, a impulse translator needed for pricing of the telephone service;<br>
5) An issuing function block consisting of an automatic telephone card issuing device.<br>
The antenna unit UANT of the reception block alters the signal received by the antenna (conventional or parabolic) or alternatively a video signal. Said alteration consists of the introduction of an additional signal which carries information associated to each group of channels in which is included the pricing information and, if required, any other additional information. The antenna unit input is a conventional video signal or a radiofrequency signal, and the output is the amplified signal codified with the aforementioned information distributed to the entire complex by a coaxial cable.<br>
In the user's room is installed a Television. Control Unit UCTV, a power Control Unit, UCA, a telephone set and a headphone jack. The telephone set is ideally a residential public telephone allowing card payment. In the set is supplied a screen for reading messages such as the time, card balance and other information for the user. The telephone service allows restriction of traffic at certain times, provides a modem connection, provides detailed pricing information for all extensions, information on incoming and outgoing calls, traffic saturation and call statistics. The system provides maximum security levels for both the user and the operator with loop supervision and<br><br>
3<br>
automatic line cut-off when the line is manipulated or tapped. As are all the system elements, the telephone set is controlled by the CMTM Modular Telephone Maintenance Centre. The Television Control Unit UCTV controls both the television and the Power Control Unit UCA, which consists of an auxiliary plate, providing an audio output line to the headphone jack and manages and prices the different television channel groups provided to the user, generating use and billing statistics which are sent to the CMTM. It maintains constant communication with the telephone set and depends on it to send information, parameter messages, alarms, charges and daily routines. In said Television Control Unit a simple user interface is supplied which consists of a message screen, function keys and areas for static placing of information with operating instructions, etc. The Unit works with electronic chip cards and performs billing based on the time a channel is used and the pricing established by the Antenna Unit UANT. The Television Control Unit informs the user via the message screen of the operation, which may be credited, and the card removed, or charged when needed with the card introduced. If credit is available, the UCTV allows viewing of the television and if free channels are selected no credit is required. All UCTV parameters may be modified from a distance by the CMTM.<br>
The Power Control Unit UCA is controlled by the UCTV and enables or disables power to the television set, so that it is shut off when credit is exhausted or the provisional operation window does not allow viewing.<br>
The television set is a conventional commercial receiver, but it includes a modification in the euroconnector connection. Connection to the power lines is through the UCA, the antenna input is connected to the television signal distribution system and the euroconnector is connected to the UCTV. The television set may be operated with a remote control unit and volume may be adjusted by a variable resistor placed in the headphone jack.<br>
The Modular Telephone Maintenance Centre, CMTM, controls the entire system and consists of a PC type computer with four lines connected to the devices it manages by modem. On this computer runs a management software application in charge of storing information on use, location and pricing of all equipment connected and at the same time produces reports and operation<br><br>
4<br>
statistics of this equipment. The CMTM controls the telephone sets, the UCTV's and the automatic telephone card dispensers DATT.<br>
Between the telephone central switchboard connected to the system and<br>
the PABX exchange is placed a impulse translator which is in charge of two<br>
tasks. On one hand it adapts the pricing calculation signal so that it passes<br>
cleanly through the switchboard and is correctly interpreted by the telephone<br>
set, an on the other hand it serves as a security system to detect frauds in the<br>
line, by said telephone set sending an echo which is recognised by the<br>
translator.	<br>
Issuing machines DATT may issue two types of products: telephone telecards and headsets. The DATT sells cards of different values or credit and stores sales information which it sends to the CMTM which manages it.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the television and telephone signal distribution system for the present invention. As this Figure shows, the reception function is represented by block (1), in which the signal received through an antenna ANT or a video VCR is modified so that it allows control of the television signal. The UANT antenna unit allows, by introducing an additional signal in the channels required, latter identification of each group of channels, their pricing and other additional information. The antenna unit UANT (10) has as a typical input a radiofrequency or video signal, and as output an amplifier which distributes the signal to the entire system, preferably through a coaxial cable.<br>
Each block (2, 2') joined to block (1) representative of the reception function, represents the user's room and provides the respective users of the centres where the system is installed (in particular hospitals) with the possibility of having individualised telephone and television, paying for said service, as mentioned above, by universal cards. The block incorporates a television control unit UCTV (20), a power control unit UCA (35), a specific telephone set T (45), a connection jack for a headset (not shown) and a<br><br>
6 television set TV which preferably may be controlled by a remote control unit.<br>
Block (4), representing pricing function, incorporates a PABX telephone exchanger (41), connected to each terminal T (45) of the user blocks (2, 2') and also connected via a impulse translator TR (40) to block (3) representing the CMTM Modular Telephone Maintenance Centre, which is also shown to be connected to the RTB block representing the Basic Telephone Network. On its part, the PABX exchanger (41) is connected to block (5), representing DATT machines or devices which issue cards. Just as for the other blocks, the function of each of these elements has been previously explained.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram corresponding to a specific design of a CMTM Modular Telephone Maintenance Centre which, in accordance with the invention, intends to increase the performance of existing CMTM's. Said center is conceived as a low-cost management system, and is primarily intended for managing telephones of other institutions, or for own telephone systems isolated from other systems. Among future expansions of the system based on the previous design are projected increases in number and types of telephone sets, connection to other management systems of the SGTM (Modular Telephone Management Systems) and management of other devices (UCTV and DATT).<br>
The CMTM in block (3) has as its main functions the control and supervision of the telephone system. These functions consist of the following: System maintenance functions, supporting operations of connection, disconnection, modification, visualising and listing of the system telephones, which implies generating data corresponding to the different telephones (identification, location, route, configuration, associated parameters,...); Parameter function, which supports maintenance operations of the parameter tables, such as connection, disconnection, modification, visualising and listing tables, generating a data base which includes all updated parameters of the sets (billing, coins, cards, fraud, numbers, intake and other) in such a way that message parameters of the telephone are also generated and sent; System conservation function (failures, routes and charges), performing the tasks of<br><br>
7<br>
failure acceptance, management of outstanding failures, generation of repair bulletins for technicians, management of charges received and process, and sending routing guides for repair personnel, this task implying generation of conservation data base and maintenance of data on repairs outstanding and historical failure-repair pair records; Traffic management function, which performs tasks of reception and processing of traffic messages in which are contained statistical information collected daily by the telephone, and which gives rise to the generation of the corresponding data base with traffic information; Intake management function, which performs tasks of reception and processing of intake information in which is included information on the coins introduced in the telephone coin box, and through which the intake data base is generated; Statistics creation function, which allows the statistical grouping of information stored in the CMTM (3) data base; and the Centre administration function, which allows and facilitates tasks of system, application and data base maintenance, (administration, backup copies, erasing of useless information, etc.).<br>
On its part, the user shall have a means of access to the data base, in a read mode, while the function of connection to other applications will allow the information stored in the data base to be sent to the corresponding management system or to other business applications.<br>
Furthermore, the management software of the CMTM (3) allows computerisation of maintenance operations, which consist basically of real-time knowledge of the failure status and the possibility of automatic guidance of the technical repair personnel; in addition, the ease of operation of the system must be pointed out, based on easily operated menus, and management of information regarding failures, traffic and intake is possible. Computerisation of maintenance operations allows unattended use of the system (automatic guiding of technical repair personnel), while the tools supplied allow the user to create "tailor-made" reports.<br>
As regards integration of the CMTM (3) in the general structure of the SGTM, it is made easier by the compatibility of the messages used, in repair routes, in the similarity of the information stored in the data base and in the possibility of exchanging basic information through a data exchange network.<br><br>
8<br>
Telephones depending on the CMTM must be compatible functionally, in communications and message protocols, with modular telephones not connected to the UVI.<br>
As refers to the architecture of CMTM (3) represented in figure 2, it can be seen that it includes software for the management of the different functions it may serve and hardware which includes different interfaces for its connection to other external elements, such as an IRTB interface for its connection to the RTB, an IU user interface for connection to an external user and a printer interface II for connection to the corresponding printing device. Figure 2 also shows the representation of the RTB block of Basic Telephone Network, of the TM block of a modular telephone, of user block (2) which incorporates set (45) and ,the Television Control Unit UCTV, as well as block (5) corresponding to the DATT function and block AC corresponding to business applications,<br>
The general structure of the CMTM (3) has therefore been preserved with respect to the previous model, but several alterations have been introduced needed for the present situation, among which are the inclusion on the ISA bus of the PC of several modem plates and the modification, from a software point of view, of the communications module so it may manage several channels simultaneously, as well as the inclusion of a high speed channel driver.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 of the drawings, one can see a simplified block diagram of the connections between the reception function block and the user function block of the system of the present invention. The Figure shows an antenna unit (10) in reception block (1), with an input electronically connected to an antenna or VCR, and an output connected to an amplifier from which the signal is distributed to the different control units (20) included in the user function block (2) and from these to the corresponding television sets TV.<br>
From a functional point of view, antenna unit (10) is in charge of tuning an input television channel, adding the corresponding pricing information to the channel or group of channels (whether it is free or paid) and modulating the resulting signal (video, audio and data) in an output channel. The composite signal arrives at the control unit through the television's euroconnector and<br><br>
9<br>
once there it is processed. Parameters relating to input and output channels and to pricing information may be updated by the Maintenance Terminal of the Identification and Validation Unit (UVI) connected to the equipment for this purpose. Through this terminal the parameters stored may be seen at any time.<br>
The practical construction of this unit shall be preferably performed in a single plate, obviously making maintenance easier. This shall be aided by internal supervision routines and sending failure information to the television control unit.<br>
As for Figures 4 and 5 in the drawings, these show respectively views of the front panel and the upper panel of the Antenna Unit (10) in which are shown the situations of the different external elements associated to it. Thus, in Figure 4 one may see an antenna input connector (11) for the radiofrequency tuner which controls the channel and other functions digitally through the I2C bus; input and output connectors (12, 13) of the modulator where all parameters of modulation are programmed through the 12C bus; a euroconnector (14), by which the antenna unit (10) and a television signal decoder are connected; and a connector (15) for the power line. Figure 5 regards the upper panel of the antenna unit UAN (10) and shows a set of luminous indicators (16) preferably composed of LED's, conveniently numbered by which the value of the "group indicator" programmed in the unit is known, so that in the event a failure is detected this situation is shown by the alternate illumination of, for example, two previously selected diodes; a connector (17) for the maintenance terminal and a connector (18) for series communication.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 of the drawings show perspective views of an example of an embodiment of the Television Control Unit of the present invention, by which management and control of the television and video services in the environment of use is performed, in particular in a hospital environment.<br>
As shown in Figure 1 described above, the UCTV is integrated in block (2) of the user function, and is electrically connected to the antenna unit (10) whose block diagram appears in Figure 3, to the power control unit UCA (35), to the terminal (T) and to the television set TV, in order to carry out the<br><br>
10<br>
functions described above. This UCTV unit allows the user to see the desired television channel, choosing the method of payment, and is provided with functional elements such as an alphanumeric screen, function keys, warnings in different languages, etc., all of this in order to help the user in the different operation phases, and it is also provided with a bell connector for a remote device, which allows external access via connection with the residential telephone.<br>
An example of a preferred embodiment shown in Figures 6 and 7 includes perspective views from the top and bottom of the unit placed horizontally (Figure 6) and a front view of the unit placed vertically. As seen in the Figures, the unit includes a set of external elements which, on the upper or front part, include a set (21) of functional keys, of which the one labelled (21a) is used for switching languages, (21b) and (21c) are respectively forward and back keys, and (21d) is a validation-power key. One can also see a slot (22) used to introduce the card used for payment; a screen (23), preferably an LCD screen, in charge of showing different messages for the user and the technical personnel while in test operation; and lastly one can see information areas (24) and (25) which are areas of a predetermined size, slightly on relief with respect to the outer surface. On the lower side, as seen in Figure 6, connections (26, 27 28) exist for respectively the power source, the transition plate placed on the support (euroconnector input) and the residential telephone (internal data connection); lastly, there are also channels (11, 12, 13) in relief on the wall of the unit intended to provide channels for the different outputs.<br>
On the inside the unit has a set of elements around a microprocessor device, including RAM and EPROM memories, a real time clock, input-output ports, connectors for different security modules, a card reader, a metal filament detector for the card, as well as other connectors for external elements (data input terminal and statistics output or even direct connection to the residential telephone, earphones, euroconnector and/or television power and control).<br>
Figure 8 shows a representation of a block diagram of the connections between the three elements of user function block (2) projected in the present invention. In this sense, block (35) corresponding to the plate which contains the UCA power control unit shows an external connection to the power supply<br><br>
11<br>
and in its interior there are sub-blocks representing switch in charge of establishing power connection/shutoff with block (20) and with block TV, and a power transformer for the television control unit (20). Said control unit (20) is connected to the TV block by the euroconnector (14) and by a number of lines intended for audio and video input/output, and control output to the TV block, while in the latter TV block the RF radio frequency input is shown.<br>
Lastly, Figures 9 and 10 show configurations of the two operation modes of the impulse translator (40) projected by the invention. The need for a impulse translator arises from the use of the residential telephone in different environments, such as connection to PABX exchangers (20) where their bandwidth prevents the pricing information to reach the extensions, or 12 kHz signals created by the conmutation central, or line protection to external break-in.<br>
In general, the impulse translator may operate in two modes: integrated as an auxiliary element within the hospital public telephone system, or independently, connected directly to the analog line of the central to which a set is connected when one desires to protect it from external intrusions, the mode of operation being selected preferably by a set of microswitches within the system.<br>
As regards Figure 9, that is, the operation mode integrated in the hospital public telephone system, the impulse translator (40) is placed on the analog input lines to the corresponding PABX exchanger (41)so that it converts 12 kHz impulses from the commutation centre into impulses of a different frequency, namely 3 kHz. These impulses, since they are within the vocal base band, are transparent to the switchboard, and are therefore transmitted to the different terminals (45) connected to the extension lines.<br>
The 12 kHz computation impulses from the commutation centre are transparent to the translator (40) and therefore reach the switchboard.<br>
When the 3 kHz computation impulses are received the terminal, if it is programmed to emit an echo signal, proceeds according to a pre-set algorithm to resend these to the impulse translator (40) by tones of a preset frequency,<br><br>
12<br>
namely 256 Hz, confirming the reception of the computation impulses. In the event the translator (40) does not receive the reply in the allotted time period and with the proper cadence, it shall proceed to open the analog line, causing the end of communication. In this way, the system is protected from a possible fraudulent use which may occur when different terminals are connected to the extension lines of the switchboard.<br>
Clearly, the impulse translator (40) may be configured to operate without analysing the echo signal forwarded. Naturally, the impulse translator may be connected to any commutation and switchboard centre, and is also capable of detecting a situation of open or busy line.<br>
Figure 10 shows the operation of the impulse translator (40) in independent mode, in which case it appears directly intercalated in the central analog line, detecting the 12 kHz computation impulses from the commutation centre, to which it is completely transparent.<br>
When terminal (45) receives computation impulses from the centre (42) it proceeds to forward towards the translator, according to a preset algorithm, impulses as 256 Hz tones or as line openings (depending on the programming) to confirm the reception of the computation impulses. If the impulse translator (40) does not receive the tone or opening in the allotted time and with the proper cadence it proceeds to open the analog line, causing an end to communication. In this way the system is protected from a possible fraudulent use if terminals other than the residential telephones are connected.<br>
The system object of the present invention has been described above in an example of a preferred embodiment. As experts in the field will see, within the essential elements may be introduced a number of detail variations, which may affect the whole or the parts, without this meaning any deviation from the scope of the invention, limited only by the claims following.<br><br>
