DESCRIPTION <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel benz-imidazole derivatives and salts thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Proliferation of the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel induces hypertrophy of the intima of the blood vessel and, from a long-term view point, it causes, arteriosclelerotic diseases such as mvocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and the like. Moreover, from a short-term view point, it induces reobstruction of the blood vessel after treatments of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent and/or aterectomy.  In consideration of the present situation, the therapeutic effects of conventional medicines used therefor are thought of as within certain limits, because they are classified as agents of indirectly effective for curing the diseases induced by the promotion factors of hypertrophy of the interim, for example hyperlipidemia, hypertension and the like. Therefore, development of essentially effective medicines therefor have been eagerly expected.<br>
Generally, it is known that proliferation of<br><br>
- 2-<br>
the smooth muscle cells is related to the influence of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP).  In this connection, pharmaceutical preparations of nitro group-containing compound known as coronary vasodilators activate the enzymatic activity of guanylate cyclase, and accentuate the production of cGMP, and also inhibit the proliferation of the cells.  However, the pharmaceutical preparations of nitro group-containing compound are scarecely used for treatment of arterio-sclerotic diseases which need to be administered for a long period of time, because the effect of the pharmaceutical preparations of nitro group-containing compound can be sustained only for a quite short time, and when they are administered repeatedly, then the tolerance against said pharmaceutical preparations may be occurred.  On the other hand, in recent years, there have been reported several pharmaceutical preparations which can increase the concentration of cGMP by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the enzyme [i.e., cGMP-PDE (cGMP-phosphodiesterase)] for decomposition of cGMP.  However, there have not been suggested the activity for inhibiting proliferation of the smooth muscle cells performed by pharmaceutical preparations. The guanine derivative which was reported recently in an academic conference (IBC's International Conference on RESTENOSIS, 1994, U. S. A.) is the only known compound having both effects for inhibiting the enzymatic activity of cGMP-PDE and for inhibiting proliferation<br><br>
- 3 -of the smooth muscle cells.<br>
In consideration of the present status of such pharmacotherapy, and referring to the fact that cGMP relates to proliferation of the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel, the present inventors have made an extensive research work regarding pharmaceutical preparations having the activity for inhibiting proliferation of the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel which acts directly to the cells thereof, and can be used as the essential agent for treating arteriosclerotic diseases.<br>
As the results, the present inventors have found the fact that the objective compounds, having the activity for inhibiting proliferation of the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel, are existed among benzimidazole derivatives having property for inhibiting the enzymatic activity of cGMP PDE, thus the present invention has been completed.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benzimidazoie derivatives of the present invention are novel compounds which have not been reported in any literature, and are represented by the general formula (1) as follows:<br><br>
[wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom;<br>
R2 is a phenyl-lower alkyl group;<br>
R3 is a heterocyclic group selected from the group consisting of an indolyl group, indolinyl group, 1H-indazolyl group, 2(lH)-quinolinonyl group, 3,4-dihydro-2{lH)-quinolinonyl group and 3,4-dihydro-l,4(2H)-benzoxazinyl group, said heterocyclic group may<br><br>

have 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of: a group of the formula -B-R4, (B is a lower alkylene group; R4 is a 5- to 11-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group of single ring or binary ring, having 1 to 4 hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of a nitrogen atom, oxygen atom and sulfur atom, (said heterocyclic group may have 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group and oxo group) or a group of the formula -NR5R5 (R5 and R6 are each the same or different, and a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a pyridylcarbonyl group, an isoxazolylcarbonyl group which may have 1 to 3 lower alkyl groups as the substituents, a pyrrolylcarbonyl group or an amino-substituted lower alkyl group which may have a lower alkyl group as the substituent; further R5 and R6 may form 5- to 6-membered saturated heterocyclic group by combining to each other, together with the adjacent nitrogen atom being bonded thereto, further with or without other nitrogen atom or oxygen atom; said heterocyclic group may have 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of a hydroxy group and a phenyl group));<br>
a lower alkenyl group; a lower alkoxycarbonyl group; a phenoxy-lower alkyl group which may have cyano group as the substituents; a halogen-substituted lower alkyl group; and a lower alkoxycarbonyl-substituted lower<br><br>
- 6 -alkyl group;<br>
A is a lower alkylene group; and<br>
n is 0 or 1.].<br>
The benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention possess weak activity for inhibiting the enzymatic action of cAMP PDE, while they possess strong activity for inhibiting the enzymatic action selectively against cGMP PDE.<br>
The benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention possess activity for inhibiting proliferation of the smooth muscle cells, especially they possess strong activity for inhibiting proliferation of the mesenchymal cells.  The activity for inhibiting proliferation of the smooth muscle cells was determination by measuring the activity for inhibiting proliferation of rat A10 cell (in vitro), and confirmed.  The rat A10 cell is a cell strain derived from smooth muscle of rat embryo thoracic aorta, and the biological property thereof is described in Exptl. Cell Ress. Vol. 98, (1976), pages 349-36.5, (B. W. Kimes and B. L. Brandt).  The activity for inhibiting proliferation of the fibroblasts and mesangial cells were determined by measuring the activity for inhibiting proliferation of human fibroblasts or rat mesangial cells in place of rat A10 cell, by the procedure similar to that of described in the same literature, and confirmed strong activities for inhibition.  The activity for inhibiting proliferating of T-cells was determined by procedure of<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
the experiment as described in "Current Protocol in Immunology" Chapter 3, page 12 [compiled by Coligan, et al., (1991), (published by Willy Interscience)], and confirmed.  As mentioned above, the benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention also possess immunosuppressive activity based on the activity for inhibiting proliferation of T-cells.<br>
The benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention possess activity for inhibiting synthesis and secretion of collagen.  Thus, the activity was confirmed by culturing human fibroblast and by method as described in Clin. Invest.,Vol. 83, (1989), pages 1160-1167 (K. Mackay, et al.) and by applying assay method as described in Calcif. Tissue Int., Vol. 35, (1983), pages 542-548 (M. Kumegawa, et al.).<br>
Furthermore, the benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention also possess antiinflammatory activity.  In case of using as a drug for external use, the antiinflammatory activity of banzimidazole derivative was confirmed by the procedures of experiment as described in Agents Actions, Vol. 26, (19891- page 319 (Carlson, et al.) [Test animals and administration method were partly revised].  Said inflammatory activity of benzimidazole derivative of the present invention was confirmed in detail as described in (6) Determination of the activity for inhibiting TPA-induced inflammation as described later in this specification.<br><br>

Proliferation of the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel is the major cause of arteriosclerosis.  [Nature Vol. 362, (1993), pages 801-809 (Russell Ross)].  Moreover, proliferation of fibroblast and synthesis and secretion of collagen are also the causes of arteriosclerosis. [Am. J. Pathol., Vol. 125, (1986), pages 191-207 (A. M. Gown, et al.)].  In the case of diabetes mellitus, the smooth muscle cells show tendency of abnormal proliferation. [Eu. J. Clin. Invest. Vol. 23, (1993), pages 84-90 (M. Kawano, et al.)].  Proliferation of fibroblast as well as synthesis and secretion of collagen induce pulmonary fibrosis.  [Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., Vol 138, (1988), pages 703-708(G. Raghu, et al.); and CHIRYOU-GAKU (Therapeutics), Vol. 28, (19941, pages 62-66, (Toshihiko Sakai, et al.).  Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of cGMP PDE inhibits aggregation of platelets, as well as effective for prevention and treatment of allergy, asthma, psoriasis and formation of thrombus. [Trends Pharmacol. Sci., Vol. 12, (1991), pages 19-27 (C. D. Nicholson, et al.)].  Increase of the amount of cGMP lowers blood pressure. [Circ. Res., Vol. 74, (1994), pages 416-421 (A. Koller, et al.) and DOHMYAKU KOUKA NO BUNSHI IGAKU (Molecular Medicine of Arteriosclerosis) (compiled by Tohru Kita, 1994, published by YOHDO-SHA, pages 27-28 and 147-164)].<br>
As explained above, according to the pharmacological activities performed by the benzimidazole<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
derivatives of the present invention, they can be applied to prevention and treatment of various diseases for example, diseases related to cGMP, diseases induced by proliferation of the smooth muscle cells and fibroblast, diseases related to synthesis and secretion of collagen, and they can be further applied to prevention and treatment of skin diseases relating to immune and inflammation.  As to these diseases, there can be exemplified, reobstruction of the blood vessel occurred after the treatments of PTCA, anginoplasy and operation of bypass, arteriosclerotic diseases [e.g., angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, cerebrovascular dementia, transient ischemic attack (TIA), disfunction of peripheral circulation, complication of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, fibrous hypertrophy of artery and the like], cell proliferative diseases other than arteriosclerotic diseases (e.g., renal disease, asthma, bronchitis, proliferative dermatitis, keloidosis, hyperplastic scar, glaucoma and the like), pulmonary fibrosis, collagen disease, psoriasis, allergic diseases (especially, atopic dermatitis and chronic contactive dermatitis), other dermatitises, hypertension, organopathy induced by hypertension, cardiac failure, hypercardia and the<br>
like.<br>
The benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention can be administered orally and non-orally by<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
making them as in the form of suitable pharmaceutical preparations, and in case of apply to dermatic diseases, a pharmaceutical preparation made for external use can be applied by coating directly onto the diseased part.  The effectiveness of the benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention applied in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for external use was confirmed by conducting experiments as described in J. Denntol. Sci., Vol. 8, (1994), paqe 54 (Kitagaki, et al.) and Agents Actions, Vol. 26, (1989), page 319 (Carlson, et al.,). [Animal test and method of administration were partly revided.] Detailed explanation relating to activity for inhibiting TPA-induced edema will be disclosed in Pharmacological Test (6), as mentioned later in this specification.  Models in Dermatology, Vol. 1, pages 50-58 [(complied by H. I. Maibach, N. J. Lowe) (published by Krager, Basel) 1985] describes tnat the experiment as described in the latter literature (Agents Actions by Carlson, et al.) is a model of psoriasis.<br>
As can be seen from the result of experiment conducted by using rat carotid paratripsis model [Am. J. pathol., Vol. 141, (1992), pages 685-690 (U. Zeymer, et al.) the benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention are effective not onlf in vitro test but also. In vivo test.<br>
In case of oral administration, the benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention can be<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
attained to keep blood concentration sufficient to manifestation of pharmacological effect, and the number of oral administration per day can be set as small number, because the duration of blood concentration and action time thereof can be kept for quite long time.<br>
The benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention are characterized by having quite weak activity of acute vasodepression effect, systolic potentiation effect and cardiac rate increasing effect at the dosage of showing inhibitory effect of cGMP PDE, and at the dosage of showing inhibitory effect of proliferation of the smooth muscle cells.<br>

(5) Determination of the activity for inhibiting chronic contactive dermatitis<br>
The activity for inhibiting chronic contactive dermatitis [J. Dermatol. Sci . , Vol. 8,<br>
(1994), page 54] which is analogous to atopic dermatitis being reported by Kitagaki, et al. was discussed by using the method as follows.  The right-side ear pinna of Balb/c strain male mouse was subjected to antigen sensitization by coating  with 20  l of acetone solution of 1% trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB).  7 Days after the antigen sensitization, the same right-side pinna was subjected to antigen induction by coating with 20  l of 1% TNCB acetone solution.  The treatment of antigen induction was . repeated in every 2 days so as to induced chronic contactive dermatitis.  In this test, increase of thickness of the right-side ear pinna was induced by passing into a chronic state of the contactive dermatitis.  The test compound was dissolved in acetone-methanol (4:1 by v/v) and 20  l of this solution was administered by coating on the right-side of ear pinna once a day from 24th day after the antigen induction for 2 weeks.  As to the control, the only the solvent was similarly administered.  The antigen induction by the test compound during administration period was conducted at 30 minutes before the administration.  The thickness of the ear pinna of 14th day after the administration was measured by a dial<br><br>
- 141 -thickness gauge.<br>
The results are shown in Table 36 as follows<br>

(6) Determination of the activity for inhibiting TPA induced inflammation<br>
Test was conducted by the modified method of Carlson, et al. [Agents Actions, Vol. 26, (1989), page 319].  Thus, to the ear pinna of ICR strain female mouse, 20  l of acetone solution of 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the concentration of 200  g/ml was coated to induce inflammation.  The thickness of ear pinna of 4 hours after the TPA coating was measured, and difference of the last value was defined as the ear pinna inflammation.  Test compound was dissolved in acetone-methanol (4:1 by v/v) to make the<br><br>
- 142 -<br>
concentration of 1%.  20  l of test compound solution was coated on the ear pinna 30 minutes before the TPA coating.  By using compound of Example 3 as test compound, the inflammation was inhibited at the rate of 66%.<br>
(?) Determination of the activity for inhibiting proliferation of rat mesangial cells<br>
In accordance with the method of F. Jaffer, et al. [Am. J. pathol.,Vol 135,(1989),pages<br>
261-269], the mesangial cells were collected.  Under anesthetized condition, the kidney of a rat was aseptically enucleated and the medulla renis was cut out, then the cortex renis was pressed to a sieve (120 mesh) made of stainless steel.  The fraction of cortex renis passed through the sieve was put on another sieve of 200 mesh and washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), the fraction being remained on the sieve was confirmed as the glomerulus.  This fraction was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium [containing 15% of fetal calf serum (FCS), and 5  g/ml of insulin] for 4 weeks. This fraction was further subcultured twice, and the remaining cells were thought of as the mesangial cells for use of this experiment.<br>
Determination of the activity for inhibiting proliferation of rat mesangial cells was conducted in accordance with the method of M. B. Ganz, et al. [Am. J. Physiol., Vol. 259, (1990), pages F269-F278].<br><br>
- 143 -<br>
Thus 2 x l04/ml of mesangial cells were inoculated on a culture plate (48 wells, each well having the capacity of 0.5 ml), and cultured with RPMI medium (containing 15% FCS) for 3 days.  The RPMI medium was then changed to another RPMI medium wherein the concentration of FCS was decreased to 0.5%, and further cultured for 3 days.  Next, the RPMI medium was changed to another RPMI medium containing the same concentration of FCS, and added the test compound being dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was lower than 0.1%) and 5 ng/ml (the final concentration) of platelet-derivered growth factor BB (PDGF-BB).  After 24 hours, 1  Ci/well of [ 3H]-thymidine was added, and incubated for additional 24 hours.  The supernatant of the culture medium was taken up, and the amount of [3H]-thymidine up-taken into the cells was measured by use of scintillation counter.  IC50 value measured by using compound of Example 3 for the test was 0.79 uM.<br><br>
