METHOD FOR CONTROLLING PRESSURE FLUID OPERATED PERCUSSION DEVICE, AND PERCUSSION DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for controlling a pressure fluid operated percussion device which allows a tool movable in its longitudinal direction with respect to a body of the percussion device to be installed therein, and which comprises a working chamber and therein a transmission piston installed movably in the axial direction of the tool in order to suddenly compress the tool in its longitudinal direction by a pressure of pressure fluid influencing the transmission piston such that a stress pulse is generated in the tool in its longitudinal direction and the stress pulse progresses through the tool into a material to be broken, a control valve which includes inlet and discharge channels for conveying pressure fluid to and from the percussion device and which also includes a movably installed switch element provided with channels for switching, via the channels of the switch element, the inlet channels and, similarly, the discharge channels to alternately feed pressure fluid into the working chamber to influence the transmission piston and, similarly, to discharge pressure fluid that influenced the transmission piston from the working chamber.<br>
[0002] The invention further relates to a percussion device which allows a tool to be installed therein movably in its longitudinal direction with respect to a body of the percussion device, and which comprises a working chamber and therein a transmission piston installed movably in the axial direction of the tool in order to suddenly compress the tool in its longitudinal direction by a pressure of pressure fluid influencing the transmission piston such that a stress pulse is generated in the tool in its longitudinal direction and the stress pulse progresses through the tool into a material to be broken, a control valve which includes inlet and discharge channels for conveying pressure fluid to and from the percussion device and which also includes a movably installed switch element provided with channels for switching, by means of the switch element and via the channels thereof, the channels to alternately convey pressure fluid into the working chamber to influence the transmission piston and, similarly, to discharge pressure fluid that influenced the transmission piston from the working chamber.<br><br>
[0003] In the claimed percussion device, a stress pulse is generated such that a transmission piston residing in a separate working chamber is arranged to be influenced by the pressure of pressure fluid, most preferably relatively suddenly. The influence of the pressure pushes the transmission piston towards a tool. Consequently, the tool becomes compressed, whereby a stress pulse is generated in the tool and the stress pulse progresses therethrough, and when the tip of the tool is in contact with rock or another hard material to be broken, makes the material break down. In order to control its striking op-eration, the percussion device may utilize a rotatable or reciprocally linearly movable switch element which typically comprises successive openings to alternately open a connection from a pressure fluid source to the transmission piston of the percussion device and, similarly, from the transmission piston to a pressure fluid reservoir. When drilling conditions change, or for some other reasons, it is sometimes desirable to change the frequency at which stress pulses are generated, which is easy to carry out by adjusting the speed of movement of the switch element. However, a problem arises in that when the speed of movement of the switch element increases, the times during which pressure fluid channels are open become shorter. This contributes to changing the operation and behaviour of the device, which is not desirable.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] An object of the present invention is to provide a method and a percussion device so as to enable the generation times of a stress pulse to be adjusted as desired and, for example, the shortenings of the times during which pressure fluid channels are open due to an increase in the speed of movement to be compensated for.<br>
[0005] The method of the invention is characterized in that in order to adjust the length of the stress pulse, the time during which the pressure of the pressure fluid influencing the transmission piston and, therethrough, pressing the tool, influences the tool is adjusted. The percussion device of the invention is characterized in that it comprises an adjustment element provided with channels for pressure fluid, that the switch element is arranged to convey pressure fluid to and from the working channel via the channels of the adjustment element, and that it comprises adjustment means for adjusting, by means of the adjustment element, the influence time of the pressure of the pressure<br><br>
fluid being fed to the percussion device via the control valve and influencing the transmission piston and, therethrough, compressing the tool.<br>
[0006] An idea underlying the invention is that the influence time of the pressure of the pressure fluid is adjusted by adjusting either the time during which the pressure fluid inlet channel/s is/are open and/or the speed of movement of the switch element of the control valve. The idea underlying an embodiment of the invention is that different sides of the switch element of the control valve, in the pressure fluid inlet and discharge channels, are provided with at least partly aligned openings, and at least one side of the switch element is provided with an adjustment element movable in the direction of movement of the switch element such that by moving the adjustment element, the mutual position of the openings may be adjusted so that the length of parts of the aligned openings in the direction of movement changes. In accordance with a second embodiment of the invention, the adjustment is carried out with respect to the speed of movement of the switch element such that the length of the parts of the aligned openings in the direction of movement of the switch element is proportional to the speed of movement. This adjusts the time during which the pressure fluid channels are open proportionally to the speed of movement such that the time during which the channels are open, and thus the generation time of a stress pulse, is substantially always the same, irrespective of the speed of movement. In accordance with a third embodiment of the invention, the adjustment element is installed outside the switch element of the control valve. In accordance with a fourth embodiment of the invention, the adjustment element is installed as an integral part of the switch element.<br>
[0007] An advantage of the invention is that the length of the stress pulses can be adjusted according to given drilling conditions. A further advantage is that when adjusting the frequency of the stress pulses, it is possible at the same time to adjust the length of stress pulses and thus, irrespective of a change in the frequency, to generate stress pulses of a desired length.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] The invention will be described in closer detail in the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
[0009] Figures 1a and 1b schematically show embodiments of a percussion device of the invention,<br><br>
[0010] Figures 2a and 2b schematically show an embodiment of the invention,<br>
[0011] Figures 3a and 3b schematically show another embodiment of the invention, and<br>
[0012] Figure 4 schematically shows a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Figure 1a is a schematic sectional view showing a percussion device 1 according to the invention, comprising a body 2 provided with a working chamber 3 therewithin, and in the working chamber 3 a transmission piston 4. The transmission piston 4 is located co-axially with a tool 5, and it may move in the axial direction thereof such that the transmission piston 4, during generation of a stress pulse, comes into contact with the tool 5 or with a shank known per se attached thereto. A side of the transmission piston 4 opposite to the tool is provided with a pressure surface facing the working chamber 3. In order to generate a stress pulse, pressurized pressure fluid is fed from a pressure source, such as a pump 6, to the working chamber 3 along an inlet channel 7 via a control valve 8. The control valve comprises a movable switch element (shown in more detail in Figures 2a to 3b) provided with channels, such as openings or grooves, which alternately connect a first inlet channel leading to the switch element and a second inlet channel leading from the switch element to the working chamber and, similarly, a second discharge channel provided from the working chamber to the switch element and a first discharge channel leading away from the switch element. A stress pulse is generated when the pressure of the pressure fluid pushes the transmission piston 4 towards the tool 5 and, therethrough, compresses the tool 5 against the material to be broken. After having travelled through the tool 5, the stress pulse, upon being transferred via the tip of the tool, such as a drill bit, in a manner known per se to the material to be broken, such as rock, thus causes the material to break down. When the switch element of the control valve 8 stops the pressure fluid from entering the working chamber and subsequently discharges the pressure fluid that influenced the transmission piston 4 from the working chamber 3 along a discharge channel 9 to a pressure fluid reservoir 10, the stress pulse dies away and the transmission piston 4, which has moved a short distance, only some millimetres in the direction of the tool 5, is allowed<br><br>
to return to its original position before the switch element of the control valve 8 again lets pressure fluid to enter the working chamber 3, which causes a new stress pulse to be generated. During the use of the percussion device, it is pushed in a manner known per se at a feed force F towards the tool 5 and simultaneously towards the material to be broken. In order to return the transmission piston 4, pressure medium may be fed to a chamber 3' between stress pulses, if necessary, or the transmission piston may be returned by mechanical devices, such as a spring.<br>
[0014] In the case shown in Figure 1a, the control valve 8 comprises a rotatably co-axially with the tool 5 movable switch element which is rotated around its axis in the direction of arrow A by a suitable rotating mechanism, such as a motor 11, by means of power transmission schematically depicted in a broken line. Alternatively, the switch element is rotatably turned back and forth by a suitable mechanism. Such a rotatably movable switch element may also be located othen/vise, e.g. in the body 2, installed onto a side of the working chamber 3. Instead of a rotatably movable switch element, the control valve 8 may also utilize a reciprocally movable switch element. Furthermore, in both cases it is possible to use a control valve whose switch element only comprises one channel for conveying pressure fluid to and from the working chamber. Preferably, however, the switch element of the control valve 8 comprises a plurality of parallel channels. Figure la further shows a control unit 12, which may be connected to control the rotation speed of the control valve or the speed of movement of the reciprocally movable control valve and which comprises adjustment means for adjusting, in manners similar to those shown in Figures 2a to 3b, the influence time of the pressure of the pressure fluid by adjusting the time during which the openings of the pressure fluid channels are open e.g. in proportion to the speed of movement of the switch element. This is schematically shown in broken lines 13a and 13b. Such an adjustment can be implemented by many different techniques known per se by using desired parameters, such as drilling conditions, e.g. the hardness of a rock to be broken.<br>
[0015] Figure lb is a schematic sectional view showing a second percussion device 1 according to the invention, comprising a body 2 provided with a working chamber 3 therewithin, and in the working chamber 3 a transmission piston 4. In this embodiment, the transmission piston 4 is influenced by a continuous pressure of pressure fluid via a channel 9a. With respect to the<br><br>
transmission piston 4, the channel 9a is connected with an auxiliary chamber 3a residing on a side opposite to a tool 5. Similarly, for the operation of the percussion device and with respect to the transmission piston 4, the working chamber 3 resides on a side of the tool 5. Hence, in order to generate a stress pulse, pressure fluid is discharged from the working chamber 3 for a period of time of a desired length, so that the pressure of the pressure fluid in the auxiliary chamber pushes the transmission piston towards the tool. At the same time, the tool becomes compressed, and a stress pulse is generated. Similarly, the transmission piston 4 is returned to its original position by feeding pressure fluid into the working chamber 3, in which case the transmission piston stops pressing the tool and the stress pulse dies away. In the case of Figure 1b, the adjustment takes place in the same way as in Figure 1a but in the figure it is the discharge of the pressure fluid from the working chamber 3 that is adjusted. The figure schematically depicts the valve 8 as a conventional reciprocally movable switch element, but the details in accordance with the invention will be shown below in Figures 2a and 2b. The motor 11 may be any device capable of producing a reciprocal movement which operates either mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically.<br>
[0016] Figures 2a and 2b schematically show an embodiment of the invention. The figures only show a part of e.g. a control valve 8 equipped with a reciprocally movable switch element 8a and a body 2 of a percussion device. One side of the control valve 8 is provided with pressure fluid inlet channels 7 and discharge channels 9 which terminate at the switch element 8a and whose openings 7a and 9a facing the switch element 8a are included in the control valve 8. In this example, these channels are fixedly formed in the body 2 of the percussion device, so that their position with respect to the body 2 is always constant. On the other side of the switch element 8a with respect to the body 2 of the percussion device, the control valve 8 comprises an adjustment element 14 which is parallelly with the direction of movement B of the switch element 8a reciprocally movable, as shown by arrow C, and which similarly comprises channels T and 9' connected with the working chamber 3 of the percussion device 1. Similarly, their openings 7'a and 9'a included in the control valve are directed towards the switch element 8a. The switch element 8a of the control valve 8 is further provided with channels 15 therein having the form of a groove therein formed in a surface thereof or an opening provided therethrough, such that openings 15a and 15b of these channels alternately connect the channels<br><br>
7 and T and, similarly, the channels 9 and 9' such that pressure fluid flows to and from the working chamber 3.<br>
[0017] In the situation shown in Figure 2a, the position of the adjustment element 14 is such that the openings 7'a and 9'a of the channels T and 9' of the adjustment element 14 are arranged to overlap with respect to the openings 7a and 9a of the inlet and discharge channels 7 and 9 provided in the body 2 in the direction of movement of the switch element 8a by a distance s. In such a case, when the switch element 8a moves, only a portion of the cross-sectional areas of the openings 7a and 7'a and, similarly, 9a and 9'a of the channels 7 and 7' and the channels 9 and 9', respectively, are simultaneously connected with one another via the openings 15a and 15b of the channels 15 of the switch element 8a. This is because when the openings 7a and 15a of the channels 7 and 15 open into one another, the opening 7'a of the channel T opens into connection with the opening 15b of the channel 15 only later, after the switch element 8a has moved by yet another distance s in the same direction. Similarly, the opening 7a of the channel 7 closes up away from connection with the channel 15 already at a distance s before the opening of the channel T closes up away from connection with the channel 15. The openings 9a and 9'a of the channels 9 and 9' connect in a similar manner. At a certain speed of movement of the switch element 8a of the control valve 8, it is thus possible to achieve an influence time t of a given length for a stress pulse of the pressure fluid influencing the transmission piston 4, which is necessary in order to generate stress pulses of given lengths.<br>
[0018] In the situation according to Figure 2b, the adjustment element 14 has been moved to a position wherein the openings of the channels T and 9' of the adjustment element 14 are arranged in complete alignment with respect to the inlet and discharge channels 7 and 9 provided in the body 2, i.e. the distance s = 0. In such a case, when the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 moves, the openings 7a and 7'a of the channels 7 and T open into connection with the openings 15a and 15b of the channel 15 simultaneously and, similarly, close up away from connection with the channel 15 simultaneously. Consequently, the entire cross-sectional area of the openings 7a and 7'a as well as 9a and 9'a of the channels 7 and 7' and the channels 9 and 9', respectively, simultaneously becomes interconnected via the channels 15 of the switch element 8a and, similarly, it takes the pressure fluid longer to flow.<br><br>
In this situation, the time during which the pressure fluid influences the tool via the transmission piston 4 is at its longest.<br>
[0019] By arranging the adjustment element 14 in different positions, it is possible to produce pressure fluid influence times of different lengths at a certain speed of movement of the switch element 8a. It is thus possible to adjust the time during which the pressure fluid influences the tool 5 via the transmission piston 4 by adjusting the position of the adjustment element 14 and, therethrough, the mutual position of the openings of the pressure fluid inlet and discharge channels with respect to one another.<br>
[0020] When the movement of the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 is sped up, a result is an increase in the frequency of stress pulses. Consequently, however, the pressure fluid innfluence time in the position shown in Figure 2a would also become shorter, i.e. the generation time of stress pulses would become shorter, which is sometimes harmful as far as the operation of the percussion device is concerned. Thus, when the speed of movement increases, the adjustment element 14 may be similarly moved such that the openings 7'a and 9'a of its channels T and 9' become more aligned with the openings 7a and 9a of the inlet and discharge channels 7 and 9 provided in the body 2. In theory, when the speed of movement of the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 becomes multiplied by two, the length of the aligned openings in the direction of movement of the switch element 8a also has to be multiplied by two so as to enable a generation time of stress pulses of the same length to be achieved by the higher speed of movement and the consequent higher frequency of stress pulses.<br>
[0021] Figures 3a and 3b schematically show another embodiment of the invention. The figures further show only a part of a switch element 8a which moves, i.e. rotates, in the same direction, e.g. as indicated by arrow B', as well as of a body 2 of a percussion device. A control valve 8, on one side of the switch element 8a, is provided with pressure fluid inlet and discharge channels 7 and 9 whose openings 7a and 9a are situated towards the switch element 8a. The other side of the switch element 8a in the body 2 of the percussion device is provided with other pressure fluid channels T and 9', respectively, connected with a working chamber 3. Similarly, openings 7'a and 9'a of these channels are situated towards the switch element 8a. The inlet and discharge channels 7 and 9 and, similarly, the channels 7' and 9' reside immovably with respect to one another.<br><br>
[0022] The switch element 8a of the control valve 8 is therein provided with channels 15 which have the shape of a groove formed in a surface of the switch element 8a or an opening provided therethrough. The switch element 8a further comprises an adjustment element 14' which moves along with the switch element and which is movable with respect the switch element as indicated by arrow C' such that the adjustment element is similarly provided with channels 15' which have the shape of a groove formed in a surface thereof or an opening provided therethrough and which are connected with the channels 15. The channels 15 and 15' alternately connect the channels 7 and T and, similarly, the channels 9 and 9' such that pressure fluid flows to and from the working chamber 3.<br>
[0023] In the situation shown in Figure 3a, the position of the adjustment element 14' with respect to the switch element 8a is such that the openings 15a and 15'b of the channels 15 and 15' situated towards the channels 7 and T and, similarly, the channels 9 and 9' partly overlap by a distance s in the disrection of movement of the switch element 8a. In such a case, it is possible at a given speed of movement of the switch element 8a to achieve an influence time t of a given length for a stress pulse of the pressure fluid influencing the transmission piston 4.<br>
[0024] In the situation of Figure 3b, the adjustment element 14', with respect to the switch element 8a, has been moved into a position wherein the openings 15a and 15'b of the channels 15 and 15' are arranged to reside in complete alignment with respect to one another in the direction of movement of the switch element 8a, the distance s being 0. In such a case, when the switch element 8a moves, the entire cross-sectional area of the openings 7a and 7'a of the channels 7 and 7' as well as the openings 9a and 9'a of the channels 9 and 9\ respectively, simultaneously becomes interconnected via the openings 15a and 15'b of the channels 15 and 15'. In this situation, similarly to that shown in Figure 2b, it takes the pressure fluid longer to flow, and the time during which the pressure fluid influences the tool via the transmission piston 4 is at its longest.<br>
[0025] In order to prevent the movement of the adjustment element 14' with respect to the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 from causing throttling in the flow of pressure fluid, the openings 15b and 15'a of the channels 15 and 15' of the adjustment element 14' and the switch element 8a, facing one another, are elongated in the direction of movement of the switch ele-<br><br>
ment and the adjustment element 14' included therein such that across the entire adjustment range and even at their smallest, the portions of the openings thereof that are simultaneously in alignment are at least as large as the openings 15a and 15'b of the channels 15 and 15' on the side of the openings 7a and 7'a as well as 9a and 9'a of the channels 7 and T and the channels 9 and 9', respectively.<br>
[0026] Figure 4 is a schematic view showing an embodiment of a control valve implemented with a rotatable switch element and applying a method according to the invention in a section taken along line D - D in Figure 1. For the sake of clarity, the figure shows no means for rotating and adjusting a switch element for adjusting an opening. Figure 4 shows a cross-section of a body of a percussion device in a section at a rotatable switch element of the control valve 8. It shows how pressure fluid inlet channels are formed in the body 2 of the percussion device such that the periphery of the rotatable switch element 8a is provided with a plurality of parallelly operating pressure fluid inlet channels 7 and, similarly, a plurality of parallel pressure fluid discharge channels 9, whose openings are situated towards the switch element 8a. Obviously, these channels eventually come together to form a single inlet channel 7 from a pressure fluid pump 6 and, similarly, a single discharge channel 9 to a pressure fluid reservoir, pressure fluid tubes being connected thereto in a manner known per se for conveying pressure fluid to and from the percussion device. In this example, these pressure fluid inlet and discharge channels 7 and 9 are provided in the body 2 of the percussion device in manners known per se. The control valve 8, inside the switch element 8a with respect to the body 2 of the percussion device 1, is provided with an adjustment element 14, installed ro-tatably co-axially with the switch element 8a. The adjustment element 14 can be rotated by a mechanism known per se. Hence, the rotating mechanism may be pressure fluid operated, mechanically operated, etc. It may also be provided with adjustment devices connected thereto which are dependent on the rotation speed of the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 and which are implemented by various mechanisms. Similarly, the adjustment of the adjustment element 14 electrically is applicable in manners known per se.<br>
[0027] Most preferably, the position of the adjustment element 14 is connected to be automatically dependent on the speed of the switch element 8a of the control valve 8. In such a case, a rotation speed range is determined for the switch element 8a, which includes the minimum and maximum values<br><br>
for rotation speed such that the rotation speed of the switch element 8a is to reside between these values. When the rotation speed is at its lowest, the adjustment element 14 is in the position shown in Figure 2a, wherein the position with respect to one another of the inlet openings 7 and 7' and, similarly, the discharge openings 9, 9\ which are situated on an opposite side of the switch element 8a, is such that the length of the openings in alignment in the direction of movement, i.e. rotation, of the switch element 8a, and thus the largest simultaneous cross-section in alignment, is as small as possible. Since most preferably the openings in the axial direction of switch element 8a are of a substantially constant width, the particular surface area ratio of openings in alignment is also directly proportional to the length in alignment of the openings in the direction of rotation of the switch element 8a. When the rotation speed of the switch element 8a is increased, the adjustment element 14 rotates with respect to the body 2 such that the length in alignment of the openings, and thus the overall surface area as well, increases. If the position of the adjustment element 14 is connected to automatically follow the rotation speed of the switch element 8a, the position thereof is adjusted by a separate control unit 12. The influence of the rotation speed of the switch element 8a on the control element 12 and the influence of the control unit 12 on the adjustment element 14 are schematically shown in broken lines 13a and 13b, respectively.<br>
[0028] The invention has been disclosed in the description and in the drawings only by way of example, and it is by no means restricted thereto. Different details of embodiments may be implemented in different ways and they may be combined with one another. The embodiments shown in Figures 2a to 2b and, similarly, in Figures 3a to 3b can be applied both to control valves equipped with reciprocally linearly or rotatably movable switch elements 8a, and to various control valves equipped with rotatable switch elements 8a. Various suitable sealing elements may be provided between the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 and the body 2 and, similarly, the adjustment element 14 for reducing or eliminating leaks between the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 and the body 2 and, similarly, the adjustment element 14. The adjustment element may be provided on either side of the control valve. The rotation or reciprocal movement of the switch element 8a of the control valve 8 may be implemented in any manner known per se, either mechanically, electrically, pneumatically or hydraulically. Similarly, the adjustment of the position of the adjustment element 14 may be implemented in any manner known<br><br>
per se, either mechanically, electrically, pneumatically or hydraulically. Although the control valve equipped with a rotatable switch element 8a is shown by way of example in a form wherein it is provided with a cylindrical valve part, it may also similarly be implemented in the form of a disc, cone or the like. Furthermore, instead of openings provided through the switch element 8a of the control valve, groove-like channels provided in the switch element 8a may also be used. The pressure fluid inlet and discharge channels do not necessarily have to be situated on opposite sides of the switch element, either, as long as they are located at different points. The influence of the pressure of the pressure fluid has to be adjusted only as far as the generation of a stress pulse is to be adjusted. Hence, in the case of Figure 1a, it will suffice to adjust the time during which the inlet channels for pressure fluid are open, and in the case of Figure 1b it will suffice to adjust the time during which the discharge channels for pressure fluid are open. As to the other channels, it will suffice that the times during which they are open are sufficiently long. In addition to the shown order, the switch element and the adjustment element may also reside with respect to one another such that the adjustment element is situated on a side of the pressure fluid inlet and discharge channels while the switch element is situated on a side of the working chamber. Further, the channels of the adjustment element and the switch element may be directly connected to the wortking chamber, or other inlet and discharge channels may be provided therebetween. These other inlet and discharge channels may also be the same ones, i.e. the same channels serve both as inlet and discharge channels with respect to the working chamber, as long as their openings in the control valve are arranged as required by the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
