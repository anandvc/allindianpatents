This non-provisional application claims priority from provisional application 60/903,471 filed February 26, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a process for preparing certain substituted sulfilimines.<br>
The substituted sulfilimines are useful intermediates for the preparation of certain new insecticidal sulfoximines; see, for example, U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0228027 in which cyano-substituted sulfilimines are prepared by the reaction of the corresponding sulfide with cyanamide in the presence of iodobenzene diacetate. It would be advantageous to produce the sulfilimines efficiently and in high yield from the corresponding sulfides without having to use iodobenzene diacetate, which, in addition to its expense, presents waste disposal problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, iodobenzene diacetate is replaced by hypochlorite. In addition to being low cost, hypochlorite eliminates the severe waste issues associated with iodobenzene diacetate. Thus, the present invention concerns a process for preparing certain substituted sulfilimines. having the general structure of (I),<br>

The sulfide starting materials of Formula n or a process for their preparation have been disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0228027. The sulfides (II) can be prepared in different ways as illustrated in Schemes A, B, C, D, E, F and G.<br>
In Scheme A, the sulfide of formula (A|), wherein L is a single bond, n is 1, R3 = H, and R1, R2 and Het are as previously defined can be prepared from halides of formula (D) by nucleophilic substitution with the sodium salt of an alkyl thiol.<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
In Scheme B, the sulfide of formula (A2), wherein L is a single bond, n is 3, R3 = H, and R1, R2 and Het are as previously defined, can be prepared from the chloride of formula (E) by reacting with a 2-mono substituted methyl malonate in the presence of base such as potassium tert-butoxide to provide 2,2-disubstitued malonate, hydrolysis under basic conditions to form a diacid, decarboxylation of the diacid by heating to give a monoacid, reduction of the monoacid with borane-<br>
tetrahyrofuran complex to provide an alcohol, tosylation of the alcohol with toluenesulfonyl chloride (tosyl chloride) in the presence of a base like pyridine to give a tosylate and replacement of the tosylate with the sodium salt of the desired thiol.<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
In Scheme C, the sulfide of formula (A3), wherein L is a single bond, n is 2, R^ = H, and R', R^ and Het are as previously defined, can be prepared from the nitrile of formula (F) by deprotonation with a strong base and alkylation with an alkyl iodide to give a-alkylated nitrile, hydrolysis of the a-alkylated nitrile in the presence of a strong acid like HCl to give an acid, reduction of the acid with borane-tetrahyrofuran complex to provide an alcohol, tosylation of the alcohol with tosyl chloride in the presence of a base like pyridine to give a tosylate and replacement of the tosylate with the sodium salt of the desired thiol.<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
In Scheme D, the sulfide of formula (A4), wherein n is 0, R' is -CH2-, L IS -CH(CH2)p- where p is either 2 or 3 and, taken together with R', S and L form a 5- or 6-membered ring, and Het is as previously described can be prepared from tetrahydrothiophene (p=2) or pentamethylene sulfide (p=3) (G). Chlorination of the cyclic sulfide starting material with N-chlorosuccini(hide in benzene followed by alkylation with certain lithiated heterocycles or Grignard reagents can lead to the desired sulfides (A4) in satisfactory yield.<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
A more efficient protocol to access cyclic sulfides of formula (A4) is illustrated in Scheme E where Het is a 6-substituted pyridin-3-yl and Z is previously defined. Accordingly, thiourea is added to a substituted chloromethyl pyridine, which, after hydrolysis, and alkylation with the appropriate bromo chloroalkane (p = 1, 2, or 3) under aqueous base conditions, yields sulfide (H). Subsequent cyclization of (H) in the presence of a base like potassium-r-butoxide in a polar aprotic solvent such as THF provides cyclic sulfide (A4).<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
Certain sulfides of formula (A|) wherein Het is a substituted pyridin-3-yl, Z is as previously defined, and R1, R2 = CH3 can be prepared alternatively via methods illustrated in Scheme F. Accordingly, the appropriate enone is coupled with dimethylaminoacrylonitrile and cyclized with ammonium acetate in DMF to yield the corresponding 6-substituted nicotinonitrile. Treatment with methyl-magnesium bromide, reduction with sodium borohydride, chlorination with thionyl chloride, and nucleophilic substitution with the sodium salt of an alkyl thiol provides desired sulfides (A|).<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
A variation of Scheme F is illustrated in Scheme G, wherein enamines, formed from the addition of an amine, e.g., pyrrolidine, with the Michael adduct of certain sulfides with appropriately substituted Î±,Ã-unsaturated aldehydes, are coupled with substituted enones and cyclized with anunonium acetate in CH3CN to yield the desired sulfides (A1) wherein R1, R2, R3, and Z are previously defined.<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
Cyanamide can be used as a solid or as an aqueous solution. The use of a 50 weight percent solution of cyanamide in water is often preferred. A stoichiometric amount of cyanamide is required, but it is often convenient to employ from about 0.9 to about 1.1 molar equivalents based on the amount of sulfide.<br>
By hypochlorite solution is meant an aqueous solution of a metallic salt of hypochlorous acid. The metallic salt can be a Group I alkali metal salt or a Group II alkaline earth metal salt. The preferred hypochlorite salts are sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. The aqueous hypochlorite solution usually contains from about 2 percent to about 12 percent hypochlorite salt, most preferably from about 5 percent to about 6 percent hypochlorite salt. It is often most convenient to use commercial Clorox TM bleach which contains about 5 to about 6 weight percent sodium hypochlorite in water. A stoichiometric amount of hypochlorite is required but it is often convenient to employ from about 0.95 to about 1.2 molar equivalents based on the amount of sulfide.<br>
Salts of meta-bisulfiie (such as sodium or potassium) can be used to quench any excess hypochlorite. The preferred salt of choice is sodium. The number of equivalents of mera-bisulfite can range from about 1.0 to about 5.0 relative to the hypochorite stoichiometry. The preferred range of equivalents is from about 2.0 to about 4.0 equivalents of mem-bisulfite per equivalent of hypochlorite remaining.<br>
The process of the present invention is conducted in a suitable organic solvent that is essentially inert to the strong oxidizing conditions of the reaction. Particularly suitable organic solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons like petroleum ether, aliphatic alcohols resistant to oxidation like r-butyl alcohol, halogenated aliphatic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane and dichlorobenzene, and aliphatic and aromatic<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile and benzonitrile. Halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic nitriles are preferred. It is often convenient to perform the oxidation in a biphasic solvent system comprising a mixture of, for example, a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane and water. An organic solvent that can facilitate partitioning of the desired sulfilimine is also desirable, with acetonitrile being especially preferred.<br>
The reaction temperature can range from about -40Â°C to about 30Â°C. The preferred range is about -10Â°C to about 10Â°C, with about -5Â°C to about 0oC being most preferred.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out in a two step sequence. For example, hypochlorite can be added to a cold solution of cyanamide in an essentially inert solvent, followed by a second later addition of the sulfide. Alternatively, the cyanamide and sulfide can be mixed together in an essentially inert solvent, and the hypochlorite can added to this cold mixture directly. After addition of the hypochlorite, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir anywhere from 15 min to 2 hr, typically 30 min at 0oC. A small amount of aqueous metabisulfite solution is typically added to destroy excess oxidant, as determined via testing with starch-I2 paper. At this point, the aqueous phase is separated from the organic sulfilimine phase. The organic solution of the sulfilimine can be used directly in a subsequent oxidation to an insecticidal sulfoximine or the sulfilimine can be isolated and purified by conventional techniques.<br>
The following examples are presented to illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Comparative Example with lodobenzene Diacetate: Preparation of (1 - (6-rtrifluoromethvnpvridin-3-vllethvl)(methvl)-X4-sulfanvlidenecyanamide<br>

A mixture of 221 g (1.0 mol) of 3-[l-(methylthio)ethyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine and 42 g (1.0 mol) of.cyanamide in 1200 mL of acetonitrile was cooled below 10Â°C. To this solution was added 322 g (1.0 mol) of iodobenzene diacetate all at once. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir below l0oC for 10 min and then the ice-bath was removed. The reaction mixture slowly warmed to room temperature over 1.5 hr, and then slowly exothermed from 22Â°-30Â°C over the next 0.5 hr. The reaction mixture was allowed to return to room temperature, and 800 mL of water was added. Excess oxidant was destroyed by adding -20 mL of an aqueous solution of sodium meta-bisulfite. To the mixture was added 800 mL of hexanes, the mixture stirred 5 min, and separated. The bottom aqueous layer was returned to the flask, 400 mL of water was added followed by 400 mL of hexanes. The mixture was stirred 5 min and separated. The aqueous layer was again returned to the round-bottom flask and extracted a third time with 400 mL of hexanes. The aqueous layer was concentrated in vacuo until a cloudy two-phase mixnjre was obtained. This mixture was extracted two times (700 mL, 300 mL) with dichloromethane, the organics combined and dried overnight over MgSO4. After filtration, LC analysis indicated the dichloromethane solution (1560 g) contained a 28:64 (area) ratio of two sulfilimine isomers.<br>

This oil was dissolved in 10 mL of EtOAc, and 10 mL of hexanes was added. To the cloudy mixture was added 1 mL of EtOAc to give back a clear solution. The flask was scratched with a glass rod to induce crystallization. The mixture was cooled in a refrigerator for 1 hr, filtered and exposed to high vacuum drying to give 1.2 g of a white powder, mp 115Â°-117Â°C, &gt;99% (area) LC of the first eluting isomer; 'H nmr (CDC13): 5 8.72 (d, J=2 Hz, 1 H), 8.04 (dd, J=2 Hz, 8 Hz. 1 H), 7.81 (d, J=8 Hz, 1 H), 4.41 (q, J=7 Hz, 1 H), 2.62 (s, 3 H), 1.90 (d, J=7 Hz, 3 H).<br>
Isomer B:<br>

Some undissolved solids were present in the calC1um hypochlorite solution and were added as well. The temperature was kept below 0Â°C during the addition. The pale yellow reaction mixture was allowed to stir at about 0Â°C for 65 minutes. To the yellow reaction mixture was added 0.53 g (2.8 mmoles) of sodium metabisulfite, in portions as a solid to destroy any remaining oxidant. A white flocculant was present in the reaction mixture. It was removed by vacuum filtration of the entire reaction mixture through a medium<br>
sintered glass filter funnel. The filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel and the phases were allowed to settle. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase re-extracted with acctonitrile (10 mL) and (15 mL). Sodium chloride (10.01 grams) was added to the aqueous phase during the second extraction to faC1litate a phase break. The organics were combined and this acetonitrile/sulfilimine solution was used directly in the following oxidation. LC analysis indicated a 1.00:1.08 area ratio of the two sulfilimine isomers and showed sulfilimine at 80 area% and sulfoxide (two isomers) at 13 area%.<br>
Example 5 Preparation of N-Cvano-S-f 1 -(6-trifluoromethyl-3-pvridinvl)ethvll-S-methvlsulfoximine<br>
(SCHEME.REMOVED)<br>
Acetonitrile (5 mL), water (10 mL) and 7.63 grams (21.5 mmoles) of a 40% aqueous solution of NaMn04 (Aldrich) were combined in a 100 mL three necked, round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, pressure equalizing addition funnel, thermowell/K-thermocouple, nitrogen oil bubbler and stopper. A solution of (~ 22.6 mmoles) sulfilinune in about 70 mL of acetonitrile was filtered through a cone of Whatman filter paper to remove a small amount of white flocculant. To the filtrate was added 1.23 mL (21.5 nunoles) of glaC1al acetic aC1d. The resulting solution was loaded to the addition funnel. The sodium permanganate solution was cooled to about 13 Â°C. The sulfilimine solution was added over 60 min with rapid stirring to the permanganate mixture. The temperature ranged from 13 to 18 Â°C during the addition. The reaction was allowed to post-react for 45 nunutes. The dark mixture was cooled to about 12Â°C, and a solution of 7.75 grams (40.8 mmoles) of sodium metabisulfite in 12 mL of<br>
water was added with rapid stirring over 7 minutes. A maximum reaction temperature of about 16 Â°C occurred during the addition. The reaction mixture was still dark at the end of the addition but gradually lightened to afford an off-white flocculent. A small dark rind remained on the flask sides at this point, but dissipated on continued stirring. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring over 105 minutes. The entire mixture was vacuum filtered through a course sintered glass filter funnel. The tan wet cake was rinsed with acetonitrile (10 mL). The combined filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel and the phases were allowed to settle. The clear, colorless lower phase (43.0 grams) was removed. The upper organic phase (56.1 grams) was concentrated to a mass of 22.0 grams at a pressure of 70 to 80 mm Hg and a temperature of 20 to 25 Â°C. The resulting two phase mixture was poured into 44.5 grams of well stirred, chilled (
