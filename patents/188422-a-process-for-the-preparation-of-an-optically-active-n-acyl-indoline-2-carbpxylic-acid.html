The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid in which a mixture of enantiotners of N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is contacted with an optically active resolving agent and the optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is liberated from the diastereomeric salt obtained.<br>
Such a process is disclosed in JP-A-61030572, where N-isopropyl-phenylalaninol is used as resolving agent.<br>
A drawback of the known process is that a recrystallization is needed to achieve an e.e. (enantiomeric excess) of more than 95% (95.4%).<br>
The invention provides a process that does not have the above-mentioned drawback.<br>
According to the invention this is achieved when as resolving agent use is made of a compound of formula 1<br><br><br>
where R^ represents a {1-20C) alkyl group and Rj a (4-20C) {hetero)aryl group or where Rj. and Rj together with the C atoms to which they are bound form a cycloalkyl group with 5-8 C atoms, fused with a (4-20C)(hetero) aryl group.<br>
It has been found that optically active indoline-2-carbo&gt;^)rt acid with a high e.e. can be prepared in a high yield with the resolving agents according to the invention.<br>
Examples of suitable resolving agents are compounds according to formula 1, where Ri represents an alkyl group with 1-2 0 C atoms, which may be substituted with, for instance, one or more nitro, mercapto, hydroxy, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkylamino, thio groups or halogens, and where Rj represents a (hetero) aryl group, for instance a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl or pyrimidyl group, which may be substituted with, for instance, one or more amino, nitro, mercapto, hydroxy, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkylamino, thio groups or halogens or where R^ and Rj together with the C atoms to which they are bound form a cycloalkyl group with fused to it a (hetero)aryl group, which may for instance be substituted with one or more amino, nitro, mercapto, hydroxy, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkylamino, thio groups or halogens. Preferably, Rj stands for a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group and Ri for a hydroxyalkyl group or R^ and Rj together with the C atoms to which they are bound form a cyclic alkyl group with fused to it a (hetero)aryl group, for instance (IR, 2R) or (IS, 2S)-<br>
1 6 AUG 2001 DUPLICATE<br><br><br>
1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-amino-l,3-propanediol or (IR, 2R) or (IS, 2S)-l-phenyl-2-araino-l,3-propanediol.<br>
As resolving agent use can also very suitably be made of a mixture of resolving agents of different chemical compositions, for instance a mixture of (IR, 2R)-1-{4-nitrophenyl)-2-amino-l,3-propanediol and (IS, 2S)-l-phenyl-2-amino-l,3-propanediol. The resolving agents used in the mixture of optically active resolving agents are preferably each present in the mixture in optically active form.<br>
The acyl groups in N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid can for instance be the groups R-C(O)-with R being alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy, for instance with 1-10 C-atoms; preferably with R being methyl.<br>
The temperature at which the resolution is effected preferably lies between 20 and 150°C, in particular between 50 and lOO'C. The pressure at which the resolution is carried out is not very critical. For practical reasons the resolution is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents that can be used in the resolution are water, alcohols, in particular methanol, ethanol, isopropanol. Preferably, as solvent use is made of an alcohol - optionally mixed with water - for instance ethanol or a mixture of alcohols - optionally mixed with water - for instance a methanol/ethanol mixture. It is also possible to effect the resolution starting from a slurry. The amount of solvent, the temperature and the number of equivalents of optically active resolving agent are preferably<br><br>
chosen so that the mixture of solvent, optically active resolving agent and enantiomer mixture to be resolved is (just) in solution. For a better reproducible crystallization preferably grafts of the salt of the resolving agent and the desired enantiomer of N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid are added, as a result of which in practice usually a better crystal size distribution of the diastereomeric salt is obtained.<br>
The amount of resolving agent to be used is preferably larger than 1 equivalent calculated on the amount of the desired enantiomer present in the mixture of enantiomers. When the starting mixture is a racemic mixture, the amount of resolving agent to be used is preferably between 0.5 and 1 equivalent, calculated on the total amount of the mixture of enantiomers to be resolved, in particular between 0.55 and 0.70 equivalent, more in particular between 0.65 and 0.7 equivalent. The enantiomeric purity of the resolving agent is preferably chosen as high as possible, in particular higher than 90%, more in particular higher than 95%.<br>
In principle it is, if desired, possible to recover and reuse the resolving agent, for instance via extraction or crystallization.<br>
Via desalting the optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid can subsequently be obtained from the diastereomeric salt in a generally known way, for instance through treatment with an acid, for instance a mineral acid, in particular diluted aqueous hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid. The temperature can, for instance, be chosen between 20 and 10 0 °C,<br><br>
preferably between 60 and 70*C, after which the optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxyxlic acid can be recovered for instance through cooling.<br>
The optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid can then be converted into optically active indoline-2-carboxylic acid through deacylation, for instance with the aid of an acid or a base. If desired, desalting and deacylation can be carried out in one step, that is, without isolation of the intermediate product.<br>
The undesired enantiomer of the N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid can if desired, after recovery from the mother liquor, be subjected to a racemization, for instance as described in JP-A-61083159 and in JP-A-02225463.<br>
The racemic mixture of enantiomers can very suitably be prepared via Fischer indole cyclization of a 2-phenylhydrazonopropionic acid (derivative), for instance the free acid or an ester, in particular an alkyl or aryl ester, more in particular the ethyl ester; optionally hydrolysis to yield the free acid; N-acylation and reduction of the indole-2-carboxylic acid (derivative) to the corresponding indoline-2-carboxylic acid (derivative). The order of the steps is not particularly important. Preferably, the ethyl, ester is started from in the Fischer indole cyclization, then the ester is hydrolyzed to yield the free acid, subsequently the acid is acylated to N-acyl-indole-2-carboxylic acid and finally the N-acyl-indole-2-carboxylic acid is reduced to the corresponding N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid. The invention therefore<br><br>
also relates to a process for the preparation of optically active indoline-2-carboxylic acid (derivatives) starting from 2-phenylhydrazono-propionic acid (derivatives). It has been found that optically active indoline-2-carboxylic acid with a high enantiomeric excess can be prepared with a high efficiency in this way. (S)-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is an intermediate in the preparation of perindopril.<br>
The Fischer indole cyclization is carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst, for instance a mineral acid, in particular, HBr; a sulphonic acid, in particular methane sulphonic acid and p-toluene sulphonic acid; BF30{Et)2; metal halides, in particular ZnCl2.<br>
Preferably, the 2-phenylhydrazonopropionic acid (derivative) is prepared in situ from phenylhydrazine and pyruvic acid or a pyruvic acid ester through condensation in a suitable organic solvent, for instance glacial acetic acid, benzene, toluene, the water formed being removed through (azeotropic) distillation. However, isolation of the 2-phenylhydrazonopropionic acid (derivative) is also possible, following which the hydrazone obtained is used in the Fischer indole cyclization.<br>
The reaction medium of the Fischer indole cyclization is preferably kept as water-free as possible, since water produces undesirable side reactions, in particular hydrolysis of the 2-phenylhydrazonopropionic acid (derivative).<br>
Preferably, the ethyl ester is used as derivative of 2-phenylhydrazonopropionic acid in<br><br>
connection with the stability of the 2-phenylhydrazonopropionic acid (derivative), the solubility of the intermediates and the product during the Fischer indole cyclization in apolar solvents, for instance aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular benzene and toluene, and the availability of the pyruvic acid ester.<br>
The geometry of the 2-phenylhydrazono-propionic acid (derivative) (syn/anti) has little effect on the yield of the Fischer indole cyclization, for under the reaction conditions isomerization takes place by the action of the acid catalyst.<br>
Suitable solvents are, for instance, carboxylic acids, in particular acetic acid, aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular benzene, toluene, xylene or mixtures thereof, or alcohols, in particular the alcohol corresponding to the ester used, for instance ethanol when the ethyl ester is used.<br>
Preferably, for safety reasons and to avoid undesirable oxidation reactions use is made of a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The reaction temperature of the Fischer indole cyclization is preferably in the range of 15-140'C, in particular 15-50°C, more in particular 20-35°C, this being a compromise between stability of the reagents/product, selectivity, and rate of the Fischer indole cyclization.<br>
The amount of acid catalyst to be used is preferably in the range of 1-1.5 equivalents, preferably 1-1.3 equivalents. The minimum amount needed<br><br>
is 1 equivalent, since salt formation with the NH3 formed renders the catalyst inactive.<br>
To prevent subsequent reactions of the indole-2-carboxylic acid derivative with the pyruvic acid (derivative) at the free 3-position of the indole ring, preferably a small excess of phenylhydrazine relative to pyruvic acid (derivative) is used, in the case of in situ preparation of the 2 phenylhydrazono-propionic acid (derivative).<br>
The hydrolysis of the indole-2-carboxylic acid ester with water is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, in particular sodium or potassium hydroxide, or, when the hydrolysis is carried out in a two-phase system, with the aid of a phase transfer catalyst, for instance tetrabutyl ammoniumbromide and a base, in particular the above-mentioned bases. If desired, the hydrolysis can be effected on the non¬isolated indole-2-carboxylic acid ester after working up of the Fischer indole cyclization.<br>
The acylation of the indole-2-carboxylic acid (derivative) or the indoline-2-carboxylic acid (derivative) with a suitable acylation agent preferably takes place in a basic organic environment. If desired, an acylation catalyst can be used, for instance pyridine or 4-dimethylaminopyridine. As acylation agent use can be made, for instance, of acyl chlorides, in particular acetyl chloride and trifluoroacetyl chloride, anhydrides, in particular acetic anhydride and alkoxycarbonyl chlorides, in particular tert.-butoxycarbonyl chloride. Suitable bases that can be used in the acylation are, for instance, carboxylic<br><br>
acid salts, in particular sodium acetate and potassium acetate, amines, in particular triethylamine, hydroxides, in particular sodium hydroxide in combination with a phase transfer catalyst. As solvent the customary solvents can be used, for instance dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane, methylacetate, tertbutyl-acetate, methyl-tert.butylether (MTBE), acetic anhydride and acetone.<br>
The temperature at which the acylation takes place preferably lies between -5°C and the reflux temperature of the chosen solvent, in particular between 0 and 25'C, more in particular between 0 and 5°C.<br>
The amount of base to be used preferably lies between 1 and 2 equivalents, calculated on the amount of the compound to be acylated, in particular between 1.25 and 1.8 equivalents. Preferably, the solvent, the base and the catalyst are supplied successively, following which the indole-2-carboxylic acid (derivative) and lastly the acylation agent are dosed.<br>
Starting from indole-2-carboxylic acid preferably the combination acetone, triethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and acetic anhydride is used.<br>
The reduction of the - optionally acylated - indole compound to the corresponding indoline compound can, for instance, be effected by means of chemical reduction, catalytic hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation. Preferably, a catalytic hydrogenation is carried out with the aid of Hj and a noble metal<br><br><br><br>
catalyst, starting from N-acyl-indole-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
As catalysts the known hydrogenation catalysts are eligible, for instance catalysts on the basis of metals, for instance Pd, Pt, Ru, Rh or Ni, in particular such catalysts on a carrier, for instance on C. The amount of the metal in the catalyst is not critical and in the known catalysts this amount usually lies between 5 and 2 0 wt.% metal, calculated on the amount of the carrier.<br>
The hydrogenation is preferably carried out at a temperature between 50 and 100*&gt;C, more in particular between 50 and 85*'C. The pressure to be applied can vary within wide limits and is preferably between 0.1 and 10 MPa.<br>
As solvent use can be made, for instance, of esters, in particular ethylacetate, carboxylic acids, in particular glacial acetic acid, and lower alkyl (1-4 C) alcohols, in particular isopropanol, ethanol, methanol and n-propanol.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of an optically active N-acyl-indoIine-2-carboxyHc acid, the acyl group being represented by the formula R-C(O)- with R being alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy with 1-10 C-atoms, in which a mixture of enantiomers of N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is contacted with an optically active resolving agent and the optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is liberated from the resulting diastereomeric salt, characterized in that as resolving agent use is made of a compound of formula 1<br>

After filtration over a glass filter, 2 washings with 5 ml of a mixture containing 90% EtOH, 5% water and 5% MeOH^M'ter drying at 4 0"0.0.82 g white (R)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid- (1S,2R)-norephedrine salt was obtained (probably as methanol solvate). The content of (R)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid was 51.8 weight % (HPLC) corresponding<br><br>
to a yield of 2 0.9%. Enantiomeric excess = 95,5% (chiral HPLC).<br>
Example X<br>
Desalting to (S)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
1.835 kg dried (S)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid-(IR, 2R)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-ainino-l, 3-propanediol salt was dosed in portions to 2.64 1 2N HCl aq (1.13 eq HCl) with heating to 60"C, followed by 3 0 minutes' stirring at 60-70°C. After cooling to 20°C, filtration on an FIBA, washing with 2x0.71 water and drying, 871 g white (S)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid was obtained, corresponding to a yield of 96.5%. Enantiomeric excess = 99.9% (chiral HPLC),<br>
Example XI<br>
Deacetylation of (S)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic<br>
acid to (S)-indoline-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
With heating at 20-70°C 712.3 g wet (S)-N-acetyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid (443 g based on dry weight) was added in portions to 958 ml 5N HCl aq, followed by rinsing with 10 0 ml water. The slurry was heated to about 103°C (reflux) and refluxed for 45 minutes. After cooling to 70°C, the solution was decoloured using Norit. After filtration 50% NaOH aq was used at 20-25*&gt;C to set the pH of the filtrate at 4. The crystals were filtered off and washed with 3 x 400 and 3 X 350 ml water. Upon drying, 306.2 g white (S)-indoline-2-carboxylic acid was obtained, corresponding to a yield of 87%. Enantiomeric excess &gt; 99.9% (chiral<br><br>
HPLC). Content = 99.4% w/w (titration with sodium hydroxide), [a] "□= -ll7.2°(c=:l, 2N HCl) .<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A process for the preparation of an optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid, the acyl group being represented by the formula R-C(0)- with R being alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy with 1-10 C-atoras, in which a mixture of enantiomers of N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is contacted with an optically active resolving agent and the optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid is liberated from the resulting diastereomeric salt, characterized in that as resolving agent use is made of a compound of formula 1<br><br>
where Ri represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted (hetero) aryl group having 4 to 20 carbon atoms or in which R1 and R2 together with the C atoms to which they are bound form a cycloalkyl group having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, fused with a substituted or unsubstituted (hetero) aey group having 4 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
2.	The   process   according   to   claim    1,   in   which   R1   represents hydroxym ethyl and Rj represents a phenyl group.<br>
3.	The  process  accordmg  to   claim   2,  in   which   R2  represents  p-nitrophenyl.<br><br>
4.	The process according to any one of claim 1 to 3, in which N-acetyl-<br>
indoline-2-carboxylic acid is used as the mixture of enantioiners.<br>
5.	The process according to any one of claims I to 4, in which the<br>
optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-carboxylic acid obtained, is<br>
optionally deacylated.<br>
6.	A process for the preparation of an optically active N-acyl-indoline-2-<br>
carboxylic acid substantially as herein described and exemplified.<br>
