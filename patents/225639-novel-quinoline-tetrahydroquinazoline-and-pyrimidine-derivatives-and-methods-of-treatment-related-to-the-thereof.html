DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL QUINOLINE, TETRAHYDROQUINAZOLINE, AND PYRIMIDINE<br>
DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF TREATMENT RELATED<br>
TO THE USE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which act as antagonists for MCH receptors and<br>
to the use of these compounds in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH), a cyclic peptide, has been identified as the<br>
endogenous ligand of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor SLC-1. See, for example, Shimomura<br>
et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 261, 622-26 (1999). Studies have indicated that MCH acts<br>
as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator to alter a number of behavioral responses such as feeding habits.<br>
For example, injection of MCH into rats has been reported to increase their consumption of food.<br>
Reports indicate that genetically engineered mice which lack MCH show lower body weight and<br>
increased metabolism. See Saito et al., TEM, vol. 11,299 (2000). As such, the literature suggests that<br>
discovery of MCH antagonists that interact with SCL-1 expressing cells will be useful in developing<br>
obesity treatments. See Shimomura et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 261, 622-26 (1999).<br>
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) share a common structural motif. All these receptors<br>
have seven sequences of between 22 to 24 hydrophobic amino acids that form seven alpha helices,<br>
each of which spans the membrane. The fourth and fifth transmembrane helices are joined on the<br>
extracellular side of the membrane by a strand of amino acids that forms a relatively large loop.<br>
Another larger loop, composed primarily of hydrophilic amino acids, joins transmembrane helices<br>
five and six on the intracellular side of the membrane. The carboxy terminus of the receptor lies<br>
intracellularly, and the amino terminus lies in the extracellular space. It is thought that the loop joining<br>
helices five and six, as well as the carboxy terminus, interact with the G protein. Currently, Gq, Gs,<br>
Gi, and Go are G proteins that have been identified as possible proteins that interact with the receptor.<br><br>
2<br>
Under physiological conditions, GPCRs exist in the cell membrane in equilibrium between<br>
two different states or conformations: an "inactive" state and an "active" state. A receptor in an<br>
inactive state is unable to link to the intracellular transduction pathway to produce a biological<br>
response. Changing the receptor conformation to the active state allows linkage to the transduction<br>
pathway and produces a biological response.<br>
A receptor may be stabilized in an active state by an endogenous ligand or an exogenous<br>
agonist ligand. Recent discoveries, including but not exclusively limited to, modifications to the<br>
amino acid sequence of the receptor, provide alternative mechanisms other than ligands to stabilize the<br>
active state conformation. These approaches effectively stabilize the receptor in an active state by<br>
simulating the effect of a ligand binding to the receptor. Stabilization by such ligand-independent<br>
approaches is termed "constitutive receptor activation." In contrast, antagonists can competitively<br>
bind to the receptor at the same site as agonists, but do not activate the intracellular response initiated<br>
by the active form of the receptor, and therefore inhibit the intracellular responses by agonists.<br>
Certain 2-aminoquinazoline derivatives have been reported to be NPY antagonists which are<br>
said to be effective in the treatment of disorders and diseases associated with the NPY receptor<br>
subtype Y5. See PCT Patent Application 97/20823. Quinazoline derivatives have also been found to<br>
be useful by enhancing antitumor activity. See PCT Patent Application 92/07844. And also the<br>
quinoline derivatives which have an antagonist activity for MCH receptor are known in these patents,<br>
WO03/070244, WO03/105850, WO03/45313, WO03/045920, and WO04/04726.<br>
Recently, our current knowledge of human obesity has advanced dramatically. Previously,<br>
obesity was viewed as an oppugnant behavior of inappropriate eating in the setting of appealing foods.<br>
Studies of animal models of obesity, biochemical alterations in both humans and animals, and the<br>
complex interactions of psychosocial and cultural factors that create receptiveness to human obesity<br>
indicate that this disease in humans is multifaceted and deeply entrenched in biologic systems. Thus,<br>
it is almost certain that obesity has multiple causes and that there are different types of obesity. Not<br>
only does MCHR1 antagonist have potent and durable anti-obesity effects in rodents, it has surprising<br>
antidepressant and anxiolytic properties as well (Borowsky et al., Nature Medicine, 8, 825-830, 2002).<br>
MCHR1 antagonists have been reported to show antidepressant and anxiolytic activities in rodent<br><br>
3<br>
models such as social interaction, forced swimming test and ultrasonic vocalization. These findings<br>
indicate that MCHRI antagonists could be useful for treatment of obesity patients with multiple<br>
causes. Moreover, MCHRI antagonists could be used to treat subjects not only with obesity, but also<br>
those with depression and anxiety. These advantages make it different from NPY receptor antagonists,<br>
with which anxiogenic-like activity can be expected, as NPY itself has anxiolytic-like effect.<br>
Obesity is also regarded as a chronic disease and the possibly of long-term treatment is a<br>
concept that is receiving more attention. In this context, it is noteworthy that the depletion of MCH<br>
leads to hypophagia as well as leanness (Shimada et al., Nature, 396, 670-674, 1998). By contrast,<br>
NPY (Erickson et al., Nature, 381, 415-418, 1996), as well as the Yl (Pedrazzini et al., Nature<br>
Medicine, 4, 722-726, 1998) and Y5 receptors (Marsh et al., Nature Medicine, 4, 718-721, 1998),<br>
disrupted mice maintained a stable body weight or rather became obese. Considering the above<br>
reports, MCHRI antagonists can be more attractive than Yl or Y5 receptor antagonists in terms of<br>
long-term treatment of obese patients.<br>
Obesity, which is the result of an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, is<br>
highly correlated with insulin resistance and diabetes in experimental animals and human. However, the<br>
molecular mechanisms that are involved in obesity-diabetes syndromes are not clear. During early<br>
development of obesity, increase insulin secretion balances insulin resistance and protects patients from<br>
hyperglycemia (Le Stunff, et al. Diabetes 43, 696-702 (1989)). However, after several decades, (3 cell<br>
function deteriorates and non-insulin-dependent diabetes develops in about 20% of the obese population<br>
(Pederson, P. Diab. Metab. Rev. 5, 505-509 (1989)) and (Brancati, F. L., et al., Arch. Intern. Med. 159,<br>
957-963 (1999)). Given its high prevalence in modem societies, obesity has thus become the leading risk<br>
factor for NIDDM (Hill, J. O., et al., Science 280, 1371-1374 (1998)). However, the factors which<br>
predispose a fraction of patients to alteration of insulin secretion in response to fat accumulation remain<br>
unknown.<br>
Whether someone is classified as overweight or obese is generally determined on the basis of<br>
their body mass index (BMI) which is calculated by dividing body weight (kg) by height squared (m2).<br>
Thus, the units of BMI are kg/nr and it is possible to calculate the BMI range associated with<br>
minimum mortality in each decade of life. Overweight is defined as a BMI in the range 25-30 kg/m2,<br><br>
4<br>
and obesity as a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 (see TABLE below). There are problems with this<br>
definition in that it does not take into account the proportion of body mass that is muscle in relation to<br>
fat (adipose tissue). To account for this, obesity can also be defined on the basis of body fat content:<br>
greater than 25% and 30% in males and females, respectively.<br>
CLASSIFICATION OF WEIGHT BY<br>
BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)<br>
BMI	CLASSIFICATION<br>
18.5-24.9	Normal<br>
25.0-29.9	Overweight<br>
30.0-34.9	Obesity (Class I)<br>
35.0-39.9	Obesity (Class II)<br>
&gt;40	Extreme Obesity (Class III)<br>
As the BMI increases there is an increased risk of death from a variety of causes that is<br>
independent of other risk factors. The most common diseases with obesity are cardiovascular disease<br>
(particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity aggravates the development of diabetes), gall bladder<br>
disease (particularly cancer) and diseases of reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest<br>
reduction in body weight can correspond to a significant reduction in the risk of developing coronary<br>
heart disease.<br>
Compounds marketed as anti-obesity agents include Orlistat (XENICAL™) and Sibutramine.<br>
Orlistat (a lipase inhibitor) inhibits fat absorption directly and tends to produce a high incidence of<br>
unpleasant (though relatively harmless) side-effects such as diarrhea. Sibutramine (a mixed<br>
5-HT/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients.<br>
The serotonin releaser/reuptake inhibitors fenfluramine (Pondimin™) and dexfenfluramine<br>
(Redux™) have been reported to decrease food intake and body weight over a prolonged period<br><br>
5<br>
(greater than 6 months). However, both products were withdrawn after reports of preliminary<br>
evidence of heart valve abnormalities associated with their use. Accordingly, there is a need for the<br>
development of a safer anti-obesity agent.<br>
Obesity considerably increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well.<br>
Coronary insufficiency, atheromatous disease, and cardiac insufficiency are at the forefront of the<br>
cardiovascular complication induced by obesity. It is estimated that if the entire population had an<br>
ideal weight, the risk of coronary insufficiency would decrease by 25% and the risk of cardiac<br>
insufficiency and of cerebral vascular accidents by 35%. The incidence of coronary diseases is<br>
doubled in subjects less than 50 years of age who are 30% overweight. The diabetes patient faces a<br>
30% reduced Hfespan. After age 45, people with diabetes are about three times more likely than<br>
people without diabetes to have significant heart disease and up to five times more likely to have a<br>
stroke. These findings emphasize the inter-relations between risks factors for NIDDM and coronary<br>
heart disease and the potential value of an integrated approach to the prevention of these conditions<br>
based on the prevention of these conditions based on the prevention of obesity (Perry, I. J., et al., BMJ<br>
310,560-564(1995)).<br>
An increasing number of children and adolescents are overweight. Although not all<br>
overweight children will necessarily become overweight adults, the growing occurrence of obesity in<br>
childhood is likely to be reflected in increasing obesity in adult years. The high prevalence of obesity<br>
in our adult population and the likelihood that the nation of the future will be even more obese<br>
demands a re-examination of the health implications of this disease. See, Health Implications of<br>
Obesity. NIH Consens. Statement Online 1985 Feb 11-13; 5(9):l-7.<br>
"Clinical obesity" is a measurement of the excess body fat relative to lean body mass and is<br>
defined as a body weight more than 20% above the ideal body weight. Recent estimates suggest that<br>
1 in 2 adults in the United States is clinically obese, an increase of more than 25% over the past<br>
decades. Flegal M.D. et al., 22 Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disor. 39 (1998). Both overweight<br>
conditions and clinical obesity are a major health concerns worldwide, in particular because clinical<br>
obesity is often accompanied by numerous complications, i.e., hypertension and Type II diabetes,<br>
which in turn can cause coronary artery disease, stroke, late-stage complications of diabetes and<br><br>
6<br>
premature death. (See, e.g., Nishina P.M. et al., 43 Metab. 554 (1994)).<br>
Although the etiologic mechanisms underlying obesity require further clarification, the net<br>
effect of such mechanisms leads to an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Both genetic<br>
and environmental factors are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. These include<br>
excess caloric intake, decreased physical activity, and metabolic and endocrine abnormalities.<br>
Treatment of overweight conditions and clinical obesity via pharmaceutical agents are not<br>
only of importance with respect to the conditions themselves, but also with respect to the possibility<br>
of preventing other diseases that are associated with, e.g., clinical obesity, as well as enhancement of<br>
the positive feeling of "self' that often accompanies those who are overweight or clinically obese and<br>
who encounter a significant reduction in body weight. Given the foregoing discussion, it is apparent<br>
that compounds which help in the treatment of such disorders would be useful and would provide an<br>
advance in both research and clinical medicine. The present invention is directed to these, as well as<br>
other, important ends.<br>

straight chain and branched chain, including for example but not limited to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, tsopentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl, and the like.<br>
The term "alkoxy" is intended to denote substituents of the formula -O-alkyl.<br>

subcombination of the members of such groups.<br>
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a major class of cell surface receptors with<br>
which many neurotransmitters interact to mediate their effects. GPCRs are predicted to have seven<br>
membrane-spanning domains and are coupled to their effectors via G-proteins linking receptor<br>
activation with intracellular biochemical sequelae such as stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Melanin<br>
Concentrating Hormone (MCH), a cyclic peptide, has been identified as the endogenous ligand of the<br>
orphan G-protein coupled receptor SLC-1. See, for example, Shimomura et al., Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Res. Commun. 261, 622-26 (1999). Studies have indicated that MCH acts as a<br>
neurotransmitter/modulator/regulator to alter a number of behavioral responses.<br>
Mammalian MCH (19 amino acids) is highly conserved between rat, mouse, and human,<br>
exhibiting 100% amino acid identity, but its physiological roles are less clear. MCH has been reported<br>
to participate in a variety of processes including feeding, water balance, energy metabolism, general<br>
arousal/attention state, memory and cognitive functions, and psychiatric disorders. For reviews, see<br>
1. Baker, Int. Rev. Cytol. 126:1-47(1991); 2. Baker, TEM 5:120-126 (1994); 3. Nahon, Critical Rev.<br>
inNeurobiol 221:221-262, (1994); 4. Knigge etal., Peptides 18(7):1095-1097, (1996). The role of<br>
MCH in feeding or body weight regulation is supported by Qu et al., Nature 380:243-247, (1996),<br><br>
295<br>
demonstrating that MCH is over expressed in the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice compared with<br>
ob/+mice, and that fasting further increased MCH mRNA in both obese and normal mice during<br>
fasting. MCH also stimulated feeding in normal rats when injected into the lateral ventricles as<br>
reported by Rossi etal., Endocrinology 138:351-355, (1997). MCH also has been reported to<br>
functionally antagonize the behavioral effects of ct-MSH; see: Miller et al., Peptides 14:1-10, (1993);<br>
Gonzalez et al5 Peptides 17:171-177, (1996); and Sanchez et al., Peptides 18:3933-396, (1997). In<br>
addition, stress has been shown to increase POMC mRNA levels while decreasing the MCH precursor<br>
preproMCH (ppMCH) mRNA levels; Presse et al., Endocrinology 131:1241 -1250, (1992). Thus<br>
MCH can serve as an integrative neuropeptide involved in the reaction to stress, as well as in the<br>
regulation of feeding and sexual activity; Baker, Int. Rev. Cytol. 126:1-47, (1991); Knigge et al.,<br>
Peptides 17:1063-1073,(1996).<br>
The localization and biological activities of MCH peptide suggest that the modulation of<br>
MCH receptor activity can be useful in a number of therapeutic applications. MCH is expressed in the<br>
lateral hypothalamus, a brain area implicated in the regulation of thirst and hunger: Grillon et al.,<br>
Neuropeptides 31:131-136, (1997); recently orexins A and B, which are potent orexigenic agents,<br>
have been shown to have very similar localization to MCH in the lateral hypothalamus; Sakurai et al.,<br>
Cell 92:573-585 (1998). MCH mRNA levels in this brain region are increased in rats after 24 hours<br>
of food-deprivation; Herve and Fellmann, Neurpeptides 31:237-242 (1997); after insulin injection, a<br>
significant increase in the abundance and staining intensity of MCH immunoreactive perikarya and<br>
fibres was observed concurrent with a significant increase in the level of MCH mRNA;<br>
Bahjaoui-Bouhaddi et al., Neuropeptides 24:251-258, (1994). Consistent with the ability of MCH to<br>
stimulate feeding in rats; Rossi et al., Endocrinology 138:351-355, (1997); is the observation that<br>
MCH mRNA levels are upregulated in the hypothalami of obese ob/ob mice; Qu et al., Nature<br>
380:243-247, (1996); and decreased in the hypothalami of rats treated with leptin, whose food intake<br>
and body weight gains are also decreased; Sahu, Endocrinology 139:795-798, (1998). MCH appears<br>
to act as a functional antagonist of the melanocortin system in its effects on food intake and on<br>
hormone secretion within the HPA (hypothalamopituitary/adrenal axis); Ludwig et al., Am. J. Physiol.<br>
Endocrinol. Metab. 274:E627-E633, (1998). Together these data suggest a role for endogenous MCH<br><br>
296<br>
in the regulation of energy balance and response to stress, and provide a rationale for the development<br>
of specific compounds acting at MCH receptors for use in the treatment of obesity and stress-related<br>
disorders.<br>
Accordingly, a MCH receptor antagonist is desirable for the prophylaxis or treatment of<br>
obesity or obesity related disorders. An obesity related disorder is a disorder that has been directly or<br>
indirectly associated to obesity, such as, type II diabetes, syndrome X, impaired glucose tolerance,<br>
dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders including<br>
atherosclerosis, insulin resistance associated with obesity and psoriasis, for treating diabetic<br>
complications and other diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), certain renal diseases<br>
including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome,<br>
hypertensive nephrosclerosis, end-stage renal diseases and microalbuminuria as well as certain eating<br>
disorders.<br>
In species studied to date, a major portion of the neurons of the MCH cell group occupies a<br>
rather constant location in those areas of the lateral hypothalamus and subthalamus where they lie and<br>
can be a part of some of the so-called "extrapyramidal" motor circuits. These involve substantial<br>
striato- and pallidofugal pathways involving the thalamus and cerebral cortex, hypothalamic areas,<br>
and reciprocal connections to subthaiamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and mid-brain centers;<br>
Bittencourt et al., J. Comp. Neurol. 319:218-245, (1992). In their location, the MCH cell group may<br>
offer a bridge or mechanism for expressing hypothalamic visceral activity with appropriate and<br>
coordinated motor activity. Clinically it can be of some value to consider the involvement of this<br>
MCH system in movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntingdon's Chorea in which<br>
extrapyramidal circuits are known to be involved.<br>
Human genetic linkage studies have located authentic hMCH loci on chromosome 12<br>
(12q23-24) and the variant hMCH loci on chromosome 5 (5qI2-13) (Pedeutour et al., 1994). Locus<br>
12q23-24 coincides with a locus to which autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2) has<br>
been mapped; Auburger et al., Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 61:252-256, (1992); Twells et al., Cytogenet.<br>
Cell. Genet. 61:262-265, (1992). This disease comprises neurodegenerative disorders, including an<br>
olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Furthermore, the gene for Darier's disease, has been mapped to locus<br><br>
297<br>
12q23-24; Craddock et al., Hum. Mol. Genet. 2:1941-1943, (1993). Dariers' disease is characterized<br>
by abnormalities I keratinocyte adhesion and mental illnesses in some families. In view of the<br>
functional and neuroanatomical patterns of the MCH neural system in the rat and human brains, the<br>
MCH gene can represent a good candidate for SCA2 or Darier's disease. Interestingly, diseases with<br>
high social impact have been mapped to this locus. Indeed, the gene responsible for chronic or acute<br>
forms of spinal muscular atrophies has been assigned to chromosome 5q 12-13 using genetic linkage<br>
analysis; Melki et al., Nature (London) 344:767-768, (1990); Westbrook et al., Cytogenet. Cell. Genet.<br>
61:225-231, (1992). Furthermore, independent lines of evidence support the assignment of a major<br>
schizophrenia locus to chromosome 5ql 1.2-13.3; Sherrington et al., Nature (London) 336:164-3 67,<br>
(1988); Bassett et al, Lancet 1:799-801, (1988); Gilliam et al, Genomics 5:940-944, (1989). The<br>
above studies suggest that MCH can play a role in neurodegenerative diseases and disorders of<br>
emotion.<br>
Additional therapeutic applications for MCH-related compounds are suggested by the<br>
observed effects of MCH in other biological systems. For example, MCH can regulate reproductive<br>
functions in male and female rats. MCH transcripts and MCH peptide were found within germ ceils<br>
in testes of adult rats, suggesting that MCH can participate in stem cell renewal and/or differentiation<br>
of early spermatocytes; Hervieu etal. Biology of Reduction 54:1161-1172, (1996). MCH injected<br>
directly into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) or ventromedial nucleus (VMN) stimulated sexual<br>
activity in female rats; Gonzalez et al., Peptides 17:171-177, (1996). In ovariectomized rats primed<br>
with estradiol, MCH stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) release while anti-MCH antiserum<br>
inhibited LH release; Gonzalez et al, Neuroendocrinology 66:254-262, (1997). The zona incerta,<br>
which contains a large population of MCH cell bodies, has previously been identified as a regulatory<br>
site for the pre-ovulatory LH surge; MacKenzie et al, Neuroendocrinology 39:289-295, (1984).<br>
MCH has been reported to influence release of pituitary hormones including ACTH and oxytocin.<br>
MCH analogues can also be useful in treating epilepsy. In the PTZ seizure model, injection of MCH<br>
prior to seizure induction prevented seizure activity in both rats and guinea pigs, suggesting that<br>
MCH-containing neurons can participate in the neural circuitry underlying PTZ-induced seizure;<br>
Knigge and Wagner, Peptides 18:1095-1097, (1997). MCH has also been observed to affect<br><br>
298<br>
behavioral correlates of cognitive functions. MCH treatment hastened extinction of the passive<br>
avoidance response in rats; McBride et al., Peptides 15:757-759, (1994); raising the possibility that<br>
MCH receptor antagonists can be beneficial for memory storage and/or retention. A possible role for<br>
MCH in the modulation or perception of pain is supported by the dense innervation of the<br>
periaqueductal grey (PAG) by MCH-positive fibers. Finally, MCH can participate in the regulation<br>
of fluid intake. ICV infusion of MCH in consC1-5us sheep produced diuretic, natriuretic, and kaliuretic<br>
changes in response to increased plasma volume; Parkes, J. Neuroendocrinol. 8:57-63, (1996).<br>
Together with anatomical data reporting the presence of MCH in fluid regulatory areas of the brain,<br>
the results indicate that MCH can be an important peptide involved in the central control of fluid<br>
homeostasis in mammals.<br>
In a recent citation MCHR1 antagonists surprisingly demonstrated their use as an<br>
anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety agents. MCHR1 antagonists have been reported to show<br>
antidepressant and anxiolytic activities in rodent models, such as, social interaction, forced swimming<br>
test and ultrasonic vocalization. Therefore, MCHR1 antagonists could be useful to independently<br>
treat subjects with depression and/or anxiety. Also, MCHR1 antagonists could be useful to treat<br>
subjects that suffer from depression and/or anxiety and obesity.<br>
This invention provides a method of treating an abnormality in a subject wherein the<br>
abnormality is alleviated by decreasing the activity of a mammalian MCH1 receptor which comprises<br>
administering to the subject an amount of a compound which is a mammalian MCH1 receptor<br>
antagonist effective to treat the abnormality. In separate embodiments, the abnormality is a regulation<br>
of a steroid or pituitary hormone disorder, an epinephrine release disorder, an anxiety disorder, genta<br>
gastrointestinal disorder, a cardiovascular disorder, an electrolyte balance disorder, hypertension,<br>
diabetes, a respiratory disorder, asthma, a reproductive function disorder, an immune disorder, an<br>
endocrine disorder, a musculoskeletal disorder, a neuroendocrine disorder, a cognitive disorder, a<br>
memory disorder, a sensory modulation and transmission disorder, a motor coordination disorder, a<br>
sensory integration disorder, a motor integration disorder, a dopaminergic function disorder, a sensory<br>
transmission disorder, an olfaction disorder, a sympathetic innervation disorder, an affective disorder,<br>
a stress-related disorder, a fluid-balance disorder, a seizure disorder, pain, psychotic behavior,<br><br>

morphine tolerance, opiate addiction or migraine.<br>
Compositions of the invention can conveniently be administered in unit dosage form and can<br>
be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, for example, as described in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA, 1980).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be employed as the sole active agent in a pharmaceutical<br>
or can be used in combination with other active ingredients which could facilitate the therapeutic<br>
effect of the compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention or a solvate or physiologically functional derivative<br>
thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, specifically as a MCH<br>
receptor antagonists. By the term "active ingredient" is defined in the context of a "pharmaceutical<br>
composition" and shall mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary<br>
pharmaceutical benefit, as opposed to an "inactive ingredient" which would generally be recognized<br>
as providing no pharmaceutical benefit. The term "pharmaceutical composition" shall mean a<br>
composition comprising at one active ingredient and at least one ingredient that is not an active<br>
ingredient (for example and not limitation, a filler, dye, or a mechanism for slow release), whereby the<br>
composition is amenable to use for a specified, efficaC1-5us outcome in a mammal (for example, and<br>
not limitation, a human).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions, including, but not limited to, pharmaceutical compositions,<br>
comprising at least one compound of the present invention and/or an acceptable salt or solvate thereof<br>
(e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate) as an active ingredient combined with at least one<br>
carrier or excipient (e.g., pharmaceutical carrier or excipient) can be used in the treatment of clinical<br>
conditions for which a MCH receptor antagonist is indicated. At least one compound of the present<br>
invention can be combined with the carrier in either solid or liquid form in a unit dose formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical carrier must be compatible with the other ingredients in the composition and must<br>
be tolerated by the individual recipient. Other physiologically active ingredients can be incorporated<br>
into the pharmaceutical composition of the invention if desired, and if such ingredients are compatible<br>
with the other ingredients in the composition. Formulations can be prepared by any suitable method,<br>
typically by uniformly mixing the active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or<br><br>
300<br>
both, in the required proportions, and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired<br>
shape.<br>
Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting<br>
lubricants, and disintegrants can be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid<br>
preparations for oral administration can be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily<br>
suspensions, and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations can be in the form of dry powder that can<br>
be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as<br>
suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives, and<br>
flavorings and colorants can be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms can be<br>
prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing<br>
the solution before filling and sealing an appropriate vial or ampoule. These are just a few examples<br>
of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms.<br>
It is noted that when the MCH receptor antagonists are utilized as active ingredients in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, these are not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human<br>
mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-care mandate that<br>
consideration be given for the use of MCH receptor antagonists for the treatment of obesity in<br>
domestic animals (e.g., cats and dogs), and MCH receptor antagonists in other domestic animals<br>
where no disease or disorder is evident (e.g., food-oriented animals such as cows, chickens, fish, etc.).<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such compounds<br>
m such settings.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by<br>
reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with the appropriate base or acid in water, in<br>
an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate,<br>
ethanol, isopropanol, dioxane, or acetonitrile are preferred. For instance, when the compound (I)<br>
possesses an acidic functional group, it can form an inorganic salt such as an alkali metal salt (e.g.,<br>
sodium salt, potassium salt, etc.), an alkaline earth metal salt (e.g. calcium salt, magnesium salt,<br>
barium salt, etc.), and an ammonium salt. When the compound (I) possesses a basic functional group,<br>
it can form an inorganic salt (e.g., hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate, hydrobromate, etc.) or an organic<br><br>
301<br>
salt (e.g., acetate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, citrate, tartrate,<br>
etc.).<br>
Other Utilities<br>
Another object of the present invention relates to radiolabelled compounds of Formula (la)<br>
that would be useful not only in radio-imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for<br>
localizing and quantitating MCH in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying MCH<br>
ligands by inhibition binding of a radiolabetled compound. It is a further object of this invention to<br>
develop novel MCH assays of which comprise such radiolabelled compounds.<br>
Suitable radionuclides that can be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include<br>
but are not limited to 3H (also written as T), nC, I4C, 18F, 1251,82Br, I231,124I, I25I, 1311,75Br, 76Br, 15O,<br>
13N, j5S and 77Br. The radionuchde that is incorporated in the instant radiolabelled compounds will<br>
depend on the specific application of that radiolabelled compound. Thus, for in vitro MCH labeling<br>
and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 125I, I311,35S or 82Br will generally be<br>
most useful. For radio-imaging applications UC, l8F, 125I, n\ 1241,13lI,75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally<br>
be most useful.<br>
It is understood that a "radio-labelled " or "labelled compound" is a compound of Formula<br>
(la) that has incorporated at least one radionuclide; in some embodiments the radionuclide is selected<br>
from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 1251,35S and 82Br; in some embodiments the radionuclide 3H or<br>
14C. Moreover, it should be understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the<br>
invention can be either the most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the more scarce<br>
radio-isotope or nonradio-active isotope.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds including those<br>
applicable to those compounds of the invention are well known in the art and include incorporating<br>
activity levels of tritium into target molecules include: A.     Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas -<br>
This procedure normally yields high specific activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated<br>
precursors. B.    Reduction with Sodium Borohydride [ H] - This procedure is rather inexpensive and<br>
requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters,<br><br>
302<br>
and the like. C.     Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride [JH ] - This procedure offers products<br>
at almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires precursors containing reducible functional<br>
groups such as aldehydes, ketones, Iactones, esters, and the like. D.    Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling<br>
- This procedure involves exposing precursors containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the<br>
presence of a suitable catalyst. E.     N-Methylation using Methyl Iodide [3H] - This procedure is<br>
usually employed to prepare O-methyl or N-methyl (3H) products by treating appropriate precursors<br>
with high specific activity methyl iodide (JH). This method in general allows for high specific activity,<br>
such as about 80-87 Ci/mmol.<br>
Synthetic methods for incorporating activity levels of I25I into target molecules include: A.<br>
Sandmeyer and like reactions - This procedure transforms an aryl or heteroaryl amine into a<br>
diazonium salt, such as a tetrafluoroborate salt, and subsequently to 125I labelled compound using<br>
Na125I. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu, D.-G. and co-workers in J. Org. Chem. 2002,<br>
67,943-948. B. Ortho " Iodination of phenols -This procedure allows for the incorporation of !25I<br>
at the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in J. Labelled Compd<br>
Radiopharm. 1999, 42, S264-S266.   C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with l25I - This<br>
method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl<br>
bromide to the corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd catalyzed reaction [i.e.<br>
Pd(Ph3P)4] or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the presence of a tri-alkyltinhalide or<br>
hexaalkylditin [e.g., (CH3)3SnSn(CH3)3]. A represented procedure was reported by Bas, M.-D. and<br>
co-workers in J. Labelled Compd Radiopharm. 2001, 44, S280-S282.<br>
A radiolabelled MCH compound of Formula (I) can be used in a screening assay to<br>
identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test<br>
compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the "radiolabelled compound of<br>
Formula (la)" to the MCH receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the<br>
"radio-labelled compound of Formula (la)" for the binding to the MCH receptor directly correlates to<br>
its binding affinity.<br>
The labelled compounds of the present invention bind to the MCH receptor. In one<br>
embodiment the labelled compound has an IC50 less than about 500 \\M, in another embodiment the<br><br>
303<br>
labelled compound has an IC50 less than about 100 |_iM, in yet another embodiment the labelled<br>
compound has an IC50 less than about 10 (iM, in yet another embodiment the labelled compound has<br>
an IC5o less than about 1 jaM, and in still yet another embodiment the labelled inhibitor has an IC50 less<br>
than about 0.1 fiM.<br>
Preparation of Compound of Formula (I) - General synthetic methods<br>
The novel substituted quinolines, tetrahydroquinazolines, and pyrimidines of the present<br>
invention can be readily prepared according to a variety of synthetic manipulations, all of which would<br>
be familiar to one skilled in the art. Preferred methods for the preparation of compounds of the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, those described in Scheme 1-24.<br>
The common intermediate (F) of the novel substituted quinolines can be prepared as shown in<br>
Scheme 1. Commercially available 2,4-dihydroxyquinoline (A), wherein T and p is as defined above,<br>

lower alkyl alcohol solvents (preferably methanoi, ethanol, 2-propanol, or butanol, etc.), ethereal<br>
solvents (preferably tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, etc.), or amide solvents (preferably<br>
AyV-dim ethyl form amide or l-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one, etc.). Reaction temperature ranges from about<br>
0°C to 200°C, preferably about 10°C to 150°C.<br><br>
304<br>
In turn, this is substituted by the mono-protected diamine (D), wherein R3, R4, A, and B are<br>
as defined above and P is a protective group, with or without a base in an inert solvent to provide<br>
2,4-disubstituted amino quinoline (E). The base includes an alkali metal carbonate (preferably<br>
sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, etc.), an alkali metal hydroxide (preferably sodium<br>
hydroxide, etc.), or a tertiary amine (preferably A^^-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, or<br>

methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, or butanol, etc.) or amide solvents (preferably<br>
AyV-dimethylformamide or I-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one, etc.). Reaction temperature ranges from about<br>
50°C to 200°C, preferably about 80°C to 150°C. Also this reaction can be carried out under microwave<br>
conditions.<br>
Representative protecting groups suitable for a wide variety of synthetic transformations are<br>
disclosed in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, John Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons, New York, 1991, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The deprotection of the protective group leads to the common intermediate (F) of the novel substituted<br>
quinolines.<br><br>
305<br><br>
The conversion of the common intermediate (F) to the novel substituted quinolines (G-K) of<br>
the present invention is outlined in Scheme 2.<br>
The amine (F) is reacted with a carboxylic acid (R4CO2H) and a dehydrating condensing<br>
agent in an inert solvent with or without a base to provide the novei amide (G) of the present invention.<br>
The dehydrating condensing agent includes dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC),<br>

salts makes stirring difficult. The reaction was stirred vigorously for an additional 2 h at room<br>
temperature, washed with sat.-NaHCO3 (3x) and water (lx), dried with MgSO4, and concentrated<br>
to give [c«-4-[(3,5-bistrifluoromethyI-benzoylamino)-cyclohexyl]-carbamic acid tert-butyi ester<br>

transferred into a 5ml Smith synthesizer reaction vessel. The resins (0.282 mmol) were separately<br>
suspended in a 1:1 solution of IPA/H?0 (3 mL). To each suspension was added cw-l,4-diamino-<br>
cyclohexane (0.85 mmol) and DIEA (0.295ml; 1.69 mmol). The reactions were heated in a<br>
microwave synthesizer at 180°C for 4.5 hours. The resins were pooled together; and the solution<br>
removed by filtration. The resin was sequentially washed with IPA, H2O, MeOH, CH2C12, and<br>
MeOH. The washing sequence was repeated three times. The resulting resin bound intermediate<br>
was dried under vacuum for 20 minutes.<br>
The resin bound intermediate was suspended in DMF (10ml). To the resin suspension<br>
was added the 2,2- diflouro-benzo[l,3]dioxole 5-carbonyl chloride (0.94 mmol) and triethylamine<br>
(0.256 mL; 1.88 mol). The reaction was shaken in a rotary mixer at room temperature for 45<br>
minutes. The solution was removed by filtration and the resin washed sequentially with DMF,<br>
CH?C12, MeOH. The wash sequence repeated three times.<br>
After drying under vacuum for 20 minutes, the resin was treated with 15 mL of TFA<br>
solution (TFA /CH2C12 /H20 20:20:1 v/v). The reaction was shaken for 2 hours and the TFA<br>
solution was collected after filtration. The TFA was removed by rotary evaporation and the<br>
compound subjected to purification by preparative HPLC to give 2,2-difluoro-/V-(cw-4-{[5-methyl-<br>

was brought to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour. After this time, the solvent and excess<br>
DIEA was evaporated in vacuo. The resulting oil was re-dissolved in CH?C12 (30 mL) and<br>
extracted with H?O (30 mL), 1M NaOH (30 mL), and brine (30 mL). The brine layer was twice<br>
back extracted with CH2CI2 and the organic layers were combined, dried over MgSC&gt;4, and<br>
concentrated. The resulting precipitate was re-dissolved in CH2CI2 (50 mL) and TFA (4.6 mL,<br>

3,4-Difluoro-7V-[cw-4-(quinoHn-2-ylamino)-cyclohexyl]-benzamide hydrochloride<br>
Step A: Synthesis of (c/s-4-benzyloxycarbonylamino~cyC1-5hexyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester.<br>
To a suspension ofczs-cyclohexane-l,4-dicarboxylic acid (25.0 g, 145 mmol) in benzene (125<br>
mL) were added phosphorazidic acid diphenyl ester (81.9 g, 298 mmol) and triethylamine (30.1 g, 297<br>
mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 2.5 hr. Benzyl alcohol (32.2 g, 298 mmol) was<br>
added and the mixture was stirred at reflux for 24 hr. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the<br>
residue was dissolved in EtOAc and H2O. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was<br>
extracted with EtOAc (twice). The combined organic layer was washed with 1 M aqueous KHSO4,<br>
saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, concentrated, and purified by flash<br>
chromatography (silica gel, 33% EtOAc in hexane) to give (c/s-4-benzyloxycarbonylamino-<br>
cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester (52.0 g, 94%) as a colorless oil.<br>
ESI MS m/e 405, M + Na+; ]H NMR (300 MHz, CDC13) 8 7.15-7.40 (m, 10 H), 5.07 (s, 4 H),<br>
4.70-5.00 (m, 2 H), 3.52-3.80 (m, 2 H), 1.60-1.80 (m, 4 H), 1.45-1.60 (m, 4 H).<br>
Step B: Synthesis of (ctf-4-amino-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester.<br>
To a solution of (c«-4-benzyloxycarbonylamino-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid benzyl ester<br>
(91.7 g, 240 mmol) in MeOH (460 mL) was added 5% Pd/C (9.17 g). The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred at ambient temperature under hydrogen atmosphere for 2.5 days, filtered through a pad of celite,<br>
and concentrated to give a diamine as a colorless oil. To a solution of the diamine in MeOH (550 mL)<br>
was added a solution of (Boc)2O (6.59 g, 30.2 mmol) in MeOH (80 mL) dropwise over 4 hr. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1.5 days and concentrated. After dissolution<br>
with H2O, the aqueous layer was extracted with CHC13 (three times). The combined organic layer was<br>
dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give c/s-(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid<br>
ter/-butyl ester (7.78 g, 15%, crude) as a colorless oil. The aqueous layer was concentrated and the<br>
residue was dissolved in MeOH, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give a recovered<br>
diamine (32.9 g) as a colorless oil. To a solution of the recovered diamine (32.9 g, 288 mmol) in<br><br>
612<br>
MeOH (660 mL) was added a solution of (Boc)2O (6.29 g, 28.8 mmol) in MeOH (80 mL) dropwise<br>
over 5 hr. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 10 hr and concentrated. After<br>
dissolution with H2O, the aqueous layer was extracted with CHCI3 (three times). The combined<br>
organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give<br>
cw-(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid tert-buty\ ester (8.16 g, 16%, crude) as a colorless oil. The<br>
aqueous layer was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in MeOH, dried over MgSO4, filtered,<br>
and concentrated to give a recovered diamine (23.1 g) as a colorless oil. To a solution of the recovered<br>
diamine (23.1 g, 202 mmol) in MeOH (462 mL) was added a solution of (Boc)20 (4.42 g, 20.3 mmol)<br>
in MeOH (56 mL) dropwise over 4 hr. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for<br>
3.5 days and concentrated. After dissolution with H2O, the aqueous layer was extracted with CHC13<br>
(three times). The combined organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give<br>
c/5-(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (5.01 g, 10% based on starting material) as a<br>
colorless oil. The aqueous layer was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in MeOH, dried over<br>
MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give a recovered diamine (16.0 g) as a colorless oil. To a<br>
solution of the recovered diamine (16.0 g, 140 mmol) in MeOH (320 mL) was added a solution of<br>
(Boc)2O (3.06 g, 14.0 mmol) in MeOH (40 mL) dropwise over 4 hr. The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
at ambient temperature for 13 hr and concentrated. After dissolution with H2O, the aqueous layer was<br>
extracted with CHCI3 (three times). The combined organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and<br>
concentrated to give c/s-(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (3.53 g, 7% based on the<br>
starting material) as a colorless oil. The aqueous layer was concentrated and the residue was dissolved<br>

Step A: Synthesis of 2-chloro-5-methyl-pyrimidin-4-ylamine.<br>
A solution of 2,4-dichloro-5-methyI-pyrimidine (4.1 g, 0.025 mol) was dissolved in THF (30<br>
mL) and cooled with stirring on an ice bath. To the mixture was added 7 N NH3 in MeOH (14.4 mL,<br>
0.10 mol) and stirring was continued overnight (in which time the ice melted and the reaction warmed<br>
to room temperature). The excess solvent was removed in vacuo and the precipitate was suspended in<br>
CH2C12 (20 mL). The organic layer was extracted with a NaHCO3 (aq) solution (20 mL) and both<br>
layers of the extraction were filtered to collect the resulting insoluble precipitate. This precipitate was<br>
washed with cold H2O and dried to yield 2-chloro-5-methyl-pyrimidin-4-ylamine (1.0 g, 0.0070 mol,<br>

obtained in step A of example 3127 (300 mg) in DMF (3 mL) were added 4-chloro-3-fluoro-benzoic<br>
acid (252 mg), Et3N (0.42 mL), HOBt-H2O (276 mg), and EDC-HC1 (277 mg). The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 day. The reaction mixture was poured into saturated aqueous<br>
NaHCO3 and the aqueous layer was extracted with CHC13 (three times). The combined organic layer<br>
was dried over MgSOj, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by    medium-<br>
pressure liquid chromatography (NH-silica gel, 15% to 60% EtOAc in hexane). The solution of the<br>
above purified material in EtOAc (5 mL) was added 4 M hydrogen chloride in EtOAc (10 mL). The<br>
mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hr and concentrated. The residue was suspended in<br>
Et2O (20 mL) and the suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for 2 hr. The precipitate was<br>
collected by filtration, washed with Et2O, and dried at 80 °C under reduced pressure to give<br>

(although his umber can be optimized. On day 2 cells can be transfected by firstly mixing 0.25ug<br>
DNA (e.g., pC1-5V vector or pC1-5V vector comprising polynucleotide enocoding receptor) in 50 ul<br>
serum free DMEM/well and 2 ul lipofectamine in 50 ul serum-free DMEM/well. The solutions are<br>
gently mixed and incubated for 15-30 min at room temperature. Cells are washed with 0.5 ml PBS<br>
and 400 (4.1 of serum free media is mixed with the transfection media and added to the cells. The cells<br>
are then incubated for 3-4 hrs at 37°C/5%CO2 and then the transfection media is removed and<br>
replaced with lml/well of regular growth media. On day 3 the cells are labeled with 3H-myo-inositoI.<br>
Briefly, the media is removed and the cells are washed with 0.5 ml PBS. Then 0.5 ml<br>
inositol-free/serum free media (GIBCO BRJL) is added/well with 0.25 uCi of 3H-myo-inositol/ well<br>
and the cells are incubated for 16-18 hrs o/n at 37°C/5%CO2 On Day 4 the cells are washed with 0.5<br>
ml PBS and 0.45 ml of assay medium is added containing inositol-free/serum free media lOuM<br>
pargyline 10 mM lithium chloride or 0.4 ml of assay medium and 50 ul of lOx ketanserin (ket) to<br>
final concentration of lOuM. The cells are then incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The cells are then<br>
washed with 0.5 ml PBS and 200 ul of fresh/ice cold stop solution (1M KOH; 18 mM Na-borate; 3.8<br>
mMEDTA) is added/well. The solution is kept on ice for 5-10 min or until cells were lysed and then<br>
neutralized by 200 fil of fresh/ice cold neutralization sol. (7.5 % HCL). The lysate is then transferred<br>
into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes and 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2) is added/tube. The solution is<br>
vortexed for 15 sec and the upper phase is applied to a Biorad AG1-X8™ anion exchange resin<br>
(100-200 mesh). Firstly, the resin is washed with water at 1:1.25 W/V and 0.9 ml of upper phase is<br>
loaded onto the column. The column is washed with 10 mis of 5 mM myo-inositol and 10 ml of 5<br>
mM Na-borate/60mM Na-formate. The inositol tris phosphates are eluted into scintillation vials<br>
containing 10 ml of scintillation cocktail with 2 ml of 0.1 M formic acid/ 1 M ammonium formate.<br>
The columns are regenerated by washing with 10 ml of 0.1 M formic acid/3M ammonium formate<br><br>

High Throughput Functional Screening: FLIPR™<br>
Subsequently, a functional based assay was used to confirm the lead hits, referred to as<br>
FLIPR™ (the Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) and FDSS6000™ (Functional Drug Screening<br>
System). This assay utilized a non-endogenous, constitutively active version of the MCH receptor.<br>
The FLIPR and FDSS assays are able to detect intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cells,<br>
which can be utilized to assess receptor activation and determine whether a candidate compound is<br>
an, for example, antagonist, inverse agonist or agonist to a Gq-coupled receptor. The concentration<br>
of free Ca2+ in the cytosol of any cell is extremely low, whereas its concentration in the extracellular<br>
fluid and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is very high. Thus, there is a large gradient tending to drive<br>
Ca2+ into the cytosol across both the plasma membrane and ER. The FLIPR™ and FDSS6000™<br>
systems (Molecular Devices Corporation, HAMAMATSU Photonics K.K.) are designed to perform<br>
functional cell-based assays, such as the measurement of intracellular calcium for high-throughput<br>
screening. The measurement of fluorescent is associated with calcium release upon activation of the<br>
Gq-coupled receptors. Gi or Go coupled receptors are not as easily monitored through the FLIPR™<br>
and FDSS6000™ systems because these G proteins do not couple with calcium signal pathways.<br>
Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader system was used to allow for rapid, kinetic<br>
measurements of intracellular fluorescence in 96 well microplates (or 384 well microplates).<br>
Simultaneous measurements of fluorescence in all wells can be made by FLIPR or FDSS6000 M<br>
every second with high sensitivity and precision. These systems are ideal for measuring cell-based<br>
functional assays such as monitoring the intracellular calcium fluxes that occur within seconds after<br>
activation of the Gq coupled receptor.<br>
Briefly, the cells are seeded into 96 well at 5.5x10 cells/well with complete culture media<br>
(Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM<br>
sodium pyruvate and 0.5 mg/ml G418, pH 7.4) for the assay next day. On the day of assay, the media<br>
is removed and the cells are incubated with 100 p.1 of loading buffer (4 uM Fluo4-AM in complete<br><br>
798<br>
culture media containing 2.5 mMProbenicid, 0.5 mg/ml and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) in5%CO2<br>
incubator at 37°C for 1 hr. The loading buffer is removed, and the cells are washed with wash buffer<br>
(Hank's Balanced Salt Solution containing 2.5 mM Probenicid, 20 mM HEPES, 0.5 mg/ml and 0.2%<br>
bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4)). One hundred fifty fil of wash buffer containing various<br>
concentrations of test compound is added to the cells, and the cells are incubated in 5% CO?<br>
incubator at 37°C for 30 min. Fifty u.1 of wash buffer containing various concentration of MCH are<br>
added to each well, and transient changes in [Ca +]i evoked by MCH are monitored using the FLIPR<br>
or FDSS in 96 wel) plates at Ex. 488 nm and Em. 530 nm for 290 second. When antagonist activity<br>
of compound is tested, 50 nM of MCH is used.<br>
Use of FLIPR™ and FDSS6000™ can be accomplished by following manufacturer's<br>
instruction (Molecular Device Corporation and HAMAMATSU Photonics K.K.).<br>

Receptor Binding Assay<br>
In addition to the methods described herein, another means for evaluating a test compound is<br>
by determining binding affinities to the MCH receptor. This type of assay generally requires a<br>
radiolabelled ligand to the MCH receptor. Absent the use of known ligands for the MCH receptor<br>
and radiolabels thereof, compounds of Formula (I) can be labelled with a radioisotope and used in an<br>
assay for evaluating the affinity of a test compound to the MCH receptor.<br>
A radiolabelled MCH compound of Formula (I) can be used in a screening assay to<br>
identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e.,<br>
test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the "radiolabelled compound of<br>
Formula (I)" to the MCH receptor. Accordingly, the ability to compete with the "radio-labelled<br>
compound of Formula (I)" or Radiolabelled MCH Ligand for the binding to the MCH receptor<br>
directly correlates to its binding affinity of the test compound to the MCH receptor.<br>
ASSAY PROTOCOL FOR DETERMINING RECEPTOR BINDING FOR MCH:<br>
A. MCH RECEPTOR PREPARATION<br>
293 cells (human kidney, ATCC), transiently transfected with 10 ug human MCH receptor<br>
and 60 ul Lipofectamine (per 15-C1-5 dish), are grown in the dish for 24 hours (75% confluency) with<br>
a media change and removed with 10 ml/dish of Hepes-EDTA buffer (20mM Hepes + 10 mM EDTA,<br>
pH 7.4). The cells are then centrifuged in a Beckman Coulter centrifuge for 20 minutes, 17,000 rpm<br>
(JA-25.50 rotor). Subsequently, the pellet is resuspended in 20 mM Hepes + 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4<br>
and homogenized with a 50- ml Dounce homogenizer and again centrifuged. After removing the<br>
supernatant, the pellets can be stored at -80°C, until used in binding assay. When used in the assay,<br>
membranes are thawed on ice for 20 minutes and then 10 mL of incubation buffer (20 mM Hepes, 1<br>
mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) added. The membranes are then vortexed to resuspend the crude<br>
membrane pellet and homogenized with a Brinkmann PT-3100 Polytron homogenizer for 15 seconds<br>
at setting 6. The concentration of membrane protein is determined using the BRL Bradford protein<br>
assay.<br><br>
802<br>
B.	BINDING ASSAY<br>
For total binding, a total volume of 50ul of appropriately diluted membranes (diluted in<br>
assay buffer containing 50mM Tris HC1 (pH 7.4), 1 OmM MgCl2, and lmM EDTA; 5-50ug protein) is<br>
added to 96-well polyproylene microtiter plates followed by addition of 1 OOul of assay buffer and<br>
50ul of Radiolabelled MCH Ligand. For nonspecific binding, 50 ul of assay buffer is added instead<br>
of lOOul and an additional 50ul of lOuM cold MCH is added before 50ul of Radiolabelled MCH<br>
Ligand is added. Plates are then incubated at room temperature for 60-120 minutes. The binding<br>
reaction is terminated by filtering assay plates through a Microplate Devices GF/C Unifilter filtration<br>
plate with a Brandell 96-well plate harvestor followed by washing with cold 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4<br>
containing 0.9% NaCI. Then, the bottom of the filtration plate are sealed, 50 u,l of Optiphase<br>
Supermix is added to each well, the top of the plates are sealed, and plates are counted in a Trilux<br>
MicroBeta scintillation counter. For compound competition studies, instead of adding 100 }i\ of<br>
assay buffer, 100 [i\ of appropriately diluted test compound is added to appropriate wells followed by<br>
addition of 50 ul of Radiolabelled MCH Ligand.<br>
C.	CALCULATIONS<br>
The test compounds are initially assayed at 1 and 0.1 fiM and then at a range of<br>
concentrations chosen such that the middle dose would cause about 50% inhibition of a<br>
Radiolabelled MCH Ligand binding (i.e., IC50). Specific binding in the absence of test compound<br>
(Bo) is the difference of total binding (BT) minus non-specific binding (NSB) and similarly specific<br>
binding (in the presence of test compound) (B) is the difference of displacement binding (BD) minus<br>
non-specific binding (NSB). IC50 is determined from an inhibition response curve, logit-log plot<br>
of % B/Bo vs concentration of test compound.<br>
Kj is calculated by the Cheng and Prustoff transformation:<br>
K, = IC50/(l + [L]/KD)<br>
wherein [L] is the concentration of a Radiolabelled MCH Ligand used in the assay and KD<br>
is the dissociation constant of a Radiolabelled MCH Ligand determined independently under the<br><br>
803<br>
same binding conditions.<br>
