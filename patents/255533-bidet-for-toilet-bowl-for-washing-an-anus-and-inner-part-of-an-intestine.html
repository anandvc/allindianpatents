The water ejected through one of the water outlet ports 14j is sprayed through the main wash bidet part 15 or the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 that remains in communication with the water outlet ports 14j. Also, the water may be supplied to an external device such as a shower device S or the like via the water outlet pipes 16 of the main body 10. The main body 10 serves to spray the water from the rear bottom side of the user to thereby wash an anus or other bodily parts, whereas the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 acts to perform in-body wash through the use of an antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 that can be inserted into an intestine or a vagina of the user. Such a configuration is applied to all of the embodiments set forth below.<br>
In this regard, the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 is normally positioned below the main body 10 and, when in use, is moved to the center of the toilet bowl. To this end, the position adjustor 50 or 60 mounted on the main body 10 is configured to rotate or displace the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 in a front-rear direction. Moreover, the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 is so combined as to swing within a given extent with respect to the position adjustor 50 or 60, thus allowing the user to adjust the angle of the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40.<br>
The position adjustor 50 or 60 will now be specifically described in the following. FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing a bidet device for toilet bowls in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a first position adjustor, one of major elements of the bidet device in accordance with the first embodiment. FIG. 8 is a perspective view showing a bidet device for toilet bowls in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a second position adjustor, one of major elements of the bidet device in accordance with the second embodiment.<br>
According to the bidet device for toilet bowls of a first embodiment of the present invention, the in-body wash bidet part 30 is provided in a single number at a position spaced apart from the main body 10 by a predetermined distance. The position adjustor 50 mounted on the main body 10 is connected to the in-body wash bidet part 30 so that it can<br><br><br>
displace the in-body wash bidet part 30 in a front-rear direction or rotate the same within a given extent. Furthermore, the position adjustor 50 allows the water to be supplied to the in-body wash bidet part 30 therethrough. The in-body wash bidet part 30 is so combined as to swing within a prescribed extent with respect to the position adjustor 50.<br>
The bidet device for toilet bowls of a second embodiment of the present invention has the same configuration as that of the first embodiment noted above, except that the in-body wash bidet part and the position adjustor are respectively provided in dual numbers.<br>
In other words, according to the bidet device for toilet bowls of the second embodiment, the in-body wash bidet part includes a first in-body wash bidet part 30 having an antimicrobial silicon hose 32 for insertion into one of an intestine or a vagina of the user, a second in-body wash bidet part 40 having an antimicrobial silicon hose 42 for insertion into the other of the intestine or the vagina, a first position adjustor 50 for adjusting the position of the first in-body wash bidet part 30, and a second position adjustor 60 for adjusting the position of the second in-body wash bidet part 40.<br>
The first position adjustor 50 includes a support member 51 rotatably supporting a bidet body 31 with an antimicrobial silicon hose 32 and having an internally arranged water guide pipe 52, a cylinder 53 rotatably attached to the main body 10, a piston member 54 positioned inside the cylinder 53 and coupled to the support member 51 for forward and backward movement under the action of a water pressure, a spring member 55 insertedly fitted to the piston member 54 for returning the piston member 54 into an initial position when the water pressure is weakened, and a cylinder cap 56 coupled to a rear end of the cylinder 53 and having a water inlet port.<br>
The second position adjustor 60 has a multiple-stage telescopic structure such that the second in-body wash bidet part 40 can be positioned more frontward than the first in-body wash bidet part 30. The second position adjustor 60 includes a support member 61 rotatably supporting a bidet body 41 with an antimicrobial silicon hose 42 and having an internally arranged water guide pipe 62, a cylinder 63 rotatably attached to the main body 10, a piston cylinder 64 positioned inside the cylinder 63 for forward and backward movement under the action of a water pressure, a piston member 65 positioned inside the piston cylinder 64 and coupled to the support member 61 for forward and backward movement under the action of the water pressure, spring members 66 insertedly fitted to the piston cylinder 64 and the piston member 65 for returning the piston cylinder 64 and the piston member 65 into initial positions when the water pressure is weakened, and a cylinder cap 67 coupled to a rear end of the cylinder 63 and having a water inlet port.<br><br><br>
According to the bidet devices for toilet bowls of the first and second embodiments of the present invention as configured above, the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 can be located at the center of the toilet bowl with a desired angle in the event that the water is supplied to the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40.<br>
As the water is supplied from the water ejection regulator part 14 to the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40, the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 is moved forward, in which condition the user can rotate the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 into a proper position. This makes it possible for the user to bring the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 at the center of the toilet bowl. In addition, the user can rotate the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 with respect to the position adjustor 50 or 60 into a desired angular position.<br>
The first in-body wash bidet part 30 positioned at the rear side in the drawings can be displaced forward or backward or can be rotated by means of the first position adjustor 50. In order for the water to reach the first in-body wash bidet part 30, the water is first supplied into the cylinder 53 to thereby move the piston member 54 forward, in response to which the first in-body wash bidet part 30 is caused to move forward to the center of the toilet bowl. At this moment, the first in-body wash bidet part 30 can be rotated by the user because the cylinder 53 remains rotatably mounted on the main body 10. Under the condition that the position of the first in-body wash bidet part 30 is decided in this manner, the user can swing the first in-body wash bidet part 30 with a desired angle, thereby determining the installation angle of the first in-body wash bidet part 30.<br>
Under this state, the water introduced into the cylinder 53 is supplied to the interior of the first in-body wash bidet part 30 via the piston member 54 and the water guide pipe 52 of the support member 51. Subsequently, the water is sprayed into the intestine or the vagina through the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 of the first in-body wash bidet part 30 that has been extended outwardly and inserted into the intestine or the vagina, thus performing in-body wash operation.<br>
The second in-body wash bidet part 40 positioned at the front side in the drawings can be displaced forward or backward or can be rotated by means of the second position adjustor 60. In order for the water to reach the second in-body wash bidet part 40, the water is first supplied into the cylinder 63 to thereby move forward the piston cylinder 64 and the piston member 65 one after another, in response to which the second in-body wash bidet part 40 is caused to move forward to the center of the toilet bowl.<br>
At this moment, the second in-body wash bidet part 40 can be rotated by the user because the cylinder 63 remains rotatably mounted on the main body  10.    Under the<br><br><br>
condition that the position of the second in-body wash bidet part 40 is decided in this manner, the user can swing the second in-body wash bidet part 40 with a desired angle, thereby determining the installation angle of the second in-body wash bidet part 40. The first in-body wash bidet part 30 and the second in-body wash bidet part 40 are opposed to each other about the main wash bidet part 15 and, therefore, are rotated in the opposite directions.<br>
At the time when the water is stopped from supplying to the first in-body wash bidet part 30 or the second in-body wash bidet part 40, they are returned to the initial positions under the action of the spring members 55 and 66 retained on the piston members 54 and 65 and the piston cylinder 64. Then, the user can rotate the first in-body wash bidet part 30 and the second in-body wash bidet part 40 to conceal them under the main body 10, meaning that the bidet device can be normally used as a typical purpose without having to expose the first in-body wash bidet part 30 or the second in-body wash bidet part 40.<br>
Accordingly, the user can bring the first in-body wash bidet part 30 or the second in-body wash bidet part 40 into a desired position and can adjust the angle thereof under that condition, which is very important in improving the convenience in use.<br>
In this connection, the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 may have three types of structures as set forth below.<br>
FIG. 10 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a first example of an in-body wash bidet part, one of major elements of the present invention. FIG. 11 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a second example of the in-body wash bidet part, one of major elements of the present invention. FIG. 12 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a third example of the in-body wash bidet part, one of major elements of the present invention.<br>
A first example of the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 employed in the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention includes a bidet body 31 or 41 spaced apart from the main body 10 by a predetermined interval and supplied with the water through the position adjustor 50 or 60, an antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 extendible from the bidet body 31 or 41 for insertion into the intestine or the vagina, a water ejection mouth cap 33 or 43 coupled to a tip end of the bidet body 31 or 41, through a sealing member 39 or 49 inserted around the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42, for supporting the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 on the bidet body 31 or 41, a stopper member 34 or 44 fixed to a base end of the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 for preventing removal of the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 from the water ejection mouth cap 33 or 43, and a fixture ring 37 or 47 fitted to the stopper member 34 or 44 from around the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 for retaining the stopper member 34 or 44 in place.<br><br><br>
The in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 may further include a bidet cap 35 or 45 coupled to the tip end of the bidet body 31 or 41 for concealing the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 against exposure to the outside.<br>
In the in-body wash bidet part configured as above, the antimicrobial silicon hose can be extended from the bidet body and then inserted into the intestine or the vagina for conducting in-body wash with the water supplied.<br>
When extended, the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 is prevented from removal by means of the stopper member 34 or 44 and the water ejection mouth cap 33 or 43. The antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 can also be prevented from exposure to the outside by coupling the bidet cap 35 or 45 to the bidet body 31 or 41.<br>
A second example of the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 employed in the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention is substantially the same as the first example noted above, except that a spring 36 or 46 is insertedly fitted around the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42.<br>
The spring 36 or 46 fitted around the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 is retained in place by the stopper member 34 or 44 and serves to return the antimicrobial silicon hose 32 or 42 into an initial position when the water is not supplied.<br>
The in-body wash bidet part may also be configured into a vibration type as a third example. The vibration type in-body wash bidet part 30' includes a bidet body 31' spaced apart from the main body 10 by a predetermined interval and supplied with the water through the position adjustor 50, a vibrator enclosure 37' threadedly engaged with a bottom end of the bidet body 31' and having a vibrator 37" enclosed within the vibrator enclosure 37', a spring 38" provided below the vibrator 37" for absorbing the vibration of the vibrator 37", a vibratory penetrator 38 protruding from the bidet body 31' for insertion into an intestine or a vagina and spraying the water undulated by the vibratory motion of the vibrator 37", a water ejection mouth cap 33' insertedly fitted around the vibratory penetrator 38 and coupled to the bidet body 31' for supporting the vibratory penetrator 38, and a connector member 39' provided on a top end of the vibrator 37" for transmitting the vibration to the vibratory penetrator 38.<br>
In this regard, the vibratory penetrator 38 includes an antimicrobial silicon hose 32' extending from the bidet body 32' and having a protrusion 32" at a tip end, a vibration bar 38' placed within the antimicrobial silicon hose 32' and coupled at a base end to the connector member 39' for causing undulatory motion to the water, and a support member 34' coupled to the bidet body 31' and engaged with the protrusion 32" for inhibiting the<br><br><br>
antimicrobial silicon hose 32' from falling into the bidet body 31'.<br>
The vibratory penetrator 38 is detachably attached to the bidet body 31'. There is further provided a bidet cap 35' that can be coupled to the bidet body 31' when the vibratory penetrator 38 is detached from the bidet body 31'.<br>
The vibration-type in-body wash bidet part configured as above can initialize the bond of water molecules and thus can provide improved water purification effect by causing undulatory motion to the water through the use of vibration of the vibrator.<br>
The vibration generated in the vibrator 37" is transmitted to the vibration bar 38' via the connector member 39' and the vibration bar 38' is vibrated within the antimicrobial silicon hose 32' to cause undulatory motion to the water. This normalizes the abnormal bond of water molecules that stems from contamination of the water or other causes, thereby improving the cleansing effect of the water sprayed into the intestine or the vagina.<br>
In the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention, the position of the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 can be decided manually or automatically.<br>
FIG. 13 is a perspective view showing a bidet device for toilet bowls in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 14 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a first rotation means, one of major elements of the bidet device in accordance with the third embodiment. FIG. 15 is a perspective view showing a bidet device for toilet bowls in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 16 an exploded perspective view illustrating a second rotation means, one of major elements of the bidet device in accordance with the fourth embodiment.<br>
Specifically, the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention may include a rotation means 80 or 90 for concealing the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 under the main body 10 or taking out the same to the outside.<br>
The rotation means 80 or 90 may be a manual type in which the user directly adjusts the position of the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 by use of a handle 81 or 91, an automatic type in which the position of the in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 is automatically adjusted in response to the supply of the water, or the combination type in which the manual type and the automatic type are used in common. Description will be given to the combination type in the present embodiment.<br>
The in-body wash bidet part 30 or 40 includes a first in-body wash bidet part 30 whose antimicrobial silicon hose can be inserted into one of the intestine and the vagina and a second in-body wash bidet part 40 whose antimicrobial silicon hose can be inserted into the other of the intestine and the vagina.    The bidet device for toilet bowls includes a first<br><br><br>
rotation means 80 for rotating the second in-body wash bidet part 40 and a second rotation means 90 for rotating the first in-body wash bidet part 30.<br>
The first rotation means 80 includes a water guide pipeline 83 hingedly secured to the second in-body wash bidet part 40 for supplying the water to the second in-body wash bidet part 40 with an antimicrobial silicon hose, a distributor pipe 82 communicating with the water guide pipeline 83 and connected to the handle 81 for forward and backward movement, and a piston member 85 positioned inside a cylinder 84, which in turn is affixed to the main body 10, and adapted to move forward and backward by the water supplied to the distributor pipe 82 through a water inlet pipe 86, to thereby displace the distributor pipe 82.<br>
The second rotation means 90 includes a water guide pipeline 93 hingedly secured to the first in-body wash bidet part 30 for supplying the water to the first in-body wash bidet part 30 with an antimicrobial silicon hose, a distributor pipe 92 having a water inlet port and remaining coupled with the water guide pipeline 93, a piston member 95 adapted to move forward and backward within a cylinder 94, a piston cap 96 coupled to the piston member 95 and kept in communication with the distributor pipe 92, and a rod 97 interconnecting the cylinder 94 and the handle 91.<br>

In the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention configured as above, the in-body wash bidet part can be manually operated using the handle to decide the position thereof or can be automatically operated as the water is supplied.<br>
If the handle 81 or 91 is moved forward or backward, the first in-body wash bidet part 30 or the second in-body wash bidet part 40 coupled to the end portion of the water guide pipeline 83 or 93 is rotated and moved toward the center of the toilet bowl under the action of the water guide pipeline 83 or 93 hingedly affixed to the main body 10. At this moment, even though the handle 81 or 91 is not operated, the water supplied to the cylinder 84 or 94 through the distributor pipe 82 or 92 causes the piston member 85 or 95 to move forward, thus rotating the first in-body wash bidet part 30 or the second in-body wash bidet part 40. In case of the water supply being interrupted, the piston member 85 or 95 is retracted by the spring to thereby bring the first in-body wash bidet part 30 or the second in-body wash bidet part 40 into the initial position.<br>
Depending on the manner in which the in-body wash bidet part is caused to move, the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention may take many different forms.<br><br><br>

In the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention configured as above, the<br><br><br>
in-body wash bidet part can be moved in a front-rear direction or a left-right direction and also can be rotated by operating the handgrip.<br>
More specifically, the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105 is normally placed under the main body 10 and can be moved toward the center of the toilet bowl by displacing the guide block 113 along the guide groove 112 through the use of the handgrip 111. The position of the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105 is decided by displacing the handgrip 111 in the left-right direction along the slot 114 of the guide block 113. Subsequently, the handgrip 111 is grasped and rotated about the slot 114 of the guide block 113 to thereby adjust the installation angle of the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105 within a predetermined extent. Under this condition, the water is supplied to the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105 through the water guide pipe 117 of the handgrip, thus cleansing the intestine or the vagina.<br>
Accordingly, the user can directly adjust the position and angle of the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105 for the sake of in-body wash, which enhances the convenience in use. As in the foregoing embodiment, there may be further provided a cylinder member (not shown) that can displace the guide block 113 forward and backward along the guide groove 112 at the time when the water is supplied to the first in-body wash bidet part 100 or the second in-body wash bidet part 105. This makes sure that, even though the guide block 113 is not manually displaced by use of the handgrip 111, the guide block 113 is automatically moved in response to the supply of the water, thereby bringing the first in-body wash bidet part 100 or the second in-body wash bidet part 105 to the center of the toilet bowl. In a nutshell, it is possible for the position adjuster 110 to employ one of the three types, namely, the manual type using only the handgrip 111, the automatic type using only the cylinder member and the combination type incorporating the manual type and the automatic type.<br>
FIG. 20 is a perspective view showing a bidet device for toilet bowls in accordance with a seventh embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 21 is a perspective view showing a bidet device for toilet bowls in accordance with an eighth embodiment of the present invention.<br>

In the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention configured as above, the in-body wash bidet part can be rectilinearly moved along the main body and then rotated through the use of the handgrip part to decide the position of the in-body wash bidet part.<br>
In other words, if the handgrip part 120 is displaced along the main body 10, it makes rectilinear movement with the aid of the guide cap 124 coupled to the guide block 126. Subsequently, if the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105 is grasped and rotated, the rotation portion 122 is caused to rotate about the connector portion 123 of the handgrip part 120. At this time, the guide block 126 is rotated together with the rotation portion 122 and is restrained from any excessive rotation by means of the first stopper 127 and the second stopper 128.<br>
Accordingly, the user can directly adjust the position and angle of the in-body wash bidet part 100 or 105, which enhances the convenience in use. Furthermore, there may be further provided a cylinder member (not shown) that can displace the handgrip part 120 forward and backward at the time when the water is supplied to the first in-body wash bidet part 100 or the second in-body wash bidet part 105. This makes sure that, even though the handgrip part 120 is not manually operated, the handgrip part 120 is automatically moved forward and backward. In a nutshell, it is possible to employ one of the three types, namely, the manual type manually operating the handgrip part 120, the automatic type using only the cylinder member and the combination type incorporating the manual type and the automatic type.<br><br><br>
Moreover, the in-body wash bidet part includes a first in-body wash bidet part 100 positioned at one side of the main wash bidet part 15 and a second in-body wash bidet part 105 lying in an opposing relationship with the first in-body wash bidet part 100. The water may be selectively supplied to one of the first in-body wash bidet part 100 and the second in-body wash bidet part 105. The handgrip part 120 for operating the first in-body wash bidet part 100 is substantially the same in configuration and operation as that of the second in-body wash bidet part 105, except for the length and shape of the linear motion portion 121 which varies due to the difference in distance.<br>

According to the ninth embodiment of the present invention, a bidet device for toilet bowls includes a main body 10 mounted on a rear side of a toilet bowl and having a control part C at one side, the main body 10 provided with two extension portions 18 protruding frontward a predetermined extent along side portions of the toilet bowl, fixing members 19 provided at a terminal end of each of the extension portions 18 of the main body 10 for affixing the extension portions 18 to the toilet bowl, a main wash bidet part 15 provided below a center protrusion 11 of the main body 10 for spraying water to cleanse posterior areas of a user, at least one in-body wash bidet part 100 attached to the main body 10 for cleansing one of an intestine and a vagina, and a position adjuster 130 for adjusting the position of the in-body wash bidet part 100.<br>
The position adjustor 130 includes a handgrip 131 mounted on the extension portions 18 of the main body 10 across the toilet bowl and having a water guide passage formed inside the handgrip 131, a pair of guide blocks 133 movable forward and backward along guide grooves 132 respectively formed on the extension portions 18, the handgrip 131 adapted to pass through the guide blocks 133, and a pair of cylinder members for displacing the guide blocks 133 forward and backward depending on the supply of water.<br>
Each of the cylinder members includes a cylinder 134 provided at a rear side of each<br><br><br>
of the extension portions 18 of the main body 10, a piston 135 fitted into the cylinder 134 and coupled at a tip end to each of the guide blocks 133, a spring 136 insertedly fitted to around the piston 135 for displacing the piston 135 backward and returning each of the guide blocks 133 into an initial position at the time when the water supply is cut off, and a cylinder cap 137 threadedly coupled to a rear end of the cylinder 134 and having a water inlet port and a water outlet port.<br>
The cylinder caps 137 of the respective cylinder members are connected to each other by means of a water guide pipe 138 and are provided with check valves 140 at a water inlet port and a water outlet port. Each of the check valves 140 includes a support member 141 threadedly coupled to each of the water inlet port and the water outlet port of the cylinder caps 137 and having a bore formed at a center of the support member 141, a blocking plate 142 for closing off the bore of the support member 141 to interrupt the flow of water, the blocking plate 142 having an outer diameter smaller than that of the water inlet port and the water outlet port, a pair of guide bars 144 formed on the blocking plate 142 and inserted into guide holes 141' of the support member 141, each of the guide bars 144 having a tip end bent in such a manner as to prevent removal from the support member 141, and a spring 143 retained between the support member 141 and the blocking plate 142.<br>
The handgrip 131 is curved such that the in-body wash bidet part 100 can be placed a predetermined distance below a top end of the toilet bowl and has opposite straight portions of a predetermined length extending through the guide blocks 133 for movement in a left-right direction.<br>
In the bidet device for toilet bowls of the present invention configured as above, the in-body wash bidet part can be moved in a forward-backward direction and a left-right direction by use of the handgrip and also can be rotated into a given angular position to thereby adjust the installation angle thereof.<br>
If the guide blocks 133 are moved forward and backward by grasping the handgrip 131, it is possible to place the in-body wash bidet part 100 either below the main body 10 or at the center of the toilet bowl. Furthermore, the installation angle of the in-body wash bidet part 100 can be adjusted by rotating the handgrip 131. The in-body wash bidet part 100 can also be moved in the left-right direction by pulling or pushing the handgrip 131 in a longitudinal direction. At this time, the amount of left-right movement of the in-body wash bidet part 100 is limited by the length of the straight portions of the handgrip 131 and the size of the guide blocks 133.<br>
Instead of displacing the guide blocks 133 forward and backward by use of the<br><br><br>
handgrip 131, the position of the in-body wash bidet part 100 may be set by allowing the guide blocks 133 to be moved under the pressure of the water supplied to the cylinder members.<br>
The water introduced into the cylinder 134 can displace the piston 135 and hence the guide blocks 133 forward. If the water supply is interrupted, the piston 135 and the guide blocks 133 are moved backward by means of the spring 136, thereby placing the in-body wash bidet part 100 under the main body 10. In this process, the water in the cylinder 134 is slowly drained under the action of resilient force of the spring 136 and does not flow backward due to the presence of the check valves 140.<br>
In the meantime, at least one of the water ejection pipes 16 of the main body 10 may be closed by the water ejection pipe cap 17 when not in use or may be used to supply the water to a shower device S or other external devices. This is applied to all of the embodiments as well as the present embodiment.<br>
The bidet device for toilet bowls of the tenth embodiment is substantially the same as that of the ninth embodiment set forth above but differs in the following aspects. The in-body wash bidet part includes a first in-body wash bidet part 100 and a second in-body wash bidet part 105 symmetrically spaced apart from each other about the main wash bidet part 15. The water guide passage is also provided in dual numbers, one of which communicates with the first in-body wash bidet part 100 and the other of which is in communication with the second in-body wash bidet part 105.<br>
No description will be given in this respect because the bidet device for toilet bowls of the tenth embodiment is the same as that of the ninth embodiment except for the number of the in-body wash bidet part employed.<br>
The bidet device for toilet bowls of the eleventh embodiment is substantially the same as that of the ninth and tenth embodiments set forth above, except that the main wash bidet part is provided on the handgrip and not on the main body. In other words, the main wash bidet part 106 is provided between the first in-body wash bidet part 100 and the second in-body wash bidet part 105. The handgrip 131 has three water guide passages respectively communicating with the main wash bidet part 106, the first in-body wash bidet part 100 and the second in-body wash bidet part 105.<br>
The bidet device for toilet bowls may further include a front bidet part 106' positioned at a front side of the toilet bowl and affixed in place by means of a fixing member 107 for spraying the water supplied through a connector hose 108.<br>
In this regard, each of the main wash bidet part 106 and the front bidet part 106'<br><br><br>
includes a nozzle 106a for spraying the water, a cylinder 106b having an internally formed guide groove, a piston 106c fitted for communication with the nozzle 106a and movable within the cylinder 106b in a front-rear direction, the piston 106c having a protrusion 106f inserted into the guide groove of the cylinder 106b, a spring 106d fitted to around the piston 106c for returning the piston 106c to an initial position, and a cylinder cap 106e coupled to the cylinder 106b and having a water inlet port.<br>
The bidet device for toilet bowls of the eleventh embodiment provides substantially the same effect as provided by that of the ninth embodiment. In addition, it is possible for the user to freely adjust the position of the main wash bidet part 106. The front bidet part 106' provides increased convenience to a female user.<br>
If the water is supplied to the main wash bidet part 106 or the front bidet part 106', the piston 106c within the cylinder 106b fixedly secured to the handgrip 131 or the toilet bowl is caused to move forward, thus pushing the nozzle 106a in a downward direction of the toilet bowl. This enables the nozzle 106a to spray the water and perform the bidet wash function at a position lower than the initial position. At this time, the piston 106c moves rectilinearly due to the presence of the protrusion 106f received in the guide groove, thus precluding the possibility that the nozzle 106a is rotated.<br>
If the water supply is interrupted, the piston 106c is moved backward by means of the spring 106d. This makes it possible to reduce the volume of the main wash bidet part 106 and the front bidet part 106' while not in use.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described in respect of preferred embodiments, this is not intended to limit the scope of the invention by no means. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.<br>
