FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of genetic vaccinations and<br>
particularly to genetic immunotherapy and/or immunoprophylaxis of prostate cancer.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides a genetic construct capable of<br>
stimulating a selective immune response to prostate cells including prostate cancer cells.<br>
The present invention also provides, inter alia, compositions for the immunotherapy<br>
and/or immunoprophylaxis of prostate cancer, antibodies thereto and diagnostic<br>
reagents therefor and methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of prostate cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bibliographic details of the publications referred to by author in this specification are<br>
collected at the end of the description.<br>
Reference to any prior art in the specification is not, and should not be taken as, an<br>
acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common<br>
general knowledge in any country.<br>
Advances in molecular biology and informatics in the last decade have greatly enhanced<br>
our broad understanding, and potential to gain a greater understanding, of biological<br>
events and have created enormous potential for pharmaceutical and related industries to<br>
develop strategies for the prevention and treatment of diseases and other disorders. A<br>
particularly important problem relates to the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer<br>
and other prostate related diseases or conditions.<br>
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in males. Prostate<br>
cancer is only potentially curable when it is confined to the prostate gland using one of<br>
two local modalities of treatment: surgery (radical prostatectomy) or radical<br><br>
radiotherapy (external beam or brachytherapy). However, approximately 40% of men<br>
who have had apparently curative treatment for localised disease will subsequently<br>
develop metastatic disease. About 70% of men have metastases at some time during the<br>
course of their disease.<br>
For men with metastatic disease, medical or surgical castration often produces a<br>
remission but inevitably lethal androgen-resistant disease supervenes that is relatively<br>
resistant to chemotherapy, as reviewed in Logothetis, C.J. et al, Semin. Oncol. 21:620,<br>
1994. Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable and the terminal hormone-refractory phase<br>
of the disease is least responsive to any kind of treatment.<br>
Surgical castration is achieved through the operation of bilateral orchidectomy and its<br>
therapeutic effects are approximately equivalent to complete androgen blockade using a<br>
combination of a LHRH agonist/antagonist and an anti-androgen drug (Santen R.J., J<br>
Clin. Endocrinal Metab. 75:685-689, 1992; Thenot, S. et al, Mol. Cell Endocrinol.<br>
156:85-93, 1999). Depending upon the operator, either procedure may be associated<br>
with considerable morbidity with incontinence and impotence rates in some series that<br>
approach 50%. About 70-80% of men with metastatic disease respond to either kind of<br>
hormonal treatment and are palliated effectively for a median duration of approximately<br>
two and a half years. Hormonal treatments have side effects of their own, which<br>
include lethargy, weakness and cognitive impairment. In time, "androgen-independent"<br>
growth of the cancer supervenes, which is usually fatal {Thenot S. et al, supra). This<br>
hormone-resistant phase of the disease has a median survival of 40-50 weeks.<br>
Combination chemotherapy may produce clinical benefit in approximately 25% of cases<br>
but without prolongation of survival.<br>
There is some evidence that cancer patients make spontaneous albeit ineffective<br>
immune responses to their own cancers {Lee, P.P. et a!., Nature Medicine 5(6):677-685,<br>
1999; Albert, M. L, et al, Nature Medicine 4:1321-1324, 1998). Most of these<br>
immune responses are made against normal components of the tissue from which the<br>
cancer originates, and are known as differentiation antigens. This has been well<br><br>
demonstrated for melanocyte differentiation antigens, which comprise the major class of<br>
defined melanoma tumor antigens (Rosenberg, S.A. et al, Immunity 10:281-287, 1999),<br>
Moreover, melanocyte differentiation antigens have been defined as tumor rejection<br>
antigens by the adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes<br>
(Rosenberg, S.A. et al, J Am MedAssoc 271:903. 1994).<br>
In prostate cancer, on the other hand, the evidence that prostate differentiation antigens<br>
are recognized by t! e immune system of cancer patients is limited. In particular, none<br>
of these antigens has been defined as a tumor rejection antigen. However, T cell<br>
proliferative responses to human prostate specific antigen (hPSA) and human prostatic<br>
acid phosphatase (hPAP) were detected in 6% and 11% of prostate cancer patients,<br>
respectively, together with human PAP-specific production of the T helper cytokine,<br>
interferon-y. These findings suggest that an immune environment, which can support<br>
PAP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, may exist in prostate cancer patients (McNeel<br>
D.G. et al, Cancer Research 61:5161-5167, 2001). Further evidence in support of pre-<br>
existing immunity to human PAP, which is T helper cell-dependent, is the discovery of<br>
human PAP-specific antibodies in approximately 5% of prostate cancer patients and<br>
male controls (McNeel D.G. et al, J. Urinol. 164(5):1825-1839, 2000). Further<br>
investigations identified a number of T helper epitopes, which may represent naturally<br>
processed human PAP-specific MHC class II epitopes (McNeel et al, 2001, supra).<br>
Moreover, antitumor responses were observed in prostate cancer patients who were<br>
immunized with dendritic cells loaded either with human prostatic acid phosphatase<br>
(hPAP) (Peshwa, M.V. et al, Prostate 36:129-138, 1998) or a peptide derived from<br>
human prostate specific membrane antigen (hPSMA) (Lodge, P.A. et al, Cancer<br>
Research 60:829-833, 2000; Murphy et al, Prostate 38:73-78, 1999(a); Murphy G.P. et<br>
al, Prostate 39:54-59, 1999(b)).<br>
Considerable effort has consequently been expended in developing therapeutic<br>
strategies targeting prostate specific antigens, the most well characterised of these<br>
antigens being PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), PSMA (Prostate Specific Membrane<br>
Antigen) and PAP (Prostatic Acid Phosphatase). Prostate cancer is an attractive<br><br>
candidate for immunotherapy because tumors grow slowly and patients have generally<br>
been spared immunosuppressive doses of chemoradiotherapy. Fong el al, in particular,<br>
have shown anti-PAP T cell proliferative responses in human subjects administered<br>
with antigen loaded dendritic cells. Dendritic cells were enriched from peripheral blood<br>
mononuclear cells and loaded with mouse PAP to provide xencgeneic stimulation of the<br>
immune response {Fong, L. et al, J Immunol 167:7150-7156, 2001).<br>
There is a need, however, for an efficacious, specific and safe immunotherapeutic<br>
and/or immunoprophyiactic strategy for the treatment or prevention of prostate cancer.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the inventor has developed such a strategy<br>
based on genetic vaccination with a recombinant poxvirus construct expressing a<br>
prostate specific polypepu'de such as prostatic acid phosphatase preferably together with<br>
a immunostimulatory molecule, for example, an immunosttmulatory cytokine such as,<br>
in particular, IL-2.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a photographic representation of elecirophoreticaily resolved PCR-fragments.<br>
VIR501 and VIR502 were subjected to PCR to test for correct gene insertion. PCR<br>
amplifications using human PAP, rat PAP and human IL-2 specific primers for the<br>
detection of human IL-2 and rat PAP insertion into YIR501 and human IL-2 and human<br>
PAP insertion in VIR502. Negative control experiments where carried out using water<br>
instead of DNA template.<br>
Figure 2 is a photographic representation of ELISA wells showing the results of tests for<br>
secretion of human IL-2 by VIR501 and VIR502. After three rounds of plaque purification<br>
a number of plaque clones were amplified by infecting CEF cells. After infection, a small<br>
sample of culture medium was removed and tested for the presence of human IL-2 using a<br>
human IL-2-ELISA kit. A visible colour change indicates the presence of IL-2 in the test<br>
sample.<br>
Figure 3 is a photographic representation of a Western Blot showing FPV-mediated<br>
expression of human PAP. TK'143B cells were infected with FPV vectors at MOI of 10<br>
and the cells harvested for immunoblot analysis 48h and 72h post-infection (p.i.). FPV-HA<br>
was used as a negative vector control. The lack of cross-reactivity of the anti-human PAP<br>
polyclonal antibody was demonstrated by the absence of a band for recombinant rat PAP.<br>
The negative control for the method of detection was probing of the immunoblot with the<br>
secondary antibody alone. 1, FPV-HA; 2, VIR501 (48h p.i.); 3, VIR502 (48h p.i.); 4,<br>

Figure 4 is a graphical representation of results of ELISA showing immunogenicity of<br>
FPV expressing human PAP. Three NZ White rabbits were immunised by intramuscular<br>
injection with 2xlO8 plaque forming units (PFU) each of empty vector control, FPV-M3, or<br>
VIR501 (FPV encoding rat PAP and human IL-2) or VIR502 (FPV encoding human PAP<br><br>
and human IL-2). The animals were boosted according to the same schedule three weeks<br>
after the priming immunisation. Two weeks after the boost immunisation the animals were<br>
bled again. Reactivities of the immune sera were tested against bacterial recombinant<br>
proteins that were made in the pQE system: A. human PAP, or B. rat PAP. Shown are<br>
dilution curves for pre-immune sera (light-grey dashed line); po?t-immune sera, three<br>
weeks after priming immunisation (medium grey line with filled triangles); post-immune<br>
sera, two weeks after boost immunisation (thick black line with filled diamonds). Negative<br>
controls included plates coated with irrelevant pQE-derived proteins, human La/SS-B<br>
autoantigen or staphylococcal exotoxin B (SEB) for which OD (at 405nm) values 
were obtained (data not shown).<br>

and human IL-2) [upper panels] or 3x10* PFU of VIR502 (FPV encoding human PAP and<br>
human IL-2) flower panels]. Four weeks after immunisation, sera were collected for<br>
ELISA. The reactivity of the immune sera was tested against recombinant proteins that<br>
were made either in the pQE bacterial expression system: A. human PAP, B. rat PAP, or<br>
. the InsectSelect expression system: C. rat PAP (upper panel) or human PAP (lower panel).<br>
Shown are dilution curves for pre-immune sera (light-grey dashed line) and post-immune<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present, invention is predicated, in part, on the determination that a genetic vaccine<br>
construct based on a live poxviral vector which incorporates and expresses in a cell of a<br>
subject a sequence of nuclcotides encoding a polypeptide which is normally only<br>
expressed on or near the surface of prostate cells, preferably together with an<br>
immunostimulntory polypeptide, is capable of selectively inducing immune prostatitis<br>
in a subject,<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides inter alia a genetic vaccine and methods for<br>
treating or preventing prostate related diseases or conditions such as prostate cancer.<br>
Without being limited by any particular theory or mode of operation, by using a<br>
poxviral vector which does not productively infect the subject, the risk of an on-going<br>
viral infection and/or expression of prostate specific polypeptide in a wide range of<br>
possibly inappropriate cells is minimised. Furthermore, by using a prostate specific<br>
polypeptide which exhibits a low level of similarity to other polypeptides in the subject,<br>
the risk of generating an inappropriate immune response is also reduced.<br>
Accordingly one aspect of the present invention contemplates a genetic vaccine<br>
construct comprising a poxvirus vector which incorporates and, on administration to a<br>
subject, expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a<br>
prostate-specific polypeptide, or a homologue or derivative or analogue thereof, wherein<br>
said poxvirus vector does not productively infect said subject and wherein expression<br>
products of said genetic vaccine construct stimulate a prostate cell specific immune<br>
response.<br>
By "genetic vaccine construct" is meant a composition comprising a recombinant<br>
nucleic acid molecule which, for the purpose of immunisation is administered to a<br>
subject in whom one or more antigenic polypeptides, encoded by at least a part of said<br>
nucleic acid molecule, are expressed.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invem;on, the poxvirus vector does noi "productively<br>
infect" the subject. The phrase "does not productively infect" or no "productive<br>
infection" means that the vector may infect cells of the subject, for instance near the<br>
zone of administration, however, the virus does not propagate and the risk of an on-<br>
going viral infection and/or prostate specific polypeptide expression in a wide range of<br>
possibly inappropriate cells is minimised. In particular this may occur because viral<br>
replication is inefficient, incomplete, or limited.<br>
For example, it would be inappropriate or undesirable for the poxviral vector to<br>
propagate and spread in cells of important non-prostate ceil organs thus making them<br>
targets of immune destruction. Of course, initial infection and expression of proteins by<br>
the vector is required and engenders an immune response.<br>
Those skilled in the art will know that poxviruses comprise a diverse group of viruses<br>
classified traditionally according to their host range. For example, wild type avipox<br>
viruses do not replicate in the cells of non-avian species. The limiting step in<br>
replication is inefficient late gene expression or inefficient maturation of viral particles<br>
(Somogyi P. et al, Virology 197:439-444, 1993). However, genes under the control of<br>
early poxviral promoters are expressed in the cells of non-avian species such as man and<br>
heterologous genes are routinely expressed in this way {Taylor, J. et al, Vaccine 6:497-<br>
503, 1988; Cox, W. et al, Virology 195:845-850, 1993). In immunocompetent hosts,<br>
some poxviral infections such as, for example, infection with certain strains of vaccinia<br>
in man are generally limited, nevertheless, man is a host species for vaccinia virus and<br>
at least initially, substantial viral replication would be expected.<br>
The measure for absence of productive infection in accordance with the present<br>
invention is the inability of the poxvirus vector to propagate in or spread from the cells<br>
initially infected. In a preferred embodiment, the absence of productive infection in a<br>
subject is less than approximately 10% of total viral replication observed in a<br>
permissive host, preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 1%, even more<br>
preferably less than 0.1% and still more preferably less than 0.01%. The choice of<br><br>
poxvirus vector will therefore depend, inter alia, on the subject species.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, in accordance with the present invention, ihc<br>
recombinant avipcx including fowlpox vectors of the present invention do not<br>
productively infect non-avian hosts.<br>
Alternatively, a conditionally replication defective poxvirus vector may be engineered<br>
by methods known in the art not to productively infect a host. For example, some<br>
aspects of the genetic basis for host specificity in vaccinia poxvirus strains are<br>
understood and replication defective vaccinia viruses have been generated by deletion<br>
of "host range" genes {Perkus, M.E. et a!., Virology 179:276-28, 1990). Also<br>
replication deficient or attenuated viruses such as modified vaccine virus (MVA) are<br>
examples of poxviruses which do not productively infect a human subject. Such<br>
modified or attenuated poxvirus vectors may be obtained by repeated passage of viruses<br>
in cells in vitro, for example in chicken embryo fibroblasts.<br>
Reference to "poxvirus" includes viruses selected from, for example, avipox (eg,<br>
fowlpox, canarypox, penguinpox, pigeonpox) orthopox (eg, vaccinia) capripox (eg,<br>
sheep, goats) and suipox (eg, swinepox). Avipox vectors are preferred vectors. A<br>
particularly preferred vector is fowlpox.<br>
Although human subjects are primarily contemplated, reference to a "subject" should be<br>
understood to include mammals including primates (eg, humans, monkeys), livestock<br>
animals (eg, sheep, cows, horses, donkeys, goats, pigs), laboratory test animals (eg,<br>
mice, rats, ducks, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, hampsters), companion animals (eg, dogs,<br>
cats, birds), and captive wild animals (eg, kangaroos, deer, foxes). Preferably said<br>
subject is a primate and even more preferably a human subject.<br>
Reference to a "cell" in "expresses in a cell" includes expression in antigen presenting<br>
cells such as dendritic cells.<br><br>
The general principles and procedures for generating and using recombinant poxvirus<br>
vectors are well known in the art. Briefly, homologous recombination between a donor<br>
recombination vector and a poxvirus within a host cell permits correct introduction of<br>
the desired sequences. The donor vector comprises a sequence of nucleotides<br>
permitting site specific homologous recombination with a poxvirus vector, a sequence<br>
of nuclcotides encoding a prostate specific polypeptide together with one or more of any<br>
other elements required for amplification in a prokaryotic host, selection of transfected<br>
cells, and transcription of nucleic acid sequences. Double and further recombinants<br>
such as a vector further comprising a sequence of nucleotides encoding an<br>
immunostimulatory polypeptide or peptide are generated in essentially the same<br>
manner, however different promoters and selection markers may be employed.<br>
In a preferred aspect, the present invention contemplates a genetic vaccine construct<br>
comprising an avipox vector which incorporates and, on administration to a subject<br>
expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a prostate-<br>
specific polypeptide, or a homologue or derivative or analogue thereof, wherein said<br>
avipox vector does not productively infect said subject and wherein expression products<br>
of said genetic vaccine construct stimulate a prostate cell specific immune response.<br>
A fowlpox vector is a preferred avipox vector. Fowlpox viruses are preferred inter alia<br>
because, they express appropriate levels of heterologous protein. The use of fowlpox<br>
virus in man may also be preferred because immunity to fowlpox would not generally<br>
be present. In contrast, a large proportion of the human population has been exposed to<br>
vaccinia virus as a result of prior vaccination regimes. As a result, the introduction of<br>
vaccinia virus into a human patient can provoke an immune response to the vaccinia<br>
viral vector. In this situtation, the vector may be neutralised before any antigenic<br>
proteins are expressed.<br>
The genetic vaccine construct of the present invention may also comprise a sequence of<br>
nucleotides which is a useful marker for detection by nucleic acid based assays, or<br>
expressed and useful for detection such as by protein assays including enzyme or<br><br>
antibody based assay?.<br>
The present vectors may be identified using any suitable protocol such as heteroduplex<br>
analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), sequence specific<br>
hybridization probes (SSO), single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP),<br>
sequencing, mass spectrometry, enzyme cleavage, protein probes including antibody,<br>
enzyme or immunoreactive based assays and combinations of these.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention contemplates an isolated antibody which is<br>
determined by epitopes which are uniquely formed in expression products of die subject<br>
genetic vaccine construct.<br>
Isolated antibodies may be monoclonal or polyclonal. Alternatively, fragments of<br>
antibodies may be used such as Fab fragments. Furthermore, the present invention extends<br>
to recombinant and synthetic antibodies and to antibody hybrids. A "synthetic antibody" is<br>
considered herein to include fragments and hybrids of antibodies.<br>
In one embodiment, specific antibodies can be used to screen a sample from a subject for<br>
the presence of expression products of the vaccine construct,<br>
Alternatively, the ability of a subject to mount a specific antibody response to a<br>
proteinaceous form of the vaccine construct may be used to determine whether a subject<br>
has previously been vaccinated with the subject vaccine construct. Techniques for the<br>
assays contemplated herein are known in the art and include, for example, sandwich assays<br>
and ELISA.<br>
Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are obtainable by immunization with the<br>
enzyme or protein and either type is useful for immunoassays. The methods of obtaining<br>
both types of sera are well known in the art. Polyclonal sera are less preferred but are<br>
relatively easily prepared by injection of a suitable laboratory animal with an effective<br>
amount of a proteinaceous form of a molecular marker, or antigenic parts thereof,<br><br>
collecting serum from the animal, and isolating specific sera by any of the known<br>
immunoadsorbcnt techniques. Although antibodies produced by this method an- utilizable<br>
in virtually any type of immunoassay, they are generally less favoured because of the<br>
potential heterogeneity of the product.<br>
The use of monoclonal antibodies in an immunoassay is particularly preferred because of<br>
the ability to produce them in large quantities and the homogeneity of the product. The<br>
preparation of hybridoma cell lines for monoclonal antibody production derived by fusing<br>
an immortal cell line and lymphocytes sensitized against the immunogenic preparation can<br>
be done by techniques which are well known to those who are skilled in the art.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention contemplates a method for detecting a<br>
proteinaceous form of the instant genetic poxviral vaccine construct in a subject said<br>
method comprising contacting a biological sample from said subject with an antibody<br>
specific for a proteinaceous form of the genetic poxviral vaccine construct for a time and<br>
under conditions sufficient for an antibody-antigen complex to form, and then detecting<br>
said complex.<br>
The presence of a complex may be detected in a number of ways such as by Western<br>
blotting and ELISA procedures. A wide range of immunoassay techniques are available as<br>
can be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,016,043, 4,424,279 and 4,018,653. These<br>
includes both single-site and two-site or "sandwich" assays of the non-competitive types,<br>
as well as in the traditional competitive binding assays. These assays also include direct<br>
binding of a labelled antibody to a target.<br>
Sandwich assays are among the most useful and commonly used assays and are favoured<br>
for use in the present invention. A number of variations of the sandwich assay technique<br>
exist and all are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. Briefly, in a typical<br>
forward assay, an unlabelled antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate and the sample<br>
to be tested brought into contact with the bound molecule. After a suitable period of<br>
incubation, for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of an antibody-antigen<br><br>
complex, a second antibody specific to the antiren, labelled with a reporter molecuic<br>
capable of producing a detectable signal is then added and incubated, allowing time<br>
sufficient for the formation of another complex of antibody-antigen-labclled antibody, Any<br>
unreacted material is washed away, and the presence of the antigen is determined by<br>
observation of a signal produced by the reporter molecule. The results may either be<br>
qualitative, by simple observation of the visible signal, or may be quantitated by<br>
comparing with a control sample containing known amounts of hapten. Variations on the<br>
forward assay include a simultaneous assay, in which both sample and labelled antibody<br>
are added simultaneously to the bound antibody. These techniques are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art, including any minor variations as will be readily apparent.<br>
The sample is generally a biological sample comprising biological fluid but also includes<br>
to supernatant fluid such as from a cell culture. Methods of sample preparation arc well<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
"Reporter molecule" as used in the present specification, means a molecule which, by its<br>
chemical nature, provides an analytically identifiable signal which allows the detection of<br>
antigen-bound antibody. Detection may be either qualitative or quantitative. The most<br>
commonly used reporter molecules in this type of assay are either enzymes, fluorophores<br>
or radionuclide containing molecules (i.e. radioisotopes) and chemiluminescent molecules.<br>
In the case of an enzyme immunoassay, an enzyme is conjugated to the second antibody,<br>
generally by means of glutaraldehyde or periodate. As will be readily recognized, however,<br>
a wide variety of different conjugation techniques exist, which are readily available to the<br>
skilled artisan. Commonly used enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase,<br>
p-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, amongst others. The substrates to be used with<br>
the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production, upon hydrolysis by the<br>
corresponding enzyme, of a detectable colour change. Examples of suitable enzymes<br>
include alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic<br>
substrates, which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates noted<br>
above. In all cases, the enzyme-labelled antibody is added to the first antibody hapten<br>
complex, allowed to bind, and then the excess reagent is washed away. A solution<br><br>
containing the appropriate substrate is thu, added to the complex of antibody-antigen-<br>
antibody. The substrate will react with the enzyme linked to the second antibody, giving a<br>
qualitative visual signal, which may be further quantitated, usually spectrophotometrically,<br>
to give an indication of the amount of hapten which was present in the sample. "Reporter<br>
molecule" also extends to use of cell agglutination or inhibition of agglutination such as<br>
red blood cells on latex beads, and the like.<br>
Alternately, fluorescent compounds, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, may be<br>
chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated<br>
by illumination with light of a particular wavelength, the fluorochrome-labelled antibody<br>
adsorbs the light energy, inducing a state of excitability in the molecule, followed by<br>
emission of the light at a characteristic colour visually detectable with a light microscope.<br>
As in the EIA, the fluorescent labelled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody-<br>
hapten complex, After washing off the unbound reagent, the remaining tertiary complex is<br>
then exposed to the light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorescence observed<br>
indicates the presence of the molecule of interest. Immunofluorescence and EIA<br>
techniques are both very well established in the art and are particularly preferred for the<br>
present method. However, other reporter molecules, such as radioisotope,<br>
chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules, may also be employed.<br>
The phrase "expression products" includes the products of transcription and/or translation.<br>
Accordingly proteins are preferred products but the activity of transcripts in RNA form is<br>
not excluded from the scope of the present invention.<br>
The phrase "prostate specific polypeptide" is used in a broad sense and includes a<br>
polypeptide which is expressed on or near the surface of prostate cells, Including<br>
prostate cancer cells, and is not substantially expressed on the surface of non-prostate<br>
cells. In this way, an immune response is directed specifically to prostate cells and not<br>
other self cells of the subject,<br>
A preferred prostate specific polypeptide is a polypeptide which has a low level of<br><br>
similarity to other polypcptides in a subject. This aspect provides that an immune<br>
response is directed preferentially to prostate cells expressing a prostate specific<br>
polypeptide and rather than cells expressing a cross reactive cpitope not determined by a<br>
prostate specific polypeptide.<br>
By way of further clarification a prostate specific polypeptide is not substantially<br>
expressed on or near the surface of non-prostate cells if it is expressed at a level of less<br>
than about 10% of that determined on or near the surface of prostate cells and more<br>
preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 1%, even more preferably less than<br>
0.1%, even still more preferably less than 0.01% or even yet still more preferably less<br>
than 0.001%.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the subject prostate specific polypeptide is a<br>
prostatic acid phosphatase. Advantageously, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is<br>
expressed specifically in the prostate cells including prostate cancer cells and it has been<br>
used widely as a marker for prostate cancer. Additionally PAP exhibits a low level of<br>
amino acid and nucleotide sequence similarity to known proteins and their encoding<br>
nucleic acids, PAP also has a range of homotogues which exhibit a high level of amino<br>
acid and nucleotide sequence similarity.<br>
Homologues, derivatives or analogues of prostate specific polypeptides and their<br>
encoding nucleotide sequences are clearly contemplated. Generally, such forms exhibit<br>
comparable or enhanced function in the present invention, relative to sequences from<br>
which they are derived or based.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention a derivative of the subject nucleic acid<br>
sequences may be a functional part or fragment which achieves the advantage of the<br>
present invention or it may comprise one or more mutations or modifications.<br>
Mutations include one or more nucleotide deletions, insertions or substitutions.<br>
Mutations may be silent, conservative, missense or frameshift mutants provided that the<br>
antigenic function of the polypeptide expressed therefrom is retained or enhanced.<br><br>
Preferably, derivatives have at least 50% similarity to the prc-derivatised or parent<br>
molecule, preferably at least, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%<br>
similarity to the pre-derivatised or parent molecule. Sequence comparisons are<br>
preferably the whole molecule but may also be part thereof, preferably the comparisons<br>
are made in a continuous series of at least about 21 nuclcotides. The nucleotide<br>
sequences of prostate specific polypeptides such as PAP, PSMA and PAP and are<br>
published in Genbank. Homologues from other species are readily obtained by well<br>
known screening and cloning methods.<br>
Functional derivatives may be obtained by any route and may be synthetic or<br>
recombinant. A straightforward but random route is to use mutagenesis followed by<br>
testing or expression and testing of the expression products such as by testing its ability<br>
to induce anti-polypeptide immune response. Additionally, derivatives may be<br>
modified to have other useful properties such as to enhance processing and presentation<br>
of the expressed peptide in order to enhance the immune response thereto.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, derivatives may maintain function whilst having additional<br>
features such as modifications which permit the polypeptide or peptide to be<br>
distinguished over the wild type polypeptide.<br>
Analogues are not a part or mutant form of the parent molecule but they have an<br>
analogous function. Analogues may be recombinant or synthetic and preferably have<br>
enhanced function over the parent molecule for instance by excluding<br>
immunosuppressive epitopes. Analogues may be designed so that their expressed<br>
proteins mimic certain immunological or physiochemical property of the prostate<br>
specific polypeptide.<br>
Homologues of prostate specific polypeptides include isoenzymes, splice variants,<br>
tissue specific forms and species specific forms of the polypeptide. Species<br>
homologues are also referred to as xenogeneic forms of prostatic acid phosphatase and<br>
include, of course, primate, mammalian and rodent homologues. By ^xenogeneic" is<br>
meant the use of forms derived from a different species compared to the species' origin<br><br>
of the subject. Thus, for human subjects, a xenogeneic prostate specific polypeptide is<br>
any form wherein it is not derived from humans. Preferably, homologues exhibit a high<br>
level of sequence or immunological similarity. Derivatives and analogues of the instant<br>
homologues are also contemplated herein.<br>
Usefully, various algorithms are available in the art that permit analysis of peptide<br>
sequences and homologues thereof to determine the likelihood that they will exhibit<br>
enhanced function. For example, the Parker algorithm {Parker, K.C. et al, Journal of<br>
Immunology 152:163-175, 1994) estimates half-times of dissociation for MHC class-I<br>
peptide binding motifs.<br>
Similarity at the nucleic acid level may be assessed in assays exploiting different<br>
hybridisation conditions as is well known in the art and is, for example, described in<br>
Ausubel et al, 2002. Preferably, a derivative nucleic acid molecule of the invention is<br>
capable of hybridizing to a reverse complement of a nucleotide sequence encoding a<br>
prostate specific polypeptide under low stringency conditions at 42°C.more preferably<br>
under medium stringency and most preferably under high stringency conditions.<br>
Low stringency hybridisation conditions includes and encompasses from at least about 0 to<br>
at least about 15% v/v formamide and from at least about 1 M to at least about 2 M salt for<br>
hybridization, and at least about 1 M to at least about 2 M salt for washing conditions.<br>
Generally, low stringency is at from about 25-30°C to about 42CC. The temperature may<br>
be altered and higher temperatures used to replace formamide and/or to give alternative<br>
stringency conditions.<br>
Medium stringency includes and encompasses from at least about 16% v/v to at least about<br>
30% v/v formamide and from at least about 0.5 M to at least about 0.9 M salt for<br>
hybridization, and at least about 0.5 M to at least about 0.9 M salt for washing conditions.<br>
High stringency includes and encompasses from at least about 31% v/v to at least about<br>
50% v/v formamide and from at least about 0.01 M to at least about 0.15 M salt for<br>
hybridization, and at least about 0.01 M to at least about 0.15 M salt for washing<br><br>
condiiions. In general, washing is carried out Tm = 6'-).3 + 0.41 (G+C)% (\farmv ei a!.. ./.<br>
Mol Bio!. ;'. 109, 1962). However, the T,,. of a duplex DNA decreases by 1CC with every<br>
increase of 1% in the number of mismatch base pairs (Bonner et ai, Eur. J. Biochem.<br>
46(1): 83-88, 1974). Formamide is optional in these hybridization conditions. Accordingly,<br>
particularly preferred levels of stringency are defined as follows: low stringency is 6 x SSC<br>
buffer, 0.1% w/v SDS at 25-42°C; a moderate stringency is 2 x SSC buffer, 0.1 % w/v SDS<br>
at a temperature in the range 20°C to 65°C; high stringency is 0.1 x SSC buffer, 0.1% w/v<br>
SDS at a temperature of at least 65°C.<br>
The term "similarity" as used herein includes exact identity between compared sequences<br>
at the nucleotide or amino acid level. Where there is non-identity at the nucleotide level,<br>
"similarity" includes differences between sequences which result in different amino acids<br>
that are nevertheless related to each other at the structural, functional, biochemical and/or<br>
conformational levels.<br>
Where there is non-identity at the amino acid level, "similarity" includes amino acids that<br>
are nevertheless related to each other at the structural, functional, biochemical and/or<br>
conformational levels. In a particularly preferred embodiment, nucleotide and sequence<br>
comparisons are made at the level of identity rather than similarity.<br>
Terms used to describe sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotides or<br>
polypeptides include "reference sequence", "comparison window", "sequence similarity",<br>
"sequence identity", "percentage of sequence similarity", "percentage of sequence<br>
identity", "substantially similar" and "substantial identity". A "reference sequence" is at<br>
least 12 but frequently 15 to 18 and often at least 25 or above, such as 30 monomer units,<br>
inclusive of nucleotides and amino acid residues, in length. Because two polynucleotides<br>
may each comprise (1) a sequence (i.e. only a portion of the complete polynucleotide<br>
sequence) that is similar between the two polynucleotides, and (2) a sequence that is<br>
divergent between the two polynucleotides, sequence comparisons between two (or more)<br>
polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two<br>
polynucleotides over a "comparison window" to identify and compare local regions of<br><br>
sequence similarity. A "comparison window" refers to a conceptual segment of typically<br>
12 contiguous residues that is compared to a reference sequence. The comparison window<br>
may comprise additions or deletions (i.e. gaps) of about 20% cr less as compared 10 the<br>
reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment<br>
of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window<br>
may be conducted by computerised Implementations of algorithms (GAP, BESTFJT,<br>
FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics<br>
Computer Group, 575 Science Drive Madison, Wl, USA) or by inspection and the best<br>
alignment (i.e. resulting in the highest percentage homology over the comparison window)<br>
generated by any of the various methods selected. Reference also may be made to the<br>
BLAST family of programs as, for example, disclosed by Altschul et al. A detailed<br>
discussion of sequence analysis can be found in Unit 19,3 of Ausubel et al.<br>
The terms "sequence similarity" and "sequence identity" as used herein refers to the extent<br>
that sequences are identical or functionally or structurally similar on a nucleotide-by-<br>
nucleotide basis or an amino acid-by-amino acid basis over a window of comparison.<br>
Thus, a "percentage of sequence identity", for example, is calculated by comparing two<br>
optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of<br>
positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g. A, T, C, G, I) or the identical amino<br>
acid residue (e.g. Ala, Pro, Ser, Thr, Gly, Val, Leu, He, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Lys, Arg, His, Asp,<br>
Glu, Asn, Gin, Cys and Met) occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched<br>
positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the<br>
window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield<br>
the percentage of sequence identity. For the purposes of the present invention, "sequence<br>
identity" will be understood to mean the "match percentage" calculated by the DNASIS<br>
computer program (Version 2.5 for windows; available from Hitachi Software engineering<br>
Co., Ltd., South San Francisco, California, USA) using standard defaults as used in the<br>
reference manual accompanying the software. Similar comments apply in relation to<br>
sequence similarity.<br><br>
il'J<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the prostate specific polypernde<br>
has no more than about 70% amino acid similarity to other antigenic proteins in the<br>
subject. More preferably, the prostate specific polypepiide has no more than 60%, even<br>
more preferably no more than about 50% amino acid similarity.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention consequently provides a genetic vaccine<br>
construct comprising an avipox vector which incorporates and, on administration to a<br>
subject expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a prostatic<br>
acid phosphatase, and/or a homologue or derivative or analogue thereof, wherein said<br>
avipox vector does not productively infect said subject and wherein expression products<br>
of said genetic vaccine construct stimulate a prostate cell specific immune response.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a xenogeneic homologue of the prostatic acid phosphatase<br>
is a preferred homologues which exhibits potentially higher binding affinity for more<br>
HLA molecules than an indigenous prostatic acid phosphatase homologue.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present Invention the inventor has determined that<br>
rat PAP-derived motifs exhibit higher binding affinities for more HLA molecules than<br>
human PAP-derived motifs. Accordingly xenogeneic administration is proposed for<br>
some applications. A preferred xenogeneic form of prostatic acid phosphatase for<br>
particular use in human subjects is rat PAP. Without intending to be limited by any one<br>
particular mechanism or mode of action, the use of a xenogenic homologue is provided<br>
to assist in overcoming self tolerance and to illicit effective effector cells such as, for<br>
example, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and Natural Killer (NK). Effective T cells are<br>
generally high affinity and/or high avidity immune effector cells. Combinations of<br>
xenogeneic and indigenous prostate specific polypeptides are also contemplated.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a genetic vaccine construct comprising<br>
a poxvirus vector which incorporates and, on administration to a subject expresses in a<br>
cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a xenogeneic homologue of<br>
prostatic acid phosphatase, or a further derivative or an analogue thereof, wherein said<br><br>
poxvirus vector docs not productively infect said subject and wherein expression<br>
products of said genetic vaccine construct stimulate a p. state cell specific immune<br>
response.<br>
The phrase "stimulates a prostate cell specific immune response" includes reference to<br>
inducing or enhancing or otherwise stimulating a cellular and/or humoral immune<br>
response in a subject to one or more antigenic components of a prostate specific<br>
polypeptide which is expressed on or near the surface of prostate cells including<br>
prostate cancer cells. In a preferred embodiment, the immune response comprises<br>
cellular and humoral responses sufficient to generate immune prostatitis including<br>
antigen specific cylotoxic cells which inhibit, lyse or otherwise down regulate the<br>
number or proliferation of prostate cells including prostate cancer cells, if present, in a<br>
subject. Even more preferably, the immune response is directed selectively towards<br>
prostate cells including prostate cancer cells, if present, and is not directed to other cells<br>
in the subject. As previously canvassed, in exploiting self antigens in vaccines, the<br>
present inventor has selected polypeptides which are essentially specific to the prostate<br>
and which furthermore exhibit a low level of amino acid or nucleotide sequence<br>
similarity to other proteins in the subject.<br>
Various algorithms and assays including in vitro and in vivo assays are available to test<br>
or predict the effectiveness and/or suitability of particular genetic vaccine constructs<br>
within the scope of the present invention. In particular, various cellular and animal<br>
models of prostate cancer in humans are available including primate, dog and rodent<br>
models.<br>
In a further related embodiment the prostate cell specific immune response is enhanced<br>
by co-expressing the prostate specific polypeptide with an immunostimulatory<br>
molecule.<br>
By "enhanced" is meant that administration of the present composition results in a<br>
prostate cell specific immune response which is more effective in treating or preventing<br><br>
prostate-related diseases or conditions in a subject than the immune response, if anv. in<br>
that subject prior to administration of the present composition.<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a genetic vaccine<br>
construct comprising a poxvirus vector which incorporates and, on administration to a<br>
subject expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a<br>
prostate-specific polypeplide or a homologue, derivative or analogue thereof and a<br>
sequence of nucleotides encoding an immunostimulatory molecule, wherein said<br>
poxvirus vector does not productively infect said subject and wherein expression<br>
products of said genetic vaccine construct stimulate a prostate eel] specific immune<br>
response.<br>
The term "immunostimulatory' molecule" is used in its broadest sense and includes<br>
polypeptides or functional parts thereof which stimulate or enhance a prostate cell<br>
specific immune response generated by the immune system in response to the herein<br>
described genetic vaccine construct. The immunostimulatory molecule may, in the case<br>
of particular prostate specific polypeptides or particular poxviral vectors described<br>
herein, be required in order to generate immune prostatitis. In other embodiments, the<br>
immunostimulatory molecule modulates and/or enhances the immune response.<br>
Preferred immunostimulatory polypeptides include all or a functional part of<br>
polypeptides including cytokines, chaperokines, chemokines, accessory or adhesion<br>
molecules such as B7 and 1CAM. Polypeptides which down regulate immunoinhibitory<br>
molecules are also encompassed by the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the immunostimulatory molecule is a cytokine. In<br>
accordance with the present invention it is contemplated that the cytokine is co-<br>
expressed with one or more prostate specific polypeptides. During antigen processing,<br>
the cytokine modulates the immune response to enhance its effectiveness. Preferred<br>
cytokines are one or more of IFNy, IL-12, IL-2, TNFcc, IL-4, IL-7, GM-CSF or IL-6.<br>
Even more preferred cytokines are one or more of IL-2, IFNy or IL-12. A particularly<br><br>
prefeircd cytokine is IL-2.<br>
IL-2 :$ a preferred cytokine, inter alia, because of its ability to enhance the immune<br>
response to the instant vector and because of its documented safety in humans ■. cier<br>
controlled conditions, In treating human subjects, human-derived cytokincs are<br>
preferred.<br>
Accordingly, yet another aspect of the present invention contemplates a genetic vaccine<br>
construct comprising a fowlpox virus vector which incorporates and, on administration<br>
to a subject, expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a<br>
xenogeneic prostatic acid phosphatase and a sequence of nucleotides encoding an IL-2<br>
polypeptide, wherein said fowlpox virus vector does not productively infect said subject<br>
and wherein expression products of said genetic vaccine construct stimulates a prostate<br>
cell specific immune response.<br>
Still another aspect of the present invention contemplates a genetic vaccine construct<br>
comprising a fowlpox virus vector which incorporates and, on administration to a<br>
subject, expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a rat<br>
prostatic acid phosphatase and a sequence of nucleotides encoding an IL-2 polypeptide,<br>
wherein said fowlpox virus vector does not productively infect said subject and wherein<br>
expression products of said genetic vaccine construct stimulates a prostate cell specific<br>
immune response.<br>
Yet another related aspect of the instant invention provides a method of stimulating or<br>
otherwise enhancing a prostate cell specific immune response in a subject comprising<br>
administration to said subject of an effective amount of a composition comprising a<br>
genetic vaccine construct comprising a poxvirus vector which incorporates and, on<br>
administration to a subject expresses in a cell of said subject, a sequence of nucleotides<br>
encoding a prostate-specific polypeptide, or a homologue, derivative or analogue<br>
thereof, for a time and under conditions sufficient to stimulate or otherwise enhance a<br>
prostate cell specific immune response, and wherein said poxvirus vector does not<br><br>
productively infect said subject.<br>
Administration of the genetic vaccine construct composition may be optimised using<br>
protocols which are well known in the art. In particular the dose and frequency will<br>
vary with the mode of administration as well as various parameters relating to the<br>
subject including size, previous exposure to the vaccine, stage of prostate cancer<br>
development, The composition may be administered by any convenient route such as<br>
by oral, intravenous, intranasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous,<br>
intradermal, mucosal or suppository routes. Preferred modes of administration are<br>
intravenous or intramuscular, however, the chosen route will be influenced by factors<br>
such as cost and the stability of the dosage form.<br>
An "effective amount" includes reference to a virus titre necessary to at least partly<br>
obtain the desired immune response overall. This will of course vary with the status of<br>
the subject and accordingly is optimised during pre-clinical and clinical investigations.<br>
Various adjuvants may be used to enhance the efficacy of the subject vaccine.<br>
Examples include alum, lecithins, BCG and saponins, or cellular adjuvants such as<br>
dendritic cells.<br>
The vaccine composition may be co-administered or administered as part of an overall<br>
vaccination regime, with other molecules. For example, the subject vaccine constructs<br>
and its expression products may be administered as part of a prime or boost vaccination<br>
component in a "prime-boost" strategy wherein the immune response is enhanced by<br>
presenting antigens to the immune system via various formats.<br>
Still another related aspect of the present invention provides a method of<br>
immunotherapy and/or immunoprophylaxis of prostate cancer comprising<br>
administration of an effective amount of a composition comprising poxvirus vector<br>
which incorporates and, on administration to a subject, expresses in a cell of said<br>
subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a prostate specific polypeptide or<br><br>
homologue, derivative or analogue thereof, wherein s?.:d pexvirus vector does not<br>
productively infect said subject, and wherein expression products of said po.xvirus<br>
vector stimulate a prostate cell specific immune response effective in the treatment<br>
and/or prophylaxis of prostate cancer.<br>
Reference to "immunotherapy" includes amelioration of the symptoms of prostate<br>
cancer or a reduction in the number or proliferation of prostate cancer cells as well as<br>
treatment to total recovery. Reference to "immunoprophylaxis" includes prevention of<br>
developing prostate cance: or the symptoms of prostate cancer as well as a reduction in<br>
the likelihood of developing the symptoms or more severe symptoms of prostate cancer.<br>
If a subject were diagnosed as exhibiting a marker for progression or a marker for<br>
susceptibility to prostate cancer, the poxvirus vector is administered before diagnosis of<br>
prostate cancer.<br>
Pharmaceutical forms of the composition may be suitable for injectable use such as sterile<br>
aqueous solutions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable solutions or dispersions.<br>
The composition must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must<br>
be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and<br>
fungi. The carrier can be a medium solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,<br>
water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene<br>
glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can<br>
be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin. The prevention of the<br>
action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal and the like.<br>
In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or<br>
sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought<br>
about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum<br>
monostearate and gelatin.<br><br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the viral particles ir. the required<br>
Pinount in the appropriate medium with optionally various of the other ingredients<br>
enumerated above, as required. Batches are tested for sterility contamination with protein,<br>
virus concentrate prWml) virus stability, pH and fill volume.<br>
A broad range of doses may be applicable depending on the subject, severity of condition<br>
and proposed route and medium for administration.<br>
ft is especiaDy advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form<br>
(pfu/ml) for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used<br>
herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for subjects to be treated;<br>
each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the<br>
desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in association with a pharmaceutical carrier. The<br>
specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly<br>
dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular<br>
therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding<br>
such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased<br>
condition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. Techniques foi<br>
enterically locating live vaccine formulations are known in the art.<br>
A further related aspect of the present invention contemplates the use of a genetic<br>
vaccine construct in the manufacture of a medicament for the immunotherapy and/or<br>
immunoprophylaxis of prostate cancer, wherein said construct comprises a poxvirus<br>
vector which incorporates and, on administration to a subject expresses in a cell of said<br>
subject, a sequence of nucleotides encoding a prostate-specific polypeptide, or a<br>
homologue, derivative or analogue thereof wherein said poxvirus vector does not<br>
productively infect said subject and wherein expression products of said poxvirus<br>
vectors stimulate a prostate cell specific immune response effective in the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of prostate cancer.<br>
A still further related aspect of the present invention contemplates the use of a genetic<br><br>

immunostirnulatory polypeptide, wherein said poxvirus vector does not productively<br>
infect said subject and wherein expression products of said poxvirus vectors stimulate a<br>
prostate cell specific immune response effective in the treatment or prophylaxis of<br>
prostate cancer.<br>
In a related aspect of this embodiment, the prostate-specific polypeptide is prostatic acid<br>
phosphatase and/or a homologue or derivative or analogue thereof.<br>
A particularly preferred immunostirnulatory molecule for this embodiment of the<br>
invention is an immunostimulatory cytokine such as, for example, a cytokine selected<br>
from one or more of IFNy, IL-12, IL-2, TNFa, IL-4, IL-7, GM-CSF or IL-6. Even more<br>

The present invention is now further described with reference to the following non-<br>
limiting Examples.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Construction of a genetic vector comprising a prostate specific polvpepride<br>
Human and rat PAP nucleic acid sequences are publicly available, and their cDNAs may<br>
be cloned amd sequcnced using routine methods well lenown to those skilled in the art.<br>
Bacteria] recombinant rat PAP and human PAP plasmid vectors were obtained from Dr<br>
Doug McNeel (Department of Medicine, division of Medical Oncology, University of<br>
Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA) and their products are used for coating<br>
ELISA plates. Recombinant rat PAP and human PAP proteins have been made in the<br>
InsectSelect system and scaled-up production of purified proteins is done so that they may<br>
be used in both rat and human cellular immunological assays .<br>
The recombinant fowlpox viruses expressing human PAP (FPV.hPAP) and rat PAP<br>
(FPV.rPAP) can be generated using molecular biology techniques for shuttle vector<br>
construction using procedures described by Sambrook et al. "Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 3rd Edition, 2001 and using<br>
molecular virology technique to generate recombinant poxviruses using procedures<br>
described by Boyle, D.B., et al, Gene 65(1): 123-8, 1988; Coupar, B.E. eta!., Gene 68(1):<br>
1-10, 1988 and Smith G.L., Chapter 9, Expression of genes by vaccinia virus. In Molecular<br>
Virology, A Practical Approach, Ed. AJ Davison and RM Elliott. Practical Approach<br>
Series, 1RL Press at Oxford University Press., 257-283, 1993. Construction of FPV.hPAP<br>
and FPV.rPAP is briefly outlined as follows.<br>
i._____PAP expression cassette<br>
The PAP protein coding sequence, being either human or rat origin, was operatively linked<br>
to a fowlpox virus specific promoter sequence. The promoter sequence in this case does<br>
not have to be fowlpox virus specific or vaccinia specific and other Avipox derived<br>
promoters can be used and can be of any of the following classes: early, late or early/late<br>
(constitutive) promoters. A preferred element for efficient early phase expression during<br>
an infection is the presence of a poxvirus early transcriptional stop sequence of the motif<br><br>
"TTTTTNT", where N can be any nucleotide sequence, e.g., A or T or G or C, which must<br>
be located 3' downstream of the PAP translational stop ;odon. Addit: n of this earl',<br>
transcriptional stop motif will not be necessary if such a motif occurs by chance some<br>
distance down stream of the PAP translational stop codon. This motif can be conveniently<br>
added to the PAP sequence by R7-PCR amplification (using RNA as template) or PCR<br>
amplification (using cDNA as template) with a primer combination that includes ihis motif<br>
in the PCR primer that targets the 3' end of the PAP nucleotide sequence.<br>
ii. Homologous recombination vector (so called shuttle vector) for aiding insertion of<br>
the PAP expression cassette into the fowlpox genome<br>
The expression cassette described above in step (i) was cloned into a plasmid vector<br>
termed "shuttle vector" or "homologous recombination vector" resulting in a configuration<br>
described as follows.<br>
The PAP expression cassette was cloned in between two short fowlpox nucleotide<br>
sequences of determined length that are homologouc to nucleotide sequences present in<br>
fowlpox genomic DNA that has been previously cloned into a standard commercial<br>
bacterial plasmid vector used for cloning purposes. These short fowlpox nucleotide<br>
sequences are often referred to as homologous recombination arms (left and right) of<br>
flanking arms (flank 1 and flank 2). The key feature here is that the expression cassette is<br>
located within (interior of) the two flanking arms and not exterior to these arms. The result<br>
of homologous recombination between these arms and their homologous sequence within<br>
the fowlpox genome will aid insertion of the expression cassette into the fowlpox genome.<br>
Examples of suitable insertion sites include the TK coding region, 3' of the TK coding<br>
region and the ORF7 to ORF9 region (US 5,180,675).<br>
The shuttle vector also contained a "reporter" expression cassette (beta-galactosidase<br>
protein coding sequence operatively link to a poxvirus specific promoter) and a "positive<br>
selection" expression cassette (E coll xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase<br>
(Ecogpt) operative linked to a poxvirus specific promoter) located exterior to the two<br><br>
homologous recombination arms. This configuration enables "transdominant selection" oi"<br>
recombinant viruses.<br>
iii. Homologous recombination<br>
The insertion of the PAP expression cassette into the fowlpox virus genome was carried by<br>
homologous recombination between the fowlpox virus genomic DNA, present during an<br>
infection of tissue culture cells, and the shuttle vector described above in (ii). Chicken<br>
embryo derived cells were infected with fowlpox virus at low multiplicity of infection, for<br>
example, 0.01 infectious units per cell. An hour or two after infection the shuttle vector<br>
containing the PAP expression cassette was transfected into these infected cells using<br>
commercially available transfection kits following the suppliers instruction. After<br>
transfection, the cells and medium were harvested once the infection had reached<br>
confluency. A viral extract was prepared by releasing the virus from the infected cells<br>
cither by mechanical means or repeated cycles of freezing and thawing or by sonicatior:<br>
Two homologous recombination setups were prepared, one for making a recombinant<br>
fowlpox virus expressing the rat PAP and another to make a recombinant fowlpox virus<br>
expressing human PAP.<br>
iv. Clone purification of recombinant fowlpox viruses expressing PAP<br>
The viral extracts from the homologous recombination step were subjected to multiple<br>
rounds of plaque purification in chicken embryo derived cells until no "white" plaques<br>
could be observed when Xgal was present in the tissue culture medium. Mycophenolic<br>
acid, Xanthine and hypoxanthine (as described in Smith G.L 1993, supra) was also present<br>
in the culture medium during the infection for the purpose of positively selecting<br>
recombinant viruses that had a functional Ecogpt inserted into their genomes. The<br>
mycophenolic acid will inhibit the replication of non-recombinant virus. This selection<br>
procedure will select for viruses where a single recombination between one of the<br>
homologous arms and the viral genome inserts the whole shuttle vector into the viral<br>
genome as viruses without the Ecogpt will not replicate under this selection environment.<br><br>
Viral clones that produce blue plaques in the presence of Xga! were then amplified with<br>
out mycophenolic selection and tested for presence or absence of non-recombinant virus<br>
(empty vector) by PCR analysis using PCR primers that target the flanking region of the<br>
site of insertion.<br>
Recombinant fowlpox virus clones that were tested negative for empty vector<br>
contamination was then subjected to further rounds of plaque purification in the absence of<br>
mycophenolic acid, Xanthine and hypoxanthine to encourage the second recombination<br>
event that will result in the deletion of the reporter and positive selection cassettes from the<br>
recombinant virus. Clones that resulted in white plaques after the addition of Xgal to the<br>
culture medium were amplified and tested for empty vector contamination, removal of<br>
reporter and positive selection cassettes and for functionality of PAP expression.<br>
A recombinant fowlpox vector (M3) encoding human PAP (FPV.hPAP) is plaque purified<br>
and amplified to a titre of 109 pru/mL. The presence of the human PAP insert is confirmed<br>
by PCR. Absence of contaminating wild type fowlpox virus is also confirmed by PCR.<br>
Western blot analysis demonstrates the presence of secreted PAP in the supernatant of<br>
chicken embryo skin (CES) cells, which were infected with FPV.hPAP.<br>
The FPV.rPAP preparation is plaque-purified twice and the presence of the rat PAP insert<br>
confirmed by PCR.<br>
The FPV.rPAP vector is subjected to a third and final round of plaque purification. Then<br>
the plaque-purified vector is amplified to high titre. Expression of secreted recombinant rat<br>
PAP is assayed by Western blot of FPV.rPAP-infected CES cells. The absence of<br>
contaminating wild type FPV is confirmed by PCR. Western blot analysis of human<br>
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC), which have been infected in vitro with<br>
FPV.rPAP or FPV.hPAP, is done to demonstrate that the fowlpox-vectored transgenes are<br>
expressed by the cell type that is most likely to be the target for expression in vivo.<br><br>
EXAMPLl. 2<br>
Construction of genetic vectors that co-express an immunostimulatur&gt; molecule<br>
The human IL-2 (hIL-2) cDNA has been cloned by RT-PCR from human peripheral blood<br>
lymphocytes (PBL), which were activated for 24 h by PMA and ionomycin. The presence<br>
of tlie correct DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Insertion of a fowlpox virus specific hur.ian IL-2 expression cassette into FPV.hPAP and<br>
FPV.rPAP<br>
The human IL-2 cDNA was operatively linked to a fowlpox virus specific promoter.<br>
Alternatives to fowlpox specific promoters can be vaccinia specific promoters of other<br>
Avipox virus specific promoters. To this promoter plus hIL2, a poxvirus early<br>
transcriptional stop sequence was added downstream of the IL-2 translationa] stop codon.<br>
This expression cassette was cloned into a fowlpox shuttle vector with the same<br>
configurations and features as described in step ii) of Example 1, except that the<br>
homologous recombination arms were homologous to a different area of the fowlpox virus<br>
genome than used for the PAP shuttle vectors.<br>
Homologous recombination and viral selection were carried out as described in Example 1.<br>
The end result was two recombinant fowlpox viruses both expressing human IL-2 but one<br>
expressing human PAP (FPV.hPAP/hIL-2) and the other expressing rat PAP<br>
(FPV.rPAP/hIL-2). ELISA was used to measure the in vitro production of human IL-2<br>
upon infection of tissue culture cells by any of these two vectors.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In vivo immunogeuicity of xenogeneic genetic vaccine viral construct<br><br>
The immunogcnicity of viral constructs is determined in appropriate animal models and in<br>
illustrative embodiments, the immunogenicity of FPV.rPAP and FPV.rPAP/hlL-2 is<br>
determined in mice and rabbits.<br>
For detection of anti-rat PAP antibodies, rabbits axe immunized with 1 x 107 pfu<br>
FPV.rPAP or FPV.rPAP/hIL-2 IMI then bled 28 d post-immuni7.ation for direct EL1SA of<br>
serum for rat PAP-specific antibodies, Where rat PAP-specific antibodies are not detected<br>
at 28 d post-immunization then animals are boosted with FPV.rPAP. As a positive control<br>
for both antibody production and the ELISA, rabbits are immunized with recombinant rat<br>
PAP in CFA and boosted with recombinant rat PAP in 1FA at day 21. Blood is drawn and<br>
serum prepared for ELISA 14 days after boosting.<br>
For detection of cellular responses to rat PAP, mice are immunized with 1 x 107 pfu<br>
FPV.rPAP or FPV.rPAP/hlL-2 IMI. Cytolytic and proliferative cellular responses are<br>
measured using spleens harvested from mice killed 6 days and 14 days post-immunization,<br>
respectively. For detection of rat PAP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), either<br>
intracellular expression of IFNγ or cytolytic function by chromium release assay is<br>
measured. Nylon-wool purified splenic T cells are incubated for 6 hours with either<br>
irradiated syngeneic antigen presenting cells (APC): EL-4 cells that have been transfected<br>
with rat PAP or EL-4 cells as a negative control. Surface staining for CDS and intracellular<br>
staining for IFNy is assayed by flow cytometry. Alternatively, purified splenic T cells are<br>
incubated for 4 hours with 51Cr-labelled EL-4 cell transfectants or EL-4 cells and antigen-<br>
specific chromium release measured. For detection of rat PAP-specific proliferative<br>
responses, splenic T cells are purified over a nylon wool column and incubated for 3 days<br>
with irradiated syngeneic splenocytes, which have been loaded with recombinant rat PAP<br>
or chicken ovalbumin as a negative control. In the final 18 hours of culture, tritiated<br>
thymidine will be added and its incorporation measured as an index of antigen-specific<br>
proliferation.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In vitro immunogcnicity of genetic vaccine viral construct<br>
PAPS is a HLA-A2.1-binding peptide epitope of human PAP that is identical in rat PAP.<br>
Peshwa et al., describe how PAP5-specific CTL can be derived in vitro and propagated as<br>
ceil lines that lyse both PAP5-loaded T2 cells or the HLA-A2.1+ and PAP+ prostate cancer<br>
cell line, LNCaP. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from HLA-A2+<br>
donors are obtained and stimulated with PAP5 peptide.<br>
PBMC cultures that continue to grow in response to PAPS peptide are cloned and<br>
expanded. PAPS peptide-specificity is tested by IFNγ-ELISPOT assay. Where clones are<br>
positive, they are propagated on PAPS-loaded T2 cells. The cytolytic activity of PAP5-<br>
specific CTL is tested in a chromium release assay using LNCaP cells as targets.<br>
Appropriate antigen processing and presentation of FPV-vectored rat PAP is assayed using<br>
PAP5-specific CTL. MoDC from HLA-A2.1+ donors are infected with rFPV.rPAP and<br>
antigen-specific reactivity determined by IFNγ-ELISPOT assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Xenoimmunization in a rat model<br>
Each experimental group will comprise five eight week-old rat male Copenhagen rats. Rats<br>
are immunized with 2 x 107 pfu of recombinant viral vectors intravenously (IV) or<br>
intramuscularly (IM). Four weeks later, rats are killed and tissues harvested. Sera are<br>
analysed by direct ELISA for the presence of anti-PAP antibodies. Prostate glands are<br>
examined histologically for evidence of autoimmune prostatitis. Single cell suspensions are<br>
prepared from spleens for in vitro recall proliferation and cytotoxicity assays as described<br>
in the study by Fong et al. We have obtained from Dr Fong the AT-1 and AT-3 cells,<br>
which are syngeneic to Copenhagen rats and are PAP-negative and PAP-positive,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
As a positive control for the induction of autoimmune prostatitis, rats are immunizes with<br>
the recombinant vaccinia vectors (rVV) that express human PAP (rVV.hPAP). Wild type<br>
virus and the recombinant virus that encodes rat PAP are used as negative controls. Virus<br>
vectors are available from: (i) Dendreon Corp. (Seattle, WA, USA) and published by Fong<br>
et al.; (ii) Dr Doug McNeel, which remain unpublished.<br>
The recombinant fowlpox virus vector that encodes (rFPV.hPAP) is tested for its ability to<br>
induce anti-PAP immune responses and autoimmune prostatitis.<br>
The recombinant fowlpox virus vector that co-expresses human PAP and human IL-2<br>
(rFPV.rPAP/hIL-2) is also tested.<br>
Rats may also be primed with plasmid DNA that encodes human PAP (pcDNA3.1-hPAP)<br>
100 µg IM three weeks before boosting with fowlpox virus vectors. Analysis is performed<br>
approximately four weeks after boosting.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
VIR501 comprising rat PAP and IL-2 and VIR502 comprising human PAP and IL-2<br>
Further recombinant FPV vectors were constructed and tested as follows, Specifically,<br>
VIR501 comprising rat PAP and human IL-2 and VIR502 comprising human PAP and<br>
human IL-2 were generated in recombinant Fowlpox M3 essentially as described<br>
hereinbefore except that the integration vector comprised both inserts under the control of<br>
separate promoters. Figure 9 shows the insertion in FPV relative to the FPV thymidine<br>
kinase gene. Integration vectors comprising cassettes for PAP and IL-2 were constructed<br>
with expression under the control of vaccinia virus p7.5 (human IL-2) and fowlpox virus<br>
early late promoter (rat PAP and human PAP). Plasmid maps of the integration vectors are<br>
set out in Figures 10 and 11. The nucleotide sequences of the insertion sites for VER501<br>
and VIR502 are set out in Figures 5 and 6 and in SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3 and 4. The amino<br>
acid sequences of rat and human PAP encoded by the vectors are set out in SEQ ID NO; 5<br><br>
and 6 and are aligned in Figure 7. The amino acid sequence of human IL-2 encoded by<br>
both vectors is set out in Figures 5 and 6 and in SEQ ID NO: 7.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
VIR501 and VIR502 express IL-2<br>
The vectors were tested, by ELISA, for their ability to express human IL-2. After three<br>
rounds of plaque purification, clones were amplified in CEF cells. After infection, culture<br>
media were tested for the presence of IL-2 using a human IL-2 ELISA kit. The results are<br>
shown in Figure 2 where a visible colour change in the well indicates the presence of IL-2<br>
in test wells.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
TK143B cells infected with VIR501 or VIR502 express PAP<br>
One million cells of the thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient human osteosarcoma cell line,<br>
143B, were plated in a 25 cm2 flask overnight in complete DMEM with 10% FCS. Cells<br>
were infected with FPV vectors at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 48h in a<br>
humidified 37°C incubator in 5% CO2 in air. The vectors used for infection were VIR501<br>
(FPV encoding rat PAP and human IL-2), VIR502 (FPV encoding human PAP and human<br>
IL-2), FPV encoding influenza hamagglutinin (FPV-HA) as a negative control. At 48h and<br>
72h post infection, the infected cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (0.15M<br>
NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10mM Tris pH 8, 5mM DTT and 100µM PMSF). A<br>
clear lysate was collected after centrifugation at 12000g for 15 min at 4°C. The samples<br>
were boiled in sample buffer and separated using 12% SDS-PAGE. The blot was<br>
transferred to transferred to a PVDF membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,<br>
Buckinghamshire, England), which was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in<br>
PBS for 1h at room temperature. After discarding the blocking buffer, the membrane was<br>
probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-human PAP (Signet Pathology System, MA, USA) at<br>
1:500 dilution in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. After washing with 0,05% Tween-20 in<br>
PBS, a F(ab')2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase<br><br>
(Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA) was applied at a dilution of 1:2000 and inculeted for<br>
1h at room temperature. The protein bands were detected with the ECL substrate<br>
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire.England) and the fluorescent products<br>
were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Fluorlmager.<br>
The Western blot (see Figure 3) shows expression of human PAP from a VIR502<br>
(FPVhPAP)-infected human cell line. The polyclonal anti-human PAP antibody used for<br>
its detection does not cross-react with rat PAP (lane 6). However, the specific reaction of<br>
sheep immunised with VIR501 as described in Example 9 indicated that V1R501<br>
successfully expresses rat PAP.<br>

Bacterial recombinant proteins, pQE-hPAP or pQE-rPAP, or insect cell-derived human<br>
and rat PAP recombinant proteins (produced by stable transfection of the Sf21 Drosophila<br>
cell line using the InsectSelect™ expression system; Invitrogen, CA, USA) were diluted in<br>
0.03M bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at a concentration of 5µg/mL and used to coat<br>
Maxisorp microtitre plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) overnight at 4°C. In each case,<br>
recombinant proteins were hexa-his tagged and purified on a Nickel affinity column. The<br>
plates were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1h at 37°C (Figure 4) or with 5% normal<br>
horse serum in PBS-azide for 1h at 37°C (Figure 8) and then incubated with serial dilutions<br>
of rabbit sera in blocking buffer for 2h at 37°C (Figure 4) or with serial dilutions of sheep<br>
sera in blocking buffer for 3h at 37°C (Figure 8). After washing with 0.05% tween-20 in<br>
PBS, 1:2500 dilutions of alkaline phosphatase-conjugates of either goat anti-rabbit IgG<br>
[F(ab')2] (Figure 4) or donkey anti-sheep IgG [F(ab')z] (Figure 8) were added and<br>
incubated for a further 2h. Bound antibodies were detected via hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl<br>
phosphate substrate, and the developed colour was measured at OD 405nm.<br>
ELISA data (see Figure 4) show a humoral immune response of male rabbits primarily to<br>
human PAP only after immunisation with VIR502. Presumably, because they are rodents,<br><br>
male rabbits are tolerant to the more closely related rat PAP encoded by VIR501. Figure 8<br>
shows the breakdown of tolerance when castrated male sheep were immunised with<br>
VER501 or VIR502. Sheep immunised with V1R501 (rat PAP, human IL-2) responded to<br>
human PAP and rat PAP and the response was detectably enhanced when sera were tested<br>
against recombinant protein generated in insect cells. Over the time course assessed, sheep<br>
immunised with VIR502 (human PAP, human IL-2) did not generate as great a response to<br>
human PAP or rat PAP as that shown by sheep immunised with VIR501 (rat PAP, human<br>
IL-2). These data complement the data in rabbits, indicating that male sheep may be<br>
tolerant to human PAP rather than rat PAP. As PAP is prostate specific, a prostate specific<br>
immune response has been demonstrated after xenogeneic immunisation with VIR501 or<br>
VIR502.<br>
ELISpot data confirm a human cellular immune response in vitro to VIR501, Human<br>
HLA-A2.1+ human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) were generated by standard<br>
means in GM-CSF and IL-4. MoDC were matured using lipopolysaccharide for 24 hours<br>
and then infected for 5 days with VIR501 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same donor were co-cultured for 7<br>
days with the VIR501-infected MoDC and then Ficoll-purified before an 18-hour<br>
interferon-γ QFNγ) ELISpot assay using as antigen presenting cells (APC) either peptide-<br>
pulsed HLA-A2.1 -expressing murine T2 cells or vaccinia virus-infected HLA-A2.1+<br>
PBMC. In comparison with control APC (autologous PBMC without APC; T2 cells<br>
without peptide; T2 cells pulsed with an irrelevant HLA-A2 binding peptide from HTLV-<br>
1), T2 cells pulsed with HLA-A2.1 -restricted PAPS peptide (Peshwa et al. Prostate 129-<br>
138, 1998), which is identical between rat and human PAP, elicited a four-fold increase in<br>
the number of lFNγ+ spot forming cells (SFC). Moreover, in comparison with control APC<br>
(PBMC infected with wild type vaccinia), PBMC infected with vaccinia expressing rat or<br>
human PAP elicited an approximate three-fold increase in the number of IFNγ+ SFC.<br>
These data support the notion that after VIR501 infection, human APC correctly process<br>
and present endogenously expressed PAP protein to autologous T cells.<br><br>
