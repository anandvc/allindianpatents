				<td>Production of 3-(alkylthio)propanal<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production of 3-<br>
(alkylthio)propanal from glycerol using catalysts.<br>
In addition to the industrially important MMP, MMP<br>
analogues of the general form<br><br>
with R = H, alkyl can also be produced from glycerol.<br>
3-(Methylthio)propanal (MMP) is an important intermediate<br>
and thus of great economic significance for the production<br>
of D,L-methionine and the methionine hydroxy analogue 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid (MHA). Methionine is an<br>
essential amino acid, which is used inter alia as a<br>
supplement in animal feeds. Nutrition-enhancing feed<br>
additives are now an essential component in animal<br>
nutrition. They are used to improve the utilisation of the<br>
nutrient supply, stimulate growth and promote protein<br>
formation. One of the most important of these additives is<br>
the essential amino acid methionine, which occupies a<br>
prominent position as a feed additive particularly in<br>
poultry rearing. In this field, however, so-called<br>
methionine substitutes, such as methionine hydroxy analogue<br>
(abbreviated to MHA), are also of not inconsiderable<br>
importance, since they exhibit growth-stimulating<br>
properties similar to those of the amino acid known for<br>
this purpose.<br>
According to the prior art, MMP is produced by the<br>
catalysed addition of methyl mercaptan to acrolein. Liquid<br>
acrolein is generally reacted with methyl mercaptan in a<br>
reactor in which liquid MMP and the catalyst are already<br>
present in dissolved form (DT 2320544). The use of gaseous<br>
acrolein with methyl mercaptan is also known (FR 7520183,<br><br>
FR 7917827, WO 97/00858). The reaction between methyl<br>
mercaptan and acrolein can take place batchwise or<br>
continuously (US 4,225,515, US 5,352,837). Organic bases,<br>
e.g. tertiary amines such as hexamethylenetetramine,<br>
trialkylamines, e.g. triethyl- or triethanolamine,<br>
benzylamines, pyridines, e.g. 2-fluoropyridine and 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, picoline, pyrazine, imidazole and<br>
nicotinamide, but also copper(II) acetate, mercury methyl<br>
mercaptide and organic peroxides, are used as conventional<br>
catalysts.<br>
The use of ion exchangers has also been mentioned (FR<br>
7520183). The actual addition catalyst is conventionally<br>
combined with an auxiliary catalyst, an organic acid, e.g.<br>
acetic acid, citric acid or formic acid, or a mineral acid,<br>
e.g. sulfuric or phosphoric acid, on the one hand to<br>
inhibit the polymerisation of acrolein, i.e. the formation<br>
of undesirable by-products, and on the other hand to<br>
increase the general yield by conditioning of the added<br>
base. The catalyst is not recovered and is lost during<br>
working up.<br>
Typical catalyst concentrations are 0.001 to 0.005 mole%,<br>
based on methyl mercaptan. The quantity of acid, typically<br>
acetic acid, required is between 0.5 and 50 mole %. To<br>
simplify the MMP production process, the catalyst and acid<br>
can be previously combined in a premix and metered in as a<br>
solution. The concentration of catalyst premix in the<br>
liquid MMP reaction medium is generally 0.2 to 0.75 wt.%.<br>
On completion of the reaction, the MMP is separated from<br>
the auxiliary substances and by-products by distillation.<br>
During the purification by distillation of the addition<br>
product thus produced, the catalyst premix is lost and,<br>
depending on its boiling point, it has to be disposed of<br>
via the distillation bottoms or the waste gas. In<br>
principle, parts of the catalyst or the added acid can pass<br><br>
overhead during the distillation and contaminate the<br>
desired pure MMP.<br>
A disadvantage of this process, besides the consumption of<br>
the catalyst, is the multi-step synthesis of MMP. Thus, the<br>
required intermediate, acrolein, has to be produced in a<br>
complex manner by selective oxidation from propene in the<br>
gas phase and isolated in a multi-step work-up.<br>
According to the prior art, the synthesis of acrolein takes<br>
place by heterogeneously catalysed selective oxidation of<br>
propene on mixed oxide catalysts. EP 417723 describes the<br>
synthesis on complex multi-metal mixed oxide catalysts at<br>
temperatures of 300 to 380°C and pressures of 1.4 to<br>
2.2 bar. In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry,<br>
6th edition, 1999, the entire process is described,<br>
including the work-up, where several by-products are<br>
separated off. After the educt mixture of propene, air and<br>
water has been at least partly reacted on the catalyst,<br>
quenching first takes place to eliminate high-boiling by-<br>
products, such as polymers, acrylic acid and acetic acid.<br>
In the subsequent absorber, acrolein is washed out. After<br>
desorption to recover the absorbent, the crude acrolein<br>
obtained is purified by distillation in several steps.<br>
Up to the present, glycerol has not been used for the<br>
synthesis of MMP. Furthermore, the direct synthesis of MMP<br>
from glycerol is not known. However, it is known that<br>
glycerol can be dehydrated in the presence of acidic<br>
substances to form various products.<br>
According to Organic Synthesis I, 15-18 (1964), by treating<br>
a mixture of powdered potassium hydrogen sulfate, potassium<br>
sulfate and glycerol at 190 to 200°C, acrolein is obtained<br>
in a yield of between 33 and 48%. Because of the low yields<br>
and the high salt loads, however, this process is<br>
unsuitable for an industrial scale.<br><br>
In the context of investigations into model substances of<br>
biomass pyrolysis oils, the catalytic treatment of glycerol<br>
on H-ZSM5 zeolites at 350 to 500°C has also been<br>
investigated - cf. Dao, Le H. et al. ACS Symp. Ser.: 376<br>
(Pyrolysis Oils Biomass) 328-341 (1988). Hydrocarbons are<br>
formed only in small yields.<br>
In DE 42 38 493, moreover, the acid-catalysed conversion of<br>
glycerol to acrolein in the gas and in the liquid phase is<br>
described. DE 42 38 492 relates to the synthesis of 1,2-<br>
and 1,3-propanediol by dehydration of glycerol with high<br>
yields.<br>
For the direct synthesis of MMP from glycerol, however, in<br>
addition to the involvement of dehydration steps, the<br>
simultaneous selective incorporation of a sulfur-containing<br>
Compound, such as methyl mercaptan, is necessary.<br>
According to the invention, a process particularly for the<br>
production of MMP from glycerol without the isolation of<br>
intermediates is provided, wherein the multi-step synthesis<br>
of MMP according to the prior art can now be carried out in<br>
one step using a suitable catalyst.<br>
The invention provides a process for the production of<br>
compounds of the general formula<br><br>
in which<br>
R signifies H, C1 to C3 alkyl, by the reaction of glycerol<br>
or of a compound from which glycerol is released, with a<br>
compound of the general formula<br><br>
in which<br><br>
R signifies H, C1 to C3 alkyl<br>
or compounds from which this (II) is produced,<br>
in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
The preferred product is MMP, which is produced using<br>
methyl mercaptan.<br>
In this process, for example a glycerol-methyl mercaptan<br>
mixture is reacted, optionally in the presence of a<br>
solvent, either in the liquid phase or in the gas phase, on<br>
a preferably acidic solid catalyst.<br>
If the synthesis takes place in the liquid phase, work is<br>
carried out at a reaction temperature of between 50 and<br>
500°C, preferably between 80 and 3500°C, particularly<br>
preferably between 120 and 300°C. The pressure is adjusted<br>
such that the liquid state of the reaction mixture is<br>
maintained. The pressure is generally between 1 and<br>
300 bar, preferably between 5 and 200 bar, particularly<br>
preferably between 20 and 150 bar. In the liquid phase, the<br>
synthesis can be carried out in the presence of either a<br>
homogeneous or preferably a heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
In the liquid phase, the use of a solvent or diluent is<br>
also preferred. As a result of this, the concentration of<br>
glycerol is reduced and side reactions to oligomers,<br>
polymers and other high boilers are minimised. Solvents and<br>
diluents known to the person skilled in the art, such as<br>
e.g. water, alcohols, such as e.g. methanol and ethanol,<br>
acetone, toluene or methyl isobutyl ketone, are used. MMP<br>
itself can also be employed as a solvent, which has the<br>
advantage that no additional substance is used and thus the<br>
work-up is simplified.<br>
In the reaction mixture, the glycerol concentration is<br>
between 1 and 100 wt.%, preferably between 1 and 70 wt.%<br>
and especially between 5 and 40 wt.%, based on the solvent<br>
or diluent. The molar ratio between glycerol and methyl<br><br>
mercaptan is adjusted to between 0.2 and 50, preferably<br>
between 0.4 and 30, especially between 0.8 and 10.<br>
In general, a homogeneous solution is advantageous for good<br>
mass transfer, but is not absolutely essential here. This<br>
can even be exploited in a targeted manner through the<br>
principle of two-phase catalysis, in which e.g. exclusively<br>
the product MMP is soluble in the solvent phase. If the<br>
reaction product MMP is insoluble in the reaction medium,<br>
the product can be separated from the reaction medium by<br>
phase separation without a complex work-up and thus the<br>
entire process can be simplified.<br>
If the synthesis takes place in the gas phase, the reaction<br>
is performed at a temperature of between 200 and 550°C,<br>
preferably between 220 and 450°C, particularly preferably<br>
between 250 and 350°C. The pressure is generally between 1<br>
and 100 bar, preferably between 1 and 70 bar, particularly<br>
preferably between 1 and 30 bar. In the gas phase, the<br>
synthesis is carried out in the presence of a solid<br>
catalyst.<br>
The use of a diluent is also preferred in the gas phase.<br>
This reduces the concentration of glycerol to the values<br>
given above, and thus side reactions forming oligomers,<br>
polymers and other high boilers are minimised. Diluents<br>
known to the person skilled in the art are used, such as<br>
e.g. nitrogen, air or water. Diluting media that can be<br>
simply isolated from MMP by phase separation after<br>
condensation are preferred.<br>
Regardless of whether the process takes place in the gas or<br>
liquid phase, by using glycerol as a raw material the<br>
concentration of reactive intermediates, such as possibly<br>
acrolein, allyl alcohol, acrolein acetals, 3-hydroxy-<br>
propanal or radical and ionic compounds with three carbon<br>
atoms, is adjusted to a comparatively low level by further<br>
reaction to MMP, since these intermediates can undergo<br><br>
rapid further reaction to form MMP. A high concentration of<br>
reactive intermediates would lead to increased formation of<br>
high-boiling residues and is therefore undesirable.<br>
However, according to the prior art, for example, acrolein<br>
is still worked up in a high concentration and used as an<br>
isolated intermediate.<br>
Moreover, through the conversion of glycerol to dehydrated<br>
reactive compounds, which undergo rapid further reaction in<br>
the presence of methyl mercaptan to form MMP, very high<br>
conversions of glycerol are possible without the formation<br>
of high-boiling by-products.<br>
MMP that has formed can then be separated out of the<br>
reaction mixture by a known method, alone or together with<br>
part of the solvent or diluent medium, by stripping,<br>
distillation or extraction. Unreacted glycerol can then be<br>
recycled into the reaction step.<br>
Another advantage of the process lies in the fact that even<br>
glycerol solutions with a content of 5 to 40 wt.% can be<br>
used. Thus, so-called crude glycerols may be employed<br>
directly for the synthesis of MMP without previous<br>
concentration or purification.<br>
The implementation can take place in reaction vessels known<br>
to the person skilled in the art, such as e.g. fixed bed<br>
reactors, stirred vessels, stream tubes or bubble columns.<br>
Methyl mercaptan can be used here in either liquid or<br>
gaseous form. Moreover, it can be employed as a pure<br>
substance or as crude methyl mercaptan with impurities,<br>
such as e.g. methanol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl<br>
polysulfides, hydrogen sulfide or dimethyl ether. The use<br>
of crude methyl mercaptan has the advantage that a cheaper<br>
raw material can be employed, requiring no further working<br>
up.<br><br>
Insoluble substances which, in addition to the dehydration<br>
of glycerol, at the same time selectively accelerate the<br>
incorporation of methyl mercaptan into MMP are generally<br>
used as acidic heterogeneous catalysts. These preferably<br>
have an H0 value of less than +2, especially less than -3.<br>
The H0 value corresponds to the Hammett acidity function<br>
and can be determined by so-called amine titration using<br>
indicators or by adsorption of a gaseous base - cf. Studies<br>
in surface science and catalysis, vol. 51, 1989: "New solid<br>
acids and bases, their catalytic properties", K. Tanabe et<br>
al., chapter 2, especially pages 5-9, chapter 1 (pages 1-3)<br>
of the above document mentions numerous solid acids from<br>
which the person skilled in the art, optionally after<br>
determining the H0 value, can select a suitable catalyst.<br>
Suitable catalysts are preferably (i) natural or synthetic<br>
siliceous substances, such as in particular mordenite,<br>
montmorillonite and acidic zeolites, such as e.g. HZSM-5,<br>
MCM-22, zeolite beta; (ii) support materials, such as<br>
oxidic or silicalitic substances, e.g. aluminium oxide,<br>
titanium oxide, silicon oxide, zirconium oxide or mixtures<br>
thereof coated with mono-, di- or polybasic inorganic<br>
acids, especially phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid or acid<br>
salts of inorganic acids; (iii) oxides and mixed oxides,<br>
such as e.g. aluminium oxides, zinc oxide-aluminium oxide<br>
mixtures or heteropolyacids.<br>
The process can be carried out in the liquid or in the gas<br>
phase. In principle, the same acid catalysts can be used in<br>
both embodiments. However, it has been demonstrated that<br>
some catalysts are preferably suitable for the gas phase<br>
and others are preferably suitable for the liquid phase.<br>
Thus, in the liquid phase, it is preferable to use acidic<br>
zeolites because of their H0 value of less than -3. In the<br>
gas phase, on the other hand, they are subject to more<br>
rapid deactivation, which reduces the space-time yield.<br><br>
Oxides and mixed oxides, on the other hand, provide the<br>
better yields in the gas phase.<br>
When carrying out the conversion of glycerol to MMP in the<br>
liquid phase, correspondingly acidic homogeneous catalysts,<br>
which are soluble in the reaction mixture, can also be<br>
used. These homogeneous catalysts can be used alone or in<br>
combination with one of the heterogeneous catalysts<br>
described here.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, methyl mercaptan is<br>
not added to the reaction mixture immediately at the<br>
beginning of the reaction but is fed in only after reactive<br>
intermediates have formed under the conditions stated<br>
above, at least from partial quantities of glycerol. The<br>
reactive intermediates form MMP by further reaction after<br>
methyl mercaptan has been added. On the one hand, this<br>
method facilitates the conversion of glycerol to dehydrated<br>
reactive intermediates and reduces non-selective reactions<br>
between glycerol and methyl mercaptan. As a result, the MMP<br>
yield can be improved. At the same time, moreover, by<br>
carrying out the reaction in this way, the complex<br>
separation of acrolein according to the prior art can be<br>
avoided and the reaction to MMP conducted in one reactor.<br>
This can take place on the one hand in a batchwise process,<br>
the methyl mercaptan being added to the reaction mixture<br>
after a certain reaction period. A stirred vessel, for<br>
example, would be suitable for this implementation. A<br>
further possibility is a semi-continuous method, in which<br>
the glycerol solution and the catalyst are the initial<br>
charge and the methyl mercaptan is metered in continuously.<br>
On the other hand, it is also possible to feed in methyl<br>
mercaptan only at a point removed from the reactor entrance<br>
in the direction of flow or in another section of the<br>
reactor. By the time the glycerol solution and the catalyst<br>
reach this point, part of the glycerol has already been<br><br>
converted to reactive intermediates. This method can be<br>
implemented industrially e.g. in a staged reactor with<br>
intermediate feed, a stirred vessel cascade or a stream<br>
tube.<br>
Another advantage of the delayed or later addition of at<br>
least a major portion of the methyl mercaptan lies in the<br>
fact that the yield of MMP can be increased, because the<br>
temperature profile or temperature program can be adjusted<br>
so that it is optimised on the basis of the reaction<br>
behaviour of the reactants. Thus, the activation of<br>
glycerol and its first dehydration step require a very high<br>
activation energy and thus high reaction temperatures for<br>
rapid production with high space-time yields. MMP, on the<br>
other hand, has a tendency towards non-selective further<br>
reactions at temperatures higher than approx. 100 to 150°C.<br>
Thus, conducting the conversion of glycerol to MMP by<br>
passing through decreasing reaction temperatures represents<br>
a preferred embodiment.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
In an autoclave, 36 g glycerol and 19.5 g methyl mercaptan<br>
were dissolved in 144 g methanol. 3.8 g of zeolite HZSM-5,<br>
modulus 28 (H0 
zeolite was calcined for 2 h at 150°C and 4 h at 500°C in<br>
air in a drying oven before charging into the autoclave.<br>
The mixture was then heated to 300°C in the autoclave, with<br>
stirring. During this operation, a pressure of 61 bar was<br>
established. After one hour, a sample was taken from the<br>
mixture and analysed by gas chromatography. Taking into<br>
account the proportion of solvent, the MMP content was<br>
6.0 wt.%. None of the by-products or intermediates acrolein<br>
and allyl alcohol could be detected.<br>
Example 2<br>
In an autoclave, 36 g of glycerol were dissolved in 80 g of<br>
methanol. 3.8 g of zeolite ammonium beta CP 814E (H0 
-3.0) from Zeolyst International were added to this<br>
mixture. The zeolite was calcined for 2 h at 150°C and 4 h<br>
at 500°C in air in a drying oven before charging into the<br>
autoclave. The mixture was then heated within 4 h and<br>
stirred at 300°C and 40 bar. After cooling to room<br>
temperature, 19.5 g of methyl mercaptan and 68 g of<br>
methanol were added. This new mixture was then heated to<br>
100°C in an autoclave, with stirring. During this<br>
operation, a pressure of 3 bar was established. After 30<br>
min, a sample was taken from the mixture and analysed by<br>
gas chromatography. Taking into account the proportion of<br>
solvent, the MMP content was 0.8 wt.%.<br><br>

Title: PRODUCTION OF 3-(ALKYLTHIO) PROPANAL<br>
Process for the production of compounds of the general formula<br><br>
in which<br>
R signifies H, C1 to C3-alkyl, by the reaction of glycerol, or of a compound from which<br>
glycerol is released, with a compound of the general formula<br>
R-SH	(II)<br>
in which<br>
R signifies H, C1 to C3-alkyl,<br>
or compounds from which this (II) is produced,<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, characterised in that an acidic solid catalyst, the H0 value<br>
(Hammett acidity function) of which is less than +2, is used.</td>
