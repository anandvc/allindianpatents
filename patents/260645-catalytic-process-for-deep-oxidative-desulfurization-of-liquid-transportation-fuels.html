				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel catalysts, systems and processes for the reduction of the sulfur content of liquid hydrocarbon fractions of transportsition fuels, including gasoline and diesel fuels, to about 10 ppm, or less, by an oxidative reaction.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Crude oil of naturally low sulfur content is known as sweet crude and has traditionally commanded a premium price. The removal of sulfiir compounds from transportation fuels has been of considerable importance in the past and has become even more so today due to increasingly strict environmental regulations relating to the release of sulfur-containing combustion compounds into the atmosphere.<br>
Sulfur in fossil fuels is highly undesirable because of its potential to cause pollution, i.e., SOx gases and acid rain. Sulfur also results in the con'osion of metals and the poisoning of the precious metal catalysts that are widely used in the petrocbemical industries. The Unrted States Enviroiunental Protection Agency has recommended strict regulations for the sulfiur content in the diesel fuel used in the United States. According to these recommendations, the sulfur content in diesel fuel must be reduced from the current level of 500 ppm to 15 ppm during 2006. New regulations in Japan and in Europe require the reduction of sulfur in diesel transportation fuel to 10 ppm during 2007 and 2009, respectively.<br>
Conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) processes have been used widely in refineries to transform sulfur-containing compounds mainly to hydrogen sulfide which itself presents a significant health hazard and is corrosive, particularly in the presence of water. When contacted with certain functional catalysts, hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds act as a catalyst poison, that is, the sulfur deactivates or reduces the effectiveness of the catalyst. The breakthrough of sulfur from various sweetening processes results in catalyst poisoning, corrosion of tanks, ships, and pipelines, and can result in oconomic losses to the refinery from flaring, reinjection for reprocessing, or discounted sales prices for off-spec hydrocarbon products having high sulfur content.<br>
The hydrodesulfurization process involves high temperature, elevated pressure, metal catalysts and large reactors. Apart from being an energy-intensive process, HDS has some inherent problems in the treatment of aromatic hydrocarbon sulfur compounds, such as dibenzothiopene (DBT), and their methylated derivatives, such as 4-methyldibenzothiopene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiopene (4,6-DMDBT). These compounds cause steric hindrance because their C-S bond energy is almost equal to the C-H bond energy, which makes them hard to break down by mere hydrotrealment.<br>
An important fatctor for deep desulfurization is the reactivity of aromatic sulfur compounds. Deep HDS may produce low-sulfur diesel, but ultimately results in higher energy costs and the generation of CO2,. which is a greenhouse gas;.<br>
HDS processing is not effective in completely removing the refractory sulfur compounds in diesel which are present in the form of n-alkyi benzothiophene and n-alky1 dibenzothiophene, where n is methyl, ethyl, or a mixture of both in different ratios and positions on the phenyl groups. The HDS process is not effective in the so-called deep de-sulfurization or deep removal to 10 ppm, or less by weight<br>
There are also references in the technical literature to processes for petro]eum oil desulfurization. FCH- example, Guth et al. disclose the use of nitrogen dioxides followed by extraction wiith methanol to remove both nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds from petroleum feedstocks. (See Guth, E.D. et al., Petroleum oil desulfurization. 1975, (KVB Engineering, Inc., USA). Application: US. p. 8 pp.) Tarn et al. descaibe a process for purifying hydrocarbon aqueous oils such as shale oils to remove heteroatoms impurities including nitrogen and sulfur compounds. (See Tam, P.S., Kittrell, J.R., Eldridge, J.W., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1990, pp. 29,321-324) Deshpande et al. disclose that ultrasonic methods can be applied for the intensive mixing of the biphasic system resulting in a reduction of more than 90% of dimethyl dibenzothiophene (DMDBT) contained in diesel fuel samples. (See Deshpande, A., Bassi A. and Prakash A., Ultrasound-Assisted, Base-Catalyzed Oxidation of 4,6-Dimethyldibenothiophene in a Biphasic Diesel-Acetonitrile System. Energy &amp; Fuels, 2005. 19(1): p. 28-34.<br>
Yazu et al. have reported that dibenzothiophene can be oxidized effectively with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 12-tungstophoric acid (TPA) in a n-octane/acetonitrile biphasic system to give their corresponding sulfones as the major product.<br>
Liquid-liquid extraction is widely used to separate the constituents of a liquid solution by introducing anoAer immiscible liquid. In  the petroleum industry, solvent extraction has been used to remove sulfur and/or nitrogen compounds form liglit oil. The extracted oil and solvent are then separated by distillation. (See Yazu, K.,M. Makino, and K. Ukegawa, Oxidative desidfurization of diesel oil with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of acid catalyst in diesel oil/acetic acid biphasic system. Chemistry Letters, 2004. 33(10); p. 1306-1307); Yazu, K., et al., Tungstophosphoric acid-catalyzed oxidative desulfurization of  ,light oil with hydrogen peroxide in a light oil/acetic acid biphasic system. Chcmisitry Letters, 2003. 32(10): p. 920-921; Yazu, K., et al.. Oxidation of Dibenzothiophenes in an Organic Biphasic System and<br>
Its Application to Oxidative Desulfurization of Light Oil. Energy &amp; Fuels, 2001,15(6): p. 1535-1536.<br>
The processes of the prior art as reported in the literature are complex and present operational difficulties when practiced on an industrial scale. It has been shown that the oxidative desulfurization process using H2O2 or a related agent as the oxidant can be realized using either a heterogeneous or a homogeneous catalyst A heterogeneous catalyst cannot contact the feedstock mixture of H2O2/H2O and the transportation fuel uniformly even in a fluidized bed reactor, since they exist in separate phases. Contact may catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 before it can react with the sulfur. The most commonly reported homogenous catalyst systems for effciently promoting ODS are heteropolyanion catalysts. Heteropolyanjon catalysts need a special medium to stabilize the catalyst and this type of catalyst is relatively expensive.<br>
Despite the disclosure of numerous processes in the prior art, these processes have failed to provide low sulfur hydrocarbon fuels in an efficient and economical manner. Catalyst-based processes disclosed in the prior art employ catalysts that are complex, expensive to produce, and that are not recyclable. The use of these catalysts and processes for the mandated reduction in sulfur levels which are characterized as deep desulfiirization, will be expensive to practice and will necessarily add to the cost of the transportation fuels. The use of complex, unstable and expensive catalyst compounds and systems that are non-regenerable and that can involve hazards in their disposal are less than desirable.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst and process for leep desulfurization that produces essentially sulfur-free hydrocarbons with a chemically simple, inexpensive and reusable catalyst in a system that is highly efficient at low temperature and pressure.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process and catalysts that are effcient and economical for use on an industrial scale to achieve the deep desulfurization of such difficult to remove petroleum fuel components as the benzothiophenes and d i-benzothiophenes.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a catalyst for use in the desulfiirization process that is both robust and that can be readily regenerated and recycled for repeated subsequent uses in the desulfiirization process.<br>
Another object of the invention to provide an improved catalyst-based process that can be installed downstream of the HDS unit for the deep desulfurization of liquid distillate fuels.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The process of the invention broadly comprehends a novel two-stage catalytic reaction scheme in which the sulfur-containing compounds in the feedstock arc oxidized to form sulfoxides and sulfones by a selective oxidant and the sufoxides and sulfones are preferentially extracted by a polar solvent.<br>
The formation of the sulfone and sulfoxide compounds is accomplished using a per-acid oxidizing agent with a transition metal oxide catalyst. The preferred catalyst compounds are (NH4)2WO4, (NH4)6 W12O40. H2O, Na2o4 Li2wo4 K2WO4, MgW04, (NH4) 2M0O4, (NH4)6 M07O24- 4H2O. MnOo and NaVO3-  The catalysts and process of the invention arc useful in effecting sulfur removal from hydrocarbon fuel fractions, including diesel fuel and gasoline. The method of the invention can also be applied to reduce the sulfiir content of unfractionated whole crude oil.<br>
This catalyst system and process of the invention can reduce the sulfur content in liquid transportation fuels to less than 10 ppm w/w. A transition metal oxide catalyst in organic acid media and with an oxidizing agent removes such sulfiir-containing compounds as thiopene,<br>
n-alkyl benzothiophene (BT), n-alkyl dibenzothiophene (DBT), where n can be methyl, ethyl, or a mixture of both at different ratios and at different positions on the phenyl groups, and other sulfur species present in petroleum-based transportation fuels. This milky phase reaction involves oxidation of sulfur-containing compounds into their corresponding oxides. The reaction takes place from ambient tempratures to 200 °C end from ambient pressure to 100 bars. The separation of the oxidized sulfur compounds is easily accomplished due to the formation of two distinct layers.<br>
The sulphoxides and sulphones formed can be extracted by conventional and readily available polar solvents, such as methanol and acetonitrile.<br>
As used in this description of the invention, the tenn "biphasic" refers to (1) the liquid hydrocarbon or fuel portion and (2) the aqueous mixture of acid(s) and oxidizing agent(s) portion. These portions can be intimately mixed to form what appears to be an homogenized condition; upon standing, two layers will form.<br>
The preferred oxidizing agents are H2O2, aqueous solutions of organic peroxides and polar organic acid-soluble organic peroxides. The concentration of the peroxide is from 0.5% to 80% by weight, and preferably from 5% to 50% by weight. The organic peroxide can be an alkyl or aryl hydrogen peroxide, or a dialkyperoxide or diairylperoxide, where the alkyl or aryl groups can be the same or different. Most preferably, the organic peroxide is 30% hydrogen peroxide, ft is to be understood that all references in this description of the invention are to percentage by weight, or weight percent.<br>
The preferred polar organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, dioxin, methyl t-butyl ether, and mixtures thereof. The extraction solvent or solvents are selected for desulfiirization of specific fuels. SoIveents are to to be of sufficiently high polarity, e.g. having a delta value greater than about 22, to be selective for the removal of the sufones and sulfoxides. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to the<br>
following, which are listed in the ascending order of their delta values: propanol (24.9), ethanol (26.2), butyl alcohol (28.7), methanol (29.7), propylene glycol (30.7), ethylene glycol (34.9), glycerol (36.2) and water (48.0)<br>
In additional to polarity, other properties to considfr  in selecting the extraction solvent include boiling point, freezing point, and surface tension. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the polar organic solvents are selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, acetonitriie, dioxin, mediyl t-butyl ether, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Sulfur in particular is known to have a higher polarity value than sulfur compounds from which they are derived via the oxidation process. In this case, they would most likely reside in the aqueous phase in a form of emulsion and also as a precipitate. Minimal amounts of sulfones still emulsified in the upper hydrocarbon layer are readily washed out by water or any of the above-mentioned polar solvents. Centrifugation can be used to complete the physical separation of the aqueous layer from the upper hydrocarbon layer.<br>
The invention thus comprehnds the use of new and yet chemically simple catalyst compounds. The process of the invention is easy to control, economical, and very efficient at relatively low temperatures and pressures, thereby providing the advantage of operating in ranges that are not severe. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The novel process broadly comprehends the biphasic (as defined above) oxidative reaction and extraction employing finely dispersed transition metal catalysts in a sulfur-containing liquid hydrocarbon to promote the oxidation to sulfones and sulfoxides of the sulfur in benzothiophene compounds, followed by the polar phase extraction of the oxidized sulfones and sulfoxides, thereby providing deep sulfur removal from the fuel.<br>
In the practice of the process of the invention, a sulfur-containing liquid transportation fuel stock is intimately mixed with a solid catalyst formulation in the form of a polar slurry mixed with H2O2/H2O, or ottier aqueous peroxides, and which is-easily dispersed in the transportation fuel. The active component is highly dispersd in the polar system, which is believed to form a stable transition metal peroxide complex-containing intermediate. This intermediate can "travel" in the oil phase easily during stining to catalyze oxidation of the sulfur-containing compounds and convert them into a sulfone or sulfoxide, which is then extracted by the polar slurry phase. This method uses a homogeneous catalyst dispersed in the polar phase. The separation of the catalyst from the products can be easily achieved by simple phase decantation or by centrifugation, if desired.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, 1-2 weight % of a dispersible transition metal oxide, 0.5-1 weight % of oxidizing agent, for example, peroxides, in less than 5% organic acid, are thoroughly mixed with a hydrotreated liquid transportation fuel, such as diesel or gasoline (i.e., the oil phase), in order to oxidize the sulfur-containing compounds to form their corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones. The oxidation process can be conducted in either continuous flow or<br>
batch reactors. The reaction proceeds effciently from as low as ambient temperature and pressure to 200°C and 100 bars.<br>
The oxidant in Ais process is chosen from H2O2, or aqueous or polar organic acid-soluble organic peroxides. The concoitration of peroxide can be from 0.5% to 80%, preferably from 5% to 50% by weight. The organic peroxide can be alkyl or aryl hydroperoxide, or a dialky or diaryiperoxide, where the allkyl or aryl groups can be the same or different, and preferably the organic peroxide is 30% hydrogen peroxide. Suitable compounds include tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide, (CH3) COOH, cumyl hydroperoxide, C9H12O2; and di-tertiary-butyl peroxide, C8H18O2 and dicumyl peroxide, [C6H5C(CH3)20]2, among others.<br>
Mixing the oxidant phase, e.g., H2o2 or other peroxide, one or more carboxylic acids, with or without the other organic solvent, and a transition metal salt, forms the polar phase system. The carboxylic acid can be formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, or other longer-chain carboxylic acids. The carbon number can be from 1 to 20, and is preferably from 1 to 4.<br>
The transition metal salt is chosen for its ability to form a slurry, or milky phase, in tiie polar solvent systems which appears more as a homogeneous phase, rather -than a hcterogeous phase. The transition metal oxo-salt can be (NH4) 2WO4, (NH4)6 W1204o- H2O, Na2W04, Li2W04. K2WO4, MgW04, (NH4)2Mo04. (NH4)6 Mo7024- 4H2O. MnOo and NaVOs, and mixtures thereof. A suitable transition metal oxide catalyst for use in the process of the invention forms a slurry or milky phase with the polar solvent<br>
Upon standing, two immiscible layers are formed, e.g., the oil phase and the polar phase. The fuel recovery rate is greats than 95%. A substantially complete recovery of the fuel can be projected upon scale-up of the process and separation equipment. With more than a 95% recovery rate, the upper non-polar phase consists principally of treated liquid fuel containing less than 10 ppm of sulfur. The lower milky layer contains the newly-formed<br>
oxidized sulfur compounds dissolved in the organic acid, the oxidizing agent and the catalyst. The lower layer can readily be physically separated and washed with any conventional polar solvent, such as methanol or acetonitrile, in order to remove the sulfltr-contzuning compounds. The catalyst can be recovered by filtration, washed, if necessary, and used again in subsequent oxidation reactions.<br>
This oxidative process reaction can be carried out at: temperatures ranging from 10° to 200°C, preferably from 50" to 90°C and is operable from ambient pressure to 100 bars, and preferably is carried out at a pressure from 1 to 10 bars. Under approppropriate conditions, the reaction can be completed in 30 minutes, or less.<br>
Stirring is preferable throughout the reaction to form the desired medium and to homogenize the mixture for the reaction to proceed efficiently and effectively to completion, e.g., to a reduced sulfur content of 10 ppm or less. Conventional laboratory stirring, heating and temperature control apparatus was used in the examples that are described below.<br>
The reaction products are principally oxygenated thiophenic compounds such as sulfones and sulfoxides. In the second step of the process of the invention, the extraction of the dissolved oxygenated thiophenic compounds is accomplished with high efficiency by the use of polar solvents such as acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, dioxin, methyl t-butyl-ether, or their mixtures. Alternatively, since the oxygenated sulfur products obtained have higher polarity zmd/or molecular weight, they are readily separated from the liquid fuels by distillation, or by solvent extraction methods, or by selective adsorption, all of which processes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The process of the invention can be advantageously introduced downstream of existing hydrodesulflirization (HDS) units in order to reduce any remaining refractory sulfur compounds to a content that is 10 ppm or less.<br>
Most of the prior art catalysts known to and used in the art are complex, expensive to produce and non-recyclable. In contrast, the catalysts used in the process of the present invention are not complex, and are robust, economical and can be readily regenerated and recycled. The novel process and catalysts of the invention provide an efficient and cost-effective process for deep removal of sulfur-containing compounds from liquid distillate fuels.<br>
This highly efficient biphasic catalysis system, and the ease of separation of the catalyst makes it possible for the oxidative desulfurization process of this invention to be used on an industrial scale.<br>
The invention will be further described in conjunction with the results of tests that are representative of various embodiments. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, various modifications and substitutions can be made that are within the scope of the invention. A general description of the laboratory-scale tests follows.<br>
The following examples describe the stepwise procedure for practicing the oxidative extractive desulfurization (OEDS) process of the invention. Also described are tests using both a prepared sample, or model feed, and an actual commercial diesel fraction sample. In these examples, the organic chemicals used in preparing the test compositions were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals Company, Inc. of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
In some examples, the "% conversion" is reported, the value being calculated as follows:<br>
% Conversion = (Co-Ct)/Co x 100 where Co is the initial concentration of the sulfur compound(s) and Q is the concentration measured at a specified period of time after the beginning of the oxidation reaction.<br>
In the following examples, the oxidized compounds and solvent in the aqueous layer were separated from the hydrocarbon upper layer, either by gravity separation, alone, or in combination with centrifugation. Example 1 - Preparation of a standard thiophene compound - DBT/n-Cg.<br>
One gram of 98% dibenzothiophene was dissolved in 99% n-octane (n-Cg) in a 500 ml volumetric flask with gentle stirring and shaking. This solution had a sulfur content of 495 ppmw and was used as the internal standard.<br>
Example 2 - Oxidative Reaction of the Standard Thiophene Comf)ound<br>
The oxidative test of this example used the standard compound DBT/n-Cg prepared in Example 1. This test was carried out in a 250 ml round bottom flask immersed in a thermostatically controlled bath and equipped with a condenser, thermometer and magnetic stirrer.<br>
A solution of 50 ml of DBT/n-Cg was added to 0.2 g of 98% sodium tungstate di-hydrate (STDH), 0.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H202) and 5 ml glacial acetic acid (CH3CO2H) was homogenized in the flask with stirring and heating starting at 30°C with incremental temperature increases of 20°C up to 1 IO°C. The temperature was maintained for 30 minutes at each 20°C interval from 30°C to 110°C, and the total reaction time was 150 minutes. Starting at as low as 50°C, a lower milky layer was formed. Small aliquots of samples were carefully withdrawn from both upper and lower layers at the end of each 30-minute time interval and each 20°C temperature interval in order to plot the kinetics of the oxidative reaction. After oxidation, the mixture was decanted into a centrifugation tube and centrifiiged at 3000 rpm for from 5 to 10 minutes using a Denley BS 400 centrifuge. The two layers were then physically separated using a separatory funnel.<br>
The collected samples were analyzed by gas chromatography in a Varian 3400 GC<br><br>
equipped with a capillary column DB-1 (L-25mm, ID-0.22mm, FT-l.Oum) bonded with dimethyl polysiloxane as a stationary phase. This non-poIar phase is suitable for routine laboratory analysis. The GC was programmed for operation as illustrated schematically in FIG. 1, The sample was heated and held at 50°C for two (2) minutes; the temperature was raised over twenty-five minutes at the rate of 10°C per minute to a final temperature of 300°C. The final reading was taken after two (2) minutes at 300°C. The other relevant conditions are set forth in FIG. 1<br>
Product identification was based on standard compounds. The GC-FID results are reported in Table I.<br>
(Table no1 Removed)<br>
As can be seen from the results reported in Table 1, the amount of sulfur in the DBT was reduced over 800-fold, i.e., the sulfur was substantially eliminated from the sample and was converted to sulfone/sulfoxide compounds.<br>
The following examples will demonstrate that the activity of the used STDH catalyst is sufficient to permit it to be recycled and used several times without regeneration.<br>
Example 3 - Testing of Recycled Used Catalyst Activity<br>
Two layers were observed as a result of the reactions described in Example 2. The upper layer was composed of the sulfur-contaming fuel sample (DBT/n-Cg) which has a very low remaining amount of DBT. After a physical separation of this layer, it was found that the volume recovered was more than 98% without significant loss of the fuel. The lower layer, which is milky in appearance, is about 2.8 ml in volume and consists mainly of the dissolved catalyst with the remainder being the acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (first round).<br>
The activity of the catalyst from Example 2 was further tested in this example.<br>
The lower layer was topped up to 5 ml by adding 2.2 ml of acetic acid and 0.5 ml H202 and with addition of 50 ml of fresh prepared standard sample (DBT/n-Cg) in a clean round bottom flask. The mixture was stirred and the temperature gradually increased to 90°C. The reaction proceeded as previously observed and as described above. The upper layer from the previous test was recovered totally without any measurable volumetric loss of the fuel sample. The lower layer consisting of 3 ml of solution containing catalyst was recovered and was used •for the third round of testing, as described below (second round).<br>
Example 4 — Continued Testing of Used Catalyst Activity<br>
The activity of the catalyst recovered from the sample of Example 3 was further tested.<br>
The 3 ml recovered from the lower layer of the previous example was topped up by adding 2 ml of AcOH, 0.5 ml of H2O2 and 50 ml of fresh E'BT/n-C8. The upper layer was removed and retained after reaching 90°C and the lower layer was found to contain 3.3 ml that will be used in a further test of catalyst activity as described below (third round). Example 5 - Further Test of Used Catalyst Activity<br>
The activity of the catalyst from Example 4 was further tested.<br>
The 3.3 ml recovered from the lower layer of Example 4 was topped up by adding 1.7 ml AcOH, 0.5 ml H2O2 and 50 ml of fresh DBT/n-C8. After GC analysis of the products collected as in the previous examples, it appeared that the catalyst was not as active as in the previous rounds. In order to confirm the accuracy of this conclusion, the further test of Example 6 was performed (fourth round).<br>
Example 6<br>
In order to confirm the apparent reduction in the activity of the catalyst from Example 5, fresh catalyst was added in this example.<br>
Addition of 0.1 g of STDH to the lower layer from the fourth round and 0.5 ml H2O2 with stirring and incremental heating to 90°C was performed as described as in prior examples. The analytical result showed substantially complete conversion of the DBT to its sulphones or sulphoxides, DBTS.<br>
This confirmed the preliminary conclusion from the fourth round GC results of Example 5 that the catalyst was not as active as in the previous tests.<br>
The GC results from Examples 2-6 are shown in the summary of Table H and confirm that the catalyst remains active after three reaction batches. Note that catalyst was added in Example 6.<br>

The NaVO3 successfully converted about 19% of the starting material and can be considered as having utility as an ODS transition metal catalyst<br>
Preparation of Standard Dimethyldibenzothiophene (DMDBT)<br>
In the following examples, the catalytic activity of compounds shown above to be effective will be tested. A standard solution of DMDBT was prepared EIS follows.<br>
One gram of 4,6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene (DMDBT) 98% purchased from Aldrich was homogenized in n-octane, 99%, also purchased from AJdrich, in a 500 ml volumetric flask with gentle stirring and shaking. This solution had a 215 ppmw sulfur content.<br>
Example 19 - Sodium Tungstate Oxidation of DMDBT<br>
As demonstrated in Example 2, STDH with H2O2 and acid readily converts DBT to its DBTS. hi the following Example, the effect of the STDH catalyst on die standard DMDBT prepared as described above will be demonstrated. It is well known in the art that it is difficult to remove DMDBT by conventional HDS due it high steric hindrance.<br>
In this test, 50 ml of DMDBT/n-Cs was added to 0.2 g of STDH in presence of 0.5 ml H2O2 and 5 ml acetic acid. They were all mixed together in a 250 ml round bottom flask under condenser and with continuous stirring. The temperature was raised incrementally from 30 to 90 °C.<br>
The observed results were deemed remarkable. As it has been reported in the literature, DMDBT is more easily removed by ODS than HDS. In this nm, almost complete conversion of DMDBT to its sulfones or sulfoxides (DMDBTS) at only 50°C was observed. No peaks at all were detected at 90*C, which is a strong indication that DMDBT and its corresponding sulfur compounds originally in the fuel were totally converted. The results are summarized in Table UI.<br><br>

Table lit Example 20 - Oxidative Reaction Using a Commercially Produced Diesel Sample.<br>
In this example, the test with the catalyst of Example 2 is described. The same procedure is applied in the following examples using the actual hydrotreated Arabian diesel taken from a refinery, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The test was carried out in a 250 ml round bottom flask immersed in an oil bath and equipped with a condenser, electronic thermometer and a magnetic stirrer. A mixture of 0.2g of sodium tungstate di-hydrate was mixed with 50 ml of the internal standard, and 5 ml of acetic acid and 0.5 ml of hydrogen peroxide were added at room temperature. The progress of the reaction was monitored as the temperature was increaised at 20°C intervals and maintained for 30 minutes up to 90°C. Reaction samples were collected from the separated upper and lower layers at the end of each time interval. The lower layer appeared milky at 50°C due to the oxidation reaction between the sulfur constituent and hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The chromatograms of FIG. 3 show clearly that all of the sulfur-containing compounds in the diesel sample were converted into their corresponding oxygenated sulfones and sulfoxides.<br>
A further summary of the data collected is provided in the following Table IV which shows the conversions at increasing temperatures for the catalysts tested. This data was based on the peak areas of GC-FID chromatograms.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 Table IV Further information concerning the effectiveness of the various catalysts tested is shown graphically in FIG. 2, in which the percent of sulfur conversion is plotted against the temperature for various ODS catalysts.<br>
Example 21 - Extraction of the Newly-Formed Oxygenate(d Sulfur Compounds.<br>
Most of the newly-formed oxygenated sulfones and sulfoxides were in the lower acetic acid layer with the catalyst and are easily removed by separation of the layers. The upper layer contained only diesel with a small portion of the newly-formed oxygenated sulfones and sulfoxides and was washed with a polar solvent to remove the impurities in the diesel. Methanol was used in this example. It has a density of 0.79 g/cc; a typical diesel fuel having em API value of 25-45 has a density of from 0.82 to 0.91 g/cc meastured at 15°C. Once mixed, methanol will form the upper clear layer that can be separated using a separatory funnel from lower diesel layer.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, four (4) chromatograms depict the following: (a) the original diesel sample; (b) after the catalytic processing in accordance with Example 2; (c) after extraction by methanol as described in this example; and (d) the analysis of the methanol layer containing the extracted sulfones and sulfoxides.<br>
The following Tables IV and V show that total sulfur content in the original sample of Diesel-1 was 405 ppmw and was reduced to less than 40 ppmw after the methanol extraction step.<br>
(Table Removed)….4&amp;5<br>
 As will be understood from the above description and illustrative laboratory examples of the practice of the invention, the catalyst compounds disclosed are highly stable, of relatively simple structure and therefore economical, and can be reused.<br>
The process is neither homogeneous nor hetoerogeneous, but rather is a biphasic system in which the catalyst is suspended in the solvent phase. This permits the treated liquid &amp;el to be easily separated from the reacted sulfur compounds and the solid catalyst particles to be separated for reuse or disposal, as appropriate.<br>
The process of the invention provides a means of producing liquid transf&gt;ortation fuels that meet lhe developing environmental standards for ultra low-sulfur fuels.<br>
The process can be practiced in the ambient to moderate temperature range and at ambient to moderate pressure, thereby making it economical from the standpoint of capital equipment and operational expenses.<br>
This invention will safeguard the hydrocarbon product's quality and ensure the production of hydrocarbons having a near-zero sulfur content for use as transportation fuels, petrochemical production feedstreams and other uses that will meet current and future environmental regulations and legislation. The process of the invention will also eliminate or alleviate the need for flaring and reinjection in the refining industry and the discoimt pricing of hydrocarbon sales due to off-spec products.<br>
The availability of a very low or substantially sulfur-free diesel fuel is potentially of great importance to the practical application of fuel cell technology to automotive use. Fuel cells require virtually sulfur-free diesel to make syngas for solid oxide fuel cells. Currently, no method is available to completely and easily remove sulfur from diesel fuel. The catalysts and process of the present invention can be used to remove sulfur from diesel easily and economically, and can thereby advance automotive fuel cell applications.<br>
