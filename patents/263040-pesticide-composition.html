				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Pesticide composition<br>
The present invention relates to novel pesticide compositions in the form of a gel<br>
material or a solid material which are suitable for combating arthropod pests, in<br>
particular insects.<br>
Arthropod pests and in particular pests from the classes of insects and arachnids<br>
destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial<br>
structures, causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property. The may<br>
also act as vectors for human, animal and plant diseases and cause hygienic<br>
problems. Therefore, much effort has been spent to provide methods for effective pest<br>
control. Most of these methods rely on the application of organic compounds which<br>
interfere with the metabolism of the pest to be controlled. For effective control it is<br>
required that the pest gets into contact with or even ingests the active compound or a<br>
metabolite thereof. Therefore, it is required that the active organic compound is<br>
formulated and applied in a manner that ensures contact of the pest with the active<br>
compound or uptake of the active compound by the pest to be controlled.<br>
In plant protection, pesticide compounds are mostly applied as aqueous spray broth or<br>
as dusts in order to achieve uniform distribution of the pesticide compound. The<br>
aqueous spray liquor is generally obtained by diluting a suitable pesticide concentrate<br>
formulation. Since most of the pesticide compounds are water insoluble, the<br>
concentrate formulations contain considerable amounts of surfactants. Due to the<br>
presence of surfactants rain may leach out the pesticide compound which results in a<br>
loss of activity and/or effectiveness.<br>
Other application forms of pesticide compounds include solid or gel-like formulations<br>
which are applied directly to the locus where the pest is expected to occur in order to<br>
achieve ingestion or contact of pesticide compound with/by the pest to be controlled.<br>
Naturally, the applied formulations are subjected to climatic conditions which often lead<br>
to an aging of the formulation and a loss of effectiveness.<br>
WO 91/07972 describes gel-type bait formulations for combating insects which<br>
comprise water, an insecticidally active ingredient and an effective amount of<br>
carrageenan for causing the water and the insecticidally active ingredient to form a gel.<br>
WO 97/11602 discloses gel baits for controlling insects, comprising a hydration-gellable<br>
substance and an active ingredient selected from the group of 1-arylpyrazoles. The<br><br>
gellable substance is selected from gellan gum, carrageenan, agar agar, gelatine,<br>
jelutong gum, xanthan gum, locust gum, polysaccharide gums.<br>
WO 2006/055275 discloses a gel formulation for combating flies containing one or<br>
more neonicotinoids, one or more gelling agents and one or more attractants, the gel<br>
having a Brookfield yield value between 50 and 1000 and a Brookfield viscosity<br>
between 20000 and 200000 mPa.s. Starches, gellan gum, jelutong gum, carrageenan<br>
gum, agar agar, casein, gelatine, carob gum (locust gum), xanthan gum,<br>
polysaccharide gum, phycocolloids, polyacrylate polymers, semisynthetic cellulose<br>
derivatives such as carboxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxy vinylates,<br>
bentonites, silicates and colloidal silica are suggested as gelling agents, with particular<br>
preferences given to xanthan gum and water-soluble polyacrylate polymers of the<br>
Rhodopol G and Carbopol EZ-2 type.<br>
The activity of the aforementioned gel formulations is not satisfactory, in particular the<br>
long-time activity, since upon aging of the formulation a considerable loss of<br>
effectiveness occurs.<br>
WO89/12450 discloses insecticidal delivery compositions for controlling a population of<br>
terrestrial insects or pests comprising at least one superabsorbent polymer which is<br>
capable of absorbing over 100 times of its weight in water and at least one insecticidal<br>
or pesticidal compound. The superabsorbent polymers serve for incorporation or<br>
encapsulation of the pesticidal compound. This document does not address the<br>
problem of aging of directly applicable formulations nor the problem of leaching when<br>
the pesticide compound is applied as a sprayable liquor. Moreover, the compositions<br>
disclosed in WO89/12450 are not satisfactory with regard to these problems.<br>
DE 10124297 discloses formulations of active compounds for plant protection<br>
comprising superabsorbent polymers, which provide a reduced phytotoxicity of the<br>
active compound and thus are suitable for use in nutrient media for plants. The<br>
formulations are obtained by kneading the superabsorbent polymer and the active<br>
ingredient in the presence of water. The effectiveness of these formulations is not<br>
entirely satisfactory. This document does not address the problems associated with<br>
leaching and aging.<br>
DE 10157350 discloses formulations of active compounds comprising superabsorbent<br>
polymers which are obtained by kneading the superabsorbent polymer and the active<br>
ingredient in the presence of water. The tested formulations contain fungicides. The<br><br>
effectiveness of these compositions is not entirely satisfactory. This document does not<br>
address the problems associated with leaching and aging.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a pesticidal composition which can be<br>
applied directly or as an aqueous spray liquor and which overcomes the problems of<br>
prior art. In particular, the compositions should provide an increased activity of the<br>
pesticide compound and/or reduce aging or leaching.<br>
It was surprisingly found that these and further objects can be achieved by pesticide<br>
compositions in the form of a gel or a solid which besides at least one pesticide<br>
compound contain from 0.5 to 20% by weight of at least one superabsorbent polymer P<br>
having an absorption capacity for deionised water of least 100 g/1 g of polymer P, from<br>
5 to 94.5% by weight of at least one filler material, different from water, and from 5 to<br>
94.5% by weight of water, wherein the carrier material together with the<br>
superabsorbent polymer P and with the water provides the pesticide composition with a<br>
gel-like or solid texture.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to a pesticide composition in the form of a gel or solid<br>
which contains<br>
i) 0.001 to 50% by weight of at least one pesticide compound which is effective<br>
against arthropod pest,<br>
ii) 0.5 to 20% by weight of at least one superabsorbent polymer P having an<br>
absorption capacity for deionised water of at least 100 g per 1 g of polymer P,<br>
and<br>
iii) 5 to 94.5% by weight of at least one filler material different from water, and<br>
iv) 5 to 94.5% by weight of water,<br>
wherein the % by weight are based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the pesticide compositions as<br>
described herein for combating arthropod pests and to a method for combating<br>
arthropod pests, which comprises applying a gel composition as defined herein either<br>
directly or as an aqueous dilution to a location where the arthropod pest gets into<br>
contact with said composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention have a solid or gel-like texture. The texture<br>
of the composition is primarily provided by coaction of the filler material together with<br>
the superabsorbent polymer P and the water present in the composition. The<br>
compositions of the present invention provide a superior long-lasting pesticidal activity,<br>
in particular in comparison with conventional get-type or solid formulations. Moreover,<br><br>
they have a higher activity in comparison with conventional formulations of pesticide<br>
compounds and thus allow a reduction of the application rate of the pesticide<br>
compound. Moreover, they show a better storage stability in comparison with<br>
conventional liquid formulations. In particular they do not show separation of active<br>
material upon storage.<br>
According to the invention, the pesticide composition comprises at least one pesticide<br>
compound, which is active against arthropod pest. Generally, the pesticide compound<br>
is a non-polymeric organic compound having a molecular weight ranging from 150 to<br>
1000 Dalton. Suitable pesticide compounds may be solid or liquid at room temperature.<br>
The pesticide composition according to the invention preferably contains from 0.01 to<br>
20% by weight, in particular from 0.01 to 10% by weight, in particular from 0.02 to 5%<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one active<br>
compound, e.g. 1,2,3 or 4 different active compounds, which is (are) active against at<br>
least one arthropod pest, in particular against at least one insect species. Of course,<br>
the compounds may be chosen in a manner to achieve activity against more than one<br>
insect species.<br>

Superabsorbent polymers are well-known synthetic organic polymers which are solid<br>
and hydrophilic, which are insoluble in water, and which are capable of absorbing a<br>
multiple of their weight of water or aqueous solutions, thereby forming a water<br>
containing polymer gel. Superabsorbent polymers according to the present invention<br>
are generally capable of absorbing at least 100 parts by weight of water per one part by<br>
weight of superabsorbent polymer (deionised water at 25°C, pH 7.5, 1 bar). The<br>
amount of water or aqueous solution a superabsorbent polymer is capable of absorbing<br>
is also termed as absorption capacity or maximal absorption. For purposes of the<br>
invention, superabsorbent polymers are preferred which have an absorption capacity<br>
for deionised water (pH 7.5, 25°C, 1 bar) of at least 150 g/g, e.g. 150 to 500 g/g, in<br>
particular 200 to 500 g/g, more preferably 300 to 500 g/g of superabsorbent polymers.<br>
For purposes of the invention, superabsorbent polymers are preferred which have an<br>
absorption capacity for a 0.1 % by weight aqueous solution of sodium chloride of at<br>
least 100 g/g, in particular 100 to 300 g/g of superabsorbent polymer (pH 7.5, 25°C,<br>
1 bar). The maximal absorption or absorption capacity can be determined by routine<br>
methods known e.g. from F. L. Buchholz et al. "Modern Superabsorbent Polymer<br>
Technology", Wiley-VCH 1998, p. 153 (absorbent capacity method) or EP 993 337,<br>
example 6.<br>
Preferred superabsorbent polymers are those which have a moderate swelling rate, i.e.<br>
superabsorbents, wherein the time required to achieve 60% of the maximal absorption<br>
is at most 20 minutes, in particular from 1 to 10 minutes. These values can be<br>
determined according to standard methods as described in F. L. Buchholz et al., loc.<br>
cit., p. 154 (swelling kinetics methods).<br>
The superabsorbent polymers may be nonionic or ionic crosslinked polymers. For the<br>
purpose of the invention, the superabsorbent polymer is preferably selected from<br>
crosslinked anionic superabsorbent polymers, in particular from covalently crosslinked<br>
anionic superabsorbent polymers. A survey of suitable superabsorbent polymers is e.g.<br>
given in F. L. Buchholz et al., loc. cit., p. 11-14.<br>
Crosslinked anionic superabsorbent polymers are crosslinked polymers which<br>
comprise anionic functional groups or acidic groups, which can be neutralized in water,<br>
e.g. sulfonic acid groups (SO3H or SO3"), phosphonate groups (PO3H2 or PO32') or<br>
carboxylate groups (CO2H or CO2). These polymers are in principle obtainable by<br>
copolymerizing a monoethylenically unsaturated acidic monomer and a crosslinking<br><br>
monomer optionally in the presence of a grafting base and optionally in the presence of<br>
further neutral monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. In preferred superabsorbent<br>
polymers the carboxylate groups make up at least 80 mol-%, in particular at least<br>
95 mol-% of the acidic groups.<br>
Suitable acidic monomers include monoethylenically unsaturated mono- and<br>
dicarboxylic acids having preferably from 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, oc-chloroacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, maleic<br>
anhydride, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, aconitic acid<br>
and fumaric acid; monoesters of monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids<br>
having from 4 to 10 and preferably from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, for example monoesters<br>
of maleic acid such as monomethyl maleate; monoethylenically unsaturated sulfonic<br>
acids and phosphonic acids, for example vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, sulfoethyl<br>
acrylate, sulfoethyl methacrylate, sulfopropyl acrylate, sulfopropyl methacrylate,<br>
2-hydroxy-3-acryloyloxypropylsulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-methacryloyloxypropylsulfonic<br>
acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, vinylphosphonic<br>
acid and allylphosphonic acid and the salts, especially the sodium, potassium and<br>
ammonium salts, of these acids. The acidic monomers usually make up at least 15%,<br>
by weight, preferably at least 20% by weight, of the superabsorbent polymer, e.g. 15 to<br>
99.9% by weight, in particular from 20 to 99.8% by weight, based on the acidic form of<br>
the anionic superabsorbent polymer.<br>
Preference is given to crosslinked anionic superabsorbent polymers, wherein the<br>
polymerized acidic monomers comprise at least one monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acid CA or a salt thereof. Preferably the monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acid CA or the salt thereof accounts for at least 80 mol-%, in particular at<br>
least 95 mol-% of the total amount of polymerized acidic monomeres.<br>
Useful crosslinking monomers include compounds having at least two, for example 2,<br>
3, 4 or 5, ethylenically unsaturated double bonds in the molecule. These compounds<br>
are also referred to as crosslinker monomers. Examples of crosslinker monomers are<br>
N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, polyethylene glycol diacrylates and polyethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylates, each derived from polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight<br>
from 106 to 8500 and preferably from 400 to 2000, trimethylolpropane triacrylate,<br>
trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, butanediol<br>
diacrylate, butanediol dimethacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, hexanediol dimethacrylate,<br>

diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, dipropylene glycol diacrylate, dipropylene<br><br>
glycol dimethacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol dimethacrylate,<br>

oxide and propylene oxide, di-, tri-, tetra- or pentaacrylated or -methacrylated<br>
polyhydric alcohols, such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol or<br>
dipentaerythritol, esters of monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids with<br>
ethylenically unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol, cyclohexenol and<br>
dicyclopentenyl alcohol, e.g. allyl acrylate and allyl methacrylate, also triallylamine,<br>
dialkyldiallylammonium halides such as dimethyldiallylammonium chloride and<br>
diethyldiallylammonium chloride, tetraallylethylenediamine, divinylbenzene, diallyl<br>
phthalate, polyethylene glycol divinyl ethers of polyethylene glycols having a molecular<br>
weight from 106 to 4000, trimethylolpropane diallyl ether, butanediol divinyl ether,<br>
pentaerythritol triallyl ether, reaction products of 1 mol of ethylene glycol diglycidyl<br>
ether or polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether with 2 mol of pentaerythritol triallyl ether or<br>
allyl alcohol, and divinylethyleneurea. The amount of crosslinker monomer is preferably<br>
in the range from 0.1 to 10% by weight and especially in the range from 0.2 to 5% by<br>
weight, based on the weight of the superabsorbent polymer in the acidic form.<br>
Suitable grafting bases can be of natural or synthetic origin. They include oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides such as starches, i.e. native starches from the group consisting of<br>
corn (maize) starch, potato starch, wheat starch, rice starch, tapioca starch, sorghum<br>
starch, manioca starch, pea starch or mixtures thereof, modified starches, starch<br>
degradation products, for example oxidatively, enzymatically or hydrolytically degraded<br>
starches, dextrins, for example roast dextrins, and also lower oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides, for example cyclodextrins having from 4 to 8 ring members. Useful<br>
oligo- and polysaccharides further include cellulose and also starch and cellulose<br>
derivatives. It is also possible to use polyvinyl alcohols, homo- and copolymers of<br>
N-vinylpyrrolidone, polyamines, polyamides, hydrophilic polyesters or polyalkylene<br>
oxides, especially polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide as a grafting base. The<br>
amount of grafting base may be up to 50% by weight of the weight of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer in the acidic form, e.g. from 1 to 50% by weight. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the amount of grafting base is less than 10% by weight of the weight of<br>
the superabsorbent polymer in the acidic form, or the grafting base is virtually absent<br>
(
The monomers forming the superabsorbent polymer may also contain neutral<br>
monethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not have an acidic group. Examples<br>
are monoethylenically hydrophilic monomers, i.e. monomers having a water solubility of<br>
at least 80 g/l at 25°C 1 bar, including hydroxyalkyl esters of monoethylenically<br>
monocarboxylic acids, e.g. the hydroxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, such as<br><br>
hydroxyethylacrylate and hydroxyethylmethacrylate, amides of monoethylenically<br>
monocarboxylic acids such as acrylamide and methacrylamide, monomers having a<br>
polyether group, such as vinyl, allyl and methallyl ethers of polyethylene glycols and<br>
esters of monoethylenically monocarboxylic acids and polyethers, such as<br>
polyethylenglykol acrylate and polyethyleneglycol methacrylate. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention the neutral monomers make up from 10 to 84.9% by<br>
weight, in particular from 20 to 79.9% by weight of the superabsorbent polymer in the<br>
acidic form.<br>
Preferred anionic superabsorbent polymers have a moderate charge density, i.e. the<br>
amount of acidic groups in the superabsorbent polymer is preferably from 0.1 to 1.1<br>
mol per 100 g of superabsorbent polymer, in particular form 0.2 to 1 mol per 100 g of<br>
superabsorbent polymer, based on the weight of the superabsorbent polymer in the<br>
acidic form.<br>
In a very preferred embodiment of the invention, the superabsorbent polymer is a<br>

particular the potassium or sodium salts. Preferred monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids CA include mono-carboxylic acids having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, in<br>

Suitable amides of monoethylenically unsaturated acids are the amides of<br>
monoethylenically unsaturated mono-carboxylic acids having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, in<br>

Preferably, the carboxylic acid CA and the amide AM make up at least 80% by weight<br>
and more preferably at least 90% by weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers<br>

preparing the pesticide composition, is in the form of surface crosslinked polymer<br>
particles (see F.L. Buchholz, loc. cit. pp. 97 to 103, and the literature cited therein), in<br>
the surface crosslinked polymer particles some of the functional group in the surface<br>
region of the superabsorbent polymer granules have been crosslinked by reaction with<br>
polyfunctional compounds. Surface crosslinking can be a covalent or ionic crosslinking.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the superabsorbent polymer particles do not have a surface<br>
crosslinking.<br>
According to the invention, the pesticide composition further contains at least one filler<br>
material which is different from water and of course also different from the pesticide<br>
compound and the superabsorbent polymer P. The filler material is generally chosen<br>
from liquid, solid or semi-solid (e. g. pasty) materials, which, together with the water<br>
and the superabsorbent polymer P provides the pesticide composition with a gel-like or<br>
solid texture. The amount of filler material is preferably from 10 to 89.5% by weight, in<br>
particular from 15 to 84.5% by weight and more preferably from 20 to 79.5% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The filler material is generally an organic or inorganic material or a mixture organic and<br>
inorganic materials the filler material being solid, liquid or semisolid and having itself no<br>
or not a marked pesticidal activity. Of course, the filler material is different from water,<br>
the pesticide compound and the superabsorbent polymer.<br>
The filler material is preferably an organic material which is solid, liquid or semisolid,<br>
and which itself has no or not a marked pesticidal activity. Suitable filler materials<br>
include in particular organic materials that are present in gel formulations of pesticide<br>
compounds. Examples of typical fillers are attractants, co-formulants (i.e. organic<br>
material which is usually present in conventional pesticide formulations), means for<br>
adjusting the pH of the composition and inert carrier materials. Typical fillers include<br>
attractants and also co-formulants (i.e. organic material which is usually present in<br>
conventional pesticide formulations), and optionally means for adjusting the pH of the<br>
composition. However, the filler material may also include an inert carrier material<br>
which may be organic or inorganic.<br>
Preferably, the filler material comprises at least one material which renders the<br>
composition attractive to the pest to be controlled. Such components are also referred<br>
to as attractants. Attractants are non-pesticidal materials which may act in one or<br>
several of the following ways: a) entice the insect to approach the composition or the<br>
material treated with the composition; b) entice the insect to touch the composition or<br>
the material treated with the composition; c) entice the insect to consume the<br>
composition or the material treated with the composition; and d) entice the insect to<br>
return to the composition or the material treated with the composition. Suitable<br>
attractants include non-food attractants and food attractants, also termed as feeding<br>
stimulants.<br><br>
Suitable non-food attractants are usually volatile material. The volatile attractants act<br>
as a lure and their type will depend on the pest to be controlled in a known manner.<br>
Non-food attractants include:<br>
-	semiochemicals such as pheromones, in particular sex pheromones and<br>
aggregation pheromones, kairomones and<br>
-	flavours of natural or synthetic origin.<br>

acids, fatty alcohols, and their mixtures. Preference is given to a hydrophobic material<br>
which is of natural origin such as fats and oils and fatty acids of plant or animal origin,<br>

composition. In particular the acid may be present in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 2%<br>
by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight.<br>
Additionally, the pesticide compositions may comprise co-formulants (additives), i.e.<br>
compounds which are present in conventional pesticide formulations or which are<br>

gel, the amount of surfactant will generally not exceed 1 % by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the composition except for surface active compounds which are contained in<br>
the feeding stimulant and except for fatty acids. In a water dilutable composition the<br>

more preferably from 20 to 69.5% by weight. The amount of water is chosen in a<br>
manner to provide a gel-like or solid texture.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compositions are formulated<br>
as ready-to-use gels. The ready-to-use gels are applied directly and thus are<br>
formulated in a manner that allows an easy distribution to a location where the<br>
arthropod pests get into contact with the gel composition.<br>
Usually, the ready-to-use gel is usually applied by means of a suitable device which<br>
contains the ready-to-use gel. Suitable means are cartridge dispensers, collapsible<br>
tubes, and the like. The gels may also be contained in a bait box, which can be entered<br>
by the pest to be controlled. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a device<br>
such a cartridge dispenser, cartridges, syringes, bait boxes or a collapsible tube<br>
containing the ready-to-use gel of the present invention.<br>
In the ready-to-use gel according to the present invention, the filler material frequently<br>
contains a hydrophobic component, in particular a fat or oil or a mixture thereof with an<br>
alkanol or polyol as mentioned above. The amount of the hydrophobic component is as<br>
given above and is in particular from 1 to 50 % by weight more preferably from 3 to<br>
30% by weight of the ready-to-use gel.<br>
The ready-to-use gel is particularly suitable for combating insects which are prone to<br>
populate the habitat of human beings or farm animals. The ready-to-use gel is<br>
particularly useful for combating insects from the orders hymenoptera, blattodea,<br>
isoptera, diptera and lepidoptera, in particular for combating blattelidae and/or<br>
blattidae.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the composition is in the form of a<br>
water dilutable gel or solid, in particular a water dilutable gel. The gel can be easily<br>
diluted with water, thereby obtaining a virtually homogeneous aqueous spray broth,<br>
wherein the active ingredient is uniformly distributed.<br>
Such a water dilutable gel or solid usually comprises at least one surfactant in the<br>
amounts given above, in order to stabilize the uniform distribution of the pesticide<br>
compound in the dilution.<br>
Preferably, the water dilutable gel also contains at least one acid, more preferably at<br>
least one organic carboxylic acid as mentioned above, e.g. a carboxylic acid selected<br><br>
from the group of citric acid, malic acid, pyruvic acid and glycolic acid. The amount of<br>
carboxylic acid is preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the water dilutable gel or solid.<br>
Preferably, the water dilutable gel does contain only small amounts or even no fatty<br>
components as defined herein. In particular the amount of fatty components will not<br>
exceed 3 % by weight of the water dilutable gel. In the water dilutable gel, the attractant<br>
preferably comprises at least one feeding stimulant from the group of fruit, fruit juice,<br>
fruit extract or fruit juice extract, mono- or disaccharides, hydrogenated mono or<br>
disaccharides and water soluble protein sources such as protein hydrolysates or yeast<br>
autolysates. The water dilutable gel does may of course also contain one or more<br>
semiochemicals.<br>
The water dilutable gels are particularly used for combating plant damaging pests, in<br>
particular sucking piercing or chewing insects, e. g. insects of the orders hymenoptera,<br>
isoptera, diptera, coleoptera and Lepidoptera, in particular for combating insects of the<br>
orders diptera and coleoptera.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be easily prepared by routine methods<br>
of formulation techniques.<br>
Generally, the filler and optionally water is pre-charged in a mixing apparatus and the<br>
conventional formulation of the pesticide compound is added and the components are<br>
mixed. Further ingredients of the compositions may be added thereafter. The<br>
superabsorbent polymer can be added at any stage of this procedure. Preferably, the<br>
filler, at least a part of the water and the superabsorbent polymer is pre-charged and<br>
the formulation of the pesticide compound is added thereto with mixing. Optionally<br>
further water and further components such as the acid, dyes or pigments are added<br>
thereafter.<br>
Then, the components are homogenized to obtain a gel formulation. Thereafter, the gel<br>
formulation is packaged or, in the case of a ready-to-use gel may be confectioned, e.g.<br>
in a suitable device for direct application or a cartridge for a device for direct<br>
application.<br>
As mentioned above, the compositions of the present invention are useful for<br>
combating arthropod pests, in particular insects. Therefore, the present invention also<br>
relates to a method for combating arthropod pests which method comprises applying<br>
the composition of the present invention to a locus, where the arthropod pests gets into<br>
contact with the composition.<br><br>
When the composition is in the form of a ready-to-use gel, the composition is applied<br>
directly to a locus, where the pest is likely to occur and thus gets into contact with the<br>
gel composition. For example, the ready-to-use gel can be injected by means of a<br>
suitable device such as a syringe or cartridge injector, into hatcheries or brood nests of<br>
the pest to be controlled or applied to places, where the pest to be controlled is likely to<br>
travel around such as parts of buildings, e.g. the floor of rooms where the pest is likely<br>
to occur (kitchen, storage room for food stuffs), ventilation and supply ducts, but also to<br>
parts of plants to be protected against damage by said pests. In particular the<br>
compositions can be applied to areas where pests accumulate or reproduce such as<br>
rubbish bins, garbage dumpsters, refuse areas, land fill sites etc. It is also possible to<br>
load a bait box or bait station or a liner with the ready-to-use gel and place to bait box<br>
or bait station or liner, where the pest to be controlled is likely to occur or accumulate,<br>
e.g. on the grounds where the pest to be controlled travel around or near the plants or<br>
goods to be protected against infestation and damaging by the pest to be controlled.<br>
In case of the water-dilutable gels or solids, the composition is applied as an aqueous<br>
dilution, i.e. the composition will be diluted with water to obtain a sprayable aqueous<br>
liquid which contains the active ingredient (the aqueous liquid obtained by dilution is<br>
also termed as aqueous spray broth or aqueous dilution). The amount of water (on a<br>
volume base) which is used for diluting the composition is usually at least 1 time,<br>
frequently ate least 5 times, preferably at least 10 times, more preferably at least 50<br>
times, in particular at least 100 times of the volume of the composition. The amount of<br>
water naturally depends on the desired concentration of the active ingredient in the<br>
aqueous spray broth which on its part depends on the active ingredient and the pest to<br>
be controlled in an known manner. However, it should be taken into account, that in<br>
most cases the compositions of the present invention provides an increased activity<br>
and thus allows a reduction of the application rate. Frequently, the composition of the<br>
present invention allows a reduction of the application rate by at least 20%, in particular<br>
at least 50% of the application rate which is necessary when using a conventional<br>
formulation. In general, the pesticide concentration in the aqueous dilution will range<br>
from 1 to 3000 mg/L, in particular 10 to 2000 mg/L.<br>
The aqueous spray broth which is obtained by dilution of a water-dispersible gel or<br>
solid will be generally used to protect growing plants from attack or infestation by plant<br>
damaging pests, in particular plant damaging insects. In order to achieve control, the<br>
aqueous spray broth is applied to a locus where the arthropod pest gets into contact<br>
with said composition. Usually, the aqueous spray broth is applied to the habitat of the<br>
pest to be controlled, which may be the plant or parts of the plant itself such as stem,<br><br>
root and foliage, or the soil surrounding the plants to be controlled. Preferably, the<br>
aqueous dilution is applied to parts of plants to be protected. However, it is also<br>
possible to apply the aqueous spray broth to the breeding ground of the pest to be<br>
controlled.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also be used for protecting non-living<br>
goods, in particular wooden materials such as board, fences, sleepers, etc. and<br>
buildings such as houses, outhouses, factories, construction materials, furniture,<br>
leather, natural or synthetic fibers, plastic articles, isolation of electric wires and cables<br>
from pests are likely to damage theses materials such as ants and termites. The<br>
compositions can also be used for controlling ants and termites from doing harm to<br>
crops or human beings (e. g. when the pests invade into houses and public facilities).<br>
In order to achieve effective control, the composition can be applied either directly or as<br>
an aqueous spray liquor. The composition can be applied directly but it also can be<br>
applied to the surrounding soil surface or into the under-floor soil in order to achieve<br>
effective protection of the material.<br>

1. Activity against cockroach (compositions 1 .a to 1 .e)<br>
Laboratory experiments were conducted to compare the efficacy of the ready to use<br>
gels described in 11.1 in controlling adult males of the German cockroach, Blattella<br>
germanica, in the presence (choice test) of alternate food source.<br>
The baits were aged in the laboratory for 1, 2 or 3 months, respectively, by the<br>
following procedure: About 0.03 g or the respective gel was applied by means of a<br>
multi-dose applicator to a VWR polystyrene weighing dish (size micro). The thus<br>
prepared bait dishes were placed on a tray and placed inside a bottom cabinet in the<br>
laboratory. The baits were maintained in constant darkness at about 22°C.<br><br>
For bioassay, the roaches were starved for 24 hours (provided shelter and water, but<br>
not food) before the initiation of the test. Each treatment was repiicated 3 times with 20<br>
roaches per replicate. Plastic roach boxes with ventilated lids were used as test<br>
arenas. The top 3-4 cm of the arenas was treated with Vaseline and mineral oil to<br>
prevent roaches from escaping. Water was provided as needed. The cockroaches<br>
were placed in the boxes and starved for 24 hours prior to bait introduction. The<br>
weighing dishes containing about 0.03 grams of gel were placed into the boxes. The<br>
boxes were maintained at 22°C and observed daily for mortality of the cockroaches.<br>
Roach mortality was recorded daily and the dead individuals were removed. Results<br>
are shown in Tables 5a, 5b and 5c.<br><br><br><br>
2. Olfactory response of Bactrocera Oleae<br>
The olfactory responses of B. oleae adults to excised olive twigs sprayed with aqueous<br>
dilutions were determined by means of a wind tunnel olfactometer. The sprayed twigs<br>
were transferred into the wind tunnel olfactometer and the responses of adult olive flies<br>
to them was scored.<br>
The formulations were applied as aqueous dilutions. Formulations 2.a to 2.f and 3.a to<br>
3.f were diluted with water in a ratio 1:10 v/v. Formulation P1 was diluted with water in<br>
ratio 8.3:1000 v/v. Formulation P2 was diluted with water in ratio 34.7:1000 v/v. The<br>
dilutions were sprayed on two-year-old potted olive trees. Spray application was<br>
performed with a high volume back up sprayer and branches were sprayed to run off.<br>
After spraying the trees were transferred and maintained in a non heated greenhouse.<br>
Lateral windows of the green house remained open to ensure proper ventilation of the<br>
place. At certain time intervals after spraying (0, 3 and 7 days) twigs of the treated olive<br>
trees were cut off and transferred to the laboratory for the bioassays.<br>
The bioassays were conducted in a Plexiglas wind tunnel olfactometer. The<br>
olfactometer is a rectangular cage (2m length x 0.6 m width x 0.6 m height) made of<br>
plexiglas and having on each of the two opposite small sides a cylindrical opening to<br>
permit airflow. The cylindrical openings are closed with a wire screen to prevent the<br><br>
flies from escaping from the olfactometer. Fresh air pulled is into the cage by an<br>
exhaust fan, (connected to the upwind opening of the cage) and passed outside<br>
through a flexible aluminium tube (connected to the downwind opening). The top side<br>
of the cage has two cylindrical openings with Plexiglas covers, located 15 cm from<br>
each end of the chamber to facilitate transfer of the flies and olive twigs inside the<br>
chamber. Inside the chamber and 25cm from the upwind end a cylindrical wire screen<br>
cage was placed (15 cm in diameter and 40 cm height). The sides of the cage were<br>
covered with Tungel Foot glue. Inside the wire screen cage, olive twigs sprayed with<br>
the tested products were placed. 4 or 5 olive twigs 10 to 20 cm long were vertically<br>
fixed in the middle of the wire screen cage.<br>
The adult flies, which were used in the bioassays developed from egg through the adult<br>
inside olive fruits and maintained in wooden screen cages in the laboratory at 25±2°C<br>
and a photoperiod of 16:8 LD with a liquid diet (a mixture of water.sugar.yeast<br>
hydrolysate, 5:3:1). Twenty-four hours before the test, adult food was removed form the<br>
cages and the flies had access only to crystalline sugar and water. For each bioassay<br>
twenty adult olive flies (10 males and 10 females), 10 to 20 days old were used. The<br>
flies were first aspirated into a glass vial. The top of the vial was closed with a nylon<br>
mesh. Subsequently the vial with the flies was transferred to the insect release point in<br>
the down wind end of the wind tunnel. The flies were allowed to acclimate to the wind<br>
tunnel conditions for ten minutes before released from the bottle. During acclimation<br>
period the fan at the up wind end of the tunnel was operated.<br>
For the bioassay 20 adult female and male flies 10 to 15 days old were transferred into<br>
the olfactometer chamber in the down wind end. Half an hour later the exhaust fan was<br>
started to pump air inside the chamber and push it through the wire screen with the<br>
sprayed olive twigs to the flies and through the end opening outside the laboratory<br>
room. Air velocity inside the chamber varied from 0.5 to 0.9 m/sec. The operation of the<br>
fan was adjusted through a time controller to switch on and off every 10 minutes.<br>
During the bioassay the room temperature varied from 26°C to 28°C and the relative<br>
humidity from 39 to 60%.<br>
Twelve hours after transfer of the flies in the cages the number of the flies that<br>
responded to the sprayed olive twigs and trapped on the glued sides of the cage was<br>
scored. The percentage of the flies trapped on the sides of the cage was used as an<br>
index of the relative response of the flies to the different tested products. At the end of<br>
the bioassay the screen cage with olive branches was removed from the tunnel and the<br>
number of flies entrapped on the glue (i.e. flies attracted to baited branches) was<br><br>
recorded. The sides of the tunnel, the wire mesh and the fan blades were thoroughly<br>
cleaned with ethanol and the room was properly aerated before the next bioassay.<br>
The flies' response to olive twigs sprayed with water was used as the control treatment.<br>
The tests were performed 3-5 hours after spraying, 3 d after spraying and 7 d after<br>
spraying. The results are given in tables 6a, 6b and 6c.<br>
Table 6a. Olfactory responses of adult flies of Bactrocera oleae to treated olive 3-5<br>
hours after spraying (% response : Percentage of adult flies attracted to olive twigs<br>
sprayed with the tested products)<br><br><br><br><br>
3. Activity against Ceratitis capitata<br>
The composition to be tested was diluted with 10 times of water (on a volume base). 1<br>
ml of the obtained dilution was applied (in the C and D trials 0,5 mL were applied) at a<br>
concentration of 25% on a circle of filter paper (diameter 9 cm). The treated circle was<br>
placed on a petri dish. 5 individuals of Ceratitis capitata were placed in each. The Petri<br>
dishes were closed and the mortality was registered at T+1, T+6, T+24 and T+48 h,<br>
with 4 replications. This trial was made four times. The age of the flies was 2 days<br>
except in the A trial where it was 4 days. The results are given in tables 7a to 7d.<br><br><br><br>
4. Activity against adults of Diabrotica virgifera<br>
The tests were run as field trials in separate allotments of 12 m x 200 m containing an<br>
appropriate number of corn plants (closeness of planting about 80,000 to 90,000 plants<br>
per hectare). The plants showed an average infestation with diabrotica adults. Aqueous<br>
spray liquors were prepared by diluting 1 L of the respective formulation with 34 L<br>
ofwater. Plants were sprayed with an aqueous spray liquor at an application rate of<br>
35 l/ha. Application was done at the VT-stage of the corn plants (tassel stage). The<br>
number of surviving diabrotica individuals were counted at 2 days after treatment (DAT)<br>
and 7 DAT and compared with the number of diabrotica individuals at that time in the<br>
untreated control allotment. From these numbers efficacies were calculated by Abbot's<br>
formula:<br><br>
x = number of insect individuals in the treated allotment<br><br><br>
5. Activity against cockroach (compositions 1 .f to 1 .m)<br>
Laboratory experiments were conducted to compare the efficacy of the ready to use<br>
gels described in 11.1.2 in controlling adult males of the German cockroach, Blattella<br>
germanica, in the presence (choice test) of alternate food source.<br>
The baits were aged in the laboratory for 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks, respectively, by the<br>
following procedure: About 0.5 g or the respective gel was applied by means of a multi-<br>
dose applicator to a VWR polystyrene weighing dish (size micro). The thus prepared<br>
bait dishes were placed on a tray and placed inside a bottom cabinet in the laboratory.<br>
The baits were maintained in constant darkness at about 22°C.<br>
For bioassay, the roaches were starved for 24 hours (provided shelter and water, but<br>
not food) before the initiation of the test. Each treatment was replicated 3 times with 5<br>
roaches per replicate. Disposable plastic containers were used as test arenas. The top<br>
3-4 cm of the arenas was treated with Vaseline and mineral oil to prevent roaches from<br>
escaping. The containers were provided with a water-soaked cotton dental wick. The<br>
cockroaches were placed in the boxes and starved for 24 hours prior to bait<br>
introduction. The weighing dishes containing about 0.5 grams of gel were placed into<br>
the boxes. The boxes were maintained at 22°C and observed daily for mortality of the<br>
cockroaches. Roach mortality was recorded after 4 h and 1 day and the dead<br>
individuals were removed. Results are shown in tables 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d.<br>

are suitable for combating arthropod pests, in particular insects. The pesticide composition in the form of a gel or solid contains: i)<br>
0.001 to 50% by weight of at least one pesticide compound which is effective against arthropod pest, ii) 0.5 to 20% by weight of at<br>
least one superabsorbent polymer P having an absorption capacity for deionised water of at least 100 g per 1 g of polymer P, and iii)<br>
5 to 94.5% by weight of at least one filler material different from water, and iv) 5 to 94.5% by weight of water, wherein the % by<br>
weight are based on the total weight of the composition. The present invention also relates to the use of the pesticide compositions<br>
as described herein for combating arthropod pests and to a method for combating arthropod pests, which comprises applying a gel<br>
composition as defined herein either directly or as an aqueous dilution to a location where the arthropod pest gets into contact with<br>
said composition.</td>
