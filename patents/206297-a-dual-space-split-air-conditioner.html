This  invention  relates  to a dual  space  split  air<br>
conditioner-<br>
A split air conditioner is known. It consists of an indoor unit which is kept inside the space or room to be cooled- It also consists of an outdoor unit which is kept outside the said space or room, in the ambi ent. The known split air conditioner can cool only one space.<br>
On the other hand the dual space split air conditioner proposed herein is capable of cooling one space or room', it is also capable of working as two air conditioners for cooling two separate spaces or rooms, simultaneously- In either case, the outdoor unit is the same, operating along with one of the two indoor units  or  with both outdoor units, at the  same  time•<br>
Split  air conditioners with two indoor units and  one outdoor unit are available in the market•  However, the outdoor  unit  actually consists of two  outdoor  units accommodated in the same outdoor housing.<br><br>
In the dual space split air conditioner proposed herein, an outdoor unit and and a matching indoor unit are provided, along with an additional matching indoor unit of similar capacity. Thus, if the outdoor unit is of 1-5 TR capacity, each of the indoor units will be of 1.5 TR capacity. If only one indoor unit is used, it will operate at 1.5 TR capacity} but if both the indoor units are employed, each indoor unit will operate at 0.75 TR capacity.<br>
Thus, when one indoor unit is used, the proposed air conditioner will cool to, say,25 deg.C, at full 1.5 TR capacity (ambient being, say, 40 deg.C), while when both indoor units are used, the said air conditioner will cool to,say, sSb deg.C in each space or room (ambient temperature being assumed to be the same 40 deg.C). In other words, when both indoor units are operating, the cooling may not be the same in each space or room, as would otherwise be available at full 1.5 TR capacity. However, the said air conditioner will still be able to maintain a fairly comfortable level  of cooling, say , deg.C below ambient, in  each<br><br>
of the spaces or rooms-<br>
In the above case, when both indoor units are functioning, the ratio of sharing has been given as 50:50, Other ratios are possible e.g. 40860. However, 50:50 is/practicable.<br>
The dual space split air conditioner, according to this invention, comprises two indoor units for being respectively installed in two separate compartments, thermally insulated from each other, each indoor unit comprising a rotary switch, a blower motor, a relay and a solenoid valve, the relay terminals of each such indoor unit being connected across a corresponding preset resistor incorporated in a line of the blower motor, and the relay coi1 of each such indoor unit being connected to the other indoor unit} an outdoor unit installed outside the said compartments and connected to the indoor units, the blower motor, the relay, the solenoid valve of each indoor unit, as wel1 as the compressor and condenser fan motor of the outdoor unit receiving electric power from a source through the respective rotary switches.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference  to<br>
the  accompanying drawings which illustrate by  way of<br>
example,  and not by way of  1 imitation, one of  various<br>
possible  embodiments of  the  dual  space  split  air<br>
conditioner proposed herein,  wherein<br>
Fig.  1 i1lustrates the general layout diagram  of  the<br>
embodiment<br>
and<br>
Fig.2 illustrates a drawing of the salient  connections<br>
between the two indoor units and the outdoor unit.<br>
The embodiment i1lustrated will be seen to comprise two indoor units, generally indicated by lU for being respectively installed in two separate cooling compartments (spaces or rooms) CQ.thermally insulated from each other e.g. by the partitions P-<br>
Each indoor unit comprises a rotary switch S, a blower motor BM a relay R and a solenoid valve V. The relay terminals T of each such unit are connected across a corresponding pre-set resistor, X incorporated in a line  of  each of the blower motors BM. The coil  Y  of<br><br>
each such relay is connected to the other uni t-<br>
When the rotary switch in one room (Room A) is in C posi tion, it will enerQise the relay in the other room (Room B) thereby breaking its (Relay in Room B) circuit. Hence blower motor of that room (Room B) will be connected to the power source (if rotary switch in that room i-e. Room B is in C position) via the preset resistor and hence its speed will be reduced to the predetermined value (according to its preset resistance)- The converse is also true-Thus the rotary swi tch of one room will be responsible for turning ON or OFF of the blower motor of that room while its speed (full or reduced speed) will be determined by the rotary swi tch of the other room - When rotary switch of one room is turned to the cooling mode (position C) its blower motor wi11 run at ful1 speed providing all the cooling (1-5 TR) unless the rotary switch is also turned cooling mode (posi t ion C) when both blower motors will run at reduced speed each providing roughly half of the cooling (0.75 TR each) or at  the predetermined ratio say 60:40 depending on  the<br><br>
preset resistor in each room-<br>
An outdoor unit is installed outside the said compartments (in the ambient) and connected to the indoor units, the blower motor, the relay, the solenoid valve of each indoor unit, as well as the compressor D and condenser fan motor M of the outdoor unit receiving electric power from a source through the respective rotary switches S.<br>
The rotary switch S of each indoor unit will have these posi tions namely OFF (A) air circulation ON (B) and cooling ON (C)« For the cooling to be on, the air circulation must necessarily be ON. Each indoor unit is to be operated either at full capacity or at about half of its rated capacity. This can be achieved by any method, not restricting to reducing the air flow either by lowering the blower speed or by by-pass mechanism. In this example, we will have two pre-set blower speeds, higher speed for matching capacity of each indoor unit (to that of the outdoor unit), and lower speed for nearly half of that. The mode of operation to   be   achieved   is   illustrated   in   Table   1.<br><br>
TABLE   1<br>
Table 1. Modes of Operation of Dunt Space Split Air Conditioner<br><br>
# A:OFF,   B: Air circulation is ON and C: Air ciruclation and Cooling are ON<br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention to exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described since various other embodiments of the air conditioner proposed herein are possible without departure from the same and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
