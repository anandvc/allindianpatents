3,10, AND 12a SUBSTITUTED TETRACYCLINE COMPOUNDS<br>
Related Application<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/395,696, "3, 10 and 12a Substituted Tetracycline Compounds" filed on July 12, 2002, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The development of the tetracycline antibiotics was the direct result of a systematic screening of soil specimens collected from many parts of the world for evidence of microorganisms capable of producing bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions. The first of these novel compounds was introduced in 1948 under the name chlortetracycline. Two years later, oxytetracycline became available. The elucidation of the chemical stmcture of these compounds confirmed their similarity and fumished the analytical basis for the production of a third member of this group in 1952, tetracycline. A new family of tetracycline compounds, without the ring-attached methyl group present in earlier tetracyclines, was prepared in 1957 and became publicly available in 1967; and minocycline was in use by 1972.<br>
Recently, research efforts have focused on developing new tetracycline antibiotic compositions effective under varying therapeutic conditions and routes of administration. New tetracycline analogues have also been investigated which may prove to be equal to or more effective than the originally introduced tetracycline compounds. Examples include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,980,584; 2,990,331; 3,062,717; 3,165,531; 3,454,697; 3,557,280; 3,674,859; 3,957,980; 4,018,889; 4,024,272; and 4,126,680. These patents are representative of the range of pharmaceutically active tetracycline and tetracycline analogue compositions.<br>
Historically, soon after their initial development and introduction, the tetracyclines were found to be highly effective pharmacologically against rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, and psittacosis. Hence, tetracyclines became known as "broad spectrum" antibiotics. With the subsequent establishment of their in vitro antimicrobial activity, effectiveness in experimental infections, and pharmacological properties, the tetracyclines as a class rapidly became widely used for therapeutic purposes. However, this widespread use of tetracyclines for both major and minor illnesses and diseases led directly to the emergence of resistance to these antibiotics even among highly susceptible bacterial species both commensal and pathogenic (e.g., pneumococci and Salmonella). The rise of tetracycline-resistant<br><br>
organisms has resulted in a general decline in use of tetracyclines and tetracycline analogue compositions as antibiotics of choice.<br><br>

The 3-position, 10-position and 12a-position are shown on the tetracycline structure below.<br><br>
The term "derivatizing" includes changing the substituents at the 3-, 10-, and/or 12a position to a substituent other than hydroxyl. The tetracycline compoxmd maybe derivatized by contacting it with an appropriate base under appropriate conditions.<br><br>
Examples of appropriate bases include bases which are capable of deprotonating the 3-, 10-, and/or 12a hydroxyl groups. Examples of such bases include sodium hydride. Preferably, the base is selectively deprotonates the tetracycline compound at a particular position, such that the resulting derivatized tetracycline compound is relatively free of positional isomers. Other bases which may be used include potassium hydride and sodium hydroxide.<br>
The term "appropriate first conditions" include conditions in which the base can interact with the tetracycline compound, and deprotonate the desired hydroxyl group. In one embodiment, the appropriate first conditions comprise an aprotic solvent. Examples of suitable solvents include dimethylformamide (DMF), and other aprotic solvents. The appropriate first conditions may also comprise altering the temperature of the reaction components. In certain embodiments, the tetracycline compound and the appropriate base are allowed to react at room temperature for an appropriate length of time. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to use art recognized techniques to determine the length of time needed to allow the reaction to near completion. Preferably, the appropriate first conditions are selected such that the solvent and the atmosphere are inert to the tetracychne compound and base.<br>
The term "derivatizing agent" includes agents which can react with the tetracycline compoimd (after being treated with an appropriate base), to form a derivatized tetracycline compound (e.g., a tetracycline compound with a substituent at the 3,10, or 12a position). Examples of derivatizing agents include, but are not limited to, alkyl hahdes, alkenyl halides, alkcynyl halides, acid halides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, esters, carbonates, silyl halides (e.g., silyl chlorides), ketones, aldehydes, Mannich bases, diazonium compounds, and their salts.<br>
The term "appropriate second conditions" include conditions which allow derivatizing agents to interact with tetracycline compounds (optionally deprotonated) to form derivatized tetracycline compounds. Preferably, the appropriate first conditions are selected such that the conditions (including, for example, the solvent and the atmosphere) are inert to the derivatizing agent, the tetracycline compound, and the base. In certain embodiments, the appropriate second conditions may be the same, different, or partially the same and partially different than the appropriate first conditions. For example, in certain embodiments, the appropriate second conditions may comprise heating the reaction mixture. An ordinarily skilled artisan will be able to determine using art recognized techniques the appropriate length of time and temperature for the reaction to take place.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention pertains to a method for dederivatizing a derivatized tetracycline compound (e.g., a tetracycline compound derivatized at the 3-position, 10-position, and/or 12a-position). The method includes<br><br>
contacting a derivatized tetracycline compound with an appropriate dederivatizing agent under appropriate conditions, such that derivatized tetracycline compound is dederivatized.<br>
Examples of dederivatizing agents include agents which can alter the derivatized tetracycline compounds to tetracycline compound without the derivatization at one or more positions of the tetracycline molecule. Examples of such agents include, for example, acids, or other hydrolysis or deprotection methods known in the art. In certain embodiments, substituents at position 3,10, and/or 12a are hydroxyl or O- after being treated with a dederivatizing agent under appropriate conditions.<br>
The term "appropriate conditions" include reaction conditions (e.g., atmosphere, solvent, temperature, tune, etc.) which allow the reaction to take place. An ordinarily skilled artisan will be able to manipulate the reaction conditions to obtain a desired result.<br>
In certain embodiments, the tetracycline compounds may be dederivatized after altering one or more substituents on the tetracycline compound. The substituents which may be altered include any substituent which can be altered on the tetracycline compound. Examples of such reactions which can be done on the derivatized or underivatized tetracycline compound include those described in, for example, U.S.S.N. 09/895,857; U.S.S.N. 09/895,812; U.S. 5,326,759; U.S. 5,328,902; U.S. 5,495,031; U.S. 5,495,018; U.S. 5,495,030; U.S. 5,495,032; U.S. 5,512,553; U.S. 5,675,030; U.S. 5,843,925; U.S. 5,886,175; U.S. 6,165,999; U.S. 3,239,499; WO 95/22529; U.S. 5,064,821; U.S. 5,589,470; and U.S. 5,811,412, all incorporated herein by reference.

The term alkyl further includes alkyl groups, which can further include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous atoms replacing one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has 6 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain), and more preferably 4 or fewer. Likewise, preferred cycloalkyls have from 3-8 carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have 5 or 6 carbons in the ring structure. The term C1-C6 includes alkyl groups containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Moreover, the term alkyl includes both "imsubstituted alkyls" and "substituted alkyls", the latter of which refers to alkyl moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. Such substituents can include, for example, alkenyl, alkynyl, halogen, hydroxyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, aikylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyl, phosphate, phosphonato, phospliinato, cyano, amino (including alkyl amino, dialkylamino, axylamino, diarylamino, and alkylarylamino), acylamino (including alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, carbamoyl and ureido), amidino, imino, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, arylthio, thiocarboxylate, sulfates, alkylsulfinyl, sulfonato, sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, azido, heterocyclyl, alkylaryl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety. Cycloalkyls can be further substituted, e,g,, with the substituents described above. An "alkylaryl" or an "arylalkyl" moiety is an alkyl substituted with an aryl (e.g., phenylmethyl (benzyl)). The term "alkyl" also includes the side chains of natural and unnatural amino acids.<br>
The term "aryl" includes groups, including 5- and 6-membered single-ring aromatic groups that may include from zero to four heteroatoms, for example, benzene, phenyl, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, thiazole, isothiaozole, imidazole, triazole, tetrazole, pyrazole, oxazole, isooxazole, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, and pyrimidine, and the like. Furthermore, the term "aryl" includes multicyclic aryl groups, e.g., tricyclic, bicyclic, e.g., naphthalene, benzoxazole, benzodioxazole, benzothiazole, benzoimidazole, benzothiophene, methylenedioxophenyl, quinoline, isoquinoline, naphthridine, indole, benzofuran, purine, benzofiuran, deazapurine, or indolizine. Those aryl groups having heteroatoms in the ring structure may also be referred to as "aryl heterocycles", "heterocycles," "heteroaryls" or "heteroaromatics". The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more ring positions with such substituents as described above, as for example, halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, alkylaminoacarbonyl, arylalkyl aminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, arylalkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, phosphate, phosphonato, phosphinato, cyano, amino (including alkyl amino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, and alkylarylamino), acylamino (including alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, carbamoyl and ureido), amidino, imino, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, arylthio, thiocarboxylate, sulfates, alkylsulfinyl, sulfonato, sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, azido, heterocyclyl, alkylaryl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety. Aryl groups can also be fused or bridged with<br><br>

The antibiotic activity of the tetracycline compounds of the invention may be determined using the method discussed in Example 2, or by using the in vitro standard broth dilution method described in Waitz, J.A., National Commission for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Document M7-A2, vol, 10, no. 8, pp. 13-20, 2nd edition, Villanova, PA (1990).<br>
The tetracycline compounds may also be used to treat infections traditionally treated with tetracycline compounds such as, for example, rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, psittacosis. The tetracycline compounds may be used to treat infections of, e.g., K. pneumoniae. Salmonella E, hirae, A. baumanii, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E.faecium, E, coli, S. aureus or E.faecalis. In one embodiment, the tetracycline compound is used to treat a bacterial infection that is resistant to other tetracycline antibiotic compounds. The tetracycline compound of the invention may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "effective amount" of the compound is that amount necessary or sufficient to treat or prevent a tetracycline compound responsive state. The effective amount can vary depending on such factors as the size and weight of the subject, the type of illness, or the particular tetracycline compound. For example, the choice of the tetracycline compound can affect what constitutes an "effective amount". One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to study the aforementioned factors and make the determination regarding the effective amount of the tetracycline compound without xmdue experimentation.<br>
The invention also pertains to methods of treatment against microorganism infections and associated diseases. The methods include administration of an effective amount of one or more tetracycline compounds to a subject. The subject can be either a plant or, advantageously, an animal, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human.<br>
In the therapeutic methods of the invention, one or more tetracycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone to a subject, or more typically a compound of the invention will be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition in mixture with conventional excipient, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, oral or other desired administration and which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds and are not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br><br>
The invention also pertains to phannaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a tetracycline compound (e.g., a 3, 10, and/or 12a substituted tetracycline compound) and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes substances tapable of being coadministered with the tetracycline compound(s), and which allow both to perform their intended function, e.g., treat or prevent a tetracycline responsive state. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc. The phannaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if iesired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting igents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds of the invention.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the tetracycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are those that form non¬toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, sthanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and palmoate [i.e., 1,1'-[nethylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, it is often iesirable in practice to initially isolate a tetracycline compound of the invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the [atter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the :hoseu mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the isolvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be<br><br>
accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of base salts. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of those tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such pharmaceutically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower alkanolammonium and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines. The pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature may be formed with pharmaceutically acceptable cations by conventional methods. Thus, these salts may be readily prepared by treating the tetracycline compound of the invention with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutically acceptable cation and evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, a lower alkyl alcohol solution of the tetracycline compound of the invention may be mixed with an alkoxide of the desired metal and the solution subsequently evaporated to dryness.<br>
The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered via either the oral, parenteral or topical routes. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in effective dosages, depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. Variations may occur depending upon tiie species of the subject being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other known compositions for treating tetracycline responsive states in a subject, e.g., a mammal. Preferred mammals include pets (e.g., cats, dogs, ferrets, etc), farm animals (cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, etc.), lab animals (rats, mice, monkeys, etc.), and primates (chimpanzees, humans, gorillas). The language "in combination with" a known composition is intended to include simultaneous administration of the composition of the invention and the known composition, administration of the composition of the invention first, followed by the known . composition and administration of the known composition first, followed by the composition of the invention. Any of the therapeutically composition known in the art for treating tetracycline responsive states can be used in the methods of the invention.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by any of the routes previously mentioned, and the administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. For example, the novel therapeutic agents of this invention can be administered advantageously in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the therapeutically-effective compounds of this invention are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br>
For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably com, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active .   ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br><br>
For parenteral administration (including intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal or intramuscular injection), solutions of a therapeutic compound of the present invention in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For parenteral application, examples of suitable preparations include solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. Therapeutic compounds may be formulated in sterile form in multiple or single dose formats such as being dispersed in a fluid carrier such as sterile physiological saline or 5% saline dextrose solutions commonly used with injectables.<br>
Additionally, it is also possible to administer the compounds of the present invention topically when treating inflammatory conditions of the skin. Examples of methods of topical administration include transdermal, buccal or sublingual application. For topical applications, therapeutic compounds can be suitably admixed in a pharmacologically inert topical carrier such as a gel, an ointment, a lotion or a cream. Such topical carriers include water, glycerol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters, or mineral oils. Other possible topical carriers are liquid petrolatum, isopropylpalmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol 95%, polyoxyethylene. monolauriate 5% in water, sodium lauryl sulfate 5% in water, and the like. In addition, materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers and the like also may be added if desired.<br>
For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees or capsules having talc and/or carbohydrate carrier binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and/or com starch and/or potato starch. A symp, elixir or the hke can be used wherein a sweetened vehicle is employed. Sustained release compositions can be formulated including those wherein the active component is derivatized with differentially degradable coatings, e.g., by microencapsulation, multiple coatings, etc.<br>
In addition to treatment of human subjects, the therapeutic methods of the invention also will have significant veterinary applications, e.g. for treatment of livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, cows, swine and the like; poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys and the like; horses; and pets such as dogs and cats. Also, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat non-animal subjects, such as plants.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that the actual preferred amounts of active compounds used in a given therapy will vary according to the specific compound being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, the particular site of administration, etc. Optimal administration rates for a given protocol of administration can be readily ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage determination tests conducted with regard to the foregoing guidelines.<br>
In general, compounds of the invention for treatment can be administered to a subject in dosages used in prior tetracycline therapies. See, for example, the Physicians' Desk Reference, For example, a suitable effective dose of one or more compounds of the invention will be in the range of from 0.01 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of recipient per day, preferably in the range of from 0.1 to 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight of recipient per day, more preferably in the range of 1 to 20 milligrams per kilogram body weight of recipient per day. The desired dose is suitably administered once daily, or several sub-doses, e.g. 2 to 5 sub-doses, are administered at appropriate intervals through the day, or other appropriate schedule. It will also be understood that normal, conventionally known precautions will be taken regarding the administration of tetracyclines generally to ensure their efficacy under normal use circumstances. Especially when employed for therapeutic treatment of humans and animals in vivo, the practitioner should take all sensible precautions to avoid conventionally known contradictions and toxic effects. Thus, the conventionally recognized adverse reactions of gastrointestinal distress and inflammations, the renal toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, changes in blood, and impairment of absorption through aluminum, calcium, and magnesium ions should be duly considered in the conventional manner.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also pertains to the use of a tetracycline compound of formula I, for the preparation of a medicament. The medicament may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and the tetracycline compound is an effective amount, e,g,, an effective amount to treat a tetracycline responsive state.<br><br>
