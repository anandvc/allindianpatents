				<td>Background Of The Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to the manufacture of soft contact lenses using a polymerizable<br>
monomer or monomer mixture. More specifically, the invention relates to methods and<br>
apparatus for moving lens arriers in such a manufacturing process. Even more specifically,<br>
the invention relates to such methods and apparatus that are particularly well suited for moving<br>
the tens carriers through pre-curing and curing stations.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Over the last several years, systems have been successfully developed for the automated,<br>
mass production of soft contact lenses using a direct molding process. One such system is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,220,845, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein<br>
in its entirety by reference.<br>
Generally, in the system disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,220,845, each lens is formed by<br>
sandwiching a monomer between back and front mold halves. The monomer is polymerized,<br>
thus forming a lens that is then removed from the mold halves, further treated, and packaged<br>
for consumer use. In order to polymerize the monomer, it has been found advantageous to<br>
pass the monomer through both a pre-cure and a curing step.<br>
In the pre-cure step, the mold halves are held together under pressure while the polymerization<br>
is begun. Typically, the monomer composition includes initiators that work upon exposure to<br>
ultraviolet or visible radiation; and, in the pre-cure step, while the mold halves are held together,<br>
the composition is exposed to such radiation of an intensity and duration effective to initiate<br>
polymerization. After the pre-cure step, the monomer is again exposed to ultraviolet or visible<br>
radiation in a cure step in which the polymerization is permitted to proceed to completion.<br>
More than one lens can be cured at a time, and the throughput of the lens manufacturing<br>
process can be increased by increasing the number of lenses being cured at the same time.<br>
Simply increasing the number of lenses being cured at one time is complicated, however, by<br>
several factors. For example, as this number increases, the size of the area or areas needed<br>
for the pre-cure and curing also tends to increase, and other design constraints or<br>
considerations may limit the size of this area or areas. In addition, as the number of lenses that<br>
are in the pre-cure and cure areas increases, the design and operation of the article handling<br>
apparatus used to move all of these lenses into, through, and out of these areas may become<br>
excessively complicated.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
An object of this, invention is to provide pre-cure and curing stations, in a system for molding<br>
soft contact lenses, that are compact and yet can also handle a large volume of lenses.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to improve methods and apparatus for handling lens<br>
carriers in pre-cure and curing station of a lens manufacturing system.<br>
A further object of the invention is to locate article handling eauipment beneath the floors of pre-<br>
cure and curing stations of a contact lens manufacturing system, and thereby to reduce the<br>
required size of the footprint of the floors while still being able to move the lenses through the<br>
stations in a highly effective and efficient manner.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a curing station, in a system for molding soft contact<br>
lenses, with an intelligent buffer.<br>
A still another object of this invention is to hold a variable number of contact tenses in a curing<br>
station of a soft contact lens manufacturing system, to help the system accommodate<br>
temporary interruptions, or other changes, in the operation of other stations or subsystems of<br>
the system.<br>
These and other objectives are attained with novel methods and apparatus for handling carriers<br>
for soft contact lenses in a lens manufacturing system. In accordance with a first aspect of the<br>
invention, article handling devices are located beneath a pre-cure station and a curing station of<br>
the system to move lens carriers within those stations. As a result of locating these devices<br>
beneath these stations, the desired movement of the carriers can be achieved without<br>
increasing the footprint of the station. Pursuant to a second aspect of the invention, a complete<br>
set of assemblies is provided for moving a multitude of lens carriers into, through and out from<br>
The pre-cure station and the curing station. This set of assemblies accomplishes this movement<br>
in a completely automated, high speed, mass production basis. In accordance with a third<br>
aspect of the invention, the curing station is provided with an intelligent buffer. This buffer<br>
allows the lens carriers to accumulate in the curing station, and then discharges the carriers<br>
from the station in an ordered manner at the appropriate time. This enables the output or<br>
throughput of the curing station to be controlled or adjusted to accommodate changing<br>
conditions or circumstances occurring in the manufacturing system downstream of the curing<br>
station.<br>
Further benefits and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of<br>
the following detailed description, given with reference to the accompanying drawings, which<br>
specify and show preferred embodiments of the invention. <br>

Detailed Description Of The Preferred Embodiments <br>
Figure 1 generally illustrates a system 100 for manufacturing soft contact lenses from a<br>
polymerizable monomer or monomer mixture. The soft contact lenses are formed in a mold<br>
assembly having a first concave mold and a second, convex mold half. The mold halves<br>
themselves are molded in an injection molding machine, schematically represented at 102, and<br>
formed of polystyrene transparent to visible and ultraviolet light. The mold is thin enough to<br>
transmit heat rapidly and has sufficient rigidity to withstand prying forces applied to separate the<br>
mold halves during demolding.<br>
From the injection molding machine 102, the mold halves are deposited in pallets or carriers<br>
104. In particular, the front mold halves are placed in a first group of carriers, and the second<br>
mold halves are placed in a second group of carriers. Each carrier is designed to receive a<br>
number, such as eight, of these mold halves; and after receiving the mold halves, these carriers<br>
are conveyed from the injection mold area. At a dosing area 106, a polymerizable mixture is<br>
then dosed, onto the front curve mold halves; and subsequently, at deposition area 108, the<br>
front mold halves are covered with the base mold halves.<br>
The carriers are then conveyed to a pre-cure area 110. The mold halves are clamped together,<br>
and the monomer or monomer mixture is then exposed to actinic light, preferably from a UV<br>
lamp. At the completion of the pre-cure step, the monomer or monomer mixture has formed a<br>
partially polymerized gel, with polymerization initiated throughout the mixture.<br>
Following the pre-cure step, the lens carriers are moved to a UV oven 112 where the<br>
monomer/diluent mixture is cured whereby polymerization of the monomer is completed. This<br>
irradiation with actinic, visible or ultraviolet radiation and heat produces a polymer diluent<br>
mixture in the shape of the final desired hydrogel lens. After the polymerization process is<br>
completed, the lens carriers are conveyed to a demolding station 114, where the mold halves<br>
are separated, typically leaving the contact lens on the first, or front, mold half, from which it is<br>
subsequently removed. The front and base curve mold halves are used for a single lens<br>
molding and then discarded or disposed of. After the demolding step, the solvent is displaced<br>
with water to produce a hydrated lens. The lenses may be further treated, and are packaged for<br>
consumer use.<br>
The present invention provides novel apparatus and methods for moving the lens carriers into,<br>
through and from the pre-cure and the curing stations 110 and 112. In its preferred form, the<br>
invention comprises first and second sets of article handling devices. The first set 116 of<br>
devices is used to form a first array 120 of lens carriers in, and to move that array of carriers<br>
through, the pre-cure area 110. The second set 122 of devices is used to form a second array<br>
124 of carriers in, and to move this array of carriers through, the curing area 112.<br><br>
The first set 116 of article handling devices includes assemblies 126,130,132 (shown in<br>
Figures 7-9) and 134; and the second set 122 of article handling devices includes assemblies<br>
136,140,212,234, 334 and 142. Generally, assembly 126 is provided for assembling a group<br>
of lens carriers into a row in a first position 144, with neighboring carriers in the row contiguous<br>
to each other; and assembly 130 is used to move this row of lens carriers from that first position<br>
and into the pre-cure area 110. Assembly 132 is provided for moving and preferably providing<br>
spacing between the row of carriers across the pre-cure area and into a final row position<br>
therein, and assembly 134 is used to move the row of lens carriers from that final position and<br>
out of the pre-cure area. Assembly 136 is provided for forming a row of lens carriers in a first<br>
position 194 in the curing area 112, with neighboring carriers in this row contiguous to each<br>
other; assembly 140 is preferably used to move this row of carriers through a sequence of<br>
positions in the curing area by repeatedly pushing the first row of carriers in position 194 into the<br>
position adjacent to position 194. When the array is full or the control means directs assembly<br>
212 to move the row furthest to the right into position 211, then assemblies 334 and 142 are<br>
provided for moving the carriers in row 211 to row 196 and out of the curing area.<br>
Preferably, assembly 140 pushes the carriers in row 194 over one row and then assembly 140<br>
returns to its original position until row 194 again has carriers moved into it by assembly 136.<br>
Preferably when there are six carriers present in row 194, assembly 140 will push the carriers in<br>
row 194 again, and in this way row-by-row, assembly 140 will push first one row, then two rows,<br>
then three rows to form an array 124, and when fully operational multiple rows (up to eleven as<br>
shown) in the array. The row of carriers pushed furthest to the right in array 124 preferably to<br>
position 199 or position 210 or to any of the positions between positions 199 and 210.<br>
Alternatively in a different embodimen assembly 140 could be used to push the carriers in the<br>
row furthest to the right to row 196 control means, schematically represented at 150, may be<br>
provided to control and to coordinate oplration of the above-identified assemblies. Control<br>
means is preferably a programmable logic controller. <br>
Assembly 126 is shown in greater detail in Figures 4 and 5, and with reference thereto, this<br>
assembly comprises arm 162, horizontal moving means 164, and vertical moving means 166.<br>
Generally, arm 162 is supported for horizontal and vertical movement. Mechanism 164 is used<br>
to move that arm between first and second positions to engage lens carriers 104 and to form a<br>
group of contiguous lens carriers, and vertical moving means 166 is used to move that arm<br>
vertically and then via mechanism 164 back to its starting position out of the way of the carriers<br>
being pushed by upstream mechanisms into positions 4 and 5.<br>
With the embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawings, assembly 126 is used to form<br>
groups of three lens carriers, and each group of three is assembled in a two-step process. In a<br>
first step, as lens carriers are moved down toward the pre-cure area, arm 162 is located just<br><br>
behind (to the top as viewed in Figure 1) carrier position 5. At this point, two carriers are ahead<br>
of the arm, in locations 4 and 5. The arm moves downward, engages the carrier in position 5<br>
and pushes this carrier downward to the carrier position 2. As the arm does this, this lens<br>
carrier pushes the carrier ahead of it to carrier position 1. After this is done, the arm 162 returns<br>
to a location just behind carrier position 5. The arm is moved to push this lens carrier to position<br>
4. As this occurs, this carrier pushes the lens carrier ahead of it to position 3, abutting against<br>
the carrier in position 2, which in turn abuts against the carrier in position 1.<br>
Assembly 130 is used to push this group of carriers 144 into the pre-cure area 110 in the<br>
direction shown by arrow 145 in Figure 4. Assembly 130 is also shown in greater detail in<br>
Figures 4-6; and as shown therein, the assembly includes support member 160, pusher 168,<br>
and moving means 170. Generally, pusher 168 is supported by support member 160 for<br>
movement toward and away from the support member, and moving means 170 is provided to<br>
move the pusher, relative to the support member, to engage the group of lens carriers, and to<br>
push that row of carriers into the pre-cure area. Pusher 168 is shown in the extended 168E and<br>
the retracted positions 168R in Figure 6. Preferably, the lens carriers are pushed into the pre-<br>
cure area as a group, while maintaining the alignment of the carriers and the abutting contact of<br>
neighboring carries.<br>
As will be understood by those skilled in the art, any suitable devices may be used as support<br>
member 160, arm 162, pusher 168, and moving means 164 and 170. Also, these devices may<br>
be operated in any suitable specific manner. Moving means 164 is preferably a servo drive.<br>
Moving means 166 is preferably a linear cylinder. Moving means 170 is preferably a rotary<br>
cylinder.<br>
Once the lens carriers are in the pre-cure area, assembly 132 is used to move the carries<br>
across that area. Assembly 132 is illustrated in detail in Figures 7, 8 and 9; and with reference<br>
thereto, this assembly comprises support member 172, arm subassembly 174, and moving<br>
means 176 and 178. Generally, support member 172 is located below the pre-cure area, and<br>
arm subassembly 174 is supported by the support member for horizontal and vertical<br>
movement. Also, moving means 176 is operated to move the arm subassembly vertically from<br>
a position beneath the pre-cure area, to a position extending above the floor of that area. The<br>
moving means 178 is operated to move arm subassembly 174 horizontally, to engage the rows<br>
of lens carriers in the pre-cure area and to move those rows across that area and into a final<br>
row position therein.<br>
In order to accommodate the above-described movement of subassembly 174, the floor of pre-<br>
cure area is provided with slots 180 (shown in figure 2) that allow the subassembly to move<br>
from beneath that floor, upward through that floor, then forward, and then back downward, to a<br>
position beneath the floor.<br>
Preferably, pre-cure area 110 holds three rows of lens carriers, and assembly 130 is used to<br>
move the carriers across into the pre-cure area one step at a time into the first row postion,<br>
from the first row position to the second row position and then to the third row position. In the<br>
preferred embodiment assembly 132 works with assembly 130 to provide the necessary<br>
spacing between the rows of carriers to accommodate the weight station 188. Assembly 132<br>
can also work independently of assembly 130 to move rows of pallets through the precure area<br>
110, particularly if no additional pallets have been pushed to assembly 130 by upstream<br>
processes. Preferably, assembly 130 moves carriers into the first row at the same time that the<br>
assembly 132 moves carriers from the first row to the second row to the third row. In an<br>
alternative embodiment if spacing were not required assembly 130 could be used without<br>
assembly 132 to move pallets through the precure area 110.<br>
To achieve the proper spacing, arm subassembly 174 may comprise a pair of spaced apart<br>
arms or projections 182. These arms 182 are positioned and operated so that these arms<br>
move upward together, with one arm moved upward just behind the first row of carriers, and the<br>
other arm moved upward just behind the second row of carriers. These arms are then moved<br>
horizontally together, with one arm moving one row of carriers from the first row position to the<br>
second row position, and the other arm moving one row of carriers from the second row position<br>
to the third row position.<br>
Any suitable support member 172, arm subassembly 174 and moving means 176 may be<br>
employed in the practice of this invention, and these devices may be operated in any suitable<br>
specific manner. In the preferred embodiment moving means 176 is a vertical linear cylinder<br>
and moving means 178 is a rotary cylinder.<br>
Assembly 134 is provided to move the lens carriers out of the pre-cure area from the final row<br>
position. Preferably, with particular reference to Figures 10 and 11, this assembly 134 includes<br>
first and second engagement means 184 and 186. First engagement means 184 is used to<br>
engage the row of lens carriers in the final row position in the pre-cure area, and to move this<br>
line of carriers in a first direction so that the carriers in that final row are located, one at a time,<br>
in a discharge position 190. With the specific arrangement shown in Figure 1, this discharge<br>
position is the position of the bottom right carrier in the pre-cure area. Second engagement<br>
means 186 is used to engage each of the lens carriers in the final row of carriers, one carrier at<br>
a time, and to move the carrier from the discharge position and out of the pre-cure area to<br>
position 192 in the cure area 112.<br>
Any suitable means may be used as the first and second engagement means 184 and 186. For<br>
example, these engagement means may be pneumatic cylinders that are operated to push the<br>
carriers in the desired manner. Alternatively, electrically operated pushing or pulling mechanism<br>
may also be employed to move the lens carriers in the appropriate way. Engagement means<br>
184 is preferably a linear and rotary cylinder working together. Engagement means 186<br>
comprises vertical and horizontal moving means operating on a pusher arm similar to assembly<br>
130.<br>
Assembly 136 is provided to move the carriers discharged from the pre-cure area into the cure<br>
area 112. More specifically, with reference to Figures 1 and 10, assembly 136 engages these<br>
carriers, one at a time, at a carrier receiving position 192, and moves these carriers in a first<br>
direction to form a row of lens carriers in a first row position 194 in the cure area, with<br>
neighboring carriers in the row contiguous to each other.<br>
Any suitable specific means may be used to do this. For example, assembly 136 may comprise<br>
a pneumatic cylinder, preferably a rotary cylinder, positioned just below the receiving position<br>
192. As carriers are moved from the pre-cure area and into that receiving position, this cylinder<br>
may engage these carriers, one at a time, and pushes the carriers upward, into the cure area, to<br>
form a row in position 194. After the first carrier is pushed into the row, then, as each<br>
subsequent carrier is pushed upward, that subsequent carrier abuts against the previous carrier<br>
and pushes that carrier further upward. This process continues until the row of carriers is<br>
formed.<br>
As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, other specific means may be used to<br>
form the carrier rows in the cure area. For instance, electrically operated pushing or pulling<br>
devices may be used to form these rows in the cure station.<br>
Assembly 140 shown in Figure 1 is used to push the rows of carriers across the cure station.<br>
Assembly 140 comprises a pusher, movement means and a support, similar to assembly 130.<br>
Assembly 140 is used to move each row of carriers across the curing station 112, from left to<br>
right as viewed in Figure 1, from the first row position to a final row position 210. As this occurs,<br>
the rows form array 124, with neighboring rows in the array abutting each other. Assembly 140<br>
pushes the row of lens carriers that is formed in row position 194 to the row position adjacent to<br>
position 194, which pushes the row adjacent to it. As each row is pushed forward, the row<br>
abuts against the row ahead of it and pushes that row forward one step. Assembly 140, then<br>
retracts and assembly 136 assembles a row of carriers in position 194 again and then assembly<br>
140 pushes row 194 again. These steps are repeated, and in this way the rows of carriers are<br>
exposed to the conditions of the cure station for the required exposure times.<br>
With the preferred embodiment of the invention, the process steps of forming a row of carriers<br>
in position 194 (a first row position) and pushing the row 194 to a second row position adjacent<br>
to row 194 via assembly 140, assembly 140 retracting, and forming another row of carriers in<br>
position 194 may continue until the row furthest to the right reaches one of theiast row positions<br>
199 to 210 of the array as described earlier. Figure 1 shows the maximum number of pallets<br>
that the cure area 112 can accommodate; however, as described earlier the cure station 112<br>
provides a buffer 200. Buffer 200 comprises three rows. One or more of the rows of the buffer<br>
200 are only used when needed if the downstream processes are not in working condition to<br>
receive pallets. Assembly 140 continues in its step by step fashion to fill buffer 200 if the<br>
downstream process is not working.<br>
If the downstream process is functioning properly, the buffer is not used, and assembly 212 is<br>
used to move the row of carriers in position 199 away from array 124. When the carries reach<br>
position 199, they have received sufficient exposure to the curing conditions in the cure station.<br>
Under regular operations, assembly 212 is used to move the row of carriers furthermost to the<br>
right in positions 199 to 210 to position 211 for removal from the cure station.<br>
Assembly 212 is supported for movement toward and away from that last row position of array<br>
124 and in the preferred embodiment to position 211, and is used to engage the lens carriers in<br>
that last row position and to move that row of carriers away from the array into position 211.<br>
Preferably, with particular reference to Figures 13 14, and 15 assembly 212 includes a series of<br>
engagement members 216 and moving means 220. Engagement members 216 are supported<br>
for horizontal movement beneath the curing area and for vertical movement. Moving means<br>
220 comprise horizontal moving means 221 and vertical moving means 223. The horizontal<br>
moving means moves the engagement members 216 horizontally, preferably by a servo drive<br>
driven by motor 171, beneath the cure area, to positions below the last row of carriers in array<br>
124, then vertical moving means 223, preferably by a linear cylinder moves the engagement<br>
members vertically to engage that row of carriers. With engagement members contacting the<br>
carrier, the horizontal movement means 221 moves the engagement members horizontally to<br>
move the carriers of that last row from the array 124 and into a final row position 211. Once the<br>
lens carries are in the final row position, engagement members 216 are lowered, freeing the<br>
lens carriers from the engagement members. Engagement members 216 are shown in Figure<br>
14 by dashed lines in the extended 216 E and retracted positions 216R. Preferably, a<br>
respective two engagement members are provided for each carrier that is being moved away<br>
from the array 124. Preferably the two engagement members contact or otherwise engage<br>
each lens carrier in two places on the side of the carrier opposite the direction that the carrier is<br>
to be pushed. Figure 15 shows that engagement members 216 in contact with one pallet 104.<br>
In operation the engagement members 216 shown in Figure 15 would contact six pallets, the six<br>
pallets would preferably contact eachother end-to-end in a row. Preferably the assembly 212<br>
only moves one row of carriers and preferably that row is the last row of carriers in the array,<br>
preferably that last row is in any of the positions from 199 to 210; however, the assembly 212 is<br>
capable of moving any row of carriers from any position in the array 124, particularly if there is a<br>
reason for rejecting all the pallets in the cure area 112. Alternatively, the assembly 212 and<br>
other downstream assemblies for movement in the cure area 112 could be modified so that<br>
assembly 212 could empty the cure area 112 by simultaneously pushing multiple rows of<br>
carriers out of the cure area 112. If there were total reject situation, presently assembly 212<br>
moves a single row of carriers in the right furthermost row to position 211, and then repeats the<br>
process until the cure station is cleared. The movement of the carriers to position 211 is<br>
coordinated by control means 150. Presently, assembly 140 is designed to be able to push any<br>
number of rows of carriers in the array 124 incrementally row-by-row; however, if desired<br>
assembly 140 could be modified so that it would be capable of pushing any number of rows of<br>
pallets across any number of row positions or across the entire array 124 so that the row<br>
furthest to the right in the array 124 is located in position 210.<br>
In order to accommodate the above-describe movement of engagement members 216, the<br>
floor 66 of cure station 112 is provided with a series of elongated through slots 222 (shown in<br>
Figure 2) that allow the engagement members to move from beneath that floor, and upward<br>
through the floor 66 and into engagement with carriers in the curing station. These slots also<br>
allow the engagement members to then move forward, and then back downward, beneath the<br>
floor. With the preferred embodiment of the invention, where a respective two engagement<br>
members 216 are provided for each lens carrier in a row of the carriers, the floor of the curing<br>
station is provided with a respective two of these elongated slots 222 for each carrier in the row.<br>
Thus, for instance, if there are six carriers in a row, preferably, the floor of the curing station is<br>
provided with twelve slots. Moreover, preferably, a respective pair of the slots extend directly<br>
below each line of carriers in the array 124.<br>
Any suitable engagement members 216 and moving means 220 may be used in the practice of<br>
this invention. For example, the engagement members may be threaded rods mounted on<br>
carriers that, in turn, are mounted on rails. The carriers are moved along these rails to move<br>
the rods in the horizontal direction, and the rods are rotated to move the rods upwards and<br>
downwards. Any suitable means may be used to move the carriers along the rails, and for<br>
example, stepper motors may be used to do this. Preferably vertical moving means 223 is a<br>
cylinder and horizontal moving means 221 is a servo.<br>
Preferably, assembly 212 is able to pull lens carriers from any row position in array 124 to the<br>
final row position 221 in the curing station 112. This allows the number of rows in that station to<br>
be varied or adjusted over time. This feature and the extra rows provided as buffer 200, is the<br>
intelligent buffer, enables the output of the curing station to be controlled and adjusted to<br>
accommodate conditions or circumstances occurring in the manufacturing system 100<br>
downstream of the curing station. For example, if it is appropriate to interrupt the manufacturing<br>
system at some point downstream of the curing station, lens carriers can be allowed to<br>
accumulate in the curing station in buffer 200. In this way, the processes occurring at and<br>
upstream of the curing station can continue uninterrupted and are not affected by the . &gt;<br>
downstream interruption , and then when the downstream processes are functioning again<br>
assembly 212 will proceed to move the row of carriers furthest to the right and put it in row 211<br>
for exiting the cure station 112.<br>
In order to achieve this ability, elongated slots 222 extend completely across array 124,<br>
preferably all the way to and underneath the first row position 194. Also, elongated members<br>
216 are supported for movement completely across array 124, and can be used to engage lens<br>
carriers in any row of the array and to pull that engaged row of carriers to the final row position<br>
196. In addition, with this preferred embodiment, a shield is provided to shield the rows of<br>
buffer 200 from the ultraviolet or visible light source in the curing station. With this shield,<br>
system 100 has the option of holding lens carriers in those last several rows without<br>
overexposing the contact lenses in those carriers to the light source.<br>
 In the preferred embodiment, the lens carriers are moved out of the cure station 112 in the<br>
same order as they were introduced into the cure oven; therefore, assembly 334 is provided<br>
similar to assembly 134 to remove the carriers from the cure oven 112. The first carrier in row<br>
211 is moved to the right to position 196 and then the remaining carriers in row 211 are indexed<br>
up, and this process is repeated until there are no more carriers in 211. Then assembly 212<br>
 moves a row of carries into position 211 and the process is repeated again.<br>
With reference again to Figure 1, once lens carriers are located in the final row position 196,<br>
assembly 142 is used to move those carriers out of the curing station. Preferably, assembly<br>
142 includes subassembly 230, receiver 232, and pushing means 234. Receiver 232 is located<br>
adjacent the final row position 196, preferably aligned with that row. Subassembly 230 is<br>
provided for engaging the lens carriers in that final row position and moving the lens carriers,<br>
one at a time, onto the receiver 232. Pushing means 234 is then used to push the lens carrier<br>
off the receiver and out of the curing station.<br>
With the embodiment of subassembly 230 shown in the Figures, this subassembly includes a<br>
series of beams 236 and moving means 240. Beams 236, referred to as walking beams, are<br>
supported for movement along row position 196, to a location adjacent or above receiver 232;<br>
and means 240 is provided to move this series of beams across the final row position, to<br>
engage the lens carriers therein and to push those lens carriers onto the carrier receiver 232.<br>
For example, every other lens carrier may be engaged by one of the beams 236, and that one<br>
beam may be used to push two lens carriers onto receiver. Other arrangements may be used,<br>
however, in the practice of this invention.<br>
Preferably, receiver 232 forms a defined area 242 for receiving carriers 104. The carriers are<br>
pushed into this area by subassembly 230, and then pushed out from this area by pushing<br>
means 234. In addition, preferably, receiver 232 is rotatable, and this defined area 242 has the<br>
shape of a cross, with each segment of the cross being adapted to receive two lens carriers.<br>
In use, one of these segments is aligned with row position 196, then two lens carriers are<br>
pushed onto this segment, the receiver 232 is rotated ninety degrees, and pushing means 234<br>
pushes these two lens carriers off the receiver. As the receiver rotates ninety degrees, the<br>
second cross segment becomes aligned with row 196, and subassembly 230 then pushes two<br>
more lens carriers onto this segment of the receiver. The receiver rotates another ninety<br>
degrees, and pushing means 234 now pushes the two additional carriers off the receiver. This<br>
process continues, with the receiver rotating ninety degrees each time two lens carriers are<br>
pushed onto the receiver. In this way, the receiver 232 changes the direction of the path of<br>
travel of lens carriers by ninety degrees. The carriers that are pushed off the receiver may be<br>
pushed onto a conveyer belt or other suitable means for transporting the carriers away from the<br>
curing station.<br>
Any suitable beams 236, moving means 240 and receiver 242 may be used in the practice of<br>
this invention. For instance, beams 236 may be mounted on an endless conveyor belt that<br>
carries the beams through the desired path. Also, a pneumatic cylinder may be used as<br>
pushing means 234, although electrically operated pushing or pulling mechanisms may also be<br>
used to move the lens carriers from receiver 232.<br>
Control means 150, as mentioned above, are provided to control and to coordinate the<br>
operation of the above-discussed article handling devices, and these assemblies may be<br>
controlled and operated in any suitable specific manner. For instance, these control means<br>
may be used to operate the article handling assemblies according to a defined timing sequence,<br>
or sensors may be used to identify when certain events occur or are to occur. Also, a<br>
combination of sensors and a defined timing sequence may be used to coordinate operation of<br>
the assemblies. For example, in order to facilitate operation of the above-discussed intelligent<br>
buffer feature of the curing station, preferably control means is provided with a signal or other<br>
information identifying where the last row of lens carriers is located in array 124. With this<br>
information, the control means is able to direct assembly 212 to the proper location the next<br>
time that assembly is activated to move a row of lens carriers from the array 124 and into the<br>
final row position.<br>
