				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to submersible water pump installed without the delivery pipe wherein the water is passed through water filter having porous structure, which holds the dust and then is passed through submersible pump set wherein novei inventions include rubber seal, steel rope clamps, suspended rods, hooks, clamps, rubber pipe, cover plate<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, now the water is extracted from the ground by the procedure specified for installation of the pump by ISO 8034 A bore is made in the ground and a water filter is placed at the bottom of the filter, to filter the dust or sand particles. The water then comes to the submerged pump set through the water inlet. The water comes out from the outlet of the pump from where it is fed to the delivery pipe. The well is then covered by a cover plate. The pipe and the pumpset is hanged with the help of clamps This method is cumbersome, expensive and less efficient.<br>
3        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTTON<br>
To solve the above-described problems, it is an objective of the present invention to make the present invention more advantageous and technically sound than the convenţional<br>
submerged water pumps and the defect has been removed and our present invention is submersible water pump installed without delivery pipe, which can provide water efficiently and is less expensive and less cumbersome.<br>
A bore i s made in the ground and a water filter i s placed at the bottom of the filter to filter the dust or sand particles The pump is supported by the help of rope and hooks or by any other means The water is then sent to the submerged pump set through the water inlet. The water comes out from the outlet of the pump. A rubber seal is attached to the side walls of the bore well pipe by any means such as hydraulic, mechanical, electrical. The water coming out from the pump does not go below and there is no downward leakage. The water stays up because of pressure so created and comes out from the hole made in the cover plate<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above objective and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent<br>
by describing in detail preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the attached<br>
drawings in which:<br>
Fig l shows the convenţional submersible water pump installed without delivery pipe.<br>
Fig 2 shows the invented water pump without the delivery pipe.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the pump outlet<br>
Fig 4 shows the suspended rod<br>
Fig 5 shows the cover plate assembly.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to figure l as shown in the drawing a bore l is made in the ground and a water filter 12 is placed at the bottom of the filter 2, to filter the dust or sand particles The water then comes to the submerged pump set 3 through the water inlet 14. The water comes out from the outlet 15 of the pump from where it is fed to the delivery pipe 4 The well i s then covered by a cover plate 5. The pipe and the pumpset is hanged with the help of clamps 6<br>
Referring to figure 2 as shown in the drawing a bore l is made in the ground and a water filter 12 is placed at the bottom of the filter 2 to filter the dust or sand particles. The pump 3 is supported by the help of rope 16 and hooks 17 or by any other means. The water i s then sent to the submerged pump 3 set through the water inlet 14. The water comes out from the outlet of the pump 15. A rubber seal 6 is attached to the side walls 7 of the bore well pipe so that the water coming out from the pump 3 does not go below and there is no downward leakage The water stays up because of pressure so created and comes out from the hole made in the cover plate<br>
Referring to figure 4 as shown in the drawing suspended rod is used to support or suspend the pump set<br>
In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference   to   numerous   specific   details   that   may   vary   from   implementation   to<br>
implementation Thus, the sole and exclusive indicator of what is the invention, and is intended by the applicants to be the invention, is the set of claims that issue from this application, in the specific form in which such ciaims issue, including any subsequent correction Any deflnitions expressly set forth herein for terms contained in such claims shall govcrn the meaning of such terms as used in the claims. Hence, no limitation, element, property, feature, advantage or attribute that is not expressly recited in a claim should limit the scope of such claim in any way The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an (Ilustrative raîher than a restrictive sense.<br>
Obviously, additional modifications and variations of this invention are possible based on the above teachings Therefore, it is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, this invention may be practiced otherwise than specifically described herein.<br><br>
We claim:-<br>
1)	A submersible water pump installed without delivery pipe wherein the a bore is<br>
made in the ground and a water filter is placed at the bottom of the filter to filter the dust<br>
or sand particles;<br>
the pump is supported by the help of rope and hooks or by any other means; the water is then sent to the submerged pump set through the water inlet; the water comes out from the outlet of the pump; and rubber seal is attached to the side walls of the bore well pipe.<br>
2)	A submersible water pump installed without delivery pipe as claimed in claim<br>
l wherein the pump i s supported with the help of suspended rod, rope, hooks or any other<br>
means.<br>
3)	A submersible water pump installed without delivery pipe as claimed in claim l<br>
wherein the rubber is attached to the side walls so as to prevent the leakage of the water<br>
to the pump<br>
4)	A submersible water pump installed without delivery pipe as claimed in any of<br>
the above claims substantially as described in the specification and illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings<br><br></td>
