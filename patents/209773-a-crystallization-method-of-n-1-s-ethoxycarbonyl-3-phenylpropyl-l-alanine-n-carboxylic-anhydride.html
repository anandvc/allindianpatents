SPECIFICATION<br>
METHODS FOR CRYSTALLIZATION OF<br>
N- (1(S)-ETHOXYCARBONYL-3-PHENYLPROPYL)-L-ALANINE<br>
N-CARBOXYANHYDRIDE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a crystallization method of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine N-carboxylic anhydride (hereinafter referred to sometimes as compound (1)) represented by the formula (1):<br><br>
in the formula, all configurations of asymmetric carbon atoms are (S) configurations,<br>
which is a common intermediate for a group of compounds which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to express a potent antihypertensive action among the therapeutic drugs for hypertension which are on the market today.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The compound (1) can be obtained by reacting N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine (hereinafter referred to sometimes as compound (2) ) represented by the formula (2):<br><br>
2<br><br>
in the formula, all configurations of asymmetric carbon atoms are (S) configurations,<br>
with N/N'-carbonyldiimidazole or phosgene. The known mode of use of the above compound (1) includes the mode in which the compound (1) is not isolated from the above-mentioned reaction solution and is directly submitted to the subsequent reaction (JP-A-57-175152, USP 5359086) and the mode in which the above reaction mixture is distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent and concentrated to dryness, the dried solid is crushed, and. the resulting white powder is put to use (Reference Example in JP-B-05-41159).<br>
These conventional modes of use of the compound (1) have several drawbacks for commercial exploitation.  For example, in the mode of use in which the reaction solution is directly submitted to the subsequent reaction, the reaction solvent species which can be used in the subsequent reaction is limited, unless a solvent exchange procedure is interposed, to the solvent species used in the N-carboxylic anhydride-forming reaction (hereinafter referred to as NCA forming reaction) or to a mixed solvent containing the solvent used in the NCA forming reaction. Furthermore, since the transfer and storage in a formof a solution is required, this mode of use has the disadvantage of inconvenience in the handling of this versatile intermediate compound.<br>
Further, it is known from JP-B-05-41159 that compound (1) can be obtained in a powdery formbut because the powder is acquired by concentrating to dryness the solution following the NCA forming reaction, the concomitant impurity is not removed and<br><br>
3<br>
this procedure is not easy to follow on a commercial scale-. While the inventors of the present invention studied on the course of crystallization of the compound (1) , it was found that in the crystallization of the compound (1) on a commercial scale, an oil formation and scaling tend to 'occur with high frequency so that it is difficult to effect stable crystallization on a commercial scale.  It was also found difficult to obtain crystals of high purity and good powder characteristics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As the result of an intensive investigation for overcoming the above disadvantages, the inventors of the present invention discovered a crystallization method by which crystals of the compound (1) can be obtained in a stable manner with good workability avoiding an oil formation and scaling and with a large mean crystal particle diameter and good powder characteristics and which can be carried into practice on a commercial scale, and have ultimately developed the present invention.<br>
The first aspect of the present invention, therefore, is concerned with a crystallization method of N- {1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine N-carboxylic anhydride<br>
which comprises mixing a solution of N- (1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine N-carboxylic anhydride in a good solvent with an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to crystallize saidN-carboxylic anhydride,<br>
the solution of said N-carboxylic anhydride in the good solvent being added to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to thereby effect crystallization, while inhibiting an oil formation and scaling of said N-carboxylic anhydride.<br>
The second aspect of the present invention, therefore, is concerned with a crystallization method of N- (1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine<br><br>
4<br>
N-carboxylic anhydride<br>
which comprises adding an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to a solution of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine N-carboxylic anhydride in a good solvent to crystallize said N-carboxilic anhydride,<br>
the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent being added sequentially over not less than 1/4 of an hour and at a temperature of not higher than 60°C to thereby inhibit an oil formation and scaling of said N-carboxylic anhydride.<br>
The present invention is now described in detail.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The first aspect of the invention is now described. In this invention, a solution of said compound (1) in a good solvent is mixed with an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to crystallize the compound (1) .  In order to carry out the crystallization of the compound (1) with advantage, the presence of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is essential.<br>
The aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent mentioned above is not particularly restricted but includes, for example, chain saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n+2, such as pentane, 2-methylpentane, 2, 2-dimethylpentane, normal hexane, isohexane, normal heptane, normal octane, isooctane, normal decane, etc.; cyclic saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2rw such as methylcyclopentane, ethylcyclopentane, propylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, propylcyclohexane, etc.; and mixed solvents thereof. Furthermore, unsaturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n or CnH2n-2, such as 2-pentene, 1-hexane, cyclohexene, etc. and mixed solvents thereof or their mixed solvents with said saturated hydrocarbons can also be used. Among these, chain or cyclic saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n+2 or CnH2n and mixed solvents thereof are suitable. Not only from crystallization<br><br>
5<br>
points of view but also in consideration of drying time of obtained crystals/ the industrially preferred aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent includes saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 10 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n+2 or CnH2n and mixed solvents thereof. Preferred among these are pentane, 2-methylpentane, 2, 2-dimethylpentane, normal hexane, isohexane, normal heptane, normal octane, isooctane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, propylcyclohexane, and mixed solvents thereof.  Further, more preferred are pentane, 2-methylpentane, normal hexane, isohexane, normal heptane, normal octane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, propylcyclohexane, and mixed solvents thereof.  Particularly, normal hexane, isohexane, normal heptane, methylcyclohexane, and mixed solvents thereof are suitable, and normal hexane, normal heptane and a mixed solvent thereof are still more suitable.<br>
The good solvent mentioned above is not particularly restricted but includes, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1, 1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,<br>
1,1,2-trichloroethane, etc.; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, t-butyl methyl ether, etc.; nitriles such as acetonitrile, etc.; esters such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, pentyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, etc.; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc.; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene etc.; and mixed solvents thereof. More particularly, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene are preferred.<br>
Among these, said halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters are suitable, and halogenated hydrocarbons are particularly suitable.  The preferred halogenated hydrocarbons are dichloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br><br>
6<br>
1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane and mixed solvents thereof, and dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane are preferred among these.  Particularly preferred is dichloromethane. Needless to say, other solvents may be contained within the range not causing adverse effects.<br>
In the first aspect of the present invention, mixing of the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is carried out by the method comprising adding the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
The temperature at addition of the. solution in the good<br>
solvent is preferably not higher than 60°C but in order to manifest the effect of the invention to the maximum extent, the temperature at addition of the solution in the good solvent is more preferably<br>
-30 to 50°C, still more preferably -20 to 45°C.<br>
The addition of the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is preferably carried out by a sequential addition of the solution in the good solvent. Such sequential addition is preferably carried out over not less than 1/4 of an hour and for better crystallization, more preferably over not less than 1/2 of an hour, still more preferably over not less than an hour.<br>
In the crystallization according to the first aspect of the present invention, much better crystallization in which the oil formation and scaling will not substantially occur can be carried out by adding the solution of the compound (1) in the good solvent in such condition that a certain amount of crystals of the compound (1) is added in the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in advance. Specifically, crystallization is carried out by adding crystals of said compound (1) to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent at the level of preferably not more than 30 weight %, more preferably not more than 20 weight %, still more preferably not more than 5 weight % (the lower limit is usually 0.1 weight %) based on the total amount of said compound (1) in the solution in the good solvent to be added to thereby prepare a crystal<br><br>
7<br>
slurry of said compound (1) , andadding, preferably sequentially/ the solution of the compound (1) in the good solvent to the above slurry.<br>
The same effect can be achieved by adding a portion of the solution of the compound (1) in the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in advance to prepare a slurry in which said compound {1) is precipitated followed by adding the rest of the solution in the good solvent to the above slurry. Specifically, crystallization in which the oil formation and seal ing will not substantially occur can be carried out by adding, preferably sequentially, the solution in the good solvent preferably not more than 30 weight %, more preferably not more than 20 weight %, still more preferably not more than 10 weight % (the lower limit is usually 0.5 weight %) based on the total amount of the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent to be added to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in advance, to thereby prepare a crystal slurry of said compound (1) and adding, preferably sequentially, the rest of the solution in the good solvent. In the case where a portion of the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent is added to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to prepare a crystal slurry in advance, the addition of the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent is carried out, for example, over not less than 1/10 of an hour, but for better precipitation of crystals, the addition is carried out preferably over not less than 1/5 of an hour, more preferably over not less than 1/2 of an hour.<br>
Needless to say, gradual addition of the whole amount of the solution of the compound (1) in the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent continuously or separately over a protracted time period is equivalent to continuously carrying out the above procedure of preparing a crystal slurry of the above compound (1) in advance, followed by adding the solution in the good solvent, so that a similar inhibition effect of the oil formation and scaling can be expected.<br>
The retention time following addition of the solution of<br><br>
8<br>
said compound (1) in the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is not particularly restricted but is usually not less than about 1/2 of an hour.<br>
The ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent at completion of addition varies according to the combination of the good solvent and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to be used and the concentrationof the compound (1) in the solution in the good solvent to be used, but in consideration of productivity and the like, is preferably 0.001 to 1, more preferably 0.003 to 1, still more preferably 0.003 to 0.8, particularly preferably.0.01 to 0.5, as the weight ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
Specifically, when a halogenated hydrocarbon is used as the good solvent/ the ratio is preferably 0.003 to 1, more preferably 0.01 to 0.5. When an aprotic polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or acetone is used as the good solvent, the ratio is preferably 0.01 to 0.7, more preferably 0. 05 to 0.5. When an ester such as ethyl acetate, or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene is used as the good solvent, the ratio is preferably 0.06 to 0.8, more preferably 0.1 to 0.5. In the above crystallization procedure, by adjusting the ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent ultimately to a predetermined ratio, not less than 80 weight %, preferably not less than 90 weight %, more preferably not less than 95 weight % of the total amount of said compound (1) can be precipitated with inhibiting oil formation and with the amount of seal ing be ing inhibited to not more than 10 weight %, preferably not more than 8 weight % of the total amount, thus enabling production of crystals of said compound (1) with a high recovery rate.<br>
In the first aspect of the invention, it is preferred-to increase the amount of precipitated crystals by adjusting the liquid temperature to not higher than 25°C after completion of addition of the solution in the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent and before isolating crystals precipitated.<br><br>
9<br>
The above liquid temperature is more preferably -30 to 25°C, still more preferably -20 to 15°C. In this manner, crystals can be caused to precipitate sufficiently and be obtained with a high recovery rate.<br>
The crystallization method of the invention can be used not only as the recrystallization method of the compound (1) but also as the method of isolating the compound (1) from the reaction solution.<br>
The solution of the compound (1) in the good solvent for use in this invention may optionally be an NCA forming reaction solution obtained by reacting said compound (2) with N/N'-carbonyldiiruidazole or phosgene (inclusive of dimeric and trimeric phosgenes) in said good solvent.  The solvent for such an NCA forming reaction is not particularly restricted inasmuch as it is stable in the NCA forming reaction.  Thus, for example, the above-mentioned halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, nitriles, ketones and mixed solvents thereof can be preferably used.  Specifically, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane, etc.; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane, etc.; esters such as ethyl acetate, etc.; nitriles such as acetonitrile, etc. ; and ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, etc., can be generally and suitably used- Preferred among these are halogenated hydrocarbons and dichloromethane is particularly preferred. The solvent species to be used for crystallization is not necessarily identical with the solvent species used for said NCA forming reaction.  Thus, the solution of compound (1) in the good solvent for use in this invention may be the solution, after the NCA forming reaction, subjected to one or a several cycles of concentration for removing the low-boiling-point component including the reaction solvent (inclusive of phosgene and hydrogen chloride gas when phosgene is used) or the solution obtained by exchanging the reaction solvent with a solvent suitable for crystallization. Needless to say, it is convenient that the reaction solvent doubles as the crystallization solvent<br><br>
10<br>
(good solvent).  For example/ when a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane is used as the NCA forming reaction solvent and phosgene is used as the NCA forming reagent, the reaction mixture at completion of the reaction can be concentrated to adjust the concentration of the compound (1) and this can preferably be used as the solution of the compound (1) in the good solvent,<br>
In order to obtain high-quality crystals of the compound (1), it is'preferable to remove an impurity and a coloring component as the byproduct of said NCA forming reaction by using an adsorbent (preferably activated carbon) prior to the crystallization of the present invention.<br>
The crystals thus obtained can be separated by the ordinary solid-liquid separation processes, such as centrifugation, pressure filtration or suction filtration, preferably washed with an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, and optionally dried by atmospheric pressure drying or reduced pressure drying (vacuum drying).<br>
In accordance with this first aspect of the present invention, the crystallization can be carried out in a satisfactory manner while the oil formation and scaling of said compound (1) are inhibited so that crystals of compound (1) can be obtained with a high recovery rate.<br>
The second aspect of the present invention is now described.<br>
In the second aspect of the present invention, an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is added to a solution of said compound (1) in a good solvent to crystallize the compound (1) . To carry out the crystallization of the compound (1) with advantage, the presence of an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is essential.<br>
The aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent mentioned above is not particularly restricted but includes, for example, chain saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n+2, such as pentane, 2-methylpentane, 2, 2-dimethylpentane,<br><br>
11<br>
normal hexane, isohexane, normal heptane, normal octane, isooctane, normal decane, etc.; cyclic saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n/ such as cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane/ ethylcyclopentane, propylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, propylcyclohexane, etc.; and mixed solvents thereof. Furthermore, unsaturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n or CnH2n-2, such as 2-pentene, 1-hexane, cyclohexene, etc. and mixed solvents thereof or their mixed solvents with said saturated hydrocarbons can also be used. Among these, chain or cyclic saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 12 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n+2 or CnH2n and mixed solvents thereof are suitable.  Not only from crystallization points of view but also in cons iderat ion of drying time of obtained crystals, the industrially more preferred aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent includes chain or cyclic saturated hydrocarbons of 5 to 10 carbon atoms represented by CnH2n+2 or CnH2n and mixed solvents thereof.<br>
Among these, pentane, 2-methylpentane,<br>
2, 2-dimethylpentane, normal hexane, isohexane, normal heptane, normal octane, isooctane, normal decane, cyclopentane,<br>
methylcylopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, propylcyclohexane, and mixed solvents thereof are preferred.  Inparticular, normal hexane, isohexane,<br>
normal heptane, isooctane, methylcyclohexane andmixed solvents thereof are suitable.  Still more suitable are normal hexane,<br>
normal heptane and a mixed solvent thereof.<br>
The good solvent mentioned above is not particularly<br>
restricted but includes, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons<br>
such as dichloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethane,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,<br>
1,1,2-trichloroethane, etc.; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
1,4-dioxane, t-butyl methyl ether, etc.; nitriles such as<br>
acetonitrile etc. ; esters such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate,<br>
propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl<br><br>
12<br>
acetate, pentyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, etc.; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc.; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene etc.; and mixed solvents thereof. Specifically, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, acetone and methyl ethyl ketone are preferred.<br>
Among these, the above-mentioned halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters are suitable, and halogenated hydrocarbons are particularly suitable. As halogenated hydrocarbons, dichloromethane, 1, 1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,<br>
1, 1, 2-trichloroethane and mixed solvents thereof are preferred and among these, dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane are preferred.  Particularly preferred is dichloromethane. Needless to say, other solvents maybe contained within the range not causing adverse effects.<br>
The conditions at the time of addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent are now described.<br>
The addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to the solution of said compound (1) in the good solvent is carried out by the sequential addition. The sequential addition may be carried out by adding said solution in the good solvent continuously or separating said solution in the good solvent into several portions and adding them serially.<br>
The time period over which said sequential addition is carried out depends on the temperature, concentration and degree of stirring at the time of addition but generally the addition of the whole amount of the predetermined aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is carried out over not less than 1/4 of an hour. In order to obtain crystals with large particle diameter, the sequential addition is carried out preferably over not less than 1/2 of an hour, more preferably not less than an hour.<br>
The temperature at which the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is added is not higher than 60°C in order to inhibit the oil<br><br>
13<br>
formation and scaling.  In order to manifest the effect of the invention to the maximum extent, -30 to 50°C is more preferred, and 0 to 45°C is still more preferred in order to stably obtain crystals with large particle diameter.  The retention time following addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is not particularly restricted but generally a period of time not less than about 1/2 of an hour is sufficient.<br>
In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, it is preferable to provide sufficient stirring during addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in order to inhibit the oil formation and scaling. The intensity of stirring being expressed in a stirring power required per unit volume, it is generally preferable to carry out the addition under stirring with a stirring force of not less than 0.1 kw/m3, more preferably a stirring force of not less than 0.3 kW/m3, being expressed in the stirring power required per unit volume.<br>
As the addition in accordance with the crystallization method of the second aspect of the present invention, it is more advantageous to prepare a slurry of N-carboxylic anhydride in advance (preliminary crystallization) and add the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent sequentially to said slurry, in which case the oil formation and scaling can be consistently inhibited and, at the same time, crystals with large particle diameter can be obtained.<br>
The suspension amount of the slurry to be prepared in advance in the above preliminary crystallization is not particularly restricted but in consideration of productivity and the like, it is preferably not more than 30 weight %, more preferably not more than 20 weight %, still more preferably not more than 10 weight %, based on the total amount of said N-carboxylic anhydride at completion of crystallization.  The lower limit is usually 0.1 weight %.<br>
The slurry in preliminary crystallization may be formed by adding a predetermined amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent sequentially to the solution of said N-carboxylic<br><br>
14<br>
anhydride in the good solvent (preliminary crystallization) so as to adjust a mixing composition of the good solvent and the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to the composition in which a portion of the compound (1) crystallizes for nucleation or by adding crystals of said N-carboxylic anhydride to the solution of said N-carboxylic anhydride in the good solvent- It is also possible to use both techniques together.<br>
The preferred mixing composition to achieve said suspension amount cannot be defined based on crystallization concentrations and solvent species to be used but, when the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is added to the solution of the compound (I) in the good solvent, the weight ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is preferably 0.1 to 10, more preferably 0.1 to 5, still more preferably 0.1 to 3.<br>
As specific examples, when dichloromethane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or acetone is used as the good solvent, the weight ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent for attaining the suspension amount of the slurry in said preliminary crystallization is preferably 0.2 to 5, more preferably 0.2 to 3, and when ethyl acetate, toluene or the like is used as the good solvent, the weight ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent for attaining the above suspension amount is preferably 0.3 to 7, more preferably 0.3 to 5.  For carrying out satisfactory nucleation and crystal growth in the preliminary crystallization, the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is preferably added in portions or continuously so that crystals will not precipitate all at once in the preliminary crystallization.  Thus, the time period of addition is not less than 1/5 of an hour, and for satisfactory nucleation and crystal growth, generally about 1/2 of an hour, more preferably it is required not less than 1/2 of an hour. In cases where a preliminary crystallization slurry is prepared by adding crystals of the above N-carboxylic anhydride to the solution of said N-carboxylic anhydride in the good solvent,<br><br>

it is advantageous to control the concentration of the solution of said N-carboxylic anhydride in the good solvent not more than the vicinity of the solubility saturation point.  It can be carried out by adjusting the concentration of the solution of the above N-carboxylic anhydride in the good solvent or the temperature of the solution and/or by adding the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in a predetermined amount.<br>
Needless to say, the procedure of carrying out the sequential addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to the solution of said N-carboxylic anhydride in the good solvent over a protracted time and the procedure of stopping the addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent at the time when precipitation of crystals begins to allow the crystals to grow or otherwise controlling the precipitation rate of crystals followed by adding a rest of predetermined amount of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent can be expected to bring about the same effect as the crystallization involving said preliminary crystallization.<br>
Now, the relationship of addition levels of the good solvent and the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent in the crystallization according to the second aspect of the present invention is now described.<br>
At completion of addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, the ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent varies according to the combination of the good solvent and the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to be used and the concentration of the compound (1) in the solution in the good solvent to be used but in consideration of productivity and other factors, the weight ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent is preferably 0.001 to 1, more preferably 0.003 to 0.8, still more preferably 0.01 to 0.5. Specifically, when a halogenated hydrocarbon is used as the good solvent, the ratio is preferably 0.003 to 1, more preferably 0.01 to 0.5. When an aprotic polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or acetone is used as the good<br><br>
16<br>
solvent, the ratio is preferably 0.01 to 0.7, more preferably 0.05to0.5, and when an ester such as ethyl acetate, oran aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene is used as the good solvent/ the ratio is preferably 0.06 to 0.8, more preferably 0.1 to 0.5.<br>
In the above crystallization, by adjusting the ratio of the good solvent to the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent ultimately to a predetermined ratio, not less than 80 weight %, more preferably not less than 90 weight %, still more preferably not less than 95 weight %, of the total amount of said compound (1) can be precipitated and crystals of the above compound (1) not smaller than 200 urn in mean crystal particle diameter can be obtained with a high recovery rate with inhibiting oil formation and with inhibiting scaling amount to not more than 5 weight %, preferably not more than 3 weight %, of the total amount.<br>
In the second aspect of the present invention/ it is preferred to increase the amount of precipitated crystals by<br>
adjusting the liquid temperature to not higher than 25°C after completion of addition of the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent to the solution in the good solvent and before isolating crystals precipitated.  The above liquid temperature is more preferably -30 to 25°C, still more preferably -20 to 15°C.  In this manner, crystals can be caused to precipitate sufficiently and be obtained with a high recovery rate.<br>
The crystallization method of this invention can be used not only as the recrystallization method of the compound (1) but also as the method of isolating the compound (1J from the reaction solution.<br>
The solution of said compound (1J in the good solvent is the same as described hereinbefore.<br>
The crystals thus obtained canbe separatedby the ordinary solid-liquid separation processes such as centrifugation, pressure filtration and suction filtration, preferably washed with an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent, and optionally dried by atmospheric pressure drying or reduced pressure drying (vacuum drying).<br><br>
17<br>
In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, the crystallization can be carried out with good workability while the oil formation and scaling of the above compound (1) are inhibited so that crystals of the compound (1) not smaller than generally about 200 um in mean particle diameter and having good powder characteristics can be obtained stably with a high recovery rate. Obtaining the compound (1) stably as crystals with large particle diameter is expected to contribute a great deal to the stabilisation of the unstable compound (1) during long-term storage or the storage at high temperature.<br>
