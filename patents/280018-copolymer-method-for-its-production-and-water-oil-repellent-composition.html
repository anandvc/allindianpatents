DESCRIPTION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION: COPOLYMER, METHOD FOR ITS PRODUCTION, AND<br>
WATER/OIL REPELLENT COMPOSITION<br>
^TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a copolymer, a method for its production and a<br>
water/oil repellent composition containing such a copolymer.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a method for imparting water and oil repellency to the surface of an article<br>
(such as a fiber product), a method is known which comprises treating the article with a<br>
water/oil repellent composition made of an emulsion wherein a copolymer having<br>
structural units based on a monomer having a polyfluoroalkyi group (hereinafter a<br>
polyfluoroalkyi group will be referred to as an "R' group") having at least 8 carbon<br>
atoms, is dispersed in a medium.<br>
However, recently, EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) has<br>
pointed out that a compound having a perfluoroalkyi group (hereinafter a perfluoroalkyi<br>
group will be referred to as an "R' group") having at least 8 carbon atoms is<br>
decomposed in an environment or a living body and its decomposition product is<br>
accumulated there, thus bringing about a high environmental burden. Accordingly a<br>
copolymer for a water/oil repellent composition having structural units based on a<br>
monomer having an R' group having at most 6 carbon atoms and having structural<br>
units based on a monomer having an R* group having at least 8 carbon atoms reduced<br>
as far as possible is desired.<br>
As a water/oil repellent composition containing such a copolymer, the following<br>
water/oil repellent composition has, for example, been proposed.<br>
A water/oil repellent composition containing, as an essential component, a<br>
copolymer composed substantially of structural units based on the following monomer<br>
(a) and structural units based on the following monomer (b):<br>
Monomer (a): a monomer having an R' group having at most 6 carbon atoms,<br>
etc.<br>
Monomer (b): a (meth)acrylate having an alkyl group having at least 15 carbon<br>
atoms, etc.<br>
However, an article treated with such a water/oil repellent composition is<br>
inadequate in water repellency against water fallen from a high altitude (rainfall)<br>
(hereinafter referred to as dynamic water repellency) and in water repellency after<br>
drying without positively heating after washing (hereinafter referred to as water<br>
repellency after air drying).<br>

improved.<br>
Further, the water/oil repellent composition of the present invention may contain a<br>
copolymer having water and/or oil repellency other than the copolymer of the present<br>
invention (e.g. a copolymer containing many structural units based on the monomer (c),<br>

the case requires. Such a water repellent compound having no fluorine atom may, for<br>
example, be a paraffin compound, an aliphatic amide compound, an alkylethylene urea<br>
compound or a silicon compound.<br>
(Method for producing water/oil repellent composition)<br>
The water/oil repellent composition of the present invention is produced by the<br>
following method (i) or (ii).<br>
(i) A method which comprises polymerizing a monomer mixture comprising the<br>
17<br>
monomer (a) and the monomer (b) and, as the case requires, containing the monomer<br>
(c) and the monomer (d), in a medium in the presence of a surfactant and a<br>
polymerization initiator, to obtain a solution, dispersion or emulsion of a copolymer, and<br>
V as a case requires, adding other media, other surfactants or additives.<br>
(ii) A method which comprises polymerizing a monomer mixture comprising the<br>
monomer (a) and the monomer (b) and, as the case requires, containing the monomer<br>
(c) and the monomer (d), in a medium in the presence of a surfactant and a<br>
polymerization initiator, to obtain a solution, dispersion or emulsion of a copolymer,<br>
then separating the copolymer, and adding to the copolymer, a medium, a surfactant<br>
and an optional additive.<br>
The polymerization of the monomer mixture may be carried out in the same<br>
manner as the polymerization in the above described method for producing a<br>
copolymer<br>
Regarding the water/oil repellent composition of the present invention, the<br>
copolymer is preferably dispersed in the form of particles in the medium. The average<br>
particle size of the copolymer is preferably from 10 to 1,000 nm, more preferably from<br>
10 to 300 nm, particularly preferably from 10 to 250 nm. When the average particle<br>
size is within such a range, a surfactant, a dispersant, etc. are not required in large<br>
amounts, water/oil repellency is good, dyed fabrics can be treated without color dulling,<br>
and the particles are stably-dispersed without precipitation in the medium. The<br>
average particle size of the copolymer is measured by a dynamic light scattering<br>
device, an electron microscope, etc.<br>
The solid content concentration of the emulsion is preferably from 20 to 40<br>
mass% in the emulsion (100 mass%) immediately after the production of the<br>
copolymer Here, the solid content concentration is the concentration including not<br>
only the copolymer but also an emulsifying agent. The content of the copolymer in<br>
the emulsion is preferably from 18 to 40 mass% immediately after the production of the<br>
copolymer.<br>
The solid content concentration of the water/oil repellent composition is<br>
preferably from 0.2 to 5 mass% in the water/oil repellent composition (100 mass%) at<br>
the time of treating articles.<br>
The solid content concentration of the emulsion or the water/oil repellent<br>
composition is calculated from the mass of the emulsion or the water/oil repellent<br>
composition before heating and the mass of it after drying in the convection-drying<br>
machine at the temperature of 120°C for 4 hours.<br>
The above described water/oil repellent composition of the present invention<br>
contains the copolymer of the present invention, whereby it is possible to impart<br>
sufficient dynamic water repellency and water repellency after air drying to the surface<br>
of an article. Further, the copolymer does not have structural units based on a<br>
monomer having an R*" group having at least 8 carbon atoms, whereby it presents little<br>
environmental burden.<br>
In addition, regarding the water/oil repellent composition of the present invention,<br>
the content (the content when the solid content concentration is 20%) of<br>
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PROS), their precursors and<br>
their analogues, environmental impact of which is pointed out, can be reduced to a<br>
level lower than the detection limit of analysis value of LC-MS/MS in the method<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-333564.<br>
The water/oil repellent composition of the present invention may be used alone.<br>
18<br>
or as mixed with another water/oil repellent composition. For example, it is used as<br>
combined with a fluorinated soil release agent which has much hydrophilic component<br>
and little water repellent property, whereby wash-durable water/oil repellent soilurelease<br>
finishing is possible.<br>
'^Article&gt;<br>
The water/oil repellent composition of the present invention is used for water/oil<br>
repellent treatment of an article.<br>
The article to be treated with the water/oil repellent composition of the present<br>
invention may, for example, be fibers (natural fibers, synthetic fibers, blended fibers,<br>
etc.), various fiber products, nonwoven fabrics, resins, paper, leather, metal, stone,<br>
concrete, plaster, or glass.<br>
An example of a method for treating the article is to coat or dip the article with the<br>
water/oil repellent composition by a publicly-known coating method and then to dry it.<br>
Additionally, such an article may be finished to be antistatic, softening,<br>
antibacterial, deodorant or waterproof.<br>
An example of water proofing may be to form a water proof membrane. The<br>
water proof membrane may, for example, be a porous membrane obtained from a<br>
urethane resin or an acryl resin, a nonporous membrane obtained from a urethane<br>
resin or an acryl resin, a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane or a moisture-permeable<br>
water proof membrane which is a combination of the above membranes, etc.<br>
When an article is treated with the water/oil repellent composition of the present<br>
invention, it is possible to impart water/oil repellency of high quality to the article.<br>
Further, it is possible to impart the water/oil repellency even by curing at a low<br>
temperature, with excellent adhesion to the substrate surface. Further, the initial<br>
performance of the treatment can stably be maintained with little deterioration of the<br>
performance by abrasion or washing. Further, when paper is treated, even under a<br>
low temperature drying condition, excellent size property and water/oil repellency can<br>
be imparted to the paper. When a resin, glass or metal surface is, for example,<br>
treated, it is possible to form a water/oil repellent coating film which is excellent in the<br>
film-forming property and exhibits good adhesion to the article.<br>

<physical properties of copolymer><br>
With respect to a copolymer recovered by the following recovering method A,<br>
measurement of the molecular weight and analysis of the copolymer composition were<br>
carried out.<br>
(Copolymer recovery method A)<br>
6 g of an emulsion was concentrated so that the solid content became about 40<br>
mass% to obtain a concentrated liquid. To this concentrated liquid, about 10 g of<br>
tetrahydrofuran (hereinafter referred to as THF) was dropwise added to dissolve the<br>
solid in the concentrated liquid thereby to obtain a THF solution. In a case where the<br>
solid was hardly dissolved, ultrasonic waves were applied. To 60 g of methanol, the<br>
THF solution was dropwise added, followed by stirring to precipitate a solid. The<br>
19<br>
obtained solid was recovered by filtration under reduced pressure. It was vacuumdried<br>
overnight at 35°C to obtain a copolymer.<br>
(Copolymer composition)<br>
L For the analysis of the copolymer composition of the recovered copolymer, ""^FNMR,<br>
""^C-NMR, pyrolysis GC/MS, and automatic sample combustion device-ion<br>
chromatography were used.<br>
From the ^^F-NMR analysis, information relating to the chain length of structural<br>
units based on the monomer (a) is obtainable. Further, from the ^^C-NMR,<br>
information relating to structural units based on a hydrocarbon monomer is obtainable.<br>
Further, a peak of structural units based on the monomer (d1) is observed in the<br>
vicinity of from 10 to 35 ppm. Peaks of structural units based on vinyl chloride are<br>
observed in the vicinity of 45 ppm and 56 ppm. A peak of structural units based on<br>
vinylidene chloride is observed in the vicinity of from 80 to 90 ppm. A peak of<br>
structural units based on the monomer (a) is observed in the vicinity of from 105 to 120<br>
ppm.<br>
From the GC/MS analysis, it is possible to know the detailed structures of<br>
structural units based on the monomers contained in the copolymer.<br>
In the automatic combustion device-ion chromatography analysis, the amounts of<br>
F and CI in the copolymer were quantified. From the amount of F, the proportion of<br>
structural units based on the monomer (a) can be calculated. Further, from the<br>
amount of CI, the proportion of structural units based on the monomer (b) can be<br>
calculated.<br>

nitrogen, then, 24.8 g of VCM was introduced, and a polymerization reaction was<br>
carried out at 60°C for 15 hours with stirring, to obtain an emulsion of a copolymer.<br>
The proportions of the respective monomers in the monomer mixture are shown<br>
in Table 3.<br>
EXAMPLES 12, 16, 17 and 19<br>
An emulsion of a copolymer was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1<br>
except that the charged amounts of the respective materials were changed to the<br>
amounts shown in Table 2.<br>
The proportions of the respective monomers in the monomer mixture are shown<br>
in Table 3. Further, with respect to some Examples, measurement of the molecular<br>
weight of the copolymer was carried out. The molecular weight of the copolymer is<br>
shown in Table 4.<br>

<evaluation of test cloth><br>
An emulsion of the copolymer in each of Examples 1 to 22 was diluted with<br>
distilled water to adjust the solid content concentration to be 10 mass%, then, a<br>
i trimethyiolmelamine resin (BECKAMINE M-3, manufactured by DIC Corporation) as a<br>
thermosetting agent and an organic amine salt catalyst (Accelerator ACX,<br>
manufactured by DIC Corporation) as a thermosetting catalyst were added so that the<br>
respective concentrations became 0.3 mass%, and further, a blocked isocyanate<br>
(MEIKANATE TP-10, manufactured by Meisei Chemical Works, Ltd.) as a combination<br>
assisting agent was added so that the concentration became 0.6 mass%, thereby to<br>
obtain a water/oil repellent composition.<br>
In the water/oil repellent composition, a dyed nylon cloth was dipped and<br>
squeezed so that the wet pickup became 42 mass%. This cloth was dried under the<br>
following heating condition A or B to obtain a test cloth. With respect to the test cloth,<br>
water repellency (water repellency after air drying), oil repellency and dynamic water<br>
repellency were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
Heating condition A: drying at 110°C for 90 seconds, followed by drying at 170°C<br>
for 60 seconds.<br>
Heating condition B: drying at 140°C for 90 seconds.<br>
It is evident that Examples of the present invention are capable of imparting<br>
dynamic water repellency and at the same time have excellent effects for water<br>
repellency and oil repellency.<br>
