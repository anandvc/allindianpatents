				<td>TWO LINE GAS SPECTROSCOPY CALIBRATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention is directed toward a method and apparatus for calibrating an<br>
absorption spectroscopy system and more particularly toward a method and apparatus for<br>
determining a gas concentration within a combustion chamber using tunable diode laser<br>
absorption spectroscopy in installations where supplemental gas is present in the<br>
spectroscopy path.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]	A large percentage of the electrical power generated in the United States of America<br>
is created in coal combustion power plants. The bulk of worldwide electricity production<br>
similarly relies on coal as a primary energy source. It is likely that coal will Temain a primary<br>
energy source in the foreseeable future given the long term environmental concerns with the<br>
storage of waste from nuclear energy generation operations, and the inefficiencies associated<br>
with solar powered electrical generation. In addition vast worldwide coal reserves exist<br>
sufficient for at least 200 years of energy production at current rates.<br>
[0003]	There is and will continue to be, however, a high demand to reduce the emissions of<br>
pollutants associated with coal fired electrical energy generation, and to increase the overall<br>
efficiency of the coal fired generation process. The monitoring of the O2 and other gas levels<br>
within a combustion chamber or power plant furnace is one key component of efficiency<br>
monitoring and control. Traditionally, in power plants and other industrial combustion<br>
settings the efficiency of the combustion process and the level of pollution emission have<br>
been determined indirectly through measurements taken on extracted gas samples with<br>
techniques such as non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) photometry. Extractive sampling systems<br>
are not particularly well suited to closed loop control of a combustion process since a<br>
1<br><br>
significant delay can be introduced between the time of gas extraction and the ultimate<br>
analysis. In addition, extractive processes generally result in a single point measurement<br>
which may or may not be representative of the actual concentration of the measured species<br>
within what can be a highly variable and dynamic combustion process chamber.<br>
[0004]	Laser based optical species sensors have recently been implemented to address the<br>
concerns associated with extraction measurement techniques. Laser based measurement<br>
techniques can be implemented in situ and offer the further advantage of high speed feedback<br>
suitable for dynamic process control. A particularly promising technique for measuring<br>
combustion gas composition, temperature and otner comuustion parameters is tunau±e diode<br>
laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). TDLAS is typically implemented with diode lasers<br>
operating in the near-infrared and mid-infrared spectral regions. Suitable lasers have been<br>
extensively developed for use in the telecommunications industry and are, therefore, readily<br>
available for TDLAS applications. Various techniques of TDLAS which are more or less<br>
suitable for the sensing and control of combustion processes have been developed.<br>
Commonly known techniques are wavelength modulation spectroscopy, frequency<br>
modulation spectroscopy and direct absorption spectroscopy. Each of these techniques is<br>
based upon a predetenrrined relationship between the quantity and nature of laser light<br>
received by a detector after the light has been transmitted through a combustion process<br>
chamber and absorbed in specific spectral bands which are characteristic of the gases present<br>
in the process or combustion chamber. The absorption spectrum received by the detector is<br>
used to determine the quantity of the gas species under analysis plus associated combustion<br>
parameters such as temperature.<br>
[0005]	For example, Von Drasek et al, United States Patent Application Serial Number<br>
2002/0031737A1, teaches a method and apparatus of using tunable diode lasers for the<br>
monitoring and/or control of high temperature processes. Von Drasek features the use of<br>
2<br><br>
direct absorption spectroscopy to determine the relative concentration of rmmerous<br>
combustion species, temperature and other parameters. Calabro, United States Patent<br>
Number 5,813,767, teaches a similar system for monitoring combustion and pollutants<br>
developed in a combustion chamber. Calabro utilizes an indirect spectroscopy technique<br>
wherein observed Doppler broadening of the shape of an absorption feature serves as the<br>
basis for temperature analysis.<br>
[0006]	Teichert, Fernholz, and Ebert have extended the use of TDLAS as a known laboratory<br>
analysis technique to a workable field solution suitable for the sensing of certain combustion<br>
paraiu.ei.er3 witinti the iirrnace o± a niu. sizeu coai ureu power piant. In tiierr articie,<br>
"Simultaneous in situ Measurement of CO, H2O, and Gas Temperature in a Full-Sized, Coal-<br>
Fired Power Plant by Near-Infrared Diode Lasers," (Applied Optics, 42(12):2043, 20 April<br>
2003) the authors present a successful implementation of direct absorption spectroscopy at a<br>
coal fired power plant and discuss certain technical challenges resulting from the extremely<br>
large scale and violent nature of the coal burning process. In particular, typical coal fired<br>
power plants have combustion chamber diameters of 10-20 meters. The plants are fired by<br>
pulverized coal, which results in a combustion process which both obscures the transmission<br>
of laser tight because of the high dust load and which is extremely luminous. In addition,<br>
various strong disturbances are found under power plant combustion conditions. The overall<br>
transmission rate of light through the process chamber will fluctuate dramatically over time<br>
as a result of broadband absorption, scattering by particles or beam steering owing to<br>
refractive-index fluctuations. There is also intense thermal background radiation from the<br>
burning coal particles which can interfere with detector signals. The environment outside of<br>
the power plant boiler also makes the implementation of a TDLAS sensing or control system<br>
problematic. For example, any electronics, optics or other sensitive spectroscopy<br>
components must be positioned away from intense heat, or adequately shielded and cooled<br>
3<br><br>
Even though, the implementation of a TDLAS system is extremely difficult under these<br>
conditions, TDLAS is particularly well suited to monitor and control a coal comljustion<br>
process. A comprehensive discussion of the use of TDLAS to monitor and control a<br>
combustion process is contained in commonly assigned and copending PCT Application<br>
Serial Number PCT/US04/010048, filed March 31, 2004, entitled METHOD AND<br>
APPARATUS FOR THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF COMBUSTION, which<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0007]	Typically, the electronic, optical, and other sensitive spectroscopy components which<br>
must communicate with the interior of a combustion chamber are associated with a special<br>
opening into the combustion chamber. This opening or port will often feature a quartz, fused<br>
silica, or other window fabricated from a transparent material which is stable at the extremely<br>
high temperatures associated with the interior of the combustion chamber. Alternatively, the<br>
opening may not include a transparent window. In either case, the opening in a typical coal<br>
fired power plant must transverse the furnace wall and may be about 18 inches long. As<br>
described above, the interior of the combustion chamber is an extremely hostile environment<br>
full of pulverized coal, ash, and other particulate matter. Thus, there is a tendency for the<br>
opening or port to become clogged or partially blocked with ash and other particulate matter.<br>
[0008]	Port blockage can be addressed by flowing purge air through the port. The purge air<br>
may be constantly flowed through the port from a captive purge gas supply or, more<br>
commonly, ambient air from outside of the combustion chamber may be utilized Typically,<br>
purge air will thus include significant amounts of Oj relative to the O2 levels within the<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
[0009]	It is useful to monitor the O2 or other gas levels as part of the TDLAS monitoring and<br>
control of a combustion process. The introduction of O2 containing purge gas significantly<br>
complicates this measurement. Depending on the location in the furnace where a<br>
4<br><br>
measurement is taken, the purge gas may include anywhere from 30% to 60% of the total O2<br>
present along a TDLAS path. Only the O2 in the furnace is of interest for proper combustion<br>
control. Similarly any absorption spectroscopy measurement of a quantity of gas is<br>
complicated if a second quantity of the gas is also present in the measurement path. Thus a<br>
need exists for a method to accurately quantify the effect of purge gas O2 on the desired<br>
combustion chamber O2 measurement. The present invention is directed to overcoming one<br>
or more of the problems discussed above.<br>
SUMMARU OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	One aspect of the present invention is a method of calibrating an absorption<br>
spectroscopy measurement where the probe laser path transverses both a quantity of the gas<br>
of interest, and a quantity of a spectroscopically similar or identical gas which is irrelevant to<br>
the desired measurement, but has the potential interfere with the measurement. The<br>
calibration method includes projecting laser light through a sample containing a first quantity<br>
of a gas of interest and a second irrelevant quantity of a spectroscopically identical or similar<br>
gas. The method also includes measuring first and second spectroscopic absorption of the<br>
laser light over specific first and second absorption lines. A functional relationship is<br>
determined between the first and second measured spectroscopic absorptions and two<br>
unknown variables. The functional relationships may then be simultaneously solved to<br>
determine one or both unknown variables and thereby to obtain a measurement relating to the<br>
first quantity of the gas of .interest, calibrated for the second irrelevant quantity of gas.<br>
[0011]	The method may also include the determination of physical parameters such as<br>
calculating a mean temperature within the first quantity of the gas of interest, measuring a<br>
path length through the first quantity of the gas of interest or measuring a second path length<br>
5<br><br>
through the second quantity of a spectroscopicaHy identical OT similar gas. The functional<br>
relationships may be determined with respect to these measured parameters.<br>
[0012]	The functional relationships may also be determined with respect to known physical<br>
constants including, but not limited to a first select absorption line strength associated with<br>
the first select absorption line, a second select absorption line strength associated with the<br>
second select absorption line, a lower energy state associated with the first select absorption<br>
line a lower energy state associated with the second select absorption line; and a gas<br>
concentration of the gas of interest contained within the second quantity of a<br>
spectroscopicaliy iuentica± or siTrtuar gas.<br>
[0013]	Que embodiment of the present invention is a method of determining the O2 or other<br>
gas of interest concentration within a combustion chamber using tunable diode laser<br>
absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) where at least one laser is positioned to transmit laser light<br>
through at least one opening into a combustion chamber, and where an O2 containing purge<br>
gas flow is applied to the opening. The method includes projecting laser light through the<br>
opening and through the combustion vessel, measuring first and second spectroscopic<br>
absorptions of the laser light over first and second select O2 absorption lines. In addition, a<br>
first functional relationship between the first measured spectroscopic absorption and two<br>
unknown variables, namely the temperature of the O2 containing purge gas and the O2<br>
concentration within the combustion chamber, is determined Similarly, a second functional<br>
relationship between the second measured spectroscopic absorption and the two unknown<br>
variables is determined Finally, the first and second functional relationships may be solved<br>
to determine the O2 concentration within the combustion chamber.<br>
[0014]	The method may also include calculating a temperature within the combustion<br>
chamber, measuring a path length through the combustion chamber, and measuring a purge<br>
path length associated with any opening. In this aspect of the invention, the first and second<br>
6<br><br>
functional relationships are determined with respect to the measured temperature within the<br>
combustion chamber, the measured path length through the combustion chamber, and the<br>
measured purge path length, as well as the unknown variables discussed above. The<br>
determination of the first and second functional relationships may be made with Tespect to<br>
known physical constants including the first and second select O2 absorption line strengths,<br>
the lower energy states associated with each O2 absorption line selected, and the O2<br>
concentration of the O2 containing purge gas flow.<br>
[0015]	The temperature within the combustion chamber may be calculated by any suitable<br><br>
additionally measured over at least two H2O absorption lines.<br>
[0016]	The first and second select O2 absorption lines may be selected from all possible 0%<br>
absorption lines, however, the line associated with the absorption of light having a<br>
wavelength of 760.258nm and the line associated with the absorption of light having a<br>
wavelength of 760.455nm are particularly well suited for use as the first and second select O2<br>
absorption lines.<br>
[0017]	Another aspect of the present invention is an apparatus for deterrnining the O2<br>
concentration within a combustion chamber. The apparatus includes at least one opening into<br>
the combustion chamber, a tunable diode laser positioned to transmit light through the<br>
opening and the combustion chamber, and a source of O2 containing purge gas in fluid<br>
communication with the opening. Also included in the apparatus are means for measuring a<br>
first spectroscopic absorption line, a second spectroscopic absorption line, and for<br>
deterrruning functional relationships and solving the relationships for the O2 concentration<br>
within the combustion chamber, all as described above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0021]	An apparatus 10 suitable for implementation of the present invention is shown in the<br>
block diagram of Figure 1. The apparatus 10 includes a combustion chamber 12, which is<br>
shown in Figure 1 as the furnace of a coal fired power plant. Access to the interior of the<br>
combustion chamber 12 is provided by one or more openings 14 formed in the walls of the<br>
combustion chamber 12. A laser 16 suitable for performing tunable diode laser absorption<br>
spectroscopy (TDLAS) is associated with the combustion chamber 12 and positioned at an<br>
opening 14 such that the laser 16 may project laser light through the opening 14 and<br>
combustion chamber 12, all as shown in Figure 1. Opposite the combustion chamber 12 from<br>
the laser 16 is a detector 18 which is shown as associated with a second, opening 14.<br>
Alternatively, the detector 18 could be associated with the same opening 14 as the laser 16<br>
with the laser light being received after a reflected double pass through the combustion<br>
chamber 12.<br>
[0022]	The environment within a combustion chamber 12 is extremely hostile. A coal fired<br>
power plant, for example, is fed by pulverized coal which is blown into the combustion<br>
chamber 12 at an extremely high rate. Thus, the combustion chamber 12 is a maelstrom of<br>
coal dust, ash, and other particulate matter. These particulates will quickly clog any opening<br>
8<br><br>
14 associated with the combustion chamber 12 or coat and obscure any 'window associated<br>
with the opening 14.<br>
[0023]	An opening 14 may be maintained in a relatively unobscured manner by flowing<br>
purge gas from a purge gas source 20 through the opening 14 and into the combustion<br>
chamber 12, thus actively clearing dust, ash, and other particulate matter. The purge gas<br>
source 20 may be a self contained unit holding a select gas under pressure. More typically, ■<br>
the purge gas source 20 will merely be a compressor feeding air from outside the combustion<br>
chamber 12 through any opening 14. As discussed in detail below, if air or other O2<br>
containing purge gas is utilized, O2 is introduced directly into the probe path of the laser 16.<br>
The introduction of O2 directly into the probe path complicates a desired measurement of O2<br>
concentration within the combustion chamber 12.<br>
[0024]	The present invention is primarily described as an apparatus and method for<br>
calibrating the TDLAS measurement of gas concentrations or temperatures within a<br>
combustion chamber where the same or a spectroscopically similar gas is introduced to purge<br>
an opening. The invention is not limited to such embodiments however. The calibration<br>
method may be applied to any spectroscopic analysis implementation where light is<br>
transmitted through a region containing a gas of interest, and also through aTegion containing<br>
a quantity of other gas which could provide a false signal. Thus the calibration aspects of the<br>
invention have broad application to any implementation of gas absorption spectroscopy.<br>
[0025]	An apparatus 10 suitable for a combustion chamber implementation of the present<br>
invention is more specifically described and shown in Figure 2. The sensing apparatus 10<br>
performs tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) using laser light from a series<br>
of tunable diode lasers 32 lasing at select frequencies preferably in the near-infrared or mid-<br>
infrared spectrum. The output of each tunable diode laser 32 is coupled to an individual<br>
optical fiber which may be a single mode optical fiber 34 and routed to a multiplexer 36. As<br>
9<br><br>
used herein, "coupled", "optically coupled" or "in optical communication with" is defined as<br>
a functional relationship between counterparts where tight can pass from a first component to<br>
a second component either through or not through intermediate components or free space.<br>
Within the multiplexer 36 the laser tight of some or all of the frequencies generated is<br>
multiplexed to form a multiplexed probe beam having multiple select frequencies. The<br>
multiplexed probe beam is coupled to a pitch side optical fiber 38 and transmitted to a pitch<br>
optic 40 or collimator operatively associated with a process chamber which, in Figure 2, is<br>
shown as a combustion chamber 42.<br>
[WZ.OJ	ine piiun UJJUO tu la unciiicu IAJ piujcui. uic jj-iuiuj-ucft-tu. piuoc ucaun uunjugJi U_L^<br>
combustion chamber 42. Across the combustion chamber 42 in optical communication with<br>
the pitch optic 40 is a catch optic 44. The catch optic 44 is preferably substantially opposite<br>
the pitch optic 40 and is operatively associated with the combustion chamber 42. The catch<br>
optic 44 is positioned and oriented to receive the multiplexed probe beam projected through<br>
the combustion chamber 42. The catch optic 44 is optically coupled to a catch side optical<br>
fiber 46 which transmits the portion of the multiplexed probe beam which is received by the<br>
catch optic 44 to a demultiplexer 48. Within the demultiplexer 48 the portion of the<br>
multiplexed probe beam received by the catch optic 44 is demultiplexed and each wavelength<br>
of demultiplexed laser light is coupled to an output optical fiber 50. Each output optical fiber<br>
50 in turn is optically coupled to a detector 52, which typically is a photodetector sensitive to<br>
one of the select frequencies of laser tight generated and multiplexed to form the probe beam.<br>
The detectors 52 generate an electrical signal based upon the nature and quantity of light<br>
transmitted to the detector 52 at the detector frequency. The electrical signal from each<br>
detector 52 is typically digitized and analyzed in data processing system 54. As discussed in<br>
detail below, the digitized and analyzed data can be used to sense physical parameters within<br>
the process chamber including but not limited to the concentrations of various gas species and<br>
10<br><br>
the combustion temperature -within the combustion chamber 42. The data processing system<br>
54 can farther be used to send signals through a feedback loop 56 to combustion control<br>
apparatus 58 and thereby actively control select process parameters. In the case of a<br>
combustion process, the process parameters controlled can include fuel (e.g., pulverized coal)<br>
feed rates; oxygen feed rates and catalyst or chemical agent addition rates. The use of fiber<br>
optic coupling of the electronic and optical components on both the pitch and catch sides of<br>
the sensing apparatus 30 allows delicate and temperature sensitive apparatus such as the<br>
tunable diode lasers 32, detectors 52 and data processing system 54 to be located in a control<br>
room having a stable operating environment. Thus, only the relatively robust pitch and catcli<br>
optics 40,44 need be situated near the hostile environment of the combustion chamber 42.<br>
[0027]	The present invention may be implemented with any type of gas adsorption<br>
spectroscopy, including but not limited to tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy<br>
(TDLAS). TDLAS is performed with techniques known to those skilled in the art of laser<br>
spectroscopy. Generally, TDLAS is performed by the transmission of laser fight through a<br>
target environment, followed by the detection of the absorption of the laser light at specific<br>
wavelengths, due to target gases, for example carbon monoxide or oxygen. Spectral analysis<br>
of the detected light allows identification of the type and quantity of gas along the laser path.<br>
The details of direct absorption spectroscopy are discussed in Teichert, Fernholz, and Ebert,<br>
"Simultaneous in situ Measurement of CO, H2O, and Gas Temperature in a Full-Sized, Coal-<br>
Fired Power Plant by Near-Infrared Diode Lasers," (Applied Optics, 42(12):2043, 20 April<br>
2003); which reference is incorporated herein in its entirety. The non-contact nature of laser<br>
absorption spectroscopy makes it well-suited for harsh environments such as the combustion<br>
zone of a coal-fired power plant, or flammable or toxic environments where other probes<br>
cannot be used. The use of laser light provides the high brightness necessary to get detectible<br>
transmission in the presence of severe attenuation (typically greater than 99.9% loss of light)<br>
11<br><br>
that may be seen in some of these environments. To better withstand the harsh conditions of<br>
the target applications, the laser light may be brought in to the target environment through<br>
armored optical fiber.<br>
[0028]	Effective sensing of the temperature or concentration of multiple combustion process<br>
component gasses requires the performance of TDLAS with multiple widely spaced<br>
frequencies of laser light. The frequencies selected must match the absorption lines of the<br>
transitions being monitored For example, it may be desired to monitor N02 at a wavelength<br>
of 670nm to approximate emission NO concentrations. It is also quite useful to monitor<br>
oxygen, water and carbon monoxide in a coal-fired utility boiler to extract both temperature<br>
and concentration data. In a power plant implementation, suitable absorption lines, and thus<br>
suitable lasing frequencies can be selected based upon an assumption that the laser probe path<br>
length through a combustion chamber is equal tolO meters and that the mole fraction of each<br>
species is CO (1%), 02 (4%), C02 (10%), and H20 (10%). For frequency selection purposes,<br>
the process temperature can be assumed to be 1800 K which is slightly higher than what is<br>
typically observed in a coal fired plant, but the cushion serves as a safety factor in the<br>
calculations. Other types of gas absorption spectroscopy implementations will be<br>
accompanied by different assumptions.<br>
[0029]	With respect to the coal fired power plant example, three water absorption lines can<br>
be selected for TDLAS that meet the following criteria:<br>
1.	Lower state energy of ~ 1000, 2000, and 3000cm"1 respectively<br>
2.	Provides a convenient absorbance of around 0.1 - 0.4 that, in turn, leads to<br>
approximately 20% beam absorption on resonance.<br>
3.	The optimum situation is to utilize transitions in the 1250 to 1650nm region where<br>
inexpensive, high power, DFB diode telecommunications lasers are available.<br>
4.	The transitions must be well separated to allow for easy multiplexing.<br>
12<br><br>
5. The selected wavelength must be efficiently diffracted by the existing (demultiplexer<br>
gratings.<br>
[0030]	Suitable water lines occur at the following wavelengths:<br>

1394.5305	7170.872	1045.058	6.65	6.8 %	72%<br>
[0031]	With respect to water, no interference from any other combustion gases is anticipated.<br>
The most likely species to interfere, CO2 has been modeled in a power plant setting and there<br>
are no strong, interfering lines in the 1.3 -1.4 micron region.<br>
[0032]	Similarly, a suitable carbon monoxide line can be selected based on the work of Ebert<br>
referenced and incorporated above. A suitable carbon monoxide line is found at 1559.562nm<br>
using the R(24) line in a coal-fired utility boiler. Selection of this line avoids interference<br>
from water and carbon dioxide. Known gratings are quite efficient in this wavelength region<br>
since it is in the optical communications C band The absorbance at this wavelength is<br>
expected to be 0.7%.<br>
[0033]	In addition, oxygen can be measured at 760.0932nm. The preferred (de)multiplexing<br>
grating efficiency calculates to be only 40% in this region, however suitable laser power<br>
should be available for reasonable measurement efficiency.<br>
[0034]	As discussed herein, the use of fiber coupling on both the pitch and catch sides of a<br>
TDLAS sensing apparatus requires critical alignment of the pitch and catch optics. Active<br>
13<br><br>
alignment is preferably accomplished with a select alignment wavelength. One possible<br>
alignment wavelength is 660nm because high power (45 mW) diodes are available at (his<br>
frequency and 660nm would be near the peak of 14th order grating operation. Other<br>
alignment wavelengths may be determined to be equally or more suitable.<br>
[0035]	In summary, a reasonable set of wavelengths selected for multiplexing to a probe<br>
beam for TDLAS as embodied in the present invention are as shown in Table 2. It should be<br>
noted that this wavelength set is for one embodiment of a TDLAS sensing apparatus suitable<br>
for the sensing and control of a coal fired power plant Other wavelength sets can be equally<br>
suitable.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
Purpose	Wavelength (rrm)<br>

O2 b-a band	760.0932<br>
H2O (moderate temp, line)	1349.0849<br>
H20 (high temp, line)	1376.4507<br>
H20 (low temp, line)	1394.5305<br>

[0036]	A particular advantage of TDLAS with a wavelength-multiplexed probe beam is<br>
increased accuracy of temperature measurements. In order to make accurate concentration<br>
measurements with TDLAS, the temperature of the monitored gas must be known. The<br>
strength of a molecular absorption is a function of temperature. Thus, to convert the<br>
amplitude of an absorption feature to concentration, the temperature must be known. Certain<br>
previous attempts to measure the concentration of combustion species such as CO suffer from<br>
insufficiently accurate temperature measurements leading to errors in quantification. This is<br>
14<br><br>
particularly true for diode laser based ammonia slip monitors that have traditionally not<br>
incorporated temperature measurement at all. In the sensing system of the present invention,<br>
temperature may be determined by measuring the ratio of the intensity of two or more<br>
molecular water lines. The ratio of the integrated intensity of two lines is a function of<br>
temperature only (assuming constant total system pressure). Thus, in principle, two lines<br>
provide an accurate temperature. However, in the case of a non-uniform temperature<br>
distribution (as is typically found within an industrial combustion process), two lines do not<br>
suffice to determine the temperature distribution. In such a non-uniform temperature<br>
distribution, two lines can only determine a "path-averaged" temperature. In contrast,<br>
measuring the integrated amplitude of more than two lines (of the same species) allows<br>
temperature non-uniformity to be probed. An example of this technique has been<br>
demonstrated using oxygen as the probe molecule by Sanders, Wang, Jeffries and Hanson in<br>
"Applied Optics" (volume 40, number 24, 20 August 2001), which reference is incorporated<br>
herein in its entirety. The preferred technique relies on the fact that the distribution of peak<br>
intensities measured along a line of sight is not the same for a path at an average temperature<br>
of 500 K, for example, as it is where one half of the path is at 300 K and the other half is at<br>
700 K.<br>
[0037]	In addition to the benefit of more accurate temperature measurement, the use of a<br>
multiplexed probe beam can allow for the simultaneous monitoring of more than one<br>
combustion gas species, allowing for more refined control over the combustion process.<br>
[0038]	An important attribute of the application of TDLAS to combustion monitoring and<br>
control as described above is the ability to measure O2 levels in the furnace or combustion<br>
chamber 12. Many furnace designs include a purge gas supply 20 which helps to keep the<br>
openings 14 clear of ash. The purge gas supply 20 is typically constantly flowing during<br>
furnace operation and includes significant amounts of O2 relative to the total O2 along the<br>
15<br><br>
laser path. Depending on the location in the furnace the purge air may include anywhere from<br>
30-60% of the total 02 along the path, though this percentage is constant for a given location.<br>
Since it is only the O2 in die furnace which is of interest the additional (purge air) O2 must be<br>
accurately quantified.<br>
[0039]	Figure 1 illustrates in block diagram form the path of the laser light as it first passes<br>
through an opening 14 and through the combustion chamber 12. O2 is present in varying<br>
concentrations throughout the path. In the following equations, L denotes path length, T is<br>
temperature and X02 is the Oxygen concentration. Subscripts P and F denote purge and<br>
iiuiiaoc, lcspti/uvciy.<br>
(1)	Ai = F(Si,X02J ,X02J?, Ei,Tp ,Tp , Lp,Lp)<br>
(2)	A2 = F(S2 , XO2,F , X02JP, E2, Tp , Tp , Lp , Lp)<br>
[0040]	Absorbances Ai and A2 may be measured with the TDLAS apparatus, and have<br>
known functional dependencies on absorption line strength, S, furnace O2 concentration<br>
X02J, purge flow O2 concentration Xo2,p, lower state absorption line energy, E, furnace<br>
temperatures TF, purge flow temperature Tp, furnace path length Lp 22 and purge path length<br>
Lp 24. Absorption line strengths and lower state energies are know physical constants. Path<br>
lengths 22, 24 may be manually measured. A temperature in the combustion chamber 12<br>
may be determined from other measurements (the TDLAS monitoring of two or more water<br>
absorption lines in particular). The 02 concentration in the purge gas is typically equal to the<br>
ambient concentration, 21%, assuming that outside air is forced through the opening 14 as<br>
pmge gas. This leaves two unknowns: Xay? and Tp; the 02 concentration in the combustion<br>
chamber 12 and (he temperature of the purge air.<br>
16<br><br>
[0041]	Two independent equations relating the measured absorbance and the two unknowns<br>
may thus be derived by measuring O2 at two distinct absorption lines, each with different line<br>
strengths and different lower state energies.<br>
(3)	Ai = Fi(X02,F,Tp)<br>
(4)	A2 = F2(Xo2*,TP)<br>
[0042]	The two (nonlinear) functional relationships (3) and (4) may be solved for the two<br>
unknowns XO2,F and Tp by measuring the absorbances Ai and A2. Then, the relationship<br>
between XO2JF and Tp may be constructed and solved using a nonlinear solution method such<br>
as the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method and oilier methods of solving<br>
multiple nonlinear functional relationships use an iterative process to approach possible roots<br>
of the functions. The result will be two curves, the intersection of which determines the<br>
values of X02J and Tp that simultaneously solve equations (3) and (4).<br>
[0043]	Figure 3 is a representation of a solution to equations (3) and (4). Figure 3<br>
demonstrates two curves relating purge air temperature to furnace O2 concentration as<br>
measured at two different O2 lines located near the 760nm O2 absorption band head. The<br>
measurements, which are represented in Figure 2, were made at an active coal fibred power<br>
plant The intersection point shown in Figure 3 indicates a purge air temperature of 400 K<br>
and a furnace O2 concentration of 2.1%.<br>
[0044]	The curves in Figure 3 are the results of the calibration approach of the present<br>
invention being applied to an installation measured while the combustion settings were steady<br>
state. The present invention is particularly well suited to O2 determinations under dynamic<br>
operating conditions as well.<br>
[0045]	The example set forth in detail above concerns the calibration of a TDLAS<br>
measurement of O2 in a power plant combustion chamber setting. The calibration method is<br>
particularly useful since supplemental O2 is typically introduced through a purge gas supply,<br>
17<br><br>
•which, will complicate the desired measurement The method described above is applicable<br>
to any gas absorption spectroscopy implementation where the probe laser is transmitted<br>
across both a region containing the gas of interest, and a region containing supplemental gas<br>
which, would otherwise skew the spectroscopic analysis.<br>

number of embodiments, it would be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in the<br>
form and details may be made to the various embodiments disclosed herein without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention and that the various embodiments disclosed herein<br>
