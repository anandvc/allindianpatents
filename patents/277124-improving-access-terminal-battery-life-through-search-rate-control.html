IMPROVING ACCESS TERMINAL BATTERY LIFE THROUGH SEARCH<br>
RATE CONTROL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/948,935 entitled "The method and apparatus for reducing the number of attempts made by UE to decode WCDMA NCELL" which was filled July 10, 2007, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002]	The  present  aspects  relate  to  wireless  communication  devices,  and  more<br>
particularly, to apparatus and methods for improving access terminal battery life through search rate control.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	UMTS   coverage   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   "WCDMA   coverage,"   "3G<br>
coverage," or simply as "3G") is not ubiquitous and for sometime will remain as islands of coverage with GSM/GPRS/Edge coverage (hereinafter referred to as "2G coverage" or simply as "2G") as the "fall back" technology that provides coverage to users leaving WCDMA coverage.<br>
[0004]	Once a user equipment (UE), which can also be referred to as a mobile, an<br>
access terminal, or other similar term), is camped on 2G cells, the UE reads the system information on the 2G cells to decide if the UE needs to start searching for WCDMA cells or not.<br>
[0005]	If the 2G cells contain the WCDMA NCELL list, then the UE is required to<br>
search for WCDMA cells every 30 seconds until all the primary synchronization codes (PSC) specified in the NCELL list are identified.<br>
[0006]	If UE is camped on a cell, which has the WCDMA NCELL list defined, but the<br>
WCDMA does not cover the entire area of the GSM cell, then the UE in such an area would be searching for WCMDA cells every 30 seconds and significantly reduce its battery life by so doing.   Therefore, it would be desirable to have mechanisms and<br>
 <br>

techniques that can lead to improvements in UE battery life for UEs on the edge of WCDMA coverage (3G coverage), while camped on in GSM/GPRS (2G).<br>

Moreover, various embodiments are described herein in connection with a base station.    A base station can be utilized for communicating with access<br>
 <br>
061965<br>
5<br>
terminal(s) and can also be referred to as an access point, Node B, eNodeB or some other terminology.<br>
|0024]	Moreover, various aspects or features described herein can be implemented as a<br>
method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques. The term "article of manufacture" as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer-readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips, etc.), optica! disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), etc.), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., EPROM, card, stick, key drive, etc). Additionally, various storage media described herein can represent one or more devices and/or other machine-readable media for storing information. The term 'machine-readable medium" can include, without being limited to, wireless channels and various other media capable of storing, containing, and/or carrying instruction(s) and/or data.<br>
[0025]	Additionally, while embodiments are generally described with respect to a<br>
communications system, those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments can be applied to any design employing finite-precision arithmetic, including both fixed-point and floating-point data representations. It is to be appreciated that the systems and/or methods described herein can be employed with any suitable type of design and all such types of design(s) are intended to fall within the scope of the hereto appended claims.<br>
[0026]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a wireless communication system 100 is illustrated in<br>
accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System 100 comprises a base station 102 that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas 104 and 106, another group can comprise antennas 108 and 110, and an additional group can include antennas 112 and 114. Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group. Base station 102 can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
 <br>
061965<br>
 <br>
6<br>
 <br>
[00271	Base station 102 can communicate with one or more mobile devices such as<br>
mobile device 116 and mobile device 122; however, it is to be appreciated that base station 102 can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices 116 and 122. Mobile devices 116 and 122 can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system 100. As depicted, mobile device 116 is in communication with antennas 112 and 114, where antennas 1 12 and 1 14 transmit information to mobile device 116 over a forward link 1 18 and receive information from mobile device 116 over a reverse link 120, Moreover, mobile device 122 is in communication with antennas 104 and 106, where antennas 104 and 106 transmit information to mobile device 122 over a forward link 124 and receive information from mobile device 122 over a reverse link 126. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link 118 can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link 120, and forward link 124 can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link 126, for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link ! 18 and reverse link 120 can utilize a common frequency band and forward link 124 and reverse link 126 can utilize a common frequency band.<br>
[00281	Each  group of antennas  and/or the area  in  which  they are designated  to<br>
communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station 102. For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station 102. In communication over forward links 118 and 124, the transmitting antennas of base station 102 can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links 118 and 124 for mobile devices 116 and 122. This can be provided by using a precoder to steer signals in desired directions, for example. Also, while base station 102 utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices 116 and 122 scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring ceiis can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices. Moreover, mobile devices 1 16 and 122 can communicate directly with one another using a peer-to-peer or ad hoc technology in one example.<br>
[0029]	According to an example, system 100 can be a multiple-input multiple-output<br>
(MIMO) communication system.  Further, system 100 can utilize any type of duplexing<br>
 <br>
061 %S<br>
7<br>
technique (e.g., FDD and TDD, and the like) to divide communication channels (.#., forward link channels or reverse link channels. Moreover, the system 100 can be a multiple-bearer system. A bearer can be an information path of defined capacity, delay, bit error rate. etc. Mobile devices I 16 and !22 can each serve one or more radio bearers. The mobile devices 1 16 and 122 can employ uplink rate control mechanisms to manage and/or share uplink resources across the one or more radio bearers. In one example, the mobile devices 116 and 122 can utilize token bucket mechanisms to serve the radio bearers and to enforce uplink rate limitations.<br>
[0030]	Pursuant to an illustration, each bearer can have an associated prioritized bit rate<br>
(PBR), maximum bit. rate (MBR) and guaranteed bit rate (GBR). The mobile devices 116 and 122 can serve the radio bearers based, at least in part, on the associated bit rate values. The bit rate values can also be employed to calculate queue sizes that account for PBR and MBR for each bearer. The queue sizes can be included in uplink resource requests transmitted by the mobile devices 116 and 122 to the base station 102. The base station 102 can schedule uplink resources for mobile device 116 and 122 based upon respective uplink requests and included queue sizes.<br>
[00311	FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a transmitter system 210 (also known as the access<br>
point) and a receiver system 250 (also known as access terminal) in a MIMO system 200. At the transmitter system 210, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source 212 to a transmitter (TX) data processor 214.<br>
[0032]	In an embodiment, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit<br>
antenna. TX data processor 214 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br>
[0033]	The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using<br>
OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QSPK, M-PSK. or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and nioduiation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by processor 230.<br>
 <br>
06 I %S<br>
8<br>
[0034]	The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO<br>
processor 220, which may further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 220 then provides Nr modulation symbol streams to /V7-transmitters (TMTR) 222a through 222t. In certain embodiments, TX MIMO processor 220 applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0035]	Each transmitter 222 receives and processes a respective symbol stream to<br>
provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over (he MIMO channel NT modulated signals from transmitters 222a through 222( are then transmitted from Nr antennas 224a through 224t, respectively.<br>
[0036]	At receiver system 250, the transmitted modulated signals are received by NR<br>
antennas 252a through 252r and the received signal from each antenna 252 is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 254a through 254r. Each receiver 254 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0037]	An RX data processor 260 then receives and processes the NR received symbol<br>
streams from A'/? receivers 254 based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide NT "detected" symbol streams. The RX data processor 260 then demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 260 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 220 and TX data processor 214 at transmitter system 210.<br>
[0038]	A  processor  270  periodically determines  which  pre-coding  matrix  to  use,<br>
Processor 270 formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.<br>
[0039]	The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding<br>
the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor 238, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 236, modulated by a modulator 280, conditioned by transmitters 254a through 254r. and transmitted back to transmitter system 210,<br>
 <br>
06 I %5<br>

[0040]	At transmitter system 210. the modulated signals from receiver system 250 are<br>
received by antennas 224, conditioned by receivers 222, demodulated by a demodulator 240, and processed by a RX data processor 242 to extract the reserve link message transmitted by the receiver system 250. Processor 230 then determines which pre-coding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights then processes the extracted message.<br>
[0041]	FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary wireless communication system 300 configured<br>
to support a number of users, in which various disclosed embodiments and aspects may be implemented. As shown in FIG. 3, by way of example, system 300 provides communication for multiple cells 302, such as, for example, macro cells 302a-302g, with each cell being serviced by a corresponding access point (AP) 304 (such as APs 304a-304g). Each cell may be further divided into one or more sectors (e.g. to serve one or more frequencies). Various access terminals (ATs) 306, including ATs 306a-306k, also known interchangeably as user equipment (UE) or mobile stations, are dispersed throughout the system. Each AT 306 may communicate with one or more APs 304 on a forward link (FL) and/or a reverse link (RL) at a given moment, depending upon whether the AT is active and whether it is in soft handoff, for example. The wireless communication system 300 may provide service over a large geographic region, for example, macro cells 302a-302g may cover a few blocks in a neighborhood.<br>
[0042]	The cells  302 can  provide coverage  via  a plurality of networks,  such  as<br>
GSM/GPRS/Edge network (hereinafter referred to as "2G network"), and/or UMTS network (hereinafter referred to as "WCDMA coverage," "3G network," or simply as "3G"). The system 300 can have a first network in the cells, wherein the first network is the most readily available network, or can be considered the "fall back" technology having the greatest coverage area. In addition, the system 300 may have a second network that is available in a subset of the cells 302, and is not as readily available as the first network. For example, the second network may not be available in each ceil 302. and/or may not cover the entire area of the cells 302 in which it is available. Users leaving the second network arc provided coverage by the first network. For instance, the system 300 can include 2G and 3G networks, wherein the 2G network covers the entire system 300, and the 3G network is available in some locations throughout the system 300.<br>
 <br>
06 1965<br>
10<br>
[0043]	During an intersystem handover scenario, the ATs 306 handover from the first<br>
network to the second network, or vice versa. An intersystem handover scenario begins when the ATs 306 are connected to the first network; they read the system information on the cell 302 in which the AT 306 is currently located, and determine if the ATs 306 should start searching for the second network. If the cell 302 contains a neighboring cells list (hereinafter referred to as "NCELL list") for the second network (e.g. WCDMA NCELL list), then the ATs 306 search for the second network at a predetermined rate (e.g. every 30 seconds) until the second network is successfully identified. For instance, if the ATs 306 are connected to a first 2G network, and the second network is a 3G network, then the ATs 306 will search for the 3G network every 30 seconds until all the primary synchronization codes (PSC) specified in the WCDMA NCELL list are identified. Consequently, the AT 306c will consume superfluous battery power if it is outside of the second network's coverage area, because continuously searching reduces the sleep cycle for the AT 306c.<br>
[0044]	In accordance, with an aspect of the present invention the ATs 306 can control<br>
the rate at which they search for the second network (hereinafter referred to as "search rate") during an intersystem handover scenario. For instance, the ATs 306 can control the search rate by introducing one or more back-off schemes. The back-off schemes can include but are not limited to exponential back-off schemes, non-exponential back-off schemes, linear back-off schemes, non-linear back-off schemes, and so forth. Control of the search rate can be introduced based on any of a plurality of criteria, such as successive search failures, movement of the ATs 306, and/or signal strength (discussed infra). For instance, the AT 306d can begin an intersystem handover scenario, wherein the AT 306d is searching for the second network at the rate of once every X seconds. If a predetermined number of successive searches for the second network fail, and the AT 306d is not moving, then the AT 306d can introduce an exponential back-off scheme. The exponential back-off scheme can adjust the search rate such that the AT 306d searches for the second network every X"" seconds for the next Z attempts, where Y is a predetermined exponential back-off factor, and Z is a predetermined search interval. In other words, the AT 306d will search at an exponentially slower increment for the next set of attempts.<br>
[00451	Referring now to Fig. 4, an exemplary apparatus for implementing search rate<br>
control on an access terminal is shown.   The diagram 400 includes an access terminal<br>
 <br>
061965<br>
11<br>
402, having a connection component 404, a search component 406, and a power source<br>
408. As previously discussed, the access terminal 402 provides for communication via<br>
a wireless communication framework 410 (e.g, multiple access wireless communication<br>
system). The wireless communication framework 410 includes a wireless access point<br>
412 having a first network 414, and a second network 416. The access terminal 402 can<br>
communicate with the communication framework 410 by connecting to the networks<br>
414 or 416 carried on the access point 410. For simplicity of explanation, the<br>
communication framework 410 is shown as having a single access point 410, and the<br>
access point 410 is illustrated as having only two networks 414 and 416. However it is<br>
to be appreciated that the communication framework 410 can include a plurality of<br>
access points, and the access point 410 can include a plurality of networks.<br>
[0046]	The    connection    component    404    facilitates    communication     with     the<br>
communication framework 410. The connection component 404 includes a criteria component 418 that determines one or more criteria related to a connection and/or mobility of the access terminal 402 in relation to the communication framework. For instance, the criteria component 418 can determine movement of the access terminal 402, the signal strength of a network to which the access terminal 402 is presently connected, and so forth. Depending on the implementation, movement of the access terminal 402 can be determined by tracking the variance of the signal strength. Significant variance is variance above a predetermined threshold, and typically this threshold can be determined by a system designer, administrator, and so forth. Additionally or alternatively, the criteria component 418 can determine the access terminal is moving based on a plurality of criteria, including but not limited to the number of reselections made by the access terminal 402 over a predetermined time period, the number of new neighbors detected by the access terminal 402 over a predetermined time period, the variations in the receiver automatic gain control (Rx AGC) above a predetermined threshold of a serving cell, and/or the variations in the Rx AGC of neighbor cells above a predetermined threshold. For example, a system designer may determine that if the access terminal 402 effectuates 2 or more reselections, or detects more than 2 new neighbors over a period of time X, then the access terminal is moving, Similarly, a system designer can determine that variations in the Rx AGC, or Rx AGC of neighbor cells above a threshold Z indicate the access terminal is moving.<br>
 <br>
061965<br>
12<br>
[0047]	When the access terminal 402 is camped on the first network 434 in a cell (e.g.<br>
2G network), the search component 406 reads the system information to determine if the access terminal 402 needs to start searching for a second network (e.g. 3G network). An intersystem handover scenario is initiated when the search component 406 determines the access terminal 402 should begin searching for the second network 416, The search component 406 includes a search rate component 420 that determines the rate at which the search component 406 searches for the second network 416. For instance, if the cell contains a NCELL list for the second network (e.g. WCDMA NCELL list), then the search component 404 searches for the second network 416 at the rate defined in the search rate component 420 (e.g. X. or every 30 seconds). In addition, the search component 406 includes a control component 422 that can adjust the rate defined in the search rate component 420 based at least in part on one or more criteria determined by the criteria component 418. As previously discussed, each cell can be divided into one or more sectors, and can transmit the networks on one or more frequencies. Consequently, it is to be appreciated that a NCELL fist can contain a plurality of frequencies, and the access terminal 402 can implement search rate control for each frequency contained therein.<br>
[0048]	The criteria for determining the introduction of search rate control is largely<br>
based on a system administrator's preference, as well as the unique capabilities of the system in which the search rate control is to be implemented, For instance, in some systems certain criteria, such as signal strength, may be more reliable or valuable than other criteria. In addition, system administrators may desire achievement of various results, which require the use of different criteria. As with many wireless system modifications, implementation of search rate control for the access terminal 402 may require balancing various objectives. For instance, in a system containing a first and a second network, a back-off scheme can be implemented during an intersystem handover scenario to preserve the power source 408, which is balanced with the desire to operate the access terminal 404 on the most desirable network (e.g. most efficient, fastest, best coverage, etc.) as frequently as possible.<br>
[0049]	The control component 422 includes a back-off component 424 that provides<br>
one or more back-off schemes for use by the control component 422 in adjusting the rate defined in the search rate component 420. The back-off component 424 can implement the back-off schemes based on one or more criteria determined by the<br>
 <br>
061965<br>
13<br>
criteria component 416, and/or the successive number of failed searches maintained in a counter component 426. For instance, the back-off component 424 can implement a back-off scheme when the counter component 426 exceeds a predetermined number of failed successive searches (e.g. 5), and the criteria component 418 determines the access terminal 402 is not moving. The criteria used in the foregoing example may be selected, because they indicate that the access terminal 402 is on the edge of the second network 416. Moreover, the power consumed by the access terminal 402 from the power source 408 is proportional to the number and/or frequency of searches executed by the search component 406. Consequently, decreasing the total number of searches and/or frequency of searches executed by the search component 406 decreases the power consumed from the power source 408.<br>
[0050]	In view of the exemplary systems described supra, methodologies that may be<br>
implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flow chart of Fig. 5. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter.<br>
[00511	Fig. 5 illustrates a generalized methodology 500 that facilitates increasing access<br>
terminal battery life through search rate control. At 502, an access terminal is communicating with a first network in a cell. At 504, assuming that the access terminal has already begun an imersystem handover scenario (as previously discussed); the access terminal searches for a second network (e.g. 3G) every X seconds, where X is a the search rate.<br>
[0052]	At 506, the access terminal determines if one or more criteria for search rate<br>
control (SRC) are satisfied. For example, access terminal mobility can be one of the criteria, and if the access terminal is not moving (e.g. mobility) then the criteria for search rate control are satisfied. As discussed previously, the access terminal can determine its mobility based on a plurality of criteria including but not limited to whether the signal strength is varying significantly, the number of reselections over a predetermined   period   of  time,   the   number  of  new   neighbors   detected   over  a<br>
 <br>
061965<br>
14<br>
predetermined period of time, variation in Rx AGC above a certain threshold, variation in Rx AGC of neighbor cells above a certain threshold, and so forth.<br>
[0053]	At 508, if the criteria are satisfied (e.g. access terminal was not moving during<br>
the previous search interval) (YES at 504), then a search counter is incremented (e.g. by one). At 510, the search counter is compared to a predetermined threshold value. If the search counter does not exceed the predetermined threshold value (NO at 510), then (he access point will search again in X seconds. If the search counter Y exceeds (he predetermined threshold value (YES at 510), then the access terminal performs or implements search rale control at 512. Search rate control can include adjusting the search rate by employing a back-off scheme. In one example, the time between searches may be lengthened. In this case, the rate, as defined by the number of searches performed during a predefined time period, decreases. Since each search consumes battery life of the access terminal, as the number of searches decreases, battery life is conserved. For instance, the access terminal can implement a linear back-off scheme, wherein the access terminal will search for the second network every X*Y for the next Z attempts. Additionally or alternatively, an NCELL list can contain a plurality of frequencies, and the access terminal can implement search rate control (e.g. a back-off scheme) for each frequency contained therein.<br>
100541	Additionally or alternatively, it is to be appreciated that the method of search<br>
rate control illustrated in Fig. 5 can be applied to virtually any intcrsystcm handover scenario, and is not limited to the exemplary wireless communications systems discussed herein. For instance, the aforementioned method of search rate control can be applied to access terminals operating in a wireless local area network (WLAN), wherein the WLAN has two or more networks available.<br>
[0055]	FIG. 6 illustrates an approach 600 that employs an artificial intelligence (AI)<br>
component 602 which facilitates automating one or more features in accordance with the subject methods and apparatuses. The search control rate methods and apparatuses (e.g., in connection with inferring) can employ various Al-based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. For example, a process for determining criteria that can be used to trigger implementation of a back-off scheme can be facilitated via an automatic classifier system and process.<br>
[0056]	A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x = (x 1, x2, x3, x4,<br>
xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x) = confidence(class).<br>
 <br>
06 1965<br>
15<br>
Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action thai a user desires to be automatically performed. For instance, depending on the implementation a confidence can be assigned to the set of criteria, and an inference can be made as to the criteria that should be used as triggers for implementing search rate control.<br>
[0057]	A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be<br>
employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical lo training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naTve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.<br>
10058]	As  will  be  readily  appreciated  from  the  subject specification,  the subject<br>
invention can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic tiaining data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing user behavior, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVM's are configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria when to update or refine the previously inferred schema, tighten the criteria on the inferring algorithm based upon the kind of data being processed (e.g., primary versus secondary, static versus dynamic,,..), and at what time of day to implement tighter criteria controls (e.g., in the evening when system performance would be less impacted).<br>
[0059]	Referring now to FIG. 7, illustrated is a schematic block diagram of a portable<br>
hand-held terminal device 700, in which a processor 702 is responsible for controlling the general operation of the device 700. The processor 702 is programmed to control and operate the various components within the device 700 in order to carry out the various functions described herein. The processor 702 can be any of a plurality of suitable processors. The manner in which the processor 702 can be programmed to carry out the functions relating to the invention will be readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art based on the description provided herein.<br>

According to one aspect, the memory 704 has sufficient storage capacity to store multiple sets of information, and the processor 702 could include a program for alternating or cycling between various sets of display information.<br>

example, the display 706 can display a set of customer information, which is displayed<br>
to  the  operator  and  can   be  transmitted  over  a  system   backbone  (not  shown).	s<br>

[00621	Power is provided to the processor 702 and other components forming the<br>
hand-held device 700 by an onboard power system 710 (e.g., a battery pack), In the event that the power system 710 fails or becomes disconnected from the device 700, a supplemental power source 712 can be employed to provide power to the processor 702 and to charge the onboard power system 710. The processor 702 of the device 700 induces a sleep mode to reduce the current draw upon detection of an anticipated power failure.<br>
[0063]	The terminal 700 includes a communication subsystem 714 that includes a data<br>
communication port 716, which is employed to interface the processor 702 with a<br>
remote computer. The port 716 can include at least one of Universal Serial Bus (USB)<br>

The transceiver section 718 facilitates communication with a transponder system, for example, either passive or active, that is in use with product or item RF tags. The processor 702 signals (or pulses) the remote transponder system via the transceiver 718, and detects the return signal in order to read the contents of the tag memory.
