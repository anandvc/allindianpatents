				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a conditioning compositions that provides enhanced conditioning to the fibres including fabric and hair providing improved volume and fullness.The invention more particularly relates to shampoo compositions for enhanced conditioning of hair with additional benefits of improved volume and fullness.<br>
Background And Prior Art<br>
For a long time now shampoos are being widely used for cleansing purposes. One of the critical ingredients in any shampoo composition is a cleansing agent, which in most cases could be surfactants, detergents or foaming agents. The cleansing agent helps in cleaning the hair by removing excess soil and sebum from the hair and the scalp. In the process they also remove natural oils and positive charges from the hair, leaving the hair and scalp dry. It also produces static charge, causing flyaways. This often makes the hair rough, lusterless, frizzy and difficult to manage.<br>
In order to overcome this problem, conditioners were introduced. The positively charged surfactants in hair conditioners get attracted to the negative charges in the hair, and do not rinse out completely with water. When the hair dries, it is coated with a thin film, which adds weight, makes the hair easier to comb, and prevents deposition of static electricity and 'frizzing' of the hair. It also softens the hair, retains the moisture and thus improves the texture and manageability of the hair. US Patent no. 4719104 describes a conditioning preparation where cationic film forming polymers have been used in combination with distearyldimethylammonium salt.<br>
For many years, it was necessary to perform the act of cleaning and conditioning in two separate steps. However, with the advent of so-called "two-in-one" conditioning shampoos, it has become possible to condition and cleanse simultaneously. US Patent no. 6489286 describes a 'two in one' shampoo formulation where conditioners have been added to the shampoo composition thus giving both cleansing and conditioning benefits in the same product. US Patent no. 5573756 also describes a shampoo<br>
2<br><br>
conditioner composition, which includes a concentrated surfactant, a cationic conditioner, and a carrier.<br>
A variety of conditioning agents have been used in making conditioners. These include silicones, cationic polymers and oily materials such as hydrocarbons, higher alcohols, fatty acid esters, glycerides and fatty acids.<br>
Cationic polymers have been widely used as conditioning agents. Among them, polyquaterniums (cationic cellulose derivatives) are very effective conditioners and hence have been extensively used in conditioning preparations. US Patent no. 5,759,527 describes a conditioning preparation where polyquaternium 6 and polyquaternium 7 has been used for conditioning. Polyquaternium 10, a complex cationic polymeric conditioning agent derived from wood cellulose, has been widely documented in patents. It has been extensively used, since it improves wet and dry combing, detangling, and imparts sheen, adding a silky feel to the hair. It also adds fullness to the hair, giving it volume. Due to these reasons, polyquaternium 10 has been repeatedly used in conditioning preparations. US Patent no 4610874 and US Patent no 4,725,433 discloses a composition for a hair conditioning product comprising a cationic polymer. The cationic polymer being used in this case is Polyquaternium 10. US Patent no 6,294,159 also discloses a volumizing shampoo composition where PQ 10 has been extensively used.<br>
However, repeated use of conditioning composition containing polyquaternium 10 tends to cause deposition on the hair which causes difficulty in rinsing off, leading to an undesirably slimy or coated feel. The drawback of this conditioning agent is to develop build-up on hair with regular and repeated use. Additionaly makes the hair flat. Due to these reasons, in spite of the excellent properties of Polyquaternium 10 as a conditioner, the use of the same becomes undesirable.<br>
Therefore, the need of time is to overcome the undesirable property of polyquaternium 10 in order to utilize its conditioning properties to the fullest. Recognizing this need, the disclosed invention reveals a conditioning shampoo preparation where polyquaternium 10 has been used in combination with Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride. It improve the manageability of<br>
3<br><br>
hair without excessive build-up on the hair surface. It is known to control the excessive buildup of polymeric conditioning agent such as PQ10 on the hair surface. The use of Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride controls the excess deposition of PQ -10 thereby reducing the manageability of the hair.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,160,823; 4,436,722; 4,269,824 and 4,421,740 equate the mono-higher alkyl quaternary ammonium chloride with a di-higher alkyl quaternary ammonium chloride as the effective conditioning agent in their compositions.<br>
US 4,911,919 discloses a hair conditioner-straightener composition comprising the mixture of a di-higher alkyl quaternary ammonium compound, a C8 -C18 amido C2 -C3 alkyl di-C1 -C2 alkyl amine, a C14 -C18 alcohol, mineral oil, cyclomethicone, a hydroxy alkyl cellulose polymer, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and propylene glycol as the essential ingredients emulsified in an aqueous medium.<br>
US 5, 863,943 teaches a stabilized Oil in Water cationic emulsion comprising at least<br>
one Alpha Hydroxy Acids, which is stabilized by the incorporation of a high<br>
molecular weight PEG complexed with a cationic surfactant. Specifically, PEG's of<br>
approximately 100,000-4,000,000 molecular weight (weight average), when<br>
combined with a cationic surfactant of the R-amidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride<br>
Phosphate type lends the emulsion a high degree of stability, even under adverse<br>
conditions, and provides a suitable skin conditioning vehicle for the delivery of AHA,<br>
oatmeal,	and	other	active	agents.<br>
This art teaches the stabilizing effect of use of high molecular weight PEG and specific phosphate quaternary ammonium salts of the R-amidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride phosphate type. Use of related polymers, or related cationic surfactants, does not provide stability or aesthetic effects. The PEG and cationic surfactant apparently complex, in a method not clearly understood, to provide a stabilizing, aesthetically pleasing effect for the emulsion.<br>
US 6037305 relates to a textile softening and/or personal care compositions which comprise quaternary ammonium based softening agents which are high in diester and<br>
4<br><br>
low in triester content and to a process for the preparation of same. Quaternary ammonium compounds having particularly good performance and stability profiles are obtained by reaction of C12 -C22 fatty acids or the hydrogenation products thereof, or a mixture of such acids, with an alkanolamine in the presence of an acid catalyst, wherein the ratio of fatty acid to alkanolamine is from about 1.40-2.0. The resultant esteramine reaction products are subsequently quaternized to obtain the quaternary ammonium salts of the present invention. Additionally an alkyl amidopropyl amine quat was added in addition to some triethanol amine (small molecule) quat to enhance formulatability and dispersion stability (these comprising roughly 8% of the product).<br>
US 5567427 teaches emulsified, low pH cosmetic compositions having improved pH stability and phase stability are disclosed. The emulsified cosmetic compositions have a pH of about 3.7 to about 4.5, and contain about 10% to about 50% by weight of a dispersed oil phase, about 2% to about 20% by weight of an acid, like a hydroxycarboxylic acid, and about 0.5% to about 2% of a quaternized phosphate ester, like linoleamidopropyl PG-dimonium chloride phosphate. The use of such phosphate ester in the emulsified cosmetic compositions makes them phase stable over an extended storage period and maintain an essentially constant pH by exhibiting a pH drift of about 0.15, and usually 0.1, pH unit or less<br>
Thus amido propyl amine quat has been taught as softening agent, more specifically linoleamidopropyl PG-dimonium chloride phosphate has been taught as stabilizers for emulsifying compositions, mainly for skin formulations as lotions and cremes. Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride is phospholipid and known to improve hydration level of skin and hair surface. However there is no teaching as to the use of such phospholipids in formulation of conditioning compositions for the maintenance of volume after treatment with such conditioners<br>
All the above three ingredients are used in commercial products for their delivery of specific benefits as mentioned above. None of these have been in any combination demonstrably shows volume and bounce while imparting conditioning to hair<br>
5<br><br>
The present inventors have now found that to overcome the drawback of loss of volume and fullness due to use of known conditioning composition may be overcome by the use of a phospolipid in the composition. The most preferred phopholipid isLinoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate while other phopholipids may be used And believes that other This helps in retaining the moisture in the fabric/hair and surprisingly enhances volume, giving it a healthy look. Also, as opposed to most of the shampoo preparations, repeated use of this conditioning shampoo will not lead to the deposition or build up, which occurred when polyquaternium-10, was used alone. Surprisingly, the present inventors have found that the synergistic composition of above three ingredients provide significantly superior volumising benefit with higher degree of manageability (as mentioned in the provisional specification) imparting conditioning, than individual ingredients or combination of any two above ingredients. Thus this invention provides a fabric care and hair care composition, which renders conditioning and moisturizing properties to the fabric and hair, and gives the fabric fullness and volume and volume and bounce to hair.<br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
The present invention discloses a conditioning shampoo preparation that provides superior conditioning effect to hair and improves the manageability without causing excessive deposition on repeated use. The shampoo preparation essentially comprises of about 5% to about 50% by weight of surface cleansing agent, from about 0.05% to 2% by weight of hair conditioning polymer, such as a hydroxyethyl cellulose<br>
7<br><br>
derivative like polyquternium-10, from about 0.01% to 5% of a monomeric cationic molecule with ethoxylated derivative of dihydroxypropyl Linoleammonium chloride, such as Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride, from about 0.01% to 5% by weight of one or more phopholipids such as Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate water and optionally one or more additional material known for use in shampoo or conditioning composition.<br>
Surface cleansing agent<br>
The basic properties of a surfactant are,<br>
•	Easy removal of dirt by reducing the surface tension between water and the greasy<br>
matter on the hair.<br>
•	Production of foam. The foam holds the bits of dirt in it, and stops them from<br>
being re-deposited on the hair.<br>
•	Stabilization of the shampoo mixture and holding other ingredients in the solution.<br>
The composition according to the invention comprises a surfactant chosen from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic or amphoteric surfactants or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants include the alkyl sulphates, alkyl ether sulphates, alkaryl<br>
sulphonates, alkanoyl isethionates, alkyl succinates, alkyl sulphosuccinates, N-alkoyl<br>
sarcosinates, alkyl phosphates, alkyl ether phosphates, alkyl ether carboxylates, and<br>
alpha-olefin sulphonates, especially their sodium, magnesium ammonium and mono-,<br>
di- and triethanolamine salts. The alkyl and acyl groups generally contain from 8 to<br>
18 carbon atoms and may be unsaturated. The alkyl ether sulphates, alkyl ether<br>
phosphates and alkyl ether carboxylates may contain from one to 10 ethylene oxide or<br>
propylene oxide units per molecule, and preferably contain 2 to 3 ethylene oxide units<br>
per	molecule.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic surfactants include sodium oleyl succinate, ammonium lauryl sulphosuccinate, ammonium lauryl sulphate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, triethanolamine dodecylbenzene sulphonate, sodium cocoyl isethionate,<br>
8<br><br>
sodium Iauroyl isethionate and sodium N-lauryl sarcosinate. The most preferred anionic surfactants are sodium lauryl sulphate, triethanolamine lauryl sulphate, triethanolamine monolauryl phosphate, sodium lauryl ether sulphate 1EO, 2EO and 3EO, ammonium lauryl sulphate and ammonium lauryl ether sulphate 1EO, 2EO and 3EO.<br>
Nonionic surfactants suitable for use in compositions of the invention may include condensation products of aliphatic (C.sub.8 -C.sub.18) primary or secondary linear or branched chain alcohols or phenols with alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide and generally having from 6 to 30 ethylene oxide groups. Other suitable nonionics include mono- or di-alkyl alkanolamides. Example includes coco mono- or di- ethanolamide and coco mono-isopropanolamide.<br>
Amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants suitable for use in compositions of the invention may include alkyl amine oxides, alkyl betaines, alkyl amidopropyl betaines, alkyl sulphobetaines (sultaines), alkyl glycinates, alkyl carboxyglycinates, alkyl amphopropionates, alkylamphoglycinates alkyl amidopropyl hydroxysultaines, acyl taurates and acyl glutamates, wherein the alkyl and acyl groups have from 8 to 19 carbon atoms. Examples include lauryl amine oxide, cocodimethyl sulphopropyl betaine and preferably lauryl betaine, cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium cocamphopropionate.<br>
Generally, the surfactants are present in shampoo compositions of the invention in an amount of from 5 to 50%, preferably from 5 to 30%, more preferably from 10% to 25% by weight. Though all these types of surfactants can be used for this invention, anionic surfactants give the optimum results.<br>
Conditioning system<br>
The conditioning system that has been used in this composition includes three important conditioning agents, namely, hair conditioning polymer such as a hydroxyethyl cellulose derivative like Polyquaternium 10, a monomeric cationic molecule with ethoxylated derivative of dihydroxypropyl Linoleammonium chloride<br>
9<br><br>
such as Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride and phospholipd such as Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate. It has been seen that a syhergistic effect of these three conditioning agents give optimum conditioning, volume and moisturizing properties to the hair. It also helps in reducing the deposition that developed on repeated use of Polyquaternium 10 only.<br>
Hair conditioning polymer e.g Polyquaternium 10 hair conditioning polymer<br>
Polyquaternium 10 or PQ10 is a conditioning polymer based on hydroxethyl cellulose and cationic over the entire useful pH range. More correctly, it is a water soluble polymeric quaternary ammonium salt of hydroxethly cellulose reacted with a trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide. It is highly substantive and is suggested as a sensory modifier for cleansing systems. Following are the various benefits offered by PQ10 in hair and skin care compositions.<br>
•	It is compatible with all variety of anionic, amphoteric and non ionic surfactants.<br>
•	Being a viscosity modifier, it acts as a thickening agent<br>
•	It imparts smooth feel to hair an d skin<br>
•	It helps in manufacturing clear aqueous solutions and non tacky continuous films<br>
•	It improves wet and dry combability<br>
•	It improves gloss and has anti-static properties on hair<br>
PQ10 provides multifunctional properties to a shampoo composition. As it is compatible to a wide variety of surfactants and also renders excellent conditioning benefits, use of this ingredient is an ideal way of adding conditioning to a shampoo as well as thickening it. However, inspite of its various benefits along with its substantive nature, it tends to give a deposition on repeated use which makes the use of PQ10 in shampoo composition undesirable.<br>
Ethoxylated derivative of dihydroxypropyl Linoleammonium chloride e.g Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride<br>
10<br><br>
Use of polymeric conditioners like PQ 10 which renders optimum conditioning to the hair becomes undesirable as it causes deposition on repeated use. On the other hand, monomeric conditioners like Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride causes very low deposition on repeated use. Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride is a vegetable derived long alkyl chain cationic monomeric conditioning agent. Being highly substantive it provides lubricity and detangling to wet hair and effectively builds volume and sheen. It gives a soft smooth after feel and also renders volume to the hair. However, such monomeric conditioners are very mild and thus are not efficient conditioner as compared to polymeric conditioners like PQ 10.<br>
Phospholipid e.g Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate<br>
Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate is an organic phospholipid complex designed to be biomimetic. It is predominantly composed of diester phosphatides with multiple long chain groups that provide high substantivity and effective conditioning. Since it is derived from pure natural safflower oil containing a high level of linoleic acid, it acts as a topical source for a principal essential fatty acid that is needed to keep the skin healthy.<br>
The benefits of Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate are<br>
•	It facilitates topical delivery of linoleic acid.<br>
•	It acts as a non greasy emmolient<br>
•	It is a non occlusive moisturizer<br>
When Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate was used in this composition it was noticed that it helps in imparting excellent manageability of hair (conditioning and retaining moisture) while enhancing the body (volume) and bounce of hair.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the synergistic effect of PQ 10, Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride and Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate gives enhanced conditioning (manageability) properties to the hair and also<br>
11<br><br>
renders Enhanced volume to the hair making it look healthy and smooth. Most importantly this composition does not cause deposition even after repeated use.<br>
Example<br>
Given below are five different formulations made for assessing the efficiency of the shampoo composition disclosed in this invention. Formulation D is the same as the formulation of the disclosed invention. Formulation A contains all ingredients in formulation D except for Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride and Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate. Formulation B contains all ingredients in formulation D except Linoleamidopropyl PG - Dimonium Chloride Phosphate and Formulation C contains all ingredients in Formulation D except Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleaminium Chloride.

A. Sensory data<br>
These formulations were tested on the hair inorder to produce sensory data. Given below are the observations of the same.<br>
Attribute	Formula A	Formula B	Formula C	Formula D	Formula E<br>
Dry Hair Characteristics					<br>
Ease of detangling	Difficult	Easy	Moderately difficult	Easy	Moderately Difficult<br>

The methodology adopted for sensory evaluation is based on ASTM procedure<br>
E2082-00-Standard Guide for descriptive analysis of shampoo performance (Sections<br>
9.3, 9.4 and 9.5.)<br>
From the sensory data given above it is evident that formulation D gives the best<br>
results with respect to detangling, combability, slipperiness, volume and overall<br>
manageability.<br>
13<br><br>
Further to the sensory tests, in vitro tests were conducted to evaluate the role of formulation D in rendering volume and conditioning (over all manageability) to the hair as these are the key elements of benefit from this invention<br>
Given below are the observations of the same.<br>
B. In vitro measurement of Body (Volume) and Bounce:<br>
In order to measure the body (volume) and bounce of the hair on use of formula D, in vitro evaluation using hair tresses (treated with formula D) and control (untreated) was conducted.<br>
Evaluation Procedure:<br>
Five 20g bundle tresses were set into conical shape. Before measurements the hair tresses were combed gently to remove tangles. Volume measurements were then taken for the control tresses, with a minimum of three runs for each tress. For the product application, shampoo was applied in the root to tip direction in the amount of 0.5ml/g of hair. The tresses were washed with shampoo for 1 min and rinsed for 1 min with water at<br>
37° C. Tresses were combed and left for conditioning overnight at 21°C and 65% RH. Volume measurements were again taken for the treated tresses. Indian hair was used in this work. Body (volume) and bounce was measured using a ring compression method. For each of the five tresses before treatment (control), the reduction in volume and the compression energies (from pass 1 to pass 2 through the ring) are calculated using the formula:<br>
% reduction (body or bounce) = [(Pass 1 value - Pass 2 value)/Pass 1 value]* 100<br>
For body, these are the volume readings and for bounce it will be the compression energies. These per cent changes are then averaged over the five tresses for both the control and later for the treated tresses.<br>
14<br><br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a graph which shows the per cent reduction in volume [body] and compression energy [bounce] for the tresses both untreated and treated with the invention disclosed formulation i.e. formulation D).<br>
Treatment showed 24% enhancement in body and a 36% increase in bounce (which is measured as a decrease in absolute values for volume and compression force respectively) of the treated tresses compared to the control. In this methodology lower the absolute values mean better the volume and bounce imparted to hair.<br>
C. Measurement of Conditioning Efficiency by Shampoos<br>
Cationic deposition on hair fibers can be studied with the help of anionic dye binding studies. Cationic polymers, bind to the negatively charged hair fiber. By using anionic dyes, such as Rubine Dye, the deposition of cationic polymers can be detected visually. Traditionally such anionic dyes are used to demonstrate the deposition of cationic deposition and to study the deposition effectiveness of different shampoo formulations. For studying the deposition of cationic dyes delivered through shampoo formulations, wool swatches are routinely used. Since Wool shares several similarity to Human Hair and also since the charge of the wool fibers are similar to that of hair and because of the homogeneity obtainable in terms of the shade of wool, wool is a preferred substrate for such studies.<br>
Samples<br>
•	Control - Untreated Wool fiber swatches.<br>
•	Cleansing shampoo Solution.<br>
•	Formulation D<br>
Anionic Dye Staining Materials:<br>
•	Wool tresses prepared from white wool (KDR woolen Industries, Delhi)<br>
•	14% SLES solution for washing<br>
15<br><br>
•	Direct Red80 Dye solution<br>
•	1%ALS solution<br>
Sample preparation and Treatment:<br>
Twined wool samples were approximately cut to the length of 16cms and their component fibers were separated. These fibers were used to make swatches that approximately weighed lg. The fibers samples were then labeled.<br>
3.5gms of Direct Red80 dye (Fluka) is measured and 8.75gms Glacial acetic acid is slowly and uniformly mixed with the dye. The volume of this solution is made up to 350ml by adding distilled water.<br>
Direct Red 80 dye is an anionic dye which will readily react with cationic polymers. When light blonde hair or wool is treated with a cationic conditioner and rinsed, the hair or wool turns reddish pink when dipped into a dilute solution of Direct Red80 dye. The control remains undyed.<br>
Before the treatment of wool swatches with different formulations, the swatches are washed using SLES (14%) once. For each wool tress," 0.5g of SLES is used. Following this the wool swatches are dried. After completion of the SLES washing and drying, the swatches of wool were treated with 0.3 g of the formulations mentioned above. One set of swatches was kept as controls. Three treatments were given to each sample.<br>
After the above treatment, all the tresses were stained with Direct Red80 dye solution for 1 minute by immersing them into the dye solution. The swatches were subsequently rinsed with water to remove excess stain and washed one time using a fixed quantity of 1% ALS solution for 1 minute to remove the unbound dye. After this the swatches were rinsed with water and dried.<br>
The swatches were then tightly stretched and fixed between two clean glass slides and the Hunter L, a, b values were taken using an Electrophotometer. For each swatch the<br>
16<br><br>
color measurements were taken at least at 10 different locations to ensure accuracy and calculate statistical confidence. From the recorded Lab values, the Delta E (total color change) was calculated for all the swatches with respect to the control using the formula where 'L' stands for lightness, 'a' for redness and 'b'<br>
for blueness.<br>
Calculations<br>
The content of cationic conditioner deposition on hairs were calculated by the formula<br>
Where <br>
Delta E, the total color change, was calculated for all the swatches with respect to the<br>
control sample.<br>
'L' stands for lightness,<br>
'a' for redness and<br>
'b' for blueness.<br>
Express the result to two decimal places, Measurements were done in duplicate.<br>
