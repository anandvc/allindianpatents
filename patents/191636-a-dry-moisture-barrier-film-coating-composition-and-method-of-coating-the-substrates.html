				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a dry moisture barrier film coating composition, particularly it relates to a dry moisture barrier film coating composition for forming a moisture barrier film coating for pharmaceutical tablets and the like. It is specifically concerned with coating such substrates with a coating that acts as a moisture barrier.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for coating the substrates.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Many medicinal substances and the dosage forms into which they are made undergo degradation during storage due to contact with moisture which has been absorbed from the atmosphere. To combat this degradation, it is frequently necessary for such moisture sensitive dosage forms to be packed in special containers to limit the exposure of the dosage forms to the atmosphere.<br>
In  territories  where  the  climate  is  very  humid, specialized  packaging  does  not  provide  a  totally satisfactory  answer  to  moisture  degradation. Elimination  of  the  need  for  the  special packaging,   or  augmentation  of  the  moisture protection  provided  by  such  packaging,  may  be achieved  in  the  case  of  solid  dosage  forms,   such  as tablets,  capsules  and  granules,  by  coating  with materials  which  reduce  the  rate  at  which  the  dosage form  absorbs  atmospheric  moisture.     Moisture  barrier coatings  of  this  type  have  been  employed  previously. The  traditional  means  of  providing  the  moisture barrier  characteristics  required  for  moisture barrier  coatings, has  been  by  the  use  of  polymers which  are  soluble  in  organic  solvents  or  are relatively  insoluble  in  water.       The  disadvantages of  this  approach  are  1)     the  need  to  use  either organic  solvents  or  difficult  aqueous  polymer dispersion  techniques  to  apply  these  water-insoluble polymer  materials,   and  2)     the  reduced  aqueous solubility  of  the  coating  leading  to  prolonged disintegration  time  of  the  dosage  form  in  the  body when  ingested,   with  consequent  delayed  or  reduced activity  of  the  medicinal  substance  in  the  tablet.<br>
The  use  of  the  polymer  polyvinyl  alcohol,   PVA, as  a  moisture  barrier  coating  has  been  previously suggested.     However,   practical  usage  has  been inhibited  by  the  stickiness  of  grades  of  the  polymer which  have  a  fast  enough  rate  of  going  into  solution in  water  to  make  a  dispersion  to  render  them economical  to  use  in  making  the  coating.     A  further problem  with  the  use  of  PVA  is  in  identifying  or selecting  a  plasticizer  which  does  not  compromise the  moisture  barrier  properties  of  the  final coating.<br>
SUMMARY  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
A  dry  powder  moisture  barrier  coating composition  is  made  to  form  a  moisture  barrier  film coating  for  pharmaceutical  tablets  and  the  like, which  comprises  polyvinyl  alcohol  in  combination with  soya  lecithin,   together  with,  none,   one  or  more of  the  following  components  which  enhances  the desirable  coating  characteristics  of  the  resulting film  coating:     a  flow  aid,   a  colorant,   and  a suspending  agent.<br>
A  method  of  making  the  moisture  barrier  film coating  powder  composition  of  the  invention comprises  the  steps  of  mixing  polyvinyl  alcohol  with Soya   lecithin  and  optionally  with  one  or  more  of  thefollowing  components,  until  a  dry  homogenous  powder mixture  is  produced:   a  flow  aid,   a  colorant,   and  a suspending  agent,  preferably,  the  mixture  of polyvinyl  alcohol  and  soya  lecithin,  or  the  mixture of  polyvinyl  alcohol  and  soya  lecithin  and  any  of the  following  components,   if  any  of  the  following components  is  to  be  included  in  the  coating composition,   is  milled:  a  flow  aid,  a  colorant,  and a  suspending  agent.     The  resulting  dry  powder coating  composition  is  readily  soluble  or disperaible  in  cold  water  to  form  a  liquid  coating solution  or  dispersion  that  is  ready  to  use  within 4 5  minutes.<br>
Another  method  of  making  a  dry  edible  film coating  composition  of  the  invention  comprises producing  a  mixture  of  the  ingredients  processed into  a  granular  form  to  form  a  granular  coating composition  by  using  any  of  the  following  methods: wet  massing,   fluid  bed  granulation,   spray granulation  and  dry  compaction,   roller  compaction  or plugging.<br>
The  invention  also  includes  a  liquid  coating solution  or  dispersion  for  forming  a  moisture barrier  film  coating  which  comprises  polyvinyl alcohol,   soya  lecithin,   an  optional   flow  aid,   an optional  colorant,   and  an  optional  suspending  agent<br><br>
mixed  into  water.<br>
The  method  of  making  the  liquid  coating  dispersion of  the  invention  comprises  dispersing  the  dry  powder coatjLng  composition,  the  granular  coating  composition,  or the  individual  ingredients  of  the  coating  composition separately,   into  hot  or  cold  water,   and/or  milling  and/or stirring  until  a  homogenous  mixture  of  a  desired  correct viscosity  is  produced.<br>
The  film  former  of  the  coating  is  the  polyvinyl alcohol,  which  may  be  GOHSENOL  polyvinyl  alcohol  made  by NIPPON  GOHSEI,   for  example.<br>
Excellent  moisture  barrier  properties  are  obtained wher   hot  water  soluble  grades  of  PVA  are  used  in  the inventive  coating,  bulp  use  of  such  grades  requires  that the  water  of  the  liquid  coating  dispersion  be  heated. The  coatings  of  the  invention  may  use  cold  water  soluble grades  of  PVA  to  provide  moisture  barrier  protection,  but they  provide  less  moisture  barrier  protection  than  that provided  by  the  inventive  coatings  that  use  hot  water soluble  grades  of  PVA.    A  preferred  grade  of  PVA  for  use in  the  inventive  coating  is  a  grade  in  the  medium  range (i,e,.   the  grades  of  PVA  between  the  grades  that  dissolve only  in  hot  water  and  the  grades  that  dissolve  very easily  in  cold  water)   of  PVA  because  the  step of  heating  the  water  of  the  liquid  coating dispersion  may  not  be  necessary,  while  still maintaining  excellent  moisture  barrier  properties  in the  inventive  coating.<br>
The  flow  aid  may  be  talc,   fumed  silica,   lactose or  starch.<br>
The  colorant  may  be  any  food  approved  colors, opacifiers,   or  dyes.     For  example,  these  may  be aluminum  lakes,   iron  oxides,   titanium  dioxide,   or natural  colors.<br>
The  soya  lecithin,  which  may  be  ALCOLEC  soya lecithin  made  by  American  Lecithin  Company,   for example,  acts  an  a  anti-tack  agent,   and surprisingly,   and  unexpectantly,   acts  as  a plasticizer  by  locking  moisture  in  the  coating  so the  coating  stays  flexible  and  not  brittle. Surprisingly  and  unexpectantly,  this  locked-in moisture  in  the  coating,  while  contributing  to plasticization,   does  not  compromise  the  moisture barrier  properties  of  the  overall  coating.<br>
The  suspending  agent  acts  as  a  viscosity modifier  stabilizing  the  coating  dispersion.     A preferred  suspending  agent  is  xanthan  gum.     Examples of  alternative  suitable  suspending  agents  include hydroxypropylmethlycellulose   (HPMC),   alginates, hydroxypropyl  cellulose   (Hpcj,   natural  gums,  and carboxymethylcellulose.<br>

DETAILED   DESCRIPTION<br>
We  now  turn  to  the  examples  of  the  invention, all   ingredients  being  by  weight.<br>
EXAMPLE   1<br>
455.2  grams  of  polyvinyl  alcohol,   200.0  grams of  talc,   320.0  grams  of  titanium  dioxide,   4.8  grams of  xanthan  gum,   and  20.0  grams  of  soya  lecithin  are loaded  into  a  dry  powder  mill,   such  as  a  PK  blender, and  vigorously  mixed  therein  for  25  minutes  or  until a  homogenous  mix  is  achieved,   resulting  in  one formulation  of  the  inventive  dry  powder  moisture barrier  film  coating  composition.<br>
480  grams  of  this  formulation  of  the  inventive dry  powder  moisture  barrier  film  coating  composition is  dispersed  in  1701.8  grams  of  purified  water  to form  an  aqueous  suspension  of  the  invention. Specifically,   1701.8  grams  of  purified  water  at ambient  temperature  is  loaded  into  a  vessel  having  a diameter  that  is  approximately  equal  to  the  depth  of the  final  suspension,     A  low  shear  mixer,   preferably having  a  mixing  head  that  has  a  diameter  that  is approximately  1/3  the  diameter  of  the  mixing  vessel, is  lowered  into  the  water  and  turned  on  to  create  a vortex  from  the  edge  of  the  vessel  down  to  just above  the  mixing  head  without  any  air  being  drawn into  the  water.  Then,  the  480.0  grams  of  the moisture  barrier  film  coating  powder  composition  is added  to  the  vortex  at  a  rate  where  there  is  no excessive  build  up  of  dry  powder.     The  speed  or (depth  of  the  mixing  head  is  adjusted  to  avoid  air being  drawn  into  the  suspension  so  as  to  avoid foaming.    The  suspension  is  stirred  for  45  minutes and  is  then  ready  for  spraying  onto  substrates  like pharmaceutical  tablets.<br>
In  this  Example  1,   10  Kg  of  tablets  are  coated with  the  coating  of  the  invention  so  as  to  obtain about  a  4.0%  weight  gain.     The  extra  80  grams  of  the dry  powder  moisture  barrier  film  coating  composition above  the  400  grams  of  the  dry  powder  moisture barrier  film  coating  composition  needed  to  obtain  a 4,0%  weight  gain  on  the  tablets  is  included  to  allow for  losses  of  coating  composition  during  the  coating procedure.     10  Kg  of  tablets  which  have  logos embossed  therein  are  loaded  into  a  Manesty  Model  10 Acceta-Cota  coater,   and  the  tablets  are  rotated  in the  coater  at  a  rotation  speed  of  12  rpm.     The tablets  are  sprayed  with  the  coating  suspension  of this  Example  1  while  the  tablets  are  being  rotated. Hot  air  at  60°C  is  used  to  evaporate  the  water  in sprayed  coating  suspension  and  to  maintain  the tablets  at  38°C.<br>
Upon  completion  of  the  coating  process,   the tablets; show  a  smooth  surface  with  excellent  logo definition.<br>
In  the  following  Examples  2  to  14,   one  Kg patches  of  coating  suspension  are  produced  by  mixing 220  grams  of  inventive  dry  powder  moisture  barrier coating  composition  into  780  grams  of  purified water.     These  coating  suspensions  are  then  sprayed onto  tablets.     The  procedures  set  out  in  Example  1 for  making  the  dry  powder  moisture  barrier  coating composition,   for  making  the  coating  suspension,   and tor  spraying  the  coating  suspension  onto  tablets  are Used  in  Examples  2  to  14.     The  coated  tablets  of  theExamples  2  to  14  show  a  smooth  surface  with excellent  logo  definition.<br>

1500.00 the  coating  dispersion  of  this  Example  15  is  made and  used  using  the  procedures  set  out  in  Example  1.<br>
It  was  unexpectedly  found  that  soya  lecithin, included  for  its  tack  reduction  properties,   acts  as a  plasticizer  by  locking  moisture  in  the  coating  so as  to  keep  the  coating  flexible  and  not  brittle.     It<br>
is  also  considered  unexpected  that  this  moisture while  contributing  to  plasticization,  does  not compromise  the  moisture  barrier  properties  of  the overall  coating.<br>
This  invention  provides  the means  of  preparing a  moisture  barrier  coating  for  application  to pharmaceutical  solid  dosage  forms  in  which  the coating  composition  material  is  presented  as  a  dry particle  powder  or  granular  powder  which  is  readily dispersible  in  cold  water.     The  resultant  coating solution  or  dispersion  is  ready  to  use  by  applying it  to  tablets  within  45  minutes.    The  coating solution  or  dispersion  may  also  be  presented  in  the form  of  a  ready-to-use  liquid,   or  liquid  concentrate Which  is  diluted  prior  to  use.<br>
Compared  with  existing  moisture  barrier boatings  using  water  insoluble  polymers,  there  is negligible  effect  on  the  disintegration  time  of  the Coated  dosage  forms  coated  with  the  inventive coating.<br>
The  dry  form  of  the  invention  is  manufactured using  rotary  mixers  or  mills.    The  ingredients  are loaded  and  then  milled  until  a  homogenous  mix  is produced.     In  the  case  of  liquid  dispersions,   the ingredients  are  dispersed  into  hot  or  cold  water  and stirred  or  milled  until  a  homogenous  dispersion  or<br>
solution  of  the  desired  correct  viscosity  is produced.<br>
The  dry  form  of  the  invention,  which  comprises a  powder  of  PVA  and  soya  lecithin,   and  optionally  a flow  aid,   a  colorant,   and  a  suspending  agent,   is dispersed  in  water  and  stirred  until  the  PVA  is hydrated  and  a  homogenous  mixture  is  produced.  The liquid  solution  or  dispersion  formed,  which comprises  PVA,   soya  lecithin,  and  any  optional components  mixed  into  water,  may  be  ready-to-use  or require  simple  dilution  with  water  prior  to  use. the  resulting  coating  dispersion  is  sprayed  onto  the dosage  forms  using  airless  or  airborne  methods.    The movement  of  air  around  or  through  the  tablet  bed facilitates  drying  of  the  film  on  the  tablet surface.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
