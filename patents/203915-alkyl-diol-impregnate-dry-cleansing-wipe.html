COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
1.        TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
ALKYL DIOL IMPREGNATE DRY CLEANSING WIPE<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913, of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.	<br><br><br>
9-2-2004<br><br>
ALKYL DIOL IMPREGNATE DRY CLEANSING WIPE<br>
The invention concerns low-cost, easily manufacturable disposable single use, substantially dry, cleansing articles.<br>
Personal cleansing and conditioning products have traditionally been marketed in a variety of forms such as bar soaps, creams, lotions, and gels.  These formulations have attempted to satisfy a number of criteria to be acceptable to consumers.  These criteria include cleansing effectiveness, skin feel, skin mildness and lather volume. Ideal personal cleansers should gently cleanse the skin or hair, cause little or no irritation, and not leave the skin or hair overly dry after frequent use.<br>
A series of granted and pending patent applications have been published by Procter &amp; Gamble describing substantially dry, disposable, personal cleansing products which address many of the aforementioned functionality concerns.  These products are substantially dry articles having deposited onto a w-oven-or- non-woven? cloth a cleansing" composition* of â–  surfactant, structurant, skin conditioning agent and other performance ingredients.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,951,991 (Wagner et al.) focuses on providing the substrate with a conditioning emulsion separately impregnated from the lathering surfactant onto the cloth substrate.  U.S. Patent 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.!.emphasizes impregnation of oil soluble conditioning agents.  WO 93/55303 (Aibacarys et al.) describes skin care actives formulated with the cleansing composition.<br>
2<br><br>
Manufacturing processes for these products are reported in U.S. Patent 5,952,043 and U.S. Patent 5,-863,663, both to Mackey et al.  These patents teach use of a continuous lipid phase with a high melting waxy material deposited onto the wipe substrate.  The material is intended to be sufficiently brittle so as to be easily disrupted by low shear contact (e.g. during wiping of the skin) to readily release an internal skin conditioning phase, yet the material is required to be sufficiently tough to avoid premature release of the internal phase during the rigors of processing.<br>
A problem with this technology is that through compromise the continuous external lipid phase/internal polar phase is neither sufficiently robust for processing and handling nor sufficiently releasable under wash conditions to allow efficient release of conditioning agent onto the skin.  A better wipe impregnation and skin conditioning system has been sought.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to be able to, p.r.a.v,ide a. disposable,, substantially dry cleansing product featuring lathering surfactants deposited with an improved impregnation system onto a wiping article.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to be able to provide a disposable, substantially dry cleansing product having a cleansing composition coating on a flexible wiping cloth wherein the composition adheres without either brittleness or tackiness onto the cloth.<br>
-3<br><br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to be able to provide a disposable, substantially dry cleansing product which includes an impregnation system allowing for improved manufacturability, better aesthetics and increased latherability.<br>
These and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following summary and disclosure.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a substantially dry cleansing product which includes:<br>
(i)   a water insoluble substrate;<br>
(ii)  a lathering surfactant; and<br>
(iii) a C5-C12 alkyl diol, the diol and total<br>
lathering surfactant being present in a weight ratio from about 1:1 to about 1:8.<br>
Advantageously very small amounts of water may be present in the impregnated composition.  Preferably the combined weight of alkyl diol and water to lathering surfactant may be in a weight ratio from about 3:1 to about 1:5.<br>
Now it has been discovered that C5-C12 alkyl diois can be<br>
used to impregnate lathering surfactants onto a wiping article.  Improved latherability can  be obtained while minimizing the problem of stickiness.  Additionally, process advantages are obtained because water used as a traditional carrier for impregnation can be minimized.  Phase stability<br>
4<br><br>
of the coating solution is enhanced by the use of the diol. It has further been found that the improved properties are achieved through control of the weight ratio between the diol and lathering surfactant.  Weight ratios of diol to total lathering surfactant should range from about 1:1 to about 1:8, preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:6, optimally from about 1:2.5 to about 1:4.<br>
Advantageously small amounts of water may be present in the impregnated compositions.  These amounts should not exceed 20% but may range  from about  1   to about  15% by weight.   Diols and water relative to total surfactant may be present in a weight ratio from about 3:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:2, optimally about 1:1.  With weight ratios lower than 1:5, the product may be difficult to coat without adding water to reduce viscosity, but thereby forcing a costly drying step.  Moreover, these lower ratios are likely to be pasty resulting in an aesthetically displeasing to the touch wiping article.  Much higher weight ratios such as those above 4:1 will not feel dry and will lather poorly-<br>
Diols used according to the present invention have from 5 to 12 carbon atoms.  They preferably are alkyl diols such as hexylene glycol, octylene glycol, decylene diol and dodecylene diol as   well as combinations thereof.  Most preferred is hexylene glycol.  Amounts of the diol may range from about 2% to about 40%, preferably from about 10% to about 20%, optimally from about 12% to about 16% by weight of the impregnated composition.<br>
5<br><br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to be able to provide a disposable, substantially dry cleansing product which includes an impregnation system allowing for improved manufacturability, better aesthetics and increased latherability.<br>
These and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following summary and disclosure.<br>

of the coating solution is enhanced by the use of the diol. It has further been found that the improved properties are achieved through control of the weight ratio between the diol and lathering surfactant.  Weight ratios of diol to total lathering surfactant should range from about 1:1 to about 1:8, preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:6, optimally from about 1:2.5 to about 1:4.<br>

Moreover, these lower ratios â– are likely to be pasty resulting in an aesthetically displeasing to the touch wiping article.  Much higher weight ratios such as those above 4:1 will not feel dry and will lather poorly..<br>
Diols used according to the present invention have from 5 to 12 carbon atoms.

Amounts of the diol may range from about 2% to about 40%, preferably from about 10% to abou. 20%, optimally from about 12% to about 16% by weight of the impregnated composition.<br>
7<br><br>
A second essential element of compositions according to the present invention is that of a lathering surfactant.  By a "lathering surfactant" is meant a surfactant, which when combined with water and mechanically agitated generates a foam or lather.  Preferably, these lathering surfactants should be mild, which means that they must provide sufficient cleansing or detersive benefits but not overly dry the skin or hair, and yet meet the lathering criteria described above.<br>
The products of the present invention typically comprise a lathering surfactant in an amount from about 0.5% to about 40%, preferably from about 0.75% to about 20%, and more preferably from about 1% to about 10%, based on the weight of the impregnated composition.<br>

The water insoluble substrates of the present invention can comprise two or more layers, each having a different texture and abrasiveness.  The differing textures can result from ;the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate layers of the substrate lean be manufactured to have different colors, thereby [helping the use to further distinguish the surfaces.<br>

The disposable, single use personal care cleansing products of the present invention are manufactured by separately or simultaneously adding onto or impregnating into a water insoluble substrate a lathering surfactant and alkyl diol, wherein the resulting product is substantially dry.  By "separately" is meant that the surfactants and alkyl diol<br>
18<br><br>
can be added sequentially, in any order without first being combined together.  Py "simultaneously" is meant that the surfactants and alky.l diol can be added at the same time, with or without first being combined together.<br>
The surfactant, alky! diol and any optional ingredients can be added onto or impregnated into the water insoluble substrate by any meatfs known to those skilled in the art. For example, addition can be through spraying, laser printing, splashing, dipping, soaking, or coating.<br>
When water or moisture is used or present in the manufacturing process, the resulting treated substrate is then dried so that it is substantially free of water.  The treated substrate can be dried by any means known to those skilled in the art.  Non-limiting examples of known drying means include the use of convection ovens, radiant heat sources, microwave ovens, forced air ovens, and heated rollers or cams.  Drying also includes air drying without the addition of heat energy, other than that present in the ambient environment-.. Also, a. combination, af. various, dnying methods can be used.<br>
Except in the operatif-g and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>

These formulations were prepared in the following manner. Glycol, glycerin, sorbitol or laureth-4, as appropriate, were charged to a mixing vessel.  Moderate to vigorous agitation was applied.  Thereafter the Merquat 2200Â® was folded into the batch with mixing until well dispersed.<br>
Tegobetaine CKDÂ® was then charged with moderate/vigorous<br>
agitation until all clumps of this material disappeared. Decylpolyglucoside was added under continuous agitation. Heat was applied to the batch to achieve 80Â°C.  Then<br>
Hamposyl L-95Â®, Pationic 138CÂ® and Miglyol 812Â® were<br>
sequentially added.  Temperatures were lowered to 60Â°C<br>
allowing addition of Silquat ADÂ®.  Upon cooling to 45Â°C,<br>
fragrance and Glydant PlusÂ® Liquid were charged to the batch.<br>

Evident from Table II was tha only the hexylene glycol was able LO provide a free flowing liquid which could evenly be distributed onto a substrate cloth.  Propylene glycol and<br>
22<br><br>
butylene glycol resulted in thick pastes which could not easily be utilized in the substrate coating process. Samples D, E and G respectively containing glycerin, sorbitol and laureth-4 could not even be formulated into a spreadable composition.  Sample F utilizing methyl propane diol as a structuring aid was too thick for the substrate coating process.  It was surprising to find that lower molecular weight glycols such as butylene glycol or propylene glycol were much poorer structuring agents than hexylene glycol.  Likewise, higher, molecular weight materials such as laureth-4 and sorbitol were poor structuring candidates.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A set of comparative experiments were conducted similar to those reported under Example 1, except utilizing an alternate surfactant system of sodium cocoylisethionate and<br>
j cocamidopropyl betaine.  The formulations are outlined under<br>

Table IV reports results similar to those found in Example 1.  Hexylene glycol was found to be an acceptable structurant.  Glycerin and butylene glycol caused unacceptable thickening of the formulations allowing them not to be easily applied to a substrate cloth.<br>

Samples A-C were prepared in a manner similar to that described for Example 1.  These formulations were coated onto a 15.2cm by 20.3cm (six inch by eight inch) rayon/polyester non-woven cloth followed by removal of water in an oven.  As reported in Table VI, Sample A was too viscous for the formula even to be completed.  In this sample the relative weight ratio of hexylene glycol to surfactant was 1:10.  Sample B required a coating of 1.63 grams to achieve 0.44 grams surfactant onto the non-woven cloth.  This amount of coating resulted in a wet to the touch feel even after drying in the oven.  Lather was also somewhat weaker than from the Sample C towelette.  The weight ratio of hexylene glycol to surfactant in Sample B was 2:1.<br>
Sample C required 0.9 grams to place 0.44 grams of surfactant onto the non-woven cloth.  The processed cloth<br>
had a dry to the touch feel and lather somewhat stronger than the towelette coated with Sample B.  The weight ratio of hexylene glycol to total lathering surfactant in Sample C was 1:3.<br>
