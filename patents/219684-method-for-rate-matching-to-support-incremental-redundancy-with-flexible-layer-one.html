METHOD FOR RATE MATCHING TO SUPPORT INCREMENTAL REDUNDANCY WITH<br>
FLEXIBLE LAYER ONE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to wireless communication, and more particularly to rate matching of transport channels to physical channels in a wireless communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A Flexible Layer One (FLO) protocol layer, based on the same specifications for a FLO protocol layer provided for UTRAN (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network), is currently being developed for GERAN (GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)/ EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) Radio Access Network). For signalling at least, FLO must support data transfer in acknowledged RLC (Radio Link Control) mode. Incremental redundancy, as used in selective type II hybrid ARQ, available in EGPRS (Enhanced General Packet Radio Service), is a powerful means by which to enhance link level and system level performance of data transfer in acknowledged RLC mode. In incremental redundancy, upon reception failure, the retransmission of a data block is not identical with its initial transmission, but instead a different puncturing pattern is used (i.e. some bits of a block already encoded for forward error correction are either punctured so as not to be transmitted or are repeated, thus providing the number of bits required for the transmission time interval in which the block will be transmitted, i.e. thus providing a rate-matched encoded block), and when the original transmission and retransmission(s) are combined, the result is increased redundancy and a greater likelihood of forward error correction by the receiver. The existing rate matching algorithm for FLO does not allow incremental<br><br>
redundancy to be used. For the Same encoded data block, the rate matching algorithm always produces the same puncturing pattern.<br>
Thus, the prior art does not teach providing incremental redundancy (selective type II hybrid ARQ) for FLO, either as it will be implemented in GERAN or as it is implemented in UTRAN; to provide incremental redundancy requires rate matching of the transport channel to the physical channel, and what is needed is, ideally, a simple and efficient way of providing such rate matching so as to provide incremental redundancy with FLO, either in UTRAN or GERAN.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for rate matching in equipment used in connection with a radio access network, the method using a rate-matching algorithm based on determining a starting parameter eini, the method characterized by: a step of determining a characteristic distance D   for an encoded block equal to the average distance between punctured bits for the encoded block when the average distance between punctured bits is greater than two, or equal to the average distance between transmitted bits when the average distance between punctured bits for the encoded block is less than two, or equal to two otherwise; and a step of determining a new value of the starting parameter e^i based on a cycling term having a value depending on a retransmission parameter R , the retransmission parameter R   having a predetermined initial value for an original transmission and having different values for at least some subsequent retransmissions, the cycling term also depending on the characteristic distance D   so as to never have a value exceeding a predetermined maximum value; thereby providing retransmission with incremental redundancy.<br><br>
In accord with the first aspect of the invention, the predetermined maximum value may be one less than the characteristic distance D .<br>
In accord with the first aspect of the invention, the radio access network may implement Flexible Layer One (FLO).<br>
Also in accord with the first aspect of the invention, the rate matching may include either repeating bits of an encoded block of a transport channel or puncturing bits of an encoded block of a transport channel so as to provide over the transport channel a rate-matched encoded block having a number of bits sufficient to ensure a predetermined total channel bit rate for a transmission time interval after multiplexing with all other transport channels to be transmitted by a same physical channel.<br>
Also in accord with the first aspect of the invention, the radio access network may be a GSM (Global System for Mobile communications)/ EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) Radio Access Network (GERAN).<br>
Also in accord with the first aspect of the invention, the radio access network may be a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN).<br>
Still also in accord with the first aspect of the invention, the retransmission parameter R   may be zero for the original transmission.<br>
Still also in- accord with the first aspect of the invention, the value of the retransmission parameter R   for the original*transmission may be incremented by one for each successive retransmission. Further, the cycling term may be computed according to the expression R  mod D .<br><br><br><br><br><br>
network is provided, characterized in that it comprises means for performing the steps of the method provided by the first aspect of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, a system is provided, comprising a transmitter of a radio access network and also a transmitter of a wireless terminal for communicating with the radio access network, the transmitters characterized in that each comprises means for performing the steps of the method provided by the first aspect of the invention.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Background on   the Existing Rate Matching Algorithm for FLO in GERAN<br>
The invention will now be described in an application to a GERAN (GSM/ EDGE Radio Access Network) implementing FLO, i.e. a GERAN as set out in 3GPP TR 45.902 (Release 6), GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network;  Flexible Layer One;   (Release 6).    (See also GP-022194, Draft Technical Report on FLO; Ericsson, Nokia and Siemens; TSG GERAN #11; Los Angeles, CA,<br><br>
USA; 26 - 30 August 2002.) (An overview of GERAN is available in 3GPP TS 43.051, although not mentioning FLO.) It should be understood however that the invention is also of use in other radio access networks, including e.g. some implementations, of UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network).<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, a portion of a digital transmission system of the type for which the present invention could be used is shown as including: a channel encoding module 11 (one transport block per transport channel entering the encoding module) for providing an encoded block of bits (one encoded block per transport block) including redundancy to allow for error correction at the receiver (via the coded bits of the encoded block); a rate matching module 12 for providing what is called a radio frame, i.e. a rate-matched encoded block, the rate matching including either repeating bits of an encoded block of a transport channel or puncturing bits of an encoded block of a transport channel so as to provide over the transport channel a rate-matched encoded block having a number of bits sufficient to ensure a predetermined total channel bit rate for a transmission time interval after multiplexing with all other transport channels to be transmitted by a same physical channel; a transport channel multiplexing module 14 for multiplexing the radio frames (rate-matched encoded blocks) from each transport channel so as to provide a multiplexed bit stream for a coded composite transport channel; and a physical channel mapping module for providing elements of the multiplexed bit stream to a physical channel.  (As mentioned, the encoded block is encoded to enable forward error correction by including sufficient redundancy that if some bits of the encoded block are not properly received, the receiver is nevertheless able to properly decode the encoded block. In general, as long as not too many consecutive bits are distorted in transmission, the encoded block can be properly decoded. Thus, in rate<br><br>
matching, as long as not too many consecutive bits are punctured, the rate-matched encoded block can be decoded.)<br>
As mentioned, the rate matching module 12 provides a rate-matched encoded block starting with the (forward error correction) encoded block. In the rate matching, bits of the encoded block (on a transport channel) are repeated or punctured to provide a desired number of bits (a number that will provide rate-matching to the physical channel) for transmission during a TTI. The number of bits that are punctured or repeated to achieve the desired number can vary from TTI to TTI because the bandwidth can change if the number of transport channels that are active changes or the number of bits in the encoded blocks of other transport channels changes, or both. As mentioned, bits are repeated or punctured to ensure that the total bit rate after TrCH (transport channel) multiplexing is equal to the total channel bit rate of the allocated basic physical channel.<br>
When only one transport channel is active at a time, the coding rate (the number of data bits compared to the total number of coded bits), and so also the number of bits in the encoded block, depend only on the transport block size and on the available channel bandwidth (the bit rate capacity of the physical channel)- But when more than one transport channel is active (e.g. for transport of different component streams of a multimedia data stream), the coding rate also depends on the rate matching attribute for each transport channel defined by the radio resource control protocol layer, an upper layer relative to the transport layer, each rate matching attribute serving as a weighting of the bits for the respective transport channel relative to the bits of the other transport channels.  By setting different rate matching attributes for the different transport channels, the radio resource control protocol layer adjusts the coding rate of the different transport channels.<br><br>
As  already indicated,   outputs  from the  rate matching are<br>
called radio frames   (i.e.   rate-matched encoded blocks).   For<br>
each encoded block,   rate matching produces  one  radio  frame,<br>
i.e.   one  radio  frame  is produced per TrCH. « The rate matching algorithm for GERAN  is based on the<br>
UTRAN rate matching algorithm,   but with a  few simplifications<br>
since there  is no  spreading factor,   nor  compressed mode,   nor<br>
special  cases  such as  turbo codes,   and therefore many<br>
parameters  of  the UTRAN algorithm can be  fixed either to  0  or<br>
1  in the GERAN case.<br>
The algorithm presented below uses  the  following notation:<br>
[xj       Round x towards   -co,   i.e.   the  integer  such that   JC — 1 <l jc .></l>
|x|	Absolute value  of x.<br>

channel,   i.e.   the data  stream resulting  from encoding and multiplexing of  the possibly several  active  transport channels).<br>
Ndata    T°tal  number of bits  that  are  available  in a  radio block  for<br>
the  CCTrCH.    (For every radio block to be  transmitted,   one radio  frame,   i.e.   one  rate-matched encoded block,   from each active TrCH  is  delivered to the TrCH multiplexing.   These  radio frames are serially multiplexed into a CCTrCH.   The coded   . transport  format combination identifier TFCI and the CCTrCH are  interleaved together on radio blocks.)<br>

AN;j    If positive,   number of bits  that have  to be  repeated  in an<br>

If negative,   number of bits  that  have  to be punctured  in an encoded block on TrCH i  with  transport  format   combination j  in order to produce a radio  frame.<br>
If null,   no bits  have  to be punctured nor  repeated,   i.e.   the rate matching  is  transparent  and the  content  of  the  radio frame is  identical to the content of  the encoded block on TrCH i  with  transport  format  combination j.<br><br>

Adaptation   of    the   Existing   FLO   Rate   Matching   Algorithm    to Provide Incremental  Redundancy<br>
The invention modifies the existing FLO rate matching algorithm by redefining *the starting parameter eini for each retransmission, and so having the rate matching algorithm provide puncturing patterns for retransmissions that are different from that of the original transmission (but not necessarily different for each retransmission, since only a finite number of such different puncturing patterns can be provided, as explained below). The starting parameter is redefined based on two parameters, a retransmission parameter R, and a characteristic distance D,   and according to the invention, the retransmission parameter R is controlled by the<br><br>
RLC layer and its value for each TrCH is communicated to the physical layer, where the rate matching is done.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the retransmission parameter R   is assigned a value according to the rule: in unacknowledged and transparent RLC modes, R  has a fixed value of 0 (i.e. incremental redundancy is not used); but in acknowledged RLC mode, in case incremental redundancy is used, the value of R  is initially 0 and is incremented by 1 for each retransmission of the same data block. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the parameter R  can be seen as a counter of the number of retransmissions of the same data block. The physical layer then uses the retransmission parameter R   to generate different puncturing patterns, if possible, i.e. if not all different puncturing patterns have been transmitted. Given a string of bits (the encoded block) bl b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9, if every third bit is to be punctured so that for the original transmission, say, b3 and b6 andb9 are to be punctured, then there are only two possible additional puncturing patterns for retransmissions, a first one in which b2 and b5 and b8 are punctured, and a second one in which bl and b4 and b7 are punctured. After that, the puncturing pattern repeats. The same holds true of course for a pattern in which some bits are repeated instead of being punctured. (Either kind of pattern is here called a puncturing pattern.)<br>
The characteristic distance D   is used to take into account that the puncturing pattern must repeat after a finite number of retransmissions.  The characteristic<br>
distance D  provided by the invention is calculated from the parameters epius and emin-s set out above in the existing FLO<br>
rate matching algorithm. For the characteristic<br>
distance D   is given by:<br><br><br>
and is the average distance (in bits) between punctured bits<br>
e 1<br>
in  the  original   transmission,   whereas   for      p us 
minus<br>
given by:<br><br>
and is the average distance (in bits) between transmitted<br>
e lu bits in the original transmission. For  p us -2 ,   D-2    (bits)<br>
minus<br>
(which is the case when the average distance between punctured bits and the average distance between transmitted bits are both equal to two bits). In calculating the characteristic distance D   for an encoded block, the invention also comprehends calculating the average distance between transmitted or punctured bits using other expressions not amounting to simple arithmetic averages, such as weighted averages, with different bits weighted differently, depending on bit position.<br>
Table 1 below gives an example of an average distance between punctured bits of 3 (12/4=3) bits. In order to generate different puncturing patterns, the first pattern, i.e. the originally transmitted pattern (obtained with retransmission parameter R=0),   must be shifted forward (corresponding to R=l  and R=2) .<br><br><br>
Table 1. Example of average distance of 3 bits between punctured bits. The letter Y at a bit position indicates the bit at the position is punctured.<br>
Table 2 below gives an example of an average distance between'punctured bits of 1.5 (12/8 = 1.5) and an average distance between transmitted bits of 3 (12/4 = 3) . In order to generate different puncturing patterns, the original (or previous) transmission pattern must be shifted jbacJcward (again corresponding to R=l  and R=2).    (If the pattern is shifted forward instead of backward, one bit will be missing,-the shifted forward pattern would be YYY-YY-YY-YY and so would contain only three bits, not four.)<br>
Table 2. Example of average distance between punctured bits of 1.5 bits and an average distance between transmitted bits of 3 bits.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, when the average distance between punctured bits is greater than or equal to 2 bits, the different puncturing patterns are obtained by shifting forward the originally transmitted pattern (corresponding to R=0) .   When the average distance between punctured bits is smaller than 2 bits, the different puncturing patterns are obtained by shifting backward the originally (or previously) transmitted pattern.<br>
So to take into account that the puncturing pattern must repeat after a finite number of retransmissions, the characteristic distance D   is used to provide a value based on R    (which increments continually, with each retransmission) that does not ever exceed an appropriate maximum value, namely one less than the value of the characteristic distance D .   Specifically, the invention uses a cycling term, R   mod D<br><br>
(i.e. R modulus D) , to determine the starting parameter eini. (One might say that D is used to modulate R so as to produce a value from R in the range from 0 to D-±.) According to the invention, the starting parameter eini is given-by the rule:<br><br>
Note that D  tells how many different puncturing patterns are possible. For instance if 1 bit is punctured out of every 3 bits, the average distance between puncture bits is 3 and there are 3 different" possible puncturing patterns: one starting from bit 1, another one starting from bit 2 and the last one starting from bit 3 (forward shift). Similarly if 2 bits are punctured every 3, the average distance between transmitted bits is 3 and there are 3 different possible puncturing patterns.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, the invention is illustrated as beginning with a first step 21 in which, in case of a retransmission, the RLC protocol layer increments the retransmission parameter by one, and for an original transmission, sets the retransmission parameter to zero. In a next step 22, the physical layer, after receiving the value of the retransmission parameter R   from the RLC protocol layer, calculates the number ANi(j of bits to be repeated or punctured within the encoded block of an active transport<br><br><br><br>
Advantages<br>
An advantage of the invention is that the RLC layer need only manage (assign a value to) the retransmission parameter R . There is no need for upper layers to know how many different retransmissions are possible. As a result, the upper layers are relieved from having to store details specific to the physical layer. For instance, because of the flexibility allowed by FLO, some other transport channels can become active even when retransmissions are ongoing, and thus change D  and the management of R.   If upper layers had to be aware of these kind of details, implementations of the upper layers would be much more complex, possibly so much so that the flexibility aimed at with FLO would not be feasible. Without the cycling term ./? mod D ,   FLO could not accept other transport channels as long as retransmissions are being sent for a transport channel.<br>
The amount of possible different puncturing patterns may vary in time and depend on many factors specific to the physical layer, such as the coding rate, the size of the transport block, and the activity of other transport -channels. Thus the physical layer may not always be able to generate a different puncturing pattern for each value of R. When it happens that the physical layer cannot do so, according to the invention, the physical layer will simply loop (cycle) among the finite number of different possible puncturing patterns.<br>
