				<td>Novel thiourea derivatives and the pharmaceutical compositions containing the<br>
same<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel thiourea derivatives and the pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and particularly, to novel thiourea compounds as a modulator for vanilloid receptor (VR) and the pharmaceutical compositions thereof. Here, the modulator means the thing that can be bonded to the receptor to act as an antagonist or an agonist.<br>
Background Art<br>
As diseases associated with the activity of vanilloid receptor, pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, migraine, arthralgia, neuropathies, nerve injury, diabetic neuropathy, neurodegeneration, neurotic skin disorder, stroke, urinary bladder hypersensitiveness, irritable bowel syndrome, a respiratory disorder such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, irritation of skin, eye or mucous membrane, fervescence, stomach-duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory diseases can be enumerated. The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions for prevention or treatment of these diseases.<br>
Yet, the diseases described above are only for enumeration, not to limit the scope of clinical application of vanilloid receptor modulator.<br>
Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is a main pungent component in hot peppers. Hot peppers have been used, for a long time, not only as a spice but also as traditional medicine in the treatment of gastric disorders and when applied locally, for the relief of pain and inflammation (Szallasi and Blumberg, 1999, Pharm, Rev. 51, pp 159-211). Capsaicin has a wide spectrum of biological actions, and not only exhibits effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems but also induces pain and irritancy on local application. Capsaicin, however, after such induction of pain, induces desensitization, both to capsaicin itself and also to other noxious stimuli to make the pain stopped. Based on this property, capsaicin and its analogues such as olvanil, nuvanil, DA-5018, SDZ-249482, resiniferatoxin are either used as analgesic agent, therapeutic agent for incontinentia urinae or skin disorder, or under development (Wriggleworth and Walpole, 1998, Drugs of the Future 23, pp 531-538).<br>
Transmissions of mechanical, thermal and chemical noxious stimuli are mainly occurred by primary afferent nerve fibers of fine unmyelinated nerve (C-fiber) and thin myelinated nerve (A-fiber), and main reaction site of capsaicin and its analog called vanilloid is present at the nerve fiber transmitting the noxious stimuli. Capsaicin acts<br>
at the receptor existing on these neurons to induce potent stimuli by causing potent inflow of mono-and di-valent cations such as calcium and sodium, then exhibits potent analgesic effect by blocking the nervous function (Wood et al., 1988, J. Neurosci, 8, pp3208-3220). Vanilloid receptor (VR-1) has been recently cloned and its existence becomes clear(Caterina et al., 1997, Nature 389, pp816-824). It was clarified that this receptor transmits not only stimuli by capsaicin anlogues(vanilloid) but also various noxious stimuli such as proton and thermal stimuli (Tominaga et al., 1998, Neuron 21, pp531-543). Based on this, it is considered that vanilloid receptor functions as a integrative modulator against various noxious stimuli and carries out critical role hi transmissions of pain and noxious stimuli. Recently, knock-out mouse in which gene encoding for vanilloid receptor was deleted was prepared (Caterina et al., 2000, Science 288, pp306-313; Davis et al., 2000, Nature 405, pp!83-187). Compared to normal mice, the mouse was found out to exhibit much reduced reaction to thermal stimuli and thermal pain, while exhibiting no difference in general behavior, reconfirming the importance of the receptor in transmission of noxious signal. However, except proton, no other endogenous ligand, not exogenous ligand such as capsaicin, actually involved in transmission of noxious stimuli at vanilloid receptor was known. It is considered that leucotriene metabolite represented by 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) (Hwang et al, 2000, PNAS 11, pp6155-6160) and arachidonic aicd<br>
derivatives such as anandamide (Zygrnunt et al., 2000, Trends Pharmocol. Sci. 21, pp43-44) act as the most likely endogenous ligand for the receptor and proton acts as a cofactor with receptor-stimulating activity, rather than as a direct ligand.<br>
As such, a capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve cell and a vanilloid receptor existing hi the cell are distributed over the entire body and play basic function hi transmission of noxious stimuli and pain, further act as crucial factor in expression of neurogenic inflammation, thereby to have close relation with the cause of neuropathies, nerve injury, stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, urinary bladder hypersensitiveness, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, fervescence, skin disorder and inflammatory disease. Lately, their correlation even with neuropathic disease is suggested (WO 99/00125). Recently, attention has focused to the role of afferent sensory nerve responding to capsaicin in gastrointestinal injury, and it was proposed that the afferent nerve might have a dual character that it exhibits protective action against gastric damage by improving gastric microcirculation through releasing peripheral neuropeptide such as CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), while inducing gastric injury by stimulating sympathetic nervous system (Ren et al., 2000, Dig. Dis. Sci. 45, pp830-836). It is determined that vanilloid receptor modulator has very high potential to be used for prevention or treatment of the said various diseases by<br>
modulating the activity of the vanilloid receptor conducting such varied functions.<br>
As described above, there has been widely studied for clinical application of vanilloid receptor agonist, and it is understood that there is a possibility that the agonist derived from the present studies will be developed for clinical application. Though it may be, theoretically, anticipated that antagonist for this receptor would exhibit substantial degree of inhibitory action against pain and neurogenic inflammation., it was found out that the competitive antagonist for this receptor, capsazepine, almost the only one known until now, failed to exhibit significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (Perkins and Campbell, 1992, Br. J. Pharmacol. 107, pp329-333). Therefore, not much progress was made on this field. However, recently, there has been a report on significant results for analgesic action of capsazepine in animal studies (Kwak et al., 1998, Neurosci. 86, pp619-626; Santos and calixto, 1997, Neurosci. Lett. 235, pp73-76), in particular, the inventors of the present invention clearly demonstrated through animal studies the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the strong vanilloid receptor antagonists which were identified through experiments in our laboratory, and based on this, strongly suggest the development potential of vanilloid receptor antagonist as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerous agent. Yet, though the vanilloid receptor antagonist or agonist derived from the present studies will mainly act based on<br>
:he antagonistic or agonistic activity of itself, even a possibility that it could exhibit the pharmacological activity through transformation into agonist or antagonist via metabolism after absorption into body is not to be excluded.<br>
The present invention is to provide novel compounds which are acted as a modulator for vanilloid receptor and exhibit excellent analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer effects, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same.<br>

Experimental Example.   Biological potency test<br>
(1) 4S Ca influx test<br>
1) Separation of spinal dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in newborn rats and primary culture thereof<br>
Neonatal(2-day old or younger than 2-day old) SD rats were put in ice for 5 minutes to anesthetize and disinfected with 70% ethanol. DRG of all part of spinal cord were dissected (Wood et al., 1988, J. Neurosci. 8, pp3208-3220) and coUected in DME/F12 medium to which 1.2 g/1 sodium bicarbonate, 50 rag/1 gentamycin were added. The DRG were incubated sequentially at 37°C for 30 min in 200 U/ml collagenase and 2.5 mg/ml trypsin, separately. The ganglia were washed twice with DME/F12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, triturated through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, filtered through Nitex 40 membrane to obtain single cell suspension. This was subjected to centrifugation, then re-suspended in cell culture<br>
medium at certain level of cell density.     As the cell culture medium, DME/F12<br>
medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, diluted 1:1 with identical medium conditioned by C6 glioma cells (2 days on a confluent monolayer) was used, and NGF(Nerve Growth Factor) was added to final concentration of 200 ng/ml. After the cells were grown 2 days in'medium where cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C, 100 µM) was added to kill dividing nonneuronal cells, medium was changed to one without Ara-C. The resuspended cells were plated at a density of 1500-1700 neurons/well onto Terasaki plates previously coated with 10 µg/ml poly-D-ornithine.<br>
2) 45 Ca influx experiments<br>
DRG nerve cells from the primary culture of 2-3 days were equilibrated by washing 4 times with HEPES (lOmM, pH 7.4)-buffered Ca 2+, Mg2+-free HBSS (H-HBSS). The solution in each well was removed from the individual well. Medium containing the test compound plus capsaicin (final concentration 0.5 µM) and 45Ca (final concentration 10 µCi/ml) in H-HBSS was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 mm, Terasaki plates were washed six times with H-HBSS and dried in an oven. To each well, 0.3% SDS (10 ul) was added to elute45Ca. After the addition of 2ml of scintillation cocktail into each well, the amount of 45Ca influx into neuron was measured by counting radioactivity. Antagonistic activities of test compounds against vanilloid receptor were calculated as percent of the inhibition of maximal response of capsaicin at a concentration of 0.5 µM and results are given as<br>
C50(Table la, 1b and 1c).<br>
Agonistic activities of the test compounds for vanilloid receptor were determined as a concentration of the test compound showing 50% of the 45Ca influx, compared to the maximal amount of 45Ca influx in case of using 3 uM capsaicin and<br>
results are given as EC50 (Table Id).<br>
(2) Channel activity assay<br>
Antagonistic activities of test compounds were assayed based on electrical change of cation channel connected to vanilloid receptor and experiments were conducted according to reference method (Oh et al., 1996, J. Neuroscience 16,<br>

 (3) Analgesic activity test: Mouse writhing test by inducing with phenyl-p-quinone<br>
Male ICR mice (mean body weight 25 g) were maintained in a controlled<br>
lighting environment (12 h on/ 12 h off) for experiment.    Animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.3ml of the chemical irritant phenyl-p-quinone (dissolved in<br>
saline containing 5% ethanol to be a dose of 4.5mg/kg) and 6 min later, the number of abdominal constrictions was counted in the subsequent 6 mm period. Animals (10 animals/group) received 0.2ml of test compounds solution in vehicle of ethanol/Tween 80/saline (10/10/80) intraperitoneally 30 mm before the injection of phenyl-p-quinone. A reduction in the number of writhes responding to the test drug compound relative to the number responding in saline control group was considered to be indicative of an analgesic effect. Analgesic effect was calculated by % inhibition equation (% inhibition=(C-T)/C x 100), wherein C and T represent the number of writhes in control and compound-treated group, respectively (Table 2).<br>
The test results demonstrated that analgesic effect of the compounds used in this experiment is as potent as indomethacin which is a very potent antiinflmmatory and analgesic agent. In particular, it is significant to clarify that vanilloid receptor antagonist can exhibit such potent analgesic effect, and the results suggests that vanilloid receptor antagonist has potential as an analgesic agent.<br>

(4) Antiinflammatory activity test: TPA(12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate)-induced<br>
mouse ear edema test<br>
Male ICR mice(body weight 25-30g), 10 animals/group, were treated topically on the right ear with 30 µl of TPA (2.5 µg) solution in acetone and after 15 min, 30 µl of acetone or test compound solution in acetone was applied topically. After six hours, an identical treatment was applied again. After twenty four hours following the treatment of TPA, the animals were sacrificed and ear tissue was dissected using 6 mm-diameter punch. Ear tissue dissected were weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg on an electrobalance. The increased weight of the tissue compared to control group was considered as an index of inflammation. The percent inhibition is defined by the following equation:<br>
% inhibition =(C-T)/C x 100, wherein C and T represent an increase of ear weight in TPA-treated and TPA+drug-treated group, respectively (Table 3).<br>
The above experiment shows that vanilloid receptor antagonist exhibits anti-inflammatory effects of the same level with indomethacin which is very potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent. This phenomenon can be understood by connecting with the action of vanilloid receptor in neurogenic inflammation, and suggests potential applicability of vanilloid receptor antagonist in various inflammatory<br>
diseases, in particular, neurogenic inflammatory diseases.<br>

 (5) Ulcer test: ethanol-induced anti-ulcer test<br>
Male SD rats (body weight 180-200 g), 5 animals/group, were fasted for 24<br>
hours, and their stomaches were damaged. The rats were administered with 10 ml/kg of test drug suspended in 1 % methylcellulose orally and, after 1 hour, 1 ml of 99% ethanol orally. After 1 hour without food and water, the rats were sacrificed by cervical .dislocation and stomaches thereof were removed. The removed stomaches were incised along the greater curvature and opened. Then, the degree of gastric damage was scored based on the following ulcer index which is a criterion for evaluation and the percent inhibition of test drug against ulcer was calculated compared to control group (1% methylcellulose) (table 4). % inhibition =[(ulcer index of control group - ulcer index of drug-treated group)/( ulcer index of control group)] x 100<br>
According to the present study using ethanol-induced ulcer model, the vanilloid receptor antagonist was found out to exhibit significant anti-ulcerous activities, contrary to ranitidine, which is a representative antiulcerant but did not show anti-ulcer activity in the present study. This study is the first to demonstrate the anti-ulcerous potential of vanilloid receptor antagonist. Based on the result, possibility that vanilloid receptor antagonist will be developed as an anti-ulcerant is suggested.<br><br>
