				<td>Title:	Novel Microorganisms<br>
The present invention relates to fungi, which do not produce proteases. The fungi of the invention are useful as hosts for the production of proteins susceptible to proteolytic degradation by the proteases usually produced, and the invention consequently encompasses processes for the production of proteins of interest in high yields by using the fungi of the invention. The invention also comprises methods for producing such fungi and DNA Constructs to be used in these methods.<br><br>
Fungi, and especially filamentous fungi, are widely used commercially because of their ability to secrete remarkably high levels of proteins<br>
Among the filamentous fungi species belonging to the genus Aspergillus have a long history of commercial use for the production of endogenous and lately also heterologous proteins.<br>
One disadvantage with most microorganisms used for the production of proteins is the inherent production of proteases which may subject a protein product of interest to degradation due to proteolysis.<br>
Various ways of avoiding this have been envisaged. Among other solutions it has been suggested to delete or disrupt the genes encoding the various proteases. Unfortunately, the fungi produce a high number of proteases making such a solution more or less unrealistic.<br>
A need is therefore persisting for strains of filamentous fungi exhibiting no or very low levels of protease production.<br><br>
For a number of years it has been known that the regulatory gene areA which mediates nitrogen metabolite repression in A. nidulans influences the production of extracellular proteases (Arst &amp; Cove, molec. gen. Genet. 126,(1973) 111-141).<br>
The areA gene from A. nidulans has been cloned (Caddick et al., EMBO Journal 5, (1986) 1087-1090) and various modifications made to it to evaluate functions of different regions in the activator protein encoded by this gene (Stankovitch et al. Mol. Microbiol. 7, (1993) 81-87). Furthermore the gene coding the corresponding function in A. Jumigatus apparently has been cloned recently (Hensel et al. 2nd European Conference on Fungal Genetics, April 28 to May 1,1994, Book of Abstracts, Ell).<br>
From the literature a single use is also known of a strain of A. nidulans of genotype argB areA 1 as a host for the production of t-PA (Upshall et al. Biotechnology 5, (1987) 1301-1304). In this example only the argB genotype is used as a selection marker through its arginine prototrophy, while the areA genotype is simply a coincidence.<br>
International Patent Publication No. WO 95/35385 discloses the deletion of the areA gene as a means for reducing the protease level in filamentous fungi.<br>
Apart from the extracellular proteases, fungi also produce a number of intracellular proteases (also called endoplasmic).<br>
Among these a serine protease of the subtilisin type produced by A. niger and designated PepC has been described, the gene expressing it cloned, and a deletion mutant described in EP 574 347 and in Frederick et al, Gene, 125 57-64 (1993)<br>
A further such protease of the aspartic type designated PepE has been dis¬closed in Jarai et al, Gene, 145 171-178 (1994). the article discloses the cloning and characterisation of the pepE gene and speculates about the regulation of the pepE and pepC genes.<br>
The present invention has as an object the alleviation of the need for protease free filamentous fungi.<br><br><br>
The present invention consequently relates to fungi, wherein the areA,pepC, and/or pepE genes by recombinant DNA technology have been modified such that they cannot be expressed in a way providing for a functional AreA activator and functional PepC and/or PepE proteases.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to methods for producing such fungi, obtained by deletion of the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes.<br>
This may be obtained through a method comprising<br>
i)	cloning of the areA,pepC, and/or pepE genes from a fungus of interest,<br>
ii)	producing DNA constructs each comprising one among the areA gene, the<br>
pepC gene, and the pepE gene, wherein an internal part has been substituted,<br>
deleted, or extra DNA has been inserted,<br>
iii)	transforming said fungus with the constructs, and<br>
iv)	isolating transformants which are areA',pepC, and/orpepK.<br>
The information obtained from the above mentioned cloning of the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes may also be used in connection with the well-known anti-sense technology, to construct an expression plasmid giving rise to synthesis of a RNA molecules complementary to the mRNA transcribed from the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes, and to transform the fungus of interest therewith.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to DNA constructs intended for use in the above mentioned methods.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to methods of producing a desired protein or gene product, especially secreted proteins, whereby a fungal host modified and optionally transformed with a DNA construct comprising at least a DNA sequence coding for the protein or gene product of interest, is cultivated in a suitable growth medium at appropriate conditions and the desired gene product is recovered and purified.<br>
When working with the invention it was surprisingly found that the fungi of the invention produces such secreted proteins in a much improved yield.<br><br>
It was also surprisingly found that the only nitrogen source capable of providing good growth of the A. oryzae areA' strains was glutamine.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to protein products produced by the above methods.<br>
Also the invention relates to a DNA sequence coding for the pepC gene from A. oryzae (SEQ ID No. 1) or functional alleles thereof.<br>
The invention also covers a PepC protease from A. oryzae (SEQ ID No. 2), and processes for the production of the PepC protease comprising transforming a suitable host with a DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence coding for the PepC protease, selecting a transformant capable of producing said PepC protease, cultivating said transformant in an appropriate growth medium and recovering said PepC protease from said culture.<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to a DNA sequence coding for the pepE gene from A. oryzae (SEQ ID No. 3) or functional alleles thereof.<br>
Also, the invention relates to a PepE protease from A. oryzae (SEQ ID No. 4), and processes for the production of the PepE protease comprising transforming a suitable host with a DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence coding therefore, selecting a transformant capable of producing said PepE protease, cultivating said transformant in an appropriate growth medium and recovering said PepE protease from said culture.<br>
According to these aspects said host is preferably a fungus, according to the invention, especially A. oryzae, and wherein said DNA construct provides for an extra copy of the gene encoding either said PepC or PepE protease.<br><br>
The invention is described in further detail in the following parts of the specification with reference to the Examples and the drawing, wherein<br><br>

Figs. 14a and 14b show the construction of pToC338.<br>
In the present specification the following definitions are used:<br>
The expression areAD means a strain in which the areA gene is deleted. Similar notations are used for strains, wherein \hepepC, and/or pepE genes are deleted.<br>
The expression areA' means a strain which does not produce a functional AreA activator. The term "loss of function" is also often used for this. Similar notations used for strains, which do not produce functional PepC, and/or PepE protease(s).<br>
The expression "anti-sense technology" describes methods such as disclosed in US Patent No. 5,190,931.<br><br>
As indicated the present invention relates in its first aspect to fungi, wherein the areA gene by recombinant DNA technology has been modified in a way by which it cannot be expressed in a way providing for a functional AreA activator, and wherein the genes encoding for the extracellular proteases PepC and/or PepE has been inactivated in a manner whereby they are not expressed to produce functional proteases.<br>
This object may specifically be obtained by deletion or disruption of the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes.<br>
The cloning of the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes are described in the Examples.<br>
AreA homologs from other fungi could be cloned either by cross hybridization with one of the already known genes or by complementation of areA mutants; e.g. A. nidulans areA-18 or the A. oryzae areA deleted strain described in this application.<br>
Methods for deleting or disrupting a gene are specifically described in WO 90/00192 (Genencor).<br>
Methods for substituting DNA in a gene are also generally known, and can be accomplished by substituting one or more continuous parts of the gene, but it may also be obtained by site directed mutagenesis generating a DNA sequence encoding a AreA activator variant that is not functional.<br>
Another method by which such an object may be obtained is by using anti-sense technology.<br>
The anti-sense technology and how to employ it is described in detail in the aforementioned US Patent No. 5,190,931 (University of New York).<br>
A further method of obtaining said inactivation is by inserting extra DNA internally in the areA gene, thereby giving rise to the expression of a dysfunctional activator protein.<br>
In connection with this method information provided by the cloning can be used to make DNA constructs that can be integrated into the areA gene, and even replace it with another gene, such as the pyrG gene.<br>
7<br><br>
A further method of avoiding the presence of the areA activator is by interfering with the regulation of the expression signals regulating the expression of the areA gene itself.<br>
The principles described above apply equally to the/jepC, and/or pepE genes.<br>
According to the invention the fungus preferably belongs to a genus selected from the group comprising Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Humicola, Candida, Acremonium, Fusarium, and Penicillium.<br>
Among these genera species selected from the group comprising A. otyzae, A. niger, A. awamori, A. phoenicis, A. japonicus, A, foetidus, A. nidulans, T. reesei, T. hanianum, H. insolens, H. lanuginosa, F. graminearum, F. solani, P. chrysogenum, and others are preferred.<br>
As indicated the invention also is meant to encompass the method for<br>
producing the fungi of the first aspect of the invention, and wherein said inactivation has<br>
been obtained by deletion of the areA,pepC, and/or pepE genes, which method comprises<br>
i)	cloning of the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes from a fungus of interest,<br>
ii)	producing DNA constructs each comprising one among the areA gene, the<br>
pepC gene, and/or the pepE gene, wherein an internal part has been<br>
substituted, deleted, or extra DNA has been inserted,<br>
iii)	transforming said fungus with the constructs, and<br>
iv)	isolating transformants which are areA',pepC, and/or pepE.<br>
Since it is believed that the maturation of the PepC protease is controlled by the PepE protease the invention also comprises a method for producing a fungus of the invention, wherein said inactivation has been obtained by deletion of the areA and pepE genes, which method comprises<br>
i)	cloning of the areA and pepE genes from a fungus of interest,<br>
ii)	producing DNA constructs each comprising one among the areA gene and the<br>
pepE gene, wherein an internal part has been substituted, deleted, or extra<br>
DNA has been inserted,<br>
iii)	transforming said fungus with the constructs, and<br>
8<br><br>
iv)	isolating transformants which are areA\ andpepE.<br>
Also included is the method for producing the fungi, wherein the inactivation<br>
has been obtained by using anti-sense technology. Such a method comprising<br>
i)	construction of expression plasmids, each of which give rise to synthesis of an<br>
RNA molecule complementary to the mRNA transcribed from the areA gene,<br>
the pepC gene, and/or the pepE gene,<br>
ii)	transformation of die host fungus with said expression plasmids and a suitable<br>
marker, either on separate plasmids or on the same plasmid,<br>
iii)	selection of transformants using said marker, and<br>
iv)	screening selected transformants for strains exhibiting a reduction in the<br>
synthesis of the AreA, PepC, and/or PepE products.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is meant to comprise DNA constructs for use in the above mentioned methods.<br>
In respect of the former method said DNA constructs may comprise the areA, pepC, and/or pepE genes, wherein an interna) part has been substituted, deleted, or extra DNA has been inserted.<br>
At least one of the DNA constructs may furthermore also comprise DNA sequences encoding a protein product of interest, such as those mentioned later.<br>
In respect of the latter anti-sense method the DNA constructs may comprise inverted DNA sequence of the areA,pepC, and/or pepE genes connected to a functional promoter, whereby the mRNAs are at least partially complementary to mRNAs produced from the areA,pepC, and/or pepE genes.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for the production of a desired gene product, preferably a secreted gene product, whereby a iungus according to the invention is cultivated in a suitable growth medium at appropriate conditions and the desired gene product is recovered and purified.<br><br>
In the case of a gene product expressed by a heterologous gene the DNA sequence coding for the desired gene product may be a part of the DNA construct used for producing said fungus.<br>
Normally, however, a separate transformation of the fungus of the invention is performed in order to make the fungus capable of producing the desired product.<br>
Methods for transforming fungi are well known in the art, cf. e.g. EP 0 184 438 A2 (Gist-Brocades N.V.) and EP publication No. 0 98 993 (Novo Nordisk A/S).<br>
For indigenous products this is of course not necessary, but in order to increase the production it may be an advantage to provide for multiple copies of the gene encoding the protein of interest to be incorporated into the host.<br>
The desired gene product is generally a peptide or protein, preferably an enzyme.<br>
Among enzymes it is preferably selected from the group comprising proteases, such as trypsin and chymosin; lipases, cutinases, cellulases, xylanases, laccases, pectinases, etc.<br>
Another type of desired gene product is generally a therapeutically active peptide or protein.<br>
Among the therapeutically active peptide or protein the protein preferably is selected from the group comprising insulin, growth hormone, glucagon, somatostatin, interferons, PDGF, factor VII, factor Vm, urokinase, t-PA, CSF, lactoferrin, TPO etc.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the DNA sequences coding for the pepC gene from A. oryzae (SEQ ID No. 1), the pepE gene from A oryzae (SEQ ID No. 3)or functional alleles thereof. Also encompassed by the invention are the corresponding PepC and PepE proteases and their production, preferably by recombinant means.<br>
In this aspect the invention relates to processes for the production of the PepC protease or PepE protease from A. oryzae comprising transforming a suitable host with a DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence encoding the protease of interest, selecting a transformant capable of producing the protease, cultivating the transformant<br><br>
in an appropriate growth medium and recovering the PepC or PepE protease from the culture.<br>
The host used in such a process is preferably a host according to the above mentioned aspects of the invention<br>
In certain embodiments of the process for producing the PepC or PepE protease the host is A. oryzae. In that case it is preferred that the DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence coding for the protease, provides for an extra copy of the gene already present in the host.<br>
The DNA construct comprising the DNA sequence encoding the protease will normally also comprise regulatory elements in order to provide for proper expression and processing of the protease in the host.<br>
The invention is explained in further detail in the Examples given below. These should, however, not in any way be construed as limiting the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>

Example 1<br><br>
The A. oryzae pepE gene was cloned by cross-hybridization with the A. niger gene. A partial A. niger gene was obtained as a 700 bp PCR fragment from a PCR reaction with A. niger chromosomal DNA and pepE specific primers made according to thcpepE sequence published by G. Jarai et al, Gene 145 (1994) 171-178. The fragment was shown to contain pepE sequences by DNA sequencing. It hybridizes to A, oryzae chromosomal DNA under stringent conditions and Southern analysis showed that A. oryzae contains a single pepE like gene.<br>
The pepE gene was deleted both by the gene replacement method and the two step gene replacement method (G. May in "Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi" (1992) pp. 1-25. Eds. J. R. Kinghorn and G. Turner; Blackie Academic and Professional). As marker was used the A. oryzaepyrG gene, the A. oryzae strain was apyrG- strain made by deletion of Xh&amp;pyrG gene.<br><br>
A cosmid library of Aspergillus oryzae was constructed essentially according to the instruction from the supplier (Stratagene) of the "SuperCosl cosmid vector kit".<br>
Genomic DNA of A. oryzae IF04177 was prepared from protoplasts made by standard procedures (Christensen, T., et. al., Biotechnology 6 (1988) 1419-1422). After isolation of the protoplasts they were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes in a Labofuge T (Heto), the pellet was suspended in 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 100 ug/ml proteinase K and 0.5% SDS as stated in the manual from the Supercos 1 cosmid vector kit and the rest of the DNA preparation was done according to the kit's instructions. The size of the genomic DNA was analysed by electrophoresis<br><br>
using the CHEF-gel apparatus from Biorad. A 1% agarose gel was run for 20 hours at 200 volt with a 10-50 second pulse. The gel was stained by etidium bromide and photographed. The DNA was 50-&gt;100 kb in size. The DNA was partially restricted by Sau3A. The size of the restricted DNA was 20-50 kb determined by the same type of CHEF-gel analysis as above. The CsCl gradient banded SuperCosl vector was prepared according to the manual. Ligation and packaging was likewise done as described. After titration of the library all of the packaging mix from one ligation and packaging was transfected into the host cells XL 1-Blue MR and plated on 50 jig/ml ampicillin LB plates. Approximately 3800 colonies were obtained. Cosmid preparation from 10 colonies showed that they all had inserts of the expected size. The colonies were picked individually and inoculated in microtiter plate wells with 100 ul LB (100 ug/ml ampicillin) and incubated at 37°C over night. 100 ul of 50% glycerol was added to each well and the whole library was frozen at -80°C. A total of 3822 colonies were stored. This represents the A. oryzae genome apr. 4.4 times.<br>
The individually frozen colonies in the library were inoculated onto LB-plates (100ng/ml ampiciUin) by using a multipin device with 6 times 8 pins fitting into half a microtiter dish. Plates were made containing colonies from all clones in the library. The plates were incubated at 37 C over night. Sterilized Whatman 540 filters cut to the size of a petri dish were placed upon the colonies which were incubated for two more hours at 37 C. The filters were transferred to LB plates containing 200|ag/ml of chloramphenicol and the plates were incubated over night at 37 C.The next day the filters were washed twice in 0.5 M NaOH for 5 minutes, then twice in 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH=7.4) for 5 minutes and then twice in 2 x SSC for 5 minutes. The filters were wet with ethanol and air-dried.<br>
The filters were hybridized with a 0.7 kb 32P labelled PCR fragment containing part of the pepE gene from A. niger. The PCR fragment was obtained by running PCR on chromosomal DNA from A. niger with two primer 700 bp apart in the DNA sequence. The hybridization was carried out for 16 hours at 65 C in 10 Denhart, 5 x SSC, 0.02 M EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.15 mg/ml polyA and 0.05 mg/ml yeast tRNA. After hybridization the filters were washed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45°C twice and placed on X-ray films. 5 colonies hybridized with the probe, 4 of them were subsequently shown to contain the A. oryzae pepE gene by Southern analysis of the isolated cosmid DNA, using<br><br>
the same probe. Three of the cosmids were identical, thus two different cosmid clones containing pepE were isolated, they were called 7C7 and 33C1, names referring to their position in the stored library. Two overlapping fragments, a 4.3 kb EcoRI fragment (pToC299) and a 2.4 kb Hindlll (pToC301) fragment, were subcloned and partially sequenced. SEQ. ID No. 1 shows the DNA sequence and the deduced aa sequence for the protease. The gene shows strong homology to the A. niger gene.<br>
The A. oryzae pyrG gene was cloned by cross hybridization with the A. niger pyrG gene (W. van Hartingsveldt et al., Mol. Gen. Genet 206:71-75 (1987)). A lambda library of partial SauIIlA digested A, oryzae IF04177 DNA was probed at low stringency with a 1 kb DNA fragment from the A. niger pyrG gene. A 3.8 kb Hindlll fragment from a positive clone was subcloned into a pUC118 vector. The resultant plasmid, pS02, was shown to contain ihepyrG gene by complementation of an A. niger pyrG' mutant.<br><br>
A pyrG deletion plasmid, pS05, containing about 1 kb of pyrG flanking sequences on each end was constructed from the plasmid pS02. A. oryzae IF04177 was transformed with this construct and transformants were selected by resistance to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (FOA), a phenotype characteristic of pyrG mutants. One transformant, HowBlOl, was shown by Southern analysis to have the expected deletion at the pyrG locus. Being a pyrG mutant HowBlOl requires uridine for growth. HowBlOl can be transformed with the wtpyrG gene by selection for ability to grow without uridine.<br>
The steps involved in the construction of HowBlOl are illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
A plasmid, pToC345, designed to replace the pepE gene with the pyrG gene, was constructed.<br><br>
Two PCR reactions were run with pToC299 as template; the first primer set was :<br>
19819	GAAGATCTGCGCGGATGTACATTGTAG<br>
19821	TTAGTCAGAAATTCGTCCCG<br>
The second was:<br>
19820	CCCAAGCTTCATGCTCGACCAGGGCCTCCT<br>
19818	GGTCTGTGTTAACCAAAGAAC<br>
The appr. 800 bp fragment obtained with 19819/19821 was cut with BgllllHindlH and cloned together with the 1.1 kb fragment obtained with 19820/19818 and cut with HindlHIPstI into BglWPstl cut pIC19R (J. L. Marsh et al, Gene 32 (1984) 481-484). The resulting plasmid was cut at the unique Hindlll site, dephosphorylated and the 3.5 kb pyrG containing fragment from pJaL335 (described in Example 2) was inserted. The construction of pToC345 is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
HowBlOl was transformed with EcoRI cut pToC345 using standard procedures and transformants were selected by their ability to grow without the addition of uridine. 100 transformants were reisolated once through conidiospores. Spores were picked from single colonies on the reisolation plates and suspended in 100 ml of water with 0.01% Trition X-100. 1 ml spore suspension from each transformant and from IF04177, which was included as a control strain, were spotted on two Whatmann 540 filters placed on top of each their YPD plate. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 18 hours. The filters were removed from the plates and placed in 20% SDS for two hours at room temperature. They were then bakes for 3 minutes in a 600W micro-wawe oven. The filters were then washed for 5 minutes in 10%SDS, 2 times 5 minutes in 0.5M NaOH, 1.5M NaCl, one time 5 minutes in 0.5MTris-HCl pH=7.5, 1.5M NaCl and one time 5 minutes in 20xSSC and air dried. The two sets of filters were hybridized by standard procedures with each their 32p_iaDeUed probe. One set was hybridized with a 600bp BbuIIHindlll fragment from pToC299 containing the part of the pepE gene that was attempted to be deleted. The other set of filters was hybridized with a DNA<br><br>
fragment from the A. oryzae tpi gene. Any gene present in one copy, but pepE could be used since this is a control of the amount of DNA bound to the filters.<br>
After hybridization the filters were washed with O.lxSSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C and the radioactivity bound to the filters were visualized by a Phospolmager. 13 of the transformants were picked for further analysis because they showed little hybridization to the pepE probe compared to the hybridization to the control probe. Chromosomal DNA was prepared by standard procedures and a Southern blot of the<br>
EcoRI restricted DNA was hybridized with a 32p-iabelled l.lkb Bbul fragment from pToC299 containing the 3' part of XhepepE gene which was not to be deleted. In the wt strain a 4.3 kb fragment should hybridize to the probe, in a correct replacement strain the 4.3 kb fragment should be replaced by a 7.2kb fragment. Two of the transformants looked correct, one had no hybridizing bands at all and most had the wt band plus maybe one other band, indicating integration of the transforming DNA at a non¬homologous locus.<br>
In order to isolate a pyrG~ derivative of the pepE deleted strain 10? conidiospores were spread on FOA containing plates and resistant colonies were selected. The FOA resistant colonies were reisolated, DNA was prepared and Southern analysis was performed to identify the strains in which the pyrG gene was lost via recombination between the repeat sequences flanking the gene in pToC345.<br><br>
A plasmid, pToC315, designed for a two step gene deletion of \hepepE gene was constructed. A 1.6 kb EcoRI/Hindlll (the Hindlll site was blunt ended by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase) from pToC299 containing sequences upstream from the pepE gene was cloned together with a 1.4 kb Sall/Bbul (the Bbul fragment was blunt ended) containing the 3 'end of the pepE gene into the EcoRI/Sall cut vector pUC19. The resulting plasmid was cut at the unique Hindlll site in the pUC19 linker, dephosphorylated and the 1.8 kb pyrG containing fragment from pJets4 was inserted. The construction of pToC315 is illustrated in Fig. 3.<br><br>
HowBlOl was transformed with pToC315 using standard procedures and transformants were selected by their ability to grow without the addition of uridine. After reisolation chromosomal DNA was prepared from 12 transformants, the DNA was cut with Asp718 and analysed by Southern analyses with a Bbul fragment from pToC301 containing part of ihepepE gene as a radioactive labelled probe. One transformant had the plasmid integrated in the endogenous pepE gene as revealed by the disappearance of the pepE specific Asp718 fragment, which had been replaced by two new bands as predicted if pToC315 had integrated as a single copy by homologous recombination at the pepE locus. The transformant was named ToC1089. 5x10 conidiae spores of ToC1089 were spread on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid selecting for loss of the pyrG gene. This is the second step in a two step gene deletion, the pyrG gene can be lost by recombination with either of two pairs of identical sequences, one of which will result in the deletion of the pepE gene as well. The procedure is depicted in Fig. 4. The frequency of 5-fluoro-orotic acid resistance was approximately 10". The 5-fluoro-orotic acid resistant colonies were reisolated and a strain deleted for the pepE gene was identified by Southern analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The A. oryzae pepC gene was cloned by cross-hybridization with the A. niger gene. The A. niger gene was obtained as a 1.1 kb PCR fragment from a PCR reaction with A. niger chromosomal DNA and pepC specific primers made according to the pepC sequence published by Frederick. G.D et al. Gene 125 (1993) 57-64. The fragment was shown to contain pepC sequences by DNA sequencing. It hybridizes to A. oryzae chromosomal DNA under stringent conditions and Southern analysis showed that A. oryzae contains a single pepC like gene.<br>
The pepC gene was deleted by a two step gene replacement method (G. May in "Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi" (1992) pp. 1-25. Eds. J. R. Kinghorn and G. Turner; Blackie Academic and Professional). As marker was used the A.<br><br>
otyzae pyrG gene, the A. oryzae strain was a pyrG strain made by deletion of the pyrG<br>
gene.<br>
From the published cDNA nucleotide sequence encoding A. niger pepC (Frederick G.D et al. Gene 125 (1993) 57-64) two oligonucleotides were designed so that the encoding part of the pepC gene where amplified in a PCR reaction. The primer #5258  where made so that the 3' end of the nucleotide sequence corresponds to the N-terminal part of the pepC gene (underline) and the 5'-end is for facilitating cloning (contains a BamHI restriction endonuclease site). The primer #5259<br>
where made so that the 3' end of the nucleotide sequence corresponds to the C-terminal part of thepepC gene and the 5'-end is for facilitating cloning (contains a Xhol restriction endonuclease site).<br>
Genomic DNA from A. niger was used as template in the PCR reaction. Amplification reaction were performed in 100 ul volumes containing 2.5 units Taq-polymerase, 100 ng of A, niger genomic DNA, 50 mM KC1, 10 raM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,1.5 mM MgCl2, 250 nM of each dNTP, and 100 pM of each of the two primers described above.<br>
Amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA Termal 480, and consisted of one cycle of 3 minutes at 94°C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 minutes at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, and 1 minutes at 72°C. The PCR reaction produces one DNA fragment of ca. 1.1 kb in length. This fragment were isolated by gel electrophoresis, purified, cloned into the vector pCR*^ (Invitrogen Corporation), and sequenced using standard methods known in the art of molecular biology. The resulting plasmid were called pJaL197.<br><br>
Southern blot of genomic DNA from A. oryzae IF04177 where hybridized with the 1.1 kb J2P labelled EcoRI DNA fragment from pJaL197 clone containing the A, niger pepC gene. Genomic DNA was cut with the following restriction enzymes: EcoRI, BamHI, Xhol, and Hindlll. Hybridization was carried out for 16 hours at 65°C in 10 * Denhart, 5 * SSC, 0.02 M EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.15 mg/ml polyA and 0.05 mg/ml yeast tRNA. After hybridization the filters were washed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C twice and placed on X-ray films. The probe hybridized to a single size of fragment in each of the four digest, indicating that the pepC gene is present in a single copy in A. oryzae IF04177.<br>
A partially library of A. oryzae genomic DNA was constructed containing BamHI fragments with a size of 4.5-5.5 kband ligated into the vector pIC19H. The above A. niger pepC gene clone was radiolabeled and used to probe the partial A. oryzae BamHI genomic library. Hybridization was carried out as described above. About 4000 E. coli colonies were screened and four positive colonies was obtained. The 4 clones was shown to be identical by restriction enzyme digestion. One of these clones called pJaL235 (Fig. 5), with an insert of 4.6 kb, was analyses further by restriction mapping and Southern blotting. This shows that the pepC gene is located in a 2.9 kb BamHIISall fragment. Sequencing of this 2.9 kb BamHIISall fragment revealed the presence of a long open reading frame of 495 amino acids interrupted by two introns with consensus sequences indicative of intron splicing. The sequence of the A. oryzae pepC gene is shown in SEQ ID No. 3.<br>
By PCR, with the primer #7659<br>
where the 3' end of the nucleotide sequence corresponds to position 7-26 in pS02 (underline) and the 5'-end is for facilitating cloning (contains a BgUI restriction endonuclease site), and the primer #7656<br><br><br>
where the 3' end of the nucleotide sequence corresponds to position 385-407 in pS02 (underline) and the 5'-end is for facilitating cloning (contains a EcoRI and HindlH restriction endonuclease site), on the plasmid pS02 a 432 bp fragment was amplified. The fragment was digested with BgllJ and EcoRI and isolated by gel electrophoresis, purified, and cloned into the corresponding site in pS02, resulting in plasmid pJaL335 (The construction is outlined in Fig. 6.<br>
Plasmid pJaL235 was digested with Pvul and treated with Klenow polymerase to make the ends blunt and then digested with Hindlll. The 2.6 kb fragment were isolated by gel electrophoresis, and purified. The 2.6 kb fragment was cloned into pUC12 digested with Sma/and Hindlll giving plasmid pJaL308.<br>
Plasmid pJaL308 was digested with Smal and treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5* phosphate groups according to the manufacturers instructions and phenol extracted and precipitated.<br>
Plasmid pS02 was digested with Hindlll, and treated with Klenow polymerase to make the ends blunt. The 3.8 kb fragment encoding the A. oryzae pyrG gene were isolated by gel electrophoresis, and purified.<br>
The two fragments are mixed together and ligated. After transformations of E. coli, the colonies carrying the correct plasmids are identified by restriction enzyme digestion of mini-plasmid preparations. The construction of pJaL363 is illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
Plasmid pJaL363 consist of pUC12 vector containing a fragment which carries the pepC gene flanked by an EcoRI site and an Hindlll and where the pepC is interrupted by an 3.8 kb DNA fragment encoding the A. oryzae pyrG gene.<br><br>
Plasmid pJaL335 is digested with HindHI, and treated with Klenow polymerase to make the ends blunt. The 3.5 kb fragment encoding the A. otyzaepyrG gene is isolated by gel electrophoresis, and purified. The fragment is cloned into pJaL308 Smal restriction site. The construction of pJaLz is outlined in Fig. 8. The plasmid consist of pUC 12 vector containing a fragment which carries the pepC gene flanked by an EcoRl site and an HindHI and where the pepC is interrupted by an 3.5 kb DNA fragment encoding the A. oryzaepyrG gene.<br><br>
15 ug of either one of the disruption plasmids is digested to completion by HindHI and EcoRl. The completeness of the digest is checked by running an aliquot on a gel and the remainder of the DNA is phenol extracted, precipitated and resuspended in 10 ufof sterile water.<br>
The transformation of A. oryzae HowBlOI host strain is preformed by the protoplast method (Christensen et al. Biotechnology (1988) 6:1419-1422). Typically, A. oryzae mycelia is grown in a rich nutrient broth. The mycelia is separated from the broth by filtration. The enzyme preparation Novozyme® (Novo Nordisk) is added to the mycelia in osmotically stabilizing buffer such as 1.2 M MgSCU buffered to pH 5.0 with sodium phosphate. The suspension was incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C with agitation. The protoplast is filtered through mira-cloth to remove mycelial debris. The protoplast is harvested and washed twice with STC (1.2 M sorbitol, 10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5). The protoplast is finally resuspended in 200-1000 jul STC.<br>
For transformation 5 ug DNA is added to 100 u.1 protoplast suspension and then 200 ul PEG solution (60% PEG 4000, 10 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) is added and the mixture is incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The protoplast is harvested and washed twice with 1 -2 M sorbitol. The protoplast is finally resuspended 200 ml 1.2 M sorbitol, plated on selective plates (minimal medium + 10 g/1 Bacto-Agar (Difco), and incubated at 37°C. After 3-4 days of growth at 37°C, stable transformants appear as vigorously growing and sporulating colonies.<br><br><br>
' From the stable colonies individual spores is streaked on fresh minimal plates. Single colonies is selected and restreaked to give pure cultures. These are used to inoculate 10 ml of liquid YPM medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% maltose). After 18 hours at 30°C shaking at 180 rpm, the mycelia are harvested on filter paper. Mycelia is then transfer to an 2 ml eppendorf tube and freeze dried. After freeze drying DNA is prepared from the individual mycelia by grinding the mycelia to a fine powder with a pestle in the tube. This powder are resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS, 1 ul DEP by vortexing. These are incubate at 65°C for 20 minutes. After this is added 0.1 ml 5 M KAc pH 6.5, the solution is mixed and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. The cell debris is separated from the DNA solution by centrifugation at 20.000 rpm for 5 minutes. 0.4 ml supernatant are precipitated with 0.3 ml isopropanol and centrifiigated at 20.000 rpm for 10 minutes. The DNA pellet is redissolved in 100 ul of sterile TE buffer containing 0.1 <br>
3 |ig of each DNA is digested with EcoRI, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilan-N membrane filters, and probe with the 1.5 kb 32P labelled Ncol DNA fragment from pJaL335 containing part of the pepC protease gene. Strains which carry a disruption of the pepC are easily recognized by that the wild type band on 3.6 kb is shifted to a 7.4 kb band in the transformant.<br>
The disrupted A. oryzae pepC strain is made pyrG minus by selecting spontaneous mutant resistance to 5-fluoro-orotic acid, a phenotype characteristic of pyrG mutants. Being a pyrG mutant the strain requires uridine for growth. The strain can be transformed with the wtpyrG gene by selection for the ability to grow without uridine.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br><br>
The areAA strain was constructed as follows. The areA gene from A. oryzae was cloned. A pyrG strain also deficient for either pepC or pepE or pepC plus pepE was<br><br>
transformed with a plasmid carrying the pyrG gene inserted between DNA fragments upstream and downstream from the areA gene. The coding region for areA was not present on the plasmid. Transformants were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of uridine and in the presence of chlorate. This double selection selects both for a functional pyrG gene and for areA minus. Strains obtained by this selection procedure were finally screened by Southern analysis to identify those in which the chromosomal areA gene was substituted by the pyrG gene.<br><br>
The A. oryzae areA gene was cloned by cross hybridization to the A. nidulans areA gene (B. Kudla et al., EMBO J. 9:1355-1364 (1990)). A genomic library of A. oryzae IF04177 was prepared by partial digestion of chromosomal DNA with SauIIIA and cloning of the obtained DNA fragments into the vector 1GEM-II (obtained from Promega). Cross hybridization of the library with the A. nidulans areA gene was performed in 40% formamide at 37°C. Hybridizing 1 clones were isolated and from these fragments were sub-cloned into the vector pBluescript SK+ (obtained from Stratagene) giving rise to the plasmids pSK5 and pSK9 illustrated in Fig. 9. The cloned gene was able to complement an A. nidulans areA mutant, proving that it is indeed the A oryzae areA homolog. 5643 bp of the clone was sequenced, and comparison of the sequences of the A. oryzae and the A. nidulans areA genes shows that they are highly homologous. The sequence of the A. oryzae areA gene is shown in SEQ ID No. 5.<br><br>
In order to delete the areA gene from the A. oryzae chromosome the plasmid pToC266 was constructed. pToC266 contains a 2.1 kb DNA fragment originating upstream of the areA gene (isolated from pSK5) and a 1.4 kb DNA fragment originating downstream from the areA gene (isolated from pSK9). The two fragments are separated by approximately 3.2 kb in the genome, the coding region is situated in this part of the gene. The A. oryzae pyrG gene from pjers4 was inserted between the areA upstream and downstream DNA fragments. The construction of pToC266 is illustrated in Figs. 10a and 10b. pToC266 has a unique EcoRI site and was linearized by cutting with this restriction enzyme before used in transformations.<br>
A pyrG strain also deficient for either pepC or pepE or pepC plus pepE is transformed with linearized pToC266. Transformants are selected on minimal plates (Cove Biochem. biophy. Acta (1966) 113 : 51-56) containing glutamine as the nitrogen source and glucose as the carbon source. Transformants are reisolated twice on the same type of plates, and then subjected to growth test on different nitrogen sources. Transformants growing well on glutamine but not on nitrate, ammonium or urea are expected to be deleted for areA. The deletion is confirmed by Southern analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br><br>
A plasmid containing the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopius (C. J. Thompson et. al, EMBO J. 6 : 2519-2523 (1987)) inserted after the A. oryzae TAKA-amylase promoter and followed by a fragment containing the transcriptional terminator and poEyadenylation signal from the A. niger gla gene was constructed.<br>
The plasmid, pMT1606, can be used for selection of glufosinate resistant transformants of A. oryzae. pMT1606 was constructed by isolating the bar gene from the plasmid pBPIT (B. Straubinger et. al, Fungal Genetics Newsletter 39 : 82-83 (1992)) and<br><br>
cloning it into the fungal expression plasmid p775 described in EP publication No. 0 098 993 Al. Fig. 11 illustrates the construction of pMT1606.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
An A. oryzae areAkgepE&amp;pepC strain is transformed with the plasmid pToC56 (Fig. 12), which is a fungal expression plasmid for the mammalian enzyme chymosin, by co-transformation with pMT1606. Construction of the plasmid pToC56 is described in EP publication No. 0 98 993.<br>
Transformants are selected for growth on minimal medium containing 10 mM ammonium and 1 mg/ml glufosinate and screened for the presence of pToC56 by the ability to produce chymosin. The transformants are grown in shake flasks in minimal medium containing maltodextrin and glutamine for 4 days at 30°C.The content of chymosin in the supernatants were analysed by SDS-Page and Western blotting.<br>
Example 6<br><br>
Construction of an expression plasmid for pepC. Plasmid pJaL235 was digested with AatH and Nsil and treated with Klenow polymerase to make the ends blunt. The 1.7 kb fragment was isolated by gel electrophoresis, and purified. The 1.7 kb fragment was cloned into pIC19H digested with Smal giving pJaL365.<br>
Plasmid pJaL365 was digested with BamHI and Xhol and the 1.7 kb fragment was isolated by gel electrophoresis, and purified. The 1.7 kb fragment was cloned into pToC68 digested with BamHI and Xhol giving pJaL368 (Figs. 13a and 13 b).<br><br>
An A. oryzae strain is transformed with the plasmid pJaL368, which is a fungal expression plasmid for the protease PepC, by cotransformation with pToC90.<br>
Transformants are selected for growth on minimal medium containing 10 mM acetamide and screened for the presence of pJaL368 by the ability to produce the protease PepC.<br>
Example 7<br>
Overevpression nf pc.pK<br>
A plasmid called pToC338 carrying the pepE gene fused to the TAKA-amylase promoter from A. oryzae was constructed. Figs. 14a and 14b depicts the construction.<br>
An EcoRllSall fragment from pToC299 containing most of the coding region and appr. 430 bp of the 3' untranslated region of pepE was cloned into EcoRllBamHl cut pUC19 together with a synthetic DNA fragment of the following sequence:<br>
8681    GATCCACCATGAAG 8747    GTGGTACTTCAGCT<br>
The resulting plasmid called pToC334 was cut with BamHIIEcoRI and a fragment containing the entire structural gene of pepE with a BamHI site fused immediately upstream of the start codon was isolated, approximately 430 bp of untranslated 3' sequence was also present in the fragment. The fragment was cloned into EcoRIISai7 cut pUC19 together with an approximately 1.1 kb SalllBamHI fragment from the plasmid p775 containing the TAKA-amylase promoter from A. oryzae. The resulting plasmid was named pToC338.<br>
pToC338 was co-transformed into A, oryzae JaL125 (an A. oryzae alp minus strain described in Danish Patent Application No. 0354/96) with pToC90, which contains the A. nidulans acetamidase (amdS) gene, using standard procedures {e.g. as described in<br><br>
EP 0 098 993 Al). Transformants were selected by their ability to use acetamide as the sole nitrogen source. 11 transformants were reisolated twice through conidiospores. The transformants were fermented for three days at 30°C inlO ml YPM (YP with 2% maltose) and the fermentation broth was analysed by SDS-page. One of the transformants produced a protein of the same size as the protein encoded by the pepE gene, protease activity measurements confirmed that the broth from that transformant contained a higher activity toward casein at pH=5.5 compared to the host strain JaL125. The protein was purified and N-terminal sequencing showed that it is indeed the protein encoded by the pepE gene. The N-terminal of the secreted protein was:<br>
gly*-arg-his-asp-val-leu-val-asp-asn-phe-leu-asn-ala-gln-tyr-phe-ser-glu-ile-glu-ile-gly-<br>
thr-pro-pro-gln-lys-phe-lys<br>
