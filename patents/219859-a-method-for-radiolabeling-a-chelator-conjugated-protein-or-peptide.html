				<td>Kit for Radiolabeling Proteins with Yttrium-90<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates Co kits and methods for radiolabeling proceins and peptides with therapeutic radioisotopes such that these radiolabeled proteins may be administered directly to patients without the need for additional purification. Such kits and methods are particularly applicable to labeling proteins and peptides with yttrium-90 ('0Y). By optimizing the radiolabeling protocol such that no further purification of the radiolabeled protein is required, the present invention has satisfied a long-felt need in the art by solving the persistent problem of how to provide yttrium-labeled drugs in a user-friendly format such that these drugs may be easily prepared and administered in the hospital or outpatient setting.<br><br>
Technology Background<br>
ALL publications and patent applications herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was speccaUy and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Radiolabeled proteins, particularly antibodies, have been undergoing evaluation for many years as potential diagnostic and therapeutic reagents. Such reagents are thought to be particularly useful as cancer therapeutics, now that researchers are beginning to identify tumor-specific antigens and cognate ligands or antibodies which bind to such antigens. By administering a radiolabeled ligand or antibody which has binding specificity for a tumor-specific antigen, coupled to a radioisotope that has a short range, high energy and abundant particle emission, one has the potential to deliver a lethal dose of radiation directly to the tumor cell.<br>
Depending on the particle range of the particular isotope, labels may be chosen based on their suitability for targeting a particular type of cell. For instance, gamma emitters are generally used for diagnostic purposes, i.e., visualizing tumors, but are generally ineffective as killing agents. In contrast, alpha and beta emitters may be used to effect cell killing. Alpha emitters may be particularly useful for blood-born diseases or vascular tumors where they can achieve good penetration; although one particle emission in some cases may be enough to effect ceU killing, typically alpha emitter must be located right at the cell surface. In contrast, beta emitters, i.e., '0Y, are particularly suitable for bulkier, more localized disease because they typically have a longer emission range.<br>
Yttrium-90-labeled antibodies and peptides in particular have shown encouraging results in clinical therapy protocols (Thomas et al. 1995. Gamma-interferon administration after ~Y radiolabeled antibody therapy: survival and hemazopoictic toxicity studies. ht. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 31: 529-534; DeNardo et al. 1995. Yttrium-90/Indium-1 11 DOTA peptide chimeric L6~ phannacokinetics, dosimetry and initial therapeutic studies in patients with breast cancer.. J. NucI. Med. 36: 971'). Such conjugates are usually made by coupling a bifunctional chelator to the protein or antibody, then conjugating the radiolabel to the protein construct via the bifunctional chelator. For instance, copending applications 08/475,8 13, 08/475,8 15 and 08/478,967, herein incorporated by reference, describe radiolabeled therapeutic antibodies for the targeting and destruction of B cell lymphon~as and tumor cells. Particularly disclosed is the Y2B8 conjugate, which comprises an anti-human CD2O murine monoclonal antibody, 2B8, attached to '0Y via a bifunctional chelator, MX-DTPA.<br>
Patents relating to chelators and chelator conjugates are known in the art. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,831,175 of Gansow is directed to polysubstituted diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid chelators and protein conjugates containing the same, and methods for their preparation. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,099,069, 5,246,692, 5,286,850, and 5,124,471 of Gansow also relate to polysubstituted <br>
DTPA chelators. As described in Kozak et al., several DTPA chelating agents, including MX-DTPA, have been shown to be suitable for yttrium-monoclonal antibody radioinununotherapy (1989. Nature of the bifunctional chelating agent used for radioimmunotherapy with yttriu.rn-90 monoclonal antibodies: Critical factors in determining in vivo survival and organ toxicity. Cancer Res. 49: 2639-2644). These references are incorporated herein in their entirety.<br>
Yttrium-90 is particularly suited for radioixnmunotherapy and radiopeptide therapy for several reasons. The 64 hour half-life of 'Y is long enough to allow antibody accumulation by the tumor and, unlike e.g., , it is a pure beta emitter of high energy (E max 2.27 MeV) with no accompanying gamma irradiation in its decay. It's particle emission range is 100 to 1000 cell diameters; which is a sufficiently minimal amount of penetrating radiation that outpatient administration would be possible. Furthermore, internalization of labeled antibodies is not required for cell killing, and the local emission of ionizing radiation should be lethal for adjacent tumor cells which might lack the target antigen.<br><br>
However, despite the recognized utility of yttrium-labeled antibodies and the encouraging clinical results with some yttrium-labeled therapeutics, many patients are deprived of the benefit these therapeutics might offer because of the inherent difficulties in conducting both the radiolabeling and administration at a single location. This significant problem is evident in the nearly complete void of kits and products which enable on-site labeling of reagents with alpha and beta emitting radioisotopes, which might otherwise demonstrate the commercial applicability of such technology.<br><br>
The problem with providing kits for radiolabeling and subsequent administration of therapeutics labeled with destructive isotopes appears to be the long-existing belief in the art that, before such therapeutics could be administered to a patient, an extensive purification process was required to remove unbound label so as not to expose the patient to free radioisotope which might accumulate in the bone and other non-target organs. Even those kits currently available for<br>
labeling antibodies with yttrium require a complicated purification step before the therapeutic is ready for administration.<br>
For instance, Antisorna currently offers a kit for radiolabeling :nonoclonal antibody HMFG1 (Theragyn) with ~Y for subsequent administration to patients who have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Au extended phase I-fl study demonstrated that this treatment may be particularly beneficial to patients as a follow-up to conventional surgery and chemotherapy (Hird et al. 1993. Adjuvant therapy of ovarian cancer with radioactive monoclonal antibody. Br. I. Cancer 68:<br>
403-406). Yet Antisoma's labeling method requires removal of unbound label by Sephadex GSO gel filtration, which is a significant deterrent to the Theragyn~ labeling kit achieving commercial success, as well as an obstacle for ensuring that this therapy is readily available for all ovarian cancer patients for whom it might serve to benefit.<br>
The fact that such reagents currently require column purification before administration has been and will continue to be a major deterrent in their availability to all patients who could benefit from such technology unless a simplified method is presented that allows physicians to quickly, efficiently and safely administer such reagents. For instance, a doctor in an outpatient setting does not have the time or I~cilities to purity a reagent by HPLC or gel filtration chromatography before administering the reagent to his patient. This means that additional facilities must be available on site for concurrent production of the reagent and immediate delivery to the doctor, which drastically increases the cost of the therapy and in some cases might require a patient to travel a significant distance to receive the therapy. Alternatively, the drug could be labeled off-site, which would require prior preparation and at least a short-term storage of the therapeutic. This not only has the effect of decreasing the strength of the radioisotope through radioactive decay during storage, but also leads to significant damage to the structural integrity of the protein by overexposure to the radioisotope.<br>
For instance, many reports have discussed the radiolytic nature of ~Y and similar radioisotopes (i.e., Salako et al. 1998. Effects of radiolysis on yttrium-90-labeled Lyrn-1 antibody preparations. J. NucI. Med. 39: 667-670; Chakrabarti et al. 1996: Prevention of radiolysis of monoclonal antibody during labeling. J. NucI. Med. 37: 1384-1388). As noted in Chakrabarti et al., radionuclides such as deliver a large amount of radiation to the antibody during the labeling process as well as during storage. Radiation has reportedly led to instances of significant antibody damage, which can eliminate preferential targeting of tumor cells and expose non-target tissues to significant levels of toxicity.<br>
The mechanism for radiation damage has been attributed to the generation of free radicals (Pizzarello. 1975. Direct and indirect action. In: Pizzarello and Witcofski, eds. Basic Radiation Biolo~v, 2C~ ed. Philadelphia: Lea &amp; Febger, pp. 20-29). But as noted in Salako et al., at an energy of 2.2 MeV, the beta particles emitted from ~Y could easily break most chemical bonds including the disulfide bridges of an antibody, which have a bond strength of only 4.4 eV (Skoog. 1985. PrincipI~s of InstruTr~ental Analysis, 3~ edition. San Francisco: Saunders). Thus, the shorter the amount of time that the protein to be labeled is exposed to destructive radioisotopes such as ~Y, the better the chances will be that the protein will maintain the structural integrity and binding specificity it requires to interact with the target antigen up until the time it is administered and reaches the target site.<br>
The radiolytic nature of ~Y has been known in the art for years and many have tried to solve the problem ~Y presents in the commercial application of these therapeutics. For instance, both Salako et al. and Chakiabarti et al. evaluate the use of rtidioprotectants in '0Y-labeled antibody preparations as a means to decrease damage to the antibody. Salalco et a!. in particular reported that human serum albumin enabled maintenance of KY-labeled antibody inimunoreactivity for up to 72 hours. However, the specific activity exhibited by Salako's preparations was rather low (less than 2 mCiIml). Moreover, neither Salako nor Chakrabarti report<br>
any effort to forego the extensive purification processes required after antibody labeling. Salako et al. labels for a period of 45 minutes to an hour, then purifies the antibody by molecular sieve chromatography, whereas Chakiabarti labels for nearly three hours and purifies by gel filtration chromatography. Neither of these methods will be instrumental in bringing ~Y-labe1ed therapeutics to the out-patient setting.<br><br>
Chinol and Hnatowich were able to achieve 90% radiochemical purity for ~Y-labeled proteins with specific activities ranging from 1-3 mCilmg absent post-labeling purification, using their own generator-produced ~Y (1987. Generator-produced yttrium-90 for radioiinmunotherapy. J. NucI. Med. 28(9): 1465-1470). However, the authors expressly discourage administering preparations having less than 95% purity to patients, and suggest that HPLC may be an important and "possibly essential" step.<br><br>
Those who have recognized that HPLC and other types of purification must be eliminated in the outpatient and hospital setting have not succeeded in developing a sufficient labeling protocol for ~Y such that a high level of label incorporation is achieved and an acceptable level of antibody stability is maintained. If a high level of radioincorporation is not consistently achieved, the patient could be exposed to unacceptable levels of free non-bound radiolabel if this label is not purified away from the reagent. Moreover, again, if antibody structural integrity is damaged such that the antibody loses target specificity, such reagents will not bind specifically to their cognate ligands.<br>
Mather and colleagues set out with the purpose of labeling tumor-specific antibodies with '~Y in a manner such that post-labeling purification could be avoided (1989. Labeling monoclonal antibodies with yttrium-90. Eur. 3. Nuci. Med.. 15: 307-3 12). However, Mather found that high labeling efficiencies (over 95%) could only be achieved at modest specific activities (1 mCi/mg). Moreover, Mather et a!. reports that their antibody preparations showed signs of breakdown (due to radiolysis) after only a few hours. This may be because Mather et al., as<br>
do many others in the field, conducted their labeling reaction over a period of one hour.<br><br>
For example, there have been methods proposed for labelin.g protein reagents with less destructive labels such as 111J~~ which forego additional purification steps. Richardson et a!. propose such a procedure for labeling antibodies with "'In with the goal of facilitating a kit format for diagnostic use (Richardson et a!. 1987. Optimization and batch production of DTPA-labeled antibody kits for routine use in "'In lmmunoscintQgraphy. Nucl. Med. Comm. 8:<br><br>
347-356). Howe\'er, the labeling method proposed in Richardson et al. is conducted over a period of one hour, which might be feasible with "'In which is not very radiolytic, but does not appear to be amenable to ~Y labeling applications as evidenced by the difficulties reported in Mather et a!.<br>
This brings us to the surprising and unexpected advantages of the present invention, which provides invaluable insight into the process of radiolabeling proteins with ~Y which has not been yet been recognized by others in the art. Surprisingly, the present inventors have found that the processes of HPLC or other purification steps that others have long thought to be necessary to achieve pure reagent, and the lengthy incubation times which others have adopted in an effort to increase the specific activity of their reagents, are actually detrimental to the process of preparing '0Y-labeled reagents. Such time-inclusive processes serve only to increase the damage to the protein due to radiolysis, leading to less specificity and an increased rate of protein degradation by the time the radiolabeled protein is ready for injection. Surprisingly, the present inventors have found that efficient labeling with ~Y (&gt;95 % incorporation and at least 15 mCilmg specific activity) can be accomplished in as little as two to five minutes, and in fact such labeling loses its efficiency as reaction times are increased beyond even eight minutes.<br><br>
The fact that labeling with ~Y may now be achieved by the methods of the present invention in as little as two minutes will completely dissolve the current<br>
skepticism in the field toward the applicability of yttrium radiolabeling kits in hospital and outpatient settings. The kits of the present invention will therefor finally satisfy the long felt need that has perhaps been recognized by many cancer patients and doctors alike with regard to the commercial applicability and accessabiity of protein-based, radiolabeled cancer therapeutics.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described.<br>
The present invention includes a method for radiolabeling a chelatorconjugated protein or peptide with a therapeutic radioisotope for administration to a patient comprising (i) mixing the chelator-conjugated protein or peptide with a solution comprising the radioisotope or a salt thereof, and (ii) incubating the mixture for a sufficient amount of time under amiable conditions such that a radiolabeled protein or peptide having sufficient purity, i.e., level of radioincorporation, specific activity and binding specificity is achieved such that the radiolabeled antibody may be administered directly to the patient without further purification. "Further purification" includes HPLC, gel filtration, other types of column chromatography and any other separation tecbnique which is employed with the purpose of removing free or bound unconjugated radiolabel.<br>
The methods of the present invention are particularly applicable to therapeutic radjoisotopes which are typically radiolytic and therefor potentially<br>
dangerous to the structural integrity of the protein. Such therapeutic radioisotopes are generally selected from the group consisting of alpha and beta emitters. Preferred therapeutic radionuclides include 203Pb, z12Pb 212Bi "~~Pd ~Cu, 67Cu, 90Y, "Br, "At, '7Ru, '~Rh, '"Au and 'NAg or '"Lu. Other radionuclides which have therapeutic utility are described in U.S. Patent 5,541,287, herein incorporated by reference. Particularly preferred radionuclides are strong beta radiation emitters which may cause intramolecular decomposition, such as ~Y, 67Cu, '~'i, '"Re and lURe. Although a "therapeutic" radioisotope generally refers to radioisotopes such as beta and gamma emitters which have a cytotoxic affect, to the extent that such radioisotopes may also be used for diagnostic purposes, such purposes do not remove these isotopes from the scope of the present invention because it is the radiolytic nature of these isotopes which renders them suitable for the disclosed methods and kits.<br><br>
The methods of the present invention may be used to label proteins or peptides, particularly those where structural integrity must be maintained for target specificity. Preferred proteins are antibodies or antibody fragments, such as Fab, (Fab)2, and Fv fragments, which recognize tumor specific or tumor-associated antigens. Preferred peptides include somatostatin, vasointestinal peptide (VIP), substance P and others which bind to cellular receptors. Such peptides and chelator-conjugated derivatives of such peptides are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,830,431, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
A "sufficient incubation time" as referenced in the methods of the invention is the acceptable time range during which sufficient radioincorporation and radiochenilcal purity are achieved such that the reagent may be administered directly to a patient without the need for further purification. Sufficient radioincorporation and purity is generally recognized in the art to be at least 95 %, but may vary depending on the toxicity of the label. It should also be apparent to those of skill in the art that the extent of radioincorporation considered to be sufficient is also a function of the desired level of efficacy. For ~Y, and<br>
particularly the ~'Y-labeled antibodies of the present invention, such sufficient time may be generally less than about eight minutes, and more preferably between about two to about five minutes, given an amenable molar ratio of chelator to protein in the chelator-conjugated protein to be labeled.<br><br>
It should be apparent to those of skill in the art that the optimum time required for labeling a specific protein may vary depending on the protein, the particular radiolabel and the particular conjugate employed. An underlying factor in the optimization of the time allotted for radiolabeling is the chelator to protein ratio of the reagent which is to be labeled. For instance, the chelator to protein ratio must be high enough to achieve a therapeutically useful level of incorporation, i.e., 95%, but must also not be too high such that the structural integrity or immunoreactivity of the protein is compromised. This requires a certain balancing process that in some cases may lead to a lower level of conjugated chelator and longer labeling time.<br><br>
For instance, the present inventors have discovered that labeling with ~Y to the desirable level of purity may be accomplished in under five minutes using MXDTPA as a chelator and only about a 1½ to 1 molar ratio of chelator to antibody. Although the chelator to antibody ratio could actually be increased, this was not necessary because a desirable level of radioincorporation and specific activity was achieved after a short labeling period. Given this discovery, parameters such as chelator to protein concentrations could be readily determined by empirical means by those of skill in the art for other proteins and peptides, depending on the therapeutic label of choice, the choice of chelator the number of sites available for chelator attachment, susceptibility of the protein to radiolysis, desired level of efficacy, etc.<br><br>
Any bifunctional chelator may be used in the method of the present invention so long as it is capable of binding to both the protein and radioisotope of interest. Preferred chelators may be selected from the group consisting of MX-<br>
DTPA, phenyl-DTPA, benzyl-DTPA, CHX-DTPA, DOTA and derivatives thereof. A particularly preferred chelator is MX-DTPA.<br><br>
"Amiable conditions" as referenced in the present methods include acceptable temperature, pH and buffer conditions. It should be apparent to those of skill in the art that reaction conditions should not be chosen that are inhibitory or otherwise not conducive to the labeling reaction. Lewis et a!. discusses reaction conditions to be considered when radiolabeling immunoconjugates, and is herein incorporated by reference (1994. A facile, water-soluble method for modification of proteins with DOTA. Use of elevated temperature and optimized pH to achieve high specific activity and high chelate stability in radiolabeled immunoconjugates. Bioconjugate Chem. 5: 565-576).<br>
An acceptable temperature for the reaction may vary depending on the protein to be labeled, but in general ranges from about 250 C to about 430 C. Lewis et a!. have found that increasing the temperature of the radiolabeling reaction from 250C to 430C increased both the efficiency of radiometal incorporation and the kinetic stability of the DOTA radioconjugates examined.<br>
An acceptable pH way vary considerably depending on the radiolabel to be used. The recommended pH for labeling with different radionuclides is generally known in the art and may be chosen accordingly in view of the radioisotope. For instance, for ~Y, an acceptable pH may range from about 3 to about 6, but is more preferably about 4.2.<br>
Acceptable buffers will also vary depending on the particular radiolabel. For instance, Lewis et al. and others have found that the presence of citrate inhibits labeling reactions with ~Y. Thus, citrate buffer would not be appropriate if the ~Y were the chosen radiolabel. When labeling with '0Y, the preferred buffer is an acetate buffer, and more particularly a sodium acetate buffer at a concentration of between about 10 and about 1000 mM.<br><br>
If it does not inhibit or otherwise adversely affect the labeling reaction, it may also be possible for a benign (non-adverse) radioprotectant to be included in<br>
43~ —~3Afr —hj— the reaction buffer. According to Chak.rabarti, ascorbic acid is one such<br><br>
radioprotecta.nt which does not interfere with the labeling process. Caution should be exercised, however, when employing human serum albumin in the labeling reaction due to the presence of metals which would interfere with the labeling process.<br><br>
Because the present invention concerns radiolabeling proteins with particularly radiolytic isotopes, there may be,a certain balance between binding specificity and specific activity that the skilled artisan may encounter when practicing the methods of the present invention. For instance, when specific activity is very high (i.e., suitably over 5 mCi/mg, preferably over 10 mCilmg and more preferably over 15 mCi/mg), a protein construct having the desired binding specificity will have a significant killing capability at the region of the tumor. However, the portion of proteins in the population as a whole which retain their immunoreactivity may be lower than a population having a lower specific activity due to radiolysis of the radiolabel. Depending on the desired level of specific activity, the skilled artisan may choose to compromise a certain level of immunoreactivity.<br>
For instance, the present inventors have found that, with ~Y, when an antibody is labeled to a specific activity of about 15 mCi/mg, the binding specificity or immunoreactivity of the protein is generally at least about 70%. This of course may vazy depending on the sensitivity of the antibody and the radiolytic nature of the radioisotope employed, and may be manipulated by the skillet~ artisan if a higher level of immunoreactivity or specific activity is desired. The present inventors have achieved specific activities with ~Y of up to about 20 mCi/mg. Binding specificities of at least 50% are desirable for therapeutic applications.<br>
	Copending applications 09/	and 09/	, co-owned and<br><br>
submitted concurrently herewith, disclose binding assays which may be used to assess the percent binding affinity and ixnmunoreactivity of conjugates after<br>
labeling if desirable. It should be stressed that, although no further purification is<br><br>
required after the labeling methods of the present invention, a TLC-based assay to verify the level of radjoincorporation should always be performed so as not to jeopardize the health of the patient. Such an assay can be performed in about 3-4 minutes, and should not significantly affect the stability or efficacy of the radiotherapeutic.<br>
The present invention also includes kiZs for radiolabeling a chelatorconjugated protein or peptide with a therapeutic radioisotope for administration to a patient comprising (i) a vial_containing chelator-conjugated protein or peptide, (ii) a vial containing formulation buffer for stabilizing and administering the radiolabeled antibody to a patient, and (iii) instructions for performing the radiolabeling procedure, such that when the chelator-conjugated protein or peptide is exposed to the radioisotope or a salt thereof for a sufficient amount of time under amiable conditions as recommended in said instructions and described further above, a radiolabeled protein or peptide having sufficient purity, specific activity and binding specificity is achieved such that the radiolabeled antibody may be diluted to an appropriate concentration in said formulation buffer and administered direcdy to the patient without further purification. Said chelatorconjugated protein or peptide may be supplied in lyophiized form.<br>
It should be understood that the kits of the present invent are designed to accomplish the methods described herein and may therefor be used for that purpose. Accordingly, it should be apparent to those concerned when reading the invention that the kit instructions will be based on the methods described above, and that the considerations addressed above have the same relevance and meaning when considered in view of the kit embodiment. Additionally, it should be apparent upon reading the disclosure as a whole that alternative kit embodiments are encompassed in the present invention which may contain components such as an acetate buffer for adjusting the pH of the radiolabel as described above.<br>
A particularly advantageous component of the kit is the formulation buffer for stabilizing against the effects of radiolysis and administering the radiolabeled conjugated antibody to a patient. The formulation buffer is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which serves as both a diluent for the labeled antibody and an administration buffer. Although any pharmaceutically acceptable diluent may be used for administering therapeutic or diagnostic antibodies to patient, the formulation buffer of the present invention is particularly suited for administering radiolabeled antibodies.<br><br>
For instance, the formulation buffer of the present invention comprises a radioprotectant such as human serum albumin (HSA) or ascorbate, which minimize radiolysis due to yttrium and other strong radionuclides. Other radioprotectants are known in the art and could also be used in the formulation buffer of the present invention, i.e., free radical scavengers (phenol, sulfites, glutathione, cysteine, gentisic acid, nicotinic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, HQP(:O)H2, glycerol, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, Na1S2O5, Na2S1O3, and SO~, etc.).<br><br>
The formulation buffer of the present invention also comprises excess unconjugated chelator. The purpose for including unconjugated chelator is that this chelator serves to scavenge any non-protein bound radiolabel in the patient, and causes excretion of the radiolabel thereby reducing uptake of "bone-seeking" isotopes, i.e., ~'Y, by the bones of the patient. For instance, when the antibody of the kit is conjugated to a DTPA chelator, excess DTPA or any other chelator may be included in the formulation buffer. The f'rmation buffer is also preferably supplied in a volume such that the entire contents are transferred to the reaction vial. As discussed above, this results in increased ease of use and reproducibility because exact volumes do not have to be measured and transferred.<br>
A preferred formulation buffer comprises phosphate buffered or physiological saline, human serum albumin and DTPA. The human serum albumin is preferably at a concentration of between about 5 to 25% (w/v), and more preferably at a concentration of about 7.5% (w/v). The concentration of<br>
DTPA is preferably about 1 mM. Ascorbate may be used as an alternative to human serum albumin, and is typically used at a concentration of about I to 10(1) rng/ml. Although a wider range of concentrations may be used without compromising patient safety.<br>
The kit may be supplied in other alternative embodiments depending on the preferences of the purchaser. For instance, the kit may further comprise a sterile reaction vial in which the labeling reaction and dilution into formulation buffer may both be performed. Further embodiments are envisioned whereby the buffer for adjusting the pH of the radiolabel is supplied in the actual reaction vial to cut down on waste. Also envisioned are kits which further comprise a vial of radioisotope, although it may be more feasible to order the labeling kit in advance and order the radioisotope separately at a later time just before administration. Also envisioned are kits which comprise a vial of secondary protein or peptide to serve as either a control in assessing the binding affinity of the radiolabeled product, or in some cases to be employed in a combined therapeutic regimen with the radiolabeled protein or peptide.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
A KY-labeled murine monoclonal anti-CD2O antibody (Y2B8) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treabnent of relapsed B-cell lytnphoma. The 2B8 antibody is a murine antibody which recognizes human CD2O. The chimeric version of this antibody (Rituxan) has recently received FDA approval for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. U.S. Application Serial No. 08/475,8 13, herein incorporated by reference, discloses sequential administration of R.iruxan• with yttrium-labeled murine monoclonal antibody in a combined therapeutic regimen, wherein administration of the yttrium-labeled anti-C D20 antibody following administration of Rituxan• is sufficient to (a) clear any remaining peripheral blood B cells not cleared by the chimeric anti-CD2O<br><br>
antibody; (b) begin B cell depletion from lymph nodes; or (c) begin B cell depletion from bther tissues.<br><br>
Thus, given the proven efficacy of an anti-CD2O antibody in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the known sensitivity of lymphocytes to radioactivity, it would be highly advantageous for such therapeutic antibodies to become commercially available in kit form whereby they may be readily modified with a radiolabel and administered directly to the patient in the clinical setting.<br><br>
A radiolabeling kit for the 2B8 antibody is preferably comprised of four components: 1.) 2B8-MX-DTPA in low-metal normal saline at 2 mg/mL, 2.) 50 mM sodium acetate used to adjust radioisotope solution to appropriate labeling pH, 3.) formulation buffer (IX PBS, pH 7.4 containing 7.5% human serum albumin and 1 mM DTPA), and optionally, 4.) an empty 10 wL glass vial (reaction viai)(a "10 mL" reaction vial actually holds 10 mL comfortably, and is technically somewhat larger than "10 mL"). All components are tested to be sterile and pyrogen-free.<br>
This section summarizes the validation of this radiolabeling kit which is simple and easy to use and which yields radiolabeled antibodies with ~95 % radio incorporation and acceptable retention of binding to antigen-positive cells. An evaluation of experimental parameters affecting binding and radioincorporation was also conducted.<br>

D.	~311I~<br>
Reproducibility and ruggedness of the radiolabeling protocols for Y2B8 was evaluated by performing several validation runs using different lots of each radioisotope. Six validation lots each of Y2B8 were prepared by five operators. These lots were designated as follows and performed at the following facilities:<br><br>
#1: IDEC Pharmaceuticals<br><br>
#2: IDEC Pharmaceuticals<br>
IDEC Pharmaceuticals<br>
MD Anderson Health Center<br><br>
Mayo Clinic<br>
City of Hope<br>
The results of testing on each validation lot are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Release Assay Results for Y2B8 Validation<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
For the six validation lots prepared, the percent binding obtained was in the ranged from 78.6% to 87.0% with a mean of 82.3%. Radioincorporation values for Y2B8 averaged 98.8% (range of 96.3% to 99.5%). Together, these results confirm the reproducibility and ruggedness of the radiolabeling kit methods for preparation of Y2B8, and together indicate that Y2B8 prepared using this radiolabeling kit are suitable for use in the clinical setting.<br><br>
Example 2. Initial Evaluation of the Reaction Parameters - pH and reaction time<br>
Kinetic studies were initially performed to evaluate the radioincorporation and binding of the MY-labeled antibody (Y2B8) following labeling reactions performed under varying conditions of pH and reaction tune. For radiolabeling reactions in the rax.~ge of pH 3.9 to 4.7 at an incubation time of 5 mm, radioincorporation was<br>
&gt;96% with &gt;80% retention of binding to CD2O-positive cells (Table 2). Similar results were obtained for incubation times of 3. 5, and 10 mm for the range of p1-I 2.9 to 4.6 (Table 3).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>

Table 3. YZB8 Radlolabeling Kinetics: Effect of Incubation Time on Radloincorporatlon and Binding to CDZO-Positive Cells'<br><br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The labeling reaction results and parameter evaluation studies reported in Tables 2 and 3 were performed with 2B8 derived from a CHO cell expression system; The MX-DTPA conjugate was prepared using a protocol similar to that used for the previously characterized 2B849. Reactions were performed using approximately 3 mg of antibody and a 4; 1 molar ratio of chelator to antibody as described in co-owned, copending Application Serial No. 091....., concurrently filed and herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Iinmunoreactivities for Y2B8 preparations were determined using the method of Lindmo et al. Increasing amounts of freshly harvested CD2O-positive SB cells were incubated with a fixed amount of Y2B8 under conditions of antigen excess. Reciprocal plot analysis of the binding data showed an immunoreactivity of 72.2% for Y2B8 following one trial preparation (Figure 1).<br>
Example 3. Evaluation of further reaction parameters<br><br>
Experiments described in this section examine the impact of protocol deviations on the binding of Y2B8 prepared using the Y2B8 Radiolabeling Kit. Binding of a radiolabeled antibody may be affected by several parameters during the radiolabeling process (Table 4).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The following deviations from the radiolabeling protocol were identified as chose most likely to have a negative impact on binding, and included: 1.) addition of a lesser volume of sodium acetate 2.) addition of excess ~Y chloride solution 3.) addition of a lesser volume of 2B8-MX DTPA and 4.) exceeding the maximum reaction incubation time. The impact of these deviations was evaluated separately and simultaneously.<br>
When evaluated separately, 20% volume deviations in items 1 - 3 above resulted in LDEC-Y2B8 passing the release specification established for binding in the clinical trial, even when incubated for 8 win. In a study where all three volume deviations (1 - 3 above) were made simultaneously, only doses prep~±red using a Monday labeling protocol (potentially the most radiolytic) and incubated for 8 miri. (60% longer than normal) were marginally below (
release specification. In contrast, doses prepared using a Friday labeling protocol maintained acceptable binding results, despite the cumulative effects of deviations in all four parameters (1 -4 above). For all deviations, separately and collectively, radioincorporacion was above the clinical release specification of<br>
95%.<br>
II.	Choice of Parameters<br>
We decided that a 20% deviation from the required reagent volumes, or allowing the reaction time to exceed by 30% the maximum 6 mi.n. used normally, represented potentially extreme deviations from the protocol used in the radiopharmacy. In this study we evaluate the impact of these deviations on the binding of IDEC-Y2B8. We simulated "Monday" and "Friday" labelings to insure that the conditions evaluated represented extremes of dose preparation for the entire week. We also evaluated the combined effect on binding when all deviations occur in a single dose preparation, and the impact of these deviations on radjoincorporation of the '0Y.<br><br>
"Monday" and "Friday" labelings are a reflection of the concept that, since the ~Y chloride solution has a short half-life (64 hr), the volume of the radioisotope used depends on the day of the week a dose is prepared. For this reason, the reaction volume for a dose prepared on a Monday is smaller, resulting in higher a '0Y concentration, possibly resulting in greater radiolysis. Therefore, we simulated Monday and Friday labeling procedures to insure that the conditions evaluated represented extremes of dose preparation for the entire week.<br><br>

1.	Preparation of Y2BS<br>
In general, '0Y-labeled 2B8-MX-DTPA was prepared using a small-scale version of the radiolabeling kit protocol described above as modified by the changes described below. Radiolabeling was performed using ~~'Y chloride stock concentrations of 84 mCi/niL or 29.8 mCi/niL to simulate, respectively, Monday or Friday dose preparations (based on a Wednesday calibration of 50 inC iImL).<br><br>
The concentrated ~Y chloride solution was diluted using 50 mM HC1 (Ultrex, high-purity) in plastic "metal-free" microfuge tubes. The Ultrex (high-purity) HCl was diluted to 50 mM with Sterile Water for Irrigation (SWFI). Radiolabeling reactions were performed in plastic "metaifree" microfuge tubes, 15 niL conical tubes, or 10 mL glass septum Reaction Vial provided in the Y2B8 Radiolabeling Kit.<br><br>
a.	Sma~l-Sc~Ie Labeling to Predict Full-Scale Dose Preparaticin~ Radiolabeling reactions of 1, 3, 10, and 40 mCi were performed using<br>
reaction conditions simulating a Monday dose preparation. Reagent volumes in niLs for each reaction are summarized in Table 5.<br><br>
Table 5. Volume of Reagents (niL)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
After a S nun. incubation, 20 ML samples were removed and diluted with Formulation buffer to a final antibody concentration of 0.21 mgimL and stored at 2~8o C until assayed. Binding values were normalized to the I mCi reaction because 1 mCi reactions were used as controls in all subsequent experiments described in this report. Values reported were nornialized to the I mCi control sample by dividing the binding value for each reaction by the bimling value for the control, expressed as a percntage.<br>
b.	Impact of Adding Volume of Sodium Acetate<br><br>
For a Monday labeling, 10 m(i of~Y chloride (0.119 m.L) was mixed with 0.114 m.L of 50 mM sodium acetate. This volume of 50 mM sodium acetate represents a 20% decrease in the amount of buffer normally used to prepare clinical doses of IDEC-Y2B8. Conjugated antibody (2B8-MX-DTPA) was added (0.333 niL), the sample mixed and then incubated at ambient temperature. Specific activity of the radiolabeling solution was 18.9 mCi/mg antibody. At 2 ruin., 0.020 niL was removed, formulated to 0.24 nig/znL with formulation buffer, and stored at 2~8a C. The remainder of the radiolabeling solution was formulated. after 8 ruin., to 0.24 mg/niL and stored at 2~8~ C. The protocol was repeated to simulate a Friday labeling, using 0.336 mL of'0Y chloride, 0.323 mL of sodium acetate, and 0.333 rnL of 2B8-MX-DTPA. For both studies, the I mCi control reaction was performed using the "standard" conditions described above (5 mm. reaction).<br><br>
c.	Impact of A4ding Excess Volume of ~Y Chloride<br>
For a Monday labeling, 12 mCi of '~'Y chloride (0.143 niL) mixed with 0.143 niL of 50mM sodium acetate. This volume of~Y represents a 20% increase in the amount of ~Y required for a typical dose preparation of Y2B8. Conjugated antibody was added and the sample solution mixed and incubated at ambient temperature. The final specific activity was 22.5 mCi/mg antibody. At 2 min., 0.020 niL was removed, formulated to 0.24 mg/niL with formulation buffer, and stored at 2-8w C. After 8 win., the remainder of the radiolabeling solution was formulated to 0.24 mg/niL and stored at 2.80 C. Friday labeling was performed similarly using 0.403 niL of '0Y chloride, 0.403 niL of 50 mM sodium acetate, and 0.333 niL of 2B8-MX-DTPA (specific activity 22.5 mCi/mg antibody). For both studies, a I mCi control reaction was performed using the "standard" conditions described above (5 nila. reaction).<br>
d.	Impact of Adding Less Volume of Antibody Coniugate<br><br>
For a Monday labeling, 10 mCi of ~Y chloride (0.119 niL) was mixed with 0.143 niL SO ruM sodium acetate. Conjugated antibody (0.267 niL) was added, representing 20% less antibody than normally used, the solution mixed and incubated at ambient temperature. At 2 and 8 nun., 0.020 niL was removed, formulated with Formulation buffer to a final antibody concentration of 0.21 mg/niL, and stored at 2-8w C until assayed. A Friday labeling was performed similarly using 0.336 niL ~Y chloride, 0.403 niL of 50 mM sodium acetate, and 0.27 niL conjugate. For both studies, a I mCi control reaction was performed using the "standard" conditions described above (5 mm. reaction)~~<br><br>
e.	Impact of Combined Reagent Deviations<br>
The impact of a 20% deviation in volume of sodium acetate, ~~'Y chloride, and conjugate was assessed simultaneously for a Monday or a Friday labeling protocol. For a Monday labeling, 12 mCi of '~Y (0.143 niL) was mixed with 0.114 niL 50 mM sodium acetate, representing a 20% increase in the amount of ~Y chloride and a 20% decrease in the amount of sodium acetate normally used. 2B8-MX-DTPA (0.267 niL), representing 20% less antibody than normally used, was added and the reaction mixture incubated at ambient temperature. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 miii., 0.020 niL was removed from the reaction mixture, formulated with Formulation buffer to a final antibody concentration of 0.21 mghnL, and stored at 2~8o C until assayed. Friday labeling was performed similarly using 0.403 ruL ~Y chloride, 0.387 niL of sodium acetate, and 0.267 niL of conjugate; 40 ML samples were removed at the indicated times and formulated with Formulation buffer. For both studies, a 1 mCi control reaction was performed using the "standard" conditions described above (5 nun. reaction).<br>
The amount of radioactivity associated with the conjugates was determined according to the assay described above, using the commercially available kit manufactured by Biodex (Tec-Control Radiochroniatographic Kit). In general, 0.5<br><br>
- I Ad.. samples were applied to duplicate strips using a micropipetter and developed according to the Biodex instructional insert. Strip halves were counted for radioactivity in glass tubes using an Isodata gamma counter with window to 100 - 1000 KeV. The radiolabel incorporatio~i was calculated by dividing the amounL of radioactivity in the top half of the strip by the total radioactivity found in both top and bottom halves. This value was expressed as a percentage and the mean value determined.<br>
3.	Determination of Binding<br>
Samples were analyzed for percent binding to CD2O positive cells following the protocol described above. However, the negative control HSB Cell samples were not included in these experuncnts, and the SB Cells were lyophilized in 5 Wi vials instead of inicrofuge tubes.<br>
Essentiaily, all final formulated Y2B8 samples were diluted 1:100 with Dilution buffer (10.0 ML antibody + 990 [.uL buffer). The antibody was subsequently diluted again to an approximate concentration ranging of 8 ng/mL by adding 35 ML of the 1:100 dilution to 10 niL of dilution buffer in a 50 mL polypropylene tube.<br>
Six to seven vials of lyophilized cells were reconstituted with SWFI and pooled in a 50 niL conical tube. Reconstituted cells (0.5 niL) were then aliquoted out in triplicate into three 1.5 ml.. microfuge tubes, three tubes per sample being tested. Dilution buffer (0.5 Wi) was added to three empty rnicrofuge tubes. Diluted antibody (0.5 niL) was added to each tube, capped tightly, and incubated at ambient temperature for 45 mm. with end-over-end mixing. After incubation, ceUs were pelleted by ceutrifugation for 5 nun, at a setting of "6" (4000 X g) using a Savant microcentrifuge. Supernatants from the samples (0.75 niL) were <br>
transferred to 12 X 75 mm glass tubes for radioactivity counting using an Isodata gamma counter with energy window settings of 100 - 1000 KeV.<br>
Radioactivity bound (B) to cells was calculated by subtracting the unbound radioactivity (supernat.ant) from the total radioactivity added. Total radioactivity was determined from the radioactivity counted in the tubes without ceUs. Percent binding was calculated by expressing the bound radioactivity as a percentage of th~ total.<br>
To minimize the effect of lot-to-lot 'variability of lyophilized cells used to assess binding, binding values were normalized to 1 mCi Y2B8 controls prepared using "standard" labeling conditions. Control samples were prepared, as stated earlier in this section, for each set of experiments.<br>
1.	Small-Scale Labeling to Predict Full-Scale Dose Preparations<br>
To insure that small-scale radiolabeling reactions were predictive of full-scale (40 mCi) dose preparations, 1, 3, 10, and 40 mCi Y2B8 doses were prepared using the radiolabeling protocols described above. These results are shown in Table 6 and demonstrate that increasing the scale of the reaction mixture from 1 mCi to 40 mCi dose not adversely affect binding or radioincorporation.<br>
Table 6<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2.	Impact of Adding L~ss Volume of Sodium Acetate<br><br>
When Y2B8 was prepared using 20% less volume of 50 mM sodium acetate, and extending the incubation time by 60%, substantial binding was retained, compared to the radiolabeled antibody prepared following "standard" labeling conditions (Table 7 below). Even when the labeling reaction was performed using Monday labeling conditioas, &gt; 89% of the control binding was retained. Similar results were obtained for a Friday dose preparation. These deviations did not impact radioincorporation, regardless of the day the dose was prepared.<br><br>
3.	Impact of Adding Excess Volume of ~Yttrium Chloride<br>
When Y2B8 was prepared using a 20% excess volume of ~Y chloride, in combination with an incubation time 60% longer than that used normally, substantial binding was retained) when compared to the control prepared according to "standard" labeling conditions (Table 7 below). When the labeling reaction was increased to 8 miii., binding still remained &gt; 90%, relative to the control, for either a Monday or a Friday dose preparation. Adding 20% more volume of ~Y chloride did not impact radioincorporation, regardless of the day the dose was prepared.<br><br>
4.	Impact of Adding Less volume of Antibody Conjugate<br><br>
When Y2B8 was prepared using a 20% less volume of the conjugate (2B8-MX-DTPA), and extending the incubation time by 60% ,binding was not significantly affected, compared to Y2B8 prepared according to "standard" labeling conditions (Table 7 below). Adding 20% less volume of conjugate did not impact radiouncorporation, regardless of the day the dose was prepared.<br>

5. Impact of Combined Reagent Deviations<br><br>
When Y2B8 was prepared using a protocol in which all four deviations were made simultaneously, binding was still substantially maintained, compared to the radiolabeled antibody prepared using "standard" labeling conditions (Table 8 below). Binding was still&gt; 83%, even when a Monday preparation was incubated for 30% longer than the maximum 6 mm. used normally. Radioincorporation was not affected significantly by these cumulative deviations, even after an 8 min. incubation time, regardless of the day the dose was prepared.<br>
Table 8<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
V. Discussion<br>
To reduce radiation exposure to operators, smaller labeling reactions were<br><br>
evaluated instead of full-scale dose preparations. Therefore, we verified that the<br>
1 mCi and 10 mCi labelings, evaluated in this study, were predictive of full-scale<br>
40 mCi preparations. Results demonstrated no significant differences in binding<br>
and radioincorporation over a range of 1 mCi to 40 mCi.<br>
We decided that 20% volume errors for sodium acetate, ~Y chloride, and conjugated antibody represented potentially extreme deviations in the radiolabeling protocol. Additionally incubating for 8 min. (3 mm. longer than normal) was viewed as a significant protocol deviation. In general, due to the short half life of ~Y chloride, the volume of radioisotope will differ depending on the day of the<br>
dose preparation. Therefore, experiments described in this report were performed using ~Y chloride at concentrations representative of both Monday and Friday to represent the full range of possible dose preparation.<br><br>
Y2B8 doses prepared using 20% lesser volume of sodium acetate, and incubated for 8 inin. retained significant binding (&gt; 89%) relative to the standard labeling conditions. Similar results were obtained for doses prepared Monday or Friday. This deviatioz~ in sodium acetate volume did not affect radioincorporation.<br><br>
Adding 20% more volume of soY chloride, and incubating for up to 8 mm., reduced binding, relative to standard dose preparation conditions, for both Monday and Friday. However, binding was still &gt; 90%, which is above the normalized release specification. Binding was marginally better for a Friday dose preparation. Radioincorporation was not significantly affected by the increased volume of ~Y chloride.<br><br>
To evaluate the impact of making simultaneously all volume deviations, Monday and Friday doses were prepared comparing 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm. incubation times. Only when Y2B8 was prepared on a Monday, using an 8 mm. incubation time, does the binding marginally fail to meet the normalized specification (83.2% compared to the normalized release specification of 86.3 %).<br>
