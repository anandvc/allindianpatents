The following specification describes the invention:<br><br>
AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR OXIDATION OF THIOETHER<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 2-[(pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl-substituted benzimidazoles of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or solvate thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to the process for oxidation of 2-[(pyridinyl)methyl}thio-substituted benzimidazoles of Formula (II). The present invention further relates to the process for preparing enantioselective synthesis of the single enantiomers of 2-[(pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl-substituted benzimidazoles of Formula (I) a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or solvate thereof in an enantiomerically enriched form.<br>

Background and Prior art:<br>
There are a large number of patents and patent applications disclosing different substituted 2-(2-pyridinylmethylsulphinyl)-lH-benzimidazoles. This class of compounds has properties making the compounds useful as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion and generally known as proton pump inhibitors.<br>
For example the compound (5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl) methyl]sulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole), with the generic name omeprazole, is described in EP 5129. It is marketed under the brand name Prilosec® for treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and GERD; maintenance of healing of errosive esophagitis, and long term treatment of pathological hyperscretory conditions<br>
Rabeprazole is another compound of the same class and chemically known by 2-[[[(4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-2-methyl-2-pyridinyl]methyl]sulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles. It was reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5045552 and marketed in the United States under the brand name Aciphex® for healing of erosive or ulcerative GERD, maintenance of healing of GERD and treatment of symptomatic GERD.<br>
2<br><br>
Pantoprazole is the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical product that is marketed in<br>
the United States by Wyeth-Ayerst Inc. under the brand name Protonix®. Pantoprazole is<br>
chemically	represented	(5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-<br>
pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-lH-b- enzimidazole. Pantoprazole useful for short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.<br>
Lansoprazole another compound represented by 2-[[[3-methyl-4(2,2,2,-triflouroethoxy)-2-pyridiyl]methyl]sulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole and reported in U.S Patent No. 4628098. It is marketed under the brand name Prevacid® for short-term treatment of duodenal ulcer, H. Pylori eradication to prevent recurrence of duodenal ulcer and maintenance of healed duodenal ulcers.<br>
These compounds as well as structurally related sulphoxides, have a stereogenic centre at the sulphur atom and thus exist as two optical isomers, i.e. enantiomers. If there is another stereogenic centre in the molecule, these compounds can exist as pairs of enantiomers. Corresponding sulphides of such compounds which already contain a stereogenic centre are not pro-chiral compounds, but chiral compounds. However, the sulphur atom in these compounds does not have asymmetry and therefore they are referred to as pro-chiral sulphides in respect of this invention.<br>
Even though this class of chiral sulphoxides has been discussed in the scientific literature since the late seventies, there is not yet any efficient asymmetric process described for the synthesis of the single enantiomers thereof. The single enantiomers of pharmacologically active compounds have met an increased interest in the last years because of improved pharmacokinetic and biological properties. Therefore, there is a demand and need for an enantioselective process that can be used in large scale for the manufacture of the single enantiomers of pharmacologically active compounds, such as for instance optically pure, substituted 2-(2-pyridinylmethylsulphinyl)-1 H-benzimidazoles.<br>
The preparation of 2-[(pyridinyl]methyl]sulfinyl-susbstituted benzimidazoles of Formula (I) by oxidation of compound of Formula (II) is generally known and is discussed in U.S. patent Nos. 5045552, 4508905 and 4628098.<br>

Various methods employing various different oxidants to perform this oxidation are known. For example, Canadian Patent No. 1,263,119 describes the use of hydrogen peroxide over a vanadium catalyst (such as vanadium pentoxide, sodium vanadate and vanadium acteylacetonate). Canadian Patent No. 1,127,158 similarly describes the use of peracids, peresters, ozone, etc. European Patent Application, Publication No. 533,264 describes the use of magnesium monoperoxyphthalate as the oxidizing agent. PCT Publication No. W091/18895 describes the use of m-chloroperoxy benzoic acid as the oxidizing agent. GB Pat. No. 2,069,492 generally describes this acid and other peroxy acids in the oxidation of substituted (phenylthiomethyl)pyridines.<br>
According to example 32 of 505552, thioether is oxidized by using 0.96 equivalent (on a purity basis) of m-chloroperbenzoic acid, to produce sulfoxide at a yield of 80%, which is not an industrially satisfactory yield. Depending on the reaction conditions, disadvantageously, the reaction does not ceased at the stage of sulfoxide production but further proceeds to a side reaction where a part of the produced sulfoxide is furthermore oxidized to sulfone as shown below. When sulfone is formed, there is a problem not only that the yield of the objective sulfoxide is reduced, but also that is difficult to separate and purify them, since there is a close resemblance in physicochemical property between the two. Additionally, the oxidation is conducted in dichloromethane (methylene chloride), but from a viewpoint of environmental strategies and regulatory aspects, use of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents is preferably avoided.Moreover, m-chloroperbenzoic acid is expensive, it is extremely disadvantageous from a viewpoint of the production cost.<br>

US 5374730 relates to omeprazole and lansoprazole, in particular, two novel synthetic methods for their preparation. According to the process, amide analogues of the thioether compounds are oxidized to the corresponding sulfinyl compounds by using hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing agent.<br>
US 6313303 Bl discloses the process for preparing Rabeprazole, Lansoprazole and other related compounds by oxidation thioether precursor compound with N-halosuccinimide, l,3-dihalo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin or dichloroisocyanurate in the presence of a base.<br>
Accordingly, use of base in the oxidation process is essential. However, the isolation of the desired compound is tedious and costlier.<br>
There has been a long felt need for efficient and safe methods for the selective oxidation of thioether compound of formula (II)<br>

To the solution of 2-({[4-(2-methoxyethoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl]methyl}thio)-l#-benzimidazole (20g, 1 mole) in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL, 5 times), process water (25 mL, 1.25 times) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes at 25°C to 35°C. Cool the reaction mixture to -5°C to -10°C. N-Chlorosuccinimide (10. 1g, 1.3 moles) is added into the reaction mixture within 15-20 minutes and the reaction mixture is stirred 5-10 minutes at -5°C to -10°C. Methylene dichloride (100 mL) is added to the reaction mixture followed by addition of sodium thiosulphate solution (2.5g in 25 mL). The pH of the reaction mass is adjusted between 10 to 12 by adding 2% sodium hydroxide solution (2g in 100 mL). The aqueous layer and organic layer are separated. The aqueous layer thus obtained is adjusted to pH 8 to 9 by adding ammonium acetate solution. Methylene dichloride (60 mL) is added to above reaction mixture and stirred for 15 minutes. The separated organic layer is treated with charcoal and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is filtered through celite bed and washed with methylene dichloride. The filtrate thus obtained is reduced upto 20-30 mL under reduced pressure. The filtrate thus obtained is added dropwise in n-heptane to isolate the product at 25°C to 35°C. The product thus obtained is stirred for 30 minutes at same temperature and cooled to 5°C to 10°C and stir for 1 hour. The reaction mass is filtered and washed with n-heptane, dried under vacuum at 25°C to 35°C to give 2-({[4-(2-methoxyethoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl]methyl}sulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole i.e. crude rabeprazole free base. Purification:<br>
The solution of crude rabeprazole free base (16 g) in isopropyl alcohol (80 mL) is taken in round bottom flask and stirred for 30 minutes at 38°C to 42°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to 25°C to 35°C and stirred for 30 minutes at same temperature. The reaction mixture is further cooled to 5°C to 10°C and is stirred for 1 hour at the same temperature.
