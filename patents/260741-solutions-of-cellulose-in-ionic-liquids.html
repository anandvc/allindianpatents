Solutions of cellulose in ionic liquids<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a solution comprising cellulose and an ionic liquid as solvent, a process for preparing it and its use.<br>
Cellulose is a very versatile raw material. In the textile industry, cellulose is, for example, the most important constituent of fiber raw materials, in particular of cotton.<br>
Cellulose can be used unchanged or after physical or chemical treatment. In the latter two cases, it is advantageous for cellulose to be in preferably completely dissolved form in a solvent. However, cellulose is insoluble in most solvents.<br>
Cellulose is soluble as a copper chelate complex in some copper solutions. Regenerated cellulose can be obtained by precipitation of the cellulose. However, such copper solutions are not very suitable as solvents for cellulose in the case of physical or chemical treatment of the cellulose.<br>
For this reason, the systems known, inter alia, as ionic liquids in the literature were proposed very early on as solvents for cellulose.<br>
Thus, US-A 1,943,176 describes the dissolution of cellulose in benzylpyridinium chloride.<br>
As an example of an ionic liquid, benzylpyridinium chloride is a salt which is present in molten form and thus as a liquid at comparatively low temperatures.<br>
Ionic liquids are becoming increasingly important as solvents, e.g. for carrying out chemical reactions. Peter Wasserscheidt, Angew. Chem. 2000, 112, 3926-3945, for example, gives an overview of the use of ionic liquids in transition metal catalysis.<br>
B05/0198PG IB/EBU/cd<br><br>
Ionic liquids which are present in the liquid state even at room temperature are described, for example, by K.N. Marsh et al., Fluid Phase Equilibria 219 (2004), 93-98, and J.G. Huddleston et al., Green Chemistry 2001, 3, 156-164.<br>
DE-A 102 02 838 describes the use of ionic liquids for separating acids from chemical mixtures.<br>
Owing to the good solvent capabilities of ionic liquids, their use for the dissolution of cellulose is also proposed in the more recent international patent application WO-A 03/029329. However, it is emphasized there that the ionic liquids should comprise cations which comprise a quaternary ammonium ion which should be quaternized by alkyl groups, in particular methyl.<br>
Although the characteristics of the cellulose-comprising solution and its preparation described in WO-A 03/029329 have good results, there is a need to provide improved solutions.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a solution of dissolved cellulose which displays improved properties.<br>
The object is achieved by a solution comprising cellulose and an ionic liquid comprising anions and cations as solvent, wherein the cations comprise at least one atom selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus which is present in protonated form.<br>
It has been found that the preparation of cations by means of hydrogen (protonation), in particular by quaternization of the nitrogen, can result in improved properties. In particular, it has been found that solutions comprising ionic liquids are easier to work up. Thus, the ionic liquids can be converted by addition of a base into a distillable form, which makes them easier to separate off.<br>
The protonation can be effected at one or more identical or different heteroatoms (N, O, S, P). Apart from generation of a positive charge by protonation, further positive charges can also be present in the cations, for example as a result of alkylation of a nitrogen.<br>
B05/0198PC<br><br>
However, the cations preferably have at least one nitrogen atom which is present in protonated form as ammonium cation.<br>
The cellulose to be dissolved can originate from, for example, regenerated cellulose, fibrous cellulose, wood fibers, lint, cotton or paper.<br>
It is preferred that, in the solution of the present invention, more than 1% by weight of cellulose, based on the total weight of the solution, are completely dissolved. More preferably, more than 3% by weight, particularly preferably more than 5% by weight and in particular at least 7% by weight, based on the total weight of the solution, are completely dissolved.<br>
Advantageously, up to 35% by weight of cellulose, based on the total weight of the solution, can be completely dissolved. Furthermore, up to 25% by weight of cellulose, based on the total weight of the solution, can be completely dissolved. Solutions in which up to 15% by weight of cellulose are completely dissolved are especially suitable for particular applications.<br><br><br><br>
The ionic liquids preferably have a melting point of less than 180°C. The melting point is more preferably in the range from -50°C to 150°C, still more preferably in the range from -20°C to 120°C and most preferably below 100°C.<br>
Compounds which are suitable for forming the cations [A]+ of ionic liquids are, for<br>
example, known from DE 102 02 838 A1, Thus, such compounds can comprise oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur or in particular nitrogen atoms, for example at least one nitrogen atom, preferably 1-10 nitrogen atoms, particularly preferably 1-5 nitrogen atoms, very particularly preferably 1-3 nitrogen atoms and in particular 1-2 nitrogen atoms. If appropriate, further heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur or phosphorus atoms can also be comprised. The nitrogen atom is a suitable carrier of the positive charge in the cation of the ionic liquid, from which a proton or an alkyl radical can then be transferred in equilibrium to the anion so as to produce an electrically neutral molecule.<br>
If the nitrogen atom is the carrier of the positive charge in the cation of the ionic liquid, a cation can firstly be produced by quaternization of the nitrogen atom of, for example, an amine or nitrogen heterocycle in the synthesis of the ionic liquids. The quaternization can be effected by protonation of the nitrogen atom. Depending on the protonation reagent used, salts having different anions are obtained. In cases in which<br>
B05/0198PC<br><br>
it is not possible to form the desired anion directly in the quaternization, this can be effected in a further step of the synthesis. For example, starting from an ammonium halide, the halide can be reacted with a Lewis acid to form a complex anion from the halide and Lewis acid. As an alternative, it is possible to replace a halide ion by the desired anion. This can be achieved by addition of a metal salt with precipitation of the metal halide formed, by means of an ion exchanger or by displacement of the halide ion by a strong acid (with liberation of the hydrogen halide). Suitable methods are described, for example, in Angew. Chem. 2000, 112, pp. 3926 - 3945, and the references cited therein.<br>
Preference is given to compounds which comprise at least one five- or six-membered heterocycle, in particular a five-membered heterocycle, which has at least one nitrogen atom and, if appropriate, an oxygen or sulfur atom; particular preference is given to compounds which comprise at least one five- or six-membered heterocycle which has one, two or three nitrogen atoms and a sulfur or oxygen atom, very particularly preferably those having two nitrogen atoms. Preference is also given to aromatic heterocycles.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds are ones which have a molecular weight of less than 1000 g/mol, very particularly preferably less than 500 g/mol and in particular less than 250 g/mol.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and oligomers comprising this structure.<br>
In the abovementioned formulae (IVa) to (IVy),<br>
the radical R is hydrogen; and<br>
the radicals R^ to R^ are each, independently of one another, hydrogen, a suifo group<br>
or a carbon-comprising organic, saturated or unsaturated, acyclic or cyclic, aliphatic,<br>
aromatic or araliphatic radical  which  has from   1   to 20 carbon  atoms and  is<br>
unsubstituted or interrupted by from 1  to 5 heteroatoms or functional groups or<br>
substituted, with the radicals R1 to R9 which are bound to a carbon atom (and not to a<br>
heteroatom) in the abovementioned formulae (IV) also being able to be halogen or a<br>
functional group; or<br>
two adjacent radicals from the group consisting of R1 to R9 can together also be a divalent, carbon-comprising organic, saturated or unsaturated, acyclic or cyclic, aliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic radical which has from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and is unsubstituted or interrupted by from 1 to 5 heteroatoms or functional groups or substituted.<br>
In the definition of the radicals R1 to R9, heteroatoms are in principle all heteroatoms which are formally able to replace a -CH2-, -CH=, -C or =C= group. If the carbon-comprising radical comprises heteroatoms, then preference is given to oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus and silicon. Preferred groups are, in particular, -0-, -S-, -SO-, -SO2-, -NR'-, -N=, -PR'-, -PR'2 and -SiRV, where the radicals R' are the remaining part of the carbon-comprising radical. The radicals R1 to R9 can in the cases in which they are bound to a carbon atom (and not to a heteroatom) in the abovementioned formula (IV) also be bound directly via the heteroatom.<br>
B05/0198PC<br><br>
Possible functional groups are in principle all functional groups which can be bound to a carbon atom or a heteroatom. Examples of suitable functional groups are -OH (hydroxy), =0 (in particular as a carbonyl group), -NH2 (amino), =NH (imino), -COOH (carboxy), -CONH2 (carboxamide), -SO3H (sulfo) and -CN (cyano). Functional groups and heteroatoms can also be directly adjacent so that combinations of a plurality of adjacent atoms, for instance -O- (ether), -S- (thioether), -COO- (ester). -CONH-(secondary amide) or -CONR'- (tertiary amide) are also comprised, for example di-(Ci-C4-alkyl)amino, Ci-C4-alkyloxycarbonyl or CrC4-alkyloxy.<br>
Halogens may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
