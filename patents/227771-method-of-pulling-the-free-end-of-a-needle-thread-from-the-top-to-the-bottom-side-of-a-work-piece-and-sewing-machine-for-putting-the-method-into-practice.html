INVENTION<br>
As shown in fig 1, the sewing machine seen in the drawing machine seen in the<br>
drawing comprises a top arm 1 and a bottom base plate 2 in the form of a casing,<br>
the two being assembled by a standard 3 to form a C-shaped casing. An arm shaft<br>
4 is mounted in the arm 1, drivable via a belt drive 5 by a motor 6. A control box 7<br>
is joined to the motor 6, housing a microprocessor control system 8. A needle bar<br>
10 is driven in up and down reciprocation by the arm shaft 4 by means of a crank 9<br>
(fig. 3 right side, 5th item from top) a needle 11 is fixed to the lower end of the<br>
needle bar 10.<br>
A hook 12 is disposed in the base plate 2, which is conventionally driven in rotation<br>
about its axis, derived from the arm shaft 4. The hook 12 is provided with a thread<br>
supply 13.<br>
A lifting mechanism 14 (fig. 1,3) disposed in the arm 1, serving for setting the<br>
length of stroke a of work-piece pressers (described below); a setting shaft 15<br>
forms art of it. The setting shaft 15 (fig. 1,3) has a guiding groove 16 (fig 3) with a<br>
crosshead 17 (fig. 3) longitudinally displaceable therein. An end of a lever 18 (fig. 3)<br>
is pivotably mounted on the crosshead 17 (fig. 3); the other end is articulated to a<br>
first arm 19 (fig. 3) of an elbow lever 20 (fig. 3). The elbow lever 20 is pivotably<br>
supported on a bearing 22 (fig. 3) stationary on the machine, at the point of<br>
intersection of its first arm 19 and its second arm 21. A tie rod 23 (fig. 3), which<br>
engages with a cam 24 (fig. 3), acts approximately centrally on the lever 18 (fig. 3);<br>
the cam 24 (fig. 3) is coupled with the arm shaft 4 (fig. 1,3).<br><br>
The arm 1 (fig. 1,13) is provided with a presser 25 (fig 4,5, 3) which has a presser<br>
bar 27 (fig. 3) that is vertically displaceable in as sliding bearing 26 (fig. 3) and a<br>
presser foot 28 (3,4,5) at the bottom end of the presser bar 27 (fig. 3). By the side<br>
of the presser 25, provision is made for a feeder 29 (fig. 3,4,5), equally having the<br>
function of a presser and including a feed bar 31 (fig. 3) which is displaceable in a<br>
sliding bearing 30 (fig. 3) and to the bottom end of which is fixed a feeder foot 32<br>
(fig. 3,5). The sliding bearing 30 (fig. 3), and thus the feeder 29 (fig. 3), are<br>
mounted on a swing frame 33 (fig. 3) where also the needle bar 10 is lodged for<br>
displacement in another sliding bearing 34 ( fig. 3) the feeder bar 31 (fig. 3) and<br>
the needle bar 10 (fig. 3) being paralled to one another. The swing frame 33 (fig.<br>
3) is pivotably mounted on a bearing 35 (fig. 3) in the arm 1 (fig. 1,3), driven by a<br>
sliding gear transmission via a tie rod 36 (fig. 3) that is pivotably joined to the swing<br>
frame 33 via a bearing 37 (fig. 3). A sliding gear transmission of this type is known<br>
from DE34 23 843 C2 (corresponding to U.S. patent 4 616 586).<br>
Actuation of the presser 25 (fig. 3.4.5) and feeder 29 (fig. 4,5) take place from the<br>
elbow lever 20 (fig. 3), the second arm 21 (fig. 3) of which is articulated toa<br>
traingualr driving lever 38(fig. 3), the second arm 21 being joined to a tip of the<br>
driving lever 38 (fig. 3) by way of a tie rod 21a (fig. 3). Transmission levers 39, 40<br>
are articulated to the two other tips; they are articulated to the upper ends of the<br>
presser bar 27 (fig. 3) and the feeder bar 31 (fig. 3), respectively. The driving lever<br>
38 pivotably supports itself via a rod 41 (fig. 3) on a bearing 42 (fig. 3) which<br>
disposed in the arm 1 (fig. 1,3). The rod 41 (fig. 3) is loaded by a pre-stressed<br>
helical compression spring 43 (fig. 3) so that the rod 41 (fig. 3) and thus the<br>
presser 25 (fig. 3) the feeder 29 (fig. 3) are forced downwards. Disposed<br>
underneath the rod 41 (fig. 3) is a stop lever 44 (fig. 3) which is also pivotable in<br>
the bearing 42 (fig. 3) , having a stop 45 that is allocated to the rod 41 underneath<br>
the compression spring 43 (fig. 3). A stop setting drive 46 in the form of a<br>
pneumatically actuated piston cylinder drive acts on the stop lever 44 (fig. 3), its<br><br>
piston rod 47 (fig. 3) being articulated to the stop lever 44 (fig. 3) while its<br>
cylinder 48 (fig. 3) is joined to the standard 3(fig. 3) . the drive 46 (fig. 3) is a<br>
unilaterally actuated piston cylinder drive i.e., a piston 49 (fig. 3) is mounted on<br>
the piston rod 47 (fig. 3), with compressed air being admitted via a compressed-air<br>
piping 50 (fig. 3) to the side of the piston 49 that faces away from the piston rod 47<br>
(fig, 3) so that upon admission of compressed air the piston rod 47 (fig. 3) is<br>
pushed out of the cylinder 48 (fig. 3), whereby the stop 45 (fig. 3) is adjusted<br>
towards the stop lever 44 (fig. 3). Upon pressure relief, the piston 49 (fig. 3) and<br>
thus the piston rod 47 (fig. 3) are restored by means of a readjusting spring 51 (fig.<br>
3). Actuation by compressed air is controlled by a 3/2-port directional control valve<br>
52 (fig. 3) to which compressed air is supplied from a source of compressed air (not<br>
shown) via compressed-air supply piping 53 (fig. 3). On the other hand it is<br>
operated electromagneticlly, to which end it is connected to the control system 8<br>
(fig. 3) via an electric line 54 (fig. 3<br>
The setting shaft 15 (fig. 3) for the presser 25 (fig. 3) is provided with a working<br>
lever 55 (fig. 3), by means of which to pivot the setting shaft 15 (fig. 3) about its<br>
axis, changing the position of the corsshead-17 guiding groove 16 (fig. 3). The<br>
working lever 55 (fig. 3) serves to fix the length of stroke a of the presser 25 (fig. 3)<br>
and the feeder 29. The smallest and greatest adjustable length of stroke a is<br>
defined by two adjustable limit stops 56, 57 (fig. 3) which are which are mounted<br>
on the arm 1 (fig. 1,3) and between which acts a lever 58 that is mounted on the<br>
setting shaft 15 (fig. 3) . For example, 2.0 mm ≤ a ≤ 8.0 mm applies.<br>
A rotary potentiometer 59 (fig. 3) is coupled with the setting shaft 15, visa a signal<br>
line 60 signalling, to the control system 8 (fig. 3), the position of angle rotation of<br>
the setting shaft 15 (fig. 3) as a measured variable.<br><br>
The arm 1 (fig. 1,3) includes a needle-thread supply 61 (fig. 3), which is illustrated<br>
only in Fig. 4. From this supply61 (fig. 3), the needle thread 62 (fig. 3) is<br>
conventionally led via a thread tightener 63 (fig. 3), a thread lever 64 and a thread<br>
clamp 65 (fig. 3) to the needle 11 (fig. 3). The thread tightener 63 (fig. 3) is<br>
described in DE 28 09 848 C2 (corresponding to U.S. patent 4 289 087). It<br>
comprises two tension disks 68, with the needle thread 62 passing there -between,<br>
and a solenoid 67. Corresponding to the voltage fed to the solenoid 67 (fig. 3),<br>
adjustable frictional force is exercised on the needle thread 62 (fig. 3) between the<br>
tension disks 66 (fig. 3), conferring a corresponding tension to the thread.<br>
The thread clamp 65 (fig. 3), which is directly upstream of the needle 11 (fig. 3),<br>
comprises a tension disk 68 (fig. 3) fixed to a guide bar 69 (fig. 3) that is again<br>
loaded by a compression spring 70 (fig. 3), whereby the tension disk 68 (fig. 3) is<br>
forced against an abutment 71 (fig. 3) that is fastened to the arm 1 (fig. 3).<br>
Provided on the abutment 71 (fig. 3) is a solenoid 71 (fig. 3) formed by wire<br>
winding 72 (fig. 3) which can be triggered via a line 73 (fig. 3) from the control<br>
system 8 (fig. 3).<br>
For a sewing job, two work pieces 74, 75 are passed one on top of the other on to<br>
the needle plate 76 (fig. 3) that is provided on the base plate 2 (fig. 3). The needle<br>
plate 76 (fig. 3) has a recess which a bottom feeder 77 (fig. 3) projects through,<br>
having a stitch hole 77 (fig. 3) a for the needle 11 to pass through. The bottom<br>
feeder 77 (fig. 3) is kinematically linked to the mentioned sliding gear transmission<br>
such that the stitch hole 77 (fig. 3) a is moved synchronously with the needle 11<br>
(fig. 3) stitching into the work pieces 74, 75 (fig. 3) during stitch formatiion and<br>
equally performing the feed motion. The described design and mode of operation<br>
are familiar general practice in so-called needle-feed sewing machines.<br><br>
The two work pieces 74, 75 have a total thickness s. The length a by which<br>
the feet 28, 32 are lifted above the work pieces 74, 75 is set by an operator<br>
by means of the working lever 55. Assumably the operator increases the<br>
length of stroke a as the thickness s of the work pieces 74, 75 grows, the<br>
compressibility of the two work pieces 74, 75 increasing as the thickness s<br>
increases.<br>
In a standard sewing operation, the needle 11, together with the needle<br>
thread 62, passes through the work pieces 74, 75 into the stitch hole 77a.<br>
The feeder foot 32 is in a lowered and the feeder 77 in an elevated position<br>
so that the work pieces 74, 75 are clamped between the feeder 77 and the<br>
feeder foot 32. At this time the presser foot 28 is above the work piece 74<br>
corresponding to the length of stroke a so that unimpeded feed of the work<br>
pieces 74, 75, with the needle 11 passed there-through, is possible in the<br>
direction of feed 82. The thread clamp 65 is opened so that the needle<br>
thread 62 can be supplied unimpeded by the downward motion of the nee-<br>
dle 11.<br>
When the needle 11, after passing through its lowermost position, has again<br>
moved upwards by approximately 2.5 mm, the tip 79 of the rotating hook<br>
12 seizes the needle-thread loop 78 formed upon upward motion of the<br>
needle 11. With the upward motion proceeding, the needle 11 finally re-<br>
tracts from the work pieces 74, 75. Meanwhile the hook 12 has caused the<br>
needle thread loop 78 to entirely surround the hook-thread supply 13. Then<br>
the excess needle thread 62 is retracted by the thread lever 64 with a two-<br>
thread lock-stitch seam 81 forming. Afterwards the presser foot 28 and the<br>
feeder foot 32 are shifted so that the presser foot 28 is placed on the work<br>
pieces 74, 75 and the feeder foot 32 is lifted off by the length of stroke a.<br>
During a standard sewing operation, the thread clamp 65 only serves as a<br><br>
guide of the needle thread 62, not braking it. The described way of stitch<br>
forming and the mode of alternating operation of the feet 28, 32 with nee-<br>
dle feed are familiar and general practice.<br>
When a first stitch of a seam 81 is to be sewn, the free end 83 of the needle<br>
thread 62 i.e., the needle-thread starting end, is above the work pieces 74,<br>
75; it is clamped between the upper work piece 75 and the presser foot 28<br>
by a force that depends on the pre-load of the compression spring 43. For<br>
this free end 83 to be pulled downwards through the work pieces 74, 75<br>
when the needle-thread loop 78 is extended upon corresponding revolution<br>
of the hook tip 79, the presser foot 28 must be relieved while the needle-<br>
thread loop 78 is extended. This is effected by corresponding actuation of<br>
the stop setting drive 46 by compressed air, whereby the stop lever 44 and<br>
the stop 45 are elevated, bearing against the rod 41. In doing so, the trian-<br>
gular driving lever 38 is slightly pivoted, as a result of which the presser<br>
bar 27 and thus the presser foot 28 are slightly lifted without the presser<br>
foot 28 being removed from the work pieces 74, 75, which implies pressure<br>
relief of the work pieces 74, 75 and, consequently, reduction of the fric-<br>
tional force that impedes the free end 83 of the needle thread 62 in being<br>
pulled out. The accompanying downward motion of the feeder foot 32 is of<br>
no importance functionally, the foot 32 not coming in touch with the work<br>
pieces 74, 75. As can be seen from the above, the stop setting drive 46 is a<br>
presser-25-relief drive. Relieving the feeder foot 32 for the free end 83 of<br>
the needle thread 62 to be pulled to the bottom side of the work piece 75 is<br>
in principle known from DE 36 04 299 C2 (corresponding to U.S.<br>
4 658 752).<br>
The distance b of the stop 45 from the rod 41 grows as the thickness s of<br>
the work pieces 74, 75 increases i.e., the idle stroke from when the piston<br><br>
rod 47 starts extending to the moment when the stop 45 bears against the<br>
rod 41, increases as work-piece thickness s increases. For this to be com-<br>
pensated, the time of activation of the stop setting drive 46 is increased as<br>
the length of stroke a increases, which takes place in accordance with an<br>
empirically determined function roughly outlined in Fig. 7, where the ac-<br>
tuation time t is plotted above the length of stroke a. This function is re-<br>
corded in a ROM 84 of the control system 8. The length of stroke a is<br>
passed to the control system 8 by the rotary potentiometer 59 upon corre-<br>
sponding adjustment of the setting shaft 15, there setting off the valve 52,<br>
and thus the drive 46, to be triggered in accordance with the function<br>
t = f (a). The greater the work piece thickness s, the greater is the length of<br>
stroke a - as outlined above. Any increase in length of stroke a is accom-<br>
panied with an increase in the duration of triggering of the stop setting<br>
drive 46, which compensates the time loss during idle stroke over the<br>
length b. Moreover the compressibility of the work pieces 74, 75, which<br>
increases as the thickness s of the work pieces 74, 75 grows, is balanced.<br><br>

- a rotarily drivable hook (12), the tip (79) of which seizes a needle-thread loop<br>
(78) and extends it for forming a stitch,<br>
- a needle-thread-(62) clamp (65) which is stationarily provided between the<br>
thread lever (64) and the needle (11).<br>
- a presser drive; and<br>
- a control system (8) for the thread clam (65) and the presser drive; wherein a<br>
presser-relief drive is triggered by the control system (8) in accordance with a<br>
function which is recorded in the control system (8), reflecting the dependency<br>
of the time of actuation of the presser-relief drive on the thickness (s) of the at<br>
least one work piece (74, 75).<br>
4. A sewing machine as claimed in claim 3, wherein a feeder (29) is provided,<br>
which is drivable alternately of the presser (25); a joint drive is provided for the<br>
presser (25) and the feeder (29); and the presser-relief drive is a presser-lift -<br>
off drive (46).<br>
5. A sewing machine as claimed in claim 4, wherein an adjustable lifting<br>
mechanism (14) is provided for adjustment of the length of stroke (a) of the<br>
presser (25); and a potentiometer (59), which is coupled with the lifting<br>
mechanism (14), is provided for detection and transmission, to the control<br>
system (8),<br><br>
of a measured variable representing the length of stroke (a) of the presser<br>
(25) which is adjusted on the lifting mechanism (14).<br><br>
In a method of pulling the free end (83) of the needle thread (62) from the top of<br>
the bottom of at least one work piece (74, 75) upon a first stitch of a seam (81)<br>
that is to be sewn, use is made of a sewing machine with at least one presser (25)<br>
which can be placed on, and lifted off, the work piece (74, 75). The needle thread<br>
(62) is held tight while a needle-thread loop (78) is extended by the tip of the<br>
hook (13) so that the free end (83) is pulled through the work piece (74, 75).<br>
While the needle thread (62) is held tight, the presser (25) is at least partially<br>
relieved. The relief time increases as the thickness (s) of the work piece (74, 75)<br>
grows.</td>
