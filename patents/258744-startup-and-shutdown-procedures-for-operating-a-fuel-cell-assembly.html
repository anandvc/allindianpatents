				<td>STARTUP AND SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES FOR OPERATING A FUEL CELL ASSEMBLY<br>
1.       Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to fuel cells. More particularly, this invention relates to techniques for starting up and shutting down a fuel cell assembly to achieve an extended operational life.<br>
2.        Description of the Related Art<br>
Fuel cells are well known. Typical arrangements include a fuel processing portion and a fuel cell stack or fuel cell portion. Fuel cell assemblies operate in a known manner to generate electrical power.<br>
One challenge faced by designers of fuel cell assemblies is achieving a long operational life in an economical manner. A number of factors affect the useful life of a fuel cell assembly. For example, the manner in which a fuel cell assembly is shutdown from an operating state and placed into a storage state has an impact on the performance decay experienced over the life of the cell assembly. More particularly, oxidation of the carbonaeous catalyst support resulting from the combined effects of temperature and electrochemical potential causes performance loss at a rate that depends, at least in part, on the procedures used for shutting down the fuel cell assembly.<br>
Various techniques have been proposed in an attempt to extend the useful life of a fuel cell assembly. United States Patent No. 5,045,414, for example, discloses using an oxygen-nitrogen gas as a purge gas for a cathode side of a phosphoric acid fuel cell during a shutdown procedure. That patent also teaches using an auxiliary electrical load to lower cathode potential. U.S. Patent No. 6,519,510 discloses cooling a fuel cell from an operational temperature to a transition temperature with the fuel cell portion operating at an idle load before initiate purging procedures. U.S. Patent No. 6,635,370 discloses a shutdown and startup procedure that includes selectively controlling airflow and reducing cell voltage in a manner that is intended to extend fuel cell life.<br>
Those skilled in the art are always striving to make improvements. This Invention provides unique shutdown and startup procedures that provides superior results for extending the useful life of a fuel cell assembly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An example startup procedure for operating a fuel cell assembly includes heating at least the fuel cell portion and the fuel processing portion of the assembly to bring the heated portions to a selected operational temperature. While heating those portions to the operational temperature, anode and cathode flow fields of the fuel cell portion are periodically purged with a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture that has less than about 2% hydrogen. In one example, the mixture has less than about 0.1% hydrogen.<br>
When a temperature of at least the fuel processing portion corresponds to the selected operational temperature, a flow of reactants to the fuel processing portion begins. A flow of hydrogen rich fuel to the anode flow field begins when a temperature of at least the fuel cell portion corresponds to the selected operational temperature. Any auxiliary electrical load coupled to the fuel cell portion is disabled.<br>
Air flow to the cathode flow field is then initiated and the fuel cell portion is connected to a primary electrical load that is at least idle.<br>
An example shutdown procedure for operating a fuel cell assembly includes reducing an average temperature of the fuel cell portion from an operational temperature to a selected reduced temperature when the fuel cell portion is coupled to an idle load. Once the selected temperature is reached, the primary electrical load is disconnected from the fuel cell portion. Simultaneously terminating air flow to a cathode flow field of the fuel cell portion and connecting an auxiliary electrical load to the fuel cell portion reduces a voltage of the fuel cell portion to less than about 0.2 volts per cell.<br>
A flow of a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture having less than about 2% hydrogen begins flowing through the cathode flow field. In one example, a volume of the mixture is used that is at least about three times a void volume of the cathode flow field. A hydrogen rich fuel flow to the fuel cell portion is terminated along with terminating hydrocarbon fuel flow to the fuel processing portion. A hydrogen-nitrogen mixture having less than about 2% hydrogen begins flowing through an<br>
anode flow field of the fuel cell portion and the fuel processing portion. In one example, a volume of the mixture is used that is at least about three times a void volume of the anode flow field and the fuel processing portion, respectively.<br>
The fuel cell portion is then cooled to a selected storage temperature. While cooling the fuel cell portion, the cathode flow field, the anode flow field and the fuel processing portion are periodically purged with a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture that has less than about 2% hydrogen.<br>
Once the fuel cell portion has reached the selected storage temperature, the cathode flow field, the anode flow field and the fuel processing portion are periodically purged with a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture that has less than about 2% hydrogen.<br>
In one example, the purging hydrogen-nitrogen mixture used at various stages during the shutdown procedure has less than about 0.1% hydrogen.<br>
The various features and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of currently preferred embodiments. The drawing that accompanies the detailed description can be briefly described as follows.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows selected portions of a fuel cell assembly that can be operated using procedures designed according to an embodiment of this invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a fuel cell assembly 20 that includes a fuel cell portion 22. As known, the fuel cell portion 22 includes a fuel cells including an anode 24 and a cathode 26. As known, the anode 24 and cathode 26 each include a catalyst layer and a flow field. A typical fuel cell portion 22 includes a stack of fuel cells such that there are a plurality of anodes and cathodes. In one example, the fuel cell portion 22 comprises a stack of phosphoric acid fuel cells. The fuel cell portion 22 operates in a known manner.<br>
A fuel processing portion 28 operates in a known manner. The fuel processing portion 28 includes known elements such as a hydrodesulfurizer, a steam reformer<br>
and a water gas shift reactor. The catalyst in the steam reformer in one example is a uase metal such as nickel and the catalyst in the shift reactor is a base metal such as copper. A nickel-containing reformer must be purged with an inert gas during a shutdown procedure to prevent formation of nickel carbonyl for known reasons. A copper-containing shift reactor must be purged with inert gas during a shutdown procedure to prevent oxidation of the copper, which would otherwise reduce its activity.<br>
One example fuel processing portion 28 has a noble metal catalyst in the reformer and the shift reactor. Such noble metal containing components of the fuel processing portion 28 can be exposed to air without deleterious results. It is not necessary to purge these noble metal containing elements with the hydrogen-nitrogen mixture during a starting or shutdown procedure. In such an example, only some of the fuel processing portion will be purged with a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture as described below. Accordingly, discussion of purging a fuel processing portion in this description should be understood to pertain to only such components as would benefit from such purging.<br>
The example fuel cell assembly 20 has an extended operational life, in part, because unique startup and shutdown procedures reduce the performance decay experienced over time, which results in an extended useful life and a reduced cost for electrical power generated by the assembly 20.<br>
An example startup procedure for operating the fuel cell assembly 20 includes heating at least the fue! cell portion 22 and the appropriate portions of the fuel processing portion 28 to bring the heated portions to a selected operational temperature. While heating those portions to the operational temperature, the anode 24 and cathode 26 flow fields are periodically purged with a purge gas from a supply 30.<br>
In one example, the purge gas is a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas that has less than about 2% hydrogen. In one preferred example, the mixture has less than about 0.1% hydrogen.<br>
A hydrogen-nitrogen mixture is superior to an oxygen-nitrogen mixture as a purge gas. The hydrogen-nitrogen mixture of the disclosed examples yields less performance loss and, therefore, an extended useful life of the assembly 20.<br>
The purge gas used in the described example is a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture. The nitrogen may be replaced by any of the inert gases which are helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon. The nitrogen also may be replaced by any gas that is inert in the fuel cell environment. One example of such a gas is carbon dioxide.<br>
When a temperature of at least the fuel processing portion 28 corresponds to the selected operational temperature, a flow of reactants to the fuel processing portion 28 begins. A flow of hydrogen rich fuel to the anode 24 flow field begins when a temperature of at least the fuel cell portion 22 corresponds to the selected operational temperature. Any auxiliary electrical load 40 that was coupled to the fuel cell portion is disabled at about this point in the procedure using a known technique. The illustration includes an auxiliary load 40 that operates in a known manner to reduce cell potential during periods of non-use.<br>
Air flow to the cathode 26 flow field is then initiated and a known technique is used to connect the fuel cell portion 22 to a primary electrical load 42 that is at least idle. In some situations, the initial load on the fuel cell portion 22 will be greater than an idle load because of the corresponding condition of the primary load 42.<br>
An example shutdown procedure for operating the fuel cell assembly 20 includes reducing an average temperature of the fuel cell portion 22 from an operational temperature to a selected reduced temperature when the primary load 42 coupled to the fuel cell portion 22 is idle. In one example, the operational temperature is greater than about 350° F (177° C) at a load of about 250 ASF and the selected reduced temperature is about 300° F (150° C) at a load of about 50 ASF. Once the selected temperature is reached, the primary electrical load 42 is disconnected from the fuel cell portion 22 using known techniques. Simultaneously terminating air flow to the cathode 26 flow field and connecting the auxiliary electrical load 40 to the fuel cell portion 22 reduces a voltage of the fuel cell portion 22. In one example, the reduced voltage is less than about 0.2 volts per cell.<br>
A flow of the hydrogen-nitrogen mixture purge gas begins flowing through the cathode 26 flow field. A hydrogen rich fuel flow to the fuel cell portion 22 is terminated by terminating hydrocarbon fuel flow to the fuel processing portion 28. The hydrogen-nitrogen mixture from the source 30 begins flowing through the anode 24 flow field and the fuel processing portion 28. In one example, a volume of purge<br>
gas is used that is at least about three times a void volume of the anode 24 flow field and the fuel processing portion 28, respectively. In one preferred example, the purging hydrogen-nitrogen mixture used during the shutdown procedure has less than about 0.1% hydrogen.<br>
The fuel cell portion 22 is then cooled to a selected storage temperature. In one example, the storage temperature is within a range from about 110° F - 140° F (43° C - 60° C). While cooling the fuel cell portion 22, the cathode 26 flow field, the anode 24 flow field and the fuel processing portion 28 are periodically purged with the hydrogen-nitrogen mixture.<br>
Once the fuel cell portion 22 has reached the selected storage temperature, the cathode 26 flow field, the anode 24 flow field and the fuel processing portion 28 are periodically purged with hydrogen-nitrogen mixture in one example.<br>
One unique feature of the example shutdown procedure is that the cathode 26 flow field and the fuel processing portion 28 are purged with the hydrogen-nitrogen mixture. Purging the cathode 26 displaces air or depleted air from the oxidant inlet and exit manifolds, respectively. This results in a more effective passivation of the cathode 26 compared to simply terminating air flow to the cathode 26.<br>
There are potential applications for operating a fuel cell assembly where the fuel is pure hydrogen rather than a reformed hydrocarbon fuel. One source of such hydrogen is by-product hydrogen from the production of chlorine using the known chlor-alkai process. Such a fuel cell assembly would not include a fuel cell processing portion as previously described. In one example, the fuel cell portion of such a fuel cell assembly would still be started up and shutdown as previously described.<br>
The preceding description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature. Variations and modifications to the disclosed examples may become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not necessarily depart from the essence of this invention. The scope of legal protection given to this invention can only be determined by studying the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
