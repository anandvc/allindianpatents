				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Spinning machine comprising a plurality of spinning stations<br>
The present invention relates to a spinning machine having a<br>
plurality of adjacently arranged spinning stations each<br>
comprising a drafting apparatus including a front roller pair<br>
which defines a front nipping line, as well as a condensing<br>
zone for condensing a drafted fibre strand arranged downstream<br>
of the drafting apparatus, which condensing zone comprises an<br>
air-permeable transport belt which transports the fibre<br>
strand, a suction channel which guides the transport belt on a<br>
sliding surface, and a suction slit located in the sliding<br>
surface, whereby the suction channel, extending along a<br>
plurality of spinning stations, projects into a wedge-shaped<br>
gap formed by the front roller pair and whereby the front<br>
roller pair comprises a driven bottom cylinder which extends<br>
along a plurality of spinning stations, which bottom cylinder<br>
has a smaller diameter between the spinning stations than at<br>
the spinning stations.<br>
The fibre strand drafted in a drafting apparatus of a spinning<br>
machine subsequently recieves a spinning twist. If this<br>
spinning twist were imparted directly after drafting, then a<br>
so-called spinning triangle would occur at the front roller<br>
pair, which spinning triangle contains lateral fibres not<br>
completly bound into the twisted thread. In order to avoid<br>
this disadvantage, a so-called condensing zone has in recent<br>
times been arranged directly downstream of the drafting<br>
apparatus, in which condensing zone the drafted, but still<br>
twist-free fibre strand is bundled or condensed by means of a<br>
lateral collecting together of its single fibres, so that<br>
after the arranging of a further nipping point, the<br>
disadvantageous spinning triangle is no longer present. When<br>
the condensed fibre strand is then imparted its spinning twist<br>
in the usual way, a thread is created which is less hairy,<br>
more even and more tear-resistant.<br>
In a prior art spinning machine of the above mentioned type<br>
(German published patent application 198 37 179), a suction<br>
channel is arranged downstream of the front roller pair of the<br>
drafting apparatus, which suction channel is either at a large<br>
distance from the front nipping line, or it deflects to a<br>
great degree the fibre strand to be condensed directly<br>
downstream of the front nipping line. In the area of the<br>
wedge-shaped gap located between the front roller pair and the<br>
suction channel, in particular also between the individual<br>
spinning stations, fibres can collect, which for one reason or<br>
another were not bound into the fibre strand during<br>
condensing. These stray single fibres may at some time return<br>
to the fibre strand in an undesirable way and/or block the<br>
perforations of the air-permeable transport belt, both of<br>
which in time impair the condensing effect. This disadvantage<br>
cannot be eliminated in that in the known spinning machine the<br>
bottom cylinder has a somewhat smaller diameter between the<br>
spinning stations than at the spinning stations, where the<br>
bottom cylinder is provided with a fluting in a known way. The<br>
somewhat larger diameter at the fluting occurs from warping<br>
during the usual rolling of the fluting during manufacture.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid stray fibres<br>
to the greatest extent possible, and when they do occur, to<br>
eliminate them from the areas of the spinning stations.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present<br>
invention in that the suction channel is positioned as near as<br>
is technically possible to the front nipping line and to the<br>
bottom cylinder without actually touching it and without<br>
deflecting the fibre strand to be condensed to any significant<br>
degree in the area of the edge-shaped gap, and in that the<br>
bottom cylinder leaves a sufficiently large cleaning gap<br>
between the spinning stations in relation to the suction<br>
channel.<br>
It has been shown, that fibre fly can be reduced in that the<br>
suction channel is arranged as closely as possible to the<br>
front nipping line and to the bottom cylinder, whereby<br>
naturally a certain necessary distance must be maintained. The<br>
arrangement of the components should be such that the fibre<br>
strand is deflected as little as possible after it leaves the<br>
front nipping line. Thus a fibre strand of a higher quality<br>
occurs from the outset. Any occuring stray fibres usually<br>
reach the cleaning gap located beside the spinning stations,<br>
which cleaning gap is formed outside of the spinning station<br>
between the bottom cylinder and the suction channel. Stray<br>
fibres can fall through this enlarged cleaning gap, which is<br>
significantly larger than the diameter alteration which in<br>
prior art occurs during manufacture of the fluting of the<br>
bottom cylinder, thus being removed from the critical area of<br>
the spinning stations.<br>
The bottom cylinder between the spinning stations is<br>
preferably reduced in diameter by means of metal cutting. It<br>
should be at least so far reduced that the cleaning gap has an<br>
inner width of at least 1.2 mm.<br>
Trials have shown that favourable ratios are given when the<br>
bottom cylinder at the spinning stations, that is in the area<br>
of its fluting, has a diameter of approximately 27 mm and bet-<br>
ween the spinning stations a diameter of approximately 24 mm.<br>
In order to remove stray fibres in a more reliable way, it can<br>
be additionally provided that the bottom roller touches the<br>
transport belt at a point where it is not supported opposite<br>
the suction channel. Thus an additional mechanical cleaning of<br>
the transport belt takes place, as the bottom cylinder and the<br>
transport belt run in opposite directions at the point of<br>
contact.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become more readily apparent from the<br>
following detailed description thereof when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a part intersectional side view through a spinning<br>
station in the area of a condensing zone,<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure<br>
1 onto the bottom cylinder and the condensing zone.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the case of the above mentioned spinning machine, a rinq<br>
spinning machine is preferably involved. It comprises in the<br>
usual way a plurality of adjacently arranged spinning stations<br>
in machine longitudinal direction, of which three spinning<br>
stations 1, 2 and 3 are visible in Figure 2.<br>
Each spinning station 1 comprises amongst other components a<br>
drafting apparatus 4, of which only the end area is shown in<br>
Figure 1, and a condensing zone 6 arranged downstream of the<br>
drafting apparatus 4, which condensing zone 6 bundles a<br>
drafted but still twist-free fibre strand 5. The remaining<br>
components of the spinning station 1 are not shown.<br>
Each drafting apparatus 4 comprises amongst other components a<br>
front roller pair 7 as well as an apron pair arranged upstream<br>
therefrom and comprising a lower apron 8 and an upper apron 9.<br>
The remaining roller pairs of the drafting apparatus 4 are not<br>
shown.<br>
The front roller pair 7 comprises a bottom cylinder 10<br>
extending along a plurality of spinning stations 1,2,3 ...,<br>
which bottom cylinder 10 has in a known way a fluted area 11.<br>
At each spinning station 1, a top roller 12 is arranged to the<br>
fluted area 11 of the bottom cylinder 10 in a known way. The<br>
front roller pair 7 defines a front nipping line 13, at which<br>
the drafting zone of the drafting apparatus 4 ends. In the<br>
drafting apparatus 4, fed fibre material 14, for example a<br>
sliver or a roving, is drafted in transport direction A to the<br>
desired fineness. The drafting process ends essentially at the<br>
front nipping line 13.<br>
For the reasons mentioned above, a condensing zone 6 is<br>
arranged downstream of the drafting apparatus 4, in which<br>
condensing zone 6 the still twist-free fibre strand 5 is<br>
bundled or condensed by means of lateral collecting together<br>
of its single fibres.<br>
Each condensing zone 6 comprises an air-permeable transport<br>
belt 15, which transports the fibre strand 5 to be condensed<br>
through the condensing zone 6. In the case of the transport<br>
belt 15, a thin, close-meshed woven belt is preferably<br>
involved, in which the air permeability occurs naturally.<br>
The transport belt 15 is guided over a sliding surface 16,<br>
which is formed by the outer contour of a suction channel 17<br>
extending along a plurality of spinning stations. The suction<br>
channel 17 is connected via a vacuum conduit 18 to a vacuum<br>
source (not shown).<br>
In the sliding surface 16 of each spinning station 1, a<br>
suction slit 19 is located, which is arranged slightly<br>
diagonally to the transport direction A and as a result of<br>
which is provided with a lateral gathering edge 20, along<br>
which the fibre strand 5 to be condensed travels. At this<br>
gathering edge 20, the fibre strand 5 is condensed by means of<br>
lateral collecting together of its single fibres, whereby in<br>
addition a very slight false twist is applied, which increases<br>
the condensing effect. The transport belt 15 is guided via a<br>
tensioning element 21 at a distance from the suction slit 19.<br>
A delivery roller 23 is arranged at the end of the condensing<br>
zone 6, which delivery roller 15 drives the transport belt 15<br>
and forms with the suction channel 17 a delivery nipping line<br>
24, to which the suction slit 19 extends and which forms a<br>
twist block with regard to the spinning twist. Directly<br>
downstream of the delivery nipping line 24 the thread 25<br>
arises, while it is fed in delivery direction B to a twist<br>
device (not shown), for example a ring spindle. The delivery<br>
roller 23 prevents the spinning twist applied to the thread 25<br>
from extending back into the condensing zone 6.<br>
A toothed belt drive 26, denoted only by a dot-dash line,<br>
serves the drive of the delivery roller 23 and is so designed<br>
that the delivery roller 23 has a slightly higher<br>
circumferential speed than the top roller 12.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, the front roller pair 7 forms on<br>
its side facing the condensing zone 6 a wedge-shaped gap 27,<br>
in which the suction channel 17 projects. The suction channel<br>
17 should hereby be positioned as close to the front nipping<br>
line 13 and the bottom cylinder 10 as is technically possible,<br>
without coming into contact with the latter and without<br>
significantly deflecting the fibre strand 5 to be condensed in<br>
the area of the wedge-shaped gap 27. It has been shown that<br>
such an arrangement results in a particularly good quality<br>
thread 25. The close positioning should be such that between<br>
the suction channel 17 and the front nipping line 13 and the<br>
bottom cylinder 10 there is only a very small necessary<br>
distance.<br>
This close positioning of the suction channel 17 to the front<br>
roller pair 7 results in as few as possible stray fibres<br>
occuring which then leave the fibre strand 5. Should any stray<br>
fibres occur, care must be taken that these fibres do not get<br>
into the fibre strand 5 again in an undesirable way. For this<br>
reason it is provided that between the spinning stations 1,2,3<br>
...the bottom cylinder 10 has, in relation to the suction<br>
channel 17, a sufficiently large cleaning gap 28. This<br>
cleaning gap 28 should be significantly larger than the prior<br>
art diameter reduction, which is usually present in bottom<br>
cylinders 10 as a result of the standard application of the<br>
fluted area 11.<br>
The dimensions of the cleaning gap 28 are so chosen that any<br>
stray fibres fall through and are thus removed from the<br>
criticial area of the spinning station 1.<br>
The smaller diameter d of the bottom cylinder 10 is made<br>
preferably by means of a metal cutting process, whereby the<br>
diameter d should be reduced to such an extent that the<br>
cleaning gap 28 has an inner width a of at least 1.2 mm.<br>
Favourable conditions have arisen in practice when the bottom<br>
cylinder 10 has a diameter D in its fluted area 11 of<br>
approximately 27 mm and between the spinning stations 1,2,3...<br>
a diameter d of approximately 24 mm.<br>
The cleaning effect can be increased if the bottom cylinder 10<br>
touches the transport belt 15 at a point 2 9 where it is not<br>
supported opposite the suction channel 17, where the bottom<br>
cylinder 10 and the transport belt 15 travel in opposite<br>
directions. An additional mechanical cleaning thus takes<br>
place.<br>
