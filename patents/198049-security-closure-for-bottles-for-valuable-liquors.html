The present invention relates to a security closure for a bottle for valuable liquors, provided with a collar, of the type comprising a pouring body having a flange, a cap-like stopper and a sleeve made in a single piece and interconnected by means of a weakening line, a screw coupling between the cap-like stopper and the pouring body, a rim formed inside the sleeve and surmounting the flange, and also anti-removal means associated with the sleeve for retaining the security closure on the bottle.<br>
Such closures, although satisfactory from various points of view and essentially suitable for the purpose, nevertheless have a disadvantage which manifests itself when the closure is subjected to prolonged heating, carried out by an unauthorized person by, for example, submerging the closure and the bottle in hot water.<br>
It has in fact been found that, following such treatment, it is possible to remove the pouring body from the bottle simply by acting with prolonged constant pressure on the pouring body itself in the transverse direction, for example with the thumb.<br>
Following this removal, any unauthorized filling of the bottle with liquors of poor quality is clearly possible.<br><br>
The problem forming the basis of the present invention is that of devising a security closure of the specified the which has structural and functional characteristics so as to overcome the abovementioned disadvantage.<br>
This problem is solved by a security closure of the specified type which is characterized in that it comprises an annular insert which is inserted in the sleeve and has an essentially C-shaped section, with a back and two wings, the wings surmounting the flange and the collar respectively.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a security closure for a bottle for valuable liquors, provided with a collar, the closure being of the type comprising a pouring body having a flange, a cap-like stopper and a sleeve which are made in a single piece and interconnected by means of a weakening line, a screw coupling between the cap-like stopper and the pouring body, a rim formed inside the sleeve and surmounting the flange, and anti-removal means associated with the sleeve for retaining the sleeve on the bottle, wherein an annular insert is located within the sleeve and has an essentially C-shaped section, with a back and two wings, the wings surmounting the flange and the collar respectively.<br>
Further characteristics and the advantages of the security closure according to the present invention will emerge from the description below of a preferred embodiment of it, given by way of non-limiting indication, with reference to the attached figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a view in elevation, in partial section, of a security closure according to the invention, made along the line I-I,<br>
Figure 2 shows a plan view in section of the closure in Figure 1, made along the line II-II,<br>
Figure 3 shows a view in section and on enlarged scale of a detail of the closure in Figure 1, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a view in elevation and in partial<br><br>
section of a security closure according to the invention, according to an alternative embodiment of it.<br>
With reference to the attached figures, 1 indicates generally a combination of a bottle 2 or the like, preferably a bottle made of glass for a valuable liquor, and a security closure 3, which constitutes a particularly manipulable whole, applied to the bottle 2, after its filling with the liquor.<br>
The closure 3, with an axis X-X, comprises a mouth 4, a collar 5 and external radial teeth 6. The collar 5 comprises a conical guide wall 7 and defines a shoulder 8 in the bottle.<br>
The closure 3 comprises a pouring body 9, preferably made of a relatively rigid material, for example polycarbonate. The pouring body 9 comprises a pouring-out edge 10 with an annular drip-catching lip 11, an external thread 12, and a flange 13. The pouring body 9 is mounted on the bottle in its extension with interposition of a washer 14, preferably made of a relatively deformable material, for example polyethylene.<br>
Formed between the pouring body 9 and the washer 14 is a cage 15, in which a shutter 16 is mounted, with the function of a non-return valve so as, that is, to allow the exit of the liquor but to prevent unauthorized filling of the bottle.<br><br>
The closure 3 comprises a cap-like stopper 17 which has a base 18 coupled in a sealed manner to the pouring body 9, and a shell 19 which has an internal thread 2 0 and an end 21.<br>
The bottle 2 also comprises a tubular sleeve 22 which has an upper end 23, in the region of which an internal rim 24 is formed, and internal radial teeth 25.<br>
The cap-like stopper 17 and the tubular sleeve 22 constitute a single piece, preferably obtained by moulding a relatively deformable and soft material, for example polypropylene, and are joined together, in the region of the respective ends 21 and 23, by means of a weakening line 26.<br>
The internal thread 20 and the external thread 12 constitute a screw coupling 27 between the cap-like stopper and the pouring body. The internal radial teeth 25 and the external radial teeth 6 constitute an anti-rotation joint 28 between the sleeve and the bottle.<br>
A cap-like outer stopper 29 is fitted on the capÂ¬like stopper 17. The outer stopper 29 has a base 30, a shell 31 and an annular end strip 32. The outer stopper 29 is retained axially on the stopper 17 by the provision of respective annular projections 33 and 34 which snap over one another. The cap-like outer stopper 29 is joined in rotation to the cap-like stopper 17 by the provision<br><br>
of respective internal 35 and external 36 radial teeth which form an anti-rotation joint. The annular strip 32 is connected to the outer stopper 29 by means of a weakening line 37 and surrounds the sleeve 22.<br>
The annular strip 32 and the sleeve 22 are rendered integral in rotation by the provision of respective internal 38 and external 39 radial teeth which form an anti-rotation joint.<br>
The closure 1 according to the invention comprises an annular insert 40 which is inserted inside the sleeve 22.<br>
The annular insert 40 is made of a relatively rigid material, for example polycarbonate, and has an essentially C-shaped section, open towards the axis X-x, with a back 41 and upper and lower wings 4 2 and 43 respectively,, defining an internal annular slot 44.<br>
While the back 41 surrounds the pouring body and the bottle, the upper wing 4 2 is interposed between the internal rim 24 of the sleeve and the flange 13 of the pouring body and is surmounted by the latter.<br>
As far as the lower wing 43 is concerned, it surmounts the collar 5 of the bottle, facing the shoulder 8 thereof.<br>
In other words, the annular slot 44 defined in the insert receives the flange 13 and the collar 5, and<br><br>
the two wings of the insert enclose the flange and the collar with limited axial play, joining axially the pouring body and the bottle.<br>
An anti-rotation joint 4 5 is formed between the internal rim 24 of the sleeve 22, if need be provided with frontal teeth 46, and the upper wing 42 of the annular insert 40, if need be provided with frontal teeth 47.<br>
An anti-rotation joint 4 8 is formed between the upper wing 42, if need be provided with frontal teeth 49, and flange 13, if need be provided with frontal teeth 50.<br>
In the region of the lower wing 43, the annular insert 40 is provided with a conical guide wall 51 intended to interact with the conical guide wall 7 during fitting of the closure on the bottle.<br>
The sleeve 22 and the insert 40 are equipped with respective conical portions, internal 5 2 and external 53 respectively.<br>
The external conical portion 53 is dimensioned to constitute a guide for the axial mounting of the insert in the sleeve and to be coupled to the internal conical portion of the sleeve, in mutual centring engagement.<br>
The closure 1 is completed by anti-removal means 54 which are capable of retaining the closure on the bottle axially. The anti-removal means 54 comprise an<br><br>
annular extension 55 of the annular back 41 of the insert, which extends from the lower wing 43 and has a free end 56 and also a shoulder 57 formed in the sleeve 22, with which the free end 56 is in engagement.<br>
This shoulder 57 is defined by an annular projection 58 which is formed internally in the sleeve and has a section of sawtooth shape, with a ramp 59, constituting a guide, and a protuberance 60 constituting said shoulder 57,<br>
The free end 56 of the extension is preferably crenellated by the presence of teeth 61 distributed at regular intervals so as to anchor stably the free end 56 of the extension 55 in the shoulder 57.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the invention,, a closure generally indicated by 62 and shown in Figure 4 is described; the parts of the closure 6 2 which have the same structure and function as the parts of the closure 3 described above have the same reference numbers.<br>
In the security closure 62, the insert and the pouring body constitute a single piece 63, obtained by moulding a relatively rigid material, for example polycarbonate.<br>
In the security closure 3 according to the invention, any unauthorized filling of the bottle 2 is<br><br>
prevented, even by resorting to the expedient of subjecting the security closure 3 to prolonged heating. In fact, it has proved practically impossible to remove the pouring body 9 since this remains constantly retained on the bottle 2 by the enclosure of the flange 13 and the collar 5 by the annular insert 40. This enclosure, which takes place between relatively rigid materials, has proved to endure even following prolonged heating. Even more, in the security closure 62 it is practically impossible to remove the pouring, body 9 since it constitutes a single piece with the annular insert 40,<br>
The main advantage of the closure according to the present invention has proved to be that of an improved capacity to withstand actions by unauthorized persons.<br>
A further advantage of the closure according to the invention has proved to be that of ease of construction and speed of assembly, a major advantage for an article which is intended to be constructed in hundreds of millions.<br>
Clearly, for the purpose of satisfying contingent and specifc requirements, the expert in the field will be able to make numerous modifications and variations to the closure described above, all nevertheless contained within the scope of protection of the invention as<br><br>
defined by the following claims.<br><br><br>
