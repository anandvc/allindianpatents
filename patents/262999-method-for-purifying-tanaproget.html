PURIFIED FORM OF TANAPROGET<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Intracellular receptors (IR) form a class of structurally related gene regulators<br>
known as "ligand dependent transcription factors". The steroid receptor family is a<br>
subset of the IR family, including progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER),<br>
androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor<br>
(MR).<br>
The natural hormone, or ligand, for the PR is the steroid progesterone, but<br>
synthetic compounds, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or levonorgestrel, have<br>
been made which also serve as ligands. Once a ligand is present in the fluid<br>
surrounding a cell, it passes through the membrane via passive diffusion, and binds to<br>
the IR to create a receptor/ligand complex. This complex binds to specific gene<br>
promoters present in the cell's DNA. Once bound to the DNA the complex modulates<br>
the production of mRNA and protein encoded by that gene.<br>
A compound that binds to an IR and mimics the action of the natural hormone<br>
is termed an agonist, whilst a compound which inhibits the effect of the hormone is an<br>
antagonist.<br>
PR agonists (natural and synthetic) are known to play an important role in the<br>
health of women. PR agonists are used in birth control compositions, typically in the<br>
presence of an ER agonist, alternatively they may be used in conjunction with a PR<br>
antagonist. ER agonists are used to treat the symptoms of menopause, but have been<br>
associated with a proliferative effect on the uterus which can lead to an increased risk<br>
of uterine cancers. Co-administration of a PR agonist reduces/ablates that risk.<br>
Tanaproget, 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1 -benzoxazin-6-yl)- 1H-<br>
pyrrole-2-carbonitrile, is a progesterone receptor modulator and is effective in<br>
contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and treating carcinomas and<br>
adenocarcinomas, dysfunctional bleeding, uterine leiomyomata, endometriosis, and<br>
polycystic ovary syndrome.<br>
What is needed in the art are other forms of tanaproget for use in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing micronized tanaproget Form I,<br>
purified tanaproget Form I, and micronized and purified tanaproget Form I are<br>
provided and discussed herein.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/116498<br><br>
PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
As used herein, the term "tanaproget" refers to 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-l,4-<br>
dihydro-2H-3,l-benzoxazm-6-yl)4-methyl-lH-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile.<br>
The term "purified" as used herein preferably refers to tanaproget that contains<br>
less than about 1% impurities. In one example, purified tanaproget contains less than<br>
about 0.5% impurities. In another example, purified tanaproget contains less than or<br>
equal to about 0.36% impurities. Desirably, purified tanaproget is about 99.5% pure.<br>
The term "solvent" as used herein refers to a solvent in which tanaproget has<br>
acceptable, moderate, good, or complete solubility. Similarly, the term "anti-solvent"<br>
as used herein refers to a solvent in which tanaproget has limited, reduced, or no<br>
solubility.<br>
A. Micronized Tanaproget<br>
Tanaproget Form I can be micronized under nitrogen and conventional<br>
micronizing techniques, for example with a Trost or jet mill, applied to non-<br>
micronized tanaproget. One method of preparation of non-micronized tanaproget is<br>
described in US Patent No. 6,436,929, and generally in US Patent Application<br>
Publication No. US-2005-0272702-A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
However, it is not limited to the method by which the non-micronized tanaproget<br>
Form I is produced.<br>
Micronized tanaproget Form I typically has a median particle size of less than<br>
about 20 pim, desirably less than about 15 /mi, and more desirably less than about 10<br>
pan.. Specifically, 90% of the particles are less than or equal to about 20 (im and 50%<br>
are less than or equal to about 15 [ita as determined by the Malvern method, which is<br>
readily understood by one of skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions are prepared by dry mixing micronized<br>
tanaproget, based upon the total weight of the unit dose, with the other components of<br>
the composition.<br>
As referred to herein below, the term "wt/wt" refers to the weight of one<br>
component based on the total weight of the composition. Typically, this ratio does not<br>
include the weight of the capsule, the weight of any filler utilized in the capsule, and<br>
seal coating, if so utilized.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/116498<br><br>
PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
Ia one embodiment, micronized 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-3,l-<br>
benzoxazin-6-yl)-l-methyl-lH-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile Form I which has a particle size<br>
less than about 20 urn is provided.<br>
B. Purification of Tanaproget<br>
Also provided is purified tanaproget Form I that is more suitable for<br>
administration in a pharmaceutical composition. Typically, the unpurified tanaproget<br>
is micronized prior to purification.<br>
The inventors have found that the purified tanaproget Form I provided herein<br>
is stable and less likely to convert to another polymorph during storage of either<br>
purified tanaproget Form I alone or in combination with other agents/excipients.<br>
In one embodiment, tanaproget Form I is purified as described in US Patent<br>
Application Publication No. US-2005-0272702-A1, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. However, it is not limited to the method by which the non-micronized<br>
tanaproget Form I is produced.<br>
In another embodiment, tanaproget Form I is purified by recrystallization. The<br>
recrystallization can be performed using a solvent or solvent system. A number of<br>
solvents can be utilized to purify the tanaproget Form I and include ethyl acetate,<br>
acetone, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, solvent systems can be utilized in<br>
which one reagent of the system is a solvent capable of dissolving the tanaproget<br>
Form I and a second reagent of the solvent system is an anti-solvent. Desirable<br>
solvent/anti-solvent systems that are useful include, without limitation,<br>
acetone/tetrahydrofuran, acetone/methanol, acetone/toluene, and acetone/water.<br>
Desirably, tanaproget Form I is purified by recrystallization from acetone/water.<br>
Typically, tanaproget Form I is purified by dissolving unpurified tanaproget in<br>
hot acetone to form a solution, the acetone solution is concentrated, water is mixed<br>
with the concentrated acetone solution, and the concentrated acetone/water solution is<br>
cooled to room temperature.<br>
In a further embodiment, tanaproget Form I is dissolved in acetone and the<br>
solution is heated to about 45 to about 51 °C. After circulating the heated solution<br>
through a carbon filter for at least about 4 hours, the filtered solution is concentrated<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/116498<br><br>
PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
using procedures known to those of skill in the art. After adding water to the<br>
concentrated solution, desirably at a rate which does not cool the refluxing acetone<br>
solution, the acetone/water solution is cooled to about -6 to about 0°C. Desirably, the<br>
acetone/water solution is cooled at a rate of less than about 0.5 °C/minute. After<br>
holding the cooled solution at the reduced temperature for at least about 3 hours, the<br>
precipitated, purified tanaproget Form I is collected using filtration. The collected<br>
solid is washed with a water/acetone mixture, desirably washing the solid twice with a<br>
1:1 water/acetone mixture. The washed purified tanaproget Form I is then dried at<br>
less than 35 °C for about 4 hours. Further drying at less than about 50 °C is<br>
performed to remove residual acetone/water as measured by spectroscopic methods.<br>
Typically, the impurities still present in purified tanaproget Form I include<br>
residual acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or water. In one example, purified tanaproget<br>
Form I contains less than about 0.1 % water, hi another example, purified tanaproget<br>
Form I contains less than or equal to about 0.07% water.<br>
In one embodiment, a purified Form I of 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-l,4-<br>
dihydro-2H-3,l-berizoxazin-6-yl)-l-methyl-lH-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile having a<br>
differential scanning calorimetry thermogram having an endotherm with a TonSet at<br>
about 230 °C; and an X-ray diffraction peak pattern comprising peaks at 20 of about<br>

C. Characterizing Purified Tanaproget<br>
Purified tanaproget Form I can be characterized using several spectroscopic<br>
techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance (proton and carbon), mass<br>
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, chromatography such as high performance liquid<br>
chromatography, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, among<br>
others. Desirably, the spectra obtained on purified tanaproget Form I using these<br>

E. Methods of Using Purified Tanaproget<br>
Further provided are methods of delivering purified tanaproget Form I to a<br>
patient, where the method includes administering purified tanaproget Form I.<br>
The dosage requirements of purified tanaproget Form I may vary based on the<br>
severity of the symptoms presented and the particular subject being treated.<br>
Treatment can be initiated with small dosages less than the optimum dose of purified<br>
tanaproget Form I. Thereafter the dosage is increased until the optimum effect under<br>
the circumstances is reached. Precise dosages will be determined by the administering<br>
physician based on experience with the individual subject treated. In general, purified<br>
tanaproget Form I is most desirably administered at a concentration that will generally<br>
afford effective results without causing any unacceptable harmful or deleterious side<br>
effects. For example, an effective amount of purified tanaproget Form I is generally,<br>
e.g., about 0.05 mg to about 1 mg, about 0.05 mg to about 0.3 mg, about 0.05 mg,<br>
about 0.075 mg, about 0.1 mg, about 0.15 mg, about 0.2 mg, or about 0.3 mg.<br>

WO 2006/116498<br><br>
PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
Purified tanaproget Form I is therefore useful in contraception and hormone<br>
replacement therapy. Purified tanaproget Form I is also useful in contraception and<br>
the treatment and/or prevention of uterine myometrial fibroids, benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy, benign and malignant neoplastic disease, dysfunctional bleeding, uterine<br>
leiomyomata, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and carcinomas and<br>
adenocarcinomas of the pituitary, endometrium, kidney, ovary, breast, colon, and<br>
prostate and other hormone-dependent tumors. Additional uses of purified tanaproget<br>
Form I include stimulation of food intake.<br>
Purified tanaproget Form I can be formulated in any form suitable for the<br>
desired route of delivery using a pharmaceuticaHy effective amount of purified<br>
tanaproget Form I. For example, purified tanaproget Form I can be delivered by a<br>
route such as oral, dermal, transdermal, intrabronchial, intranasal, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intranasal, vaginal, rectal,<br>
sublingual, intracranial, epidural, intratracheal, or by sustained release. Preferably,<br>
delivery is oral.<br>
For example, purified tanaproget Form I may be formulated for administration<br>
orally in such forms as tablets, capsules, microcapsules, dispersible powders,<br>
granules, or suspensions containing, for example, from about 0.05 to 5% of<br>
suspending agent, syrups containing, for example, from about 10 to 50% of sugar, and<br>
elixirs containing, for example, from about 20 to 50% ethanol, and the like. The<br>
preferred pharmaceutical compositions from the standpoint of ease of preparation and<br>
administration are solid compositions, particularly tablets and hard-filled or liquid-<br>
filled capsules.<br>
Purified tanaproget Form I may also be administered parenterally or<br>
intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of purified tanaproget Form I as a free<br>
base or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed<br>
with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in<br>
glycerol, liquid, polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the<br>
growth of microorganisms. Typically, such sterile injectable solutions or suspensions<br>
contain from about 0.05 to 5% suspending agent in an isotonic medium. Such<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/116498<br><br>
PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from about 25 to about 90% of<br>
the active ingredient in combination with the carrier, more usually between about 5%<br>
and 60% by weight.<br>
In another embodiment, purified tanaproget Form I is delivered intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, parenterally and intraperitoneally in the form of<br>
sterile injectable solutions, suspensions, dispersions, and powders which are fluid to<br>
the extent that easy syringe ability exits. Such injectable compositions are sterile,<br>
stable under conditions of manufacture and storage, and free of the contaminating<br>
action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.<br>
The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,<br>
water, ethanol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), oils,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Preferably the liquid carrier is water. In one embodiment, the<br>
oil is vegetable oil. Optionally, the liquid carrier contains a suspending agent. In<br>

PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
membranes covering a reservoir contain the active reagents, or a matrix containing the<br>
reactive reagents.<br>
The use of sustained delivery devices can be desirable, in order to avoid the<br>
necessity for the patient to take medications on a daily basis. The term "sustained<br>
delivery" is used herein to refer to delaying the release of an active agent, i.e., purified<br>
tanaproget Form I, until after placement in a delivery environment, followed by a<br>
sustained release of the agent at a later time. A number of sustained delivery devices<br>
are known in the art and include hydrogels (US Patent Nos. 5,266,325; 4,959,217;<br>
5,292,515), osmotic pumps (US Patent Nos. 4,295,987 and 5,273,752 and European<br>
Patent No. 314,206, among others); hydrophobic membrane materials, such as<br>
ethylenemethacrylate (EMA) and ethylenevinylacetate (EVA); bioresorbable polymer<br>
systems (International Patent Publication No. WO 98/44964 and US Patent Nos.<br>
5,756,127 and 5,854,388); and other bioresorbable implant devices composed of, for<br>
example, polyesters, polyanhydrides, or lactic acid/glycolic acid copolymers (US<br>
Patent No. 5,817,343). For use in such sustained delivery devices, purified tanaproget<br>
Form I can be formulated as described herein. See, US Patent Nos. 3,845,770;<br>
3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719.<br>
Preferably, purified tanaproget Form lis formed into a suitable dosing unit for<br>
delivery to a patient. Suitable dosing units include oral dosing units, such as a directly<br>
compressible tablets, capsules, powders, suspensions, microcapsules, dispersible<br>
powders, granules, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and aerosols. Preferably, purified<br>
tanaproget Form I is compressed into a tablet, which is optionally added to a capsule,<br>
or purified tanaproget Form I is added directly to a capsule. Purified tanaproget Form<br>
I can also be formulated for delivery by other suitable routes. These dosing units are<br>
readily prepared using the methods described herein and those known to those of skill<br>
in the art.<br>
Solid forms, including tablets, caplets, and capsules containing purified<br>
tanaproget Form I can be formed by dry blending purified tanaproget Form I with the<br>
components described above. In one embodiment, the capsules include<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hypromellose capsule, or a hard shell gelatin capsule.<br>
The tablets or caplets that contain tanaproget are optionally film-coated. Suitable<br>

WO 2006/116498<br><br>
PCT/US2006/015813<br><br>
film-coatings are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the film-coating can<br>
be selected from among polymers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, ethyl<br>
cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and combinations thereof.<br>
A pharmaceutically effective amount of purified tanaproget Form I can vary<br>
depending on the other components of the composition being delivered, mode of<br>
delivery, severity of the condition being treated, the patient's agent and weight, and<br>
any other active ingredients used in the composition. The dosing regimen can also be<br>
adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. Several divided doses can be<br>
delivered daily, e.g., in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day, or a single dose can be<br>
delivered. The dose can however be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated<br>
by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. In one embodiment, the delivery is on a<br>
daily, weekly, or monthly basis. In another embodiment, the delivery is on a daily<br>
delivery. However, daily dosages can be lowered or raised based on the periodic<br>
delivery.<br>
It is contemplated that when purified tanaproget Form I is used for<br>
contraception or hormone replacement therapy, it can be administered in conjunction<br>
with one or more other progesterone receptor agonists, estrogen receptor agonists,<br>
progesterone receptor antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, among<br>
others.<br>
When utilized for treating neoplastic disease, carcinomas, and<br>
adenocarcinomas, purified tanaproget Form I can be administered in conjunction with<br>
one or more chemotherapeutic agents which can readily be selected by one of skill in<br>
the art.<br>

(0.02%). The purified tanaproget weighed 192 g (76.8% yield, purity 99.42% by<br>
HPLC area%, mp 228-229 °C, Pd 
Example 5 - Larger Scale Purification of Tanaproget With Concentration<br>
Tanaproget (83 g) was dissolved in acetone (820 mL) at 55 °C. The solution<br>
was cooled to 45 °C, Darco® G66 charcoal (4 g) was added and the mixture was re-<br>
heated to reflux and kept at reflux for 15 min. The batch was filtered through a layer<br>
of the Celite® reagent on a sintered glass funnel. The flask was rinsed with acetone<br>
(100 mL) and transferred onto the funnel. The filter cake was washed with acetone (3<br>
x 150 mL). The combined filtrates were transferred into a distillation set and part of<br>
the solvent (800 mL) was collected. The concentrate was cooled to 55 °C and water<br>
(120 mL) was added dropwise while maintaining the temperature until a noticeable<br>
cloudiness was observed. The batch was re-heated to reflux to complete dissolution.<br>
The solution was allowed to cool down to ambient temperature. Crystallization was<br>
observed starting at about 40 °C. The batch was cooled further to -5 °C and stirred at<br>
this temperature for 1 hour. The solids were filtered through a sintered glass and<br>
washed with 1:1 vol. acetone:water (2 x 50 mL). The cake was air-dried for 6 hours<br>
and further dried in a vacuum oven at 45 °C to a constant weight (67.2 g, 81% yield,<br>
purity 99.4% by HPLC area%, mp 229.2-230.5 °C, Pd none detectable).<br>
