				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to the field of geophysical prospecting. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to the field of marine seismic exploration. Specifically, the<br>
invention relates to a method and a system for combining signals of pressure sensors and<br>
particle motion sensors in marine seismic streamers.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	In seismic exploration, geophysical data are obtained by applying acoustic<br>
energy to the earth from an acoustic; source and detecting seismic energy reflected from<br>
interfaces between different layers in subsurface formations. The seismic wavefield is reflected<br>
when there is a difference in acoustic impedance between the layer above the interface and the<br>
layer below the interface. When us ng towed streamers in marine seismic exploration, a<br>
seismic streamer is towed behind an exploration vessel at a water depth typically between<br>
about six to about nine meters, but can be towed shallower or deeper. Hydrophones are<br>
included in the streamer cable for detecting seismic signals. A hydrophone is a submersible<br>
pressure gradient sensor that converts pressure waves into electrical or optical signals that are<br>
typically recorded for signal processing, and evaluated to estimate characteristics of the<br>
subsurface of the earth.<br>
[0003]	In a typical geophysical exploration configuration, a plurality of<br>
streamer cables are towed behind a vessel. One or more seismic<br>
sources are also normally towed behind the<br><br>
vessel. The seismic source, which typically is, an airgun array, but may also be a water gun<br>
array or other type of source known to those of ordinary skill in the art, transmits seismic<br>
energy or waves into the earth and the waves are reflected back by reflectors in the earth and<br>
recorded by sensors in the streamers. Paravanes are typically employed to maintain the<br>
cables in the desired lateral position while being towed. Alternatively, the seismic cables are<br>
maintained at a substantially stationary position in a body of water, either floating at a<br>
selected depth or lying on the bottom of the body of water, in which case the source may be<br>
towed behind a vessel to generate acoustic energy at varying locations, or the source may also<br>
be maintained in a stationary position.<br>
[0004] After the reflected wave reaches the streamer cable, the wave continues to<br>
propagate to the water/air interface at the water surface, from which the wave is reflected<br>
downwardly, and is again detected by the hydrophones in the streamer cable. The water<br>
surface is a good reflector and the re Election coefficient at the water surface is nearly unity in<br>
magnitude and is negative in sign for pressure signals. The waves reflected at the surface<br>
will thus be phase-shifted 180 degrees relative to the upwardly propagating waves. The<br>
downwardly propagating wave recorded by the receivers is commonly referred to as the<br>
surface reflection or the "ghost" signal. Because of the surface reflection, the water surface<br>
acts like a filter, which creates spectral notches in the recorded signal, making it difficult to<br>
record data outside a selected bandwidth. Because of the influence of the surface reflection,<br>
some frequencies in the recorded signal are amplified and some frequencies are attenuated.<br>
[0005] Maximum attenuation will occur at frequencies for which the propagation distance<br>
between the detecting hydrophone and the water surface is equal to one-half wavelength.<br>
Maximum amplification will occur at frequencies for which the propagation distance between<br>
the detecting hydrophone and the water surface is one-quarter wavelength. The wavelength<br>
of the acoustic wave is equal to the velocity divided by the frequency, and the velocity of an<br>
acoustic wave in water is about 1500 meters/second. Accordingly, the location in the<br>
frequency spectrum of the resulting spectral notch is readily determinable. For example, for a<br>
seismic streamer at a depth of 7 meters, and waves with vertical incidence, maximum<br>
attenuation will occur at a frequency of about 107 Hz and maximum amplification will occur<br>
at a frequency of about 54 Hz.<br>
[0006] It has not been common practice to tow streamer cables deeper than about nine<br>
meters because the location of the spectral notch in the frequency spectrum of the signal<br>
detected by a hydrophone substantially diminishes the utility of the recorded data. It has also<br>
not been common practice to tow streamer cables at depth less than six meters, because of the<br><br>
significant increase in surface related noise induced in the seismic streamer data.<br>
[0007] It is also common to perform marine seismic operations in which sensors are<br>
deployed at the water bottom. Such operations are typically referred to as "ocean bottom<br>
seismic" operations. In ocean bottom seismic operations, both pressure sensors<br>
(hydrophones) and particle motion sensors (geophones, accelerometers) are deployed at the<br>
ocean floor to record seismic data.<br>
[0008] A particle motion sensor, such as a geophone, has directional sensitivity, whereas<br>
a pressure sensor, such as hydrophone, does not. Accordingly, the upgoing wavefield signals<br>
detected by a geophone and hydrophone located close together will be in phase, while the<br>
downgoing wavefield signals will be recorded 180 degrees out of phase. Various techniques<br>
have been proposed for using this phase difference to reduce the spectral notches caused by<br>
the surface reflection and, if the recordings are made on the seafloor, to attenuate water borne<br>
multiples. It should be noted that an alternative to having the geophone and hydrophone co-<br>
located, is to have sufficient spatial density of sensors so that the respective wavefields<br>
recorded by the hydrophone and geophone can be interpolated or extrapolated to produce the<br>
two wavefields at the same location.<br>
[0009] U.S. Patent No. 4,486,865 to Ruehle, for example, teaches a system for<br>
suppressing ghost reflections by combining the outputs of pressure and velocity detectors.<br>
The detectors are paired, one pressure detector and one velocity detector in each pair. A filter<br>
is said to change the frequency content of at least one of the detectors so that the ghost<br>
reflections cancel when the outputs are combined.<br>
[0010] U.S. Patent No. 5,621,700 to Moldovenu also teaches using at least one sensor<br>
pair comprising a pressure sensor and a velocity sensor in an ocean bottom cable in a method<br>
for attenuating ghosts and water layer reverberations.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent No. 4,935,903 to Sanders et al. teaches a marine seismic reflection<br>
prospecting system that detects seismic Waves traveling in water by pressure sensor-particle<br>
velocity sensor pairs (e.g., hydrophoae-geophone pairs) or alternately, vertically-spaced<br>
pressure sensors. Instead of filtering to eliminate ghost reflection data, the system calls for<br>
enhancing primary reflection data for use in pre-stack processing by adding ghost data.<br>
[0012] U.S. Patent 4,979,150 to Barr provides a method for marine seismic prospecting<br>
said to attenuate coherent noise resulting from water column reverberation by applying a<br>
scale factor to the output of a pressure transducer and a particle velocity transducer positioned<br>
substantially adjacent to one another in the water. It is stated in the patent that the<br>
transducers may be positioned either on the ocean bottom or at a location in the water above<br><br>
the bottom, although the ocean bottom is said to be preferred.<br>
[0013] Co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/233,266, filed on August 30, 2002,<br>
entitled "Apparatus and Method for Multicomponent Marine Geophysical Data Gathering",<br>
with a co-inventor of the present invention and assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention, describes a particle motion sensor for use in a streamer cable and a method for<br>
equalizing and combining the output signals of the particle motion sensor and a co-located<br>
pressure gradient sensor.<br>
[0014] As the cited patents show, it is well known in the art that pressure and particle<br>
motion signals can be combined to derive both the up-going and the down-going wavefield.<br>
For sea floor recordings, the up-go ng and down-going wavefields may subsequently be<br>
combined to remove the effect of the surface reflection and to attenuate water borne multiples<br>
in the seismic signal. For towed streamer applications, however, the particle motion signal<br>
has been regarded as having limited utility because of the high noise level in the particle<br>
motion signal. However, if particle motion signals could be provided for towed streamer<br>
acquisition, the effect of the surface re flection could be removed from the data.<br>
[0015] Co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/621,222, filed on July 16, 2003,<br>
entitled "Method for Seismic Exploration Utilizing Motion Sensor and Pressure Sensor<br>
Data", with a co-inventor of the present invention and assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention, describes a procedure for attenuating multiples by combining up- and down-going<br>
wavefields, measured in the water column, where the wavefields are calculated from<br>
combining pressure sensors like hydrophones and motion sensors like geophones. The<br>
procedure assumes, however, that both the pressure and the motion data have the same<br>
bandwidth.<br>
[0016] It has been difficult to achieve the same bandwidth in the motion sensor data as in<br>
the pressure sensor data, however, because of the noise induced by vibrations in the streamer,<br>
which is sensed by the particle motion sensors. The noise is, however, mainly confined to<br>
lower frequencies. One way to reduce the noise is to have several sensors in series or in<br>
parallel. This approach, however, does not always reduce the noise enough to yield a signal-<br>
to-noise ratio satisfactory for further seismic processing.<br>
[0017] Thus, a need exists for a method for obtaining a useful particle motion signal with<br>
a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio at low frequencies. In particular, a need exists for a<br>
method to generate a particle motion signal with substantially the same bandwidth as a<br>
recorded pressure signal, for particle motion and pressure sensors located in a towed marine<br>
seismic streamer.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The present invention provides a method for combining signals of a pressure<br>
sensor and a particle motion sensor recorded in a marine seismic streamer to reduce noise in<br>
the combined pressure sensor signal and particle motion sensor signal, the recorded pressure<br>
sensor signal having a bandwidth comprising a first frequency range and a second frequency<br>
range, the first frequency range being at lower frequencies than the frequencies of the second<br>
frequency range, and the recorded particle motion sensor signal having a bandwidth comprising<br>
at least the second frequency range, :said method comprising :<br>
calculating a particle motion sensor signal in the first frequency range from the<br>
recorded pressure sensor signal, thereby generating a simulated particle motion sensor signal<br>
in the first frequency range ;<br>
merging the simulated particle motion sensor signal only in the first frequency range<br>
with the recorded particle motion sensor signal in the second frequency range to generate<br>
a merged particle motion sensor signal having substantially the same bandwidth as the<br>
bandwidth of the recorded pressure sensor signal; and<br>
combining the recorded pressure sensor signal and the merged particle motion<br>
sensor signal for further processing.<br>
Thus, this invention relates to a method for combining signals of pressure sensors and<br>
particle motion sensors located in marine seismic streamers. Then, a particle motion sensor<br>
signal is calculated at low frequencies from the pressure sensor signal, using the depth of the<br>
marine seismic streamer and the sound wave velocity in water.<br>
[0019]	In a further embodiment of the invention, a full three-dimensional mathematical<br>
solution takes account of the fact that the energy returning from the earth arrives at the<br>
receivers at a range of angles of incidence, rather than solely in the in-line direction or at a<br>
given direction, such as the vertical.<br>

[0030] While the invention will be described in connection with its preferred<br>
embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to these. On the contrary,<br>
the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents that may be<br>
included within the scope of the inver tion, as defined by the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0031] FIG. 1 shows a schematic illustration (not drawn to scale) of a method for<br>
acquiring marine seismic data that can be used with the method of the invention. A seismic<br>
vessel 101 is located in a body of water 102 above the earth 103. Beneath the water bottom<br>
104, the earth 103 contains subterranean formations of interest such as layer 105 positioned<br>
between upper boundary 106 and lower boundary 107. The seismic vessel 101 travels on the<br>
water surface 108 and contains seismic acquisition control equipment, designated generally at<br>
109. The seismic acquisition control equipment 109 includes navigation control, seismic<br>
source control, seismic sensor control, and recording equipment, all of types well known in<br>
the art of seismic acquisition.<br>
[0032] The seismic acquisition control equipment 109 causes a seismic source 110 towed<br>
in the body of water 102 by the seismic vessel 101 to actuate at selected times. The seismic<br>
source 110 may be of any type well known in the art of seismic acquisition, including airguns<br>
or water guns, or particularly, arrays of airguns. Seismic streamers 111 are also towed in the<br>
body of water 102 by the seismic vessel 101 to record the acoustic wavefields initiated by the<br>
seismic source 110 and reflected from interfaces in the environment. Although only one<br>
seismic streamer 111 is shown here for illustrative purposes, typically a plurality of seismic<br>
streamers 111 are towed behind the seismic vessel 101. The seismic streamers 111 contain<br>
sensors to detect the reflected wavefields initiated by the seismic source 110.<br>
Conventionally, the seismic streamers 111 contained pressure sensors such as hydrophones<br>
112, but dual sensor seismic streamers 111 also contain water particle motion sensors such as<br>
geophones 113. The hydrophones 112 and geophones 113 are typically co-located in pairs or<br>
pairs of sensor arrays at regular intervals along the seismic streamers 111. However, the type<br>
of sensors 112, 113 or their location in the seismic streamers 111 is not intended to be a<br>
limitation on the present invention.<br>
[0033] Each time the seismic source 110 is actuated, an acoustic wavefield travels both<br>
upwardly or downwardly in spherically expanding wave fronts. The propagation of the wave<br><br>
fronts will be illustrated herein by ray paths which are perpendicular to the wave fronts. The<br>
upwardly traveling wavefield, designated by ray path 114, will reflect off the water-air<br>
interface at the water surface 108 anc then travel downwardly, as in ray path 115, where the<br>
wavefield may be detected by the hydrophones 112 and geophones 113 in the seismic<br>
streamers 111. Unfortunately, such a reflection at the water surface 108, as in ray path 115<br>
contains no useful information about the subterranean formations of interest. However, such<br>
surface reflections, also known as ghosts, act like secondary seismic sources with a time<br>
delay.<br>
[0034] The downwardly traveling wavefield, in ray path 116, will reflect off the earth-<br>
water interface at the water bottom 104 and then travel upwardly, as in ray path 117, where<br>
the wavefield may be detected by the hydrophones 112 and geophones 113. Such a reflection<br>
at the water bottom 104, as in ray path 117, contains information about the water bottom 104.<br>
Ray path 117 is an example of a primary reflection, having one reflection in the subterranean<br>
earth. The downwardly traveling wavefield, as in ray path 116, may transmit through the<br>
water bottom 104 as in ray path 118, reflect off a layer boundary, such as 107, of a layer,<br>
such as 105, and then travel upwardly, is in ray path 119. The upwardly traveling wavefield,<br>
ray path 119, may then be detected by the hydrophones 112 and geophones 113. Such a<br>
reflection off a layer boundary 107 contains useful information about a formation of interest<br>
105 and is also an example of a primary reflection, having one reflection in the subterranean<br>
earth.<br>
[0035] Unfortunately, the acoustic wavefields will continue to reflect off interfaces such<br>
as the water bottom 104, water surface 108, and layer boundaries 106, 107 in combinations.<br>
For example, the upwardly traveling wavefield in ray path 117 will reflect off the water<br>
surface 108, continue traveling downwardly in ray path 120, may reflect off the water bottom<br>
104, and continue traveling upwardly again in ray path 121, where the wavefield may be<br>
detected by the hydrophones 112 and geophones 113. Ray path 121 is an example of a<br>
multiple reflection, also called simply a "multiple", having multiple reflections from<br>
interfaces. Similarly, the upwardly traveling wavefield in ray path 119 will reflect off the<br>
water surface 108, continue traveling downwardly in ray path 122, may reflect off a layer<br>
boundary 106 and continue traveling upwardly again in ray path 123, where the wavefield<br>
may be detected by the hydrophones 112 and geophones 113. Ray path 123 is another<br>
example of a multiple reflection, also having multiple reflections in the subterranean earth.<br>
Multiple reflections contain redundant information about the formations of interest and<br>
commonly are removed from seismic data before further processing.<br><br>
[0036] The invention is a method for combining signals of pressure sensors (typically<br>
hydrophones) and particle motion sensors (typically geophones or accelerometers) located in<br>
seismic streamers. The combined signals can then be utilized to generate the up- and down-<br>
going wavefields, which are useful for further seismic processing, such as attenuation of<br>
multiples in marine seismic data. Since a recorded particle motion signal is often<br>
contaminated by low frequency noise due to the vibrations in a towed streamer, the signal-to-<br>
noise ratio for the combined signals would be poor. The particle motion signal may be<br>
calculated from the pressure sensor signal within a given frequency range if the spectrum of<br>
the pressure sensor signal has a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio within this frequency range<br>
(and has no notches within this frequency range) and if the depth of the pressure and particle<br>
motion sensors is known. If the depth to the sensors is unknown, the depth can be calculated<br>
from the frequency of the spectral notches introduced by the surface reflection, a process<br>
which is well known in the art.<br>
[0037] The low frequency part of the particle motion signal will typically need to be<br>
replaced because it has a low signal-to-noise ratio. This low frequency part will be referred<br>
to as the 'Frequency Range'. The corresponding portion of the pressure sensor signal to be<br>
used for calculating the particle motion signal, will typically have a good signal-to-noise ratio<br>
in the Frequency Range. Therefore, the depth of the pressure sensor is preferably chosen so<br>
that the frequency of the first spectral notch in the pressure sensor signal caused by the<br>
surface reflection is higher than the Frequency Range.<br>
[0038] The method of the invention is particularly useful for towed marine seismic<br>
streamers, since the vibration of a towed streamer adds a significant amount of noise to the<br>
signal of the particle motion sensor. Thus the method of the invention will be illustrated in<br>
terms of towed streamers.<br>
[0039] The method of the invention employs; pressure sensors that are responsive to<br>
pressure changes in the medium to which the pressure sensors are coupled. The medium<br>
typically is water. For clarity only, the method of the invention will be illustrated by the use<br>
of hydrophones, but this is not meant to imit the invention.<br>
[0040] The method of the invention employs particle motion sensors that are responsive<br>
to motions in the particles of the water to which the motion sensors are coupled. In general,<br>
particle motion sensors may be responsive to the displacement of the particles, the velocity of<br>
the particles, or the acceleration of the particles in the medium. In the present invention,<br>
particle velocity sensors are preferred. Thus, if motion sensors are used which are responsive<br>
to position, then preferably the positior signal is differentiated to convert it to a velocity<br><br>
signal by computational means well known in the art. If motion sensors are used which are<br>
responsive to acceleration (typically called accelerometers), then preferably the acceleration<br>
signal is integrated to convert it to a velocity signal by computational means well known in<br>
the art.<br>
[0041] In an alternative embodiment of the invention, multi-component motion sensors<br>
are employed in the seismic cable. For clarity only, this embodiment of the invention will be<br>
illustrated by the use of geophones but this is not meant to limit the invention. In the<br>
particular example of a three-component geophone, a geophone is mounted to sense particle<br>
velocity in the vertical direction. This geophone is called a vertical geophone. Two<br>
geophones are mounted in orthogonal directions with respect to each other, and to the<br>
vertically mounted geophone, to sense horizontal motion. Typically, a three-component<br>
geophone is oriented to sense motion in the vertical direction, in an in-line direction, and in a<br>
cross-line direction. Positioning these geophones in these three directions enables the<br>
propagation direction of an incoming signal to be detected. It also enables the detection of<br>
strumming or other mechanical behavior of the seismic cable. For clarity, the method of the<br>
invention will be illustrated by the use of vertical geophones, but this is not meant to limit the<br>
invention.<br>
[0042] Accelerometers could be used as particle motion sensors as an alternative to use of<br>
geophones, although the output signal will need to be integrated to obtain velocity. Some<br>
accelerometers generate an output signal that is indicative of the variation in orientation of<br>
the accelerometer from a selected orientation. Accordingly, if sets of two accelerometers (for<br>
situations in which the in-line directior is known) or sets of three accelerometers (if the in-<br>
line direction is not known) are utilized the sensor orientation may be computed and it is not<br>
necessary to maintain the accelerometers in a specific orientation.<br>
[0043] The method of the invention will be illustrated by the discussion with reference to<br>
the flowchart presented in FIG. 2. The method of the invention is illustrated herein by the<br>
use of hydrophones as pressure sensors and vertical geophones as particle motion sensors, but<br>
this is not meant to limit the invention. In the examples discussed below with reference to<br>
FIGS. 3-9, the hydrophone and geophone systems are positioned 0.7 m apart in a towed<br>
seismic streamer with a length of 1300 in, at a depth of 13 m, and with a seismic source at a<br>
depth of 7 m. The horizontal distance between the source and the hydrophone/geophone<br>
systems was approximately 1300 m. The specifics of these examples are for illustrative<br>
purposes only and are not intended to limit the invention.<br>
[0044] FIG. 2 shows a flowchart illustrating the processing steps of an embodiment of the<br><br>
method of the invention for calculating a geophone signal from a hydrophone signal and then<br>
combining signals from hydrophones: and geophones located in marine seismic streamers.<br>
[0045] In the following discussion, signals in the space-time domain are denoted by<br>
lower case letters, while the same signals in the frequency wave-number domain are denoted<br>
by the corresponding upper case (capital) letters<br>
[0046] In the preferred embodiment of the invention, x (space) is a vector and equal to<br>
(x, y), where x is the direction along the streamers and y is the cross line direction. In other<br>
embodiments y can be kept constant so that each cable is analyzed separately. One possible<br>
reason to select this option could be that the cables are deployed at significant different<br>
depths. Also, in other embodiment!, also x can be kept constant so that each sensor is<br>
analyzed individually. The latter will typically be a preferred option if the depth of the<br>
sensors within each cable varies significantly.<br>
[0047] In the preferred embodiment of the invention, k (wave number) is a vector and<br>
equal to (kx, ky), where kx is the wave number in the x direction and ky is the wave number in<br>
the y direction. In other embodiments, ky can be disregarded so that each cable is analyzed<br>
separately. In this case a fixed direction of cross line propagation for each cable is selected.<br>
This direction could be vertical or any other direction. One possible reason to select this<br>
option could be that the cables are deployed at significantly different depths. Also, in other<br>
embodiments, both kx and ky can be disregarded so that each sensor is analyzed individually<br>
and only the frequency spectrum of each recorded trace is used. In this case a fixed direction<br>
of propagation in both the in-line and cross-line direction is used for each sensor. The latter<br>
will typically be a preferred option if the depth of the sensors within each cable varies<br>
significantly. In this case the transformed data will be in the f-x domain.<br>
[0048] The discussion below uses examples from marine seismic exploration for targets<br>
at depths from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers, so called deep seismic exploration.<br>
The present invention is, however, applicable to exploration for both shallower and deeper<br>
targets.<br>
[0049] At step 21 of FIG. 2, a set of hydrophone data hsignal(x,t) and a corresponding<br>
set of geophone data 9signal(x,t) are transformed from the space-time domain to the<br>
frequency-wave number domain, yielding a transformed hydrophone signal Hsignal(f,k) and<br>
a transformed geophone signal Gsignal(f,k), respectively. Preferably, the transform is a<br>
Fourier Transform, but this is not a restriction of the invention.<br><br>
[0050] The method of the invention can be carried out in a variety of transformed<br>
domains, which separate the wavefield into angular components, including, but not limited to,<br>
wave number or slowness. The method of the invention is not restricted solely to the<br>
frequency-wave number domain ot to Fourier transforms. The frequency-wave number<br>
domain and the Fourier transform are merely used in the following for illustrative purposes.<br>
(0051] At step 22 in FIG. 2, the transformed hydrophone and geophone signals,<br>
Hsignal(f,k) and Gsignal(f,k), respectively, from step 21 are corrected for relative<br>
differences in the instrument transfer functions, which correspond to instrument impulse<br>
responses in the time domain. These corrections could either be correcting the amplitude and<br>
phase of the hydrophone data to match the geophone data, or, in an alternative embodiment,<br>
correcting the geophone data to match the hydrophone data, or, in a further alternative<br>
embodiment, correcting both data sets to a common basis. Correcting for relative differences<br>
in instrument impulse responses is well known in the art. Finally, an amplitude scaling equal<br>
to the inverse of the acoustic impedance in the water is preferably applied to the geophone<br>
data to correct for the relative differences in amplitudes of pressure and particle velocity.<br>
This is also well known in the art.<br>
[0052] At step 23 in FIG. 2, the corrected geophone signal Gsignal(f,k) from step 22 is<br>
further corrected for angle of incidence. While a. hydrophone records the total wavefield, a<br>
vertical geophone will only record the vertical part of the wavefield. This will be equal to the<br>
total wavefield only for signals which are propagating vertically, i.e. for which the angle of<br>
incidence Φ = 0. For any other values of Φ, the geophone signal needs to be scaled by:<br><br><br>
(2)<br>
and v is the velocity of sound in the water.<br>
[0053] The velocity of sound in the water is well known in the art to be close to 1500<br>
m/sec. So, if v is known, then Equation (2) shows a direct link between the angle of incident<br>
Φ and values of wave number k and frequency f . If v is not known for some reason, then it<br>
can be measured by methods well known in the art. Also, it can be seen from Equation (2)<br>
that cos(Φ) is real and different from zero for values of A: given by:<br><br>
[0054] Examples of single trace recordings where the corrections above have been<br>
applied (assuming vertical incident angle) are shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. FIG. 3 is a plot of<br>
amplitude versus time for a hydrophone signal recorded at 13 m depth. FIG. 4 is a plot of<br>
amplitude versus time for the corresponding geophone signal recorded simultaneously with<br>
the hydrophone signal from FIG. 3. The corresponding amplitude spectra (showing<br>
amplitude versus frequency) of the hydrophone and geophone signals are shown in FIG. 5.<br>
The solid line 51 is the spectrum of the hydrophone signal and the dotted line 52 is the<br>
spectrum of the geophone signal. The higher noise level in the geophone data can be seen by<br>
comparison of FIGS. 3 and 4. Also, it can be seen from FIG. 5 that the noise in the geophone<br>
signals is mainly confined to the lower frequencies 53.<br>
[0055] In step 24 in FIG. 2, a low frequency part of the geophone signal is calculated<br>
from the recorded hydrophone signal Thus, a data set Gcalculated(f,k) is generated from<br>
Hsignal(f,k) for f1 ≤ f ≤ f2 that is, for a Frequency Range [f1,f2]. In the following this<br>
procedure is described in detail.<br>
[0056] The hydrophone signal and the geophone signal can be expressed in terms of their<br>
up-going and down-going components and the hydrophone signal (pressure wavefield) is<br>
given by the equation:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
where<br>
is the up-going component and<br>
respectively, of the hydrophone signal<br>
wavefield) is given by:<br><br>
is the down-going component,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where<br><br>
is the up-going component and<br><br>
is the down-going component,<br><br><br>
respectively, of the geophone signal<br>
[0057] Assume that the up-going components of the hydrophone and geophone signals<br>
are the same, that is,<br><br>
Then, inserting Equation (6) into Equation (5) yields:<br><br>
[0058] Let τ be the surface reflection time delay, that is, the time delay between the direct<br>
upward propagating arrival of the wavefield and the corresponding reflection from the<br>
surface. Using the definition of cos(Φ) given by Equation (2), the time delay τ is given by:<br><br><br>
where D is the depth of the hydrophone and the geophone. The depth D may be determined<br>
by any means known in the art, such as by a depth sensor or a calculation. Assume that the<br>
reflection coefficient at the sea surface is c for pressure signals and, thus, -c for particle<br>
velocity signals. The absolute value of c is very close to unity. Also, as is well know in the<br>
art, a reflection coefficient is a function of incident angle and, in case of the sea surface<br>
which is not always flat, also a function of frequency. These are, however, minor effects with<br>
respect to the method of the invention and are thus not discussed further. Another well<br>
known but minor effect which is not i lcluded in the discussions below is the difference in<br>
geometrical spreading between the recorded direct arrival and the recorded corresponding<br>
surface reflection. Then, using τ, the down-going component of the hydrophone<br>
signal may be given by:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Similarly, the down-going component<br><br>
of the geophone signal may be given by:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0059] Inserting<br><br>
as given by Equations (9) and (10),<br><br>
respectively, into Equations (4) and (7), respectively, gives:<br><br>
[0060] Next, the hydrophone and geophone signals expressed in terms of their up-going<br>
and down-going components in Equations (11) and (12) are transformed to the frequency-<br><br>
Solving Equation (13) for the up-going component of the hydrophone signal yields:<br>
wave number domain. Preferably, the transform is a Fourier Transform, but this is not a<br>
restriction of the invention. Transforming Equation (11) to the frequency-wave number<br>
domain gives:<br><br><br>
[0061] As above, transforming Equation (12) to the frequency-wave number domain<br>
gives:<br><br>
[0062] Now, a geophone signal Gcalculated(f,k) may be calculated from the hydrophone<br>
signal Hsignal(f,k) in the frequency-wave number domain. Inserting H t (f,k) as given by<br>
Equation (14) into Equation (15) yields he geophone signal calculated from the hydrophone<br>
signal by:<br><br><br>
where frequency f is given by f1<f and wave number k is as in equation></f>
(16) may be used to calculate a geophone signal from the recorded hydrophone signal at low<br>
frequencies where the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded geophone signal is insufficient for<br>
processing needs.<br>
[0063] Equation (16) is stable if the denominator on the right hand side is different from<br>
zero. Assuming that c = -1 exactly, then the denominator equals 0 when<br>
1 = exp(-i2πfτ)<br>
(17)<br><br>
that is, for f = 0,<br><br>
Thus,f must be Larger than zero. A typical value will be 3 Hz.<br>
To avoid artifacts in the time domain, proper tapering, which is well known in the art, should<br>
be applied to the low-frequency part of the spectrum of the calculated geophone signal.<br>
[0064] As can be seen from Equation (8):<br><br>
which has its lowest value for Φ = 0, that is, for vertically propagating signals. This means<br>
that f2 must be less than v/2D. Assuming that the geophone signal is too noisy to be used for<br>
frequencies below fnoise, then f noice, <f2 v></f2>
[0065] Preferably, the difference between/ and fnoise should be large enough so that the<br>
calculated geophone signal from (15) can be compared and checked with the measured<br>
geophone signal. A range of overlapping frequencies is preferred to merge the calculated<br>
portion of the geophone signal with the measured portion. Typically f2 should be 5-10 Hz<br>
larger than fnoise. To maintain a good signal-to-noise ratio of the hydrophone signal,f2 should<br>
be significantly lower than vl2D and preferably not larger than around 75% of v/2D<br>
[0066] In the data examples shown in FIGS. 3-5, the depth D of the sensors is 13 m.<br>
Assuming a water velocity v of 1500 m/s gives a first notch in the hydrophone spectrum at<br>
around v/2D, or about 58 Hz. This indicates that f2 should be less than around 75% of v/2D,<br>
or about 43 Hz.<br>
[0067] In step 25 in FIG. 2, the calculated and the recorded part of the geophone signal<br><br><br>
Thus, w(f) = 0 fox f=fnoise and w(f)-l for f=f2 . The merged total geophone data set will<br>
then be:<br>
are merged into one data set. To avoid artifacts in the data, in particular in the time domain,<br>
the merger should preferably be done with a tapering zone. In practice this tapering zone will<br>
be the frequencies betweenfnoise and f2, even if a narrower frequency zone can be selected.<br>
[0068] Below is one method of applying weights to the two data sets before the merging<br>
of the two data sets. There are other ways of calculating weights which are well known in the<br>
art so this is not a restriction of the invention. A weight, w(f) is calculated as:<br><br>
[0069] There are several ways of calculating weights to merge signals which are well<br>
known in the art, and the one used above is just one example. Alternatively, it is possible to<br>
merge the amplitude and phase spectra of the two data sets separately. In this alternative<br>
embodiment, the actual weight function is complex.<br>
[0070] In the following example illustrated in FIGS. 6 - 9, the data from FIG. 5 will be<br>
used to illustrate the procedure in step 24 and 25 in FIG. 2. From FIG. 5, it can be estimated<br>
that fnoise is about 20 Hz. To get an interval to merge,f2 has been set to 25 Hz. FIG. 6 is a<br>
plot of the amplitude spectra of the hydrophone and geophone signals from FIG. 5. The solid<br>
line 61 is the spectrum of the hydrophone signal and the dotted line 62 is the spectrum of the<br>
geophone signal. The amplitude of the geophone signal 51 from FIG. 5 has been tapered<br>
with a linear function between 20 and 25 Hz and set to zero below 20 Hz (at reference<br>
number 63) to give the amplitude of the geophone signal 61 in FIG. 6. FIG. 7 includes a<br>
geophone signal 73 which has been calculated from the hydrophone signal from equation<br>
(11) in the 3-25 Hz frequency range, and linearly tapered on the low frequency side and<br><br>
between 20 and 25 Hz. The solid line 71 is the spectrum of the hydrophone signal and the<br>
dotted line 72 is the spectrum of the geophone signal taken from FIG. 6.<br>
[0071] FIG. 8 shows the amplitude spectra of the recorded hydrophone data 81 and the<br>
merged (constructed) geophone data 82. The geophone signal 82 has been merged using<br>
Equation (20). It can be seen that the hydrophone and geophone data sets now have<br>
essentially the same bandwidth.<br>
[0072] In step 26 in FIG. 2, the lull bandwidth constructed geophone data set and full<br>
bandwidth recorded hydrophone data set are added or subtracted to calculate the full<br>
bandwidth up- and down-going wavefield, respectively. This can be done by:<br><br>
where u(x,t) and d(x,t) are the up- and down-going wavefields, respectively. The separation<br>
can also be done in the frequency domain by:<br><br>
[0073] The amplitude spectrum of the up-going wavefield, |U(f)|, after summing the<br>
hydrophone 81 and geophone 82 data n FIG. 8 using Equation (23), is shown in FIG. 9. As<br>
can be seen from FIG. 9, the effect of the surface reflection on the receiver side is removed.<br>
The notch 91 at around 125 Hz is the surface reflection notch at the source side with the<br>
source at around 6 m depth.<br><br>

specific embodiments of this invention and that numerous changes, modifications, and<br>
alternatives to the disclosed embodiments can be made in accordance with the disclosure here<br>
without departing from the scope of tgh invention. The preceding description, therefore, is<br>
