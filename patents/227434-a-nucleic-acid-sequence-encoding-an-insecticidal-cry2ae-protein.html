				<td>NOVEL BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS INSECTICIDAL PROTEINS INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to new nucleic acid sequences, particularly DNA sequences, encoding insecticidal proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis strains. Particularly, new nucleic acid sequences, particularly DNA sequences encoding proteins designated as Cry2Ae. Cry2Af and Cry2Ag are provided which are useful to protect plants from insect damage. Also included herein are microorganisms and plants transfonned with a nucleic acid sequence, particularly a DNA sequence, encoding at least one of the newly isolated Cry2A proteins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(i) Field of the Invention:<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis (abbreviated herein as "Bt") is well known for its specific toxicity to insect pests, and has been used since almost a century to control insect pests of plants. In more recent years, transgenic plants expressing Bt proteins were made which were found to successfully control insect damage on plants (e.g., Vaeck et al., 1987, Jansens et al,, 1997).<br>
Despite the isolation of quite a number of insecticidal Bt genes, the search for new genes encoding insecticidal proteins continues. Indeed, insecticidal Bt proteins are known to have a relatively narrow target insect range compared to chemical insecticides. Also, having multiple toxins to the same target insect species allows<br>
•r •<br>
the use of proteins having different modes of action so that insect resistance development can be prevented or delayed. And, insecticidal Bt proteins with different amino acid sequences have different levels of insecticidal efficacy against specific insects, making it desirable to have several different insecticidal proteins available in order to be able to control the relevant insect pests of different crop plants.<br><br>
(ii) Description of Related Art:<br>
Previously, several types of Cry2A-proteins were identified (see Crickmore et a!.,<br>
1998, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The new Cry2Ae protein of this invention has the highest amino acid sequence<br>
identity to the Cry2Aa1 protein (Donovan et al.. GenBank accession number<br>
M31738), but still differs in about 9 percent of its amino acid sequence.<br>
The closest sequence identity to the Cry2Af protein was found in the Cry2Ab1<br>
protein (Widner and Whiteley, GenBank accession number M23724). but both<br>
proteins still differ in about 5 percent of their amino acid sequence.<br>
The closest sequence Identity to the Cry2Ag protein was found in the Cry2Ac1<br>
protein (Wu et a!., GenBank accession number X57252), but both proteins still<br>
differ in about 20 percent of their amino acid sequence.<br>
Further known Cry2A proteins include the Cry2Ad1 protein (Choi et a!.. 1999). and<br>
other Cry2Aa. Cry2Ab, and Cry2Ac proteins (Crickmore et al„ 1998). Cry2A-like<br>
proteins and DNA sequences encoding them are also shown in US patent<br>
5,338.544, in published PCT patent application WO 00/26371 and in published<br>
PCT patent application WO 98/40490.<br>
Expression of Cry2A-type proteins in plants has been described, e.g.. in Kota et al.<br>
(1999) and in published PCT patent application WO 00/26371.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention, a "nucleic acid sequence" refers to a DMA or RNA molecule in single or double stranded fonm, preferably a DNA or RNA, particularly a DNA, encoding any of the Cry2A proteins of this invention. An "isolated nucleic acid sequence", as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid sequence which is no longer in the natural environment where it was isolated from, e.g., the nucliec acid sequence in another bacterial host or in a plant nuclear genome.<br><br>
In accordance with this invention, the terms "protein" or "polypeptide" are used interchangeably to refer to a sequence of amino acids, without reference to any functionality, size, three-dimensional structures or origin. Hence, a fragment or portion of a Cry2A protein of the invention is still referred to herein as a "protein".<br>
In accordance with this invention, nucleic acid sequences, particularly DNA sequences, encoding new Bt Cry toxins have been isolated and characterized. The new genes were designated cry2Ae, cry2Af, cry2Ag and their encoded proteins Cry2Ae, Cry2Af and Cry2Ag,<br>
In accordance with this invention "Cry2Ae protein" refers to any protein comprising the smallest fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 which retains insecticidal activity (hereinafter referred to as "smallest toxic fragment"), particularly any protein comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 1 to the amino acid at position 625, particularly to the amino acid at position 632 in SEQ ID No. 2, This includes hybrids or chimeric proteins comprising the smallest toxic protein fragment, as well as proteins containing at least one of the three domains of the protein of SEQ ID No, 2, Also included in this definition are variants of the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 2, such as proteins having a sequence identity of at least 92 %. particulariy at least 93 %, 95 %. 96 %, 97 %, 98 % or 99 % at the amino acid sequence level, as determined using paioA^ise alignments using the GAP program of the Wisconsin package of GCG (Madison, Wisconsin, USA, version 10.0; use GCG defaults within the GAP program; for the amino acid sequence comparisons, use the blosum62 scoring matrix), preferably proteins having some, preferably 5-10, particulariy less than 5. amino acids added, replaced or deleted without significantly changing, preferably without changing, the insecticidal activity of the protein, e.g.. the Cry2Ae protein c SEQ ID No. 8.<br>
The term "DNA/protein comprising the sequence X", as used herein, refers to a DNA or protein including or containing at least the sequence X, so that other<br><br>

The N- and C-terminal amino acid sequence ends of the smallest toxic fragment are conveniently determined by amino acid sequence determination of the above fragments by techniques routinely available in the art. For the Cry2A protein fragments retaining insecticidal activity of this invention, typically N-terminal deletions can be made while little can be deleted at their C-terminal end. For the Cry2Ae and Cry2Af proteins of the invention, it is expected that deletions'up to amino acid position 625 at the C-terminus (I.e.. the C-terminal amino acid would be the amino acid at position 625) can be done while conserving the insecticidal activity, for the Cry2Ag protein, it is expected that deletions up to amino acid position 620 at the C-terminus (i.e., the C-terminal amino acid would be the amino acid at position 620) can be done while conserving the insecticidal activity of the protein. It is expected that N-terminal deletions up to • around amino acid position 50, preferably N-terminal deletions up to amino acid position 50 (i.e., the N-terminal amino acid would be position 50 of the sequences shown in the sequence listing) in the amino acid sequence of the three Cry2A proteins of this invention, retain most of their insecticidal activity against Lepidopteran insects.<br>

This includes naturally occurring, artificial or synthetic DNA sequences encoding the proteins of SEQ ID Nos. 2, 4 or 6 or their insecticidal fragments or variants as defined above. Also included herein are DNA sequences encoding insecticidal proteins which are similar enough to the coding regions of the genomic DNA sequences deposited or the sequences provided in the sequence listing so that they can (i.e., have the ability to) hybridize to these DNA sequences under stringent hybridization conditions. Stringent hybridization conditions, as used herein, refers particulariy to the following conditions: immobilizing the relevant genomic DNA sequences on a filter, and prehybridizing the filters for either 1 to 2 hours in 50 % fonmamide, 5 % SSPE, 2x Denhardt's reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 42 "^ C or 1 to 2 hours in 6x SSC, 2xDenhardrs reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 68 **C. The denatured (dig- or radio-)labeled probe is then added directly to the prehybridization fluid and incubation is carried out for 16 to 24 hours at the appropriate temperature mentioned above. After incubation, the filters are then washed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 2x SSC, 0.1 % SDS, followed by 2 washes of 30 minutes each at 68 °C in 0.5 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS. An autoradiograph is established by exposing the filters for 24 to 48 hours to X-ray film (Kodak XAR-2 or equivalent) at -70 ""C with an intensifying screen. Of course, equivalent conditions and parameters can be used in this process while still retaining the desired stringent hybridization conditions. Preferred variants of the cry2Ae DNA of this invention are a DNA encoding the insecticidal Cry2Ae protein variants described above, or a DNA sequence encoding an insecticidal protein with at least 92 %, preferably at least 93 to 97 %. particulariy at least 98 % or at least 99 %, sequence identity to the coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 1.

Prefen-ed variants of the cry2Ag DNA of this invention are a DNA encoding the Cry2Ag protein variants described above, or a DNA sequence with at least 86 %, preferably 87 %, particularly at least 98 % or at least 99 %, sequence identity to the coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 5. Particularly, such DNA sequences also hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions to the cry2Ag coding sequence deposited at the BCCM-LMBP under accession number LMBP 4249, or to the coding sequence of SEQ ID No. 5. The sequence identities referred to above are calculated using the GAP program of the Wisconsin package of GCG (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) version 10.0 (GCG defaults are used, for these DNA sequence comparisons, the "nwsgapdna" scoring matrix is used), the stringent hybridization conditions are as defined above,<br>
"Insecticidal activity" of a protein, as used herein, means the capacity of a protein to kill insects when such protein is fed to insects, preferably by expression in a recombinant host such as a plant "Insect-controlling amounts" of a protein, as used herein, refers to an amount of protein which is sufficient to limit damage on £ plant by insects feeding on such plant to commercially acceptable levels, e.g. by killing the insects or by inhibiting the insect development, fertility or growth in sucl^ a manner that they provide less damage to a plant and plant yield is not significantly adversely affected.<br>
In accordance with this invention, insects susceptible to the new Cry proteins of the invention are contacted with this protein in insect-controlling amounts, preferably insecticidal amounts. Preferred target insects for the proteins of this invention are economically damaging insect pests of corn, cotton, rice and soybean plants, particularly in Northern and Southern American countries. Particularly prefenred target insects for the Cry2A proteins of this invention, particularly the Cry2Ae protein, are Heliothis spp., Helicoverpa spp., Spodoptera spp., Sesamia spp., Anticarsia spp., Ostrinia spp., Chilo spp.. Sesamia spp.,<br><br>
Marasmia spp.. Scirpophaga spp. and Cnaphalocrocis spp. insects, preferably, most preferably Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea, Helicoverpa armigera, Anticarsia gemmatalis and Ostrinia nubilalis.<br>
The temns "Cry2A protein", "Cry2A protein of this invention", "Cry protein", or "Cry protein of this invention", as used herein, refers to any one of the new proteins isolated in accordance with this invention and identified and defined herein as Cry2Ae, Cry2Af or Cry2Ag protein. A Cry protein, as used herein, can be a protein in the full length size, also named a protoxin, or can be in a truncated form as long as the insecticidai activity is retained, or can be a combination of different proteins in a hybrid or fusion protein.   A "Cry protoxin" refers to the full length crystal protein as it is encoded by the naturally-occurring Bt DNA sequence, a "Cry toxin" refers to an insecticidai fragment thereof, particularly the smallest toxic fragment thereof, typically in the molecular weight range of about 50-65 kD. particularly about 60 kD, as determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. A "^cry gene". "cry2A gene", "cry DNA" or "cry2A DNA", as used herein, is a DNA sequence encoding a Cry protein in accordance with this invention, referring to any of the cry2Ae, cry2Af or cry2Ag DNA sequences defined above.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence, particularly DNA sequence, encoding the Cry proteins of this invention can be isolated in a conventional manner from the recombinant E. coll strains, deposited in accordance with the Budapest Treaty on October 6, 2000 at the Vakgroep voor Moleculaire Biologie-Plasmidencollectie, Universiteit Gent, K.L. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium (hereinafter abbreviated as "BCCM-LMBP") under the following accession numbers: BCCM-LMBP 4247 for strain XL1Blue:pUC1099E/cry2clone1. which encodes the Cry2Af protein; BCCM-LMBP 4248 for strain XL1Blue:pUC1099E/cry2clone7, which encodes the Cry2Ae protein; and BCCM-LMBP 4249 for strain XL1Blue;pUC2761A/cry2clone141, which encodes the Cry2Ag protein. The DNA sequences encoding the Cry proteins of the invention can be isolated from these deposited strains using routine techniques, and can be inserted in expression vectors to produce high amounts of<br><br>
Cry proteins.   The Cry proteins can be used to prepare specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in a conventional manner (Hofte et al., 1988).<br>
Also. DNA sequences for use in this invention can be synthetically made. Indeed, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, some amino acid codons can be replaced by others without changing the amino acid sequence of the protein. Furthermore, some amino acids can be substituted by other equivalent amino acids without significantly changing, preferably without changing, the insecticidal activity of the protein. Also, changes in amino acid sequence or composition in regions of the molecule, different from those responsible for binding or pore formation are less likely to cause a difference in insecticidal activity of the protein. Equivalents of the DNA sequences of the invention include DNA sequences hybridizing to the DNA sequence of the Cry proteins of SEQ ID. No. 1, 3, or 5 under stringent hybridization conditions and encoding a protein with the same insecticidal characteristics as the protein of this invention, or DNA sequences having a different codon usage compared to the native cry2A genes of this invention but which encode a protein with the same insecticidal activity and with substantially the same, preferably the same, amino acid sequence. Examples of codon-optimized DNA sequences for the Cry2Ae protein of this invention are found in SEQ ID Nos. 7 and 9. These DNA sequences were optimized by adapting the codon usage to that rnost preferred in plant genes, particulariy to genes native to the plant genus or species of interest (Bennetzen &amp; Hall, 1982; Itakura et al.. 1977) using available codon usage tables (SEQ ID No. 7 was more adapted towards expression in cotton, SEQ ID No. 9 more towards com), and also to eliminate stretches of AT or GC nucleotides longer then 5 or 6, preferably longer then 5, nucleotides, and also to insert suitable restriction sites.<br>
Also, the N-terminus of a Cry protein can be modified to have an optimum translation initiation context, thereby adding or deleting one or more amino acids at the N-terminal end of the protein. In most cases, it is preferred that the proteins of the invention to be expressed in plants cells start with a Met-Asp or Met-Ala dipeptide for optimal translation initiation, requiring the insertion in the cry2A DNA<br><br>
3f a codon encoding an Asp or Ala amino acid downstream of the start codon as a new second codon.<br>
Of course, any DNA sequence differing in its codon usage but encoding the same protein or a similar protein with substantially the same insecticidal activity, can be constnjcted, depending on the particular purpose. It has been described in prokaryotic and eucaryotic expression systems that changing the codon usage to that of the host cell is desired for gene expression in foreign hosts (Bennetzen &amp; Hall, 1982; Itakura et al„ 1977). Furthemnore, Bt crystal protein genes are known to have no bias towards eucaryotic codons, and to be very AT-rich (Adang et al., 1985, Schnepf et al., 1985), Codon usage tables are available in the literature (Wada et al., 1990; Murray et al,. 1989) and in the major DNA sequence databases (e,g. EMBL at Heidelberg, Germany). Accordingly, synthetic DNA sequences can be constructed so that the same or substantially the same proteins are produced. It is evident that several DNA sequences can be made once the amino acid sequence of the Cry proteins of this invention is known. Such other DNA sequences include synthetic or semi-synthetic DNA sequences that have been changed in order to inactivate certain sites in the gene, e.g. by selectively inactivating certain cryptic regulatory or processing elements present in the native sequence as described in PCT publications WO 91/16432 and WO 93/09218, or by adapting the overall codon usage to that of a more related host organism, preferably that of the host organism in which expression is desired. Several techniques for modifying the codon usage to that preferred by the host cells can be found in patent and scientific literature. The exact method of codon usage modification is not critical for this invention as long as most or all of the cryptic regulatory sequences or processing elements have been replaced by other sequences. Examples of DNA sequences optimized for expression in plants are shown in enclosed SEQ ID Nos. 7 and 9.<br>
Small modifications to a DNA sequence such as describee made, i.e.. by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (Ho et al.,19<br><br>
More profound modifications to a DNA sequence can be routinely done by de novo DNA synthesis of a desired coding region using available techniques.<br>
With the term "substantially the same", when refening to the amino acid sequence of a Cry protein, is meant to include an amino acid sequence that differs in no more than 5 %, preferably no more than 2 %, to the amino acid sequence of the protein compared to; and when referring to toxicity of Cry protein, is meant to include a protein whose LC50 value obtained under the same conditions of bio-assay differs by no more then 10 %, preferably no more than 5 %, of the LC50 value obtained for the protein compared to.<br>
The temi "domain" of a Cry toxin as used herein means any part(s) or domain(s) of the toxin with a specific structure that can be transferred to another (Cry) protein for providing a new hybrid protein with at least one functional characteristic (e.g.. the binding and/or toxicity characteristics) of the Cry toxin of the invention (Ge et a!.. 1991). Such parts can form an essential feature of the hybrid Bt protein with the binding and/or toxicity characteristics of the Cry protein of this invention. Such a hybrid protein can have an enlarged host range, an improved toxicity and/or can be used in a strategy to prevent insect resistance development (European Patent Publication ("EP") 408 403; Visser et al., 1993).<br>
The cry DNA sequences of the invention, prepared from total DNA, can be ligated in suitable expression vectors and transformed in E. QOH, and the clones can then be screened by conventional colony immunoprobing methods (French et a!., 1986) for expression of the toxin with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies raised against the Cry proteins.<br>
Also, the ay DNA of the invention, can be ligated in suitable Bt shuttle vectors (Lereclus et a!., 1992) and transformed in a crystal minus Bf-mutant The clones can then be screened for production of crystals (detected by microscopy) or crystal proteins (detected by SDS-PAGE), or can be tested for their insecticidal activity compared to the control crystal-minus strain.<br><br>
The genes encoding the Cry proteins of this invention can be sequenced in a conventional manner (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980; Sanger, 1977) to obtain the DNA sequence. Sequence comparisons indicated that the genes are different from previously described genes encoding protoxins and toxins with activity against Lepidoptera (see, e.g., Hofte and Whiteley. 1989; Crickmore. et aL. 1998; and the October 16, 2000 update on the Bt nomenclature website con-esponding to the Crickmore et al. (1998) publication, found at:<br>
http://epuaix.biols.susx.ac.uk/Home/Neil Crickmore/Bt/index.html).    AISO, the Cry2A proteinS Of<br>
the invention are novel over any of the Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein sequences in the December 13,2001 update of this Bt nomenclature website.<br>
An insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequences, encoding an insecticidally effective portion of the newly identified Cry protein protoxin forms, can be made in a conventional manner after sequence analysis of the gene. In such fragments, it is prefenred that at least the sequence homologous to the conserved sequence block 5 of Bt crystal proteins (Hofte &amp; Whiteley, 1989; Schnepf et al., 1998) is included in such protein, preferably up to two amino acids after this homologous region. For the Cry2Ae and Cry2Af proteins, this homologous region ends at amino acid position 625 in SEQ ID Nos. 2 and 4, respectively, for Cry2Ag at .position 620 in SEQ ID No. 6. The amino acid sequence of the Cry proteins can be determined from the DNA sequence of the isolated DNA sequences. By "an insecticidally effective part (or portion or fragment)" of DNA sequences encoding the Cry protein, also referred to herein as "truncated gene" or "truncated DNA". is meant a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide which has fewer amino acids than the Cry protein protoxin fomn but which is insecticidal.<br>
In order to express all or an insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequence encoding a Cry protein of this invention in E. coli, in other Bt strains and in plants, suitable restriction sites can be introduced, flanking the DNA sequence. This can be done by site-directed mutagenesis, using well-known procedures (Stanssens et al., 1989; White et al., 1989).    In order to obtain improved expression in plants.<br><br>
the codon usage of the cry gene or insecticidally effective cry gene pan or inis invention can be modified to form an equivalent, modified or artificial gene or gene part in accordance with PCT publications WO 91/16432 and WO 93/09218; EP 0 358 962 and EP 0 359 472. or the Bt genes or gene parts can be inserted in the plastid, mitochondrial or chloroplast genome and expressed there using a suitable promoter (e.g., Mc Bride et al., 1995; US patent 5,693,507). For obtaining enhanced expression in monocot plants such as com, an intron, preferably a monocot intron, also can be added to the chimeric gene, and the DNA sequence of the cry gene or its insecticidal part can be further changed in a translationally neutral manner, to modify possibly inhibiting DNA sequences present in the gene part by means of site-directed intron insertion and/or by introducing changes to the codon usage, e.g., adapting the codon usage to that most preferred by plants. preferably the specific relevant plant genus, (Murray et al., 1989) without changing significantly, preferably without changing, the encoded amino acid sequence.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, it is preferred that the proteins are targeted to intracellular organelles such as plastids. preferably chloroplasts, mitochondria, or are secreted from the cell, potentially optimizing protein stability and/or expression. For this purpose, the chimeric genes of the invention comprise a coding region encoding a signal or target peptide, linked to the Cry protein coding region of the invention. Particularly preferred peptides to be included in the proteins of this invention are the transit peptides for chloroplast or other plastid targeting, especially duplicated transit peptide regions from plant genes whose gene product is targeted to the plastids. the optimized transit peptide of Capellades et al. (US Patent 5,635,618). the transit peptide of ferredoxin-NADP*oxidoreductaSe from spinach (Oelmuller et al.. 1993), the transit peptide described in Wong et al, (1992) and-the targeting peptides in published PCT patent application WO 00/26371. Also preferred are peptides signalling secretion of a protein linked to such peptide outside the cell, such as the secretion signal of the potato proteinase inhibitor II (Keil et al.. 1986), the secretion signal of the alpha-amylase 3 gene of rice (Sutliff et al., 1991) and the secretion signal of tobacco PR1 protein (Cornelissen et al., 1986).<br><br>
Particularly useful signal peptides in accordance with the invention include the chloroplast transit peptide (e.g.. Van Den Broeck et al. (1985), or the optimized chloroplast transit peptide of US patent 5, 510.471 and US patent 5.635,618 causing transport of the protein to the chloroplasts, a secretory signal peptide or a peptide targeting the protein to other plastids, mitochondria, the ER, or another organelle. Signal sequences for targeting to intracellular organelles or for secretion outside the plant ceil or to the cell wall are found in naturally targeted or secreted proteins, preferably those described by Klosgen et al. (1989), Klosgen and Weil (1991). Neuhaus &amp; Rogers (1998), Bih et al. (1999). Morris et al. (1999). Hesse et al. (1989), Tavladoraki et al. (1998), Terashima et al. (1999). Park et al. (1997), Shcherban et al. (1995). all of which are incorporated herein by reference, particularly the signal peptide sequences from targeted or secreted proteins of com, cotton, rice or soybean.<br>
Furthermore, the binding properties of the Cry proteins of the invention can be evaluated, using methods known in the art (e.g.. Van Rie et al.. 1990). to determine if the Cry proteins of the invention bind to sites on the insect midgut that are not recognized (or competed for) by other, known Cry or other Bt proteins. Bt toxins with different binding sites for which there is non-competitive binding in relevant susceptible insects are very valuable to replace known Bt toxins to which insects may have developed resistance, or to use In combination with Bt toxins having a different mode of actton to prevent or delay the development of insect resistance against Bt toxins, particularly when expressed in a plant. Because of the characteristics of the newly isolated Bt toxins, they are extremely useful for transforming plants, e.g. monocots such as corn or rice and dicots such as cotton, soybean and Brassica species plants, to protect these plants from insect damage. It has been described that in Helicoverpa zea, the Cry2Aa protein does not share binding sites with the CrylAc protein (English et al., 1994). Similarly, it is expected that the binding properties of the Cry2A proteins of the current invention will be different compared to those of Cryl or Cry9 toxins currently used in transgenic plants in the relevant insect pests.   Such different binding properties<br><br>
an be measured by routine binding assays as described above.   Especially for<br>
sect resistance management purposes for a specific insect pest, it is preferred to<br>
Dmbine a Cry2A protein of this invenion with another insect control protein,<br>
articularly a Bt crystal protein, which does not recognize at least one binding site<br>
^cognized by such Cry2A protein.  Prefen'ed insect control proteins to combine<br>
ith  the Cry2A  proteins  of this  invention,   preferably  the   Cry2Ae   protein,<br>
articularly for simultaneous expression in plants, preferably cotton plants, include<br>
^e Cry1F protein or hybrids derived from a Cry1F protein (e.g., the hybrid Cry1A-<br>
;ry1F proteins described in US patents 6,326,169; 6,281,016; 6.218,188, or toxic<br>
•agments thereof), the Cry1 A-type proteins or toxic fragments thereof, preferably<br>
ie CrylAc protein or hybrids derived from the CrylAc protein (e.g., the hybrid<br>
JrylAb-CrylAc protein described in US patent 5,880.275). the VIP3Aa protein or<br>
I toxic fragment thereof as descibed in Estmch et al., 1996 and US Patent<br>
i.291,156, insecticidal proteins from Xhenorhabdus, Serratia or Photorhabdus<br>
►pedes strains (e.g.. Waterfield et al., 2001; ffrench-Constant and Bowen, 2000).<br>
n one embodiment, such co-expression is easily obtained by transforming a plant<br>
already expressing an insect control protein with a Cry2A of this invention, or by<br>
:rossing plants transfomned with the insect control protein and plants transformed<br>
vith the Cry2A protein of this invention.  For cotton plants, preferably the Cry2Ae<br>
)rotein is used as first insect control protein and as second insect control protein<br>
he CrylAc or VIP3Aa proteins or derivatives thereof are used.    Methods for<br>
}btaining expression of different Bt (or similariy, for other insect control proteins)<br>
nsecticidal proteins in the same plant in an effort to minimize or prevent<br>
esistance development to transgenic insect-resistant plants are described in EP<br>
Datent 0 408 403.<br>
The Cry2A proteins of this invention can also conveniently be used to control insects in case insect resistance develops against insect control proteins, such as the Cry1 Bt proteins, which are currently already commercialized in transgenic plants.<br>
Preferably, for selection purposes but also for increasing the weed control options, the transgenic plants of the invention are also transformed with a DNA encoding a<br><br>
protein conferring resistance to a broad-spectrum herbicide, e.g., herbicides based on glufosinate or glyphosate.<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part or its equivalent, preferably the cry chimeric gene, encoding an insecticidally effective portion of the Cry protoxin, can be stably inserted in a conventional manner into the nuclear genome of a single plant cell, and the so-transformed plant cell can be used in a conventional manner to produce a transformed plant that is insect-resistant. In this regard, a disarmed Ti-plasmid, containing the insecticidally effective cry gene part, in Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be used to transform the plant cell, and thereafter, a transformed plant can be regenerated from the transformed plant cell using the procedures described, for example, in EP 0 116 718, EP 0 270 822, PCT publication WO 84/02913 and published European Patent application ("EP") 0 242 246 and in Gould et al. (1991). Preferred Ti-plasmid vectors each contain the insecticidally effective cry gene part between the border sequences, or at least located to the left of the right border sequence, of the T-DNA of the Ti-plasmid. Of course, other types of vectors can be used to transform the plant cell, using procedures such as direct gene transfer (as described, for example in EP 0 233 247). pollen mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 270 356, PCT publication WO 85/01856, and US Patent 4,684,611), plant RNA virus-mediated transfomiation (as described, for example in EP 0 067 553 and US Patent 4,407,956), liposome-mediated transformation (as described, for example in US Patent 4,536,475), and other methods such as the recently described methods for transfonning certain lines of com (e.g., US patent 6,140,553; Fromm et al,, 1990; Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990) and rice (Shimamoto et al.. 1989; Datta et al., 1990) and the method for transforming monocots generally (PCT publication WO 92/09696). For cotton transformation, especially preferred is the method described in PCT patent publication WO 00/71733, For soybean transformation, reference is made to methods known in the art. e.g., Hinchee et al. (1988) and Christou et al. (1990) or the method of WO 00/42207.<br><br>
Also, besides transformation of the nuclear genome, also transformation of the plastid genome, preferably chloroplast genome, is included in the invention, Kota et al, (1999) have described a method to overexpress a Cry2Aa protein in tobacco chloroplasts.<br>
The resulting transformed plant can be used in a conventional plant breeding scheme to produce more transformed plants with the same characteristics or to introduce the insecticidally effective cry gene part in other varieties of the same or related plant species. Seeds, which are obtained from the transformed plants, contain the insecticidally effective cry gene part as a stable genomic insert. Cells of the transformed plant can be cultured in a conventional manner to produce the insecticidally effective portion of the Cry protoxin, preferably the Cry toxin, which can be recovered for use in conventional insecticide compositions against Lepidoptera (US Patent 5,254,799).<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part, preferably the truncated cry gene, is inserted in a plant cell genome so that the inserted gene is downstream (i.e., 3') of, and under the control of, a promoter which can direct the expression of the gene part in the plant cell. This is preferably accomplished by inserting the cry chimeric gene in the plant cell genome, particulariy in the nuclear or plastid (e.g., chloroplast) genome. Preferred promoters include: the strong constitutive 35S ' promoters (the "35S promoters") of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) of isolates CM 1841 (Gardner et al.. 1981), CabbB-S (Franck et al., 1980) and CabbB-JI (Hull and Howell, 1987); the 35S promoter described by Odell et al. (1985), promoters from the ubiquitin family (e.g., the maize ubiquitin promoter of Christensen et al., 1992, see also Cornejo et al., 1993), the gos2 promoter (de Pater et al., 1992). the emu promoter (Last et al., 1990), Arabidopsis actin promoters such as the promoter described by An et al. (1996), rice actin promoters such as the promoter described by Zhang et al. (1991); promoters of the Cassava vein mosaic virus (WO 97/48819, Verdaguer et al. (1998)) , the pPLEX series of promoters from Subterranean Clover Stunt Vims (WO 96/06932, particulariy the S7 promoter), a alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, e.g., pAdhlS (GenBank accession numbers<br><br>
X04049, X00581). and the TRV promoter and the TR2' promoter (the 'TRf promoter" and TR2' promoter", respectively) which drive the expression of the V and 2' genes, respectively, of the T-DNA (Velten et al., 1984), Alternatively, a promoter can be utilized which is not constitutive but rather is specific for one or more tissues or organs of the plant (e.g., leaves and/or roots) whereby the inserted cry gene part is expressed only in cells of the specific tissue(s) or organ(s). For example, the insecticidally effective cry gene part could be selectively expressed in the leaves of a plant (e.g., corn, cotton) by placing the insecticidally effective gene part under the control of a light-inducible promoter such as the promoter of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene of the plant Itself or of another plant such as pea as disclosed in US Patent 5,254,799. Another alternative is to use a promoter whose expression is inducible, preferably by wounding such as insect feeding, e.g., the MPI promoter described by Cordera et ai. (1994), or by chemical factors.<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part is inserted in the plant genome so that the inserted gene part is upstream (i.e., 5') of suitable 3' end transcription regulation signals (i.e., transcript fonnation and polyadenylation signals). This is preferably accomplished by inserting the cry chimeric gene in the plant cell genome. Preferred polyadenylation and transcript formation signals include those of the noplaine synthase gene (Depicker et al., 1982), the octopine synthase gene (Gielen et al., 1984) and the T-DNA gene 7 (Velten and Schell, 1985), which act as 3'-untranslated DNA sequences in transformed plant cells.<br>
The insecticidally effective cry gene part can optionally be inserted in the plant genome as a hybrid gene (US Patent 5,254.799; Vaeck et al., 1987) under the control of the same promoter as a selectable or scorable marker gene, such as the neo gene (EP 0 242 236) encoding kanamycin resistance, so that the plant expresses a fusion protein which is easily detectable.<br>
Transformation of plant cells can also be used to produce the proteins of the invention in large amounts in plant cell cultures, e.g., to produce a Cry2A protein<br><br>
that can then be applied onto crops after proper formulation. When reference to a transgenic plant cell is made herein, this refers to a plant cell (or also a plant protoplast) as such in isolation or in tissue culture, or to a plant cell (or protoplast) contained in a plant or in a differentiated organ or tissue, and both possibilities are specifically included herein. Hence, a reference to a plant cell in the description or claims is not meant to refer only to isolated cells in culture, but refers to any plant cell, wherever it may be located or in whatever type of plant tissue or organ it may be present.<br>
All or part of the c/y gene, encoding an anti-lepidopteran protein, can also be used to transform other bacteria, such as a 8. thuringiensis which has insecticidal activity against Lepidoptera or Coleoptera. Thereby, a transfomied Bt strain can be produced which is useful for combatting a wide spectrum of lepidopteran and coleopteran insect pests or for combatting additional lepidopteran insect pests. Transformation of bacteria, such as bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Bacillus or Escherichia, with all or part of the cry gene of this invention, incorporated in a suitable cloning vehicle, can be carried out in a conventional manner, preferably using conventional electroporation techniques as described in Mahillon et al. (1989) and in PCT Patent publication WO 90/06999.<br>
Transformed Bacillus species strains containing the cry gene of this invention can be fennented by conventional methods (Dulmage, 1981; Bernhard and Utz, 1993) to provide high yields of cells. Under appropriate conditions which are well understood (Dulmage. 1981), these strains each sporulate to produce crystal proteins containing the Cry protoxin in high yields.<br>
An insecticidal, particularly anti-lepidopteran, composition of this invention can be formulated in a conventional manner using the microorganisms transformed with the cry gene, or preferably their respective Cry proteins or the Cry protoxin, toxin or insecticidally effective protoxin portion as an active ingredient, together with suitable carriers, diluents, emulsifiers and/or dispersants (e.g., as described by Bernhard and Utz, 1993).   This insecticide composition can be formulated as a<br><br>
wettable powder, pellets, granules or dust or as a liquid formulation with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents as a foam, gel, suspension, concentrate, etc.<br>
A method for controlling insects, particularly Lepidoptera, in accordance with this invention can comprise applying (e.g., spraying), to a locus (area) to be protected, an insecticidal amount of the Cry proteins or host cells transformed with the cry gene of this invention. The locus to be protected can include, for example, the habitat of the insect pests or growing vegetation or an area where vegetation is to be grown.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Characterization of the strains.<br>
The BTS02761A and BTS01099E strains were isolated from grain dust collected in the Philippines (South Tagalog) and Belgium (Deerlijk), respectively.<br>
Each strain can be cultivated on conventional standard media, preferably T3 medium (tryptone 3 g/l. tryptose 2 g/l, yeast extract 1.5 g/l, 5 mg MnCb. 0.05 M Na2HP04.2H20. 0.05 M NaH2PO4.H20, pH 6.8 and 1.5% agar), preferably at 28 °C. For long term storage, it is preferred to mix an equal volume of a spore-crystal suspension with an equal volume of 50% glycerol and store this at -70 °C or lyophilize a spore-crystal suspension.   For sporulation. growth on T3 medium is<br><br>
preferred for 72 hours at 28 X. followed by storage at 4 X. The crystal proteins produced by the strains during sporulation are packaged in crystals.<br>
Example 2 : Insecticidal activity of the BTS02761A and BTS01099E strains aigainst selected lepidopteran insect species.<br>
Toxicity assays were performed on neonate larvae of Helicoverpa zea, Helicoverpa armigera, Heliothis virescens, Ostrinia nubilalis, Spodoptera frugiperda, and Sesamia nonagrioides fed on an artificial diet layered with undiluted alcaline {pH12) extract of spore-crystal mixtures from either BTS01099E or BTS02761 A.<br>
The artificial diet (Vanderzant, 1962) was dispensed in wells of Costar 48-well plates, 25 microliter of the extract on the surface of the diet and dried in a laminar air flow. One larva was placed in each well and 18 larvae were used per sample. Dead and living larvae were counted on the seventh day. The percentage of dead larvae are shown in Table I below.<br>
Mixtures of spore/crystals from each of the strains BTS02761A and BTS01099E were tested in bioassays and gave the following results:<br><br>
*: surviving larvae slightly affected* in their growth<br>
Negative controls (standard diet): Hz: 6% M, Hv: 17% M, Sf: 0% M.<br>
Hz: Helicoverpa zea; Hv: Heliothis virescens; Sf: Spodoptera faigiperda; On:<br>
Ostrinia nubilalis; Sn: Sesamia nonagroides (NT means not tested).<br><br>
Example 3 : Identification and characterization of new crv2A genes from Bt strains BTS01099E and BTS02761A,<br>
Using appropriate primers, a portion of the crylA gene(s) from the BTS02761A and BTS01099E strains were amplified; subsequently these amplification products were digested with restriction enzymes. The pattern obtained was then compared with the pattern that is obtained when such digests are perfonned on amplification products derived from strains containing known crylA genes. Based on the restriction digest pattern, the c/yZA genes from strains BTS02761A and BTS01099E appeared to be novel. Therefore, the amplification product was sequenced. This confirmed that the amplified fragments were derived from novel cry2A genes: strain BTS02761A contained a novel cryZA-like gene, whereas strain 1099E contained two novel Cfy2A-like genes.<br>
Total DNA from strains BTS02761A and BTS01099E was treated with Sau3A, size fractionated and fragments of 7 to 10 kb were ligated into pUC19l (a derivative of pUC19), cut with BamHI and treated with TsAP (heat stable alkaline phospatase). This ligation mixture was electroporated in E. coli XL1 Blue.<br>
Colony hybridizations, using the DIG-labeled PCR fragments as probes, identified positive clones. The recombinant E. coli strains were deposited on October 6, 2000 at the Vakgroep voor Moleculaire Biologie-Plasmidencollectie, Universiteit Gent, K.L. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium (hereinafter abbreviated as "BCCM-LMBP") under the following accession numbers: BCCM-LMBP 4247 for strain XL1Blue:pUC1099E/cry2clone1, which encodes a protein named Cry2Af; BCCM-LMBP 4248 for strain XL1Blue:pUC1099E/cry2clone7, which encodes a protein named Cry2Ae; and BCCM-LMBP 4249 for strain XL1Blue:pUC2761A/cry2clone141. which encodes a protein named Cry2Ag. The genes can be isolated from these deposited clones by a Notl-Fsel digest. The insert from these clones was subcloned into shuttle vector pSL40L The resulting plasmid was first transformed into E. coli GM2163.   A plasmid prep from<br><br>
this strain was then electroporated into a crysiai-minus D. inuririyiensi&amp; vouciy beriiner 1715 strain.<br>
An alkaline extract prepared from a spore/crystal mixture from the recombinant Bt strains was then used in bioassays to evaluate the toxicity of the novel Cry2A proteins. This extract was tested in the assay as described above in Example 1. The results are shown in Table II:<br><br>
"Cone": total protein concentration of strain extract using the Bradford method (microgr/ml); "Ha": Heliothis armigera, the other abbreviations are as used above in Table I; the included controls (nomriai diet. PBS-BSA addition or unstransfomied crystal-minus Bt strain 1715) give no significant mortality.<br>
Also, the recombinant clone expressing the Cry2Af protein shows a significant mortality when tested on selected Lepidopteran insects.<br>
Also, an analysis was done to determine the LC50 and LC90 values for the recombinantly produced Cry2Ae protein, in comparison with the known Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab proteins.<br>
For this assay, insect-specific artificial diet was dispensed in wells of Costar 24-well plates. 50 microliter of alcaline (pH12) extract of spore-crystal mixtures of the recombinant Bt strain containing the cry2Ae gene originating from XL1Blue:pUC1099Eclone7. was applied on the surface of the diet and dried in a laminar air flow. The diet for S. frugiperda en O. nubilalis contained: 1000ml water;<br><br>
agar: 20 g; cornflour: 112 g; wheat germ: 28 g; yeast: 30 g; ascorbic acid: 4.8 g; benzoic acid: 1.2 g; nipagin:1 g; aureomycin: 0.06 g; nystatin: 0.03 g. The diet for H. virescens en H. zea contained: 1000ml water; agar: 20 g; soyflour: 81 g; wheat germ: 36 g, sucrose: 14.7 g; com oil: 5 ml; Wesson salt mixture: 10 g; Vanderzant vitamin mixture: 9.5 g; sorbic acid: 1.1g; nipagin: 1 g; aureomycin: 0.34 g; nystatin: 0.06 g. Different protein concentrations were tested so that an LC50 value could be determined. For tests on H. zea, H, virescens and S. frugiperda, one larva was placed in each well and 20 larvae were used per sample. For tests on O. nubiialis. two larva were placed in each well and 24 larvae were used per sample. Dead and living larvae were counted on the seventh day (on the sixth day for S. frugiperda, on the fifth day for O. nubiialis). The LC50 and LC90 values were calculated with probit analysis (POLO program. LeOra Software. 1987, POLO-PC. A user's guide to probit or logic analysis.Berkeley, California). The results are shown in Table III below.<br><br>
NT: not tested; Cone: total protein concentration in alcaline extract of recombinant Bt strain producing the relevant protein in microgr/ml; an asterisk denotes that the result for O. nubiialis was obtained with a different batch having a different protein concentration (indicated between brackets under the column "Cone."); controls (normal diet, added PBS-BSA or crystal-minus control Bt strain) give no more then 0-5% mortality.<br><br>
Using the same experimental setup as above for Ostrinia nubilalis, but using purified Cry2Ae protein against the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis, (testing 20 wells with 1 larva per concentration) a high activity of this protein against this important soybean pest insect was found. The LC50 value for the purified Cry2Ae protein to this insect was found to be 0.44 ng/cm^ (at 95% confidence level; this LC50 value is the mean value of 2 assays of different bio-batches of purified protein), the LC90 value was found to be 7.79 ng/cm^ (at the 95 % confidence level; this LC90 value is the mean value of 2 bio-assays of different batches of purified protein). Using the same experimental setup as above for Ostrinia with purified Cry2Ae protein, the significant toxicity of this protein to Helicoverpa Zea and Ostrinia Nubilalis was confirmed (LC50 values to these insects were found to be 145.1 and 48,31 ng/ cm^, respectively (at 95 % confidence level, these LC50 values are the mean values of 2 bio-assays of different batches of purified protein on each respective insect)).<br>
These results show that the new Cry proteins of the invention, and particulariy the Cry2Ae protein, are useful proteins with high activity to relevant Lepidopteran insect pests, particularly to Heliothis zea, Ostrinia nubilalis, Anticarsia gemmatalis. and Helicoverpa zea which are commercially damaging insect pests for plants such as soybean, cotton and com.<br>
The sequences determined for the isolated c;y2&gt;A genes of the invention, and the determined amino acid sequence, are shown in the enclosed Sequence Listing. PainA/ise alignments using the GAP program in the Wisconsin package of GOG indicated the levels of sequence identity with other Cry2A sequences (for the sequences of the known Cry2A proteins and DNAs, see Crickmore et al. (1998) and the above recited internet website), as shown in Table IVA and IVB (GCG defaults were used within the GAP program; for the amino acid sequence comparisons, the blosum62 scoring matrix was used, for the DNA sequence comparisons, the nwsgapdna scoring matrix was used).<br><br><br>
Example 4: production of the novel Cry proteins in transformed plants-<br>
Chimeric genes each encoding the Cry2Ae. Cry2Af and Cry2Ag proteins are made using well known procedures, using promoters such as the CaMV 35S (Hull and Howell, 1987) and ubiquitin (Christensen et al., 1992) promoters. Preferably, the codon usage of the open reading frame is adapted to that of the host plant so as to optimize expression efficiency, as described in published PCT patent application WO 94/12264. Also, in some chimeric genes DNA sequences encoding a transit peptide (as described in the description) are included to target the Cry2A protein of the invention to the plant chloroplasts. For transformation of corn and cotton with a chimeric gene encoding the Cry2Ae protein, several chimeric gene constructs were inserted in Agrobacterium strain<br><br>
)lasmids. These construtts included: constructs pACS9 and pACSH wherein the zrylAe coding sequence of SEQ ID No, 7 was functionally linked to the 35S2 Dfomoter from Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (Odell et aL, 1985), a leader sequence rrom the chlorophyl a/b binding protein gene from Petunia (Harpster et aL, 1988), and a 3' transcript termination and polyadenylation region of the 35S gene from Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (Sanfacon et al, 1991), and constructs pACS12 and pACS13 with the same regulatory regions and the same op/2Ae coding region, except that also a DNA sequence encoding the TpssuAt transit peptide allowing chloroplast targeting (Krebbers et aL. 1988) was inserted at the 5' end of the orylAe coding region, so that a transit peptide fusion protein is produced. These constructs also included either a DNA sequence encoding a glyphosate herbicide resistance protein (described in published PCT patent application WO 97/04103, linked to an optimized transit peptide (US patent 5,635,618)) or a DNA sequence encoding a glufosinate herbicide resistance protein (Thompson et aL. 1987) as selectable marker under the control of the CsVMV promoter of the Cassava Vein Mosaic Virus (Verdaguer et aL. 1996. 1998) and the 3' transcript termination and polyadenylation region of the nopaline synthase gene (Depicker et aL. 1982). Corn cells were stably transformed with the pACS9, pACSH, pACS12 and pACS13 constructs by either Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as described in US Patent 6,140,553, incorporated by reference. Cotton cells were stably transformed with the pACS 9, pACS11, pACS12 and pACS13 constructs using the transfomiation method described in PCT patent publication WO 00/71733. incorporated heYein by reference. Rice-cells are stably transformed with the method described in published PCT patent application WO 92/09696. Tobacco cells were stably transformed with the pACSII and pACS12 constructs using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, essentially as described in EP patent 0 116 718 or Deblaere et aL (1987).<br>
The transfomned cells and plantlets regenerated therefrom are grown in media containing the selective agents phosphinotricin or glyphosate. so that most if not all of the regenerated plants will be transformed.<br>
Regenerated transformed tobacco, corn, cotton and rice plants are selected by Cry2A ELISA, Northern and Southern blot and according to insecticidal efficacy<br><br>
and agronomic characteristics. Chimeric cry2A gene-containing progeny plants show improved resistance to insects compared to untransformed control plants with an appropriate segregation of the insect resistance and the transformed phenotype. Protein and RNA measurements show that plants with increased insect resistance have a higher expression of the novel Cry2A protein in their cells.<br><br>
